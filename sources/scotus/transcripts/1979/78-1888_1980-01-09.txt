Mr® Walshr you may proceed whenever you are ready®
ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDMUND C. WALSH ,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR» WALSHj

Mr» Chief Justice, and may it pleas® the

C&urts
This is a case which is here on certiorari through
the Second Circuit»

It is a case in which the District Court

awarded attorney’s fees against the Petitioner,, the Commissioner
of the Department of Income Maintenance in his official capacity
to ba paid cut of State funds of the State of Connecticut to
the respondent’s attorneys in the amount of some $3,.000»
The District Court found the award to be authorised
by the Civil Rights Attorney’s Peas -Awards Act of IS76 to the
plaintiff as the prevailing party.

The casse was settled by

consent decree,
QUESTION t

Mr, Walsht looking at page 21A of the

petition for certiorari, did

their consent decree reserve to

the court the right to fin attorney’s fees for the plaintiffs
in the ease?
MR® WALSHs
candor it must be

It did not, Your Honor, but in all

said that prior to the entry of the consent

decree the State proposed that each party would pay its own

4
costs end the respondents" attorneys refused to agree to titiat
and we decided we would leave it to the District Court when
they brought a motion subsequently for attorney's fees„
QUESTION?

So the State, in effect, consented that

after the consent decree was entered

a motion for attorney9s

fees or a new suit for attorney's fees could be brought?
MF.« WALSHs

Yes,» Your Honor, that is the only way

that we could get the consent

decree signed,,

that attorney's fees were awarded»

We do not agree

We do not agree to awarding

of attorney's fees»
QUESTION:

But you also say that, at least orally,

you did not agree that the consent decree settled all the
issues in the case, including the issues of whether attorney's
fees should be awarded»
HR, WALSH;

That is correct, Your Honor»

We just

apprised the District Court judge of our agreement that we had
not remained silent and it: was not to be inferred that the
agreement was inclusive.

In other words, they reserved the

right to bring the motion before the court? if I am answering
your question correctly.
The Gagne case presents two issues to this Court»
The first issue is whether the award is in fact authorized by
the Attorney's Fees Awards Act or, conversely, whether or not
the Eleventh Amendment prohibits such an award.

And, secondlyr

even if the award is authorised —• is not authorised by the

5
Fees Act, whether or not as the Second Circuit has held the
award has but the ancillary effect of an award for prospective
injunctive relief under Edelraan v. Jordan and would not be
barred by the Eleventh Amendment.
The case began when the respondent, who was a recipient
under Connecticut's aid to families with dependent children
programtchallenged the State's practices and policies with
respect to awarding her her employment expenses.

She was

employed at full-time and under the Federal statute, Section
402(a)(7) of the Social Security Act, that statute required
that any expenses reasonably attributable to the earning of
income will be — must be deducted from a person's gross earn­
ings .in computing the amount of their welfare assistance award.
The respondent claims specifically that the
departments imposed a maximum allowance with respect to trans­
portation allowance for her private automobile at S cants a
mile and a maximum lunch allowance of 50 percents per lunch.
She also claimed 'that they did not allow her certain work-related
clothing expenses which she had.
Before bringing the action the respondent requested
and received an administrative fair hearing on these issues
of the expenses and the State was upheld on the transportation
and lunch expenses*

It was directed to award her any fee she

had cor work-related clothing which she could prove.

And

•the fourth issue she brought at. the administrative hearing

6
was abandoned when she brought this case*

She also claimed

she was entitled to deduct her 16-year-old son's working
expenses from her award»
Five months after bringing the suit the State amended
its policy which is contained at AS6 of the appendix so as to
provide expressly that any expenses reasonably attributable to
employment were to be allowed to AFDC recipients and the
amended policy is at A68 and 69 of the appendix»
Subsequently, about a year,, in September of 1976,
the plaintiff filed an amended complaint claiming that the new
policy as revised still routinely disallowed expenses of the
plaintiff®
Finally9 after some discovery , the consent decree
was pis to .red into and the District Court I think awaited this
Court's decision in Hutto v. Finney and subsequently entered
its award of attorney's fees in favor of plaintiff's attorneys
of approximately $3,000 as the prevailing party under the Fees
Act®
The ease was appealed to -the Second Circuit, the
Second Circuit affirmed the District Court's award, holding
that the Attorney's Fees Award Act authorised a fee payable
against the State in a case where the — a constitutional
claim was combined with a statuto*? claim under 1981 and the
case was settled without a final- determination on the merits
of the constitutional claim so long as there was a common

7
of operative fact between the statutory and the constitutional
claim,,
The State claims that the Court of Appeals test
which was adopted from -the legislative history of the House
Report does not meet the requirements of this Court in the case
of Fitzpatrick vs Bitzer which held 'that in order to abrogate
che State’s Eleventh immunity congress must be acting pursuant
to section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to enforce a
substan.ti.ve guarantee of that amendment»
It has become clear since this Court decided Chapman

vQ Houston Welfare Rights Organination„ last June I believe it
wasf that the respondents in our viettf* did not even assert,
much less prevail, upon a claim seeking to enforce, a substantive
•> guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment»

We arrived at that

conclusion by the fact that in Chapman this Court said that
standing alone, section 19(a) (3} confers no substantive rights
on a plaintiff’s claim and that you must look to the underlying
statutory claim then to determine what is the substantive
basis of the plaintiffs claim»
And in this case, the substantive basis of the
plaintiff's claim is a claim to enforce a provision of the
Social Security Act»
What had been somewhat unclear before Chapman was
that customarily these claims for welfare, as we call them,
were asserted in the format also of a constitutional claim of

8

violations of the due process and equal protection clauses of
the Fourteenth Amendments

Under the doctrine of Hagans v, Lavine

that would confer jurisdiction on the Federal Court to hear the
case and unless the claim was wholly insubstantial or frivolous
and the court would then proceed to dispose of the statutory
claim,in most cases the constitutional claim was never decided,,
And so we claim —
QUESTION ;

Wall, what about in a case like that

where there is unquestionably a constitutional claim joined
with a statutory claim and the Court proceeds to decide the
statutory claim, never

reaches the constitutional claim,? and

the plaintiff wins on the statutory claime

Is it your position

that no fees are allowable?
MR. WALSH;

That

No fees are

allowed because in fact we say -that -«■

I would say that there are several holdings

0„K,
That would be the case,,

Now, QUESTIONS

Doesn't the legislative history’ support

that?
MR» WALSHs

I think, Your Honor, that the legislative

history does not support the claim in this case»
supported it in Hutto v. Finney»

It may have

That was a case where a

constitutional violation was; found»
In this case thorfs was no constitutional violation
found and the legislative history does not address specifically
the eleventh Amendment State immunity but the District Court
concluded that on the basis of the House Report which provided
that when the claims are combined that an award may be made»
But it is our claim that the Congress did not intend
or purport to abrogata the threshold requirement of Fitspatrick,
which is that the threshold fact of congressional authorisation
abrogated State's immunity could only be present when there is
authorization of Congress specifically authorising a suit
against the State in a claim and in legislation enacted pursuant
to section 5 to enforce the substantive guarantee

Now, if Congress meant nevertheless to make a
pronouncement that we declare we are enforcing a substantive
guarantee the Fourteenth Amendment when we say any claim

brought under section 1983, I don't think the history justifies
that, because I think you must read when it says any claim
brought it is implicit that it means any claim brought to
enforce civil rights or a substantive guarantee of the Four­

Our position is. Your Honor, that you

cannot tell that in a case of this kind until you examine the
underlying statute, which is the substantive basis cf the 19 83
claim*

But in one case 1983 was passed pursuant

to section 5 and in another case it is not*

Is that your

answer?
MR. WALSH I

No, Your Honor, I think 19 83 is never

passed, it is just an admission ticket to get the Federal
Court, it is the underlying claim that determines whether or
not the Fourteenth Amendment claim is being enforced.
QUESTIONS

Mr,-, Walsh9 maybe you have already covered

it.

Wasn’t that a case in which there was no

Chapman was a jurisdictional question,,

yes*. Your Honor, there was no constitutional claim»
QUESTION:

and a statutory claim»
MR» WALSH:
QUESTION:

Yes,» Your Honor»
So doesn’t it fit the description of the

kind of case in which the statute allows attorney's fees»

It

is a proceeding brought under 1983 in view of the fact that
one of tire underlying claims is the constitutional character»
MR» WALSH:

See<■ Your Honort Chapman tells us that

19 83 confers no substantive rights»
QUESTION:

Wellr they don’t argue that 1983 confers

any substantive rights»

As I understand, they say their

substantive rights were protected (a) by the Constitution -~
the merits of that wasn’t resolved -- (b) by 'the statute»
That is where the substantive rights come from»

That is what we get out of Chapman.
QUESTION:

But if it is not part of the case, there

is no jurisdiction.
HR. WALSH:

Well, unfortunately that is the trouble.

The liberal test of Hagans v« Lavine has been determined that
the

very liberal substantiality test —■
QUESTION:

MR. WALSH:

Right.
— the Court will say it is sufficient

to get a Federal Court who will consider -the statutory claim.
But that still does not confer, as I understand Chapman, any
substantive constitutional rights on the plaintiff's claim.
You must look to the underlying statute.

14

QUESTION:

I don8t understand®

MR» WALSH:

Now, the respondent has also cited the

case of Katzenbach v* Morgan proposition, if I understood him
correctly, that Congress ■— once Congress has determined that
it was acting pursuant to section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment
which has been suggested they said when we enacted 1983 we were
acting pursuant to section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, and
that is not for this Court even to question Congress as to
whether or not that was a proper exercise of their power under
“ section 5*
Mr® Justice Harlan in his dissenting opinion in
Xatzenbach spoke about that problem, saying that if Congress
was making that claim they were claiming they had a right

them xslvas, alone, without review by this Court, to define the
substantive scope of the Fourteenth Amendment»

And Mr»

Justice Harlan pointed out if that were the case it would
give Congress the right to alter decisions of this Court»
In fact, we think that that is what happened here, in effect
•the legislative history was used to altera

provision of

Fitzpatrick v* Bitzar because under this test of a common
nucleus of operative fact it isn’t essential that Congress be
acting pursuant to section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment; they
may ne or they may not be;

precisely what a common nucleus

of operative fact between a statutory claim and a constitutional
claim is unclear*

If the statutory claim itself provided for

15
enforcement of the Fourteenth Amendment there v?ould be no
problem and there would be no case.
Now, of course the Senate Report in the legislative
history points out at page 6342 of the 1977 Congressional notes
that the Act is limited to causes arising under our civil rights
laws.

And of course the purpose of the Act was stated to

cure the gaps brought about the Alyes'ka

decision in the award

of attorney's fees and civil rights cases®
And so we say Congress only intended when they enacted
the Fees Act to authorize fee3 for claims brought to enforce
'the Fourteenth Amendment and in this case the plaintiffs were
not

trying to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment substantive

guarantee, although they did recite 1983 and claimed their
statutory claim in terms of constitutional due process and
equal protection.
QUESTION:

Well, what if the case had gone to trial

and the judge addressed the statutory issue first and found
against you.

I suppose the statutory claim was that the State

law was inconsistent with Federal.
MR. WALSH:
QUESTIONt
MR. WALSH:
QUESTION;

Yes, sir.
That is called a statutory

claim —

Yes, sir.
— although it is a supremacy clause

claira.
MR. WALSH:

Supremacy clause claim?, yes, sir.

16

QUESTION?

Suppose the judge had said 'this is wholly

consistent with say Federal law and then he had gotten to the
constitutional claim and said,. well, both the State and the
Federal law are unconstitutional as a denial of equal protect»
ion»

Would there be attorney’s fees?
MR» WALSHs

If the Court found that there was a

MR» WALSH?

it would be interpreted as enforcing —

What would be?
The pleiintiff’s action as an action

QUESTION?

Well, what if your settlement agreement

had expressly recited that you were settling both the
constitutional and the statutory claim?
MR, WALSH?

Well, under my analysis, Your Honor, I

think that —
QUESTION?

Well, the suit would still have bean brought

for exactly the same purpose»
MR. WALSH?

That is right.. Your Honor»

I think the trouble is that these actions are brought

17
in terms of the constitutional question because -there is no
jurisdiction under 1331 because of a $10,000 limitation»
QUESTION:
MR» WALSH?

Yes, yes»
At any rate, the Senate Report says that

the Fees Act was intended to just be limited to civil rights
cases»

This is not a civil rights case»
And so we think Congress and the legislative history

had no such intention of abrogating the State's Eleventh Amend­
ment immunity»
Now, the second issue in the case is, as the Second
Circait held., that the Eleventh Amendment is not a bar to an
award of attorney’s fees in this case in any event, because
it comes within the permissible ancillary effect doctrine of
Sdel:.nan v« Jordan which held that a State may be required to
expend funds from its Treasury when it is enforcing an order
limited to prospective injunctive relief and the subject case
has an ancillary effect not barred by the Eleventh Amendment»
The circuits are divided on this question, as the Ccurt of
Appeals indicated in its opinion*

It seems to me, and I

think that the respondent's brief concedes, that this is an
extension of the careful definition of what an ancillary effect
was in Edelmaat and it is an expansion of -that doctrine from
one which is necessary consequence of compliance with an order
for perspective conjunctive relief to a fee awarded in a ease
brought to obtain an order for prospective conjunctive relief»

18
brought to obtain an order for prospective injunctive relief*
And so consequently we feel it is not in accord with’. Edelntan
v« Jordan# the ancillary effect# and -that it should —•> .consequenti
for both those reasons the decision of the Court of Appeals
should be reversed*

And there was a cross appeal which was

remanded to the District Court# respondent's cross appeal# and
that should be — if -the case is dismissed# that should be
vacated*
X would like# Your Honor# to save any remaining time
I have for rebuttal*
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Very well# Mr. Walsh.

Ms. Pilver®
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MS. JOAN E. PILVER# ESQ.„
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MS. PILVER*

Mr. Chief Justice# and raay it please the

Court:
My name is Joan Pilver and I represent the respondent
Virginia Gagne in this matter*
X would like to begin by offering just a further
response to -the question posed by Mr. Justice Rehnquist with
regard to why the matter of the attorney’s fees was not taken
up in the consent decree itself# and there are really two
reasons.
One# because we felt it would create a potential
conflict of interest situation# which we think can arise in any

19

situation where attorney's fees are attempted to be resolved
with any consent decree»

The fact that there was a legal

dispute between -the parties meant that there would have been
no way the matter could have been resolved with with any consent
decree and, in fact, the entire consent decree would not have
been able to have been entered if in fact we had waited — had
insisted on the matter of attorney’s fees being in the consent
decree itself.
QUESTION;

Nell, I have been away from 'the private

practice for ten years and perhaps things have changed a good
deal since then, but for instance in other Federal statutes

like title VII of the Freedom of Information Act, Equal
Credit Opportunity Act also provide for the award of attorney’s
fees.

And in the "Sixties, at any rate, it was the practice

if you were settling a case and the statute authorized an award
under which the plaintiff was suing authorised an award of
attorney’s fees to the prevailing party, you settled that at
the same time.

That was one. of the issues in dispute and if

you were going to settle the case, you settled whether or not
the person was going to get attorney’s fees»
MS, PILVER;
Honor,

1 think that is a good point. Your

However, I would suggest in this particular case the

law :.n this area was very unclear.

The defendant took the

position that as a matter of right we were not entitled **« as
a matter of law w© were not entitled to attorney’s fees-, and

20

this was prior to the decision of this Court in Hutto v<,
Finney,,

So it was really a legal decision that had to be made

by the Court»
Additionally,. I think several courts have expressed
the opinion, in particular a recent decision by the Court
in Prandini v. National Tea Company, of the various kinds of
potential conflicts of interest that can arise when the matter
of attorney’s fees is settled within the consent decree itselfp the fact that some of the substantive provisions in the
consent decree can be bargained away in exchange for the
attorney9 s fees„
QUESTIONs

Well, that is certainly true in any

litigation that I am familiar with, is that one of the things
on the table, so to speak, is whether the plaintiff recovers not
only $150,'000 for the loss of an arm but $25,000 attorney's
fees 9

And ■*—

those out.

QUESTIONS

And costs,

QUESTIONS

-- and costs.

And you simply negotiate

You may have to give up some substantive .right or

give up some part of your substantive recovery in order to get
your attorney's fees»
MS0 PILVER:

I think that is very possible in those

cases where the plaintiff would otherwise have to pay his
counsel's attorney's fees»

In many of the cases brought under

tiie Civil Rights Attorney’s Fees Awards Act the plaintiff will

21
have no fees with which to pay his counsel and the only fee that
will be paid will come from the defendant,,

So that where the

only interest that the plaintiff has is in the substantive
settlement and the

attorney's interest on the other hand is

in the recovering and in that —»
QUESTIONS

That is typical in a contingent fee action,

too, isn't it, where you have a plaintiff who doesn't — has
little or no money and is dependent upon the recovery to pay
his own attorney?
MS» PIL^ERs
QUESTION;

That is quite true, Your Honor,,
Do you think there is any analogy, Mse

Pilvsr, in this situation and the one where parties will agree
or stipulate consent to liability but submits for a litigated
basis the issue of the amount of damages?
MS» PILVER;

I think there is a similarity and I

th±n?c that kind of approach is very useful to settle the merits
of the case first and then allow those other matters to be
handled either in a separate negotiation or if they cannot
settle it, then to allow it to be decided by the court»
I think in these kind of cases I think it is really something
that should be encouraged because of -idle potential problems that
can arise»
Two terms ago this Court in Hutto v» Finney held
that Congress has plenary power under section 5 of the Four-"
fceench Amendment to set aside a State's immunity from retro-

22
active relief and permit an award of attorney's fees to be
entered against State officials acting in their official capacity
under the Civil rights Attorney's Pees Awards Act of .1976«
The case before you today differs from Hutto in only
two respects, neither of which do we believe are material or
sufficiently different to justify a result different from that
in Hutto0
While the case in Hutto was settled on the merits,
this case was resolved by consent decree»

Constitution, in this case the plaintiff coupled her

The plaintiff maintains 'chat neither these differences

would be different from that in Hutto»

What was the first difference cited?
The first difference is the fact that

in Hutto the case was triad on the merits»

The Civil Rights Attorney's -—

MS. PILVERs
QUESTION;

Isn’t there still another difference»

In Hutto the constitutional claim was an Eighth Amendment
claim and here the constitutional claim is a Fourteenth Amend­
ment claim®

And in Hutto Mr. Justice Rehnquist -thought that

might be significant.

So maybe you have a response to his

position in this case.
MS. FILTER:

Well, if I understood Mr. Justice

Rehnquist’s position in Hutto, it was that because the Eighth
Amendment has been incorporated into the Fourteenth Amendment.
It is not as clear that in the past in acting pursuant to
section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment —

But you don’t have that obstacle-,that «■»•*
No, we don’t.
So in one sense your case is stronger

than the other.
MS, PILVER;
QUESTION;
MS, PILVER;

Yes, that is quite correct, Your Honor.
Yes.
That is true, this is.

The Civil Rights Attorney’s Fees Awards Act itself
sets only two criteria that must be met before an award of

24

fees can be made under the discretion of the judge„
One , it must be brought under one of the enumerated
s tatutes ®
And, two, the prevailing party, the person who is
seeking the fees must be the prevailing partyD
We believe that this case meets both criteria0

It

is clear that this case was brought under one of the enumerated
statutes, namely 42 UcSoC® 1983®

The: plaintiff alleged

constitutional claims which both courts below found to be
subs tanti a 1 under the relev«mt Hagans v» Lavine test, the
test which was also suggested by Congress to be used in these
kinds of instances®
The defendant, however, suggests that this case is
not properly brought under 42 U®S.C, 1983 because the plaintiff
coupled her constitutional claims .with statutory claims®
f

But this Court has yet to hold that a statutory
claim may net be properly brought under 42 U,S.Ca 19 83®

And

even if this Court were to so hold in a future case, it would
not be appropriate for decision here because in this case a
claim was properly brought under -the Constitution, thus brings
ing it within 42 U.S.C» 1983®
Additionally, it is very clear from the legislative
history that Congress had intended for awards to be made in
case.3 joining constitutional and statutory claims®

In -the

debate and report by Congress it indicated that they wished to

25
continue the practices and judicial standard that had been
established prior to the passage of the Pees Awards Act*,
including the coupling of constitutional and statutory claims»
Congress was well aware of the impact that a decision denying
fees in cases joining constitutional and statutory claims would
have, the fact that plaintiffs would be discouraged from
bringing cases if their rights to fees could so easily be
defeated, the fact that the inability to award fees in cases
joining constitutional and statutory claims might compel
judges to unnecessarily decide constitutional questionse thus
defeating a very important policy of this Court»
Alternatively, the prospect arises that a plaintiff
who believes he has a meritorious statutory claim might refrain
from raising it, in the fear that if he were to prevail on the
statutory claim he would then be denied fees»

This possibility

alone would have a very negative impact on the judicial system»
The plaintiff thus maintains -that Congress' purpose
in passing the Fees Act to encourage the filing of meritorious
litigation and the

under the Fourteenth Amendment — and

the important goals and judicial economy, judicial efficiency
and the appropriate adjudication of constitutional questions
would all be disturbed if this Court were not to allow fees
\

in cases joining constitutional and statutory claims»
Thus the plaintiff believes she meets the first
criteria set out in the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards

26

Acto
Additionally, she believes that she meets the second
criteria,namely that she is the prevailing party,,
Both courts below believe that the plaintiff had
achieved almost all that she had sought in her complaint and
that what she had achieved was significant®
The Court of Appeals in reviewing the case below
concluded that the defendant changed his policies reluctantly
and only under the pressure of this suit®
It is vitally important that plaintiffs who settle
be treated as prevailing parties for the purposes of the Act®
A large percentage of cases that are filed are settled and
as an option often thought of and certainly always considered byparties and it would be unfair to deny that option to parties
solely for them to be able to insure themselves of a fee
award.
Truly, not allowing fees in cases resolved by consent
decree ’would discourage the voluntary settlement of disputes9
for as the Court of Appeals suggested it would otherwise require
partj.es to litigate solely to insure fee award®
QUESTION*

Ms® Pliver, do you make anything at all of

the first paragraph in the consent decree saying nothing in
this consent decree is intended to constitute an admission of
fault by either party to this action?
MS® PILVERj

No, I don't, Your Honor®

That is some-

27
thing that was agreed to solely for us, for the parties to
negotiate the settlement®

And I would point out neither did

the plaintiff agree that she was withdrawing any of the
allegations contained in her complaint,,
QUESTION?

Well, the defendant hadn’t accused her of

any fault*,
MS. PILVERs
QUESTIONs

I am sorry, Your Honor®
The defendant hadn’t accused her of any

fault, had they?
MS® PILVERs

No, hut the plaintiff did make allegations

in the complaint which, you know, we certainly maintained to the
States that if the matter had gone to trial that we would have
prevailed®
QUESTIONS

You regarded this as just kind of boiler­

plate that you stuck in the request of the defendants?
MSo PILVERs
QUESTION:

That is correct, Your Honor®
Well, isn't it agreed that boiler plate -»

have you aver seen a stipulation of this kind, to a consent decree
that doesn't have it in?
113* PILVER:

That is right, I haven’t®

QUESTIONi You will settle that the rule admit
nothing?
MS, PILVER;

That is right, Your Honor®

always done in almost every case that I have ever
ever dealt with.®

That is
I have

28

Furtherf as I mentioned before, we feel that not
allowing fees except in the context of a consent decree could
create a potential for conflicts of interest which, you know,
s have mentioned and which I think is something that, should be
considered by this Courts
Again, the legislative history is clear3

It indicates

that Congress intended fees to be awarded in cases resolved by
consent judgment®
Neither wou'ld permitting an award of fees in cases
resolved by consent further the filing of nuisance litigation,
which is certainly of concern to the Court, because it is
clear the Court must first find that -there is at least a
substantial constitutional claim warranting jurisdiction®

They

must find that there were benefits brought about as a result
of toe settlement and that the benefits that resulted came
because of the plaintiff's conduct and would not otherwise
have occurred, you know, regardless of the plaintiff’s actions®
All these are matters that the defendant remains free to contest
in any hearing on attorney's fees®
To require any greater showing would only discourage
settlement of disputes and discourage the benefits achieved by
settlement, the saving of court time and effort, the saving
of time, expanse and effort by the litigants, the parties and
the at to rney s *
To require a greater showing of the likelihood of

29
success on the merits would also require the unnecessary
decision of constitutional questions,,
Thus f in sum* the plaintiff believes she meets the
two primary criteria set out in the Fees Act for all.owing an
award of fees to be made in this case.
because, however, the defendant claims that he is
subject to an immunity under the Eleventh Amendment, he asserts
that even if we did prevail, even if we are entitled to fees
under these two criteria, we are nonetheless barred from an
award.
The plaintiff believes, however, as mentioned earlier
that Hutto v„ Finney is the appropriate precedent for deciding
this question.

The validity of this Court's ruling that in

passing the Fees Act Congress was exercising power under section
5 of the Fourteenth Amendment has no l-ass validity in a. case
resolved by consent than in any other.
The legislative history relied upon by this Court
in Hutto to come to the conclusion that States were intended
to be covered by the Act in ‘this case only but to further by
the additional legislative history indicating that these were
also intended tobbe awarded in cases resolved by consent.
Certainly the comparison of fees to cost in Hutto
c

and the quotation from Fairmont Creamery Company v. Minnesota
that a court interest in expeditious and orderly proceedings
justifies it in treating a State as any other litigant has no

30

less validity in a case resolved by consent»
Additionally,, although not explicitly stated? the
plaintiff believes that the Court in Hutto implied strongly that
attorney's fees? being so closely akin to cost? that like cost
they should not be subject to a State's Eleventh Amendment
immunity»
We believe that a holding by this Court tc that
effect here would follow logically from this Court's holding
in Hutto and would not *—» would not strain the distinction drawn
by the Court in Edelman v» «Jordan between prospective relief
and the cost ancillary thereto and retroactively? which is akin
to damages and barred by the Eleventh Amendment»
But even if this Court were to hold that attorney's

fees are generally subject to the Eleventh. Amendment we believe
that Congress is acting appropriately under section 5 of the
Fourteenth Amendment in passing legislation allowing fees to be
awarded in cases resolved by consent»
Through extensive hearings Congress was well aware .
that many parties could not have afford the legal fees involved
in bringing action under laws passed pursuant to the Fourteenth
Amendment.

And Congress reasonably concluded that shifting the

attorney5s fee to the losing party was a reasonable way of
resolving

* of encouraging such litigation»
Likewise? Congress was acting reasonably in concluding

that an award of fees in consent judgment cases also furthered

31

that policye
Congress has acted remedially in giving another tool
of use to the Judiciary to use for the process of encouraging
the filing of litigation under the Fourteenth Amendment and
title tool i3 as useful in consent judgment cases as in any
other»
Further, the Act leaves the ultimate decision as to
whether to award fees to the discretion of the judge, leaving
it to him to decide as here whether there was a substantial
constitutional claim justifying a finding of jurisdiction,
whether the benefits achieved were valuable and whether they
came as a result of the suit having been brought»
Thus, Congress, even in settle cases, has left the
determination and the interpretation of the substantive guarantees
of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Judiciary, where it right**
fully belongs.

Thus, the plaintiff below and respondent here

believe that the award of fees made by the District Court and
affirmed by the Court of Appeals was proper- under the Civil
Rights Attorney’s Fees Act and follows logically from, and is
consistent with this Court9 holding in Hutto v® Finneye
Thank you ver/ much®
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

Very well.

Do you have anything further, Mr» Walsh?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY EDMUND C. WALSH, ESQ®,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

32
HR» WALSHs

Mr» Chief Justice,, and may it please the

Courts
I have just a couple of points»
In Hutto v» Finney this Court stated that attorney6s
fees may be awarded as part of the costs and the Eleventh
Amendment would not seem to be a bar there»

I would respect*»

fully submit that I don’t think that the legislative history
warranted that conclusion.

At least, even if it did in this

case, if it is true that the plaintiffs were not seeding to
enforce a Fourteenth Amendment guarantee and there i.s no
congressi on si authorisation,, even if the Congress has the power
to give such authorization under the Fees Awards Act, this
Court distinguished Hutto —
QUESTION*

Well, can 1 interrupt you on the question

of whether the legislative history supports the notion that
fees might be awarded as part of the cost»

I think the statute

itself,which you quote on pages 3 and 4 of your brief, ends up
by saying that a reasonable attorney’s fee as part of the
costs.
Doesn’t that kind of imply -that it is supposed to be
part of the costs?
MR» WALSH:

Yes, Your Honor, but is it part of the

cost where the Eleventh Amendment is not an issue.

We see

the Fees Act, the purpose of the Act and the policy of tbs Act
all indicated that they were not enacting any startling new

33

legislation,, it was just to fill gaps created by the Alyeska
decision»
Now, actually the costs have not been changed since
I think the Judiciary Act of 1853 and so if that was their
intention, I think that would have been more than just no
startling new remedy legislation and just to fill in the gaps»
But in a case where civil rights are not being enforced there
is no author:»zation, I think, in the legislative history
specifically to abrogate that amendment in a non-civil rights
case.

Congress doesn’t claim such a policy»

It may have such

pwer, but it doesn’t claim it in this Act»
I want to make one other point and that is that
Huttc itself distinguished Fitzpatrick from Edelman and it said
Fitzpatrick begins where Edelman ends»
similar to Edelman»

But this case is very

There was a constitutional claim in

■Edelman of equal protection and there was statutory social
security claim.
So I think it would be fair to say that Edelman
controls this case and that this case ends where Edelman ended»
And Fitzpatrick began where there was a threshold question of
congressional authorisation, which isn’t present here»
I would just like to make one other remark to Mr»
Justice Marshall’s earlier question.

My point was that

Chapman says there is no jurisdiction under u»S» Code 1343
or 1344

to hear a case in which there is just statutory

34
claim,,

And so it may well be that in this case we have what

Mr, Justice Marshall pointed out in his dissent in the decision

©£ Employees„ a constitutional claim which the Federal District
Court does not have jurisdiction over because Congress has not
given, only implemented its Article 3 power to award that
jurisdiction,
Uifch respect to Mr, Justice Blackmun8 s remarks about
being a customary provision, a boiler plate,, if you willff we
would just point out that there was only one single plaintiff
throughout the entire more than two years of litigation in this
case and tlx at the plaintiff in the consent decree did not obtain
the injunctive relief which he sought? she did not obtain the
equivalent of the injunctive relief she soughtf because the
State did not change its amended policyP it is still in
effect.

That is the one contained in the appendix at paragraph

— pages 68 and 69,

r

■

So we think that Edelman v, Jordan should be
controlling in this case because it is so similar to Edelman v,
Jordan,

And for that reason, we ask that the Court reverse the

decision.
Thank you very much,
MB, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

f
The case is- submitted.

Thank you, gentleman,
