PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
ments In Trammel v. United States.

We will resume argu­
At this stage, Mr.

Wiggins, are you reserving the re3t of your time for
rebuttal?
MR. WIGGINS:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, I am,

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Solicitor General.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WADE H. McCREE, JR., ESQ.s
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR, MeCREE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
There is no dispute about the facts in this case
and we concede essentially that if this Court adheres to
its ruling in Hawkins, the judgment below must be reversed
because without the spouse’s testimony there is nothing in
the record to link the petitioner to the conspiracy charp^e.
I qualified my concession with the word "essen­
tially” because the Court could decline to hold that the
privilege against adverse spouse testimony does not apply
where the witness spouse Is willing to testify and it could
still admit her testimony here for the reasons that she
and petitioner were joint participants in the conspiracy
to import heroin as charged in the indictment.
This argument about their being joint conspirators
was not presented to the court in Hawkins, nor was it

25
considered by the Court in its opinion.
We also observe at the outset that the opinion
In Hawkins does not foreclose our request that the Court
reconsider it, because although the Court said "under
these circumstances we are unable to subscribe to the idea
that an exclusionary rule based on the persistent instincts
of several centuries should now be abandoned, nevertheless,"
it stated, "as we have already indicated, however, this
decision does not foreclose whatever changes in the rule
may eventually be dictated by reason and experience."
QUESTION:

How much does the voluntariness aspect

figure in your exception to the Hawkins rule that you just
suggested?
MR. MeCREE:

Well, that is our principal argu­

ment and I —
QUESTION:

How voluntary is it when once she is
j

offered or tendered immunity?
MR. McCRES:

If the Court please, no one’s choice

is ever absolutely voluntary.

Everyone makes a choice,

whenever he does, within the context of a series of circum­
stances and we have to begin with the premise that she was
already involved in the offense and therefore her selection
of choices was necessarily limited.
QUESTION:

Let's take it just step by step.

pose they had not consulted her in advance.

Sup­

She had refused

26
to talk with the prosecution or investigators;, she is
called to the stand when the case is in trial, she could
assert the Fifth Amendment, could she not at that stage
in this ease?
MRo McCREE:

She indeed could assert the Fifth

Amendment.
QUESTION:

And then if that were countered at

that stage, rather than in advance as it was here, with a
tender of complete immunity, then what would be her posture?
MR, McCREE:

Well, she could still as we suggest

claim the privilege as the witness

spouse not to testify.

She could claim it on the basis of preserving marital
harmony.

And we do not ask the Court to overturn that, we

just say that the privilege should continue but the
privilege should be exercised by the witness

spouse

instead of the defendant spouse, because she is the one
more likely by her decision to indicate whether there is
anything worth saving.

We suggest that by placing the

privilege in the defendant spouse, he will invariably pre­
vent the witness spouse from testifying, not because of a
desire to save the marital harmony but to save his own
hide in the prosecution.

So we are suggesting that her

decision 13 a reliable indicator of the existence of a
marriage whose harmony and felicity should, be protected,
but to place it with him doesn*t serve the underlying

27
purpose of the privilege.

That essentially is our argu­

ment about the rule enunciated in Hawkins.

We say don’t

destroy the privilege but give it to the witness spouse
instead of the defendant spouse.
As we suggested In our brief — and I won't
dwell on this at any great length — actually there are two
related rules and we are only talking about one of them,
and I would like to make that clear.
As the concurring opinion in Hawkins states,
there was originally only one rule and it stemmed from two
concepts both long sine® rejected. One was the rule that a
party, an interested party could not testify in a lawsuit,
and the other was the fiction that at law husband and wife
were one and, as some persons have said, he was it.

And

since he could not testify in his own behalf, he could
prevent his subordinate alter-ego or his subordinate alterego also was incompetent to testify in his behalf.

But

after the law evolved to permit interested parties to
testify, two rules evolved from this earlier one.

One Is

the rule that prevents either spouse from testifying
against the other, and that is the rule that Hswkins »—
with which Hawkins was concerned, and the other rule, of
course, is a rule relating to confidential communications,
and neither spouse can be required to reveal a confidential
communication and each spouse has a right to prevent the

28
other from doing its and that rule even survives the demise
of a marriage9 and we are not talking about that at all
here.

We are talking —
QUESTION:

You are not challenging that?

MR. McCREE:

We are not challenging that at all.

And we point out, Mr,, Justice Rehnquist, that in Trammel,

„

in the court below

the court very carefully made this

distinction between these two rules* and we are talking
about what is sometimes called the anti-marital rule* al­
though the reason for that nomenclature rather escapes me*
it is the rule that permits either or both spouses from
preventing the other from testifying against him as to
matters not confidential communications.

And it is our

submission that this rule should not permit the defendant
spouse to exercise it but should permit the witness spouse
to exercise it.
We begin in our argument by pointing out that
the public has a right to every person’s evidence.

This

Court has frequently enunciated that rule and* as has been
observed* whenever the public will be deprived of relevant
evidencei; there should be an overriding consideration to
compel such an exception to this general rule.

And we

suggest that there may be, with reference to confidential
communications between spouses, we don’t touch that at all.
But we suggest that if the price would be that an offense

29
would not be proved without violating any effort to be
confidential between the spouses» that that is too great a
price to pay*
QUESTION:

Mr. Solicitor General» putting aside

the confidential-communication» would not the logic of
your argument equally apply to a claim of privilege by the
witness as well as by the defendant?

I’m just wondering

If you are writing on a clean slate» wouldn’t you ask the
Court to abolish the privilege entirely except for the
confidential aspects?
MR. McCREE:
states have.

Well» I think I would and many

As a matter of fact» the mandate of Rule 501

of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedures is that the
privileges should be based upon principles of the common
law as interpreted by the United States courts in the
light of experience and reason.
I would address first the question of experience.
The experience of this country indicates the following:
In 1958» when Hawkins was decided,as the concurring opinion
states, there were 19 states that permitted inter-spousal
testimony.

Now that number has increased to 2? states,

including the District of Columbia, which incidentally did
not change but had the rule then.

Now, a clear majority

of the states have no rule that would prevent the Hawkins
result, and we think that this tells us something about

30
the experience of the country because these 27 states and
the District include some very populous states like New
York, Illinois* California, Ohio, and in their totality
they include 60 percent of all the population.

And if

this is their experience, we think this Court could con­
sider It, particularly in the light of the fact that this
Court has regarded matters pertaining to the family and to
domestic matters as peculiarly within the concern of the
states under an appropriate approach to federalism.
So we think on experience there is a reason to
reexamine Hawkins, and we think on the basis of reason there
is, as I have suggesteds if we want to see whether there
is a marriage worth saving, find out whether the witness
spouse is willing to testify.

If it is a good marriage,

she is not going to want to testify.

If it is just a sham,

if it is a shell, if It is ;Ju3t a nominal marriage, she is
likely to do it.

But the defendant spouse always will.

QUESTION:

In these 27 states, Mr. Solicitor

General, has the rule been altered with respect to both
civil and criminal eases or are they
MR. McCREE:

1 have not examined all of them

that carefully and I can’t answer the Chief Justice's
question.

We set them forth in the appendix to our brief

and some of them relate to civil and others to criminal,
but almost invariably they relate to criminal and that is

31
what we are talking about in Hawkins and for that reason
1 did not pursue it to determine it to that extent.
It is interesting to observe that the District
of Columbia has had a rule that allowed a witness spouse
to testify against a defendant spouse in a criminal case
for more than half a century, and I think that is signifi­
cant because the Congress has approved the District of
Columbia rule.
QUESTION:

Well, it would be kind of tough to

conduct a contested divorce proceeding if you had this
sort of a privilege
MR. McCREE:

in civil litigation,
That's exactly right, Mr, Justice

Rehqnsuit , and there are exceptions to the inter-spousal
rule that have developed out of common sense reasons, just
like the divorce one.

Others are if the defendant spouse

is accused of an offense, a criminal offense against the
witness spouse —
QUESTION:
MR. McCREE:

/
Right.
~~ obviously the witness spouse can

testify there or else the defendant spouse could inflict
criminal injury on her in private and, enjoy complete im­
munity.

It has been extended to allow the witness spouse

to testify when the defendant spouse is charged with an
offense against children of the marriage.

In fact, some

rules go as far as children of the other spouse even if

32
they are not children of the marriage.

Other exceptions

extend to offenses by the defendant spouse against property
of

separate property of the witness spouse, and we

suggest that if these exceptions are valid, and we think
they are — we think they serve a societal purpose — it
also serves a societal purpose to permit the witness
spouse to decide whether she will testify against the de­
fendant spouse when the public is in dire need of her
testimony.

Because here a major drug trafficker is going

to go free if we adhere to the rule of Hawkins# without
it serving any purpose of promoting marital harmony here.
QUESTION:

Mr. Solicitor General, what bothers

me about your argument is that it is almost precisely the
same argument that was made in the Hawkins case, which was
argued in my very first week on this Court.

While# aa you

know, I wrote separately, I didn’t agree with the Court in
the Hawkins case# eight members of the Court applying their
reason did reach the result that they reached.

And all

that you have pointed out to us that has happened since
in the 21 years since then is that some eight more states
have amended.their evidentiary laws.
MR. MeCREE:
QUESTION:

Well, we think that is —
There was certain reason, there was

reason of eight members of the Court in 1958 that the
Hawkins rule was the right rule.

33
MR. McCREE:

Well, we think that is significant

because — and as Rule 501 mandates and as the Court ob­
served in Hawkins before Rule 501

,

that these privileges

evolved in the light of experience and reason, and we
think that the fact that eight more states have moved is
significant experience.
QUESTION:

That is some experience, from 19 to

27.
MR. McCREE; Well, we think that —
QUESTION:

But what has changed in the way of

reason?
MR. McCREE:
QUESTION:

Well, we think —
Now, as you know, I didn’t agree with

the Court# but eight members were of the same view and
that was the exercise of their reasoning.

What has

changed it since?
MR. McCREE:

Well, this case is different in

another respect, too, and maybe we don't have to overrule
Hawkins if this Court would decide that where both spouses
were engaged in a joint criminal activity that the interest
of society in having the testimony of the witness spouse
should override any consideration of marital harmony.
QUESTION:

That was the ground on which the Court

of Appeals based its decision, isn’t it?
MR. McCREE:

It is, sir

3-4
QUESTION:

I take it that there wouldn’t be any

privilege by either spouse.
MR. McCREE:

No, we don’t even ask the Court to

go that far.
QUESTION:

I know* but that reasoning you .just

gave would mean that the public would be able to overrule
the objection of the witness spouse.
MR. McCREE;

We welcome the Court, If It wished

to take that step, but we say the Court doesn't have to
take that much of a step.

If it leaves the privilege in

the witness spouse, that is sufficient to uphold this and
it is still
QUESTION:

It denies the public her testimony

If she objects.
MR. McCREE:

But what the public would gain

would be the preservation of marital harmony if she be­
lieved that it would be jeopardised by her testimony.

We

suggest that her willingness or not to testify would be
an indicator of whether there was anything there worth
saving.
QUESTION:

Mr, Solicitor General, insofar as

your position involves any change in the Hawkins rule, is
there any limitation on our changing it under 2076?
MR. McCREE:
ing it.

We see no limitation on your chang­

My brother yesterday was addressing Title 28,

35
section ■»«* wellg we refer5 to it in a footnote on page 10 of
our brief»
QUESTION:

2076.

MR. McCREE;

20??.

But that relates only to

this Court and specifically relates to this Court in its
rulemaking function and not its adjudicatory function, and
we are here In the latter capacity and not the former.
QUESTION:

Then you are saying that conferred no

new power or jurisdiction on us that we didn’t have before.
MR. McCREE:

That’s my understanding, and it

doesn’t inhibit, it doesn’t prevent the Court at this time
from —
QUESTION:

Well, what you are really saying is

that 20?6 is no limitation whatever on our changing the
Hawkins rule, inclusive of overruling it.
MR. McCREE:

That’s exactly rights unless the

Court presumed to do it in its rulemaking capacity„
QUESTION:

And you find that in that last sen­

tence in the word "such/* any such amendment?
MR. McCREE:

No, I find that in the language

that speaks of the Court in its rulemaking power.
QUESTION:

Yes?

MR. McCREE:
QUESTION:

(no response)
The subject of 2076 is amendments to

the Federal Rules of ~~

36
MR* McCREE:

That is my understanding, Mr.

Justice Brennan,
QUESTION;

So when you get down to any such amend­

ment creating, and so forth, that means any such amendment
to the Federal Rules of Evidence.
MR. McCREE::

And that would be in the exercise

of its rulemaking power.
QUESTION:

Does this ease require us to decide

any more than that there is no privilege when the wife
admittedly is engaged in the same criminal enterprise?
MR. McCREE:

We are saying that when — we are

not saying that there is no privilege.

We are saying that

the Court can allow the privilege to remain but just permit
her to exercise the privilege.

That Is one thing we are

saying.
The other is we are saying you can abolish the
privilege when she is jointly charged with the offense.
And under either formulation, the conviction of Trammel
below would stand.
QUESTION:

Well, in this case she 1 take it ad­

mitted her participation but was protected by the immunity.
MR. McCREE:

That’s correct, and she was charged

or she was named in the indictment as an unindicted coconspirator.

And we are suggesting that logically to do

otherwise would permit a person bent on a criminal

37
enterprise to enlist the services of his wife in that
enterprise with the full knowledge that she could never
be used as a witness against hlms and we are suggesting
that that is not socially desirable and that certainly if
that is a consequence, It isn't a reason for overruling
the general principle that the public is entitled to every
person'3 testimony or evidence.

But that could indeed be

the consequence of overturning this conviction of Trammel.
He could enlist her as indeed he did and she did all of
the actual obtaining of the heroin in the Southeast Pacific,
bringing it into the country, while he would remain Immune
Just because this rule in Hawkins would prevent it if we
listen to petitioner's contention, and we submit that we
should not.
QUESTION:

Don't you think that there Is a pos­

sibility that if the Court should overrule the Hawkins
rule to the broad extent that you urge this morning, that
there might be a claim in every case and therefore the
necessity of a judicial Inquiry into just how voluntary the
wife's testimony was?

I remember the Hawkins case, the

wife had been jailed and released on $3f.GOO bond, as I
remember it, conditioned upon her testifying in court
against her husband, and that didn't seem very voluntary.
In this case, she was granted immunity and that
arguably doesn't seem very voluntary.

Don't you think

38
that this would lead to an inquiry, the claim being made
and therefor® a necessary inquiry in every case as to
just was it or was it not voluntary testimony?
MR. McCREE:

If the contention were made, it

would, 1 must concede, Mr. Justice Stewart, that it would.
QUESTION:

Well, don't you think every convicted

defendant would make that contention?
MR. MoCREBs

Well, he probably would, but

similar contentions are made In similar Instances.

For

example, this Court has said many times that the testimony
of a co-conspirator made during th© course of the: conspiracy
and in furtherance of its objects may b© used against any
'

\

.i

'Y

'

other conspirator9 but this requires the preliminary showj.ng of some quantum of proof before that comes in.
In the exception to th® attorney-client privilege,
;4

.

•('

• ... 1-:i•
;

•

’

'.

sne of the exceptions is if the person consults an .attorney
and enlists him in: the commission of an offense, no
privilege exists there and there, too, some quantum of
showing that they ware both involved in the criminal
activity would be necessary before you could penetrate the
attorney-client privilege.

So it isn’t anything new to the

law, but it is something that courts can handle and do
handle competently.
There was a so-called in limine act hearing
here to determine voluntariness and this happens in a.

39
number of instances, and if it happened here it wouldn't
differentiate this at all.
QUESTION:

Your exception, your narrow exception

would not cover a case where the wife — if this wife had
been aware of the criminal conduct of the husband and had
constantly protested against his activity and had not par­
ticipated in it, then your exception would not permit her
to testify, would It?
MR, McCREE:

The second branch of my exception

would not, and that is why we urge the first, that she
should be the holder of the privilege, and if she felt that
there wasn't anything worth saving we could expect her to
be willing to testify.

If she felt there was something

worth saving, she wouldn't, and
QUESTION:

The second

oq@

would also prohibit

her testimony if she saw her husband murder anotharperson,
if there were only the three of them including the victim
present.

‘

*

MR, McCREEs

It would, and that is why we sug­

gest —
QUESTION:
MR. McCREE:

The broader one?
— the broader one., and we think

society doesn't benefit by preserving a marriage at this
extreme cost,
QUESTION:

But your voluntariness factor element

40
doe3» as Mr. Justice Stewart suggested, put the court into
a subsidiary or a collateral inquiry?
MR. McCREE:

Well, we concede it but the courts

are in these collateral inquiries all the time where
predicates for the operation of a rule have to be shoim
and different quant of evidence are required frequently to
trigger it.
1 would also like to observe that the rule in

Hawkins would penalise Mrs. Trammel because she is married
and that is an unfortunate result.

There is another* woman

involved in this case who was the girlfriend

in fact,

at one point she was referred to as the roommate of
another defendant, and she was able to bargain for her
liberty with the prosecution and she was not -«• she 'was
named as an unindicted co-sponsorator and. she was not
prosecuted at all,

Mrs. Trammel would be penalised be­

cause she had gone through the bonds of matrimony with
Trammel and this other woman who was just living with the
other fellow would not be,
QUESTION:

She would be penalised because she

could offer no quid pro quo in the negotiations?
MR. McCREE:

To the prosecutor.

She couldn’t

bargain for her personal freedom.
QUESTION:
MR. McCREE:

1 see.
So for these several reasons, as we

set forth in our brief, we respectfully request that the
Court reconsider Hawkins and hold that the admission of
Mrs. Trammel’s testimony was not erroneous and affirm the
conviction.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Wiggins.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. TERRY WIGGINS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER — REBUTTAL
MR. WIGGINS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court «—
QUESTION:

How do you — I suppose there are

several ways, but how would you characterise the reason
basis for the exception of permitting a wife to testify
against her husband in a divorce action, whether she is
the plaintiff or whether he is the plaintiff and she is
resisting the- -divorce?

Would that be on the theory that

at that stage In the court room the marriage is shattered
already?
MR. WIGGINS:

I certainly think it would and it

would be — it is a practical reaction to the fact that a
divorce could not otherwise in most situations be accomp­
lished because you are talking about a matter that is
solely within the interest of the two parties who are being
divorced and -QUESTIONS:

Assume divorces are granted, and a

many of tiiem are granted without the testimony of the
spouse, if there is objective evidence from other people.
MR. WIGGINS:
I am unfamiliar with it.
QUESTION:

If that is true, Mr. Chief Justice,
In Colorado, it could not happen.

Well, there is a general exception to

the rule, isn*t there, that a spouse may always testify as
to wrongdoing by the other spouse against him or her?
MR, WIGGINS: That, Mr. Justice Stewart, is the
general exception.
QUESTION:

But you put that on the basis and the

rule rests on the basis that that kind of a marriage is
pretty well shattered.

When this wife took the stand in

the criminal case to testify against her husband, is that
marriage any less shattered?
MR, WIGGINS:

By the time that she elected to

take the stand in this case to protect herself, I think
it is no less shattered,

I think in this ease it might

easily be said that the marriage were shattered by her
choice.

It could have had problems prior to that time,

but certainly once she took the witness stand, the marriage
I would think would have been ruined.

But the question is

whether the government should have the opportunity, it seems
to me, to try to convince her to destroy the marriage by
taking the witness stand so that merely for her own protec­
tion the government argues in their brief about the fact

that they feel a defendant in almost every case for his
own self interest would claim the privilege, and I wouldn’t
deny that argument.

But by the same token, Mrs. Trammel

in her own self interest, to keep herself out of Jail,
elected to speak about activities between her husband and
anyone else, including everyone involved in this.
I would point out that the co-conspirator excep­
tion that the government argues for has a glaring problem
in this case that can be seen from the record, and that is
how simple it is to accuse someone as an unindicted co­
conspirator without actually them having any great involve­
ment in the case.

I’m not speaking of Elisabeth Trammel.

I am speaking of Ben Richardson, Jr. and Josephine
Fiewellsn.

If you look at the recos^d in this case, you

will find that both of those persons were named ah unin■ i

dieted co-conspirators.

Ben Richardson, Jr. did no more

than drive Mr. Roberts to the airport, not knowing his
reason for going and not knowing what was going to happen
when he arrived.

Josephine FIewelien did no more than

rida in an automobile from the airport at Clark Air Force
Base in the Philippines to the airport so that Mrs. Trammel
could get on an airplane to come to the United States, and
yet both of those people were named as unindicted co­
conspirators simply to get in testimony that may have been
available and otherwise would have been unavailable

perhaps because of the rules of hearsay.

Mr. Richardson

testified at trials didn’t ask for immunity,, denied all
personal culpability in the case, but he was named as an
Indicted co»conspirator,
If the same circumstance had taken place whore
Mrs. Trammel was concerned and she had been permitted to go
on and testify simply because the government chose to in­
dict her or name her in the indictment, then the marriage
would equally have been destroyed but to no gain for anyone
because it would have been clear that she was not a part of
the conspiracy.

I*m not arguing that there was not a con­

spiracy in this case, there certainly was.
QUESTION:

But the government has to prove a co-

conspiracy, doesn’t it?

It can’t Just by naming someone

as an unindicted co-conspirator, without any proof get
their testimony.
MR. WIGGINS:

Mr. Justice Rehnquists X think if

the circumstance of getting a conviction, yes, the govern­
ment has to prove that the person is a co-conspirator, but
) :'-u

'•}

I think before a grand jury by placing the name of a person
in an indictment as an unindicted co-conspirator is a very
*

simple matter and I can’t conceive of a situation where an
assistant United States attorney could not draft an indict­
ment in such a way if he chose to do so.
QUESTION:

Or threaten to Indict her

MR, WIGGINS:

Or threaten to indict her or call

her an aider or abettor.

In the Lllley case out of the

Eighth Circuit* the husband and wife were called aiders
and abettors, under Title 18, section 2.

In that case,

both denied and laid It off on the other, but the Eighth
Circuit held that the rule prevented the testimony of one
against the other.
The Cameron case, that the government relies on
strongly, out of th© Fifth Circuit, a 1977 case, would if
this Court adopts what the government argues for, of
necessity should have been overruled because Mrs, Cameron
said 5,I don’t want to testify against ray husband, I’m not
Involved, I have no desire to testify," and the judge said,
”1 don’t think you have much of a marriage anyway, there­
fore you will testify.”
QUESTION:

Y®3, but I thought one proposal of

the government was that the privilege Just belonged to the
witness —
MR. WIGGINS:
QUESTION:

— whether a co-conspirator or not --

MR. WIGGINS:
QUESTION:

That is —

Yes, that is one of the —

— in which event In your Fifth Circuit

case there would have been no testimony.
MR. WIGGINS:

In the Cameron case there could

have been no testimony, that’s correct, Mr. Justice White.

QUESTION:

But the other proposal is that the

privilege is entirely absent if they are co-conspirators.
MR. WIGGINS:

That is what the government is

arguing for in their second —
QUESTION:

Do you understand their proposal in

that regard to mean that if the wife is a co-conspirator
and there is a prima facie showing of it, I suppose, as a
predicate to demanding her testimony, she could be made to
testify over her objection?
MR. WIGGINS:

That is what I understand their

position to be, Mr. Justice White.

I understand them to

talk about the implementation of that rule in terms of the
prosecutor making an offer of proof to the court, saying,
okay, she will testify to the following things.
QUESTION:

Just like you have to lay the predi­

cate for a lot of other testimony.
MR, WIGGINS:

Absolutely correct, and once the

offer of proof is made then the judge decides whether or
not the judges belie\res she is a co-conspirator.

If he

does, then her permits her to testify.
QUESTION:

I didn’t understand the government * a

position to be in either of its alternative arguments that
the spouse could be compelled to testify against her will.
Perhaps I misunderstood it,
MR. WIGGINS:

My understanding —

QUESTION:

The Solicitor General seemed to indi­

cate that maybe the court could stop short of that on the
one branch of their — but as I read their brief, it would
be to go all the way.

MR. WIGGINS:

As I read their brief, the witness

spouse would still have some choice and, as the Solicitor
General indicated in his argument in terms of the grant of
witness immunity, the privilege could still be claimed —
QUESTION:

As the spousal privilege,

MR. WIGGINS:

Yes — then that would Imply a

choice, but on page 28 of the government's brief they do
indicate that what they ar® suggesting is that if the
parties are co-conspirators then the government would make
an offer of proof to the court and when It does that, make
the offer of proof, if the judge decides that he believes
they are co-conspirators, then he would permit the wife to
testify,
QUESTION:

Not only permit but could require.

MR, WIGGINS:

I wouldn’t go quit© that far, but

it is —
QUESTION:

If immunity were granted?

MR. WIGGINS:

— it is argued, yes, that that is

true,
QUESTION:

If immunity were granted, he could

require under those facts.

QUESTION:

Not if there is

MR. WIGGINS:
QUESTION:

spousal privilege.

Mr. Chief Justice —

We are starting with the proposition

that Mr. Justice White put to you3 that she has the option.
Now, she exercises that option ordinarily at the risk that
she might later be indicted if she doesn’t cooperate with
the government.

Isn’t that one of your problems?

MR. WIGGINS:

Yes, that is one of my problems.

But I think, Mr. Chief Justice, the granting of witness
immunity — I think the Tenth Circuit confused the rights
of witness immunity and the privilege considerably because
witness immunity I had understood after the Kastlgar case
was a fairly settled matter.

And now to take witness

immunity and try to superimpose a husband-wife privilege
where the privilege has always been held not in the immu­
nized party but in the other person, both not only confuses
the privilege, the husband-wife privilege, but I think
confuses immunity, because the Solicitor General argues
that there are circumstances where a person could be
granted witness immunity and still claim the marital
privilege, at least the way the law has been to date.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 10:38 o'clock a.m.s the ease in
‘i;he above«.entitled matter tfas submitted,)
