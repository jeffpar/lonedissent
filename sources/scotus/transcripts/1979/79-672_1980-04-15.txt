MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear argument

next in 79-672, National Labor Relations Boar:'; v. Retail
Store Employees Union.
Mr. Come, you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF NORTON J. COME, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. COKE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This ease Is here on certiorari te the District
of Columbia Circuit which* sitting en banc anti dividing:
.|ive-to-fo’ura denied enforcement of the Board' s: order
against the union, a local of the Retail Clerks Interna­
tionale which the Board found had engaged in secondary
picketing in violation of section 8(b)(4)(iiv) of the
National Labor Relations Act.
This section makes it an unfair labor practice
for a labor or

Le itio i to threaten, coerce or restrain

ZM.r person for an object of forcing Mm to cease dealing
■■■■i

, products o" or otherwise to cease doing business

rff\ a.r-f- other* person.

A proviso to this section excepts

publicity other than picketing for the purpose of truth­
fully advising the public that the product or products
are produced by

i employer rich whom the union has a

primary dispute and are distributed by another- employer.

4
Tliij question of whether the picketing here
violates section 8(b){4)(iiv) turns on an application of
the principles enunciated by this Court in the Tree
Fruits decision in 1964.
QUESTIONi;

The relevant facts —

It turns on the basis of the

statute, doesn't it, and naturally the cases in this
Court interpret the statute, but the basic criteria is
the statutory language.
MR

CCMS;

That is correct except that in Tree

Fruits, as I will indicate, the Court did interpret that
language as applied to picketing of this general character'.
But at the bottom we dc get hack, to the inter prat at.ion of

fcha statute and that was what Tree Fruits attempted to do.
The nr.ion has is the certified bargaining repre­
sentative of certain employees of Safeco Title Insurance
Company, anti it called s. strike following an impasse in
negotiations, ever an initial contract.

In addition to

picketing Safeco*s office, striking employees also €•»*gaged in Picketing of five land title companies that sa-H
only Safeco title insurance policies;

hy

\

The signs earr-iael

pickets stated that Safeco is non-union and did

not have a contract with the union and the handbills
'1 ich ware distributed to the general public r«aguestad

that rasmbtrs of the public boycott Safeco insurance.
The union's activities at the lend title companies

did rsofc cause assy work stoppages or interference with
deliveries.
Mow, from 90 to S5 parcent cf the income of the
land title companies is derived from the issuance of
Safeco title insurance policies»

The remaining 5 to 10

percent comes from title research and escrow services.
Each land title company operates under an agency contract
with Safeco, under which Safeco underwrites all of its
title insurance and the land title company agrees not to
act as an agent for any other title insurance ccatpa-vy.
Safeco owns stock in all of the land title
companies; S3 percent in on© and amounts ranging fro® 18

to 38 percent in the other four.

The remaining stock is

• !d by various individuals.
An officer of Safeco serves as a member of the
heard of <2 iractors of each land title company, and

3f.rv& on the hoard of the company in which Safeco owns
S3 percent of the stock.

However, each land title com­

pany iadep««cent3y establishes its own wages, hours, and
other tent s end conditions of employment for its own em­
ploy e-as , and thee® is so interchange of employees between
the land title companies and Safeco.
Based «pest fche.se facts, the board concluded that
despite the Irud title companies5 economic dependence on
Safeco for bias underwriting of the title insurance, aach

6
land title company retained control over their ovm ' .afeor
relations policies and their day-torday operations, ant
therefore they were independent coapaaias and not allied
or part of Safeco.

The court of appeals sustained this

finding and the union does not challenge it her®.

So for

purposes of this case, the land title--compani-as are neutral
employers, for pur pcs as of Section 8(b)(4)(B) of the
statute.
The; board then considered the application of
Tree Fruits s- whera this court ruled that. Section 8(b)(4)
(iiv) permits a union tc engage in consumer picketing at
the* site of a secondary employer directed only at the
struck product, bat outlaws a union appeal at a seeaedary
site which has the effect of causing consumers not to

trade at all with the sacon&ary employer,

tod the board

with two Efcsrbars -lies nbisig concluded that although the
v.: ■ i

■ & aevccsidary site picketing was limited to Safeco*s
oitvted 8(b) (4) (iiv) because it was

reasonably calculated to indues cu sterners not to patronise
tha nautr&l title companies at all .
of their l/as;

Sine® virtually all

consisted of Safeco title insurance;

fcha picketing, if successful, wdbM necessarily result in
a total fccycott of th& title c :orapa»y * s bus inet? s.
Because of the provi.so to 8 (b) (4) (8) which I
alluded to mrlier, tb.e union's handling of the. title

7
companies was neither alleged nor found to be- a violation
of the statute»

The only thing that was interdicted was

the picket line in front of the title companies»
Now, we submit that the board *s application, of
Tree Fruits is a reasonable application of that — of the
principles articulated in that decision.
The union in Tree Fruits, as the court will re­
call;, picketed neutral Safeway stores to persuade Safeway's
customers to boycott Washington State apples, in support
of a dispute that the union had with the packers and dis­
tributers of those apples»

Rejecting the board5s ruling

that all such secondary picketing was violative of feh®
statute, the boari determined that in enacting Section
8 (b) (4) (iiv) , the court, had neant to 'outlaw peaceful con­
sumer picketing employed to persuade the customers of the
secondary employer — 1 can quoting from the court — "to
cease trading with them in order to force him to put pres­
sure upon the urinary employerr"

but ’that Congress did

act iJitxmd to outlaw picketing, which as in the case before
Va

only pers/aades the neutral customers not to buy the
'nek product „
The- court explained that when consumer picketing

is employed only be parsuade customers not to buy the
struck product, tin union* r. appeal is closely confined to
the priraary dispute.

But on the other hand, when consumer

8
picketing is employed to par suade customers not to trade at
all with the secondary ©r&ploryar, fch-a union doss» snore than
merely foliow the struck product, it areates a separate
dispute with the secondary employer*
Now, the facts of free Fruits permitted a clear
distinction between picketing limited to persuading custo­
mers not to buy the struck product and picketing aimed at
the secondary’s patronage! generally, because apples oc­
cupy bat a small portion of Safewayvs retail shelves, and
the union could urge Safeway*s customers to refrain from
t-v.ying tlife,..apples without asking that they cease trading
\\
with Safeway Altogether.
Here such a sharp distinction cann
cause although tie picketing is directed at the struck
product, that rrcinot constitutes virtually all the neu­
tral 8a business, and in these circumstances, the picketing
necessarily;, if successful, would result in a boycott of
%

the neutral*& total business.

And in that kind of a situ­

ation, on® interest must yield? either the union1 s in­
terest in mas-rimissing pressure on the primary, or tit© aaitral's interest is, avoiding a boycott of his total business.
And we submit that is the light of the legislahistory of the 151 5 amendments to the act, which is
s- l forth at length in the various opinions in Tre© Fruits,
tv.is history tfould show fcha desire on the part of Congress

9
to protect neutral employers froia -secondary picketing, at
least where it calls for a boycott of neutral * s total
business.
The board was not unreasonable in striking the
balance here in favor of the neutral employer.
QUESTICHs

Were these neutral employers?

MR. CO:El:

They me on the finding of the board

that was sustained by the court of appeals,
QUESTION

Ti;a fact, is, they were owned or par­

tially owned by the producer of the boycotted product.
weren't they?
MR. CGEiEs

That i & correct, but under the estab-

lished principles that ar@ applied with respect to datermining neutrality, you. look •:;t a number of factors.
1

The

rre: of common comar ship and control, degree of economic

in lord • parc.-yi..ce, also the degree of control ever labor
relations in the day to clay operations of the ssntity.

The

board found that looking at all of these factors, they
predominate in favor c-f the finding of neutrality, because
although there wts seme ccsmtm ownership and some repre­
sentation of sharing of directore, in terms of the actual
control over the labor relations, Safeco had no control over
that.

And that is the key —
QUESTIONS

Hr. Corns, could there possibly be a

difference between the branch which was 53 percent ownad

10
a:ad the other end. of the spectrum, 17 percent corned?

Tho

board did not consides: that, did it?
MR. COKE:

Th® board did consider that ona as

well as the others —
QUESTION :

But did it address itself to that

distinction?
MR. CO&E:

Yes, it. found that despite the fact

that there was mere owner-ship in that case, there w m
still no showing that there was any,, that that additional
amount of stock ownership had resulted in any greats in­
terference; or control by Safeco over She labor relations
policies of the land title* companies.

And therefore, in

terms of the finding of neutrality, Viere was no difference
because the essence of what <;.aks£ a neutral for 8

(4} in)

purposes is whether or not the neutral is powerless to

resolve the underlying dispat® with the primary, other
■ :: by ccusing to do business with the primary.

QOBSTIOK s

.What yon are saying is that th© title

company could'f Safeco could control -the five or sis 're •bailers, as it were, but th® retail era couldn't con txol
Safeco?
MR. COME:

That is corr-set.

11
Our second point is that if the board's interpre­
tation of the statute as applying to, as interdicting this
type picketing is upheld, we do not believe that as the
union urges, that a substantial constitutional problem is
presented.

The union has devoted a substantial portion of

its brief to this contention.
We believe that the constitutional phase of this
case was settled by this court many years ago in Hughes v.
Superior Chart, and which principles have been followed as
recently as several months ago in Babbitt v. Farm Workers.
She nub of '"the point is that, as we read the cases, it is
settled law that picketing is a «02© of communication that
is inseparably— that whiles picketiEg is a mode of ’icomami*"
cation, it's, inseparably societhimj mcr© and different.:

MR. COMB?

Well, .Gibcney —

QUESTION z

Th® ice company?

MR. COME:

That is the ie@ company.

Now, it is

argued here that Giboney is distinguishable bms&use ia
Gibem®y, the picketing sought an action which was itself
mad© unlawful aader a state law, namely it was the support
of an objective that would violate the state antitrust
laws.

It’s argued her® that the objective sought .by this

picketing ia not on lawful in that sense, because there‘--s
nothing

for a consumer £0 -boycott a titia c -.as ■

pany or a retail store for reasons of his cm, nor by

virtue :‘|f tho publicity proviso tb 3 (b.) C4) would it ite
unlawful f . a .a union by the publicity other than :pi<sk<
iiag to ;s<a<»K to induce such a boycott.
bo ... ftr.it, however, theigh, that Hughes lsfe>wir
at ;cu dora’t have to have an objective that is unlawful

it. that sense* for a state or the Federal Gcvenmmt to
-fv-iot its ©tfcaia&imit by a form of coercion such so- ia

13
represented by secondary picketing.

In the Laager case,

the court sustained the constitutionality of a ban on
picketing that, (iv) imposed against peaceful picketing
that induced employees, secondary employees, to strike in
furtherance of a secondary boycott objective.

The court

held that Congress in furtherance of its legitimate ob­
jective of avoiding interferences to interstate ooaraarce,
which are caused by bringing coercive pressures oa neu­
trals in labor disputes that they .are powerless to resolve,
go’iId restrict that form of seeondary picketing in fur­

therance of that legitimate govarsM-satal objective.
Similarly, we submit that. Congress could llke-

m proscribe secondary consuaer 'picketing, at least,
hr'c-i it calls for a total boycott ©f the neutral’s
business ir, Jurther&nc© of its objective of freeing neu-

tr"u s frmr thsss pressures.
f.sh ichxui, in the Far» Worh-arr v. Babbitt case,
in which this court, to be sure# wao interpreting, was
considering the s take s-tatute, the Arizona fara labor
statute, and they had a publicity proviso there and thss
question

whether it was hae<Sistifcsitional, the court

ia setting' aside the lower ccorfc’s holding of tmcons&itufcicnslifcy indicated publicity stead, on a different footing
than picketing, that Hughes had recognised that picketing
was more than publicity, and that it wsmld certainly be

i*

14
constitutional to prescriba picketing that would cut off
tli® entire business of a neutral ««player.
QUESTICMs

Mr* Corns,

We understand th© stataa-sat of

Well, there are several justifica­

First of all, in Gibca&y, the union was seeking

two unlawful objects*

It was a crime under the law of fell©

state, under the law of Missouri, for the picketed -saployesr
to refuse to deal, to join a concerted boycott.

In add!*-

But. that just makers the tail follow

The state in effect decides what is protect®!

and what isn't protected under the First Amendment;
MR. GOLD;

Well, I think that's always true.

It

sesms to me that the tail wags the dog if you don't begin
that way.

If this conduct isn't unlawful, to ask for con­

ci act would seen to b® protected by the First Amendment, for
us iifs difficult to understand what this First Amendment
is about.

Or the other hand,- th® First Amendment doesn't

protect me if I threaten to punch somebody in the nose car
invite aesaafeedy to engage ir.: the crime of ®ird«r, and that
has been understood ever;,

sine® Fck v. Washington.

Thar®

is a class of verbal acts which are unlawful.
But :lt is a very strang® First Amendment, I would
suggest to you, that bars a request to a member of the
general public to do something which under state law he
has every right to do.

21

Ani! indeed, as 1 intend to argue, undor Virginia
Pharmacy Board and cases like Linmark, the First teadraeat
has fossa recognised to protect the right of individuals to
truthfully state a fact which is relevant to a buying de­
cision, price or the fact -that it was made under struck
conditions, at least so long as the recipient of that mes­
sage, the consumer, is frev to take it into account or not,
and we don't understand how it could b© otherwise-

We

don't understand how there could b® a rational distinction
in terms of the right of fch* unicus to stata such a mes­
sage, and the right of pharmacists to state the pries at
which they soil goodsQGBSTIGNr

You say her© all the pickets were sta­

MR. GOLDS

Yes.

To return, if I could,, to the statutory argument,
which as Mr. Justice Ms it® has pointed out is far narrower
than the constitutional argument that we make, the court
at 377 US 72t which as I notad is set out at pages IS and*

17 of our brief, not only stated that picketing carried
out at the-'* pick sting aimed at. the secondary’s patronage*
generally is unlawful, but also stated what it meant by
that term.

We think that 'that’s an unfair reading

Where do w® find, Mr. Gold, the lan­

guage that the customers are not very analytical when they
see the picket sign to decide whether you5re picketing a
particular brand of oleomargarine or apple®, or whether
they're just picketing, picketing generally?

QDESTXOM:

Well, when you’re dealing with the

Catholic bishop'& casa, for oseaaple, you're Sealing with
what is or is not in fcha statute, not with the nuances
and shad lugs of the language in the statute.
MR. GOLD;

Well, but, that is precisely w/ese. we

are dealing with here.

In Yeshiva we were dealing with

the nuances of the term "managerial employees” that doesn’t
even appear in the statute, and the brunt of the' opinion,
as I understand it, was that the court having treated wi ch
that issue ir. prior cases, the board had an obligation to
follow with deference and with respect what the court has
said,
We believe quite clearly that the board, hasn’t
fulfilled that most central function to an orderly system
of Federal statutory interpretation and elaboration.As X say, my first reason, our first reason for
that is the fact that the board has given no reference to
the content in which the critical phrases were utscS la
:• a opinion snd has ignored absolutely the ©sample we set
• >•

bln wort's opinion on page 17 of our brief, which
v v:

i :?>u;its in tout absolutely lucid.
I:? addition', I would like to point out. on this

pert ion of the cast that the board lias 'indeed adept ad
the vary •'iheory of the ftre-s Fruits court of appeals re­
jected in this court,

The court of appeals in that oasa

said that the board was wrong, but said also that the

21
casa should be remanded to determine economic impact, poa-sibla economic impact, on Safeway.
The heart of the board’s theory here and its
leading case is that Tree Fruits rests cn the minimal im­
pact of the picketing on Safeway, as compared to the pre­
dictable economic effect of the picketing here which would
cause the agendas to abandon the primary in favor ;f a ;;.rv
source of supply.

That is precisely the test wa would sug­

gest that was rejected in Tree Fruits»
I would — I have ten minutes left — I would
like to discuss both the constitutional arguments that wa
make.

Interer tingly enough, Justice Black concurred in
Tree Fruits on the ground not of statutory interpretation,,
but that.,, and quoting frrda Ids opinion &.c set cut at page

QUESTIONi

Could I ask you a question?

You distinguished the Hughes casa in your brief
by quoting at scare length from Professor Costs article,
and h© in turn draws tha distinction between pick-sting
backed by the threat of economic sanctions and picketing
which appeals only to reason.

In this case, I guess there

were no, there was no interference with delivery involved.
Now, had you had a situation ir« which, although your mes­
sage was precisely the same, the Teamsters cut off delivery
because they'd have to cross a picket lire.

Would that be

a different ease, c-r would it be the saias case?

We

think that's an entirely wrong and terribly dangerous

31
idea.
QUESTIONS

Well, I wonder if the Hughes case isn't,

pretty close to that?

MR. GOIOs

Well, the Hughes ease can be read as

being close to that.

It may be a case in which there was

a» unlawful ultimat® object.

You can read the California

cases different ways.
QUI2STXC3J:;

Well# the unlawful ultimat® object

there is to urge affirmative action, .as X rsassafosr?
MR. GOlDs

Well, that’s right, and at that point

the supposition was that California could ban affirmative

action and tha California opinions can foe read as either
banning it or not.

Justice Frankfurter says two different

things in two differant passages.
We do believe for five separate reasons that
Hughes has been passed'by, that it’s analysis is unscamcl.
We think first of all that without acknowledging it# it
expands Gibcetey to change the reguireaenfc from an unlawful
object to one which is against public policy in this very
unusual use of that tersa;.
‘ffe.t secondly Hughes rests on the proposition
that speech which is net an appeal to reason can be ban1.

a view which

is .-.ieoluteXy incompatible, w© would

suggest, -.vita cases such as Cohen and Spence v. {hshiagt<n;
Set, Hughes rests on ’.ho p;«:nise which wa think

32
is absolutely contrary to the test stated in United States
v. 0*Brian that picketing can be banned because it involves
conduct and without regard to whether the ban is absolutely
necessary to prevent wrongful conduct and doesn’t cut into
expressive speech any more than is necessary.
And I want to say something at this point about
tha meaning of picketing and the meaning of compulsion.
Mir. Justice Marshall, ia his opinion in the Mosely case,
noted that picketing can be an act by a single person walk­
ing back and forth with a placard.

Mow, there can hm state­

ments and opinions and statements by the board that that is
inherently, eompulsiva, in the sense, that it would frigbfe-m

I just wanted to mas® one point, and

of the plus aspects that it could b® regulated by the
legislature in furtherance of a legitimate, narrow objec­
tive, and certainly eliminating coercion on neutrals in
labor dispates is an objective within the prerogatives of
