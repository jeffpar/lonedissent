PROCEEDINGS
CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments next

this afternoon in the State of California v. the State of
Nevada.
Mr. Thompson, you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES H„ THOMPSON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE DEFENDANT
MR» THOMPSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The State of Nevada submits that the real issue in
this case is whether California and Nevada in 1863 constitution­
ally set their joint State boundary.

Nevada submits that they

did.
The second question is assuming that boundary was
constitutionally set, that the United States, whether they had
the power to move it onto a new land.

Nevada submits that the

United States did not have this power under the Constitution.
Nevada does concede that if this were a proper case
for application of the doctrine of acquiescence that Nevada
has acquiesced in the present marked lines, the lines recommend ed by the Master.
We submit that this is not a case for the application
/

of the doctrine of acquiescence, because to apply the doctrine
in this case would confer upon the Executive branch of the

i

4

Government the power to act upon State boundaries-

And

this Court in Rhode Island v, Massachusetts many years ago
said:
"There can be but two tribunals under the
Constitution who can act on the boundaries of
States, the legislative or the judicial power, the
former is limited, in express terms, to assent or
dissent, where a compact or agreement is referred
to them"

meaning Congress.

QUESTION:

You say acquiescence is inapplicable here

and your reason for it is that it is the United States that
made the mistake?
MR., THOMPSON:

Yes, sir, it is our contention that

the United States had no power to move the boundary under the
Constitution.

Therefore -~

QUESTION:

Why is acquiescene any less persuasive

in a situation like that than where it simply drafts a wrong
decision of this Court or a mistaken decision of this Court
or a mistake in a surveyor's note?
MR,, THOMPSON:

We contend that the failure of the

power of the United States to move the boundary goes to
California's claim of right in which acquiescence has always
been applied on the claim of right in the State.

In all

the boundary decisions of this Court there has always been
an enabling Act or something of that nature, a concession

5

from Virginia to the United States, a monument of title, a
color of title.

And California, we contend, does not have

3

that because they claim the United States has wrongfully

6

moved, taken part of Nevada and given it to California.
QUESTION:

5

I take it that if we adopt the Special

Master's report and if you take the Special Master's -- it

(5

includes, what, 5,000 acres of land or so, that the United
States purported to give to Nevada?
MF.o THOMPSON:

It is approximately 218 square miles.

to give to Nevada and Nevada purported to convey to settlers.

I don't think it does, particularly --

Even if we accept the Special Master it

wouldn't have any impact on the private titles?

MR, THOMPSON:

Not according to Nevada.

California

and the United States have some question about it but I could
find no parcel of land patented by both States, such as you

17

had in Coffee v. Groover or Poole v. Pleeger.

IS
W \

any parcel.
QUESTION:

20

I haven't found

Would present landowners have to gat their

title quieted in California?
MS, THOMPSON:
i|f

24

Well, if the Special Master's line

is decreed, this Court I remember in Maryland v. West Virginia
that it was the duty of the law-making bodies of those two

.

{t-

States to enact legislation validating the new found --

1

QUESTION:

Well, what if we accept the Special

2

Master's report, are there some more proceedings before the

S

Special Master that have to go on?

4

MR, THOMPSON:

Yes, sir, he has made a recommendation

i

that California be permitted to file an amended complaint in

e

which the matter of titles and certain claims will be asserted

i

against the United States by California.

s

will go into that.

t

QUESTION:

I think Mr. Stevens

But you are not concerned with that, is

that correct?

3
Ii

MR» THOMPSON:

No, sir.

We are strictly concerned

n

with the movement of part of our territory to the State of

13

C a1if o rnia.

?4

Congress can act, they can prescribe a boundary, they

I®

can estab].ish it, they can set it.

But once it is done, they

1?

can't move an established boundary.

So you are back to the

17

S3

question did the joint survey establish the boundary between
*
California and Nevada. And, if it did, it is our contention

I

that the United States has no power whatsoever to go out there
20

and physically move it, to give part of Nevada, a. significant
portion of territory to California.

25

So the despositive question really to be answered
and indeed to be faced, because California won't face it, the
Special Master did not face it, :.s did the Federal Government
act under a power under the Constitution when it moved the

5

posted boundary.

And that question has not been addressed and

we submit that it has to be looked at and answered, you
just can't gc on acquiescene, because there is no

the argument.
up

I must confess I really don't understand

If the claim of right of California is it owns

it has sovereignty up to the 120th Meridian and if they

thought they were claiming land up to the 120th Meridian,.
does it matter whether the survey was dona by a private person
who was misinformed or the United States" Government or is
California or Nevada -MRo THOMPSON:

If it is first set on the ground aiid

marked, that is the boundary.

Under the Constitution you

would then have to go to the compact clause to move it or by
suit in this Court.
QUESTION:

The acquiescence cannot move it even

though the parties believe that is where it is?
MR„THOMPSON:

No, sir, because the actual moving was

without constitutional authority and California's title is
only so good as the title of the United States to that
territory.
QUESTION:

Where does the acquiescence principle come

in?
MR,, THOMPSON:

The Special Master in California

urged it was a simple case of acquiescence, like any other
boundary.

9

QUESTION:

At least you can’t acquiesce if the

boundary is marked on the ground.
MR. THOMPSON:

We cannot acquiesce and avoid a

constitutional act.
QUESTION:

In Arkansas v. Tennessee, I think it was

Chief Justice Hughes' opinion and in the Indiana v. Kentucky
opinion, certainly the acquiescens principle was applied.
MRo THOMPSON:

In every case before this it was

correctly applied, there was a claim with color of title in
10

every case.

It stated in there that Kentucky succeeded to the

ai

ancient right and possession of Virginia.

title.
California is

13

There Was a color of

trying to take advantage of an

unconstitutional void Act and say we have got a valid claim
to it.

And, as X say, the question has not been, addressed.

We tried to address it and we have raised it and for the first
time I have someone who is listening to it.

17
1
13 'jj

If the United States did act under the Constitution,

f
13 ij it did have this power to set the boundary, then the decision
* I

of this Court should rest upon the holding to that effect,
-

that it was pursuant to a constitutional power and not upon
f

2Z

t

acquiescence.
>

Because we can't acquiesce and avoid an Act.

And this Court on several occasions has held, that

as

the State cannot confer on the United States a absent power.

2*3

Chief Justice Marshall in'McCulloch v. Maryland said:

10

"These powers (of the United States) are not
given by the people of a single State.

They are

given by the people of the United States ...
Consequently,the people of a single State cannot
confer a sovereignty which will extend over (the
people of the United States)

... because it is the
*

usurpation of a power -which the people or a single
State cannot give."
And Nevada cannot by acquiescence, silent submission,
constitutionalize the usurpation of a power.
Another case, Pennsylvania v. Wheeling Bridge, there
was question whether a compact between two States end which
Congress had consented to could offer a restriction upon the
power of Congress under the Commerce Clause.
clearly not.

The Court said,

Otherv/ise Congress and twc States would possess

the power to modify and alter the Constitution itself.
There are three other decisions of this Court,
Porley

/. First Municipality, Coyle v. Smith and Pollard v.

Hagan that all said the same thing.
The Special Master said this was a novel argument.
It isn’t.

It goes back to Chief Justice Marshall.

He calls

We submit he could not have been more

wrong.

Clearly then, since a State cannot directly -- as
these decisions say

It can’t; it can’t be done.

this Court.

MR. THOMPSON:

Yes,

sir,

in the evidence there is

township plats for six townships, running from Lake Tahoe north
about 25 miles and there are some chains and links, the NevadaCalifornia boundary line.

And the patents wore issued in

relation; to that line on either side.

QUESTION:

Are the surveyor's notes extant?

MR. THOMPSON:

Yes, sir.

I will put everything in

by Western standards.

Those are in evidence.

21
What California is actually asking this Court when
2/

she requests the Court to hold that acquiescence is controlling

14

is for the Court to apply the equitable doctrine of acquiescence
so as to alter the Constitution, the organic lav; of the land.
And Chief Justice Marshall again put to rest any
notion that the Constitution would be changed by ordinary
means in Marbury v- Madison.

There he said:

"The Constitution is either a superior
paramount law unchangeable by ordinary means or
is on the level with ordinary legislative Acts.
And if the latter part be true, then written
Constitutions are absurd attempts on the part of

1©

the people to limit a power of its own nature
illimitable. "
1 v/ould submit that the Constitution is not an
14

equitable document.

It is a legal document setting forth

•

i
i

relations of the States between each other, or among each
other, among the States vis-a-vis the Federal Government.
And those legal constitutional relationships cannot be changed
by the application of equitable doctrine normally applied
between two priviate citizens.

m
I would like now to talk about the joint State

survey, the Houghton-Ives Line.

California by statute

prescribed that they would use in this joint survey two
22

terminal points set by Lt. J. C. Ives, not to be confused with
24
SS

!,
I1

Butler Ives.

These points were established at the Colorado

River and the 35th Parallel and at Lake

Tahoe.

And they

prescribed that these would be used and they were set by the
United States Boundary Commission in 1861.

So two years later

Meridian and it was surveyed along the lake boundary for about
i

102 miles and the following year California appropriated
money to put a permanent marker at terminal point so as "to
}

enable the survey to be continued from that point at some
future time."
That monument was put up.

The following year, in

1875, Lawson, who also participated in the other survey, Lawson
extended the survey another 73 miles, acting as a joint
commissioner for both States.

So you have to remember at that

time the Nevada boundary with California only went as far as
the 37th Parallel, it did not go to die Colorado River.

So

that joint boundary ::aa surveyed within a few miles of the
37th Parallel by Lawson's terminal monument.

has been run.

the way it was.

It hadn't

They accepted it

And incomplete surveys are not unusual at all. j

The United States Goi~ernment has surveyed many a State boundary j
'ij
by piecemeal surveys.
Probably the longest one is the Manors
•
.

Darling-Preston Line by three different surveyors on the 37th
Parallel between New Mexico Territory and Colorado.

So it is

1

16

not unusual to do it in piecemeal fashion.

And General

Houghton, who was California's commissioner of the joint
survey, reported to the legislature that, we have marked on
the Oblique boundary the important part to be marked at this
time .
I don't think there were any settlements along there.
At this time it was within the power of the United States to
have gone out there at that terminal monument, close the public
land ' surveys, and extend Lawson's terminal monument on to the
Colorado River, fill in that gap.

They would have plenty of

power to do that.
QUESTION:

Well, why was it within the power of the

United States to do that at that time5 since both California
and Nevada had been admitted to the Union?
ME, THOMPSON:

The United States Government surveyed

many State boundaries which turned out to be Scarce boundaries?
our northern boundary with Idaho was surveyed by the United
States.
QUESTION:

Are you saying that after two States

have been admitted, to the Union by an Act of Congress that
the United States Geological Survey can come along and ruji a
survey line that doesn't comport to the Act cf Congress and
that then becomes the boundary?
MRo

Rehnquist.

No, sir, I am not, Mr. Justice

I am saying that the States can set it the first

time or the United States can set it the first time.

But there

California would have you believe that

for some period of time, unspecified, at which a State's
right to rely on its boundary becomes vested and prior thereto
it is subject to being divested.

That is sheer nonsense.

the very day they adopted the joint State Houghton-Ives Line,

never formally approved the Houghton Line, as though there
were some requirement, perhaps by Congress, I don't know, to

Masters said that the Houghton-Ives survey extended

from the Oregon herder to approximately 103 miles southeast of

the intersection in Lake Tahoe-

It was not continued to the

Colorado River and therefore approximately 302 miles of the
Oblique boundary were lef t unmarked and unsurveyed.
MR, THOMPSON:

At that time there was approximately

98 miles left unsurveyed, because Nevada’s boundary with
California did not extend to the Colorado River.

That was

another 200 miles further down.

to delineate the political sovereignty of each State.
QUESTION:

MRo THOMPSON:

So at least as to that you would have to

perhaps assume that the doctrine of acquiescence would, apply.
MR» THOMPSON:

Well, we submit it was surveyed within

That is where Lawson

At that point there was a gap.

We

contend though that the United States, if they wanted to fill
that gap they should have started at the terminal monument on

the State survey and surveyed on to the Colorado River.
QUESTION:

It is a question of filling a gap rather

than moving a line?
MRo THOMPSON:

Yes, sir, filling the gap from the

already posted terminal monument.
Indeed, all that is necessary for Federal recognition
of approval of a boundary is the closure of a General Land
Office upon that line

And this Court has held in Louisiana, v.

Mississippi that the closure there and the deeding' to the
State of Louisiana lands under the swamplands grant approved
Louisiana's title up to that boundary line, the very thing
the General Land Office has done here.

And they called that

And at the time of Nevada's

admission to the Union there was a defined boundary on the
ground.

California had already adopted it ..>3; statute ten

months before Nevada was admitted to the Union.

And Nevada

submits that the Houghton -Ives boundary was constitutionally
e stabiished.
And this Court has repeatedly held that you cannot
move the territorial limits of a State.

the most analagous case to this one

right to rely upon the line previously established could not
be impaired by any subsequent or, the action on the pare of th
United States.

And Congress in that case by resolution had

approved the Carpenter survey and President Roosevelt •—
Theodore Roosevelt vetoed it and Congress never overrode that
veto, he put the line back where it was.
The Special Master said Nevada's territory was not
alienated when Von Schmidt picked up these granite, markers
and set them over to his line.
I suggest the mere fact of all those patents and,
the Nevada patents today, the plan to the west, the

'or Schmidt

line is ample; proof there was an alienation of territory.
It was the Special Master's conclusion that chore was ro
alienation of .•territory.

He ignores all the evidence or. the

matter, that -Houghton-Ives was the first practical location
on the ground.

And being marked for the first time, neither

California nor Nevada gained or lost any territory.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE STEWART:

Mr. Stevens.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAN So STEVENS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE DEFENDANT
MR. STEVENS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
California’s characterization of the Federal action
in surveying the Von Schmidt line as it is described and
delineated in the exhibits-that we have lodged with the Court
for oral argument would be somewhat different from Nevada's.
Our position is that the Federal Government did not in 1872
move the boundary between California and Nevada.

Rather,
(

■what the Federal Government did was to mark that boundary
at a different location and the boundary which the Federal

1
i

Government marked was immediately accepted bv both States
and respected, by them in all of their political actions and
jurisdiction ever since 1872 to the present.
QUESTION:

There' v;asn! t any confusion about the line

was before 1872, at least that it was marked on the ground,
almost all of it..
MR. STEVENS:

It was from Lake Tahoe north, certainly,

i

Qa

Mr. Justice.
QUESTION:

2

And so there was that mark.

And what was

3

the occasion for putting it in the different location, as you

4

say?
MR, STEVENS:

3

It is our understanding that there

<©

were substantial doubts raised, primarily by the General Land

■?

Office, as to the accuracy of the original Houghcon-Ives line.

on the ground, exactly.

And also

to extend southeasterly for approximately 103 miles south of
Lake Tahoe the so-called Oblique boundary to which Justice
Stevens made reference.
The extension of that boundary by Mr. Lawson, to
which counsel has referred:,, was authorized unilaterally by
Nevada and California had no role; in either authorizing or

So the Houghton-Ives line insofar as it existed was
marked on the ground from Lake Tahoe to Oregon and it was

from Lake Tahoe.

QUESTION: Well, suppose the two States in 18 — when

26

was it — Von Schmidt

'72?

MR 0 STEVENS:
QUESTION:

'72.

Suppose the two States had got together

and said, gee, I think it is probably a mistake, they used
this mark on the ground and that is where it was when Nevada
was admitted and that is the lire that both the legislatures
accepted at the time of Nevada's admission, anyway-

Didn't

they accept the line as it was marked on the ground?
HR, STEVENS:
QUESTION:

Yes, they did, Your Honor.

Well, suppose they had said then, well,

we want to change it, we want to chance our boundary.

And

so they signed up an agreement.
Would that have been a valid agreement?
MR= STEVENS:
Your Honor.

I believe that it would have been,

And what happened in fact is very close to that.

QUESTION:

I know you must have to argue that, don't

you?
MR. STEVENS:

Well, whether it is characterised as

agreement or by acquiescence -- or as acquiescence.
QUESTION:

Wouldn't that have required the consent of

Congress?
MRo STEVENS:
that, Mr. Justice.

I believe there is a question as to

Justice Field discussed this at some

length in the course of Virginia v. Tennessee and it was his
feeling that there were several answers to that case, which

27

of course was an acquiescence case and the same point was
raised.
QUESTION:

Well, what about my example, what is the

argument they wouldn't have had the consent of Congress if the
two States wanted to change their boundary?
MR, STEVENS:

Well, I believe Justice Field's first

point, at least, was that in effect this was not an agreement
that altered the political balance of the States or affected
sovereignty to such an extent as to require express
congressional ratification or a compact within the meaning
of that clause.
His second point was that congressional approval
can be inferred as well as expressly given in cases in which
the States have reach an implied agreement or in which they
have acquiesced upon a boundary for a long period of years,
and that this was a separate and independent ground equally
supportive of the position that there was an acquiesced
boundary.

We believe that the same is; true here.

The lines

which are in question have been observed by both States
in the North for 108 years in every respect, in political
jurisdiction school districts and county lines have been
drawn up and they were immediately accepted.
QUESTION:

Well, the United States, though, based

on the old line conveyed in Nevada some land that was -- you
claim was in California.

28

MP.o STEVENS:
QUESTION:

That is right, Mr. Justice.

Well, so you infer United States

acquiescence or approval of that agreement of moving the line?
MR. STEVENS:

I believe so, because immediately

after the new line was drawn the General Land Office directed
that its public surveys be redrawn to close upon the new
line.

And subsequently if land title stability is to be a

factor California received many lands based in reliance upon
the new Von Schmidt line.
QUESTION:

Upon the subsequent line.* yes.

w[R0 STEVENS :■
QUESTION:

So as a matter of equity --

You say California received new lands.

You mean in the sense of political' jurisdiction or in the
sense of ownership of school lards and that type of thing?
The United States patented lands in California based on the
Von Schmidt line.
MRo STEVENS:

That is correct, it did.

Otherwise it would have been in Nevada,

under the old line.
MRo STEVENS:
QUESTION:

That is right, Your Honor.

That is where you say the United States
;

g

acquiesced?
MR» STEVENS:

Yes, Your Honor.

That is our position. '

The United States not only expressly approved this new boundary j
line but it subsequently immediately took all steps that were

necessary, including the recognition for public land, purposes
to recognise this as public land within California.
it did a lot of other things, too*

Of course

The post office maps

showed the new Von Schmidt line, the Federal judicial districts
reflected that line and in every respect it was recognised by
the United States as well as both the States ever since 1372.
QUESTION:

Is it fair to say that California in this;

case depends upon treating acquiescence in the same way and
having the same consequences as an affirmative agreement, an
affirmative express agreementton the boundary?
MR» STEVENS:

I believe that is basically one of

the two points that v;e would believe militates for this line,
Your Honor.

Acquiescence, whether it is characterized as

acquiescence or as agreement I am not sure is important, be­
cause we believe that both are shown under the facts here
and under the reasoning of Justice Field in Virginia v.
Tennessee.
We assumed, Mr. Chief Justice, for the purposes of
this argument since Nevada has not referred to the alternative
lines which it has urged before the Special Master that unless
the Court desires us to discuss them we will address ourselves
primarily to the principal lines in issue, the Houghton-Ives
Line and the Von Schmidt Line in the north and the Coast s
Geodetic Survey Line on the Oblique boundary.
Nevada had also

MR. STEVENS:

If the 120th Meridian is to be the

boundary between Nevada and California and if the Court rejects.,
the concept of acquiescence or acceptance of the lines which
have been respected by both the Stater, we believe that the
only proper thing to do would be to order a new survey, as
the Court did of course in the New Mexico case.

And such a

new survey could in fact depict the 120th Meridian with a

could be net nose O^Gcisely..defined today than it .could have
/
been a hundred years ago.

And this of course is very true.

m
And this is why. our principal prayer is for an acquiesced
18

boundary rather than through a new survey by which California
2©
would actually stand to gain seme rather significant land
around Lake Tahoe.
QUESTION:

Do you think when this description was

originally agreed upon chat people knew it would end up in the
middle of Lake Tahoe, the meeting of the two lines?

31

MRo

STEVENSi

Well, Your Honor, I don't believe that

land was very important to people and very little attention was
paid to it.
Some question has been laid of course to the acceptande
of both States, their readiness to accept a new boundary as
laid by the United States in 187:2.

And perhaps the principal

reason would be their eagerness to select from the public
domain and to have these lands go into private hands, because
as a practical matter of course unless the General Land Office
had a boundary that it was happy with, it was going to be
impossible,for either California or Nevada to make selections
of school lands and other lands that could in fact be put into
I private hands. And there was a creat deal of pressure to do
|
j so in those days.
QUESTION:

We believe that the record amply supports the Special [

29
acceptance of this line.

The Caiifornia-Nevada boundary was

£1
established of course by California's 1849 Constitution and

12
California has never consented tc a different location.

So the

120th Meridian must be the description of the California-Nevadc.

boundary.

No other description can take its place.

I

33

QUESTION:

Unless there has been acquiescence.

MRo STEVENS:

That is right, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

And actually I think that the acquiescence perhaps itself
could only go to the location of that 120th Meridian on the
ground.

I am not sure California could acquiesce for instance

in a different line at the 43rd Meridian west of Washington,
which was one of Nevada's alternative suggestions, because
that is an entirely different line from chat set forth in the
California Constitution.
QUESTION:

Well, shat about Justice Field's comment

in the old Indiana case that it wouldn't significantly alter
the balance of power between the States as a ground for allowing
acquies cence ?
MR» STEVENS:

That might be used to argue and

support such a different location.
QUESTION:

Justice Field didn't know how valuable

land around Lake Tahoe was going to be in the 20th Century,
did he?
MR» STEVENS:

He did not, Mr. Chief Justice, although

me did come from California.

It was not very valuable in those

days .
The proof with respect to acceptance of this boundary
by Nevada is rather incontrovertible.

The Nevada Surveyor

General pointed out in his 1373 report that the Federal
■

Government was in the process of surveying a new line,

34

depicting the 120th Meridian and he praised them for it.

ing will be entirely and forever obviated.
opinion in 1373.

This was his

We hope that his opinion will be borne out

by the decision of this Court.
The Nevada State Controller promptly directed the
county assessors to close their lines upon the new boundary.
The legislature in Nevada used the new boundary to define
county boundaries of Nevada.

And of course the General Land

Office directed that the public land surveys be closed upon
i t.
And ever since 1872 in the north and 1903 in the
south with respect to the Oblique boundaries this has been
the case.

There is no dispute with respect to mutual observanc

by the two States of the boundary that is marked on the ground
and respected by them today.

And if stability is to be a

factor, we would suggest that this boundary should be put to
rest and ratified, in effect, by the Court as the accurate
placement of this line.
QUESTION:

Am I right in thinking that Nevada has

no western boundary except the eastern boundary of California?
MRo STEVENS:

Yes, Your Honor, I believe that that

is the accurate description.

35
Now, the Nevada Constitution uses a dual description
of its western boundary.

Their Constitution refers to the 43rd

Meridian west of Washington and the eastern boundary of
California.

But it has been our position that the facts before

the Special Master pretty well showed that it was believed in
those days the 43rd Meridian ’vest of Washington was synonymous
with the 120th Meridian west of Greenwich.

QUESTION:

What precipitated this dispute;

why are you all jerc if you have been so happy all these years?
MRo STEVENS:

There were two principal factors, Your

The first is that it has been discovered from time
to time and more lately, very recently that the location of the
boundary was not an accurate depiction of the 120ch Meridian.

MR» STEVENS:

The second concern that came to our

attention was a ruling of the Department of the Interior which
seemed to cast doubt upon the validity of titles which were
granted in reliance upon the old replaced boundary, the Von
Schmidt boundary.

In effect, the Department of the Interior

has held that a school land selection initially made in
California and approved by the Department of the Interior at
that time clear listed, in effect, but subsequently found to
be located actually in Nevada remained public lands, notwith­
standing the usual line of authority that once a survey is
approved by the Federal Government of a selection made by a
State, then the title has passed to the State or the persons

boundary.

This has been suggested by the Solicitor General.

Perhaps legislation passed by the two States and by Congress
can solve it and perhaps this Court can offer some further
8

relief} thereby settling all problems which have arisen from

9

the Cali'fornia-Nevada boundary.
QUESTION:

I have one more question.

California was the plaintiff in the case.

In your

original complaint did you ask the Master to declare the
19
14

Von Schmidt line the correct line , or the 120th Meridian the
correct line?
MRo STEVENS:

16

16
17
18
19

20

We asked that the Von Schmidt line be

declared to be the accurate one, Your Honor., it was basically
in the nature of a quiet title as has been suggested.

When

alternative lines were suggested by Nevada, we felt it
necessary to request an alternative survey of our own because
if the entire, location of the line was to be questioned to
such extent,we felt that an accurate survey should be thrown

21

22
<:F'

in as an. alternative to quieting, in effect, the present
line .

tW

o s■ Sj
“

The Oblique boundary of course we have referred to
was surveyed somewhat later chan the north-south boundary.

It

40

1

was surveyed from 1893 fco 1899 by the Coast £ Geodetic Survey.

z

And it replaced the Von Schmidt Line which is the only line
that entirely surveyed the Oblique boundary from Lake Tahoe
to the Colorado River.
Once again, we feel that this is clearly an accepted
and an acquiesced boundary and the evidence is exactly the

6

same with respect to its acceptance by the States, with two
exceptions.
One, the period of acquiescence is somewhat shorter,
a$>

{

And the second thing is that this line was recognized

not only in fact but in statute by both the States.

the fact the Coast S Geodetic line delineated their boundaries.
QUESTION:

Do both Nevada and California recognize

the Act of Congress in the

’Sixties as making the canalized

Colorado River the boundary where California and Nevada have
joint boundaries?
MRo STEVENS:

Yes, Your Honor, we do.

We have no

problem as to the point.
Now, in the Oblique boundary, just by way of passing,
Nevada gained 256 square miles but California nevertheless

22

recognized that boundary initially and we feel it deserves

And you have not acted on that.

So in the absence of that, we would have

to simply resolve the issue of the boundary line and if this
Special Master went beyond the reference to suggest private
title litigation, a decree reflecting that recommendation
would probably be beyond the reference, wouldn't it?
MR» STEVENS:

I am not sure, Your Honor.

The

Special Master initially recommended in its preliminary

QUESTION:

If we were to grant your motion for

the amended complaint, do we know now whether Nevada will be
in agreement with that, assuming we go with you on the main
issues?
MR„ STEVENS:

By agreement, Mr. Chief Justice, you

are referring to resolution of the question of titles?
QUESTJION:

MRo STEVENS:
QUESTION:

We would have every hope that we --

We don’t know chat now.

Perhaps Nevada

is not prepared to respond, but we will see.
MR„ STEVENS:

We can’t speak for them, really.

There is precedent of course for such a proceeding.
In the last case, Oklahoma v. Louisiana, "which this Special
Master presided over the question to possible United States
title to an island, an island named Sam, the State line river
as I recall, came up in the course of the proceedings and it
was determined that a further determination.was necessary
to resolve the entire border controversy to ascertain what
U.S. interests may be in that island.
Florida, v. Georgia of course is the best and most
apropo precedent for such a thing.

In that case the United

States Attorney General actively applied for leave to inter­
vene in a boundary dispute between two States on the basis
that millions of acres had been alienated by the United

45

1

States in

2

was contending to be Georgia and that therefore the United

3

States had a real interest to its grantees in participating in

4

the proceeding and helping to assist the Court in ascertaining

S

the propriety both of the boundary and the consequences of

8

that boundary determination, the status of lands within the

7

affected States.

P.

and well briefed, he argued, and the United States had a

3

general interest in State boundaries because of political

13

what it then believed to be Florida but Georgia

It was the duty to see the case was fully

s

considerations.
Well, in that case Justice Tawney granted leave for

11
'

12

the United States to intervene informally, as it was character- j

13

ised ac that time, and to present evidence and to participate

14

but not to be granted leave as a formal party. And perhaps

15

this resembles what the Special Master has recommended in this

IS

case, that the United States offer ■

Nevada and. California to help clear up this last remaining

to participate with

*

These proceedings would determine the titles1

I
to the United States and that is not a very informal participation
if you are going to present the United States with a decree,
is it?
MRo STEVENS:

That is true, Mr. Justice White, and

it may be necessary that they join formally at a. later time.
They have deferred presentation of their views and simply asked \

46

to bo given an opportunity to participate informally until
resolution can be had.
Basically, then, our position has been that the
boundary question is one which is capable of easy resolution.
It does not represent a case of the unconstitutional transfer
of a boundary from one jurisdiction to another.

Rather, it

involves the location of a boundary in the ground which was
accepted immediately by both States and has been relied upon
by the residents of those States for over 100 years in one
case and for 80 years in the other.

The cases we think

clearly support the Special Master's recommendation in that
case that the boundary be settled, where it has been and where
we r e1ie d upon it.
QUESTION:

Well, you think it is just as though there

was a dispute at the time about where the boundary was, that
it had never been marked on the around definitely and people
were in a big argument about where it was and so the two
States agreed to have a survey.

So it is marked on the ground

and they both then accept it.
You think the situation is just like that?
MR. .STEVENS :

It is very close to that, Your Honor,

if not precisely that.
QUESTION:

The only thing is that there was a line

on the ground.
MRo STEVENS:.

The difference is that there was a line

47

and the States have accepted it.

And the Federal Government

came along and marked a new line; and the States promptly
accepted that line and they have done so ever since.
QUESTION:

All the time thinking that they were

locating the 120th Meridian?
MRo STEVENS:

That is right, that is correct.

The 120th Meridian is we think beyond doubt the proper
constitutional boundary between the States.

And for that

reason we haven't gone into the alternative line suggested
by Nevada.

We believe that the location which we have

respected for all this time should be affirmed at this time.
QUESTION:

The alternative line being the 43rd

west of D.C.?
MRo STEVENS:
west of D.C.

Nevada's alternative being the 43rd

And Nevada's second alternative being another

line altogether drawn from a different location at the Oregon
border, which was represented as being the 120th.
QUESTION:

Where in D.C. did the measurement start,

Mr. Stevens?
MR» STEVENS:

Your Honor, we believe it originally

was in the White House and it was subsequently moved to the
old Naval Observatory and then to the new Naval Observatory.
And the one to which the Act of Congress of September 29,
1859 referred to is not entirely clear to us but in any event
it would be approximately 2-1/2 miles farther west into

California.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT CF JAMES H„ THOMPSON, ESO.,

ON BEHALF CF THE PLAINTIFF
MR o THOMPSON:

10

Yes, sir.

I might add that the 43rd Meridian did not spring
11

out of Nevada's Constitution, it was in Nevada's enabling Act
12

by Congress.

At the time Nevada's Attorney General said, we

13

14>

welcome this new "State boundary," that same year the United
I
States was surveving Nevada‘s northern boundary.

So we had

t3
16

to get up there, we had to get up on the Oblique.

So when

they said fully enclosed, we had hoped we were getting an
