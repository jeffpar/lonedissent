MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr» Trienens, we will let you get started.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF HOWARD TRIENENS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. TRIENENS;

Mr» Chief Justice, and may it please tae

Courts
There are two questions here*

In both respects, the

Illinois Courts have a rigid, unwaiver.ing rule which forbids a
jury being informed of two Federal tax consequences, income tax
consequences,that profoundly affect the amount of av,rards in FELA
cases.

One of them is whether the amount of the tax that a de­

cedent.. would have paid on his income may be considered in de­
ciding how much the beneficiary —- how much contribution the bene­
ficiary has lost*
And the second is to inform this jury of the tax-free
character of the award, however measured*
Now, the point of FELA is not to punish rareties.

It

is to be sure that beneficiaries get damages measured by their
financial loss, and for that only.
The FELA cases can be tried in state or federal courts,
but the proper measure of damages, to quote from an early decision
in Chesapeake & Ohio v* Kelly, "proper measure of damages is in­
separably connected to the right of action, and therefore must be

4

'

settled according to uniform standards under the FELA,”
QUESTION;

If line instruction you requested had been

given, would you be here — and the same verdict had come in?
MR. TRIENENS;

As to that issue on the instruction,

the answer is we would not be here for failure to give the in­
struction.

It might well have been that the state court would

have granted a remititure in this case, but no, we wouldn't have
been hare if the instruction had been given on that aspect.
The' other aspect is income tax -effect on the amount of contri­
bution»

ThatTs a separate question,

I mean a combination of the, tax instruc­

tion,, in other words.
would not be

If that had been given, you indicate you

here.

MR. TRIENENS:

We wouldn’t be here on that issue, but

we would still be here on the issue we briefed first, which is
the question of whether in measuring the damages actually inA

curred by the beneficiaries they should have reflected the fact
that-the amount the decedent paid-in taxes, would never have been
available to the beneficiary.

And that's a quite different

question,
QUESTION;
the whole

tax aspect.

I meant

If you. had gotten the instruction you

wanted on both aspects of the tax problem, and had the same
verdict, then all you would have left was a claim of an exces­
sive verdict, wouldn't you?

5

MR. TRIENENS:

Yes, sir, but perhaps the reason I

fell off the sled was this.

It is more than the instruction on

this question of the taxation of the decedent and how much would
have been available for contribution, because that was a ques­
tion of no evidence, no cross-examination, a lot of other things

(Is00 p.m.)
MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Counsel, you 'may resume»

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HOWARD TRIENENS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER (Resumed)
MR. TRIENEHS;

If cross-examination had been permittee,

in this case on the matter of Federal income tax effects, if the
offer of proof had been received in evidence, and the jury had
been properly instructed, we think the award would have been very,
very different»

The errors here were clearly prejudicial.

The

lower court never found — They weren’t prejudicial, they just
found that they weren’t errors.
QUESTION;

Mr. Trienens, does it make much sense to

fine tune the lost earnings part of the award this way, when the
jury is virtually permitted to throw darts at the wall on pain and
suffering?
MR. TRIENENS;

In the first place, in a death case, like

this, it is clear that the losses are limited to financial losses
incurred by the beneficiaries by reason of the death.

That’s net

involved here, but it certainly is not true that a factor such as
Federal income tax, which is after all money that could never have
gotten to these beneficiaries if the man had lived
not something to be considered.

but that’s

It is no more trivial than the

In fact, it is far more important than

the other things that go on in the trials of these cases.

For example, the expert witness gets on, for the
Plaintiff,

rigamaroll, but in fact he very precisely says, "Here are the
gross wages, $13,000 when he died, $17,000 by the time of trial,
so many percent a year to reflect inflation" *—

people may ask him questions like that*

We want you to instruct

these lawyers before the witness ever gets on he can’t talk about
that*"
We had an argument before the witness went on,we had
an argument afterward, about our right to cross-examine on this
question*
As far as adding to the complexity here, if this

then he discounted those wages -— Excuse me, not discounted —
he deducted from those wages the personal expenditures of the
decedent, clothing, food, entertainment, 10% this year, 25% later,

standards under the Act, if that’s the approach?
QUESTION:

Mr. Trienens, you've made the point that an

PELA case can be brought in either Federal or State court, but
that Federal law controls.

Is it your basic submission here —

and the further point that Illinois forbids the introduction of
any evidence in either aspect of your Federal income tax.

First,

that, his wages would have been subject to Federal income tax,
and secondly that the award is not subject to any tax.

Is it

your submission that Federal law requires that this be submitted
to the jury or simply permits it?
MR. TRIENENS:
QUESTION:

It is our position —

Illinois law prohibits it.

MR. TRIENENS:

Illinois law prohibits it.

It is our

position that in cases where it is substantial, at least, the
state should not prohibit us from asking the Plaintiff's witness

Federal law should permit it or because

the measure is the financial loss to the beneficiarie;
QUESTION;

Would you settle for the Boxberger rule

in the Ninth Circuit?
MR. TRIEMENS:
Boxbe.rger rule.

I don’t have any quarrel with the

I think Judge Ely’s opinion is one of the best

on the books on this subject.
QUESTION;

But he didn’t say Federal law requires it

in every case, did he?
MR, TRIENENSs

He said in every case where it is sub­

stantial, and it is a matter for the discretion of the trial
court.
QUESTION;

Exactly,

If it is for the discretion of

the trial court, it is not required, is it?
MR. TRIEMENS:

Well, the Illinois rule absolutely

prohibits it,
QUESTION;

I know that.

MR. TRIENENS;
But as to the question

And that’s what we are here talking.
And this gets complicated by_the

question of prejudicial error.

I am not hare saying that the

result reached by the Second Circuit in McWeeney, for example,
"*

was wrong.

«faNMHWaMaKNMaaaaUMaiam

After all, the trial had happened, they knew what

judgment was, they knew what the evidence was, and it clearly
was within the- range of the evidence, and that this was a fairly

10

de minimis factor,, at a man earning $4800 a year at that time.
The Second Circuit later, using the McWeeney approach, carne along
in a case about subpoena, where the man had $16 to $20,000, whatever it was, $16 to $40 — $25,000 in that case, that was sub­
stantial, and they should have considered it.
I am not here saying that every case in which a trial
judge doesn't receive the evidence, and in which Appellate Court
says, "That's all right, but it wasn't prejudicial in that case,"
I am not saying that you have to knock out every case,
saying that the rule should be that it is relevant.

I am just

The rule

should be that if we want to cross-examine on a relevant matter,
just like persona], expenditures, household chores, you ought to
ask about this.

And if it doesn't —

QUESTION:

Putting it just a little differently, do I

correctly understand that what you are saying is that as a matter
of Federal law it is relevant, and a state rule that says it is
irrelevant is preempted by the Federal rule?
MR. TRIENENSs

Precisely.

And the whole point of the

FELA, both as to defenses and as to damages was to supplant state
law. "It was in order to create uniformity throughout the Union'' —

I am reading from the legislative history of the FELA.

And, of

When there: is a relevant mattea

that is relevant under FELA, it supplants state law, and state ..aw
is knocked down when it says that this matter cannot be considered
by the jury.

It's wrong.

QUESTION;

After the Akron case and all the cases, Ohio

can't apply its rule as to releases, Texas can't apply a procedural
rule, we are pretty far down the Federal law track on that.

Oh, sure.

Now take this complexity

the track and go back to Chesepeake and Ohio v. Kelly.

It is too com­

plicated for juries to discount the future earnings to a present
cash value.

That's too complicated for juries.

We in Kentucky

aren’t going to require that.”
This Court said it may be complicated but the Federal,
standard is it is the contribution they lost and you ’are overcompensating them if you don't discount the future to present
value.
QUESTION:

Would you say it is more or less complicated

or speculative than measuring the value of his services fixing
the screen windovrs and painting the trim on the house, and what
not?

*
MR. TRIENENS;

I would say either of those.

Either

the discounting process or fixing the screen door are far more
speculative and far more complex than the question of;

Does a

fellow who at this wage level pays 14% of his wages in income
taxes.
QUESTION;

Did your clients have an offer of proof

showing what these figures would be;1

12

MR. TRIENENS:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

So we can look at it and see its signifi­

cance here now, can't we?
MR. TRIENENS:

Sure.

For example, in addition to asking to cross on this
and being denied we offered to prove through an expert that over
the lifetime $57,000 of decedent's gross income would have gone
to taxes, and therefore would never have been available to his
beneficiaries.

It's at page 75 of the Appendix.

QUESTION:

Of course, that could, at best, be an

Nobody knows what the future tax laws are going to he.
MR. TRIENENS:

The world is full of estimates, but

as estimates go and as you read this case that’s one of the
least of the problems of estimating, one of the least of the
problems.
QUESTION s

In discotinting the present value — To get.

the present value of future earnings you use more or less an
arbitrary interest rate, don’t you?
MR. TRIENENS:

It is far more complicated than that.

If you really want to prolong one of these trials and really
get complicated, you go into that.

Now in the first place,

does that represent today's interest rate or the interest rate
you are projecting over each of the twenty years of his life?
Does it reflect a taxable return on equity or corporate bonds?
Is it influenced by municipal bonds, as Kelly suggested it

these cases# is in amazing disarray.

QUESTION:

You are trying to get it out of that rut?

MR. TRIENENS:

I think it is the responsibility of this

Court, under FELA, to have a uniform, standard for the Union to
decide what is right, what's -the relevant standard, and that will
be it.

QUESTION:

Illinois has been'-— a lot of the states

have —- This is an old issue in negligence cases, isn't it?
MR. TRIENENS:

both aspects of this case,

MR. TRIENENS;

Your Honor, what I am saying is that

if Federal taxes had been a significant .item at the time of the
Vreeland case, the Kelly case, all the cases that decided the
standards of the FELA — If that had been a substantial item, or
even thought about, there is no doubt on the logic it would have
come out the same.
QUESTION;

Nothing you are saying would require any

rule -that forbad Illinois in a noiv-FELA case from using whatever
jury instruction or consideration of taxation it wanted to as
a matter of state policy.
MR. TRIENENS;

No.

We are talking only about FELA

QUESTION;

that have general significance throughout Federal law?

Wouldn’t
For

example, the Antitrust Laws and every place else where you have
Federal judgments.

Is it your position that in all those cases

the tax consequence of the award should be explained to the jury?
MR. TRIENENS;

No, I don't get that far because there •

is an inherent, internal inconsistency in the instructions that
are given under the Illinois pattern, and generally, in FELA
cases.

The inconsistency is this.

You are, in the first place,

telling the jury to make these beneficiaries whole, make them

16

whole as if the man hadn*1 died, so his contributions would,
have continued.

Fine.

But that to a juror who isn't told about

the tax laws and who is living in a tax-conscious society where,,
as one of the courts said, Irish lottery winnings are taxed,
everything is taxed — When they gat that -they say, "Well, if
I am going to make him whole and evidence shows financial loss
of $300,000, I had better see that they get $600,000."
QUESTION;

How about the Plaintiff's contingent fee

arrangement with his lawyer?

And they tell the jury that whatever

you award,the Plaintiff, himself,is only going to get a maximum
of two-» thirds of it.
MR. TRIENENS;

That's different, quite different.

It is different because in Alyeska and elsewhere the American
system, and under FELA cases, is that the defendant does not
pay the attorney fees.

Congress could change that, but they

QUESTION;

Well, the Defendant doesn't pay his taxes

It is the Plaintiff who pays them,
MR. TRIENENS:

The Plaintiff doesn't have to pay taxes,

We are not talking about the separate question of the award,
however measured.

Whatever that measurement is, they don't

pay any taxes on that.

It is just a question of telling the

jury the facts of life.
QUESTION;

The facts of life include that contingent

17

fee t too»
MR. TRIENENSs

But the fact of life also is that

Congress has not provided that the Railroad should pay their
lawyers* fees and —
QUESTION :

And I suppose if you could instruct that

you can't consider the attorneys' fees or you can, then you
could also get to expert witness fees and ‘that sort of thing. .
MR. TRIENENSs

I think they are of quite different

character than this.
QUESTION:

Why do you want the instruction on the

award,to keep the jury from thinking that it is subject to
taxation and doubling it?
MR, TRIENENSs

Yes, exactly, and doing just what we

think they did here.
QUESTION:

Which do you regard as the strongest of

your two points?
MR, TRIENENSs

I think they are so separate,and as to

the inherent logic of FELA damages, no doubt the first point
which we brief is the one that fits right in with that.

As to

this instruction point, 1 think it is important, and just to
paraphrase Judge Ely, he says, "The benefits of informing the
jury of ’the true tax consequences are so clear, and the burden so
minimal, that the balance is overwhelmingly in favor of giving
instruction.*
QUESTION:

How could the jury really do you in in the

18

death case?
MR, TRIENEKS:
QUESTION;

How could they do us in?

How could this fear really become real?

Wouldn’t it be perfectly obvious to an Appellate Court that the
jury exceeded the damages, or not?

It may not be in a pain anc

suffering case,- but that isn’t so here.

You just told us that

this depends on financial loss.
MR. TRXENENS;

That’s right, and as a matter of States

law we urge that there ought to be a reminiter here.

We thought

it was clear what happened, but the Illinois court said, "Welle
we are not going to mess around with these damages, with these
income tax instructions.13
QUESTION;

Wasn’t the total damages awarded within the

evidence?
MR. TRXENENS;

No, sir.

The evidence of the economic?

witness who put on the calculation of financial loss was $302,000.
There w7as also soma talk about the loss of guidance to the chil­
dren.

This is loss of what you would have to pay somebody to

give them guidance, as to* which the economic man couldn't put
any dollar figure.
So they come in not with $300,000, to remotely resemble
this guidance, they come up with $775,000.

More than double.

Plenty of room for all the guidance talk and then doubled it.
You see, that's the difference between this and
McWeeney.

Do you think the jury thought the award
And it will be taxable at more than 50%

MR. TRIENENS:

Well, when you throw in something

for guidance and double it, I think that's the best explanation
you can of the award of this level.'

And, as I say, it is un­

like McWeeney where they said, "Well, Judge Weinfeld didn't

v

But, after all, the clear damages

evidence showed about $120,000.
how can we say prejudice?

The jury gave $85,000.

So

Here we've got the case where the

prejudice is clear from the absence of the instruction.
QUESTION s

What was the amount of the award?

.MR. TRIENENS;
QUESTION;

$775,000.

What was the amount requested in the

complaint?
MR. TRIENENS;

$500,000.

And I think before the

20

juryf Mr. Fleisher said he would like $1 million.
QUESTION?

Well, if the jury is going to think about

taxes in connection with the award, why wouldn’t 'they think about
taxes in connection with measuring damagesV without an instruc­
tion?
MR. TRIENENS:

Of course, they couldn’t.

There

wasn’t any record, because we were blocked, from that, too.
QUESTION:
posed to be..

Well, they knew what his wages were sup­

I guess each one of them is paying some taxes.

They might talk about how much he was really going to take homes,
how much was really going to be available.
MR. TRIENENS:
QUESTION:

Why not tell them?

That isn’t what I asked you.

I would think

you would — If the jury is going to think about taxes in one
context, it would the other.
MR, TRIENENS:
QUESTION:

Why have records?

Did the expert witness testify as to take-

home pay or as to gross?
MR, TRIENENS;

He testified as to take-home pay in the

sense that he deducted the personal expenditures of the decedent*
QUESTION:

But before taxes?

MR. TRIENENS:

But before taxes, so it is something you

Cein't logically defend,doing both those things.
The last point I would like to make is that all cases;
— talking about these FELh cases — of all cases in which the

21

Railroad is saying, "You ought to let the jury have these facts
and do the right thing,” and the Plaintiffs are saying, "You
ought to keep these things from the jury,"

you would think in

FELA cases where the faith in juries is supposed to be the
greatest, this would be. one of the ironies of all time.
QUESTION;

I suppose it would be difficult to imagine

an FELA coverage of someone with a salary of the President of

Of course, we

Say, just an.ordinary
You couldn’t show

that more than half of $500,000 taxes are going to come out
of this man’s income.

You would have greater distortion than

you have here, wouldn’t you?
MR. TRIENENS:

Oh, my, yes.

As to the point about

how much of his income would have gone to the Government in­
stead of his beneficiaries, it would have been much greater.

Eut,

of course, we are in an area where it is clearly substantial
under all the cases.

And also as to the amount of the award,

$775,000, or what they thought they had to double,

that's

pretty big money itself.
QUESTION;

I take it, you are not. making any point of

the distinction between the amount requested and the amount of
the verdict, under Illinois practice?

I find nothing in the

Appendix which indicates an amendment to the pleading.

22

MR. TRXENENS;

I am not making that point here because

the sole point I am making is the effect of income taxes on the
FELA standards.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Fleisher.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD S. FLEISHERr ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. FLEISHER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Counsel for the Railroad today has asked this Court to
consider two issues.

The first, is to impose a net wage standard

as the measure of damages in all FELA claims.

This proposition

has never been followed by any state or Federal appellate court
decision in this country.
The second issue asks this Court to today reverse a
jury award, in this case, as a cautionary instruction telling the
jury that this award was tax-free was not given by the trial judge
Again, no state or Federal appellate court has ever
reversed a verdict for the failure to give such a cautionary
instruction.
QUESTION:

If the jury during its deliberations had

come back and said they wanted to ask the judge a question, and
the question was, "Should we take into consideration the fact
that the wages projected should be take-home pay, after you
dech at Federal taxes, in computing the present value of the award,

2

do you think the judge should have answered it, could have
answered it?
MR. FLEISHER:

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I feel the judge ■

could not have answered that question, as there was no evidence
before this jury as to the effects of taxes on the man’s gross
earnings.
QUESTION:

But it had been offered and refused, as I

understand it.
MR. FLEISHER:

The instruction that was offered was

not the instruction that Your Honor has just presented to me.
QUESTIONS

I thought that there had been an effort to

cross-examine the expert.
MR. FLEXSHERs

There was an effort, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist, to admit a cautionary instruction, stating that the
award was not subject to taxes.

That, in itself, was the only

cautionary instruction that was tendered before the trial judges,
and that was properly refused.
QUESTION:

Wasn’t there an effort to cross-examine

your expert as to the effect of withholding on the man’s future:
income?
MR. FLEISHER:

Yes, Your Honor, and that was done

outside the presence of the jury by an offer of proof in
«

chambers, so that there was no evidence presented to this jury
where they would possibly raise that question.
QUESTION:

You are saying, in effect, that the jury

24

couldn't get the answer to that question, regardless of whether
the judge's inliiainary ruling was right or wrong.
MR. FLEXSHER;

That’s correct, on the basis of the

evidence in that case$ since'- there was no evidence before the
jury as to the effect of gross versus net, there could be no
instruction.

As we all are aware, instructions are based on

evidence that is presented before the jury in open court.
QUESTION?

It follows from that, I take it, that you

would submit that you would be entitled to an instruction to the
jury, "Don’t consider the matter of taxation in computing the
award"?
MR. FLEISIIER:

know whether you think you would be entitled to an instruction
to the jury, "Do not consider taxes at all when computing the
award"?
MR. FLEISHER:

No,

I do not feel that that is a

proper instruction, just as I do not feel the other is, depending
on the evidence that is presented to the jury at the time of the
trial,

26

QUESTIONS

Well, when the evidence is first presented,

supposing the Railroad offers evidence that the man's take™
home pay was such and such, although your expert has testified
only as to gross pay, ought that evidence to be admitted?
MR. FLEISHER:

In this instant case, no, Your Honor,

because the evidence that was submitted by the improper offer of
proof by the Railroad counsel was that the taxes were so negli­
gible that under the McWeeney minority rule they would not have
any substantial or significant impact on the man’s gross earnings.
The taxas were based on from the years 1973 to :the year 2000,
or a total of 27 years, the taxes would be $54,000, approximately
only $2,000 a year in taxes.
QUESTION;

But 10% of which you pay for in your

complaint.
MR. FLEISHER:

My complaint, Your Honor, was based on

the law in Illinois, the instruction that is set out in our brief
as to the evidence of damages for wrongful debt in Illinois.
Contrary to what Mr. Trienens stated, y5u are not limited merely
to your wages, under Illinois lav;, for a wrongful death action
under the FELA, or in any jurisdiction.
QUESTION;

You can recover pain and suffering?

MR. FLEISHER;

You canno^ recover pain and suffering,

However, in the case of minor children, of which decedent had
four, the youngest being approximately four months of age, the
Illinois instruction allows you to recover damages :cor the loss

of care $ attention, instruction., training, advice and guidance
to each of those children.
QUESTION:

Is that a case from this Court that pro­

vides for that?
MR. FLEISHER:

That is the lav; in Illinois.

That is

the Illinois pattern instruction.
QUESTION:

Illinois law is totally superseded by

Federal law in FELA cases.
MR. FLEISHER:

If I may address myself to that

matter, under Federal lav;, for damages in the FELA, you are
entitled to the same basic elements that 1 just stated to Your
Honor.

That is undisputed.
QUESTION:

I thought you said there had been no case

from this Court, saying you are entitled to recover for loss of
guidance to minor children,
MR. FLEISHER:
QUESTION:

No, I don't believe I said that,

I am sorry.

MR, FLEISIIER:

Uhat case is it?

If you are asking for a specific

case —
QUESTION:

Yes, I am,

MR. FLEISIIER:

— from this Court, I can only refer

back to the history of the FELA from this Court, as to the
liberal recovery, as to the full and proper intent for com­
plete damages —
QUESTION:

Let's face it, this Court was pro-Railroad

from 19QB to 1939, and pro-Plaintiff from 1939 until some —
perhaps still is.

It has not been an unwaivering line.

So

to act as if the construction of the FELA has been kind of a
straight line thing since 1908, just isn't accurate in the light
of the decisions.

They have bent one v/ay sometimes and bent

the other vay other times.
MR. FLEISHER:

I do not dispute, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist, what you say.

I can only assert to the Court that

the proper element of damages under an FELA is not strictly
limited to wage laws.
decision*

It never lias been in any Federal court

It never has been by any Federal District Court, by

any Court of Appeals, or by this Court.
In the Petition, the Railroad has asserted that there
is a conflict between Federal and State courts, as to the
method of computing future loss of earnings in an FELA claim.
It implies, as Mr. Treinens said today, that this is conflict
of gross versus net.
QUESTION:

That is simply not correct*
How do you say the instruction would be

in Federal court?
MR. FLEISHER:
cautionary instruction.

The instruction. Your Honor, is a
It is procedural*

It is procedural.

It is discretionary with a trial court.
QUESTION:

Does it permit the introduction of the

evidence which was excluded here?
MR. FLEISHER:

No, Your Honor.

There is no

instruction that has ever been tendered that has been reversed
by way of a cautionary instruction.
The Boxberger case, which Mr. Justice Rehnquist is
familiar with, coming out of the Ninth Circuit, allowed a.
cautionary instruction to be given, which stated completc;
language.

The language in Boxberger was that the jury was told

that the award v/as not taxable, and that therefore the jury
should neither add to nor subtract from the award, because of
this consequence.
That instruction is totally different from the in­
struction tendered in the Lepelt case.

The Liepelt instruction

as tendered by the railroad merely asked to tell the jury that
the award was not subject to taxes.
QUESTION:

Do you think Boxberger is a correct

statement of FELA lav;?
MR, FLEISIIER:

In regard to cautionary, Your Honor,

or in regard to modified gross wages?
QUESTION:

In both?

instruction would be a proper instruction, as was the Domeracki
instruction stating the same thing.

But it must be a complete,

It must not be a part instruction.

QUESTION:

On your theory, each individual judge in

the country is to make his own way on what he thinks is the
best way to do it?
MR. FLEISHER:

As to a cautionary instruction, and

that has been the law —
QUESTION:

As to the admissibility of evidence on

net take-home pay?
MR. FLEISHER:

No, Your Honor, that is an entirely

different issue.
QUESTION:

I wondered whether you are bracketing

them both.
MR. FLEISHER:

No, I am saying that the cautionary

instruction, as has always been — and there is no Federal
appellate court decision changing that —■ has always left
cautionary instructions to the discretion of the trial court,
for good reason

If, in fact, this Court feels that a cautionary

31
instruction should be given, then it should be a complete
cautionary instruction, as that given in Boxberger or Domerack!,
advising both sides of the coin to the jury, that the award
should neither be increased nor decreased because of taxes.
That was not the instruction given in niepelt.
QUESTION:

Well, the trial judge in Liebelt

felt bound

by Illinois Law that you simply couldn’t say anything, in the
exercise of your discretion or otherwise.
MR, FLEISIIER:

True.

And if, in fact, this Court

feels there should be a cautionary, it should be prospective
only, because no case has ever been reversed, State or Federal,
where that type of cautionary instruction was not tendered.
It should have prospective effect only.
QUESTION:

What sort of doctrine is that?

MR. FLEISIIER:

The doctrine in law as to cautionary

instructions, Justice Relinquish, have always been interpreted
as being discretionary with the trial court.

It is a caution

to a jury what to do or not to do,
QUESTION:

33T.it if you find that it was — that the

judge was hampered by an erroneous view of the law in deciding
whether to give a cautionary instruction, you reverse and remand
for a new trial, if you find there was prejudice, don't you?
MR. FLEISIIER:

Yes, sir, Your Honor.

But there is

no evidence here that the judge was hampered, or did not
properly present the lav/, since there are no Federal or ‘Appellate

courts that have ever reversed the failure to give this type of
cautionary instruction.
QUESTION:

What if we reverse it?

MR. FLEISHER:
is that proper?

Is the question:

If you reverse it,

There was no evidence in the case that the

QUESTION:

I don't know if he is right or not, but if

Mr, Trienens is right in suggesting that the jury gave $700,000
on evidence and only would support $350,000, whatever the figures
are, isn’t this a perfect case for applying the rule in this
very case?

If it was done because of the failure to give in­

struction,
MR, FLEISHER:

In two respects.

The Appendix and our

brief show that there were co-Plaintiffs in this matter, that
the Plaintiff Lepelt received the verdict of $775,000»
Was the fireman on this operating crew.

Maynard -—

of $16,500»

He was the brakeman.

That man, in the

evidence of the case, was permanently injured and unable to
ever return to railroad work for the rest of his life.
And so, for Counsel to come here today and assert to
the Court what he feels the jury did in a runaway verdict,
certainly would have no application.

Because here is a co-

Plaintiff, represented by different counsel than myself, who
received a substantially lower verdict than was asked for by
the j ury.

ordinary tort action, under State lav/.

by this Court in 1916.

Your Honor, Kelly was a case decided
And what Kelly merely stated was that

all lump sum av/ards, under the FELA, were to be discounted to
a present cash value.
Our gross wages were, in fact, discounted to a
present cash value.
QUESTION:

But that isn't a discount for the issue

we are talking about.
MR. FLEISHER:

No, Your Honor, that's why I feel that

Kelly is certainly not appropriate in this matter.
QUESTION:

When you have been talking about all these

other States and what they have done, sometimes cases get here

QUESTION:

That is so, Your Honor.

What logic supports the exclusion of

evidence about taxes, logic now, net precedent?

Logic,, Your Honor, revolves around the

fact that, as we know the lav/ today in the vast majority of
Federal and State jurisdictions, gross wages is the proper and

I excluded precedent.

I said never mind

what the states are doing or what other Federal courts do, what
is the logic that supports the exclusion of this very relevant
evidence in ordinary matters of common sense?
MR. FLEISHER:

Several, Your Honor.

The first and

most prominent would be that of the double tax being imposed
upon the injured or deceased party.

The award, if it is to be

reduced, as Your Honor suggests, by estimated future taxes,
brings it down then to a net award.

That net award will be

subject to taxes on the interest on the award that the injured
party will receive.

So, in effect, we are twice taxing the

It is double taxation.

In addition to that —
QUESTION:

Well, couldn't the instruction be tailored

to eliminate that?
MR. FLEISHER:

Well, then in effect the Court is

suggesting that you include the speculative nature, the con­
jecture of taxes, the prolonging of trial by taxes, come down
to a net award, then refuse to tell the jury that the interest
on the award is taxable, taxable as unearned income, as opposed
to earned income, can be taxable as high as a /0% tax bracket,

Because we then come into

a situation where our wages are — or taxes on the wages — are
so insignificant we have done nothing but prolong the jury trial

Yes, Your Honor.

But v/e are contending

But that is a practicality argument more
On principle, these five circuits, following

the McWeeney rule, if it were worth the candle, as you say, they

MB. FLEISHER:

Yes.

And the cases that have followed

McWeeney are all cases in which income has been far more substantial, from years back.

The Leroy case, where they talked

about $16,000, was a decade ago.

We are talking about a wage

earner who earned in '73, twelve years later, substantially
less.

It has no bearing.

McWeeney,

Even if McWeeney was followed, it would

allow Federal courts throughout the cotmtry to set out what is
substantial by way of wages, and what is significant by way of
taxes.

It would lead to a total hodgepodge for individual

judges around the country, to say that, for instance, $20,000
in a city like Washington could be considered not substantial
because of the cost of living here.
QUESTION:

IIow much more of a. hodgepodge is it than

$300,000 bucks for guidance?

the $300,000 is more than guidance.

these are extraneous.
MR. FIEISIIER:
QUESTION:

Taxes?

Well, in reducing the award to present

value,
MR. FLEISHER:

Your Honor, I submit to the Court that

taxes, where they are not significant, do not have any emphasis
or bearing on an award in regard to loss of wages.

The other

elements of damages have not been raised in this case, as to
whether or not they were excessive.

It is almost an impossible

situcition for me, in a limited period of time, to express to the
Court the witnesses who testified as to the type of care,
training, guidance, advice, instruction, that this man gave to
four children in raising them.

reviewing court and ask whether or not that is a hodgepodge,
or that is excessive, without —QUESTION:

MR. FLEISUER:

I used it merely to say that

in the case of modified wages, under McWeeney, that if we
abolish the five circuits who followed the gross wages, and
have only modified, we will have different decisions throughout
»

as to what is reasonable or what is substantial by way of
taxes.
QUESTION:

Certainly you get widely differing results

as to what the value of guidance is, too, don't you?
MR. FLEISHER:

Yes, and that also invades the pro­

vince of a jury, Your Honor.

They can only listen to the

evidence that is presented on that issue, then deliberate as
to that amount.

That amount should not be in question.

The

question is whether or not the wages should be gross wages,
modified gross wages, or net wages.

We claim that gross and

modified gross — We fall under either category because they
were not significant and the taxes were not substantial.
In conclusion, it is the Respondent's position that
her husband, the decedent, at a time of his tragic death, was
a railroad laborer at the low end of the wage and tax scale
in the United States in 1973.

Therefore, the effects of future

taxes on future wages would have been nominal under, again,
majority gross wages or minority modified gross wages.

Also,

there has never been a cautionary instruction that has ever
reversed on this issue.

And, therefore, the failure to give

such a cautionary instruction would not constitute reversible

43

error.
QUESTION:

I don’t understand why you — Have you

said all you want to say about the refusal — about the
cautionary instruction on the award?
MR. FLEISIIER:
QUESTION:

If I may answer a question —

In a nutshell, why is that so damaging to

Plaintiff's case, to have the jury told that your award — the
award is not taxable?
MR. FLEISHER:
The award is not taxable.

That is a half measure, Your Honor.
Finish the instruction, Mr. Justice

White, "therefore, neither add nor subtract to your verdict."
That was not the cautionary that was given in this
case.
QUESTION:

Would you object —

MR. FLEISIIER:

No, Your Honor, we would not object

to a full cautionary instruction.

The award should neither

be added to nor subtracted from on account of taxes.

An in­

struction must be a fair and. proper instruction to both sides.
This was a half instruction in Lepelt.

No instruction that

was given on that basis has ever been sustained by any Federal
court in this country,

Certainly.

And that judgment was reversed, so you

are a little bit misleading when you say no judgment has everbeen reversed,

Well, again, my reading of Boxberger

is that it was reversed for the failure to allow gross wages,
that in regard to the cautionary instruction neither add nor
subtract, that was given and affirmed and given prospective
application to that case forward or any others in the Ninth
Circuit.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF HOWARD J. TRIENENS, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF TIIE PETITIONER
MR. TRIENENS:

Just one item, Catch 22.

Of course, you can't seek an instruction on a matter
as to which there is no evidence,

I am talking now a’-out the

matter of the take-home pay of the decedent, where we weren't
allowed to show what his tax burden was.

And we weren't allowed

to show it not because — I don't know what all this chatter
was about discretion and trial judge — The reason this trial

46

judge didn’t do it is the Illinois courts won't let you tall:
about taxes at all,, balanced, half way, part wav, all the way,
at all.

And that’s wrong.

It is contrary to the standards of

FELA.
Now, we asked about the cautionary instructions.
We asked to talk to this witness aboi.it the taxes the man would
have paid.

We asked to put in evidence.

The judge says —- and

I cite A 74 and 75, and again back to A62, the judge says the
Illinois courts won't let us talk about that.

And it was

decided on that basis.
QUESTION:

How would you come out under McWeeney?

MR. TRIENENS;

On McWeeney and boxberger, which I

think accepts it, we would say that whatever the situation was
with a man who earned $4800 a year, and after a trial it was
regarded as really de miniis and not worth it — in Boxberger
the man, a fireman in the 70s earning from $18,000 to $40,000
projected, our man $17,000 at time of trial to $50,000 projected,
exactly the same.
And in the Second Circuit, which follows McWeeney,
after all, in the Sabena case, it was $1.5,000 to $25,000 pro»
jected.
So we say the McWeeney rule fits this like a glove
in this case.

It would require that this kind of evidence

be received, and if it isn't received require that the judgment
be reversed, which is what we ask.

QUESTIONS

What would you do if someone had made

an assignment of 25% of his wages in advance to some creditor?
And the employer had been notified and he just sent him a check
every month, that employer did.

Would you be claiming that the

damage — Certainly his survivors couldn’t benefit from that
25%
MR* TRIENENS:

That’s right, and that's the way these

folks tried the case, exactly on that method*
QUESTION:

What’s your answer to it?

MR, TRIENENS:

My answer is that if the wife and the

children weren't getting any of the money, if they lost no
contribution, or they lost contribution that was measured by a
smaller than you might expect proportion of his wages, that's
the contribution they lost,
QUESTION:

I would suppose the assignee then would be

one of the plaintiffs.
MR* TRIENENS s

But for the fact that Congress in

putting in the FELA Act for people -QUESTION:
suit if you win*

Maybe United States ought to join in this

They are losing their tax*

MR. TRIENENS:

Oh, no, they are not, because one of

the ideas of a windfall to railroads has that concept which is
wrong, because the railroad still has to run the trains.

It

still has to hire a fireman, and the fireman is paying taxes.
In addition to that, we than have to pay this award, which all

we say ought to be properly measured, to do just what Congress
said, which is to compensate these people for the loss.
Now, the one other item which complicates this, or
the parties try to complicate it, is this double tax, tax on
the tax, tax on interest idea.

That is a totally, totally

separate concept, and would arise if the decedent had had no
taxable income, no income subject to tax. And that's because it
relates to the use of the award.
of single sum damages.

It goes to the whole concept

It goes to the question of whether if

it goes to children and their tax bracket is such they don't
pay it.

And it goes, as I mentioned earlier, to on what basis

do these folks calculate the discount rate?

What they love to

do is use a low rate because that produces a high award.

They

use a low rate and they mix in some municipal bond interest,
which if you actually invest it that way wouldn't be taxable.
But now they want it both ways.

They can't have it both ways.

But the point I am making is that this tax on tax,and
what you do with the award after you get it and what you want to
assume about it, has nothing in the world to do with the
question we brought before this Court.
case.

It would arise in any

It is a totally separate issue, as Judge Friendly recog­

nized in HcWeeney, because he never said it was a totally off­
set.

Otherwise, he said, if a fellow earns enough you ouglit

to consider his taxes.

That's all we are saying.

In this day and age, people earn enough, i t is

substantial, and you ought to consider it, under traditional
rules of the FtLA damages*
Thank you, sir.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Gentlemen,

The case is submitted*
