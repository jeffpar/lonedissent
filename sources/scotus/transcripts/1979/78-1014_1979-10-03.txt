ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELINOR H. STILLMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
.

MRS, STILLMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, mid say it

please the Court:
This case is here on the government’s petition for
review of a decision of the Third Circuit construing 28 U.S.C.
•f

2401(b), the statute of limitations provision of the Federal
Tort Claims Act.

Under that provision, a tort claim against

the United States is barred if It is not presented in writing
to the appropriate federal agency within two years after the
claim accrues.
The question In this case is whether a elaira for

Li

vv

medical malpractice under the act accrues when the claimant
knows both the existence and the cause of his injury even If
he *loe8 not know that the injury amounted to medical naglii;

gencet

..

The facts are not here in dispute.

The respondent

entered a V«A. hospital in April 1968 and was treated for an
infection of the femur of his right leg.

Treatment consisted

of a deep surgical incision followed by treatment by drugs.

'i

it

including irrigation of the wound with a solution of neomycin
sulfate for about 13 days.
In June, the respondent noticed a ringing In his ears
and some loss of hearing.

An ear specialist whom he consulted

in August diagnosed his condition as bilateral rerve deafness.
Another ear specialist, Dr. Joseph Sataloff, whom he visited
in November, wrote for his VA records and discovered that he
had been treated with neomycin.

In January 1969a Dr.

Sataloff told the respondent that it was highly possible or
^v'1 words to that effect that the neomycin treatment had caused

his deafness.

■ •fi

In April 1969s the respondent who had been receiv­

ing VA disability benefits for a back injury filed a claim

seeking increased benefits for the injury to his hearing. He
if : asserted in this claim that his deafness resulted from medi.'-tfc

opinion as the basis for this assertioh.
'£
A VA board of physicians denied the claim,, stating

ft

;

'f 'i

among other things that the treatment — that the deafness
i

was not caused by the neomycin treatment and that the treat­
ment was not negligent.

The respondent vigorously disputed

this denial of causation over the next several years,
letters and claims and explaining why it was caused by
neomycin in the course of appeal and remand proceedings
before the VA respecting the disability benefits claim.

writing

5
In May 1971, while those proceedings were going on,
the VA sent him a report, a supplemental statement of the case
that included a report by a VA investigatos5 and this report
stated that one of the doctors whom respondent had consulted
had said that his deafness might be attributable to his pre­
vious occupation as a machinist.

The respondent confronted

the doctor who had allegedly made this statement, Dr. Soma,
and Dr. Soma denied the statement attributed to him and told
the respondent that neomycin had caused his deafness and that
the VA doctors should not have given him that drug.
The Court of Appeals, affirming the District Court,
held that the respondent’s tort claim accrued for the first
time at this time, June 1971.

So

hia written statement of

claim filed In January 1973 was timely under the act.

The

court’s holding is predicated on the view that a malpractice
claim under the Federal Tort Claims Act does not accrue until
a claimant knows or should know causation, damages, existence
of a duty of care and breach of the duty of care.
QUESTION:

And you say it is the event, do you?

MRS. STILLMAN:
Your Honor.

No, we don’t say it is the event.

We accept that in cases where you didn’t know you

were injured, that it would begin at notice that you were in­
jured by medical treatment.
QUESTION:

The event of known injury.

MRS. STILLMAN:

Knowledge of the known injury, yes.

For reasons that I am about to explains we submit
that the —
QUESTION:

And the cause you would concede?

MRS. STILLMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Not whether or not there was negligence

but —
MRS. STILLMAN:
QUESTION:

Of course.

— what art or episode was the causation.

MRS. STILLMAN:

Exactly.

As soon as they know the

nexus between, causation between injury and treatment or should
know —
QUESTION:

Right.

MRS, STILLMAN:

— we say that it accrues at that

point,
QUESTION:

There Is no Issue In this eases is there*

of concealment, fraudulent concealment or any other kind of
concealment?
MRS. STILLMAN:

No, Your Honor, unless you assume

that the VA's denial that neomycin caused it or their denial
of liability -QUESTION:

Is there any claim of concealment or

fraudulent —
MRS. STILLMAN:

No, I don•t believe so.

The VA be-

lieved up until litigating — they eventually conceded that

7
there was evidence that meomyein caused the injury and for
that reason gave him disability benefits in 1975.

But during

the time that he was litigating this question before the VA,
there was no suggestion that the VA was sitting on secret
knowledge that in fact —
QUESTION:

They were not hiding anything from him.

MRS, STILLMAN:

No, no.

I don't believe there is

any claim of that.
There are complaints that they didn't send complete
records to Dr. Sataloff, they only send a letter saying •—
but there is no real claim here about concealment or fraudo
Our basic contention in tils case is a simple one.
When a person knows that he has been injured and that his
injury has been caused by a particular course of medical
treatmentj he is on notice to commence inquiries into the
possibility that the treatment may have been negligent.

The

limitations period in a statute of limitations is the time
set aside for making such inquiries and for filing suit if
answers to the inquiries reveal the basis for legal action.
In the case of the Federal Tort Claims Act, of course, you
don't have to file your lawsuit within the two years, you
file merely a written statement of claim with the federal
agency, including a statement of the amount certain in damages
that you are seeking.
When the statute of limitations operates to bar an

8
apparently meritorious claim* the result will often strike a
court and certainly a plaintiff as harsh, but there are none­
theless sound and long recognised policy reasons supporting
such a result.
Our review of the legislative history of the Federal
Tort Claims Act statute of limitations indicates that Congress
enacted and has retained the provision at issue here because
it accepts the soundness of those reasons.

Statutes of

limitations exist because it is the judgment of legislatures
that litigation of stale claims is undesirable.

With the

passage of time, reliable relevant evidence may disappear
and it is thought unjust to subject an individual suit on even
a possibly meritorious claim many years after the incident
giving rise to its when he is likely to find it difficult to
collect evidence for his defense.
By barring even meritorious claims after an arbi­
tral5:/ period of time, the statute of limitations induces
persons with possible legal claims to investigate and liti%

gate them promptly.

One cannot expect a person to commence

an investigation, however, until he knows of something to in­
vestigate.

That is the reason that this Court in Urie v.

Thompson held that the action of the railroad worker against
his employer under the Federal Employer5s Liability Act was
not barred when he sued within the prescribed limitations
period as measured from the time he first discovered that he

9
hac silicosis.

It was not measured froza the date many years

before In the early symptoraless stages as his disease began.
Not until he knew he had the disease- could he begin asking
whether it could have been avoided by differently designed
or maintained railroad equipment and whether the railroads
had a duty to provide such equipment.

To hold that the

statute had run before he was on notice to make such Inquiries
would penalise the worker for what is called blameless ignor-

i
j

anee because he could not know what was inherently unknowable,
the harm that was inherently unknowable.

In this case.
QUESTION:

Who is with you?

MRS. STILLMAN:

We say the Eighth Circuit and the

Ninth Circuit are with us , Your* Honor, but we would say that
in fact the Kubrick case is the first case that really
squarely presents this issue because Brxdgford and some of
:l

those other cases can be understood as cases where the plain­
tiffs might have been confused about the nature of the injury
and: the connection with causation.

For examples in one of

i|r- those cases, the plaintiff was suffering an injury; which for
|

a while he confused with an automobile accident and was not

mi

fully aware, of course, and the court thought in fact that it
resulted from an operation that he had.

QUESTION:

Did the government try to bring any of

these cases that were against you here on cert?

MRS. STILLMAN:

We have not tried to bring those

cast3, Your Honor, but I think this case presents the issue

l! t:

much more plainly because we have here so clear an acknowledge

mert that the person knew causation and it can*t be Inter”

?

preted in any way as a case that might come under a construe-

;;;■ticn of the rule that the claim accrues at the time that you
knew injury and its cause.
QUESTION:

How do you understand your opponents to

apply the rule in terms of knew or should have known that it
constituted malpractice?

Do they have to take a lawyer’s —

be advised by a lawyer or what?
MRS. STILLMAN:

We understand them to be interpret­

ing the rule rather broadly and we think that the courts
below* although they claim that this had limits and was very
narrow, we think that in fact it is really a very broad rule.
The court said that one reason

the District Court said

that it vras really only recognising a rebuttals presumption
here.

They said that there is a presumption that when you

know knowledge and that you have knowledge of injury and Its
cause, that you would be on notice, that there would be
possible negligence but that this may be rebutted in some
instances, and they said that in this case it could fee re||; butted because the ease was technically complex.

And I may

The government says that when you have gone into a

hospital for a leg operation and they have given you a drug
that makes you deaf, you are on notice that something might
have — someone might have erred and you are on notiae to
check that out.
QUESTION;

Mrs. Stillman» let me just be sure about

what you just now said.

MRS. STILLMAN:

You are just saying it doesn’t make

QUESTION:

That wasn’t ray question.

My question was

when it was given to him, did he know it?
MRS. STILLMAN:

Oh, at the time.

No, Your Honor, I

don't think the record shows that he knew what the drug was
at that time.
QUESTION:

So how could he -— he couldn't have

assumed it until somebody told him, could he?
MRS. STILLMAN:

Your Honor, for that reason we say
• V

the statute did not start to run until the following January.
We are not arguing that the statute started to run when he
was in the hospital or even when he first noticed deafness.
We think that the rule that this Court applies in
11

Urie and which was taken over by the Fifth Circuit in the
l'

Quinton, case is a basically reasonable rule if it is inter­
preted with the limits which we understand it to have, be­
cause we think it is reasonable that one would not bo on
notice to investigate

possible negligence until he knows he

has been injured.
We submit that the construction given the statute
by the Court of Appeals, however, would be wrong as to any

1?
statute of limitations that lacks a tolling provision to per­
mit the kind of delay which the Court of Appeals would, permit,

'jf
And where the limitations provision is in this suit, a con­
dition on a waiver of sovereign Immunity and hence a pro­
vision to be strictly construed, we think that the construc­
tion is clearly impermissible.
The courts below, I have noted, suggested that the
rule was quite narrow.

They said that it was technically

complex and that would be one reason for limiting the rule
here.
They also said that because the YA denied causation
'l|
f

and negligence, this was a reason for saying that he would
'

i
not be on notice.

The denial of negligence, of course, Is

irrelevant where there is a finding by the court that he
knew — the denial of a finding of causation is irrelevant
where there is a finding by the court that he knew that the
neomycin had caused his deafness and, as I say, the Court
of Appealsf rule is predicated on that un
And as to the denial of liability^ we would say that
in technically complex cases of the sort posited by the Court
of Appeals here, a denial of liability by someone who is
confronted with someone demanding damages for his injury is
to be expected and not an excuse for ceasing any investiga­
tions.

We will concede, of course, that the court made no

finding, although the plaintiff was not deterred by their

18
denials of causation he was somehow deterred by their eonelu­
sory denials of liability.
1!

Finally, the courts below relied on the fast that

;li

none of the physicians that he consulted ever spontaneously

>i

advised him that neomycin treatment was medically negligent.
This 3 however, is not logically a factor^ supporting the con­
clusion that the respondent did not and could not in the
|:;
h;

exercise of reasonable diligence have known that the neomycin
treatment was negligent.

jj‘

f

It is itself a legal conclusion

that the respondent had no duty to ask physicians or lawyers

, v

about the possibility of negligence once he knew his deafness
had been caused by neomycin.

The Court of Appeals is simply-

using the conclusion in support of itself.
The respondent begs the question in a similar
manner when he. argues in his brief at pages 14 end 15 that
he terras a conspiracy of silence among physicians and
difficulties in obtaining access to medical records make it

■ IS
f

ii'U
rfi fl

fjiii

unreasonable to hold that a layman is on notice o;f possible

negligence when he knows only that a course of medical treat)

merit has harmed him.
j
r
If as we submit the limitation period begins run-i

1

ning at the time the claimant gains knowledge of the nexus
in treatment and injury., it is irrelevant whether physicians
are unduly reluctant to accuse each other of malpractice,
The respondent’s complaint is more logically understood as a

19
contention that problems in obtaining medical testimony and
in gaining access to records make the investigation of
medical negligence a long and difficult task with the result
that a proper claim cannot be prepared in the time allotted
by the statute.
But the remedy for this problem, if the problem ex
Ists, Is not to devise a rule that relieves the claimant of
any duty to inquire into possible negligence but to extend
the limitations periods under the Tort Claims Act and a
remedy such as that, of course, may only fee governed by

naver believed that there was malpractice and he so said in

QUESTION:

Well, is his belief the controlling test?

MR. KTJBY:

It is a fact that the trial court who

H
takes the evidence — which I submit, Mr. Chief Justice
Burger, must be both a subjective and an objective test —
in making this determination as to when the cause of action
acrrues, and I would submit that it must be balanced, it must
be balanced with what was the harm to the government.
QUESTION:

Well, that sounds like the equitable

doctrine of Latches rather than the statute of limitations
which has been Imposed by the Federal Tort Claims Act.
MR. KUBY:

But if the legislative history says on

the one hand we want to have — we want to give the people
of this country their day in court, but we also have to

27

balance Itp that was part of the legislative history.

And In

this case there was absolutely no prejudice whatsoever be­
cause —

1

QUESTION:

'

Do you think the legislative history in­

tended to amend the Federal Tort Claims Act to substitute a
doctrine of Latches for the two-year statute of limitations
which it virtually enacted?
MR. KUBY:

No.

I think the legislative history In­

dicates that a person who is one year from, elate of accrual *—
that was two years from date of accruals and that was to be
interpreted by this Courtf that is the duty of this Court,

of the Defense Department of this country which provide

under the regulations concerning the Federal Tort Claims Act
in dealing with accrual,under the Federal Tort Claims Act it
says s,except In medical malpractice cases, a claim accrues

ji'i

j

on the date on which the alleged wrongful act or omission

28
results

in some actionable injury or damage to the claimant.

In medical malpractice cases, accrual Is postponed until such
time as the claimant reasonably discovers or reasonably
should have discovered the act or omissions which are
alleged to be wrongful.
Now, that is what the federal government says for
the Department of the Army in Its regulations at the present
time.
QUESTION:

Well, that Is their position in this

MR. KUBY:

Their position in this case is that -—

case, too.

If I might —
QUESTION:

If I understand it.

MR. KUBY:

If I understand it, Mr. Justice Stevens

--- is that the mere knowledge of the happening, not the
wrongful acts —»
QUESTION:

No, it Is the harm plus the causation,

you have to know what happened and why It happened but not
know If It invaded any legal right, that separates It.
MR. KUBY:

That separates us, but I think that the

reading of this regulation, as the Seventh Circuit makes
note of It, because It also cites a regulation from the air­
ports which talks about the Hunger-ford case out of the Ninth
Circuit, and says these two departments of the United States
government aren’t talking about the same thing.

29
QUESTION:

What ia the citation of that case or the

date of It — it is the Seventh Circuit, and what is the
caption of it?
MR. KUBY:

The caption is 599 F„ 2d 823, decided

June 12, 1979.

QUESTION:

823.

Thank you.

QUESTION:

Is that the opinion by Judge Tuttle or

was his the earlier one?

MR. KUBY:

This was the opinion by Harlington Wood,

QUESTION:

I am surprised you donffc refer to the

Seventh Circuit case written by Judge Tuttle where he con­
i' strued his earlier Fifth Circuit —
MR. KUBY:

That is DeWitt.

MR. KUBY:

That is DeWitt.

QUESTION:

MR. KUBY:

I think it was Judge Tuttle.

That is in our brief,

sir,
r

It was

Wisdom, I’m correct, sir.
QUESTION:

Wisdom.

MR. KUBY:

Yes.

And Harlington Wood dissented?

In thi3 case, however, in dealing

" with the situation, he says he put medical malpractice cases
in a separate category.

30
QUESTION:

The government agrees with that.

There

is no fight about that.
MR. KUBY:

That's right.

The only fight is what

has to be included in the doctrine of accruals is it reason­
able in language without the medical knowledge to start the
wheels rollings or is it reasonable and should it be for the
District Court judge, based upon all the circumstances, to
make that finding which is done here and under the ernes of
this Court if affirmed by the Court of Appeals it is rarely
if ever explored by this Court.
QUESTION:

By the way, do you interpret the Ashley

case in the Ninth Circuit to be contrary to your position?
MR. KUBY:

The Ashley case again took up the posl-

*

fcion from just knowing injury.
tv

QUESTION:

Well, didn’t it say knew or should have

j

• V.

known in that ease, that he knew or should have known at that
time?

That is all you are contending for, Isn’t it?

1

MR. KUBY:

I am submitting, sir, that the Eighth

I;

and Ninth Circuit both adopted this limited discovery rule
that whoever the party may be, it might be a man with a
fifth grade education, a lawyer with so many years of educa­
tion, it starts to run when he knows of that injury.

All the

other
QUESTION:

And the causation.

MR. KUBY:

Not as to the causation.

All the other

31
circuits say that is not enough to open up and to give
knowledge to the layman who is injured*
QUESTION:

1 Would you draw a different rule

depending on the awareness of the individual, thus if the
injured person viere, say, an elder laryngologist, he might
have a shorter period of limitation than your client?
MR. KUBY:

Well, Mr. Justice Blackmun, in the

1

Sanders case, decided by the District Court here in
Washington, said when you are dealing with a nurse, yes, she
: has special knowledge and we take that into account and, we

say that when she knew about her injury because of that

So you have a different result then,

whether he is less than a high sehool graduate, as you have
described him, or one who has had two years of college, you

32
MR. KUBY:

You might have a different result based

upon the knowledge acquired by the trial Judge in assessing
the facts of the case.

And as the courts have said, these

are to be dealt with on an ad hoc basis, accrual is to be
dealt with on an ad hoc basis, based upon the circumstances.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Do you have anything

further, Mrs. Stillman?
ORAL ARGUMENT OP ELINOR H. STILLMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER ~~ REBUTTAL
MRS. STILLMAN:

First, with respect fcc the Depart­

ment of Defense regulation that was quoted from the Steel
ease, I would say that that is simply another way of stating
the Quinton rule, and we would interpret either one the same
1 way as consistent with the position we are taking here.
|>

QUESTION:

Well, I may not have heard it correctly,

but as I understood that regulation, it was that the poten­
tial plaintiff has to discover the wrongful act —
MRS. STILLMAN:

It said when he has knowledge of

the acts alleged to be wrongful.
QUESTION;

Alleged to be wrongful.

MRS. STILLMAN:

Well, the Quinton rule says when he

discovers the acts constituting the malpractice, and we would
interpret eithex5 one to mean when you discover the acts which
turn out to be provable.
QUESTION:

I was Just wondering if he had to have

knowledge of the wrongfulness of the acts.
MRS. STILLMAN:

Yes.

Right.

We think the distinc­

tion — it doesn’t say discover knowledge of the wrongful -QUESTION:

How did this man find out that there was

a possibility that he was given this drug in the wrong way?
MRS. STILLMAN:

Well, we say he was on notice to

34
start finding out in January of 1969 or April of 1969 at the
latest.
QUESTION:

On the basis of —

MRS. STILLMAN:

And whether he found out or not

during the ten years
QUESTION:

On the basis of ~~ what put him on notice
p

of that?
MRS. STILLMAN:

Put him on notice simply because he

went into the hospital and was harmed by a treatment and knew
himself to have been harmed by the —
QUESTION:

So the best thing to do from now on —

MRS. STILLMAN:
QUESTION:

Is to consult ~

— is to sue the day you come out.

MRS. STILLMAN:

I don’t think file suit but I think

investigate the basis fox'1 a possible suit.
QUESTION:

You should investigate the possibility —

you assume that the medical authorities of the United States
government are negligent?
MRS. STILLMAN:

No, we make no such assumption and

we assume

Well, I don’t think anybody should.

Do

you?
MRS. STILLMAN:

Most people are not harmed by or

are not made deaf by ~~
QUESTION:

But that is what the respondent says, he

35
trusted them.
MRS. STILLMAN:

Well, we think that the decision

would rest on different issues.
QUESTION:

Mrs. Stillman, going back to the stand­

ard for just a moment that Mr. Justice Stewart asked you
about —
MRS. STILLMAN:
QUESTION tt

Yes.

— in the Urie cas®9 which Mr. Justice

Rutledge wrote3 he said the critical time is the specified
period of time after notice of the invasion of legal right.
MRS. STILLMAN:
QUESTION:

Your Honor, we would —

Do you accept that language?

MRS. STILLMAN:

Yes.

We would Interpret that to

mean that he has notice of the possible Invasion

once he

understands —
QUESTION:

No, not possible but notice of the in­

vasion of legal rights which — doesn’t that Imply knowledge
of a possible breach of duty?
MRS. STILLMAN:

Well, of coursel in Urie they

weren’t focusing on the question that is Involved here.
QUESTION:

But you did rely on the Urie case.

MRS. STILLMAN:

We do rely on Urie because we think

that on the facts, they are similar to the facts that we
say should put you on notice, and I suppose we just Interpret
that phrase too Implicitly in —

36
QUESTION:

You say notice of the invasion of legal

Fights should be paraphrased to say notice of the harm and
its cause?
MRS. STILLMAN:

Yes.

Yes, I think so.

i’

Also as to the YA standard which h© says is negli­
gence, I simply would refer the Court to the YA regulations
and that regulation is printed at page 4, Footnote 2 of our
brief, and it refers to —* it says compensation is not pay■' able for either the usual or the unusual after-results of

And

1

obviously this is a different standard from an error in

I T

■I So it is a fault standard but It is not the .medical malprac*

I:

.

•i tic© standard,

%

Finally, I simply would observe that the respon2 nt}s explanation ©flow the rule would work, how accrual
would be determined under his test would simply leave us
with no rule at all.

There is really no point in having a

fixed time if it is going to be some kind of'balancing test
where you consider the state of -mind and the state of educa­
tion of the plaintiff and whether the government was

37
prejudiced, and so on*
We would agree with Mr. Justice Rehnquist that if
Congress had intended any such test they simply would have
■

said apply the doctrine of Latches and they clearly have not
done that here.
Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
