one of the factors mentioned in this Court's decision in
Hendo;;;a-Mafti'.'.es.

In that case the Court held that aa

who departed the country to avoid military service was
criminal and one of the factors mentioned in keadoza-Hartines
that could ho looked to in discerning congressional intent
is to

regulated by the osensibly regulatory or civil sanction i.
otherwise made criminal.

he agree that this can .be a relevant

factor but in this case it happens to cut the other wny,
because this Court has said on a number of occasions the
Congress — as it has under the tar laws and others;

for

example — can attach both criminal and civil sanctior. ;
the same conduct.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN JONES s ESQ. ,
OK BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
HR, JOKESi

Mr. Chief Justice* and nay it please

the Court:

1 would like to very briefly rosposc to certain
questions that were asked of Mr. Kneedler and perhaps give an
answer slightly ir. variance with that given by him.
With respect to the facts I believe that the
Government left out two important considerations that the
Court should boar in mind.
Number one, there was no evidence in the court helow
that Ward or any of his employees were responsible for the
spill that occurred in this sase.;

Ths Act of Congress makes

the penalty imposed on the ! asis of strict liability.

Mr.

Justice Stevens, • for example, as':ed the question might the
penalty he imposed.

Thera is no "might” about it.

The

penalty is automatically in' oaed in every situation regard™
less of fault, regardless of <jf£«an-up* when there is an oil
spill.

And the penalty is imposed against the owner or t: 2

operator, not against the person responsible for the spill.
QUESTI OHIt is a stricter standard than .the law
that requires one to file an income tax return?
MR a JOKES;
QUESTION:
MRo JOKES:

Yes.

As appliusd in this case it is,

Kell, generally speaking.
Yes, sir, under the statutory scheme.

Let me explain why.
Your Honor raised the question of Helvering v.
Mitchell.

There is a critical difference.

The information

supplied in Helvering v. Mitchell, which was rat a seifincrimination cane in any event, was essentially neutral.
And that case turned on another question.

But the Supremo

Court earlier had decided in Sullivan v. United States
that t ie filing of an income tax return did not violate t .a
Fifth Amen date r t clause dealing with self-incrimination,
*

because the information was essentially neutral.

But Mr.

Justice Holmes in his ©pinion pointed out that'if the
information called for by filing the return would incriminate
the taxpayer he need not provide that information.

QUESTIONs

But In EelvsringJast.veo Brandeis

fraudulent attempts to evade the to.:*: Congress imposes
sanctions.

to speak to.,the information is essentially neutral,

pay the tax.

All h© has to d© is

He re, though - if you .are not responsible for

the oil spill you still have to pay the penalty, even if
you take every effort to avoid an oil spill as General Motors
did in United States v. General Motors.

She Coast Guard

still assessed them a fine of $1,200 which the District Court
cut to $.1,

The court inquired of counsel concerning Byers

v, California and there are some critica?, differences in
that case and this one.
Byers there are at least.

As I read the Court * a lecision in
This Court in finding that tho

California hit and run statutu, so-called hit and run statute
did not violate the Fifth Amendment,

It found first of -all

that the mere possibility of incrimination was i a n u f f i.c 5. @ v. t

Kow, lot us contrast that with here.

Here > having

an oil spill is an offense and that is the word used by
Congress.

It is tva offenso for which a civil .penalty is

imposed.
Humber two, the report is clearly incriminating
because it is on the basis of the report that the fine is
assessed.

civil penalty. But this Const and ths State courts

and the lower Federal courts, going bad to the English
system, have consistently applied the self-incrimination
clause of the Firth Amendment and the Fourth Amendment
guarantees in actions to collect civil penalties.

And that

was the ruling of this Court in Boyd v. United Statos which
has been reaffirmed either implicitly or — implicitly in
Lees v. Unitoc". States, Hspner v. United ntatae, P.agan v.
United States and in Footnote 3 of Helvering v* Mitchell
and U.S. v. 0. r>.

Coin and Currency and .in one 1353 Plymouth

Sedan because the Court said in Boyd that an action te
collect a civil, penalty — in that ease §1,000 — and the
statute, clearly said that it was non-criminal, this Court
nevertheless found that the penalty was, in effect, quasiK

criminal-

.Andtit required, if the Court will recall, in

Boyd — this was as X recall a statute involving an alien —
that you had to furnish- certain reports and information t©
th® Governments and if you did not furnish them, the penalty
Would b& assessed.

And the Court said, rightly so, that that

was a violation of the Fifth Amendment se1ffin crimination
clause even though it was denominated r. on-criminal*
Mow, the Government' in its reply brief has taker
issue with ous: history and I would just like to call to the
Court•a attention very briefly that each of the authorities

cited by the Govonmaat. beginning vita De m Wi gruar • at
Section 2256 of Volume 8» adopts our position that actions
to collect civil penalties can violate the self-iucrininstloa
clause of the Fifth Amendment.

The same position is taker, - in

Greealaaf on Evidence, Taylor on Evidence and Mr- Joseph
Story’s Commentary cm Equity Pleading.

What the Government

says ia that this rule is net a constitutional rule, it is
a rule of equity.

But it overlooks the fact,as discussed in

some length in LooaarcS Levy’s classic The Origin of the Fifth
Amendment, that in fact the Founding Fathers, the State
constitutional conventions, the first Congress then it passed
the Fifth Amendment had in r.iad these civil penalties which
had been abused; and that the early cassa make it clear that
they were given the constitutional protection .against the
self“incrircinatioa' clause.

'And, as 1 indicated, that has

been the posit ior cf this Court, this Court has consistently
applied .the--p-rotectioa of the Fourth Amendment and the self”
incrimination cla ':of the Fifth Amendment ia actions to
collect fines'., penalties and forfeitures.

But, as I indicated, oven if the Court

did not have that history before it, it is clear that this;
particular statutory schema is punitive beyond any question.
In the first placa it is not referred to in any other way
other than a penalty,

And this Court has held repeatedly

in U.S. v- LeFranka, U.S. v. Tex~Tow, One 1958 Plymouth
Sedan and U.S. v. Piatura that penalties are imposed for
punishment, whether they are criminal penalties or civil
penalties.

In this particular case it was quite a mall's
and then cut to

'2S0.

§§C0

But the statute as presently written

authorises a ;:ivil penalty of up to a quarter of a ail lion
dollars.
Number three, the exact same conduct, the esaet

So the same conduct here 'ia ale©

The action that is referred to here is called an

offonts; Congress makes it an offense to spill oil or for

that

ttebe an corner or operator wborc: oil is spilled,

again showing the punitive nature»
And if there ware any other question a; out it
involved, we have cited on page 60 of oar brief from page 3
of a Senate retort that the whole purport of passing this
bill, or the original bill, the 19?j Act, was to punish oil
spillors.

So when we combino in a statutory network taca

phrases as penalty, offense, strict liability.- and punish'»
aieat, it is clear that what we have' here is a punitive and
not a remedial statute as this Court —• or at least some ©£
the members of this Court considered in Kennedy v. Mendosa**
Martinas.

I wouldn't think, counsel, that striet

liability really helped you, because it cuts out all notion

strict liability would cut in favor of the civil provision.

whether this is a crine or a civil assessed penalty.
l:Oo JOS.Sd:
The Gdyer

-t •

of intent o:: scienter.

There is a unique feature about this.
to have it doth ways on the

lios

It is rot supposed to bo a factor

.

but yet in the Coast Guard regulations it is a faetor.

That

was a faetor troublesome to the Tenth Circuit in its opinion
and they treated that at soma length.

But in addition to the

factors that 3: have already mentioned that I think clearly
show it is punitive, what convinced the Tenth Circuit
uaniraously that this was a proceeding within the Fifth
Amendment were the factors that the Coast Guard used.

Beeaasa

the Tenth Circuit said, "Look, if the factors to be considered
in assessing this penalty are for aoa-punitiv®, remedial
regulatory purposes, then this penalty — or this proceeding
may not he a criminal et.se within the meaning of the Fifth
Amendment.
"On the other hand, if looking at these factors we
find that they are not related to the regulatory goal that
the Congress has put forward" in the preamble to the Act,"
then they clearly are punitive."
PiiC the Court went down and looked at each of those
factors and pulled out fror. the Coast Guard regulations them­
selves.

For orarrple5 the Coast Guard considera the gravity

of a violation, the prior history, the person — the owner/
operator.

It considers the effect of the fine on his business.

St considers- how large his business is.

But at the fine' it

expressly would not under any circumstances consider the
clean-up effort of the operator or the fact that all of the
oil had been rezaoved.

34

bow, the Tenth. Circuit said that man you .look at
that it is clear that what Congress intended

ora «as a

punitive penalty and that it simply was attempting to have
the hammer to beat over the head of the oil spiller in ah
attempt to clean up the water.

T.oxr. one thing that 1 tfciul: Che Court might wish
to consider is that the Tenth Circuit, in oar opinion
appropriately so,, decision does not adversely affect the
enforcement of this Act.

The Circuit carved out a use

immunity provision and it ©imply said this, that any
information supplied by s.n owner or operator who is non­
corporate cannot be used against him in assessing the
penalty.
QUESTION:

But Congress had already carved out a

quits different use immunity provision, hadn't it?

a criminal proceeding.

not apply to any corporation, as is obvious because corporations

MR» JONES;

Mr. Justice White, this Court has

sever held that actions to collect civil penalties, even -if
they are quasi-criminal> involve the right to a jury ferial.
In fact the federal courts have' specifically ruled otherwise.
QUESTION s

I know, but how —- what is the theory

of saying this is a crimina." proceeding for purposes of tka
Fifth Amendment and not for the Sixth?
MRo JONES:

If we examine the cases closely what

emerges to us, that the teaching of the case is just this:
that the self™incrimination clause of the Fifth Amendment has
a very high priority in oar scheme of ordered liberty and
that we are going — I mean the courts are going to protest
that and give it a greater breadth than v?e would otherwise
enumerate in first te:
exactly what Justice Brandeis said in Footnote 3 to

The Government advanced an argument

is that

So if the Court upheld the position of the Tenth

vie have in our brief at some length discussed -the
Kennedy v. Mendo::uv'Martinas case.

Quit© frankly we believe

that the factors used there are ambiguous and that Factors 1,
2 and 3 go either way.

We say however that Factors 4, 5, 6

and 7 point toward this being a punitive statute and that
was the reasoning of the Tenth Circuit in its opinion,

Xn tlia final analysis we bottom our position upon
this Court’s ruling in Boyd and that a reading of Kennedy v.
Londona-Martiness and the statutory history and t a

; ; fcv.tory

construction cleanly show that this is a punitive statuta»
Now, the argument may fee made that this is not a
criminal case ia the sense that Mr. Ward was not arrested.- fee
wasn*t indicted by a grand jury and therefore,

a® the Govern-

ment says, it is etear by stipulation — not by stipulation,
but it is clear from reading the statute that the selfincrimination clause doesn’t apply here.

But this Court has

said in Cl?.man v. united States that tbo clause -- oacniny thi

can only be that a person shall not be compelled to ba a
witness against himself in criminal prosecutions against hi my­
self.

The reason for that of course is that until the

pott-Civil War period in Federal criminal eases a defendant
could not even be a witness in a criminal case* either for
e

rule1 ia most State prosecutions at the tine the b'ifth
Amendment teas adopted.
if we go down the history of the Fifth Arne a time at
before this Court, this Court has defined the words "criminal
case” which after all are the most important words in this
case, to have a foreader meaning than simply in a situation
whore an individual has been indicted hy a grand jury sad
forced to stand trial.

And of course the loading case is that

respect is Boyd v. United States, although there are ethers.
In the final analysis, Boyd nays that the mischief
against which the Fifth Amendment is the;:» - to protect appears

There is a natural concern hy everyone
