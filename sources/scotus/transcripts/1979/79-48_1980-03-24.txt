MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

We will hear arguments

first this morning in No. 79-^8, Andrust Secretary of the
Interior v. Glover Construction Company.
Mr„ Levander, you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. LEVANDER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. LEVANDER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may if

please the Court:
This case is Here on the government’s petition
to- review- a decision of the United States Court of Appeals
for

Tenth Circuit.

The focal point of this case; is

the so-called Buy Indian Act.
brief.

The act itself is quit®

It authorises the Secretary of the Interior in­

sofar as may be practicable to employ Indian labor and
to ms.ee purchases of Indian Industry in the open market.
The Secretary has delegated his authority under
the act to the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Bureau in
turn has promulgated a detailed policy statement concern­
ing Buy Indian contracting.
The Buy Indian program :1s fairly narrow in
scope.

It pertains only to BIA procurement and that; by

definition pertains to the welfare of Indians. Indian
tribes and Indian lands.

The policy statement; directs the local BIA con­
tracting officer where practicable to first ascertain
that there is a qualified 100 percent Indian owned con­
tractor capable of filling the contracting need.

If there

is more than one such firm in the normal competitive area*
whatever the contracting need is,, then the BIA officer is
directed to arrange competitive bidding among the various
Indian firms.

If there is only one such qualified firm,

then the BIA officer is authorised to negotiate a contract
with that firm at a fair and reasonable price.

And if

there is no such qualified firm or if no firm is willing
to fulfill the contracting need at a fair and reasonable
price, then BIA turns the contract over to open competitive
bidding.
QUESTION:

Mr. Levander, are you going to cover

the chronology of the statutes and the regulations some
time in your argument?
MR. LEVANDER:

Yes, I will attempt to.

Now, the controversy in this case centers on a
five-mile stretch of Indian logging road that cuts through
Indian trust lands in Pushmataha County, Oklahoma.

In

1977i in accordance with the BIA program I just describee,
the EIA contacted three qualified Indian firms in the
normal competitive area and asked each to submit a bid.
The respondent, which is a non-Indian corporation, was

5
nOG

to bid and subsequently the contract was awarded

t/O Indian Nations Construction Company,
owned by three Indians»

b

company wholly

The price that it was awarded at

was considered tG be fair and reasonable both by BIA and
the National Highway Administration.
QUESTION:

When did. the Secretary first start

construing the Buy Indian Act to cover construction of
roads ?
MR. LEVANDER:

I think that as we detailed in

our brief that the earlier reports — the Buy Indian Act
itself was enacted in 1910.

However, suitable language

appeared in a series of appropriations acts between 188*5
exsd 1?08, almost identical language.

And the temporary

administrative reports, that is reports that were required
by Congress to be filed by the Secretary of the Interior
and the Commissioner of Indian Affairs reflected all
during this period, including 1910 and thereafter, that
the Commissioner of Indian Affairs and. the Secretary con­
sidered the Buy Indian Act and the preference.' contained
in the act to apply not only to goods, as respondent
argues, but also construction of all kinds.
For example, the 1908 appropriations act
specifically expressly applied the preference to irriga­
tion construction and a road on the Hooper Valley Indian
Reservation and it —

6
QUESTION:

That was before the Buy Indian Act

was even enacted,
MR. LEVANDER:

There was a predecessor act

which has the same language and therefore should be con­
strued similarly, and in 19.10 when the act was enacted
the Isgislative history and again the contemporary
administrative reports show that Congress intended the
act to apply to construction as well as to goods.

The

1910, 1911, 1912 reports all show that the Commissioner
of Indian Affairs and the Secretary of the Interior con­
sidered it their duty to employ Indians and to hire
Indian teams, which are the sort of forerunners of
today's modern corporation.

Certainly at that time

Indians didn't have corporations, but they did ha\re
entrepreneurs who had teams.

And Rep. Sherman's state­

ment, which is quoted at page 23 of our brief, I believe,
and a subsequent comment in 1910 by Rep. Burke all show
that they expected the act to be applied to irrigation
construction, and I don't think that for the purposes of
this case that you can ilstinguish meaningfully between
irrigation construction and road construction.

It is

still constructione
QUESTION:

Did the Bureau or the Secretary ever

construe it as not to apply to construction?
MR. LEVANDER:

No, they did not.

It has been

7
a consistent interpretation.

The language of the act is

certainly broad enough to encompass construction,,

The

word 'product!? as defined by the dictionary encompasses
anything that human effort produces or creates, and that
certainly includes road construction.

An example of a

very common usage of the word "product" to include con­
struction is the gross national product.

That includes

goods, services, and construction work in the nation in a
particular year, and that is a very common usage going
back for quite some time.

So the word "product" doesn't

take any strain of the imagination, as the Court of
Appeals suggested, to construe the word "product" to
encompass construction work.

And we think that Congress’

intent mid the consistent administrative interpretation
should have been deferred to by the Court of Appeals as
reflected in the legislative history and those —
QUESTION:

Mr, Levender, the word "product" is

not used by Itself, it is used as products of Indian
industry0
MR. LEVANDER:
QUESTION:

Righto

Do you normally think of road. con-

struetion as a typical product of Indian industry?
MR. LEVANDER:
would.

Well, I would think — yes, I

Industry, if you are talking about an Industry

in a technical sense, certainly the construction industry

8
la considered to be an industry and ’’industry* in the
sense of work or energy, certainly you have Indians work­
ing on •—
QUESTION:

Is that the normal interpretation

you get in just wording the words "products of Indian
industry”?

Doesn’t that convey a message that products

of industries in which Indians typically engage?
MR. LEVANDER:
QUESTION;

I don’t think so.

You don’t think it does?

MR. LEVANDER:

And the respondent concedes that

the Buy Indian Act would apply to an Indian corporation
today that produced electronic computers, and you ’would
not think of that as a typical product.

In fact, both

cv

the legislative history and the administrative repcrts
show quite clearly that there was an anticipation that
Indians would engage in all kinds of modern industry, and
there was a whole — by use of preference legislation
like the Buy Indian Act, that In fact Indians could
finally rid themselves of dependence and that they would
eventually become self-sufficient.
For example, in the 1911 report, the annual
report of the Secretary, he states, "Indians all over the
country are entering gradually into ordinary industrial
activities,51 Indicating that there was a hope and an
anticipation and recogrition that the Buy Indian Act

9
would apply to these kinds of activities and that
QUESTION:

Is that report in connection with

this legislation?
MR» LEVANDER:

These were annual reports that

were submitted each year by both the Commissioner of Indian
Affairs and the Department of the Interior to Congress -QUESTION:

But- did that particular comment have

any specific relationship to the enactment of —«
MR. LSVANDER:

Yes, it did»

In the various

reports they talk about insofar aa practicable we have
been using Indians in accordance with legislation to do
this and do that, to hire teams and to employ.

Now* they

didn’t say *'Buy Indian Act," but the words "so far as
practicable” appears in the reports and the words rso far­
es practicable” appears in the statute, and the only in­
ference

and this is the only legislation of that time

which directed the Indian Affairs Bureau to employ Indian;
labor and to purchase products, and so it is reasonable
to assume that is what they were referring to, I think,
and that was the anticipation.
QUESTION:

But I take it the Indian industry

from which products may b© purchased must precede the
contract, the existence- of the industry?
MR. LEVANDER:

I?m not quite sure I follow your

question, Mr. Justice White.

10
QUESTION:

Well» could the government finance

the Indian industry at the same time that it gives a con­
tract to it?
MR. LEVANDER:
the Buy Indian Act.
QUESTION:

well» they could but not under

I nean there is various legislation —
I know they could, but would they be

required» would, they be permitted to buy from that industry
witbout advert1sing?
MR. LEVANDER:
would, apply to that.
QUESTION:

Yes* I think they would.

It

The 1974 *■—
Even though the industry was not pre­

existing?
MR. LEVANDER:
QUESTION:

Well, in 1974, Congress —

Even though this was the first time

the Indians had ever been in this industry?
MR. LEVANDER:

Yes, I think it would, but that

is because In 1974 Congress passed the Indian Financing
Act of 1974 which specifically directs the BIA to start
new industries, to fund the money and to develop.

There

is an Indian Development Bureau which was created in 1974
under the Financing Act, and the whole point of that act

is —
QUESTION:

I understand that, but I am wondering

about the Buy Indian Act —
MR. LEVANDER:

Once the business got started.

11
the BIA would be entitled to —
QUESTION:

But it must have gotten started?

NR. LEVANDER:
got started

That's right, but as soon as it

I mean. Ism not sure what that — in any

event, we think that the construction of the word3
"products of Indian Industry" should be given a liberal
construction.

It is not only supported by the legislative

history and what we consider to be a consistent and long­
standing administrative practice, but also by two very
important policy considerations.
First of all, this Court—has reiterated over
and over again in cases such as in the last terra Wilson
Vo Omaha Indian Tribe and Alaska Pacific Fisheries v.
United States and other cases, that when you are constru­
ing a statute that has been passed on behalf of Indiana,
that you must give every reasonable and possible inference
to- the benefit of the Indians, and certainly the word
"product** is easily stretched or easily encompasses the
word "construction" and it doesn’t take much imagination
to get it to road construction»
Furthermore, the second policy consideration
is that the Buy Indian Act is very important, it is not
a theoretical benefit to the Indians.

As we detailed in

our brief and as also detailed in the brief of the amicus
curias in this case, the impact of the decisions below

12
has been severe on Indian industry, especially in the
field of construction.

It takes a fair amount of know-how,

money and expertise to get into complicated industries
like electronic computers.

That is not true of the con­

struction industry, although there obviously is some ex­
pertise needed.

But there is a lot of labor needed and

that kind of an industry can be started up much more
easily.

In many reservations, the construction industry

or logging Industry are the most important employers and
source of revenue.
The effect of the decisions below has been to
cut off in large part Buy Indian contracting, as a result
of which several Indian firms have actually gone bankrupt
and there is loss of employment and economic dislocation
among the group who has been recognized by this Court
and Congress over and over again as terribly disadvantage-do
The second issue in the case, assuming that tht
Court agrees with us that products of Indian industry
includes road, construction, is whether the Federal
Property Act, what I referred to FPASA in our brief,
impliedly relealed the Buy Indian preference in 19^5o
How, respondent concedes that the Buy Indian Act
was initially passed not only as a preference for Indians
but also as an exception to the general federal advertising
requirements.

He also acknowledges that It continues to

13
be an exception even in I960 for the purchase of electronic
computers*

His sole claim is that section 302(e)(B)9

which appears I think at page 4l of our brief —* on 42
actually -«* impliedly repeals the Buy Indian, preference
as regards major construction*
Mow, before turning to the act itself, I think
that this Court *3 unanimous decision In Morton v. Mancarl
is very instructive on this point*

In that ease, the

question was whether Title VII of the Civil Rights Acthad impliedly repealed a long-standing Indian preference,
and this Court said in the absence of affirmative indica­
tions that Congress intended to repeal the long-standing
preference, the Court would not construe the two acts ~
the Court would give each act force and would not find
implied repeal*
Now, even if the act was not as explicit as it
is — and I will get to that in a moment —- about preserv­
ing prior exceptions to the advertising statutes, Morton
v. M&.icari, it seems to me, indicates quite strongly
that the Court should he wary of finding implied repeal*
There is nothing in the legislative history or language
of the 1965 act which refers to the Buy Indian Act9 so
if it repealed it, it repealed it implicitly.
Now, three separate sections of the Federal
Property Act expressly stats that there is an intent to

14
preserve prior existing exceptions to the general adver­
tising statutes.

The Buy Indian Act was not only express

exception to what was then called Revised Statute 3709,
that is. the original federal advertising statute, but it
also talks about purchases in the open market which was a
well understood phrase in contrast to advertised bidding.
So there is no doubt, and respondent concedes that this
was a well established exeptioru
Section 310 o! the Federal Property Act, which
is printed on page 41 of the brief, specifically states
that any statute which was a prior exception to Revised
Statute 3709 —• which was then codified at 4l U.S.C. 5 —
is also to be considered an exception, to the Federal
Property Act.

The respondent concedes that th® Buy

Indian Act falls within Section 310, and it seems to me
that now this is a case that is a fortiorari after
Morton v„ Msheari since the act specifically says it is
to preserve the preexisting exceptions and that it should
not be — no change is made in those exceptions.
Section 310 further states that the act shall
be considered to he an exception under section (c)(15)>
302(c)(15) of the act.

Mow, section 302(c) says basic­

ally you must advertise except for the following 15
exceptions.

The first 14 exceptions *~

QUESTIOM:

Mr. Levender, can I slow you down

15
for a seconds, because I am trying to follow it.

It ex­

cepts it as I read It in subparagraph (15).
HR, LEVANDER:
QUESTION:

Right.

But does that meet the argument pre­

sented by" subsection (e) that follows?
MR. LEVANDER:

I am working my way there slowly,

if I could.
QUESTION:

All right,

MR. LEVANDER:
QUESTION:

Okay.

I thought you were going pretty fast

for me.
MR, LEVANDER:
down.

All right, I will try to slow

Section 310 of the act, as I said, preserves all

exceptions and directs you to (c)(X5).

Now, the first 14

exceptions of subsection (c), 302(c) are exceptions to the
advertising rules created by subsection (c), that is they
don’t depend on other acts.

They are exceptions created

by the act, that is for things like irapractability and
emergencies and exigencies and national emergencies and
professional kinds of things, experimental research and
a number of them, and they are all created by the act.
(c)(15) merely recognizes exceptions created by
other law, as otherwise provided by law.

How, the

respondent agrees again that we are in (e)(15) and as to
non-construction work the binding act constitutes an

16
exemption.

He turns to 302(e)(B), however, and says, ha,

302(B) says that of the exceptions created by the Federal
Property Act, seven are listed and (15) is not one of them
and therefore (15) obviously was not Intended to apply to
major construction.

But (e)(B) states that this section

shall not be construed to authorise,

if there Is nothing

about what other sections or other statutes authorize, arid
it is simply a way of differentiating among the 1*4 excep­
tions created by the statute itself and does not have any
effect or impact upon an authorization or an exemption
created by other law.

When the Buy Indian Act authorizes

the negotiation of a contract, it is simply not a contract
authorized by section (e)(15), it is authorized by the
Buy Indian Acfc3 and there was no need for Congress to
refer to (e)(13) because (e)(B) does not apply to those
kinds of other exceptions.
This reading of the statute I think is confirmed
both by the language of the act and also by the legislative
history.
QUESTION:

Mr. Lev&nder, does section 302 itself

authorise construction contracts?
MR. LEVANDER:
QUESTION:

Does 302(e)(B)?

Is 302 an authorising statute or

merely a statute that spells out the procedure that shall
be followed when construction is otherwise authorized?

17
MR. LEVANDER:
QUESTION:

Just the whole section 3020

MR. LEVANDER:
QUESTION:

302(e)(B) —

Oh, section 302.

Is that an authorising statute?

MR. LEVANDER:

It is as to negotiated contracts

which are authorised by sections (1) through (1*1) of sub­
section (c).

It is not an authorising statute with regard

to advertising which is authorised by some other statute.
It simply preserves the exception that is created by the
other statute.
QUESTION:

Well,, what language in section 302

authorises the government to do anything?
MR. LEVANDER:

302(c) says all purchase under

contracts for property md services shall be made by
advertising...except that such purchases and contracts
may be negotiated by the agency head without advertising
*

if — and it lists 15 exceptions.
QUESTION:

But that wouldn't authorize an

agency to go ahead and make a contracts would it?
MR. LEVANDER:

No, that is correct.

The agency

otherwise has to have authority to do whatever it is that
it is doing.

In other fords, there may be authorisation

for ail agency like the Department of Education to build
buildings, and the only thing that 302 is concerned with
is whether once you have the authority — I may have

18
misunderstood your question — once you have the authority
to build, a building* do you have to advertise the contract
or can you negotiate a contract®
QUESTION:

I naketthe point because you rely

heavily on the word '''authorise” in (e) as I understand you®
MR. LEVANDER;

Well, we rely heavily on the

word "authorize* but we also rely heavily on the legisla­
tive history of that section and the clear intent that we
think emanates from sections 310 and 302(a)(2) of the act
as well.

310 would foe sort of rendered meaningless or at

least would foe cut in half without explanation if 302(e)
were So overrule 310 as to all construction projects.
QUESTION:

Weil, it would still have viability

for everything except those things that are covered by
302(e), namely road construction
MR. LEVANDER:
QUESTION:

That's right.

— and it seams rather clear that

302(e) was intended to have more restrictions apply to
the kinds of contracts that are described, doesn't it?
MR. LEVANDER:

Well, the legislative history

is quite clear ~~
QUESTION:

Otherwise you wouldn't need (E) at

all.
MR. LEVANDER;

The legislative history is quite

clear as to what —■ that's right, but 302(e), the

19
legislative history to 302(e) states that the provision
simply restates what is past law and that is if you look
at the seven exceptions which are stated in 302(e) and
compare them to the seven exceptions., the other seven ex­
ceptions in (1) through (14) which are not present there,
it is quite obvious that the first seven which are men­
tione i would or could possibly apply to major construc­
tions and that the other seven could not, and the other
seven are items
QUESTION':

Are you saying otherwise authorized

by law could not apply to major construction?
MR* LEYANDER:

No* no* no*

Putting aside the

(15) —
QUESTION:

You canft have it both ways.

MR* LEVANDER:

No* no*

Putting aside section

(15) which lie think is very different* the first 13 ex­
ceptions are only created by the statute* but section
(15) is merely recognized by the statute as preserving
a prior exception in other law.

Okay.

Now* as between the 14 exceptions that appear
in section (e), seven of them are excepted also under
section (e).

Those seven could naturally apply to major

construction work.

The other seven could not.

And

Congress imply put this statute in, as the legislative
history makes quite clear* to assure that exceptions (4)

20
through (9) and exception (13) do not apply to construction
and there Is no intent to appeal the prior other acts and.
are already contained in other acts to negotiate? construc­
tion contracts.
The original act was passed in 19*19 and. did not
apply to BIA»

It was amended in 19*55 to apply to BIA and

every other agency, arm the legislative history both times
shows that there wasno intent to make any kind of major
change.

And if Congress was intending to appeal the Buy

Indian Act and various other acts which previously author­
ized construction to be negotiated, you would have
thought there would have been something in the legislative
history and a more specific statement in the language
showing that Congress wanted to do that.

It didn’t.

The legislative history says, "For clarity,
this subsection (a) provides that section 302 does not
authorise or change the existing requirements for- author­
ization for the erection and repair of buildings, roads,
sidewalks or similar items.”
QUESTION:

It didn*t change anything»

Well, it didn't really authorise

anything either, did it?
MR. LEVANDER:
QUESTION:

ThatJ s right.

It simply set down procedures to be

followed.
MR. LEVAWDEE:

It simply made sure that agencies

21
would not attempt to negotiate raajor construction projects
without bidding based on the exemptions I’roia advertising
contained in subsections (4) through (9) and (13).
waa certainly not an intent to repeal
QUESTION:

There

»

That was say brother Stevens5 point 3

that section 302(e) , when it says this section shall, not
be construed to authorise the erection, repair or furnish­
ing of any public building or public improvement, that
such authorisation shall be required in the same manner
as heretofore, is in a way unnecessary since section 302,
the entire section didn't authorise anything*
MR* LEYANDER:

Well, it authorized agencies to

make —~

It set down certain procedures to be

That*s right, but that is an

author!sation -QUESTION:

To carry out previous authorizations.

MR. LEYANDER:
QUESTION:

No, I —

Existing authorizations.

MR. LEYANDER:

I'm not sure that is correct,

Mr. Justice Stewart, in the sense that it didn't create
any power of an agency bo contract.
QUESTION:

No.

MR. LEYANDER:

It did create power among the

22
agencies to negotiate contracts for which they already had
authority and it is a very simple — it. just restates what
is obvious from the face of section (e).
QUESTION:

Mr, Levander* in your brief on page

53 you say that the Buy Indian Act — in the footnote —
is the common name for section 23 of the act of Jim© 25*
1910 * and section 23 simply consists of the statement that
hereafter the purchase of Indian supplies shall be made in
conformity with the requirements of section 3709 of the
Revised Statutes provided that sof&r as may be practicable
Indian labor shall be employed and purchases of the pro­
ducts of Indian industry will be made in the open market
ir. the discretion of the Secretary of the Interior.
Nowj do'you r5ly on the proviso or the first
part or on both?
MR» LEVANDER:

Well, the first part was simply

Indian products and Indian labor that heretofore existed
in every appropriations act since 188*3.
QUESTION:
section 23?

So you rely simply on the proviso in

MR. LEVANDER:

Right , which was not repealed

MR. LEVANDER:

Do you think section 302 applies

to this road contract at all?

lot of ear trouble if you had just argued that.

QUESTION:

But this is your stronger argument,

the one you made today?

MR. LEVANDER:

We think it quit© clear that the

Buy Indian Act does qualify under 310 and 302(c}(15).
QUESTION:

What authority does the Secretary

claim for issuing his present regulations under- tha Buy
Indian Act?
MR. LEVANDER:

Section 2 of Title XXV authorises

the Secretary of the Interior to issue regulations regard­
ing all Indian programs.

QUESTION:

So you don't think that

— he has

never claimed any authority under section 302(a) to issue
any regulations ?
MR o LEVAN DBF.:
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. LEVANDER:
QUESTION:

302(a)?

Well, the —

The executive agencies shall make

purchases and contracts in accordance with the provisions
of this chapter in implementing regulations of the
administrator, so his regulations, outstanding regula­
tions now under the Buy Indian Act, are they — does he
refer to this section at all?
FIR. LEVANDER:

No, the statute is critical,

the subchapter does not apply to' — the subchapter is
made inapplicable'"'pursuant to any other law.
QUESTION:

I understand that.

MR. LEVANDER:

I just «—

But he has not relied on (a)(2)

in issuing regulations*
QUESTION:

MR* LEVANDER:

There have been regulations or

policy statements and the policy has been followed before
1961»

There is a reported case of the Comptroller General

in 1937 and there are these early reports.that we have
described before that -■*

Well, those aren't regulations.

MR. LEVANDER:

Ho*

And prior to 1957, I would

say that there is no articulated formal policy, although
the policy was followed.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Hayes.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF D, D. HAYES, ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. HAYES:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may It

pleas2 the Court:
Glover Construction Company5s position is that
five miles of roadway costing $1.2 million and located in
Pushmataha County, Oklahoma is not a product for sale on
the open market and it is not Indian supplies.

We believe

that such a project is a roadway construction within the
meaning of the Federal Property Act and as such is subject
to the competitive bidding requirements of that law.
The government' 3 main thrust has been t.iat the
word "products” as used in the Buy Indian Act should be
broadly and liberally defined to include roadway construc­
tion because of the policy of resolving doubtful expres­
sions in favor of the Indian people.
We are aware ;hat this Court has on several oc­
casions announced that policy; however, we believe that
policy has no

application to this case.

Based on the

facts that were developed in the District Court, those
facts show that the Indian community in general does not
benefit from the BIA*s interpretation of this statute.
The facts that were developed in the District

27
Court show that the beneficiaries of this Interpretation
were the owners of Indian MatIons Construction Company.
The president of that company is a one-fourth degree
Indian who is an administrative law judge for the Depart­
ment of Health., Education, and Welfare by occupation-.
The vice president of that company was a one-quarter
blood Choctaw who is a self-employed rancher and who
states his net worth at just under a half million dollars.
The treasurer and general manager of that corporation
is a non-Indian and he states his net worth at $.1.3
million.
Mow, based on the reports that we have seen
from the American Indian Policy Review Commission, the
Indians are desperately in need of roads.

The report

indicates that the roadway systems are about 40 parcent
inadequate, that they don't have enough money'budgeted
to build enough roads.

Basically, the crus of the

report is that they need more roads than there is money
to buy.
Mow, what is Important about that is that In
1976 Slover Construction Company built the first five
miles,

of this road for $538,000, and for less than what

the engineer estimated the cost would be.

The second

five miles of this same road in 1977 cost $1.2 million
without competitive bidding and was 22 percent above the

28
estimate that the engineers said it would cost to build it»
QUESTION:

The topography was quite different,

was it not?
MR. HAYES:

I agree, four Honor, it was quite

different5 but I think the significant point is that we
built it for less than the BXA’s engineer estimated it
would cost, and. also its specifications were changed,
they built it for —> they let a contract to build it for
22 percent more than what it was estimated it would cost.
Based on these reasons, and another reason that
we think it doesn’t benefit the Indians is there is abso­
lutely not one shred of evidence in the record, not one
shred of credibleXevidence that any Indian workmen are
x

employed on this $X'.2 million project.
Now, we don’t think it benefits the Indians.

We

don’t think it gets then enough road built, we think it la
more expensive and we don’t think it is creating any jobs
under this interpretation.
Now., we think that the usual methods of inter­
preting and construing statutes ought to be applied to
this case-

We think it should be remembered that the Buy

Indian Act was simply a proviso to section

23

of the Act

of June 25, 1910 and that section 23 was a remedial
statute, and the obvious purpose of passing this remedial
statute was to correct intolerable abuses in purchasing

29
and contracting within the Indian Service which was the
predecessor to the BIAS ana this is made clear from Rep*
Burke's remarks where he says that at that time the
Indian Service was interpreting the 1908 act to permit
them to engage in virtually unregulated purchases and that
this was resulting in indefensible abuses.

So they passed

this statute to remedy that problem.
I don’t think there is any question but that
- "

- V

the rale that this Court has previously announced -and
previously followed, is that remedial statutes ought to be
interpreted to achieve the remedy that the Congress'•pre­
scribed,
■

ought to be interpreted liberally to correct the defect

il

i.,1

and to promote competitive bidding.
1

■■

:v>8
’1

Applying that rule to this case* that statute

;
■

■

■-

Now, we also think it Is significant that .the
v• t

y?

■

Buy; Indian Act was a proviso,

■

■

-

>’ •

f

'

It Is almost unifor&ly

held that a proviso should be strictly construed. : It is
;■ almost uniformly - held that the proviso should be construed
in light of the enacting clause of the statute.

It -is

almost uniformly held that the national limitation of the
!•

i’

proviso Is to those things previously mentioned in the en­
acting clause and that no case is taken out of the enact­
ing’ clause unless it falls fairly or plainly within the
terms of the proviso.
Now, to interpret the word "products** to include

30
roadway construction I think it would be necessary to
violate or disregard every one of these usual rules of
statutory construction.

We have to forget that the pur­

pose of the enacting clause in this statute was to require
competitive bidding on Indian supplies.

Likewise, we have

to literally construe the proviso, instead of strictly
eonstrue it, and the lower courts said that you couldnt *
even get there with a liberal interpretation„

You also

have to forget the subject matter that Congress was regu­
lating.
Congress was regulating Indian supplies»

They

were not regulating construction projects, and we think
it is very clear that the kind of Indian supplies that
was exempt from competitive bidding are products of
Indian industry, that they weren’t talking about —
QUESTION:

What about services, the language

of subsection (c), contracts fore property and services?
Is the contract for road building a contract for services?
MR. HAYES:

Well, I think it is a construction

contract and-I believe you are talking about the Federal
Property Act, is that correct?
QUESTION:
MR. HAYES:

Yes,
Yes, we believe that this is covered

by the Federal Property Act and that it is a contract for
services.

But what 1 am speaking of just now is the

31
original act of 1910 where what they were talking about
and the only thing they mention in the enacting clause was
Indian supplies*
i;

QUESTION:
MR* HAYES:

Me11, they referred to Indian labor.
That was in the proviso»

They men­

tioned Indian labor in the proviso, but in the enacting
clausa I believe the only thing they mentioned is Indian
supplies.

At any rate, you are absolutely correct, they

do mention Indian labor in the proviso.
We think that it is also apparent that this act

of 1910 was not designed to cover roadway construction by
comparing this act with the act that it was designed to
repeal, which is the Act of April 3d, 1908.

And the im­

port ait thing to note in the Act of April 30» 1908 is
that that act contains standard construction-type language»
The language in the pertinent part read that
hereafter supplies may be purchased, contracts let and
labor erployed for the construction of artesian wells,
ditches, and other wcrkds of irrigation, and then they go

on to say without advertising*

Now, that is the act of

1908, and then Congress comes along two years later and
passes this act for the express purpose of repealing that
act and they deleted the language that I just read.

And

we think the rule is that when Congress passes a revising
statute in the place of an original statute and they leave

32
out a provision from the original statute* th«y intended
to repeal that provision and make it anulled.

And .in order

to apply this statute, the Act of 1910 to r&odway construc­
tion, 1 think you have to rewrite the statute to put that
language back into it, and I don't think that is what
Congress wanted done.
At any rate, we believe that the Court is con­
fronted with a very clear-cut choicee

You can define the

word "products” by looking at a dictionary definition.
QUESTION:

Do you differ with your colleague on

the other side as to whet the consistent administrative
construction has fcesnf
MR. HAYES:

I certainly do,

right now, if I might.

I will address that

This statute was enacted in 1910»

According to the report of the American Indian Policy
Review Commission, the BIA or the federal government
first got involved in roadway construction under the BIA’s
road program in 1935*

The Solicitor’s opinion which first

applies or first authorised supplying the BIA’s present
interpretation of roadway construction is dated 1971»
QUESTION:

Well, what was the view before that

time, do you know?
MR, HAYES:

Well, there wasn’t any evidence in

the District Court, but if the competitive bidding laws
have applied ail along, and they have, end if the

33
Solicitor1e opinion in 1971 says for the first time that
it is legal to exempt it from competitive bidding, they
had to be building those projects by competitive bidding.
My client built one in .1976 by competitive bidding, and
we believe —» and the evidence isn’t clear on this point,
but we believe that from 1935 to 1971« they had to be
building these roads by competitive bidding.

And we also

believe that the Court should give great weight to the
interpretation of the BIA when they first commenced the
road building program in 1935, because that is the point
closer in time.
The complained of bulletin which for the first
time makes it mandatory to give the jobs without competi­
tive bidding to an Indian-owned company is dated March 3,

1976.
QUESTIOH;
argument that section

Do you agree with the government’s

5

of Title 4l does not apply to

a construction contract?
MR. HAYiSS:

No, i do not.

I believe that

section 5, as I understand the legislative history,
section 5 applied from — it was originally enacted in
the middle 1800*8 and applied up to 1949 when the Federal
Property Act was passed.

And we believe that during; that

period, of time It covered roadway construction and that
is why we believe that when the BIA —

3^

QUESTION:
MRo HAYES:

And required advertising.
leg* sir.

Yess lour Honor.

And we

believe that when this act was passed in 1910 that it did
exempt certain products of Indian industrys but It obvious
iy did not exesipt roadway construction and the Congress
didn’t intend for it to exempt roadway construction be­
cause Congress wasn’t ©van in the business of roadwayconstruction at that time*

They didn’t get into it until

25 years later.

QUESTION:

Well* what about non-construction

Indian products?
MR. HAYES:

We believe that the Buy Indian Act

can be applied to non-eonstractIon products.
QUESTION:

Because why?

Why is that exempt

under — let’s say under Title 5* why was it exempt under
Title 5?
MR. HAYES;
QUESTION:

Because of the Buy Indian Act.
So you think that the Buy Indian Act

was a provision that otherwise authorised the purchase of
Indian goods without advertising?
MR. HAYES:
Your Honor* it does.

Yes* sir.

I believe it does.

Yes,

I believe that It applies to non —

\

QUESTION:

So your whole ease turns on the

definition of "products*?
MR. HAYES:

That’s correct * I believe It does.

35
I think Congress made that distinctions because I think In
each one of these relevant statutess Congress has seen fit
to treat construction work separate from other products.
They treated it separately in the Act of 1908» they treat
it separately in the Federal Property Act or section 302.
They seal with it separately.
QUESTION:

How about under Title 5 before the

passage of the Federal Property Aet9 do you think that you
would distinguish between construction contracts and other
contracts under section 5?
MR. HAYES:

Mo» sir, I don’t think section 5

does its but 1 think the Buy Indian Act would permit the
Secretary, when it was practicable, in purchasing Indian
\

*

supplies to buy those products, but I don’t think there
is any distinction.

I think that the BIA was regulated

by section 5 of Title 4l until the Federal Property Act
was applied to them.
QUESTION:

Then the BIA was regulated by Title

5» but you just told ms that Title 5 would not require
or section 5 would not require advertising under the Buy
Indian Act.
MR, HAYES:

Your Honor, I think what I said is,

with all due respect, is that Title 5 is a general —
QUESTION:
MR. HAYES:

Section 5«
section 5 was a general

36
advertising statute,

Mow, the Buy Indian Act ia arguably

an exception to that with regard to products of Indian
Industry.
QUESTION:
MR, HAYES:
QUESTION:
MR. HAYES:
QUESTION:
MR, HAYES:
QUESTION:

You said it was a moment ago.
Okay.
But do you still think it is or not?
I think it is an exception to —
Section 5 Is an old statute.
Yes, sir,
And you think when the Buy Indian Act

came along It was an exception to Title 5?
MR. HAYES:

It was a United exception applying

only ;o certain products of Indian industry available in
the open market.

It did not exempt them entirely from the

application of Section (52 and we believe it didn’t exempt
them from roadway construction.
QUESTION:

Your whole ease really depends upon

the proposition that roadway construction is not Indian
products available in the open market, is that —MR, HAYES:
QUESTION:
MR. HAYES:

ThatTs correct.
Isn’t that your whole case?
Well, our whole ease, Mr. Justice,

is that *—
QUESTION:

Because if these are Indian products

available in the open market, you have just said, as I

37
understood your answer to ay brother White, they would not
h© subject to competitive bidding,
MR. HAYES:
QUESTION

ThatTs correct.
Mr, Hayes, does that mean that you

have abandoned, your argument based on subsection (e)?
MKo HAYES:
QUESTION:

No, it doesn’t, not at all.
Then you had better explain why it

doesn’t,
MR, HAYES:
QUESTION:

Section <e) —
Ab I understood the court below to

place alternative and separate reliance on (e), I under­
stand you in effect to be abandoning that position.
MR. HAYES:

Perhaps I haven’t- been clear.

Our

position is that the Buy Indian Act doesn’t.have anything
to .do with section 302(c) or (e)
QUESTION:

Well» I understand that If you are

right about products under the Buy Indian Act, you don’t
need to reach (e); but assuming you are wrong about
products, does it also take it out of (e)?
MR* HAYES:

If this Court should construe pro­

ducts to fee roadway construction and the Buy Indian Act
exempts roadway construction, then the question arises is
did (2) imply the repeal of the Buy Indian Act to that
extent.

Okay.

Well, I don’t think it did.

I am sure

this Court is well aware of Morton v. Mancari* but I

38
think that case is very, very different fro©, this case.
In that case, they were dealing with a very specific
statute that came right out and said in 1935 unequivocally
that there is going to b® an employment preference for
Indians within th@ BIA,

All right.

When this statute was enacted in 19^9s when they
decided that under no circumstances could road construc­
tion not be subject to competitive bidding, nobody9 includ­
ing the BIA was interpreting products to mean roadway con­
struction,

The Solicitor*a opinion, dated *?1„ said the

practice may have been going on for ten years»

So it

places an intolerable burden on Congress when they pass a
law in 19^9 to assume that twelve years later the Indian
Department is going to come up with a new interpretation
of the word “products.51
QUESTION:

Can’t Indian products change?

Let's

assume there was an electronics business started on a
reservation and the United States wanted some electronic
—* the BIA wanted to get some electronic products*

It assy

have been fifty years ago that this wasn't an Indian
product,
MR. HAYES:

I agree with that statement, but I

think that Congress has drawn a distinction between pro­
ducts of Indian industry and construction, and I think
they —

39
QUESTION:

Whenever a road was built s it .just

never was a product, that is Just not within the reach of
the word "product®n
MR* HAYES:

That is our position and we believe

it is Congress’ position because in 1908 if they had
wanted It to apply, they had construction language and
whan ;fa©y intended an act to apply to construction they
said contracts let for construction of.

If they intended

for this act in 1310 to apply to that, we think they would
have said contracts let for the construction of, instead
of leaving that language out*
QUESTION:

Well, there must have been an .awful

lot of roads built from 1910 on Indian reservations«

Is

it your suggestion that they have always been built on
competitive bidding?
MR* HAYES:

Based on the administrative reports

that I have seen, in 1935 the federal government, through
the BIA, got into the read-building program.

Now, how

they were built before, I must assume it was done by the
states and the counties *

That was not a matter that was

put into evidence at the District Court level.
QUESTION:

MR* HAYES:
QUESTION:

I see*
At any rate —
But you -say from *35 to 9 71 you think

they were built on competitive bidding?

ko
MR* HAYES:

That is our position.

As I Indicatedc

in 1935a section 5 of Title 41 applied to the BIA and they
were required to go by competitive bidding.
QUESTION:

Then in —

But not on services . not on Indian

products.

MR. HAYES:

Mot

ok

Indian products.

But we

think Congress, as I have indicated befores we think
Congress treated products and construction differently.
QUESTION:

There is nothing to stop you from

putting that in evidence, was there?
MR. HAYES:
QUESTION:
MR. HAYES:
QUESTION:

Mo.
Why didn’t you put it into evidence?
Well* lour Honor* we just -You didn’t think of it?

I’m not

saying — I am just trying to help — but we can’t take
your ’think,* can we, that you think that is what they
were doing?

That is not enough* is it?

Don't we have to

know one way or the other in c-rder to go along with your
point?

MR. HAYES:
QUESTION:

I respect —
The point is that there was competi­

tive bidding up until 671»
MR. HAYESs
QUESTION:
assume it?

Your Honor —•
Unless you can prove that, how car: we

MR. HATESi

Okay»

The 3©licotorfa opinion»

which is dated 1971» says that as far hack as 19Si we
have been applying the Buy Indian Act to roadway construc­
tion,,

All right.

If in 1935 the regular competitive

bidding act applied and they first started applying the
Buy Indian Act in 196 ls then it just inescapably follows
that they were doing it according to regular competitive
bidding practices during the intervening period.

Also we

have some — fcher other side has not — of course» we
don’t have access to that information after the District
Court, and there has been no evidence from the other side
that they commenced, in 1933 when the program began of
applying the

Buy

Indian Act.

QUESTIOH:

I just would not like to participate

in an opinion which says that prior to 1<M>1 the governraent awarded its contracts on competitive bidding /insofar
as roads are concerned •— footnote» your thinking.!

I have

to have something better than that, than your footnote.
MR. HAYES:

Meli» it is our position that the

law was at that time and it still is that they were .re­
quired to do it by competitive bidding.

How» we have to

assums that they followed the law until they say they
stopped following it. and they indicate through the
Solicitor’s opinion that they have quit following the- law
in 1951.

42
We know for a fact that we built the first five
miles in 1976 under competitive bidding, and as far as we
know it casse as a shock to us because we thought they had
always done it by competitive bidding until we were de­
prived of the right to bid for the first time in 1977®
In answer to one question, I didnft get it com­
pletely answered about the possibility of an implied
repeal.

We think that this Court itself has indicated

that,'in applying the Morton v. Mancari ease,, this Court
itself indicated at Footnote 2 of that case that section
47 was a more narrowly drawn statute than section 12 which
was at issue in that case.
This Court also indicated that for all practical
purposes in Footnote 2 that section 47» along with some
other sections, had been replaced by section 12.

So; we

don*t think that the Mortem v. Mancari rule can bo applied.
Me don't think

because, number one, Congress could not

have possibly envisioned that this would be applied to
roadway construction in 1549 when that law was enacted;
and, secondly, because it is not as broad a statute as
section 12 was.
Thank you.
QUESTION:
MR. HAYES:
QUESTION:

Mr. Hayes, Kay I ask a question.
Yes, sir,
You described the officers of this

'13
Indian company and they didn’t sound a lot like Indians to
me0

Who determines — does the statute say that a one-

fourth blooded Indian la an Indian for purposes of this
statute?
MR. HAYES:

I believe it does 3 Your Honor.

In

feet. I think it says — end the government can correct- me
if I am wrong, but I think if they are even one percent
Indian they are considered to be an Indian for purposes of
this statuteo
QUESTIOH:

Another question, I think your brief

or the government’s brief described this road as being
built in land occupied by Indians.,

Is it built on a

reservation?
MR. HAYES:

I don’t think sos Your Honor.

It

is —
QUESTION:

What determines where one of these
'4'

roads may be built?
MR. HAYES:

There is a statute — and I

not

familiar with the cite — that sets out the BIA’s Juris­
diction over certain roads.
QUESTION:

Does that relate to the percentage

of population composed of Indians?
MR. HAYES:

I can’t answer that question.

don’t know how they determine it.

I

It is Just that- Congress

gave them a particular Jurisdiction by statute to maintain

certain roads*
QUESTION;

And the United States government pays

for the roads?
MR» HAYESi

Yes, Your Honor, the United States

government pays for it.
QUESTION;

Without regard to whether Indian labor

is used or not?
MR* HAYES:

Obviously In this case regardless of

whether Indian labor was used or not, because —QUESTION;

Because the contractor doesn't obli­

gate she contractor to use Indian labor?
MR. HAYES;

No, Your Honor, it does not.

The

memorandum does not address Indian labor either that we
sued for.
QUESTION:
vant to this ease.

My questions may be entirely Irrele­
I was Just curious.

QUESTION:

Mr. Hayes, I had a similar question
i

about the definition of the Indian enterprise.

You just

described it in terms of two ©f the executives being of
partial Indian blood.

Is the??© any requirement that the

ownership of the company be in the hands of Indians?
MR. HAYES:

The memorandum that we sued on,

this 1976 bulletin says that it has to be 100 percent
Indian owned, which I would interpret that to mean that
all the stockholders hare to be at least one percent Indian.

QUESTION:

If that Is true, then the third person

that you. named apparently had no Indian blood, was just
merely an executive of the company, he dldn*t have any
effect on the eligibility of the enterprise.
MR. HATES:

That is ssy understanding, he Is not

He nas one of the original incorporators

and it treasurer and general manager according to the ex­
hibito that the government introduced at a deposition we
took.

The other two people were stock­

holders, is that what it is?
MR. KAYES:

I think there are three stockholders

and I think they are all at least one-fourth Indian,
