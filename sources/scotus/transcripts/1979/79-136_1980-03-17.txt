ORAL ARGUMENT OF LWARENCE G, WALLACE, ESQ»,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR» WALLACES

Mr» Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
Tii© question beft re the Court in this case is
whether a living organism is patentable subject matter under
Section 101 of the present patent 'law,.

This is a relatively

narrow question of statutory interpretation and congressional
intent, a question which doss not, in our view, require the
Court to' resolve any Of the much mooted current controversies
about desirable public policies in the field of so-called
gene-tic engineering„
QUESTIONs

We are pretty well bound by the statute
T -"N>

in that area, aren’t we,
MR® WALLACE s

<

anyway?
That is our view, Mr» Justic©»

But

the question before the Court is a question of interpreting
the statute»
The claims at issue were rejected by the Examiner and
by the Board of Appeals but were upheld by the Court of
Customs' and' Patent Appeals®

They are claims drafted in various

4
forms to a living microorganism to what' -amounts to a laboratoryinduced hybrid strain of bacteria combining in a. single
organism plasmids which are genetic units that are plasmids
that are found, in natur© to exist only separately in separate
strains of -these bacteria»

And the combination of these

plasmids in the new strain enable that strain to degrade
several components of crude oil simultaneously.
The Examiner allowed numerous related claims by
the Respondent to the process for producing the new strain
and claims to an inoculum combining tine new strain with
certain carrier material.

Some of the rejected claims are

also inoculum claims but in those claims' the only essential
element, of the inoculum claimed is the' new- strain of bacteria
itself without any carrier or mixture being specified and
those are treated by everyone in the case as essentially
claims on the bacteria? just variance of the basic claim’'
for the bacteria,

5

analysis in Parker v, Ploofc would haw disallowed some of -die
claims that were allowed but none of those claims are at
issue before this Court»

There is no mechanism for

administrative review of claims allowed by an examiner»

The

Board of Appeals in CCP& did not pass on the validity of those
claims»
But fch® fact that the process claims were allowed
here points up for us what no on® really disputes here, that
•the patent law does apply to new technology? the whole purpose
of the patent law is to encourage the development of new
technology and to grant rights to inventors who discover new
technologies but the claims inolving those new technologies
in order to be patentable have to be claims that come within
the statutory categorias established by Congress as the
)

Examiner held the process claims did in 'this case, as well
as the inoculum claims combined bacteria with specified
carrier materials,

And our basic contention hare is that

claims oa living organisms themselves are not within the
statutory categories established by Congress and therefore were
properly rejected by the Examiner and the Board of Appeals
here*

And that is all that is at issue,
We start our brief *-** the argument in our brief with

a quotation from this Court's recent decision in Parker v.
Floor. that the Judiciary must proceed cautiously when asked
to extend patent rights into areas wholly unforeseen by

6

Congress®

QUESTIONs

MrQ Wallace, do you think that when

Congress passed the patent statute in the 1790*3 it foresaw
telephone* radio* television and that sort of thing?
Ml WALLACES

Mot at all* Mr» Justice* and as I just

said we do think the patent law applies to claims involving
new technology so long as the claims are within the statutory
category ®
QUESTIONS

I mean it was to reward inventors who saw

things that Congress didn't see —
MR® WALLACE z
QUESTION:

Well

— that patent laws were passed®

MM® WALLACE:

Tho reason I mentioned this sentence

is because this case really involves a considerable variant
on this sentence.

We do not think we are talking here about

an erea wholly unforeseen by Congress®

And for that reason

the case is & little bit different®
QUESTION:

Others don't think we. are talking about

an extension of 'the patent law* either®
MR® WALLACES
QUESTION:

Well* we do think —

I know®

You differ on that* that is the

reason this lawsuit is here®
MR® WALLACE i

Our contention is that this would be

an extension unforeseen by Congress but not an area wholly

7
unforeseen by Congress, because for the last 50 years Congress
has dealt quit© specifically with hybridisation of living
organisms in patent statutes0

tod this is the heart of our

case, that Congress has for 50 years built a statutory
edifice7on the premise that the language that is new in section
10.1 about patents on manufacturers or compositions of matter
does not apply to living organisms and they have mad© specific
provision for patenting of various categories of organisms
with a'great many exclusions and a great many specifically
feed..

ored provisions, all based on the premise that those

categories are not included within the gerieral authorization
for patents on discoveries of manufacturers or compositions
of matter»
QUESTIONS

Are penicillin and yeast patented?

• MR*, WALLACE:

So far as I am aware there have been

patents issued on some medicines involving living organisms
but 1 don't know of any patent on a particular strain of
yeasto

There was a patent issued to Pasteur for an apparatus

and method of purifying yeast and that included a claim on the
yeast so purified without mentioning any specific strain which
others would be excluded from manufacturing or using0

Whether

that patent was properly granted is something that no court
has ever passed on„

The question was recognized by the Court

of Customs and Patent Appeals in this case to be a question
©f first impression»

8
QUESTION:

I take it from your response that the

patents listed on page 50 of your friend's brief running from
1873 feo 1930 you think are not relevant to —
MR® WALLACEs

We have dealt with all of those that

preceded the 1960®s in the appendix to our reply brief, Hr.
Justice»

But our basic contention is that the disputes among

the parties about the actions of particular examiners in
uncontested and unreviewed matters over a period of many years,
there being some thousand examiners in the Patent Office today
dealing with some 130,000 applications a. year arid -there being
almost 4j>200,000 patents that have been granted cumulatively
in the course of the years,’that the disputes about what
particular examiners have done in accepting or rejecting,
allowing or disallowing particular claims are relatively
inconsequential in this case in light of the specific attention
that Congress has given 'the issue bare and the fact that there
has never bean an articulated policy of the Patent Office
to grant patents on living organisms brought to the attention
of Congress and no indication that Congress ever acquiesced
in any such interpretation of the lawc
Whan -diis is combined with the history of the last
50 years of building a statutory edifice on the premise that
patents cannot be issued on living organisms —*
QUESTIONs

Living organisms would be products of

nature, would they not?

i.MRo WALLACES
QUESTION*

It is conceded and very clear that

section :1GI of the Act does not make patentable any product

MR» WALLACEs

But what Congress has dealt with for

nature and the extent to which patentability should be
available on. those organisms»
. r'

fed we start in examining this
,

i?

history of congressional treatment with the 1930 Plant Patent
Act itself which amended what is now section 101 of the
patent law to read as w© have reproduced it on page 22 of our
brief»
Before the 1352 recodification of the patent code
for 22 years after the enactment of the 1930 law which is

new section 101 read as is set forth on .page 22 of our -brief,
saying any person who has- invented or discovered any new and
useful art, machine, manufacture or composition of matter or
any new and useful improvements or who has invented or
discovered and ©sexually reproduced any distinct and new
variety of plant other than a tuber*»propagated plant may
obtain a patent therefor»
It ie obvious to us on the fact of that that
Congress was not operating on the premise -that any distinct,
new variety of plant was a category already included within
any new and useful manufacture or composition of matter,

10
otherwise the exclusion of tuber-propagated plant from the
latter category would have ambiguities to it and could have
been interpreted as a contraction of patent rights when Congress
treated the Act as an expansion of patent rights0

And this is

not left merely to the face of the statute but in both House
and Senate committee reports appended in full a latter from
Secretary Hyde* the Secretary of Agriculture, stating — we
have set forth this letter on pages 24 and 25 of our brief —
stating very specifically that the purpose of the law is
to bring reproduction of newly bred our found plants under
the patent laws which at the present time are understood to
cover only inventions or discoveries in the field of
in ahimate nafcur©»
Hcm, various efforts- are made to explain why this
may not be si completely authoritative interpretation of the
then existing patent laws but the fact of the matter is both
houses appended this as Appendix A to their committee reporto
Those reports have only, one other appendix. Appendix Be the
text of the new statute*

This is not a letter that is

buried in a whole list of communications that are appended»
There is nothing said in either report to cast, any doubt on
Secrotary Hyde's interpretation of the then existing patent;
law»

Indeed„ the reports are entirely consistent with that

interpretation and in particular both reports have an
identical series of paragraphs which begin with the sentence

11
* Furthe more , there is no apparant difference f for instance,
between the part played by the plant originator in the
development of new plants and the part played by the chemist
in -the development ©f new composition of matter which ars
patentable under existing law»**
and then there is for several paragraphs a comparison
of -the chemist*a development of compositions of matter and
the breeder® s development of- plants and -the terminology is
always used distinctively®
QUESTIONS

Going back to Secretary Hyde's lettere

Mra Wallace 2 what significance do you place on what would
appear to bo very carefully chosen words that at -the present
time are understood to cover *~~ “are understood0 — if there
were holdings that ware perfectly clear he would»3t have used
that language f would he?
MR. WM.-LACB;
correct.

There was no court holding, that is

But Congress expressed no disagreement with that

understanding and the whole point of our argument is not that
it was settled law or that Congress ever articulated specifically
that there is no other way to get a patent on a living organism
but that Congress developed very carefully wrought statutes

on the premise that -these wore the only ways that one was
authorised to get a patent on a living organism and on the
premise that what is new section 101 did not authorise such
patents.

QUESTIONS

If you were looking for an expert of

patent laws would you «- would the Secretary of Agriculture
coras to your mind right away?
MR* WALLACE»

H© was the Cabinet official —

is he?

Of course he is not the foremost

Ho is not necessarily an expert at all,,

His expertise lies elsewhere? doesnst it?

QUESTIONS

Well, he —

If any*

MR* WALLACE»

Ha was informed*

The record shows

— that v® have produced in our brief by Patent Counsel ~~ h©

the interest of plant breeders and hybridizers, all of whom
approached him on the basis of advice from Patent Counsel*
In any ©vent this is the premise on which the
committee acted*

M© one in Congress on the floor or in the

report questioned this premise * ' And everything that was written
and said is consistent with this premise*
The next 'development was the 1940 Court of Customs
and Patent Appeals decision which we cite in our brief in
re»

Arzberger>which interpreted the plant patent provisions

of this paragraph as not cohering a claim on bacteria*

There

was an effort to get a plant patent at that time on a micro­
organism*

No claim was made that it fall within the language

13

of the upper portion of the paragraph.,

They were all in the

Perhaps no claim could have

been made because of the difficulty ©f meshing the description
requirement for anything other than a plant patent.
But what is .interesting from our standpoint is
that no one on the Board of Appeals or the Court of Customs
and Patent Appeals mentioned in passing or in any way that
perhaps such an organism could qualify as a manufacturer
Composition of matter»

The question was not reserved? the

possibility didn8t even ©sour to anyone in the course of that
litigation»
QUESTIONz

At what date - now?

MR» WALLACE*

1940»

This was 10 years after the

Plant Patent Act was passed»
The next then *—
QUESTION*

Is it not pretty clear that the developments

in the 40 years since then have been of such magnitude that
they would not have even been in the imagination of people at
that time?
MK« WALLACE*

The preraise, of that decision was. that

the claimant had devised in a laboratory a new strain of
bacteria?' the same claim being made fey Chakrabarty,

The

claim was not rejected by the Court of Customs and Patent
Appeals for obviousness ©r for lack of novelty»
because they interpreted fete©

It was rejected

-Plant Patent Act as not applying

14

to a claim for a bacterium»

The question was whether a

bacterium was a plant within the meaning of that Act and they
said that was not what Congress had in mind* all excepting
the premise -that it was novel, useful and not obvious»

There

may be some question about that but that was the premise of
the decision®
Then the next ©vent chronologically was the 1952
recodification of the patent laws in which no question was
raised in Congress or by the drafters about the validity of any
of the premises- on which the Plant Patent Act was enacted or
had been interpreted and these provisions were separated out
at that time»
The next event chronologically in this history of
50 years of congressional consideration of hybridisation,,
and that is all we are involved with* here, that the techniques
in this laboratory are more sophisticated than 'the techniques
of Luther, Burbank and the other plant breeders' but what, is
produced is a hybrid living organism, basically the same kind
of product»
The next event chronologically are the proposals
leading to the Plant Variety Protection Act of 1970 and on
page 14 of our brief in the first paragraph of Footnote 12
we mention the scries of proposals by the Patent Bar»
of them don't specify whether -they -thought existing •.

Some

IS

law could not extend this far»

Others do specify quite

specifically, as this 1966 resolution of the American Ear
Association Patent Section did, it was entitled “Extension of
V

Patent System to Biological Arts Not Now Covered6* and it
favored coverage specifically far microorganisms and animal
husbandry»

And as a matter of fact in following up these

many proposals — we have recounted a number of them there «■we note on page 29 of our brief in Footnote 35 that in the
course of consideration of the Plant Variety Protection Act
a representative of this Patent Section of the American Bar
’

.#

4

•

Association referred to this series of resolutions and to
bills that had been

proposed at the behest and with the

support of the ABA by Senator McClellan with respect to patent
protection for microorganisms«,
There had been bills introduced by him but no
hea rings held or. th@mD

And when the Plant Variety Protection

Act was enacted it contained a specific exclusion for bacteria
as well as for fungi and for first generation hybrids agaitist
■this background of advocacy of inclusion of bacteria because
of their lack of present coverage by the patent laws»
And the reports that were issued at that -time by the Congress
in 1970 by both committees, the important paragraph 'is set out
■m

page 28.of our brief, and those reports are much more

specific in agreeing with the position that Secretary Hyde
had taken in 193© that a© protection is available under the

16

then existing* laws to varieties of plants which reproduce
sexually# that is generally by seed»

This was an extension

of a patent-type protection that went beyond the 1930 Act
which was limited to asexual reproduction which would have to
be by cuttings or grafting and for the first time went into
the field where there might foe biological reproduction
i

uncontrolled by the patentee or his licensees 0

And the

limitations that were specified on the kind of patent protection
to he given were much more extensive than the limitations under
the 1930 Act which dealt only with asexual reproduction.
there were si number of exclusions«

And

Okra# celery# peppers,

tomatoes#, carrots and cucumbers were specifically excluded
by one provision»

j

The authorising provision itself excludes fungi
bacteria and first generation hybrids®
QUESTION s'

1 take it there was no explanation in

the legislative) history of why this plant language was added
to a predecessor of 101»

On page 22 you refer t© that language

of 101 and you say that the very fact that Congress 'originally
added the provisions to a predecessor of 101 strongly indicates »
Was there any —
MR. WALLACEi

There was to indication in the 1930

legislative history of why the language was being added to
section 4'8iS of the revised statute rather than enacted
separately»

■i

f

(

17

■ But the

the only explanation that occurs is the

explanation that can be deduced from the committes reports
which are appended to Secretary HydeEs letter that this was
adding subject matter that didn't exist in 4386, adding tc the
categories of claims that could now be patented»
QUESTION5

Isn't it equally arguable that this

recital that you have been going over shows a state of
uncertainty about the ©average?
ME» WALLACES

Well, that would be enough for us to

win our case under this Court's decisions

,

because, in the

absence of a clear and certain signal the Court has said twice
recently that the patent law should not be extended»
■ QUESTIONS

I am not talking about the statute now»

I am talking about this statutory —• this legislative history»
MR» WALLACES
QUESTION:

Well, --

That merely shows there was uncertainty

at that time»
ME.» WALLACES

There may have been uncertainty but

there is no indication that anyone in Congress thought that
patents could be secured other than under the Plant. Patent
Act and -the Plant Variety Protection Acte

There are many

indication's that persons in Congress thought they could not
be»

Such guidance as we got from the legislative history
is all in one direction»

It is not air tight but there is-

18

nothing to the contrary in the legislative history.

Everything

indicates that to the extent it vas considered everyone in
Congress was operating on the premise that patent protection
for living organisms was not otherwise available,

And they

have built an edifice of specifically tailored statutory
provisions over a period of 50 years on that premise,
I would like to reserva -the balance of ray time,
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr, McKie,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD F, McKIE, JR, , ESQ, ,

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR, MCKIE:

Mr, Chief Justice*, and may it please the

Court:
As ray brother has said, the' question hers is whether
a particular microorganism is patentable.

This microorganism

is useful in degrading, degenerating, eating up, if you will,
oil spills, one of our real modern problems- with respect to the
ecology,

A mors useful art would be hard to imagine.
The Constitution provides for the Congress obtaining

power to grant patents in order to advance the useful arts,
I think it is conceded here that the constitutional power is
•there.

The only question is whether the Congress has exercised

that power.

In ©ur submission it has and it has in two

different categories of statutory language,
St has provided for the granting of patents on new
manufacturers

It also has provided for the granting of patents’,
on compositions of matter*
In our submission this bacterium developed by Dr*
Chakrab&rty is either one of those, perhaps it is both*
The Board of Appeals in this case made an express
finding that this was not a product of nature*

They also said

that it was not expressly excluded by the statutory language*
In our submission that means that it was made by
Dr® Chakrabarty, it represents something made by man and
therefor© not a product of nature and therefore a manufacture
which can be patented under the existing patent law*
Now, in this case - the Government's primary argument
in the petition itself and in the initial brief ~~
QUESTION:

Well, if you — under 101 if you just

discover a new microorganism is it patentable?
MR® Me^IEs

That depends, Mr® Justice White, on ~

QUESTION:

I mean you find it and you try to patent

it just the way you found it?
MR® McKXE:

If you mean -that it existed previously

in nature, I think you could not for -the reason that it would
have been a product of nature®
QUESTION t

MR® McKXE:
a court adjudicated
QUESTIONS

And where is that exclusion in 101?
It is not expressly mentioned®

It is

.
jUBt on® of those things in the air.

20

MR. McKIE:

1 think that that is correct, Mr. Justice

QUESTION 2

It does not fall under any of the language

White»

of 101, does it‘?

It is not a manufacture.

MR. McKIE:

Well, it —

QUESTION}

You discover a composition of matter.

MR. McKIEs

I think that would he the closest#

discover a composition of matter.
QUESTION:

The word

discover® meant something else

from what it means now.
MR. McKIEs

That may well be the ease.

The problem

I think is whether it is an invention, and that is the problem
that- was addressed by the Congress in 1930.

But that is a

different problem than we are concerned with here.

We are

concerned with here something that was not merely extracted
from nature and sought to be patented but rather something 'that
was 'then acted upon by man to change an essential character­
istic and to enable it therefore t,o degrade a number of
components of oil simultaneously, which is something that idle
prior existing microorganisms could not do.

It has been

provided with an additional characteristic and 2 submit that
under the. decisions of this Court, particularly in American
Plant Vo Brogdeas it qualifies as a manufacture for that
reason.
W© have here a finding of fact, in effect, by the

21

Patent Office adm.nlstrativa agency which is charged with
making such findings, namely

the Board of Appeals„ that this

was not a product of nature and it -therefore is a manufacture
and it is patentable in our submission as suoh0
Mow* the prime position taken by the Government
previously in this case has been that the policy of the Patent
Office has always been to refuse to grant patents on living
subject matter and that this represents a change of that
policy*

therefor® an extension of the patent law into an

area never previously foreseen by the Congress,,
Now* we answered that argument by pointing out that
there was no evidence adduced that showed that particular
conclusion pt all»

There was no support for the contention

the Government made„

I

Moreoever7 ws brought forward several different

kinds of evidence which do show that the policy of the Patent
Office in the past has bean to grant patents on living
subject matter in appropriate circumstances,
Nowr the Government appears to want now to step
•aside from that whole issue and they now say that their primary
thrust is on a different issue entirely* namely -the history
of the Plant Patent Act and -the Plant Variety Protection
Ac to

And our submission the reason they want to do that
is we have shown that their initial premise in seeking

22

certiorari in this case is erroneous.

The policy of the

Patent Office ha® not bean shown to have been contrary to
granting patents on living subject matter.
QUESTION*

We have *•**

Your reference on page SO* the list of

cases from 1873 to 1930 is directed at that point?
MR. McISIE i

That is one of the items of-evidence

that we have adduced., Mr. Chief Justice.

It is only one*

however.
•

W© have pointed also to a decision of this Court

in the ease of Funk v„ Kalb, a 1947 case, I hislieve, in which
a patent had been issued by this same Patent Office, on
bacteria.

And that is what w® -are concerned with here.

That patent was to a mixture of bacteria* the- same kind of
thing for which claims are sought here and the Patent Office
in that case had granted the patent on the bacteria®

It

was found to foe invalid in this Court for a different reason
but not. b@cause it was directed to living subject matter.
We referred to tfcsft case in- our'.brief? the Government 'responded
by saying wall* that really was- -dealing with a 'different
matter.
But the point is- that it was claiming bacteria and
At was claiming bacteria alone.

So that there is an instance

of tbs Patent Office not only having granted the patent but
now seeking to say that that is not the situation
faced with hat'®»

that, we are

In our submission At is the earns situation

23

we are faced with here but for one point that makes no
differenceo

The point is that in that case the bacteria were

a mixture of different species, each of which was old»

In

this case we are dealing with a single species which is nex#0
But they are both living things»

If a patent cannot be

granted on cna because it is alive , then a patent cannot be
granted on the other because it is alive»
But the Government appeal's now to take the position
that 'the patented bacterium in -the Funk v® Kalo case was
date even though it was alive»
I don’t know whether you noticed the emphasis that
was placed on a word: in the argument by my friend here a
little earlier and that^was "alone'® or “themselves»"
Government appears now to haw switched its position»

The
They

are now saying that in the case of claims to bacteria, micro­
organisms alone, or themselves, then the policy has always
been never to' grant such patents', not the policy has been to
refuse patents on living things»

It is--a totally different

thing»
Em 3 we adduced proof of a number of different

patents»

Mr® Chief «Justice, you just referred to that at page

50, I think, of our brief»
list»

There are some 63 patents in that

The Government says as to most of those patents they

are directed to old subject matter, ah if that, made it;
different®

The subject -matter is alive whether it is old or

24

XIOto

As to some 14 patents» and their brief and Footnote
2 is associated with this * in their brief they say as to those
14 patents they are directed to new subject matter but
additional material beyond the living subject matter is claimed*
as if that changed itB

The subject matter is alive whether it

has something combined with it or not»
/:

My point really is that the living nature of the
thing is not what has prevented it from being patented in the
past.

The Patent Office attitude has been to grant patents

on living things if they met the- other criteria such as not
being products of nature,
Now p whan somebody- ««“>
QUESTIONi

P

Can I interrupt you bn that.

You disagree with' their statement that, first of
all there i.a a difference between a patent that includes a
living thing as a component of the claimed invention and 1
guess they agrete that could be patentablee if I understand them
correctly
But when w® confine ourselves to claims that cotter
only -living things* they say only 3 out of your 68 patents
involve such examples®
Do you take issue with that statement?
ME, McXIEs
degree

Yes, X would but only to a limited

25

QUESTIONs
MR* McKIEs

I see*
Most of those patents do claim something

in addition to the living thing*

At least the patent in Funk

v. Kalo —
QUESTIONS
ME* McKIEs

Yes, I understand that*
—> claimed only living things and the

three additional patents that they refer to*

There may be

soma others but I den*t think the point is really worth
exploring as to h« many others*
But my point is that the -thing does not become dead,
unliving

because it is combined together with something else*
Really I think the way this arose in the course of

history in the Patent Office is as fallowss

Somebody

came around with a new-found kind of bacteria*
that it was useful in doing something*

They found

They went to the

Patent Office with a request to patent this and the Patent
Office said, "Nell* no, you just took something that was found
in nature, it is a product 'of nature*"
■ Then, the applicant being rather inventivex anyway,
said, “Well, now, I will claim that together with something in
which it Is not found in nature*

For instance I will

claim it with an insecticidal carrier and now I have an
insecticidal, composition and you ought to grant me that

patent*®

■,
And the Examiner says, 111 must agree with you because

26

it is not found together with the carrier,*
We have an illustration of that in 'tills very ease*
because several of the daises in this case* the allowed claims *
cover the combination of a bacterium with a carrier* namely
straw»

That bacteria is not found in straw in nature®

Therefore

it is not a product of nature but it is still alive»
•Kow, 1 don't think that the Government has justified
the distinction between the two.

And the reason I emphasize

<■

thip-'is to point out that the policy of the Government until
very recently here has bean uniform and that is to not deny
patents on laving things but rather to deny patents on products
of nature* whether they are living or not.,
How* in this case we have pointed out in addition
to '-.he number of patents that we have identified and also
the cases that we have referred to we pointed out the Patent
Office has established official classifications of patents on
living things* the reason being of course that they have a
sufficient number of patents that they want a place to put
them®

They have responded to our showing in respect ©f one

sub class only®
a

That sub class is embarrassing £0 them

tarnk because it

calls- for patents- on microorganisms alone*

or themselves ©r per \s®.

ted that is where they- are now

reduced to isi -their position®
are not patentable.

They say microorganisms alone

BUt we have pointed -out that they have &

sub ‘class on ’microorganisms alone®

Their answer to that is

27

that the international authorities wanted * sub class to bs
set up for that kind of thing, presumably because in a
national patent law this kind of thing is permitted*
Than they also say, “Well, we have so many patents
on living -things that have been granted that we have to find
a place to put them*”
Mow, us have also pointed as another form of evidence
to the Board decision in one case, the Parr case that is
identified in our brief, the reason'1 forrdoing this is that

X

they said in their brief after our response to their petition
V

■ ’I?' •

for certiorari pointed out -chat this kind of thing existed,
they said, '’Well, the Board of Appeals and the Commissioner
■’

_ *v: •; V. _

I

••

have always had the policy that patents would not 'be granted
on living things *“
' But we pointed to a Board of Appeals decision in
which a patent was granted by that Board reversing an. Examiner
and that patent was 'directed to a living thing*

We have- also pointed to Commissioner Watson'3
statement t© a congressional committee*

Commissioner was a

Commissioner of Patents in the ’Fifties under the Eisenhower
years and during his submission to the Congress he said
patents are granted on "cultures*
but groups- of microorganisms *

Well, culturas are nothing

They now seek tb interpret

■that away by saying that he must have been referring to a
process ©f doing something*

But he doesn't say anything about

a prossas of doing something, he. refers to culturos,,

And

cultures were what was claimed in the patent involved in Funk
Vo KalOf this Court's decision®
So 2 think that the evidence rather indicates that
patents have been granted over many, many years on living
things ifP as I say, they mat the statutory criteria in other
ways *
This is not a cas© such as Parker v. Flook in which

somebody seeks to extend the patent protection to a wholly
different area.®

This is rather one in which patent protection

has been granted over the years and now the administrative
agency seeks to change that position®

In our submission that

is their job,to go to Congress and get permission for such a
change.
I would like to refer for a. few moments to the
statutory history of the Plant Patent Act, because the
Government apparently is now placing its- primary reliance upon
that point®

In IS30 w® war® at a situation, rightly or wrongly,
in which patents were not being granted on plants®

Plant

breeders were -desirous of obtaining patent protection for
their work®

They want to -the Congress and asked for

congressional authority for the Patent Office to grant patents
on planta»

They obtained such authority by way of the Plant

Patent Act of If39

29

Now* whether or not the Patent Office should have
denied patents on plants prior to to IS 30 is really not
significant here but that appears to be what the Government
is really saying0

What the Government is saying is that the

plant breeder was doing very much 'the same kind of thing as
Dre Chakrabartyo

Well* I think they were doing something

rather different* but I don51 think it is worth belaboring the
pointo
point* however* is that plants were not being
patented prior to 1930 and the Congress provided for the grantihg of patents on plants<,

There is not one word in that

entire statutory history that indicates that the Congress
thought that patents could not be granted on living subject
matter,-

It is just not /chore? it is not there expressly and

it is not there compliedly,
,

Much' is made out of Secretary ‘of Agriculture Hyde's

letter but that letter was relied on only for two things,
whi h have nothing whatever to do with the statement which is
i
**

quoted'by -the Government.

That letter is relied upon by

the congressional committees for the expertise that the
Agriculture Department has in

identifying varieties of

plants and they are suggesting that the Patent Office may want
to corns to them for assistance in ais tinguishing between the
various varieties of plants a
There is -another point# which' slips ray mind at the

30

moment* which is expressly mentioned in the statutory history
in the committee reports®
QUESTIONS

May 1 ask question-on the 1930 legislation®

I guess the Government in essence argues that if this case had

been decided in your favor before 1930, that statute would
*
have bpen unnecessary,
’Would that be a correct argument?
MR, McKIEs
additional re as ms

No, I don*t -think it would be for this
The Patent Office attitude* as I say*

has been to refuse to grant patents on plants®

From everything

we can determine * that refusal was based on -the product of
nature, contention,
QUESTION:

I understand that®

And that would still

apply if it were not a hybrid or something like that®
But how does ‘that respond — it doesn’t necessarily
answer the casa' in the bottom line -*» but how does that respond
t© the suggestion that if you win here, if you had won this
issue in 1927 or 7 28 there really w©uldn*t have been any need
for a special plant statute,
MR* MCKIEs
QUESTION:

Well —
You weald have then demonstrated the

Patent Office had been wrong in its narrow view of the statute®
MR, McKIEs
Justice Stevenss

I think not* and for this reason* Mr,

The problem that the plant breeders were

having apparently* and I can judge only by what happened rather

31

than th® rationale of itj.because X don’t find the decision on
the point, but the problem apparently was that they didn’t
think that a sufficient change was being made by man»

What

they thought apparently — the Patent Office, rightly ©r
wrongly thought that the work of the chemist that was referred
to in argument earlier was quite different from the work of
the plant breeder«

The plant breeder was doing nothing but

taking the heed from one and pollen from another and mixing
them together and nature was doing the work»
Now, I say **apparently,* because X can’t justify
the rationale»

X do knew that the Commissioner of Patents

had said expressly in a very early opinion that plants were
not patentable»
QUESTION*

Do you contend that there is a different

standard of patentability, whether it be novelty or invention
or non—obvious or whatever the terra might be, under the Plant
Patent Act than there would &©• for living things like
bacteria?
HR» MGKIEs

The Plant Patent Act calls for a

different variety, which -is a different kind of problem than
unobviousnese, X think»

Not being from that particular field,

I don’t have- sufficient experience in their problems to
justify its but the statutory requirement is different than
it. is -in respect of regular patents»

So that a bacterium, X

-think, has to comply with all of the requirements of the

32

regular patent law* which are novelty* utility and non»
obviousness* as well as descriptiveness»
Now, that is another problem that the plant breeders
had before 1930 and that was that the requirements of the
patent law then, and still today except for plants, required
that you describe the invention sufficiently -that it could be
reproduced»

And you can71 describe a plant sufficiently that

it can/be reproduced».

So what happened in 1930 was that the

Congress put in a special exception for plant patents and
said* “You donst have to comply with that»K
QUESTIONS

Are plants any harder to describe than

bacteria?
■ MR» MGXIEs

Yes* indeed®

And one of tee reasons

is that in Idle bacterial area the descriptiveness problem has
existed but it has been solved by a deposit system»

What

happens in the bacterial area — ws are dealing, after all*
with microscopies, submicroscopic, perhaps* sines.of material
you can put in a recognised depositoryyand we have .at least
two major ones in this country, a sample* a freeze-dried
sample of the microorganism»

And when, you do that someone can

go that agency and extract a sample and reproduce the
invention by the, us© of that sample»
S© with that deposit system it is possible to
describe»

But mere.words would not be enough»
QUESTION §

Prior to the Plant Act what would you

33

haw said a new plant was* a composition of matter; you had
discovered a new composition of matter?

What would it have

been?
MRc McKIEs

I would think that but for the prior

decisions which indicated that it was a product of natureB I
would have claimed it as either a composition of matter or a
manufacture»
QUESTION s

And naw that —- and after the amendment,

section 4886 e I suppose than -there would be some kind of new
plants that would not he patentable under that section9 I
mean that limited the patentability of the plants to those
described in the section»
MR. McKIEs

X would think that is a probable

interpretation of the section.
QUESTIONS

Even though they might have been new

compositions of matter.
MB. McKIEs

We 11 * I think they would not have been,;,

for the reason that they would have been products ©f nature»
But that is a different matter»

My point is that the ~~

probably the rationale for the Patent Office refusing to grant
patents ©n plants earlier than that was that they were a
product of nature and man- had too little to do with the
generation and the development of the plant to make it a
manufacture rather than a composition of matter»
QUESTIONS

Before we had brand breeders —* human

34

beings — wasn't this evolutionary process taking place in
nature and when the human beings got into the act they
accelerated it and refined it*

But it was a natural process?

wasn’t it?
M». McKXEs

I think that is correct, Mr* Chief

Justice*
QUESTIONs

hnd that is why ~~ that is. the basis of the

rule that products of nature were not dependable*
.

Is that it?
*

MR« McKZSc

It may well be the case*

I have never

seen that elucidated but it sounds like a reasonable inter»

probation®
Mutations have been going on for, some people think,
in 'the order of billions of years*

And some people think that

all of living things are based on mutations from one original
parent*

But it is the fact mutations of plants and of human

beings have bean going on naturally for many, many yearse
I would like to make one further point about this
deposit system, if I may, a point that was brought up by one
of flie briefs amicus and which I forgot to make in my own
brief*
There is a merit to this deposit system that is
very important with respect to the gran-ting of patents*

If

patents are foreclosed in this particular area, then there
will be incentive to keep the microorganism secret, trade

35

secret law would then protect the microorganism»

And one

would not deposit the microorganism with one of these deposit
systemsc

With patent protection possible it is required by

the patent law that there be such a deposit and therefore
the microorganism be available to future researchers»

that

But if

that availability of patents is removed and therefore the
requirement to deposit is also removed? then it will not be
possible to build research upon research, which is the way
most research occurs*

'And there may well be a problem 'with

respect to a failure in point of time of research»

QUESTIONS

But the- resulting microorganism.; did not

36

occur in nature.
MR» WALLACES

That is correct; that is what it has

in common with the producte -of the plant breeders.
What is significantj. as we see this case, when on©
looks at the Plant Variety- Protection Act where we first haw
Congress dealing with organisms that can be biologically
reproduced on their own we have a number of protective
provisions.

Farmers can save their seed and replant it and

sell it to other fanners for replanting.

There is a protective

provision to use the seed for research purposes.

There is a

provision that the Secretary of Agriculture can impose
compulsory licensing if ha thinks the public interest warrants
it.
QUESTION:

Your colleague suggests that at this

stage of the case that absence the Plant Protection Act that
you have in effect abandoned your argument that any living
•thing cannot be patented.
MR. WALLACE:

We haven't abandoned it at all.

Before 1930 we know of no instance of a grant of a patent on
a novel organism itself.

Thera were grants on combinations

but not when the novelty claimed in the combination was
novelty in the living organism and only in a living organism.
Process patents have been granted and process involving micro­
organisms since before it was known what microorganisms were:
canning, brewing, etc.

37

QUESTIONS

Process involved only an organism»

MR. WALLACES

Well, the use of an organism in

combination with other materials and the process would specify
thafco
QUESTIONS

What is the difference? what is the

significance?
MR. WALLACE s

The significance of the difference

is that if you exclude others from being able to produce a
living organism er to offspring of the organism because
someone is granted a monopoly on the organism itself, it is
an unprecedented extension of patent monopoly to the biological
offspring of living organisms 0

And Congress has very care*»

fully controlled this in the Plant Variety Protection Act
where without equivocation the committee report said that
the existing patent law did not cover living crganism and
if the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals were upheld in this
case and a large number of patents were required fco be issued
before Congress could devise a proper system to deal with the
new technology here, then rights and equities would be built
up which would implicate Fifth Amendment taking problems
which would require Congress to consider grandfathering, to
consider treating similarly situated people differently and
so forth, where there is no indication that Congress ever
provided for -this kind of monopolization.
QUESTION^

If one looks ■— putting that immediate

38

problem to one side

if one looks at the basic reasons for

patents and the encouraging of research and development and
also encouraging disclosure of those things that have been
discoveredf what is the essential difference between bacterium
and. some new chemicals, say a new acid?
MRo WALLACES

Well, the essential difference is the

bacterium like other things engages in genetic cellular
reproduction which in the case of a microorgism means ra~
producing^the entire organism,,
that these grow in profusion,

And the- claims itself show
As a matter of fact the

original ones probably don't exist very long after they begin
to divide and grow,

And what you really have are not what

were produced in the laboratory but the generational offspring
of thoseo
QUESTION:

You fear incubation of the spores or

something of that nature?
MR, WALLACES

Well, it isn't a. fear,

It may not be

true of this particular microorganism, that it would spread.
But we are talking about & category of patentable subject
matter and when Congress first dealt with the possibility of
biological organisms that could reproduce themselves'they did
it in a way that provided for many safeguard.

Perhaps they

would want more safeguards in light of newer developments,
QUESTIONS

I suppose if these are patentable then

every time they reproduce they infringe the parent, don't

39

they?
MRc

WALLACES

QUESTIONS

Well, there are difficulties of —

Well, wouldn’t that be technically

correct?
MR» WALLACES
present patent law.

—- fitting into the conception of the

That is correct.

Or people who in saute

way facilitate their reproduction would be manufacturing them
within traditional concepts of the patent law.

They don’t

fit very well and this is one of the points that we made in
our reply brief.

But the incentive that Mr. Justice Stevens

asked about is certainly, in our view, there in the process
claims that ware allowed the Examiner right here.

But that'.

doesn8 t mean -that someone else might not be aisle to find
another process for reproducing a similar living organism
and be excluded by -die grant for this process.
We do think -the patent law does allow for claims
within the statutory categories on this technology but not —
QUESTIONS

Do they have a patent issued for the

process of putting one of these — putting these plasmas in
one of the microorganisms and creating a new microorganism,
the process of doing it?

I suppose —

MR. WALLACE*

The particular process —

QUESTION?

whether it was feasible or not as a

legal matter you have indicated that that kind of a process
patent would be all right.

40

MR. WALLACE?
QUESTION:

They were allowed in this case.

They ware allowed.

MR. WALLACES

They were; -chare were numerous process

claims that were allowed in this case.

And they were on the

process of inducing in the laboratory this hybrid organism.
The claims that ware rejected were only the claims that
attempted to get the patent on the organism itself.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs
the case is submitted.
