MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

Mr. Goldblatt, we’ll just wait until the room
clears„
I think you may proceed whenever you’re ready,
Mr. Goldblatt.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN H. GOLDBLATT, ESQ.t
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. GOLDBLATT:

Mr. Chief Justice, may It please

the Court:
This case is here on writ of certiorari from the
Third Circuit Court of Appeals, and does involve Federal
review of a State conviction pursuant to writ

of habeas

corpus.
The prosecution is here, and has sought review, of
the decision of the Third Circuit; reversing the decisions
of the Federal District Court, and the Penasy 1 vania State
courts.
The Third Circuit granted the writ of habeas corpus
on the basis that the defendant's Sixth and Fourteenth
Amendment rights had been violated by virtue of the fact
that he’d been denied the right to effective assistance of
counsel.
The case—the primary issue in the case involves

4
the issue of conflict of interest, and whether there was an
adequate showing of conflict of interest here to warrant
the granting of Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment relief.
QUEST 1017:

When was this case tried?

MRo GOLDBLATT:
QUESTION:

1967.

June?

MRo GOLDBLATTs

The crime-excuse me—-the crime

occurred in June of 1966«,
1967c

The crime was tried in June of

So it is almost 13 years old at this time, since the

time of trialc
The crime itself was an execution-style killing
of two people inside a local Teamsters' union hall in Phila­
delphia, Pennsylvania in June of 1966»

Three defendants ware

indicted for the crime in, I believe, December of 1966,
after a coroner's inquest.
The three defendants privately retained two lawyers
to repesent.

As these were first degree murder cases, they

were tried separately.

The Commonwealth moved for trial on

respondent’s case first.
Fie was convicted of two counts of first degree
murder.

The two other defendants were subsequently tried

separately and acquitted.
On the first direct appeal to the Pennsylvania—
QUESTION:

Each one of them was tried separately?

Milo GOLDS IATT:

Tried separately and acquitted, yes.

This was the only defendant, who was convicted-»
QUESTION:

There were two subsequent trials?

Hit GOLDBLATT:

Yes, there were.

In any event, there were two lawyers who repre­
sented the three defendants.
by the three defendants.

They were privately retained

There is some confusion in the

record as to how they were paid, but there is no question
but that they were not appointed by the court.
The two lawyers were two of the most prominent
lawyers in the City of Philadelphia.
In an event, after the first conviction it went
up on appeal.

It. was affinned by an evenly divided court.

Subsequent thereto, State habeas proceedings were commenced
in State court, and there was an extensive hearing.
QUESTION:
meantime?

Where is this gentleman been in the

Is he still incarcerated?
MRo GOLDBLATT:

time.

Bail has been set.

He is not incarcerated at this
It was not allowed by the

Federal courts, but bail was set by the State courts after
the Third Circuit granted relief, habeas relief.
So he is on bail at this time waiting—
QUESTION:

So he's been incarcerated some 10 or

11 years?
MRo GOLDBLATT:

He was, yes.

He was incarcerated

I believe at the time he was arrested on this crime up until

s
the time he was released after Third Circuit relief was
granted.
In any event, when it went back to State habeas
proceedings, the two lawyers who represented the three
defendants testified along with the trial judge»- the defendant»
one of the codefendants as well.
A,3 the testimony developed» it appeared that each
of the defendants

selected at his option one of the two

lawyers to be lead counsel; the other to be backup counsel.
Sullivan selected one lawyer, Judge DiBona,
who unfortunately died, about two weeks ago.

The other two

defendants selected the other attorney as their lead counsel.
Mr. DiBona testified at the post-conviction hearing,
which is our State habeas proceeding» that there was, as far
as he was concerned, no conflict of interest in the case.

All

the decisions he made were based on the best inteiests of his
client Sullivan; and that he perceived no problems in any of
his representation.
Now, the key to this case, and the key that
troubled the Third Circuit was, Mr. Peruto, when he testified,
indicated in one small part of his testimony that he had
some regrets.

He felt that perhaps he may have advised

Sullivan to hold back on presenting his defense, because he
thought the case was won.

He thought Sullivan had the case

won, because the Commonwealth did not present, sufficient

evidence to convict.

And therefore, why put on the defense

when you could save it for the other two cases.
Now, as I say Judge DiBona indicated that he had
absolutely no basis or motivation for his decision not to put
on a defense; it had nothing to do with the decision at all.
In any event, when the case got to the Pennsylvania
Supreme Court on the conflict issue, that Court ruled that
there was no true dual representation in the true sense,
because of the lead counsel situation, and the backup counsel
situation; and found under the circumstances that there was

no conflict on the record.
The District Court essentially upheld that ruling,
finding, in its conclusion-—crediting Judge DiBona's testimony
as to what motivated him 'as to why he did what he did.
QUESTION:

Well, if they believed Judge DiBona,

they didn't have much alternative about the decision, did
they?
MR. GOLDBLATT:

The Third Circuit, however, the

panel, when they got the case, held that the legal conclusion
that there was no dual representation was erroneous; that
there was a clear indication on the record that there was
dual representation.

And there were indices that. Perufco

did participate in the defense of Sullivan.

Thex*e5s no

question about that, and we don't dispute that.
He was present; he was at counsel table; and. did

8

aid in the defense of Sullivan»
The key to the case is the standard employed in the
Third Circuit for view of conflict problems , and that

is, the

possibility of conflict, however remote—
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Goldblatt, before you get to

that, in your question three, on your petition for certiorari,
you raise the—whether the Federal court failed to give proper
deference to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania's determination
on a factual issue; that is, whether there was a conflict Of
interest»
Now, are you arguing now that dual representation
is or is not a mixed question of fact or law, a question of
law, a question of fact, and whether conflict of interest 'is
a question of fact if not dual representation.
MR. GOLDBLATT:

What I am saying-—argument three,

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I believe goes to the question,
assuming the Third Circuit panel is correct in their
conclusion—two conclusions, one that there is evidence of
dual representation on the record.

And I would concede,

that is a legal conclusion from the record»

It’s not. a

factual conclusion.
And if.they're also correct that the standard,
possibility of conflict, however remote, is an appropriate
standard of review, even in that event this case
to be remanded to the District Court.

would have

Because the Third

9
Circuit, in rejecting the District Court and State court,
made its own findings of fact, based on a record that is
totally disputed in every way and every step of the way up,

In other words, it's not a situation where they're
adopting District Court £indings or State court findings ?
nobody has made relevant findings under their theory of the
case.

And they proceeded—
QUESTION;

When was the issue of dual representation

first raised?
MR. GOLDBLATT:

The issue of dual representation

was first raised, of course, in the State habeas proceedings.
QUESTION:

But not at the time of the trial?

MR. GOLDBLATT:

No, not at the time of the trial.

There was no pretrial request for separate counsel.

There

was no issue of separate counsel.
QUESTION:

How about on appeal?

MR. GOLDBLATT;
either.

On first appeal there was no issue,

It was not until collateral attack.
So what I'm saying, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist, we

don’t reach argument three until we get through argument—the
first two.-

If we win it, and are successful in convincing

the Court that there

should be an actual conflict standard,

argument three won't even he reached.

There's notenough

evidence on this record to find an actual conflict.
Excuse me.

QUESTION ;

How long after the original conviction

and trial was the collateral proceeding in which this issue
was first raised?
MR. GOLDBLATT;

I believe the collateral proceeding

at which this was first raised would have, been in about 1972
or 3, and I’m sure counsel will correct me if I’m wrong.
QUESTION;

Some years after?

MR. GOLDBLATT;
about that.

It was some years after,, no question

There’s no question the first tine this issue

cones up is well after conviction, well after the first
appeal.

Of course, the first-—
QUESTION;

Wasn't a re-appeal granted?

MR. GOLDBLATT;
QUESTION;

That's correct.

Which coincided with the appeal in the

habeas.
MR. GOLDBLATT;

That is correct.

What happened at

the first habeas proceeding in State courts, as a matter of
fact, is that the hearing court found ineffective assistance
of counsel on the first direct appeal.

Ironically, one of the

reasons they found ineffective assistance was because the ease
had not been argued on direct appeal, and because the Court
had split 3-3 on the issue of sufficiency of evidence.

So a

new appeal was granted.
On the new appeal, it was argued and fully briefed
by both sides, and the court split 5-2, that there was

11
sufficient evidence„
In any event, moving back to the focus of the issuef
as far as the standard employed by the Third Circuit, we
would submit that this is not a standard at all»
QUESTION:

Before you leave it, the first action

of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania would vindicate the
judgment of the trial counsel that this case---or give soma
vindication to the notion that it was not necessary to put
on any evidence„

MRo GOLDBLATT:

There is no question; as

.a matter

of fact, the Third Circuit even noted that had independent
counsel made every decision that was made in this case,
they would have little trouble finding effective assistance,,
They found every decision that was made strategically sound,
but held simply because of the possibility of conflict,
however remote, on the record, the entire proceedings had
to be vitiated, and unless the State retried him, the
defendant had to be discharged from custody»
Now, this Court of course has dealt most recently
in Holloway v„ Arkansas with a situation where there is a
pretrial request for separate counsel by a lawyer; and the
court has held there that absent an inquiry by the court to
determine that no conflict existed, that request must be
honored.

That representation by counsel that there is a

potential for conflict

This presents, however, the issue left unanswered
in Holloway, which is, what do you do when the issue is
first raised on collateral attack, where there is no objection
pretrial?
Here you have the additional factors that you have
separate trials for these defendants? this isn’t a joint
trial.

These are separate trials with the same lawyers

representing them, which substantially reduces any potential
for problems of conflict of interest, or certainly eliminates
a myriad of problems that could otherwise occur.
And what we submit is, especially when we’re
dealing with a State habeas review, a standard of possibility
of conflict, however remote, is far too lenient and far too
minimal to justify the granting of relief.
QUESTION:

Mr. Goldblatt, you said earlier in

your argument, the record wasn’t clear as to who paid the
lawyers.

I was under the impression that the defendants "who

were tried later, rather than the respondent, had paid the
lawyers.
Is that not clear?
MRo GOLDBLATT:
of that.

There’s not even a clear indication

Because what happens is, there was sons testimony—

and again—
QUESTION:

Isn't that, though, what the Third

Circuit and the District judges assumed?

Or am I wrong?

13
MRo GOLDBLATT:

The Third Circuit assumed that.

And I think it assumes it from the testimony of the
defendant Sullivan at the State habeas hearing that he
didn't have any money? he didn't pay them; he didn't know how
it came about.
QUESTION:

Well, if the Third Circuit made that,

factual assumption for the purposes of its decision,, and if
you haven't questioned that, shouldivt we assume that to be
the fact for our decision?
I don't know if it makes any difference.
MR. G0LD3LATT:

No, that's argument three.

Argu­

ment three in our brief is, assuming all the legal standards,
and when you get there, the Third Circuit made any number
of factual findings to reach its conclusion that had never
been fovnd by the District Court; that had never been found
in the State courts.
What the Third Circuit did was, they said, well
the State courts didn't reach the issue we wanted.
didn't make adequate State findings.

And they

For that purpose, we

don't dispute it.
What we’re saying is, at that point they can't make
the findings from a cold record.

Because the record is

disputed.
QUESTION:

It seems to me the legal issue night be

a little different if you say a man being represented by

counsel for two codefendants who are paying the lawyer,
conceivably you’d have a little different standard than one
where there isn't that factual situation.»

1 don’t know,

but I—

MR. GOLDBLATT:

You may or you may not.

You don’t

have enough on this record to really determine who was
paying.

You don't know if the Teamsters were paying.

lawyer too.15

They said, "Well, you can use cur

That was already—

QUESTIONs

But was it at least clear that Sullivan

did not pay for his own lawyer?
MR. GOLDBLATT;
Sullivan.

Is that much clear?

There is that testimony from

That is all X can say.

There is no credited

factual finding that Sullivan's testimony is truthful.
Even the Third Circuit—
QUESTION:

But there’s no contrary testimony,

either?
MR. GOLDBLATTs

No.

QUESTION?

It's unrebutted testimony.

QUESTION:

And it's also clear, isn't it, that

these lawyers were retained lawyers?
appointed?

They were not court-

15
MR. GOLDBLATT;

Absolutely clear; there was no

court appointment in this case.
QUESTION;

So presumably they werenst working

for nothing,, and if Sullivan didn't pay for them, somebody
did.
MR. GOLDBLATT;

There was some indication actually

in the record that perhaps they were working for nothing.
QUESTION;

Certainly the Court didn’t have to

believe a quote interested statement of Sullivan on the
point.
MR. GOLDBLATT;
though.

Certainly not.

That’s our point,

All this material in the record is just testimony?

there are no findings.

The various State courts and the

District court largely found it ireelevant on the basis of
Judge DiBona's testimony, which was credited.
The Third Circuit gets the case, and they say,
"We don’t really care that much about Judge DiBona’s
testimony.

We find dual representation if Penito did

anything in the case.

And we are now going to glean the

record, and pick and choose what we think may be possibilities
of conflict."
Now, what we’re saying is, if there’s a credited
factual finding after the disputed record is resolved by
a fact-finder, then if you find possibility of conflict by
an appellate court, fine.

But you can't just take a cold

16
record-—
QUESTION:

Did not Mr. Peruto, on some of the

disputed items, say that he would defer to DiBona's recol­
lection?
MR, GOLDBLATT%
QUESTION:

He most certainly did.

And that DiBona was the lead counsel,

and he made the decisions?
MRo GOLDBLATT:
question about that.

That is correct.

There is no

And indeed—and there is some

confusion in the Third Circuit opinion about it—Peruto—
\vhat

we've been arguing all along is that a large part of

Peruto's testimony should be

believed.

We have never conceded that that portion of Peruto1'
testimony where he said he felt he was operating under a
conflict should be believed.

And indeed, we argued through

the State courts and the District court that that should be
expressly disbelieved.
We have never argued that that should be credited.
Now, the Third Circuit said when we got there that we
suddenly were arguing that the Court should believe Peruto8s
testimony.

We were simply making the same argument we made

all along, that parts of it should be believed, but other
parts of it, not.
In any event, just to focus back on the problem,
we submit that the standard for State habeas review, on

17
collateral attack, where there’s been no objection pretrial,
where there3 s been no trigger to a constitution requirement
that the judge inquire pretrial at all presented by the case,
that the defendant should be required to show actual conflict.
Now, the point we’ve attempted to make here is
that Mr. Peruto5 s testimony that he wanted to hold back the
defense witnesses, even if credited, is meaningless unless
you show that, there are defense witnesses that could be
presented„
And Judge DiBona testified that once the decision
was made by the defendant to not testify, there were no good
witnesses to present.
So what we have is the Third Circuit,

Nov?, in

the Third Circuit’s response-—what we’re saying is, please
look at the record—-there was no showing of any real defense
witness to present.
not do.

The Third Circuit said, "No, that we will

What you’re asking ns to do is to make an actual confl

determination.

And that we won’t do.

All we're concerned

with is the possibility, however remote.B
And what we submit is, the possibility, however
remote, is not a standard of reversal? it’s a standard of
prohibition.

And this was noted in the Three Judge opinion,

dissenting from the denial of reargument, that the effect of
a possibility

of conflict, however remote, standard, when

applied the way it was in this case, is to literally bar

10
joint representation within those courts that cone into the
circuit.

Because the risk is so great that you’re going to

lose on collateral attack*, if that’s the only thing that the
defendant has to show, that there’s literally no point in
risking joint representation.
Now* with that in mind, we have a second issue
which is more or less alternative to the first? it's not'—
\

After no evidence—after the

Commonwealth was ordered to proceed? presented no evidence?

QUESTION;

And what witnesses testified for the

defense in Carchidi's trial other than Carchidi?
MR. GOLDBLATT:

Did the—

Interestingly enough, at page 183

of the Appendix, Judge DiBona testified that only one
civilian witness testified at the Carchidi trial.
QUESTION;

Is that the other janitor?

ME. GQLDBLATT:

That was Michael Hessian, and he

was called by the Commonwealth.
QUESTION;
at Carchidi’s trial?

And so they did not put any defense in
Other than—

MRo GG1DBLATT;

There was a defense.

There were

various police officers who were put cn at Carchidi8s trial.
But they literally showed no witness having1 not been presented
at Sullivan's trial that was presented at Carchidi's; that
was held back from the Sullivan trial because of the conflict.
QUESTION;

Well, the thing I don't quite under­

stand, if there were police officers put on the stand by
the defense in the Carchidi trial—presumably, they gave
helpful testimony, or at least, testimony they thought would
be helpful—
MRo GQLDBLATT;

They did not know of that

testimony at the time of the Sullivan trial.
QUESTION;

They didn't know about it?

MRo GQLDBLATT;

They didn't know about it

when that was litigated»

Neither lawyer.

There was so

conflict problem with that; they just did not discover the
availability of a particular piece of evidence»
QUESTIONi

You mean, the only tactical decision

was whether to put on Sullivan himself?
MRo GOLDBL&TT:
QUESTION;

There was that tactical decision-”

That isn’t the impression I got from

the opinion.
MR. GOLDBLATT:

Well, the Third Circuit opinion—

again, this is what we argued—there*s an argument that
there were three witnesses outside the union building»

Those

weren’t put on at Carehidi*s trial, according to Judge
QiBona*s testimony»
ever showed.

And the point we’re making is, nobody

Everybody said—Peruto said there were three

witnesses outside the union hall who he didn't want to put
on at Sullivan's trial, because he was afraid that they
might identify one of the other two defendants»
Now, what was never shown was what on earth
those witnesses were going to testify to to help Sullivan,
Everyone was going to tell—Peruto was willing to say why
he didn’t want to put them on, but never explained why he
would have wanted to put them on.

There was no showing how

they could have helped Sullivan.
And that's the point we're making.

No such

witness was presented at the State habeas proceeding.to

21
say, I'm available, I'm a witness, I could have testified
to the following.
You run the risk—
QUESTION:

It's a puzzling case, because 1

remember-—as I remember, Perufco did testify that one of the
facts in their minds was the fact that if they did put on
some other witnesses, that might prejudice the trials in the
other two cases.
MRo GOLDBLATT:
problems

That's correct.

But that's the

He says that, but when it comes to the next point,

okay, who are you talking about?, that's where the record
drops out.

That's the- end of it.
And what we're saying is, under the Third Circuit

standard, you run the risk of granting someone a new trial,
effectively, so that he can put on a defense that doesn't
exist.

Because you haven't inquired far enough to find

that actual conflict, to make them put that witness up and
show who it is.
That's why the record is so confusing.
QUESTION:

Did the lead counsel agree with Mr.

Peruto?
MR. GOLDBLATT:

No, the lead counsel most certain­

ly did not agree with Mr. Peruto.

He said:

"no conflict,

no witnesses."
As a matter of fact, the witness they offered,

22
they witness they said shouldhave been called, for the
defendant, was the codefendant Carchidi.
How, one thing I think is perfectly clear, that if
there had been.separate counsel in this case, there is no
way counsel for Carchidi, who was awaiting trial on two
murder counts with a possible death penalty, was going to
allow him to testify at Sullivan's trial»
That is the only tangible witness»

And he

testifies at the State habeas proceeding after he has been
acquitted, and says, "Yes, I would have testified for
Sullivan had he called me»"
available witness.

That., I would submit, is not an

And again, what he would have done to

aid the defense is not even clear from the record»
Now the one point 1 would like to touch on, ~r>d
that would go to argument two in our brief, which as I asay,
is an alternative argument, is, whether or not the
defendants have made out the requisite State action.

Now,

it!s clear, coming in via the Fourteenth Amendment, there
must be some State action.
And what we would submit is, under the particular
facts of this case, given the fact that both lawyers were
retained, absent a showing of actual conflict rather than
the possibility, however, remote, that there is no State
action.

There is nothing the court could have done.

nothing the Court should have been aware of to do.

There's
There

23
is nothing the prosecutor should have done, or should have
been aware of.
And we would submit, where retained counsel is
in the case, and there is no actual concrete conflict that
is shown, there is no state action.

And this is fairly

consonant with the Fifth Circuit standard on general
ineffectiveness claims, and what must be shown, where you have
retained—
QUESTION:

On that basis, there wouldn't be

any State action if some State presented perjured testimony
unknowingly.
MRo GOLDBLATT:

No, because then I think you

would get into a question of the State being the operating
force for doing it.

In other words, the State is still

putting on that testimony.
QUESTION:

Well, there’s nothing they can do about i

MR. GOLDBLATT:

All we're saying here, Mr. Justice

white, is that where there's an actual conflict, then the
State apparatus is automatically implicated, regardless of
whether the Judge knew about it or the prosecutor.

But

where there is absolute—only a possibility, however remote,
there's nothing in the State machinery that’s implicated in
creating the error.
QUESTION:

Well, suppose a lawyer representing

a defendant just hires out to somebody else?

Suppose

he

24
deliberately makes sure this man gets convicted—he knows o f
some evidence that he should have put on, but he's paid not
to put it on.

The .State doesn't know anything about it.

MRo GOLDBLATT:

That's actual conflict.

In other words, all I’m saying here—*X'n not saying
that where you have retained counsel in a situation where you
can come into court and prove that an actual conflict took
place, that you're not entitled to relief.
saying, yes, you would.

There I'm

Because there you implicate not

only the Sixth Amendment? you also implicate—
QUESTION:

Well, what's the State action in my

example?
MR. GOLDBLATTs

In that example where you have

actually shown a conflict of interest existed, you have a
denial of a fundamentally fair trial, number one'.
QUESTION;

Yes, but not by the—just by the fact

that the State has convicted him?
MR. GOLDBLATT:

Just by virtue, the State has

convicted him.
QUESTION:

The State has convicted him.

MR. GOLDBLATT:

And that is the state

of—as it

is applied in the Fifth Circuit where they say, where
there’s actual conflict# itcs automatically implicated.
QUESTION;
conflict?

Well, and what about a possibility of

25
MR. GOLDBLATT:

What I’m suggesting is, where

you’re talking about the possibility of : conflict, however
remote, that is not enough.

That there must be a showing of

an actual conflict of interest, not merely a guess; not
merely a probability.
There the defendant, in order to show the
requisite State action, should at least be required to show
that his conviction was tainted by an actual aonflict.
QUESTION;

Mr. Goldblatt, in both cases the StateSs

action is precisely the same.

They try him both times,

deprive him of his liberty, and the judge knows nothing
about the misconduct of counsel;

neither does the prosecutor.

Yet in one case you find State action, in the
other you do not.
MR. GOLDBLATT;

You will, firstly, of course have

the State machinery implicated in every criminal case.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. GOLDBLATT:
QUESTIONs

It will be there in any case.

But your test of State action turns on

the seriousness or the character of the constitutional-—or
the alleged constitutional violation.
MR. GOLDBLATT;

It’s not so much the seriousness

or the character of it; it's the degree of proof.

Where you

can in fact show that an actual conflict took place, then
the implication of State action will be assumed.

But where

26

you haven't shown it—it's almost a degree of proof,,
QUESTION:

It was something which took place without

the knowledge of any officer of the State, without the
knowledge of the prosecutor or the judge, and without any
duty to inquire, if I understand your facts.
MRo GOLDBLATT:

No, what

I'm saying is, if in

fact you’ve shown that it is something that took place—
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Justice White's example,

that you assume Mister—one of these two lawyers was paid a
large sum of money by the union to railroad the first
defendant and get the two--other two off, something like
that.
You’d say-—why would there be State action there
and not in this case?

That's what. I just don't quite get.

MR. GOLDBLATT:

All I'm saying is if ••-what I’m

saying, to analogize to this case, what I'm arguing is,
if you come in and you prove that somebody was paid off,
there is State action.
If you come in and you prove—

By a private party.

MR. GOLDBLATT:
QUESTION:

By

What's the State action?

MR. GOLDBLATT:

The State action is the implication

of the State machinery in the process.

All I’m saying is, in

one case you would prove that the State has obtained a

conviction through that payoff, be it advertently or
inadvertently*

There would not have been any real

So State action becomes irrelevant.

HR. GOLDBLATT:

It would become immaterial in

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Ms. Gelb^
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARILYN J. GELB, ESQ*,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MS. GELB:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court s
This case—this is a capital case.

These were

two murder charges that were levelled against Mr. Sullivan
and two codefendants.
The position of the respondent in this case is
that there were actual conflicts, and at. least one instance
of prejudice, and this Court need not reach other issues

23
raised by Hr. Goldblatt.
QUESTION:

Well, that isn’t what was decided

MS. GELB:

The Third Circuit proceeded just to

below.

apply its standard—
QUESTION:

Hell, I know.

But we would have to

make findings that were not found below to find actual
conflict.
MS o GELB:

Sir f I would like to take a few moments

at this time to review the procedural history.

Because I

think—
QUESTION:

Well, just tell me—just tell me—

MS. GELB:

And that"s what I think answers the

QUESTION:

—just tell me what basis did the

question.

Third Circuit use to set aside these convictions.
MS. GELB:

Yes, sir»

The Third Circuit pointed

to specific instances.
QUESTION:

Did it say, actual conflict, or

a possibility of conflict?
MS. GELB:

The Third Circuit referred to conflict.

QUESTION:

Possibility, however remote.

MS. GELB:

That is the standard that the Third

Circuit has enunciated in the past, and that it applied to
the facts of this case.

29
QUESTION:

Well,, then, it did not find—how can

you say if found an actual conflict, if that's the standard
it applied?
MS. GELBs

In several respects.

First of all,

because the possibility of the conflict in several instances—
and I will be glad to refer to the record to show you which
those instances are—did in fact become the conflict.
It is, in fact, the conflict in the lawyer's
perception of what he has to do for a client which clouded
his judgment; and that is the conflict.

It’s not. necessarily

a conflict that's borne out of inconsistent defenses, although
that, too, isa conflict.
QUESTION:

Well, would you. say that we are

entitled, here, to judge the case on—by the standard of
actual conflict'?

Is that the standard we should use?

MS» GELB:

I would say that that is what, the

Third Circuit did in this case.
QUESTION:

Well, so we should—

MSo GELB:

And the Third Circuit did it—

QUESTION:

■—we should judge this case by that

MS. GELB:

No, sir, because I think that the

standard?

Third Circuit's enunciated standard is a good standard.

I

would say that this Court need not decide whether there was
a speculative conflict, or whether there was a. potential

30
for a conflict, whether there was anything vague about what
the Third Circuit did»

Because the factual underpinnings

of this case, which the Third Circuit noted in its opinion,
would support a conclusion of an actual conflict.
QUESTION:

What do you have to say about DiBona"s

MS. GELB:

I'd like to say, sir, of DiBonaEs

testimony?

testimony that he testified that he and Perufco were co-counsel
in this case.

The fiction somehow that there was a lead

counsel and a backup counsel did not spring from any
testimony in the record.

Quite to the contrary, both

attorneys viewed themselves as having the same responsibilities.
It may be that one--that during certain periods
of the trial, that Mr. Peruto was not examining witnesses
whereas Mr. DiBona was; but there were also periods of time
when Mr. Peruto was doing the death penalty speech to the
jury; when Mr. Peruto in fact rested the case for the
defendant, Sullivan, without putting on any evidence, and
said, "My client trusts the case to me, and I rest the case."
Peruto, in fact, voir dired the jury; this was a
death penalty voir dire, and Peruto conducted that voir
dire.

The Third Circuit found, as a matter of fact, that

there were so many indicia of actual representation by
Peruto that in fact it supported the conclusion that was
reached by DiBona in his testimony that the two were in fact

3!
co-counsel in this case,
QUESTION;

If one was to believe—
\

MS o GELB:

Could I—

QUESTION;

If one was to believe Judge DiBona's

testimony—Mr. DiBona at that tine—
MSo GELBs

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

--what's the basis for the Third

Circuit’s conclusions?
MSo GELB:

The basis is that Mr. Peruto, who

also represented Mr. Sullivan, was co-counsel with Mr.
DiBona? that the two of them had ongoing responsibilities to
the other two.
QUESTION:

Mr. Peruto testified that wherever his

testimony was different from that of DiBona, he would defer
to Mr. DiBona because he was lead counsel.
MSo GELB:

Well, sir, Mr. Peruto was being

deferential to Mr. DiBona because Mr. DiBona was at that
t

time, the time of post-conviction proceedings, Judge DiBona,
and Mr. Peruto had to appear before him many tines.
However, that is not all that Mr. Peruto said
in this record.

If I may quote the other instances, I can—

QUESTION:

Judge DiBona's testimony was that he

urged Sullivan to take the stand.
MS» GELB:

Yes, sir, that was his testimony.

QUESTION:

Well, Ms. Gelb, we do have a cold

32
record here, as the Third Circuit also did.

And if you'll

look at 9B of the Appendix to the petition for a writ of
certiorari, which has a portion of the Third Circuit's
opinion, they refer the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania's
findings--it5s the blue—-they refer to the Supreme Court of
Pennsylvania8s^language,"we therefore hold that there is
absolutely no evidence, that a conflict existed."

That's the

Supreme Court of Pennsylvania.
Then the Third Circuit goes on to say, "Respondents
urge, that this conclusion is a finding of fact by a State
after a full hearing which is entitled to a presumption of
correctness

and should be accepted by this court.

argues that we should reject it...

Petitioner

The magistrate

accepted petitioner's position, while the district judge
accepted respondents J.

We believe both were mistaken in

their approach to this problem."
Now, what do you take the Third Circuit to mean
by saying that?
MS o GELB:

I take the Third Circuit to have

examined the precise procedural history of this case, and to
have concluded that the factual underpinnings supported this
conclusion of law that there was, number one, dual repre­
sentation, and number two, a conflict of interest, or at
least a possibility for a conflict of interest.
And if I might take a moment at this time, sir,

33
to discuss the procedural history, because I fear that there
be some cloud on that history, as it was rather tortuous
when it proceeded through the courts.
It appeared that after Sullivan was convicted,
an appeal—well, post-verdict motions were filed by both
attorneys.

Thereafter the case rather sat for almost a year,

during which time—six months after the conviction of
Sullivan—Carchidi was tried and. was acquitted, and
DiPasquale was tried and was acquitted.
Thereafter, post-verdict motions were argued for
Sullivan by both counsel, ana were denied 2-1—there was a
court involving three judges—2-1, there was a denial.
Then, Mr. DiBona and Mr. Peruto appealed to the
Supreme Court of Pennsylvania.

And that’s where the case

sat for some-—-well over three years.

Because the appeals

were filed, if my recollection serves me correctiy, in
August of 1960»

And the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania

never decided this case until December 29th of 1971.
It is entirely possible, and likely, I say, from
i

the factual context, that the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania
did not decide the case for that very lengthy period of time
because there was no argument by either counsel, Mr. DiBona
having become a judge at this time.

Mr. Peruto did not

argue these capital cases before the Supreme Court of
Pennsylvania.

Continuances, numerous ones, were requested

34
during this lengthy period of time.

And,

as a matter of

fact, there was a very strong controversy as to whether any
brief was ever filed on behalf of Sullivan.
The duties and obligations which were owed to
Sullivan were simply dropped.

They were simply abandoned.

And he was abandoned in the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania,
as he was to later argue, on post-conviction proceedings„
Now, that is the reason post-conviction proceedings
were initiated some years later.

It was not because he

sat on any rights he thought he had.

And it was not because

he wanted merely to express some sort of lament later on that
he wasn't acquitted, as were the two codefendants.
It was because that was filed most timely, the
post-conviction proceedings followed by a short period of
time the decision of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, and
petition for' reargument that was filed in the Supreme Court
following the decision of the Supreme Court.
QUESTION:

The conviction was affirmed by the

Supreme Court of Pennsylvania on December 29, 1971.
MS„ GELS:

1971, sir, that5 s right.

QUESTION:

And that appeal was never argued; is

that correct?
MS. GELB:

That's correct, sir.

QUESTION:

And there!s some question about whether

or not a brief was ever filed?

35
MS. GELS2

There is a. very strong question.

And

that was one of the issues raised in post-conviction
proceedings.

There's no issue here, I knew.

QUESTION s

Does that mean there was no

opinion?

MS« GELB2

There was an opinion, but the opinion

had nothing whatever

to do with conflictofinterest.

It

had nothing whatever

to do with dual representation, because

those issues were never raised.

MSo GELS;

The case got back to that Court,

And so the lower court

The problem of conflict?

Yes, sir.

MS, GELB:

Our position is that it is not the

Because our position is that there is some

evidence on the record of the trial that should have alerted
the trial judge to a conflict of interest,
QUESTION: Well, when was it asserted?
MS, GELBs

However, it was actually asserted

by

counsel-“-by counsel other than DiBona and Peruto—in
post-conviction proceedings,

And that was the first time

that the time was opportune to make that assertion, because,
on appeal, whatever that first appeal was or wasn't, same
counsel

allegedly represented Mr, Sullivan,
QUESTION:

But am I not correct that the second

time before the Court was also a direct appeal by leave of

of the post-conviction court to take a direct appeal,

The first time the State of Pennsylvania

knew about the conflict claim, it was in 1975, eight years
after the conviction.
MS. GELB:

The post-conviction

court knew about it in 1973 when the petition was filed, and
amended petitions were filed.
QUESTION;

And then what happened—

MSo GELB:

And that was the first time the issue

When it was back on the second direct

appeal, what was the result?
MS. GELB:

The result there was a 5-2 decision,

first of all the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania held that it
was proper to proceed in this matter, and that the lower
court was correct in permitting an appeal to be taken on the
ineffective assistance in the appellate process issue; and
then proceeded' to decide adversely to Sullivan on the
merits of the case.

Adversely as to the conflict issue as

well, except that there is in my opinion quite a decision
to be made here, because, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania
then decided, "We will not. really reach the conflicts issue,

39
because we're going to decide"—excuse me—"that there was
no dual representation. "
And the ground for the decision that the
Supreme Court asserted for not finding dual representation
was then, for the first time, this what 1 consider to be a
fiction, that there was primary and

secondary counsel.

There really is no such status in the Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania.
QUESTION:

Well, didn't Mr. Peruto say that him­

He did not say that himself.

Because he had deferred to Mr. DiBona.

Yes, he was deferring to Judge DiBonaSs

recollection, because DiBona—Judge DiBona had testified
earlier in the post-conviction proceedings.
QUESTION:

And he said he deferred because

DiBona was lead counsel, did he not?
MS. GELB:

Yes, sir; he did say that.

That's

QUESTION:

So that as between the two counsel,

correct.

they thought that there was a lead counsel and a co-counsel.
IIS. GELB;

Interestingly enough, in the perception

of counsel, Judge DiBona also said that he was lead counsel
in the Carchidi case at that time.

So that. I think there

really are problems, factually, and I’m—

40

QUESTIONS

Mr. Peruto thought he was lead counse

in that case, didn’t he?
MS. GELB;

He was lead counsel in that case, sir

as he tried the case.

But at the time of the Sullivan case,

there is some evidence that Mr. DiBona referred to himself
as counsel for my other client, Carchidi, and considered
himself lead counsel for Carchidi.
Now, they may have changed back and forth? I
don't really know, the record is not clear on that.
On the issue, incidentally- of the Carchidi
trial, X would most certainly take issue with Mr, Goldblatt,
because I—although it is true that the post-conviction
judge in the court of common pleas agreed, to incorporate
the Carchidi record in the Sullivan record, I don *t know
whether that was actually done.
record.

Because I do not have that

And I have been told by the District Attorney’s

office, that the District Attorney's office does not have
it.

The original record is certainly not in the original

court file in Philadelphia.
And so I would make the assumption, therefore,
that it is not before this Court.

And 1 do not, therefore,

know in fact what happened in the Carchidi trial.
QUESTION:

Ms. Gelb, let me ask you a question

about, your kind of ultimate theory here.
MSe GELB:

But. I—

Yes, sir,

41
QUESTION;

The possibility of a conflict»

You say there was. an actual conflict, I'm sure.
MS. GELB;

Yes, sir.

QUESTION;

Secondarily, you argue, the possibility

of a conflict is enough, don’t you?
MS. GELB;

Yes, sir.

QUESTION;

As the Third Circuit holds.

If you take that position, is it your view that
if the trial judge was on notice of the fact that Peruto
and DiBona had these other clients with other trials pending,
that it was his duty just to say to them-—call the—what
was he supposed to do, call the defendant up and say, you
have a right to have a separate lawyer?

And then I assume

if the defendant said, well, I’m satisfied with these two
lawyers, would that have been the end of the matter?
MS. GELB:

I don’t think it would have been the

end of the matter, where you'd have an actual conflict,
no, sir.
Because the seme attorney—
QUESTION;

But you’d then have to prove actual

conflict if he did that.
MS. GELB;

That’s right.

And I would suggest

to this Court, that the trial judge knew that there was, at
the very least, a possibility of a conflict.

The trial

judge first of all was assigned all three cases.

And

42
therefore became aware of the fact-—
QUESTION:

What is your view of the conflict?

The

conflict is that there are some witnesses he might have put
on if—you disagree with your opponent—■
MSo GELB:

I do,

QUESTION:

"—that we don't know who those

witnesses are or anything like that?
MSo GELB:

I do disagree, and I will make an

effort to go into the factual background, because I do
think it's important in this case.
You see, DiBona, who tried this case to the jury,
opened to the jury, and told the jury that there were very
important witnesses, three of whom were outside the window
of the building where these crimes were committed, and if
in fact the crimes were committee at the time that the
Commonwealth was arguing they were committed, then these
three witnesses who were waiting for-—-to come into the
union hall for a meeting would most certainly have heard the
shots ring out as well, and they would be very important
to show that the crime actually was committed at the time
that the Commonwealth wanted the court to believe that it was
committed,
Now, there’s no question that the crimes were
committed.

There's no question about the heinous character

of the crimes.

As a matter of fact, that kind of factual

43
background has been used by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
over and over again»
The importance, however, is as to what evidence
there was which implicated Sullivan in the commission of
these crimes.

And that was the issue that split the

Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. 3-3 the first time on the
sufficiency that before that split the lower court involved,
2-1 o
The issue of Mr. Sullivan's complicity, if at
all, was a very, very important issue.

And in light of the

fact that this was a capital case, it would seem to me that
counsel, whose loyalties were not divided, would have done
everything that he or she could have done to bring about a
proper verdict.
Now, that would have included using independent
judgment as to whether to call to testify three witnesses
outside the window at the time the crimes were committed.
Now, there was independent—
QUESTION?

Weren't some of the three witnesses

called by the prosecution?
MSo GELB:

What is it?

QUESTION;

Weren't sene of those three witnesses

you’re referring to called by the prosecution?
MS. GELB:

No, sir.

That's exactly the point.

They were under subpoena to the prosecution, and they were

44
ready and available to testify.

In fact* another witness not

in that same category* outside the window* was also under
subpoena to the prosecution.

Those four witnesses were

outside the courtroom under Commonwealth subpoena* ready to be
called.
As a matter of fact* DiBona

said that in his

opening argument; he said that in a side bar conference with
the Judge; he said that in his closing argument.

He argued—

after he put on no testimony at all—-he argued in closing* I
don't know the Commonwealth didn't call these witnesses
who were outside the window at the time that these crimes
were committed.

And in so doing* he really invited the

prosecutor to comment on-the fact that the defense hadn't
called those very witnesses.
Judge DiBona said those witnesses were vital
at that time.

Yet he didn't call them.

And that is the

same Judge—
QUESTION:
that.

Well, there's an explanation for

The last thing I suppose this Court should do would

be to get into all these details.

But there was an

explanation* and that is* they fear that one or more of
those witnesses would say that he saw one or more of those
people running out of the room* running out of the building.
MSo GELB;

But it's not true.

Perufco said years later.

That's what Mr.

And I think—

My question is;

Where do you get the

right for the State to be required to give you separate

Yes.

I'm saying that in a case where there's a

infects the whole trial, because conflict will upset fair

egregious wrong to the defendant and to the whole system—

in the record.

MSo GELBs

Sir, I think that the extent of the

inquiry that could be conducted between a judge and a
defendant before him is, in fact, limited by attorney-client

There was never any effort, however, to find

out anything about this defendant's understanding of his
right to separate counsel.

Never any effort whatever.

I agree, if Your Honor is suggesting that in
fact the trial judge could not have inquired, "Mr. Sullivan,
exactly what are your defenses?

Would you please tell me

MS<, GELS:

I think that’s correct, sir; I don’t

know from the record, but 1 think that’s correct.
At any event the—the trial that resulted from
what we consider to be conflict resulted because of the
fact that Fir, Peruto guarded evidence, held it close to the
vest, did not disclose it in the trial of Sullivan, and he
did so out of fear that in so guarding, he may be tipping
his hand in the case of the two codefendants who were not
yet tried.
And I think that that creates a situation more
egregious, more difficult to

handle, than a situation

where all three were tried at one and the same time.
QUESTION: When did Mr, Peruto first tell about
those things?
MSo GEL'S:

When he was subpoenaed to testify in

post-conviction proceedings.

But. I think that5 s one

of the problems that the courts should be sensitive to , and
that is, the possibility that conflict may occur? which are
hidden, and which do not surface until years later.
I think there5s a likelihood that that will happen
where in fact you have a separate trial of a defendant
who is represented by a. lawyer, who has yet two other clients
yet to try, and as to whom he guaids and holds back evidence»

Very well.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN H. GOLDBLATT, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MRo GOLDBLATT;

One, I would point out that the

reference to who was presented as witnesses at the Carchidi
trial was not taken from the Carchidi record, which is not
before the court.

It was taken from the record that is

before the Court at pages 183 to 184A of the Appendix.

That’s

52
Judge DiBona's testimony, who was present at both trials.
Secondly^ 1 would
One, the inquiry requirement.

like to touch on two things;
1 would point out that for

purposes of the Federal rules, that Rule 44(0}, which will
set up a Federal inquiry requirement, is now pending with
Congress, having been promulgated in 1979 as a matter of
supervisory power.
And I would submit to the Court that there is
no basis for concluding in. 1967, where there is nothing on
the record to indicate that the judge should have sensed the
conflict problem, especially given separate trials, that there
is nothing to find in the constitution to require that the
judge should have done it then, or even now.
We have as an addendum to our brief listed the
various Circuits and their approaches to this problem., and
we would suggest that there is no constitutional predicate
at this time for the inquiry.
1 would also like to stress that three members
of this Court—
QUESTION;

But do you think the Third Circuit

thought it was propounding a constitutional standard?
didn't it?
MR0 GOLDBLATT:

For evaluating the conflict

question.
QUESTION;

Mere possibility.

It did,

MRo GOLDBLATT:

A possibility of conflict,

however remote, is their—
QUESTION:

When did it first adopt that rule?

MR o GOLDBLATT :

Nineteen---Hart v. Davenport,was

the first case, and I believe it was 1972*

And they

subsequently held that they didn't need an inqui ry—they
weren't going to—they didn't need an inquiry requirement
after that ruling.

They were right.

The inquiry is almost

irrelevant except to set up a waiver in the Third Circuit
under that ^standard.
QUESTION;

Well, when was the second appeal in the

Pennsylvania court?
MRo GOLDBLATT;
QUESTION;

1977 it was decided,

The Hart case involved—at least

according to Judge Garth as I understood his dissenting
opinion-—the Hart case involved joint representation.
MRo GOLDBLATT:

Joint representation.

And one

of the things Judge Garth said was, there is no reason to
that standard willingly in separate trial cases.
QUESTION s

Right»

QUESTION:

Well, was he—-

QUESTIONs

He was in dissent.

QUESTION s

He was in dissent.

But in any event,

I take it then that the standard the Pennsylvania Supreme
Court used in the second appeal was different than was

54
currently being applied by the Third Circuit?
HR. GQLDBLATT;

That is correct.

The Pennsylvania

Supreme Court has never adopted the standard—
QUESTIONS

And was that—and about the same

Federal constitutional issue.

So there was a conflict

between the two.
MR. GOLDBLATTs
QUESTION;

That’s right.

And was the Third Circuit standard

urged upon the Pennsylvania Supreme Court?
MR. GOLDBLATTs
no it was not.

No, it was not.

By the defense,

There was no suggestion of the Third Circuit

standard at that time, to the best of my knowledge.
QUESTION;

So they used the actual conflict

standard?
MR. GOLDBLATTs

What they did was—it's very

tricky language—I'm not—
QUESTION:

But they did decide there was no

conflict?
MRo GOLDBLATTs

Yes, that is correct.

What they

said was, there was no dual representation in the true sense
of the term, is their exact language;; and that under those
circumstances, they found that no conflict existed on the
record before them.
Those are, almost verbatim, their words.

And

I don’t . want to, you know, paraphrase them, because it’s

55
very critical.
The Third Circuit found that there was dual
representation, and went from there applying their own
standards„
But I think you can argue from the Pennsylvania
Supreme Court’s decision that they looked at the record based
on Judge DiBona's testimonys no actual conflict.

And that's

the standard they implied,
QUESTIONS

Wellr they might have found something

else; but they certainly found that,
MR , GOLDBLATT:

That is correct.

The one final thing I’d like to mention, three
members of this Court in Holloway, in an opinion written by
Mr, Justice Powell, suggested that in a case where there
is a request for separate counsel that is denied by the
court without inquiry, then in that circumstance, it should
not be as the majority of course found fatal to the ease, but
they should foe—the prosecution should be allowed tohave a
hearing, at which the ultimate issue would still be whether
or not the conflict prevented the defendant from presenting
some

potentially successful defense,
QUESTION;

Well, in Holloway, the defense

counsel protested to the court,
MR, GOLDBLATT;

That’s what l;ra saying.

Here,

where there is no protest, under the standard suggested

56

by the dissent, we still win.
We're asking for no more than that.

We're asking

for nothing more than they come into court•and prove that
they were harmed by something.

They have not done it, and

we would respectfully request that they not be entitled to
relief.
Thank you.
MRo CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, counsel.

The Case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 3:15 o'clock, p.xn., the case in
the above-entitled matter was submitted.)
