ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELLEN G. ROBINSON, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

M3.s'RQBIMS0f s

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

pleas© thci Court:

Thx 3 is a residential ticketing ease, an appeal
to fcisis Court frera fcha Seventh, Circuit. And this case,
like tha Fourth Amendment case announced ioday by Mr.
Justice -Stevens, raises important questions concerr.iif.-jg
th© sature a ad the scops of residential privacy*-^.
a

I am here to argue cs '.behalf of th® Illinois;
residential picketing statute which prohibits all
picketing of homes which are used only as places of
residence.. hat it allows labor displit» picketing of
liCosas and homes which also fsvactior. as a place or the
Xec&ticxa m: ampXcy^ent relationship.

Yes, X would say that it dees,

Your Honor.
QUESTION s

MS. ROBINSON:

Yes.

In fact, I would say that

the labor dispute exception is 'focused to deal with that
kind of employment relationship.
QUESTION:

But in order to have the picketing,

then there would have to b® a dispute between' the house
field and the housewife, is that so?
MS. ROBZNSCS?:
QUESTIONS

Yes.

So just the existence of ssaployaent

on the promises is not enough?
MS. ROBINSON:
QUESTION:

Yes.

I suppose conceivably' there raig.it be

a rovefient among hows© maids to organi.se and.that picket*
lag would take place at sites where house net ids wsr©

employed?
MS. ROBINSON:

That5 3 Correct? Your Honor.

The

Your Honor,

The statist® has never beian construed by assy

state court and the state courts apparently have never had
an opportunity to construe the statute. . On its face and
read in terms of oormcm understanding, I '«raid answer yrs,
QUESTIONS

And there are ia Chicago I take it

sons very large buildings that include ev&vi supenaartr
and varicus kinds of stores, as wall as apartments?
US. ROBIMSOKs
QUISSTXGMc

Of course*

So th©r® you could h&v© customary

kinds of labor disputes by otiar thru houaa maids?

MS, ROBINSOH:

Yes, absolutely.

But ©f course

tfc© statute «soepts from tha overall baa on picketing
residences which ar ■■ used as placas of business, sad that
ic a separate ^::ce:tiun than the .Labor dispute exception.
So . i*y ecKraor-. p3xce ef business eras hava say kind of
picketing»
.QUESTION

So, I was ^sfiscflag to a building}

that cosiitf l-nied a large number of dwellings, such as an
apartment building • and also contained- places of busin&Bsj.
This ordin&ttisci would -ipply to that ;-stiiractur® and would
permit labor dispute picketing but would ten ail qth-asr

picketing?
MS. ROBlKSOSJi

No, I don't think so, if I under­

stand ye:s;c qSeetion correctly.

The statute on its f;aca

permits all picketing of build tug??., of residences which-

6

ar© tised as places of business-.

So if you hay© a big

building that has a supermarket oa the ground floor, 2
think under th© terms of the statute^ given their cosmon
meaning» that you could picket, it without reliance on the
labor dispute exception,.
Questions

Well, it would depend upon whether

the resMsacs is thought to b«> the whole apartment build­
ing sc on® of the apartments in it.
MS. SOBIKSONs

:-L‘. 2 say, the question isi- th’ia appeal in a vac;/
narrow one 'and. that is whether, •h&dann&.of the la$qr; ’di'sp'j.tc- "'o-', -oior. to olie overall pretiliitioo oa residential
pioketiitij«' fit© tut© violate 3 the o:qual protection clans®.
Th@ fact© in the case are ohoontrover t<^fi •

Tha

plaintiff l« are all meabaars of the civil rights organi^atioa,
and on® evening :: m 1977, about feacfcy members of 'this
organisation went to the sihgrle-fam'ily hose of true then
Mayor of Chicago to picket his hoa's® to protest his
position OB school busing.
Most of tfc® p®epl© who war© piclseting w®r©

7
arrested and charted with violating the residential picket­
ing statute.

They pleaded guilty and they were sentenced

to periods of supervision.

When the periods of supervision

were concluded, they filed suit in Federal District Court
in Chicago seeking a declaratory judgment and injunction,
claiming that, the statute violated both their First
amendment rights anil their equal protection rights*

QjsSTlOM:

Did they seek to set aside their

guilty pl®a?

ns.

ROBXiSSQK

-No, they did not in any way at-

tempi to collator^ily attack their farmer state court
conviction.
The District Court ruled on cross motions for
summary, .judgment, with theonly eyisSeaoa in the record
being the affidavit of tha plaintiffs regarding their
'intentions to picket in the futura..; " They alleg&d tls.t.

they want©! io the future to picket tha Mayor of Chicago
agrir as wall as various other residences in Chicago

neighborhood^.

' '

The District. Court upheld'' the statute 021 both
First tesndiaant grounds and os- equal protection grounds.
The plaintiffs appealed am tfc© Saveaith Circuit rovers®!
without reushiag tha First Ameitdirsnf; issues raised.
court struck the statute oa equal protection grounds.

The Seventh Circuit as impressed toy the similarities

That

'

8
between the residential picketing statute and tIm school
picketing statute that this Court h?$M unconstitutional
in Mosely.
They noted that 'each statute contained a general
prohibition of picketing in a certain place? with a labor
dispute exception.

And because of these similarities,

the Seventh Circuit wrote that it could find no principal
basis of distinction between th© two statutes.
'■fl® appealed because w® think that there is an
important difference between a statute which protects qalst
cksaroonts and one which prc®*>fc<as residential privacy*
And ve viii:.ik that chis aspect of the appeal is going to
turn on the critical and • important differences between

Because- thc.:aa two factors are present, the dilu­

There's a clear reason far

allowing a labor dispat® exception in the residential

w® think that the reason that the 7th Circuit
couldn't find a basis of © distinction then between this

cuit focused on the conduct ox the picketing that was belag prohibited instead of looking at the interests ttet

May I interrupt to ask you a cv.cs© tioa

about thus comparison batssea fcisis G&en and Mostly?

If I

understand your argument., you8:?® saying in stosely yea hnd
schools, and the difference between

—

just mx the kind cf

picketing# whereas her® you've got pure hesissa aad homes

11
that, are partly homes and partly placas of employment, and
it’s fair to distinguish between thos® two.

But isn’t

there still another problem, and that is that within the
category of homes which are also'places of employment, you
\.

have some picketing that's prohibited and yet labor picket"
ing is permitted, so is there not the same problem that you
had in Mos-sly, if you just focus on -the, on these hemi&
that ar© also places of employment, that the picketing as
to those draws a distinctiori based on content?
MS* BG3Z&S0&S

Well, the conduct — as to the as­

pect of the conduct which is being prohibited, yes, there
is; & direct correlation between oar .-statute and the Mosely
ordinance

Our point is that berceuse the interests which are
being protected ar© re different', and so differently ef­
fected by tte© two kinds of picketing that @ h«vs being
prohibited, that this statute is distinguishable frees

th© conduct you suggested and many, many other ideas that
the appellees raised in their briefs.
statute which protects conduct

W« have hers a

I ra-a&n which regulates

conduct and not merely pure speech.

We have a statute that

is clearly susceptible to a narrow stats construction, and
we have her© plaintiffs who when they had the opportunity
to srotek a narrowing construction from the state court,
voluntarily foreword: that opportunity in order to plead
guilty to escape what might have been a more harsh sentence.
So I would urge that the question only ha, th©
first Amendment question only b© as applied to the plain"
tiffs, to the conduct that the- plaintiffs actually sro
gaged in, and it’s in th© record.
As to th© traditional First Amendment question,
which I was asked about, the issue of course would ha
whether irrespective of the distinction between lake ead
non -5"r':r aicxxtinj * Illinois can prohibit picketing at a
he:^a, and we know, of course, that the state can regulate
picket lag on sidewalks where that conduct is inconsistent
with the youth of th© surrounding areas, and that the case
would rose, Iva into a very traditional balancing between
the rights of the pieketers and the rights of the hemoOMDfts.

i id w© thin1: that th© key in this css® to that

balancing would be the district court’s finding that the
pick&ters her® fcava alternative places where they could

That's correct, Your Bomar, but

tbrosghdut -this litigation all the courts and all the

pute picketing,
QUESTIONS

In other words, in answer then to my

brother Powell's question, this answer would b©,? I suppose,
that so long as the picketing concerned not labor relations,
or labor 'disputo, but rather quite a differ eat subject, that
nobody could ba allowed to do it?

MS. S0B1NSQN:

That’s correct*

And of course our

position, again, is that that kind of content regulation is
perfectly permissible under Kosaly,- because of the nature

of the ate-te interest, this individual privacy right, which
was diluted, as well as which is being protected, as well
as the employees * rights to picket at th® place of the @a~
ployxaant relationship if he gets into a dispute.
It’s really just a perfect example, like in the
Tree Fruits kind of situation• in pure labor picketing
cases, of th® state trying to protect two in-fear «sta at the
same tine? a resident's right fee b® let alone and th© em­
ployee's right to picket at his place of employment whs» he
gets into a dispute.

Tm& our assertion is that this is a

perfectly reasonable balance that the Illinois legislature
has struck.

MR. ARNOLDSs

Thank you, Mr, Chief Justice, and

may it please the Courts
Your Honors? what is- wrong fundamentally with the
Illinois residential picketing statute is simply that it
is not narrowly drawn.

Because it is not narrowly draws,

it is under-inclusive» and it is over-iaclusiv-s, and it is
vagua, and it violates the righ.tr of free speech and equal
pro

ioi. ir. due process of law.
Your Honors, the issue- in this case is not

twhether Illinois car-, constitutionally and by a aarrowlydrawa statute protect residential privacy from invasion by
noisy, tr* . •’.ping, threatening picketero»
QUESTION s

Would you car® to suggest, if you

could do it very briefly, without using too much of your
time, what kind of a narrowing would wake it pass rauster?
HR. .ARNOLDS;

Your Honor, 2 think that constitu­

tionally, Illinois could put s. limit, on the. number of
picketsi 1 think they could —
QUESTION;
la that your 'point?

But could.*cfc eliminate 'them entirely?

24

MR. ARNOLDS:

Yes.

Our contention is that

Illinois could not consfcifcufcionally prohibit all picketing,
all picketing, froru streets and sidewalks —
QUESTION s

All residential picketing?

MR. ARNOLDS:

Yes, Your Honor.

We think that

there is no compelling reason for eliminating even fill
residential picketing, that the state's interest in preserv­
ing the right to quiet enjoyment of the home is not suffi­
cient to justify the oliminati.cn even of all residential
picketing, because limits could ba put, more narro ? limits

conia

—r

QUESTION:

Of course, that's always bean the

argument of people who challenge statutes on equal protec­
tion grounds, is that you can't do it this way, but you
could have done it another way.

I mean, it's not a very

novel argument to say they didn't do it quite right here?
MR. ARNOLDS:

Your Eonor, X think chore's a dif­

ferre® between diop--.ting exactly vhat the limits are, how
macy pec-pic can picket at what times, and tha'ctsprt of tiling,
and disputing-, kha state’s right to totally limit this First
As®. ..ament protected activity from the residential streets
and sidewalks in the state..
QUESTION;

You are conceding, I take it, that

Illinois could have regulated residential picketing in a

25
way, as you put it, more narrowly drawn, here.

And ray

commant to you was that this is probably the classic argu­
ment of any person assailing a statute or ordinance on the
equal protection grounds, is th&at, not that you couldn’t
do it at all., but that you just should have done it a
little differently or a little more narrowly, or allowed
a little mors latitude.
MR. ARNOLDSs

I agree that 'that is the argument,

Your Honor, though her® they have totally banned it, and
the contention is they did not have to totally ban it in
order to ruf«guard any interest they might have in protest­
ing residential privacy.

However, this ia raally our

second argument, our contention that the statute is over-’
inclusive.

I think our principal argument is that the

statute violates equal protection ir th® First Amendment
because it is not under-inclusive; that is, because it
.cr.akss an u^esption for labor picketing, and that ciistinctier, is clearly a content-based distinction.

If you pre­

MR. ARNOLDS:

Your Honor,. I don't believe so

necessarily, because I believe the object of the picket­
ing ia that ease is what has traditionally been regarded
an illegal object, an intent to obstruct justice or to
influence justice, and in that, case I think certainly a
distinction can be made»
QUESTION:

Well, is there a difference.between

influencing justice and influencing legislation, then?
MR. ARNOLDS:

Well, I think that if the intent

of the picketing is to interfere- with justice, with the
process of justice, or to influence justice in some way,
as X. think the argument really, the rationale behind Cos
v. Louisiana, if I understand, is that the picketing there
was aimed at an illegal, had really an illegal object,
ttol the preservation of really the right to a fair trial,
of justice that was uninfluenced by things that should rot
influence the decisions of courts, anti, really was a compel
ing reason for prohibiting the picketing in that circum­
sta nee,

QUESTIONs

I thought. ws war© talking about your

First Amendment argument.

Bui. perhaps I was mistaken.

You ha?s two separate arguments» two separat®

attasks on'this, do you not?
MR. ARNOLDS:

Yes, actually ws have three.

And

the third goes to the vagueness of the statute.
The first, attack is baa ad on the content discri­
mination , which y. believe may be characterised as either
a 14th Amendment attack or a First Amendment attack.
QUESTION:
area5t they?

They are both 14th Amendment attacks,

This is stats legislation.

MR. ARNOLDS:

Yes.

On-::, under the* equal protection

clause, so I balievc: this can be characterised» our first
argument may b© properly characterised as an equal protec­
tion arcti.Tait ari « first amendment argument,

because

there is n compelling reason for discriminating among the
picketsf and also the statute attempt» to control the con­

Th© second argument is the First Amendment argu3 erh ss applied to the states by the 14th Amendment due

S3R. MgtQl&Ss

your Honor 9 X don’t, think so in

terms of equal protection, in terms of the difference be­
tween labor picketing and all other picketing.

I will

agree that the right, that schools are different from
residences,, and the right ©f privacy in, residential pri­
vacy is certainly different from the right of quiet class­
rooms# from the interest in maintaining quiet classrooms.
But that is no justification lor allowing only labor picketirig ixi oas case and not allowing only labor picketing in
the other case.
In other v ords, the fact that the rights

it

just dofasi ’t. make any sans® to say that that justifies
discrimination in favor of labor picketing in a residen­
tial situation but de-tan* t justify it in a school situa­
tion .
QUESTIONi

But in the residential situation, as

X understand, it, the statute says only when the owner has
allowed oth^r people who are strangers to him on the pre­
mises is labor picketing -allowed.

And it*s used' as a

place of Easiness.
!■©. ASKOLDS:

The point is -chat there is. no com­

pelling reason for making that, distinction.

What the

statute says in-effect is that if you bring a non-union
carpenter in

to work on your roof, you have waived the

right to privacy insofar as labor picketing is concerned.

But if your house is a landmark and you attempt to alter it,
that does not waive. your right, of privacy insofar as the
historical society is concerned , and they cannot corae in
and picket because you are altering a landmark.
Our position is, there is no reason, and certain­
ly nc compelling reason, for making that discrimination ir
favor of labor disputes and against everyone else.
QUESTION;

Who decides whether the place is a

landmark, the pickaters cr sane public body?

You use the

phrase, ’'landmark.;i

MR. ARNOLDS:

No, Your Honor.

What I'm suggest-

lag is that, there 1b no reason for saying that tha horae™
owner waives his right to privacy if he brings a workman
into hi-s home.

1 am not saying that he waives that right

to privacy for the myriad other purposes about which people
might picket him.

For example, if he puts an opposing

political candidate*8 poster in the window of hi3 heme, tfc®
opposite party is not allowed tc carry a sign in front of
the home in favear of some -other candidate.

And yoc why,

if fee brings a workman into his home, does he waive his
right to privacy?

Bob he doesn't waive that right if he

A couple of questions Yonr Honors addressed to
Mr..

Robinson that. I v:ould lika to comment on,

Mr, Justice,-

S swart I believe asked a que tion about the Gregory case,
and I

moqM

simply like to not® that it is clear fro® th&

appendix in the Gregory ease that the marching, parading
ir that ease took glace.'in exactly the same neighborhood
ac in this cas©, that while net the same mayor was in­
volved, the Mayor of the city of Chicago — tas residence
of tha Mayor cf the city -of Chicago was if,, target of ih©
picketing1 and ia addition to that tie message was tbs
aers®,.

The? .picketing concerned desegregation of the

Chicago -pssbiie schools.
:QQ.£fii‘IQ!S;

That was a i:lffor sat p-syor but they

iiv -•' i:n tho oyr.c neighborhood ? .

-'QUESTION:

Was there a parade permit in the

Gregory can® of any kind?
ME, ARNOLDS:

jo*

I'm not sure. Your Honor, but I

1 don't belief® :a -permit was i;.avf r . .

I may b© wrong about that

37

QUESTIONi

Would it make a difference if there

was an ordinance which said yc-u can do something if you
get a parada permit but impliedly you can't do it if you
don't gat a permit?
I®. ARNOLDS;

X think that if fch® parade permit

ordinance would toe constitutional, could be constitutional
if the d-iscriiainat ion •— if it wsr.e in no way based on
content, -in ether words if the permits were awarded in a
totally coatent-free manner»

1 think if the permit

ordinance- -required that- the cent cat of the message be
reviewed before the permit were granted —>
3UES7X0K:

Permit ordinances are usually neutral

:'.v the sense o.2 simply requiring notice so that- they can
handle traffic problems and that sort of thing,
Jia. riHUCvX' ;

And 1 believe that when they ar©

tfeay are generally upheld as fcaisig constitutional.
QUESTION;

ivo par act permit had ever be© up-

he -.•;•• here. has it, tl-at went into the matter of content?
MR» ARNGX&Ss

Not that I am awara of, no, sir.

'-vtafc I wish to point cut about the Gregory case
"■r

that this Corrr in Gregory specifically said that if

fc '■pared lag and marching in that case was peaceful, it
v'-'s..? certainly protected by the First Amendment, and the
state toss cc-;ic®d<sa in this case that both the past conduct
of ti.s i'U- K‘-?-ifis-’..?ppc..liees and their post conduct is

38

peaceful.

Therefor© w© conclude that unde; Gregory, their

conduct is protected by the First Amendment.
Mr. Justice Stevens, I believe you asked a ques­
tion going to the place of business exception in the statute.
Our position is that it is not clear from the statute just
exactly what picketing is allowed iit a place of business:
For example, if the highris© Lakepoinc Towers has a restau­
rant in the building, it is clear that the restaurant may
be picketed, and not only for labor matters but for other
matters.
It is not clear whether the residences that are
also located in Lakepoint Towers may be picketed for any­
thing other: than labor disputes, and 2 think neither is it
ctiaar if a highris: a contains only c©nd.om.iniums or apart­
ments, ':-"hLbh-r or mot that building is n place of business ,

I

th® statement absolutely.

however, that an absolute statement,

absolute statement can fo® m£© that government

caBBOt control what mobile iss aes may be discussed i;i pub­

4.4

in this case.

And X think as in Mostly, the statute's ex­

ception for labor picketing really fatally impeaches any
rationale that this statute wight have for prohibiting all
other peaceful picketing, and in this case, the state has
conceded that the picketing is: peaceful.
QUESTION:

You don't deny that the state has soma

additional reason for permitting labor picketing than other
kinds of picketing?

At least there is a reason, but you’re

suggesting it just is inadequate?
MR. ARNOLDS:

Yes.

Certainly a reason can

invented, bet. 1 thitak the rest or., dess not even r.iss to the
level of a rational reason? certainly not to a compelling
reason, .mi in at© ray can it ia sufficiant to permit the
statua to control the content cf speech in the sense that
in no way should it fee allowec t.o be judged sufficient to
control what public issues ®&y be discussed in public
forums.
QUESTIONS

Well, your argmant .is that Mayor

Biiandic ’s' house is a public - forum?
HR. ARNOLDS;

Sc, Ycur ' Ikszs'qr.

*:fcsr argument is

that public streets and sidewalks lin the neighborhood, in
;

‘

‘

vhich Mayor 'Ml asdic fs house is located are publifc forums.
QUESTION:

Well, the sidewalk in front of his

house is what «#e?re talking £ lout y rot: just the'.general
residential area he lived In, isn’t it?

'4E- ARNOLDS:

Well, the statute doss not pro­

hibit picketing in the general residential area,

rt pro­

hibits picketing before and about residences.
QUESTION:

Yes.

Wot in residential areas

generally,
MR. ARNOLDS:

But the effect of the statute if

it’s upheld would be virtually to eliminate picketing in
residential^ on public streets and sidewalks before and
about, residences, which — in residential areas.
QUESTION:

So you tl ink — would ycur view of th

statute be the same i® appliesfcicn if Instead of picketing
tlKsre at th® Mayor’s place, tie pickets just picked out
arbitrarily sem® residential district- picketed for one

A message, yes.

MR. ARNOLDS:

My position *—

MR. ARNOLDS:

Our pc sit ion would h® that that

QUESTION:

In other words, it would fee in the

ss-.»\e category whether the Mayor was th® target, or just

scias taxpayer ?
MR. » ARNOLDSi

Well, this statute doss not dis­

tinguish. between public officials and truly private per­
sons,

IfcVf not narrowly draw- in that way.

I don't think

this case requires a decision, about whether or not there
is a difference.
Thank you very much.

Ms. Robinson.

OEM. ARGUMENT OF ELLEN G.. ROBINSON. ESQ. f
OH BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT — REBUTTAL
MS, ROBINSON:

Just a couple of points.

Mi the outset, I'm concerned ah rat the character
iaation that we*ve conceded the 20 -people picketing in
front of. a i'ina at six o'clock was peac.sful.

It's not in

the record wtather or r_ t that particular picket ■ was peace
f«l or not.

Vte have only: conceded that fch© plaintiffs

allege that -thtsy intended to engaje in future peaceful
picketing

5 ilia statute war© held unconstitutional.

QUESTION;

Is it net true that-tlie statute has

the same effect on .peaceful picketing a;? it does on non­
peaceful picketing?.
.MS. ROBJNSONa
QUESTION:

On its face it does, Your Honor.

I take it that it would prevent just

marching with signs in any residential neighborhood?

47
MS. ROBINSONs
QUESTION:

On its face it would, Your Honor.

Weil, I guess that's what we are talk­

ing about; isn't it?
MS. ROBINSON:
QUESTION:

Wall,

I —

You know, picketing just doesn’t mean

picking oat a target

on its face

I suppose if they

just march 3d., if a hundred par ple marci ed up and Sown a
mile, they just made a circuit of a mile in a residential
neighborhood, they didn’t hav<s any bunting, they're just
electioneering, say?
MS-. &OBIHSQN:

I don't- think that would be picket

ing within the is&aniag of this statute.

I think that would

be a march like vs had in. the Gregory ease. and I ihihk
that the Illinois courts. in light of chair other decisions
regarding picketing, wowld cor strue picksting to mean. pat
rolling back and forth in frort of a single limited geo­
graphical area.
QUESTION:

h block?

MS. ROBINSON:

How about a block?

When it. says -•» l think Um sta­

ir ?--.i hasn't bean construed on its face, and in light of
Illinois' other deci.aloae regarding picketing, I think -and the purpose of the statute*

I think that the courts

vsrcld construo it. to mean in front of a residence, just the
way the pickeiars in. this case ware picketing right in

front ©i'

Mayor3 £> Bouse*

QUESTION:

Wall, say fcha aoQXvby political chair­

man and you *re just wanting hi® to support one of your
candidates, so you get a sign and you ir-arch up and down in
front of his house saying support so-and-so for sheriff.
That's certainly covered.
MS. ROBINSON:
QUESTION:

Cerfcc-.inly within that act, yes.

You wmslc concede that in the context

of labor disputes, the labor area generally,, thsro arc spe­
cial and different reasons to extend protection; to labor
picketing .as distinguished frcm all other types?
?iS. aCBXBSGHs

Exactly, Mr. Chief' Justice.

And

as a matter of fact, Illinois has a special statute which
pro:-e^te later v-.ic‘vSf. leg in tls situs of an employment
r©lafcionahip.
QUESTION?

Well, so analogies between labor

picketing md ofcfcar types are*t terribly helpful, are
they?
MS. ROBINSONs

I doe *t think so, Your Honor,

net in this case.
QUESTION:

If the county chairman not only was

in his louse but fee had his district captains, they were
having a masting at Ms house, and so the throe or four
pickets with tha signs say, "Support ao-aad-so for sheriff.B

That would be covered?
MS. ROBINSONs

Yea, it WOaM

—

43
QUESTION;

Even though ha carta inly I-,as invited

a lot of psopl® into his feouso and ha might, perhaps —
shouldn't expect the same kins! of privacy as he —
MS* ROBINSON:

Of course, that's the contention

of the appellees in the case, if we waive the right of
residential privacy when v- =t invite an employee, then we
should waive it. as to everybody else who comes in.
QUESTION;

And what(s your answer to that?

4S. ROBINSON s

And our answer to that is that

it*s only the employees and the rights of employees to
picket, that Illinois has given special legislative pro­
tection to, in a separate, distinct statute, the .labor
anti "injunction of labor .dispute picketing statuta which
I set forth in my brief.
And because of this special protection that
Illinois; has always given to ■ aployees to picket at fcl.air
place of r*aploy2?.f$rnk i:e. oasc a labor dispute arises, it was
re.?tenable for-the Illinois Legislature, wtmn they war© Se
elding to. 'protect residential privacy., to also simultan­
eously protect tsspleye© picketing.
QUESTION;

So that you draw a line between offi­

cials who haves help in house «sad those who don’t?
MS. ROB Iff SGtYes, sir, and .any other working
person who has a help in the house.
QUESTION:

It may b© that organised labor was

so
pretty influential in Springfield, too, when the statute
was passed.
MS. ROBINSON:

It au.y have bean, Your Honor.

If there ara no further questions, my time is
up.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Counsel.

The case is submitted.
