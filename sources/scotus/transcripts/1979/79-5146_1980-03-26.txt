MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear argument

next in Ho, 79-51^6, Rawlings v. Kentucky.
Mr. Apriles you .say proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT 01? J. VINCENT APRILE II, ESQ. ,
OK BEHALF OP THE PETITIONER
MR. APRILS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The ease before you today presents four issuese
The primary issue is the first issue, and It deals with
whether the petitioner, David Rawlings, has standing,
that Is, is he entitled to raise a violation of the
Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments generated by the illegal
search of the puree of Vanessa Cox and the seizure from
that purae of property, including contraband drugs-, on
the basis that the property, on®, belonged to Mr.
Rawlings, and, two, on the basis that he was charged
/

-f

with an offense that was the; possession of those very
contraband drugs?,

;.. j

The second Issue In this case deals with the
question of whether the searches and seizures, all of
them, not only of Vanessa Coac*s purse but also of Mr.
>

4

Rawlings, and the other incriminating evidens® were the
fruits of an unconstitutional detention and arrest of
both petitioner and. Vanessa, Cos in violation of the

4
Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the federal Constitu­
tion.
The third issue and the fourth issue in the
case are derivative Issues that depend upon this Court
finding the first issue In favor of the petitioner.

But

X would point out; to the Court that the third issue8
that the search;of Vanessa Cosis purse «as unconstitu­
tional, has been conceded in this Court by the respondent*
So the question Is whether or not we are entitled to assert
the Illegalities in that situation.
I would immediately turn to that first issue and
tell you that we are proceeding on three - different theories.
We are proceeding first on the theory of automatic stand­
ing, because under any restrictive construction that you
give to the doctrine of automatic standing, David Rawlings
clearly qualifies *

The theory of the prosecution*© case,

the indictment„ everything points t© the fact that David
Rawlings is charged with possession of these contraband
drugs while they are in the purse of Vanessa Coxy and
when they were searched, October 18, 1976 is the date of
the crime and the date of the purse.
So there is no question as to whether or not
we were entitled to automatic standing.

The question

is —
QUESTION:

Does it make any difference how they

5
got Into the young lady8s puree?
MR* APRILS:

Your Honos?, under the first

analysis that we propose for automatic standing, we would
suggest no, it does not matter how they got there, except
in a situation — no, I would say under automatic stand­
ing it would not matter.
QUESTION;

Well, what if it turned out- that

the search of the purse was perfectly legal?
MR, APRILE:

I*a sorry, the question that was

addressed to me, Your Honor, was how they got into the
purse, not how it was taken out.
QUESTION:

I see,

QUESTION:

Was it Important how they

QUESTION:

I thought his question meant whether

getting into the purse was legal or- not.
MR. APRILS:
QUESTION:

Well —
Of course, it makes a. difference

whether it ms legal, getting into the purse was legal or
not.
MR. APRILE: With regard to automatic standing?
QUESTION;

Yes.

MR. APRILS; I would suggest with regard to auto­
matic standing that would not deal with —

On the question of the- merits of its

QUESTIO!?:
MR, APRILE:

You would lose,
Yess Your Honor, I agree with you,

That would be determinative of the merits of the issue,
QUESTIOMs
MR. APRILE;

All right,.
Addressing the question of auto­

matic standing in this situation, I would like to refer
to three major concepts that are involved her®, and X
think — excuse m®, there -would be two, and the first one
would be subdivided into three concepts.
The first, question is the dilemma of seifincrimination, and we have argued in our brief .and we
take the position that Simmons has not eradicated com­
plet ely for the defendant the dilemma of s eliminer Imtin&t low
that occurs when he s.ust take the stand in a suppression
hearing and testify to either ownership or possession of,
the premises searched where the possessory offense crime
was committed, that is where the possession of the contra­
band material, occurred, or where he must take the stand
and admit either ownership or possession of the contra­
band goods themselves' which are the 'very gravamen of the
offense with which he is charged.
We say that- this exists for three reasons.
first one is the danger of impeachment,

And as this

The

7
Court well knows». It does not require a situation where a
defendant takes the stand in a suppression hearing and
says one thing arid then takes the. stand at trial and says
another thing that is an outright lie*

All in most

jurisdictions

required tor impeachment is an incon­

sistent statement*

So if this defendant wants to assert»

for example9 possessory ownership* possessory interest or
ownership interest in the contraband* he may come in and
say> in this particular situation I owned the suitcase
in which this was found, and in that situation who'» he
asserts that in a possessory offense * he may then want;
to take the stand and say but I didn’t have the .slightest
idea how the drugs get in there*.

Once he would say. X

don’t have the slightest idea how the drugs got in there,
then the prosecutor could i&y we want to introduce the
inconsistency that that was his suitcase, and in that
situation a marginal —
QUESTXOM:
MR* APRILS:

That wouldn’t be an inconsistency.
Well, Your Honor, I can only say

to you that I have seen numerous oases on appeal in which
that type of ruling has been made by the trial court' and
affirmed on appeal, that that' is enough of an inconsistency
to allow the question of credibility to be raised.
real issue —
QUESTION;

There are bound to be —

The

HR. APRILE:

The real issue, four Honor, ia will

it dater a defendant and his defense attorney from going
ahead and challenging the propriety of
ment violation.

a Fourth Amend­

That was the rationale behind Jones.

You reaffirmed that in MeGautha v. California when you
said the reason why we say this is a dilemma of self-»
incrimination her® is because the danger is it will deter
people from bringing marginal Fourth Amendment claims.
That is an incredibly good reason for ®QUBSTXOM;

How much do you think is left of

MeGautha after our subsequent ~~
MR. APRILS:

I don't think that MeGautha —

I don't think the question in MeGautha was reached,
perhaps in dicta, but it was ® discussion which Is-re­
lied upon by the petitioner in the previous case 'to show
what you meant by Simmons, and that is all I am using
it for.

1 am not trying to say that the underpinnings

of MoGantha with regard to death penalty is still good
law.

I am Just talking about your discussion of the

tons ion arid the reasons in Simmons behind the prophylactic
rule that you enunciated.
QUESTION:

It seems to me that all your reason­

ing is that the defendant should fee encouraged to do
everything he can to prevent the prosecution from estab­
lishing the truth or falsity of the charges it brings

9
against

him if there is some constitutional implication,

in the thing., and that no weight should be attached what­
ever to the usefulness of the trial as a process for
finding out whether or not the charges are true.
MR. APRILS: I think there are two important
considerations„ when I respond to that» Your Honor.

I

think the first one very basically is I cannot accept
Chief Justice BurgerTs position that every motion to sup­
press is a motion to exclude the truth,

That simply has

'•hot been the result of practical experience.

Sometimes

it; excludes the truth, sometimes it excludes falsity done
y

by the polioa such7 as motion to exclude or suppress on
the basis of an involuntary confession*

You have even

said in cases such as Hincey v. Arizona that the very
‘

}

question of the validity of the truthfulness of that
confession is at issue and you would not allow impeach.

i

feent under simila?.9 circumstances to Harris v. Kew fork*

:

'

'

'i

So we can’t just start off with a presumption
that every motion to suppress is an attempt to destroy
' '

the truth-finding process.

i

In asm© instances, it may wry

well be» but I think the second ana most important

.

response that we have'here goes to the concept of what
was talked about earlier» and that is this vice o'f
prosecutorial self-contradiction.

And I would Just

simply jump ahead to that to say that what is the

10

government attempting to say»
QUESTI0M:

Before you leave your first point s

which as I understand it is that your example is that if
something is found in a suitcase and he is charged with
possession of that item, he can’t later on get on the
stand and testify sort of tangentially about it*
MR, APRILE;
QUESTION:

Yes., sir.
Wouldn't that argument apply equally

if he were charged with murder and. there were a gun in
the suitcase?
MRo APRILE:
QUESTION:

Exactly8 Your Honor.
That Is really not particularly re­

lated to the automatic standing.
MR» APRILE;

Ho,. Your Honor.

I agree with your

analysis and I certainly don't mean to deassn it in any
way»

I agree with it.

My response, however, Is that

Jonhs was not predicated on the fact that these problems
would not occur In other kinds of situation®»

It was

predicated on the knowledge that where the crime is a
possessory offense9 the danger is the greatest.

And we

all know as a practical reality that I'm not up here
just saying something for the purposes of appellate
argument.

In each of the examples that I would give,

that is. Impeachment, substantive use of prior incon­
sistent statements, in prosecutorial fishing expedition»

11
the danger :1s always the- greatest when the defendant la
testifying at the suppression hearing about something
that directly relates to his involvement with th© posses­
sion itself, the very nature of the charge.
The example you give Is very true.

What about

a murder situation when the defendant comes in and he
testifies, yes, the shirt that you found Is min©.

Okay„

knd consequently this evidentiary item gives me standing
to contest the search, say, of the third person, the
premises where the shirt was left.
What elso will be generated by the fact that he
has acknowledged that this innocuous piece of evidentiary
material is his?

It is not going to open up all kinds of

opportunities for prosecutorial fishing expedition, and
it is probably not going to generate mush in the way of
impeachment or the substantive us© of prior inconsistent
statements in a jurisdiction like Kentucky.
So I suggest the danger is the greatest in
possessory offenses, and that is what was recognised by
Justice Frankfurter in the majority opinion In Jones v„
United States, and that- is very significant,
QUESTION:

The trial judge always has the right

and duty, doesn’t he, to exclude evidence that isn’t
probative or isn’t relevant to the issues?
MR. JiFKiiEr.

I think that is an interesting

12
question you ask me, Your Honor, because I would point to
two things.

It is interesting with regard to the prosecu­

torial fishing expedition.

Counsel for the respondent in

this case took the position that that scertainly is just a
legitimate function of the adversarial nature of the
prosecution's function.

They said that it is good for a

prosecutor in. a suppression hearing to take the tactic of
trying to find out everything you can when the defendant
testifies.
QUESTION:

I am talking about a trial, which is

where a — assuming the suppression motion doesn51 end
up with a finding of guilt or the imposition of a sen­
tence o

I ami saying , at a trial the judge has a right

arid duty to exclude non-probative, non-relevant evidence.
Mils,.APRILE:

Norn-probative and non-relevant,

but the point is In prosecutorial fishing expedition example that we just mentioned, what would happen Is. that
the suppression hearing would generate ail kinds o.f

QUESTION:
MR. APRILE:

It might lead to the truth.
But the point is the defendant

was'only taking the stand for the purposes of establishing
standing.

He takes the stand for that purpose.

The

prosecutor and the judge allows him, as occurred in the

13
case at bar, to go way far afield asking whom did you try
to sell these drugs to5 in a case of trying to prove
trafficking.
QUESTION:

Well, if he is not guilty he has got

nothing to hide, presumably.

But what you are doing is you are

plating an incredible burden on his right to assert stand­
ing.

That is exactly what you are

That is exactly what Simmons was supposed to stop.

MR. APRILE:

I would

tar, there was nothing more than a prosecutorial fishing

QUESTION:

Wall, you made the suppression

motion.
MR. APRILE;

Your Honor, I did not make the

suppression motion.
QUESTION:

Well, the; government certainly

doesn't make suppression motions.

MR„ APRILE:

But the point is, even under Simmons

he was allowed to go into that suppression hearing to be
protected when he made his statements to allege standing,
that they would not be in turn used against him.

Here in

a prosecutorial fishing expedition situation, it becomes
derivative evidence which the defendant would be hardpressed to ever prove came directly from the testimony
that he gave during the course of the suppression hearing.
QUESTION:

I am baffled at your constant repe­

tition of prosecutorial fishing expedition that arises
out of a motion made by the defendant, not by the prose­
cution»
MR. APRILE:

Mo, Your Honor, it does not arise

out of the motion to suppress, it arises out of not allow­
ing automatic standing and forcing the defendant to take
the stand, not to establish the merits of the Fourth
Amendment claim but to establish whether or not he has
the right to even raise the merits, and that is what the
automatic standing rule was generated to prevent, and that
is what Simmons does not answer and that is why I suggest
to you that the dilemma of self-incrimination continuas
to persist despite Simmons for the defendant and the
defense attorney who is counseling him, and those are
the three reasons»
QUESTION:

Do you mean it persists because if

15
he takes the stand he might be In difficulty, is that your
point?
MR. APRILE:

Your Honor, as in this ease, the

prosecution In this case wanted to establish not only
possession but possession for the purposes of sale,
trafficking.

They’ve got this man on the stand who is

now testifying that those were his drugs, so he can show
an actual —
QUESTION:
testifying?

Mere is he testifying?

Where is he

At pretrial or trial?

MR. APRILE:

He is testifying at a suppression

hearing pretrial, that's right.
QUESTION:
MR. APRILE:

And that can't be used against him?
Well, that is the point.

Maybe

that can't be introduced against him, but all of a sudden,
now that he is on the stand, the prosecutor has a wide
open vista to ask him did you ever try to sell these drugs
to. anybody.
standing.

That is not relevant to the question of
What that is relevant to is establishing why

did you possess the drugs.

He possessed them for purposes

of sale.
QUESTION:

Well, if he doesn't like that he

doesn't have to make a motion to suppress.
MR. APRILE:

That's true, Your Honor, but at the

same time the motion to suppress concept is to stop the

•

16

government from violating constitutional rights.

And as

McGautha indicated, as Si-irsmons indicated ,s we are going to
give this kind of protection because we don't want de­
fendants to be deterred from raising marginal Fourth
Amendment claims because we don't want the police to en­
gage in unconstitutional activities, and that is what a
motion to suppress is all about.

It is not Just vindicat­

ing rights of the defendants, it is vindicating the rights
of society against incorrect po3.ice procedures that
violate the Constitution of the United States.
QUESTION:

Do you mean that is the chief moti­

vation of the defendent?
MR. APRILE:
to say that.

I don't know, sir, I don't propose

It certainly wouldn't be my chief motiva­

tion as a defense attorney, but I realize that it is a
legitimate motivation and it is one of my motivations as
a defense attorney.
QUESTION:

What the courts have said is the

court's reason for doing it, which are wholly independent
and separate from the defendant's purposes•—
MR. APRILE

I acknowledge that, Your Honor.

In some situations, as this Court has indicated, you feel
that; it is unfortunate and unfair that a guilty person
goes free because the constable blundered.
thato

I understand

But the point is what we are talking about is what

1?
was the motivating policy reason behind automatic stand­
ing* and this is exactly what it was,to allow people to
raise marginal Fourth Amendment claims without being
afraid that the testimony they provide in the suppression
hearing to establish standing would come back to haunt
them as a form of self-incrimination, and that is my
response.
QUESTION:

It seems to me that part of your

argument really is that the cross-examination by the
prosecutor going into the motives was really improper
examination and I wonder if your argument has the same
force if one presumes the trial judge wouldn’t allow that
kind of cross-examination.
MR. APRILE;

That is what I was trying to get

to a. moment ago. Your Honor, and I guess 1 lost track of
it.

I apologiseo

But this respondent argues that it is

perfectly permissible»

The Solicitor General in the

previous case argues that no self-respecting trial judge*
no 'self-respecting prosecutor would ever do these things
and that they would stop it if it occurred, and I just
submit to you that there certainly is not unanimity on
the side of the prosecutors in their approach to this,
nor in the trial judge.
example»

In this case, it is a perfect

I don’t want to be side-tracked so long on

this issue, but I would say this ease is a perfect

18
example.

Every one of these questions were objected to.

In every instance, the judge said overruled, this is not
a trial in front of the jury, give the information to the
prosecutore
QUESTION:

Now, stopping right on that question,

if they asked him a question that was outside the scope
of the suppression hearing —
MR. APRILE:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
— and the judge forced him to answer,

haven*t you got a compelled incrimination claim as to
that particular answer?
ME. APRILE: I would like to think that you do,
Your Honor, and I would like to think that Simmons would
stand for that.
QUESTION:
MR. APRILE:

Why wouldn't you have?
Well, the problem that I see is

the very difficulty begins to demonstrate when they turn
up a witness as a result, of this and they say, well,: we
had this witness before, we say well, you got this wit­
ness as a result — it becomes a very difficult problem.
That is the only reality, and automatic standing would
prevent that real proof problem.
If X could for a moment just briefly skip
ahead to the concept of prosecutorial self-incrimination,
and I want to point out in the Salvuccl brief that the

19
petitioner, the Solicitor General!s office in Salvuccl,
they say that self-incrimination — I5®, sorry, the vice
of prosecutorial self-contradiction doesn4t really exist
because of instances like constructive possession and
aiding and abetting ©re examples where we get a terrible

result»
And I would point out, first of all, as I said
in my reply brief in this case, that aiding and abetting

••ii

;

i

:

is- .not under your past construction of where automatic
standing would apply, aiding and abetting somebody el.se

.who commits a possessory offense would not entitle some>0: ■
one to automatic standing.

Another example

-U ; •

they give construction posses• !

sion, the very definition of constructive possession is

> i:; I
;H

;

such a nexus between the thing; seised and the defendant,
bush dominion and control that the defendant would, almost
}

have actual standing.

So I would say in that situation

there is really no"harm generated by applying automatic
standing, and the exemples given by the Solicitor General
certainly do not show a bad result generated by the use
of. automatic standing in those two examples.
1 would next, if it is permissible with the
Court, move to the other two theories that we advance in
this case which are different from the preceding case.
The second one is this particular —

20

QUESTION:

You had four theories in your brief0

MR* APRILE:
I did.

Pour theories. Your Honor, perhaps

What I am referring to is the first theory was

automatic standing.

The second one is the ownership or

possessory interest in the thing seised, that is, generates
automatic standing.

And I would like to say to the Court,

I hope I have not in my brief seemed to say that I don't
agree with your position in Rakas.

It is not that.

I

tried to say the reason I was using the terms "automatic
standing” and "actual standing" is, even though you did
away with those in Rakas, the appellate court's of this
country as well as the trial courts are still fumbling
around, as I am, with the concept of what is left oyer.
I know in Rakas you said the inquiry would be
the same under your new test, reasonable expectation of
privacy9 as it was under the old concepts of actual
standing, so I tried to integrate the two vocabularies
and I hop® I haven't indicated that I don't folio?/ the
reasoning of Rakas.
In this particular regard, I would say what do
we have in this situation?

This defendant, when he was

denied automatic standing took the stand and admitted
ownership of the drugs.
drugs.

He outright said these are my

We say that,as Jones pointed out when it went

back historically and said what is a basis for

21
establishing standing, actual standing has always been a
possessory or ownership interest- in the premises searched
or the items seised*

In this ease, the defendant’s in­

terest in the property that he put in her purse gave him
the right to complain about that violation, and this is
also, of course —
QUESTION:

Well, if they had had a warrant to

search her purses the fact that

say they had a warrant

to search her purse for stolen cheeks.
MR* APRILE:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir*
And they searched her purse and

found some drugs that happened to belong to your client.
How, your client couldn't object to the procedure.
MR. APRILE:

Ho, sir. no more than he could

object had she consented.
QUESTIOK:

Then his interest in the property

seized isn't enough.
MR, APRILE:

I disagree. Your Honor.

I would

say this, that he shares —
QUESTIOH:

Hot if they were legally in the

purse, it isn't enough.
MR. APRILE:

That’s right, because his privacy

right and hie interest in the property seized when he
turns it over to somebody else is minimized by her ability
to control the use of it.

But that does not do away with

22
either his total expectation of privacy nor the fact that
an interest is generated by the property seised.
In this particular case -- as 1 said, in the
case of a consent —
QUESTION:

You are saying that his property was

seised as a result of an illegal search of a purse in
which he had a joint interest or in which he had & privacy
interest.
MR, APRILE:

He had a privacy interest generated

by the fact that he was storing something within it with
her. permission.
QUESTION:

Did she consent to his placing this

in the purse?
MIL APRILS:

Yess sir.

There were only two

people —
QUESTION:
MR» APRILE:

Isn't there some dispute about that?
Yes, sir, but may I point this

out, Mr. Justice Blackman, that in the suppression hear­
ing Vanessa Cox did not testify.

The first suppression

hearing was only Officer Hailey, and then when we were
denied automatic standing then the petitioner testified
and his testimony is quite clear.

He said I asked her if

1 could put these items in her purse and she said yes.
There is one place during the course of this
trial, under redirect examination by the prosecutor, a

23
leading question, he says did you object when he put the
property in there..

I think it .is page 59 of the transcript.

And at that point she says yes, but if you look at her
other testimony» which I have detailed in the reply briefe
she actually says at the time he said may I put these
items In your purs®, she said nothing i^ith regard to thata
she doesn't go into anything like that, she said he put
the items in my purse, it was later when I glanced in the
purse that I then objected.
QUESTION:

Well, a finder of fact has a right

to disbelieve the testimony of anyone.
MRo APRILE:

He didn’t.

That's exactly right,

Your Honor3 but no court that has looked at this case has
:

done it on the basis that Vanessa Cox did not give him
permission to put the things in the purse9 so there has
been no question like that.
QUESTION:

Well, have they said that she did

give him permission?
MR. APRILE:

Yes, it has bean accepted through

the —

I
QUESTION:

•

that she did. give him permission?
MR* APRILS:

I mean have they said specifically
t

• ;

They have said that the items were

placed in her purse with her knowledge, yes.
QUESTION:

Well, that is not the same thing as

24
permission,,
MR. APRILE:

Ho finder of fact has ever based a

decision to deny the motion to suppress in this case on
the basis that there was not permission given.
QUESTION:

Well, why did anybody ever have to

get to automatic standing then in this case if you are
claiming that you have a privacy interest in the purses
that the selsure of your property was the product of an
illegal search of what is in effect your property * why
the big hassle about automatic search?
MR. APRILE:

Well, because when it started,.

Your Honor, the very first thing that the trial defense
attorney did was say this is a possessory offense alleged
to have occurred and the possession at the time of the
illegal search and seizure gives us automatic standing.
That was injected and fchen,, rather than give up the
claim, he went ahead and testified as to his ownership
of the drugs, generating both
QUESTION:

Well, was this claim ever made to

anybody, this particular theory?
MR. APRILE;

Yes, sir, it has been presented

all the way through the case.
QUESTION:
MR. APRILE:
QUESTION:

And has been rejected at every level?
Yes, sir.
On what basis, that you didn’t have

an interest in the purse or what?
MR. APRILE:

On the basis that he was vicariously

asserting somebody elsef3 rights, that's exactly right,
that even though he was saying that these were his drugs
and he admitted ownership, the Supreme Court of Kentucky

That wouldn't be enough.

You have

to say that you had & privacy interest in the purse.

MR, APRILE;
QUESTION:
MR. APRILE;

Yess sir.

In fact --

Is that presented anywhere?
It is presented all the way

through the proceedings. Your Honor»

Page 8 of the state­

ment of facts In the brief points out that in summarising
the issues before the intermediate appellate court, they
said that the appellant also contends that the search
warrant for the premises did not authorise the search of
ail persons on the premises»

So it is all the way through.

All of these issues are properly before this Court.

We

have raised the® and each court has ruled upon the®, and
this has been no attempt to supplement it at this level,
our position.
I would just- like to ask this Court t© consider
with me the very reality of the expectation ©f privacy
;

that we would have.

Consider if you were walking with

your spouse and you were carryings for example, a diary
and it was getting cumbersone and you said to your wife
will you put this in your purse for me, and. she says yes,
I will put it in the purse.

Are we to believe that

29

society no longer would recognise your own personal ex­
pectation of privacy, even though she is carrying that?
If you give to si© some of your papers to carry
in my briefcase because you don’t have a briefcase while
we are walking down the street, and it is easier for one
of us to carry it, have you lost your right of privacy?
Clearly, there is an expectation of privacy there„
In the reply brief I have cited for you Prof»
Goffman In ^Relations in Public,” talking about what people
expect with regard to privacy rights, and one of the key

QUESTIOM:
tion*

Mr, Aprile, let me ask you one ques­

You referred to Arkansas v„ Sanders and Chadwick.

How finely can you slice that — I use the word "onion"
not with any disrespect, although I did dissent, but that
concept.

Suppose it is not a footlocker, it is not a

suitcase, but it is a small paper bag, does the same
ruling still apply?
MR. APRILE:

I noticed in Criminal Law Reporter

Just recently, I can’t remember, I think It was the
California court that just recently said you had no expec­
tation in a fast food cup, expectation of privacy in a
fast food cup.

I would go along with that.

QUESTION:

That is heartening to know.

(Laughter)
MR. APRILE:

I think. Your Honor, that In

Arkansas v„ Sanders, the very strong reference to the
fact that it didn’t matter, that this was a briefcase that

was.! unlocked, you knew, I think that really fits quite

WtiMl with the purse.

I think if you will notice in the Goffaian .
material that I cited to you in the reply brief from.
"Relations in Public s K they talk about perhaps even the
pockets on your raincoat,

you could share that with

someone and they would have an expectation or privacy
with you.

Society is ready to recognise that sort of

thing and I thought that is what we were talking about in
Rakas s was it subjectively reasonable and was it an in­
terest that society was ready to recognize.
I suspect that somewhere between the purse that
is closed up and not open to view and the paper cup from
the fast food company, we can slice the onion in. a way
that we will know, but that of course is your job and. not
mine.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF VICTOR POX, ESQ.,
Ok
MR. FOX:

behalf op the respondent

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Automatic standing in possession oases is no
longer necessary for the protection of substantive Fourth
Amendment rights»

As we have heard this afternoon, the

pm :ls for automatic standing which earns out in Jones was
simply the problem of self«incrimination, i.e., the clash
between on® asserting his Fourth Amendment rights at per-*
-

!

■'■■■''

Li

'■

<

haps the expense of the Fifth Amendment; and the second
\

aspect, which we contend hEsically was thrown' in as an
afterthought, and that is the so-called vice of prosecutor'ial self«contradiction.
■m

We submit simply that Simmons has solved the

33
problem at least of that portion of Jones which says self-incrimination,

An individual may go in at & motion to

suppress and assert his Fourth Amendment substantive
rights without fear of this being used against him as
evidence of his guilt at trial.
The fact that it may come back a little later
as perhaps impeachment purposes ? we would submit is not
sufficient to expand, the exclusionary rule t© exclude
this.

The purpose of the exclusionary rulea of course* is

to deter unlawful police conduct*

In a Fifth Amendment

context* in the Harris ease* this Court has said we are
unwilling to extend the exclusionary rule to the point
where it would gix^e the defendant the right to commit
perjury.

We are submitting that this is Just as. applic-

•si»§£ to the Fourth Amendment right as it is withifr-; the
Fifth Amendment..

This we submit is sufficient as, to

impeachment purposes.
The petitioner in this case lias pointed: out a
case in Kentucky called Jett, and I would like to read
the rule in Jett for the purpose of substantive use.

And

it says * “Out of court statements made by any person who
appears as a witness * which statement is relevant and
material to issues* may be received as substantive evi­
dence through another witness and need not be limited to
Impeachment purposes,

We submit that this is simply the very situation
which Simmons attempted or* does in fact , we submit s cure.
First of all, we would say that testimony at a suppression
hearing is not necessarily an out of court statement.
is part of the same proceedings.
:

It

Second , it would require

that the person making the statement, i„e,s the accused,

*•' first testify as a witness before Jett would come, into
■ jl
play»

;;

Finally,' the key hare, that which is substantive,
V materials relevant to the issues, i«e.a substantive us®
of evidence of guilt, is that which is prohibited In

It

'Sigmons.

That leaves only the ifepeaenent aspect of jit, a

i'rr contradictory statement which we submit again, as- previi .

oiigjly pointed out, is permissible.

-V;" »',»

Finally, the basis for the -*■ the only basis X
-■should say left for Jones for the automatic concept,
than the substantive Fourth .Amendment rights,; is

I

the: vice of prosecutorial self-contradiction.

This jls

sWS

■ft'f the only aspect, as the dissent in a footnote in \
-points out, this is the only thing that is really*'i.djft
of Jones c
We have here people who are accused of a posses­
sory crime being treated, substantially different than any
other accused.

For example, X would like to point out in

the same factual situation as in this case, we add on©

35
additional element 3 a third person has a revolver in Mrs 0
Cos's purse,

As a result of that revolver being found in

her purse, he Is charged with murder.

Mow, the respondent

—* petitioner would have us believe that Mr, Rawlings is
entitled to automatic standing, i„e.B assertion of Mrs.
Cost’s Fourth Amendment rights, because of his possessionary
/erirae where the individual who is charged with murder
cannot assert vicarious Fourth Amendment right or vicar!»,
ously assert it.
We are creating or have created by this- one re­
maining aspect of Jones a special class of defendant out

There is nothing contradictory about

that.
Assuming that there is no longer the need —
QUESTION;

Except for Simmons, there would be

a problem for the defendant.

36
MR* FOX:

There would be a problem for the self-»

Incrimination aspect? yess Your Honor, as with any other
defendant.
QUESTION:

So absent Simmons, what do you think

about Jones?
MR. FOX:

What do I think about Jones?

I think

Simmons articulated somewhat more clear what Jones at­
tempted to do and that la resolve the problem between the
Fourth and Fifth Amendments.
QUESTION:

Do you think under Simmons that not

only any evidence at the hearing but any fruits of that
evidence would be excludable?
ME. FOX;

Are you referring to the fishing ex­

pedition aspect of it?
QUESTION:

Well, suppose •=— I take it under

■Simmons if the defendant took the stand at the suppression
hearing and said IC had possession of these drugs, that
that would be excludable at Ms trial.
MR,. FOX:
QUESTION:

Yes, four Honor.
Suppose he said some other things

that gave the prosecution some hints and they tracked
down some other evidence as a result of what they heard,
at the suppression hearing from the defendant, do you
think under Simmons that all those things are excludable,

toe?

37
MR» POX:

ff'oa Your Honor, I do not believe that

they are all excludable*

The point is thats first of all,

Sisasaona excludes those items —
QUESTION:

Well, isn*t there something to what

your friend an the other side says about the dangers of
overruling that part of Jones?
MR* FOX:

If these other statements, other items

go to the issue of guilt or innocence or go to guilt, as
Simmons refers, I believe they would be prohibited by
Simmonsc.

But if it goes beyond that, If It is immaterial,

•?

then the exclusion which comm from evidence which is not
material to or irrelevant to the issues is not admissible.
QUESTION:

What If at the suppression hearing

the question that your friend hypothesized, that Is, did
you! have these drugs for the purpose of selling them, and
• ari 'immediata- objection,, the objection is overruled; by the
hearing judge and he is ordered to answer, how would that
be, held a? self*» incrimination?

MR* POX:

,

.

Well, Your Honor, under Kentucky law
i

'

th®' charge of traf ficking does include not only possession

:
"
but the sale, and bo forth,, and It would be ho more so
t-hfe that is the purpose of Sirnmns, to prevent the" asser­
tio r. of the Fourth Amendment right at the expense of the
Fifth Amendment, the self-incrimination.

At a suppression

hearing, it Is not a determination of guilt or innocence.

30
and whether this can be used at a later point In time on
that Issue «**•*
QUESTION:

Is the question that I postulated to

you relevant to the suppression hearing, that is, did you
have these drugs for the purpose of selling them, did

you

intend to sell them, had you sold some of them, is that
relevant?
MR* FOX:
QUESTION:
MR. FOX:
QUESTION:

It is really not relevant or material.
It shouldn’t be allowed, should it?
No, Your Honor,
But if he is compelled under an

order of the court to answer.^ he is being compelled to
incriminate himself, isn’t he* unless that evidence Is
excluded at the ferial.
MR, FOX:

He has not been compelled to incrim­

inate himself because that evidence is not admissible at
trial because it goes to —
QUESTION:

ife at trial, that is the only protection he' has got against

self«incrimination.

MR. FOX:
QUESTION;
MR. FOX:

»

That’s correct, four Honor.
So you concede that?
1 will concede that without the

Simmons protection anything he says at the suppression
hearing can be used that goes to the issue of guilt.

39
QUESTION:

Actually, prior to Jones all of the

trend in the lower courts has been exactly the opposite to
Jones, had it not, that the defendant had simply to fish
or cut bait on the question?
ML FOX:
it.

Yes, Your Honor, that was basically

He had fco flip a coin and if it came down Fourth

•I, Amendment he went after his Fourth Amendment rights. If
" it canae down Fifth Amendment he didn’t»

QUESTION:

Perhaps the moral of that story is

that you should keep out of the narcotics business,
MR. FOX:

Very well. Your Honor.

We submit that simply Simmons has resolved these
issues and that under the prosecutorial concept &f selfcontradiction no longer being a valid basis for retention
of the automatic standing, we then look at. the issues as
they com® to expectation of privacy, and in Kakas this

MR, FOX?

Your example is relevant only in the

fecit that his mare presence is and of itself the sole de­

His presence is merely a factor among

His presence there is but one factor.

MR* FOX:

would have no effect upon his expectation of privacy In
her purse, applying the factors, and assuming that he had
n© reasonable expectation of privacy in her purse under

fact that he placed his drugs in her purse create an ex­

Well, the court below in this case

said that although warrants do not ordinarily authorise
the search of persons in a room, the search of this purse
wasn’t the search of a person.

It was just life© searching

any other containers on the premises for marijuana.

Now,
l

I take it you don’t agree with that, although that is what
your court said.
MR, FOX:

Our trial court in its opinion also

-— and I will make this point — we have basically sine©
X believe the Court of Appeals interned:.ate said that the
search of her purse was a warrantless search and must be
justified under some* other exclusion or some exemption to
it*

The courts have agreed —
QUESTION:

So you’ve abandoned that part of the

trial court * s —
MR. FOX:

Basicallyt Your Honor, we have*

That

order also in there states that there was a finding that
he had no expectation of privacy in her purse..

That point

is In there9 in response to an earlier question of Your

49
Honor0
QUESTION;

If we agree with you on jour automatic

standing theory, we have to reach in order to affirm, we
still have to reach any other Fourth Amendment issue that
is fairly before us.
MR» FOX;

We have to — assuming that the auto­

matic standing no longer exists, we then must look at the
fasts of this ease,surrounding this case within that concept.
First of all3 did he hare & reasonable expectation —
QUESTION;

Well, we hair® to answer the questions

that he raises in his petition for certiorari.
MR. FOX:

That is correct,, that is that he had

an expectation of privacy in her purses which we deny, and
that his expectation of privacy in the drugs was insuf­
ficient to constitute a protected interest*,
QUESTION:

Mr. Fox, on the question of whether he

had sui expectation of privacy in her purse, how do we
answer that?

Do we answer that based on the relationship

between the parties or on our judgment as to whether ha
actually expected that nobody would look Inside the purse?
What is the test?
MR. FOX;

Well, there are some factors that we

must, look at, and I would — basically these are the nature
of the premises or the activity involved,

the personal

interest In that point, the steps taken by the individual

50
to protect that privacy 9 and whether society res.3 Xy
characterises that as something which is to b® protected,

These are all factors
factor as well»

A possessory Interest; is really a

It is not the sole purpose., but we apply

all of these factors and we look at the situation Involv­
ing the purse, and that is first of all he has no possessory
Interest in the purse, he didn^t buy the purse, he dicing
give it to her* it wasn’t his that she was carrying for
him.
What steps did he take to protect the privacy of

the purse?

He didn't attempt to hid® it* he didn’t say

don * t let anybody see this.

Society*s characterisation,

which I gave earlier, of ay spouse*s purse as opposed to
my expectation of privacy In someone else*® spouse's purs®
or someone elsefa purse, this characterisation* society
I don't think would characterize that he really had some
interest In her purs®* some expectation of privacy in her

purse»
QUESTION:

Suppose he handed this to her-and

put it in her pocket or her dress, would he expect any
privacy then?
MR, FOX:
QUESTION:

Her expectation of privacy
I’m going to toe fair with you.

My

next question is what is the difference between that and
the pocket bock.

53.
MR, FOX;
question*,

Basically I will answer your second

1 don!t. see too much difference0

Mow, th© pur­

pose is what Is his expectation of privacy in her dress.
She has a tremendous expectation of privacy In both her
puree end that which society is willing to recognise.
QUESTION;
MR* FOX;

I see.
It only goes to what society and what

his expectation is in that* and I believe there are many 3
many eases in which the search of the purse and so forth
is sufficiant.
Now, if

- 4
he had under the same factual situation

had been in the habit of carrying stuff in her pockets or
putting stuff in her pockets or with her consent and she
had not said I don’t want it in there, then 1 don’t think
it makes any difference whether it is her purse or her
pocksts.
QUESTION:

Suppose as an alternative she had

been charged with .possession of the drugs»
MR. FOX,:
QUESTION:

We wouldn’t fee hers, four Honor.

Then she would be able to assert the

Fourth Amendment right to -»«
MR. FOX;

By all means»

By all means, and I

don’t believe we would be tare if she had asserted her
Fourth Amendment right to privacy»
If there are no further questions, thank you.
