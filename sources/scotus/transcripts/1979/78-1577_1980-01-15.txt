MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hoar arguments

next in Sears, Roebuck against County of Los Angeles,
No. 73-1577
Ilr. Garb, I think you may proceed whenever you're
ready.
OPAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW S. GARB, ESO.,
ON BEHALF OF TIT' PETITIONER
MR. GARB:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
This case cones to the Court on stipulated facts.
The case involves the constitutionality of California’s
Revenue and Taxation Code, Section 225.
That statute was enacted in 1975, following attempts
by the assessors in California to impose the personal property
tax on imported goods held in the State that had long been
considered immune under the original package doctrine.
In order to avoid and prevent the diversion of
import business from. California to other States that offered
more attractive tax laws, California enacted this exemption
which applied to imported goods held in the State for
shipment to other States.
The respondents here have attacked the statute as
being unconstitutional, alleging that the exemption that
was extended to imported goods held for shipment out of

4
the State nuat- also be extended to interstato croodc travel ling
through the State as well.
On the tax rule elate, in 1976, the petitioner
held imported goods in a warehouse in the State of California
for shipment out of the State.

These are precisely the type o

goods that are exempt under Section 225.
QUESTION:

Hr. Garb, are you going to address

yourself to the standing issue of the County of Los Angeles
at all7
MR. GARB:

I had not intended to, Your honor,

althouah we believe that that issue is certainly an interest-ina one, and one presented in the California courts.
QUESTION:

Cell—

MR. GARB:

I would be happy to address myself to

that issue if Your Honors—
QUESTION:

I, for one, would be interested,

considering it a part of our Article II jurisdictional
limitation.
MR. GARB:

Certainly; let me address myself at this

time to that issue.
Me’re in an interesting situation here.

There is

no evidence in this case that any shipper of interstate goods
has over been injured by this statute; indeed, we know
no lawsuit brouaht by any interestate shipper to cor.plai
about this.

£

Ue rather
situation.

have, ourselves in a rather anomalous

Ue have the County of Los Angeles, which is the

revenue collecting authority arguing here that its parent,
the State of California, that enacted an exemption statute,
didn't go far enough.
And what they’re contending here is that the
statute should have gone further and exempted more goods.
Therefore, we have the kind of situation where there
is no injured party, no evidence of actual injury to anyone in a
protected class who has ever brought a case of this sort.
QUESTION:

Certainly no more than injury in fact, at

MRo GARB:

We have even no injury in fact, Your

most.

Honor.

What we had in the Court of Appeals was an invalidation

of this statute based on certain assumptions, certain assumed
competition between goods.
And we submit not only that there was no evidence
that these assumptions in fact exist in fact; but moreover,
the hypothetical construct, the abstraction that was relied upon
by the Court of Appeals was in fact erroneous.
And if I may address myself to that for a moment,
the concept that was created by the Court of Appeals to
invalidate the statute was a suggestion that somehow the
Revenue and Taxation Code, Section 225, affords a competitive
advantage to imported goods, when they compete with similar

G
domestic goods.
How, as Fr. Justice P.ehnquist pointed out, not
only is there no evidence of such competition in fact, but
we submit that that construct is erroneous for at least two
\

reasons*
First, we have many States in this country that have
so-called free port laws; roughly three-quarters of the States»
None of these free port laws exempt locally manufactured
goods that are sold within the State»

Very few of those

statutes exempt locally manufactured goods that are shipped
to other States»
Accordingly, imported goods that are exempt under
these other free port. States compete with domestic goods that
have been taxed, either in those States or in other States.
The same type of competitive advantage that is alleged to
exist as a. result of 225 exists as well.
And independent of that, we have as a corollary
of our Federal system the fact that States have broad
autonomy to fashion their own tax systems.

Indeed, we have

States such as New York that have decided to impose no
personal property tax whatsoever.
Therefore, when goods are imported through New
York, and compete with domestic goods in other States which
have been subjected to tax in those other States, as a
result of the interaction between the New York statute and

7
the other st/vtes' tax laws, the imported goods that were
free of tax that came from New York again have precisely the
same type of competitive advantage that 225 of the
California Revenue and Taxation Code is alleged to afford.
Nov;, if this type of advantage is perceived as an
evil, it cannot be eradicated by striking Section 225.

In

fact, it could not even be eradicated by striJ^ing the free
port acts of three-quarters of the Sta.tes in this country.
We v/ould submit that this problem—if this situation
is perceived as a problem, the only solution v/ould be for
Congress to impose uniformity and require that all States
either refrain from taxing personal property completely, or
that all States tax at precisely the same rate.
And this, we would submit, goes far beyond any­
thing that this Ccfurt has ever held or suggested; and indeed,
flies in the face of basic principles of federalism, in our
country.
QUESTIONS

Hr. Garb, let me ask a curious question.

Where is the Attorney General of California in this case0
MRo GARB;

The Attorney General of California did

not participate in this case0
QUESTION;

Why not°

Why isn't he here defending his

MR» GARB:

The Attorney General of California was

statute?

not

a party in terms of the plaintiffs and defendants in the

3

lawsuit.
QUESTION:

Ilaybe I should ask your opponents this,

but it is strange when an Attorney General is not here
defending his statute.

T7e have a case tomorrow in which

he's coming and defending, and his presence is contested.
He wasn’t here on this one.
HRo GARB:

I see.

Other than participation as an

amicus, he would not have had an opportunity to be involved
in this case.

And I can certainly represent to Your Honor

that he was never asked to participate as an amicus, so I
would not want there to be any inference that the Attorney
General has declined to participate in defense of the statute.
QUESTION:

Hell, he doesn't, have to be asked if a

State statute is being challenged, does he-3
MRo GARB:

Not to mv knowledge, Your Honor, but the

subject was never broached.

And indeed, we have never had

any contact with the State Attorney General.
QUESTION:

Aren't you required to notify him

officially that a State statute was under attack"
MRo GARB:

Mr. Justice Marshall, there is no

requirement in the State of California to do that, no,
QUESTION:

We had one other case with a Pennsylvania

statute under fire, and the Attorney General refrained, in
fact, said it was unconstitutional; we thought it was a little
strange.

9

IiRo GARB:

I would think so as well.

One last point that I would like to make on the
matter that we were discussing, and that is this, that we
also feel that it is very unlikely that these differences
in State tax laws are even taken into account by Congress
and the President in fashioning tariffs, as was suggested
by the Court of Appeals and is relied upon by respondento
For as I have said, when we have some States that
impose no property tax at all, other States that may tax at
a high rate, other States thathave different exemptions from
each other, it seems to be virtually an impossibility for
Congress to take this potpourri of laws .into effect in
fashioning tariffs.
And even if they could somehow do that, since there
are changes in these laws from time to time, it would require
an almost constant monitoring by Congress of these laws.
And for that reason, we also believe that this abstraction
by the Court of Appeals is erroneous.
Finally—QUESTION:

May I ask another question on standing

that Justice Relinquish raised?
It's true that the-—as I understand the case-—if
the exemption were broader, it would defeat the argument that
they make.

But. why can' t they argue that the exemption

itself is unconstitutional; if you eliminate the exemption,

10

you'll also elininate the disparity.

And they do gain tax

revenues if you hold the exemption unconstitutional.
T7hy doesn't that give then standing

I don’t quite

follow.
MRo GARB:

Exempting goods from, tax we know is

within the purview of the legislature to do, as New York has
done.
QUESTION:

Yes,, but if it's within a statute that

generally imposes a tax, as Section 225 says the goods
involved here are not subject to tax.

And the County of

Los Angeles says, that exemption is unconstitutional.

If

you knock it out, we will get tax revenue.
Uhy doesn't that give them standing"
MRo GARB:

Because, Your Honor, as I see it, the

reason that they are basing this entire attack on the statute
is an alleged discrimination.

They've contended that, there

is someone against whom the statute works in a discriminatory
way.
QUESTION:

And they're sayina you remove the

discrimination by holding the exemption unconstitutional.
IlRo GARB:

That is what they're savinw.

But we

QUESTION:

And they will get more revenue if you do

know—

that?

I

MRo GARB:

Correct.

But we know that in

11
cases in which discrimination is the basis of the attack,
the tests enunciated by this Court suggest, as the Court did
in First Federal Savings & Loan v. the State Tax Commission,
that it is necessary to see how the statute operates in fact,
to see

if

the practical effect of this statute is to

create a competitive handicap.
We know of no case-—
QUESTION:

But doesn’t that go to the merits rather

than the standing, is what I’m saying?

MRo GARB:

Well, it

goes to the nature of the

attack; it’s an attack on discrimination.

And in order to

prove, or to demonstrate discrimination, this Court has
legitimately held that it. is necessary to show that the statute
in fact creates a discriminatory effect.
We know of no situation in which the effect was
assumed to exist, as the Court of Appeals did in our
case.

And it seems to us—
QUESTION:

And you say it’s a discriminatory

effect if the goods come from. Nevada, they’re subject to
tax; if they come from Canada, they're not subject to tax0
HRo GARB:

If they are shipped out of the State

of California thereafter, correct.
QUESTION:

If that's transshipped out of the city.

MRo GARB:

Right.

QUESTION:

.And that' s a discrimination—-and why

isn’t that a discrimination0
MRo GARB:

Pardon me°

QUESTION:

Why was that not a discrimination0

MR0 GARB:

Me 1.1, there is no—

QUESTION:

I mean, maybe it's not an

unconstitu­

tional discrimination, but why isn't it at least a
that gives them standing?
MR* GARB:

disparity

I—

Well, it is a differential in treatment„

However, in order to have standing to challenge the statute
on discriminatory grounds-—
QUESTION:

You have to show the statute costs you

some money.
MRo GARB:

—the statute-—well, you have to show

if discrimination is the basis, that there is indeed a
discriminated class.
QUESTION;

Well, don’t you also have to shew more

than just injury in fact, the loss of money that Justice
Stevens was referring to?
protected interest.

That you’re within the zone of

And there’s a two-step analysis, as I

understand it from Warfch against Seldon and from Barlow's and
Data Processing.

Injury in fact simply is not enough to

confer standing.
MRo GARB:

I believe that is correct, Your Honor.

And my use of the term, "injured class," or "discriminatedagainst class," was intended to mean a class entitled to

13
protection under those cases, and under the doctrine—
QUESTION:
here7

Is there really a standing problem

Didn't this case gat started by the denial of an

exemption?
MRo GARB:

Yes it did, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

And Sears applied for an exemption,

claimed an exemption7
MR„ GARB:

It did,,

QUESTION:

It was denied?

MRo GARB:

It was„

QUESTION:

It was denied on two grounds.

MRo GARB:

It was denied on--

QUESTION:

Statutory, local statutory grounds, and

constitutional grounds.
MRo GARB:

That is correct.

QUESTION:

And Sears took the decision up.

Now, is

there really a lack of a case or controversy when somebody-—
when they're about to levy a tax, and it's objected to7

MRo GARB:

Well, Your Honor, I think when you

B

perceive it—
QUESTION:

That may be—I can’t imagine why there's

any case or controversy.
MRo GARB:

Well, the standing problem that we see

is that the argument throughout the brief of the respondent-QUESTION:

Well, it's not an Article III question,

14
you knov?.

Is it a prudential—that the county just .shouldn’t

be able to assert a constitutional issue, even though
there's a perfectly good case or controversy here0
IlRo GARB:

Well, I think it really exists on two

different levels, first the question of whether the progeny
of the State can attack the enactments of its parent at all;
and secondly, even if it can—
QUESTION:

And the tax assessor says, "I take an

oath to observe the Constitution of the United States, too."
And—
QUESTION;;

But the tax assessor isn’t a party to

MRo GARB:;

That is correct.

QUESTION::

It's just the County of Los Angeles.

MRo GARB::

That is precisely correct.

this suit.

The assessor---

you don’t have one of those situations where a government
representative is being told personally to engage in an
act—
QUESTION:

No, but who is on the other side when—how

did this case get started0
MRo GARB:

How did it get into the courts0

It got into the courts by the denial-

after the denial of the exemption.

Sear, Roebuck filed suit,

against the County of Los Angeles as the revenue collection
agent, not—
QUESTION:

Well, who else would they have sued0

15
Nobody.

That’s the procedure that's provided.
MRo GARB:

That's correct.

QUESTION:

He is—that is the tax collector.

MRo GARB:

Well, the assessor is the tax collector,

In sone states, Your

Honor~

the personal tax collector.
QUESTION:

No.

That isn't—apparently, under

State law, you don't sue the assessor, you sue the county.
MRo G.ARB:

That is correct, and precisely for that

reason, you do not cone within those cases that permit an
individual who has been called upon to perform an act that
he believes is unconstitutional to file suit, or to defend
suit himself, and to have standing to do so, to avoid the
necessity of his engaging in an unconstitutional act.
QUESTION:

So it is a standing problem; it's not a

case or controversy problem?
MR0 GARB:

I see it as a standing problem.

The Court of Appeals in this case reasoned that if
the case only involved an equal protection question, the
statute would be valid, because it has a rational distinction.
And under this Court's decision in Allied Stores of Ohio v.
Bowers, the statute would not run afoul of the equal protection
clause.
However, the Court of Appeals went further, and
actually held that any differentiation between interstate

cind foreign commerce is unconstitutional as a regulation of
foreign commerce and interstate commerce.
Now, with respect to cases involving discrimination
against interstate commerce, under thecommerce clause, the
traditional history of the clause has been that it is
applied to invalidate State laws that are used to discriminate
against interstate commerce as a means of favoring local
economic interests.
In this case, California taxed local goods precisely
the same as it taxed goods traveling in interstate commerce.
Moreover, it did not use discrimination as a method of
benefiting local economic interests.
For these reasons, the Boston Stock Exchange case,
and the other cases relied upon by respondents, and by the
Court of Appeals, are inapposite.
Now with respect to the concern of thecommerce
clause as to the foreign power-—foreign commerce power of
Congress,the concern there has been to avoid disruption, to
avoid,

interference with foreign relations.
Just last term in Japan Line, Ltd, v. County of

Los Angeles,

this case—-this Court struck down the

application of the California law with respect to the
taxation of foreign instrumentalities in foreign commerce.
There we had a situation in which the unfavorable
treatment of foreign commerce could create the possibility

17
of embarrassment or retaliation?

by contrast, in the case at

bar, we have a statute that treats foreign goods favorably,
and does not result in any potential for frustration or
embarrassment to the national government.
Mr. Chief Justice, if I may, 1 would like to
reserve the remaining time for rebuttal.
MRo CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Garb.

Mr. Broim.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERNEST JD BROWN, ESQ0,
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE
MRo BROWN:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
Speaking for the United States as amicus in this
case, wTe believe there is no substantial basis for a
constitutional challenge to Section 225 of California's
Revenue and Taxation Code; and that it is the interest of the
United States that it be sustained.
This is not a case, as many cases

involving

State taxation that have come to this Court are, as the
Court has described them, cases where the legitimate interests
of a State—financial, fiscal, or in other cases, health-—
point in one direction, and the interest of the Federal
government in free and open trade points in another.
Hera, they coincide.

And California, perhaps

recognising that great cities grow and develop at points of

IG
transshipment, seeking to remove obstacles that this Court in
Michelin said were tolerable, but nevertheless, burdens
some

to

extent ; seeking to remove obstacles that New York

removes, the first port of the country, removes by statute,
in providing against any taxation of personal property on an
ad valorem basis; that Louisiana, the second port of the
country most of the time, gives a much broader exemption even
than California, to imported goods.
California moves in this area to remove this
obstacle.

Now, the Court below invoked two grounds, one, a

certain inconsistency which it asserted with the tariff laws;
with respect-“that seems almost fanciful.

The Congress is

certainly aware of the patchwork of State property tax
laws.

Over the years, their non-uniformity from the extreme

of New York on down.

And of the rates.

If the tariff laws were affected, this would freeze
all State statutes.

Rates couldn't be changed; exemptions

couldn’t be changed one way or the other.

More than that,

there's really no correlation between tariff statutes and
these annual property taxes.
The tariff is imposed on all goods, dutiable goods,
that come into the country.

Property taxes may or may not

affect any goods that come in.

They may be consumed before

the annual tax day, which varies from State to State.
may run, as it were, a

slalom

They

course around--between the

19

property taxes.

Or on the other hand, they nay

label

and be taxed more than once.
But there's no correlation at all.

And as I say,

the other argument would require that these be frozen.
The second ground asserted by the State is
discrimination which has been discussed.
is not an abstract.

And discrimination

And if we assume that California rather

than an interstate shipper can invoke this—statutes, Hr.
Justice Stevens, I believe are not held unconstitutional in
the abstract? someone who is hurt usually has to invoke
specific grounds.

the

I heard something in the argument that

just preceded us on a very different basis.

But in any event

here, during a hundred years, while this Court held that
goods-—imports in their original package were exempt from
property tax, it was also holding—in fact, for four years
before Low v. Austin, in Woodruff v. Parham, that interstate
goods in their original package were not exempt.
New, I can hardly believe that the Court, having
formed, perhaps erroneously as it has recently held, an
exemption for interstate goods would tolerate this discrimi­
nation if it were an unconstitutional discrimination.
So that I think the Court would be reluctant to
impose upon its predecessors for a hundred years this
unconstitutional—not erroneous, but unconstitutional action.
Moreover, the Federal statute on air transportation

20

creates the same differentiation.

It taxes interstate

air* transportation and domestic, but not foreign.
So we have a parallel in Congressional action.
More than that, this Court has frequently—-and as
pointed out, as recently as last term in Japan Llnes~-pointed
out the preeminence of the Federal interest in foreign
commerce, while noting that the control of interstate commerce
is more a matter—-shared with the States and the Federal
government.
And this differentiation has existed throughout? the
Court itself in a number of instances has differentiated.

The

impact of the 21st amendment is only one situation.
So this discrimination-—I prefer to say differentia­
tion—-is one widely recognized.

And before it is taken as a

basis for invalidating action that parallels the Federal
action and is in the Federal interest, it should be shown, we
believe, to have adversely affected someone who is engaged in
interstate commerce? not someone merely who would seek to
increase the revenues of a county as opposed to the action of
that State.
Thank you, Your Honors.
MRo CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Clark, at the outset

would you mind clarifying for us the absence of the Attorney
General of the State?

Many States, as you know, or some, at

least, have statutes requiring the Attorney General to defend

21
the State statute whenever and wherever it's attacked.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES DEXTER CLARK, EDO.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS,
MR, CLARK:

Yes, Your Honor.

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:
The State has been told, and is fully informed of
the proceedings? and has been informed of those proceedings
ever since this case arrived at the Court of Appeals below.
I have been in personal contact with the Attorney
General, the State Board of Equalization, and have also been
called at their own initiative by the State Office for
Economic Development and International Trade.
I have explained the situation.

I have explained

my position on this particular statute; that is, the
respondent's position on this particular statute.

And as

far as I know, California has determined to take no action
with regard to this case.
QUESTION:

Does that mean he agrees that the

statute is unconstitutional
MR, CLARK:

I cannot speak for the Attorney

General, because I have only spoken with assistants and
deputies. And my telling this Court, Your Honor, that Mr.
7
Dukmeijan believes one way or the other, I think would be
incorrect.
I have been informally involved with that, and

22
perhaps it would be best if 1 simply said that I v;as in
contact, and they were aware of our position.

They have

indicated to me informal views which perhaps—with all
due respect, Your Honor, maybe it would be better if I just
didn’t talk about those, because they are not the position of
the office.
QUESTION:

In any event, I suppose itEs your

position that having informed the Attorney General, you have
discharged any obligation which the County has in the matter,
and from there on, it's up to him?
MRo CLARK:

Yes, Your Honor.

And I think that that

is certainly true insofar as the State statutes- are concerned;
and I think that that is admitted by the petitioners here,
that there is no real requirement for us to notify the
State Attorney General that this statute is under attack.
I realise that there is a parallel statute—or,
not a parallel statute, but there is a statute covering the
parallel situation when a Federal statute or a Federal
enactment is under attack for us to notify the Attorney
General or Solicitor General.
QUESTION:

Will you advise us as to the status of

the pending California legislation?

MRo CLARK:

Yes, Your Honor; the State has effective

ly repealed Section 225; it is not effective for the future.
QUESTION:

Well, was there not also refund

23
legislation?
MR» CLARK:

Yes, Your Honor.

It has passed the

Senate, and it is now in the State Assembly Revenue and
Taxation Committee.
QUESTION:

What is your estimate as to the likeli­

hood of that passage?
MRo CLARK:
QUESTION:
MRo CLARK:

It really—-I have no feel for that.
Are you opposing it?
Your Honor, we—the County’s position is

that we're going to lose money, and we would like to be
reimbursed for any refunds that take place.

Because the

way the statute is presently worded, the counties would have
to reimburse.

What we’d like to have the State do is

reimburse it through their general fund, rather than ours.
It’s a matter of county versus State kind of
who gives the money, and where it comes from, at this point.
QUESTION:
MR. CLARK:

Nov? what has been repealed?
Section 225, the statute in question,

has been repealed effectively by the enactment of an overall
exemption, which exempts all inventory from taxation in the
State of California, Whether it comes in interstate-—
QUESTION:
MRo CLARK:

Right.
—or foreign commerce.

If I may, I’d like to address myself briefly to
Mr* Justice Stevens’ and Mr. Justice Rehnquist’s questions.

QUESTION;
MRo CLARK;
QUESTION;

Could I just ask you for a minute?
Yes, Fir. Justice White.
I take it the California courts saw

no problem with your taking the position

you do and

mitigating the issue?
MRo CLARK;

No, Your Honor, as a. matter of fact, as

I was about to point out, in terms of the so-called standing
issue, the case arises, as has been pointed out to this
Court, in the context of a taxation event by the local county.
We made this taxation on the ground that the statute
could have a narrow interpretation, and that the goods here
involved ought to be taxable.
One of our positions with regard to that
interpretation was that a broad interpretation which would
include these issues would run into constitutional difficultie
And so we took that position, made the tax; were in turn sued
for a refund by the petitioners here.
The question was raised as to whether we could
consider the constitutional issue

either as a support for

an interpretation or by itself, if one were to take
automatically the broad interpretation—
QUESTION;

I take it the county is the State * s

assessing agent?
MRo CLARK:

Yes, Your Honor,

As a matter of fact,

the assessor was a party to this action in Superior Court',

25

and we stipulated out the assessor’s presence.
QUESTION;
MR. CLARK;

Because the county-Simply because it was the county.

And as a matter of fact, they had named a former assessor,
and we felt that rather than, having the former assessor’s
name on because of certain political considerations, we
thought it would be better if we simply had it in the
entities that were required to be sued by statute.
I should point out, Your Honor, that Revenue
Taxation Code Section 538, which was described in our
response to a petition for a hearing before the State Supreme
Court, has been enacted by the legislature, largely in
response to the Section—to this problem.
And that Section reads that the statute charges—
I’m sorry, the section charges assessors for leaving a state
tax, or a state exemption, to be unconstitutional, quote-—
those assessors—-shall, in lieu of making such an assessment
bring an action for declaratory relief against the State Board
of Equalization.
And the legislative analyst, in describing that
statute for the legislature, gave exactly the same rendition
of the assessor’s requirements to follow the constitution as
the Court of Appeals did.
In essence, the State legislature has recognised
the authority of the County to bring an action to declare

26
invalid under the constitution a state exemption; and at the
same time, recognized the previous authority of the assessor
to render the assessment in view of his own belief, as the
constitutional pr-oblem.
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Clark, are you familiar with

our decision in Doremus v. Board of Education

in 342 U0S„,

where the State of New Jersey Supreme Court held that a
taxpayers' action would lie to challexxge the constitutionality
of a release time program under Hew Jersey law.
standing on the taxpayer.

There was

And this Court dismissed the appeal

because it said New Jersey is free to determine for itself
State standing questions, but that it!s a Federal question
whether you have a standing to raise a Federal constitution
question.

MRc CLARK:
acquainted with that.

No, Your Honor, I have not become
I was relying on Board of Education v„

Allen, 392 US 236, which involves the issue of whether or not
an officer, a local officer, whose duty is sworn to uphold
the constitution—
QUESTION:

But here you have no individuals

listed as—-it's just the County of Los Angeles.
MRc CLARKs

Well, Your Honor, it seemed to me

anomalous to--on the fact that I foolishly stipulated out
the assessor's name, because it was not required by State
statute, to say that -the people involved do not have standing

27
to raise constitutional issues, ■ even when that has been
recognised specifically by the State legislature, which I
recognise that you are telling me that under Doremus would
be irrelevant.
But ray feeling is, Mr. Jxistice Rehnquist, that the
whole idea of the Board of Education v. Allen does stand for
the proposition that v;hen the officer is sworn to uphold the
constitution, and makes that decision, that I believe the
entity which is sued for the repayment of taxes, and
certainly there are individuals involved, and certainly the
assessor is going to comply with whatever decision comes
down, and the tax collector and all the other individuals
involved will do so as well; that they are so intimately
wound up, as the Court of Appeals has determined, with the
entity being sued itself, that the entity is entitled to
raise that particular issue.
The basic issue on the merits is whether the
states can regulate imports.

There are three reasons why we

believe this to be improper»
We believe that Section 225 impinges on the area of
free trade, which was defined by this Court in Boston Stock
Eachange v» State Tax Commission.
We believe that it invades the area of the
Federal exclusive right to regulate imports, not only to
insure their uniformity, and—but also to, as this Court said

23
in Board of Trustees v. U.S., describe the extent to which
the tariff regulations go? that precise extent,,
And also,. 225 we believe to be precluded by the
Tariff Acts.
The petitioner suggests different issues, in
essence.

He suggests that there are, quote, no facts.

The

Court of Appeals accepted the petitioner's request that this
statute have a broad interpretation; and yet the petitioner
seeks to avoid the arabit of that broad interpretation as
described and found by the Court of Appeals.
The first answer to the petitioner's contention is
that American Oil applies, pure and simple.
The second answer is that there are facts in this
particular case which show that Section 225 yields
non-conformity in tariff regulations.

Goods which derive

from the same manufacturer, which are held after the same
foreign commerce, and which are held in the sane warehouse,
but which are eventually sold to a Phoenix customer, are
treated differently for their temporary storage than if
they go to a Sacramento customer.
225 tells the foreign manufacturer, ,:I£ you are
lucky enough to sell to somebody in Phoenix, you're in great
shape.

But if you're unlucky enough to sell to somebody in

Sacramento, you lose.
We

I'm sorry."

paint this picture because of the conditions in

29

Section 225, which reach beyond the California border, and
encourage and discourage certain activities in foreign
countries, and in other States, merely on the basis of their
temporary presence in the taxing jurisdiction.
On the export side, we tell a Pittsburgh manufacturer
via Section 225 who brings his goods into the State for sale,
or who may bring those goods into the State, or who is think­
ing about bringing those goods into the State, that if he
sells to a foreign customer, that's fine; he will not be
taxed on the basis of that temporary presence in the State;
but if he sells to an Hawaiian customer, he loses.
Section 225 thereby creates a pricing regulation
for the interstate customer of foreign and interstate goods,
end also, imposes a regulation on that Pittsburgh manufacturer
who is thinking of bringing his goods into the State for
temporary storage.
It says, in essence, we’re going to treat these
things separate simply because it’s within, our power to do
so.
Now, the petitioners have suggested that this is
all saved for various reasons. They suggest that they can
avoid the appellate court finding, because the appellate
court finding doesn't apply to Sears; that

the appellate

court should have found the statute constitutional as to
Sears, but unconstitutional as to 2 Toys, because 2 Toys

30

did have the facts with regard to distribution.

This case

was consolidated below without objection, and the Court of
Appeals found that the ambit of the statute—and defined it.
Now the petitioner seeks to avoid that ambit, even though
it asserted that it could go forward with the broad
interpretation.
The idea, then, of validating Section 225 because
it prefers foreign goods over interstate goods, is to my
way of thinking, equally invalid.

It is invalid because

Section 225 distinguishes between foreign goods; it does not
even support all foreign goods.

Any product which is brought

into the State of California from Japan, which is quote
manufactured, and I respectfully direct the attention of the
Court to th@ definition of manufacturing, or the exemption—
or the exception to the definition of manufacturing in
Section 225, which in essence states that if you can label
those goods in California, and they will not be taxable, but
you paint them and they will be taxable, even though they
arrive at the same interstate customer’s location; even
though they are produced in the beginning by the same foreign
manufacturer? and even though they are brought into the
State by the same method of transportation.
QUESTION:

Well, let’s assume all that were true.

What about these goods?
MRo CLARK:

These goods, Your Honor, have—

31

QUESTION:

Because-—-why do you say the exemption was

unconstitutional with respect to these goods"
MRo CLARK:

Well, Your Honor, the particular goods

which are the subject of the stipulation involve two classes
of goods.

One class were those that were broxight in from a

foreign manufacturer, held in the State, and eventually
sold to foreign customers-~not foreign customers, but
customers out of state.
The other class of goods, which the petitioner does
not claim the exemption for, are a class of goods which were
brought into the state from foreign manufacturers and
held in Los Angeles, but fox' a Sacramento shipment.
And at that particular time, I think that the peti­
tioner did not even know whether or not those goods were
going to be sold to that Sacramento customer, or to the
Arizona customer.
QUESTION:

The transshipped goods are exempt.- in­

state goods are not?
MRo CLARK:
QUESTION:

Transshipped-Well, I mean the goods that are shipped

out.
MRo CLARK:

QUESTIONS

Well

,

the exemption—does the exemption

purport to cover both of these classes of goods'’
MR. CLARK:
QUESTION:
MR. CLARK:

No, sir.
No.
No, it distinguishes between them, and

it also distinguishes between the in-state—
QUESTION:
MR. CLARK:

Is that the vice of it you think, or not?
Well, I think that's one of the vices of

it, because it makes the tariffs—in essence, it gives a
tariff rebate to one set of foreign goods and doesn't give
it to another.

And I think that can be reached from the

stipulated facts.
If American Oil does not apply, if the language of
the statute is not seen in and of itself—that these
extra-territorial conditions are not seen in and of themselves
as an invasion of free trade (Boston Stock Exchange), and if
it is not seen as a deprivation of the Federal government's
right to regulate imports (Board of Trustees v, Illinois) ,
and if it is not seen as a conflict with the Tariff Jets,
then the stipulated facts do support the distinction that is
made between foreign goods, which makes them un-uniform,
which is contrary to the Tariff Act.
And as we pointed out in our brief, there's a
specific section which requires uniformity of tariffs.
I do not believe that we can one way suggest, as the

33
Federal government has suggested here, that because the
Federal government’s current policy is to help certain foreign
interests, that is , the airplane flights, that suddenly all
States can enact this same kind of exemption that cuts
across these same lines.
What that does is effectively open the doors to
any interest groups supporting foreign manufacturers, and close
them to our own domestic manufacturers, because the
Solicitor General has also suggested that any regulation which
hurts foreign commerce is a bad thing.
We can't do that, I think, and still retain the
kind of ability that this country has to have a system which
is uniform, a system which operates on perhaps the kinds of
goods differently; that is, if we say we have a timber
exemption, or a different rate for cattle, as Wisconsin does
for different kinds of goods, those statutes on their face
do not cut across these lines.
But Section 225, and its extra-territorial
conditions, do.

On its face, in the context of Article XIII,

Section 1, of the State constitution, which requires all
property in the State to be faxed, those selective encourage­
ments and discouragements of foreign and interstate activity
operate as inhibitions.

And I respectfully refer the Court

to footnote 13 of the Boston. Stock Exchange opinion, which
talks about those particular kinds of inhibiting effects of

34
State taxes.
The language itself of this statute directs—actually
cuts against the Federal government's ability to determine the
extent to which tariff regulations act.
Are we assume—is one to assume, I ask rhetorically-—
whether—that the Federal government, once a tariff is
imposed, simply lets it go'3

That the regulation does not

go into effect?
QUESTION:

Well, you’re not-—are you really suggest­

ing that the exemption is inconsistent with, or frustrates,
any statutory enactment of Congress?
MRo CLARK:
QUESTION:
MR0 CLARK:

Yes, Your Honor.
Well—
I believe that the exemption by its

own conditions, and referring to the Tariff Act which we have
cited in our brief, in essence mandates almost as broadly as the
Tariff Acts themselves, a rebate of tariffs which have been
paid, insofar---and the Court of Appeals found the distinction
between interstate and foreign goods.
QUESTION:

Yes, well I take it that the Repre­

sentatives of the United States disagree with you in that
respect?
MRo CLARK:

I believe they do, Your Honor, although

I'm not—
QUESTION:

But that doesn't-—I agree, that doesn't

35
answer the natter.
/

I'lRo CLARE:

Well, if I may, Your Honor, for just a

moment.
The basis for the argument that the Federal
government has made here, that the inconsistency—that there
is no inconsistency with the tariff laws, is that the Congress
is aware of the patchwork of State taxation, and Congress
would have acted if they didn't; and the Court was directed-—
QUESTION:

Yes, but they argue that there's no

inconsistency between this exemption and the tariff laws.
MRo CLARK:

Well, Your Honor, they do that on the

basis that I have stated.
there is no inconsistency.

They say—-first of all, they say
Then they say, Congress would

have acted if there were.
QUESTION:

Well, assume there's no inconsistency;

then that should be the end of the matter.

They don't need

to have a second reason.
MR. CLARK:

Well, Your Honor, I think they used that

second argument as a support for the first.
QUESTION;

Yes, well maybe—-let's assume we

disagreed with you on this—in this respect, that the exemption
is not inconsistent with any statutory enactment of Congress.
Then your argument is that the Commerce Clause itself,
invalidates this exemption; is that it?
MR* CLARK:

That the commerce clause itself--

36

QUESTIONs
MRo CLARK:
QUESTION:

Invalidates the injunction?
Yes, Your Honor.
--on sane kind of commerce, several

kinds of commerce.
MRo CLARK:
Your Honor.

Well, not necessarily with a burden,

But—

QUESTION:
MRo CLARK:

It's discrimination.
That is true, and also, Your Honor,

that; because it effectively rebates tariffs in an area where
the President is empowered to protect domestic goods, that it
takes away from the Presidential power to protect those
goods.
QUESTION:
MRo CLARK:

I’m assuming we disagree with you on that.
I’m sorry.

I was tryinrr to separate

out, if I may, Your Honor, the idea of a specific conflict
with the Tariff Acts, and the exclusive right of the Federal
government to regulate imports.
QUESTION:

Well, I would say that would just be a

frustration of the Federal law, and I will assume that out;
assume that, out of the case.

Then yours is a straight commerce

clause argument.
MRo CLARK:

Well, yes, sir.

Although I do believe

the exclusivity argument is also under the commerce clause

area.
QUESTION:

Yes

37
Milo CLARK:

'That we believe that Boston Stock

Exchange applies here.

We believe that because it cuts against

the types of commerce; it cuts between types of foreign
commerce? between types of interstate commerce, particularly
on the export side; and between foreign and interstate
commerce.
QUESTION;

Mr. Clark, did the Court of Appeals

rely on any cutting between different kinds of foreign
commerce?
MRo CLARK:
QUEST ION :

The Court of AppealSY­
I thought it just considered there to be

a discrimination between foreign as a class, and all
interstate as a class.
MR. CLARK:

Yes, Mr. Justice Stevens, it did dwell

on that particular point.

During oral argument, we attempted--

or the petitioner attempted to deal with the export side, and
the Justice which was basically the author of the opinion
said that he felt that it would be clearer if they went
for one particular side of the issue.
QUESTION;

And that's what your case rests on, just

one—’didn*t go into yotir distinction, for example, between
shipments to Phoenix and shipments to Sacramento?
MRo CLARK:

No, Your Honor, it did not.

I think that the third issue that is raised by the
petitioners here, and also by the Solicitor General, is that

33

the statutes of other States have the effect of validating
Section 225.
New Hampshire,

This, of course, is I think improper.

Austin v.

420 US 656, I think stands for the proposition

that this Court will not take another state's statutes,
another state's statute, and attempt to validate a first
state's statute on the ground that the other one exists or
is interpreted in any particular way.
In fact, these other State statutes show how the
job can be done with less impact on interstate aid foreign
commerce.

These other States—-the New York statute referred

to by the Solicitor General, the Louisiana statutes that were
referred to by the Solicitor General, the eight statutes that
we pointed out in our brief—-show how the extra-territorial
effect can be avoided? that is, the way that California
eventually determined that it would be avoided? that is,
by exempting all inventories or all personal property in the
jurisdiction.
California's new exemption does not create the
selective barriers? does not present the picture to the
interstate manufacturer.
QUESTION:

It's the foreign manufacturer—

I take it your argument, then, domestically

assume thatthe city—assume that Cook County in Chicago said,
we tax inventories that are located here, on a certain date,
except the following, and one of them they list is, inventories
that are here that have come from out of State and are going to

3D
be shipped out within two weeks, or—goods that are destined
to go elsewhere out of the State.
I suppose you would say that was a burden on
commerce?
MR0 CLARK:

I think that it does not create the

foreign-interestate distinction.
QUESTION:

I know, but it certainly creates a.

distinction between goods from out of State that are going to
be shipped—chat are going to be sold locally, and goods
that are going to foe transshipped„
MRo CLARK:
QUESTION:

That is —
That’s certainly one of your arguments.

That certainly is one of your arguments here.
MR0 CLARK:

Well, I think that one of our arguments,

Mr. Justice White, is the idea that those kinds of statutes
do not create the same degree of problems that Section 225.
And yes, there are a whole string of statutes which raise
from 225 over here on the left side, as showing the foreigninterstate dichotomy, to the eight statutes that we presented
in our brief which, in effect, only tax goods which are being
shipped from one point in the state to another point in the
state? and down to the Louisiana, New York statutes.
Yes, there is a spectrum? and yes, there is a
spectrum of burden.

Our position is that 225, because it

does practically everything, and does it the wrong way, is

40

improper and unconsitutional*
We take the position that Section 225 reaches out
beyond the State borders like none of these other statutes
do, and encourage between out-of-state activity.
QUESTION: Yes, but you've got to argue in this
case that the exemption is invalid because of the goods—
Sears goods that are shipped out of the State, or exempt
under this exemption, and the ones that are destined for
Sacramento are not.
MRp CLARK:
QUESTION:

Well, Your Honor, if the Court—
Those are the only goods that are involved

here.
MRo CLARK:
QUESTION:
MRo CLARK:

If the Court of Appeals—
Is that right or not0
Well, no, Your Honor, because we believe

that the Court of Appeals determination—we agree that that
is one of the issues; and we agree that the statute is
unconstitutional.
QUESTION:
here?

Well, why—is there any broader issue

Because these are the only goods that are here.
MRo CLARK:

The Court of Appeals defemined the

ambit of the statute as creating a distinction between foreign
and interstate goods.

That statute was described by the

Court of Appeals—
QUESTION:

You can't challenge it on its face.

You

41
have to challenge it on the basis of the goods of your
client.
QUESTION:
MR0 CLARK:
QUESTION:

Not your client.
Which is not ray client, right.
Well, of the goods which you seek to

tax, or which you have had refund proceedings with respect to.
MRo CLARK:

Well, right, Your Honor.

And we did that

before th«s Court of Appeals, and on the basis of those
particular goods and those parfcicxilar facts, the Court of
Appeals determined the arabit of the statute.
And we believe that that ambit is improper, as did
the Court of Appeals.
*

QUESTION:

So that the Court of Appeals preferred

position was that any exemption for goods originating abroad
is just a discrimination—
MRo CLARK:
QUESTION:
MRS CLARK:
QUESTION:
MRo CLARK:

I think—
—against domestic commerce.
That was the Court of Appeals—
Yes.
—decision that when those goods go

out of State as well; in other words, whan we have an inter­
state shipment, and a foreign commerce—and a foreign
shipment, which eventually go out of State, the Court of
Appeals held that 225 operates to distinguish between those
two; that in essence it distinguishes between those two

42

branches of commerce; that distinguishing between those
two branches of cornierce is improper; and that that, we believe,
is supported by American Oil, and by the idea that the
Court of Appeals made, as part of the broad interpretation
which was supported and urged by the petitioner, that-—
QUESTION:

Well, do you think the California Court

of Appeals would have rendered a similar decision, even if
declaratory relief, if the issues had been framed in terms
that 12 months of now the County of Los Angeles was going to
assess these goods and the owners were going to refuse to pay
it?
MRo CLARK;

I'm sorry, I do not really understand

the question,
QUESTION:

What I'm trying to get at is how free

does your Court of Appeals feel to render declaratory relief
or injunctions just on construction of statutes in the
abstract without regard to what may have happened or mwhafc
may have been done by the parties before them?
MR0 CLARK:

I'm sorry, Your Honor1, I thought—-before

the Court of Appeal, Your Honor, there were facts that that
interstate commerce did exist; that interstate commerce is
being brought through the State for distribution purposes to
other States.

And that was part of the Z Toys facts which

were consolidated with this case without objection.

That the

Court: of Appeals had before it facts contrarv to petitioner5 s

43
assertion that they have no facts.

They had facts x-zith

regard to that interstate shipment, the same facts, in essence,
that we show by our Appendix B; that in essence, there are
goods which are brought into the State from other States
for regional distribution.
Thank you.
MRe CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You have four minutes

left, Mr. Garb.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW Se GARB, ES0o ,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MRo GARB:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

I would like to make a couple of comments concerning
the repeal of the California inventory tax that we pointed
out in our brief.
First, I would like to point out that this case
continues to have importance to California taxpayers, since
we have a statute which was in effect for four years, and we
have a four-year period within which to bring claims for
refund in California.

The outcome of this case is of great

importance to California taxpayers.
In addition, since the respondents have taken the
position here that statutes are invalid that exempt locally,
but to fail to exempt, locally manufactured goods, as
respondents have now argued., and have argued in their briefs,
since none of the other 36 States that have free port laws

exempt locally manufactured goods sold in the State, the
outcome of the constitutional issue

asserted by respondents

in this case, is of major importance to the statutes of those
other 36 States as well.
With respect to this pending refund statute, as we
pointed out in our brief, the California constitution has a
doctrine that prohibits the legislature from enacting a
statute which constitutes a gift of public funds.

And in

a long series of cases, dating back to the last century,
cited in our brief, that constitutional provision has been
applied with respect to accrued tax liabilities.
For that reason it appears very likely that any
attempt to refund taxes, if indeed this—the decision of the
Court of Appeals is upheld, would violate the California
constitution.
I am advised that the State of Utah had a similar
situation in which a refund was attempted after the repeal
of a tax law.

And there, as well, the repeal—after the

repeal, the refund was held to be beyond the power of the
State.
1 would like to move for a moment to the uniformity
argument mentioned by respondents in aoral argument.

And

I think we have a bit of confusion here, because what the
Constitution requires is uniformity of tariff rates.

The

respondents have somehow twisted that constitutional requirement

45
of uniform tariff rates to suggest that State property taxes
have to be uniform.
And yet we know that, even though we have uniform
tariff rates, we have different State property tax laws that
obvi.ously are going to have a different impact on imported
goods and domestic goods as well.

And accordingly, the

suggestion that, there’s a constitutional requirement of
uniformity in tariffs simply cannot be stretched to suggest
the requirement of uniform State property tax laws.
Next, I would like to make a comment again on this
argument that Section 225 constitutes a rebate of tariffs.
Ne're already, in my opening, given about three reasons why
this is invalid, and a fourth one comes to mind.
In fact, when the Tariff Acts that counsel has now
stated he relies upon were enacted, goods of substantially
the same type as those involved in this case were immune
from State taxation under the original package doctrine.
When Section 225 was enacted, it preserved the
nontaxafole status of these very goods; and accordingly, when
Congress set the level of protection that it intended to
create for domestic manufacturing, that same level of
protection was perpetuated precisely by Section 225.
So for that reason as well, the major premise of
respondent's argument on this supposed tariff reduction is
simply erroneous.

.tod as I listened to the oral arguments of
respondents, and heard the extension to which their argument
is now taken, that the commerce clause should even invalidate
State laws that do not exempt locally manufactured goods
sold locally, it strikes,me, first of all, that that runs
counter to Allied Stores of Ohio v. Bowers, which validated
such treatment on equal protection grounds; and Alaska, v.
Arctic Maid, which permitted a State to tax locally
competing industries more onerously than interstate competing
industry.
But in addition, it probably does suggest, as
.Mro Justice White was questioning me in my opening, that
where you have a party who is contending—a tax collecting
agent who is contending that, the proper way to handle this
is to exempt more goods, it seems

very likely that you may

not have a case or controversy at that point.
Thank you very much.
MRo CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:34 o'clock, a.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.)
