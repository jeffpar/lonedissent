MR. FXSCHHM:

I am Beraus Pischaan, of Houston, Texas*

for the petitioner* Navarro Savings.

Tour Honors, certiorari was g:,.antri i .. thus case
to review a decision of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth
Circuit which held that the citizenship of a Massachusetts
business trust, in this case a real estate investmenttrust, was that of each of its trustees as opposed to its
it

sona® 91,500 beneficial shareholders.
The petitioner believe® that the ease, although
one- of first impression on the narrow point now before
this Court, that is as to a real estate isr/sati-aunt trust
is a particular species of business organisation. asi’aough

it is a case of first impression, that it is tfe/fl governed

QUESTION: They don’t purport to govern diversi
jurisdiction, do they?
HR. FISCHMAN:

No, Yoi

Honor.

The Morrisaay

case is addressed particularly i

the statutior•y construe

tion of the Internal Revenue Act

but I thin a careful

reading of the case — and we say this in our brief
brier —
the ease does not confine itself to a;plication on tme
nan ow ifwjue of shut Is this entity for purposes ox the
Internal Revenue Code.

What it does say ..s mris encicy

is a business trust and we will treat it as a ich inci­
dentally for tax purposes.
QUESTION:

My question eras not so much that

the Morrissey case may not have relieo on ti e Intssina-t.
Revenue Code but that perhaps it may have been wrong in
relying on the Internal Revenue toue.

e -3v »*«•» *-

diversity jurisdiction in falny carer.iuxv --.e.. r.nscl

,jiu Lj-

di.ction in the federal courts, why go to the xncefa^x

Revenue Code?
MR. PISCHMAN:

1 'don’t believe we are looking

to the Internal Revenue Code, Your Honor, to determine
Where the jurisdiction lies,

AS we say in the brief, it

is really a two-point analysis*

All Morrissey says is

this entity is a business association.

Je are not going

to treat it as a conventional trust" because it has the
features of continuity or perhaps perpetual life, it has
the features of transferability of interest, it is an
active on-going business organisation that has the object
of making money and distributing the gains to the benefici
interest holders.

It is not a trust.

That is all that we

say Morrissey holds»
To find out where the jurisdiction lies, one
must then look to the Bouligny case which is in itself
only the natural outcropping of its antecedents of the
prior decisions of this Court in Chapman v. Barney in
1807, I believe, a decision of this Court in which it was
held as a matter of notice by the Court.; as Opposed to
anything that was suggested by either of the parties in
their briefs, that the Circuit

Court at that v ■- v:v uxu

i

not have jurisdiction because the entity ahere is callet
an express company, it was in essence & joint stock
association and therefore, as has been characterized, a
mere partnership., and the Court said we must look to the

citizenship

of each of the constitue:it members of this

entity that have aggregated themselves for the purposes :f
conducting business.
The nest case to come along wa3 the
QUESTION:

You are talking about the 1887 case

now?
MR. PISCHMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, lour Honor.

Do you think the changes in modes

of doing business from that time to this has anything to
do with how this case should be viewed?
MR. PISCHMAN:

None whatever3 Mr. Chief Justice.

We believe that the basic principle is one that adheres
from the earliest concepts of our sys- em of federalism
which is that ordinarily tnese cases belong in the stab:;
courts, and this was pointed out in the Carlsfcerg de­
cision which we have cited in our brief, that this
federalism concept that says those caves

belong In the

state courts unless there is a good reason they belong a.n
the federal courts.
If you go bask to the problems that this Court
the antecedents that this Court had in wrenching with the
decision of what to do with corporations, they were
artificial persons, they had no citizenship of their own,
So originally, in Bank v. Deveaux the Court said we are
not going to treat them as an entity, we are going to

(
look to the citizenship.

The Court then reversed itself

in the next case, and then finally in the Marshall v,
Baltimore ft Ohio ease, the Court said, all right, we are
going to treat this entity as being comprised of its in­
dividual shareholders, its beneficial interest holders,
but we are going to indulge in the fiction that all of
these people reside in the state of incorporation, and
this persisted until the 195.8 amendments to the Judicial
Code which said we are now going to codify that fiction9
but there has been no other effort on the part of Congress
to recognise real estate investment trusts, limited
partnerships, joint stock associations, or other forms of
unincorporated associations .•
QUESTION:

But what you have just said sug­

gests at- least to me that over the last century the varying
modes of business and practices have been reflected in
decisions of the courts.
MR. FISCHMAN:

This is true. Your Honor, but

if we look to the Bouligny case we find that a labor
union is certainly a type of entity that I don't believe
existed in any great quantity during the early part of
the development of this country.

The labor unions became

strong really as entities at the beginning of this century.

In the Bouligny case, this Court said, speaking
through Mr. Justice Fortas, that we will not extend this

rule to comprehend the labor unionss we will not indulge
in the same fiction for the labor union that we have in­
dulged in in the corporation, and the Court could conven­
iently say that I think because at that time the corpora­
tion had been treated by Congress, ana this is why the
opinion says that pleas for extension of the diversity
jurisdiction should be addressed to the Congress, and I
think that is what the respondents have argued here in
part of their brief.

We finally get down to it and they

sa.y this is what the rule ought to be, this Court should
create a fictional citizenship for this one particular
type of entity, as Massachusetts business trust.
QUESTION:

But wouldn't you agree too that

pleas for contraction of diversity jurisdiction should
be addressed to Congress?
MR. FISCHMAN: I don't believe that it would
represent a contraction, four Honor, Hr. Justice Reh'nquiat
because the rule traditionally has been that it must be
the citizenship of the individual person and not an
aggregation of persons.

I don't believe .it is contracting

the federal jurisdiction, the diversity jurisdiction of
the federal district courts.
QUESTION:

I take it you think this decision

expanded it»
MR. FISCHMAN:

I think unquestionably, Your

Honor.

For example, the Carlsberg court treated — this

was a Third Circuit decision and the Garisherg court sale
that it would in fact be expansive of the jurisdiction.
The court says -QUESTION:

Is there Circuit Court case against

you?
Mil. FISCHMAN:
QUESTION:

Ho —

Except one I can think of?

MR* FISCHMAN:

— the instant ease.

There are

other cases, Your Honor, and we have —
QUESTION:

How about the Second Circuit?

MR. FISCHMAN:

The Second Circuit has not

ruled directly on this issue.

The Second Circuit con­

cerned itself with the case called Colonial Realty v. Barhe
& Company.

New, that ease did not deal with the

Massachusetts business trust, it dealt with a limited
partnership*

Now —

QUESTION:

But it gave the limited partnership

a separate existence, didrrt it?
MR. FISCHMAN:
QUESTION:

It did, Your Honor, and it • -

And traditionally that >: >ul-:I hare

been subject to the Individual membership rule?
MR. FISCHMAN:

It should have been and arguably

that case
QUESTION:

That was an expansion of Jurisdiction.,

10
too, you think?
MR. FISCHM&N:

We believe clearly it was.

The

Colonial Realty v. Bach® case has been extensively criti­
cized In the decision of the Third Circuit in the
G&rlsberg courts Carlsberg v. Cambria Savings 1 Loan.
How, that case likewise involved a limited partnership.
And what the Court said is we are unwilling to engraft
upon conditional diversity principles the provisions of
Rule 1? to determine diversitys to determine the citizen­
ship of the parties*

Rule 17. if it does do that, then

perhaps it conflicts with Rule 82.

Under the construction

that the respondents have argued for, Rule 17 would become
in effect a «jurisdictional rule as opposed to one that
merely determines the capacity of the party, and I think
that is what Rule IT was directed at„
It seems that the respondents hav's sort of put
the cart before the horse,

They are saying let as look

to Rule 17 to determine where the .jurisdiction is ani then
we will see if there is diversity.

It doesn't make sense*

and this is what the Court in Carlsberg looked at.

And as

the respondents concede in their brief, there really is no
practical difference between the limited partnership and
the real estate investment trust.
Now, I would like to turn for just a moment and
discuss the cases that were cited extensively by the

respondent, the several lines of cases, Dodge v. Tulleye
Wyoming & Susquehanna Railroad v. Blatehford, ami —
QUESTION:

Well, if we had. taken the Second

Circuit case and affirmed it, I suppose you probably
wouldn’t even be here,
MR, FISCKMAN:

Well, of course we are here,

Your Honor, with all due respect because the Court granted
certiorari and —
QUESTION:
titioned.

I know, but you might; not have pe­

If we had previously agree:' with the 'Second

Circuit in the limited partnership case, would that have
ruled this case, do you think?
MR. FISCHMAN:

It certainly would have a telling

effect upon it,
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. FISCHMAN:

It certainly would.

I don’t

know that the Court will see any distinction between the
Second Circuit case and this case.

I honestly don’t see

any distinction between the limited partnership Hid the
real estate investment trust„

They all have continuity

of interest, they all have a body of shareholders who
have delegate!, to a group of trustees, curators, managers,
directors, whatever you would call thorn, the managerial
duties of their entity, but it doesn’t charge the basic
fact that they are the real parties in interest In this

the correct way to approach the case.
QUESTION:

For ail practical purposes, what do

you regard as the differences between a corporation with
directors and 9 ,500 stockholders and this situation?
Practical* now.
MR. FISCHMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, I don't thin!:

there; are any practical distinctions In the two»
QUESTION:

That Is what the Fifth Circuit seemed

to think, wasn't it?
ME. FISCHMAN:

X think that it nay fee correct,

Mr* Chief Justice, but I think what they are doing then
is they are engrafting or they are establishing there a
whole new species of quasi-corporation, If you will, into
the diversity jurisdiction,
QUESTION:

That has been, going on over the last-

hundred years, hasn't it, to some extent?
MR. FISCHMAN:

I think the decisions of this

Court, Mr. Chief Justice, show that when It has reached
this Court, the Court has held that the citizenship of
the unincorporated association is that of its members.
I think to say otherwise- is to in effect overrule Bouligny
at least implicitly, and created for the labor union, ior
example, <3. foras of second class citizenship.

I isn't

really see- any distinction between the modern labor uni.0.1

13
aed the modern business trust,

They i.n both comprised of

aggregates of people, of citizenss of live human beings
whcr come together under one banner for the purpose of de­
ducting their business and accruing gains or benefits tc
the parties.
QUESTION:

There is one difference I suppose

with the Union, is that for most of Its litigations not
every case s because Bouligny teaches to the contrary,
most of its litigation probably has a federal question
that it can assert when it sues an employer under a
federal statute.

There isn’t an awful lot of litigation

with unions that is based on diversity * is there.- in the
federal courts ?
MH. FISCHKAN:

I am really not prepared to

answer that, Mr. Justice Stevens.

I could only say this:

In the Bouligny case the .issue involved libel brought by
the company against the union which was clearly a state
created right —
QUESTION:

That * s right.

MR. F1SCHMAN:

—» and clearly belonged in the

state unless there was some bona fide basis for it.
I want to respond briefly to the cases that lea.]
with trusts.

Several of these cases were cited and I

think are distinguiable on the fact that all of the parsc.es
did in fact have diverse citizenship even including the

beneficial interest holders and including the trustees„
That is the case of Dodge v. Talleys
of Cisco.

:nd Bullarcl v. City

In those cases which are rolled upon by the

trustees in this case, you already had diversity anyway
and I don't thirds that the points wade in those oases .ar-o
necessary for the decision that was ultimately ow.-le.
In the Wyoming £ Susquehanna v, Blafcablord case»
the Court held there was no jurisdiction because the
trustee in the case did have the same citizenship as one
of the defendants!

They were both residents of

So I don’t know how much those eases

furnish a dichotomy between the line of cases of Bouligjny *
Chapman v. Barney. Great Southern Fireproof Hotel* which
was a ease that involved, a limited partnership which was
decided by this Court* and as nearly as 1 can see squarouy
conflicts with the Second Circuit cauo which this Court

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. ELLIS, JR., ESQ.,
OM BEHALF OF THE RESPOMDEMTS
KFt., ELLIS:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

First, I must disagree with my Xearned colleague
as to the essence of the holding of the Fifth Circuit *

T

is my reading of the decision by the Fifth Circuit that
the individual plaintiffs who allege chat they ware
trustees of a business trust were the real parties in
interest and that it was their citizenship that governed
the question of diversity of citizenship jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

That is the test you are proposing,

real party in interest?
MR. ELLIS:

That is I believe the essence of

the tests that's corrects Your Honor.

Like Mr. Morrissey

ease in the Morrissey case, the plaintiffs in this ease
were trustees of an express trust.

The long line of de­

cisions that Eire cited In the briefs by both sides hold
two basic premises that I think are essential to the
analysis of this ease.
Those cited by Mru Fiseiuasn on behalf of his
clients, including Chapman v. Barney and Marshall y.
Baltimore & Ohio Rail Road, and the Boullgny case all
I

i

stand for this proposition, that an unincorporated group

•.of individuals that by state law or otherwise have tne
:

right to sue In a Joint name are nevertheless

I

joint name is nevertheless not a citizen.

that

Citizenship

is a status that is attributed only to flesh and blood
individuals♦

And when there is a suit in a Joint name,

16
it becomes incumbent upon the court to determine who really
are the flesh and blood individuals that are suing in that
name»
The eases which we cited I think hold to the
proposition that when a suit is brought in the name of a
trustee for the benefit of the beneficiary» really and
truly then it is the citizenship of the plaintiff» the
trustee and not the citizenship of the beneficiary that
governs the question of diversity jurisdiction*
Only when it is a non-personal suit, that is a
suit by ah entity or in the joint name of several in­
dividuals do wa have the question that counsel poses and
that is trying to determine the citizenship of that name
or that entity.
To analyse this case, we think it is important
that the Court consider the basic purpose of the diversity
jurisdiction.

Mr, Chief Justice Marshall early in this

Court's history commented that the drafters of the
Constitution either had apprehension as. to the impartiality
of. the state courts or at least viewed with indulgence
the possible fears and apprehensions in that regard that
suitors might have.
The purpose of the diversity jurisdiction is to
provide a device to give some protection against local
prejudice.

Another kind of prejudice that 3s — prejudice

:'.3 a subject that this Court deals with in many ways,

Qt

course, this is not prejudice based on race, religion or
sex but it is prejudice against united States citizens
based upon their domicile, their citizenship in a state
other than the state of the opposing party, the state

d. ELLIS:

I*m sorry, I didn't understand the

question,
QUESTION:

You wouldn't have that in Texas,

would you?
MR» ELLIS:

Your Honor, I must say that there

is that apprehension among some litigants in Texas and I
suspect in most of the other states also.

I must say that

that was one of the reasons that this case was brought la­
the federal court rather than the state court-

Whether it

is true or not, no one will know, but the apprehension of
local prejudice is one of the motivating factors for bring­
ing the suit in federal court.
QUESTION:
the same jury?

What difference is there,, you would
You would get. the same people on the

Your Honor. I disagree with that

In the federal court in Dallas, the juries are selected

In the state

court — of course. in Arkana County, where venue would
have been placed

In

would have been selected only out of that rural county and

Of course. there was no trial in this ease„

It

'will be incumbent upon the plaintiff upon remand to prov,
that they are entitled to the relief they seek* including
that they are entitled to receive that relief in their
capacity as trustees»
There was no challenge in the trial court that
the plaintiffs3 the individual trustees here lacked
capacity to sue, there was no challenge that they were
not the real parties in interest, there was no challenge
that any of the 9,500 beneficial shareholders wares neces­
sary or indispensable parties to the lawsuit.

There was

.no challenge that there was any improper joinder of
plaintiffs or collusion or any other improper device to
create diversity jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

I assume all the trustees are. share­

holders .
MR, ELLIS;

It is alleged that three of the

eight are shareholders.
The trial court dismissed the case apparently
by following this argument;

Premise number one, this is

a suit by the trust rather than by the individual plain­
tiff trustees.

We disagree strongly with that, and the

Court of Appeals,, of course, held very specifically that
the trust was not a party to the lawsuit, it was tl*.o in­
dividual trustees who were the plaintiffs.

But premiss

number one is that this is a suit by the trust.
Preraise number two is that the trust is not a
citizen.

We agree with that.

The trust is not a eitisea,

Premise number three is that we must determine
what the citizenship of that trust is and we conclude that
it is that cf all of the shareholders and therefore it :l
really a suit by 9>500 people who were not involved in the
transaction3 who were not named plaintiffss who have no
involvement in the litigation.

That is the argument we

contend that the trial c ourt *s dismissal of this ease was
based upon, and we think' that it is not correct and that
the Fifth Circuit was correct in reversing.
The- proper analysis we think is this:

Assuming

that we were in error as to premise number one and that
this really ai i truly was a suit by the - rust rather than
by the trustees -QUEST!CM:

When you say "by the trust,/' are you

using the terra "trust" to mean Massachusetts business
trust as opposed to corporation or individual as a usethoa
of doing business?
ME. ELLIS:

I believe that that is the "sense in

which I am using the word.

Of course, a trust is hard to

The general partners.
The general partners, excuse ms,

lour Honor.
QUESTION:

Then the 9,500 o-:;her people who

some sort of interest in the corpus of the trust, they
have no right to manage or convey property or that sort
of thing?
MR. ELLIS:

four Honor, that is correct.

They

have no rights in that regard at all.
QUESTION:

But they do have a right to kick out

the trustees tomorrow if they want,
i

MR. ELLIS:

They do have that right on a

majority vote, that's correct.
QUESTION:

Is that fundamentally different, do

you think, from the right of stockholders to dismiss
directors?
MR. ELLIS:

No, Your Honor, I don't believe it

is fundamentally different.

I believe it is essentially

the same.
The question then Is who

sued in this case.

We think this is the test that ±b moat simple, most basio
and most' correct* who sued,

Who- are the real piaintif fa2

If It is some individuals who sued and if there is no
need for adjustment of the parties by adding; or subtract­
ing parties or realigning the parties, that is if the
people, the individuals who sued are real parties in in­
terest with capacity to sue, then it is their citizenship
that governs and this case we contend is decided by that
principle»
If, ca the other hand, It is a name that sues.
Fidelity Mortgage Investors in this ease, the Court must
determine who it is that lo behind that name, whose
citizenship must govern.

In that regard, we think that

it will he proper to look to the state law and to the
documents establishing that trust or limited partnership
to determine who has the right to sue as between the
beneficiaries and the trustee on the one hand, who can
be sued, who has limited liability, who has unlimited
liability,' who has the right to transact business from
which the controversy arose, who is the agent for whom.
And by looking at those principals, it can be determinet;
that in this ease the real people who sue, even if it
was MI, Fidelity Mortgage Investors who brought the -suit
was the trustees, not the beneficiaries.
The Marshall decision cited by the defendants

court below in fact seemed to isnly or at .least it can h 3
read to imply that even with regard to a corporati or* 3 it
is the directors and officers whose citizenship governs I will be the first to admit that the language of that 1 >eision is not clear when this Court created a conclusive
presumption that a corporation has its citizenship for
diversity purposes in the state of its incorporation.

if

was- not clear whether the Court was presuming the citizen­
ship of the directors and officers, on the one hand5 or
whether it was presuming: the citizenship of the share­
holders on the other»

I believe it can be read either wry.

But if it is read in the former, that is entirely con­
sistent with all of the analysis that we are suggesting
to the Court.
Me think that the analysis that we are request - •
ing the Court to adopt is consistent and

report ive of

the basic purpose of diversity jurisdiction,

Toe bepe-

fieial shareholders in this case will not be reve&Xe’d or
participate or revealed to the cov;?t br to the jury, nor
will they participate as plaintiffs in. the lawsuit.

It

is not realistic we think to hold that they are really
the parties to this lawsuit, that they are really the
parties whose citizenship governs the diversity juris­
diction»
QUESTION*

Did they have anything to say about

:

whether the lawsuit should be brought?
MR. ELMS:
Your Honor,

They have nothing whatsoever to say.

Under the treu.it; doonaenfc. ’:hey have

to participate .in that decision.

do

rigt<

It is the trustees alor.e

who can do that.
The rule that we are suggesting is a s:iap 1,? ei?t
.realistic approach.

It requires no analysis of both the

naturalization and domicile of those 9S500 people who were
uninvolved in this transaction and in this litigation,
fee submit then that the Court of Appeals was correct.
But we have a second position that 1 would
briefly mention, Your Honorefl and that is this, that if
the metaphysical question is decided this way, that it
really is the 9,500 shareholders who are the real parties
here and who should have sued or who should ts the
parties, the three plaintiff individuals who are bene­
ficial shareholders alternatively brought this action as
representatives of all of the other shareholders.

Rule

23.2 of the federal rules specifically provide that as a;
alternative method for creating diversity jurisdiction
when, it is an unincorporated association.
QUESTION:

Mr. Ellis, do the members o:f the

beneficiaries have any rights as individuals?

I»n*t the

right, if it exists, the right In the entity?

How can

you have this a class action?

I am not quite —

29
MR. ELLIS;

Well, Your Hono5

; agree

that the rights of the individual shareholders are the
rights at issue in this lawsuit.
QUESTION:

Then it can’t be a class action on

their behalf, can it?
MR. ELLIS:

That’s correct, it cannot be, if

our assumption is correct.
QUESTION;

Then there .is no merit to your alter­

native argument.
MR. ELLIS:
ment»

Well, there is our alternative argu­

Our primary argument is that if is the trustees

whose citizenship governs, it is the trustees who' are the
real parties.

Our alternative argument —

QUESTION:

If it had any merit., that udvvlrV::.Tt

be your alternative argument, would it?
MR. ELLIS:

Well, Your Honor, we were surprised

when this ease was dismissed.

That is our alternative

argument. We think our major argument is the proper
position to take in the case.
QUESTION:
MR. ELLIS:

What about your federal question?
Again, that is another alternative

argument that we have, and that is that the Court of
Appeals failed — excuse no, the trial court failed to
develop the record or to allow development of the record
before it decided that there was no federal question In

the case.

The Court of Appeals did. not make any determin­

ation of the propriety of that,and we would merely say
that if the Court should conclude here that there is no
diversity of citizenship Jurisdiction in this care,., the
case should at least be remanded to the Fifth Circuit for
determination of the federal question.
QUESTION:

And then what?

MR. ELLIS:

If the Fifth Circuit determines

that there is a federal question alleged in the case,
then it should remand the case for trial and development
of that federal question.
QUESTIOH:

On what, on the federal question or

on some attendant issue?
MR. ELLIS:

It should remand it for a trial on

the issue of which it has jurisdiction, namely the federal
question jurisdiction.

But of course it also has pinned

jurisdiction in that instance to all causes of action
arising out of the same circumstances.
QUESTION:

But the thing you rant tried is

really a pendant issue, isn't it?
MR. ELLIS:

It is pendant to the federal claim,

that5 s correct.
QUESTION:

And so there is some discretion as

to whether to entertain it?
MR* ELLIS:

I don't think there is any

tain it
QUESTION;

What, Jurisdiction over- the federal

question and therefore you must entertain a pendant issue?
MB.. ELLIS;

I believe that that ia corrects

that the court does have pendant jurisdiction over —
QUESTION:
cise it.

Yes , you have it If you want- to exer­

Do you think there is some requirement of It?
QUESTION:

1 thought Gibb said to tku contrary.

MR- ELLIS:
that.

Your Honor, you ;rv bo

I am not familiar with that case

:.,rreofc on

t this vims.

In conclusions we would merely urge the Court
to affirm the Firth Circuit,

We think the reasoning there

is propers correct and practical and reaches a just con­
clusion.
Thank you.
ME. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Fischman, do you

have anything further?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SERNUS VM. FISCHMM, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF TIPS PETITIONER — REBUTTAL
MR. FISCEMAN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice» and

may it please the Court:
It would seem that the primary cuestion that hv.B
developed here is exactly what is Fidelity Mortgage
Investors, is it an entity, Is it an unincorporated

op
association., is it an aggrega txon ox individuals or
what o
"The entity is in fact an unincorporated business
association.

It is not a trust in the traditional sense

of an express trust,

It may call itself one, but if one

reads carefully the declaration of trust in this ease, one
could find that this entity cars, be almost anything it
wants to be because, for example , as pointed out in the
declaration of trust, which is in the appendix to the
briefs, the trust can delegate «— «reuse me, the trustees
have the power to delegate their authority to any one of
their membership, any one of the trustees or —
QUESTION:

That may be so, but short of that

what power does an individual member have?
MR* FXSCHMAN:

The same power, Mr.» Justice,

that ~~*
QUESTION:

He can- vote out the trustees.

MR,. FIS OHMAM:

precisely the same power

which the shareholders of a corporation have, and that is
by whatever the appropriate majority is to vote out the
people that are either defending a lawsuit that they
would like corn remised, 02' to compel the institution of a
lawsuit that they want,

There is absolutely no difference

in terms of the economic functions of a real estate invertmerit trust and the modern corporation or, for that matter.

a limited partnership or a general partnership such is s
Joint stock association.
QUESTION:

But a corporation is a plaintiff or

defendant regardless of who its shareholders or director-::
or officers are.
MR. FISOHMAN:
QUESTION:

Precisely, Mr. Justice.

It is the corporation that is the

party»
MR., FISOHMAN:

Only by original fiat of this

Court and —■
QUESTION:

And no?? by statute,

MR, FZSCKMAN:

And now by statute.

Our whole

point is centered on the fact that this might be &
wonderful argument, It might be Just an absolutely.mag­
nificent idea for real estate investment trusts to have
access to a federal forma, but it :1s up to Congress to make
that determination, as this Court has aptly determined in
the Bouligny ease,
QUESTION:

You would think there is a funda­

mental difference between a labor union and all the other
categories we have been talking about?
MR, FXSCHMAN:

Only in the sense that the labor

union is not organized in the ultimate sense for a finan­
cial profit, but it does have as its goal the distribution
of benefits to its membership.

It is on-going, it has

34
business* it has officers 9 it hstr, members who control
ultimately the decisions of its managers. its president*
its stewards•

3o in that sense there really is no real

difference.
I think if the Court here extends diversity
Jurisdiction in effect and expands it to accommodate the
Massachusetts business trust, you create an infinite
possibility for deceptive practices, if you will* to
create Jurisdiction*

I think that is clearly an issue

which the Court will have to confront.

And I would point-

cut to the Court that this particular lawsuit was not
originally commenced in the federal district court in
the Northern District of Ts:xas*

it was coiaae iced in the

state district court in Dallas* Texas* and only when a
plea of privilege was sustained transferring this case to
the county in which Navarro has its headquarters was the
suit dropped and refiled in the Northern District.
So some of the argument that there is the local,
prejudice doesn't completely ring true.

It was the par­

ticular forum within the state of Texas that the respon­
dents were seeking to invoke»
This Court must consider the Marshall v.
Baltimore & Ohio Rail Road case* where it was dimply
stated that in creating this fiction, we are not going to
disregard the fact that the corporators

and those were

35
in fact the people who were referred to in that opinion.
I can understand counsel’s confusion -xfch that term, but
tha corporators as used in that somewhat quaint or anti­
quated language simply means the shareholders of the
corpora cion, were the ones whose residence would be 'looked
to to determine citizenship for ciira/'arlt^ purposes.
1 would respectfully submit to the Court that
/*•

you must in order to hold diversity jurisdiction in this
case,, you must overrule Marshall v, Baltimore & Ohio Rail
Road, you must implicitly overrule Beullgny and the cases
which are its antecedents, and I think you will do so with
all the attendant risk

that you will increase the liti­

gation which will be filed in federal forums as a .direct
result, of that holding.
I weald also respectfully point out to. the
Court that in this particular case, ter example

of

■'course, it doesn't appear particularly from the record
one way or the other whether all of the trustees of the
Massachusetts business trust are before the court.

But

it should be pointed out that there is no requirement
under the argument which respondents advance that all of
the trustees be before the court„
Supposes for example, they had several trustees
who were residents ©f the state of Texas.

It would he

rather convenient t-o simply ignore their existence and

bring the action in the w of only those trustees who
were non-Texas residents c

And there is nothing in what

the respondents argue that would male© that in effect a
collusive joinder to confer jurisdiction.

It is simply

an omission to bring forward those or::ties who would in
effect destroy the diversity jurisdiction of the federal
court»
The trust eases, the- express trust cases. Dodge

?, Tule fB — first, as we pointed out, we believe, we
respectfully submit are distinguishable.

An express tract

in the sense of a mortgage indenture or In the case of
Bullard to. City of Cisco, you had a bond holders-: cGfcsraitlee
but that bond holders committee was organised for one
limited purpose, and also all of the shareholders! from
a close reading of the case, says that the person» who
elected to join with the bond holders committee, number
one , had citizenship diverse from all of the defendants *
That was the first pointa
Moreover, all of those bond holders who contri­
buted their bonds to the coKiuiitee —~
QUESTION:

Did the signatories of this agreement

give to the trustees the right to file suit?

give it away?

Unquestionably, Mr. Justice.

Nell, how do you retain it after you

MR* FiSCHKAH:

By simply -voting out the trustees.

I mean how can you file a lawsuit?

MR, FISCHMAN:

tion,

You delegated to the trustees the

Why do you

MR- FXSCHM&N:

Do you mean as Individual-.;;?

Yes,

appropriate analysis at all „ have that power siatply .by
removing those trustees.

But they haven't done it.

MR* FISCHMAN:

Mo., thatf s true, they haven t

done it in this ease,
QUESTION:
about, this one

Well, that is the Case I am tailring

MR, FISCHMM:

I understand that, Mr. Justica

Marshallj but 1 believe that the point is that they may do
it and in positing that power in the shareholders, you
make it no different than the shareholders of a corporation,
But the only reason that a shareholder of a corporation
was not a party -*~
QUESTION:

There is another different*, a cor­

poration has & state statute declaring it to he a corpora­
tion and giving it the right to sue mid be sued, but you
don’t add that»
MRa' FISCHMM:

I would respectfully submit that

that means If you then refer the federal court to the lav
of the states to determine federal «Jurisdiction., which I
don’t believe this Court has ever held was properly the
function of the federal forum.

As pointed out in the

Carlsberg case, that .jurisdiction has to appear from the
record itself, it has to to© there to begin with.
Under that particular argument, the only reason
that a corporation has, if you will, a birth certificate
is because the? -state gave It one.

That’s fine, but that

does not change the ultimate fact that the corporation
metaphysically exists only in the contemplation of the
law.

It doesn’t exist, I can’t reach out and touch oho

corporation.

I can only reach out and touch Individuals

who own property and who have

and then ultimately an act of Congress.
