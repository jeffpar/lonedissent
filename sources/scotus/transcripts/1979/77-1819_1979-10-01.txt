PROCEEDINGS
MRe CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 77-1819,. Vaughn v. Vermilion Corporation»
Mr. Hill, you may pros®ad whenever you8re ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN K. HILL, JR,, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. HILL:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court:
This matter involves a system of artificial canale
in extreme southern Louisiana,

Their construction was, begun

in 1942 and it continues fee this moment.

They are generally

60 foet wide by 8 feet in depth, and run from the Gulf
Intracoastal Waterway on the North to fehs Gulf of Mexico on
the Couth, and are—cover an area approximately IE to 20 miles
wide from east to wast.
They are affected by tidal action.

They connect,

among other waterways, with tha Gulf Intracoastal Waterway,
the freshwater Bayou Canal, the : Gulf ©f Mexico, with Vermilion
Bay on the east, and with Oyster Bayou and Rollover Bayou on
the West.
They are, w© believe, navigable in fact, and satisfy
all tests of navigability heretofore put forward by this Court.
As far as, I believe, most of those facts—with the
exception of tha connection to the Gulf—that I've just
recited ar® undisputed between the parties.

It was, however,

4
tha subject of vehement dispute in tha Court below as to
whether or not th© actual building of these canals in fast
impaired and in some cases destroyed the navigability of
pre-existing natural canals in th© area.
Since th® case was disposed in tha trial court on
summary judgment* there was no opportunity for the making of
much of a record on that point.

Nevertheless, the petitioners

submitted an affidavit in opposition to the motion, for
summary judgment that said, for example, that the old Fresh­
b'

water Bayou which coursed from Paean Island, Louis!ana--a small
municipality on a little stretch of terra firma in the middle
of marshland-“-the old Freshwater Bayou coursed from there to
-the Gulf of Mexico, and was used, among ether things, to
transport the United States mail,

The—

QUESTIONS

--what areas we8r® talking about,

MR, HILL?

All right.

The map, if Your Honors please,

was offered by th® Vermilion Corporation with our consent.

Th@

only general deficiency of th© map is that it does not, so far
as I know, show absolutely the entirety of tha canal system.
The bottom ©f tha photograph, of course, is the Gulf
©f Mexico,

Th® most—

5

QUESTION %

Welly where g©n«rally is the land area that

we're talking about?
MR. HILL:

Yes, Your Honor.

Th© most prominent

waterway coursing northerly from th® Gulf is on th® east, or
right side, of th© photograph, and that is Freshwater Bayou.
The most prominent entrance of the artificial system
into Freshwater Bayou is shown approximately 8 inches up in
th© photograph from th© Gulf and ©nterlng into the most promi­
nent north-south waterway.
You will sea at least three artificial canals—-they
are absolutely straight—approximately 6 inches to th© left of
the Freshwater Bayou Canal, which enter into the Gulf of
Mexico.
What you cannot see in the north is the Gulf Intra­
coastal Waterway.
QUESTION:

Help me.

What is th© difference between a

canal and a bayou?
MR. HILL s

Being from South Louisiana and being from

somewhere else.
A bayou is a small—
QUESTION:

—bayous are 20 and 30 feet deep.

MR. HILL:

A bayou is, generally speaking, a small,

fairly slow-moving, body of water, which according to its
depth, might well fee called a river in other places.
Generally speaking, however, the terra "bayou” refers

€

to that which is natural,

1 have never heard an artificial

body of water referred to by that term in Louisiana or anywhere
else, to my knowledge,,
QUESTION?

Wall, how about--the canal is not natural,

MR. HILL;

The Freshwater Bayou Canal is not a—

QUESTIONS

A bayou canal?

MR. HILLs

The Freshwater Bayou Canal is a canal

correct?

What in the world is that?

which was built from 1964 to 1968, generally, but not
entirely, over the course of th® old Freshwater Bayou.
Whan I refer to Freshwater Bayou, I8m referring to the
old, natural body of water.

Freshwater Bayou Canal, on the

other hand, is not an entirely natural body ©f water, and it
is not directly involved in this case.
QUESTION;

Wall, how deep are these bayou canals?

MR. HILLs

Wall, the artificial canals, which are tha

subject of this lawsuit, ara generally eight feet deep.

They

ara somewhat shallower at points, but virtually th© entirety
of the system is generally eight fast deep by sixty feet wide.
Now —
QUESTIONs

And generally speaking tha basic difference

between a bayou and a canal is that a bayou is natural and a
canal if, manmade?
MR. HILLs

That's correct, Your Honor.

Plaintiffs pursued—plaintiffs are residents of

?
Paean Island, Louisiana,, and, among other things, ar© alleged
to haw supplemented their incomes by shrimping in, among
other places, the artificial canals prepared by feha respondents.,
The plaintiffs war© sued under the Louisiana State
trespass law by Vermilion Corporation, for, among other things,
an injunction.

Plaintiffs have defended by saying, in the

trial court, that these water®, the waters of the artificial
canal system, were impressed with a navigation servitude, and
were navigable waters of the United Statos, and thus, that
there could be no private appropriation by injunction or
otherwise to keep citizens of -the United States from being able
to navigata same.
Secondly, petitioners defended in the trial court by
saying that ths mere filing of a lawsuit, and the attempted
maintenance of cm injunction against public exercise of the
navigation servitude was, ipso facto, an obstruction under The
Rivers and Harbors Act, and was prohibited.
Petitioners finally say in this Court that the
Louisiana Organic Act, which states generally that the
navigable waters leading into the Gulf of Mexico shall be
forever free to fch© citizens, also applies, and prohibits ths
doing of 'that which Vermilion Corporation was allowed to do by
the Louisiana Stats court system.
Th@ position of the Louisiana courts is, as I read
it, quite simple,

Tha Louisian® courts find that these

8
artificial canals war© navigable in fact; that they connect©d
to various interstate marine highways of commerce , including
the Gulf of Mexico and the Gulf Intraooastal Waterway? and
that they did support, and were capable of supporting, various
kinds of commere® themselves.
Nevertheless, it was the position of the Louisian®
court system that a canal syst@m, built on privata property
with private funds, is a private thing, ported.
The questions which we believe are raised by this
proctisding ares

Does the navigation servitude in favor of

members of feh© public automatically arise and exict on
navigable waters of the United States?

Secondly, and perhaps

of somewhat lase importance, but nsverthslsas before this
Court, are the questions involving the Rivers and Harbors Act
and the Louisian® Organic Acts

Do they apply to preclude the

respondents’ essential appropriation ©f these canals to
private use?
Finally, the question?

Is an artificial canal built

with privata funds on private lands, but which is navigable
in fact, and connected to other interstate highways of commerce,
and which in its building, destroyed pre-existing natural
navigable canals, a navigable waters of the United States,
impressed with a navigation servitude?
QUESTION t

But you say that last issue»»the facts

underlying the premise are in dispute?

9

MR. HILL;

Very much.

QUESTION?

You told as that earlier.

MR, HILLs

Yes, sir»

QUESTIONS

So how can we decid© that question?

MR. HILLs

The point of law was simply rejected by

the Louisiana court system.

My—

QUESTION?

But even assuming that they had.

MR. HILLs

Yes, sir.

2 believe the decision of the

Louisiana Court of Appeals Third Circuit is pointed in that
regards

that it simply—that it would make no difference

whether I proved that ©r not.
QUESTION?

Well, if w© rejected your first point,

and than came to the last point-rejected your first two,
and came to your last, ws would have to remand t© the
Louisiana court, i/ouldn't. we?
MR. HILL;

I believe so.

QUESTION;

And even if we agreed with it?

MR. HILL;

I believe so.

QUESTION;

Yes.

QUESTIONs

Wall, if we agreed with him, we'd just

affirm, wouldn't we?
QUESTION:

No.

MR. HILLs

If you agreed with the Louisiana court

systf \u in its entirety, yes, sir.
QUESTION:

But as Mr. Justice—

In order to remand, we'd have to disagree

10
with him on the last point.
QUESTIONS

That's right.

QUESTION:

At. least w® would have to agree that the

question which they said was a factual question, was immaterial,
was material, and it would have to be found one way or the
other by a trier of fact.
QUESTION:

Exactly.

QUESTION %

Excuse me.

On that point, as I understand

your theory, is that if they interfered with, say--i£ they
built a new Canal X, and. that had an impact on old Canal Y,
that was—-you're saying that's the factual issue—"do you have

mi interest in the navigation on Canal Y?

I wonder if you have

any standing to complain about what they may have don© to that
other canal?
QUESTIONS

The bayou.

QUESTIONs

The bayou.

MR. HILL?

As a member of the public, as. a citizen

I.'m sorry, which was. a bayou.

of the United States, in whose favor the navigation servitude
on navigable waters of the United States runs—
QUESTION?

But isn't the complaint here about shrimp-

ing in the area that's been built, rather than navigating in
the area that may have been impaired?
MR. HILL?

But if the pre-existing navigable water­

way had impressed on it a navigation servitude, and they
appropriated that servitude by destruction of that waterway, it

11
is car position that equitably th© navigation servitude must
b© transferred onto the new system.

And 1 believe there 1b

authority for that in this Court in Philadelphia Co. v.
Stixoson.
QUESTIONs

I see.

You've got a—-this is a substitute

for the old, and you're entitled to that? I see.
MR. HILL;

Philadelphia Co. v. Stimson is 223 U.S.

QUESTION;

Now, Mr. Hill, your first two points at

60S.

least, depend entirely on the fact that this is water, doesn't
it?
MR. HILL;

Yes.

QUESTION s

.Okay.

In other words, your argument in

no way asserts that if I own land two miles from an int® re­
stat® highway, and build a two-mile driveway from my property
to tlie insterstate highway, that that driveway belonged to the
public? or at least, that the public had ©pen and free access
to it.

Would you?
MR. HILL;

I would not at all, sir.

QUESTION;

So it depends entirely upon th© fact

these firs water.

Because aside—except for th® fact that

thesu are water, this case is very much like my hypothetical
case, isn't it?
MR. HILLs

The—in order for waterways to have any

reason for being, and to have any usefulness, they have to be

12
as they ware in this case.

They have to literally be borne out

of the public water? they have to b@ tied to other interstate
highways of commerce, as they ware in this case,,

They must

hav® the public water t© exist.
They, in their existence, may well affect the
navigable integrity and capacity of other public waterways.
Non© of that is tru© in the case of roadways.
QUESTION?

Isn’t there a petition—-an affidavit

that this has always b©©n op©n to the public?
MR. HILL?

That is an ancillary disputed issue.

You're

quite correct about that, Mr. Justice Marshall.
QUESTION?

It isn’t anything more than that?

It is disputed.
MR. HILL?

My point, and in one of my earlier briefs—

I don't know if it’s in my brief to this Court—“that is a
little bit of an interesting sidelight.

My point is that

Louisianians, for examples, had gone on their merry way for
yearn with people who my client’s position—-petitioners6
positions—-'thinking it was generally speaking fine' for them
to navigate these canals or those like them? whereas people
in the position of the respondents and other similarly
situated hav® thought that they had an absolute right to
keep them out.
I don't—this ease has never, to my knowledge, baen
presented in a federal context.

The only jurisprudential

13
dealings in it have bean under the Louisiana State law.
QUESTION?

It could be that the public was only

there by sufforanca?
MR. KILLs

That is-»-»

QUESTION?

It could b®.

MR. HILL?

That is very confusing.

W@f of course--we

disputo that.
The congressional power fc© regulate is thought to be
an important issue of this cas@i

Whether or not the standard;!

for determination of natural water® of the United States in
regulations cases under th© commerce clause is the same as the
standard for navigation servitude cassis.
QUESTION3
is applicable.

Or whether or not admiralty jurisdiction

Or a variety of other application®.

MR. HILL?

I would concade, as primarily an admiralty

lawyer, that that does present a different question for, 2
think, a large number of reasons.

I do not, however, feel that

the argument has merit, when only congressional•power to
regulate under the commerce clausa, as applied to waterways,
on the one hand, and the navigation servitude on the other,
are concerned.
QUESTIONS

Do you think th© navigable waters of the

United States means navigable waters belonging to th© United
Status, or navigable waters located anywhere in the United
States?

14
MR. HILLs

Navigabl© waters of the United States, as

it was already said this morning, belongs to no one.
QUESTIONS

Well, what do you think the phrase means,

was my question.
MR. HILLs
orSj

Navigable—-it means two things.

Number

it means navigable waters, waterways which are navigable

in fact, either in their natural, ordinary condition, or—
QUESTIONS

Located anywhere in the Unitad States?

MR. KILL?

Located anywhere in the United Statas.

QUESTIONS

Now, certainly it doesn’t mean that, if

itcs antirely within a single State, does it?
MR. HILLs

Mo.

If it is located entirely within a

single state and connects with other bodies of water that
lead to interstate waters, than it is "of the United States?"
than it is in interstate commerce.
The phrase, M©£ the United Statas,” I take to mean
wate:>- • that are in, that burden, affect, or have something
to do -with interstate commerce.
I'm sorry I didn’t follow the thrust of your
question, but certainly I would agree with that.
The fact is, as wa see it, that the navigation
servitude and the congressional power to regulat® waterways,
are in on® sense, coterminous, or are identical; until really
a very few years ago, congressional regulation of waterways,
to my knowledge, had, if not exclusively, at least

15
predominantly, on® object, and that was, the protection of &
public right to navigat©»
Other reasons for the exercise of congressional
regulatory power, as applied to waterway8--for example,
pollution control~*-are really a fairly recent consideration.
From the time of Gibbons v. Ogden, as I appreciate
the law, the navigation servitude, and the congressional
power to regulate waterways, have been treated as part and
parcel of ths same thing.

If they have, arid if that is

correct, than we feel that the respondents' argument that
there is a difference, and that a different standard should b©
applied, simply ha© no merit.
And if it has no merit., Appalachian Power v. United
States, which seems to us her© to apply, Appalachian Elastrie
Power says that waterways which may k© rendered navigable
with reasonable improvement ar® navigable waterways of the
United States.
We submit that there is- no difference, practically
and factually, between digging a canal off of the Intracoastal
Waterway, or digging a canal that connect© with th® Gulf, and,
on the other hand, artificial improvement, of th© new river,
which in its natural state was no good for any sort of
navigation whatsoever, 'They both require exactly the same sort
of acts and expenditure of money and doing work and, generally
speaking, the same sort© of human activity as ar©

16
required here, and th© result is the sanies a new body of water,
over which interstat® commerce may be transacted.
If Your Honors have no further question®, I would
like to reserve the balance of my time,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER*

Very well.

Mr. McCall.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF HARRY McCALL, JR. , ESQ, ,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
»

MR. McCALL2

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it plsase

th© Courts
if I nay go back a moment and refer to this aerial
photograph, this photograph is not part of the record.

It

is purely an aid to assist Your Honors in saaing what ifc is
we're talking about.
QUESTION*
MR. McCALL:

There9a no disagreement about it?
There is no disagreement about it,

except that I would like to point out several things with
respect to it.
QUESTION*

We were told, Mr. McCall, that it

was offered into.evidence.

I gather, then, it was not

received in evidence?
MR. McCALL:

It was not offered into evidenea as

I understand it, Your HOnor.
QUESTION*
MR. McCALL*

rn were told so.
I think that was a misstatement.

17
QUESTION?

Weil, XsiR not saying that yo« told u-*3,

but what your brother told us.

Ha said it was offered in

evidence„
MR. McCMiL:

I don’t think ha meant that; because

it was not offared at trial.
QUESTIONt

Perhaps h@ didn’t mean it, but that’s

what h© did say.
MR. McC&LLs

It is purely, as I say, an aid for

oral argument.
And so 'that Your Honors will know what it is we are
talking about, I am informed that the dimensions of this are
approximately 10 mil©® to a side.

And the principal aspect

of this, to which we would respectfully invite fcho Court’s
attention, is the number of canals which deadend.

And that

is explained by the fact that the great majority of these
canals wer© dredged for the purpose of mineral development.
The nature of the land her©, which, as you can see,
is on tha Gulf Coast~-it is swamp land-»-is such that it is
not possible to gat a drilling rig, other than by floating
it in.

And this explains the shape of the shape of these

canals, and the fast that they all terminat® at some point.
Th© only canal which was dredged by tha engineers
i'i. as counsel has pointed out, that canal which extends on
the righthand aid® of th© photograph in pretty much a straight
line, and was taken***-has taken th® place—lt’s known as

IS
Freshwater Bayou Canal.

And it, to a large extent, takes the

placa of fehs former Freshwater Canal.
QUESTION t

For the purposes ©f this case, Mr. McCall,

would it make any difference whether th® canals were dredged for
oil rigs or steamboats?
MR. McCALLs
least.

Not in the least, Your Honor.

Except to this extents

Not in the

As long as it is understood

that th© dredging of these canals was accomplished for
privat® purposes for th® us© of th® land.

mentioned, ware they dredged for

They are there either to gain aecas» to oil wall

locations, to trap lines, access to hunting leases, and placas
like that.

But other than that, Your Honor is quit© right?

it makes no difference,
QUESTION3

Mr. McCall, with respect to the canal

that was dredged to replace a pre-existing bayou, you don't
challenge their right to us© that canal, do you?
MR. McCALLs
QUESTION *
MR. MeCALL;

No, sir.

That's a public canal.

Yas.
That was dredged by the Corps of

Engineers pursuant to a servitude which we gave them for that
purpose.

But that canal is not at issue in this case.
QUESTION s

MR. McCALLs

Where does that canal go?
That canal goes from the Gulf of Mexico,

IS
which shows at the bottom of th® map, to Vermilion Bay, which
is up to the right and off th® map? off the photograph,
QUESTIONi
MR, MeCALLs

Vermilion Bay is part of th® ossan?
It3s a bay from th® Gulf of Mexico, and

to that extent, it is part of the ocean? yes, Your Honor,
QUESTIONs

If private funds had dredged that canal,

suppose the ©anal had never raashed Vermilion Bay, but
private funds dredged it and extended it to Vermilion Bay,
Would you fee making th© sama argument about that canal?
MR, MeCALLs

Wa i^ould bm making—-you mean the 8am©

argument we*re presently making about that canal, or about our
other canals?
QUESTIONs

Yas, could you keep the public out of that

canal?
MR, MeCALLs

W® coil tend, Your Honor, that we were

entitled to keep the public out of that canal,

I qualify

thatQUESTION3

What about—<would Congress have the power

to require you to let the public in, say for a price?
MR, McCALLi

Oh, I have no question about that.

I think Congress' power is paramount if it can show a public
purpose, it can appropriate just about anything it wants,
provided they pay for it,
QUESTION s
MR, MeCALLs

Would they have to pay you for it?
In our ©pinion, they would, Your Honor,

20

QUESTIONs

So you would say that Congress could not

pass a statute that required you to let the public into
these—-this canal system that is presently at issue?
MR. McCALLs

That's precisely our position, Your

Honor.
QUESTIONS

Mr. McCall, what about the factual

dispute referred to by th© Louisiana Court of Appeals on page
A10 of the petition, whore they say that th® defendants
cont®ad there is a factual disputa, and the factual dispute
is that artificial waterways destroyed th® navigability of
the surrounding natural waterways?
Now the Court of Appeals, as 1 understood, said
Louisiana law doss not stabs that factual dispute material in
the legal sens©.

But there is that factual dispute between

you and your opponent, is there not?
MR, McCALLs

We do not concede, Your Honor, that

thar ' does exist such a factual dispute.
The basis is that dispute is the affidavit which
appears at 54 of the-"54A of the Appendix,

And if Your

Honors will examine that affidavit carefully, bearing in mind
that affidavits are not drafted by the clients, but by
counsel, you will observe that that affidavit does not create
an issue of fast.
Look particularly at th® last paragraph of this
affidavit.

Prior—I'm sorry.

21
QUESTION *

What page?

MR, McCALL:

Pag© 54A of th© Appendix, Mr, Justice

Powell.
If you will examine ttm last paragraph of that
affidavit, it begins?

''Prior to th© development of th®

Humble Canal System, deponant® ©r® aware that various
portions of the natural navigable waterway system,Met
cetera.
The law of Louisiana is quit® olear.

When you're

opposing a motion for summary judgment, you must nak© art
affidavit that fairly insets th© affidavits, or the repre­
sentations mad© by th® moving party, and it must be made on
personal oaths.
QUESTION?

But that isn't th® answer that the

Louisiana Court of Appeals

gave,

They treated it, as I

read their opinion, as a permissible affidavit, and simply
said legally it was insufficient,
MR, McCALL:
QUESTION?

Well, may I com© to that?
Sure,

MR, McCALL:

And I think I should, since Your Honor

has asked th© question,
Th© answer which th© Court ©f Appeals gave in
Louisiana is to be found in an earlier decision by the courts
of Louisiana, the Supreme Court of Louisiana, which is cited,
X believe, in both briefs, in Ilhenny v, Broussard, that

22

was a case involving another situation wherein access was
sought to private canals„

tod what the court held there

was 'that even though it ware established that there had been
destruction of, or impediment to the use of, an existing
canal, that would not ©£ itself giv@ the public the right to
us© the canals which had effected that destruction or
substitution.
tod the reasoning for that was that th® whole matter
of navigable waterways was given ovar by Congress to the
Secretary ©f War and delegated by him to th® Corps of Engi­
neers.

tod what they ©aid was that th© recourses which

anyone has, if he had any in a situation such as that, was
r to the Corps of Engineers; and that unless and until the Corps
acted on this matter, that there was nothing to come before
■th® Court.
tod it was with reference to that decision that th0
Court of Appeals in this ease held that if that were a fact,
if that fact war® established, that then this would not b©
dispositive, because it was first requisita that these
reap©'-dents—or these petitioners? X stand corrected—thas®
petitioners should make application to the Corps of Engineers
to declare that this was a waterway which had been obstructed.
And 1 think it is quite clear, under the Rivers and
Harbors Act, that it is the duty of the engineer to enforce
th® provisions ©f that Act, tod where there has be-an any sort

23
of impediment or any sort of action contrary to the provisions
of the Act* it is incumbent on the engineers to act.
And that; I think, is the answer which fehs Court of
Appeals of Louisiana gave»
Is that responsive to Your Honor’s question?
QUESTIONS
MR. McCALL:

Yes it is.
Let ma say that I mentioned the other

aspect of it b@o®u@@ I think it is d©sirab 1 e--that, is, the
insufficiency of the affIda vit—because I think it is desirable
for this Court to understand that no real issue ©f fact has
h@@n created by this affidavit, under ©ur Louisiana procedures.
But 2 think the substantial answer which lies in the
holding of the Court of Louisiana in Ilhenny v, Broussard.
Now, if I may, Your Honors, let m® say that 2 think
the critical question, and the critical area of inquiry in
this case is*

What are wa talking about when we’re talking

about navigable bodies ©f water?
It is our contention that the power of Congress under
the commerce clausa over navigable waters is one thing.

Th©

navigation servitudo is quit® another.
Th© navigation servitude—
QUESTIONi

Well, you’re separating the Rivers and

Harbors Act, for example, from the other questions? is that
part of it?
MR. McCALL*

Well, the Rivers and Harbors Act--»

QUESTIONs

Pollution control , for example, or

impediments to navigation.
MR. McCALLt

We ar® separating them in tills sensa,

Mr. Chief Justice, which is, that as we appreciate it, Congress5
power to enact the Rivers and Harbors Act stems from the commerce
clause?- and it is in the exercise of its power under the commerce
elan»© that it doas legislate with respect to pollution, to
flood control, t© recreation, to those matters on which Congress
has lagislated.
But what w@ say, and we believe that this is central
to the whole controversy her®, that the so-called servitude
of navigation

is only one aspect ©f Congress' power over

navigable waters generally.
So coming back

to a question which was addressed by

©ns c-f Your Honors to counsel, what is a navigable, water?

W@

would suggest to Your Honors that the answer to that depends ©n
what your inquiry is.

Because if you3re talking about the

servitude of navigation, that is ©ns thing.

If you're talking

about, say, flood control, ©r if you5r© talking about
something like that, it is another.
QUESTIONs

Xf yousr@ talking about—first, if you're

talking about a navigational servitude, that has nothing t© d©
}
with congressional action. And the second query is, if
you're talking about congressional power under the commerce
clause.

Isn't that what you mean?

23
MR. McCALL:

Precisely9 Your Honor.

When I say, however^ that it has nothing to do with
it; I would acospt counsel's statement that Congress9 power,
through the commerce clause, over navigation, as it were,
protects tli® servitude—
QUESTION:

But there assists a sarvitudo with ©r

without congressional action?
MR. McCALL*

.

Precisely,

And that servitude is fairly

prscisaly defined in a number of decisions ©f this Court.
QUESTION:

And we were told in the earlier case that

this stems from the common law of England adopted by the
colonies of the United States and carried forward as a matter
©f national impact in our—the commerce clause of our
Constitution.
But it has nothing to do with congressional power

MR. McCMiLs
QUESTIONi
MR, MoCALLs

Precisely.

That is—

I mean, that’s your point?
That is our point, and we baliev© that

that is important to to© resolution of the issues raised in
this case.
Now, fehs servitude of navigation is not coextensive
with Congress' power over commerce.

It is limited.

In the

servitude ©f navigation is, with relation to streams which
are naturally navigabis, ©r as th© phrase is sometimes used,

26
in their normal

gk

natural condition.

How the distinction its important for this reasons
that when Congress acts through its d@lagat@, th® Corps of
Engineers, with respect to th® area covered fey th© servitude
of navigation, no compensation is necessary.

And th® reason

for that is, that th® riparian owner has rights in that part
of the stream which is covered—>or th® bank which is covered—
by the servitude of navigation, which is an imperfect' right.
H® haa a qualified title.

\

\

And tl» qualification to th&b title is that the
national power of Congress may appropriate that portion ©f th©
stream which is subject to the servitude of navigation without
any compensation whatsoever.
Conversely, however, although there may be araas which
are beyond the reach of th® servitude ©f navigation, they^may
b® appropriated by Congress in its arercis© of its power over""
commerce? for example, flood control or something like that.
Biit it must then pay just compensation.

I think that possibly the best illustration of that
is in the United States against Kansas City Light Company case.
That was.a case, Your Honors will recall, whore there was a
flood-control or & dam which was constructed.
quence of that was that the water backed up.

And the conse­

And th© water

backed up not only as to th® bank© of th© river, that portion
covered by th© navigable servitude, but it backed up well

27
beyond that onto fast land,

tod th® holding of that case was

that compensation wag due, to th© extent that fast land was
ooversd by the waters which had backed tip.
I think that ©a© ease—and th@r® ar® several Ilk© that— -illustrates possibly more clearly than any other th©
limits of the servitude ©f navigation.
How, coming bask to this proposition that the
servitude of navigation extends to waters in their natural
and normal condition.

It is true that this Court and other

courts have, on occasion, said that waters which may be in their
normal or natural stat® ar© subject to reasonable improvements.
But I would pose to your Honors a question of how
construction of a canal, on what was formerly fast land, could
possibly be considered to b© reasonable improvement?
QUESTION2

Seasonable improvement of navigation; is

that what you’re saying?
MR. McCALLs

Of th© stream itself, or

of the navi­

gability of the stream, yes, sir; that is the point,
QUESTION*

Well, it's coneeiva&le, isn’t it, that

you could have a navigable stream 20 feet wide, end the Corps
of Engineer's would decide that it would be a better navigable
stream if it war© 40 feat wide.

And as a result they would

have to take 10 feet of fast, land off of ©ach side of the

stream.
Now, in a case like that, I take it they would hav©

28
to pay compensation?
MR. McCALLs

w© would so contend, Your Honor, arid we

believ© the cases so dictate.
Now, th© point of the navigation servitude is that
if I, for example, have my grist mill on tha bank of that
stream, and the engineers take part of that stream and set it
back so that I can’t have ray grist mill anymore, they must
compensate me for ray mill, but they don’t have to compensate
is© for tha fact that I can no longer us© the power from that
stream.
And that, it seems to us, is on® of th® most critical
aspects of this case; that what wo*re talking about here is,
is there a servitude of navigation on these artificially
constructed canals *
The record is quite olear that theses canals were
all construoted on private lands, by private individuals, with
private funds.
QUESTIONs

Mr. McCall, can I interrupt you for a

second?
MR, MoCALLs
QUESTION?

Of course, Your Honor.
In Mr. Justice R@hnquistEs question about

adding 20 feet to a canal, or to a navigable stream, the
extra 20 feet that wars added would be navigable and would be
sub j sot to tha servitude, would they not?
MR. Ms CALL:

QUESTIONS

But that isn't th@ question her®,

whether this is a reasonable improvement.
MR, McCALL*

Well, wo take the positi on—and we

baliev® it's a sound one—that wh@r© you dig your canal fro©

the navigability of a stream,
QUESTIONS

Of course, all these have always bean

MR. MeCALLs

No, air.

Isn't that it?

That’s not correct.

These

canals—there was nothing where these canals were before.

you will examine this plat, you will observe that the. shape
©f these canals is such that it is quit© clear that they war©

Now, if I may-call it if you will a digression.

1

would like to address the suggestion that is mads by counsel
that we have don© is, that w© have destroyed or impaired the
useability

of existing streams, which ties in a little bit

with your question, Mr. Justice Stefans.
And wa would say as to that that ther© is nothing
in tli© record to support that contention.

The deposition

which was given by Mr. Donohue, who is the manager of
respondent, is to the effect that the only stream which has—
only body of water or bayou-—which has bean, interfered with
is tli a former Freshwater Bayou, which has been replaced by the
canal which the Corps of Engineers constructed.
And 1 would refer your Honors to Freshwater Bayou
Canal, which is the wide canal coming from the Gulf proceeding
up—this photograph is oriented with North at the top—goes
up. North, and just at the juncture with the canal which goes
off to the left, Your Honors will see this obviously natural
waterway which was Freshwater Bayou.
Mow, Freshwater Bayou, as can be seen from that, is
no longer useable, but not by reason of any canal constructed
by ti n respondent, but purely by construction of the
engineers® canal, Freshwater Bayou canal, to which, as I said

And I won’t 'Labor that

point, because I think that’s quit© clear, that they did not

But addressing this question—and again, wa would
respectfully refer your Honors to our brief—th© testimony
which is submitted by Mr. Donohue is that there w«r© no
obstructions of existing canals by any—or existing bayous —

by any canal constructed by the respondent.

They do not corniest the Gulf with the intracoastal

If you wanted to go from, ©ay, a wall location out

MR, MeCALLs

They do at on® end.

But I ’11 tell you

what this case is about, and I appreciate the opportunity of
doing so.
This case is about the desire of these petitioners

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN K, HILL, JR., ESQ.,

/

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. HILL%

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

It is, admittedly, not at all the province of this
Court t© deal with whether or not til®re is a practical dispute.
Nevertheless, the Court should be aware that, a® part of the
record, I foallevs it’s either pages 44 or 45 of Mr. John
Donohue's deposition, there is an indication that the old,
natural body of water, Freshwater Bayou, did eourss all th©
way freon Pecan Island to the Gulf, and was once open from Pecan
Island to the Gulf.
Second, although not part of th® record, there is
mentioned in the Government's amicus, at page 32—the footnote
on. page 32—that th® Corps of Engineers—a Corps of Engineers
report on this matter indicates that when plans were submitted
to thi

Corps by th® ancestors, in title of the Vermilion

Corporation, first to build their canals, that those plans
showed artificial canals which were planned and designed to

37
intersect old, natural bodies of water.
QUESTIONs

If you have-**if you have freshwater

bodi®s of water which are not subject to federal servitude,
but are linked on either end, so that they do ultimately connect
with interstate water, does that alter the status of the
freshwater pond, lake, whatever it may foe?
MR. HILL*

In other words, if one had, regardless of

this argument, a body of water that was connected on both endsto waterways which in turn war© part of the system of
interstat© marine commerce?
I think those would b@, if Your Honor please,

If the navigation servitude, as it does,, exists for

on© of the older cases in th© jurisprudence of this Court,
Illinois Central v. State of Illinois, which is citad in ray brief,
indicates that it does.
That does not require th.® Corps of Engineers for its

Furthermore, it seems to me almost ludicrous

to say that a private party can sue another private party to

Well, that’s almost tautological, in

light of casas like Kansas City Light, isn’t it?

Because they

And perhaps you can say, it’s because the navigational
servitude didn’t asriand that far.
But certainly there are limits to which Congress
can’t go beyond, without paying money for taking land,
MR, HILL:

I agree with that.

But when—unlike the

Kansas City Sight case, when the privata owner of land takes
it upon himself to create a system of waterways —how? —by
tying them into navigable waters ©f the United States, then he
has, by his own act, caused a navigation servitude to be

And that, it seems to hi®, is a crucial

But if th© Appalachian Power Company test

is correct, then a river which is not at all capable of being
navigated at the present time, and which no private riparian
owner has indicated any intent

to improve, to make navigable,

is nonetheless subject to th® navigational servitude.

So it can’t be just a question of whether the owner

49
chooses to tie into a navigational system.
MR. HILL j

I “«with all due respact to you, sir—

I think that thos® are two questions.
When the owner elect® to build the canals, once th®
canals are built, Appalachian—the Appalachian tost no longer

MR. HILLs

Two reasons.

Ntambar one, perhaps the

development of those in the United States was of somewhat more
importance than it is now, simply as a matter of policy.

And

number two, I do not think that the charging of tolls is
necessarily tantamount to a negation ©f th© existence of a

But again, I do not believe that that—although I
think that it's quit© questionable whether or not those cases
would pass muster before this Court now.

Nevertheless, there

was never a case -that said that on those navigable waters
there was .not a public right to navigate.
These people do not seek to charge tolls.

to bar the public entirely.
