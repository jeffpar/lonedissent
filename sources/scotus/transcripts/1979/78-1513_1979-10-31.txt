PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first this morning in United States v. Clark.
Mrs. Shapiro, you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF HARRIET S. SHAPIRO9 ESQ. 9
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MRS. SHAPIRO:

Mr. Chief Justicec and may it

please the Court:
This case is here on appeal by the government
from a judgment of the Court of Claims requiring the pay­
ment of survivorship benefits to two illegitimate children
of a deceased federal employee.

The Court of Claims found

that the children were entitled to payments even though
they could not meet the eligibility requirements of the
Civil Service Retirement Act.

It relied upon its decision

in a previous ease In which it concluded that the statutoryrequirement denied equal protection to illegitimate
children.
The government contends here s first, that the
Court of Claims had no jurisdiction to award benefits in
this ease; and9 second, that in any event the statutory
requirement is constitutional.
George Isaacson was a federal employee when he
ivas killed in an automobile accident in 197*1 *

He was

unmarried but he was survived by two illegitimate children,,
Shawn and

Tricia Clark„ who are represented by the

appellee here.
Isaacson had recognised them and was subject to
a court order requiring him to make monthly payments for
their support*

Although he had lived with them for a few

years, he had stopped living with them more than two years
before his^death.
The Clark children applied for benefits under
the Ci%Tll Service Retirement Act.

That act provides for

the payment of monthly benefits to the surviving children
of covered federal employees*

The statute defines the

child to include adopted children as well as step-children
and recognized natural children who lived with the wage
earner in a regular parent-child relationship.
The Civil Service Commission and the Office of
Personnel Management, which

Is

the successor of the com­

mission, have consistently interpreted the statute as
denying benefits to step-children and to illegitimate
children who were not living with the employee when he
died.

Sine© the Clark children —
QUESTION:

Mrs. Shapiro , when you say that„

though;, haven’t they proposed the elimination of th© lived
with requirement?
MRS, SHAPIRO:

There is a proposal that was

5

passed by the House last week, a bill -QUESTION;

Doesn’t that come from the Commission?

MRS. SHAPIRO:

Yes.

The Commission proposed this

statute which would amend the act to make payments to de­
pendent children, but would provde that either a child who
lived with or who received contributions from the employee
would be considered dependent.
QUESTION:

When you say that the act has consistently

been construed to require that the lived-with requirement be
met at the time of the death of the wag® earner,

how many

examples would there be in the reported materials that we
could look at in some way or another of cases in which there
was a lived-with at some prior time but not at the time, the
data of death?

Would there be other cases lik© this?

MRS. SHAPIRO:
cant number.

I don't believe there are a signifi­

I'm not sure.

QUESTION:

I just don't have any feel for how often

this problem arises.
MRS. SHAPIRO:

It's a consistent administrative in­

terpretation.
QUESTION:
times?

But does that mean twice, or a hundred

Bo we know?
MRS. SHAPIRO?
QUESTION:

As far as —

Or once, maybe? just this case, possibly.

MRS. SHAPIRO:

1 know that it's more —

6
QUESTION:

Normally they do things as of the data of

death, but I'm just wondering how often it really is signifi­
cant»

That5s what's hard to ■—
MRS, SHAPIRO:

I'm not sure that it has been liti­

gated before.
QUESTION:

I think what bothers me is your use of the

word "consistent," because if the Commission is now behind
this proposed legislation, they're receding from what may
have been a consistent position.
MRS. SHAPIRO:
decisions.

The legislation is based on the Court

It's not that they have made an administrative de­

termination.
QUESTION:

Does the Commission interpret the act as

passed by Congress or just make recommendations for changes?
MRS. SHAPIRO:

.Well, the Commission, it interprets

it in administrating the act and paying benefits.
The Clark children sued in the Court of Claims under
the Tucker Act challenging both th© Commission's -interpretation
of the act and its constitutionality as so interpnal-d,.
They argued first that they war© entitled to bene­
fits under the act because they had once lived with Isaacson.
Alternatively, they argued that th© act as interpreted by the
Commission denied them equal protection because they could not
qualify for benefits by proving that they were actually

7
dependent on their father.
After this suit was filed but before it was decided
by the Court of Claims, that Court decided another case
challenging the lived-with reauirement in the Civil Service
Retirement Act.

That case was Gentry v. United States.

Gentry involved a child who had never lived with a Federal
employe©, and the court in that case found that the statutory
requirement was unconstitutional.

So when it decided this

case, th© Court of Claims followed Gentry.
The government didn't seek to ask, didn't ask this
(hurt to review this decision in Gentry because we lost track
of it after the Court of Claims remanded the case for further
findings by the Commission.

We learned of the entry of the

final judgment only a few days before our time to petition
for certiorari expired, and substantially after the time to
not© an appeal.

By that time, we knew that the Clark case
\

and others w©r© coming along and that the Commission was work­
ing on legislation.
In November of 1977, the District Court for th©
District of Columbia decided Proctor v. United States and en­
joined the Commission froro applying th© lived-with requirement
to illegitimate children, so th® Commission began paying
benefits under that ord^rfrom and after December first,
1977.

s
Finally, in the only class action so far, Jenkins v.
the Office of Personnel Management, the District Court for the
District of Columbia ordered the Office of Personnel Management
to pay benefits retroactively to February 1972.

That order

imposed a much heavier burden on the resources of the Retire­
ment Fund.

That factor, plus the importance of the retro-

activity question for other Federal benefit programs,' has led
to our decision to seek review in this Court in this ease.
I propose to focus today on the question of whether
th® Court of Claims had jurisdiction to decide this case.
QUESTION?

Do X understand, Mrs. Shapiro, that the

Clark children are now, for the reasons vou gave us, receiving
benefits?
MRS. SHAPIRO:

They are receiving benefits under the

decision of th© Court of Claims.

They have not received the

lump sum that would take them from the time their father died

/
up till the time the stipulation for th® entry of judgment was
entered.

They ar® currently receiving $187 a month.
I intend to rely primarily on our briefs for th®

issues raised by the appellee concerning this Court's juris­
diction and the correctness of the agency's interpretation of
the act.

I would Ilk© to discuss th© jurisdiction of the

Court of Claims and X have a few comments to add to the dis­
cussion in. our- brief on th® merits.

9
QUESTION:

I would like somewhere along the line to

have you discuss the other suggestion that lived-with may be
applied to some period other than at the time of death.
MRS. SHAPIRO:
fairly simple.

Well, our argument on that really is

The purpose cf the statute is to replace the

support that was lost when the wage earner died, and the
lived-with requirement as interpreted by the agency is that
the time when the support was lost was at the wage earner's
death for children who were living with the wage earner at
that time.

If they stopped living with the wag® earner, as

the Clark children did, several years previously, that is the
point at which the statute assumes the support was lost.
QUESTION:

What if they never lived with the

father but h© arranged for them to be somewhere else and paid
for all their living?
MRS. SHAPIRO:

Well, then, they are not qualified,

undsr this action because they wars not living with him in a
regular parent-child relationship when he died, or at any time.
QUESTION:

So the support factor vanishes under

that language?
MRS. SHAPIRO:

Well, the theory behind the statufc©

is that for illegitimate children, tha easiest and simplest
and most accurst© way of determining whether ther© was support
is by simply looking to see whether they were living with tha

10
wage earner.
QUESTION;

Well, on the contrary, if a man can show

cancelled checks over a period of ten years and a tax deduction
every year for support, that would be pretty good evidence,
wouldn't it?
MRS. SHAPIRO;

It would be an alternative way of

proving the —QUESTION;

Th© support factor, as distinguished from

the lived-with factor?
MRS. SHAPIRO;

That's right, but. the congressional

judgment was that, as this Court has frequently recognised,
the classifications may be minimally inaccurate in sane situa­
tions.

You don't focus on the facts of the individual case,

you look to see whether the classification for the general
universe is reasonable.
QUESTION;

Theoretically, they could live with the

father without receiving any support from him, with a grand­
mother paying the father for all their car©?
MRS. SHAPIRO;
sible.

It certainly is theoretically pos­

Th© congressional judgment was that in the usual case,

th© illegitimate child who is living with his father is the
one who is most likely to be supported, and that's the situa­
tion in which payments are to b® made, arid these other unusual
situations fall outside fch© statute.

Ii
QUESTIONS

What about legitimate children?

MRS. SH&PXRO:

Legitimate

children are deemed to

have been supported whether or not they *r© living with the wage

earner.
QUESTION:

Or whether or not they are in fact sup­

ported?
MRS. SHAPIRO:

Right.

Th© statute, as the statute

in Lucas, is somewhat overinclusive for letigimate children.
QUESTION:

What do you suggest the Congress do to

avoid th® problems of proof in individual cases?
MRS. SHAPIRO?

They provided for a live-with re­

quirement —
QUESTION:

Why?

MRS. SHAPIRO:

Because it's an accurate indicator

of support in th© generality of cases.
QUESTION:

In th® generality, but — so th® only

advantage was to avoid individualising cases?
MRS. SHAPIRO:

That's right.

And the Census report

that w© cited in our reply brief indicates that in fact, it?s
an accurate indicator in all but 4 percent of th© cases.
QUESTION?

Well, there's th© 4 percent, and you don't

think that, you just don't think that it's necessary in il­
legitimacy cases to individualize?
MRS. SHAPIRO:

That's what w@ get from reading

12

Lalli in combination with Lucas and Jimenez, that although the
statute may be somewhat unjust in individual cases, as long as
it's finely

tuned and substantially related, it’s constitu­

tional ,
QUESTION;

But it isn’t finely tuned with respect to

this one captive area of children, is it?
MRS. SHAPIRO:

At most, they are 4 percent of th©

total universe, and that’s a finely-tuned statute.
QUESTION:

I think tii® 4 percent figure is somewhat

misleading, isn’t it?

Does that include th® children who have

been acknowledged by th® illegitimate father?
MRS. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:
it.®an.

Yes, it includes —

And it isn’t limited to that, is what I

That's all illegitimate children, isn’t it?
MRS. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

That is —

And the statute already excludes illegi­

timate children who have not been acknowledged by their father,
and the only relevant statistic on the additional requirement
of lived-with would b© not only those who lived with their
parent, but also had been acknowledged, and your figure doesn’t
take that into account at all.
Th©r©’s 4 percent of all illegitimate children, is
what you’re — live with their never-married mothers.
MRS. SHAPIRO *

Right.

13
QUESTIONS

But isn't th© universe cut down to those

vrho 've been acknowledged by their father by the statute?
MRS. SHAPIRO:

But even 30, there's no more than 4

percent of any illegitimate children who are receiving support
payments from their fathers, so that —
QUESTION:

I just don't see how that's relevant to

the lived-with requirement, when you -- in other words, if you
struck the lived-with requirement out entirely, you'd still
have the 4 percent figure.
MRS, SHAPIRO:

That may mean that the lived-with re­

quirement is somewhat over’-'inclusive.
QUESTION:

Probably -- well, may I ask you this on

the lived-with requirement:

Is the congressional judgment, is

it your theory that the congressional judgment, if you have a
child, an illegitimate child who is acknowledged by his father
and lived with the father for a particular period of time and
then stopped living with him, that it's reasonable to assume
that tha father then discontinued support?

Because he didn't

in this eas©.
Is there any esc ample that we know ©f anywhere where
a father both, acknowledged his child and lived with him for a
substantial period of time and left, and then stopped support­
ing him?

It s©@®3 to me the law would not permit him to stop

supporting him, under that set of fasts.

And how could Congress

14
have reasonably assumed that he would then just walk away from
/

fch© child and have no further obligation?
MRS, SHAPIRO:

Whether or not there was a court or­

der, it doesn't necessarily follow that he complied with it,
QUESTIONS

But which is th© more probable?

That you

have both a formal acknowledgement and a family relationship#
and then th® father abandons fch® child — wouldn’t there nor­
mally be any — and he continues to earn money, he’s got a
job and he's paying — a government job in this case — and
you would think th© Congress reasonably thought that in the
normal run of cases, he would stop providing any support for
the child.
Th© only case wa know about is this on®, which it
didn't happen in,
MRS. SHAPIRO?
QUESTIONS
mad© that judgment?

That's th© congressional judgment.

Do you think that the Congress actually
You sea, they'd make a contrary judgment

if you construe the sfcafcufc© to mean lived with at any time.
But that's critical to your case, your construction of th®
statute, -that Congress really thought that?
MRS. SHAPXRG:

That's correct, and this is th® con­

struction that the Agency has followed —
QUESTION?
cas@

Consistently followed in at least one

15
QUESTION:

And didn't the- Court of Claims also con­

strue th® statute that way in the Gentry case?

In holding it

unconstitutional?
MRS. SHAPIRO:

No, in the Gentry case, that issue was

not involved because th© Gentry children had not lived with
their father at all.
QUESTION:

Ever?

MRS. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Yes.
But by implication I suppose they

did it here, didn't they?
MRS. SHAPIRO:

Well, here they didn't — they fol-

lowed Gentry.
QUESTION:

I mean, they wouldn't have held it un­

constitutional if they had. construed the statute in th® way
suggested by;my brother Stevens' question?
MRS. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

That's true.
j
Correct?

MRS. SHAPIRO:

That's true.

This cas® is not a

statutory construction cas®.
QUESTION:

It's-a constitutional case.

MRS. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION•

It's a constitutional case, right.

And they wouldn't and certainly in logic

wouldn't have held it unconstitutional had they construed the
statute the other way?

IS
MRS. SHAPIRO;
QUESTIONS

That’s true.

What would be the situation of an illegi”

tiraate child whose father having acknowledged, as here, was a
military officer or Foreign Service officer moving from one
place to another all over the world, and so he arranged to have
the children, when they were in their teens, for example, to be
in private schools in -the school year and summer camps in the
summer --MRS. SHAPIRO;

That would be considered to be living

with in a normal parent-child relationship.
QUESTION;

It’s not --

It would be?

MRS. SHAPIRO;

Yes, it would foe.

It's not that they

hava to b© under the earn© house, same roof.
QUESTION;
gave me earlier.

That’s not consistent with the answer you

You said in a hypothetical case of a man who

paid their support but had then live somewhere, they would bs

MRS. SHAPIRO;

Wall, if the situation is that they

ar© in school ©r in summer camp or in another situation that's
similar to what happens with normal, in a normal parent-child
relationship —
QUESTION;

D© you know whether there ara any ad­

ministrative decisions that would be consistent with your
answer in these eases?

17
MRS. SHAPIRO:

I'm not aware of any that go along

this line.
QUESTION:

I got the impression from your earlier'

discussion that lived with meant precisely that, lived with in
the normal,, what you said ,

normal and ordinary parent-child

relationship.
MRS. SHAPIRO:

I don't think that sanding a child to

school with the intent,

on summer vacations or whan it's

feasible, they will resum© the normal relationship of living
together in the seme house, is inconsistent with living with in
the normal parent-child relationship.
QUESTION:

All we're dealing with is children under

18 years of age, ar® w® not?1

It's not the question about a 30™

year-old child who might have lived with for 18 years and then
simply became emancipated?
MRS. SHAPIRO:

No, no, and fch© statute does hav® a

provision as th® Social Security Act doss for children over 18
who are in school and for students, they are continued, the
benefits continue until they reach 22, I believe it is.

But

■

the point is that what the act is looking -''for is an indication
that, this is a normal family relationship that these children
ar© being treated as children usually are, that they g© to
school and go to camp, that they'r® still children in the family.
QUESTION:

If fchs people in these hypothetical

18
situations were treated that way, then they are making an in­
dividualised judgment and not a rigid, categorical judgment.
If they ’re going behind the lived-with requirement in consider­
ing evidence that the father is really paying for their support
but doesn't want to maintain or can’t maintain a hone, famil­
ial hone —
MRS. SHAPIRO:
situations.

I think you’ve got two different

The situation that X thought you were referring

to originally is a situation in which the child is living
either in a foster home or in some other situation —
QUESTION;

Let’s say living with his grandmother, but

the father is paying abundantly for his support.
MRS. SHAPIRO:

With no intent that they’re ever

going to resume living together —■
QUESTION:

Just exactly what I’ve told you.

MRSe SHAPIRO:

Well, in that case, that doesn’t

sound to m® -- again, this is something for the Agency — but
it doesn’t sound to me ilk© th© normal parent-child relation­
ship, in contrast to the situation where you’re sanding a
child to school, or sending him to camp, and when ha’s through
with that he comes hem®,
QUESTION:

They ar© two distinct situations.

Well, did you say that there’s an

acknowledged illegitimate child living with the father at th®
time of his death but h@ isn’t supporting the child.

lar parent-child relationship?

If h@es living with him; yes.

Well, h© isn't supporting him,» he's just

As a matter of fact, he isn't supporting

himself.
MRS. SHAPIRO:
say "•support.5'

Well, the statute doesn’t specifically

The statute says —

QUESTION:

It says “regular parent-child relation­

ship. "
MRS. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

Yes, but —

What do you mean by that?

MRS. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

That refers to the living with.

So it isn’t open to the government to

deny benefits on the ground that the father isn't actually
supporting the child?
MRS. SHAPIRO:

Not if he’s living in the same house­

hold with him, or in this other situation.
The Tucker Act gives the Court of Claims jurisdiction
over a claim against the United States founded on the Consti­
tution or an act of Congress.

There must b® money already due

th© plaintiff from the government before the Court of Claims
has jurisdiction.

If it has jurisdiction because money is

cue, the Court of Claims may also grant prospective relief, but

20

only as an ancillary remedy.
This means that the Court of Claims her© could proparly order the government to put Shawn and /Tricia Clark on
the Civil Service annuity rolls only if they had an accrued
claim based on soai© statute or on the Constitution against the
government for money already due them, and they did not.
The Court of Claims believed that the children's
claim for accrued benefits was bassd on fcfea Civil Service Re­
tirement Act read in the light of the Constitution,

But that

makes an unconstitutional intent to deny benefits into an in­
tent to grant benefits.

Whether or not th© statutory denial

of benefits to the illegitimate children who were not living
with the wage earner is constitutional, that denial is what
Congress enacted, and only Congress and not a court can change
it Into a statutory direction to pay benefits.
A court can decide that th© lived-with requirement
unconstitutionally discriminates ©gainst illegitimate children,
so that th® act can no longer foe enforced as written.

And if

a, District Court reaches that conclusion, it. can enjoin th©
agency from continuing to make th© unconstitutional discrimina­
tion required by th© act.

But of course, that's an. independent

injunction power -chat th© Court of Claims doesn't have.
QUESTIONS

What would that mean, Mrs. Shapiro, they

just don't pay any more child benefits?

21
MRS. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:
you recommend?

Wall, that's on® alternative.

That's the alternative, isn't it, that

Pay no more child's benefits until the statute

is mad© constitutional?
MRS. SHAPIRO:

That's if, in a suit in the Court of

Claims, our submission is that th© Court of Claims is the wrong
court in which t© ha presenting this claim.
QUESTION:

It has no jurisdiction?

MRS. SHAPIRO:

It had no jurisdiction, because there

was no accrued claim —
QUESTION:

It's jurisdiction is for claims for money

based upon feh© constitutionally raised action?
MRS. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

Exact.

But your position is that the plaintiff

should then go to another forum and get an injunction against
paying any child benefits to anybody?

That's what would have

to be don® if the —
MRS. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

In fact, that th© —

You think that's what Congress would have

wanted in this situation?
MRS. SHAPIRO:

In this particular situation, these

for the Clark children ar<a presumably part of th© Jenkins
class, and the Jenkins case is in the District Court —• it's
in fell© Court of Appeals now.

22
QUESTION:

But you argue there, do you, does the

Government argu© there that all child benefits should cease
until Congress r®nedi®s the situation?
MRS. SHAPIRO:

No? what wa're arguing in Jenkins is

that the benefits have been? they have been paid since
December first, 1977 under the Proctor decision.
QUESTION:

Without statutory authority, according to

your present argument.
MRS. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

That's right.

Your argument there, I take it, then, is

that no benefits should b© paid.
MRS. SHAPIRO:

The argument there is that no bene-

fits should be paid before Deoamber 1, 1977.
QUESTION:

But why ©van currently?

What's the

statutory authority for current benefits?
MRS. SHAPIRO:

It's not a statutory authority.

fch© standard doctrine of severability.

That's

As I say, when a court

finds that the denial of benefits, that the discriminatory
treatment is unconstitutional, then it can, as an alternative
to holding that no b@ns.fits ar® payable, it can direct that
benefits to® paid either to all children — well, in this
situation you could have either benefits paid to all legitimate
children who meat the lived-with requirement? that is, you
apply fch® qualification equally to all children.

23
QUESTION;

Well* assume these plaintiffs ware not in

the Court of Claims but were in the Federal District Court,
and assume they win on th® merits:

What remedy would be appro­

priate in the Government's view?
MRS. SHAPIRO;

If these children were in the District

Court?
QUESTION %

Yes.

MRS. SHAPIRO;

Well, then the Court would have two

alternatives, and w@ would not argue that the lived-with re­
quirement should b@ applied to all children.

Wq would agree

that it would be appropriate under the injunction power to
require payment to those children, even though they couldn't
meet the statutory requirements.
QUESTION;

The Court would have the alternative of

saying, of enjoining any payments to any children at all?
MRS. SHAPIRO;
QUESTION;

Any payments to any —

That alternative was illustrated in a

case last term in which Justice Powell disagreed with the
holding of th© Court.
MRS. SHAPIRO?
QUESTION;

I beliav© that's —

Mrs. Shapiro, we have had a number of

cases, you can almost learn who has been Secretary of HEW from
the cases, Weinbtrger, Matthews, Califano, et cetera, and many
of them hav© involved challenges to congressional limitations

24
on payments t© illegitimate children.

Have any of them up to

now ever been brought in the Court of Claims?
MRS. SHAPIRO:

1 don't believe so, I don’t think they

have.
QUESTION

Scm® w@r@ three-judge courts, perhaps all

of them? I’m not sure.
MRS. SHAPIRO;

Yes.

I'm not sure that all of them

were.
QCJEST10H;

In answer Mr. Justice Stevens in what

remedy would be available in the District Court, you said the
Court would have a choice and it could order the payment of
benefits.

How about back benefits?
MRS. SHAPIRO:

No.

That is barred by sovereign im­

munity, and that’s the same argument in the District Court.
It’s not a jurisdictional argument because the District Court
does have the jurisdiction -QUESTION:

But you say that erven if the District

Court decided that you'd been incorrectly construing the act
and that you should have been paying these benefits the entire
time, the District Court could not enter a judgment for past
benefits?
MRS. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

Precissly.

Because as you construe the act, Congress

has not waived sovereign immunity to that extent?

25
MRSo SHAPIROs

That's exactly right* yes

,

that the

waiver of sovereign immunity under 5 USC 702 extends only to
injunctions for the future.
QUESTION;

Is there some authority for that?

Well* we read this Court's decision in

On your hypothesis* responding to Mr.

MRS. SHAPIROs

For retroactive benefits.

Th© Coart

of Claims* as I say* is the wrong court, but if you had a de­
cision in the District Court you could get future payment* buf­
fer retroactive payments, it's only Congress, whether it’s a
private bill, whether it's amendment of a statute saying that
they intend to have it be paid retroactively.

At time the Court of Claims, not in fches©

situations but. in some where back payments were involved* have

ORAL ARGUMENT BY EDWARD L. MERRIGAN, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR. MERRIGAN;

Mr. Chief Justice, may it pleas® the

Court, just a brief word about the facts, Your Honors, and I
think tli© Court fully understands this case from th© questions
that you propounded to th© Government, th© two Federal employees
involved in this eas®, one was the father, Mr. Isaacson, th©
other was the lady involved, Miss Patricia liana Clark, both
worked for the Veterans Administration at Fort Harrison,
Montana, aid they commenced to live together in 1965 and early
1966, and during th© period of time they lived together they
had th® two children, Shawn Clark and Tricia Clark.
They continued to live together with th© children in
a. regular husband-wife, parent-child relationship for th© world ’
to know through 1971.

In 1971 Mr, Isaacson moved out of the

common dwelling and Mrs. Clark brought a paternity action in
fch® Court in Montana.

Mr. Isaacson while alive appear©! in

that case, was represented by counsel.

Th© Court entered a

paternity order against Mr. Isaacson which specifieally declared
him to be th© father of these two children.

Then by stipulation

27
and judgment of the. Court, he was ordered to pay $5,000, re­
presenting th® back support payments he owed the children for
the time he had moved out of the house.

He then stipulated and

was ordered by the Court to pay $120 a month for their future
support.

He then stipulated and vas order by th® Court to make

them the beneficiaries of two lif© insurance policies, on® a
V

Mew York Lif© Insurance Company policy and th© other his
Federal Government Employees Group policy.
He make all of th© support payments to the children
from that time forward to his death, not directly but by de­
ductions or allotments out of his Federal salary, up to the
time of his death in 1974 in an automobile accident.
QUESTION:

Sir, would you say that he was doing what

was suggested in som® of the hypothetical questions?

That is,

h© was providing support for them without providing a familial
hone for them .
MR. MERRIGANs

H© did everything for th® children

except marry the mother and continua to actually live with
them physically until th© date of his death, from about 1972
to 874.

He was a father in ©vary sense of the word, by

Court order, by support, payments, by living with them for a
long period of time, and th® Government in this case, in its
reply brief, concedes that there is no need under the livedwith requirement of th® statute for a permanent living-wit h.

28

The Government concedes that it can be a temporary or a period
ic separation in that relationship without breaking the chain,
supposedly.

This has never been judicially declared, but the

Government concadas it in its reply brief,
QUESTION:

But the difference of opinion between you

is that the lived-with has to be at the time of the death?
MR. MERRXG&N:

Well, I think if you construe the

statute itself —
QUESTION:

And you say not?

MR. MERRIGAN:

— Mr. Justice Stewart, if you con­

strue the statute —
QUESTION:

Well, isn’t that, have I correctly

identified the difference of opinion?
MR. MERRIGAN:

That’s the difference.

When we sued

in the Court of Claims, we specifically asked the Court to
award a judgment here based on an act of Congress with the
lived-with requirement in the law, because we say that th®
lived-with — it says "lived with," it doesn’t say "lived with
or living with" in the statuto, it says "lived with,"

And

har® the Court and Government and everybody involved concedes
that they lived with, there was that open to the world, lived
with in the past.
I think the problem that w® run into in this case is
th® construction given to the statute by the Civil Service

29
Coram is sion, which says —
QUESTION:

Well* then, by the Court of Claims?

HR. MERRIGAN:

Well* not really by the Court of

Claims.
QUESTION:

How could they have held it unconstitution™

al had fchay not construed it the way the Government does?
MR. MERRIGAN:

Well, I think the statute was declared

unconstitutional in Gentry.

There’s no long discussion of the

constitutionality in our case because they simply adopted
QUESTION:

No long discussion of it, but as a matter

of logic, how could they have?
MR. MERRIGAN:

They simply held that the lived-with

requirement, as I ara going to try to point out to Your Honor
in a moment, is simply a total bar to any recovery for illegi­
timates in 90 percent of the cases, by the very term "illlgitimata, '* meaning that the father and mother are not married.
In more than 90 percent of the cases the father is either
married to somebody ©Is©, or ha's a bachelor who doesn't Want
to marry the mother and is therefor© living somewhere else, and
so if you can't meet tha livad-with requirement with the
father, you're totally barred from benefits at all.
QUESTION:

But you're now arguing that your clients

can meet the lived-with requirement?
MR. MERRIGAN:

We say that in this case, truly,

30
jurisdiction in this casa, I think, this case should be set­
tled in our judgment, if we can propose to the Court, that if
you looked at the statute and construed that they had lived
with for the period of time that we just referred to, that
there was this support, that they did meet the requirement of
the statute and therefore the Court of Claims clearly had
jurisdiction, because wa're suing on an act of Congress, we're
including the lived-with requirement and therefore they're en­
titled to judgment under 28 USC 91.
QUESTIONi

You are seeking to support the judgment on

a different ground than the Coxrtrt of Claims gave you judgment?
MR. MERRIGAN:

I say that this Court could, if it

wanted to, avoid the constitutional question

in this case, say

that the statute properly construed should have granted judg­
ment here without reaching the constitutional question.
QUESTION:

What if the father had lived with the

child for the first, three months of its life and then not lived
with it for -the subsequent 17 years, 9 months of its life, and
the child was 18 at the tim© of the father’s death?
MR. MERRIGANs

When you start these types of require­

ments .in/' the statute obviously, as you change the facts,

it

gets-either. worse or it gets batter.
QUESTION:
draw lines?

*es.

fsn8t that just why Congress has to

MR. MERRXGANs

Well# Congress didn't draw the line

at lived with or living with.

The amendment that is now pro-

posed in Congress today talks in terms of living with, meaning
that —

Well# no one has any claim under an amend­

ment that is proposed in Congress today, do they?

amendment as proposed today.
of lived with.

The statute today speaks in terms

The amendment proposed in Congress today is

talking in terms of living with.
QUESTIONs

But the Agency construction of the present

language is living with?
MR. MERRIGAN:
act of Congress.

Living with.

I think -they changed the

And what I am trying to say to Your Honor is

that if we wanted to avoid the constitutional issue in this
case, as we originally sued in our petition to the Court of
Claims# is that these children truly in this case meet the
statutory requirements.

If that b@ true, everything that Ms.

Shapiro said this morning about the jurisdiction of fch© Court
of Claims automatically falls, because we are suing on an. act
of Congress.
QUESTION;

Did the Court of Claims reject your con­

struction of the statute in Gentry?
MR. MERRIGAN:

No, Your Honor.

32
QUESTION:

I know you weren't in Gentry, but was that

issue before the Court of Claims?
MR. MERRIGANs

No, it was not because the children

never lived with the parent in Gentry.
What happened is, by the time —
QUESTION %

But the Court of Claims, in effect, then,

in this case rejected your statutory claim?
MR. MERRIGAN:
on it, Your Honor.
QUESTION?

What happened is, we moved •—
What maskas you think it didn't?

MR. MERRIGANs
Your Honor, 1st this?

No, the Court of Claims did not pass

What I think happened in our case,

Between the time we filed our petition

in the Court of Claims and the fcixa© they rendered summary judg­
ment, this statuta had been declared unconstitutional five
times.
QUESTION:

Ar© you suggesting that any Federal Court

has the authority to reach a constitutional issue without first
passing on a necesearily included statutory question?
MR. MERRIGANs

I think in this case, if Your Honors

will look at the judgment in this cas©, which is of course in
th® appendix’, what happened her®, the Court of Claims had
previously ruled th© lived-with provision to be unconstitution­
al, and therefore, rather than reconstrue or apply th® provision

33

in our case, they deemed it to have been declared unconstitu­
tional in the past.
QUESTION:

Doesn't that mean they were adopting the

Gentry approach?
MR. MERRXGAN:

There's no question but that the

Court of Claims in our case ruled that the statute was uncon­
stitutional.

I am suggesting to Your Honors that we have been

swept, under the facts of this case, if you construe this
statute to mean lived with to cover the facts of our case, that
we meet the terms of the statute without idle constitutional is­
sue being raised, and if that b© true, there's no question but
that the Court of Claims had jurisdiction under 28 USC 1491?
there's no question that this Court would not have jurisdic­
tion under 12S2 of Title 28 because, of course, there is no
constitutional issue raised if you would decide this case on
that basis.
But I am not trying to avoid the constitutional is­
sue, because when you move on to that issue in this casa, the
lived-with requirement which .is the only teat as to whether or
not an .illegitimate child can recover, for all practical pur­
poses, is a total bar to almost all illegitimates, because
what it means, in most cases, is, an illegitimate child is a
child of a mother and father who are not married, in more than
90 parcent of the cases do not live together.

Under th® lav/s of

34
most States, the mother has custody of the child.

In most

cases the father is either living with another xdfe or living
as a bachelor who does not want to live with the woman who had
the child, and so the poor child is left without a father,
without the ability to live with, without the ability to meet
the test in any circumstance.
So by making the lived-with requirement alone the
test, it's the equivalent of striking out most illegitimates'
ability to recover under the statuta at all, and I think that's
what's made five courts in the Federal system, two of then
three™judge courts, declare this statute uniformly unconstitu­
tional.
Son© of the questions Your Honors have asked make it
clear a Federal employee, for example, who did want to live
with the child, who was assigned to Saudi Arabia in his. govern­
ment job would be over there, the child would be here with the
mother.

Not eligible.
A government employee who has no home, who travels

all the time, the child lives with the mother:

No ability for

the child to recover the benefits.
In other cases where the parents lived together for
a long period of time, ten years, twelve years, and then the
father suddenly moves out in a spat with the mother, no ability
for th© child to recover because he can't show he was physically

35
living with the child at the moment of death.
Now* the Government says children can protect them­
selves against that* that they can insist that they live with
the father.

Well, here is a three-year-old child, six-year-

old child, "Mother, I insist on living with mv father to pro­
tect my Federal annuity."

Or, "Father, 1 insist on you letting

me move in with you to protect my Federal annuity."

That's

%

what the Government is asking us to do in this case.
Your Honors, as far as the statute itself is clearly
enacted by Congress to protect dependents who are looking to
tha deceased employe© for support.

In this case we have the

order of the Montana Court decreeing support.

W© have the

support being made throughout the employee's life, right up to
his death through allotments out of his Federal salary, so
there’s no guesswork on the part of the Government as to whe­
ther he was supporting the children, it came from his salary.
Then vm have the father in the life insurance policy,
tii© Federal Group Life Insurance policy, paying after death
for 'the support of the children, and yet they have been denied
the. benefits in this case on the ground that they simply did
not physically live with him at the moment of death,
Th® Government says perhaps spurious claims are
prevented by this sort of a statute.

Well, let’s taka the

case that is so well known today of young women moving in with

a Federal employees let's say bringing in a small child that
she had front some other relationships and then the Federal em­
ployee dies.
nuity.

So th® mother says* "Chance for a Federal an­

This child was the Federal employee's child? wa ware

living with him at the time of his death, and therefore 2 want
the annuity.”
Under th© statute, that's all she had to say if she's
willing to lie, because then she could show they were living
together in a regular parent-child relationship •—

She has to prove the father acknowledged

MR. MERRIGAN%

It could be proved spuriously.

is th© only suggestion I ha making, Your Honor.

That

I'm not trying

to say that this sort of claim should be set up, but 1 think
the statute promotes it.
QUESTIONs

What about th© word "recognise" th® step­

child or reccgnias natural child:
by th© natural father?

Doesn't that, mean recognise

37
MR. MERRIGAN:
QUESTION;

I just assumed it did.

MR. MERRIGANs
QUESTION:

Recognised

Right.

So the shear hypothetical case, the woman

would not recover?
MR. MERRIGANs

The woman could recover on other

grounds, because adopted children or stepchildren could be in­
cluded in the same lived-with requirement, but I say, all I'm
trying to say, Your Honor, is that opens the door for spurious
claims on the ground that children that were not really the
children of that particular father ware living with him at the
time of death, and th® mother then can fabricate a claim around
it.
All I am trying to say is — I'm not trying to say
this should foa allowed? I ha not trying to say that a spurious
claim is a sound claim.

What I am trying to say is that this

particular type of statute promotes that particular typ© of
claim.
QUESTION %

But she would have to perjure herself

both as to the question whether the father was the actual
father and as to whether he recognised th© child.
MR. MERRIGANs
QUESTION*

Well, Your Honor, I think that's true.

I mean, presumably there ar© an awful lot

of lawsuits, you can imagine, that could go off on an unjust

38
result as a result of perjury which wasn't detected by the
finder of fact.
MR. MERRIGANs

I raise the possibility on3.y because

one of the defenses for this statute here is that it was en­
acted to promote and — to protect the Government, rather —
cigainst spurious claims.
QUESTIOH2

Well, you don't need a broad holding here

to support your position.

All you need is that a child who

has been legally recognised by a Court, your finding —
MR. MERRIGAN2

No question, Your Honor.

No question.

1 think wa fit, in this particular case, every requirement
that could possibly b® made for an Illegitimate child.

There

was the living together; there was the parent- child relation­
ship; there was the decree of the Montana Court; and there was
the support payment, not only .through death but after death
through fcha insurance.
QUESTION2

How does the Commission construe the

word ‘'recognised” — doss it require some formal act of recog­
nition by the father or by a court?
MR. MERRIGANs

How does it construe it?

I truly don't know that, Your Honor,

because —
QUESTIONS

But in all these hypothetical© you give,

the recognition is rather important, isn't it?

MR. MERRIGAN:

Well, it is rather important.

I

would QUESTION;

You have an easy case, but you’ve been

arguing with a rather broad brush, I suggest.
MR. MERRIGAN;

The word "recognition," I think, is

el ear cut in any case where you have an order of filiation •—
QUESTION;

It’s elearcufc here, yes.

MR. MERRIGAN;
QUESTION;

— such as you have in Montana.

Yes, but this

sk ample

you gave of moving

in and dying and the wife coining along and saying what you say
she said —
MR. MERRIGAN:

I want you to understand, Your Honor,

that that idea didn’t only originate with me.

It was discussed

in the Proctor decision; it waa discussed in the Gentry deci­
sion, as things that could happen.
QUESTION;

All you are saying today is that there

roust be a court order, so far as you are concerned?
MR. MERRIGAN:

Certainly, where there is a court order

there can b© no further doubt.

I think the other thing is the

shewing of actual support, that he contributed to support, and
what the Government is now proposing to Congress and it’s al­
ready passed the House and is wall along in the Senate is that
there be a living with as opposed to lived with, and that
there b@ a showing that h© contributed to fch® support of th©

40
child prior to death,
I suggest fco you that that is going to require a
rather case-by-ce.se determination.

It is not exactly the uni ­

form presentation that would usually be required under these
other statutes.
So, Your Honors, where I think we find outselves in
this case is this:

Here we have five Federal courts in the

past that have uniformly held the present statute to b© uncon­
stitutional, and as a result, all of the children in those
cases are now recognized to receive their benefits under the
statute.
On the right, wa hav© the Agency itself seeking an
amendment to the law that will protect all children in the
future, and that may be the law before this Court acts in this
case.

So w© find ourselves right in the middle of -the law as

it has been interpreted by other Federal courts uniformly in
the past, and as Congress is changing it in the future, and wa
urge this Court for all of the reasons I stated either to up­
hold the Court of Claims decision on the constitutional issue,
or to construe this statute and avoid the constitutional issue
to say that under the facts of this case as conceded on the
record by the Government, these children would be entitled to
judgment under the statute, even with the unconstitutional pro
vision in it

41
On the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims, just
briefly, there is no question but that the Court of Claims
under section 1491 of Title 28 has elearcut jurisdiction over
any claim based on an act of Congress.

It has elearcut juris­

diction on any claim based on the Constitution of the United
States.

What the Court of Claims ruled in Gentry is that this

particular provision is a relatively minor provision of the
statute which was enacted by Congress to provide support to
children of deceased Federal employees.

It was a severable

provision, and it severed this provision, and with that
severed provision out, then it granted judgment based on that
act of Congress.
And I urge the Court that that is correct law —
QUESTION!

That8s not the act that Congress legis­

lated?
ME. MERRIGANs

Well, Your Honor, the Court of Claims

has jurisdiction to render judgments on the Constitution as
well as on the —
QUESTION:

There's nothing in the Constitution that

entitles your clients to payment of any kind for anything.

Amendment.

42
QUESTION:

But not as. an —

QUESTION:

Do you think th® Constitution would re­

quire th© Treasury to draw a check for your clients without
any act of Congress in establishing a social security system?
MR, MERRIGANs
Your Honor,

No, I don’t think that’s true at all,

I think —

QUESTION %

Then how can you say this is a claim

founded on the Constitution?
MR. MERRIGANs

I say that -this is a claim found ad on

the act of Congress with the power of fch© Court of Claims to
sever an unconstitutional provision from that statute.

In the

Teston case, for example, Your Honor, which is the case that
was .referred to by Mrs. Shapiro, in that case there was a claim
by Federal employees that they had been misclassified by the
Civil Service Commission,
Well, there was no statute that gave than any right
of recovery based on a misclassification of position, and
therefore there was no statute.

Here the judgment of the

Court of Claims is firmly grounded on the very statute Congress
passed.
QUESTION*

But you say they had to declare that it was

unconstitutional in order to get to it?
MR."''MERRIGANs
QUESTION*

Not th® whole statute, Your Honor,

You know, this is a large statute.

They

43
had to declare one section of the statute unconstitutional,
MR. MERRIGANs

They declared a tiny sentence in this

statute.
QUESTION:

Well, a section of the statute —

MR. MERKIGAH:
QUESTION:

A section of the statute was —

-- which bore on your clients rights.

MR. MERRIGAN:

That's right.

Eut what I am trying

to say to Your Honor, then, they then pegged their decision
very firmly on that act of Congress with the voided provision
out of it, and I think that there they do hcive the right, be­
cause they do have the power to consider claims based on the
Constitution as well as acts of Congress, to look at an act of
Congress, to declare a section which is clearly violative of
the Fifth Amendment void, and then to grant a judgment against
the United States founded on that act of Congress.
QUESTION:

•. ,

Is it correct to say that your argu­

ment comes down to whether die statute is severable, whether
that section is severable, and if it is, then you say the
jurisdictional question is resolved?
MR. MERRIGANs
QUESTION s

I think that's correct,

That was the Court of Claims * argument in

Gentry?
MR. MERRIGAN:
QUESTION:

That's entirely correct.

That was their own conclusion?

44
Without being able to cite any prior authority to that
effect?
MR. MERRIGANs

I think the Court of Claims did cite

some authorities to that effect, although they escape my mind
at th© moment.
QUESTION:

Yes, it may have.

QUESTION:

Th® Court of Claims certainly has had a

propensity throughout its life to try to expand its jurisdic­
tion, hasn't it?
MR, MERRIGAN:

Well, I hope we won't find this case

as the limiting factor on that propensity.
QUESTION:

Do you recall Judge Skelton's concurring

position?
MR. MERRIGANs
QUESTION:

I do recall it, Your Honor.

Did you present that position in your case

or not?
MR. MERRIGANs

We relied on Gentry totally, as well

as the concurring opinion of Judge Skelton.
QUESTION:

So you said not only should the statute

be construed to award benefits when the living-with occurred
any time*, but you also argued that the statute should be
construed to permit proof of support in any case?
MR. MERRXGAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor,

Because the Court of Claims apparently

45
rejected that position in Gentry, but you represented it in
your case, anyway?
MR. MERRIGAM;

We did.

We relied totally on the

Gentry decision and, in fact, I think what happened in our case
is the Court of Claims looking at five straight Federal deci­
sions on the subject didn’t reach the construction of the
statute that we urged on it? it simply ruled on the constitu­
tional issue.
Thank you. Your Honor.
QUESTIONs

Mr. Merrigan, you haven't addressed your­

self orally, unless I missed it, to the question of sovereign
immunity with respect to the back payments.
MR. MERRIGAN;

Your Honor, clearly the statute itself

provides for payments from the moment of death of the Federal
employee.

The act was passed for that purpose.

intended the act for that purpose.

The Congress

There was no withholding

of sovereign immunity on the liability of the Federal Govern­
ment for such payments, and the only way that sovereign immunity
comes into this is a claim that, like in Teston, where there
was no statute at all, therefore there is the sovereign immunity
claim of no ability of the Court of Claims to judge it.
What we’re trying to say here is the provision was
severable.

There is an act of Congress.

There is a direction

of the Congress that they be paid back to the date of death.

46

Can you imagina construing this, the lav/, in such a
fashion that we hav© nowhere to do to collect a true debt of
the United States —
QUESTION?

Wall, that's what sovereign immunity

means, you have nowhere to go if the only person who would
otherwise be liable' to you is the,sovereign, and he assarts his
immunity?

That's exactly what, sovereign immunity means.
MR. MERRXGAN;

And that usually arises in a case

where there is no statute passed by the Congress authorising
the payment of the debt of the United States, and here there
is a clearcut debt of the United States running back to the
very day that the employe® died.
QUESTION?

Otherwise the Government could come in

and say, of course you're within fch© class that was intended
to be benofitted by this statute, and w® owe you the money,
but you just can't su© for it.
MR. MERRIGAN;

I think that's generally correct.

And by idle way -QUESTION?

That would be the position?

MR, MERRIGAN?

That would be it.

And by the way,

with that, Your Honor, w© would then be scooped into a class
of, I don't know how many employees» some of whom have com­
pletely different positions than we have, on all of the facte,
In other words, here we have a showing of support,

47
w® have a showing of lived with and so forth and so on, a class
would be so general that we may fall with -the class, and even
under the new statute we may somehow fall with the class.

And

so I think that the Gentry decision is a sound decision# I
think it treated th© question of sovereign immunity# it treated
the question of the Court's jurisdiction correctly# and w®
urge the Court to affirm us, and I think what we’re really
here about is an appeal from Gentry# which the Government
never took# the Government never took any appeals from any of
th© other decisions in the past

up to this on©# and I think

that we:Jre now trying to carry on our shoulders all of the
claims that go the whole way back to Gentry.
QUESTIONS

This lawsuit wasn’t brought as a class

action?
MR. MERRIGASJ;

No, Your Honor# it was not.
