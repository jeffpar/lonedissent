ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN M» ANDERSON, ESQ» »
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR» ANDERSON:

Thank you0

Mr» Chief Justice and may

it please the Court:
It has been six months sine® this Court first heard
oral argument in this ease?

And for that reason, with the

Court’s permission, I will take a minute or two to offer a
brief summary of the facts relevant to the issue before this
Court; namely, whether a private right of action may be implied
under this Investment Advisers Act of 1940»
This Court learned last March this case came to
Court in April, 1973 with a suit by the Plaintiff and
Respondent Harry Lewis asking legal and equitable relief for
alleged violation of the Investment Advisers Act»
The Petitioners moved to dismiss the complaint for
failure to state a claim and argued that Mortgage Trust of
America was and is a mortgage lender which does not deal in
securities within the meaning of tbs Federal securities laws)
that Traaeamarica Mortgage Advisers, its adviser, is- not a,
public, investment adviser in’ any sense of that word; that the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940 does not apply to the

4

Petitioners ox to the facts of this case; that the Respondent
Lewis had failed to make proper demand on the Trustees of
Mortgage Trust of America and that the Investment Advisers
Act of 1940 does not afford a private right of action in any
evento
The District Court noted that the Petitioners'
arguments had what were called “substantial merit", font ruled
that since the Advisers Act does not afford a private right of
action that the other questions would not foe decided<,
On appeal, Petitioners again argued that the Invest­
ment Advisers Act does not apply to the Petitioners or to the
facts of this case, and that there is no private right of
actiono
The Court of Appeals also declined to consider the
other arguments just mentioned and ruled» with one Judge
dissenting, "Implication of a private right of action for
injunctive relief and damages under the Advisers Act in favor
of appropriate plaintiffs is necessary to. achieve the goals
of Congress in enacting legislation»”
The decision and the dissent of the Court of App-u'
is based on and, indeed, simply incorporates the decision of
fch@ Second Circuit and the dissent in the Second Circuit in
a case known as $g>ra£amgior»: v»
As I had occasion to state last March» this case
presents a narrow technical question of law and a broad

5

important question of judicial policyo

The narrow question of

law presented is whether a private right of action may be
implied undssr Section 206 of the Investment Advisers Act of
1940«

The question of judicial policy presented is whether

this Court should imply a right of action under the Advisers
Act and than leave to further litigation resolution of such
/

.1

/

questions as who may bring the action.,, who may be named a '
defendant, allocations, od burdens of proof» the evidentiary
standards to be applied and the damages that may be recoverad.
QUESTION:

Are you suggesting that if

Congress had not either expressly or impliedly created a cause
of action that this Court could do so?
MR, AHDEESOK*

It’s ay belief, Mr. Justice

Refcnquist, that Congress has had an opportunity on -numerous
occasions both when the Act was originally passed and since
that time to consider and act on whether or not a private right
of action is appropriate here. As re .point out in our brief,
on each occasion.it hah net created -- expressly not created
and implied a cause of action and, for that reason, we take the
position that this Court is not in a position to make that
judgment, if you will, that there ought to be a private right
of action,
7. might further answer that question and refer back

to the language of the Court of Appeals in this case, where
the Court of Appeals said that it mad® the judgment that it

€

was necessary to have this implied right of action in order to
carry out the purposes of the act,

and I question it, with all

due respectwhether this Court is in a position to substitute
its judgment, or the Court of appeals was in a position to
substitute its judgment for what seems to be the judgment of
the Congress on six different occasions since 1940 that there
should not be an express or a right of private action under
the Investment Advisers Act,
QUESTION:

Didn't Professor Loss

in his

testimony, suggest that Congress should do just that, just
leave the matter open and let the Courts decide it?
MRo ANDERSON:

Yes, Professor Loss

suggested in

his testimony to the Committe® hearing on legislation that was
proposed, 7 believe, in 1966 that it might facilitate — I
believe those., are hie words

implication of a privata right

>

of action if Congress, at that time would add the words "action
at law"lto th® jurisdiction and venue provision of tha statute.
But 7 think th© suggestion that facilitation would tab© place
is a telling admission that it does not exist otherwise,
Now, for this Court to imply private right of action
under th® Investment Advisors Act, it would necessarily
engender uncertainty as well as causa delay and undoubtedly
*

add to th© expense of the parties involved and in general
frustrate' the very right which is suggested here should be

\

implied.

7

And I say that because to imply a private right of
action must necessarily in fch® context of thjLs case leave
opes all of those questions which Congress very well could
spell out, could delineate-, could define as it did when it
created a, private right of action under the Investment Company
Act of 1970.
This engendering of uncertainty comes against a
background of statutory language which is unique to the
Investment Advisers Act and which confers jurisdiction on the
Federal courts for only one legal purpose -- the jurisdictional
provision of the Investment Advisers Act limits the juris­
diction to a suit in equity to enjoin violations of the Act,
That language is unique to the Investment Advisers Act and.it
is distinguishable from each of the other Federal- securities
laws»
The other laws, the other Acts all provide that the
jurisdiction shall extend to all suits in equity and actions
at law brought to enforce any liability or duty created under
each of those Acts.
The addition or the omission of the language action
at law brought to enforce any duty or liability, we are told
in the case of .Touche Ross v, Aedinaton ought not to be read
as the creation of a private right of action, but we contend
that it remains an important indication of Congressional
intent

8

Mow the Respondent’s only explanation for the
difference in the language between the Investment Advisers Act
of 1940 and the other Federal securities laws, to which I have
just referred, is that it was either an unintentional oversight
by an unidentified draftsman and that the section itself really

has no legislative history worthy of the name*

Mow, the

importance of the Advisers Act’s special language is reenforced
by an examination of that Act’s legislative history.
How, a typical anthropologist, the counsel in this
case has sifted through the legislative history, through the
sands and the pebbles, if you will, of the legislative history,
and they have found artifacts to support their position in
eaoh direction.

But the important part of that search, or to

take the metaphor on© step further, that dig is that the
proponents of an affirmative private right of actions for
damages in this case or for equitable relief have been unable
to point to any one solid evidence or one solid piece of
testimony or anything that would approach solid indication
that the Congress intended that the Act serve as a spring­
board of private actions by disgruntled investors.
But there is one other artifact on the other side
that «a believe to ba particularly important, and that is the
amendment to the Investment Company Act in 1970 in which the
Congress expressly created a private right of action under the
Investment Company Act, the companion statute to the Investment

©

advisors act.
The 3.970 amendment to the Investment Company act
added a private right of action to the Investment Company act,
but no private right of action to the Advisers Act *

This

addition of a private right of action to the Investment Company
act included Congressional attention to each of those unknown
factors to which I referred earlier.
When Congress acted in I©?0, it defined the duty or
the standard of conduct, it defined the class of plaintiffs,
parties who could sue; it defined the class of defendants who
could foe sued;it allocated the burden of proof? it established
the evidentiary standards that must foe met by th© plaintiff?
and It prescribed th© damages which could fee recoverable,
QUESTION:

Haven’t some of the decisions of this
#

Court said that what Congress did or didn’t do 2S or 30 years
after the Act on which the parties are relying isn’t of great
significanee?
MR. ANDERSOHt

That’s correct, Mr. Justice Rehnquis ■

however, as recently of June, I believe it was, in the ease
of g.Q.uoha...Ro,‘S« V» Re.di.uc? ton. the Court ruled that, and
instructed, if you will, counsel to look to the context in
which a statute was enacted or to look at the context in which
it appears.

Th© exact words are to call attention to the

statutory scheme of which the statute was a part.
QUESTIONS

But that would foe the 1940 Act here,

3.0

wouldn’t it,?
MRo ANDERSON:

Yes,

and in 1940, of course, there

was no private right of action created under the Investment
Company act either.

But I think it significant that in 1970,

in the course of amending both the Investment Advisers Act and
the Investment Company Act that the Congress expressly created
a private right of action against certain investment advisers
under the Investment Company Act.

And it seems to me that if

Congress had intended that there be, or wanted there to be, if
you will, a private right of action under the Investment
Advisers Act, that would have been the time to do it,
QUESTION*

Couldn't Congress have assumed that?

MR® ANDERSONt

It is possible- yes, Mr.

Justice

Marshall, it is possible that Congress could have assumed that,
however, for Congress to have assumed that, one would have
supposed that we could find in the record some indication or
existence of that assumption, end there is none.

There is

nothing in the record to suggest, nothing in this Congressione.,
hearing to suggest that Congress assumed that that right
existed.
And I would further add that if Congress assumed
that the right existed, why did it deem it necessary to creat©;;
the Act, the private right of action in the Investment Company.
Act, which is a companion statute in which it could just as
easily have deemed that it existed and, therefore., it was

II

unnecessary in that instanceTo take it one step further, the actions of Congress
in 1970 really alleviate the major policy objections that we
see to the implication of a private right in this instance
because, as I pointed out, it does really address all of these
difficult questions having to do with damages, burdens of
proof, and so forth,
QUESTION:

Mr. Anderson, if memory serves, in the

original argument in this case, there was some discussion about
what the question actually was before us.

Is the question

whether or not there is a private right of action under the
Investment Advisers Act, or is the question whether or not there
is a private right of action for money damages under that Act?
MRo ANDERSON:

The question before the Court is

whether or not there is a private right of action under the
Investment Advisers Act.

You are quite correct, in the first

argument there was some question as to whether a distinction
should be made.

We urged then, and we urge now that no such

distinction should be made.
QUESTION:

Judge Gurfein did make such a distinction,

didn't he?
MRo ANDERSON:

Yea.

In a footnote, in a dicta

£ootnote-QCBSTIONs

Right.

MRo ANDERSOH:

-"Judge Gurfein suggested that it

12

sight be easier to—
QUESTION:

It was a dissenting opinion anyway*

MRo ANDERSON:
QUESTION:

It was all dicta.

MR0 ANDERSON:
QUESTIONS

However, w© give it due homage because--

It was on your side.

MRo ANDERSONs
QUESTION:

That’s correct.

—it was in support of our position.

Right.

MRo ANDBRSOHs

Justice Gurfein*© dissent suggests

that it might be easier given the language of the Advisers Act
to imply a private right of .action for an equitable action to
enjoin.

"
QUESTION:

.

Right.

MR.* ANDERSON:

But w© take tfe® position that the

rationale which would dictate a decision with respect to
money damages applies with equal .fore® in this 'instance to the
right to equitable relief.
QUESTION a

And in the present case» Judge Wallace

did no more than say he agreed with Judge Gurfein?
MRo ANDERSON:
That’s correct.

That’s correct, Mr. Justice Stewart.

Be simply adopted the opinion.

QUESTION:

And in this case, of course, there is

an action for money damages.
MRo ANDERSON:

Yos, it is an action for money

damages and for equitable relief.

And, if 1 may add to that,

13

the difficulty which we pointed out to the Court last March
and,which» of course, persists today is that the Respondents
in this case ha-v® asked for a resci sion and incidental damages
so if, for example» this Court ware to make a distinction
between legal and equitable relief and to limit relief to
equitable relief, I think the distinction would soon become
meaningless for the reason that courts of equity have tra­
ditionally been empowered to grant complete relief, including
incidental damages, as necessary,
Mow, there is additional legislative history which
clearly points away, in our judgment, from the implication of
a privato remedy here.

But rather than repeat and summarize

that history all of which appears in the brief, 1 respectfully
refer simply to the

fact again that neither the Respondent

nor the SEC have been able to offer any direct evidence that
Congress intended to give clients of investment advisers ready
access to’the Federal courts.
At best the Respondents end SEC simply urge an analogy
to the Securities

Exchange act of 1934, a different Act for

a different purpose.
Let me turn now, if it please the Court,

to two

principal policy objections to fch© implication of a private
right of action under the advisers act,
First, if this Court were to imply a private right
of action under the advisors Act, it would undermine, if not

14

destroy, this Court’s recognition in 1975 that an investor
cannot maintain an action under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 unless the investor can allege the purchase or the sale
of a security.
Mow, according to the Respondents and the SBC* merely
being a client of an investment advisor, the existence of the
relationship endows that client or prospective client with the
right to sue for damages or to seels equitable relief, even
though the client or prospective client neither purchased nor
sold a security.
Let ate posa an example»

Let us suppose that an

investment adviser recommended against the purchase of a certax
common stocki let us further suppose that the client follows
the advice of the advisor and doss not; purchase the stock?
let us

suppose that the stock next rises in value, according

to the SEC and the Respondents, the existence of the relation-

. . i
»

ship between the advisor and the client would give that client f
V
f

the right to fils a suit against the advisor and allege that

^
T

but for the advice he would have purchased the common stock.

/
'

i

How, the SEC clearly said at pages 49 to 45 -excuse me, pages 41 through 45 of its initial brief that since
the Investment Adviser© act does not have purchase or sal©
language you don't need to worry about that because it is
not a requirement#

The Respondent seems to say the same thing

at pages 69 to 62 of the Respondent’s brief, although it is

15

lase direct*
The conclusion is that a client who does not purchase
stock would b® entitled to maintain as action under Section
206 of the Advisers Act, whereas someone who did. not have aa

investment advisor, and was not dealing with an

investment

advisor, would be barred from bringing a claim.

The result is,

in effect, a discrimination between those who are fortunate
enough to afford the services of an investment advisor and
those who do not use an investment advisor*
QUESTIONs

It only applies to investment advisors

who defraud their clients.
MR. ANDERSON*

Absolutely, that’s correct.

But the
i

point is, t think, Kr. Justice Stevens is that if the aliega~
tion were that they were the victim of fraud with respect to
not. purchasing, they would have standing under /the rationale
cf the interpretation' given by the Respondent SEC — by the
Respondent and the SEC in this caa@.
I think the example well illustrates the :extent to
which implying a right of action in this case would undermine
the limitation, if you will, that this Court recognised in the
tianor «.Blue Chip Stamp. Case-QUESTION?

Do you think the Court has decides!! any

cases since the last argument that have any relevance to the
issue you are arguing?
MR. ANDERSON:

Very certainly, Mr* Justice.

16

QUESTION:

Are you going to discuss any ©f those?

MR? AHDERSOSs

Yes,

We have counted upon the two

cases that seem the most directly relevant here

la ,

Ean^na v.

<£hQ-Xtn.,iyej?J3i.ty...Qf—Chica<iO->-and Touch® Ross v, Rcfliftqfcon, which
seen to bear on the question that is currently before the
Court,

And we have commented on those two cases,

1 would be pleased to comment hare on tha impact of
either of those cases.,
QUESTION?

yon vary much,

if you wish.

Wo,

apparently, you don’t think they help

2 would assume you would call our attention--

MRo ANDERSON* 2 do, indead, think that both of those
cases help.
QUESTION i
I may have missed your later brief., that’s
part of my problem.
MRe ANDERSON:
There ie a yellow aovered'brief, I
beli ve,

and it includes discussion of both the Redlnoton
•r

'

. .

Case- -and the Touche Ross Cas©,
QUESTION:

Thank you,

1 -just didn’t get it,

Wa have one from the SEC, filed on September 28th,
MR, ANDERSON:

¥©s, and 1 believe the Court has a

yellow covered brief also which includes a supplemental brief
which we filed, which is devoted,

in large part, to both

th© Cannon and Touche Ross Case,
I must say that 2 think with one possible exception
that Touch® Ross and Radingfeon seem to b© conceptually
identical to th© eas© which is before th© Court,

and that the

17

rational© for that case would siiggest a decision in the
Petitioner’s favor here.
The case of Cannon is not inconsistent with a
ruling here for the rather, t think, abundant reasons given
in that case, such as the existence or provision of attorneys
fees to the prevailing party other than the Government; the
existence of Congressional action following implication of a
private right of action and for all of the reasons given in the
majority opinion in that case, the Cannon ease is absolutely
consistent with a ruling in the Petitioner’s favor hare,
Sot me now return, if it please the Court, to the
second poliay consideration which hears on a decision hare, and
that centers on the special wording of Section 206, the
provision of the Investment Advisers Act on which the claim
for private right

private relief is based,•

Section 206 makes it unlawful for an investment
adviser to defraud a client or prospective client.

The key

words,- of course, are !,a prospective client,”
And this raises an interesting example.

Lot’s

suppose an investment adviser were to send a business
solicitation, letter or material, to a prospective client?
let us suppose next that that material were later deemed or
alleged by the SEC to be misleading, fraduleat, deceptive,
and so forth, the SSC clearly says at pages 41 through 45 of
its brief that this prospoctive client would have a claim

18

under the Investment Advisers Act and the Respondent is simply
silent on th® issue.
Those who are prospective clients of investment
advisers are hardly a discreet class of plaintiffs.

But, raor©

importantly, the notion that a private right of action could
exist in favor of prospective clients, at a minimum it raises
more cinosfcions than it could possibly answer.
nonetheless, Section 206 speaks of prospective client
as well as clients.
Prospective clients, however, is consistent with
enforcement by the SEC, going into court and seeking to prevent
an investment adviser from sending misleading or deceptive
material with respect to investments.
QUESTION:

¥ou don’t question the authority of the

SEC to bring an injunctive action?
MRo ANDERSONs

Absolutely not.

Ho, indeed.

1 think

the duty and responsibility of the SEC is the enforcement
aaahanism under this Act.

But 2 simply refer to the SEC

enforcement her® because that use of the phrase "prospective
client" is consistent with that kind of enforcement, and I
submit it is not consistent with the notion of private
enforcement.
QUESTIONS

What kind of relief could the Commission,

the SEC secure?
MR, ANDSRSQMt

In the example just given, undor the

19

express wording of this Act, they could go into court and -seek
an injunction to enjoin a violation of the Act*
QUESTIONS

Only equitable relief,

MSo ANDERSON;

Only equitable relief? that's correct.

The potential reach of a privata action under the
Advisers Act is illustrated by this very ease.

1 would

respectfully remind the Court just what is alleged her©.

It

is alleged here that the adviser to a real estate investment
trust has violated the Advisers Act.

There is no allegation

that the wrongdoing occurred in connection with the purchase
or sale of any security.

There is no allegation that the acts

of the Trustee Petitioners constituted wilful deception,

There

is no allegation of intentional concealment of material
i

fact.
The complaint is simply a complaint about a
relationship — a relationship between a real estate invest­
ment trust and its adviser,
And if we take all of those things about which the
complaint is not about, 1 think it's clear to see the fashion
or the manner in which it is able to circumvent the limita­
tions that this Court in recent years has imposed on
securities actions.

It circumvents, for

example, the

requirement in Ernst & Ernst v« aochfelder that there ba an
allegation and proof of intent to deceive.

It permits

certain avoidance of the requirement that there foe wilful

28

deception, as pointed out. in the case of

Santa Fe Industrios,

v. fige a a.
How, in response to th® policy considerations, the
Petitioners offer a series of what amounts to reassurances
that the Courts of Appeal will ba guided by recent decisions
of the Court and will not go astray.
For ©sample, in response to the contention that
implying a right of private action here would undermine the
purchase or sale requirement*

th® Respondent states, at page

58 of its brief, "it is fair to presume that th® federal courts
in giving

proper scop© to Section 206

will foe appropriately

guided" by the requirement that intent foe an

element of the

claim»
QUESTION:

Hr. Anderson, in the SEC’s Supplemental

Brief, on pages 2 and 3, in its summary of argument, it says,
“This Court’s recent decisions emphasise that implication of
a private right of action presents a question of ’statutory
construction»* Citing Touche Ross and Cannon.

"In resolving

that question, the Court has held, it is necessary to
determine ’whether Congress intended to create th© private
right of action assarted.8"
Is it really up to us to consider all of these
policy considerations if Congress ha® not by implication or
©Kpressly created a private cause of action?
MRe ANDERSOH:

Ko, Mr, Justice Rehnquist, I point

21
©ut these policy difficulties her® to, if you will, explain or to
elaborate the resulting difficulties that would follow an
implication in this instance.

And we are instructed that this

Court is the Court to considar policy and, for that reason, 1
bring it to the attention of th® Court, But 1 want to repeat'
in direct answer to your question-*QUESTIGMs
Who instructed you that this Court was
the Court to considor policy?
MBs hHDERSOMi

The Supreme Court of the United States

we learn first in law school and later in review is to con­
sider all of the reasons which bear on a decision*
It seems to me that the decisions, for example, the
SencJlSL. —■ excuse me, the »1«« Chip Stamps Case* those policyconsiderations were discussed by Judge Gurfein in his con­
sent in the ajfe%$h.3msan_...g.a.a«5-,.- and it is simply her® I repeat
them to point out the-practical difficulties that follow from
that implication*

But I do not- for a moraent wish to suggest

that there is any reason here why this Court would want to do
anything other than what would foe evident from the intent
of Congress,hud, to repeat the basic point here, there is ao
direct evidence here of which we ar® aware that Cosgrss-s
intended to create a private right of action.
1 will reserve the balance of my time,
HR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Mr, Keisman.

Thank you,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC. L ♦ KEISM&K, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF TEE RESPONDENT
MRo KEXSMAH:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

this Honorable Courts
We5 too, think it is appropriate to begin this

re­

argument by calling attention to what this case, and what,
therefore, is actually and necessarily before this Court for
decision.'
This is an action brought derivatively by a share­
holder of a real estate investment trust against its invest­
ment adviser, certain of the trustees of the trust, the parent
of the advisers and a sister corporation alleged to have been
parties to the transactions alleged to be fraudulent.
Mow, in discussing the issues before the Court, w©
are again dividing time with the Government, the SEC, and,
subject to the Court's desires and questions, w© intend to
focus on the case, what the statute does, by necessity, by
implication, and the legislative background against which the
statute was enacted.
The Commission will emphasise, again subject to the
Court's questions, the appropriateness within the enforcement
picture of a private- remedy? the question of the relationship
between the administrative machinery and the appropriateness
of implications of private remedy and the inapplicability of
doctrinas such as those arising from AMTRftK and B1 PC against

23

Barber.

And, with the Court’s permission, I would like to point

out, as I argued last Spring, in its principal cause of
action, classically equitable in the substantive form,
Hob, there is no quibble that mergar happened.

And

that merger started out as a procedural doctrine and continued
to be a procedural doctrine,

I think there is also no quibble

that the substantive law recognises in the nature of relief
available and the nature of defenses available, there is still
such a thing as a claim equitable in its character, in its
substantive character.

Although one is not demurrable, if on®

pleads the inequity in a thing called a complaint.

You can't

plead laches in a complaint for goods sold and delivered and
you can plead laches in a bill for restitution and reseision.
And its primary cause of action, this is a bill for
rescision of a contract alleged to be the product of a
fraudulent scheme and plan for restitution of the compensation
or at least the sscess compensation paid thereunder. It even
contains th« partial seeds of partial equitable defense; that :
that the full restitution of all compensation

would be

something for a court of equity to consider if all of the
services rendered could not be tendered back for what they
were worth,
What is actually before this Court, and what can't
be not decided, given that certiorari has been granted, is
whether an equitable action arises by necessary implication

24

And, while there has been a difference in the
expression of analysis-, this really doesn’t differ from what th
Court did 100 years ago, at least as I understand it, through
our distinguished Dean Thayer, who said the reason we look to
imply claims from wrongs arising under statutes is because in
an appropriate kind ©f case, and we are talking about the kind ■
of case where a standard of safety or a standard of decency
had been established by a legislature, not to do so would b©
to fail to offer appropriate respect to the other branch of
the Government.
There is no discontinuity between the cases at
common law, the cases under early Federal statutes, and the
case at bar.

There is a difference ia approach and analysis,

perhaps a tighter and mors careful view of greater recognition
when it arises of th© problems of federalism,
QUESTIONs

Do you think possible changes in

legislative practices over the period since Dean Thayer was

25

talking might have something to do with this?
MRo KEISMMJ:

To a certain degree, Mr. Chief Justice.

T.t may be that this has become a little bit more of a sod©
nation than it was? that is, in some casas, and perhaps in­
creasingly the Congress is willing to take the risk of spelling
et?.t all of the elements of the special kind of cause of action
that it wants to create.
But, at least in 1940, and I think 7. only have to
speak principally to 1940 and not to 1979, this was not a
code country.

There were experiments with codes.

But, as we

have argued before, we think it perfectly clear that Congress
created under some of the Securities Acts specific hybrid forms
of action for specific wrongs, its study of which had given rise
to the 1933 and 1934 and 1335 Act.

It likewise created certain

open-ended provisions saying again and again in its legisla­
tive history we don* t know, for example, what kind of fraud is
going to happen.
Professor Loss, in one of the fcreatis© sections
we cited in our original brief, picks up I think the appropria
metaphor for an Oregon State Court that if we codified the law
of fraud, the Federal Oregon Court said there is a certain kind
of gentleman finding ways to commit three but not the fourth
element of sucks fraud.
A certain amount of open-endedness and non-codifica­
tion of the law of fraud was recognised by the legislation

That may be so, Mr, Chief Justice,

but. with respect to Section 206, we are talking about 1940 and,
respectfully, t don't think there has been any change —
certainly no change that invalidates anything this Court said

QUESTIONi

Well, for example, when Congress in on©

of these cases that we have provided for attorney's fees to be
allowed to the private litigant, that was thought to ba enough
to suggest that it was mere inadvertence that they hadn't
provided for an express and explicit private right of action.
But, otherwise, dossalfc Professor Loss' approach leave an
enormous amount of discretion to the Courts on what are
essentially policy questions?
MR» KS1SM&Ns

here.

1 don’t think it's .& problem here because there is a

much stronger indication cf Congressional intention that some

corn the Advisers Act, directly in

27

fcha Advisers Act,

There is a section, Section 2.15(b) which

says that any contract and practice, the continuation of any
relationship that is in violation of a substantive provision of
this Title is void.

The courts

this Court, has recognised

in Packert. in citing Deekert and Blue chin Cases softened the
blow of the word ’’void" so that it doesn’t mean no title may
pass in a remote error of the grantor can't take the land back.
It is perfectly clear in the decisions of this Court
that the least it means is avoidable at the suit of the party
deceived or aggrieved,

That’s right in the Advisers Act,

And*

if one is looking to decide, as this Court has so often
traditionally done, only the case before it, we respectfully
submit this Court would have to nullify Section 215(b), to say
that no private litigation arises out of the anti fraud
provisions of the Advisers Act,
This is a much clearer case, we respectfully submit,
without other considerations wa haven't dealt with yet, than
Cannon,,
In Cannon, there is a prohibition against any person
being discriminated against on several different bases.
This Court

wise enough to realise that a class

of persons discriminated against, even though large, was a
discreet class, and it was right creating language.

Here it

said in 206 no investment advisor shall defraud his client.
That is a very narrow discreet class.

The legislative history

28

from 1934 to 1940 is replete with indications that the
Congress considered, those who provide capital for the capital
market to b© a discreet class in need of special and new
protection.
By the Court in CLsuacs standards, 206 is far narrower
than 901, directed not only to a single kind of p3.ainfei£f but
to a single kind of defendant,
advisers.

In 1940 it was only registered

In 1960 it became any advisers.
As to th© prospective client question, X think the

answer is simple.

Fraud doesn't ripen into a cause of action

until at least money passas, until the property is fraudulently
taken.

A prospective client can easily cover th® ease where

the fraud was in the inducement.

As one of the things.

Congress was worried about touts and tipsters.The investor
sends in his money and gets nothing bac!c.

The Court might say,

"Well, this isn’t an advisor-client relationship, it’s a
fraud in the inducement or false pretenses."
Other©wise, while Petitioners raise the horror of
suits by people who get tip sheets and don’t do anything,
again this is a fraud statute,

We are talking about an eoonoti,

Are you saying then that the language of

Wo showed in our brief that 214 had no

We showed that it wasn't looked at, it wasn't written up and
it wasn't marked up.

We showed one thing more.

We showed

31

that if how it got passed means anything, it means exactly
the opposita to what the Petitioner argued.

Why?

Because the

Reports that came to the Floor on which the majority voted
said these contain the usual provisions about jurisdiction
and venue actions.
If that meant anything to the 266 votes that was
necessary to carry the House, it had to moan we are doing
again what we did in .193 3, what we did in 1934, what we did
in 1935 in the Holding Company Act and what we did in 1939
in the Trust Indenture Act.

Nobody suggested to the Senate

or the House there was any difference in the procedural sect”
ions of the Acts they enacted in 1940.
This Court has said more than 1 think it fit for m©

So I am not going to

correctly states, this Court is serving notice on Congress from
now on, except for certain excepted areas, and the Court is in
Cftsaon serving that kind of notice, we will never imply a

You have got to codify the civil law.
When that is explicitly done, those subsequent

statutes could, I suppose, give rise to any right of implica»

But I respectfully submit that this Court should

consider very carefully in, terms of its institutional needs
whether it really means except in one or two special areas
that this must be a code country if it wishes to create the
situation where the gentleman from Oregon, I averted to

ORAL ARGUMENT BY RALPH Co FERRARA, ESQ.
AS AMICUS CURIAE
MRo FERRARA:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
The Securities and Exchange Commission would like to
talk about the five cases that this Court decided last term
that bear on this case:
against Lasker, navis.

Cannon ,' Touche, .Kidxgell, Burks
but before I do that, I have listened

to Mr. Anderson on two occasions twist this ease, and I would
like to respond to a few of the things he said before launchi”
into my argument in chief.
First, somehow Mr. Anderson seems to think the
Touche Ross opinion decided last terra clothes Section 214 with
some kind of special significance for his ease.

If Touche

Ross stands for anything, it stands for the fact that
jurisdictional provisions like Section 214 create new duties,
create new liabilities and if there are duties or liabilities
to be created, to be recognised, you have got to go to the
substantive provisions of the statute.
That's the anti-fraud provision. Section 2-06 her©,
S think it's inexplicable that he thinks Touche Ross helps his
case

37

Secondly, he on three occasions in the course of
hie principal argument says that there is no indication in the
legislative history that Congress affirmatively intended to
create a private cause of action.

That's net the test.

.Cannon

and Touche affirm that that's not the test.
Mr. Justice Stevens in the course of writing the
majority opinion in Cannon said that that ease was atypical —
that's the word he us®d, "atypical", and that there seemed to
bs a rather significant indication of legislative intent to
create a private cause of action and Mr. Justice White, in his
dissenting opinion, disagreed with that,.
QUESTION:

The language on page 3 of your

Supplemental Brief where you say in resolving that question
the Court has held that it is necessary to determine "wheths
Congress intended to create the private right of action
asserted,"

•
MR® FERRARA:

i am sorry, I understand the quote,

I didn't understand the question.
QUESTIONi

Well, I believe what you were just arguing

is somewhat at odds with the language I just quoted,
\

MR® FERRARAs

Hot at all.

We embrace, as we do in

our brief, both the Cannon and Touche standards-.

We Handersta

.V/

that this Court wants to treat questions of recognising private
j

rights of action under Federal statutes that don't expressly
provide for on© as an issue ©f statutory construction.

And

38

we think that this Court in Cannon and Touche gave ns the
guidelines to go about the business of engaging in statutory
construction.

The guidelines that the Court gave ua in

determining that threshold

question of Congressional intent

are clearly articulated in Touche,.

Mr. Justice Stevens in

Cannon said it’s that right duty

let me slow down.

Mr» Justice Stevens said in ——~——
Cannon said it
is that
j
V

v

right or duty creating language in the statute that is the
best indication of whether a private right of action should
be implied.

That’s the Cannon of statutory construction that

this Court, I think, in both Cannon and Touche have chosen
to determine whether or not a right of action should be
implied»
QUESTIONs

Are you saying as long as you’ve got the

right duty substantive language in the statute, you must find
in the statute some affirmative evidence that Congress did not
intend to?
MR. FERRARA>
Mr. Justice White,

I think that’s too short a standard,

I think that the threshold inquiry is

determining whether or not the plaintiff was in the special
class,

I thins this Court said in .Cannon-QUESTIONj

If that’s all you find in the legislative

history or the rest of the statute, and you find no other
evidence of any kind

except that there's that substantive

right or duty, you would say the right is implied.

39

MSo FERRARA:

If this Court would like to say the

right is implied, X would agree with it»
QUESTION:

I thought that9s what you said a moment

ago«
MR0 FERRARA:

No, X aay that that’s the starting

point in determining whether or not a right should be im-QUESTION:

What else do you need?

MRo FERRARA:

Well, this Court has said in Cannon and

Touche that once you've answered that threshold question from
the language of the statute itself, then this Court is going to
be decidedly receptive to implying a cause of action when it

xe

necessary or at least helpful to effectuating the underlying
Congressional purposes.

That, I think, this Court said in

both of those cases as the next step.

And we think that this

caoa needs that next step also.
Beyond that, the Court has said that if you want to
regard it as a sub-step of 2, the Court has said that it’s
going to be decidedly receptive to implying a right of action
if failing to do so would undermine the statutory purpose.

Re

think we meet that test too.
Beyond that, the Court said as a third test, if yov
will, that we're going to be decidedly receptive to implying
a private right of action when an explicit right is created
on behalf of a bane.fitted class, but there is not an oppor­
tunity for that benafittad class to access to intervene, to

40

activate, to participat® in the administrative machinery created
under the statute.

We meet that test too,

Shat, 1 think, is the refocusing, the refurbishing
of Cort against Ash that Cannon and Touche provide and I
introduce the subject of the Davis Case also in my opening
remarks.

We think that that bears on this too.

Because, as

Mr. Justice Brennan pointed out in that case, writing for the
majority, the question of whether or not there is a cause of
action under a statute is analytically distinct from the
question of relief.
So ail of that Gannon and Touche language, all of tibu
new mode of analysis to determine whether or not Congress
intended a right of action should be implied all focuses on
the question of cause of action, as properly it should.
Well, continuing, Mr. Anderson also seems to think
or take some comfort in the 1970 amendment to the Investment
Company Act, creating an express right of action under Section
36(b), but he omits to tell the Court that Congress said in
both the Sonata and House Reports, as I recall, to those
1970 amendments to the Investment Company Act that it had
absolutely no intention to adversely affect implied remedies
under other provisions of th® Federal securities laws,
particularly the Investment Company Act or I think the
Investment Advisers Act,
H© raises th© 1976 amendments, or proposed

41

amendments to the Investment Advisers Act, but he doesn't tell
yon there that the Congress considered those 1976 amendments
merely to confirm what it understood to be the fact that
actions had been implied, and properly so, under Section 206
of the Investment Advisers Act,
Mr, Anderson says that the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the Respondents in this case, seek to imply a
private right of action merely by some analogy to the Securitie-and Exchange Act. an obvious reference to Barak.
not the case at all,

That's just

Wa submitted a 22-pag® supplemental

brief indicating that w© are quite comfortable living under
Cannon and quite comfortable living under Touch©, quite
comfortable living under Davis and, quite frankly, relieved
that Burks

even helped this case,
Mr, Anderson seems to think that the SEC doesn't

place great credence in what he calls the policy argument; th~'
there is no purchase and sale here involved.

Well, we think -

I'm sorry, he says that not only w@ don't place great credence
in that but that our entire argument rests on the language of
the statute.

He says the SEC seems to sit on its hands saying

the language of

the statute doesn't require a purchase and

sale accordingly.

All of those marvelous policy considerations

that the Court articulated in Blue Chip — marvelous from
his perspective — that the SEC completely disregards.
it's just not true
«

Well,,

42

Ia B3.ua Chip — as I say, this case is substantially
different than E^lua Chip,

Here there is a clear transactional

nexus between the Plaintiff and Defendanta privity of contract between them.

I mean they have

They have an investment

adviser and a client to that investment adviser, ranch different
than Blue Chip,
Hera yon have a very definite limited.class of
potential, plaintiffs, expressly identified in the statute.
statuta talks in terms of clients of investment advisers,

T'
It's

not a statute that talks in terms of the general public, the
kind of parson that would b© sitting by the wayside and a
purchase and sale securities transaction that Blue phl.P was
worried about.
Also, there is no remote expectation of contingent
liabilities in a case like that.
As a matter of fact, Mr. Anderson in the course of
his opening remarks suggested that in the Commission’s brief,
pages 41 through 45, we embrace the notion that a prospective
client should also have an implied right of action.

X don't

recall that our brief does that.
As a matter of fact, the Commission's position is
that allegations of fraud presuppose that there has to b© the
existence of a client-adviser relationship.

Now, certainly

fraud can induce a party into becoming a client of an advisor,
but the Commission's position and the Commission's view is

43

that before an action can be maintained, a person is going to
(

have to demonstrate that at the time of th® action, or at the
time of the discovery of the fraud, that he was a client.
QUESTION:

But you don’t require that there had been

a contract?
MR„ FERRARAS
QUESTION:

I’m sorry?

You don't require that there had been a

contract?
KRo FERRARAs
QUESTIONS

If you mean a written contract--

Ho, I don’t mean a written — I mean a

contract as defined in 215.
MEo FERRARAs

We think there has to have bean an

advisory relationship, a formal advisory relationship so that
you have a client status and an advisory status in «sxisten
The prospective client language, we think, was added by
Congress merely to he able to cover th© situation where the
plaintiff before he becomes a client is induced to become a
client on the basis of fraudulent misrepresentation and that
prospectivo client language is important for the SEC that has
as part of its enforcement machinery the obligation to go in
and bring injunctive action to prevent frauds that are about
to occur so the prospective client language is very important
for the SEC language but not, we think, particularly relevant
or particularly complicating for this Court in determining
whether clients should

have an implied right of action under

Section 206
Finally» having discussed briefly Mr. Anderson’s
position» 2 would no» like to turn to our argument.

As I

said briefly» in part responding to some of the points that
Mr. Anderson raised» this Court has characterised last term
and defined what it calls the threshold question in determining
whether a private right of action should be implied or
recognised under a Federal statute or recognised under a
Federal statute not explicitly providing for on®.
\

And that

■

threshold question was identified by the Court to b© whether
or not the plaintiff or the respondent in this case was within
the special class meant to be protected by the statute.
We think that Section 296 in the language» the
language of the statute» th© thing that Mr. Justice Stevens
writing for the Court said we had to look to» the language c- '
the statute -"creates Federal rights in favor of a particularised
class.

My view is that this Court was far

batter suited v?hsa it based its implication decisions on
policy-based masoning of Borak.

However, we are perfectly

comfortable with having the statutory construction rule that
has Bean articulated in Cannon and Touche.

And 2 am not the

one who said that determining what the ultimate Congressional

46

intent, is is the proper test.
QUESTION':

That's the test this Court--

It isn’t a question of jurisdiction, is

it?
MRc PERRAR&s

It is not a question of jurisdiction

because the jurisdiction under 28 USC 1331 and 2X4-QUESTION:
Federal statute.

And the right is stated under the

Why do you need some further license from

Congress to get into the Federal court?
MR, FERRARA:

I think if you are asking me to explain

the rationale of the Court’s decisions in Cannon and Touche.
I would respond by saying, Mr, Justice White, that there is
concars on the part of the Court that it not engage in bread"
of what has been characterised as a separation of powers
provision of the Constitution.
QUSSTIOHs

The Court does not want to b

It assumes fcha answer that you can’t get

into courts unless Congress tells you --lets you in,
MR® FERRARA:

I as sorry? I don’t understand your

question,

QUSSTIOKs

Well, Court3 have recognised rights of

action, causes of action without waiting for Congress to say •
yea or nay on the subject? have they not?
MR, FERRARA:

Absolutely*

That’s correct, Mr. Chief

Justice.
QUESTION:

The question is whether in the framework,

of a particular statute we are forced to rely on statutory

47

construction and not draw on broader powers.
MSo FERRARA:

Mr. Chief Justice, if I could stand

up her® for another one hour and try to persuade you that the
rational® of Borak was correct and this Court should b® drawing
on broader policy-based considerations, I would love to do
so.

But 1 just don't think for some reason it's going to do sis®

a lot of good.
QUESTION:

Ho, the red light doesn't permit you to

dc so anyway.
Do you have anything further, Mr. Anderson?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN Mc ANDERSON, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR® ANDERSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court s
Section 215 of the Advisers Act, the so-callsd
void provision or voidable provision is discussed at pages
5 through 9 of the red reply brief,

I will not take any time

here, but, in essence» the argument that Section 215 of the
Advisers Act authorizes private action is based on an analogy
to a comparable provision under the 1934 Act, an Act which
has a statute of limitations provision in it.

This section

has no such provision in it, and it is the very existence
of that statutory statute of limitation which has been used
fey the Courts to justify a private right of action under
Section 215

48

This Act is not the 1934 Act.
purpose.

It had a different

It was aimed at a different aspect or segment of the

securities industry.

The right or duty language which appeared

in both Touche Ross and the Cannon Casa, I submit, can only be
on® test.

It ought not become another mechanistic tool whereby

you look and you find the existence of a right or duty and then
automatically turn and decide that there is a privat© right
or action.
I hope that this case will clarify for litigants
in the future that the existence of a right or duty per se
is not th© test.

The basic test remains the intent of

Congress.
The Advisers Act, unlike the 1933 and the 1934 Act
does not purport to regulate the marketing-QUESTION:

Why is Congress, if it is clear enough in

an Act that Congress created some protection for a class of
people and created soma duties on behalf of one group in
favor of another, why — and then you have the jurisdictional
provisions in Federal court, why do you need some other
evidence from Congress that people protected have to have a
right to go into court?
%

MRe ANDERSON:

Mr, Justice White, I don’t think you

do under the example that you gave.

The example that you

gave was if it is clear enough in the Act itself that Congress
intended to create--

49

QUESTION:

I didn't say that.

I didn't say that*

2 said that it is clear in the Act that there are soma duties
created by Congress, some duties placed on one group in favor
of another.

That's perfectly clear.

MR, ANDERSON:
QUESTION:

Yes.

And they say nothing at all about getting

into court about it.
MRo ANDERSONi

There are any number of Federal Acts

which create rights and duty language in favor of special
classes and this Court has not ruled that either the party—
QUESTION:

1 am just asking you, why do you need

some other evidence from Congress that the people protected
have to have a separate license from Congress to get into
court?
MR, ANDERSON:
rights and duties under

Because I think the creation of
Federal statute could encompass

a broad range of statutes and, therefore, imply causes of
action under them.

There has to b® something more than the

simple creation of a right or duty.

There has to be something

mere in the statute to indicate that that right or duty could
be asserted by the special class to be benefifcted.
QUESTION:

Why?

MS, ANDERSONs

Because otherwise it seems to me

that you could not explain such cases as-»
QUESTION:

I know, but that is just bootstrapping

based on our cases»

I want to know about what you--

MR, ANDERSONs

Well, it seems again there ere any

number of statutes which create rights or duties or han
rights ©r duty language in them and to simply use that xs the
talisman or the basis upon which you are then going to say that
because rights or duties are created in favor of this class
automatically that class has standing to sue—
QUESTION:

Find some ©vi&ane© in the statute or its

structure or unless Congress affirmatively didn’t intend -that they intended to keep them out of court.
HR, ANDERSON:

1 do not understand in the case of

implying causes of action that if is the task of those who
are resisting implication to come before the Court and offer
proof that Congress did not intend to imply a private right
of action.

Because, Mr. Justice White, it seems to me that

there are any number of statutes, as I said earlier, which
have rights or duty language in favor of certain specified or
identifiable class but that in and of itself it seams cannot
be used as an automatic or a

checklist thing and, furthermore,

to shift another way, the burden to the parties opposing
implication to prove that Congress did not intend.
Now the Advisors Act is aimed at a small specific
segment ©f the investment industry and that fact alone I
think is very important because it makes difficult, at
least, all of these analogies to the ’34 Act, which are the

51

basis of the Respondent's and the SRC's argument.

I respect­

fully call the Court's attention to all of the arguments
that are mad© under Section 206, all of the arguments that are
made under Section 215 are arguments by analogy to the 1934
hat and the 1933 Act,-

And even the use of Borah» a 1934 Act

case is an indication

that what has happened is that they arc

arguments by analogy*

Justice,
