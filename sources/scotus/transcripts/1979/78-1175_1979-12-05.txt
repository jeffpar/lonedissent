MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

next in 78-1175, Hatzlachh Supply Company v. United States.
Mr. Lewin, X think you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF NATHAN LEWIN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. LEWIN;

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court;
This ease which is here on certiorari to the Court of
Claims presents the question whether the United States may be
sued as a. party to an implied contract of bailment when,
goods seised by the Customs Service are lost while in the
custody of Customs.
The Court of Claims granting summary judgment for
the United States, held that by reason, of a provision in the
Federal Tort Claims Act, particularly Subsection (c) of Sec­
tion 2680, the United States is totally immune from any con­
sequences which follow — and here's th© language of the
statute itself — "the detention of any goods or merchandise
by any officer of Customs or Excise or any other law enforce­
ment officer."
This reading of .Section 2680 (c) conflicts with the
1958 holding of the Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit in
a case called Alliance Assurance Company v. United Statas,

4
which is recorded in 252 Fed. 2d, and also with a very recent
construction of that statute by the 9th Circuit.

And this

Court has now granted certiorari to resolve that conflict.
QUESTIONs

Mr. Lewin, it has been my experience in

ray service hare that the Court of Claims is usually astute to
seise opportunities to broaden its jurisdiction.

It resolves

doubtful questions frequently in favor of its jurisdiction,
and if it were a very close case, I would have thought the
Court of Claims would have decided it the other way.
MR. LEWIN;

Well, I think quite frankly the Court of

Claims did not consider in this case the locations of and the
language of this particular subsection as compared with those
that were near it, nor indeed did it consider the legislative
history of Section 2680(c), which we've set out in our brief.
I think the Court of Claims was quick, maybe, to
seize on the language of 2680(c) and to view it as applying to
these kinds of situations because it viewed that subsection as
granting broad protections to the Customs Service.

We think

that is not what the legislative history shows about Subsection
(c) and we think that's not what Congress intended,.
It did not intend to say Customs Service is immune
from suits against it as for example the Tennessee Valley
Authority is under the provision of 2680, the last subsection,
or other agencies of government, the military service or others.
QUESTIONS

But this is a detention of property, isn't

5
it, Mr. Lewin?
MR. LEWINs

It was a detention? yes, Mr. Chief

Justice.
QUESTIONs

You 'think it changed its character at a

MR. LEWIN;

Well, of course, this case was decided

point?

on summary judgment.

All the facts were not presented, in terms

of the history of how this property carae into the possession of
the United States and what steps led up to the notice of seiz­
ure.
An interesting fact which appears just from the record,
and of course that would have to be amplified, if there ulti­
mately had to be a trial on this question, is that there were
11 weeks between the time that these goods carae into the United
States and until a notice of. seizure was sent out.

Now, the

notice of seizure, of course, is not a forfeiture, contrary I
think to implications that might emerge from the brief filed by
the Solicitor General.

A notice of seizure in the Customs pro-

cedura, ordinarily, just initiates the process.
importer, "Now, look.

It says to the

We expect you now to proceed.

If you

want to claim that there should not be a forfeiture, if you
want to claim that there are circumstances which relieve us
of the right to forfeit these goods, file a petition,” which
is exactly what was don©.
But in this case, the notice of seizure didn’t

6

immediately even follow upon the arrival of the goods to the
United States.

The goods arrived.

Let me just go through

those facts very briefly.
The goods arrived in March and April from Hamburg.
There was apparently a discrepancy between what appeared on the
bills of lading, with regard to these goods, which described
them all as razor blades, although in a corner it described
film, and the invoices, which were equally available to Customs
and were just open and notorious.

The invoices specified there

were camera supplies and film and things of that kind.
Tha importer, upon being notified that the goods had
arrived, has the alternative under the Customs procedure, by
statute and indeed, I am advised, this is routine with Customs,
they encourage it, that you ask for immediate delivery rather
than going through all the paper wosrk, you can go to a Customs
House broker, you can fill out a few papers and say, "Under the
provision of the statute, we want immediate delivery," and then
the rest of the paper work is done later.
That was don© through a Customs House broker who
took the description of the goods from the bill of lading.

Frc i

all that appears, it was a totally innocent mistake that the
Customs House broker made.

It was submitted to Customs and

they said, "Look, there3s a discrepancy between what appears on
your application for immediate delivery and what appears on
these invoices.

Consequently, we're not releasing the goods.55

7
This led to various —
QUESTION?

By paying $60,000, though, to dispose of

this matter, there is some intimation, at least, that it wasn't
totally inadvertent.
MR. LEWIN:
out:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, let me point this

What happened, those goods contained, and the first letters

that went to the Customs Service contains strong protest about
the fact that these goods were dated film, most of them were
dated film which would expire a year and a half later.

By the

time the Customs Service sent a notice of seizure, which was in
May, by the time the protest — protests were filed a week after
the notice of seizure? within a week the requests for remission
were filed •— Customs waited four months, until October of
1970 before saying, "Now, you have to submit $40,000 to get
these goods out."
At that point the importer felt that ha had written
to Customs, these were dated films, the summer season had
passed for which the films really were originally hoped to be
out on the market, and lie paid the $40,000.

I can represent to

the Court again, if s not in the record, there was a petition
submitted afterwards to seek to return that $40,000 to Customs
because it was felt that it was inappropriate.

But the im­

porter is in £ position in those circumstances where he can’t
really argue with the United States.
film, which is perishable.

They’ve got his dated

They have stainless steel razor

8
blades, which were in there, too, and the record reflects that
the attorney then representing the importer wrote to Customs
and said, "Look, chromium-plated blades are coming out on the
market.

There’s a very limited period of time in which we can

still sell stainless steel razor blades.

So we really have to

get those off the dock and out into the market as quickly as
possible. *'
Under those circumstances, the importer had no choice
other than to pay the money to get what was really close to
$600,000 worth of goods, and hope that a subsequent petition
might result in seme remission of that $40,000 demand by the
United States.
Of course, when the goods came back, 165,000 was
missing, and that3s what gives ris© to the issue in this case.
And the question in this case is, whether if the United States
finally, having taken these goods — certainly the importer was
not voluntarily surrendering than to the United States, but the
United States having taken the goods — having taken then under
a statute and under a procedure whereby it was really inviting
the importer to submit applications following the time that
these goods were being detained — now, the statute provides
that if there’s any case of forfeiture, it can't be done unless
there’s a libel, a proceeding filed, judicial determination
with regard to forfeiture.
So during the entire parted of time that Customs had

these goods, it was subject specifically to the statute, and
this is not disputed, to 19 USC 1605, which says, "Pending
such disposition, tine property shall foe stored in such place
as in the collector5s opinion is most convenient and appropria­
te with due regard to the expanse involved, whether or not the
place of storage is within the judicial district.” and so on
and so forth.
The statute says it shall foe placed and remain in the
custody of the collector for the district in which the seizure
was made to await disposition according to law.

It's in his

custody to await disposition according to law.
QUESTION;

Mr. Lewin, out of that language, I take it

you infer a commitment to return ths goods on the part of
Customs?
MR. LEWINs
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
And I take it the opposition will take

just -the opposite approach to these facts?
MR. LEWINs

I suppose so, although I think the govern­

ment 6s brief in this Court, at least, asserts mainly that there
is no bailment in this case, not because the statute does not
provide for it but because in some way the custody of the
United States is inconsistent with title remaining in the im­
porter,

And of course —
QUESTION?

They say it's a bailment imposed by law,

rather than a bailment in fact, so it isn't the kind of a

10
bailment contract that's subject to suit in a Court of Claims?
ME* LEWIN:

Our position on that is that whether

something is a bailment implied in fact depends of course* when
you're dealing with the government, on what the government knows
about its obligations under the law.

Of course, the law says

to the Collector of Customs, you're the custodian of these goods
until such time as the court acts.

That means that when the

Collector of Customs takes them, he-knows, not by operation of
law in the sense that it's contrary to his —
QUESTION:

Mr. Lewin, I suppose that if the Court of

Claims was wrong in saying that 268 0(c) provides no remedy,
let's assume that when you don’t return goods back, you emu sue
the United States under the Court of Claims Act.

If you

negligently lose them,
MR. LEWIN:
QUESTION:

Yes.
Of course, -this case wouldn't amount to a

whole lot, would it?
MR. LEWIN;

No, it wouldn't, of course.

We've made

the point in our brief -~
QUESTION:
MR. LEWIN:

You say we've granted cert on that?
Well, I think you've granted cert because

the Court of Claims has said -that by reason of 2680(c) we
can't bring a contract action. ,
QUESTION:

I understand, because this means that the

United States intends to be immune generally?

II
MR. LEWIS:

It tends to be immune even under the

Tucker Act, even under implied contract.
QUESTION:

But if they were wrong on that, say they5"a

wrong on that, it wouldn't change their position that this is
not an implied contract?
MR. LEWXM:

Well, I don’t think the Court of Claims

really said it was not an implied contract.
QUESTIONs

Well, it wouldn't change the United

States position?
MR. LEWIN:

Oh, it wouldn't, I agree, and I think the

United States really in this Court has, we have said in our
reply brief, relegated to a secondary role the Court of Claims
reasoning, which I think the Court of Claims seised on the
2680(c) language, and now the United States mainly argues in
this Court there's no implied —
QUESTION:

We've granted cert on this conflict on

(c)?
MR. LEWIN:

That's what we argued in our petition.

I assume that that's what you've granted cert on.

We filed

a short petition, we said this conflicts with the 2nd Circuit,
and you granted cart.
QUESTION:

Do you think that old case of Unit.«ad

States v. Sol© is no longer the law?
MR. LEWIN:
QUESTION:

Well, the case, the one I
It's the case in which the —

12

MR. LEWIN:
QUESTION:

Schmaltz5 case?
It is the settled doctrine of this Court

that the property, the specific property shall be forfeited,
and the forfeiture takes place, takes effect immediately upon
the commission of the act.
MR. LEWIN:

Oh.

The United States v. Sole, Mr.

Chief Justice, involved the still that was being run on a
premises and the language in, which is quoted in 19, which very
specifically says that title remains in the party until judici­
al condemnation refers, it seems to me, not to the Customs
situation —•
QUESTION:

I thought the language was not quite that,

the forfeiture constitutes a statutory transfer of the right
to the United States at the time the offense is committed.

In

other words, as soon, as they seized the still out in the woods,
without —
MR. LEWIN:
QUESTION:

Right.
—- any judicial proceeding, the U. S,

Marshals or Revenue agents

took the title, they took physical

possession and title.
MR. LEWIN:

Well, I think the language immediately

preceding that, Mr. Chief Justice, is the right to the propertyvests in the United States although their title is not perfected
until judicial condemnation.
So the title doesn't pass at that point.

Thera is

13
a right in a certain possessory sense,, and we don’t doubt that
even as applied to Customs»

And we think that the Stowell

case does not apply to the Customs procedure.
'

~

i

It’s really

quite different.
Stowell is a case where if Revenue officers seize a
still, from that point on it's clearly contraband, it’s clear­
ly illegal.

They say, "All right, we have now possession of

this property which is contraband.”
On the other hand, everything goes through Customs.
Everything that comes in from abroad, in terms of commercial
goods, goes through Customs.

Customs detains them; Customs

may say as it has, it did after a delay in this case, "All
right., now we’ve seised them and we're asking you to invoke
the procedures.”
QUESTION:

But if all this material had bean seised

at two o’clock in the morning when they were trying to land it
on the coast of New Jersey or someplace, a smuggling operation,
wouldn't it be in the same posture as the still in the Stowell
case?
MR. LEWIN%

I think if somebody — I think, Mr. Chief

Justice, if it were something different, if it were not going
through the regular procedures and it were in that senso contra­
band, if it werelike narcotic drugs or something, I think it
might be in that sense, because then the owner has no rights
in it.

But I think when something goes through the regular

14
Customs procedure, everybody knows — we’re talking about what
the parties expect, what they anticipate, and really what is
the tacit understanding, and I think that’s really what implied
contract in fact, implied bailment in fact means.
'What is the tacit understanding of the parties?

I

think a Customs officer who seises marihuana off the coast of
the United States, his tacit understanding is he is not holding
it as a bay . leaf for anybody.

But the Customs officer who

says, “Well, -tills is coining in with all the routine goods that
are being shipped into the United States," they're being
processed, in that context Customs has a tacit understanding
that it is holding these goods pursuant to the ordinary proces­
ses and pursuant to the procedures under which the importer
makes his petition, if he thinks it ought not to be forfeited,
if he thinks there is an innocent reason for the mistake in
the documentation being submitted to the government, and con­
sequently the statute — indeed, it’s not merely Section 1605, .
Mr. Justice Blackmun.

It's also

28 USC 2465, which vie quote

at page 11 of our brief.
It says, "Upon the entry of judgment for the claimant
in any proceeding to condemn or forfeit property seizied under
any act of Congress, such property shall be returned forthwith
to the claimant or his agent."

So the statute both says you’re

the custodian and you know that under the statute you have to
return the property to the claimant or his agent.

15
QUESTION:

Well,, could it be that if the Court of

Claims was wrong on the Tort Claims Act on 2680, could it be
that there could be a tort claim, an action of the Tort Claims
Act, and also an action in the Court or Claims, or not?
MR. LEWIN:
have both,

Yes, I think it could.

I chink you could

Absolutely.
And — but the Court of Claims was wrong and over

board because they read the Tort Claims Act rule —
QUESTION:

What you’re saying is that these same

facts gave rise to both the contract action and the tort?
MR. LEWIN:

Yes, sir, it could give rise to a tort

claim if you could prove —* it might b® the high as h burden of
proof
QUESTION:

But you couldn't bring a tort claim in

the Court of Claims?
MR. LEWIN:
the Court of Claims,

No, you couldn’t bring a tort claim in
And this action was brought only within

the contract statute of limitations.
theory is essential to the petitioner.

That’s why the contract
It can only, the claim

can only be asserted if it is a bailment or contract claim, be­
cause it’s too late as a tort claim.
QUESTION:

So you've got two shots at this case, one

if you win on 2680, you’ll win in any event? at least you can
stay in court, in some other court, and if you win on the other
end, you might stay in the Court of Claims because it’s a

16

contract?
MR. LEWINs

Well, no.

I think my point, if we win on

just 2S8G we're out of court on the tort theory because it's too
late -~
QUESTIONS
MR. LEWINs
QUESTION;
MR. LEWINs

Oh, really?
It’s too late to bring a tort action.
Statuta of limitations„
So we're — on the statute of limitations.

So we're only in court under a contract action -QUESTION;
MR. LEWINs

I see.
— and if the Court of Claims is right

in its broad reading of 2680, contract actions are barred by
2680.

Now, the government doesn’t apparently make that argu­

ment here, that contract actions are barred.

They say the

Court of Claims is right in its general reading of 268 0 and
the contract action is barred in any event because there’s no
implied contract in fact.
QUESTION;

You say that this would not fall within

one of the exceptions to the tort claims act?
MR. LEWINs

Yes, sir.

If one looks at the language — we've reprinted at
pages 1A and 2A of our principal brief —- the language

of the

Tort Claims Act, the series of exceptions as originally enacted
in 1S47.

Mow, when Congress wanted, specifically to say that

a government agency should not be liable, should foe immune

17
from any damage caused by loss, it knew very well how to say
so, and it did in Subsection (b).

It said, "Any clam aris­

ing out of the loss, miscarriage, or negligent transmission of
letters or postal matter."

It would have been the simplest

thing, had Congress really intended to do what the Court of
Claims says, to say is to see any clam arising out of the loss
of any goods or merchandise seized or taken by any officer of
Customs or Excise.

They didn’t say that.

They said any claim

arising in respect of the detention of any goods or merchandise.
And that has, we submit, a very narrow and specific
meaning.

It means exactly, if one takes the film in this case,

that if the ordinary government processes resulted in all the
goods being given back to the petitioner, he got every last
piece of film bad:, and the film was dated and therefore it was
of no value because of the delay caused by detention alone,
he'd have no tort claim.

Detention is what causes the harm.

But when the film is missing, when it’s lost or when
it's damaged, that's not. what Congress intended to protect
against or intended to provide an exemption for.
didn’t say loss or damage to the goods?

Congress

it said merely detentions.

Nor, for that matter, did Congress have the intention
that the Court of Claims said it had to give this broad power
to Customs officers to conduct their duties unfettered or un­
restrained by any possibility of civil suit.

Because when

Congress wanted to have that intention in these exceptions, it

18
specifically provided for it.
Subsection (e), for example? says that there’s no
claim allowed for any act or emission in administering the
provisions of the Trading With The Enemy Act.

Now, had

Congress wanted to say in administering the provisions of that,
the Customs law, of the Tariff Act of 1930, or anything like
that, it would have said it.

Or, for example, Subsection (1)

says any claim arising from the activities of the Tennessee
Valley Authority.

They didn’t say any activities of the United

States Customs Service.

That’s what Congress would have said

had it really had the intention of immunising the United States
Customs Service, the way the Court of Claims thought.
And that's why it appears to me, in answer to your
question, Mr. Justice Rahnquist, that the Court, of Claims didn't
look at the legislative history.
these other provisions.

They didn't compare it with

They immediately read this section and

they said, "Well, now, look.

Here it says detention of goods

and merchandise by any officer of Customs or Excise, and there­
fore that must have meant that the Customs Bureau is intended
to foa exempt in all its broad enforcement authority."
But that's just wrong.

If one looks at the language,

or if one looks at the legislative history, because we have set
it out in our brief, and I certainly don’t have the time to gointo it in detail, but Judge Holtzoff, later Judge Holtzoff who
was then a special assistant in the Department of Justice was

19
the principal proponent of this legislation on behalf of the
Administration.

He testified before the Congress that this

provision, Subsection (c), was not like other provisions which
were intended, like the Postal Service Provision, which were
intended to immunise government agencies which were carrying
out important functions and could not therefore be bothered or
should not h© restrained in some way by the possibility of
civil suits.
He said certain provisions, including Subsection (c)
were designed to simply preserve existing remedies for these
kinds of situations.

Wall, the existing remedies with regard

to any improper collection of Customs or duty were certain
statutory provisions which, agate we specified in our brief,
which had nothing to do with whether you can bring a lawsuit
if goods are harmed or lost or damaged in the course of
custody.
QUESTION?

But let’s as sura© you construe Subsection

(c) so it doesn’t immunize.

Under Test an, you still have to

show that there is some affirmative duty imposed on the govern
ment to respond in money damages, do you not?

I mean, you’re

not home free if you
MR„ LEWIN:

No, we're not home free.

But certainly

so far as the rationale of the Court of Claims is concerned --let me point out, the Court of Claims said, and the Court of
Claims has bean very careful in many cases and -tee government

20
has cited then — the Court of Claims has been very careful in
many cases to say* to keep this distinction between bailments
implied in fact and bailments implied in law»

And yet the

Court of Claims said as to -this particular bailment that on
both, as a result of the statute and as a result of the fact
that the notice of seizure, which was served on the petitioner
in October of 1970, said, "Look, you give us $40,000, we’ll
give you your goods back,” on that basis the Court of Claims
said this is a strong case for a bailment in fact.'5
Fag® 30A of the appendix.

The statute cited by the

plaintiff, along with the action of the United States Customs
Service in agreeing to return tha seized goods upon payment of
a $40,000 fine by Hatzlaehh could make a strong cas© for the
existence of an implied in fact contract, properly to preserve
and redeliver all the goods to Hatzlaehh.
All other things being equal, such a factual and
legal combination might enable plaintiff to prevail.

Now,

this is from a court which in a whole line of oases has said,
"We don’t have jurisdiction over implied in law contracts,"
and they’ve drawn that distinction very clearly, and yet as
to these facts, they recognise that both the statute and the
fact that the notices of seizure anticipate this kind of a
thing, makes a case under which they thought if not for 2680
Ce) the plaintiff would prevail.
And we think that same thing applies here, because -

21
QUESTIONS

Suppose the language, Mr. Lewin, of Sub­

section (c) instead of using the words "or the detention,"
"or the failure to return and account, for."

Would you think

that would make the statute different?
MR. LEWINs
QUESTION:

I think that definitely would, yes.
Aren't they still in a sense detaining,

when they do not return?
MR. LEWIN:

No, I think detention, what Congress had

in mind was you shouldn't be able to
go and bring a
✓
Claims Act to challenge the legality of detention.

Tort
If one

looks at what Judge Holtzoff was talking about, and he said
there are other tax statutes and other ways of challenging the
legality of detentions, I think what Congress was concerned
with is, if we enact the Tort Claims Act and the Collector of
Customs then detains property, people will be able to go in to
a district court under the Tort Claims Act and say, "’Look,
this act of detention is a tort.

It's illegal.

The detention

is illegal, and I can challenge it as a tort."
So therefore Congress said, "Look, you can't challenge
it as a tort.

We've got all the existing remedies under which

you can challenge Customs seizures, Customs detentions. **

And

they only had to do with the detention itself, not with what
might happen after the goo Is were detained.

If they were lost,

if they ware damaged in sane other way, because I chink as you
pointed out, Mr. Chief Justice* the words simply could have

22
been, "or failure to return goods or merchandise by any officer
of customs.”
QUESTIONs

Well, I would, on the contrary, I would

read detention to mean just exactly that.
MR. LEWIN:
temporary meaning.
permanent loss.

Wall, detention I think carries a very
A detention is something which is not a

Failure to return I think is a permanent loss.

A detention means you temporarily ara keeping somebody, either
keeping a person detained or keeping the goods detained, but
it certainly has a limit, it sounds as if it's a limitation in
time in some way by people who were responsible officers of
the government.
QUESTION;

Mr. Lewin, perhaps this, I guess it was

suggested by my brother Relinquish5s question, but if there
were no 2680(c) as it’s been construed by the Court of Claims,
you’d, still have, there’d still be a question of whether or
not the Court of Claims had jurisdiction of this lawsuit, would
there not?

You "d say that perhaps the answer is pretty clear,

but in any event, there would be a question?
MR. LEWIN:

There would be a question.

I think the

Court of Claims has indicated that it would view it very
possibly as an. implied contract.
QUESTION:
MR. LEWIN:
QUESTION:

It was brought under 1491» wasn’t it?
Yes, sir, the Tucker Act.,,
And as an implied contract claim, not as

23
a constitutional claim?
MR» LEWIN:

Not as a constitutional claim, no? it

was an implied contract»
QUESTION:
MR» LEWIN:

And not. founded upon an act of Congress?
Well, that was an alternative claim that

ORAL .ARGUMENT OF KENT L. JONES, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES
MR. JONES;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court s
The Federal Tort Claims Act and the Tucker Act are
not the only statutes that are relevant in this case, and they
are not the only remedies that could be available in this con­
text .
It is our position that petitioner brought his claim
on the vrarong theory and in the wrong forum.

Petitioner has

conceded in his reply brief that the very claim that he seeks
to raise as a contract claim under the Tucker Act traditionally
has been brought as a tort action against Customs officers in­
dividually in federal district court.

For over 200 years it

has been settled at common law that a Customs officer may be
sued in tort for the negligent performance of his office, and
in particular for the negligent loss of goods that have been
seized for forfeiture, arid for over 100 years, the United
States has consented by statute, 28 USC .2006, to pay the tort
judgment entered against the Customs officer, so long as the
seizure was mad© with probable cause,■as it surely was in this
case.

25

QUESTION:

Mr. Jones,, on the question of negligence

under such an action, would the mere failure to return be
sufficient to make out a prima facie case of negligence?

Say

all they know is that the goods were seised and not returned.
MR. JONES:

He'd have to prove that they weren't forfeit, if that

was an open issue.
QUESTION:

Supposing he proved title but ha doesn't

know what happened to them.

Would that be enough to prove

negligence?
MR. JONES;

Wall, I think it would be enough to

create a presumption of negligence, probably on a -QUESTION:

Res ipsa locutor?

MR. JONES;

— res ipsa locutor theory.

It may de­

pend on the context -~
QUESTION:

It’s an action against the individual

officer, isn't it, as opposed to against the United States?
MR. JONES:
QUESTION:
MR. JONES;
QUESTION:

Yes, it is.
The traditional action?
That's right.
And it's a presumption that the indi­

vidual he happens to name as the defendant in the complaint
has been guilty of negligence?
MR. JONES:

Well, the individual that he happens to

name has to be the Customs officer, and the presumption would

26

be that if the goods were lost, without explanation, the bur­
den would ba on the Customs officer to show that he exercised
due diligence and that the goods — that he was at fault for
■the loss of the goods.
QUESTION:

Her© he was not at fault.

One cannot tell from the complaint whe­

ther the claim is — all we know is that the goods disappeared,
allegedly, and it could have been that they were negligently
lost or it could have been that they were negligently stolen,
or it could have been that they were converted.
MR. JONES:

No, but in the case of stolen goods, say

a third party broke into a government, Customs warehouse and
stole the goods.

There’s no government negligence.

There

then would be no .remedy under the Federal Tort Claims Act,

implied contract, bailment remedy.
What I a® suggesting is that the tort and the con­
tract remedies are not necessarily coextensive?
MR. JONES;

He only has to pay the value of the goods themselves

that are lost.

It is a basic principle of contractual bail­

ment that the contractual bailee would ha liable for all
damages relating to the loss of the goods, including the con­
sequential losses.
QUESTION

Who has to prove that the customs of­

ficer had possession of them in the first place?

I know what

the papers said, but does somebody lave to prove that h©
actually received — that these $165,000 worth of goods ware
actually there in the first place?
MR. JCUESs

I would think that he would have to

prove they came into the possession of the customs officer.
He would then have to prove that they were lost due -to his
negligence.

But the unexplained absence would create the

presumption of negligence.
QUESTIONS

It would have to --

But there wouldn't be any presumption

that ha received them, would there?
MR. JONESs
QUESTIONs

No, that would be subject to proof.
And if common law — weren’t there

at least three different standards of proof, depending on
whether you ware a bailee for hire or a bailee for the
benefit of the bailor or bailee for the benefit of the
bailee?

(Laughter)
Petitioner never sought to invoke 'this traditional
statutory tort remedy for the''’claimed loss of his goads.
\

Instead, he sought to bring his tort claim as a contract
action in the Court of Claims.

But the jurisdiction o£ the

Court of Claims over contracts with the United States extends,
of course, only to consant.ua! agreements.

It doesn't

encompass tort or quasi-contractual claims where by fiction
of law a promise is imputed to perform a legal duty without

29
regard to the intent of the parties.
Wally the fundamental defect with the petitioner’s
action in the Court of Claims is that the traditional duty
of customs officers to care for seised goods is quite plainly
imposed by lav; and not by any agreement.

In this Court® s

decision in the Thomas case in 1872, and in Justice Story’s
opinion in Burke v. Trevitfc in 1816, the duty of customs
officers to care for seized goods was held to derive from
their official obligation to perform their office with due
care or due diligence.

It was not derived from any implied

contractual undertaking entered into at. the time of seizure.
And there is in fact nothing at all contractual or consentual
about the seizure of goods for forfeiture.
As Justice Story

stated in his commentaries,

there is no voluntary election at seizure.

The goods are

seised by justifiable force and not by consent or agreement.
There is —
QUESTION:

Do you fchnk

there is any difference

in the kind of seizure, whether it is somewhere just off the
coast or while they are unloading a .ship at midnight or
seized in the customs house, as a matter of law?
MR. JONES s

I think as a flatter of law, the only

difference is that the person who brings the goods into the
port under a false declarations is engaging in white collar
smuggling.

It is only necessary to prove that the goods

30
are forfeit to show that the false declaration was mads
negligently, and it hasn't been disputed.

I am. not sure it

was disputed in the petitioner's opening argument, but it
hasn't been disputed before, that this was negligent when
these false statements were negligent.

They ware in fact

eoncedeclly made, obvious errors were conceded and no applana­
tion was given other than that we were negligent in making
those obvious mistakes.
Well, the government's interest in preventing
negligent these kind of unexplained negligent entries into
the country is just as important as its interests in pre­
venting intentional entries into the country.
QUESTION?

You say that they seized tha goods in

either situation, that title leaves the ostensible owner,
whatever title was in the possessor has gone even if the
title of the United States does not become perfect, is that
your position?
MR, JONES:

1 would think that the result would

b© the same for any kind of forfeiture.

The question is

whether Congress has decreed 'the forfeiture.

In 1592 it

decreed that forfeiture for if you were negligent false
statements.
QUESTION:

And then it is redeemed, as it was

here, if that is the right word, that is in affect a sale
back, is that the idea?

31
MR. JOKESi
QUESTION;
MR. JOKES;

NO, it is ~
Buying it back?
— it is under 19 U.S.C. 1618, the

Secretary of the 'Treasury can upon petition remit any for­
feiture if h© decides that the violation of the customs laws
was not dons with willful fraud or there are othar mitigating
circumstances,

Well, as I understand the petitions in this

case, it appears that what was made out was a case of negli­
gent misstatement and not willful fraud, so the Secratary
determined that h© would exact only a $40,000 penalty and
then returned the remaining goods in his possession.

Wow,

there is np question that the goods that were missing in
this case ware missing long before the forfeiture was re­
mitted ,
I also think I should point out that our brief
wasn't sure whether petitioner was trying to say that their
remission was itself a contract, and so w© brief the issue,
although we didn't think it was presented in the case.

It

is clean: to me from petitioner's reply brief that they don't
think that the remission is a separate contract.

All they

are saying is that it evidences the intention of the govern­
ment at the time they seized the goods.

Well,

I think it

may evidence our intention, and'.what it indicates is that
we thought the goods were forfeited but we decided on re­
flection that we would exact a lesser penalty.

32
Justice Story described customs officers as quasi­
bailees of seised goods because the duty imposed on then by
law bears only some analogy to the duty created in a true
contractual bailment.

In a contractual bailment? goods come

into the possession of the bailee by mutual assent, and it
is fundamental that the contractual bailee cannot dispute
the title of the bailor.

But when the United States seizes

goods for forfeiture, it does so for th© very purpose and
with the very intent of disputing title and a seizure is ac­
complished by lawful force and not by agreement.
Well, the quasi-bailee status of customs officers
has been recognized by federal statute since the First
Congress.
U.S.C.

Some of them have been referred to — 1605, 19

1605 directs the customs officer to hold the goods in

his possession.
And one aspect of the quasi-bailment under both
common law and —
QUESTION;

How, the Court of Claims didn't deal

with whether this was a claim under federal statute?
MR. JONES;

The claim wasn't presented.

I think

under this Court's reasoning in Tesfcan, it couldn't be sus­
tained.

Th© statute doesn't by its terms purport to create

any action in money damages against th© United States.

It

simply says to th© collector — rather the customs officer,
in its current words, to hold the goods while the —

33
QUESTIONs

But there is a provision somewhere that,

says if at the end of some litigation the government loses,
they are suppose to return it,
MR. JONES5

Okay.

That is 24S5.

That provision

says that if a forfeiture proceeding is brought and the claim­
ant prevails in the forfeiture proceeding, then the goods
must be returned.

That is what the law would require, and

that is by statute,
QUESTION;

I suppose you would say that wouldn't

create any claim under the federal statute.
MR. JONES;

It wouldn't create a claim against the

United States.
QUESTION;
MR. JONES;

Why?
Well, if you trace th© history of that

provision, which goes back to the First Congress -QUESTION:

I know, but the reason I take it is

that that statute created no substantive right, is that it?
MR. JONES;

It created no right of money damages

against the United States,

It created a right of the return

of the goods and that right is enforceable against the
customs officer.

He has th® duty to return the goods.

If

he doesn’t return the goods, then th© injured party can go
to federal District Court to su© the customs officer person­
ally in negligence.
QUESTION;

So you would say that in order to sustain

34
the action against the United States, that statute would have
said-that upon failure to return the United States shall pay
damages?

It would have to say that?
MR. JONESs

I think it would have to ccsne close to

— much sloser to saying that than what it.does say.

I don3

think it would have to use those talismatic words, but it
should come mush sloser.

As the statute stands now, it is a

direction for the disposition of the property and there are
other alternative remedies for —
QUESTION;

Although if somebody said there was a bail­

ment contract here, you wouldn’t require some express provision
in the contract, you would just say everybody knows a contract
that is breached calls for damages.
MR. JONES;

Well, the Tucker Act creates jurisdiction

for claims brought under the contracts, so you wouldn't have
any trouble finding a source of authority for that.

But the

Tucker Act, in creating jurisdiction for statutory claims
doesn't specify what kinds of claims can bs brought under the
statute.
Monday.

This Court has grappled with that and did so on
I don’t think it is — I know it is not relevant in

this case in terms of deciding the case because the petitioner
hasn’t claimed that he has any right against the United States
under the —
QUESTION;
MR. JONES:

He claims thera is a contract.
That’s right.

He claims on contract

35
which is by definition a consensual relationship and, as I
have already discussed, there isn’t anything consensual about
the origin of the relationship -that he relies on which is
i.

the seizure of the goods.
But petitioner does try to make a reliance on the
statute that you referrad to# and the way he uses it is; that
he says that customs officers and importers are aware of
this legal duty to return the goods in some circumstances
and that because they are aware of that legal duty there is
a tacit understanding or contract for the duty to be per­
formed.
Well, under petitioner's logic, any duty imposed
by law on federal, officers could b© said to create a con­
tract with the public for the duty to be performed.

For

example, the warden of a prison could be said to contract
to release a prisoner at the expiration of his prison term.
Well, that is precisely the kind of reasoning that this
Court has long rejected in cases holding that the Court of
Claims lacks jurisdiction over contracts implied: in law
where a promise to perform a legal duty is imputed simply
by fiction of law.
In fact,

the Court of Claims rejected petitioner's

reasoning under the very statute that he relies on, including
20 U.S.G. 2465, holding in .1868, in the Sehmalz case that a
general law cannot imply & contract with a citizen, there

36
must be a genuine consensual relationship.
Well, as we have already discussed, the Court of
Claims —

government was also involved, involving the General Allot­
ment Act and the duty of the United States with respect to
the timber?
MR. JONES:

I didn't head that lead into your

sentence.
QUESTION:

Well, is this part of your argument

similar to the government's argument in that case?
MR. JONES:

Well, it is not similar because it is

QUESTION:

The Court of Claims went th© other way.

Of course, it

didn't have 2680 (c) to bother with.
MR. JONES:

Well, Mitchell was a eas® based on a

statute, not on a contract.
QUESTION:
MR. JONES:

Right, but the claim was a trust.
It was a claim based saying that a

statute providing for a particular relationship is a statute
that creates a money claim against the United States.

QUESTIONS

Didn’t it also rely on the fact that

there v?ere powers of attorney between the United States and

MR. JONES;

I think they decide a very broad proposition there

and I think that that broad proposition shows up in their
later decisions in the Cherry case, the broad proposition
being that any statute that mentions or impliabiy talks about
a trust relationship is a statute that requires the United
States to pay money damages if the statute is breached.
QUESTION?

Perhaps my question was a little wide

mark and maybe also unfair? but that case was argued

Monday and it is over.
MR. JONES:

Well, we do agree with petitioner that

the Federal Tort Claims Act has only a tangential relevance
to this case.

In f&c-fc, our dispute with petitioner about

the proper construction of the act could be called hypothetical.

Circuit and —
QUESTION:

Was that called to the attention of the .

Court of Claims?
MR. JONES2

It was not called to the attention

Court of Claims.
QUESTION:

So you don't say that 2680, even if it

means what the Court of Claims thought it meant, insulates
the Unit©! Statos from any suit in the Court of Claims on
a contract?
MR. JONESs

No, we don't take the position that

2680(c) refers to contracts, contract claims.

QUESTION?

Well, your position is that the United

States doesn't need to be insulated against a suit in the
Court of Claims, the plaintiff has to show an affirmative
authorisation to sue in the Court of Claims?
MR. JONESi

Because he brought it under a contract

theory, he has to show a contract.

Maybe it would help if

I pointed out that there is a Court of Claims rsmedy if need
be for this kind of claim negligent loss of goods.

After you

sue the private customs officers, you get a judgment and the
judgment, if there was probable causa for the seizure, is
to be executed against the Secretary of the Treasury rather
than the privates party,

Well, if for some reason the

Do you know whether that has ever hap-

MR. JONESs

I don't think it has ever been neces-

sary.
QUESTION:
MR. JONESs
QUESTION:

That isn't what I asked you.
The Treasury has always paid.
But it has never happened, so the answer

is nof is that right?
MR. JONESs

Yes,

The Federal Tort Claims Act has

a limited significance in this case.

Both sides have agreed

that Congress adopted the Tort Claims Act exception for
customs detentions in section 268 0(c)

in recognition of -the

fact that there were adequate preexisting remedias for
persons who were seized — whose goods are seized by the
customs officers.
There' is t.n argument about whether the language of
2680(c) requires that construction, permits it or doesn't.
I think that the answer is that it certainly permits the
construction, and what we have to decide is whether the

40
legislative history of the act indicates Congress® intent
to cover the situation where there is a private remedy under
28 U.S.C* 2006»

And petitioner concedes that the traditional

preexisting remedy is the remedy under 28 U.S.C. 2006 for
negligent loss of goods.
Section 2006 provides only a limited remedy against
the United States.

Th© United States pays the judgment in

the private action for negligent loss of goods only if the
seizure is made with probable cause, and petitioner arguas
that the remedy is so limited that it is inadequate and thus
Congress didn't mean to preserve it as th© sole remedy for
the loss of goods.
Well, the remedy in section 2006 is obviously
adequate in all cases where the goods ware seised for prob­
able cause, for the reason I just mentioned.

The judgment

in those cases is 'not paid by the customs officer, it is
paid by the United States Treasury.
In the relatively few cases where a seizure is?
made without probable cause, the Unit©:! States will not

.pay

th® judgment but the customs officer then remains personally
liable.

Indeed, the officer is liable on a theory of conver­

sion for consequential damages as wall as the value of the
goods themselves.
Well, that, retained personal liability obviously
serves the government's interests in preventing misconduct

41
by its offiers.

The limitation in section 2006 seems de­

signed to advance the government's interest in prohibiting
unlawful seizures.

It doesn’t make the entire remedial

scheme inadequate.
The relevance of the Tort Claims Act exception
and the history of the act to this case to us seems to be
simply that it evidences Congress’ intent not to disturb the
limited preexisting remedy under section 2006 by assuming a
general tort responsibility for customs seizures.
As the Court of Claims reasoned in this case, the
government cannot, as petitioner claims, impliedly assent in
fact to a contract liability for acts that it has refused by
law to be responsible for in tort.

Or stated another way,

the specific remedial provision in 28 D.S.C. 2006 should
control over the more general provisions of either the
Federal Tort Claims Act or the Tucker Act, and I think that
was essentially the reasoning that this Court decided the
Stanzilero cas® on.
For these reasons, wa think that judgment of the
Court of Claims should be affirmed.

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.

Mr. Lewin, do you have anything further?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF NATHAN LEWIN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER—REBUTTAL
MR. LEWIN:

Yes, sir.

May it please the Court:

42

Mr. Jonas has been speaking throughout his argu­
ment about the traditional remedy under 2006 and saying that
we have conceded that that is a remedy that has traditionally
b©@n applicable.

By no means, 2006 is not a statute which

grants any remedy whatever.

Although a hundred years ago

and more, there were suits against individual collectors of
customs, there are not suits today against individual
collectors of customs which — I think he said during the
course of colloquy — Treasury has always paid,

Thase suits

simply don't exist.

,

Since the Tort Claims Act has been enacted, since
the United States has agreed to be sued directly, the only
suits that I have found reference to in this regard have
bean, for example, the Alliance Insurance Company case,
which, was a suit that was brought ~
QUESTIOM:

That is because of the plaintiff's

choice to sue the United States rather than the collector
personally

^

MR, LEWINs

But given, that..,the United Statas has

new decided that individual employees ara no longer to be
sued, they passed the Federal Tort Claims Act so you don’t
have to go running after the individual employee, it is just
totally inconsistent with the current thrust of federal
statuta and remedies against the federal government to say
you have to sue under the cause of action that you held 150

43
years ago against a collector of customs and under a Civil
War statute, 2006, which appears in the footnote on page 27
of the government's brief, is a statute passed in 1863 to
keep levies from being made against the property of
collectors of customs — executions shall not issue against
a collector»

It doesn't say you may bring a suit against

the collector or you may bring a suit against the United
States.

It says don’t execute — when you bring on© of

these suits, which people have brought against individual
collectors.» you can't execute against his property because
th© United States will pay if he has been acting with
probable cause.

That is not a traditional remedy.

It is

just not framed in those terms, it never has been a tradi­
tional remedy.
In terms of this actually being an implied con­
tract in fact, the fact that there isn’t that much of a
consensual arrangement still doesn’t make it different from
cases in which the United States, for example, in a taking,
for example, has flooded somebody’s property — this Court
has had cases such as the Dickenson and Lynah case, we
guoted from the Lynah case -QUESTION:

That is involved in the Fifth Amend­

ment;# isn’t it?
MR. LEWIN:

That is partly involved in th© Fifth

Amendment, but this Court has very clearly said, language

in no circumstances does either a taking or there was an

Learned Hand in the C, F. Harms case, where a barge was taken.

You go through a procedure.

The United States ought

It is certainly not

fair to impose that obligation for that loss on an individual
importer who is totally blameless.
QUESTIONS

Doesn't the Firth Amendment contemplate

taking for the use of th© government and not the negligent
loss of it?
MR. LEWINs
this is a taking.

That is why there is no claim that

What we are saying is that it is an impiis!

bailment in an implied contract in which the United States,
if it has it for government purposes in. its possession for
temporary detention, if it gives it back that is fine,
there is no suit for th© detention.

But certainly if the

45
United States for one reason or another doesn’t give all the
property back, then it is the one- who should be held liable
for policy reasons.
QUESTION;

Dickenson and Lynah in part depend on

the fact that where the government takes and doesn't bring
an action, the person who is the victim of the taking has
to bring an action for invars® taking and has to show an
authority on the part of the government to take and the taking
isn’t enough.

Isn’t -that what Frankfurter’s language in

Dickenson refers to?
MR. LEWINs

In Dickenson he talks about it baring

an implied premise to pay for tha consequences of building
a dam which spreads water on somebody’s property, there is
an implied promise.

And Judge Hand spoke about the,bailment,

an implied contract where you take a barge in emergency
circumstances, tha Army had neither asked no leave of tha
railroad for anything it might do, it could move it when it
chose.

Everybody understood that.

Tha railroad understood

that and therefore there was nothing lacking that wan essen­
tial to a bailment.

He said that was a bailment»
