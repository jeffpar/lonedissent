MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Whitham, you may proceed whenever you are

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WARREN WHITHAM, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS ESTES ET AL.
MR. WHITHAM:

Mr. Chief Justice, and Members of the

Court:
This is a school desegregation case involving the
Dallas Independent School District which is situated primarily
in the City of Dallas, Tessas, although the boundaries are not
coterminous.
Involved in this case is remedy and remedy alone
with respect to this petitioner which I will hereinafter refer
to as the School District.
School District.

The Estes petitioners are th©

Our position is --

QUESTION:

At your convenience, Mr. Whitham, and

perhaps your friends will comment on the seme, first this case
is here now because we have granted the writ, but ar© there
any issues in this case that could not have been resolved
after the District Courts have carried out th© remand direc­
tions?
MR. WHITHAM:

There is a great issue involved here,

and I think it becomes even, a greater issue, Mr, Chief

5
Justice, in view of this Court’s resent opinions in Columbus
and Dayton of last July which in effect may well bring all
of us, North and South, East and West, to a common problem
if de jura segregation is now to be, in effect, arrived at
either by old State law or constitution, or by the inability
to overcome presumptions and evidentiary matters.
The issue here is, Mr. Chief Justice, to return tc
your question, if I may, whether or not the elimination of all
one race schools, given the urban condition in the large ur­
ban school district described by the courts below and in
these petitions, is the controlling factor to be considered.
I may well b® rising to ask this Court to take the great
broad principles enunciated in Swann, parh&ps address those
again, perhaps recognise that the lower courts have taken
those principias and taken the tools referred to in that
case, b® it transportation, attendant zone changes, satellit­
ing, paring, clustering, to address the question of whether
the tools discussed have somehow or other been elevated to
the principles of Swann, a circumstance that I would
respectfully suggest is creating untold turmoil for the
district courts of this land and th® school boards of this
land in trying to find out what is a plan that would ulti­
mately arrive at a unitary school system.
The district court ia this ease formulated a plan
which the school district initially opposed, but in an

6
©fforfc to get out of court# to besom® that stranger to
school desegregation proceedings that the Fifth Circuit ac­
cuses us of net being# the school board# 9 to nothing, has
voted to support this plan of tbs district court, and this
plan was remanded by the Fifth Circuit.

So yes, I stand

here readily admitting that this court has taken a case where
technically tie court of appeals ha3 rejected the plan, and
this school district is hare urging that this Court affirm
the district court's plan as being a solution for public ed~
ucation in the urban environment# given the facts of this
case.
Now, what are some of the facts that bring us here,
this-long history they speak of of Dallas School District
litigation?

J*nd before I get into that, let m© say, remedy

is all that's involved — I want to emphasise that — this
school district recognises it is located in a State that
by State constitution required separation of the races.

This

school district recognises it had a first and prior de­
segregation lawsuit pending against it, filed in 1955 follow­
ing Brown II.

It had a history in the courts until 1965.

Admittedly through that plan in IS67, a stair step plan
reached its fiaal implementation.

This school district is

cognisant of tils Court's observations concerning stair step
plans, and we ir@ not here saying that's the beginning and
the end, and that we should not still be searching for a

7
remedy, in view of prior language of this Court, concerning
stair stop plans.
But on October 6, 1970, a new plan was formulated
for this — ox a new lawsuit, a new school desegregation law­
suit was filed, by separate parties representing black and

Mexican-American students.
problem ©f formulating now ,

In this lawsuit, we have the
and the district court had a

problem of formulating, and this school board was charged
with the duty of drafting a plan that had these difficult
components; ti at there had been numerous demographic changes
partly as a result of the prior desegregation order and
remedy.
It is now a minority Anglo school district, and a
tri-ethnic remedy is required,

At the time of the first

remedy bewaring in July of 1971, the school district was
probably 59 percent Anglo and a lesser percent black and
Maxicah-Americ an.

At the time this second hearing was hold

in February of 1976, from which hearing the plan now before

i
this Court came atout, the district had dropped to 41 parcent
Anglo, 44,.5 percent black, and 13.4 percent. Mexican-American.
Now, the first appeal in the July of '71 remedy
which the schcol district supported — the school district
supported whatever the district court there ordered — the
Fifth Circuit sent it back, but the Fifth Circuit itself
sat on that case for virtually four years.

Summer of ’71 you

8
have the trial,,

Dec ©tuber 2 of ’ll you have oral argument in

the Fifth Circuit.

July 23, 1975, you finally have an opin­

ion from the Fifth Circuit with respect to the July of 871
remedy.

Therefore w@ start again on hearings February 2,

1976, on how t.o formulate a rsnedy„
liability.

Again, no question of

The school district, has put that aside.

The

school district simply wants to find out what it is that the
district court, and the court of appeals can finally come to
agree upon as a renedy for a large urban school district
with an ever-decreasing Angle population and with an everincreasing minority population, and being in the Southwest
with a remarkable ever-growing Maxlean-American population.
At this tira®, as of this October, if the district
court were to now be formulating a plan, it would b© looking
at October's figures where it has now dropped to Anglo of
32.2 percent, Mexican-Amarican of 17.26 percent, and black
of 49.4 perc ant.
Over the ten years that this second desegregation
case has bean pending involving the Dallas Independent School
District, there has been a drop of minus 58 parcent of the
Anglo population, as ©f the day I stand here, in this school
district.

There has been an increase of 17.3 percent in the

black scholastic population, and these figures are scholastic ,
%

not total people population —
QUESTION?

And the percentages.

9
MR. WHXTHAMs

And the percentages, and there, as

to fch© Mexican-American, scholastic population, has been an
amazing increase in this 10-year period of 56.7 parcent of
M ex ic an -Am ar ic&u children*
How, how did ws come to this circumstance?

We are

in the strange; circumstance that Mex ican-Amerleans ware never
separated by State law in Texas.

They were treated as white.

From this poirt on, if I refer to Anglo, black and MexicanAmerican, I as. speaking in terms of desegregation as we spmk
of it in the American Southwest, to have descriptive terminol­
ogy.
On July 16, 1971, the district court ma.de a finding
of liability against the school district that there were
vestiges of a state imposed school system as to blacks.

As
W©

The district court,

The district court mad© a

specific finding that there was no d@ jura showing that the
plaintiffs had failed in their burden of proof to show d®
jure segregation of the Mexican-American student? however,
the district court ordered that the Maxlean-American b©
treated as a separate ethnic group for purposes of a de­
segregation remedy, and in its July 23, 1975 opinion, the
court of appeals affirmed that.
Therefore, and this court —

10
QUESTION:

Had the State constitution prior to

1954 required the segregation of Mexican--Americans?
MR. WHITHAM:

No, sir.

Mr. Justice Stewart, in

Texas where the Mexican-American case cones before th© courts,
you are dealing in terms of the North and the West as to
black in finding State action in local school board authority,
not in State statute, not in State constitution.
QUESTION:

But in State constitution and/or statute,

there had bear a requirement of segregation of Negro students?
is that it?
MR. WHITHAM:
QUESTION:

Well ~

Until 1954.

MR. WHITHAM:

Blacks.

Article 7 Section 7 of th©

Texas Constitution.
QUESTION:

Said what?

MR. WHITHAM:

Said that children should be separated

in school by race, black and white.

No reference to

Mexican-Americans.
QUESTI®':

And Mexican-Asterleans are white?

MR. WHITHAM %

Were treated as whit®, and had be®n

for many years until th® demands for cultural recognition of
this very growing Maxican-Amerlean population has now caused
that ethnic group to wish to fe@ treated as a minority.
QUESTION:

But there was never de jure school

segregation of that ethnic group? is that correct?

MR. WHITHAM:

Never by State statute; never by

By Stata statute or State constitution.

x

The twenty minutes allotted for a

cas© this complex for the school district is simply, I must
say, inadequate to get the story over.
The district court became dissatisfied with the
school district's plan and with th® NAACP plan and called a
special meeting on September 16 of '7S for the community to
come together, all parties in the lawsuit.

The district

court then asked a tri-ethnic civic group to com© up with a
plan.

That tri-ethnic civic group did come up with some

concepts„

Th® district court then ordered that tri-ethnic

group to come in as araicus curie and present seme evidence.
\
The district court then ordered the school district to take
that tri-ethnic group of citizens'■ concepts and flesh them
up into & student assignment plan.
What you have before you is the result of a triethnic group seeking to formulate a remedy for the Dallas
Independent School District.

I will move on.

Th® court of appeals became very concerned over
time and distance studies.

Time and distance studies were

13
not necessary here.

Time and distance studies were used

simply as an coccuse to get around Swann's great dilemma, and
I must hurry and say what it is.

When you say there is to

be no requirement of racial balance, but you say on the
other hand, you must eliminate one-race schools, you leave
the lower courts and school boards with a tremendous diffi­
culty of how do you accommodate to that dilemma?

That

dilemma must be resolved in the urban condition, but when the
court of appeals sent this case back, it overlooked the
record on time and distance as surely as anything in th®
world,
The plaintiff's own witness, Professor Willie,
on Appendix 52 you will see his statement, "I mad© time and
distance studies and it takes too long to go from North
Dallas to East Oak Cliff,e' which is the predominantly thing,
Th© plaintiff's own lawyer, my friend and brother, Mr.
Cloutman, who will argue here, made a tin© and distance
study and let it go at that, where it would take 35 minutes
and 22 mi las to get from the predominant- whit® area to th©
predominant black area, and he admits he mad© that test on
neon on a Sunday, which is completely illogical.

But th®

Fifth Circuit had that before it.
The court of appeals had before it the court's own
expert witness who said, "You can't do crosstown bussing
that requires a travel time greater than 30 minutes," and

14
they recognized that when fchay formulated their plan.
QUESTION:

Well, when the district court conducts

its time and distance studies, won’t the court of appeals
have a different problem?
MR„ WHITHAM:

If you conduct those time and dis­

tance studies, all the court of appeals will find is what
all of the parties to this lawsuit knew and what the district
judge knew, ard the district judge has had this case in the
palm of his hand for 10 years, and that is that the time and
distance from where the Anglolive and where the predomi­
nantly minority areas are is too far and is beyond all of
Swann's teachings with respect to transportation»
Alse I would point out that of the now 32 percent
Anglosthat ve deal with in this district to be a part of a
remedy, that not all of them live in just the north and east,
the so-called yellow strips you will sea in the appendices at
219.

Probably 45 percent of those remaining Anglos

QUESTION:

You may finish your sentence.

MR. KHITHAM:

~ to com® to grips in th© urban

society with an ever-growing Anglo population, with th®
plaintiffs in their own plan admitting three times

and

it's in the record and in the briefs — that distance is too

15
far from th© vrhltes, that the growing black population is
too far from the ever-deereasing Anglo population, that the
condition and, quality of schools in the so-called East Oak
Cliff or predominantly black areas warrant them remaining
one race, when, you see that the court of appeals in its
opinion in effect virtually pays tribute to the district
judge for having considered the many complex factors in­
volved in the urban society and formulated a comprehensive
plan for a remedy, but simply because they will not face up
to th© dilemma of no racial balance and eliminate one-race
schools, have.played volleyball with desegregation cases, in­
cluding this ens on the remedy, and sent it back to th©
district court, then in the urban society we will never,
naver be able to bring these difficult meitters to an end.
I appreciate your courtesy.
MR. CHIEF. JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Whitham.

Mr. Biumenthal„
DEAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT L. BLUMENTHAL, ESQ.,
CM BEHALF OF PETITIONERS CURRY ET AL.
MR. BLUMENTHAL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court, the issue in this case, does the
Constitution mandate forced transportation of students in'".*
the previously segregated State school system where private
housing patterns are racially imbalanced, is one that con­
cerns Curry,

The Court has previously answered that question

16
yes, and it has done it on two assumptions»

One, it is

assumed that because there was once State-enforced segrega­
tion it somehow happened to creato the racial imbalance which
exists in the housing pattern, and the second is the assump­
tion that once that imbalance is created, the school system
can remedy it.
It is CurrySs position that both of those assump­
tions ar© false.

In this case, both of those assumptions

have been helc. by the district court as a fact not to haves
existed.

The district court found that it was private hous­

ing patterns which caused the racial imbalance, not anything
that was aver don© by the Dallas Independent School District.
And indeed, the experience of Dallas post 1965, during the
time that the court was mandating all student assignments,
would amply indicate that that finding is true and is based
on th© evidence.

During that period there was a fluid move­

ment of schools that went from all white to all black.
In 1971 , children were bussed from South Oak Cliff
High School, an all-black school, to Carter High School, a
predominantly whit® school,

In 1976 the effort was how to

relieve Carter High School, which was then a some 75 or 80
percent black school from its predominantly minority status.
Biit in 1965 when the Fifth Circuit adopted a racially neutral
school policy, South Oak Cliff was an all-white school.
The shifting populations, the integration of the

17
city, is a whole different thing? you are dealing with a
different problem than was dealt with in the Fifties or the
post-Brown in the period of school districts attempting to
maintain segregation.

But even more vividly pointed out is

the false assumption that the school district can remove onerace schools.

In city after city after city circuit courts

and indeed this Court have ordered school districts to
racially chance the makeup of their cities.
them to eliminate one-race schools.

You've asked

You might as well ask

them to nail currant jelly to the wall, because fchay'v® been
unable to do it unless you concede, unless you believe that
Detroit has succeeded in eliminating one-race schools, or
Cleveland, or Oakland, or Kansas City, or Atlanta, or the
District of Columbia.

3f that's the perception of having

eliminated ths ©ne-rac® school, then perhaps it’s possible.
But in fact what has happened in case after case after case,
and what lias happened in the Dallas Independent School
District, is that every attempt by the district court and
every attempt by a school district to mandate student
assignment, to force transport, to rearrange the school
district, has net with a minority isolated district itself,
on® in which any hop© for integrated education dies, and on©
ultimately that loses the community support so vital to a
school district.
In this eas® w® have testimony from Dr. Coleman,

18
who you know is the noted sociologist, the father of the
Coleman Report, the authority on school segregation, the one
who wrote the report in 1960, that the result of this type of
transportation will ultimately be a resegregated district.
QUESTION:

Mr. Blumenthal, may I interrupt?

MR. BHJMENTHAL:
QUESTION:

Yes, Mr. Justice.

I read these briefs some little time

ago and I remember that -the Estes parties and the Curry par­
ties and the Erinegar parties take differing positions.
MR. BLUMENTHAL:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

We've heard from Mr. Whitham represent­

ing the Estes party who ask us that they are supporting the
district court decree.
MR. BLUMENTHAL:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

What is your basic position?

MR. BLUMENTHAL:

Our basic position, sir, is to

reverse both the district court and the court of appeals, to
tell the district court that if it finds discrimination, re­
move it.

If there is something that it can remedy, remedy it,

but it is under no requirement by the Constitution, the 14th
Amendment doss not mandate the transportation of children in
& formerly State segregated school unless there is some dis­
crimination that is being remedied in particular.
QUESTION:

Well, I don't think, in Judge McMillan's

case, I don't chink our Court — perhaps I'm mistaken, but I

19

don't think our Court has over 3aid that the Constitution
mandates bussing of students* but simply ‘that it's a permis­
sible tool in a desegregation decree* once the court has
found unconstitutional segregation*
MR. BLUMENTHAL;

I think that’s correct*

But, sir, you've also imposed a

presumption that any formerly State segregated school has had
a system-wide violation, and a system-wide violation calls for
a ayStan-wide remedy, and the only system-wide remedy is
forced transportation*

And if you would make it clear to a

district court and to the Fifth Circuit to quit reversing,
just because you haven't, quote, "bussed enough."
QUESTIONS

Why do you say that the only cur® for a

system-wide violation is bussing?
QUESTION:

Yea.

MR. BLUMENTHAL:

Because that’s the only cure that

tli® Fifth Circuit certainly has indicated is appropriate.
Every other account in the first hearing, there was television,
there was majority and minority, there were all of the
various -- magnet schools —• all of the panoply of efforts
to integrate schools, and the Fifth Circuit rigidly reversed
and said, "You haven’t made constitutional muster, see Swann
and the remedies prescribed in Swarm," again with bussing,
with this —
QUESTION:

Thos© are remedies permitted in Swarm.

MR. BLUMENTHAL:

Bag pardon?

20
QUESTION:

They were not prescribed remedies in

Swann, wore they?
MR. BLUMENTHAL:

Mr. Justice Stewart, the Fifth

Circuit in the reading by the district courts certainly, if
you read his record, read his statements to counsel, he is
saying I am mandated to bus by the Fifth Circuit, and that's
really the only fair reading of the 1976 opinion.

It's the

only fair reading, I believe, of the 1975 opinion, and the
only really feir reading of the 1976 opinion, which is
more —QUESTION:

And the district court's decree man­

dated so-called bus-sing of some what, 17,000?
MR* BLUMENTHAL:

The last decree I believe man­

dated the busxraog of some 17 to 20,000 of whom only about
10,000 are still in the school district.
have disappeared.

The rest of them

20 percent of the blacks who were to be

bussed have disappeared.
The middle class opts out of the system, black or
white.

It's not a purely racial thing.

But the circuit

court has said eliminat® one-race schools, and the only way
they can suppose that you can eliminate one-race schools is
to force assigned students.
QUESTION:

Well, the district court did not eli­

minate one-race schools, and that’s what the court of appeals
found wrong with it

21
MR,, BLUMENTHAL:

Tha district court only has 41,000

Anglo students' left, and they cannot h© distributed around the
district like —
QUESTION;

So what is it you quarrel about with the

district court:*s decree?
MR. BLUMENTHAL:

Well, the district court’s decree

in making its forced assignments has now removed us from a
57,000 Anglo student to 41, and the continuation of that de­
cree is going to ultimately bring this into a racially iso­
lated district, in which no one can ever achieve the benefits
of an integrated education.
QUESTION s
ing.

That may or may not be post hoc reason­

Post hoc ergo propter hoc, you’ve heard —
MR. BLUMENTHAL:

Well, it was predicted precisely

by th© witnesses that Curry produced.

Dr. Armour predicted

the precis© continuation if a plan was adopted similar to the
one tha court adopted, he predicted the precise ratios to
which the student assignment would drop.
same thing.

Coleman says the

Every district has had the same experience.

Leon Bessinger talks about cognitive dissidence in which an
idea devoutly held is not abandoned even when evidence that
it fails is produced.

H© uses an example, the Court will

recall, Adventists who predicted the end of th® world on a
certain day, and th© ’world didn8t ©nd on that day and th©
people became more fervently convinced than before that their

22

theory was right and the world would come to an end —■
QUESTION:

That, it had end’Sd on that day?

MR. BLUMEMTHAL;
picked another day.

No, that it would end.

They said more buying will get us there.

Just because the bussing that x«/e'v© don© to data hasp.81 worked,
obviously we need more.
QUESTION:

Obviously we need to go to

I'm trying to get at your position, Mr.

Blumenthal, ard perhaps 1 should be mors familiar with it,
I would b® if I had read your brief raor© recently, but is it
your position that the district court was in error in order­
ing any busing whatsoever?
MR. BLUMENTHAL:

It is our position that the

district court was not in error in light of the Fifth
Circuit's decision.

It's our position that the Fifth Cir­

cuit continually ordering fch© district court to continue to
bus, in spite of whatever the court finds, that's fch© error.
It is our position, Curry's position, that if the
district court were instructed to use x^hafcsver tools to dasegregate it chose to us©, but it did not have to us© forced
transportation if it felt like it was not productive —
remember, fch© 3istrict court —
QUESTION:

Now — go ahead and finish your sen­

tence.
MR. BLUMENTHAL:

Than I think Curry would be, if

you could say you don't have to bus, Curry would fee pleased

23
with th© result.

That's the position we urge that the

Constitution permits.
QUESTIO??:

That it is permissible but not manda­

tory; is that it?
MR. BLUMENTHAL:

Permissible only to remedy some

discriminatory purpose, but not mandatory, and you don't have
to remove one-rac© schools unless those one-race schools were
found to have been caused by tha DISD.
QUESTION:

¥©s.

MR. BLUMENTHALs

Mow, ramesinbar, tha district court

found that in 1971, I bussed 1,000 children to the high schools
of which 50 wcra still hare in 1976, five years later.

The

courts concluded frcns that, the district court, that it does
not work, but no one is going to parmit that district court's
conclusion to stand up.
And what about those thousand students?
they count in relieving.

Why don't

They're gone now, but under Pasadena

they've bsen assigned to 'those school districts? why don't
they count as people, although not present, who have inte­
grated a ©ns-rac© black school?

They were assigned to tha

school by th© district and through no act of the district &e
found by th© district court, they're gone.
Staring all of this in th®. face, too, is to what
©sad?
into

For whose purpose ar© w© changing th® school districts
minority isolated school districts?

QUESTION:

You ar© saying that busang is permis­

sible, but you must also b© saying that there are plenty of
circumstances in which it is forbidden to be used?

You say

it certainly isn't permissible as ordered by the court of
appeals.
MR. BLUMENTHAL:

It certainly is not, and I would

say that -QUESTIONs

But you don't think as a constitutional

matter it ought to be banned?
MR. BLUMENTHALs

No, you don't need to ban it if

you tell the district court that if you don't think this is
going to work —QUESTION:

And therefore you must concade, then,

that in some circumstances it may h© ordered.
MR. BLUMENTHAL:

In sore© circumstances, but only

if it hae some prospect of working, Mr, Justice Whit©.
QUESTION:

All right.

tli© court of appeals?

Now, you just disagree with

Do you think the court of appeals —

MR. BLUMENTHAL:
/'■

QUESTION:

Yes, I —

You don't think the court of appeals

says, well, Mr. Blumenthal,' we understand your rule, but
we're going to order this bussing even though we think it
has absolutely no chano© to work whatsoever?
MR. BLUMENTHAL:
in Lee v, Maeon County --

In fact they said that very thing

25
QUESTION :

But did they say it in this eas©?

MR. BLUMENTHAL:

No, sir, but they did say that we

think the Swann mandates bussing, even though we know it will
not desegregate.
QUESTION:
indication

Perhaps you could just give me a little

of where you think the court of appeals came the

closest to saying, we're ordering this bussing or this re­
view svoii though wa have no hope that it will work at all?
MR. BLUMENTHM:
QUESTION:

Where does it say it in this case?

MR. BLUMENTHALs
QUESTION:

In Lae v. Macon County —

Beg pardon?

Wher© does it say it in this case?

MR. BLUMENTHM.s

In this case they didn't say it.

They just kept sending it back, saying get rid of one-raea
schools, aa if th@r® was some power that the district court
had.
QUESTION:

And where is, then — what's the sit©

for the Lea?
MR. BLUMENTHM:

The L©s v. Macon County, it's in

our
QUESTION:

It's in your brief?

MR. BLUMENTHAL:

It's in our brief? yes, sir.

It’s 465 Fed. 2d 369 at 3?0.
QUESTION:

To pursu® Mr. Justice Stewart's question,

the relief you really ask is that fch® complaint b© dismissed,

26
isn't it?
MR. BLUMENTHAL:

On the basis of this record with

no discrimination to be remedied, yes, sir, because we
agreed on a majority-minority school district,

agreed

on it, the community is supporting it —- look at the high
schools which are today neighborhood high schools with
majority to minoritv; set out in our brief is a racial break­
down of those high schools.

Look in the pink brief.

Look

at those racis 1 high schools and tell me if that's not a
unitary school system.

Tell me what's wrong with those.

It

was very close, by the way, to the racial makeup of the
school district before the courts began to ship children
around, but it's now very far out of whack as to the racial
makeup of the district because 95,000 Angles is now 42,000
Anglos and sinking at about 7 or 8 percent of that popula­
tion a year.

And you can't integrate if you don't have

children.
If this was an isolated, if Dallas was the only
city in the Nation that this was true of, then perhaps you
could talk abcut Dallas.

But Dallas has been a model for a

system in which the community has gone together to work or
to achieve a desegregation plan and it didn't work there,
and it hasn't worked anywhere.
QUESTION:

Now, your reference to what, at least

I thought you suggested was a holding concerning bussing

27
in Swann, the opinion states, "Wo rigid guidelines as to
student transportation can he given for application to the
infinite variety of problems presented in thousands of
situations."

Thus transportation has been a part of public

education for years.
It goes on to say that this is merely one of the
permissible tools, not a mandated tool in every case, by any
means„
MR. BLUMENTHAL:

But the 5th Circuit has not ap­

plied it in that way, and the eloquence of turning those
busses around that were used to segregate to use to de­
segregate is so appealing, and yet the fact of the matter is
that it doesn't work.

But nonetheless, the circuit court

keeps requiring the district court to achieve it.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Donohoe.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. DONOHOE, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS BRINEGAR ET AL.
MR. DONOHOE:

Yes.

Mr. Chief Justice, Members of

the Court, let ms try to answer the question you posed to
Mr. Whitham, Mr. Chief Justice:
I represent a group of parents and citizens who
reside in an area found by the district court to be
naturally integrated, in terms of school population.
reason we are here before —

And the

28
QUESTION;

Where is that area on the map?

MR. DONOHOE;

It would be in the eastern, near

eastern portion of the school district, Justice Stewart.
QUESTION;

Here?

MR. DONOHOE;

Yes, that's correct.

The reason that we're here complaining of the
court of appeals' opinion might be best stated by just read"
ing the applicable portion of the opinion.
The court of appeals says;

”We cannot properly

review any student assignment plan that leaves many schools
in a system one race without specific findings by the
district court as to the feasibility of these techniques.
There are no adequate time and distance studies in the
record in this case.

Consequently we have no means of

determining whether the natural boundaries and traffic
considerations preclude either paring and clustering of
schools or the use of transportation to eliminate the large
number of one-rac© schools still existing.”
Now, Mr. Whitham stated that this is a remedv case.
I think you can go a little further than that.

This case

really only involves questions of student assignment.

There

are no issues her© regarding site selection, faculty de­
segregation, school administration, single-member school
districts, or any of these kinds of issues.

As a matter of

fact, there is a specific finding by the district judge that

29

the school board was in good faith subsequent to 1371, at­
tempting to meet the Swann requirements following the Brown
decision.
Now, our concern is that in a situation where, at
March 1 of this year, there were only about 40,000 Anglo
students, slightly over 40,000 Anglo students left in the
school district, of which 38,000 under the plan, if you turn
to the respondent plaintiff's brief, were already in
statistically or numerically integrated schools, that there
simply weren't enough school students, Anglo students, left
to transport.

As a matter of fact, in the government's

brief they acknowledge that at March 1, only 8 percent of the
schools of the Anglo students in the Dallas Independent
School District were going to predominantly Anglo schools.
Now, we would like to point out to this court that
there aren't very many Anglo students left in the district.
The few that are left are, a good percentage of th© few that
are left, are in naturally integrated neighborhoods.

In

.view of the court of appeals * opinion, and it was aware of
these facts, or at least th© record was before it, we are
concerned that th© effect of their decision to order time and
distance studies is to affectively order transportation of
students.
We csrtainly agree, Justice Stewart, that the
Swann decision does not require bussing, but what wa are

30

concerned with, as 1 think Mr. Justice Rehnquist was con­
cerned with in the Valdosta case, where this Court rejected
certiorari, petition for certiorari, but over his objection,
that the court of appeals is too concerned with one-race
schools, and that you could have the absurd result in this
case of in fact, an order of having — pardon me.

You could

have the absurd result of having transportation of Anglo
students or black students from naturally desegregated areas
where they corsentually elected to live together, to other
parts of the school district in order to eliminate one-race
schools»
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Wallace.

ORAL ARGUMENT OP LAWRENCE G. WALLACE, ESQ.,
AS AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING RESPONDENTS
MR. WALLACE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court, the United States submits that the court of
appeals was correct in tills case in remanding th© case for
further consideration of th© remedy and for more specific
factual findings, and in light of the limited nature of the
court of appeals5 holding some of the questions being argued
before the Court today seem to us prematurely presented be­
cause they involve matters that the court of appeals has not
yet passed on, and believes it needs to have a fuller record
before it can pass on them.

31
The question before the court of appeals was
whether the remedy adopted by the district court was adequate
to disestablish the continuing effect of a pervasive system
of dual schools that had been maintained in the Dallas Inde­
pendent School District for generations, pursuant to Texas
Constitution and statutes.
QUESTION:

Now, the question before the court of

appeals and the question before us is not a constitutional
question at all, is it?
MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

It can be debated whether —

What is there to debate about?

MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION;

It’s a remedial question.

Correct.

MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

It's a question of equity.

Whether the —

There's an admission that there was a

constitutional violation until 1954.
MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

That's correct.

This is just a matter of permissible

decree, isn't it?
MR. WALLACE:

That is correct, Mr. Justice.

question is entirely remedial.

Th®

The question of liability is

not being debated, and both courts below proceeded on the
premise conceded by the school board in this case that the
dual system hai not yet been disestablished, we're at that
elementary remedial stag®, familiar in other Southern cases.

32
of disestablishing for the first time the continuing effects
of the dual system.
QUEST ION z

Or North era.

MR.WALLACE:

It is familiar in some of those as

well, Mr. Justice Whit®.
Now, the conspicuous problem with the remedial
order that reached fcha court of appeals in this case was the
large number cf one-race schools that would remain under that
order and the large percentage of black students, the ones
found to have b@©n discriminated against, who would still
attend than, according to the court of appeals' figures
approximately 66 of the 176 schools would remain one-race
schools.
There ar© other ways of looking s.t the figures in
this record, tut they all com© out showing that substantially
mor© than a quarter of th®. schools would remain one race, and
perhaps even more significantly," 59 percent of th© black
school children would b© attending one-race schools, schools
in which mor® than 90 percent of tha students would b©
minority students.

This is indicated on page 22 of our

brief —
QUESTION:

When you say minority students, does

that include Maxioan-Amerlean?
MR. WALLACE:

In some instances it does, Mr.

Justice, although it’s principally isolation of black children

33
that's involved.

The best picture of that is presented in

the table on page 53 of the brief for Respondent Tasby, the
table compiled from the April 1979 report of the school board
to the district court, and you will note that the percentage
of black students, which is the fifth column of figures, less
than 1 percent whites in the school, 38.3 percent of the
black students ©r© in such schools, whereas only 2.04"per­
cent of th© Hispanic students are in such schools, and 1 to
9 percent, 20.63 of th© black students are in such schools,
where for the Hispanics it's a little less than 10 pereant.
QUESTION:

Don’t you suppose, Mr. Wallace, that

very similar statistics could b© — wouldn’t b© true of
Detroit or Pittsburgh or Cincinnati or Mew York City, or
many, many cities whose states had never had, either by
statute or corstitutional, ds jure segregation?
MR. WALLACE:

There could b® a very similar pattern

of school assignments, yas, Mr. Justice, but the legal
question presented might bo quit© different.

Here under this

court's decision, reaffirmed last terra, there is a burden on
the school board to show that th© extent, to which there re­
main substantially disproportionate or one-race schools in
the system was not the result of the pattern of illegal con­
duct that had bean mandated bv law over a period of genera­
tions, and that presumptively affected

the development of

th© entire commun ty, th© siting, the capacities of schools,

>

34

the growth of residential areas, depending on access to
schools, and the entire development of community that was
built around a legal system that mandated racial separation
in the schools.

This is the familiar law undor all of fchs

governing decisions in this Court.
QUESTION;

Well, wasn't it the finding in the

Detroit case that — undisputed finding — that the propor­
tion of students in the so-called one-race schools was greater
than you have hare, and that th© number of one-race schools,
just counting th® schools, was greater than you have hare?
MR. WM.LACE:

This can occur due to residential

patterns in cities where there may have been soma d© jure
acts that added to segregation in those cases under this
Court's decision require an inquiry into the incremental ef­
fect of d© jure acts on th© racial separation that otherwise
would have existed as a guide to th® remedy that should be
used.
In eases of this sort, that is net th© approach
that th© court has taken.

But rather the court has stated,

as we quote ©n page 42 of our belief in this long case that
there is th© burden on th© school authorities to satisfy the
court that the racial composition of those schools that re­
main predominantly of one race after a pattern of generations
of mandated racial separation, that th© remainder of those
schools &rm net th® result of present ore past discriminatory

35
action.

That was fcha question that was before the court of

appeals, whether there wore findings made by the district
court that would satisfy that the school district had satis­
fied that burden here,
The reason why this problem was as conspicuous as
it was to th© court of appeals is not merely because of the
more generalised formulations in this court's opinions that
the adequacy of a remedy to disestablish a dual system of
this kind is to be measured by its effectiveness, but because
more specifically of the fact that the last time the court of
appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld as constitutionally ade­
quate a desegregation plan —
QUESTION: I thought wa agreed we weren't talking
about whether or not this is constitutionally adequate.
MR. « ALL-ACE?

Well, upheld as adequate for a

constitutional violation —
QUESTION:

It’s not your contention, is it, or is

it, that the Constitution of the United States requires an
integrated school system?
MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION;

That is not our contention.

It simply requires a desegregated school

' system?

MR. WALLACE;
system.

It requires a desegregated school

Th© question here is on© of remedy.

Th© reason the

problem was so conspicuous is because the last time this court

36
of appeals upheld as adequate a remedy in such a system that
preserved a comparable number and percentage of one-race
schools, this Court unanimously reversed it.

This was some

years ago; it was in Davis v. the Mobil© School Commissioners,
and the situation x*as very comparable to the one involved here,
the figures referred to in this Court9s opinion showed that
64 percent of th® black elementary school children and a
majority of tie junior high school and senior high school
students would remain in one-race schools, an aggregate
figure that obviously would com® out very close to the 59
percent that’s involved her®.
And the Court unanimously held that th© tools
specified in the Swann case should be considered before this
kind of racial isolation should be upheld, and when th©
district court looked more specifically — whan the court
of appeals locked more specifically here at th© reasons why
the remedy adopted left so many children in one-race schools ,
they found that the problems had snot shown that th© burden
of th© school board had been met here.
For on® thing, th® whole East Oak Cliff area in­
volving 27,500 students almost all of whom were black, more
than 40 percent of the black students in the district, was
simply excluded from the remedy adopted by the district
court —
QUESTIONS

Mr. Wallace, does EQC stand for East

37
Oak Cliff?
MR. WALLACE?
QUESTION'S

That is my understanding.

And is this East Oak Cliff?

MR. WALLACES

That is the area.

That is the area

that was ©secluded, ©van though plans had been submitted to
the district court that showed it ws feasible to includ©
portions of this area and the area was in a comparable geo­
graphic configuration to the area east of the North-South
Interstate Highway in Mobil® that had been erroneously
treated saparately by the court of appeals in that case.

In-

V

\ deed, the western boundary of East Oak Cliff is the NorthSouth Interstate Highway.
Then® is a very close parallel there.
QUESTION;

Mr. Wallace, have you thought about the

question I put to your friend?

Is there anything before the

Court now which couldn't be resolved, even though at a later
date, after the district court acts on the remand?
MR. WALLACE;

Nothing, Mr. Chi®£ Justice.

The im­

plication of your question sessas to me that the Court may
wish to consider dismissing th© writ as improvidently granted
at this interlocutory stag© ©f the case, and in light of this
Court's intervening decisions in Dayton and Columbus sine®
ill© grant of certiorari in this case, that is a course that
should fo® considered to enable the proceedings on remand to
go forward mors quickly.

38
QUESTIONS

Mr. Wallace., may I ask you a question

in that connection?
Thin school system has been in litigation since
1955.

As a representative of the United States Government,

do you think there is any merit in the suggestion that it
would b© wall to bring that litigation to an and here in
this court, to the extent w© possibly can?
Can yeu imagine yourself trying to run a school
system that

been in litigation for a quarter of a cen­

tury?
MR. WALLACE?
QUESTION!

1 think it is very regrettable —

Does the United States Government —

MR. WALLACE:

— that it has taken as long as it

has, and —
QUESTION:

You want it -to go back for another few©

to five years of litigation?
MR. WALLACE:

Mo, I just suggested on© course that

could ha adopted to enable the proceedings on remand to take
place sooner than they otherwise might.

They would have

been under way now had review not bean granted of this in­
terlocutory stag©.

Wa’rej all for proceeding quickly with

the case, but it seems to me that the court of appeals has
decided rather little, and unless this Court wants to under­
take the task of a court of appeals or the task of a district
court in the ease, there is relatively little that it can do

39

to conclude the case? it seems to roe. in light of its re­
view of the governing principles as recently as last July.
QUESTION2

We could affirm the district court,

could w® not?
MR. WhLLACEs

Well that, it seems to me, would re­

quire reconsideration of matters that the Court reconsidered
and came up the other way on last July.
QUESTION?

You sea no difference between this case

and Dayton and Columbus?
MR. WALLACE:

Well, in many ways this case seems to

me to follow a fortiori from Dayton and Columbus, Mr.
Justice, because it's so much closer to the Mobil© case, as
I have just been indicating, and because the other point
that I was about to mak©, more than half of the grades war©
completely left out of the desegregation plan by the district
court.

It limited the plan to grades 4 through 8? left out

more than half the grades, to begin with.

It would be extra­

ordinary for the Court to affirm that.
QUESTION:

Well, doesn't the district court have

soma discretion when it comas to very young children in say­
ing there shall b© less bussing with respect to them than
with respect to older children?
MR. WALLACE:

Some discretion based on adequate

factual inquiry and findings.
QUESTION:

Didn't Swann —

40

MR. WALLACE:

— the part about grades 9 through

12, Mr. Justice.
QUESTION:

Didn’t Swann say precisely that, Mr.

Wallace?
MR. WALLACE:

Swann did say that, and I answered

consistently with that answer.
QUESTION:

With young children, there was to be &

different approach vd.th younger children?
MR. WALLACE:

Young children are being bussed, in­

cluding some children in grades 1, 2, and 3 in the Dallas
system today.

There are 5,000 children being bussed, not for

purposes of desegregation, but the district court refused, to
consider any bussing for purposes of desegregation of children
of those grad© levels.
QUESTION:
you:

Mr. Wallace, may I put this question to

Th® district court found thatit was his duty to adopt

a plan that would b© effective, effective to accomplish as
much integration as possible , given the problems in that
community.

Is it the position of th© United States that the

affectiveness of a desegregation plan in terms of accomplish­
ing th© ultimat® objective, and that is to hav© diversity of
students in public school systems of our country, is it th®
government's position that effectiveness is immaterial?
MR. WALLACE*
QUESTION:

Net at all, Mr. Justice.

Th© district court found that this was a

41
most effective plan.

That, was a finding based on years of

experience with an intractable problem.

What, do you do?

Do

we second-guess the district court at this level, after that
record?
MR. WALLACE;

I cannot accept the premise, Mr.

Justice, that this was an intractable problem as the record
presented it before th© district court -—
QUESTION:

Would you' b© content with wholly one-

race schools cr two-race schools in the City of Dallas?
MR. WALLACE: There were a number of plans before
the district court that showed that a ranch higher degree of
desegregation could be achieved and no specific findings were
made about why those plans were impracticable within the
meaning of this court5s governing considerations.

So I

don't believe it accurate to assume that there was an in­
tractable prohlsa her© that necessitated limiting the remedy
to grade® 4 through 8 and excluding more than 40 percent of
th® black children from any consideration of remedy.
QUESTIONs

May I ask on© question before you sit

down?
Th© district court made a reference —- primarily
bean talking about these Oak Cliff areas, as I understand,
and I think the district court made a reference to th© fact
that I think all but on© of the plans contemplated leaving
th© East Oak Cliff area predominantly black, but one of the

42
plaintiff's plans was quite different, and as I read th©
court of appeals opinion, they were primarily critical of
th© district court for the lack of detail in its findings.
Do you understand that consistently with th© court of ap­
peals* opinion, if th© district court r©examined the record
in detail and mad® more elaborate findings, it would at
least b© ©pan to it as one alternative to re-enter its ori­
ginal decree supported by more detailed findings?
MR. WALLACE:
preclude this.

Th© court of appeals said nothing to

We might argu© that it would be legal error,

but that would depend on th® findings.
QUESTION:

I understand.

MR. WALLACES

But it seems to me the nature of the

court of appeals' holding is an extremely limited on® here.
They basically said they didn8t have a full enough record or
full enough findings to be able to decide anything.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Wallace.

Mr. Cunningham.
OFAL ARGUMENT OF E. BRICE CUNNINGHAM, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS NAACP ET AL.
MR. CUNNINGHAM:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the court, on behalf of th© NAACP, it is the NAACP"s posi­
tion that this is a dual segregated d© jure system that has
naver been desegregated, and that it is not desegregated by
th® student assignment plan that was adopted by th® district

43

judge in this case in accordance with the instructions that
were given to the district judge in 1975, directing that
district judge specifically to this Court's holding in Sx^ann
and directing that district judge to use the tools and tech­
niques set out in Swann.
The reason the NAACP submit that this student
assignment plan does not desegregate the Dallas Independent
School District is, one, the exclusion of high school students
9 dash 12 froxr inclusion in this student assignment plan;
two, the number of one-race schools that were left one-race
without any justification, the NAACP submits; three, the ex­
clusion of kindergarten dash third grade students from inclu­
sion in the plan; and four, the creation of an all-black
district which was totally written off by the district judge
below, locking in more than 26,000 students with the only
method of getting out of that all-black district using a
transfer form, that is that they themselves either opt out
by magnet concept, .attending a magnet school, or majority to
minority trap.sf era.
We submit, th® NAACP submits that th© court of
appeals below was correct in remanding this case back to the
district judge.for additional findings, and the NAACP would
submit that this was a very moderate order, and when you look
at th© order entered by the 5th Circuit in this case, and
specifically moderate when you compar© it with the order that

44
was rendered by this same court in this same case in July of
1975, when it specifically directed the district judge to
utilize the tools that this court sat out: in Swann, and that
this school district has naver fully utilized, and further
went on to tell that district judge to do it by the second
semester or second term of the 1975-7S school year, which was
not done»
Addressing myself to the four glaring errors that
the NAACP submits that clearly indicates that this student
assignment plan does not comply with this Court's ruling in
Swann is the exclusion of the high school students 9 dash
12, which in effect is a neighborhood concept for these high
school students, and with the indication that the only method
of desegregating these high school students was a magnet
concept.

They have six magnet high schools plus skyline.

The magnet concept has been a failure in the Dallas Independent School District.
Less than 2,500 students are enrolled in the magnet
concepts r5.ght now.
proximately 3,500.

At the time, in 1976, there were ap­
The magnet concept has failed.

The ether two referred to by the district judge
for the desegrsgation of tha high school students nine dash
12, the majority to minority transfer, is a failure in the
Dallas Independent School District.

1,403 students out of a

total population of better than 131,000 have taken advantage

45
of fcha majority to minority transfer program,, and 96 percent:
of those were black.

Therefore, with respect to the high

school students 9 dash 12, the NAACP submits that there is
no effective desegregation in accordance with this Court’s
holding in Swann,
The second point, the number of one-race schools
left in this district, approximately 76 out of a total of
177, at the time that this order was entered 48 of those
schools were Negro schools? 25 of those schools were Anglo
schools.

At the present time there are 76 one-race schools

still existing in the Dallas Independent School District.
62 of those schools are black schools, and to that you add 14
combined, and you have, you come up with 76 one-race schools
that tha court of appeals below said that there was no
factual finding, and the court of appeals below did not simply
rely upon the fact that there was a large number of one-race
schools.

It want on to say in its opinion, and address it­

self to tha high school question.
The third point that I would like to make —
QUESTION:

Are a majority of the one-race schools,

at least of tha all-Negro schools, in this East Oak Cliff?
MR. CUNNINGHAM:

There are 28 one-race schools in

sub-districts that were created by the district judge.
QUESTION:

And what was the total of all-Negro

schools?
MR. CUNNINGHAM:
QUESTION:

28 in East Oak Cliff sub-district.

Th© total?

MR. CUNNINGHAM:

There

are a total of 62 one-

race schools.
QUESTION:

But does that mean all-Negro schools?

Not necessarily, does it?
MR. CUNNINGHAM:

There are 52 one-race schools,

black schools; 9 one-race Anglo schools; and 1 MexicanAmerican one-race school existing in the Dallas Independent
School District.
QUESTION:

And of those, 28 of the all-Negro

schools are in East Oak Cliff, right?
MR. CUNNINGHAM:

In the East Oak Cliff area.

The

remaining all-Negro schools are outside of the East Oak Cliff
area.
QUES TION:

Uh-huh.

MR. CUNNINGHAM:

The student assignment plan also

in excluding kindergarten dash 3, the NAACP submits that
there were no factual findings to justify the exclusion of
these students from inclusion in the plan.

There were no

47
indications by the district judge.
that were submitted.

There were other plans

The NAACP submitted a plan that would

have desegregated Dallas.

Plaintiff’s Plan A would have

desegregated Ealias more than the plan that was adopted by
the district judge below.
The court even appointed a court-appointed expert,
who submitted a plan, and that plan was not even adopted by
the district judge below.

And that plan of the court-

appointed expert used part of the East Oak Cliff in attempt­
ing to desegregate Dallas, make Dallas come in compliance
with Swann.
And then fch© last point:

The creation of this all­

black district.
QUESTION:

Mr. Cunningham, is it your position that

the district court was bound to adGpt the plan which in your
words most desegregated the school district of th© ones sub­
mitted to it?
MR. CUNNINGHAM;

I think that the district judge

under this Court's holding had a duty to adopt the plan that
desegregated Dallas and utilizing the tools in Swann.
QUESTION:

Well, he had what, was it five or six

plans submitted to him?
MR. CUNNINGHAM:
QUESTION:

He had six plans submitted to him.

Is it your position that he was obli­

gated to adopt, of those six, the on© which most desegregated

40

the school district?
MR. CUNNINGHAMs

He was obligated to so adopt the

plan that most desegregated Dallas.

It is the NAACP's

position that he did not adopt the plan that most desegre....

.

gated Dallas* but that the plan that was adopted continued
the dual school system that had existed from the time of
Brown 1 and Brown 2 up to the present time, and as it exists
right now.
QUESTION:

Mr. Cunningham, back in 1972 in the

case to which your colleague on the other side referred, Lee
against Macon County ~ are you familiar with that case?
MR. CUNNINGHAM:

I have read that case, Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

As I read it, -the court of appeals seemed

to say that even if tills desegregation order would result in
completa resegregation — I think there were six schools
there black, or some number of schools that were black and a
much fewer number of schools that were white, but those were
all the schools there were, and the desegregation order was
supposed to result in integrating those schools, and the
court said even if complete resegregation would result, we
nevertheless mast order this plan into effect, order the HEW
plan into effeat.

Do you support that holding?

MR. CUNNINGHAM:
QUESTION:

We support —

Do you understand it that way?

48-A
MR. CUNNINGHAM:

If I understand, Mr. Justice

White, we are dealing with Dallas, and —
QUESTION;

Well, my next question is going to be,

to you, of course, that your colleague suggests that much
of the court of appeals' opinion and decision in this case
rests on an understanding of the law such as that, namely
that except for their feeling that the resegregated conse­
quences of an integration plan is irrelevant.
have com® to the conclusions they did.

They wouldn't

Now, is that — to

what extent is the approach to desegregation cases such as
Lee, to xihat cactent does the present decision rest on such an
under s tanding\
MR. CUNNINGHAM;

The present decision rests upon —

I think the court of appeals belov/'s decision rests upon this
Court's holdings, in Brown 1, 2, Green, and particularly
Swann, because! on — this is the second time that the court
of appeals has directed this district judge to look at the
tools set out by this Court in Swann and to apply those tools
and techniques to the desegregation of the Dallas Independent
School District.
QUESTION; Do you think the district court on a
remand such has been suggested in this case is -- is he for­
bidden or is he permitted to take into account, in formulating
his plan, whether or not a particular plan that has been
suggested will result in further resegregation ultimately, ex

49
white flight or black flight?

Is he forbidden to take that

into account?
MR. CUNNINGHAM:

I think that he may take that

into account, but I think that the NAACP9s position is that
still taking that into consideration, his first considera­
tion, the first consideration are the minority children that
are being desegregated, and seeing that their constitutional
rights are protected and guaranteed, and that is what the
NAACP says was not done.
QUESTION?

So the NAACP was just as certain as it

could be from experience that bussing, this cross-bussing
would result in these black children next year or the year
afterwards nevertheless going to an all-black school because
there wouldn't b© any whites or any people of any other color
to go t© school with, even if the NAACP was convinced by
experience that that would occur, would you still be arguing
What you are now, that you must take that first step?
MR. CUNNINGHAMS

The NAACP would still he arguing

th® same position that it's arguing now and that it argued
in the court of appeals below and in the district court.
QUESTIONS

May 1 put it a little bit differently?

Do you think that the position you are taking would acceler­
ato a return to separate but equal schools, or what w© had
all tried to get away from?
MR. CUNNINGHAM:

Mr. Justice Powell, I think that

is speculation.
QUESTION;

But don’t you think that the record

suggests that it might or probably will?
MR. CUNNINGHAM;

That is the district judge's

finding based upon speculation,, but we have here a plan in
effect which shows that the student enrollment is constant
that all that there has been, and no white — well, white
flight, as, this Court said in Swann, should not be, or short
not be a reason for denying minority children their right
guaranteed to them by the Constitution.
QUESTION;

Their right is to go to schools which

are in a desegregated system, and that's th© extent of their
right, isn't it?
MR. CUNNINGHAM;

That is the extent of their right,

Mr. Justice Stewart, sir.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD B. CLOUTMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS TASBY ET AL.
MR. CLCUTMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it pleas© the

Court, on behalf of the respondent Tasby and others, original
plaintiffs in the trial below in the trial since 1970, we
Support the conclusion reached by th© United States Court of
Appeals, 5th Circuit, which is a very simple and I believe
direct order, simply requesting of th® trial court to make
further; findings regarding a new student assignment plan as t

51

any one-race schools he deemed to be necessary, and neces­
sary for purposes of all the factors articulated in Swann.
QUESTION:

May he take into account the possi­

bilities of whitesmoving out of the public school system, or
may he not, in your view?
MR. CLOUTMAN:

Mr. Justice White, I think the

court may consider any practicality necessary to make the
plan realistically work —
QUESTION:

So is your answer ves or no?

MR. CLOUTMAM:

Mv answer is not necessarily yes,

based upon the record in the Dallas case.

The Dallas case

explored that very thoroughly, and there is no conclusive
evidence that it will cause that.

We're talking about Dallas

and the Dallas school system, so for Dallas I would sav no,
the court would not be reasonable in including such a factor
in limiting racial segregation of the schools.
QUESTION:

The record doesn't show why the per­

centage of whites in the Dallas school system is so much
lower than it was, or does it?
MR. CLOUTMAN:

The record shows many expert opin­

ions as to what might have happened, what might happen in the
future, and those are divergent —
QUESTION:

I didn’t ask about the opinions.

Isn’t

it the fact that there is a much lesser percentage of whites
in this

52
MR. CLOUTMAN:

You’re asking if the Anglo enroll­

ment has decreased; it has.

It began decreasing, Mr. Justice

White, prior to litigation in this case, however, not as a
direct result of this, and probably as a result of many
things.
QUESTION:

Yes.

And I take it there is still a

naturally integrated area in town -MR. CLOUTMAN:
QUESTION:

There may be several.

— that hasn’t been particularly upset

by anything.
MR. CLOUTMAN:

There may he several of those

pockets of neighborhood xesidences, that’s true.
QUESTION:

Well, how about the schools in those

areas?
MR. CLOUTMAN:

In each plan, by the way, proposed

by the planners, we preserved to the extent that we could
those areas intact.
QUESTION:

You mean you don’t have to use either

those blacks or those whites to integrate some other schools?
MR. CLOUTMAN:

We did not, in both Plans A and B.

As a matter of'fact, fha particular reasons that we indicate
to ths court it should support the 5th Circuit’s decision
are quite simple.

Ths unexplained exclusion of high school

grades from any part of the plan without any justification
in the record we think all by itself requires a remand for

53

hearings and a new plan to include those very schools.
By way of example, the maps you have before you
demonstrate the absolute feasibility of desegregation in.
Grades 4 through 8 in a precisely identical manner that the
high schools may be integrated', throughout Dallas, and you
are using older students.

No rationale in the record or

in the court's findings exists for their exclusion.

For

that reason alone the 5th Circuit was correct.
The 5th Circuit also points out indirectly, and
there is no rationale given in th© court's findings, the
exclusion of F-3.

Now, while this court said in Swarm the

age of children may be considered, there is no explanation,
no rationale, and no evidence in the trial record regarding
the exclusion of those children.

For that reason again,

and the fact that the exclusion of high schools and K--3
centers from a student assignment plan results in basically
close to 100 one-race administrative units.
Those children in K--3 centers do not attend class
with students of another race in over 100 cases.

They may

have black or white children in the building, but they are
not in their classrooms, and they are for all purposes segre­
gated .
QUESTION:

K-3 being the kindergarten through

third grade?
MR. CLOUTMAN:

Yes.

54

By way of example again, the maps before you, and
we have demonstrated this in our brief, there is an elemen­
tary school maned Carr, and the students are all black and
are sent to a far north Dallas school to attend Grades 4
through S.

At the conclusion of this, when they are met by

white students, they are transferred further north and further
east to the Ewell Walker Middle School, Grades 7 and 8.

Nov;,

these students are traveling 20 miles or better»
Now, after having attended segregated K through 3
and integrated 4 through 8, they"re sent back home to an allblack high school to complete their education.

There is no

rationale in the plan for that, and the 5th Circuit says
why do you do this?

We want some reasons for this court to

support that result»
QUESTION:

May I ask this question:

The district

court's opinion said this, and 1 want to understand what your
view is about it»

It says, "Due to the geographic layout of

the district and. the factors of time and distance," which
the court, of appeals seemed to think the district court had
not considered: at all, "this East Oak Cliff area, was left
predominantly black in ©vary plan proposed to the court with
the exception of Plaintiff's Plan A,"

I think that's the

NAACP plan, wasn't it?
MR» CLOUTMAN:
QUESTION:

No, Your Honor, it was ours.

What is yours?

55
MR. CLOUTMAN:

Plaintiff's Plans A and B.

We had

tWQ.
QUESTION:

Two.

MR. CLOUTMAN:

Who sponsored Plan A?
The plaintiffs, Your Honor.

Plaintiff Tasby and others.
QUESTION:

Did the NAACP endorse that plan?

MR. CLOUTMAN:
QUESTION:

They had a third plan, Your Honor.

Right.

Anyway, that plan which proposed

to establish an exact racial balance in every school and
which would have necessitated the transportation of either
49 or 69,000 pupils, how many would the plan you proposed
require to be bussed?
MR. CLOUTMAN:
Honor.

Our evidence was 35,000, Your

The court makes inconsistent findings, as you have

noted, as to how many students it will actually require for
transportation.

Th© Plaintiff's Plan A, I will submit, and

Plaintiff's Plan B and the court's own expert's plan all de­
segregated East Oak Cliff more than the plan presently in
existence.

There were three better plans testified to by

three different groups of parsons in the record, and their
rejection is not explained, either.
Now, the court's reference to time and distance,
there are no tiina and distance studies supportive of any
rejection of Plaintiff's A, Plaintiff’s B, Dr. Hall's plan,
or in support of the plan adopted by the court.

Th® record

56
is just absent, except for the little time and distance
studies that we did perform on Plaintiff's A, and what coun­
sels refer to, we did measure the longest bus run of 22
miles in Plaintiff’s A.

That was to give the court an idea

of what the longest was going to look like.
QUESTION %

What was the court talking about when it

said, "The court is of the opinion that given the practical­
ities of time and distance and the fact that the DIED is
minority Anglo, this subdistrict" —• I suppose that’s East
Oak Cliff?
MR. CLOUTMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

— "must necessarily remain predominantly

minority" —
MR. CLOUTMAN:

The court is making a conclusion in

its opinion with no record evidence to support it.
what the 5th Circuit notad.

That is

We have no record evidence and

the court makes no detail®! findings as to why it concludes
time and distance.
Th® court couldn’t find the trial judge clearly
erroneous because there were no facts for them to review.
QUESTION:

Does this judge live in Dallas?

MR. CLOUTMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

He was unfamiliar with the distances?

MR. CLOUTMAN:

He had not measured them himself, I

don’t believe, and there was certainly no evidence he did.

57
QUESTION:

These maps show the distances, don’t

they?
MR. CLOUTMAN:

No, Your Honor, not accurate»

You

may measure, I suppose, with a ruler front to back, but it
does not tell you street miles,
QUESTION:

Of Gourse, but do you really think

that -MR, CLOUTMAN:

I think that only an expert can

tell us with c,ny certainty not only what distances are, but
what times are going to be like.
QUESTION:

You’d have to lay out specific bus

routes from school to school.
MR. CLOUTMAN:
QUESTION:

That’s correct, and ---

And an expert presumably wouldn't mea­

sure it on a Sunday afternoon, would he?
MR. CLOUTMAN:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

How about the finding on page 34A of

the petition for writ of certiorari, the district court’s
opinion of, I think it's March 1976:

"Moreover, this court

must adopt the plan which promises to be effective in
eliminating th® vestigas of the dual system.

The court is

convinced that th® magnet school concept on the 9 to 12
grade level will be more effective than the assignment of
students to achieve a certain percentage of each race in each
high school.

Th® court tried this method of student

58
assignment in 1971 and it has not proved wholly successful."
MR. CLOUTMAM:

The court tried in 1971* Mr.

Justice Rehnquist, a high school assignment plan

which it

in whole abandoned, and in part because the court assigned*
for instance, 100 white students to a thousand-parson black
school and students in that case did not show up.
QUESTION;

But at least th© district court did

make a finding that the magnet school system would b© more
effective than the transportation and assigning students on
a racial basis to high schools.

Now, if he was wrong on th©

record, shouldn’t the court of appeals have reversed him,
rather than just saying we need more findings?
MR. CLOUTMAM;

Th© fact is, Mr. Justice Rehnquist,

there is no record to support his conclusions.

The court of

appeals was being, I submit, very gentle in their opinion.
There is no record to suggest the magnet schools would have
ever- worked.

There is nothing to indicate that, and there

is-everything to indicate in the past that volunteer trans­
fers have not worked in Dallas, and that’s all the magnet
schools are, is a system of voluntary transfers.

The

record now indicates they hav© not worked in all but one case.
On® desegregated high school has resulted out of that plan.
One.

And, on that and that alone, the court of appeals could

have, I submit, reversed, but it didn’t.

It vacated and

requested, the trial judge to hold further hearings on new

59

student assignment plan so that it could , the court of ap­
peals could review the rationale and the reasons supporting
the court's conclusion.
QUESTION:

Suppose the magnet high school had

worked in the sense that everybody showed up.

Would there

have been a lot of bussing involved in getting back and
forth?
MR. CLOUTMAN:

Absolutely.

Absolutely a lot of

bussing.
QUESTION :

Wall then —

MR. CLOUTMAN:
QUESTION:

Or a lot of cars.

So what was it, a voluntary magnet high

school?
MR, CLOUTMAN:

That's right, and I'm glad you asked

that.
QUESTION:

So why wouldn't the, if the voluntary

magnet high school would have involved a lot of bussing, it.
wouldn't have involved any more bussing if there had been
assignments to th® magnet high school?
MR. CLOUTMAN:

That's entirely correct, Mr. Justice

Whit®, and as a matter of fact, those bus routes, since many
of the magnets are district-wide, are as long as th© ones th©
court says it can't use that are too long.

Th© students come

from all over’ th© district,
QUESTION:

Do you think it did make a difference in

60

the casa of the magnet schools that the parents were making a
voluntary choice for their children, rather than a Federal
district judge?

And also you said, as I understood you, that

the magnet schools were identical to the situation of
majority to minority transfers.

Am I incorrect in thinking

that the magnet schools provide special types of education,
vocational, for example, so that children who elect to go
there might receive the types of education in subjects which
may be of special interest to them?
MR. CLOUTMANs

Mr. Justice Powell, you *re correct

and that is the — in the latter assumption that there are
special programs being offered to schools.

My analogy of the

majority to minority was the students were voluntarily opting
to go to schools.

That was not working.

It hasn't worked in

the magnet schools, either, and apparently the parents'
choice, as you suggested, may make a difference appears
wholly speculative, because it didn't make a difference in
majority to minority and has not made a difference in the
magnet schools, either.
QUESTIONs

How many magnet schools do you have in

operation?
MR. CLOUTMAN s

I believe there are 6 or 7 in

operation.
QUESTIONS

But additional ones are either under

construction ©r planned, aren't they?

61
MR» CLOUTMAN:
QUESTION:

That is ray understanding.

Is it a fact that the community down

there approved an $80 million school bond issue following
this court decree?
MR. CLOUTMAN:

We approved a bond issue following,

approved bond issues during litigation, as a matter of fact.
QUESTION s

Does the district court plan have the

support of the community?
MR» CLOUTMAN:
tive.

Some of the briefs so said.
Your Honor, that is wholly specula­

I have no way of knowing whether this plan has the

support of the community or not.

It does not have the sup­

port of the litigants in this Court.
QUESTION:

Obviously.

MR. CLOUTMAN:

Many of them, at least»

In conclusion, I would like to speak briefly to
the, I think the issue raised by several members of the Court
earlier.
W@ don't think there is any issue of constitutional
violation properly before this Court,

If there is, the

record is so completa the Court should take five minutes and
dispose of that question in the affirmative.

The violation

was rampant.
This district has resisted in 25 years8 litigation
anything close to a student assignment system that would
allow desegregation of any sort in Dallas»

When we started

62

litigation and found that 70-scnt©-odd schools ar@ all Anglo
and 49 are all minority, in 1970 after a stair-step plan, we
know we have vestiges of the dual system.
QUESTION:

Well now, how do you know that?

MR. CLOUTMAN:
QUESTION:

Because we —

You could find the same situation in

big urban areas which were never, never had a dual school
system.

How do you know that?
MR. CLOUTMAN:

I know for a fact that 37 schools

that wera one race black under the pr® stair-step plan con­
tinue to b® part of the 52 black schools today, and that is a
vestige, cleas1 and simple,
QUESTION:

Well, you don't know that any more than

I know that,
MR. CLOUTMAN:

I know they were black before that;

I know they're black now.
QUESTION:

You can find the same sort of statistics

in Pittsburgh or Cincinnati or Detroit or Chicago or New York
City which never had dual school systems de jure.

Then how

do you know that the existence of those statistics in Dallas
are the result of that d© jure system?
MR, CLOUTMAN:

Very simple, Mr, Justice Stewart,

The black students wer® required to go to those 37 schools by
law and by school district practice prior to 1965,

No ex­

cuses, no transfers, no receptions, and no integration.

And

63

in 1970 there are 49, including the original 37, still black
and one rase.

Now, I can tell this Court that in my judgment

that's a reasonable inference, when the schools have always
been black and were black by State law and black by school
board policy, which certainly is a de jure act, that whan you
find them in 1970 still black, they are a remnant or a ves­
tige of that system, unlawful, and must be remedied in this
cas e.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Very well.

Mr. Whitham.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WARREN WHITKAM, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF ESTES ET AL. — REBUTTAL
MR. WHITHAM:

Mr. Chief Justice, I knew my time was

up, but I understand Mr. Donohcs had yielded —
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;
MR. WHITHAM:

Three minutes.

Three minutes.

Let me reply briefly

to some things X have heard here.
First, the Plaintiff's Plans A and B and the NAACP
plan all propose magnet schools, so they were for them to
start with.
Second, the plaintiffs, in effect, have abandoned
their plans sni counsel has so admitted to me, Mr. Cloutman,
and never urged them in the 3th Circuit.
Oddly enough, following fch© entry of the district
court student assignment plan and its total remedy, Mr.

64

Cloutman, my brother, filed a motion for attorney’s fees
as the prevailing party under the Educational Amendments Act
of 1972, and received a substantial award of attorney's fees
from the district court on the theory that he was the pre­
vailing party, that is that the plaintiffs were, and he
represented to the court and the court so found, and you
will find this in our brief and in the appendices, that
virtually every precept and proposal that the plaintiffs had
made to the district court had been incorporated in the
district court’s remedy.
Next, we should consider my brother, Mr. Cunning­
ham's, language about K-3.

Consider the following language

admitted to by Mr. Cunningham:

"The members of the NAACP

can see justification possibly for K through 3 because we
are dealing wi.th young children the first time in school,
I have talked with some teachers and they explain that these
kids may lose or may have problems," efc cetera, end of quote.
That admission was made to the district judge.
W@ are dealing here with the desegregation of sys­
tems, school systems.

This court recognized in Keyes that

the plaintiffs had never had to prove separation of the races
by individual school building or individual student, and
that reference is contained in our brief.

It is the system

that we must look to, the entire system, and how to desegre­
gate it given the awesome urban problems that we deal with.

65
There is a valid, proper constitutional issue be­
fore this Court and this Court, now given Columbus and
Dayton of last, summer, will ultimately have to live with it,
and in the name of help for the urban condition, North and
South, it must, be addressed in the framework of what this
district judge: has tried to do for an urban condition, re­
gardless of whether it's in a State that sent its troops to
the Army of Northern Virginia.

And that issue is, from a

constitutional standpoint, if there is a remedy to be cor­
rected for a violation of the equal protection clause, that
must b© a constitutional question, and again we must address
the problem of what is th© definition of a one-race school.
Nowhere is thet addressed.
Thank you.
