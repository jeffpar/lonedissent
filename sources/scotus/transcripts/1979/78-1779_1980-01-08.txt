MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Owen v. City of

Independence, Missouri.
Mr» Achtenberg, I think you. may proceed whenever you
are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF IRVING ACHTENBERG, ESQ.,
v

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR, ACIITEMBKRGs

Mr. Chief Justice,- ant. may it please

the Courts
This is an action which arose out of the termination
of the employment of the chief of police of Independence
Missouri in the year 1972 by his employer, the City of
Independence.

The petitioner, the chief of police, believing

that his termination was under circumstances which gave rise
to a denial of procedural due process brought an action in the
Federal District Court in which he sought appropriate relief
under the Fourteenth Amendment and 42 U.I.C. 1983.

He was

denied relief by the District Court and took an appeal to the
Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals.
The Eighth Circuit, reversing the trial court, found
-that he had in fact suffered a s tigna, arising, in the course
of the termination of his employment occasioned by the acts of
the highest officials of the city which gave rise to a right
of procedural due process and reversed
ing declaratory .relief as well as. damages.

4
The court bottomed its denial of recovery against
the individual officials-p£ the city in'their indi' i ual
capacities on this Court’s decision in Hood v, Strickland»
It said hdwever that the decision in Wood did not. prevent it
from finding entity liability against the city»
Based upon that decision unfavorable against the
city,•the city sought and filed a petition for certiorari before
this Court»
QUESTION:

.Was -the trial before or after our

decision in the Monell case?
UR. ACHTENBERG:
■

The trial was prior to Monell.

The petition for certiorari before this Court was

handed down its decision in Monell»

contradicting its prior findings as to stigma denied all relief,
taking the position which we think-was totally unjustified

It was based upon the denial of a

of various local goverumental officials when the question has

It begins first with

terpretation of a statute,
Civil Rights Act of 1371.

If. is a

and in so doing the Court in each case has said fir

£

this is a remedial statute which must be broadly construed.
It is mandatory in its language.

To find any exceptions or

immunities thereunder, we must look to the history, to the
t

common law and to the legislative history of the Act to
whether or not there are any
exceptions which we can properly feel were incorporated
silentio, without comment, in the statute.

Because of their vary

nature they, must have been known and implicitly incorporated
by the 42nd Congress?

I think the Court commented many of whose

law.

and we ware greatly assisted by the brief of the EE A. a^.. re

Now, we cannot say that there is not some case which
neither the NEA nor we could: discover but we certainly can say
that we have sufficiently researched the extensive cases of

Let us say for example -that a city had adopted an
ordinance which said that blacks could not be with!

MR. CARLISLE:

That is exactly right, Your Honor»

Again, I am comfortable with that argument, based upon

X would hasten to add that in Footnote, 23 of my
.

t

brief there are considerations similar, though not coterminous,
with Qualified good faith immunity of the individual which do
pertain as to whether or not there should, be retroactive monetary
relief in a policy case.
This Court is quite often struggling with that
idea of whether policy is voidable or void ab initio, whether
some sort of presumption

0j*’ validity of policy such as we

s

41
should have on our charter would continue" that policy in effect
until it is ultimately deemed to fos unconstitutional*
QUESTIONs

Mr. Carlisle, may I ask you a question about

the basic claim 'in the case to get all these arguments,
because I understand the good faith defense rests largely -on
the fact that the state of the law was uncertain or hadn't
developed at the time of the events in question.
MR. CARLISLE;
QUESTION:

In large, Your Honor.

Now, assume that the same events, took pla

today and everybody knew the law# 30 y°u wouldn't have this kind
©•£ a good faith argument.
Would you agree that the facts would support recovery
by idle plaintiff under 1983 against somebody?
MR. CARLISLEs
QUESTIONS

Yes, Your Honor.

O.K. , 1 'just wanted to be sure of that.

MR. CARLISLE t

The actual good faith in this case of

. course was not limited solely to the nbnexitenstence of subtle
■ law and, indeed, the existence' of good, faith is not a question
presented on appeal.

But in that regard we also were talking

about- no malice, which was established below; we are talking
about job offers that ware made, we were talking «about informal QUESTION s

That would have to do with the extent of

damages perhaps, wouldn't it?
A

MR. CARLISLE;

X believe it has much to do with

qualified good faith Immunity, which-

defeat **«*

42

■ js Well., nwf I am talking about the job offers
that were made,
HR. CARLISLE;

Yes,, that would be mitigation as well

but it is the type of suggestive factor that I think the Court
took into consideration when talking about no malice.
QUESTIONs

Well, have in this case, don't you, as in

so many cases of this kind different elements that are very
easily kind of interchangeable and not easy to separate.

First

■the constitutional violation which could occur, any employee
could violate the plaintiff's constitutional rights.

And then

you have the respondeat superior plus requirement of Mens,11
diich says that even if an individual employee has violated a
constitutional right, the city can't be held liable unless you
i

show somethig more than respondeat superior.

And then you have

elements of damages and mitigation and that sort of thing.
MR. CARLISLE;

Yes, sir.

This is an extremely

complex case to analyze, in ay opinion, because, of the inter­
play of all of those and other issues in here in this case.
It is a lot easier I think to maybe look at seme other allegation
in plaintiff's complaint that aren't here tl kind of define'
what I mean about when qualified immunity is not available.
He made allegations for example as to -*«* as I mentioned „„
section of our charter being over-broad.
look at the language.

I -think this Court can

I think it can look at arguments of

counsel, but things like whether the council maliciously passed

43
that is not going to stop this Court from reviewing some
language of my charter»

By the same token„ if -the city council

conspired to fraudulently pass a. policy. you would be talking

„

about conduct wouldn't you»
In the making of that policy you can have fraud»
There are many 0 many cases involving fraud by policy-making
bodies but that is conduct»

That is a tort»

But then,, really,, something comes into existence that
is called policy»

There is —

QUESTION:

Wha-fi has fraud got to do with a

constitutional violation of 1983?
MR» CARLISLE;

I think you could have fraudulent

conspiracy to deprive someone of a constitutional right and that
'conspiracy could be either in the making of policy or in the
execution of policy»

But then when Ilia policy itself would

come into existence there is really something there to review,
for example section 3»3 of our charter»

It has language? it

exists? you can sit down and you can look at it»
about legislative intent»

You can talk

You can talk about rational basis»

This Court does it all the time and it.has done it all the
time in 1983 cases»

Monall is basically such a case? where
N

you are talking about a leave of absence policy»
something that you can review as policy»

That is

Craig v« Bourne was

a 1983 case where you were talking I believe about age
discrimination? when you could buy beer»

44
Case after case after case you are looking at a
regulation and this Court is not going to concern itself with
the objective and subjective parts of qualified good faith
immunity 'when you are reviewing policy itself0
QUESTION;

Now, let me ea.r:;:y the question I asked you

before one step further®

I think I understand the answer but I

want to ba sure,
Would you agree that if the facts that have been
found here occurred today that the city would be liable under
19 83?
MR® CARLISLE?

If we do accept, as I have only for

/

the purposes of argument, that in some of that conduct can
bind the city®

And I think basically it can*

In other contexte getting away from this case

•

because I think the Court of Appeals was wrong when pressed to
♦

adroit that, and although it is not salient to my theory as a
whole, but I think that you can have situations possibly which
may create a 1983 case for violation of Federal laws where
employee conduct notwithstanding the non-application of the
respondeat superior theory could conceivably create entity
liability*
QUESTION:

Well, then specifically, this is such a

case unless we hold that, there is good faith immunity for the
municipality?
MR® CARLISLE:

I am afraid I don't understand the

question, Your Honor»
*

QUESTION;

I think I understand you to be arguing,

and in part admitting, -that if the facts we have before us
occurred today so there was no good faith immunity defense
available, the city would be liable? the conversa of which is
that you are saying in essence that you are relying squarely on
good faith immunity as the reason the city is not liable»
MR. CARLISLE:

I am, Your Honor, because I sea

absolutely no policy that I can rely on one way or the other.
Our charter is silent as to policy.

We are looking only only

at conduct, conduct which merely because of the rank of Paul
Roberts was policy.
QUESTION5

If that is true, may I ask you, because

I really didn't find you addressing this very much:

Why should

— what is there in the law to support the notion that in a
situation which a city would otherwise be liable it should be
immune from liability because of the good faith of its
officials?
MR. CARLISLE:
of the cause of action.

Simply because you look at the nature
I agree with opposing counsel that the

qualified good faith immunity may be an ill-chosen term, because
I think it relates to the cause of action.
If you are talking about a Federal tort,

opposing

counsel designates this case today, then you are looking at a
.background of tort liability ghat includes concepts such as

46
state of mind, approximate cause, cause in. fact and duty*

-I

believe that the good faith immunity -- if we can call it an
immunity, which is really I think a defense on the merits ~—
relates directly back to plaintiff*s prima facie case on thin
Federal tort and what if the
QUESTIONS

merely —

It is rather unusual to have an affirmative

defense relate back to the prima facie case*
\

MR*CARLISLE:

Not at all, Your Honor*

Whether or not

something is tin affirmative defense is, as I understand civil
procedure, made on a determination of whether or not it would
be a permitted but disfavored

defense, which this may well be,

the convenience to the parties, accessibility to evidence, quite
often we have a defense on the merits that is made an affirmative
defense*
tod, incidentally, I do not .know of this Court ever
having held, and 1 think Wood v« Strickland can be held to the
contrary or seen to the contrary, that the good faith defense
as we know it is indeed an affirmative defense*
kind of accepted as

It is just

such, but I do not know that to b© the

case *
QUESTION;

Procunier v« Navarette tends to support you

on that*
MR* CARLISLE:

Yes, sir*

QUESTION;

Yes*

QUESTION?

Mr* Carlisle, . the only injury alleged in

this case* as I understand it* is stigma.
Is that correct?
MR. CARLISLEs
QUESTION:

As I understand it* Your Honor.

The District Court found also* as I under­

stand it* that there was no stigma; is that correct?
MR» CARLISLE:
QUESTION:

Yes* Your Honor* —

Well, why do you give you?.' case away,

then?
MR. CARLISLEs
oh appeal.

Again,, it is not the question presented

.1 do reserve parts of that. Your Honor, and my last

point relied on when I talk about the threshold question being
a deprivation.

I do not believe 'a deprivation of liberty

occurred in this case.
QUESTION:

Well, why don’t you stand on that?

MR. CARLISLE-:

Well.» it was beck a little bit further

in my argument -■*** my last point relied on, Your Honor —

QUESTIONS

In responding to my brother Justice

Stevens- I have understood you to concede that —
MR. CARLISLE:

I do not concede that stigma is present

in this ease.
QUESTIONs

All .right.

We didnFt limit it, did we?
QUESTION-:

Well, -the Court of Appeals felt there was.

MR. CARLISLE:

The Court of Appeals found that there

was; a -deprivation of liberty.

48
QUESTION i

And that there was stigma.

MR. CARLISLE:
QUESTION s

There must be —

So to the extent that as a respondent you

rely on the contrary you are going contrary.to the Court of
Appealse which is your privilege.
MR. CARLISLE:

Yes.

And my last point relied on Your

Honor I claim that there was no deprivation of liberty.
QUESTIONi

Well, in fairness to you then, Mr.

Carlisle, you really want to withdraw your answer to one of my
questions.

You don’t really accept for purposes of decision

the proposition that if this conduct referred today there would
be liability against anybody.
MR. CARLISLEs

If it occurred today. Your Honor, —

I understand what you are saying — there are two different
ways of looking at it®

I feel that your question in. the abstract

as to the availability of a qualified immunity defense which I
believe is lost if you are acting in the face of subtle law.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. CARLISLE s
QUESTION;

That was the answer —

I meant to ask you'b^pausefthere are so

so many issues that cross-cross in the case is;

.

Assuming yon

didn’t have a qualified immunity defenses at all because of the
fact it occurred today and there is no matter of unsettled law
or anything else.

Just on the basic facts of the case I was

asking you whether or not you were contending that there would

49

be no liability anyway»
MR* CARLISLE;

There would be none under my last —•

I do not believe that plaintiff has established a threshold
question of deprivation of liberty*
QUESTION:

And that is because you don't regard these

comments as stigma?
MR» CARLISLE:

They were not stigmatising in connection

with the discharge, Your Honor»
QUESTION;

That is because they (a) were not

stigmatizing or (b) were not in connection with the discharge?
MR» CARLISLE;

Primarily they were not in connection

with the discharge, although I think the District Court was
correct in finding, and ho was the fcryar of fact that the
plaintiff’s name was cleared by the return of —
QUESTION:
Cl) not stigma?

You have got three possible arguments:

2) not in connection? and (3) would be **~

New, which are you —

MR» CARLISLE:

I have’ conceded; for the purposes of

argument all along that the robust comments of Paul Roberts were
stigmatizing»
QUESTION;

All right»

But you deny that they were in connection with the
discharge?

I certainly do, Your Honor®
