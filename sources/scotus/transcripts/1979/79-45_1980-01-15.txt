PROCEEDINGS
HR a CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Nest is Lewis v. BT

Investment Managers.
Mr. Griswold, you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERWIN N„ GRISWOLD, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MRo GRISWOLD:

Hay it please the Court, this case

is her® on appeal from a three-judge District Court in the
Northern District of Florida.

It is a constitutinal case in

the commerce clause area relating to hanks.

It involves

specifically the validity of two Florida statutes duly enacted
by the Florida legislature, designed to prevent activities in
Florida

by subsidiaries of out-of-Sfcate bank holding companies.
The first of these statutes, section 659.141 of the

Florida statute, as amended, effective in December 1972.
is set out in full in Appendix A at
brief

This

the close of the appellant's

that is the red brief -- the appendices are separately

paginated but 1 think it can be easily found at the beginning
of Appendix A -- the part which is relevant in this case is
at the beginning of the section on the first half of page A-l.
Except as provided in subsection (3), no bank, trust company
or holding company, the operations of which are principally
(joncucted outside this State, shall acquire, retain or own
directly all

or substantially all the assets of or control over

4

any bank or trust company having a place of business in the
State where the business of banking or trust business or
functions are conducted.

That is the first part, a bank or

a trust company or require, or retain, or own all or substantially
all of the assets of or control over any business organisation
having a place of business in the State where, or from which

Mow, that statute was amended in 1972 and reads

: 1

p

in'? its present form, that prior to that it had been applicable
only to the frendering of investment services to banks.

But the

restriction of the banks was taken out in December 1972.

' .

V:

It will be seen that this bars an out-of-State

■ _
.
bankholding company from Cl) ruling any bank or trust company
having a place of business in the State, and it also bars outof-state bank holding company from owning a subsidiary having
a place of business in Florida from which it furnishes invest--*
raent advisory service.
The second of the Florida statutes is section 660.10
and that is in appendis B at the ©loss of the appellant’s redcovered brief.

and the essential part of it is that no one

except a bank and trust company incorporated under the laws of
the State, and having trust powers, except the national bank
located in the State and having trust powers, can exercise
any of the following powers, which include acting as executor,
guardian, trustee, trustee in various situation, receiver,

5

assignee, fiscal agent, and so on, barring anybody but Florida
corporations from conducting the trust business in Florida.
You will Sae that fits in with the corresponding provision in
the other section.
•QUESTION:

Mr. Griswold, do you think that the effect

©f these statutes would bar an individual who did not wish to
limit his liability from going into Florida and rendering these
services?

MR0 GRISWOLDs

In section 660.10, and I am looking at

itf it is plainly applicable only to corporations.

It does not

apply to individuals, you could have private individuals
acting as trustees in Florida in the

trust business.

And

s

the section has no relation to it.
QUESTION:

Mr. Griswold, before you leave the statute,

-- band that 659.141 would prohibit the

formation of a subsidiary to engage in the investment advisory
business?

Whereas, 660.11 would permit an out-of-State bank

to own a local subsidiary if it is provided by Florida
charter?
MRs GRISWOLD:
concerned, it would.
QUESTION:

Ab far as the Florida statute is

There are other -~
X have soma question as to whether we

really have to decide anything about 660., the second statute,
because I don't see that they ever tried to do that.
MR* GRISWOLD:

I agree with you entirely, Mr. Justice?

however, the court below did grant an injunction against the
enforcement of 669.141 and entered a declaration that 660.10
was unconstitutional.
In view of that stand, the result is essentially the
same, v?ith respect to trust companies.

But I think the operatie

opsrativo statute is 559.141.
i • 659.141.
The court below hold that first of the statutes was

?

unconstitutional as applied to trust and investment advisory
services as an interference with interstate commerce.

In the

Court's words» this parochial legislation must be viewed par
se unconstitutional.

It enjoined the enforcement of the statute

©xe©pt as to -- or except with banks.

If also gave a declaratory

judgment t© section @60.10, is invalid as violative of the
esMersa clause.

9

We

have discussed a number of cases in our brief,

but the case which is closest to this, I believe, is tha
decision two years ago in Exxon Corporation v„ Governor of
Maryland.
It is appropriate I think to point out that the
court below didn’t even discuss the Exxon case.

It didn’t

even eit© it in its opinion, even though it is I think clearly
the closest case.

It involved the Maryland statute which

prohibited all producers and refiners of petroleum products
from operating retail service stations in Maryland» or from
discriminating between customers in Maryland.
Now, there are no producers or refiners of petroleum
products in Maryland, which everyone knew, it is suggested in
thje other side’s brief here, that this statute is bad because
it is discriminatory on its face whereas the Maryland statute
' -»

was not.

But this Court said in the Hughes v, Oklahoma case

last week that a statute must be determined as to whether it
is discriminatory on its face or in its operation and effect.
.i

>

And the impact cf the statute in the Exxon case was
entirely on out-of-State refiners and producers which operaticservice stations in Maryland.
This Court noted thnt statute did not totally block
z\z::.

rs of petroleum from entering into a market

d this statute did not totally block extra-state corporations,
individuals,' businesses „ ethos than banks and bank holding

10

holding companies from entering the Florida market.
QUESTION:

Well, how do you enter the Florida

market under these statutes; how would a New York bank enter
the Florida market?
MR3 GRISWOLD:

The Hew York bank can’t enter the

market but Paine, Weber, Jackson a Curtis can open an office and
got investment advice in Haw York.

Standard & Poor’s, which

pats ©ut much investment service, can open an office and give
investment advice frcm New Y©rk.

MRe GRISWOLD;

The history of this country is filled

for 150 years of the struggle between national banking and
local banicing.

Justice of this Court attained prominence because he supported
President Jackson in opposition on behalf of the State of

MRo GRISWOLD:

Mo, it is not.

QUESTION:

banks may give investment advice to Florida citizens?

MRo GRISWOLD:

They can do it by mail or telephone and

they can send representatives into the State as long as they

But could they act as trustee of assets

located in Florida?
MR« GRISWOLD:

Not without complying with section

660.10, which means

QUESTION:

You have to be a corporation.

MRo GRISWOLD:

-- becoming incorporated in Florida.

I think it is appropriate now to move on to the
other aspect of the case which is the fact that we have two
strings to our ball.

I have tried to argue so far that under

Exscon there is not interstate commerce here which is adversely
affected by this statute sufficiently to require the result
reached below.
But there are two Federal statutes which are directly
relevant.

These Federal statutes are important not only be­

cause of the text of their provision but also because they
represent important policy determinations made by Congress
which are relevant in determining the validity of the Florida
statute here involved.
fhes? show that Congress made clear choices in this
area and these should not be frustrated by opening the doors
to minors and sappers, to use an historical phrase, in the
form of the devices involved here which if allowed, and if

15

allowed here soon extended., will allow out-of-State bank holding
companies to do much of what they have been specifically for­
bidden to do by Congress»
QUESTION:

Mr. Griswold, before you move on, what

would the District Court's.decision here do to the general
provisions in all the Sun Belt States denying reciprocity of
admission to the bar?
MR. GRISWOLD:
Justice.

I haven't the slightest idea, Mr.

There isn’t any question of reciprocity involved in

the decision of the court below.
QUESTION:

But it is a common fact that the Sun Balt

States simply refuse to admit on reciprocity where most of the
other States don’t.
MR. GRISWOLD %

But the factors involving control by

a State over admission to the bar it seems to me are historically
and otherwise different factors than those involved in the
admission of foreign corporations to do business in the State,
particularly in the light of the Federal statutory provision
to which I as .about to r@£®r to.
The first of the statutes was the MacFadden Act
which was passed in 1927, more then 50 years ago.

It relates

t© national banks but it ©ays that national banks have branches
in a State except to the extent that State banks can have
branches in the State.

And it also prevents interstate branch­

ing ©f national banks because branches were by that statute

16

limited to States within which the national bank was situated.
But pressure to reach out is always found in the banking area.
That, indeed, is what this case is all about.

In due course

the effect of these limitations on banking* including the
limitations in the laws of most of the States* lad to the
development of a new expansive device and thus to vast growth
in the use of bank holding companies.
By creating a corporation to own multiple banks it
was possible to avoid limitations on branching* not only intra­
state but across State lines, across many State lines.

It was

to deal with this problem that Congress passed the Bank Holding
Company Act in 1S56 and it contains three provisions that are
relevant hare.
The first of these is section 3(d) and that appears
in Appendix C as 12 U0S0 Code 1842 (b).

And it provides --- it

bars any bank holding company or subsidiary from acquiring any
additional bank located outside of the State where the holding
company's banking subsidiaries are operating unless this is
expressly authorised by the outside State.

And here we have

the Florida statute which says, we don't authorise* just what
is invited by that provision.
Arid the second provision is section 4 of the Bank
Holding Company Act r,ow found in 12 DoS,C„ 1843, in Appendix B
at the close of the appellant's brief.
there says,

The basic provision

"Except as otherwise provided in this Act no bank

17

holding company shall acquire direct or indirect ownership or
control of any voting shares of any company which is not a
bank*"
And if it is said that these investment advisory
and trust company services are not banks, Congress has said
feh© out-of-Sfeate holding company shan’t own it.
And then finally there is section 7 of the Bank
Holding Company Act which is in Appendix E, which broadly
reserved to the States their powers to regulate a bank holding
company and their subsidiaries -- the last three words are
"and subsidiaries thereof" — as long as the State regulation
is not inconsistent, with the Acts of Congress.
Mow, thus the basic Federal statutory scheme may ba
stated very simply.

Ho bank holding company may own a bank

outside the home State without the outside State’s expressed
permission.
It does not 8©3ra to me to be too difficult to construe
this to apply to bits and pieces of banks, particularly when
they are owned by a bank holding company and are so closely
related to managing or controlling banks as to be a proper
incident thereof as the Federal Reserve Board has determined.
MRo CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will resume there at

1:00 o'clock* Mr. Griswold.
(Whereupon, the hearing was recessed, to reconvene
at Is 00 o'clock p.m., the

same day.)

AFTERNOON SESSION
(1:00 PoMc)

MRo CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Griswold, you may

resume.
FURTHER ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERWIN No GRISWOLD, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MRo GRISWOLD:

First, I would like to make a brief

further answer t© what, in effect, were two questions closely
related, from Justice Stevens.
This case does not involve a question of who makes
&

sale, of what business is done.

©f Federalism.

This case involves an aspect

The difference between Paine Weber and the

appellee here is that the appellee is a bank, a bank holding
eorapany.

And the whole history of this country for 200 years

shows a constant struggle on the highest policital level to
maintain the position of the States with respect to the
handling of money.

And that is what this case is about.

This

is both the Congress and the States have passed legislation
in this area over many years.

And the statutes which are

involved here are statutos of that type.
How, I was r@forri.ng to the particular provisions
in tha Bank Holding Company Act, the first one of which is
that a bank holding company cannot own a bank in a State unless
the State says it can.
The second one is that no bank holding company may

19

any company which is not a bank and these things are not
banks, this investment advisory,, and strange to say, th© trust
business is not a bank.
And then there comes -- well, through these provisions
Congress has formulated a national policy in this area.

This

sss© would naver have arisen were it not for an exception to
section 4 of th© Bank Holding Company Act which is in 12 U,S0C0
1843(e)(8) and is printed on page D2, Appendix D of the
appellant’s brief.

And it says "And such prohibition shall

not with respect to any other bank holding company apply to
shares of any company, the activities of which the Board" —
that is th© Federal Reserve Board -- "after new notica an
opportunity for hearing as determined by order or regulation
to b@ so closely related to banking or managing or controlling
banks as to bo a proper incident thereto. „
How* the appellees contend that in substance by this
exception Congress has undone much of what it so clearly did
and intended to do In th© basic parts of the very same statute.
I do not think that this exception needs to be
construed or should be construed to authorize any such result,
to authorise, in effect, th© introduction of a new cutting edge
of expansion from outside th© State, when the whole tenor of
the statute and its history shows that the basic policy choice
made by Congress was t© protect the States from expansion by
outside bank holding companies, except to the extent that the

20

State chose to authorise such expansion.
The basic policies established by Congress are
clear, no bank outside the State, no subsidiary which is not
a bank.

This gives color to and helps to define the scope of

the exemption given in (c)(6).

To use the words used by the

Court in another text, these basic -- in another context, those
basic prohibitory provisions provide emanations which help
to determine the intent of Congress which

was expressed in

CO (8) .
My suggestion is that (c)(8) can be given full
seep© and effect by construing it to have territorial
limitation, that (c){8) authorises the Board to authorise a
bank holding company to own a corporation which is not a ban3c,
to provide services to the bank holding company in a State
where the bank holding company is authorised to own a bank.
But that if should not be construed in a wide open way to
authorise the bank holding company to proceed into other States,
all other State's without limitation.
QUESTION:

Was that the basis — is that the

construction the Board put on it?
MR0 GRISWOLD:

The Board has not ~~ the Board

considered this case up to the point where Florida passed the
statuta and then the Board said because Florida says we
i

can't go there, wo will not authorize it.
QUESTXOMs

That is your position.

21

MRo GRISWOLDs
QUESTION:

I believe that the

Is it now your position?

MR o GRISWOLD:

I believe that the Board has authorized

some bank holding companies to have a subsidiary outside the
Stata.

I am contending the Board was wrong.
QUESTION;

The Board might do this in a State that

didn’t prevent it.
MRo GRISWOLD;

It might do it in a State which

didn't prevent it.
QUESTION;

And you would say that it didn't in a

State that did prevent it, it was right.
MRo GRISWOLD;
QUESTION;

In a State ---

You would say the Board was quite right

then in denying permission heree because Florida prevented
it.
MRo GRISWOLD;

Yes, I would say they were but I

would also say that the Board has no power under this statute,
if properly construed, because the statute ought to be
construed to authorise the Board to allow these subsidiary
assisting factors only in States where the bank holding company
needs those factors in order to carry out its banking business
ia those States.
QUESTION;

So you are disagreeing the administrative

construction of this action.
MR o GRISWOLD s

Not

there never has been a clear

22

administrative construction by way of
QUESTION:

But you said you thought the Board x?as

wrong, a moment ago.
MRo GRISWOLDs

I think that in those cases where the

Board has authorised this outside of the State where there is
a bank that properly considered judicial authority might hold
if the Board was wrong.
As Justice Cardoso said in the Panama Refining case,
the meaning of the statute is to be looked for not in any
single section but in all the parts together and in their
relation to the end in view.
And 1 would call attention to the fact that in the
recent case of See v

Boyle involving jurisdiction of appeals

from the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, this Court
did exactly that; it applied a territorial limitation to a
statute which was otherwise quite clear.
Accordingly-, we think that the judgment below was
erroneous and should be reversed.
MRo CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Mr. Warden.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN Lo WARDEN,

ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR a WARDEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
X should pcint out initially that the statutory
provision that Dean Griswold was just referring to, which is

23

at D~2 of the Appendix, the red brief, contains no territorial
limitation.

It has newer been construed by the Board to

contain the limitation that Dean Griswold contends should be
read into it.

Indeed, until a few minutes ago I wasn't aware

that that argument was being made in this case.

And if that

construction is adopted by the Court, with no basis whatsoever,
it will result in invalidating literally hundreds of
substantial acquisitions made by bank holding companies with
the approval of the federal Reserve Board, not disturbed by
any judicial proceeding, for many years.
QUESTION':

What do you say?

I suppose you will gat

to it, but what would you say tha Board's error was in denying
permission here?
MRo WARDEN
construed this

Well, Mr. Justice White, the Board has

Court's decision in Whitney as requiring it

to give effect to State law in ruling on applications, whatever
the eonstutionality of the State law.

In other words, it will

not determine the constitutional question.

It remids the

parties to the Court for that purpose, which is why this case
was instituted in a three-judge District Court in Florida and
brought up hero as it has been.
So the Board's final action was:

We would have

approved or we would likely have approved this application
but for the recent hastily enacted Florida statute.
QUESTION:

Do you think the Eoard also -- or perhaps

24

it didn't ~~ you don't think there is any element in the
Board's decision that — to the effect that Congress consented

to the kind of Florida statute?
MRe. WARDEN:

No, 1 do not.

The Court noted in its opinion in Whitney that the
Board had at that poist considered that section 7 of the
Bank Holding Company Act permitted States to preclude the
doing of business by hank holding companies entirely, to
preclude that form of commercial organization.
to reach that question in this case,

We don51 have

for since Florida

permits the doing of business by bank holding companies it
permits that form of commercial organization.
But I don't believe there is any indication that
the boar

roads so at i on 7 as perf.it ting an otherwise

unconstitutional 7iscrinin ition against out-of-State firms.
QUESTIOos

Well, it is if Congress permitted

No.

I said "an otherwise," and they

And they make no such allusion in

their opinion in this cns2.

to the question of whether interstate commerce is involved
in this car : at all, which Dean Griswold addressed, I do not

/

the appellant.

And the fact that the business that Bankers

Trust proposes to engage in would be conducted in interstate

commerce was not disputed by Florida before the three-judge
District Court and, in fact, was conceded.
QUESTION:

Let me — 1 just want to clear up one

more, point.
Do you think the Board has addressed either way the
question of congressional consent?

MR. WARDEN:

To this sort of statute, I do not.
So you can't rely on Board construction

That :!a correct.
commerc

grants Congress the authority to regulate commerce among

HRo WARDEN:

Well, that is correct, Your Honor, but

the consistent line of authority in this Court has been that
it has negative implications of its own force for State
statutes that discriminate against interstate commerce.
There was no Federal statute involved, for example, in
Philadelphia v. New Jersey, at least of which X am aware.
had I believe that Dean Griswold has conceded in his brief
on behalf of the Conference of State Bank Supervisors at
page 4, that the commerce clause has exactly the same scope
when relied upon to strike down discriminatory State:
regulation as when relied upon to justify affirmative

I might add that a New York-based financial
institution operating these businesses in Florida by means

inescapably involved in interstate commerce.

27
'Ci ■

second /

1 would like to make is that this

case doss not involve banking or any issue of competitive
quality between State and national banks or any question of the
dua 1 regu.1 ation of b?.nks.
The distinction between the business of banking and
the businesses here involved, trust services and investment
advisory services, is recognized not only in the Bank Holding
Company Act by Congress, which I shall address in a moment,
but right on the face of Florida statute, section 659.141,
which expressly discusses as discreet businesses the business
of banking, the trus .

iness and investment advisory

services.
■ lxOH:

They might be lesser included offenses

And otherwise

28

IRo WARDEN :

-- an indication of that.

But I point

out that not.only the Paine Weber8s engaged in investment
advisory services, but other forms of non-deposit trust
companies such as what we propose to set up here, engage in
*

trust services? and so do natural persons who have no banking
powers whatsoever.

I think we used the illustration in our

brief the manufacturer of aircraft doesn't become the
manufacturer of automobiles because it is carried on by
General Motors.
'■low, I should also point out, because I thought it
might have been unclear, while I am talking about 659.141,
that that statute itself bars us both from the investment
advisory business an 1 from the trust business, irrespective
of 650, because 659.141 keeps us out whether we have a locally
incorporated subsidiary or open an office of an out-of-State
s ubsidiary.
QUESTION:

kb 11, Mr. Warden if —

MR,. WARDEN:
QUESTION:
ii
ahe

Yes, sir.
™- if the District Court was correct in

unconstitutional, why would we have to go
agreed with them, just for purposes of
till have to go ahead and consider

the other statute; and if so, why?
MR o WARDEN:

I think you would", Mr. Justice Stevens,

because as Dean Griswold suggested in his brief ? it appears

23

that the-, law or court ray have read 660.10 ass of its own force
precluding Bankers Trust New York Corporation Holding Company
from complying with its terms by incorporating a local
subsidiary.

Now, the statute doesn’t say that on its face.

QUESTION;

Well, then why should a Federal court

assume — you know you certainly don’t strain to give the
statute, an unconstitutional reading.
MR, WARDENs

Absolutely not, Your Honor,but Florida

has not yet represented or conceded in this proceeding that
the statute will not be

30

construed and enforced if Florida

does so or if this Court rules that that is not what the
statute means.

QUESTION:

Wellf the Florida courts have never had

an opportunity to interpret the law.

Their District Court

originally abstained and you appealed, saying they shouldn't
have abstained.
HR. W&RD3H s

Well , at that point Bankers Trust took

the position that the re was- nothing unclear about this
statute.
But to say that Florida hasn't yet
conceded, very likely the Executive branch in Florida or the
!tata banking authorities aren't in
a position tv rake the final determination .

That is for the

30

Plorida courts I would think.
MR, WARDENS

If I may- Your Honor, I think that If

the lower court did construe the statute the way Dean Griswold
suggested it may have, the lower court clearly erred.

In that

question the State law is,so clear that it should be disposed
of by this Court.

You are suggesting you should lose on

MRo WARDEN:

No, I am not suggesting we should lose

I am going to get to another aspect

of that statute in just a moment.
But the decision below need not be affirmed on that
basis if this Court construes the statute not to operate as
it may have been thought to operate by the District Court.
There will nonetheless remain the' effect of 660.10 on Bankers
Trust's New York subsidiaries which conduct a large trust
business and are pra f.ud w by that statute from themselves

a local office, of a Florida resident, even when named in

because they haven't tried to form a subsidiary, or have
they?

And -MRo WARDEN:

It has been stipulated that but for

659.1. 1 and 660.10 if considered of its own force to have that
effect, Bankers Trust would apply to incorporate a local
subsidiary.

36

QUESTION:

If we read 660.10 the way you suggest the

plain language indicates, there is no harm to the client and
no reason to reach the constitutionality of a statute which
says you have got to be locally incorporated.
MR» WARDEN:

That is correct as to the principal

issue tried below,, which was Bankers Trust attempt to open a
local office in Florida.
QUESTION:
ME. WARDEN:

Right.
That statute will, however, continue

©£ its own force to prevent Bankers Trust New York operating
a subsidiary.
QUESTION:

But there is no evidence they have ever

tried to do anything themselves, is there?
MR. WARDEN:

There is not, Your Honor.

There is,

however, a stipulation that the enforcement of the statutes
and each of them has caused Bankers Trust Haw York Corporation
economic injury.
QUESTION:

Do you think that is enough to Require us

to face the constitutionality of tbs statute that says
in order to engage in trust business you have got to be locally
chartered?
MR. WARDEN:

Wall, that is the stata of the record,

Mr. Justice Stevens.
Now, if 1 may proceed with ray basic constitutional
point, the statutes that Florida here seeks to sustain

37

in fact ©ii their face t the simple economic protection as the
Court held invalid per s® two terms ago in Philadelphia v.
Blew Jersey.

Florida has not sought by these statutes to

regulate bank holding companieal in a way that is evenhanded on its face but in operation discriminates against
interstate firms.
The so-called regulation here in issue affects only
firms not based in Florida and it does not regulate them.

It

prohibits them absolutely from providing the services in
question in Florida.
The Exxon case ijpon which the opponents pise© their
principal reliance simply does not stand for the proposition
that the commerce clause allows a State to exclude some but not
all out-of“State firms as out-of-State firms.

The barrier in

Exxon was not against interstate firms but against vertically
integrated firms, Maryland based or otherwise.

This Court

expressly noted 437 U.S. at 126 that Maryland’s statutory
scheme did not. "distinguish between in-State and out-of-State
companies in a retail market."
Florida's statutory scheme , in stark contrast, does
nothing but distinguish between in-State and out-of-State
companies in those markets.
Florida has acted not to preclude the doing of
certain business by bank holding companies but to preclude
out-of-Stat® bank holding companies from doing business in

38

Florida.
Secondly, Hughes v. Oklahoma did not overrule or
limit Phi.lad-alpha v. New Jersey, it cited the case with
approval.

and as our briefs note, the first point of the

Hughes three-point test incorporates the holding in
/

Philadelphia and says that at the very least in the case of
a statute discriminating on its face the State has the burden
to justify, under strict scrutiny, a nondiscriminatory local
purpose in the absence of noadiseriminatory alternatives.
Florida has done neither.
As to the supposed need to protect the people of
Florida from some undefined menace ©f large financial companies,
it is sufficient to say that the statutory scheme doss not
even make a pretense of doing so.

MR. WARDEN:

No, but our argument, Mr. Justice White,

corporations similarly unless it justifies, under strict
scrutiny, soma legitimate nonprotectionist reason for doing

QUESTION:

It isn’t a regulation of banking in a

MR® WARDEN;

QUESTION;

If your argument is valid, a State which

did not permit bank holding company“type of operation could
do what Florida is trying to do here.
MRo WARDEN;

That is a much stronger case for the

State, Mr» Justice Stevens,but X would submit that is not this
ease.

But 1 would submit that in such a situation, if local

banks were allowed to engage in the trust and investment
advisory business, say, the solo effect of such a statute
would he to proclude out-of-Stata competition in the trust and
investment advisory businesses which Congress has recognised
are net the business of banking and therefore are not within
th© consent that is given to the state to exclude multi-state
banking.

MRo IfAHDENs
QUESTION;

That is not this case.
If 1 understood Mr.

Griswold correctly,

so what you should look at is not just eut-of-State banks
©r bank holding companies but all out-of-State concerns that
want to enter the investment advisory service market.

As in

Exxon you look at tha whole investment advisory service market
and say keeping out a few New York banks isn’t going -- there
is. no proof that will affect that market because there is
Fain© Weber and others who may come in.

That is what I. under *

stood his argument to be.
MB'».' WARDEN;

Well, there is no evidentiary record

to support the contention that this has a de minimus effect
©.ad the State had tha burden of establishing that,given the
discrimination on the fas® of the statute.

But in any avent, 1 don’t think that is the commerce
clause test under this Court’s decision.

I think that the

commerce clause requires that like in-State firms be treated
the same ns like out-of"State firms.
