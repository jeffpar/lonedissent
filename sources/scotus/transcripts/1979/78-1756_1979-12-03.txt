ORAL ARGUMENT OF LOUIS F. CLAIBORNE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
I

MR. CLAIBORNE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case is here from a judgment of the Court of
Claims on the petition of the United States.

In that court the

plaintiffs were first soma 1,500 Indian allottees.

On asso­

ciation consisting of those allottees and perhaps others and
the Quinault Tribe itself.

The case concerns the management

of timber on the Quinault Reservation.

That reservation was

created in 1873 by presidential order.

It was provided for

some 20 years earlier by treaty, leaving the location, and
dimensions of the reservation to be determined bv the President
at same later time.
The reservation consists of some 200,000 acres of
land, mostly coverecl'by timber.

Some one-thisrd of that area

has now bean taken out of trust, but the remainder and the land
we are told involved in this case is sane 130,000 acres of
timberland.

Because the land was overgrown with timber, it was

originally thought that it was not appropriate for allotment

4

into individual parcels, but — and indeed, that was the ad­
ministrative view until this Court set the matter right in.
1924 .
During the decade that followed this Court's decision
in Payne in 1924 and until 1933 or 4 or 5, most of this reser­
vation was allotted in individual parcels, or indeed, perhaps
all of it was.

j

Typically they were 80-acre allotments and

we're told some 2,000 of them.
The tribal interest here is derivative in that since !
the Indian Reorganization Act, some small portion of the
allotted lands have returned into tribal ownershin, but a mere
4,000 acres as compared to the very much larger portion in
individual allotments.
Beginning in 1910 the Secretary of the Interior was
given statutory authority to consent to the sale of timber on
Indian allotted land as well as on Indian tribal land, and
■

whether or not those allotted lands were tecnnicallv held in
trust or were held by some other restricted patent.

In 1934

as a part of the Indian Reorganization Act, the Secretary was
required when managing Indian timber lands to do so on a sustained yield basis.
These plaintiffs brought this action in the Court of
Claims alleging a number of complaints against the Secretarv's
management of their timberlands.

They said that he had failed

to obtain a fair market value in the sales contracts,r that he

I

3

had failed to manage it on a sustained yield basis, that he’d
failed in some cases to obtain anv payment for the timber that
he'd not developed a proper system of roads, and that he'd made
improper charges against the allottees for some of those road­
works, that he'd failed to pay interest on certain sums or in­
sufficient interest, and finally, that he had exacted adminis­
trative charges, it being clear that the Secretary's entitled
to make a charge for his management of the timber, but the
allottees claim the actual charges were excessive.
In all of these respects, of course, the allottees
claimed money damages.

It is fair to sav that the case pro­

ceeded for some years in the Court of Claims before the United
States interposed the defense which is presently before this
Court.

That defense, the motion to dismiss, was premised on

the notion that these claims for monetary relief against the
United States in respect of its management of the timber did
not lie under the Tucker Act or under

its counterpart, Section

1505 of the Judicial Code, in the Court of Claims or indeed in
any other court.
That defense was no doubt prompted bv this Court's
decision in United States v. Testan in 1376.
At all events, when the motion came before the Court
of Claims, that Court overruled it, holding that applying the
rationale of Testan and its own decisions, the United States
here through its agents, the Secretary of the Interior, the

o

Bureau of Indian Affairs, had violated statutorv duties which
fairly mandated compensation in damages under the Tucker Act,
or under Section 1505 against the United States.

It is that

ruling against which we complain.
!

The case is primarily one under the Tucker Act,
Section 1491 of the Judicial Code.

Much is made of the com.

panion provision, as we call it, Section 1505, which pertains
however only to the claims of Indian tribes or identifiable
groups.

Here the great majority of the plaintiffs areindivi-

dual allottees who cannot, in our view, make any claim except
under the Tucker Act itself.
did not suggest otherwise.

And indeed, the Court of Claims
1505 was in the case, in the view

of the Court of Claims, simply because there is a small tribal
claim.
At all events, as we have elaborated in our brief,
the two statutory provisions are entirely co-extensive.

1505

allows no more monetary relief than does the Tucker Act itself.
QUESTION:

Mr. Claiborne, in your brief you indicate

that one and only one question is presented, but doesn't the
question embrace at least two questions:

First of all, is there

a private right of action created, and secondly, if so, if the
answer to that is yes, does the defendant have sovereign xmmunity?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Mr. Justice Stewart, in the context

of this case, a case based entirely on an act of Congress,

7

within the terminology of the Tucker Act, we view those questions as the same, analytically different but in practice the
same, ’'■lav I —
QUESTION:

I suppose if Congress had created a private
I

right of action, it would thereby waive the sovereign immunitv?
MR. CLAIBORNE:
QUESTION:

Exactly.

But nonetheless, aren't there two question?!?

MR. CLAIBORNE:

Analytically, Mr. Justice Stewart, I

think you're right, there are two auestions.

We place our en­

tire emphasis on the first of those questions.

That is, did

Congress in the general allotment act primarilv relied on and
entirely relied on by the Court of Claims, impliedly or expressi
ly create a right of action in money damages ■—
QUESTION:

Against the United States.

MR. CLAIBORNE:

— against the United States, when

an alleged breach of trust duty is found,
QUESTION:

Well, the Court of Claims doesn't disagree!

\
with you, does it, on the fact that you must find some kind of
a substantive right in the, in some statutes other than the
jurisdictional statutes?
MR. CLAIBORNE:
QUESTION:

That is so, Mr. Justice Ttfhite —

And so you do just differ on whether you

do find that?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Our disagreement is with the ease

with which they find such a relaxation of the rule.

3

QUESTION:

Mr. Claiborne, could you tell me, where

do you find the waiver of sovereign immunity in the ordinary
contract case, and where do you find the implied right?

The

United States just signs a contract for, a construction contract
to build a building or something, and then allegedly it, is
breached —
MR. CLAIBORNE;

Mr. Justice White, I have some difficulty

reconciling my answer with the literal words of the Testanr vs
opinion, so —
QUESTION:

Go ahead and try.

MR. CLAIBORNE:
strictly than its words

I have to rear! Testan perhaps less
;ay.

Testan says that the Tucker Act

is no more than a jurisdictional statute.

If by that is meant

the court which will hear such a claim, I have to suggest that
that language is too narrow for —
QUESTION:

You mean the Tucker Act actually contains

the waiver of sovereign immunity?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

The Tucker Act, when one looks e.t its j

original language and when one reads the long list of- cases in.
this court, must in some sense be viewed as a waiver of
sovereign immunity.
QUESTION:

So you look to that -- that contains the

waiver of sovereign immunity, but it still doesn't get you
home because you must have an implied right of action somewhere,
or expressed?

9

' MR, CLAIBORNE;

That’s so, and in a contract case,

it's certainly the Tucker Act that waives the sovereign immu­
nity —
QUESTION;

I see, I see.

MR. CLAIBORNE:

—- it can’t be the government con­

tractor, who has no such power.
.

QUESTION:

So that you don’t, when you get around to

finding out if there's a private cause of action, you don't
t

approach it as you would a sovereign immunity miestion, namely
very strict construction?
MR. CLAIBORNE;

Mr. Justice White, my answer is the

opposite, because —
QUESTION:

s

Because it would expand the sovereign

immunity to have a loose construction?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Precisely because the Tucker Act is

the waiver of sovereign immunity in some sense, one must con­
strue it narrowly.

And because the very same considerations

go to determining whether or not the United States has made it­
self liable in damages, as the question whether the United
States has opened itself to suit in any way.
I would put it in this way,

if I may, that there’s a

presumption against monetary liability of the government.

That

presumption derives from the principle of sovereign immunity
from all suit, but the principle of sovereign immunity, the
core of it, is liability to a judgment which will expend itself

xo
against the Federal Treasury or against the federal land.

In­

deed, there are suggestions that that’s all that's left of the
doctrine of sovereign immunity.
QUESTION:

You would sav, then, if you were in a

district court in some kind of a case and the question was an
injunction, there wouldn’t be a sovereign immunity case?
.

MR. CLAIBORNE:

Exactly so.

I would have said that,

Mr. Justice White, even before the amendment of the administra­
tive procedure act —
QUESTION:

Even if you’re in the court of claims and

the issue is an injunction, the party seeking the injunction
might lose, but not because of sovereign immunity; it would be
because of the limits of the jurisdiction of the court of
claims?.
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Exactly so.

Because it’s not a novel

notion that the United States and its offices open themselves
up to actions for prospective relief and hold the bar to
accountability in money damages.

One need only think of the

hundreds of cases in which courts review the action of adminis­
trators without there being any sovereign immunity bar, and
courts do direct the different action be taken in the future,
whether it’s a matter of the FDA withholding improperly per­
mission to market a new drug, or any other example I can think
of — the Department of Interior making an error in surveying
land.

Those are matters which are correctable by courts for

11

the future, and indeed to some extent perhaps, retroactively.
But we do not give rise to liability and damages
against the United States.
QUESTION;

But if you find some statute that you

think clearly enough gives a substantive right to damages to a
private individual, if you just pcse that kind of a statute,
you can take it to the Court of Claims, you can have your case
in the Court of Claims and the sovereign immunity is not an
issue at all.
MR. CLAIBORNEs

Mr. Justice White, I think it’s right

that if one finds a statutory duty which clearly permits
recovery and damages for breach, the function of the Tucker Act
in such a case is to permit you to join the United States in
QUESTION:

And even if you find a statute that's

very arguable and you file in the Court of Claims, the argument
is not sovereign immunity but the argument you are making here?
MR. CLAIBORNE:
QUESTION:

Exactly, sir.

Mr. Claiborne, before you leave that line

of inquiry that Mr. Justice White raised, I want to be sure I
understand your response to his question about the ordinary
i

breach of contract case, where the contractor claims the
government defaulted on an obligation, or so forth.

What is

the source of the implied cause of action in that sort of case?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Mr. Justice Stevens, I think one must

say that the tradition, that the remedy for breach of contract

12

is money, is the source of the obligation of the United States
like any other contractor whenbreaching a contract, to pay,
the ability to sue the United States is granted by the Tucker
Act in waiving the technical objection of sovereign immunity.
QUESTION:

Whether we're talking in terms of waiver

*

of sovereign immunity or creation of cause of action, whatever
we need in the way of statutory authority for the litigation
to proceed is found in the Tucker Act?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

But in a contract case, which of

course is not the category we’re concerned with today, is the
i

law of contracts that provides the remedy and damages.
QUESTION:
remedy.here?

Why doesn't the lav; of trust provide the

That's the next question you have to keep in mind.

MR. CLAIBORNE:

There isn't reliance here on the lav;

of trust — I can’t say the common lav; of trust, because it's
a doctrine of equity — but the unwritten law of trust is not
what is invoked in this case.

And indeed, the judgment of the

Court of Claims is very plain that there is no reliance on the
lav; of trust generally, or even on the fiduciary relationship
between Indians and the United States.
The reliance is on an act of Congress, and specific­
ally on the General Allotment Act of 1887.
QUESTION:

— stronger' case for recovery?

MR. CLAIBORNE:
QUESTION:

I’m sorry?

So then shouldn't this be a stronger case

13

for recognizing the claim?
MR. CLAIBORNE;

When reliance is placed on an act of

Congress, Mr. Justice Stevens, we say, following Testan, that
one must find in that act of Congress a provision fairly read
as mandating a recovery in damages against the government, and
that is simply wholly absent with respect to the General Allot­
ment Act.
There is no suggestion here that the origin of the
right, to collect damages is based on the law of trust generally.
And indeed, one might have a question, why the law of trust,
like the law of contract, isn't, doesn't afford the same remedy
under the Tucker Act.

The answer must be that whereas the

Tucker Act lists certain categories, it does not list law of
trust as one of them.

It lists contracts, it lists acts of

|
Congress, it lists the Constitution, it lists regulations, but
not the law of trust, and it expressly excludes the law of
torts.
Nov;, the question is, we have seen —
QUESTION:
it.

It says,

Well, it does genericallv, arguably, cover

"The Court of Claims shall have jurisdiction to

entertain a suit for liquidated or unliquidated damages in cases
not sounding in tort," and that would generically include the
law of trust or any other lav; except tort, wouldn^t it?
MR. CLAIBORNE;

Mr. Justice Stewart, commentators and

courts have pondered ovex that last clause ---

14

QUESTION:

I eon now doing so, too.

MR. CLAIBORNE:

And have usually answered that it

simply cannot be read literally, for if it were, it would ab­
solve all that came before.

It would be meaningless.

And

therefore the answer given usually is that clause cannot be
read as it*s written, but must be deemed to mean two things:
First, that damages may be recovered even though unliquidated,
and secondly, that recovery in tort is never permitted, and that
the clause qualifies all that comes before.
QUESTION:

Well, it's not permitted by the Tucker Act,

it is permitted under another act.
MR. CLAIBORNE:

And indeed in this case the Court of

Claims in its words "skipped over" that last clause, placing no
reliance on it, and the plaintiffs below have made no reliance
on it.

They did flirt with it at one stage, but in their brief

on the merits they have abandoned that.
Coming now to the question whether the statute in­
voked, the General Allotment Act of 1387, can be read as fairlv
mandating relief in damages, we think the answer clear.

That

statute contemplated a scheme whereby the land of the reservation would be divided among the Indians within 2 5 vears, and
in the meantime, the United States was simnlv to hold title in
trust solely for the purpose of preventing state taxation, it
being legal title in the United States and therefore exempt
from state taxation.

15

QUESTION:

Do you think that the question of constru­

ing a statute- in order to ascertain whether, the Congress in­
tended to give a cause of action for damages, do you think
that, our constructional problem is different than say, cases
like Court v. Ashe?

You would say that set of rules just

doesn't apply here, or not?
NR. CLAIBORNE:

I would, Nr. Justice White, say that

some of those rules do apply, as they were indeed —
QUESTION:

Well, maybe some of them, but vou would

just say, you wouldn't say,' well, let's just approach this
problem the same way as vou would in determining whether under
the Securities law, Congress intended a private cause of ac­
tion?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

No, Mr. Justice White, to that extent

I invoke the approach followed in Testan; that is, that one
requires a very clear indication, if not an express statement,
in the act of Congress relied on that the remedy for its breach ;
shall be damages, when —
QUESTION:
remedy?

Must not onlv find the right, but the

In the statute?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Exactly so.

The sovereign immunity

may be waived by the Tucker Act, but the remedy and the right
must both originate from the same statute relied on.
QUESTION:

Mr. Claiborne, the United States did not

press the issue of jurisdiction in U.S. against Mason, did it?

16

MR. CLAIBORNE:

That is certainlv true, Mr. Justice

Blackmun, whether it was simply overlooked or whether it was
thought that that was an exceptional case in that the verv
purpose of the General Allotment Act had been to exempt the
1
allotted lands from state taxes.

And that case involved the

'

question whether the Unite! States had breached its dutv to
assure that exemption from state taxes by failing to, or bv
paying over voluntarily the state taxes.
They might there have bean a clearer relation between
the breach alleged and the purpose of the. statute, whereas here
we're at a far remove from that situation.
It may also be that in Mason, the view could have
been taken that we were paying with the Indians' monev the taxes
which arguably they did not owe, and to that extent we were misappropriating funds; the kind of activity which the Testan
opinion recognises does not reauire the same express provision
in the statute.
The purposes of the General Allotment Act make it
clear that the Congress of 1387 which wrote that statute would
never have dreamt of providing that the United States shall be
amenable in damages when it mismanages, as alleged, the timber
on those lands.

It is too remote from the expectations of those

who wrote that statute to indulge any such idea, cfuite beyond
the fact that the statute doesn't itself provide for any express
remedy for breach.

17

QUESTION:

When was the Tucker Act originally en­

acted?
MR. CLAIBORNE:
QUESTION:

1387, as well.

Same year?

MR. CLAIBORNE:

Same vear.

Now, of course, the Tucker Act was a sequel to earlier
legislation which had much the same effect in resoect to the
liability of the United States for cases founded on an act of
Congress.

That had beeli the law since —
QUESTION:

The Tucker Act broadened the jurisdiction?

MR. CLAIBORNE:
QUESTION:

But not in this respect.

Didn't it?

MR. CLAIBORNE:

The remedy for — in respect of a

claim founded on an act of Congress had been in the jurisdic­
tion of the Court of Claims since 1855.
QUESTION:

Did the Tucker Act add any express or im­

plied contract of the United States?
■ MR. CLAIBORNE:

It certainly — I think not, but I

think it did add the Constitution, and I think it did also add
//
f.b.e last clause, the clause Your Honor mentioned a moment ago.
And it did in other respects change the procedure for
collecting judgments, which were previously not so much judg­
ments as they were recommendations to Congress for an appropria­
tion .
QUESTION:

Mr. Claiborne, let me call your attention •

18

to the language from the General Allotment Act cited on page 3
of the Government's brief, the last sentence, where it says,
"and if any conveyance shall be made of the land set apart and
allotted as herein provided or any contract made touching the
same before the expiration of the time above-mentioned, such
conveyance or contract shall be absolutely null and void."
Now, sir, is that referring to a conveyance by the
government?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

I think probably both, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist.
QUESTION:

Then don’t you have an expressio unius

argument to rely on there, that the remedy against the govern­
ment, if it breached its trust under the General Allotment Act, j
was simply to declare the conveyance null and void?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

I am grateful to Your Honor.

know why we should have overlooked that argument.

I don't:
i
It does seen?

to me available to say that the statute itself provided its own
remedy, clearly not one in damages, and that is an additional
reason why one shouldn't strain to find here a different —
QUESTION:

But not available in the Court of Claims?

MR. CLAIBORNE:

This remedy, of course, would not be

in the Court of Claims.
QUESTION:

But if in the District Court, how about

restitution when you declare the act a contract void?
if it involved money?

How about

MR. CLAIBORNE:

It may be that in the case of an

alienation which is wholly unauthorized —
QUESTION:

What about timber?

The United States has,

let's say, illegally parted with Indian timber, and it's a
void contract but the timber is gone and the U.S. has the
money.

Can you get a judgment against the United States for

money?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Well, I think that would probably be

money wrongfully retained within the exception noted in Testan.
It might also be a taking within the just compensation clause.
In both cases it would be recoverable under the Tucker Act
'

.

without regard to the reliance on an act of Congress0
■

If I mav reserve the balance of mv time —
QUESTION:

And where do you get the cause of action,

the implied cause of action or the expressed cause of action
when there's a constitutional claim?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

From the Constitution itself.

But

of course the Tucker Act does —
QUESTION:

Wall, you don't read it in the Constitu-

MR. CLAIBORNE:

Well, this Court has done precisely

that.

Oh, you say that's the only clause in the

Constitution for which there's a remedy against the United

Reraedy in damages, so far as I'm

aware, against the United States.
QUESTION:

So your answer is yes?

MR. CLAIBORNE:

Yes.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Hobbs.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. HOBBS, ESQ.,
*

ON BEHALF OF HELEN MITCHELL ET AL.
MR. HOBBS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and nay it please the

Court:
As a preliminary matter I would like to call the
Court's attention to the recent publication of the Whiskers
case.

The citation is 600 Fed.

\

2d 1332.

The Whiskers case was decided by the Tenth Circuit
and that court agreed with the Court of Claims below.

We sent

.

a letter to the clerk of this Court asking him to pass the
citation on to you.

He said he had no authority to do that, and

for us to make this known to you at oral argument.
QUESTION:
MR. HOBBS:

600 Fed. 2d 1332?
Yes, Your Honor.

I would like to begin by expressing a little indignation

21

to hear Justice claiming at this late date that it does not
have, the Court does not have jurisdiction over this case.
When these claims ware filed' in 1971, the law of the land was
that the Court of Claims did have jurisdiction over these
claims, and that's what the Court of Claims initially held in
the Klamath case five years before we filed these claims, and
in the Fields case a year and a half before we filed these
claims,

in Capoeman involving one of these very plaintiffs six

months before we filed these claims, the Court of Claims held
it had jurisdiction under 1491.
QUESTION:
Hobbs.

Well, vou say you feel indignation, Mr.

Isn't it the Government's responsibility to call to the

attention of any court of the United States an apparent lack of
jurisdiction on its part?
MR. HOBBS:

Yes.

Why did the Government wait so long

to spot this apparent lack?
QUESTION:

!

Well, that may be attributable to a number

of reasons, but once they spotted it, it was certainly their
obligation to call it to the attention of the Court.
MR. IIOBBS:

No doubt.

!

We had gone through an enor­

mous amount of litigation well past the time when ordinarilv
a litigant should raise a point of jurisdiction, if he has one.
We had had six years of discovery, we had three fully bric»fed
reported decisions of the Court of Claims, we had 26,000 pages

:

of exhibits developed and handed over to the Government, we held

:

22

a three week trial.

After the trial is when the Government for

the first time raised the muestion of jurisdiction.
that point the law of the land was settled.
didn’t raise the issue in the Mason case.

Up until

That’s whv they
No one questioned

jurisdiction at that late date.
QUESTION:

But we've had jurisdictional questions

raised sua sponte in this Court as to the jurisdiction of
district courts because that’s the law.
MR. HOBBS:

Justice Rehnquist, I'm not saving that

this Court cannot entertain the question of jurisdiction.

I am

only pointing out the enormous cost and inconvenience to us of
having delayed so long, while case after case, a total of I
believe nine cases went by with jurisdiction being upheld in
each one until finally they, in the wake of the Testan case,
saw that there might be an argument to be made in this case.
And they have raised it.
We don’t say they can't raise it.

In the Mason case,

it wasn't just the Court of Claims that helped give the bar the
feeling that the lav was settled.

It was this Court.

In.the Mason case, jurisdiction was invoked under
1491.

It was not seriously challenged by the Government below.

They did raise a question, but the Court of Claims held it had
jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

The plaintiffs were not an Indian tribe?

MR. HOBBS:

No, the plaintiff was an individual in

23

the Mason case.
QUESTION:

So it didn't involve 1505?

It involved

1491.
MR. HOBBS:

Correct.

This Court adjudicated the Mason case on the merits
and it noted in Footnote 5 that the suit was brought under 28
USC 14 91, which gives the Court jurisdiction to render judg­
ment upon claims against the United States, and so forth.

Now,

this certainly tells the ordinary observer that, well, here's
a case that’s been to the Supreme Court and they had no problem
with it, and then in the test of the Mason case, Mr. Justice
Marshall wrote, on page 398, "There is no doubt that the

Dutv bound.

Nov;, at the time that the court below decided in our
favor that there was jurisdiction under 1491 and 1595, 1491
of course is the Tucker Act, 1505 is the extension of the
Indian Claims Commission Act for future cases.

I am co ing to

the question of individual versus group claims,
the court below decided our case, there were tv;

lines
,

of cases in existence on the jurisdictional question.
The Klamath and the Mason cases were one line.

They

defined jurisdiction under 1491 and 1505 for Indian plaintiffs,,
and the other line was the Testan case decided by this Court
■

and the Eastport case# decided by the Court of Claims in 1967.
Eastport is the court that wrote the fairly mandating
compensation test which this Court adopted in the Testan case,
and neither Testan nor Eastport, of course, was an Indian case.
The Klamath-Mason line of cases specifically upheld jurisdiction
in cases like ours, and the Testan-Eastport line was an open
question in cases like ours with the Department of Justice sav­
ing below that Testan-Eastport meant there was no jurisdiction
even in an Indian case, and we of course arguing the contrary.
The Court of Claims en banc with every single judge
concurring, including I might add Judge Bennett, who had dis­
sented in ‘the Testan case and had been upheld by this Court
when it reversed the Testan case, all agreed that the TestanEastport line of cases was entirely in harmonv with the KlamathMason line of cases, and under both lines, the Court had juris­
diction .
Let's look at the Testan case now.
foremost, Testan was not an Indian case,

Now, first and

QUESTION:

You urged it, but they didn't, they relied;

on something else.
MR. IIOBBS:

Yes.

It's of course a rule for the con­

venience of the court whether to listen to such an argument if
the Court of Claims did not address it.
But it is a fact of the case that this is an Indian
case.

26

In the second case, also important is the fact that
the Testan case did not involve a trust.

It's instructive, I

think, to consider the kind of claim that Testan and Eastport
involved.
Testan involved the claim of a government employee
that he was entitled to the next higher grade and he should be
paid for that, and he sued for damages for the pay, back pay,
for the next higher position which he said he should have had.
The Eastport case involved someone who was disappointed
with the ruling of the Shipping Board, which failed to give him
a license to enable him to sell a ship in foreign commerce
which he had wanted.
Both of these cases involve governmental discretion,
and complex governmental decisions.

Neither involves any indi-

cation by Congress that, of any intention that there would be
a right to recover damages for that kind of case.

In our case,

we have a specific trust relationship established by Congress
in the General Allotment Act.
I would like to refresh ourselves on the language of
that Act, the part that is relevant here.

25 USC 348, which

was passed in 1887, says, quota, "The United States does and
will hold the land thus allotted for the period of 25 vears in
trust for the sole use and benefit of the Indian to whom such
allotment shall have bean made, or in case of his decease, of
his heirs, according to the lav/s of the state or territory

27

where such land is located, and that at the expiration of such
period, the United States will convey the same by patent to
said Indian or his heirs, as aforesaid, in fee, discharged of
said trust and free of all charges or encumberance whatsoever,"
In the Capoeman case, this Court held that that
language created a trust that had an important purpose of bringing the Indian to a state of competency,
QUESTION:

It says nothing about damages, does it?

MR. HOBBS:
QUESTION:

i

The General Allotment Act?
Yes.

MR. HOBBS:

No, neither do most contracts, Your

Honor, and yet it’s implied when a dutv imposed by contract has
been breached, there is a duty to respond in damages, and we
say the same applies in a breach of trust case.
QUESTION:

What about the last language, the last

sentence quoted in the Government's brief, where it says that
if the Government conveys in violation of the General Allotment
Act such contract shall be null and void?

;

Isn't there some

argument to be gained for the Government there bv saving that
Congress specified the remedy as well as the right?
MR. HOBBS:

I could not see when you were in dialogue

with Government counsel, I could not see the existence of a
remedy there.

But these contracts for timber are in fact

authorized by statute.

The 1910 statute specifically authorizes!

the Secretary to make them, to sell the timber, or to approve,

29

technically to approve the sale by the allottee.
the 1910 Act certainly

Therefore

superseded the General Allotment Act’s

ban on any contracts.
But to pick up with the Capoeman case again, in that
case you held that the language of the General Allotment Act
created an undertaking to hold, hold for the Indian, his
allotment, and that it could not be diminished by taxes during
the trust period, and I would ask you if you hold that the
trust allotment cannot be diminished by taxes during the trust
period, does it not follow that it should not be diminished by
waste by the trustee during the trust period?
The intent of Congress certainly had to be the same
in both cases that would diminish the value of the allotment.
The government has argued that the General Allotment
Act did not contemplate a complex timber management operation.
Perhaps it did not.

We don't have to get into that because the

only question here is whether there is jurisdiction and the
cause of action for breach of trust.
The scope of that trust, whether it be broad or nar­
row, remains for further litigation.
QUESTION:

But if the General Allotment Act contem­

plated only a skeletal type of trust to protect the Indians
from improvident conveyances, and specified within it its own
remedy, then that would have a bearing on the outcome of this
case?

29

MR. HOBBS:

Well, it might, but the 1910 Act expanded

the General Allotment Act by permitting timber sales, and that
is what we have here:

Timber sales.

We have congressionally

authorized timber sales done under a trust arrangement created
by the General Allotment Act.
QUESTION:

But then you're saying that it's the 1910

Act you're relying on, not the General Allotment Act, because
you say you don't have to get into the question of whether the
General Allotment Act contemplated an elaborate timber manage­
ment program?
MR. HOBBS:

That's right.

We do not have to get into

that because the only question today is whether there is a
cause of action for damages for breach of trust.

It is not how

wide or narrow the General Allotment Act trust is.
QUESTION:

Well, then are you relying on the 1910

Act?
MR. HOBBS:

I am citing the 1910 Act to you to show

that when the question does come up of how wide the trust ob­
ligation is, the 1910 Act will help define that.

So indeed

will the 1934 Act which instructs the Secretary to manage the
timber on a sustained yield basis, which he failed to do.
There are many acts, all cited in our brief, which
define the duties of the trustee under the trust relationship,
but those — Justice agrees with this.

Justice says in its

bx*ief as we do that this question is not before you now.

The

30
i

scope of the trust is not before you.
If the General Allotment Act gave only one,, or imposed
only one duty on the United States after litigation, we suppose
we were to find that out, still the question is whether we could
i

sue on the breach of that dutv for damages.

We say sure we can

QUESTION:

What if the General Allotment Act had said

in the, in exactly the same words, imposed a trust on the United
States, and said the exclusive remedy for a breach of this duty
by the United States shall be an action for recision?
MR. HOBBS:

Perhaps that would govern, to the exclu­

sion of an action for damages.
QUESTION:

You have to also --

you say, which said expressly permitted certain kinds of con­
veyances and contracts, with respect to these lands.

QUESTION:

and conveyances, and part of your claims for breach of trust
have nothing to do with a conveyance or a contract.

The contract, I guess vou might

Another thing you have to consider is the very fact

that these timbered allotments were made at all.
the overwhelming

Normally, in

number of cases of Indian allotments they are

farm land, and the Indians expected to raise corn or cattle.
In those cases, the Indian does the work and the government just
helps him and gives him seed and supervises his labor.

But

when the government gave 2,400 Indians 80 acres of timber each, ‘
what are they go?ng to do?

You can’t manage 80 acres of land,
.

an individual Indian can't.

For one thing, you only can harvest;

it once in a lifetime, and when you do, you’re going to need
e<7uipnsnfc that most people don’t have, especially an Indian.
For another thing, 80 acres is hopelessly small as an
area of timber that can be managed,

particularly if it is;

32

located in the middle of a large forest.

If it were an isolated

woodland, there are techniques for management of that.

This is

in the middle of a dense forest, one of the densest forests in
the United States.
The verv allotment of those allotments, the ver/ act
of making

thoseallotments, should have made clear

that the

trust was

going to have to involve some management of timber,

because the Indian could not possiblv do that himself.
QUESTION:
MR. HOBBS:

Are all of the respondents here allottees?;
Thev are allottees or successors of

allottees who have a claim that arose while the land was in
trust status; yes.

MR. HOBBS:

So you don't have to relv on 1505, then?
No, that's correct.

I am still on the auestion of what actually

even though they were the owners of it by the small parcel, thev

fice located, one of them,

The Secretary had a large of­

in Portland, one of them in

Washington, D.C., and another one, later, in Everett,
Washington.

Thev decided when the timber was to be sold$ when

they decided that they would go visit the Indian or communicate

33
■

with him and have him come in and sign a power of atfcornev.
That would authorize the Secretary to do all things necessarv
to manage and sell that timber.
The government then would put out invitations for
bids.

The government would let the contract.

When the con­

tract was let, the government would supervise the contractor.
It had inspectors in the field that inspected the logging;; they
saw to the proper scaling of the timber; they saw to the collec­
tion of money, security deposits from the loggers.
They collected the money; they deducted their 10 per­
cent fee, and they credited the balance to the allottees.

All

the allottee had to do after he signed the power of attorney
was open the envelope with the check.

That's all he had to do

j

with a very complex management scheme involving hundreds of
employees of the Interior Department.
This clearly distinguishes our case from the background,
of either Testan or Eastnort.

We don’t say, of course, that

the rules of those cases don’t apolv; they do, of course.

The

Eastport-Tescan rule says that when you sue the government for
damages, you've got to find outside the Tucker Act some statute
that gives you a right to sue for damages.
has to be express.

Justice says this

I think I heard during oral argument a re­

treat from that, and it may as well be, because the Testan case,
when it comes to Testan's own conclusion, it picks up the
Eastport conclusion, which is in our brief on page 13, which I

34

would like to quote for us»
This is this Court laying down the rule.

"Entitle­

ment to money damages depends upon whether any federal statute
’can fairly be interpreted as mandating compensation bv the
federal government for the damage sustained,’" citing Eastport,
and continuing, "We are not ready to tamoer with these
established principles."
Well, the Eastport case that you approved, of course,
was the rule laid down by the very court and including some of
the very judges that have said that we, in our case, have
jurisdiction.

So the ouestion is whether the language of the

General Allotment Act, which is to say language establishing
a trust, can be fairly mandating as saying that you have a
right of action for damages.
The Court of Claims said yes.
said yes.

The Whiskers case has

Two district courts in California have said yes;

■

they are cited in our brief.
You have said ves in cases that we don’t find sub­
stantially similar --- or, dissimilar.

In Jacobs v. United

States, which was a just compensation case, you upheld juris­
diction under Fifth Amendment taking claim, even though the
Constitution is silent as to any right to sue for damages.

You

said this was part of the self-executing aspect of the;
Constitution.
Well, isn’t this also true of a trust?

If a. trustee

i

35

breaches his trust, isn't it an inherent part of that relation­
ship that he respond in damages?
In United States v. Wickersham, which was another
government employee case, unlike Testan he already had his job
and he was illegally fired from it.

Yet he was held to have

an implied right to go to court and sue for damages for the
back pay during the period he'd been laid off illegally, be­
cause you said that this was a suit for denial of emoluments of
a Civil Service position and that was presumably an implied
fairly mandated cause of action.
QUESTION:

I suppose the Bivens case and last term's

Passman case also help you, don’t thev?
MR. HOBBS:

By holding implied rights of action in

the Constitution?
QUESTION:
MR. HOBBS:

Yes.
Yes, they do.

The Justice Department did

not raise the point and we decided, in view of the enormous
number of points to raise, not to raise it ourselves, but we
did think that they helped us.
QUESTION:

Well, you relied on the other case, which

held that the only jurisdiction was the takings clause of the
Constitution.
MR. HOBBS:
QUESTION:
MR. HOBBS:

Well, the Jacobs case.
Yes.
Yes.

We did rely on that.

16

QUESTION:

And those two cases that I mentioned,

other provisions of the Constitution were held to confer pri­
vate rights of action.
MR. HOBBS:

We also didn’t argue the Cortrcase,

C-o-r-tP because we thought our case was raised sharper issues.
The Cort case was vaguer, less tied down, less nailed down,
had less square corners than our case.
We have a trust agreement here, and we think there­
fore that the very existence of that trust confers a right of
action for damages.

The Secretary would be foolish if he let the Indians run their
own allotments.

It would be a madhouse in the forest," and

they threw them out on the grounds that the Secretary had to
manage this forest as a single unit.
They tried the injunction route and they were thrown
out.
■

QUESTION:

That's a Ninth Circuit case; that's not

a case from this Court, is it?
MR. HOBBS:

No, that's true.

Now, Justice agrejes that some of our claims are
within the Tucker Act, claims for money improperly withheld.
Why is land held by the government with an obligation to turn
it over at the end of the trust period any different from monev
held?
If the Court of Claims has jurisdiction on a money
claim, then why not for a land claim, a land for return of the:
money originally given to the trustee?

Suppose there were a contract between

these Indians and the government and the: obligation of the
government under that contract was to competentlv manage these
forest lands.

Would anyone question that the Court of Claims

38

had jurisdiction over such a claim?

I don’t think so.

What about the fact that the Indians have paid fees
in this case?

fee to pay it for its administrative services.

QUESTION:

Could I enter a few ■— just a moment --

do you think technically this is a jurisdictional issue?

The

way the government puts it, they say the Court of Claims juris­
dictional statute reads right on it, there has been a waiver of
sovereign immunity in the Tucker Act.

The question is one of

statutory construction, whether or not, at the threshold of
the case, whether or not the statute should be construed to per­
mit a cause of action for damages.
Suppose the statute said there was, just said it in
black and white.

And suppose another one said there shouldn't

be, and another one is more arguable.

You at least have a —

know.

That depends on how you read Testan about that.
MR. HOBBS:
QUESTION:

Well —
And I don't know that Testan is any dif­

ferent in that regard than the government's argument here that
the way you construe the statute with respect to whether or not
a cause of action has been granted, you should remember that
you're talking about the scope of sovereign immunity.
But I'm not sure that converts it into a kind of a
jurisdictional question that the normal rules about raising
issues shouldn't apply to.
MR. HOBBS:

Your Honor, I have a second argument that

is just as solid as the first, and I must turn mv attention to
it now.

40

QUESTION:

Go ahead»

MR. HOBBS:

That is the legislative history.

You

cannot read this legislative history of 1505 without concluding
that Congress intended tribes and identifiable groups to have
a cause of action for damages for breach of trust.

You cannot

conclude otherwise.
The question is whether our plaintiffs fit within
the definition of tribe or identifiable group.
Tribe, we have the Quinault Tribe, and as to their
4,000 acres, clearly they're within that.

Whether you call it

a waiver of sovereign immunity or creation of a cause of ac­
tion, that legislative history did both, and no question about
that.
As to identifiable group, these 1,465 plaintiffs are
an identifiable group.

They were so held by the Court of

Claims — well, they were held to be a class by the Court of
Claims, and the Court of Claims has rulings that we think would
make them agree that this is an identifiable group.
If, however, you do not agree that thev are an
identifiable group, then the doctrine of in pari materia must
lead you to conclude that 1491 has to be construed the same way
V

as 1505,

That is what the Court of Claims held in the

Hebah case, cited in our brief, and that is the case upon which
we would rely if we got to that point.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank yon.

Mr. Claiborne, do you have anything further?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LOUIS F. CLAIBORNE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER — REBUTTAL
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Briefly, Mr. Chief Justice.

I simply want to suggest that the proposition now put
forward is a novel one.

In one respect,

this case seems to

be tailored for Indian cases, but we know from the Cherry case
decided by the same court subsequently that this notion that
there is arnenibility to damages for breach of trust is not
limited to Indian cases, and indeed why should it be.

There

I
■

is such a principle.

It will range far and wide and wa invite

|

the Court not to open that door which, if it is opened, it
.

has been open since 1887 and yet it didn’t occur for anyone,
Indian or non-Indian, to put it forward until at the earliest
a decade ago.
QUESTION:
that, is there?

There is nothing terribly unusual about

We recently construed the Sherman Act to in­

clude the type of cause of action that had not been thought of
by anybody since 1881 or 1887, whenever the Act was pas seel.
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Mr. Chief Justice, it happens but it

is unusual to discover a hundred years later that the Tucker
Act, there-available sisae© then- has now for the first time
j/

provided a remedy for breach of trust because it happens

it

night not have — that the allotment in this case was under the

I

42
General Allotment Act.

If it had been made under the vary

treaty of Olympia involved in this case, it would not be a
trust allotment, it would be a restricted allotment and there
would be no technical breach of trust.
QUESTION:

Assuming that a breach of trust on the

theory that the case was brought, what kind of an action kind
of remedy would there be in terras of an accounting?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Mr. Chief Justice, with respect --

of course, my first answer is that there is a prospective
remedy to enjoin the continuation of the breach by the Secretary?
of the Bureau of Indian Affairs or whoever is violating the
statutory duty.
QUESTION:

Where would that be, where would juris

diction for that kind of an action be?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

In the District Court under 5 U.S.C.

702, to review and correct the action of the Administrator in
violating the statute> whether it is called trust or not, it
is mismanagement of the forests, in violation of the statute.
That remedy is plainly available and certainly is today with
the amendment_of..the Administrative Procedure Act.
There may also be a remedy to recoup any monies
wrongfully exacted or wrongfully retained frcan the Indians.
That is an

exception which the Court recognized in Testan

and we concede here may well be available to these plaintiffs
in respect of the claims that the administration fees charged

:

43
by the government ware excessive.

To that extent, it would be

a wrongful retention or exaction which may be recouped, but it
is not damages in the usual sense,
QUESTION:

Would that be restitution?

MR. CLAIBORNE:

It would in effect be restitution.

Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
