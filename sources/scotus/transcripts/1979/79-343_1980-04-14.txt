MRo CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

Mr. Hayes, you may proceed whenever you are ready.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFERY Co HAYES,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MRo HAYES:

1

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Cou:

e

This case involves an appeal from a final judgment,

Id

the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania, which affirmed awards

n

to claimant appellees for facial disfigurement under the

IE

Pennsylvania Workmen's Compensation Act.
The question presented to this Court today is whether

n
u

Pennsylvania may constitutionally award benefits under its

SB

State Workmen's Compensation law for injuries to maritime

IS

workers covered by the Longshoremen's Act as amended in 1972.
The central facts necessary to the resolution of the
question are not in dispute in this Court.

18

Sun Ship is an

employer within the meaning of the Longshoremen's Act.

13
\

m ti

It is

engaged in shipbuilding and ship repair activities at its
facilities adjoining the Delaware River, a navigable water
of the United States.
Each of the claimants at the time of his injury was
employed by Sun Ship and was engaged in maritime employment,

if
either shipbuilding or ship repair and is an employee within the

4

meaning of the Longshoremen's Act.
In addition, each of the appellees were injured upon
the navigable waters of the United States as that term has
been defined in both Sections 3(a)

of the amended Longshore­

men's Act, its coverage provisions; in Section 2(4) which
defines employer.
It is further undisputed that the injuries involved
here fall within the coverage of the Longshoremen's Act.
Every administrative tribunal below and the court below so
!

found and it has never been in question here and, indeed, it
is conceded by appellees in this court.
We submit that the judgment of the Court lie low must
be reversed because, upon analysis of the amendment Longshore­
men's Act, the legislative history to the .19 72 amendments
and consideration of the State's purposes and objectives, it
•

I
3

is evident that the Congress intended co preempt the appli­
cation of State workmen’s compensation laws when it enacted the;
i

1972 amendment to the Longshoremen's Act as those laws might
apply to maritime workers injured upon the navigable waters
of the United States.
t

In addition, to the extent that a review of the
Longshoremen's Act and the Pennsylvania Workmen's Compensation '
Aict reveals both a general and the very instance of this case
specific conflicts with the regulatory scheme determined to
apply by Congress the Pennsylvania Act must yield.

QUESTION:

You. told us that in this case it is

conceded that the respondents were within the coverage of the
federal statute?
ME. IIAYES:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir,
Because of the location of their injuries,

as well as their status.
There might be auestions in some situations, might
there not, as to whether or not the federal statute v/ould
cover?
MR. IIAYES:

Yes, sir.

Mt. Justice Stewart, there

is no auestion that there are auestions about the jurisdiction
QUESTION:

And therefore whatever the line may be

there is going to be a twilight sone, I suppose, isn’t there?
MR. IIAYES:

Tie 11, Your Honor, it is certainly

possible, the concent that there is goina to be an edge in the
federal jurisdiction and there mav be cases which fall close
to that line which nav give occasion to courts to consider
which side of the line and a Davis kind of resolution of those
conflicts might result.
QUESTION:
MR. IIAYES:

Right.
But of course in the course of amending

the Longshoremen’s Act Congress substantially removed those
problems, at least in the context of shipbuilding and ship
repair operations, because it moved the line away from the
water's edge which had been the most troublesome line of all.

«

QUESTION:

HAYES:

There still is a line?
Ves , sir, there is still a line»

There

QUESTION:

And it is not — it won11 always be a

It will not alwavs be a clear line.
And therefore if vou should be correct

workman who is killed honestIv believe that they are under
the coverage of the federal statute.

And if we decide this

case in vour favor and sav the federal statute is exclusive,
and then the T’ederal administrative agenev, upheld by the
Court, said, sorrv, vou are not covered, will the statute of
limitations have run so tar as the State workmen's
comnensation goes?
ME. HAYES:

Your Honor, I think that that is a

question that would have to be addressed to the States, many
of which have equitable principles that operate in other
contexts —

And indeed there is no reason to think

the States would adont anv other rule than what the Benefits
Review Board has adopted for the federal courts and what the
Courts of Appeals have adooted as an annlication of the
statue of limitations principles under the Longshoremen's
act.
QUESTION:

Do all the maritime States purport to

extend coverage that is clearly within the admiralty juris­
diction?
MR. MAYES:

Mo, Your Honor.

In fact I think it is

clear from some of the decisions that are cited in various
briefs that Florida, for example, is a State that plainly does
not purport to extend its remedv to claims under the Longshore­
men ' s Act.
QUESTION:
MR. IIAYES:

Pennsylvania does?
The Pennsylvania statute is a statute

of general application applying to all employers injured within
the Commonwealth.
QUESTION:
MR. HAYES:
QUESTION:

Isn't that the general rule?
Nell, Your Honor —
I mean isn't that the general situation

8
i

2

not the rule .
.

MR. IIAYES:

Well, I think Florida, as I have already

8

indicated expressly limits the Longshoremen's Act as a limited

&

statute and it doesn't apply where the Longshoremen's Act does

e

apply and there are other such statutes in other maritime

6

States which work in a similar wav.

Pennsylvania's does note

in addition you have operating not only the pure admiralty

principle which Johnson

you have a kind of supremacy notion, if you will, that operates

in tandem with the admiralty clause where those cases recognizing

Jensen represents, uniformity, but

moves into the admiralty area uniformity is the rule and, in

addition, the supremacy clauses analysis itself compels the

result, that if Congress has occupied the field that the States

are not free —
QUESTION:

Whether or not Congress has moved in, the

\

\

States, there is a constitutional limit upon the exercise of
State jurisdiction over navigable waters, isn't there?
MR» HAYES:

Yes, sir, there is.

And I think that

that is why the problem of the line that you raised with me
initially is important here, because a system of concurrent

I

jurisdiction necessarily creates two lines.

I

It creates the

constitutional line, the Jensen line, if you will, over which

j

the State remedy cannot extend.

MR. HAYES:

Yes.
And secondly, you have the edge of

QUESTION:
MR. IIAYES:

Sea line.
And I think that there you have two kinds

of jurisdictional disputes that you might have to answer,
perhaps not in any individual case but certainly over the
course of the whole series of cases that are presented to the
Court.
QUESTION:

Mr. Hayes, the Pennsylvania statute I

suppose purports to extend three miles out from shore, doesn't
if?

So it is any place within the Commonwealth„
MR. HAYES:

Yes, Your Honor.

And it purports, indeed,

to extend to injuries that might arise out of contracts of hire
entered into in Pennsylvania.
if you will.

It is a McCarton-type statute,

j

10
It is the post-1972 Longshoremen1s Act which is the
central focus of the analysis, of course.

And there is really

little reason to be overly concerned with the decisions of
this Court and other Federal courts which struggle with the
very difficult questions presented by Congress when it enacted
the 1927 Act and the meaning of the phrases which were read
variously to extend or limit Federal or State jurisdiction.
First of all, it is clear from the totality of
circumstances shown by the language of the statute and the
10

legislative history that Congress has totally occupied the
field of compensation to maritime workers and expressly so to

n

the exclusion of State law.

is

QUESTION:

Now, there is some suggestion that in

some cases there will be a twilight zone or a gray zone.
There is no question in this case about Federal coverage, is
there?
MR, IIAYES:

No, Your Honor, there is no question.

This is not a twilight zone or borderline case.

13

Well, you are really here because of the

20

financial aspects of the case, wholly

apart from all the

MR. HAYES;

That is correct.

It introduces a. level of uncertainty into the
administration of a shipbuilding type of operation which is

The certainty of application of the Federal

Act is going to operate in such a way here as to benefit not

Whereas, if we are -•

if Sun Ship in particular is going to be in the situation of

always having to concern itself with the availability of a

disputes until a jurisdictional issue is resolved specifically
and clearly,because it is clear, I believe, under prior
decisions of this Court and the lower Federal courts that if
the Federal Act applies section 5 by its terms makes that
remedy exclusive.

Act.

25

combined with Section 4, which makes the employer's obligation

ci /i

We have already had reference to Section 5 which when

14

to pay compensation and secure payment of compensation
mandatory, plainly indicates that the Federal scheme operates
exclusively, that is to say in place of any other.
In contrast, the Act contains no language which
indicates an intention to permit State law to operate and
thus the situation posed here is directly opposite to that
presented to the Court in Askew.
QUESTIONs

Indeed

Hasn't our rule been generally that it

requires an affirmative showing by Congress to preempt State
actions rather than just lack of a negative showing?
MR. IIAYES:

Justice Rehnquist, I don't think that

has been the test and I think the Court specifically in City
of Burbank y• Lockheed made it clear that there is not a
requirement that there be an express statement of congressional
intent to preempt.

And in any event we we

[
QUESTION:

That just does not automatically follow
~
from the passage of a lav/.

■

MR. HAYES:

j

No, sir, it does not automatically follow,

that is correct.
QUESTION:

Where do you find that kind of intent

'

here?
MR. IIAYES:
I'

I think. Your Honor, we find that the Act j

has changed substantially in 1972 where you have Congress

j exercising its full admiralty powers in both maritime and

I

in contract.

You find that evidence because what Congress has

\ done is it has not limited the remedy as it had been limited

I|
|j

prior to 1972 to injuries occurring upon the navigable waters

i

In addition. Congress in Section 5 said both before

of the United States.

i

1

That is a situs-oriented test.

■'

s-

| and after 1972 the remedy is exclusive and significantly
i
■ | in 19 72 Congress eliminated the only language that had
I|
U ever existed in the Longshoremen's Act that seemed to permit

I'jb the States
I

to

operate.

QUESTION:

Well, Gilmore and Black used the eliminatio

!ij of that language just to prove exactly the opposite.

IS
MR. IIAYES:

Yes, sir, I understand that they do and

I understand that the proviso, however, I think,and I believe

I
lI

the United States reads it differently in this case as well.

5
p
:■

The proposition though, I think, is equally consistent

the

f

17

eliraination of the proviso is equally consistent with the
notion that Congress intended to preempt State lav; because if

1

the proviso remains —
QUESTION:

i

Well, that is a considerable retreat from

i

saying that it proves it,
MR, HAYES:

Yes , sir, I am simply responding to the

point that you ascribe to Professors Gilmore and Black and
would simply say that I think that it is more likely and is
a better reading of the elimination of the proviso to say that
what that indicates is that Congress is now coming on land
with the longshoremen's remedy in 1972.

And if it leaves

the proviso in place it is coming on land with a remedy where
the States under this Court's decision in Nacirema and in
many decisions before had been viewed as competent to operate.
So if ic comes on land with a proviso I think it is plainly
creating a concurrent remedy.

But it doesn’t come on land

with a proviso, it eliminates the proviso.

And at the same

time it expands the coverage of the Act in such a way to
indicate that it is exercising both its admiralty power in
tort and in contract and it is doing it in an area where
uniformity is the law.

And 1 think that the congressional

intent to preempt the field is demonstrated by the statutory
language alone„

23

QUESTION:
25

'

Well, if Congress intended that can you

suggest any reason why they didn’t say it more clearly or say

18

it at all?

!

MR. HAYES:

£

Well, Your Honor, I think that they were

3

probably relying upon the decisions of this Court which had

4

previously held Section 5 to be exclusive in a situation where

§

the remedy applies and it acts against that background just

©

as the Court found in Parker that Congress in enacting the

7

statute in 1927 was acting against the background of the

S

Jensen line without examining the validity of the Jensen line

i

as such.
Similarly here, even in Davis which is the very case

10

.

upon which appellees rely to create the doctrine of concurrent

11

12

.

13

jurisdiction, you have this Court saying that of course if
Federal coverage were clear the Federal remedy would be

14

exclusive.

"1

the elimination of the State law provides that along with the

IS

affirmative espansion of jurisdiction which this Court has

17

already recognised in both Northeast Terminals and in Pfeiffer

18
19
28

2s
<r>

And I think that in that context Section 5 and.

manifests a congressional intent to occupy the field.
QUESTION:

The reasoning in Davis, that if Federal

jurisdiction were clear the remedy would be exclusive, did that
rely on the notion as in Jensen where you have got admiralty
jurisdiction it has got to be a Federal remedy or did it rely
on the notion that Congress intended it to be exclusive?

=&J

MR. IIAYES:

cite the section 5 but I think either

They simply

19
QUESTION:

After the Calbeck decision you certainly

have Section 5 still reading —- then reading as it still reads
t

and it was then assumed there was an area of overlap.
MR. HAYES:

Well, Your Honor, I don't think — I

agree that it was assumed that there was but I don't think
either Calbeck or Davis compel that result.

First of all,

Calbeck by its own terms says it wasn't addressing the question
of Section 5.

It had no need to, because you were having a

claiming of the Federal remedy.
Secondly, Calbeck to the extent that it is read as
creating concurrent jurisdiction depends upon the proviso and
the continued viability of the maritime exception which prior

\

to Calbeck had been read as being embodied within the proviso,

j

In 1972, the proviso goes and I submit with it any notion
that Calbeck supports concurrent jurisdiction,
I

In addition, Calbeck was modified in another way
9

in .1972 because the holding in Calbeck was that if you are
■i

injured upon the navigable waters of the United States that
you have a Federal remedy.

3
s

In 1972 Congress I think has made

a claim that that even is not necessarily true because you have j

Ij
to also be engaged in maritime activity or meet the status
*

test.

I

And I appreciate that at some point you may run into

the kind of situation where the States are ousted and if it
is not maritime activity that this Court may have to resolve
that question.

But it is surely not presented here.

So Calbeck:
II

20

i

itself was substantially Modified in 1972, both as to its

1

affirmative ground and as to the questions that it must answer,
!

We think that the totalitv of the circumstances

3

i

4

evidenced in the language of the statute in addition to the

§

legislative history manifests congressional intent to adopt a

6

uniform system which a system of concurrent jurisdiction simply

7

is not and cannot be.

3

diction creates the very kind of problem that Congress addressee

9'

here, because as we have already noted there is some limit

Indeed a system of concurrent juris­

to the ability of the States to provide the remedy.

10

Thus,

1

if we take a shipbuilder who spends part of his time in the

m

shops, upon the way, upon the land if you will at Sun Ship,

ra

and part of his day working in a drydock or in a vessel floating

u

in the navigable waters of the United States, if he is injured

m

seaward of the Jensen line concurrent jurisdiction is plainly

10

not available to him.

17

two remedies.

Only the employee injured on land has

We submit that there was no concurrent

.

18

jurisdiction really before 1972 and thus in order to say that
the shipbuilder or the ship repairman who moves both onto and
off of the navigable waters if by fortuitous circumstances he

21

2M
m

is injured on land now has two remedies, that that also runs
counter to the congressional intent providing uniform remedy
because it provides a disparate remedy and there is absolutely

'M

no indication in the legislative history or the statute that

ii

Congress intended to leave the employee injured upon land in

21
1

a better situation than the maritime worker injured upon the

2

water.

3

In addition, the other anomaly that might result if

4

this Court to were hold that a system of concurrent juris­

$

diction exists is that a worker who received an award under

3

a State statute which makes a State remedy exclusive of every
other remedy, for example Texas which is the statute that this

8

Court dealt with in Magnolia Power, may be barred by operation

S'

of a full faith and credit clause of 28 U.S.C. 1738 from,
recovering his longshoremen's remedy.

11

And if the Texas remedy,

as Justice Keith so plainly pointed out in his dissent in the
Johnson case

is a remedy that is a lesser remedy, it does

13

not provide the claimant with the kind of recovery that

14

Congress provided under the Longshoremen's Act, that result

IS

is plainly anomalous and contrary to congressional purpose.

S&

There can be no doubt that the congressional

17

remedy is complete, it covers every aspect’ of the relationship

IS

between the employer and the employee once an injury triggers

19

its application.

2ft

The terms embody a legislative judgment concerning

21

the rights and liabilities of employers and it was that

22

judgment which Congress has made and the States under the

<2»*>

circumstances are not free to modify or interfere with, even

2*4

complement or adjust the congressional judgment as to those

£5

rights and liabilities.

22

This actually makes a great deal of sense when you
think about the problems that the two legislatures, the
Pennsylvania legisature and the Congress, are facing»
Pennsylvania's Act was a statute of general application and
applies to all employment situations in the Commonwealth, while
the Longshoremen's Act is a special statute dealing with
special occupations and embodying Congress' judgment about
hov/ such injuries should be compensated.

And this is an area

in which Congress has been found particularly competent to
operate and where it does affirmatively operate, uniform effect
is given to its statutory enactment.
Pennsylvania, on the other hand, its interest here
in compensating maritime workers is no different than its
interest in compensating employees generally.

It has no

special interest in this case and, indeed, the Workmen's
Compensation Appeal Board advised this Court through its
clerk when asked whether it wanted to submit a motion to
affirm or dismiss under Rule 16 that Pennsylvania had no
interest adverse to that of the appellant, no interest adverse
to that of Sun Ship.

S

So this is not a situation where you have a State
here claiming some special interest or right which again
distinguishes the situation from Askew.
Finally, the Acts when put together and as you look
at them from provision to provision there

are plain conflicts.

23

Because the workmen’s compensation statute is and
represents an entire balancing of the rights and remedies and
liabilities and obligations of the parties you cannot really

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH LURIE, ESQ.,

SO

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. LURIE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
The Workmen’s Compensation Act is not administered
14

by any State, it is not administered by the Federal Government,
the; longshoremen harbor workers compensation.

13

Every State’s

workmen's compensation Act, perhaps except Ohio which they
have a State system, as well as the Longshoremen Harbor Workers

13

IS

Act is administered by the employer.

The person is hurt, the

IS I employer has a duty to file notice of injury under Pennsylvania
i
aol SI under the Federal law and starts to make payments. It is
tj;

the employer at the outset who makes that election.
A fraction — I think the National Safety Council
and the U.S. Department of Labor Bureau of I.abor Standards
reports there are some 2 million time less accident cases
♦

28

reported each year in the United States.

And a fraction of

25
them result in contested workmen's compensation claims.

Most

of the claims are paid as a matter of course because the
employer recognizes their injury and they are paid.

Very few

are in dispute.
The significance of this of course is that the
injured worker makes — unless he consults a lawyer, unless
something happens to his claim, unless he doesn't get
P

compensation, unless compensation payments stop, does not

& !

consult a lawyer and therefore he himself exercise no choice.

1©

This case as a matter of fact where Sun Ship comes
in and tells us what a beneficent employer they are, when
these five men were injured Sun Ship never reported this as a

work-related injury.

men are covered.

office and we filed claims under the State law, we filed

'

I
go

I

claims under the State lav; because (1) State law in Pennsylvania,
on a disfigurement case takes about 6 to 8 weeks for an
adjudication.

Under federal, it is between 18 months and two

years because we go through the informal proceedings before

24 j the Deputy Commissioner determines the case is settled and

I;

if it is not settled it then goes co an administrative lav;

26

i

judge and we wait for the full hearing and findings of fact and

2

conclusions of law and the testimony is taken and the average

3

has been somewhere between 18 months and 2 years for a hearing.

4

And of course in these cases the awards were somewhere between

5

$500 and maybe $1,500 per man but conceptually, because

G

Pennsylvania has a higher limit in disfigurement cases, a

•y

smaller type of disfigurement is going to warrant more money

8

than Under Federal lav? where you have $3,500 as a maximum.
Now, it seems to me that this Court is bound by

9
10

Davis, it is bound by Calbeck.

In Davis the exact issue was

presented.

And unless you have concurrent jurisdiction you are going to

as to where he should go, you are going to have him adversely
being affected by a long delay in getting his benefits, and

27

are you are going to have him adversely be affected by the
expense in long court proceedings to determine v/hat lav; applies j
And I say this because of the fact that if we make either

State law exclusive or Federal lav; exclusive what that means

is that when a case suggests exclusivisity of either State law

or Federal lav; the employer is going to raise that as a
defense.

When these men were injured Sun Ship figured that

No, they did come to a lawyer.
They didn’t come to you.

They came to you after, didn’t they?
No, sir.

What happened

let me explain.

because they had a facial scar and were unaware of the law that

they would never file claims and that it would stay and it

would gc away.

are concerned, were silent.

M

compensation payable or the notice of injury with the Deputy

Therefore, Sun Ship, which was the administrator

They did not file the notice of

I

m

Nov:, just to back track a little, what happens is

j

17

an employer is duty bound under the Act to file notice of injuryj

113

with the Deputy Commissioner’s office who is charged with

rS *»

Congress to administer the Longshoremen Harbor Workers Act,

20

when they file that notice then the Deputy Commissioner's

2!

office sends a letter to the injured person telling them that

they have a right under the Longshoremen Harbor Workers Act
and contact us, establish relationship with our office and we

will tell you how to get your rxgnts.
Now, that didn't happen in this case, Sun Ship did

i
i

i

29

not file this notice.

Later when these men had these scars

they contacted our office and said, can I get paid for this
facial disfigurement.

As a lawyer I felt they could get paid

under the Federal Act or the State Act since there was
concurrent overlapping jurisdiction.

And we proceeded under

the State law because it was easier to get the benefits.
Absolutely no proceeding has ever been instituted
by the shipyard in the federal court to pay them —- in the

So that

is why we are here, because what Sun Ship is saying —- it is
not money, quite frankly, I think the — Justice —
QUESTION:
MR. LURIE:

If it is not money, what is it?
Well, I think what we are talking about

is — in a short range it is money but in the long range it is

{

*

rather the principle that there is going to be substantial
delays and uncertainty if jurisdiction is exclusive.

The
j

I
Workmen's Compensation Act does not apply.

For example,

they

raise the McCarton doctrine of full and complete concurrent
jurisdiction.

Nov;, that is not involved in ny case, because
I

in this case here these men have not accepted any benefits under;

Federal law.

But most certainly workmen's compensation lav/ is not

a final judgment.

5

case, that judgment could be modified under Section 22 or that

order could be modified up to a year later.

For example., if an order is made by an

QUESTION:

But until it is, under Magnolia it is a

&

1

final judgment, isn't it?

9

MR. LURIE:

I don't really think it should work like

10

that, because for example conversely the modification order

1?

under Pennsylvania could come ten years after the decision.
QUESTION:

Under the Federal Act the modification

m

could come only within one year, you say Pennsylvania could

15

allow it to continue.,
MR. LURIE:

a•i «.-/

Right, that is the compensation benefits

IS'

might be suspended and no benefits are paid.

O'

ten years in which to reopen the claim, so he could come in

13'

with new facts, etc. to review anywhere from 3 to 1C years

13

after the judgment is final.

MR. LURIE:

But Magnolia Petroleum held that a

workmen’s compensation judgment was a final judgment for
purposes of —
MR. LURIE:
ignored it.

Well, I think in Calbeck the Court just

For example, if you read the last page of Calbeck

QUESTION:
MR. LURIE:

What page are you referring to?
Page .131, they are talking about binding

elections, they cite with approval at the bottom of page 131
and 132, or the Court cites their approval of three Federal
Circuit Court cases which held that full faith and credit does
not apply to orders of the workmen's compensation —
QUESTION:

But Magnolia is a case from this Court,

not from a Court of Appeals„
MR. LURIE.

I am suggesting by inference, sir, that

in Calbeck this Court has sort of ignored Magnolia and said,
v;e don’t think — for example, one of the people in Calbeck
did receive State benefits under an order.

So consequently

what this Court has done is cited with approval the three
Circuit Court cases which appear there

where the Circuit

Courts ruled that obtaining a State order does not bar
Federal coverage.
QUESTION:

Do you think you could proceed under both

Acts for the same injury at the same time?

MR. LURIE:

21

QUESTION:

22

<!>£*•

*■

MR. LURIE:

No, he couldn't get it.
Why not? why not?
Because under the Federal law the cases

2&

have held that attorney's fees could not be paid for issues

2i

of law which simply involve attorney's fees.

The Benefits

\

33
!

Review Board has held that if the only issue is an attorney's

Z

fee, we are not going to pay attorney's fees if that is the

3

only issue.
I think, for example, I see nothing wrong if this

5

man made $1,000 a week, for example, and was stuck with

8

and Pennsylvania or some other State pays less than the
$300-some-odd which is the State maximum, for example
Pennsylvania pays $242, and then realize that if he went, to

Federal, he could get $376 I think is the maximum or somewhere
thereabout, and then was; indeed covered under Calbeck and

then I think that most certainly he should be entitled

to collect under Federal and also perhaps collect counsel

paid twice.
QUESTION:
MR. LURIE:

But the employer has to litigate twice?
Well, not usually, because — what I am

saying is that if this Court comes down in its decision the way
hope it will, the employer will certainly get the message that
since there Ls full concurrent jurisdiction and since he has
2i

been paid under State, they put him voluntarily under State,

I
34
i

and if there is full concurrent jurisdiction, then the employer

2

isn’t going to litigate twice, he is going to say, well, since

3

there — or an honest and intelligent employer is going to

4

say since there is full concurrent jurisdiction my injured
8

5

worker should get the maximum benefit under whichever juris-

6

diction applies, because otherwise you are going to have the

7

employer saying well, I will put this guy under Pennsylvania

8

because the maximum is less than the Federal.

§

would agree that the Workmen’s Compensation Acts are indeed
administered by the employer.

in the United States every year.

84
m

I

j

I think everyone

m

83

j

There can’t be any other way

I would just like to address myself to a couple of
poin ts.
Sun Ship argues change of the — by the 1972 law

13

and the only change that we could find cf any significance is

17

the deletion in Section 3(a) of that provision that said if

C$

recovery may not validly be provided by State law.

19

7ive States or so which have considered this issue plus the

29

Fourth Circuit have agreed with the interpretation that this

2!

Court in Calfceck in eliminating that language.

And the

And by

eliminating that, language, perhaps it wasn’t as clear what the
m

Court meant.

The dissenting opinion said that Calbeck

£4

eliminated this problem of exciusivicity because what it did

23

is say that there is an area, there is a solid wall here and

j

35

if the State law applies then you can’t have a Federal right.
And what Calbeck did is it just had the overlap concept out
of Davis, and said well, if there is a Federal la\/, if there
is a State law, then we have concurrent jurisdiction.
the Congress did what Calbeck did, it eliminated it.

Now,
And I

don't see how the appellee could argue --- the appellant could
argue that by eliminating this ic made jurisdiction exclusive.
Because the only area in the law where we could or would deal
with this question of jurisdiction is under the situs provision
of Section 3(a).
with Calbeck.

And in that what they did was Congress agreed

Nov/, Mr. Ilayes said, well, the Court didn’t

say what they really said in Calbeck.

Well, sometimes it is

hard to read opinions of the Supreme Court.

But most certainly

the dissent said that, it did it, it took it out.
it took it out.

Larsen said

Gilmore-Black said it took it out.

So to the extent that the congressmen may not have
read the actual decision, they read what others said about it
and what others said about it v/as that we have full concurrent
jurisdiction because we have eliminated the State and Federal
barrier.

And that is what I think happened.
They argue that Section 5 is exclusive and therefore

precludes a workmen's compensation remedy other than the
Federal remedy.

Well, all States have this Section 5.

And

Section 5 v/as the price the injured worker paid for workmen's
compensation, is that he gave up his common lav/ action against

35

f
i

his employer to receive benefits.

As a ratter of fact these
|

five men could have brought common lav; actions against Sim
Ship if they wanted to, because if we read the exclusivicii;y
13
part of Section 5(a) it says it is exclusive HLS but they say
except if an employer fails to secure payment of compensation
as required by this chapter, which Sun Ship did in this case,
s1
an injured employee or his legal representative in case death

I
results from the injury may elect to claim compensation under
|

this chapter or what are they giving us, what are they giving
I
the injured worker they took away or to maintain an action in
I

|
law or admiralty for damages on account of such injury or
death„
'

j
So that is what Congress has taken away by

exclusivity .

It is that right fcc maintain that action in law

or the action in admiralty.

They made no thought nor mention

of State workmen's compensation law and that is why in Davis
the Court said it doesn't apply, 5(a)

doesn't apply; and, indeed*,
\

it does not apply.
I
The issue is framed by the appellant in its brief as
it appears on page 6.

It is a very simple issue which this

\

I
|
1

Court amply answered in the Askew case.

Askew was a

I
s

unanimous opinion by the Court and starting on page 37 and
continuing is an extremely eloquent and intelligent discussion

t
I
i

l

deciding the issue in this case.
-

And Sun Ship says the issue is whether the

r,

37
Pennsylvania Workmen's Compensation Act is repugnant to the

supremacy clause of the admiralty clause when it is applied

8

to permit the exercise of jurisdiction by Pennsylvania over

the issue was whether a State constitutionally may exercise

MR. LURIE:

Wel.1, I would suggest that the history

of Section 3(a) unde’: the 1972 Act which I just mentioned is
---- you could get no other interpretation that Congress in
1972 realized what Davis said, what Calbeck said and therefore

;

eliminated from the Act language that would give State courts
exclusive remedy where you have an injury which occurred within
the twilight zone.

MR. LURIE:
QUESTION:
MR. LURIE:

They -- who, the Congress?
Yes.
Well, I would suggest that in 1962 this

Court came down with Calbeck and Congress took no action from
1962 to 1972 to say, wait a minute, Supreme Court, you were
wrong in Calbeck.
And certainly since 1972 State Supreme Courts have
been coming down

ince 1976 interpreting Calbeck and the *72

amendments to mean what the appeJ lees say they mean in this
case,and Congress has again remained silent.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
further, Mr. Hayes?

Do you have anything

You have just one minute left.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF TEFFERY C, HAYES, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF T1IE APPELLANT
MR. HAYES:

Again, I woild just like to respond very

briefly to what I think are irrelevant facts but nonetheless
wholly inaccurately stated by counsel for appellee.

The fact

of the matter is three of the claimants in this case, Messrs.
Fields, Janu2ciev7icz and Moore filed claims for compensation
under the Longshoremen’s Act.

In point of facts the records

of the U.S. Department of Labor will reveal that Sun Ship,
then Sun

Shipbuilding & Drydock Company, filed first reports

of injury in the case of Mr. Fields and in the case of Mr.
Moore and in the case of Mr. Moore long before he. filed his
Federal claim.

And all of the Federal claims —

QUESTION:
MR. HAYES:

Is that in this record?
No, Your Honor, I am sorry it is inot in

this record but I don't think the facts are relevant and in
either event, I could not let the statements go uncorrected.
Secondly, with respect to the elimination of the
nroviso, whatever Calbeck meant or didn’t mean Congress was
absolutely clear in 1972, because it adverted specifically
to the deletion of the proviso and whatever and whatever it
thought it meant. And that is in the section by section review
of the bill amendments.
Thank you.
QUESTION:

Mr. Lurie stated that your client had

failed to secure payments of compensation as required by the
Federal law and that therefore his clients could have at their
option pursued you at common lav/ or at admiralty law.

Is that

correct, factually?
MR. HAYES:

Securing a payment simply means making

42

provision for payment of award if compensation is payable.

,
I

i

No compensation was payable under this Act, either voluntarily
or pursuant to an award.

Sun Ship has secured payment for

all compensation claims through its self-insurance system
and that is what the Section 5 reference means„
QUESTION:

I see.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:
case is submitted.

Thank you, gentlemen.
