PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 78—l8i5, Andrus v, Shell Oil Company.
Mr. Wallace, you may proceed whenever you are
readyo
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MRo WALLACE:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case presents the question of whether claims
to oil shale on federal lands made some sixty or more years
ago under the mineral laws, the mining laws I should say,
pardon me, of 1870 and 1872 are valid and entitle the
claimant

successors

an

interest

to patents under those laws

conveying title to these public lands to them.
Such unpatented oil shale claims are outstanding
on an estimated five million acres of public lands in
Colorado, Utah and Wyoming.

All of the claims date from

before February 25, 1920, which was the date of enactment
of the Mineral Leasing Act ’which withdrew oil shale and
other specified minerals from further location under the
rninin laws and provided for future access to these minerals
only by leasing with the title to the lands remaining in
the United States.
The law was part of the conservation movement

4
designed for ptoection of the public domain from what
Congress considered to be unwarranted alienation by claims
to widespread minerals specified in the act,
The particular claims at issue here date from
1917 and 1918, in the

period this Court has characterized

in Hickel v. Oil Shale Company is one of speculative fever
in oil shale claims»

And the precise question involved is

whether the precise claims are invalid because of the
failure of Oil Shale to meet the requirement of the mining
law of discovery of a valuable mineral deposit.
In this case, the Administrative Law Judge, the
Interior Board of Land Appeals, the District Court and the
Court of Appeals all agreed that the claim did not meet
the traditional discovery standard under the mining laws.
QUESTION:
here?

Well, do you think that is an issue

Isn’t that one of the issues?
MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

The issue tested

So initially we must decide what

how are the mining laws to be construed insofar as dis­
covery is concerned.
MR. WALLACE:

Well, this is far from a novel

question in this Court, Mr. Justice White, and —QUESTION:

Well, it was a novel question in the

Interior Department until recently.
MR. WALLACE:

Well, I can’t agree with that

5
proposition either.
QUESTION:

Well, It had been decided forty years

QUESTION:

Certainly, Freeman v. Summers treat it

ago.

differently than you do.
QUESTION:

But this is a different issue.

MR. WALLACE:

It treated it differently than other

decisions of both the Interior Department and of this Court,
which is what I wish to turn to
QUESTION:

That is of course the big issue, but

as I understand it, what you were talking about with my
brother White was this, that your opponent, despite all the
findings to the contrary, argues that under the traditional
normal criteria of valuable discovery, these discovery meet
those criteria.
MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

So that is an issue in this case.

MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

That argument ---

That is an issue —

And If that is true, if he is correct,

then that Is the end of the case, you don’t get into anything
else, do you?
MR. WALLACE:

Well, that is correct, although our

submission is that it Is not correct.
be dispositive of the ea.se.
QUESTION:

Right.

Of course, that would

6
MRo WALLACE:
is mixed

up

But that is a factual issue but it

with an issue of law which 1 think has long

been settled and let me turn to the considerations that bear
on that and that bear on other aspects of the case as well.
The basis for the holdinp’ of the four tribunals
below is set forth on page 2h of our brief.

Arid on page 25

— I am turning myself to page 2k, the Administrative Law
Judge based his holding on this aspect, if I may just read
the bottom part of the quoted portion:

"Until a research

program had demonstrated that shale oil could be produced
at a cost competitive with petroleum, no prudent person
would attempt to develop an oil shale mine.
no market for his product.

He would have

The very fact that, in the

more than half a century of interest in oil shale claims
of the Green River Formation, not one profitable mine has
been developed is a compelling reason for concluding that
expenditure of money to that end would be imprudent."

And

Indeed the Board of Appeals pointed out that no profitable
operation of any kind from oil shale has been developed in
this country in a hundred years.
QUESTION:

Would you concede that the Interior

Department has changed its position over the years?
MR. WALLACE:

It concluded in these very eases

that Freeman v. Summers was incorrect and it changes its
position in these eases.

7
QUESTION:

Do you think it ha3 the same latitude

as we have held the NLRB has to change its position, or do
you think it is bound to simply interpret the law?
MR. WALLACE:

Well, it can only change its posi­

tion in interpretation of the law, but as I am about to
demonstrate to the Court, if I may, Freeman v. Summers was
inconsistent with prior decisions of this Court construing
the very law that Interior misconstrued in Freeman v.
Summers.

And if I can proceed to shotf that, I then would

submit that the Interior Department had no choice but to
conform its practices to this Court's interpretation of
the mining law, that law has not been changed by Congress
and this Court has not overruled, indeed it has reaffirmed
those interpretations.

So this is not really a question of

the Interior Department's discretion to change its own in­
terpretation of the law, it is really a matter of conform­
ing its interpretation to this Court’s authoritative in­
terpretation.
QUESTION:

But in so doing it did' change its own

interpretation?
MR, WALLACE:

It certainly did.

It corrected

its error.
QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, just so I am sure I

follow it as you get into the statutory argument, the ulti­
mate question, is it not, is whether or not these were

8
"valuable mineral deposits" within the meaning of section 1
of the 1872 statute?
MR. WALLACE:

That is correct, Mr. Justice, and

that —
QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, don't I recall that some­

times here we have approved an administrative reading and
then some years later approved a quite contrary one?
MR. WALLACE:

It can happen within an area of an

agency's discretion to construe terms of a statute 'which
can fairly be construed in different ways.
QUESTION:

Well, you don't think for example we

would be free to having perhaps construed the law differ­
ently than Freeman did, to later say Freeman was correctly
decided?
MR. WALLACE:

Well, the difficulty is that

Freeman never purported to apply a different standard to
anything but oil shale and the Interior Department over the
years adhered to this Court's interpretation of the mining
laws for all other minerals and there is no statutory basis
for treating oil shale differently from other minerals.
There is no arguable interpretation of the statute that can
support this disparity in administrative practice that the
department has now corrected.
The customary standard has been articulated in a
number of this Court’s modern decisions as reflecting a

9
determination by Congress that public lands would be virtu­
ally free for the taking by private interests under the
raining laws in return for the discovery of a commercially
valuable mineral deposit that can enure to the public
benefit by being introduced into the economy, and for that
reason the profitability and marketability of a mining claim
to exploit that resources has been the consistent standard*
Rather than refer to the more familiar recent decisions, I
would like, if I may, to turn to some of the earlier de­
cisions in which this standard was established.
One that we have cited in our brief is Cameron v.
United States, 252 U.S., 'which was decided in 1920, less
than two months after the enactment of the Mineral Leasing
Act, and there a unanimous opinion written by Mr. Justice
Vander,

whom the Court later recognized as having

unique knowledge in this field, the Court articulated the
meaning of a valuable mineral discovery in much the terms
that the modern cases do.
And if I may support from page ^59•

"To support

a mining location, discovery should be such as would
justify a person of ordinary prudence in the further ex­
penditure of his time and means in an effort to develop a
paying mine."

And then quite significantly this is not a

novel or mistaken test but is one which the land department
long has applied and this Court has approved, citing

10

Christman v. Miller, 197 U.S., a 1905 decision of this
Court and also a unanimous decision.
The particular page reference in Christman v0
Miller — and this is also a case that is cited in
brief, it is in 197 U,S. -— is page 322 which quoted with
approval the classic statement reproduced on page 19 of
our brief of the Interior Department in Castle v. Womble
of the standard which is largely along the same lines as
set forth on page 19 of our brief.

But of perhaps even

greater pertinence to the particular question before us
now is the precise holding of Christman v. Miller, and I
would like to quote two sentences from the concluding para­
graph of this Court’s opinion there, page 323 of 197 U.S.
Referring to the claimant whose claims were rejected below
and the judgment rejecting those claims was being affirmed,
there was not. enough in what he claims to have seen to
have justified a prudent person in the expenditure of money
and labor in exploitation for petroleum.

It merely sug­

gested a possibility that the ground contained oil sufficient
to make it chiefly valuable therefore, and that was not
enough under the mining law.
Mow, if we turn from that to the Interior Depart­
ment’s opinion in 1?27, 22 years later, in Freeman v.
Summers, and this is on page 6? of the appendix in the case,
I would like to call the Court’s attention to the next to

11
the last paragraph of that opinion in which the rationale
used by the Interior Department was precisely the rationale
that this Court rejected in interpreting the same law in
the Christman case:

'There can be no question whatever as to

the greater valuable the lands for their oil shale deposits
than for other purposes.

Their agricultural value is negli­

gible; their value for grazing purposes is nominal* and the
real and principal value is the mineral deposits*" precisely
what this Court held not to qualify as a basis for upholding
a claim to a valuable mineral deposit under the mining law.
In retrospect, what started out in the early
twenties s when the Interior Department first began, patenting
oil shale claims as predominantly in the state of fact that
oil shale might be then meeting the standard under the
mining law as interpreted in this Court's cases, because of
optimistic predictions of the imnienee of marketability of
oil shale., it started off in the initial patents as pre­
dominantly a mistake of fact and we noted incidentally in
our brief on page 29 that the instructions of the Secretary
under which these initial patents were granted did not say
that oil shale could proceed to patent under any different
standards and indeed said that the same standards must be
applied.
QUESTION:

Can a patent when it is finally issued

be set aside for mistake of fact?

12
MR. WALLACE:
years.

It can be set aside only for six

There is a. statute of limitations, Mr. Justice»

In the absence of raud, the six-year statute of limitations
would be binding.

And since no patents have been issued

since i960s none of them would now be subject to being set
aside.

"7QUESTION:

So if these had actually been patented

rather than just unpatented locations, they could not be
set aside?
MR. WALLACE:

That is correct, so long as there

was no fraud in failure to disclose.
QUESTION":

And that would be patents if any that

issued between 195^ and i960?
MR. WALLACE:
so»

I am not aware of any effort to do

It was not until 197^ that the Board of Land Appeals

reversed the judgment of the Administrative Law Judge in
this case.

He said he was bound by Freeman v. Summers even

though he thought the case was poorly conceived and that
the established standards under the mining law would not
support the issuance of a patent here»
QUESTION:
Freeman v. Summers.

May I ask you one other question about
The briefs indicate that in the case

there were draft opinions back and forth and the issue was
actually fought out before the opinion was released, ap­
parently some subordinates in the department thought the

decision should have gone the other way.

Does the record

tell us whether the decision In Christiaan v. Miller was
called to anyone’s attention and considered before the
decision was made?
MR. WALLACE:
that.

I am not aware that it does show

It does show that the Solicitor in the department

and all of his subordinates refused to draft the opinion
because they thought that it was reflecting an incorrect
standard.
The point I was just making was that what started
off in the early twenties as what seems to me in retrospect
to be a predominantly mistake °? fact was then perpetuated
as an administrative practice through what is clearly a
mistake of law in applying a standard that is contradic­
tory to this Court’s reading of the mining law to oil shale
without any basis in the statute for singling out oil shale
for different treatment.
So the background against which any action
Congress has subsequently taken is to be judged at most as
an element of ambiguity introduced by the administrative
practice that coexisted with this Court’s decisions looking
the other way as to what the governing legal standard x^as
under the mining law long before any of the developments
with respect to oil shale that are put in issue here»
QUESTION:

But the Interior Department’s view was

ll»
expressed openly immediately after the passage in 1920,
wasn't it9 by a set of instructions?
MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

There were instructions that —

Which purported to be a construction of

what the law required„
MR. WALLACE:

Yes, but the instructions did not

make a mistake of law.

They noted that there was a great

deal of development with respect to oil shale, a great deal
of interest in it and said, as we quote on the top of page
29 of our brief, that the same legal standard should be
applied.

And under those instructions, the functionaries

in the department then began issuing patents on oil shale
which in retrospect, as I have said, looks like a mistake
of fact but not a mistake of law predominantly.

These

things emerge with greater clarity in retrospect perhaps
t han at the time 6
But I would say that when the basis for1 the
mistake in fact, the mistake of fact began to dissipate,
rather than change the practice, the practice was perpetu­
ated in Freeman v. Summers by a mistake of law, adopted
by the Assistant Secretary over the objection of the
Solicitor's office.
So it isn’t really accurate in our submission to
judge any subsequent action has taken as if it were taken
against a background of settled law in favor of these oil

15
shale claims as qualifying under the mining lav/ when this
Court’s decisions looked the other way in construing the
language of the act and the legal standard to be applied.
QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, on a factual aspect, you

start out I think indicating five million acres were subject
to claims that were during this time pei^iod.
MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

That is an estimate.

An estimate.

Does that include those

that went to patent or just those that are not?
MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

How large is it?

MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

Not in patent.

3-495000 acres have been patented.

The acreage patent was 349,000.

MR. WALLACE:

Yes, Mr. Justice.

Nov/, in the actions that Congress has taken that
were relied upon by the courts below and by the respondents
as in some method having amended the standard of the mining
lav; and setting a unique standard for oil shale, as the two
courts below specified, the principal reliance is now
placed, as I read respondent’s brief, on the savings-pro­
vision of the mining lav; of 1920.
QUESTION:

Can I ask you a question, Mr. Wallace,

before you get to that point.

You say that the decision

in Freeman v« Summers is contrary to Justice Vender7s
opinion in Cameron v. United States, and you quoted the

16
language of Justice Vander in Cameron saying that justify­
ing the expenditure of his time and means in an effort to
develop a paying mine, and in Freeman v. Summers it says it
doesn't have to be immediately disposed of at a profit.
Doesn't "develop a paying mine" mean that there may be some
period where you are not going to make a profit which will
be ultimately be amortized by the sale of something that
does become valuable?
MR. WALLACE:

Well, there is some play in the

question of imminence in the profitability of the mine, but
the consistent course of interpretation has been that it
has to be imminent rather than speculative.
QUESTION:

I assume that wasn't the Court's inter­

pretation in Freeman v. Summer’s.
MR. WALLACE:

No, it wasn't, but Freeman v.

Summers in our submission:

an aberration from the Womble

standard which was the predominant view approved by the
Court over and over again, expenditure of labor and means
with a reasonable prospect of success in developing a
valuable mine.

Certainly no formulation that had ever

been made contemplated holding of fallow claims and deal­
ing in them for a period of more than sixty years while
nothing could be returned to the public and then valud
claims could be made for alienation of a large acreage of
the public domains on the basis cf that kind of holding.

17
I don't think there is any formulation which would look
toward that kind of speculative interest.

It is precisely

what this Court said in Coleman was not authorised under
the mining law.

I would like to make one basic point about the
reading that is proposed of the savings clause in the
Mineral Leasing Act, and that is the implausibility of that
reading as a matter of the common sense of what Congress
was doing.
The basic purpose of the Mineral Leasing Act was
to put an end to alienation of the public lands through
mining claims based on some of the more widespread mineral
resources which it appeared would result in very widespread
alienation of the public lands beyond what could be ex­
ploited in the near future because the minerals were so
«

widespread.

The ones that were singled out in that law,

oil shale, coal, oil phosphate, were ones that were thought
to exist in such great quantity as to endanger wholesale
alienation of the public lands beyond the purposes for
the original mining law of giving people a way to get title
in return for commercial exploitation of valuable mineral
resources.
There had to be some savings provision as Congress
developed the law both because of Fifth Amendment problems
with whatever rights people had in their claims under the

18
old mining law and to prevent unfairness»

But it obviously

would be contrary to the whole purpose of the legislation
to read into the savings provision an intent to make
further alienation of the public lands possible through
claims on oil shale than had been authorised by the prior
law when the whole purpose of the act was to curtail alien™
ations of the public lands through such claims.

It was

dissatisfaction with the old system and the possibility
that these wholesale alienations would occur through
claims on the specified minerals that led to the passage
of the act in the first place.
So it would take a compelling; indication in the
language or history of the statute to conclude that the
savings clause should be interpreted at cross purposes
with the basic thrust of the legislation and the thing
/

that moved Congress to enact it.

And far from that we

f

have, as this Court recognized in the Hickel case, a
carefully drafted provision in the savings clause that
refers to the standards of the mining law having to be
met.
The two subsequent developments in Congress
referred to did not result in, in one case in any legis­
lation and in the other case in anything that could con­
ceivably be construed as affecting the standard of dis­
covery because it was devoted to a discrete matter.

19

I would like to reserve the balance Of my time,
if I may.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Hamilton, you may proceed whenever* you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF FOWLER HAMILTON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OP THE RESPONDENT
MR. HAMILTON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may It

please the Court:
After a few preliminary observations by way of
background, my discussion will present the law and the
facts insofar as they relate to six points that in our
view are relevant to the consideration of the case,

The

first will have to do with the problem that Congress and
the Executive Branch faced in when in 1916 they discovered
in consequence of work of the Geological Survey beginning
in 1901 and extending down to 1916 that therey lay in the
Green River Formation, which Is located predominantly In
northwestern Colorado but extends into Wyoming and Utah,
the largest, richest reserve of energy in the world, and
it still is the largest, richest reserve of energy in the
world, holding according to the record in this case in the
aggregate in oil of a richness, in shale of a richness of
30 gallons per ton and a thickness of 15 feet, a grand

20
total of 580 to 6-00 billion barrels of oil and having in
its reserves capable of now being produced with mining and
recording and refining methods now available an immediately
available reserve, economics to one side, of 80 billion
barrels of oil, which is three times the total reserves of
the United States approximately, and larger than the total
amount of oil that has been consumed in the United States
since oil was discovered in 1859 in Titusville, Pennsylvania.
The second preliminary matter I should like to
bring to your attention is that there is no disputed fact
in this case which is not unusual in view of the circum­
stance that the hearings lasted over five months in
Colorado, from June of 1967 until October of 1967, pro­
duced a transcript of 5,000 pages and more than 700 ex­
hibits, and I think it is fair to say is one of the most
extensive hearings ever held under the mining laws*
Further, it is undisputed that the six claims
involved in these proceedings, each of l60 acres, or a
total of 960 acres minus a small fraction of a claim that
was found not to contain shale, are physicali indistin­
guishable from the 3^9 acres of oil shale claims that
were patented during the forty yeasr from 1920 until 1961°
It is also conceded, I believe, that there is
no other known firmity in these claims if oil shale is a
patentable mineral.

Indeed, inspectors of the department

21
approved all of the claims in this' claim for patenting in
1958 and i960 and all of the formalities have been done,
a certificate had issued, had been sent to Washington for
the pure ministerial act of issuing the patent when the
■

order came down not to issue any more oil shale patents.
Now, before turning, I might here just list the
six points that 1 shall address the Court on:

One, is

the nature of the problem that faced the Congress and the
Executive Branch when they discovered this; secondly, what
they did with the problem, how they solved it; thirdly,
the application of the solution over a period of 41 years;
fourth, the four principles that the attempt of the Depart­
ment of the Interior to abolish that solution; fifth, the
four independent alternative reasons we advance that pro­
hibit the department from abolishing that solution; and,
sixth, the immense benefits to the public that have re­
sulted from the application of that solution.
But before doing that, I should like to respond
to a point made by my opponent in response to a question
from Mr. -Justice Stevens.

There is in a footnote in the

case to which Your Honor referred the statement that
there are 500,000 acres that are cluttered up by oil shale
claims»

There is no basis in the record for that state­

ment „
The record shows in the transcript at page

22
3^17 and 3744 that in fact in Colorado the government did
a very thorough study of all of the counties»

These claims

have to be filed in counties or they lapse within thirty
days of discovery.

They made a very thorough survey of all

of the counties in which the preponderant part of the oil
shale was located, the Piceance Basin, and their testimony
was at that time — of course that was in 1920 — that at
that time approximately 3.5 percent of those reserves had
been patented, approximately 4.5 percent were claimed
subject to whatever infirmities the claims might have, so
that there was somewhere between 92 and 97 percent of this
priceless reserve that is owned today by the government
without any claims on it.
Mow, I come to my first point and that is the
problem, that faced the Congress and the Executive Branch
when they learned that they had this immense treasure on
their hands back in 1916.

It is necessary to touch briefly

by way of background upon the general land law.
The problem the United States faced in connection
with the public land was not.how to keep it, the problem
was how to get rid of it„
QUESTION:

Mr, Hamilton, let me .just be sure I

understand.
MR. HAMILTON:
QUESTION:

Surely.

The figures are so widely different*

23
I just want to be sure 1 understand.
MR. HAMILTON:
QUESTION:

Yes.

I understood Mr. Wallace to say there

are five million acres,
MR. HAMILTON:

I’m sorry, I misspoke.

He did

say five million.
QUESTION:

And you say that there is only roughly

the same amount as the 3^9,000 that have been patented.
MR. HAMILTON:

Roughly.

That's right.

That is

in the record,
QUESTION:

And does any neutral source enlighten

us as to which of you is correct on this?
MR. HAMILTON:

Well, the source that I was quot­

ing was not a neutral source, it was the government source.
QUESTION:

And that was as of what date?

MR, HAMILTON:
QUESTION:

1967, the date of the hearing.

I see.

MR. HAMILTON:

And that Is in the transcript?

That Is the transcript, 371^ to

37^, testimony of one of their experts named Duncan based
upon an extraordinary exhaustive study that had been made
by the department of the claims in all of the counties in
which the claims that had been filed.
QUESTION:

What was that transcript page again?

MR. HAMILTON:
QUESTION:

Sir?

What was that transcript reference?

24
MR. HAMILTON:

Transcript 3714-3744.

It is also

the source of ray statements it is the most valuable mineral
reserve in the world.
QUESTION:

More valuable than any of the Iranian

ones?
MRo HAMILTON:
QUESTION:

What?

MR. HAMILTON:
Arabia.

Much larger.

Much larger than Iran or Saudi

It is unbelievably large.
QUESTION:

But true.

MR. HAMILTON:

But true.

Now* I said that the

problem that faced the government in respect to the land
laws was not how to keep the land but not how to get rid
of it and that facts that show that are quite clear and
simple.

—
’When the—Thirteen Colonies got their freedom

from Britain, Britain agreed in the Treaty of Paris to
give the colonies all of the land that lay between the
western borders of the Thirteen Colonies and the Mississippi
River.

Maryland v<ould not approve of the constitution

because it didn’t have any western boundaries that abutted
on this land unless the new states agreed to cede it to the
federal government which they did3 and that doubled the
land that the thirteen states had from about 230 million
acres up to another 230 million acres.

25
Then when President Jefferson purchased the
Louisiana Purchase, that again doubled the area of the
United States and three-fourths of that was in the hands
of the federal government.

And then as we moved west —

the Manifest Destiny, the Mexican Cession, et cetera — we
finally exhausted the 2.5 billion acres of land that con­
stitute the United States and about 2.1 billion acres the
federal government has had on its hands, 1.8 billion, and
it has been very difficult to get rid of it.

It still

holds roughly 650 to 700 million acres.
Tirst they tried to sell it because Secretary
Hamilton and Secretary Gallatin thought it was a wonderful
way to pay the debt, so they started pricing it at $10 a.n
acre.

The only thing wrong with that was that there were

a lot of people in Pennsylvania, Virginia, New York and
other large states who had bought a lot of land from their
states for about three, four or five cents an acre and
they undercut the government price, so they couldn't do it.
They tried selling it on credit and nobody paid.

They all

went bankrupt because they didn't have working capital.
So finally they had to go to a policy of free
land, which they did.

They tried it. first in the Homestead

The first mining law came in in 1866 and

It provided in general terms that the land should be given
away.

It applied only to vein or lode mines, where the

miner discovered a vein and then was permitted to follow
it as far as it went in the earth.
In 18?G it was provided that you could mine
placer claims, placer claims being, as you know, detritus
or eroded land that has gone down in a stream and then
you pan it and get something out of it.

Both of these

was, and It is very interesting because we have to engage
in a way in an act of historical imagination to get our­
selves back to where we were in l8?2 because that is still
the law today and that is the law under which a lot of
hard rock miners even as we are sitting here are going out
with their burros and hammers and clamoring all

over the

public land, including the land that is reserved for parks
in most cases, trying to find hard rock minerals, gold,
silver, lead, et cetera, which haven’t been held under this
leasing act.

That is the law.

The historical imagination parts come in in
view of the circumstance that this was just — this law
was passed in 1972, just four years before the Sioux
Indians, under Sitting Bull, had their fight with Colo
Custer at the Battle of the Little Big Horn,:

That inci­

dentally was occasioned by the circumstances that — one
of the factors was a mine strike up in the Black Hills
and everybody was rushing up there and the whites very
callously and senselessly slaughtered the buffalo and
deprived the Indians of their food.
So that is the statute.
four very interesting parts.

Now, the statute has

Here it is:

Except as

otherwise provided, all vaulable mineral —"valuable"
wasn't in the '66 act, oddly enough — all valuable
mineral deposits in land belonging to the United States»

28
both surveyed and non-surveyed, shall be free and open to
exploration and purchase , and the lands in which they are
found to occupation and purchase;, by citizens of the United
States and those who have declared their intention of be­
coming such, under regulations prescribed by law* and
according to the local customs or rules of miners in the
several mining districts, so far as the same are applic­
able — in other words 9 Congress adopted the standards of
miners, whatever they were.

There was no federal govern­

ment for any practical purposes out in this part of the
world, so that in order to maintain peace they simply
said we will take over the customs of the miners»
Now, there are four aspects of that statute
which I think are relevant for our discussion today.
First, it says "valuable,” for it says they shall be free,
given away.

Next it says that that shall be done under

regulations prescribed by law and according to the local
customs of miners.
Now, the Department of the Interior had occasion
to consider that when Secretary Hoke Smith, twice governor
of Georgia and several times a Senator, was Secretary of
the Interior, and he wrote the famous Castle v. Womble
case about which you have heard so much.
I should like to read the passage quoted in the

The part I quote, which is set forth says:

"Where minerals have been found and the evidence is of

But then it goes on, and this is not quoted:
rtFor if as soon as minerals are shown to exist and at any
time during exploration before the returns became rexaunerative, the lands are to be subject to other disposition,
few would be found willing to risk time and capital in
the attempt to bring to light and make available the
mineral wealth which lies concealed in the bowels of the
earth as Congress obviously must have intended the explorer
should have had proper opportunity to do."

MR. HAMILTON:

Now* it was against that back-

ground that Congress and the Executive Branch found them­
selves facing a very serious problem when this great
valuable deposit of oil shale was discovered because it
was not hard rock mineral and all of the minerals before
that had been hard rock minerals* gold* silver* what have
you3 except for oil which had been made the subject of a
special act in 1897«
Furthermore, the problem with this mineral
wasn’t to discover it* everybody knew it was there* the
problem was in order to make It profitable to find a way
to improve the existing devices so that you could market
at a profit In competition with other forms of energy,
notably oil.
So Congress addressed itself to that problem
and tried to see how it could fit this non-met&llie energy
source into a law devised to take care of hard rock
minerals running in veins and found in placers, and the
conclusion that they came up with --

parallel here that you see between what happened with iron
up in the iron range and the development of new methods to
exploit taconite which reopened the whole mining industry?
MR. HAMILTON:

Sir, it would be analogous, yes,

sir.
The way the Congress and the way the Executive
Branch solved the problem, they solved in 1916 when they
made the first classification that, related to oil shale.
In 1897, Congress had given the Department of the Interior
the power to make classifications of lands as mineral or
non-mineral because the mineral lands took precedence over
the agricultural lands because it was felt that it was more
desirable to have the minerals developed in view of the
small amount of the minerals than it was to have additional
farms.
So in that classification, what happened was that
when the Director of the Geological Survey had to come to

32
grips with this problem of whether or not stuff was a valu­
able mineral, he found that it was and he wrote a memorandum
describing the basis for his reasoning and he wrote it to
the Commissioner of the Land Office and here is what he
said.

He said, "The net result of oil” — this was 1916 —

"The net result of oil shale Investigations already made
is that the oil-shale areas in Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming
constitute a latent petroleum reserve whose possible yield
is several times the estimated total remaining supply of
petroleum in the United States.”

As I mentioned, that is

still the ease today.
”1n view of the high prospective mineral value
of lands undex-lain by oil-shale deposits it is, of course,
apparent that they should not be permitted to be acquired
under the nonmineral land laws.

The lands have not been

recommended for withdrawal" — in those days, as now., the
Geodetic Survey, when they classified lands as minerals,
they could have withdrawn them from further location, as
was done in the ease of the minerals when they were made
available under the Mineral Leasing Act, including oil
shale, but it was decided hare — and this was an exception
to the ordinary practice — that they would find that they
were mineral in character and valuable for mineral, but
that they would not withdraw them, and the reasons why he
asserts that the department decided not to withdraw them

33
was because the oil-shale industry is not yet developed in
the United States, and as it is desired to give opportunity
for the establishment cf experimental plants, it is believed
the lands should remain open for the present to acquisition
under the mineral-land laws, even though they are ambiguous
and but poorly adapted to deposits of this type -- referring
to the hard rock deposits.
'’Accordingly, I hereby classify the tracts listed
below as mineral lands, valuable as a source of petroleum
and nitrogen, and request that you make the proper notation
of the classification upon your records.”
wow, that brings me to my third point, which is
the use that the government and Congress have made of that
solution to classify them as minerals and leave them open.
The first use, of course, was when they found the solution
and stated it in the language which I have just read.
Next, between 1916 and 1920, the record is full
of it, they notified Senators, Congressmen, people In the
West, newspapers, that this language is valuable, go after
it, the price of oil is going up.

It was about $1.20 in

1916 and reaching a high of $3.^8 in 1920.

The war was

over, people were concerned about it coming out and
thousands of people went out and staked claims.

It is all

in the record.
The question of whether or not there should be

a patent on these lands had to be faced by the department in
1920, in the same year that the Mineral Leasing Act vras
passed.

Now, the Minreal Leasing Act was passed for the

purpose of making available the substances that it covered,
petroleum, et cetera, which had been withdrawn as the
department had classified these lands as mineral.

So the

purpose of the act was to make available lands that were
not available at all theretofore except for oil shale.

It

had been available because, you recall, it was not with­
drawn,

These were.withdrawn.

MR. HAMILTON:

Nox*, how does that —

What happened was the act provided

that none of these minerals should be available for patent

but should only be available under lease, and it included
oil shale.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. HAMILTON:

The oil shale people said that is

going to kill our claims if it gees in like that because
we've got these claims and we haven’t got patents.

So

they came down to Washington and went to Interior with
their Congressmen and Senators and Interior said, yes,
that’s right, therefore we will put in a clause to save
the oil shale claims located before 1920.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. HAMILTON:

Because had they not done that,

they would have been wiped out.

So the purpose of the

saving clause was to save the oil shale claims.

didn't have that problem with the other ~~

Didn't they also save claims for

other minerals as well?
MR. HAMILTON:

As a practical matter, there

QUESTION:

I see.

MR. HAMILTON:

— had been classified, they

were withdrawn and you couldnst stake a claim.
QUESTION:

All right.

MR0 HAMILTON:

So they filed the instructions

37
following the original decision based on the last paragraph
of Castle Vo Vorable,
Now I had better turn promptly to my fourth point.
I should mention that in 1960-61, for reasons that nobody
knows because there was no hearing, nothing, tford went out
from Washington to the Department of the Interior, don't
issue any more claims on oil shale.

Thwere were 18 claims

pending, of which those here are two and there are 16
others in another case that has been going on for the same
16 years.

The 16 claims, they held them invalid because

they hadn’t done assessment work.

In these two claims,

there have been assessment work, the claims were otherwise
perfect so they produced this argument that oil shale was
not then and had never been valuable.
Now, the reasons we say that the law prohibits
then from doing that are

four:

In the first place

and

I have tried to outline very sketchily the facts that are
supplemented in our brief — we say that the Congress’ has
not just acquiesced or reacted something like the Internal
Revenue Code and overlooked some order where there is some
fine print, that the Congrsss was actively engaged indeed
in the oil shale and the Leasing Act expressly provided
that oil shale would be — it is a valuable mineral and
subject to patent because I submit that one cannot .read
that act and make any sense out of it unless one agrees

38
that oil shale is a valuable mineral.
The Congress by its other action at various times
as late as 1955, they passed a Multiple Leasing Act which
was introduced by Mr* Aspinall who *ra.s a Congressman for
that part of the world, and the reason for it as the legis­
lative history shows was that the Interior Department had
•

' i -

adopted the principle that they would not patent minerals
where there was a surface patent outstanding, for example,
on £ homestead patent where the minerals had. been reserved
as they were In the case of oil shale prior to 1920, unless
the oil shale mineral claimant could get a deed from the
surface owner and the surface owner, then the department
would grant the patent because it gave you the fee and if
you had a farmer that was going to hold you up you had
great difficulty getting him to agree to convey to you so
he could reconvey.

So they passed this statute to deal

expressly with oil shale, called the Multiple Leasing Act,
so Interior could now go ahead and grant a patent on the
mineral even though a homesteader owns the surface, be­
cause ordinarily a patent on a mineral patent takes the
surface with it.

But if the surface has been pre-patented

f

it couldn't do that.
Now, I will turn to the four points:

The first

is that Congress has actually endorsed this rule that oil
shale is a valuable mineral and so patented..

The second

39
is that apart from that, the Department of the Interior in
an independent ground has promulgated this' rule, has had it
in effect since 1920 at the very least in the Instructions,
that under those circumstances it cannot now in fairness
reverse it retroactively, and in that connection I should,
if I may, point to fch^ CouTt’s attention that neither one
of those two bases for your decision will have the slightest
prospective effect.

They can only affect oil shale.

They

can only affect oil shale claims that were located before
1920.

They can only affect oil shale claims that are

proven to be valid to meet all the other tests besides
discovery.

So therefore it is not as though you were being

asked to .keep an agency from changing a rule prospectively
that is going to affect the administration of some important
branch of the government, where you are going to bind it to
the past.

Here all you are being asked to do is to make

it stay with the past, as it were, what it did’ for *11 years*
So this has no consequencial effect, precedential effect
that will in any way impair Interior’s administration of
the mining laws on the public domain.
And as I have mentioned earlier, the total amount
of claims that are available are only about equal to what
they have already patented out of a total of 16,000 acres
in this great formation, so that it will have no consequen­
tia]. economic effect that will be adverse.

L\ 0

Thirdly, I eome to the point

which I take it

that already our position is clear ~~ that indeed this was
a valuable mineral, that it was decided the only rational
way they could have decided it was to say oil shale xvas a
valuable mineral, and perhaps, if I may say so, the sound­
ness of that position is illustrated by the circumstance
that if this Court should hold that oil shale is not a
valuable mineral, it will nullify 200,000 acres of reserva­
tions of oil shale that underlie homesteads where the
Interior Department has granted the homestead and reserved
the oil shale, but if oil shale is not a valuable mineral
that reservation is invalid and therefore the farmers and
the ranchers will pick up the oil shale which will be
roughly about the amount of oil shale that is still being
claimed.
Finally, we coma to the estoppel argument.

Our

position on estoppel is, of course, the Court has never
said the government could be estopped.

It has come up to

the brink and looked at it as in the Moser case but it
has not decided it„

The Ninth Circuit has taken the view

that the government may be estopped.
QUESTION:

Well, the Ninth Circuit was reversed

in liibi, which the government cites in its brief, because
this Court said the government could not be estopped?
cite it in your brief at page 76.

You

MR. HAMILTON:

With all respect9 we do not read

that as meaning that this Court has held that the govern™
ment cannot be estopped.

We read it as saying the govern­

ment could not be estopped in that case.

If I am wrong in

that, if this Court has decided and is going to continue
to hold that the government cannot be estopped, my argument
Is no good.
QUESTION:

I agree.

MR. HAMILTON:

Not at all.

Our argument is that

the estoppel eases where it has been held that the govern­
ment could not be escopped fall in general into several
categories and this is not one of them.

They fall into

cases where someone has acted outside the scope, some
government agency has acted outside the scope of the
authority that is given to it and here obviously we have
the Secretary involved acting within the scope of his
authority.
Two, where the estoppel is sought to. achieve a
result that has been expressly prohibited by statute, of
course, we take the 180-degree position on that, but here
the statutes are on our side.
Three, we take the position, of course, that the
estoppel turns on its own facts and would argue that with
the extension of government Into the affairs of the
citizens far beyond that contemplated, that estoppel in a

■42

gross case of a responsible government agency, top govern­
ment; official such as a Secretary, acting within the scope
of his authority even though, aa we argue, acting incor­
rectly, that estoppel is pi’oper but that is a question of
policy.
QUESTION:

Does that differ too much from an

administrative construction, a long continuing administra­
tive construction?
MR. HAMILTON:

Yes, I think it does, because in

the case of long administrative construction, one, it seems
to ne, is not dealing with equities so much

in terms of

dealing with the rights of a particular citisen, one is
dealing with a principle of government.

It doesn’t just

affect the parties in the case but it is a matter that
affects the way the society operates and what the rule of
law means as distinguished from what is equitable in a
particular case.

It seems to me that from the legal and

perhaps the philosophical standpoint it is equite one
thing for the Judicial Branch to say you must not be
capricious In general, you must not come and go and change
rules, people must be entitled to know what the law is as
against saying In a particular case -— in this case, the
conduct is so unfair, to use the language of the Moser
case, so unfair and gross as in this case, where it has
been relied on for years and millions of dollars have been

spent, in the ease of this particular* paty you may not do it.
QUESTION:

But then you would have to show the re­

liance elemento
t

MR. HAMILTON:

That is correct and we argue in our

briefs, absolutely, whereas if my philosophy is right one
shouldn’t.
QUESTION:

Mr. Hamilton, before you sit down, I

two and question three which you listed among three addi­
tional questions on page three of your brief.

If I may, I will just take

44
thirty seconds more.

I would, like to say that the benefits

that have flowed from this solution are these:

There are

now — our government has three processes in which we can
make oil out of this material that are workable and prac­
ticable and will produce it in quantities that are signifi­
cant in terms of a plant being 50,000 barrels a day.

We

have that.
The reason we ~~ we have 24 different corpora­
tions who are cited in the record who have twenty years of
know-how and experience and research and development in
this area.

If we hadn’t had this particular solution, we

wouldn’t have put those millions into this business and we
wouldn’t now be in a position where all the President has
to do is decide to spend the money and we can start over­
coming some of the problems that are obvious to all of us.
Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Hamilton.

Mr. Wallace.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER — REBUTTAL
MR. WALLACE:

I would like to say first that there

are an estimated five million acres which I have gotten from
the Department of the Interior, is based on an extrapolation
from the study that is in the record which relates to only
one county in the area in Colorado, and that extrapolation

then would take in the other counties in Colorado and the
areas in Wyoming and Utah which were not included in this
study of court house filings.

So it is an extrapolation

from that study on which vie base an estimate not in the
record of five million acres.
The difference between what is a valuable mineral
resource for purposes of classification and what is a valu­
able mineral deposit within the meaning of the mining laws
for purposes of giving someone a right to relinquishment of
federal title to the lands is explained in detail by the
Board of Appeals in Footnote 59 of its opinion starting on
page 115a of the appendix to the petition.

We don’t be­

lieve that classification has anything to do with the
problem in this case because, as this Court’s opinion that
I quoted to you, the 1905 opinion earlier held that land
can be chiefly valuable for its mineral resources'and still
not qualify under the mining law as a valuable mineral
deposit subject to current exploitation.

The other authori­

ties to the same effect are collected on page 21 of our
brief, including in the footnote there an 1891 decision of
this Court which we quote, stating that the existence of
the mineral must be in such quantities as would justify
expenditure and the effort to obtain it established as a
present fact.
The standard under the mining law was well

46
established even before the 1905 decision to which I called
the Court’s attention because of the fact that the rationale
of Freeman v. Summers was so contrary to it.
I would like to say a word about the estoppel
question.

The Court has never held the United States to be

estopped by the acts of its agents and certainly in accord­
ance with the cases that have been decided, the poorest
context in which to start would be on a question of aliena­
tion of the lands in a manner not authorised by Congress.
The claims involved here were described, the
kinds of claims involved here were described by this Court
In Best v. Humboldt Mining as a unique form of property.
They are conditional on annual assessment work.

They are

defeasible if the mineral resource ceases to be a valuable
mineral deposit.

Their validity is not administratively

reviewed in any way until a patent application is' filed
with the department.

Indeed, the claim needn’t even

specify what mineral it is that has been discovered.

And

Congress, by providing a six-year limitation period after
the issuance of the patent for contesting the validity of
the patent, has specified the only way in which the United
States will be estopped by administrative error under the
mining laws which would have the effect of alienating the
public lands to private interests in a manner not author­
ized by the mining laws, are not authorized by Congress

H7
itself, and I believe shows in detail why none of the other
traditional tests for estoppel would apply here in any
event.
Mow, this doesn’t mean that there is no recourse

MR. WALLACE:

We urge the Court to decide it be­

will have to continue.

Thre is related pending litigation

about — which has to go claim by claim about whether the
requisite assessment work was done in this period annually
over a period of more than sixty years, and it is better
for the question to be settled.
QUESTION:

Well, that is true if you had never

petitioned for certiorari, too.
MR. WALLACE:

We did and the Court granted the

petition and — the District Court passed on the question,
we think the question is a clear one, that there is no basis
for a holding of estoppel.

The Court of Appeals did not

reach it.
I would like to point out that this does not. mean

48
that the respondents and others similarly situated are
without any recourse.

They would then be remitted to pre­

sent their equities to Congress which would have the flexi­
bility of making whatever adjustments it might think appro­
priate in response to the equities they show, such as a
preference under the leasing law which is the way Congress
since 1920 has said the

access to this kind of mineral

deposits should be restricted.
