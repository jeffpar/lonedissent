MRo BROWN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:

»

This case, Stafford against Briggs, in tandem with

Colby Vo Driver, the next case to be heard, was argued here
last April 24.

And on May 4, this Court placed it on the

calendar for reargument now.
/

Very briefly, this is a case on writ of certiorari
to review the judgment of the District of Columbia circuit.
Colby is on writ of certiorari to review the judgment of the
First Circuit.
.

..

■

v

In both cases, the same precise issue is presented:
Did Congress intend, in enacting the Mandamus and Venue Act
of 1962 to grant to the district court national, nationwide
personal jurisdiction over federal officials sued for money
damages in their pocket-books for acts allegedly performed
under cover of law.
In other words, did Congress intend back in 1962
\

that federal officials can be sued not only, in essence, against

4
the United States, administrative actions, judicial review
of those involving the interests of the United States) but also,
as respondents claim, in essence against their own poeketbooks?
in any court of the country, regardless of where the harried
official works or lives; a burden never before imposed on the
citizenry?
Did Congress .intend this discrimination against
federal employees?
Now, Stafford against Briggs is a Bivens type action,
pivil rights tort alleging unconstitutional acts.

All of the

alleged! acts took place in Florida.
'i

'

i'

Plaintiffs chose to bring their suit in the District
i

pf Columbia, seeking $1. .5 million from the private assets of
ifour individuals Who were, or are, federal employees.
Plaintiffs’ counsel acknowledged that this case
was brought in the District of Columbia after shopping for the
most favorable forum.

Similarly, Mr. Wulf, in his oral argument

on April 24, conceded that Rhode Island was selected because,
quote, w© did not think it was an inhospitable forum, as a
matter of fact, period, end quote.
Who are the defendants in Stafford against Briggs?
it would be helpful to put this in perspective.

First is

petitioner William Stafford, then United States Attorney for
the Northern District of Florida, now a United Statas District
Judge in the Northern District of Florida.

t

5
Petitioner Carrouth:

an Assistant U.S. Attorney in

the Northern District of Florida,, now in private practice
in Florida»
Petitioner Meadow: a special agent of the FBI

stationed in Florida, still working in Florida,
So all of the petitioners have roots in Florida?
they’re not floating public officials.
QUESTION:
MR, BROWN:
QUESTION:

And—

Mr, Brown?
Yes? .

*

Has there been any development in the

lower courts since the original argument?
MR, BROWN:

Yes, I understand that the case is

proceeding against a non-petitioner named Guy Goodwin,

He is

a U.S« prosecutor in the Department of Justice, and I’ve been
told on the telephone that there has been discovery in that
case o

Is that as far as the Goodwin case has

progressed?
MRo BROWN:

Yes, Your Honor,

I think it’s important

to note that nothing has been tried on the merits in Stafford

And he3 s—
QUESTION:
MR. BROWN:

Has the Second Circuit ruled?
The Second Circuit ruled on September 10»

They decided to write after there was this reargument, a^d
they held that 1391(e), which is the second section of the
Mandamus and Venue Act, did not apply to Bivens type actions,
and that the actions, in order for the statute to apply,
had to be, in essence, against the United States.
And it's not in essence against the United States
to sue Goodwin in his pocketbook.
QUESTION:
MR. BROWNs

Does that case help your side ox: not?
Your Honor, it's---that panel came down

with a decision which, in an articulate and well presented way,
was the argument that I tried to make on April 24.
QUESTION:

But you haven’t filed it in a supplemental

you'11 find that it's nothing more than making Exhibit A the
opinion of the Second Circuit panel, which was Smith, Mansfield™

That’s better credentials than being a

MR. BROWN;

Well, he has both.

called before a grand jury in Florida.

They were

None of these plaintiffs

were indicted for conspiracy.

They

Their case became known as the

Gainesville Eight, and each was acquitted.
Their complaint is that Goodwin somehow did a little
dissembling before they went to the grand jury, even though
they ware acquitted, and that this violated their constitu­
tional rights, and that therefore—therefore Stafford and
Carrouth and Meadow, who didn't say anything, have to come
tc the District of Columbia under this Mandamus and Venue Act
misuse, and defend themselves for months and months and months,
even though they're resident in Florida, and even though they
could not, under normal and regular procedures, applicable
to all citizens, fee sued in the District of Columbia.
And I think it's significant that we’re not here
saying, public officials cannot be sued for 'wrongful acts
l

under color of law.

\

■

r

Ws say that they can be, and in this

particular place, the place to sue then is in Florida, and
that’s where the respondents concede they could have sued all
of them in Florida.

So it's not a problem of multiplicity of suits, et
cetera, et cetera; they can sue them in Florida*
Now, the District of Columbia Circuit determined
that notwithstanding that the second section of the Mandamus
and Venue Act does give personal jurisdiction over these
Florida residents, and this is the question before this Court,
at this time*
My argument is a simple one*

It's one point common

to petitioners in this case and in the tandem Colby case, and
that is, that the statute involved here simply does not apply
to respondent suits against federal officials' pccketbooks«
It wasn't intended to do that*

There is nothing in the purpose,

the history, of the statute to show that that was so*
Specifically that section was not intended by
Congress to supply jurisdiction and venue in tort suits; and
certainly not. in Bivens type actions Which, in 1962, were not
heard of, and it was nine years later—it was on June 21, 1971,
that Mr. Justice Brennan's decision came down in Bivens, and it
?•

■was new law and new application.
So the basic reasons that I believe the First Circuit
and the D*C0 Circuit have me.de a mistake, and that the
Second Circuit is correct, is, A, the purpose of the statute
is a single-theme purpose, and it doesn't include suing
people for a million and a hall: in their pocketbooks, public
officials, or a billion dollars in Rhode Island, where none of

9
them have ever been, against their pocketbooks, in Rhode
Island in Colby»
And the history of the statute makes clear that it
wasn't intended to apply to pockefcbock suits.
And we also take the position that the language of
the statute, that is, the Mandamus and Venue Act of 1962, the
statute at large, that, read as a whole, as it must be, shows
that this is—in the natura of a mandamus suit, it involves
"in essence against the United States,” and it doesn’t involve
Bivens type tort actions, pocketbook suits.
So that, when the statute is read in its full
context, with realization of its purpose, and in the light of
its legislative history, it becomes clear that Congress did
not direct or intend a coverage of the Bivens type of actions.
Now, in Blackburn, I would like to point out one
thing about Blackburn internally.
question about Mr» Goodwin.

DoC.

Mr. Justice Relinquish*s

Mr. Goodwin resides in Washington,

He’s sued by the civil, rights bar in the Southern

District of New York in Blackburn,

He’s also sued in another

case there called Cole, and they treated them together.

But

he's sued twice, hit twice, like a shuttlecock, in New York.
Now, the District Court made a holding, which was
not appealed, that there wasn't the slightest evidence
connecting Goodwin to a conspiracy as alleged in New York.
No evidence, no threshold evidence; therefore, the long arm

.10
statute*, he held, goes out. However, -die District Court Judge Haight found that
1391(e) did give the jurisdiction.

Now there’s the abuse.

Not

the slightest evidence under the long arm statute, but ah-hah,
1391(e), somehow or another, because perhaps of the climate of
thinking today,, can reach out and bring Goodwin in and make him
go through motions to dismiss, discovery motions, and a
harrassed life.
Now, it was that holding of the district court on
1391(e) that the panel reversed.

They argued in March? they

came down'September 10 with their opinion, which, is Exhibit A.
Now, T say that-there are several things that.show
that pocketbook suits are -not included by the intention of
Congress in 1962.
The first is that Section 1391(a), which is found
codified in the venue part of the federal rules, that that
isn't the whole statute.

The respondents pretend that it is

separate, distinct, and that it was intended to be separate
and distinct, but it was not.

You look at the bill, boom-boom,

Section 1, Section 2? you look at the Act, Section 1, Section 2
you look at the preferred sources, the reports of the House,
the reports of the Senate, and they say, clearly, the}?8re
together, they’re companion, one implements the other? they
gc together? the language of the second section reflects the
language of the first section? the first section leads to the

second section»
As a matter of fact, without the second section, you
couldn't operate the first section»
horse and carriage»

They go together like a

And that was the holding of the Second

Circuit, that it must be read together»

And that wasn't the

first time that a reputable court found that it had to be
read together; Judge Friendly in Liberation News, in examining
the history said, read it together»

He said it, in haee verba,

in Natural Resources Council against TVA, he said it has to be
read together»
The Second Circuit has had some experience with the
statute, and has. seen the efforts of certain advocates to
if-

■ ■

.

expand it to cover whatever situation arises.
V\

•

.

But I think

'

•it’s important to note that it isn't just Judge Friendly in
the Second Circuit that's examined this statute.

It isn't

Judge Mulligan that has examined this statute.
Also examining this statute has bean this Court.

And

to that, this Court decided Soh.langer against Seamans.

And

The locale

The young man seeking habeas corpus was in

The only

problem was, and it's stated quite clearly

by this Court—-Mr, Justice Douglas -“the sole question in the
case is whether the district court for the district of Arizona
had jurisdiction to entertain on the merits petitioner's

12
J'

application for a writ of habeas corpus.
How, Mr. Justice Douglas-

said that it was—unless

the custodian, the necessary party, in other words, was within
the jurisdiction of Arizona, they couldn't entertain the
petition.
All right.,

The custodian was in Georgia.

The

superior officers, also alleged necessary parties, arcs in the
District of

Columbia.

And it was argued, and Mr. Mel Wulf

was a friend of the Court—more a friend of Mr. Schlanger—they
argued that if the normal jurisdiction would not stretch to
cover the custodians on some kind of Strait against Laird
notion? that if it wouldn't stretch, then use 1391(e), and
that's where the discovery was made that 1391(e) is a pretty
good idea to grab jurisdiction over public officials.
And at that time, Mr. Justice Douglas

held that the

lack of jurisdiction was fatal, and that the 1391(e) would not
apply„
Why wouldn't 1391(a) apply?

This Court, with the

•

Chief Justice sitting, Black, Brennan, White, Marshall and
?
?
Blackmun joined Harlan, Jay and Kirkland'in the result;

o
Stewart, Jay dissented, without opinion.

Mr. Justice Douglas

said that 1391(a) was enacted to broaden the venue of civil
actions which could have previously been brought only in the
District of Columbia—only could have been brought in the
District of Columbia.

13

Now, the Stafford case could not have been brought
in the District of Columbia.

Tort actions in 1962 and before

could have been brought anywhere; they were not restricted.
And that is a limitation on the kind of cases that can be used.
And it also shows that 1391(e), as a venue statute, is not-—does
not cover all civil actions.
QUESTIONS

Well, there's another very good explana­

tion why 1391(e) wasn't applicable in the Schlanger case, and
that is, that 1391(e) by its own terms provides this venue, as
it says, except as otherwise provided by law.

And in the

habeas corpus, it's limited by law to the venue of the
custodial officer, isn't it?
MR0 BROWN s

But that isn9 fc—-doesn" t make the

difference, because the question is whether a government
official--that would be the custodian-was a government
official, United States official, whether he could be reached
in Georgia, or whether the Secretary of the Air Force could
be reached in Washington, DoC„

And it found that it did not,

and that quotation of footnote 4 doesn9t go to exceptions.
flatly states that, after looking at the history, that
it doesn51 apply to those suits that could not be brought in
the District of Columbia, and that is significant.

In fact,

that is the recurrent theme going through the preferred
sources, -the Senate report and the House report.
I think that if you look at the purpose of this

It

14
legislation, you will see that it doesn't provide for pocketbook suits, whether they be for $1.5 million or $1 billion
or $100,000.

Take the House and Senate reports? both state

what the purpose is.

And I think everybody seems to jump over

it, but it's important.
It says, the purpose of this bill—bill—-is to make
it possible to bring actions against government officials
and agencies in U.S0 District Courts outside the District of
Columbia, which, because of certain existing limitations on
jurisdiction and venue,

may now ba brought only in the

United States District Court for the District of Columbia.
Now, I also want to call Your Honors attention,
in connectionwith purpose, to the House report that states
unequivocally that the purpose of Section 1391(e), that's the
second section, the purpose of 1391(e) was, quote, similar to
that of—and then and quote—Section' 1361, which is the first
section.

And then the report says—and I think it's highly

significant, and this is at the Colby petition 91A—that the
new venue provision was, and now I'm quoting, designed to
permit an action which is essentially against the United
States to be brought locally rather than requiring that it be
brought in the District of Columbia, simply because Washington
is the official residence of the officer or agency sued.
Now, what we have here is respondents and the court
below turning the statute upside down.

Instead of using the

15
statute to bring a suit locally, 'which could formerly have been
brought only in Washington,. D.C., respondents seek to bring an
action in Washington, D.C*, which could only have been brought
locally»

MS» PETERSON:
QUESTION:

I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice?

It could ha seven other different kinds

of actions for the purposes of the legal question that’s
here?

16
MSo PETERSON? Yes.
As this Court.has already been told, the significant
development in this case since the last argument was the
opinion of the Second Circuit in the Blackburn case.
Petitioners rely most heavily on that decision, but
in a way, respondents rely on it also.

We rely upon it as

making absolutely clear the importance of considering the
entire legislative history, and not merely part of it, in
determining the scope of Section 1391(e).
*

\

Fox* the only way the Second Circuit could have ruled
as it did was by ignoring critical parts of the legislative
history; that is the only way that one can conclude that
Section 1391(e) does not encompass damages.
This Court is aware of the fact that three deputy
attorney generals and a Justice Department spokesman addressed
the—expressed themselves on the damage action issue.

Three

of them told Congress before the law was passed? and that
Congress, interacting with and responding to the.Department,
selectively either adopted suggestions from the Department
of Justice, changing the wording of one or the other of the
statutes before it, or rejected the Department's suggestion.
The Justice Department was in repeated contact with
Congress, trying to get Congress to exclude damage actions.
What the representatives of the Department of Justice said,
and the Congressional reaction thereto, is essential for a

17
meaningful analysis of Congress' intent, because their state­
ments to Congress show that Congress was made fully aware of
the damage issue while it was considering the proposed bill,
and that Congress was fully aware that the proposed bill
covered damage actions»
The Department of Justice triad to get Congress not
to include damage action»

It told Congress how to avoid

covering damage action; what language to use to avoid damage
actions»

At least twice, Congress rejected the Department of

Justice warnings about proposed language, and employed
language that clearly covered damage actions»
Now we have the Second Circuit opinion, without a
word, literally without a. word, about the communications from
the three deputy attorney generals.

This is not applying

legislative history—-it is burying it»
That is what the Second Circuit did, and that is
what petitioners would have this Court do»
An interesting thing

about the Second Circuit

opinion is that it noted that the Department of Justice
representative, Mr.MacGuineas,- had warned Congress at the
hearings not. to cover damage actions.
He did- indeed.

But the Second Circuit fails to

mention that, after that warning, after Mr.MaeGuineas told
them that if they use the language, "under color of law," that
they would be covering out-of-pocket suits, the bill was

18
redrafted by the House committee, and that exact language was
inserted.

QUESTION:

Miss Peterson,, you9re of course defending

the decision of the Court of Appeals for the District of
/

Columbia circuit.
Do you think the First Circuit, which is the next,
case, likewise read the statute literally on its face?

Do

you think the First Circuit and District of Columbia Circuit's
decisions are exacti}/’ alike?
MSo PETERSON:

I think that there are slight

differences between them, but I think that they both read the
statute together with the legislative history.
Of course, the First Circuit had the benefit of the
hearing, which the District of Columbia Circuit didn't have.
Also, the First Circuit had the benefit of Mr. Katzenbach*s

19
memorandum, which the District of Columbia Circuit didn't
have, because neither of them had been revealed until after
the District of Columbia decision.,
QUESTIONS

I’m not quite clear, when you said the

DcCo Circuit did not have ‘the benefit of them, can you tell us
why?
MSo PETERSON;

Yes.

Mr. Chief Justice, the—-at the

time of the argument and the decision before the District of
Columbia circuit, no one knew of the availability of those
hearings.

The Justice Department presented them to the First

Circuit about—I believe it was about three weeks before the
argument in the Driver case, now the Colby case.

Also the

Katzenbach memorandum was presented at that time.
The«Justice Department was in there representing
petitioners, and they made a petition for rehearing to the
D0Co Circuit, in which they lodged with the court the
Katzenbach memorandum.

They did not lodge the hearings.

So the D.Co Circuit never saw those two documents.

MSo PETERSON:

correct, and of course the Court did not grant cert on that
issueo
QUESTION:

Doesn't that have .some bearing on whether

damage actions were included?

What was the Court's purpose

in excising out, excluding, the former officials?

Was it

because there wasn't anything -they could do in terms of
mandamus-type relief or injunctive relief?

I believe, because they felt they were not included in the
legislative history.

QUESTION;

Yea» .

MS» PETERSON;

Oh—I'm sorry Mr» Justice Blackmun—I

fact that the Court did not grant, cert on the issue»
If you- want ray opinion on that, I think former

QUESTION:

No, the significance of Mr» Justice

Rehnquist's was,, was literalism applied to the statute by the
two circuits?
MS» PETERSON:

Yes, but the statute does say,

"is an

Reading Section 1391(e) in terms of its legislative
history- dees not mean reading the legislative history
selectively to ignore, those portions of the legislative history
that establish that Congress chose language for this statute
that encompassed'damage actions, and which, it had been told,
would not encompass' damage actions»

The Justice Department communications are vital
to an understanding of the evolution of the law, because they

22
reveal that Congress was made aware of the damage actions, axid
deliberately acted to cover such suits in the language it
selected, and in the language it rejected.
Obviously—
QUESTION:

It could have eliminated that x^ith just a

few words, couldn’t it?
MS. PETERSON:

Yes, it could have,-Mr. Chief Justice.

It could have said-—
QUESTION:

Perhaps—

MS» PETERSON:

—"except in damage actions."

it became aware of the problem.
QUESTION:

After

There was—

Well, it cuts.the other way, too.

The

Congress could, have made it expressly to include damage
actions? it could have made it to include all types of actions,
could it not? MS. PETERSON:

Yes, but Congress chose words for

that statute which are the same as the words Congress chose
for 1391(a) and (b), for example, which says, all civil
actions.

And "all civil actions," in those

two statutes,

clearly encompasses damage action.
And then when. Congress got to 1361, it chose
different language.

It said, "in mandamus type actions.”

So Congress knew how to exclude damage actions if it wanted,
to.

It knew how to draw a narrow statute.

And it had warnings

about the language, the warnings in the White latter, which

23

made a suggestion as to what language to use that would
exclude damage actions»
And it’s clear that Congress did not select that
language.

It chose language that the Justice Department

spokesperson had told them would cover out-of-pocket cases.
Obviously, respondents are not relying on the Katsenbach
memorandum,, standing alone.
QUESTION?

However, it was a culmination of—

The Xatsenfoach memorandum cam® after the

statute was enacted, didn't it?
MS. PETERSON3

Yes, it did, Mr. Justice Stewart.

It came shortly after—
QUESTION:

Shortly afterward.

MS. PETERSON:

—the statute was enacted.

But the Katsenbach memorandum is a culmination of
the interaction of Congress and the Department of Justice
over the legislation during a period of 2-1/2 years.

It was a.

final acknowledgement, by the Department of Justice, that it
had failed in this Congress not to cover damage actions, and
that a law had been passed which encompassed such actions.

memorandum, ws have the President signing statement.

memorandum was sent to all the U.S. Attorneys around the
country.

It was divided into two sections.

After setting

forth what the statute*—the two statutes were that were
passed, and the signing statement, the first section deals

24

with the question of Section 1361 and. how it only applie.s to
ministerial duties, and does not apply to discretionary acts»
Then starting on page 6, it deals with Section 1391(e)
and venue questions»

And on page 7 is the acknowledgement

that 1391(e) covers suits for damages against Federal officials,
out~of"~their-"pQcket suit.

They were talking in this memorandum

about libel and slander suits, because that’s the kind of suit
that Congresf was concerned about.

That’s the kind of suits

that were being talked about at the hearings.

And that’s the

kind of suits that were available at that time.
QUESTION:

The—-in this case, do the plaintiffs live

in the District of Columbia?
MS o' PETERSON?

None of the plaintiffs live in the

District of Columbia.

QUESTION:

A defendant in the action?

MS. PETERSON:
QUESTION:

A defendant, yes.

And--I see.

MS. PETERSON:

And in response to Mr. Justice

Blackman’s earlier question, the case against defendant Goodwin
is proceeding in the District of Columbia; depositions and
discoveries have been done in that case in both the District of

25
Columbia and in Florida, and the case is nearing trial.
That is—
QUESTION;

The statute was amended in 1976, was it

not ?
MS o PETERSON:
QUESTIONS

Yes, sir.

Most importantly, to provide for service

upon additional persons, but also-"-and I'm reading now from the
First Circuit opinion in Driver against Helms case--''each1' was

It used to be that each defendant
And several courts had interpreted

that to mean that if you had

nonfederal officials as

defendants, you couldn't use the statute.

And it was amended

so that you could have non «-federal officials as defendants, but
you could use the special service provisions to get jurisdiction
over the non-federal official.
QUESTION:

So it's the first line of the first

■sentence of the statute that was amended?
MS. PETERSON:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Civil action in which each defendant is

an officer, was changed to, a civil action in which a defendant
is an officer?

QUESTIONS

Then the added provision?

MS. PETERSON s
QUESTION;

Yes.

Yes.

MS. PETERSON;

It's interesting, because at the

time of that amendment, three different statutes were amended.
Congress was not dealing with only one statuta; they x\?ere
dealing with a variety of statutes.

And it shows how the

legislative history of more than one statute can be dealt with
in one report.
And it“~down here, the legislative history of 1361
and 1391 are dealt with in the same three reports, two from
the. House and one from the Senate.

But it is possible to go

through and find the themes of the difference between when
they ware talking about mandamus-type actions, which overlap
both statutes, and when they ware talking about damage actions,
which dealt with only 1391(e).
And there is legislative history on both.

And what

the petitioners are trying to get us to do is to read ;
1391(e) as if it is encompassed by 1361, as if 1361 is
referred to in the statute.
The Congress had a variety of purposes, and when
Mr. Brown read to you some of their purposes, he read them

saying, only for this purpose.

But the "only" was not in

But it was not in the

It’s the way you have to

read it—
QUESTION s

Yes.

MSo PETERSON;
QUESTION;

—in order to include damage actions.

Looking at the intent of Congress in 1961

or whenever it was, doesn't the fact that the original bill
included the word "each," and therefore contained the require­
ment that all defendants be government officials, lend some
support to the notion that they were primarily thinking in
terms of action which are, in substance, against the government?
Damage action would be more likely to be one that
could have multiple defendants, some private, some public.,
wouldn't it?
MS. PETERSON;

I think what they were-—I don't think

they really thought through the problem of third party
defendants, because that would go against all the discussion
that was before them about the damage actions.

And what they

28

they were trying to do was to encompass into one suit all the
various complaints that citizens might have because of the
misworkings of government.
QUESTIONS

Well, they talk about two different

kinds of damage actions that I remember, at any rate.

One is

the postman who goes home at night and gets into an auto­
mobile accident? and they clearly don't want to include that.
And that's not under color of law.
and slander.

And the other is the libel

And in that context, there would be at least a.

greater likelihood of private defendants being involved if
you have say? you know, a libel slander that's republished and
so forth, you'd have multiple defendants? but they didn't
include the multiple defendants, which is sort of strange to
me .
MS. PETERSON;

I found no evidence in the legislative

history that that problem was ever brought: to their attention.
And I think maybe if at the time of the legislation—
QUESTION;

There really is not a great deal of

discussion of private damage.
you're right.

There is reference to it,

But there really isn't much discussion of this

precise problem that I can find.
There is discussion of -the facts of a damage
action.

And those two examples, that I found.

discuss any other examples?

But do they

29

MSo PETERSON;

Yes.

Thera are about five crucial

exampleswhich I can run through for you very briefly .
One, there was a letter from Deputy Attorney General
Walsh—
QUESTION:

No, I mean any other kinds of damage

actions other than the postman case or the libel and slander
case .
MSo PETERSON?

I think it was a libel and slander

type of case they were primarily concerne! with.

Because

Barr v„ Mafcteo-QUESTION?

Right.

MSo PETERSONs

-—had recently come down, and they

were concerned with where,the line was going to be drawn.

You

could bring those cases—
QUESTION s

And/ Katzenbach couldn51 defend these on

the grounds of immunity or something, right.

But they don’t

discuss any other kinds of damage actions other than those
two that I noticed.

Now maybe I'm just really inquiring as

to whether I missed anything on that.
MS., PETERSON?

No, I think all the concentration at

that time was on the libel and the slander actions.
QUESTION?

Though—

Ms. Paterson, you mentioned a moment ago

in response toa question from Justice .Stevens a letter 'from
Deputy Attorney General Walsh.

And you've also relied in

your briefs on a letter from Deputy Attorney General White,

30
and referred, 1 think, to a. letter--a comment from Deputy
Attorney General Katsenhach.
Did this bill have its genesis over a period of
years?

Because I take it the three Deputy Attorney Generals

weren't all in office at the same time,,
QUESTION:

No, that’s correct»

It was first

introduced in 1958, and no action was taken on it»

Then it was

reintroduced in 1960,and they had the House hearings on it«
Finally it—-the—then it was redrafted after the warning and
with the language, and passed in that form by the House*

Then

it was essentially the Senate who solicited the comments from
fchen-Deputy Attorney General White, who had replaced Mr. Walsh.
And he sent in his comment at that point.

A few months later,

the Senate amended it on the basis of Mr. White’s comments.
And by that point, Deputy Attorney General Katzenbach was in
office, and he wrote two letters to the House managers with
his coments on it.
1361.

His comments were only addressed to

And then it was passed in 1962.
QUESTION:

And then Deputy Attorney General Katzen­

bach wrote that memorandum to the district attorneys, right?
MS. PETERSONs

And in between, a few days after he

wrote to the floor managers of the House, he wrote to the
President, suggesting that the President issue the signing
statement.

And as we now know, he sent him the very statement

that, the President actually issued.

31

QUESTION s

And then he did , after the statute was

enacted, sent another ftiemo around, didn't ha?
MSo PETERSONs
all UoS« Attorneys.

Yes.

Then he sent a memorandum to

The sequence of this shows the last

communication we had from the Department of Justice about the
damage issue is in the White letter, in which he tells them
how to avoid damage actions, and they do not follow his
advice, but leave the statute broad.
Than, as Deputy Attorney General Katsenbach got
involved, it was clear that the problem that the Department
of Justice was concerned about was a problem which had been
raised in Mr. White’s letter to them, which was the problem
where Mr. White talked about the potential constitutional
problem of separation of powers.
It was of great moment to the Department of Justice,
this separation of powers problem, because they were talking
about the exercise of discretion, and court© telling federal
officials how to exercise their discretion.

And this is in

connection with 1361.
QUESTION;

re-argument, and we're talking just about two or three

any agency thereof, acting in his official capacity or under
color of legal authority»
Now, Mr, Stafford—the grievance you have against
Stafford, is when he was U.S. Attorney, is it. not?

That’s correct»

QUESTION;

Now, when you sued him, was he U.S.

.

Attorney, or a U.S, District Judge7
MS. PETERSON;

No, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, he was

UoSo Attorney at the time.

All of the defendants at the

time that we sued them ware still acting as officers of the
United States.
QUESTION;

In the capacity—-in which they had been

acting at the time that you claimed they violated your
rights?
MS. PETERSON;

Yes, all the petitioners were still

in that capacity.
I want to very briefly run through the five steps
in the legislative process which we feel are crucial to an
understanding that damage actions were covered.
First there was a letter from Deputy Attorney
General Walsh, which brought the damage action issue to the
attention of Congress.
QUESTION;

He—

That was a previous coverage, wasn't it?

MS. PETERSON;

Yes.

33
QUESTIONS

Yes„

MSo PETERSON:
QUESTION:

That was a previous Congress, wasn’t it-5

MSo PETERSON:
QUESTION:

He didn't™-

Yes„

Yes.

That was the—

It was not the Congress that

enacted this legislation*5
MS. PETERSON:

It was in I960.

That letter was in

the hands of the House Judiciary Committee when it had its
hearing.

And he referred to the existence of damage actions?

he didn’t talk about what kind of damage actions, I don’t
know if he was talking about libel and slander.

It appeared

that he was talking about more than—different types of
damage actions than just libel and slander, but he didn’t
specify.

But he said that there were damage actions against

federal officials for acts beyond the scope of their authority.
Then we had the transcripts of the hearings in
which damage actions are talked
Guineas

telling them not

about.

Then we have Mr. Mac-

to use ’’under color of law”, because

that will be. out-of-the-pocket.
Then we have the House Committee redrafting the bill,
putting in the language? and we also at that tine, the House
Committee did a report and talked about the problem, and suits
against the federal officials seeking damages from them—not
from the government, but from them.

And that, paragraph is
i

included in all the reports.

34

Then we have the letter from Deputy Attorney General
Whitei suggesting the language that they should use , alternative
language that would avoid damage actions„
And finally, after -the law is passed, we have the
Katzenbaeh memorandum acknowledging that damage actions are
covered»
QUESTIONi

Could you have sued Stafford under this-"

•in this district after he became a district judge?

Given the

contents of your allegations on the merits?
MSo PETERSON:

Could we sue him in the District of

i

Columbia?
QUESTION:

Yes»

MS» PETERSON:

Hot under the—I don31 believe under

the present interpretation of the law by the District of
Columbia, that we could»
:

QUESTION:

Because he's a former—

MSs PETERSON:
QUESTION;

Because then he'd be a former official„

Although he's a present official»

He's

certainly an officer of the United States, he's a United
■States District Judge»
MSo PETERSON:

But he was not-—would no longer be

occupying the same office»
QUESTION:

But—

But the statute doesn't say, occupy the

same office.
MS» PETERSON:

I believe that that is one of the

35
issues that the Court didn’t grant cert on, or was a hole
left open in the Driver case»

And we haven’t had that issue

in our case, but perhaps Mr. Wulf can address it.
Our position is that there isn't any inconsistency
in the legislative history between the two lines of legislative
history.

In many respects, they are dealing with the two

separate statutes, claims of confusion, meaninglessness,
inconsistency, or whatever adjective is used, come only when
one tries to brush off legislative history about damage
.i

actions, and ignore the fact that Congress was dealing with
two separate issues, and two separate statutes at the same
time»
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BRUGERs

Bo you have anything

further, Mr. Brown?
MR, BROWSJ:

May I, Your Honor?

Just a moment.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PETER Me BROWN, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. BROWNs

The answer to Mr, Justice Relinquish9s

question to Ms. Peterson is, no, could not bring, before 1962,
an action of this kind.
QUESTION:

And, in fact, if he’d been promoted from

Deputy Attorney General, what would be the situation?

If the

suit was originally for actions as Deputy Attorney General,
and later he’d been promoted?

Would that be the same as going

over to a district judgeship for these purposes?

36
MRa BROWN:

Well, if the question is, before 1962,

before 1962 actions in the nature of mandamus would have to be
brought in the District of Columbia.

If the action was a

pocketbook case, a tort action, it would be brought locally.
*

QUESTION:
MR. BROWN:

But I mean after 1962.
After 1952, you cannot reach the

petitioners in the District of Columbia? you cannot.

Except

if this Court upholds the D„C. Circuit.
QUESTION:

But if you read the language literally,

and uphold the D,C. Circuit, you can reach someone who has
been promoted to an entirely different federal office.
MS, BROWN:

You could arguably come to such a

conclusion.
I would just like to point out that Ms. Peterson
talks about unpreferred sources.

Unpreferred sources—what

the Department of Justice may have said or may not have said,
they're not legislators.

And what Katzenbach said afterwards,

if he did say it, if he did write that memorandum, if he did
sign it—I sea no signature, I don't know who wrote the
Katzenbach memorandum after the legislation was enacted.
These are unpreferred sources.
the latest report, the Senate report.

The real source is

If Ms. Peterson had

looked at the) Senate report, she would see that on page 2785,
which is also sometimes said to be page 1, purpose is written
out.

37
And it says, "The purpose of this bill," comma,
"as amended," is to make possible to bring actions against
government officials and agencies in the United States District
Courts outside the District of Columbia, which, because of cer­
tain existing limitations on jurisdiction and venue, may now
be brought only in the Unite d States District Court for the
District of Columbia»
It5s nothing else;

That is the purpose of the bill-

and of the statute»
And her suit does not come within that purpose»
She also dees not read to you from a preferred source where
the Senate report is important because it came out just before
the enactment, just a matter of weeks before the enactment»
And it says;

The bill, comma, as amended»

And I want to

point out that it was amended many times, and it goes back to
the gestation period of five years»

And this is the

latest preferred source.
It says, the bill, as amended, is intended to
facilitate review by the federal courts of administrative
action, period.
Now, what

has the Bivens-type action of these

petitioners, none of whom live in the District of Columbia,
and are trying to bring some people up from Florida to sue them
in their pocket books for a million point five, what does that
have to do with an administrative action?

38

If It honestly and truly is an administrative, it
is, in essence, against the United States, and they may not dip
in petitioners' pockets for their second mortgage and their
tuition savings bank account.
They have to make up their minds0

This is an

administrative review, Mandamus and Venue Act, and nothing
more»

And the effort to extend it to pocketbook suits is

an effort to put federal employees in a special disadvantaged
class.

It's to discriminate against them as you discriminate

against nobody else in the United States.
Pick out the federal employees, and you say to
«

them, "You can be sued in Nome? you can be sued in Maine; you
can be sued anytime any plaintiff wants to sue you.
you have to go there„

And

You have to bring your witnesses there.

You have to bring.your documents there.

And if you’re

totally innocent, assuming, you will have two years of the
worst, years of your life."
And not only that, but you’re sued in a multiplicity
of suits.
