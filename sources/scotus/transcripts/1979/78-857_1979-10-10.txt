PROCEEDINGS
MB. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next In National Labor Relations Board v. Yeshiva University
and a consolidated case.
Mr. Come, I think you may proceed whenever you
are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF NORTON J. COME, ESQ.#
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. COME:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case is here on certiorari to the Second
Circuit which denied enforcement in the Board’s order re­
quiring Yeshiva University to bargain with the union and
Yeshiva University Faculty Association which following a
Board election had been certified as the bargaining repre­
sentative of the university’s full-time faculty members.
The question presented is whether a university’s
faculty members who participate in decision-making regard­
ing the hiring, termination and promotion of faculty and
' he ..eademic standards of the university are managerial
or supervisory employees and thus exempt from the coverage
of the National Labor Relations Act, as the Court of
Appeals found, or merely professional employees who are
protected by the act, as the Board held.
QUESTION:

It could be both, couldn’t it?

5
MR. COME:

They could be both, aid that is why I

said merely.
There is no question that the faculty are pro­
fessional employees.

The question is whether they are

also managerial.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. COME:

Yeshiva University is a private educa­

tional institution chartered by the State of New York,
facilities located on four campuses in New York City, has
approximately 2,500 full and part-time students that attend
schools involved in this proceeding, and those schools have
approximately 209 full-time and 150 part-time faculty
members The ultimate policy

and decision-making body is

the Board of Trustees on which no faculty members sit.
The university President, who is the chief executive officer
of the university, is a member of the Board of Trustees.
The next stratum of the administration consists of the Vice
Presidents for Academic Affairs, Business Affairs and
Student Affairs.
The chief administrative officer of each of the
sch ols is the dean or director who serves as the liaison
officer between the programmatic activities of the school
and the central administration and reports and is responsible
to the academic vice president and the president.

And there

6
Is an Executive Council of the university whose members are
appointed by the president, with the concurrence of the
Board of Trustees, which consists of the deans of the vari­
ous schools and the directors of the various administrative
divisions of the university.
The administration also has various committees,
including a budget committee which is appointed by the
President and consists of the Vice President for Business
Affairs, the Ptegiatrar and the Dean of one of the colleges.
The budget committee establishes guidelines which are
followed by the deans and directors of the various schools
in drafting their budgets.

The draft budgets are then

submitted to the Vice President for Business Affairs x*ho

reviews

them

with the budget committee

and then submits

them to the President.
Now, paralleling this administrative or bureau­
cratic structure :ls a structure of faculty committees,
councils and assemblies which enables the faculty members
to share in the governments of the university.

Thus the

'■'’acuity members of the various schools exercise consider­
able discretion in determining their own curriculum, the
grading system, admission and matriculation standards, and
course schedules.
QUESTION:
among the schools?

Mr. Come, does it vary somewhat

7
MR. COME:

It does vary to some extent, but in

general fch5.s is the picture and the picture that the Board
found is typical of most other universities and collegas.
QUESTION:

When you say "their own curriculum

you mean the curriculum that the faculty teaches the
students, I take it?
MR. COME:

That is correct.

They also make

recommendations -— talking about the faculty now — which
are often accepted, regarding the hiring, reappointment
’

;,

i

and termination, promotion and tenure of other faculty
members.
Now, the court below acknowledged that, as I
said before, university faculty members were professional

employees within the meaning of 221 of the act and as an
incident of that professionalism they could determine the
contents of the course and the methods of teaching it and
the evaluation of the students’ academic performance.

The

court —
QUESTION:

That la, each faculty member with

respect to his own course and his own students?
*

MR. COME:

That is correct.

QUESTION:

But that alone didn’t make them

managerial.
MR. COME:

That did not.

But in the court’s

view, when the faculty members go beyond that, as they did

8
here, and exercised the additional powers that 1 have al­
luded to, they were no longer simply exercizing profes­
sional expertise but really were substantially and perva­
sively operating the enterprise.
Now, we submit that the court below failed
adequately to analyse the basis for the act's exclusion of
managerial and supervisory employees and to distinguish be­
tween the faculty's Influence over matters of professional
v

"

'0

concern and its actual formal bureaucratic authority.
Supervisors, as this Court is aware, are exempt
from the National Labor Relations Act and they a^e defined
as persons who exorcise authority over employees in the
interest of the employer.

The Senate? report refers to

them as persons who are traditionally regarded a3 part of
management as opposed to rank and file employees.’
Similarly, managerial employees, as this Court
held in Aerospace several years ago, likewise are exempt
from the act and they are defined as Executives who formu­
late and effectuate management policies by expressing and
making operative the decisions of their employer.

Like

supervisorss managerial employees are recognized-by their
alliance with management as opposed to the rank and file
employees.
Now, at the same time that it exempted supervisory
and managerial employees, Congress continued the coverage

9
of professional employees who are defined In.section 212 of
the act as those who exercise discretion and judgment in
the exercise of their work.

And although many professional

employees are asked for their advice on many important
policy questions, they do not become managerial employees
merely because their advice has an important influence on
the conduct* the ultimate conduct of the enterprise or the
institution.

It is necessary to show* as this Court

pointed out in the Bell Aerospace opinion* that profession­
al employees were acting as representatives of management
and implementing management policies.

And the reason for

this requirement is that there is attention in - the act
between the exclusion of. managerial and. supervisory
employees and the inclusion of professionals, and. you
have to accommodate them* the two in such a way that one
does not engulf the other.
QUESTION:

Of course* the real difficulty In

this case is more fundamental, ;^sn?t it, Mr. Come?

It

is the difficulty that is reflected by the rather Procrus­
tean effort of transferring the application of this statute S
which is tailored to meet the paradigm industrial or com­
me. aial setting to an academic institution.

That is the

basic problem here, isn’t it?
MR. COME:

That presents a —

QUESTION:

I. mean that is the difficult problem,

10
the fundamental problem.
MR, COME:

Well, that presents a problem.

How­

ever, the principle that the Board has applied here is a
principle that is well engrained in the statute and is
applicable —>
QUESTION:

Well, originally a college, as the

Latin word implies, collegium, was a collection of
scholars who went to Oxford or Cambridge or Bologna or
Heidelberg or Paris and scholars then came —- students
then came to learn from them and the faculty were the
university, they were the college, that was it,
MR. COME:

There is no question about that.

However, we submit that the modern university and college
has come a long way from the universal model, and that we
submit -QUESTION:

One way, upwards or downwards, but

I agree that it has come a long way,
MR. COME:
Appeals.

— is the erroi? of the Court of

It focused simply upon what went on in the in­

dividual •• .-lieges and neglected or at least it didn’t pay
full faith and credit to this parallel and elaborate
administrative structure of this university which is
typical of most other universities and colleges —QUESTION:

We may both agree that the present-

day university is not like Kings College in Cambridge

11
originally ws.s , but can't we also agree that teshiva
University is not like General Motors either?
MR. COME:

It is not like General Motors.

QUESTION:

MR. COME:

Or Chrysler

In

that is so good.

I’m not so sure that

In any event, in the typical industrial

plant you have what is known as a hierarchical arrangement
and it's very easy to spot supervisory and managerial em­
ployees from where they stand in the hierarchy.
QUESTION:
visor.

They give them the title of super­

That makes it easy.
MR, COME’.:

Well, it helps but the title, of

course, is not necessarily decisive,
QUESTION:

Mr. Come, in an industrial setting do

they let them have a voice in tbs selection of their super­
visors?
MR. CO?®:

Well, \X would say that it is not un~
\
usual to at least get recommendations. The administration
doesn’t have to follow its it is to their advantage to get
someone a3 a supervisor who, assuming that he is capable
of doing the job from the management’s standpoint, can work
in harmony with the rank and file* and I would say it is
good industrial relations.
QUESTION:

When Congress passed this legislation,

12
do you think they gave any thought on© way or the other as
to whether faculty members of a college were to be included?
Is there any evidence that Congress thought about it at all?
MR. COME):

Well„ certainly at the time they

passed the Wagner Act, probably not.

I think there was

considerable doubt as to th® extent of coverage under the
Commerce Clause and whether a college or university could
meet the definition of interstate commerce.
QUESTIOH:

But then aren’t you asking us to de­

cide what Congress would have thought about it if they had
given it any thought one way or the other?
MR. COME:

Well, that is not an unfamiliar prob­

lem in statutory interpretation that this Court has to
face.

The jurisdictional breadth of th© statute is very

broad.

The exempt;ions are very limited and they do not

exclude colleges and universitiesj but it Is not even that
hard because in 197*5, when Congress amended the statute to
take out the exemption for nonprofit hospitals, one of the

\

'

basic reasons why Congress did that was that it found that
there was no justification for continuing to exclude that
limited category of nonprofit institutions and they took
note of the fact that the Board had over th© years as a
result of the increased impact of colleges and universities
on interstate commerce, had been asserting jurisdiction
over colleges and universities.

So I think that we do have

13
Indication here that Congress was aware of the fact; that
the Board had been Interpreting the act to apply to colleges
and universities and was asserting Jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

The first assertion of Jurisdiction

had to do with people who were conededly employees»
Janitors and the like, wasn’t it?
MR. COME:

I believe that is rights librarians

and maintenance --«•
QUESTION:

The Cornell case, in other words.

MR. COME:

The Cornell case.

The first faculty

case was —
QUESTION:

It did not have to do with faculty.

MR. COME:

No, it did not have to do with faculty.

QUESTION:

Since I have already interrupted you,

in this case does the bargaining unit include department
heads?
MR. COME:
partment heads.

The bargaining unit did include de­

And I should say that the Board has in­

cluded department heads in some universities and not in
ethers, depending upon the facts of the extent of their
alignment with management.

The Court of Appeals did not

reach that question, so presumably if we were to prevail
i

on the basic faculty question, that would —
QUESTION:

That would still be open?

MR. COME:

That is correct.

I

However, thjat Issue
r

i

14
is involved in the Boston University case which is pending
on certiorari.
QUESTION;

The bargaining unit did not include

deans, did it?
MR. COME:

It did not include deans.

The Board

has consistently found that deans were aligned with management and excluded as such.
QUESTIONS

Wells deans generally are elected by

thair colleagues, aren’t they?
MR. COME;

They are —

QUESTION:

Or 1 suppose they are appointed by

MR. COME:

They are appointed by the president.

QUESTION:

On the recommendation of the faculty.

MR. COME:

Yes.

QUESTION:

Mr. Come, one thing that struck me

the —

about the Court of Appeals opinion was the frequency with
which it noted that the administration simply went along
with the faculty.

There appeared to be an absence of the

•-.on.:.ions to which you referred which occurred in ordinary
industrial situations.
MR. COME:

Wall, w© submit that the fact that

the administration chooses to accord great deference and
respect to the judgment of its faculty does not indicate
that the faculty is acting as management representatives

15
when they give their advice.

They have the expertise in

this area and the administration for that reason chooses to
seek their advice.

But by the same token, since In our

submission the faculty are not accountable to the adminis­
tration for the worth of their recommendations on these
faculty government questions, unlike their performance as
teachers or scholars, the administration is free to disre­
gard those recommendations and that to us is the heart of
the reason why they are not managerial employees when they
exercise their government’s functions.
I would like to reserve the balance of my time
for rebuttal.
HR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Sheoht'mari.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD H. SHEOHTHAN, ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SHECHTMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
\

Of course, joining the\argument of ray colleague,
hr. Come,

I state the issue of this case as to whether

the nature of the. authority of the faculty may exercise
| warrants their exclusion under the act.
As Mr. Justice Stewart indicated, it is indeed
a procrustsan problem in the application of the statute,
t

but it’s a problem whose solution goes to an understanding
of what the supervisory and managerial exclusions are based

16
upon, and that is in the legislative history the repeated
statement of the Congress to protect the employers from
the conflict of loyalty of those representatives who should
be loyal first to management and secondly to maintain a
balance of power in the collective bargaining relation­
ship between those employees in bargaining with the employer
and its management representatives,
In this respects I should note, again in response
to Mr. Justice Stewart, that when Congress acted in 197*1
in amending the statute with the health car© amendments,
the National Labor Relations Board had decided in 1971 and
in 1972 the Adelphi decision and the C. W. Post decision
which first dealt with the inclusion of faculty under the
National Labor Relations Act,
In fact„ as our brief indicates, these cases
were brought up before the congressional committees and
before the Congress in their consideration of'thatiegislation.
QUESTION:

Did both of those cases involve what

ore now referred to in the briefs as mature universities?
MR. SHECHTMAN:

I would believe so.

They both

are Institutions with full educational programs, with
graduate schools in place, chartered by the State of New
York, four-year programs -QUESTION:

And they weren’t proprietary or —

17
MR. SHEGHTMAN:

No, they are not»

They are not

for prof5.t chartered institutions also In the State of New
York, I might note.
QUESTION:

Mr. Sheehtman, I take it that the

Board thought it critical to find that the faculty operated
in its own interests rather than that of the employer?
MR. SHEGHTMAN:

I think that is the single

critical inquiry here.
QUESTION:

You were about to get to that, I sup-

%

pose?
MR. SHEGHTMAN:
QUESTION:

That is correct, Your Honor.

Could you tell me, give me an example

that you can find in this record of this faculty operating
in its own interest rather than of the employer.
MR. SHEGHTMAN:

I think in answer to that ques­

tion, it requires a distinction between their influence

r&f ■

than their authority and *X
QUESTION:
'

Is there some place I can read in the

.

i

record the evidence to support the Board’s conclusion that
the faculty operated in its —
MR. SHEGHTMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

Do you in your brief give record

cites In that?
MR. SHEGHTMAN:

Yes, Your Honor, In the last point

in our brief we make repeated references thereto.

One

13
example would be the recommendations of the faculty in fact
with respect to the promotion or even hiring of other
colleagues» whether a Victorian rather than Elizabethan
English historian might be appropriates whether one might
be more appropriate than the other.
What is shown in this record is notwithstanding
such recommendations of promotions» of tenure» even of
hiring.

The university adminisferation3without Input from

the faculty» froze promotions.
QUESTION:
my question.

Well» that isn’t quite responsive to

Are you asserting that the faculty's recom­

mendations about hiring new personnel are in the Interests
of the faculty rather than the university?
MR. SHECHTMAN:

I think they are In the interests

of —
QUESTION:

I take it that is the critical point.

MR. SHECHTMAN:

I believe so» and It is. in the

interest of the pursuit of their own professional excellence.
It is within their professional competence, within their
professional domain to make at least judgments as to whether
their department might be improved, their department might
be furthered by the —
QUESTION:

But you wouldn’t say that It was not

in the interest of the university, would you?
MR. SHECHTMAN:

No.

The fact that their interests

19
does not solve the Issue»
QUESTION:

But If the university hires somebody

to make recommendations to it, isn’t the faculty charged
with making recommendations in the interests of the univer­
sity?

Wouldn't that be a job description of some faculty

committee?

It wouldn’t say please act in your own selfish

Interests and not in the interests of the university,
would it?

m.

SHECHTMAN:

It would be true with the lawyer,

doctor or faculty member, with any professional who must

make a decision about how to treat a patient, who to appeal
a case, how to teach a course»

They all comport with the

interests of their employers, but then is the effect of
this case to say that no professional, because of the natur®
of decisions he may make —

QUESTION:

I am not interested in laywars or

doctors, I am interested In these professors.

Are you

saying that making recommendations for hiring that they are
not acting in the interests of the university? • And if

they aren't, are they breaching their — are they outside
their mission?
MR. SHECHTMAN:
QUESTION:

I think —

Surely, I can’t believe that there is

evidence in this record that these committees are free to
disregard in making the recommendations, are expected to

20
disregard the interests of the university.
MR. SHECHTMAN:

1 am not suggesting that.

What

I am suggesting is that they do not have any effective
authority, that they do not possess the responsibility
and authority.
QUESTION:

That is a completely different point.

MR. SHECHTMAN:
QUESTION:

I understand.

Well, let’s stick to the point we are

talking about0 whether they act in their interests or that
of the university -—
MR. SHECHTMAN:
QUESTION:

They would act -■*>

— which is the critical question.

MR. SHECHTMAN:

If they possess the authority,

tour Honor9 I must respectfully differ.
that would then become the question,

I believe that,

They do possess the

authority with respect to authority and they do act in the
interests of the employer.
QUESTION:

They make recommendations.

Now, do

you --- are you telling me that thsir job — that the
university freely lets them or does not instruct them to
act in the interests of the university?

Instead, they

consistently take recommendations and have committees even
though consistently they disregard the interests of the
university?
MR. SHECHTMAN:

I am not saying that at all.

I

21
am saying there is often a correspondence between their in­
terests and the interests of the university and that they
act In both interests, but their action does not possess
the authority as to render them either supervisors or
managers and that is what this record shows completely and
what 1 believe that the Circuit Court overlooked, and that
is where their actions, precisely in th® area you referred
to, Mr. Justice, have only authority insofar as the univer­
sity choosas to defer to them.
The record in this case shows, as I indicated,

I' ] v V •
in promotions or tenure decisions, the university will
freeze the authority for those.

In the non-renewal of a

faculty member, when it goes to a grievance committee of
.

H;

:facility, they make a judgment and then say we hay®', no
authority to resolve this matter and refer it to their
president and to their dean.
QUESTION:

Does the record show who has authority

to engage professions?
MR. SHECHTMAN:
QUESTION:

Only the president, Your Honor.

Only the president?

MR,. SHECHTMAN:

That is correct, with an inde­

pendent roviaw by the vice president for academic affairs
after interviewing by the dean and often, in some cases at
least with some origination from the faculty.
QUESTION:

Is there any evidence in the record

22

to suggest that the president has ever hired anyone without
the approval of the faculty committee?
MR. SHECHTMAN:

There is evidence in the record

to show that certain faculty or faculty committees have not
considered or acted 01 each person appointed by the president.
QUESTION.:

What about granting tenure?

MR. SHECHTMAN:

The tenure decision is made by

the Board of Trustees.
QUESTION:

Only on the recommendation of the

faculty?
MR. SHECHTMAN:

There are cases in the record

here that show that certain faculty who were recommended
for tenure were never considered by the Board of Trustees
/ or the president because the dean refused to pass; "up the
recommendation under his own choice.
QUESTION:

Well8 certainly in making tenure

rec'omroend&tiono, the university must have some standards
and expects the faculty to live up to the university stand­
ards rather than to serve the faculty’s own parochial in­
terests.
MR. SHECHTMAN:
QUESTION:

The standards that the faculty —

Is that right or not?

MR. SHECHTMAN:

That is correct, but the faculty’s

interest in those cases would be really again within pre­
cisely their professional expertise and competence, not in

23
the expertise of managerial and
QUESTION:

Furthermore, even If the faculty

doesn’t have authority and even if the president has the
final authority, that is true in the industrial establish­
ment, foremen and admitted supervisors Often don’t have
final authority.

Their bosses can overrule them at the

drop of a hat.
MR. SHEGHTMAN:

That is correct here, .but the

authority here is instead based on again an understanding
of the professional identity and the protection they are
afforded, the coverage under the act they are afforded as
professional employees.

Thus it is the faculty who can

tell their dean that -- that can best tell their dean
about the publications and the writings of their colleaguess
and even in some respects the performance in the classroom.
But in each case it will then fee the dean, it will then be
the senior vice president of this institution who .inde­
pendently reviews the facts and circumstances which might

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARVIN E. FRANKEL, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. FRANKEL:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it plf, •' }

the Court:
We all seem attracted by the procrustean myth
and the procrustean fit, even those of us who can't say if,
and I want to say briefly on that subject that we share
our friend’s view that the act is not a comfortable fit,
but we taka the position that as nearly as it could be
fitted, if you take the principles of the Board's decisions
from the industrial area and the commercial area in deter­
mining who is managerial ad who is supervisory, then it
would follow a fortiorari that the faculty of a General
Motors type university is certainly within both of these
categories and outside of the definition of employee for
that reason,
it has been said in the discussion of this sub­
ject that times have changed since the Middle Ages when,
scholars came together to think colleglally.
all agree on that.

Of course, we

But in the sense that it is pertinent

hzi'c and on the basis of the authorities from the academy
on which our friends for the petitioners rely, times have
not changed significantly at all.
The American Association for Higher Education in

25
an Important document called, importantly, "Faculty Par­
ticipation in Academic Governance,” which we think really
means management, said in the most fundamental sense the
university is the faculty.

And in the same footnote in

our brief where we quote that report, Mr. Bundy, who had
some contact with schools, said whan it comes to a crunch
in a first class university, it is the faculty which de­
cides .
low, Mr. Sheehtman has said that the faculty de­
cides ~ and this is undisputed on this record — in the
sense that its decisions on curriculum, on hiring, promo­
tions, tenture and the other fundamentals are almost always
followed.

He says the faculty decides because the univer­

sity chooses to lot them.
My suggestion with deference is that thought is
without serious moaning.

It is always true of an organiza­

tion that those who have the effective power of decision
have it because those who might take it away choose to
have it reside where it resides.
This record and the literature on both sides cite
on the briefs reflect that universities that choose to b®
distinguished or seek to be distinguished don't lot
faculties decide merely out of generosity or on suffrancs,
but because first class faculties would not stay there un­
less their interests were being heard, in having their

26
positions on governance followed or respected.
QUESTION:

On the other hand, Mr. Frank©1 * I

wouldn’t suppose that the university would so regularly
follow faculty recommendations if it thought the faculty
was acting contrary to the interests of the university.
MR. FRANKEL:

Mr. Justice, I think that is right

but, of course, one of the central issues — and now we are
told it is the central Issue on which there 13 disagreement
between the two sides — Is whether the faculty at Y©3hlva
or at similar universities does not act in the interests of
the university,
QUESTION:

The Board concluded that the faculty

operated in its own interests.
MR. FRANKEL:

Yes, it did. Your Honor, and it

concluded that without —

right, the Board would conclude otherwise, its bottom line
.

1

would be different.
MR. FRANKEL:

I think If the Board explained to

us exactly what it meant, we might know better how to
change its mind.
QUESTION:

But if the Board agreed with you that

4

27

the faculty does indeed aet on behalf of the university, it
would not hold the faculty to be emplyeess rather than
managers?
MR. FRAKKEL:

I would hope so* Mr. Justice White.

The problem that causes m© to hesitate in simply saying
yes is the difficulty in knowing what the Board is talking
about.

The Board has struggled heroically with what it

has found to be a very difficult subject.

But for all the

laboring, it has brought forth very little.

It has said

those words, the faculty acts in its own Interests rather
than in the interests of the university, but it has failed
to tell us what that could mean.

And 1 think with respect

to the difficulty with fellow counsel, there may have been
soma difficulty In answering Your Honor’s inquiry ias to

bow the faculty is acting in its own interests rather than
in the interests of the university when it says such and
su.dh course requirements ought to (be added to the degree
given by the college, or we need, a good person in romance
languages to shore up the Yeshiva College program, or we
ought to give tenure to ,?X?? or promote "Y” or regrettably
we ought not to reappoint i!Z:,
Now, those things seem to me to be managerial
and supervisory decisions of the highest order and they
are obeyed.

And when you go back to this act and you try

28
to make it fit and you discover what the Board has done
in tha settings with which it is familiar, you find that
all through industry people with much lower level, much
more constricted, narrow, confined responsibilities are
held to be managerial or supervisory when they merely
recommend decisions of the kind that this faculty is making
every day In the week, and the Board never said — and we
found looking through our records that this recommenda­
tion to promote an employee was made in the employer's
interest.

They say we find that this production scheduler,

this section chief, this expeditor or whatever is managerial
or supervisory because of what this person doss.

And the

Board I think quite properly has assumed that what the
person doss on the job day in and day out is what is meant
to be determinative and unless somebody shows otherwise
Is in the interests of the employer.
How, the Board' in its brief has tried to shore
up, to defend this notion of acting in its own interests.
:

i

* ’’ .

I want to say about that, if the Court please, because I
think it is a matter of some consequence, that this subject
which has become central on the argument, as.perhaps it
/

<

should be, is only the second of three propositions stated
by the Board in one sentence as the basis for,it's decision
in this case.

And that whole rationale is found in a

single sentence at page 68a of the appendix to the Board’s

29
petition for certiorari,

And the Board there says,

acknowledging that the faculty engages in what it calls
collegial decision-making, It says, "At Yeshiva University,
faculty participation in collegial decision-making is on
a collective rather than individual basis."

And let me

stop over that and say that that notion, if one may
respectfully call it that, urns the only basis for the
Board's first decision holding that faculty members are
employees within the meaning of the act, the only basis,
and that is the basis given in the 0. W. Post case, to
which reference has been made, and it is a basis., :! think
it is fair to say., wisely abandoned now by Board counsel
..and- seemingly by the petitioner union as well.
So the Board said, proposition one, it);.is on a
collectiva rather than Individual basis, it is exWrcised
in the faculty’s own interests^, rather than in the interests
of - the employer — a subject that we have paid a fair
amount of attention to that 1 will call the seoond- propo­
sition.

And third, final authority resta with the Board

of. Trustees.
Now, I think it is also correct to say that
that third thought relegated to a footnote in the Board’s
brief, is also abandoned and I think again soundly abandoned
because it has no visible merit.
So we are left with the second thought, that the

30

faculty can’t be deemed managerial or supervisory because
it acts in its own interests.

And on that one might argue

as a technical matter of the review of an administrative
agency’s decision, that a three-legged decision of which
two legs have been shot away is pretty infirm to begin
with.
But In any event, we go to this notion.of own
interests about which we have been talking, and I want to
say some further things about it.
QUESTION:

Mi-. Franks 1s before you do, the

Board did make that finding about this university and the
Court of Appeals didn’t agree, isn't that right?
MR. FRAHKELi
Beard said those words.

Your Honor, it is right that the
I would not believe in terms of

administrative law concepta about which we X think
QUESTION:

It said those words?

■IR. PRAMKEL:
QUESTION:

Yes.

And if you will let mo call it a

finding just for a moment, I will go ahead.

Whatever they

said and whatever it is, the Court of Appeals didn’t agree
with it.

So the Court of Appeals turned over the Board,

and the Board brought the case here, we took it, what is
our posture here?

Bo we sit as a Court of Appeals or

does the Court of Appeals — or do we have to respect the
decision of the Court of Appeals, which was in your favor?

31
MR. FRAHKEL:

Your Honor, I think the decision of

the Court of Appeals merits the respect that its inherent
cogency and persuasiveness imports and not more.

That is

to say if we go back, I think first of all we are dealing
with a question of law and not a question of fact, and
that is the only reason I recoil a little from the notion
of a finding.

The Board,, in its response to our brief

opposing certiorari, said that the basic difference between
the Board and the Court of Appeals is not over the facts
but over the legal, conclusion to be drawn from those facts,
Nov? j the ~4UESTI0IJ;

Mr, Frankel, didn’t this Court in

Pittsburgh Steamship Company say that we don’t sit in the
same posture in reviewing th® Board's findings as the
Court of Appeals does, that we must give certain dference
to the Court of Appeals and that one Court of Appeals
might find one way and one might find another and each
might be upheld by this Court?
MR. FRAHKEL:

Your Honor, that is possible, de­

pending on the nature of the case.

I would say respect­

fully that, again, to look at facts, if the Court of
Appeals has found under the Universal Camera doctrine
that findings of the agency ought to be overturned for
want of the requisite substantial evidence, I think this
Court normally would not take the case, and if it did it

32
might well pay considerable deference to a Court of Appeals.
QUESTI Oil:

Well, isn’t that what Universal Camera

stands for to some extent at least
MR. FRANKEL:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION: ■— and what cases since then have
said?
MR. FRANKEL:
QUESTION:

I think so, Mr, Justice.

Didn’t Universal Camera say-unless we

can fit it into one of two exceptions of the Universal
Camera principle, we can’t go beyond that?
MR. FRANKEL:
QUESTION:

That’s right.

And that includes

MR. FRANKEL:

But what I am saying is that this

isn’t a Universal Camera case.

This is not a case where

the Court of Appeals set aside fact findings of the Board,
I suppose it would be an easier case for us if it were
such a case, but I don’t think that is the question,

I

think this is a case ~ and here as in some other rare
instances we agree with the Board — where the question is
one of law and where Universal Camera, for example, won’t
be found cited in the Board’s brief as it shouldn’t be.
It is found in the union’s brief, but if Your Honors will
look at the portions of the brief where it is cited and
where this subject is discussed, you will discover that in
an odd sort of way Mr. Shechfcman is treating the Court of

33
Appeals decision us though it were an agency decision find
is raising the question of whether it is supported by sub­
stantial evidence.

That is a peculiar reversal of roles9

and I think it is not useful to the Court in deciding this
case.
QUESTION:

Are you saying* Mr. Franks!, that

this is a matter of whether the court simply draw different
legal conclusions from the findings of fact of the Board,
different —
MR. FRAHKEL:
QUESTION:

Yes —

— different legal conclusions from

the Board?
MR. FRAHKEL:

This is where the court made a

v :> fferent decision on a question of law from facts which
as they come to this Court ar© undisputed*

The ultimate

finding is about the powers of this faculty, the scope of
its authority, tho subject on .which it decides commonly

with finality, all of those things com® hers undisputed,
and the only question —
QUESTION:

Can I just get that a little more

precisely, because I am interested in what is fact and what
is lew here.

I take it it is fact whether the- faculty

recommends, say, a new person to be given tenure.

But are

you saying it is a question of law as to whose interests
is served by that recommendation?

MR. FRANKEL:
QUESTION:

Your Honor» I would say that --

Because they squarely say we find

that the faculty*a own intereat was served on page 68a
that you called our attention to.
MR. FRANKEL:

I would say that the Board there

is giving a conclusion which, however you try to character­
ize it, has no basis in the record.

I think they are using

in their own interests as a legal conception because they
are taking the words out of section 211 of the act which
use; those words
QUESTION:

MR. FRANKEL:

— in order to define supervisory

and they are saying these people are not supervisors under
211 because although they do these various things that are
«

the kinds of things supervisors do, they do thorn In their
own interests somehow and not in the interests of the ampioyer.
'Mow, the trouble with that, whatever you call It,
is that there is no way to say what they are talking about
to make it rational or coherent or acceptable ..or meaningful.
There is no place you can look in the record to answer the
question of hot^ would you know if they were acting in the
university*s interests or why aren’t all these things that
are really what the university is about, what the university
is in business for, why aren't all of these things as much

35
the university*a interests as a top managerial person’s
decisions of what model to bring out, what course of pro­
duction to follow, what schedule to follow, or anything
else.
What I am saying is they are words devoid of
foundation factually and I think legally.
QUESTION:

Suppose they mad© a recommendation on

the salaries to bo paid to starting professors, would that
be in their interest or in the university's Interest?

There is no question at some point

when the chairman of the manufacturing company makes- a
recommendation to the board that they go into a certain
line of endeavor that he thinks is going to be very profit­
able, and he has stock options that will not be diminished
in his vie^ by that course of action, he is furthering his
ovm interests as well.

I don’t say that you can hermetic­

There is no way of saying what that

If you look in this record, you will find ■-» and

we cited some of the places, though not all of them — that
faculty is expected to serve on committees, faculty is

expected to engage in governance, and the performance of

performance of faculty in these areas is among the factors
considered.

QUESTION:

rMr

University of Bologna,

Frank©1, going bale to the
about a thousand years ago;., -would

it i-e fair to say that what was good for the faculty was
good for the university and vice versa?

Was that the

tradition of that day?
MR. FRAMKEL:

X think in general that

it is

prior to this act, of course, but I would say in general
that would have been true.

And as X read and have read

37
for this case and in some prior incarnations„ the
of the American Association of University Professor::; and
others, I would say basically that is the view of
academicians today about the university.
QUESTION:

Well, that is consistent with the

idea that the university is th© faculty, isn’t it?
MR. FRAUKEL:
QUESTION:

It is, Mr.' Chief Justice.

Mr. Prankel, isn’t it possible that

the Board could correctly reach one result with respect to
Columbia University and another result with respect to
a law school which is the seventh proprietary school in
a large metropolitan area where each faculty member
simply comas in and bargains with the president ox-or what
his salary is going to be, and there aren’t any-faculty
committees to recommend anything?
_

MR. FRAUKEL:

' "?•*

.

Mr. Justice Rehnqulst, Lt is

possible and I would suggest that this record iliuscrates
in a couple of ways the kind of spectrum — which Is not
my word but that of th© National Educational Association
in its amicus brio? — along which .faculties fall.
There is a First Circuit ease cited in the
hre.lfs in this case involving a school called Wentworth
Institute where the faculty worked on one-year contracts,
where the faculty had a curriculum committee which the
First Circuit net

ody paid any attention to* where

30
the faculty had other committees that confined themselves
to things like sporting events, th© arrangements for
sympathetic gifts to people in th© institution who became
unwell, and things of that nature.

And so it was a

faculty that did indeed consist of employees who went in
and taught, which is a professional task, and perhaps
made their course outlines and arranged and managed their
own classroom, but did nothing about th® running of the
institution and were not permitted or expected to do that.
And. I would say that th® Board, if it corrected
its misconceptions as we see them on this subject, might
well place a WEntvrorth Instituto at one end of the spectrum
that the NEA talks about —
QUESTION:

Mr. Frank®1, in our review of what

application, whether on the record as a whole as substan.

i

which Congress has placed in the keeping of the Courts of
Appeal?

This Court will intervene only in what ought to

be; the rare instance when the standard appears to; have
been misapprehended or grossly misapplied, does that
have any relevance here?
MR. FRANKEL:

It has relevance, Mr. Justice

Brennan, to this degree — which I must answer somewhat

39
hypothetically

insofar as these words that Mr. Justice

White and I conversed about, in their own interests.

Our

thought to import .fact finding of some kind and insofar
as the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in reject­
ing that statement overturned that fact finding» this
might be a Universal Camera ease» an extraordinarily
rare kind of case,.
I must repeat I think in fairness to both sides
that it is not the basis on which certiorari was sought.
If it had been, on® might ’want to consider whether it
might have been improvidently granted, because it is not a
good Universal Camera case.

Nobody has argued really that

the decision of the Second Circuit misconceives or misap­
plies the Universal Camera test, because that is not what
the case was brought to the Court about at all.
QUESTION:

Well, what I was thinking wasn't

whether the Ourt of Appeals had misapplied Universal
/

Camera.

My question was addressed to whether that limita­

tion upon our review, namely when the standard appears to
have misapprehended or grossly misapplied since what the
Second Circuit did was refuse to enforce the Board’s
conclusion, whether that Universal Camera principle limits
our review in thin case.
MR. FRAUKEL:

Well, I have frankly, Mr. Justice

Brennan, tended to think the answer is probably no, because

I don't think that the Court of Appeals overturned agency
fact finding in the sense that I understand Universal
Camera to he concerned with.

But as has happened, I could

be wrong in this, and If Mr. Shechtman's efforts to make
this a Universal Camera case is more substantial than we
have supposed it to be, then the Court 1 think would want
to reconsHer the whole business and decide whether this
ease belongs here at all ~~ and I must say on that, that a
very imperfect cursory scarcely serutible agency decision
with a record where the first time you meet really
competent fact findings is in the Court of Appeals rather
than in the agency, one might want to conjure that question
Mow, I want to approach an end, as I think I must,
by saying another thing or two about the university.

There

has been a lot of talk in the briefs, amicus, opposing our
position about questions of policy, as they are put, speak­
ing of the university frequently

if It consisted in some

adversary way of a management, so described, meaning I
suppose the administration on one side, and a rank and file
faculty, a phrase frequently used by the Board, on the
other.

And I suppose most of us would not wish to be on

or be taught by something called rank and file faculty,
and I don’t think it is a conception that is used in this
kind of university.
But passing that, lot me say that what is left

out of those amicus briefs ar® interests that are critical
in today’s university, interests of students, of alumni,
of trustees, of eve widening publics that have, a focused
concern with the university.

Those interests are what

give point and Justification to our notions of academic
freedom.
Whenever academic freedom is mentioned on the
briefs, it seems to consist only of freedom of faculty to
resist or oppose or be left alone by the administration.
It means much more than that,
Wow, those policy questions we believe are mostly
not central to this css®.
Board in its decision.

They were not central to the

But I do want to say, because I

think the setting ought to b© clear, that if they here
and if this were a question now of legislative policy, we
would want to emphasise the view that taken by Sanford
Radish, when he was Professor Radish, now Dean of —
when he was President of the American Association of
'Uni .rsity Professors, and when he said in his presidential
address, speaking about academic freedom and problems that
concern us here, he said the process of collective; bargain­
ing raises problems in the university even apart from the
strike.

In dividing the university into worker professors

and manager administrators and governing boards, it imperils
the premise of shared authority, encourages the polarization

in interests and exaggerates th® adversary concerns of
*

interests held in common.
He went on to say that It causes loss of and
peril to the basio conception of the faculty as the pri­
mary governor of the university.
I want to add that when Archibald Cox, who
stood here very often and who prior to that had earned
some repute as a student of labor law* sat on a commis*»
sion to consider the tragic events in 1968 at Columbia*
his commission at the end mads a report that has become
fairly well known, and as part of that report, in a very
few words, Mr. Cox and his distinguished colleagues under
took to identify what they called the essential quality
of the institution, the university, and they said — and
it sounds medieval, but they said in 1968-69» "The univerT Is & community of scholars, both teachers and students.
They said more, but 1 see the read light and I thank Your
Honors.
