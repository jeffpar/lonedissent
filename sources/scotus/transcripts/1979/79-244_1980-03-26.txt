PROCEED I MGS
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear argument

next in Mo, 79-244, United States v. Salvucci and Zaekular.
Mr, Levy, I think you may proceed when you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK I. LEVY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. LEVY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may It please

the Court:
This case is here on writ of certiorari to the
United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.
The respondents were charged in a 12-count indictment
with unlawful possession of stolen mail.

The indictment

was based on twelve checks that had been stolen from the
United States mails and that were determined to bear
respondents’ fingerprints.

These checks, along with

more than 700 other stolen checks, were seised by
Massachusetts State Police officers during their search
pursuant to a state warrant of an apartment rented by
respondent Zaekular*s mother.
The indictment alleged that respondents unlaw­
fully possessed this stolen mail from late 1975 to on or
about December IT, 1976, the date on which the search
occurred.
Prior to trial, the respondents moved to

suppress the cheeks because the affidavit submitted in
support of the application for the search warrant failed
to show probable cause.

The District Court granted their

motion and ordered suppression.

The government then

sought reconsideration of the suppression order on the
ground that the respondents lacked standing to challenge
the search of the mother*s apartment.
The government’s motion for reconsideration
argued that respondents had neither a sufficient propri­
etary or possessory interest in a property seised or
premises searched to contest the validity of the search.,
nor automatic standing under Jones v. United States»
The respondents filed a memorandum'in" opposition
to this motion in which they relied solely on a claim of
automatic standing.

Following submission of the govern­

ment * s memorandum, the District Court by a handwritten
notation on the face of the government's motion reaf­
firmed the suppression orcar.
On the government's appeal, the First Circuit
affirmed.

With respect tc the issue of standing, it

found that the respondents had no actual standing to con­
test the lawfulness of the search because they had not
established a reasonable expectation of privacy in the
premises searched, or the property seized or claimed the
proprietary or possessory interest in the premises or

5
the checkso

Nevertheless, the court held the respondents

could challenge the search based on the automatic standing
rule of Jones»
Although It recognised that this Court had
questioned the continued vitality of the automatic stand­
ing doctrine and that there was a split of authority in
the lower courts on the issue, the Court of Appeals felt
obligated to adhere to the Jones rule until this Court
resolved the matter»
We submit that the Jones automatic standing
rule should now ba overturned.

Under Jones, a defendant

automatically has standing to contest a search that leads
to the seizure of evidence where possession of the seised
evidence at the time of the search is an essential element
of the offense with which he is charged»
Automatic standing turns solely oh the nature of
the charge brought by the prosecutor and it enables a de­
fendant to obtain the suppression of reliable and proba­
tive evidence even though his own constitutional rights
were not implicated in the search.

In this way, auto­

matic standing is inconsistent with the well settled
principle that the exclusionary rule can be invoked only
by a defendant who has demonstrated that his personal
Fourth Amendment rights have been violated.
The Court in Jones found that cases involving

6
possessory offenses presented a special problem that for

two reasons warranted departure from the conventional
principles of standing.

First was the self-incrimination

dilemma in which the defendant was confronted with either
foregoing the assertion of his Fourth Amendment claim or,
in order to establish standing,, giving incriminating
testimony as an admission could be used in the govern­
ment’s case in chief to prove his guilt at trial.
As this Court observed in Brown v. United
States, this self-incriruinafcion dilemma can no longer
occur in light of the subsequent decision in Simmons v.
United States that a defendant5s testimony at a suppression
hearing cannot be introduced as part of the prosecutor’s
direct case at trial.
We believe that Brown correctly concluded that
the self-incrimination dilemma is no longer an issue after
Simmons»
QUESTION:

So there is no issue here about other

grounds for standing here, such as an Interest in the
i

premises or being a guest on the preraises?
MR. LEVY:

There is. not.

The respondents were

not present at the time pT the search and they have never
in the course of this proceeding asserted that they had
any basis for actual standing.

Indeed, respondent

Zackular in his brief in the Court of Appeals and in this

7
Court I think expressly concedes that they have no actual
standing, and there is nothing .in the record tc support
the claim of actual standing.
Hence, as the Court recognised in Brown, the
continued validity of the automatic standing rule rests
solely on the second rationale in Jones, the so-called
vice of prosecutorial self-contradiction whereby the
government alleges the defendants’ possession as an es­
sential element of the defense charge but denies that
there was possession, sufficient to establish the de­
fendants’ standing to contest the search.
In our view, the automatic standing rule cannot be justified on this ground.

It is not Inherently

c©n trad eitory for the government to charge a defendant,
with a possessory offense based on his culpable conduct
prescribed by the penal code and at the same time to con­
tend that he had no legitimate expectation of privacy
\

that was implicated by the search that uncovered the il­
legally possessed items,
QUESTION:

Mr. Levy, it is actually the de­

fendant that brings a suppression motion, not the govern­
ment, isn’t it?
MR. LEVY:

That5 s correct.

QUESTION:

So the government is just advancing

arguments as to why the suppression motion shouldn’t be

granted.
MR. LEVY:

I believe that is correct, and I

think the holding of Jones is that the government is fore
closed from contesting the suppression motion on the
ground that the defendant didn’t have standing fco raise
it.
QUESTION:

Does that really make much sense?

MR. LEVY:

Me don’t believe that it does.

This

is most clearly illustrated in cases where the defendant
is charged not with actual possession at the time of the
search but rather is charged with constructi

or

vicarlous possession.
For example9 a defendant who exercises dominion
or control over contraband, even though it is not in his
actual possession, has engaged in conduct that the
criminal law rightly condemns and he is subject to prose­
cution for a possessory offense under a theory of con­
structive possession, but that fact standing alone is not
tantamount to a concession by the government that the
defendant’s Fourth Amendment rights were affected by the
search of e, third party’s premises or property in which
he had no legitimate expectation of privacy.
For example, consider a defendant who without
permission conceals contraband narcotics on the property
of a stranger with the intention later to reclaim the

9
drugs and sell them.

If the police Illegally enter and

search the third party’s property and seise the narcotics,
it can hardly be thought; that the defendant's Fourth
Amendment rights were infringed for he had no reasonable
privacy interest in the place that was illegally searched*
In these circumstances, it would be fully proper for the
government to charge the defendant with unlawful posses­
sion at the time of the search and yet object to his
standing to Beck the suppression of evidence on the basis
of the illegal search.
Another example suggested by the decision in
Rakas v. Illinois, in which the Court held that the de­
fendant's Fourth Amendment rights were not violated by
t

the illegal search of the ear in which they were riding.
The defendants in Bakas wore charged with armed robbery.
If, however, they had been prosecuted and convicted with
the, unlawful constructive possession of the rifle that
was found during the course of the search, it is diffi­
cult to see that their suppression claim would be en­
hanced in the slightest or that the government would be
acting in a contradictory fashion by prosecuting on that
charge while denying that the defendants could challenge
the search under the Fourth Amendment.
QUESTION:

Mr, Levy* could I ask you a question.

Suppose the defendants in this ease contended, that the

10
checks had been duly endorsed over to him or some such
claim pursuant to which he claimed some rightful entitle­
ment to the cheeks, would he have standing (a) to ask for
their return, and (b) to object fco the search in the
third party's premises?
MR. LEVY:

Well, we think if he had standing at

all it would not be under the theory of automatic stand­
ing.
QUESTION:

Well, I am not asking about the

theory, I am just asking what your position is.
MR, LEVY:

If he could establish that the checks

were his and that they were —
QUESTION:

He alleges they are his.

MR, LEW:

Well, he would file a motion under

Rule 4l of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure for
the return of property,

He would need to establish more

than simply —
QUESTION:

So you agree he would by chat alle­

gation have standing to seek their return?
MR. LEVY:

I agree.

QUESTION:

Would he also have standing by that

allegation to object to the search of the premises in
which they were found, by Illegal conduct of the police?
MR. LEW.':

I do not believe so.

It seems to me

there are two distinct interests that are protected by the

11
Fourth Amendment.

One is against unreasonable searches -

and the other is against unreasonable seizures QUESTION:

So your argument doe&n7t depend, at

all on the contraband character of the items that the
police seised?
MR. LEVY:

We hare a secondary argument that

relies on the contraband character, that if this Court
contrary to our argument should conclude that the de­
fendants 5 legitimate interest in the property seised does
entitle him to challenge the search, then that rule would
be' .inapplicable where the defendant was in possession of
contraband material such as narcotics or stolen goods.
QUESTION:

But you do not agree that even If

he had title to the property, say it was a gun and he
claimed it was registered arid he acknowledged he owned
it and so forth and there was nothing Illegal about Its
possession and it was taken out of a third party’s
premises, that would not give hiss standing to challenge
th© search of those premises?
MR. LEVY:

Thatfs correct, we do not think that

would give him standing to challenge the search.

It

might give him standing to challenge the seizure if he
alleged there was something -—
QUESTION:

yes.

He would ask for his property hack,

12
MR* LEVY:

That's correct, or h© might be able

to seek suppression at trial on the basis that the
seizure rather than the search was unlawful if he had a
ground for challenging the seizure of the gun in your
hypothetical, Mr, Justice Stevens.

But we think that is

a distinct matter from his ability to challenge the search
that led to the a si sure of the guru
QUESTION:

Well, what ground could he claim

the seizure was unlawful?
MR. LEVY;

Well, if —

QUESTION:

If he cannot challenge the search,

which would b© the only basis as I understand your
MR. LEVI:

Well, there may be some basis on

which a seizure itself could be challenged.

For example,

if the incriminating nature of the evidence were not. iia~
msjdi&fcely apparent under a plain view doctrine, for
ex&ispi® —
QUESTION:

Oh, I see.

MR, LEVY;

— or if the police were entitled to

seize something temporarily as a. means of protection bur.
they retained the item longer than was necessary, there
might be some grounds for challenging the seizure itself
apart from the search that led to the seizure.
One way to see we think the absence of any
prosecutorial self-contradiction in the automatic standing

13
■situations is to ask whether the defendant would be en­
titled to pursue applicable remedies other than the exclu­
sionary rule such as a damage action for the assertedly
unconstitutional search.

We think it plain that in the

hypotheticals I mentioned a few moments ago that the de­
fendant would not be awarded monetary damages since his
Fourth Amendment rights were not violated by the illegal
search.
For the save reason, he should not be able to
invoke the exclusionary rule remedy, and that conclusion
is independent of the nature of the charges brought
against him*
Thus, wo think that the Jones rationale or
prosecutorial self-contradiction does not support the
continuation of the automatic standing rule.
Apart from the two rationales of Jones itself,
the respondent, S&lvucci, contends in his brief that the
automatic standing rule can be Justified by reference to
principles of actual standing.

Salvuccl argues that a

defendant’s possessory interest In contraband that is
seised entitles him without mere to seek suppression of
that evidence on the ground that the underlying search
violated, the Fourth Amendment,

Sa3.vu.cei then argues

that the charging of a possessory offense necessarily
constitutes an admission by the government that the

defendant has the requisite possessory interest in the
seised contraband to enable him to challenge the search
and therefore that the automatic standing rule should be
retained to avoid the needless formality of an inquiry
into standing at the suppression hearing.
We submit that this line of argument is entirely
unsound.

In our views as I just discussed with Mr,

Justice Stevens» a defendant's proprietary or possessory
interest in items seized does nos in and of Itself entitle
him to contest the validity of the search.

Moreover,

regardless of the general rule, an asserted possessory
interest in contraband, such as stolen property, is
totally illegitimate and cannot served as the basis for
a Fourth Amendment challenge to either a search or a

seissurso
Finally, even if a possessory interest if* .
contraband could suffice to confer standing with respect
to the search, the automatic standing rule still would
not be warranted, since not all possessory interests
should be considered adequate but rather only those in­
terests that establish a sufficient personal nexus be­
tween the seised contraband and the defendant.
First, a defendant's proprietary or possessory
interest in the items seised does not in its© -x entitle

him to challenge the legality of the search,

Salvucci’s

15
argument to the contrary reflects a misconception of the
Fourth Amendment53 protections against unreasonable searches
and unreasonable seizures„
A search is defined under the Fourth Amendment
in terms of a governmental Intrusion upon a person's
legitimate expectation of privacy.

It depends not on a

property right but, rather» or a reasonable privacy in­
terest.

A seizure of a physical objects on the other

hands is defined in terns of a. governmental interference
with the bundle of property rights that attends a person's
interest in or relation to that object.

It Implicates

precisely those property rights that a person has by
virtue of his ownership or possession of a given object.
Under this analysis, a proprietary ©r possessory
interest in items seized could give rise to standing to
challenge the validity of the seizure, since it was the
act of seizure that dispossessed the defendant of iris
property.
QUESTION:

The government has a right of ©min­

ent domain, I take if, in any of these cases, that it
could seize items and pay for them?
MR. LEVI:

X think that would satisfy the Fifth

Amendment taking problem.

I don’t think the government

here purported to seize items under its eminent domain
power or would be willing to pay for the items that they

16
found to be unlawfully seized.

The government here is not

asserting that as items seized it is a transfer of title
to the government if it was an item that the defendant was
entitled to own» but rather than the government is entitled
to temporary possession for use of the item in th©
criminal proceeding against the defendant.

I think it is

a different problem than a taking issue that might be
posed in other circumstances„
The defendant *s Interest in his property9 how­
ever» even if allowing him to challenge the seizure,
would not entitle him to challenge the antecedent search
of a third party's premises in which by hypothesis the
defendant has no legitimate expectation of privacy*

Nor

can standing be based on the proposition that a defendant
has a cognisable privacy interest in a place simply be­
cause his property is kept there.
Me acknowledge that in some circumstances a
defendant who stores his property in the premises of a
third party may have & sufficient privacy interest in
those premises to challenge a search.

On the other* hand5

not all such uses of a third party's premises' would demon**
strate a privacy interest.

For instance» if the de­

fendant Illegally entered someone's home and without the
knowledge or permission of the owner concealed Incriminating
evidence in the basement» he should not be heard to

17
complain that his reasonable expectation of privacy was
infringed if the police unlawfully search the basement for
that evidence.
Likewise, if the defendant simply asks a third
party briefly to keep something for him, without anyunderstanding as to the particular location of where it
would be kept or the need for it to be securely and pri­
vately stored, then we doubt that the defendant has an
expectation of privacy in the place where the third party
eventually decides to put the object*
In these cases, the pertinent inquiry is not
whether the defendant had a proprietary or possessory in­
terest in the items that were seised but whether taking
into account all relevant considerationss including his
use of the area to store his belongings s the defendant
had a legitimate expectation of privacy with respect to
the area searched.
The fact that the defendant5 s property was
legitimately on th® third party * s premises does not by
itself give him a privacy interest in those premises,
■

just as in Rale as the defendant's legitimate presence in
the car that was searched did not by itself entitle him
to challenge th® legality of the search.
We do not think that the decisions of this
Court.compel different analysis than the government

18
presents here.

In particular9 we do not read United

States v. Jeffers to be a contrary holding.

We believe

that the defendant’s standing in Jeffers was based onhis
interest in the hotel room that was searched.

He had a

key to that room* he had permission to use the room at
will2 and in fact he often entered, for various purposes.
This was clearly an adequate ground on which to find
standings and we don’t think that the Court’s opinion in
Jeffers is best understood to rest on a possessory in­
terest in the items that were seised.
QUESTION:
theories in Jeffers»

Mr. Levy, there were actually three
I am sure they are hinted at in

different parts of the opinion.

One of them was this

theory of when a search is directed at a particular de­
fendant»

I don’t understand that theory as being involved

in this case at all.

Is that correct?

By directed at,

do you understand what I mean?
MR. LEVY:

Yes* I do.

QUESTION:

That theory isn't presented in this

case at all, is it?
MR, LEVY:

It hasn't been raised in this ease

and I think the Court rejected It in Rakas.

I am not

aware of whether the police officers at the time they
conducted this search were subjectively seeking the
evidence against the defendants or others»

I think —

19
QUESTION:

There is no claim of that kind, Is

MR. LEVY:

There is no claim of that kind here.

there?

To the extent that standing in Jeffers was based
on the property that was seised, which we think is not the
best reading of the opinion, the Court indicated that
it declined to separate the search and the seizure because,
in the Court’s words, they were bound together by one
sole purpose, to locate and seise the narcotics of the
respondent.
QUESTION:

Is there ever any different separ­

able purpose in searches and seizures?
MR.» LEVY:

There conceivably could be if entry

Is made to search for incriminating evidence against one
defendant and other incriminating evidence against the
second defendant -QUESTION:

Well, if you find other evidence not

in the warrant, but then you have other problems, don't
ycif. if you have a warrant?

I just didn’t understand

•

■ >•*.*

■},

•your separation point«
MR. LEVI:

I think that the Court’s reliance

on that theory is- as Mr. Justice Stevens just suggested,

a variant of the target theory which was rejected in
Rakas.

We think that is the basis on which the Court

declined to separate the search and the seizure.

To that

20
extent, we think that Jeffers has already been discredited
by Rakas and doesn't present a controlling view of the
Fourth Amendment *
In any event, to the extent that Jeffers rested
in some other way on a defendant's interest in the items
seised, we submit that it is inconsistent with subsequent
doctrine that clearly distinguishes between an unreason­
able search and an unreasonable seizure and therefore it
sas no longer be regarded as controlling.
At this point, I would like to reserve the bal­
ance of my time.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIE J. DAVIS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT SALTTOCCI
MR. DAVIS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the- Court:
Twenty years ago, when this Court decided Jones,
it did so on two very distinct grounds which we contend
h&vfs not been changed since that time.
•

V •

f

.

As far as; the
T

• •

’

i

vice of prosecutorial — well, let me put it this way:
All of the cas-es that have been decided by this Court
and most of the cases relied on by the Solicitor General
in seeking cert in this case did not involve a situation
where possession was an essential element of the crime.
And it is our decision in presenting the matter to the

21
District Court and the Court of Appeals that we should
separate the two types of crimes,, that is, one we call the
possessory crime, and one a non~possessory crimeWe have no quarrel with any decision of any
court where they rely on the invasion of one’s own pri­
vacy to establish standing where the crime is aonpossessory»

But we submit that Justice Frankfurter was

absolutely correct when speaking for a unanimous Court In
Jones, that where you have this possessory crime, that
this ought to set it apart, it ought to be separate and
distinct.
Now, If we chose not to —
QUESTION:
saying that, though?
MR. DAVIS:

What reason did the Justice have for
What reason did he give?
Because the government would he

.allowed to talk out of both sides of its mouth In a
possessory crime.
QUESTION:

Also his statements could be used

against him.
MR. DAVISs
QUESTION:
MR. DAVIS:

That’s correct.

That’s correct.

Can it be used against him any more?
Well, let me put it this way:

W@

say. that Simmons does not overrule Jones in this respect.
I .

i

We submit that Simmons only applied to non-possessory
crimes.

As a matter of fact, the Court in Simmons

22
explicitly said that.

They explicitly said that they re­

solved the problem of possessory crimes with Jones, and
now we go on to the non-possessory crimes ~
QUESTION:

Well, what if we said in this case

that his statements couldn’t fee used against him?
MR» DAVIS:
QUESTION:
MR. DAVIS:

Well, 1 still say it is not enough.
Why is that?
It is not enough for the simple

reason that if he were to take the stand at a motion to
suppress and to admit having possession, then it would
lead the prosecution perhaps to some evidence that he
could use in his direct case without the testimony of the
defendant coming in at the trial»
For example, what if the prosecutor asked the
defendant at a hearing on a motion to suppress, where
did you get the stolen checks, and. the defendant said I
get them from Sam Jones.

The government no-* has a lead.

They can go talk to Sam Jones and Indeed perhaps present
Sam Jones in their direct case in anticipation of a de­
fense presented by the defendant.
QUESTION:

But it is the defendant’s motion to

suppress, not the government’s.

MR. DAVIS:
QUESTION:

Sure it is.
So the defendant is certainly talk­

ing out of both sides of his mouth.

23
MR. DAVIS:
QUESTION:

The defendant is what?
The defendant would certainly be talk­

ing out of both sides of his mouth*
MIL DAVIS:

Oh, no, he would not.

Ho, he would

The defendant would take the stand at a motion to

suppress and say, yes, I did have possession of them.
That Is not talking out of both sides of his mouth..

He

is admitting it, and I am saying that his admission could
later be held against him,
QUESTION:
MSL DAVIS:

But he isn’t pleading guilty —
Mo, he is not pleading guilty but

he
QUESTION:

-- not guilty, he says 1 didn't have

possession.
MR* DAVIS:

If he took the stand and said I

didn't have possession, that is entirely another matter.
We don’t say that he has a right to take the stand at
any hearing and lie.
QUESTION:

But when he pleads not guiltys it

puts all the material issues and material elements in

issue*
ME, DAVIS:

It does, and he simply says by

that I did not commit the crime as charged, and this
crime has, as all of the proof, more than the element
of possession.

You go further, the element of possession

with knowledge that the checks were stolen.

Now, he

could certainly admit at a motion to suppress that he had
possession of the cheeks and then go on to say* yes, but
I had no criminal intent because I didnft know they were
stolen, I received them from Sam Jones who said, to mes
heys take a look at what 1 have here, hold this for me,
or anything like that.

That is not and cannot h® prose­

cuted under the particular statute because he didn't
possess it knowing the checks had been stolen,

that his personal rights were violated.

That is why we

Suppose & parson is accused of the

possession of stolen goods and the officers retrieved the
stolen goods by breaking into a house without a warrant
and seizing the goods, but the house didn’t belong t© the
defendant and the defendant didn’t claim any interest in
the premisess he mows to suppress.

Well, I guess under

your approach he would have standing to raise it but he
would lose.
MR. DAVIS:

No» I wouldn’t say that he had auto­

matic standing under those conditions unless possession
was an essential element of tho crime.
QUESTION:

Nell, he was accused in the indict­

ment of stolen property.
MR, DAVIS:
propertyo

All right, possession of stolen

All right, possession is an essential element

of the crime, so 31 think that that in and of itself gives
hiss automatic standing because the government has said
he possessed it,
QUESTION:

All right.

So you would say then he

should win his suppression motion?
MR. DAVIS:

Yes, on your theory, because the

search was positively unlawful,
QUESTION;

So the standing rule means that he

can win the suppression motion even though the .goods, were
seized in somebody else’s house.

27
MR. DAVIS:
QUESTION:

It?s only right under- Jones„
Wouldn’t you agrees Mr. Davis, that

both Alder-man and Rakas significantly questioned the auto­
matic standing rule, and Brown too?
MR* DAVIS:

I do not read them

No, I do not,

as questioning the automatic standing rule because all of
those cases did not apply to a crime where possession was
an'essential element and we have to rely on that.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN C. McBRIDE, ESQ,,
ON .BEHALF OF RESPONDENT ZACKULAR
MR. McBRIDE:

Hr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The facts and the law enunciated in Rakas, the
facts and the law enunciated in Simmons and in Brown, do
not, I most respectfully suggest, undercut the theory
that ws &r® advocating today.
We, the respondents in this ease, are asking
the Court to uphold the decision, the stare decisus
enunciated by Mr. Justice Frankfurter In Jones v.
United States.

In Rakas f decided in December 1978 by

this Court, the Court was confronted with defendants

29
charged, with armed robbery»

They were not charged with

unlawful possession of the shotguns and of the shotgun
shells that were found respectively inside the glove com­
partment that was locked and Inside the ear9 underneath
the front seat that was discovered by the police,,
I submit most respectfully that there might
have been a different result if they were charged with
unlawful possession of those particular items.
QUESTION;

Don't you think Judge Jarm thought

that the matter was in considerable doubt in the ©pinion
of the First Circuit?
MR. McBRIDE:

I certainly think he did, Your

Honor, in light of the opinions of the many circuits
that have construed Jones in different respects, and I
think most respectfully it is time for this Court tdj re-

affirm —
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will-resume .

there at 1:00 ©*clock, Mr» McBride.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGEE:

Mr. McBride, you may

pick up where you left off,
MR. McBRIDE:

Thank you.

Mr, Chief Justices

and may it please the Court:
Before the luncheon recess, I was addressing my­
self to the cases of Rakas, Simmons and Brown.

.1 submit

most respectfully that those three eases do not undercut
Jones v, United States,

Jones is liable now. 'Those

cases, especially the Rakas case is limited to Its.: facts0

concerning the viability of Jones.

Jones»
QUESTION:

Or to overrule it.

MR, McBRIDE:

I agree wholeheartedly, Your

Honor, but the point that has not been raised or has
been raised but not directly answered by my brother is

31
the issue of the prosecutorial self-contradiction,.
In this particular case, the government would
seem to have the best of both worlds„

At one point in

time, they are saying that defendant Saekular does not
have standing to attack the validity of the search be­
cause he was not in possession or had no reasonable ex­

i

MR» MeBRlBi:

Automatic standing protects the

defendant, four Honor*
QUESTION;

( *

Well» why should it?

MRa McBRXDS:

The answer to your question Is

the defendant„ especially my defendant9 Mr. Zackular,
did not testify at the motion to suppress hearing

32
because I felt at the time, in reliance upon Jones, that
we had automatic standing to assert a violation of our
rights,

1 did not want Mr, Zaekui&r tc make a statement

at the motion to suppress hearing., full well knowing
that under & Simsions coiitezt it couldn’t be used against
him substantively on the issue of guilt or innocence but
in light of Jones we were constricted at that time by a
search pursuant to a warrant that was governed by the
four corners of the affidavit in the search warrant at
that time, and in light of Jones 1 felt strongly that
my client should absolutely exercise his right to remain
silent and not say anything because 'he was given the
benefit of the automatic standing rule enunciated, by
Judge Frankfurter in Jonas,

In term of speaking out of both'side» of his
mouth, if you advocate the prosecutor's position*.- in.
answer to your question, Your Honor, then the prosecutor
would have my client get on the witness stand and testify
yes, I lived with my mother, or yes 1 had some type of
proprietary or possessory interest in the house in
Melrose where the checks were found.

Clearly, if he

testified at trial, he has to testify consistently with
this.
QUEST!OMr

Hell, your client doesn’t have to

testify at all at trial, as 1. understood the response to

33
Mr- Justice White*s question.

Simply by pleading not

guilty> he puts in issue, that is he deni.es the allegation
of possession,,

QUESTION;

Do you think it helps the Jury or

Judge to determine the truth of the charges brought

against the defendant?
MR, McBRIDE:

Well, that is not the purpose of

a motion to suppress* to determine the truth.

The Judge

at this Juncture doesn’t determine truth* as you well
knows Your Honor.

He determines whether or not the ex­

clusionary rule has been •violated.
QUESTION:

Do you think the automatic standing

rule helps in the long run a jury ©r fast-finder to de­
termine the truth of the charges brought?
MR* McBRIDE:

It may not help a jury but the

automatic standing rule is not for the jury to assess.
It Is up t© the judge at pretrial to dispose of an Issue
and determine whether the exclusionary rule hm been
violated.
QUESTIQK:

But the automatic standing rule

does permit the defendant to take advantage of a viola­

MR. McBRIDE:

Well* Judge Frankfurter said*

Yoter Honor* that the defendant isn’t given

the unjust

advantage at that time* the prosecution was given the

unjust advantage by getting the best of both worlds and
they should not have the benefit of the best of both
worlds.
QUESTION:

That my bes but the reason that the

defendant could rely on the violation of somebody else*®
rights is that they didn’t want to put him to the trouble
of claiming his own rights because it could be used
against him at the trial»

If he claimed that he himself

had an interest in the premises or he himself had m in­
terest in the goods seized, that might be used against
him at the trial and he shouldn’t be put in that dilemma.

MR. McBRIDE:
QUESTION:

Clearly.

I as a little puzzled by this ”who

gest the special advantage.”

Isas51 a motion to suppress

evidence inherently a motion to suppress the truth?
Isn’t that the very function of it?
MR. McBRIDE:

The very function, I submit, of a

motion to suppress is to insure and make sure that the
police do not violate constitutional rights.
QUESTION:
myself to.

That is not what I was addressing

The operational function of it is t© suppress

some of the truth that is likely to be or may be used
against him.

It isn’t necessarily all of the truth, but

It is some truth that he does not, the defendant does net
want the ^ury to know about, otherwise

he wouldn’t move

to suppress, would he?
MR. McBRIDE:

Mr.- Chief Justice, I have trouble

with your question because you say that a motion to sup.V

press is seeking to suppress the truth.

I don’t say for

a. minute that a motion to suppress is used to suppress
the truth»

I say that it Is being used to suppress con7

stltutional violations of the defendant’s Fourth Amend­
ment rights.
QUESTION:

But the purpose of it is to prevent

the evidence from being adduced at trial, so presumably
you tfouldn't do it unless you thought the evidence was

37
relevant and material and probative.
MRo McBRIDE:

It certainly could be relevant

and materialj, in this ease especially » since there were
fingerprints found» latent fingerprints found on the checks
that were discovered at the mother’s house.

It certainly

could be probative of the defendant's gui.lt or innocent g

one, the search warrant was invalid, and there 1» no ques­
tion about that; and, number two, that the defendants,
Mr. Zackular and Mr. Salvucci, had standing to assert a

been done vicariously.

It may have

The search may have violated Mrs.

Zackular's rights to her reasonable expectation of pri­
vacy, but the very nature of the charge, i.e., unlawful
possession of checks stolen from the mail, most respect­
fully confers automatic standing on the defendants to
assert a violation of his motion to suppress.
QUESTION:

May I ask you, in a ease like this,

how does a motion to suppress proceed?
MR. McBRIDE;

Well, when we were up before

Judge Garrity in Boston, four Honor* the Judge was bound
to —
QUESTION:

You made the motion to suppress?

MR. McERXDB:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Then what happened?

MR. McBRXDE:

And we went before Judge Garrity

and the Judge was bound by the four corners of the affi­
davit.

At the very motion to suppress, nothing was

39
brought up concerning the defendant’s standing to assert
a violation of the motion to suppress.

There was argu­

ment made -*~
QUESTION:

Did the defendant ever take the

stand at that —
MR* McBRIDE:

No, sir.

The prosecutor and the

defendants simply argued on the basis of the affidavit
and produced the affiant, Trooper Bellanti, who testified
to certain facts, but basically Judge G&rrity found, as
you can see from a reading of the appendix, that the
'affidavit did not contain probable cause *

tod only

after, at a later did* approximately three to four-- we eke
later did the government ~~
QUESTION:

/;

Do you think that Jones, if the

Jones case had involved facts like these, the Court
would ever have decided it the way it did, where the
defendant wasn't going to say & thing or ever admit ;a

; ; j4f !

thing, Just on the four corner» of a — there wouldn't
have been any occasion to say anything like what they
said In Jones, would there?
*(

MR. McBRIDE:

¥©11, that Is because Jones was

limited to Its expressed facts, namely Mr. Jones being
present ~~
QUESTION:

I know, but the danger that Jones

averted to was something the defendant might say at the

suppression hearing that might he used against him at the
trial.

Here you make the motion and say the warrant was

deficient.

He doesn’t testify, and nothing can foe used

against him at the trial.

Do you think Jones would ever

have set automatic standing in a situation like that?

1

would have thought they would hove said this affidavit»
warrant doesn’t relate to any property that -» it relates
to your mother’s property or your brother’s property or
your friend’s property.
MR. McBRIDE:

Again. Your Honor, my answer to

that is Jones was limited to the case where a person on
the premises* as long as he was reasonably on the
premises9 had a right to assert a motion to suppress,
Rakas, of course s the test in Rak&s is whether you had a
legitimate expectation of privacy in that particular
ease as passengers in an automobile.

Here we are in a

different position because the crime charged is a dif­
ferent crime.

It is possession. Your- Honor.

Again,

the vice that this Court can protect against is the
vice of prosecutorial self-contradiction, Your Honor,
and 1 submit that to overturn Jones would be to give
the government the best of both worlds in saying on the
one hand that Mr, Sackular has no standing because he
has not shown any possessory interest, and on the other
hand to say that he is guilty of unlawful possession of

41
checks found at his mother’s house*
QUESTION:

Ms*, McBride, how do you respond to

the alternative argument the government makes that standing
as we use the terra doesn’t really turn on possession at
all. It turns on Invasion of a privacy area rather than
even if you had ownership of the article you would not
have standing, according to their alternative argument „
to object to an invasion of the home In which you have
no privacy interest.
MR. McBRIDE:

Well, I submit — I disagree

with that one-hundred percent.
QUESTION:

Is there any ease holding that

ownership of an item is sufficient to give you standing
to object to a search of premises in which you have Fio
privacy interest?

MR? McBRIDE:

MR. LEVY:

self by having that very testimony thown in his face
before the jury.

Wasn't that it?

MR. LEVY:

That was one of the rationales re­

lied on in Jones a that's right.
QUESTION:

Isn't that the basic rationale?

MR. LEVY:

Ye believe It is.

QUESTION:

What did the motion say In this case

»

HB
to suppress?
MR. LEVY:

The motion as I recall was very brief

and simply alleged that the warrant was invalid on its
face.
QUESTION:

Of course? the motion itself against

our ordinary Fourth Amendment cases is In itself an asser­
tion that I am entitled to suppress this evidence.
MR,, LEW:

I think that would be inherent as

part of the filing of a motion»
QUESTION:

But that assertion can’t be used,even

. that limited assertion can’t be used against him at trial.

QUESTION:

Hr. Levy, may I ask you e. Question.

We ' ve talked a lot about Rakas $ in your view is your
position consistent with the position taken by the
dissenters In Rakas?

MB, LEVY:

I believe it is,

I think there was

no disagreement on the Court about the test to be applied.
QUESTION s

Because the dissenters placed stress

on the privacy aspect, the expectation of privacy, la
that right?
MR, LEW:

ThatTs correct0

QUESTION:

There is no claim in this ease of

that which the dissent in Rakas focused on, there is no
privacy claim In this case»
MR. LEVY:

That's correct.

QUESTION:

It is Just the automatic stasidihg

part of -Toner-?

MR. LEVY:

Is it not a fact that the majority

the absence of a property Interest in the automobile?
MR. LEVY:

Well —

QUESTION:

So doesn't the majority actually

cut more against you than the dissent does in the Rakas
ease?

MR. LEVY:

I don't believe so.

I think ©hr po­

because as I read the majority opinion in Rakas, the' —
QUESTION:

But the extent that you contend that

a property interest in the property is irrelevant»

There

In

tha majority opinion that is inconsistent

with your view.
MR* LEVY:

it is totally irrelevant.

Our position is that it Is not

I think there may he circumstances in which

the property ■—
QUESTION:

How could it ever foe relevant to the

legality of the invasion of privacy which is caused by an
improper search?
MR* LIVY;

One consideration in assessing the

expectation of privacy is how the property was used*

To

the extent it was used to store one’s possessions*, then
that is a factor to foe taken into account in assessing
the privacy interest.

It is not a dispositive factor,,

but I think it is one factor among many that could he
considered by the Court in evaluating th® defendant’s
expectation of privacy.
QUESTION:

You would agree that the majority

attached greater significance to property than the dls~
senders did in Rakas?
MR* LEW:

1 read the Rakes majority simply to

leave open the question of the effect of a property in­
terest »QUESTION:

Well* you don’t think that the

passenger in Hakas had been a part owner of the car* that

51
he would have had standing?
MH» LEVY:

I5m sorry, I didn't understand.

QUESTION:

Suppos® the passenger in Rak&s had

been a part-owner of the car, would you have thought he
still did not have standing?

You only have standing for

the driver, would that fee your view?
MR, LEVY:

Mo, he might have standing In that

ease, but that goes to a different property interest.
That is the property Interest in the area that is
searched, like the suitcase in Arkansas v. Sanders.
That does not gc to a property Interest in the items that
are seised, and that is the basis —
QUESTION:

Well, wouldn’t that have been the

critical fact as in Rakas the passenger did not have
standings, but if he had been a part owner of the car,
presumably he would have had standing so therefor®
doesn’t that make ownership the critical test under the
Rakas approach on which you seem to rely?
MR. LBV?:
that far,

Well. I don't think that Rakas goes

But in any event, Rakas was concerned only

with the property interest in the area that was searched.
I think that Is an entirely different question than a
property interest in the Item seized as. a basis for supproa sing the evidence obtained during the search.
In answer to your question before, Mr. Justice

52
Stewn3j there is only one case of which X am aware,
United States v, Mazaelli, from the Minth Circuit* that
deals with th® question of a possessory interest in the
item seized as a sufficient basis for challenging — that
:

holds that a possessory interest in the item seised is a
sufficient basis for challenging the search»
QUESTION:

!

There is another case, you know, that

deals with the problem.
MR. LEVY:

There are many cases that deal with

it 2 including your opinion in United States v„, Llsk.
Ma&zelli is the only one of which I am aware that goes
the other way,, and that is presently pending before? the
Court on our petition for certiorari under the name of
■

Conway,

Other than that, I mn not aware of any cases

I; that have so held.

We would also like to emphasize that the argu^
mehte that w® present In our. reply brief are applicable
{

not only to the automatic standing issue that is presented
in this case but are also fully applicable in cases 'Where
the defendant claims actual standing.
In particular, we believe that the defendant
in Rawlings v, Kentucky, which is- to fee argued In tandem
with the instant case today, does not have actual -stand­
ing simply because his property interest in the items
that were seised from his companion’s purs®, that basis

53
by itself in our view does not. suffice to establish his
Fourth Amendment standing for the reasons set forth in o®
reply brief.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case Is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 1:27 ©’’clock p.m., the ease in
the above-entitled matter was submitted.)
