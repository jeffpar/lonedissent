ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. D. VICKERY, ESQ.,

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

6

MR. VICKERY:

7
8

We will hear arguments

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
We are here today to reconsider on reargument the

9
10

meaning of the term ’’maritime employment” as this term was usee

11

by Congress in the 1972 amendments to the Longshoremen’s and

12

Harbor Workers Compensation Act.

13
14

15

in light of the past statements of this Court and particularly
of the most recent decisions of this'Court involving two
individuals named Caputo and Blundo.
Surprisingly enough, there is much common ground

16
17

18
19
20
21

22
23

We are here to consider it

with respect to the facts of the situation involved in these
two cases.

Neither Ford nor Bryant were longshoremen by

tra.e or occupation.

Neither of them were amphibious workers.

Neither of them were subject to being assigned to work in
whole or in part on the navigable waters of the United States.
They were involved in the same physical task of the
same physical type of work, the loading or the unloading of
la;*: d transportation.

They were not involved in longshorlng

24

operations which the Secretary of Labor had defined for safety
25

i?

!

and health purposes at least as being the loading and the un­

Z

loading of vessels.
The work done by Mr. Bryants who was the cotton

3
4

header, removing cotton from a dray wagon in the port of

5

Galveston, had been confined to the land exclusively and

6

totally for a period of approximately five to six years prior

7

to his injury.

8

not been an amphibious worker of any kind.

So for at least this period of time he had

Worker Ford who was employed in the port of Beaumont

9
10

and was securing a military vehicle onto a railroad car in

11

order that it might proceed inland to an Army arsenal, was a

12

laborer who during the year immediately prior to his injury

13

had engaged in several different tasks of a laborer.

14

worked approximately 39 days as a warehouseman, doing the same

15

type of work that he was doing on the date of this accident,

16

working entirely ashore, not in any way subject to assignment,

17

to work on the navigable waters of the United States.

I

He had

He had worked only seven dayis as a longshoreman
during this year, the period of time, that is in actually
loading and unloading cargo from vessels.

During the balance

of this period of time he had served as a truck driver for a
beer distributor and he had worked as a construction worker
in and around the Beaumont area.
While neither of these two workers meet the maritime
employment test which is now required of them after the 1972

5
1

amendments, both of their employers met the maritime employ­

2

ment test which was required of the employer since 1927, that

3

test being that the employer must have some employees who

4

perform a part of their 'work on the navigable waters of the

5

United

i

tates.
Mr. Bryant's employer in Galveston was a steamship

6
7

agency.

A steamship agency performs functions for the vessel’s

8

master when it arrives in port such as helping to clear*
customss immigration, public health, doing shore-side things
for him.

y

In connection with that, therefore, the agency has

to have some employees who will from time to time go on the
navigable waters of the United

tates.

!
It had no longshoring operations of any kind.
Bryant's employer never loaded or unloaded any vessels.

Inso­

far as Mr. Ford Is concerned, he x«ras working in a warehouse
division for P. C. Pfeiffer Company.

That company also has a

steamship agency similar to the one that Mr. Bryant’s employer
harv performs the same functions for vessels.

It-did, however,

have the additional division in which it also performed steve­
doring operations.

It had not performed, however, any steve­

doring operations at all, any longshoring operations with
respect to the cargo that it was working on at the’ time of
Mr. Bryant's injury.

It was performing its duties pursuant to

a contract It had with the Port of Beaumont to load cargo that
had been brought into the Port of Beaumont on vessels aboard

25

'6
1

land transportation for movement into the inland areas of the

2

United States or to unload land transportation if the cargo

3

was outbound and destined to be loaded aboard a vessel. In

4

both instances, there was no vessel at the dock at the time

5

of the injuries sustained by these two men.

S

The question has been put sharply in focus in the

7

briefs before the Court and it turns on, as I previously in­

3

dicated, the meaning of the term "maritime employment1' as

8

used in the Longshoremen's Act.
In the 1970 enactment originally of the Longshore­

10
11

men's Act, Congress drew the line for maritime employment

12

insofar as employers were concerned at the water’s edge.

13

They drew it there on the basis of two earlier decisions of

14

this Court. Jensen v. Southern Pacific held that a longshore­

15

man performing work on the navigable waters was engaged in

IS

i

maritime employment.

Knickerbocker also followed and held

17

;

precisely the same thing.
In 1922, this Court in a decision Involving a man

18

19

;

named Nordenholt held that a longshoreman handling cargo on a

20

:

dock, longshoring operations on a dock were not maritime

21

employment.

22

basis of Jensen and Knickerbocker that all of the loading or

23
24
25

The courts of New York had concluded on the

unloading of a vessel constituted maritime employment and was
therefore within the jurisdiction, the admiralty and maritime
jurisdiction of the United States and had denied relief under

7
t

its state compensation act.

The Supreme Court reversed and

2

held that the New York courts had misread the Court’s

3

opinions and that in fact the handling of cargo on a dock

4

with respect to the loading and unloading of vessels was not

5

maritime employment and therefore was subject to the juris-»

6

diction of a state workmen’s compensation act.

7

S

This was the

meaning of the state law and the meaning of the term "maritime
employment” when the act was initially passed in 1927,
The question then is did Congress do anything to

9
10

change the definition or to change the meaning of "maritime

11

employment” in the 1972 amendments.
QUESTION:

12

Did you in that little historical review,

1.3

did you tell us which case it was that estab.lished the twi­

14

light zone concept?
MR. VICKERY:

15

later.

No, sir.

Yes, sir, that came in the late thirtie 3

All right.
I should perhaps mention that within

four years after the Longshoremen’s Act was passed, this

I
i

8

\

question of what constituted maritime employment was put

2

squarely to this Court in a railroad cast involving a rail­

3

road man named Nogara, and the Court held that because he was

4

injured while working on a car-float that he was engaged in

5

maritime employment and his exclusive remedy was under the

6

Longshoremen’s and Harbor Workers Compensation Act and denied

7

any rights to recover under the Federal Employer’s Liabi3ity

8

Act.

This was reaffirmed by this Court in O’-Rourk in 1953.

9

Subsequent eases have reaffirmed the principle of O’Rourk and

10

11

as late as 1971 in Victory Carriers v. Law, this Court held

12

that Nordon Holt had not been overruled and it was still good

. "si

lav;:a that work on the docks, the loading and unloading of

13

vessels is not maritime employment.

14

#

;

When we come to the 1972 amendments, in trying to

1

m
16 ;

determine the congressional purpose, in trying to determine

17

why they required for the first time in 1972 that a long-

tS

.

shoreman meet the maritime employment test, we have to look

19 !i

primarily to the legislative history, that they were talking

2.0

about the historical definition or the traditional meaning of
maritime employment was confirmed by Senator Williams of New
Jersey who, as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Labor of the

22

Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, and having his

23
12

24 j

staff put together a legislative history of the 1972 amend­
ments, he wrote a very brief foreword.

;
!

He states in this

9

t
■

1

foreword that the principle feature or one of the features of

2

the 1972 amendments was the extension of the act’s protection

3

to shoresid© work of those engaged in the traditional maritime ;

4

employment covered by the act*
The intention was to cover shoresid© work of those

5

6

workers who met the traditional definition of maritime employ-

7

merit .

That is shoreside work within the limits

of the situs test under the statute?

case.

Both of these injuries occurred in the

situs covered by the act?
MR. VICKERY:

ing area within the meaning of the statute.

That is correct.

QUESTION:

And so no one working within the situs is

covered unless his duties at some time include or part of

his duties include going back and forth on a ship?
MR, VICKERY:

I have suggested that the statute in­

5

dicates that persons working ashore who are not subject to

And regularly so.

MR. VICKERY:

Yes, sir.

So he doesn’t have to be going aship,

because he is covered by another part of the statute, you say*

1

he is engaged in longshoring operations.

3

MR. VICKERY:

4

QUESTION:

5

Yea, air.

So you can be engaged in longshoring oper­

ations without going on a ship.

6

MR. VICKERY:

Yes, sir.

But you can’t be in maritime employment

MR. VICKERY:

No* sir* he Is not and. clearly is not.

I think for longshoring operations that the courts have
looked to the definitions of longshoring operations that the

13
Secretary of Labor had promulgated in connection with the
safety and health regulations under the Longshoremen's Act
itself.

He specifically describes longshoring operations as

being the loading and unloading of vesselss and that is what
it says.
QUESTION:

Well, certainly some sort of line has

going to have to be drawn which Congress didn’t draw by simply
not defining longshoring occupations.
QUESTION:

We are not involved today in this ease,

as I understand it, in the definition of longshoring opera­
tions but, rather, with the definition of maritime employment,
is that correct?
MR. VICKERY:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

Well, isn't that where some line has to
.

be drawn?

3

MR. VICKERY:

The statute specifically refers to

longshoreman or other person engaged in longshoring operations
as being included within the meaning of the term "maritime
employment."
QUESTION:

But we are talking

MR. VICKERY:

Even if they clearly don't meet by

technician, by stipulation, these men are not longshoremen.
The government attempts to say that the loading or unloading
of land transportation is a longshoring operation.

This .

Court held in Caputo that loading and unloading trucks is an

14
old fashioned process of doing just that and is not the loading
and unloading of vessels.

And I submit to you that the loading

and unloading trucks and railroad cars do not meet any
semblance of the definition of longshoring operations.
QUESTION:

Mr. Vickery, I have some problem.

If

longshoring even when carried on entirely ashore is an example
of maritime employment, as I think you have conceded, then the
test of maritime employment cannot be the Jensen line.
MR. VICKERY:

The test of maritime employment has to

be. I submit, Mr. Justice Stevens, insofar as every other
worker who is not engaged in longshoring operations.
■

QUESTION:

Everything except longshoring is divided

at the shore?
MR. VICKERY:
QUESTION:
reads.

Yes.

Well, that is not the way the statute

It talks about a person engaged in maritime employ­

ment, including any longshoreman.

So a longshoreman is a kind

of person engaged in maritime employment —
MR. VICKERY:
QUESTION:

That's correct.

~~ even though his work is entirely

ashore.
MR.
VICKERY:
*

That’s right.

What Congress was trying

to do was to provide a uniform compensation system for- those
workers on the waterfront who crossed the Jensen line, that
is the water's edge.

That was the jurisdictional dividing

15
line between the state and the federal statutes in 1972.

What

Congress was concerned about was providing a uniform compensa­
tion system for those employees 'who had to cross that Jensen
line, do some of their work on the water is what qualifies
them as maritime employees, being subject to perform part of
their work on maritime water makes them covered by these 1972
amendments and makes them engaged in maritime employment.
Congress wanted to provide uniform remedy for those

l

I

■

who are covered for a part of their activities prior to 1972
and they did it by adding a requirement that these people,

r

other than those specifically named in the statute, would have
to meet the maritime employment test just like the employer
had to meet it from 1927 to 1972, and it uses precisely the
:

same statutory limits.
QUESTION:

Do you therefore also take the position

then that a harbor worker, ship repairman and so forth is
•covered even though his work was entirely ashore?
MR. VICKERY:
QUESTION:

Yes.

And those would still be examples of

marltIme amployment?
MR. VICKERY:

Yes, sir, I believe so and those terms

are also specifically defined by the Secretary of Labor xvith
respect to the safety and health regulations for those par­
ticular industries —- shipbuilding, ship repairing, and ship
working.

.

16
QUESTION:

Well, as I read, it, I think we are get­

ting a little far afield
here.

I think from the issue involved

But the way I read the statute, it is that the term

"employee” means any person engaged in maritime employment and
any harbor worker, as though they were different.
MR. VICKERY:

I think the word "including" relates

to the worker, the harbor worker as well as the ■—

would imply that to me, however.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER BUSCEMI, ESQ,,
PRO HAC VICE
MR. BUSCEMI:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The question presented In these cases is whether two
Texas marine terminal workers either within the scope of their
employment while handling cargo on the docks are covered by
the Federal Longshoremen and Harbor Workers Compensation Act
as amended in 19?2.

In practical terms, the issue is whether

the injured workers will get the benefits of the insurance

:'V

required by the federal statute for the employees within its
coverage or will be restricted to lesser benefits' provided by
■i

the insurance required under the applicable workmen’s compen­

§
sj t.;

nt sation code.
■ -a U:j

• jmi
!i?i,::

■m

The 1972 amendments to the Longshoremen’s Act
suc’ceded in eliminating some of the Inequities that arose
under the act as originally passed, but in doing so it raised
net questions of statutory interpretation at least as trouble­

7.-1

m

■,

■- •:■:$ .
■>"ni ; :

'

some as those presented by the 1927 act.

\i

In particular, in defining the statutory term
"employee," Congress used several broad phrases that have
been left without further definition in the statute.

Although

18
the 1972 legislative history offers some guidance, it stops
considerably short of providing an exhaustive catalog of the
coverage and exclusions of the amended statute.

Indeed, the

arguments in this case are clearly shown if the statements
in the committee report seem to look in different directions
and to support the conflicting interpretations of the revised
• f

act.
With respect to Ford and Bryant, the injured workers
in this case, the director’s position is that they are
covered under the act because they are marine terminal
workers whose job it is to handle cargo between

land and sea

transportation and who were injured while performing those
duties.

They are indeed in maritime employment and they are

engaged in a particular sub-set of maritime employment known
:

as longshorlng operations within the meaning of the statute.
Whatever may be the case with respect to persons
who do not

ordinarily handle cargo or persons who are in-

■ Jured when they are doing something other than handling cargo,
1

■ persons in the positions of Ford and Bryant fall squarely
within the group of employees that Congress intended to cover
by the 1972 amendments.

The petitioners argue, however, that

Ford and Bryant are not covered by the amended, statute because
they were not subject to assignment aboard a vessel on the
date they were injured.
I would like to proceed first by discussing what we

3o

believe are the deficiencies in the petitioners' —
QUESTION:

Well» isn't it a little more than that?

How many days a year had they done any type of longshoremen
work?

It was just a few days, wasn’t it?
MR, BUSCEMI:

Justice Burger.

Only in the case of Ford.» Mr, Chief

Ford worked as a stevedore for seven days

in the previous year.

He worked as a terminal worker moving

cargo on the dock for 39 days during the previous year.

He

also had several other Jobs including a truck driver and con­
struction worker.
Bryant, on the other hand, was a cotton header and,
as far as I know, a cotton header only for the last five or
sir. years s had been moving cotton bales around at the pier
warehouses at the Port of Dallas.
QUESTION:

Long after they had left the ship.

MR. BUSCEMI:

Yes, that’s true, and that is the

same fact that was true in the Caputo case in which Mr.
Cap ito moved sheeting after it had been standing on the dock
for five days.
Now, the first and most finite problem with the
petitioners* test is that it is not found in the language of
the statute.

The definition of "employee" says nothing about

whether a worker is subject to assignment aboard a vessel on
the day he is hurt.

And the particular phrase "longshoring

operations" does not- suggest that any person engaged in such

20
operations must be subject to assignment aboard a vessel.
Indeed, if I understood him correctly, Mr. Vickery
just said that he did not believe that a person had to be
subject to assignment aboard a vessel.
Secondly, the petitioners* test does not accord
sufficient weight to the underlying purpose of the 1972 amend­
ments which was the expansion of the act’s coverage.

The

petitioners rely heavily on the fact that section 2(3) of the
amended act, the definition of "employee,” defined employee as
a person engaged in maritime employment and then goes on to
list several examples.

The petitioners seise on that phrase

"maritime employment” and argue that its meaning should be
ascertained from a series of cases decided by this Court long
before the 1972 amendments, at a time when the Jensen line
still covered, and the definition of "employee" did not even
mention the phrase "maritime employment," since it provided
that certain people were not included within the term
"employee."
The critical question in those cases was not whether
the employee was engaged In maritime employment, but whether
he was injured on the navigable waters of the United States,
because it was thought, it was held in the 1927 act that only
persons injured on the navigable waters of the United States
were covered employees.
The statutory definition of "employer" under the

21
192? act did include the phrase "maritime employment" but it
was modified by the additional phrase "upon the navigable
v/afcers of the United States," and that was a surprise because
the act only covered injuries occurred on the navigable
waters and so quite naturally it covered an employer as only
one who had employees who were working on those waters.
The petitioners' insistence on interpreting the
maritime employment as used in the current definition of
"employee" by reference to cases decided under the original
act ignores the basic purpose of the 172 amendments, to move
the coverage of the act shoreward in the Jensen line.
The term "navigable waters" is defined to include
?! piers, docks, terminals and other adjoining
f:

MR. BUSCEMI:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

So the area in which this accident oc­

curred must then be an area that Is customarily used for
loading or unloading vessels?
MR. BUSCEMI:

Absolutely, no question about it.

The new definition of "navigable waters" does not
only appear in section 3(A) of the amended act, the section
that describes the coverage to cover injuries.

It also ap­

pears in section 2(4) of the amended act, the definition of
employer.

A statutory employer is now an .employer in which

his employees are employed in maritime employment in whole or
in part upon the navigable waters of the United States, in­
cluding any adjoining pier, wharf, drydock, terminal, or
other adjoining areas.
QUESTION:

Well, that was almost necessary in order

to reach the expanded situs which everybody agrees was ex­
panded In the 1972 law.
MR. BUSCEMI:

My point, Mr. Justice Stewart, is only

23
that maritime employment as is used, in the amended act in­
cludes employment on the navigable waters and also on the
adjoining piers, docks, wharfs, terminals and other adjoining
areas.

MR. BUSCEMI:

If the petitioners are right and

maritime employment includes only work on the waters, not on
the adjoining areas, the statutory definition of "employer”
makes no sense.

There is simply no such thing as maritime

employment on the navigable waters including the adjoining
pier.
QUESTION:

We11, if Caputo is right and there is

both a status and a situs test and it is conceded that the
situs test is met here, what would be examples of people who
would meet the situs test as it is met here but who do not
meet the status test in your view?
MR. BUSCEMI:

Well, the first example is given to

us in the congressional committee report, which is printed in
Footnote 2? of the Court's opinion in Caputo.

The congres­

sional committee, both the House and the Senate committee say
an employee whose responsibility is only to pick up stored
cargo for further transshipment would not be covered, nor
should the cargo employees whose jobs do not require them to
participate in the loading or unloading of cargo.
QUESTION:

Well, would transshipment of already un­

loaded cargo then be different than simply depositing of
cargo that would ultimately be loaded a couple of weeks later
so long as they both met

the way it works on the dock, but I think that is probably
correct, that the truck driver probably would not be covered

in those circumstances.

truck on the situs.

When is such a person covered and when

is re not, assume he is employed by an employer*, a statutory
employer?
MR. BUSCEMI:

Well, I think that the coverage deals

with the loading and unloading of cargo from a boat or from a
ship, and I think when you are talking about the trans­
shipment over the road or over the rail, you are no longer

talking about the loading or unloading of cargo from the ship.
The loading or unloading ends at the —~ let’s say the unloading ends at the time that the cargo is given over to some

the Court's opinion.

That appears at page 273 of

It appears in several places in the

Court's opinion, but in particular at page 273*

The Congress

in its committee reports made it clear that truck drivers are
not covered, they were not one of the occupations that was
within the contemplation of the definition.
QUESTION:

Now would Inspectors, nor would a

consignee's inspectors, for example?
MR. BUSCEMI:

I presume not.

I would think the third deficiency in petitioners’
approach is that It treats marine terminal employees perform­
ing identical tasks differently, depending on the

fortuitous

circumstance of whether their job description entailed the
possible assignment aboard a vessel.

They consider three

types of work on the dock.
The committee report explicitly mentions the first
type, unloading cargo from a ship and immediately transport­
ing it to a holding area on the pier or to some mode of land
transportation-*

The committee reports clearly establish that

any employees engaged in such operations are covered by the
act5 irrespective of whether they are assigned aboard a
vessel.
The petitioners’ response is that employees perform­
ing such work are in fact subject to assignment aboard a
vessel, usually or always.

But that doesn’t mean that Cortgres

32
viewed the potential for such an assignment as s. prerequisite
%

for coverage under the act.
QUESTION:

I thought the petitioners' position on

that was that those are persons engaged in longshoring opera­
tions —
MR. BUSCEMI:
QUESTION:

Well, the —

—- which are explicitly covered by the

statute.
MR. BUSCEMI:

Right, and that is what we believe

Ford and Bryant were.
QUESTION:

Yes. I know, but I thought that was what

the petitioners
MR. BUSCEMI:

Weil, today is the first time I knew

about that.
QUESTION:

Well, maybe it is the first time I knew

about it, but that is the petitioners' position.
QUESTION:

Well, doesn't anything that qualifies as

a longshoring operation have to be within the definition of
war3ime employment ?

MR. BUSCEMI:

Yes.

The second kind of marine terminal worker illustrates
the anomalies created by the petitioners’ test is the stuffing
of containers.

The committee reports show that one of

Congress’ xna.jor concerns in enacting the ’72 amendments was
the advent of modern cargo handling techniques, and the Court

33
recognized that point in Caputo and repeated the Second
Circuit's statement that stuffing a container is part of the
loading of a ship even though it is performed on-shore.
Workers who stuff and strip containers are covered by the
act, whether or not they are subject to assignment aboard a
vessel.
The petitioners don’t disagree, as shown in their
brief at page 37 in Note 713 but they recognize that this
treatment of staffers and strippers is Incompatible with the
subject of of assigned tasks.

They argued that Congress in­

tended to create a stuffer and stripper exception to the
general rule, but we submit that the point is that the
general rule is wrong.

There is no such general rule that

•only employees subject to assignment are covered.
Now, the final kind of marine terminal work that
demonstrates a problem is the work that was performed by
Caputo and Ford, and. we have already talked about that,
I would Just like to address one final problem
with petitioners' test before addressing the criticisms of
the director’s test.

The petitioners read the word "long­

shoreman" out of the statute.

I think that points was demon­

strated in the original argument of this case.

They come

close to conceding as much on pages 32 and 33 of their brief.
The statute by its plain language covers two kinds
of workers, longshoremen and persons engaging in longshoring

3^

operations.

Longshoremen, if they are hurt on a covered

situs, a dock, a pier or other area adjoining the water, are
covered under the act.

Sven if what they are doing at the

time of the injury does not fall in the common understanding
of longshoring operations, the act focuses on occupations, as
the Court said in Caputo.
Also this is one of the reasons why the director
believes that the Powell decision, pending in a petition for
a writ of certiorari from the Ninth Circuit, is wrongly sited.
Powell was and is a longshoreman.
QUESTION:

But is there or is there not any conten­

tion in this case that either of the respondents is a long­
shoreman?
HR. BUSCEMI:

No, Mr. Justice Stevrart.

I was just

using this as an example to demonstrate one of the problems
with the test that the petitioners have followed. .
QUESTION:

But these respondents, each of them is

concededly not a longshoreman.
MR. BUSCEMI:

That’s correct, air.

Now, the .director’s interpretation of the statute
has the advantage of being consistent in both the expansive
purposes of the 572 amendments and the common understanding
for the kind of work that constitutes longshoring operations.
As Judge Friendly .said in his opinion to the Second
Circuit in the Caputo case, if Caputo’s injuries had occurred

35
while he was moving the boxes of cheese from a previous posi­
tion on the pier to the consignee's trucks and not actually
on the trucks as he did, he clearly would have been engaged in
unloading in the way that term is used in ordinary speech.
The Second Circuit made the statement notwithstanding the
fact that the cheese had sat on the dock for five days before
Caputo moved it.
The obvious implication is that Ford's work was also
unloading, and Bryant's work was loading as the congressional
committees use those terms.
In light of all of this, then, how can the director's
test be criticized?

Well, primarily on the basis of the first

sentence which this Court quoted from the committee report in
Note 27 to the opinion in Caputo.

The sentence says:

"The

intent of the committee is to permit a uniform compensation
system to apply to employees who would otherwise be covered
by this act for part of their activities."
The petitioners contend that this sentence represents
thorough and indeed an exhaustive description of the purpose
and effect of the 1972 amendments.

The argument is that if

Ford and Bryant were doing what they were doing on the date
they were injured, they could never have been covered by the
Longshoremen’s Act before 1972 because they never would have
gone aboard ship and the 1927 act only covered injuries
i

occurring on the navigable waters, because persons performing

35
the work of Ford and Bryant would not have been covered by
the 1927 act at any time during the course of their work day,
the argument continues, there was no uniformity problem under
it
i

the original act,

Such persons are covered by state workmen’s

compensation, therefore, the petitioners conclude, the ’72
amendment could not have had any effect on persons in Ford
and BryantTa position because they were never part of the
}

problem that Congress was trying to solve.
Now, this argument has some superficial appeal but
on balance we think it is unpersuasive essentially for the
reasons stated by the Court of Appeals on page 41, Note 21
in the petition for a writ of certiorari in this case.

There

is uo reason to assume that in enacting the *72 amendments
Congress did the minimum that was necessary to deal with the
problem primarily responsible for the act’s revision.

This

is especially so because, as we have just argued, such a
minimal measure would have created new inequities equally or
nearly as bad as the ones that existed under the 192? act.
Moreover, as the Second Circuit observed in Its
opinion in Caputo, the Senate committee report on the ’72
amendments states that Congress had an additional purpose in
addition to its primary goal.

The Second Circuit said the

Congress also expressed interest in extending federal cover­
age to as many longshoremen as possible to avoid a disparity
in benefits payable to the same type of injury depending on

the state in which the accident occurred,

That appears at

F 2d, page 5^> Note 23, and in the same committee report
at page 12.
In short, by enacting the 1972 amendments, Congress
hope to effect a comprehensive resolution of the coverage
questions concerning longshoremen and persons engaged in long
shoring operations as well as all other forms of maritime
employment,
The fact that Ford and Bryant were not part of the
most immediate problem that motivated Congress to act when
it did does not mean that they necessarily fall outside the
coverage of the amended statute.
QUESTION:

Yet Congress did. not go a fairly simple

way to the route you stated it wanted to go by simply defin­
ing the test in terms of situs.

If it had said nothing

about status and situs test, all that you say that the Senate
committee said it wanted to accomplish would have been aecomp
11shed, a simple test would have been there, obviously they
didn't mean to have it that simple and they may have kept it
more restrictive.
MR. BUSCEMI:

They did not go as far as they might

have, there is no question about that.

They focused on long­

shoremen, the status as a longshoreman was a person engaged
in the performance of longshoring operations for purposes of
this case.

Those were the relevant words.

It is true that

38
they did not go as far as they could have.

They could have

covered the clerical employee, they could have covered the
truck driverj they could have covered the consignee’s in­
spector — they didn’t.
QUESTION:

Let me get one thing straight.

Do you

acknowledge that these two men are not longshoremen?
MR. BUSCEMI:
QUESTION:

Right.

Do you take the position that they were

engaging in longshoring operations?
MR. BUSCEMI:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Okay.

That is what I thought you would

say.
MR, BUSCEMI:
QUESTION:

Finally, I just want to say that —

I thought your position was that they

were just engaged in maritime employment generally.
MR. BUSCEMI:

No, Mr. Justice Stewart,

Our position

is —
QUESTION:
ment

Well, you must concede that your argu­

is that they were engaged in maritime employment.
MR. BUSCEMI:

Yes, but Mr. Justice Stewart just

asked whether our position was that they were only in mari­
time employment and not within the additional phrase "a
person engaged in longshoring operations."
QUESTION:

But are you conceding that they aren’t

engaged in longshoring operations and they aren’t coi?ered in

3o
this case?
MR. BUSCEMI:

I am not conceding that, Mr. Justice

White, but our position is that they are engaged in longshor­
ing operations and there is no reason to look any further*.
QUESTION:

All right.

MR. BUSCEMI:

Finally, as this Court said in Caput©,

this act is remedial legislation and the courts should take an
expansive view of its extended coverage, especially so when
such review corresponds with the consistent administrative
interpretations by the agency responsible for the &et?s en­
forcement.
The Court of Appeals properly followed this prin­
ciple and its Judgment should be affirmed.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.

Do you have anything

ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. D. VICKERY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS — REBUTTAL
MR. VICKERY:

Gentlemen, as I started my rebuttal

argument in March, I start it again today:
two sentences of the legislative history.

Look at the last
It categorically

reaffirms the adoption by Congress in 1972 of the maritime
employment status test that I am talking about.

It expressly

says an employer who has no employees who work on navigable
waters is not engaged in maritime employment and is not a
eov red employee.

There are employers in Houstin, in the

Port cf Houston who hire men to load and unload land transpor­
tation who have not one single employee who ever goes on the
navigable waters of the United States.
The last two sentences of the legislative history
categorically says that those companies are not employers
within the meaning of the act and therefore are not engaged
in maritime employment.
QUESTION:

Mr. Vickery, would you help me.

Why are

not these two men engaged in longshoring operations?
MR. VICKERY:

operations —

It was
This is

what longshoring operations are in the Secretary of Labor* s
views, not In the view of the Solicitor's department who

QUESTION:

The Secretary’s definition Is based on

MR. VICKERY:
QUESTION:

Sir?

The Secretary*s definition is based on

the point of rest, Is that right?
MR. VICKERY:
QUESTION:

No, sir.

Anything beyond the point of rest would

not be longshoring operations

42
MR. VICKERY:
that is correct.

It would not be longshoring operations

What the federal respondent In this case is

contending is longshoring operations, for example, in a port,
the vessel from which the military vehicle was unloaded two
to seventeen days

prior to his injury, put it- on the dock,

in storage there.

It was moved into the rail car the da;/

before this man was hurt.

He was hurt securing that military

vehicle on the railroad car.

That vessel had already sailed.

The government's position in this case is that
longshoring operations of loading and unloading of a vessel,
as the Secretary of Labor described it, is still in progress
when the vessel Is gone to the high seas.

And if it came

from the vessel 17 days before his injury, that vessel might
even be in Europe taking on new cargo and yet the govern­
ment fs position here is that it is still being unloaded in
the port of Beaumont.
I submit that the loading and unloading of land
transportation simply is not longshoring operations, and the
Court said so in Caputo.

Caputo was loading a truck and the

Court said in Caputo that that is an old fashion process of
lading a truck and that is all it is.

And to try to converd

that into longshoring operations simply because it occurred
on an area adjoining navigable waters is ludicrous.

Who

would walk down to the dock the day Ford was taking Cotton
off of the truck or the day that Bryant was taking cotton off

of the truck or that Ford in securing the military vehicle on
a railroad car, who would walk onto the dock and, say look at
that man unloading that ship over there.

They would have

said look at the man unloading the truck and look at the man
securing cargo on the railroad ear.

It is common ordinary

usage of the terms and they clearly indicate that the loading
and, unloading on land transportation is not covered under the
1972 amendments.
As to the extension of the definition of navigable
waters to include all of the adjoining area, just let me
refer you to Footnote 59 on page 25 of our written brief.

In

addition, the last two sentences also confirm that that ex­
pansion of the area relates to situs only and not to status.
Also as to people who are- not covered but would be
covered under the act, look at the four sentences from the
end of the legislative history.

‘The committee, does not intend

to cover employees who are not engaged in loading and unload­
ing vessels on navigable waters simply because they are in­
jured in an area adjoining navigable waters.
let me say in closing just one other thing, and
that is with respect to this Court's doctrine that the act
must be liberally construed in conformance with its purpose.
I have lived with this for some thirty yeasr in my practice
and I would be the last to say that you ought to throw that
aside.

But in construing in accordance with the congressional

44
purpose which was to eliminate s. non-uniform compensation
remedy for those workers who cross the Jensen line, and that
was all.

Everybody else had been ana still has a uniform

compensation system.
The Court must also be mindful of the fact that you
are dealing in ths.t very delicate area of

federal encroach­

ment on state jurisdiction, and I request that the Court take
a look at and consider what it said in Victory Carriers v.
Law which was a case arising under this act.

The Court said

there that our regard for rightful independence of state
governments which should actuate federal courts requires that
they scrupulously confine their own jurisdictions to the
precise limits with a federal statue as defined.
Conform with the congressional purpose, yess but
■with due regard to the encoraehment on the State Wr kitten's
Compensation Act.

The only

non-uniform remedy prior to 1972,

the only evil Congress sought to correct related to those
employees who crossed the center line in the course of their
employment.

Everybody else on the waterfront has a uniform

compensation remedy.

All Congress tried to do was to cover

thooe who crossed the Jensen line.
I respectfully submit that our suggested test is in
keeping with statutory language and it is faithful to the
legislative history.

It is faithful to the liberal construc­

tion of the statute i^hich this Court has indicated and I

respectfully submit that it should be adopted.
Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The ease is submitted.

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
