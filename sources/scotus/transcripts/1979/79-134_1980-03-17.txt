And 2 want to- turn to the

6

restriction.
How, the Virginia Pharmacy case that this Court
decided in 197S specified exactly what the eleisants of a
proper, time and place' and manner restriction are.

And

there are three -— three requirements» all of which sansfc be
present.
Th& first requirement is that the restriction of
speech must not be based on the contents of the speech, it
.

• i.-

must fo@ content neutral.
The second requirement is that the restriction must
serve a significant governmental interest.
had the third requirement is that in imposing such
a restriction there must be ample alternative channels of
communication left to the facility or left to th© speaker to
communicate his views.
Me say if the Court please that this

that the

court In saying that this was not a content-based regulation
committed a fun daman t?al error.

The restriction applied, to

controversial mattes# of public policy and, in particular, the
I

QU3ST13Hs

Bow did they define "controversial

mattars"7
MRo BLOCK:

?J?hey dicl not; they did not define it.

When we challenged this order by a petition for rehearing they
said that they would give us advisory rulings If we would

7
cost® to thezs end ask them whether something was coatroversial
or not.

But at least it didn’t purport to prevent

you fro® putting in a bill an advertises»®at that you had a

■

v

:

How, we did-sot appeal fro* that part of .the 'ordar•
Other' utilities did, Including Central Hudson which is be for©
the Court ia: the second case.
The promotional advertising involves this matter of

8

encouraging people to use store electricity at a time when
conservation should fee the keynote.

That is something that is f

involved in the bill insert order as such although it may be

1

a controversial matter within the scope of the bill insert
prohibition.

But there is a separate prohibition that i©

subject to e separate appeal that ire do not regard that issue
as being involved* particularly i» the bill Insert case.

The

Commission doer not want us to speak out on controversial
matter© and that, as 1 say, stay «re 11 include promotion.

But

we have no — as far as C©c ildieou is concerned our desire
i
is to speak out on serfs issue© as whether some ©£ our plants
should fo© permitted to burn coal instead of high-cost imported
oil so that see can not only save our customers some money but
can reduco this Ration;is dependence on foreign oil,, which is
i
a ria&y supply
and one-? that ;<ss* do not
feel comfortable living
;
i

•with,; because it can b'

ret pit at any time.

Another isstfe that w© think is important 'te oar
cusfcejsfers and to our business is what is the future of nuclear
power how that there h:as been an accident at Three -Mile Island
and ar lot of investigation.

then can threw them away.

QUESTIONS

Very well*

' Mr® Schiffo
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER H. SCHIEF, ESQ* ,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE

VR. SCHXFF:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;

This case was initiated, before the Commission by
a complaint of consumers of Consolidated Edison who were
members of the Natural Resources Defense Council and other
groups and name individually who complained of basically an
infringerer.t of their First Amendment rights when Consolidated
Edison had published their views on the merits of nuclear
power; and request was made that the persons who had opposing
views be given an opportunity to present their views in a
subsequent bill insert of Consolidated Edison.
QUESTIONS

Suppose they include in the mailing not

the- views of Consolidated Edison as such but the views of
Admiral Kickover or some other scientist or some energy
expert, would that be barred too?
MR* SCHXFF*

Well, I think, Your Honor, that

23

if -- yesI think the Commission has barred the use of the
billing envelope from dissemination of controversial subject
matter views.

One of the reasons for this is that the

Commission is very much concerned that -the bill inserts
be used for messages specifically related to the needs of the
customers who are paying for these bill inserts and that there
is limited space involved.

So that- as

X-

will discuss a little

bit more later» one 'of'the alternatives that the Commission
had before it» which Mr. Block has not addressed himself to
at all» is the possibility of opening up the billing packet
as a general forum for controversial views.

That posed seme

additional problems» there were still some captive audience
questions there» it would use up the billing space even more
so

would detract from the possibility of the utility

providing messages to the utility customers on matters such
as what are your new rates going to be» what are your rights
as a consumer in case there: is a cutoff of service.

We require

the utilities at least once a year to tell the customers
about their rights as consumers and that is supposed to be
don-. in the billing inserto
The legislature has indicated that we should require
them to tell customers about new rate proposals.
We signed a State law the utilities have an
obligation to tell the consumers about: the possibility of
conserving energy in the process of using utility service»

24

both gas and electricity.
Thera is a need for safety information as to how to
not use your equipment to prevent gas explosions and the
like.
This is a kind of Information that the Commission
believes the bill inserts should ba restricted for, should be
~~ or should fee used for.

Perhaps it is not even restricted

but that is what we believe is the proper use for this.

They

ce:.-. of course include general informational information
relevant to utility service.
QUESTION:

And that kind of information that you just

described, your Commission has power to compel the petitioner
to send in its billing envelopes, does it?
MR. SCHIPF:

Yes, Your Honor? it does so, and has

done so.
QUESTIONs

Does your Commission have power generally

to limit the advertising expenditures of the petitioner?
MR. SCHIFF:

Well, the Commission certainly classifies

advertising expanses as those which can be collected from rate­
payers

so-called above-the-line expenses and those which may

not foe collected.
QUESTION:

Is there a dollar figure m that above-the-

line or foe lew-the line, or does.; it depend upon the content of
■the advertising or the nature of 'the advertising?
MR. SCHIFF:

Well, in the 0rder reviewed upon here

25

the Commission adopted is 1977 'it established a policy that
it would allow utili.ties a certain percentage of their
revenues as what they could include — what they would be
allowed in advertising for — we want td get out of the business
of frying to determine, looking backwards when we are setting
i

rat s for the future»
Now,

But we include ah allowance»

the Commission has never

MR. SCIIIFFs
QUESTIONS

percentage of their receipts —

Right»
— they can spend on advertising to your

client, at the cost of the rate-payers?
MR. SCHSFFs
QUESTIONS

That is correct, Your Honor»
And if it exceeds that percentage, then

it is a cost to the stockholders.
MR. SCHIEFi

That is right.

QUESTIONS

Regardless of the nature or the content of

the advertising

MR. S CMIFF;
QUESTION:

A —
-- within —

! ,1. SCUIFFs'

Within limits» ' Well, the Commission

has divided, the advertising into several different categories,
as the order 'shows.

The percentage applies to institutional

and informational advertising»

There Is a 'category which

doesn't apply right now to the electric utilities that would
be- -promotion and we might allow something separate if it appears

that promotion is desirable from a rate-payer*s point of view*
The political advertising has never been allowed to be
collected from the rate-payers*

And that division has been

made in the uniform system ©£ accounts bath of our Commission
and those of the Federal Commissions and most of the State;
Commissions and drawing the distinction between political and
non-politi cal.

.And political has included the matters of

— controversial matters of public policy*

Obviously it is

not entirely easy to always separate them but —
QUESTIONs
MR* SCHIFF:
QUESTION:
MR* SCHIFF:

The political —
— it is a classification —
— is broader 'than partisan political*
Yes, yea, is broader than that*

Ona

of the mt':*m :fiat it is plainly relati to, for example,

\

%

is the question of whether there should b^ public take­
overs or public power should be established*

And, indeed,

Consolidated* Edison last fall .spent something in the nature of
t

.

i

a million doliare, in opposing the referendum 'in Westchester
County that might have led to public power in Westchester
County*

QUESTION t
HR* SCHIFF:

Righto
I mentis» those because it does

demonstrate that the ban which we have made on bill inserts
is a fairly limited ban*

It does not attempt to prevent

utilities- from expressing their views *

This is not the

Bellotfci case*
QUESTION;
MR* SCHIFF:
• QUESTION *

It is kind of broad, isn’t it?
Yes —
For example t you would normally say that

to urge .people to have 65 degrees in the winter and 78 in the
summer was within any Consolidated Edison business; is that
right?

But you wouldn't say it was controversial, would

you?
RE. SCHIFF*
QUESTION *

Well, I think that may —
Or if you can't get a batter word than

15controversial,13 what is it?
.

BCiUFFa

Well, it is difficult to get a better

word but if it is a matter of law that these are the
limitations on what people should be limiting their thermostats
to it may not be controversial once Congress has adopted but
I wouldn't want to go that far*
I don’t think.as a matter of fact that is what »in term? of urging them to encourage conservation, 1 think
we would tell them that —• should tell the consumers the benefit!:

28
or how you can. conserve and not be basically that much less
uncomfortable,

There are lots of ways.

You can install

installation and in Hew York as well under -the Federal law
the utilities are providing lending money so -that their
customers can conserve through installation of insulation,
through fumaca improvements, storm windows arid the like.
That is the kind, of conservation of ~~

We do think r— the Commission said that we had
considered this and some of the Commissioners had thought

Well, what is your answer to my question?

Do we judge this case on the basis that the order does not
ban the public forum mailing or not?
MR, SCHIEF:

I think that you probably have to view

it that the order par ts does not but that the public forum
issue is one of the reasons that the Commission reached that
conclusion, because the Commission expressly concluded -«

It is here in the sense

that one of the reasons «— one of the important reasons that

QUESTION:

That is right, Your Honor,
Then what if the companies put a little

card in with return postage and say, “If you do not want
inserts with your bill all you have to do is return this card
and we won*t put any inserts in your bill"?
MR, SCHIPFs

Well, the problem with that suggestion,

which has been, made by Lring island Lighting Company, is that
there are matters that should bo in these bill inserts that,
the customers —» the State has concluded they should he

if you have the complaint about utility service.

I don't think that over-breadth strictly should apply here.

• QUESTION:

Neil but suppose to just change the

example they said energy- will be saved by turning off your
lights at night but don * t forget there is a lot of risk of
burglarly and so forth and balancing between one or the other
it is the utility’s position that we favor leaving the lights

That would be controversial I suppose.
HR. SCHIFF:

probably is not.

Xt may be informational.

I really don’t

And I would not regard it

as controversial as such.
QUESTION:

Some of your responses would indicate

that the Commission nay have not thought this problem through
entirely.
MR. SCHIFFs

Well, I think it did in -the context I

do believe that it is not possible to set down & standard that
will deal with each and every topic.

The Commission*s order

does talk about the informational matters that can be
discussae, and I can think,

like you can, of matters in the

gray are®, dealing with the utility.

And I recognise that

45

whan in First Amendment terras this poses a problem X do think
that it poses much less of a problem when dealing with the
monopoly — wanting to perhaps put things in bill inserts
where there is a lot of thought given to it before you put
something in there,

I don't think this really goes t© the

core of the speech restriction and that there is -» there are
important problems in how we can deal.with regulated monopolies,
