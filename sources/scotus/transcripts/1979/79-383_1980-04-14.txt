MRo CHIEF JUSTICE BURGES:

We will hear arguments

Mr. Gondelman, you may proceed whenever you are
ready.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HAROLD GONDELMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MRo GONDELMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The opinion in U.S. v. Standefer appealed from is
now reported at 610 F.2d 1076'

II

It had not been when we prepared
fj

our briefs.

!

1*

S3

QUESTION:

What was the page, 76?

U

MR o GONDELMAN:

10 76.

610 F.2d 10 76 .

In this case Mr. Standefer was indicted on a 9-count

3»

indictment, the odd counts of which charged him with violation
of 26 UoSoCo 7214(a)(2), the event counts of which charged
18 UoSoCo 201(f).
Having read the 72 -page opinion, majority and minority
opinions of the court en banc and the three-judge panel, the

2©
El

|

Circuit Court withdrew? their original opinion when they did
order a hearing before the court en banc.

But in reviewing

that and in reviewing the briefs in this case, it sort of
reminds me a little bit of the Alice-in-Wonderland story when
Alice says to the big rabbit, "Where do I start?"

And the

4

1 ! rabbit said,
2

" You start at the beginning, you proceed to the

end and then stop."
Now, in this case as a defense lavzyer and trial
counsel in the court below, when I received the indictment and
the privilege of representing Mr. Standefer I didn't start with

5

the legislative history in 1908,which was five years before the
16th Amendment, which allowed income tax laws to be passed to

7
|

8

i

create a bureaucracy that they now want to apply the
legislative history of 1903 to.

9

QUESTION:

10
52

Well, Mr. Gondelman, after having read

your xl3-page brief on petition for writ of certiorari, T
S-

*V

12

I notice that nowhere do you cite Dunn v. The United States,

13

jwhich is Justice Holmes' old opinion saying that inconsistent

M

I verdicts in juries are perfectly permissible under the
I

IS

Constitution and the Federal law.
Do you think you can win this case without overruling

!s
17

the Dunn case?
MR, GONDELMAN:
r.

w

I think so, Your Honor, and I will

...

address myself directly co that, because in order to start in
■

.20

21
22

23
£4

] this case you must start by leading the indictment against
| Mr. Standefer and, unfortunately, no court has yet got to the
’I indictment that I thought I was trying.
1
Let me show Your Honor why I think and did not
discuss Justice Holmes' : case’, ,because it has nothing to do with
this case, if I may say so.

<

5 i

|

I

The indictment in this case says that Mr. Standefer

z

did on or about — and I won't go through all the odd counts,

2!

but each start with a date

4

Niederbergsr, an officer and employee of the United States,

§

acting in connection with Revenue laws of the United States,

■I

did aid and abet Cyril J.

6

namely a supervisory Internal Revenue agent -- skipping dates

1

in unlawfully and knowingly receiving a fee, compensation and

©

reward as set forth below which was not prescribed by law for

9

the performance of his duties as an Internal Revenue Service

10

IS
12

agent.
Now, when I read that indictment I then to make
certain that all courts would be able to correlate very clearly

S3

what 7. am talking about, in my motion to dismiss I attached

24

the Count 1 indictment against Standefer with the Count 2

S5

indictment against Niederberger so that we could see exactly

IS

what the same party -- that is the United States of America -~

!?

under its grand jury charged Mr. Niederberger with as well, as

18
SS

2d
21

22

Mr. Standefer with.
And at pages 2S-A on, you will see that the grand
jury indictment against Mr. Niederberger says that from on
or about the same dates that Standefer is charged with havinggiven the fee, compensation and reward to an officer employee
Niederberger -- and no one else, Niederberger -- that Mr.

24
2®

Niederberger did receive the golf trip in the exact amount on
the exact cate to the same place at the same time.

6

QUESTION:

Well, what if Mr. Niederberger had

dropped dead even before he was indicted; do you. think that
would preclude indictment and conviction of Standefer?
MRc GONDELMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, we are long past

the need to try the principal or convict the principal.

But

when the Government of the United States chooses to indict the
principal, and they are supposed to know the law, and in order
to have some kind of semblance of uniformity across this
country of ours, because each U.S. Attorney may act differently
and does, if Niederberger was not tried there v7ould not be
a mutual collateral estoppel, there would not be a finding by
a jury that he did not in fact commit the crime, and that is
what happened here.
QUESTION:

They indicted the principal and tried

him and he was innocent.
MRo GONDELMAN:

And he was found not guilty on three

counts.
QUESTION:

Dunn says he can be found not guilty and

your client can be found guilty.
MR. GONDELMAN:

But, Justice Rehnquist, in every

case that is decided and every circuit that is reported,
and interestingly enough you ask why I didn't comment on U.S.
v. Dunn, why didn't the Government talk about one case cited
on page 9 of my brief where if you try the principal and the
aider and abettor

7

2

QUESTION:

MRo GONDEL.MA.N:

I understand that.

In this case,

Your Honor, in every case that has been passed upon -QUESTION:

5

€S

this is

the Supreme Court of the United States.

8

4

This isn't the Court of Appeals,

Are these United States Supreme Court

cases you are referring to?
MR» GONDELMAN:

1

There are cases in the Supreme Court

8

of the United States where if you try two conspirators and

fa
ft»?

only two conspirators and one is found not guilty,

10
11

n

18
U

be no conspiracy.

17
2©

So you really have to get to the nub of

whether or not I can also win this case because I think the
charge is incorrect, and1 that is r a 3. s e d on this appeal,

and

that the judge below in his charge said you don ‘t have to find
an agreement.
Now,

IS
IS

there can

that is why I would like to get back to the

indictment.

What does the indictment say?

Standifer cannot

be indicted,

as we all know, under 72.14(a) (2)'.

It only applies

to an employee of the Government of the United States.
can only be indicted ‘as an aider and abettor.

He

Mow, if we want

19
t§

to look at definitions we have to look at Black’s law dictionary
which says that aiding and abetting, as cited on page 15 of

SI

25

implies knowledge.

It comprehends all assistance

rendered by words, acts and so forth.

It is not sufficient

that there is a mere negative acquiescence not in any way
made known to the principal malefactor.

MR. GONDELMAN:

MR 0 GONDELMAN:

And it did.

MR» GONDELMAN:
QUESTION:

11

It found as to all counts, yes.

It found that he committed an illegal act

and that in certain respects your client aided and abetted.
And it is true that in another case the principal was found
innocent but in this case the principal was found guilty.
MR» GONDELMAN:

The principal was found guilty at a

retrial by the same Government.
QUESTION:

That is correct.

17
MRo GONDELMAN:

3uc then I get to the next point, Mr .

IB
Justice White, and that is that under the instructions this
<>

u3

jury was a very intelligent jury.

After three hours of

2®
deliberation they sent a note to the Court saying is intent
2S

important in any of the nine counts of this indictment.

I

22
suggested to the Court that the answer to that was a very
23

simple "yes."

The Court then called the jury back and not

24

only said "yes ts but then proceeded to tell the jury that they
23

10

1

did not have to find an agreement between the principal and

2

the aider and abettor and in fact all they had to do was find

3

that a gratuity was paid for a speedy audit of which there was

4

everything but evidence of that.

I

IRS was auditing 1960 cases in 1971.

&

that it was by reason of a speedy audit or a favorable result,

1

which brings me co the third point of my argument.

1
II
32

IS

cited Bollenbach to show that the last ditch instructions of
a judge to a jury is the one that carries out a dictum back
in about an hour after those instructions, which left them
nothing to decide, took complete defense away from the jury,
they came back within an hour of a verdict of guilty.
Because I wanted to show and in fact did show that

If you find chat it is a favorable result, and I

8

These cases show that the

Gulf Oil over the period of these audits have paid $150 million
in additional taxes.

I showed and could show that in each

case what the IRS did here and the Government did here, they
did not find a specific act for which these golf trips were
taken.

They found that £n audit had been turned in by the

audit te-am of which Niederberger was a part, then they went
back from there to see if they could relate a golf trip to
the audit.

7nd if they took place 2 or 3 months after the

22

audit had been filed, the judge then told the jury that this
28
£4
23

could be fee compensation or reward.
QUESTION:

This obviously is a different argument

11

than whether or not you can convict one as an aider and abettor
if the principal has been acquitted.
MR» GONDELMAN:
QUESTION:

That is right, sir.

How about the --- are you through arguing

that?
HR. GONDELMAN:

No.

I think the fact that a jury

has passed upon the innocence of Niederberger precludes when
a. judge should be able to take judicial knowledge of that into
the rules of evidence.
QUESTION:

The Government should not have more than

one chance to prove the principal guilty if he has been found
innocent, that is the end of it?
MR, GONDELMAN:
QUESTION:

I v/ould hope

Aider and abettor too?

MRo GONDELMAN:

Yes.

I am urging this Court to say

to the United States of America, and its U.S. Attorneys you are
no different than any other litigant.
QUESTION:

But you don't cite Dunn, which is to the

contrary and you don't urge that in your brief?
MR,, GONDELMAN:

I urge in my brief, Your:-Honor, that

non-mutual collateral estoppel, Ashe v. Swenson, should be
applied 'to this situation where the Government -- and this is
where I suggest respectfully to this Court you can say it to
the U.S. Attorneys across the land, do not indict a principal
and then if he is acquitted come back and unfairly then try on

12

the same facts.

It is a narrow issue in this case.

It is

not —

2

QUESTION:

9

Your argument of course would be far

broader than aiders and abettors.

Suppose the statute said

it shall be illegal to give or receive a gratuity for perform­
ing a governmental act.

And so you indict under that statute

a Government servant and he is acquitted.

And then you indict

the person that was accused of giving him a gratuity and not
as an aider and abettor but as a principal.

And then you

would say that is barred.

to

MRo GONDELMAN:

I would say, sir, that if the

11

identical facts were presented to a jury in this country and
a jury has found against the Government of the United States,

is

the Government of the United States is barred just like any
other litigant.
QUESTION!

Your argument is even weaker than Dunn,

16

it seems to me, because Dunn was the same trial.

Here you are

talking about two separate trials.

MR0 GONDELMAN:

There can only be one recipient and

And it is not a case where you have a suppression of evidence,

Congress has not yet passed what it

But. the fact that you now have legislation pending
before Congress indicating that they want to pass a law saying
that the acquittal of the principal will not bar the trial of
the aider and abettor, in my understanding of statutory
construction, would indicate that when Mr. Standefer went to
trial and until today the acquittal of the principal is in
fact a bar because they are changing the law.

QUESTION:

Isn't that what Justice Holmes had in

mind when he wrote in Dunn?
MR* GONDELMAN:

In Dunn he said that.

But I might

17

also cite Benton v. Maryland to Your Honors in answer to that
18

question, because Your Honor said and Justice Harlan stated
If

the State has no more interest in compelling petitioner to
20

stand trial again, recognizing that is double jeopardy, for
2!
larceny of which he had been acquitted than in retrying any
22

other person declared innocent after an error free trial.
23

Now, I don't know why the ALI and the majority of
24
*

the Court of Appeals keep saying that because a. man is
2.3

II

17

found not guilty in the American system of justice chat it is
somehow a miscarriage of justice.

The fact is Niederberger had

a trial, the conviction was affirmed by the Court of Appeals,
he »7as presumed innocent, he was acquitted of three charges.
I thought in America that meant that he is innocent.
QUESTION;

He was found guilty of the other charges

in the only trial to which he was subjected.
MR» GONDELMAN:

That is correct.

And on those other

trials I then, get to the argument when Justice White
back to the question of the Constitution.

toolc me

And it is a stronger

argument, if you will, and that is that if a principal must
receive a fee, compensation or reward, there must necessarily
be an agreement between the principal and the aider and
abettor who is charged as an aider and abettor in giving him
a fee, compensation or reward, because if he doesn't give it
as a fee, compensation or reward and if it isn't received as
fee, compensation or reward, there is no substantive offense

committed.

Is it possible that he did receive it?

MRo

No, sir.

It wasn't presented in this case?

GONDELMAN:

In this case, absolutely not, because

QUESTION:

It was not?

MR, GONDELMAN:

No.

The judge specifically said to

this jury, sir, that you do not have to find an agreement
between Mr. Standefer -- and I have that covered in my brief,
I can point it out.

But the fact is that at page 87~A of the

appendix Judge Knox charged the jury specifically that it is
not necessary to find intent.

The question of whether or not

the tax returns were correct is irrelevant to their consider­
ation .
QUESTION:

3ut your client was charged as a principal

was he not?

He is charged as a principal but you

still have to have a substantive offense.

That is the difference between Dunn and Bryan and_

the cases which say if you have an innocent dupe, Standefer
could not be convicted of aiding and abetting an innocent
dupe.

And that is che difference between U.S. v. Dunn and

any other case that is recorded.
QUESTION:

him.
MR o GONDELMAN:

But i respectfully suggest to Your

19

1

Honor that what I am saying to you is that the jury could only

2

pass upon what a judge charged that they could pass upon.

S

in this case the judge took away from them two ingredients

4

that are crucial to the defense.
One, there must be an agreement between the principal

And

in this kind of a case who has to receive a fee compensation

reward.

If Niederberger had received it differently or if

Standefer took him on golf trips for different reasons even
,

1©

though he received it as a fee compensation reward, the intent
after the jury came back and asked about intent the judge

§1

said intent is unimportant.

If he did it for any one of a

22

number of reasons without specifying any particular act.

So I am challenging and I took exception and you will

mean the man isn’t guilty."

The fact is in this case the

jury could consider since the golf trips took place after the
report was filed, months after, would an intelligent person
offer a fee compensation or reward when his company is getting

Service official in charge of the ongoing audits of Gulf's

Although petitioner claimed at trial

that these gifts were made out of friendwhip and for social
reasons, the jury found to the contrary, that they had been
made and received as fees, compensations and rewards for the
performance of the IRS official’s duty and that, accordingly,
the official violated 26 U„SoC0

verdicts in such a trial.

And that is even true in the case where there are only two
named conspirators.
QUESTION:

The cases that your colleague relies on,

Morrison v„ California, you don’t put much into that?
MR. GONDELMAN:

Well, we distinguish all those in our

brief but let me take -- I can give you one example.

Morrison

is perhaps a good example of the infirmity in that reasoning
with respect to each of those cases.

In the Morrison case there

were two people who allegedly conspired and the Court held
18
that evidence with respect to one of them was based upon an
1*3

unconstitutional presumption.

And then the Court looked at

20
II

the rest of the evidence and said,

'but there is absolutely

nothing else in this record that would support a finding that
23

m
23

Conspirator No. 1 had entered into any agreement.

Therefore,

because there was an absolute failure of any proof with respect
to the agreement element, the conviction was invalid with respec

34

to both.

That case does not hold that where there is

sufficient evidence with respect to each element of the
conspiracy that the jury couldn’t return inconsistent verdicts
And I think you could go down each of those cases
that the petitioner has cited on that point and everyone of
them can be reconciled with our point of view.
Turning back to the questjion of statutory intent
with respect to 18 OoS.C,

2, perhaps I should briefly say that

the reason that-this statute was enacted in the first place
involves a perverse rule under the common law that originally
came into the common law at a time that the death penalty was
a common penalty for felonies and it was felt there was some
procedural protection that was needed to protect against the
imposition of the death penalty.

The rule worked only with

respect to a term known only to the common law and that was
accessories before the fact.
Just to contrast it, the rule even at common law
with respect to misdemeanors was that everyone who was in any
way directly or indirectly responsible for a crime was a
principal.

There was no such thing as an accessory before the

fact for misdemeanors.

Moreover, a person who aided and

abetted and was1present at a crime, that is a felony at common
law, also could be charged and

convicted irrespective of

whether or not any other person was convicted of a crime and
that person was regarded as a principal.

35

Now, the special rule that applies with respect to

1

accessories before fact was this.

I

An accessory before the

fact was someone who was not present at the scene of a crime

3

but who aided or somehow counseled and assisted in the

$

commission of the offense.

S

That person could not be even

prosecuted until the principal was convicted or unless they

«

were charged in the same joint trial.

7

And that was part of

this procedural safeguard against the imposition of the death

8

penalty.

9

This had some unfortunate results.

For example, if

a principal just couldn't be found, then the accessory before
1?
the fact even if they were in custody could not be brought to
IS
justice.

Similarly, if the principal were to die, then the

19

principal could never be convicted and therefore they couldn't
14

be accessory before the fact, could not be brought to justice.
18

.

And, more to the point of this case, if the principal were
1G
tried and acquitted, that acquittal would forever thereafter
17
bar the conviction of the principal.

And therefore the

13

procedural bar rule couldn’t be satisfied and the accessory
19

before the fact thereafter could not be tried.S3
Now, with the waning of the death penalty, most of
13

the States eventually abolished that distinction altogether.
22

And Congress in 1909 did exactly that in 18 U»S„C 3 2 which
23
provided that anyone who aided, abetted, counseled, commanded,
24
induced or procured an offense against the United States is a
25

36

principal.
Now, by defining principal to include all aiders
and abetters, etc,, the statute just simply abolished the
category of accessories before the fact.

And since this

category is the very predicate of the petitioner's argument,
the 1909 Act also abolished the predicate for the petitioner's
argument.

Under the Act petitioner is not an accessory before

the fact and is not entitled to any special pleading rules
but is punishable to the same extent as the principal.
Turning to the second of the petitioner's arguments,
this is an independent argument and as Justice White has
pointed out, it is much broader then the statutory argument
based on 18 U„S0C, 2.

Petitioner as did Judge Gibbons below,

argues that the conviction of petitioner with respect to the
aiding and abetting counts, as to those three counts, is
barred by the doctrine of nonmutual collateral estoppel.
QUESTION:

Mr. Alsup, before you get into this

argument, I just want to raise on question.
In our earlier argument we talked about this is a
brand now concept 'with Elonder-Tongue and the like.

Isn't

it correct that the concept of offensive nonmutual collateral
estoppel is rather new, as chose cases.

But the concept of

defensive nonmutual collateral estoppel is something that has
been around quite a while?
MR. ALSUP:

Well, since 1948, I believe it was the

37

Bernhard v. Bank of America case in the California Supreme
Court, not a Federal case at all, was the first time that a
major court in this country adopted it.

I would say 1948

still qualifies as -—
QUESTION:

As defensive collateral estoppel?

MRo ALSUP:

I believe chat was defensive in that

case .
QUESTION:

And that is the first case it applied that

to?
MR, ALSUP:
the leading case.

II

Well, it was the first major case, it is

There may have been lower court cases before

that, I am not aware of them.
QUESTION:

!S

That was what, 1948?

MR» ALSUP:

1948.

Now, we contend that nonmutual collateral estoppel
is unavailable in the circumstances of this case.

Traditionally

collateral estoppel is available only if there is mutuality
18

f

in the application of the doctrine.

That occurs where both

■ parties in the present case were parties to the prior case,
or at least weren't privity with someone who was a party to
l|
■] the prior case.

In the present case the petitioner was not a

to invoke the benefit.
QUESTION:

Was the same evidence used in both?

33

MR„ ALSUP:

Actually there was overlapping evidence.

Actually there was new evidence.
is identical evidence.

This is not a case where it

Now, there was quite a number of

different battle lines formed in the second case because new
evidence came to light in the interval.

So it cannot be said

that this was a case which the jury in Niederberger's case and
in Standefer’s case had identical evidence before them.
QUESTION:

Was there anything show in the way of a

pattern of conduct in terms of Standafer's case?

Mr.

34

I am not here to answer your questions.
Our point is that we don't feel that

way when there is overwhelming proof of guilt.

To us the

logical inference, as this Court has .recognized from time to

time,

f;
i;

is chat juries do exercise compassion.

33
Now, you are right, in the Ashe case the Court said

i

IS
we are not going to concern ourselves with the fact that there
20
might be compassion, in that passage where the Court talks
£1
about we will assume the rational verdict.

23

24

i

But that is because

the Court was dealing with double jeopardy and in order to
safeguard the constitutional right against excessive prosecutions
the Court rightly decided we will not indulge or recognize the

fact that juries indulge in compassion.

of prudential considerations as to whether or not nonmutual

js
This is solely a judge-made rule

And just as the judge made rule concerning inconsistent

so it should be taken into account here.
Another reason why civil cases are different is

ft

We are not dealing

because in criminal cases the United States does not have the

are available in civil cases. The rule of this problem is the

There are privileges that prohibit the Government from

37

There is no directed verdict

that the Government can ask for when the weight of the
18

evidence is overwhelming.

There is no summary judgment motion.

IS

And when the jury does exercise compassion, we can't go and

ask for a judgment NOV and say set aside chat jury verdit or
21

case and the civil case-

5

QUESTION:

And in the criminal case the Govern­

I don't think you argue -- maybe I missed it

in your brief -- that there might well be situations in which

8

there would be evidence seized in violation of the Fourth

8

Amendment rights or the first defendant,would not be admissible

10

against him. But ic could nevertheless prove guilt of the second

81

defendant, which makes the two cases quite different in a

n
13
14

IS
18

17

<l
1

criminal count.
Do you argue that?
M.Ro ALSUP:

Well, We did.

We intended to argue it and

E think we had a long footnote in which we refer to Fourth
Amendment problem that you just mentioned.

And that would mean

that, for example, in case No. 1 certain evidence that is
crucial might be excluded but it would be available to be used

IS
in case No. 2.

And that once again is part of the problem that

19
the Government faces in having the same full and fair opportunity
tc litigate an issue: that is available in civil cases, because
in civil cases these exclusionary rules just aren't problems.
22

But they are big problems in criminal trials.
23

Now, it is Footnote 29, Mr. Justice Stevens, in our
24

m

brief is where we refer to that problem.

46

I see ray time is running out.

I would just say

briefly that there are other reasons why nonmutual collateral
estoppel ought not to be applied in criminal cases.
Briefly, one is that the inquiry into determining
whether or not the Government had had a full and fair
opportunity and exactly what issue was previously decided
might be an exhaustive inquiry in-cases and given the. fact
that it is the United States — this is really the only one
who has an interest here — the United States often takes into
account the outcomes of prior trials and is not like an ordinary
civil litigant and may not repeat litigation except where in
the interest of justice we think it is necessary.
QUESTION:

Going back to the example -- the type of

examples' in your Footnote 2S, why isn't that problem adequately
handled by in the second trial the Government simply advising
the trial court that there were these valid objections to its
case and therefore the rule shouldn’t apply in this particular
case.

Why is that a reason for not applying the rule?
MRo ALSUP:

Well,

theoretically you could make an

inquiry into exactly what evidence was excluded at the first
trial, what evidence wasn't even offered because they knew it
would be subject to constitutional problems.

For example, in

this case, in the Niederberger case we couldn't even call
Standefer as a witness in the first case and we didn't even
try because we knew he would invoke his — so there wasn't

47

f
any exclusion per se but it was just not done because of
But you are right.

Those factors could all be

t

listed, the judge at the second trial could try to take all
those into account and then the judge could turn to the issue

4

of what v/as actually decided by the first jury.
Our point is that that would be a very exhausive
inquiry in each case and most of the time the judge is going
to find there wasn't a full and fair opportunity and it is just
not worth the candle to make that inquiry in so many cases
where it would undoubtedly be raised repeatedly, simply in

10

the very small number of cases to be able to invoke the
II

doctrine of nonmutual collateral estoppel.
If the whole point, or if one of the major points
is to save time of the courts, we think this would waste time

M

of the courts , not actually save it.
QUESTION:

If you rely on the inability to call

Standefer, that would be a circumstance always present, wouldn't;

He would assert
