PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 78-873, Board of Education of New York v, Harris3
the Secretary of HEW.
Mr. Bruno, I think you may proceed whenever you
are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH F. BRUNO, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. BRUNO:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and. may it please

My name is Joseph Bruno, and I am Assistant

Corporation Counsel of the City of New York.

I represent

the petitioner, the Board of Education of the City School
District of the City of New York.
This case presents this Court the issue of the
proper test of discrimination under a. fedei’al grant statute
known as the Emergency School Aid Act as well as the proper
test of discrimination under Title VI of the 1964 Civil
Rights Act, as well as interrelationship between ESAA and
Title VI.
It is the position of HEW and the» Second Circuit
Court of Appeals that the test of discrimination under
both ESAAand Title VI is a disparate impact test»

Tjhe

Board's position Is that under ESAAand Title VI, the test
of discrimination is a constitutional Intent test.
A bit about the facts:

The ESAAstatute sets up

a competition in this country among school districts who
seek to apply for a limited pool of ESAAfunds of approxi­
mately $1.5 billion.

Proposals are submitted to HEW for

grading on properammatic merits and a program would be
funded if it came within the range of programmatic merits
except if It was found to be ineligible under the provisions
of section 1605(d)(1) of the ESMstatute.
Suffice to say that the Board of Education sub»
mitted a proposals, was found to have sufficient program­
matic merit;, was denied funding under section 1605(d)(1)(B)
when HEW found that certain of th® Hew York City high
schools were racially identifiable based ucon staff assign­
ments .
QUESTION:

Counsel* is 1605(d)(1)(B), the statute

you question., does that Involve the proposal submitted for
funds or does it Involve the practice?, the existing prac­
tices of the school board submitting them?
MR. BRUNO:

It involves the existing practice.

It was a basis for finding ineligibility.

That is the

ineligibility section of the ESM statute.

It doe3 not re­

late to the Individual proposals.
from it.

The proposals are apart

This is a basis upon ineligibility.

It talks

about current practices or activities.
The finding of ineligibility was baaed essentially
on a statistical report done by HEW in relation to a. 1976

5
OCR non-compliance letter.

The validity of that determin­

ation of ineligibility was the subject of at least two re­
views at HEWs was conceded by the District Court for the
Eastern District of New York before Judge Jack B. Weinstein,
and appealed to the Second Circuit.
Nov/p the circuit held that ESAA itself requires
application of an Impact test in determining eligibility
for funding on the issue of staff assignments.

The Court

of Appeals also held that Title VI incorporates an impact
test and therefore that the staff assignment policy of the
Board also violated Title VI.

Let me deal first with the

ESAA statute.
The subdivision I have indicated is section
y..

1605(d)(1)(B).

It states:

'

"•

"No educational agency, shall

be eligible for assistance under this chapter If It has as
of June 23, 1972, It has had or maintained in effect any
'

•*

-

r

•

other practice, policy, or procedure which results in
...demotion or dismissal of instructional or other staff,
minority staff in conjunction with a desegregation plan" —
QUESTION:

How do you get away from the language

"which results"?
M*

MR. BRUNO:

2

'

1

We do not, and we concede with re­

spect to demotions and dismissal—the issue In this case
is assignment of staff — with respect to demotions and
dismissals, we concede that is a disparate impact test for

6
a very clear rationale, and Congress so stated.

I will

get to it very shortly.
With respect to the assignment of staff, however,
the language is "otherwise engage in discrimination."

HEW

contends that this language of the statute makes it obvious
that the test applicable, which we concede is the uii spar ate
impact to the motion to dismissal, is the same test that
should be applicable to the assignment of staff.

I would

submit that the Congress used very different terms when it
dealt with demotions and dismissals as opposed to assign­
ment of staff.
I would also note that In this section 1605(d)(1)
which is the entire ineligibility section here, five
activities that render a board ineligible, within this
section it uses discrimination twice.

It uses it in sub­

division (d) which deals with avoidance of minority group
participation in curricular or extracurricular activities
so as to discriminate against them — that is the other
place that it is used.
an intent test.

HEW concedes that there that is

We say that if Congress knew what it

was talking about with subdivision (d) it certainly knew
what it was talking about with respect to subdivision (b)
dealing with staff assignments.

HEW could do nothing with

that.
I would note that the real issue in this case is

7
v/hat did Congress intend when it used the word "discrimin­
ation."

HEW contends that the legislative history is ex-»

tremely relevant, yet they totally ignore perhaps the most
relevant legislative history in dealing with the meaning of
the word "discrimination."

They say not one word in their

brief about Senate Committee Report 92-61 which states in
essence that one and only one practice in subdivision 6105
(d)(1)(B) i3 presumed to be discriminatory if disparate
impact exists.
That speaks directly to subdivision (B).

Sub­

division (B) has two types of activities, demotions and
dismissals and for the sake of this argument assignment of
staff.

They are two very distinct clauses in it.

That

committee report makes it clear that one and. only one is
presumed to be discriminatory.
HEW ignores the language later on in that same
Senate committee report where it states, "The phrase
disproportionate to demotions or dismissals is not modi­
fied nor in any way diminished by the substantive phrase
or otherwise engaged in discrimination in ;he assignment
of staff." These are two separate and distinct clauses.
QUESTION:

Well, you wouldn't contend, would

you, that the rulemaking authority of the agency charged
with carrying out the act is necessarily bound to follow
the committee reports of one of the Houses of Congress.

8
MR. BRUNO:

Oh, no, they are bound to follow the

intent of the legislature in enacting the statute.

We say

the clear intent of the legislature in enacting this is to
require an intentional discrimination test for assignment
of staff.

Let me tell you why.
QUESTION:

But the reasoning of your last argu­

ment, as I understood It, was your reliance on the Senate
committee report.
MR. BRUNO:

My last argument was the reliance

on the Senate committee report indicating what the intent
of the legislature was in passing this particular statute
and this particular section.
Let me say further, be3/ond that, there is other
ample proof of what the Congress was talking about when it
used the word "discimination.53
QUESTION:

I don’t doubt that it is a factor,

but I got the impression that you were saying that the
agency charged with making the rule can never go against
the language In a committee report.
MR. BRUNO:

Absolutely not, I am not saying

that, but I am saying that that language in that committee
report, taken with the legislative history, indicates the
intent of the discrimination test for this section of the
statute which is the eligibility section which is at issue
in this case.

9
In 1972, the language of the section was enacteds
the meaning of the word "discrimination” as discussed by
Congress, it was very clear what they were talking about.
They were talking about Swann, they were talking about
Brown, they were talking about intentional segregation,
de jure segregation, and they were enacting this section.
In fact, Rep. Dellenback said ESAA does not alter in any
way the legal aspects of desegregation, its purpose is to
help school districts see that existing law is enforced.
Senator Mondale, in discussing this, talked
about Swann and said the only actual discrimination we
have is de jure intentional segregation.

'IEW argues that

it is equally plausible that discrimination can mean
disparate impact and they allude to Title 711.

They

ignore, for one, the discussion of desegregation and the
cases that we were talking about, of Swann and Brawn.
They ignore that Briggs had come down in March of 1971
and not one statement about Briggs in the Title VII case.
They ignore that in the third section, 1605(d)(1), dis­
crimination is mentioned twice.

They can see in sub­

division (d) that it is an intent test, and now they wish
to ignore that.
QUESTION:

Mr. Bruno, was there some — Title

VII was already on the books?
MR, BRUNO:

Oh, yes, 196ft.

10

QUESTION':

And was there some comparison with

Title VII as to what the standard was?
MR. BRUNO:
QUESTION:

Are you talking about HEW?
No, in the passage of this act.

This is —
MR. BRUNO:

Oh, yes, absolutely, and I will get

to that if you would like.
QUESTION:

Okay.

MR. BRUNO:

In your own time.

All right.

Let me Just go into the

rationale for the demotion and dismissals test.
QUESTION:

Before you go to that, Mr. Bruno,

you two or three times mentioned the language in sub­
division (d), but there they expressly use the intent
language in order to avoid, so that is not saying

it

is not fair to infer that whenever they use the word
"disciminate" thy had an intent test when they spelled it
out in the —
\

MR. BRUNO:

Your Honor, they use the word

"discimination" and we think that it is extremely important
that we use that.

Let me talk a bit about the language of

that subdivision (d) —
QUESTION:

Wouldn*fc you agree that in order to

avoid, it is pretty clearly intent language?
MR. BRUNO:
standard.

Yes, we agree that that is an Intent

We also feel that the (b) section is also.

They

11
rely essentially on the word "otherwise," if you look at
their brief.

They rely on the use of the word "otherwise"

to indicate that the test used for demotions and dismissals
should be the same test used for staff assignments and they
say "otherwise" denotes commonalitv or similarity-

They

say it is obvious from using the word.
Well, I just did very little rassarch on that
and looked inthe dictionary and the word "otherwise" does
not mean commonality or similarity, it means contrast.
Now, it could mean that and I would not sav that it could
not mean that in the context of this statute, but 1 think
if we look at how it was used here and if we consider —
if Congress wanted to say demotions and dismissals, the
same test applied to demotions and dismissals and used
the same test, all they would have to say is disproportion­
ate to demotions, dismissals, assignment of staff, hiring
and promotions.

They didn't do that.

They broke this up

in the legislative history.
To get back to Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that is
why I cite Senate committee Report 92-61, because I think
that points out that they were talking about two separate
clauses.
The rationale for the disparate impact test for
demotions and dismissals is very clear.
we say about this in their brief.

HEW ignores what

Senate committee Report

12
92-61 points out that Congress was concerned that the
districts at this time that had desegregation orders
against them were demoting and dismissing black principals
and staff in the South, and what Sanator Mondale said
during the debates was that there have been wholesale
firing of black teachers and principals in the South in
conjunction with desegregation orders.

So when they

passed this section dealing with demotions and dismissals,
a disproportionate demotions and dismissals in conjunction
with desegregation order, so the rationale is very clear.
QUESTION:

Mr. Bruno, is it your submission

that just standing alon© the phrase "practice discrimina­
tion" implies intent?
*

MR. BRUNO:

The word "discrimination" as it

was used there, which we indicato ■—
QUESTION:

If it is unlawful -to practice dis­

crimination —■
MR. BRUNO:
QUESTION:

Yes.
— do you say, without reference to

anything else in the statute, that that implies intentional?
MR. BRUNO:

In that statute we believe it does.

We believe it does.
QUESTION:

Well, it is just a matter of meaning

of words?
MR. BRUNO:

Y©s.

13

QUESTION:

The practice of discrimination

would imply intent.
MR. BRUNO:

And I would say not only the mean­

ing of the words but the juxtaposition in that statute,
the way they us® them.

When they want to talk about dis­

proportionate disparate impact test, they us© the terra
disproportionate.

They changed th© term and they could

very easily have kept that term to deal with th® remaining
elements.
HEW would have us believe that all they are
really doing there is saying disproportionate demotions or
dismissals and all the rest follow that test.

For on®, it

doesn't read that way and I say it is illogical.
not what they were doing.

HEW relies on arother section, and so does the
'■si*-

•

Court of Appeals in finding that a disparate impact that
applies to ESAA eligibility, they rely on section 1602(a)
of tha ESAA statute.

At the time that ESAA was introduced,

there was considerable discussion in Congress about doing
something about da facto

segregation.

They wanted to

do something but they realised that the decisions of this
Court and elsewhere were prohibiting then from doing some­
thing about de facto

segregation.

So what they did was they passed ESAA.

They

said if you want ESAA money, in order to ha eligible you

14
must establish that you are implementing a court ordered
desegregation order or you are going to do it voluntarily»
What were they trying to do?

They were trying to do away

with de facto segregation by offering a carrot to districts
they could not get after the courts, but saying do away
with de facto segregation and we will offer you this ESAA
funding»
Section 1602(a) states — and so much is placed
on this section, there is so much discussion in HEW's
brief and in the Court of Appeals —- it states essentially,
"that guidelines and criteria of ESAA be applied uniformally
without regards to the origin of cause of segregation.”

it was broadening

They would have us believe that 1602(a)

meant a disparate impact test for ESAA ®li.gihility»

Well,

if they had riiaant that, that at least on© element of
ineligibility in-subdivision (b) knocks that logic out
totally.

V]1
I would Ilk© now to get to th© Title VI discussion.

Perhaps th® most — we feel that perhaps the most important
and significant error in the opinion of the Court of Appeals
was its failure to assess the impact, of the Bakka decision
on the standards of discrimination applicable under Title VI»

15
The Court cited Bakk© in its Title VII language
but at least I think in our petition for cert inexplicably
they said nothing about the Bakke case with respect to
Title VI.

Instead, they cited Lau v. Nichols.

The

Court of Appeals relied on Title VI as an additional
basis for finding that the disparate impact test applies
to ESAA eligibility.
HEW has determined that Title VI is not an
issue.

I say it is a rather cavalier determination be­

cause in our petition for cert, perhaps fcha most important
and perhaps our strongest point was the Court of Appeals
failure to even not© the Eakk© decision in discussing
Title VI.
Title VI:i whether"~it is the standard for ESAA
or Title VI is the standard establishing what is discrim­
ination ws say in this context, but whether it provides
the actual standard for ESAA eligibility or not is cer­
tainly interrelated, and 1st m@ explain why.
The Court of Appeals said it was,.
says that it is.

Their language

Th© statistics upon which the Court of

Appeals and HEW resiled in finding th© Board ineligible
was in Title VI non-compliance letters.

Tit!© VI is a

major enforcement now for all federal funding.

ESAA is

incorporated through a series of amendments to the
Elementary and WSecondary Education Act of 1964.

Title VI

16

enforces that act and the procedural aspect of enforce­
ment is codified in Title VI.
Secretary Finch during the ESAA debates said,
when asked whether a district would be eligible for ESAA
funding and it was discriminating in the assignment of
teachers, h@ stated that such a district would not b©
eligible because\it would be violating Titi® VI„

\
The Second Circuit in a later decision cited
in our main brief, Parents Association of Andrew Jackson,
has now said — I will read it;

"We think that Title VI

does not authorise federal judges to iraposs a school
desegregation remedy where there is no constitutional
transgression — i.e., where a racial imbalance is meraly
da facto."
So even the Second Circuitin issuing this de­
cision was wondering if they did the right thing.

They

say -the continued viability of Lau is suspect and they are
waiting this Court's consideration perhaps in this case or
another case.
Th© Second Circuit in the Jackson decision went
into a bifurcated view of Title VI.

It is in our brief

and I really don't, think I should g© over it in any great
detail.

But what it did was it went through such a

tortured reasoning of Title VI to find that in this context,
in this very cas® that a disparat® impact test could apply

17
and likened it to Titi® VII which is not.

It did that

because it felt that Title VI was extremely relevant, the
test was extremely relevant to what th© test for ESAA
eligibility is.
This is a desegregation case.

Even under the

Jackson decision of the circuit, we would fall within the
intent test that they have indicated,
V.

Th® appropriate test we say for. finding discrim­
inatory intent was set out in the Arlington Heights case,
HEW relied on two. elements.

They used a foreseeability

test, citing to the Hart case in the Second Circuit, and
on Swann they relied, sora© language in Swann.
As this Court has recently held in th© Feeney
case and in Columbus Board of Education, forseeability is
on© element in establishing intent.

It is not in and of

itself sufficient to establish intent.
Secondly, I would like to hot© that ©van the
circuit, th© Second Circuit in. th® Jackson case has some
doubts about the viability of th© Hart case that it relied
on.
Lastly, I would lik© to not© that the Swann
pass relied on by HEW in its finding of ineligibility
for the Board of Education cites this languages

'’Disparate

racial composition of staff to establish a prima facie
©as© of ©qua1 protection ©f violation."

Wall, l would

18

say that is somewhat disingenuous to us that clause be­
cause in Swann you hav© a situation where you had de jur©
segregation and, yes, once you had a prior finding of de
jure segregation, than you could use such a test to perhaps
imply intent at a later time»
clear.

Keyes makes that eminently

In New York City w© had no finding of intentional

discrimination.
Your Honors, I would like to ask the Court to
have an understanding of the ESAA statute, that ESAA was
intended to make money available to districts that wore
experiencing da facto segregation.
for?

What ©Is© would it be

It was to assist in doing that, in eliminating da

facto segregation».

HEW argues in their brief that the

solution adopted in ESAA was to employ the carrot approach
to encourage the,.voluntary elimination, reduction or prevent ion of minority group isolation.,

They thsn continued'.

"It seems evident that with such a starting point, it

.

would mak© no sansa to grant funds to school districts
that, although hot violating the Constitution, were main­
taining a segregated system."

Tha logic is incredibl€s to

me.
That is what this is all .afcpufc.

E thought the

money was to be mad® available to districts that had de
facto segregation.

That is what thej intent is all about.

They would deny it to the very districts that have the

19
type of segregation that this money is intended to work on.
We have an extensive program in New York.
are ready to go ahead with that program.

We

HEW has taken a

course that w® ara not eligible here, we are not eligible
under the following year.

I say that what they are doing

is frustrating the legislative purpos®, tha clear intent
of the legislature.

Their brief doesn’t deal with this.

Their brief deals with virtually nothing with respect to
th® legislative history.

It talks a bit about 1602, it

cites no cases except for the Aspira case, and I think
they think that -- if in fact they think it is all right
and they want to interpret tha legislative intent their
way, that is- sufficiant.

I think they hava to look a

little more closely to what Congress intonied.

Then why would Senator Stennis foa

22
putting it in?
MR. BRUNOs
very clear.

Well, Senator Stennis’ remarks are

He was attempting to light one little candle.

H® wanted to go on record — to be honest, 1 think he
wanted to go on record in an enactment of Congress to say
something about doing something about de facto segregation.
QUESTION;

But you would think that a Senator

coming from a sfcat® where there had been a history of
segregation by law and cl@ar.ly d© jure segregation would
be urging that schools guilty of d© jura segregation be
eligible for this aid, not only schools just guilty of da
facto segregation.
MR. BRUNO;

You sea, when he initially submitted

the Stennis amendment, he included ESAA, Title VI and
section 182 together.

I think he was attempting to

sensitise the Congress and the nation and I would say this
Court to do something in the futura about 3© facto segrega~
tion.

I think he was clearly just attempting to make a

policy statement.

I do not know what eIs© h@ could have

baen attempting to do.

I think he say also have been

trying to frustrata — th© way h© presented it, I think he
was trying to frustrate th© us® of Titia VI because h©
realised what the law was and he was attempting to put
Title VI in th© same boss with ESAA.

ESAA could h® used

against d© facto and de jur© segregation, but th© way he

23

presented it, it included ESAA, Title VI and section 182
altogether.

They used th© same language.

Congress in the

conference committee broke that out -- I think they broke
it out because clearly ESAA could ba used against d© facto
and de jus®,, but Titi® VI could not.
Your Honors, I would like to reserve my remain­
ing time for rebuttal»

Thank you.

MR. McCREE:

Mr. Chiaf Justice,, and may it pleas®

the Court;
W© understand that petitioners do not contest
the substantial disproportions in the assignment of full­
time minority teachers? further, they do not deny that the
schools were statistically racially identifiable as a re­
sult of th® disparities in staff assignments.
They argue that th© statute and regulations must
be construed to require th© Department of Health, Education,
and Welfare to establish that th© disparities resulted
from purposeful or intentional discrimination in th® con­
stitutional sens©.»
Although on remand, th© Dspartsient of Health,
Education, and Welfare found th© petitioners0 teacher

24
assignment policies war© unconstitutional; and the District
Court affirmed; we do not have to decide we submit whether
th© a «Ministrat iv© record supports that finding because
the Court of Appeals expressly declined to address that
question.
Also we nead to decide whether the Court of
Appeals’ dictum about th© sufficiency of an objective test
for a violation of Titi® VI of th© Civil Rights Act ©£
1964 is present.

The regulation, 45 Code of Federal

Regulations 185.43 —
QUESTIOH?

Mr. Attorney General, what if w©

disagreed with you or agreed with the submission of your
friend here that this statute incorporates th® constitu­
tional test?
MR. McCREE:

Well, w© submit that it does not

incorporate, fch© —
QUESTION:
with him?

I knew you do, but what if wa agreed

What if wa agreed with him?
MR. McCREE:

I think if this Court agrees with

him, then its course would bo to remand this to allow th©
Court of Appeals for th© Second Circuit to address th©
question of whether there is a constitutional violation
shown on the administrative record.

And wa think it does

but w© don't propose to argue it.
QUESTIONS

W@ would than also -- well, I will

25
put it this ways

What if w® agreed with you, is there any

claim in this case that as construed to cover merely impact,
this particular statuta is unconstitutional because it is —
MR* McCREE:

w@ don't understand the petitioner

to make that contention.
QUESTXOHs

Doss this statute r®st cn the sponding

power or does it — is it coitanerce or Fourteenth Amendment
or does anybody know?
MR. McCREE:
the spending power.

Well, I think it rests certainly on
It might rest on the implementation

of the Fourteenth Amendment, but I don't think w© need to
decide that either *
QUESTION

%

Well, if it did it is cunning against

the state and then you may have a little problem on it.
MR. McCREE:

There might be a problem there.

I

would like to suggest that if Congress, for example,
thought that it would be good to promota foreign language
instruction in public schools, it could appropriate special
funds for the purpose ©f encouraging public schools to in­
augurate or strengthen existing foreign language programs
and it could provide for certain qualifications and for
certain disqualifying features.

For example, it might say

that a teacher to whom th© language to bs taught is not a
native tongue may not participate in this program, and I
suppose than w© would just look to s©© whether th® statute

26
was followed in th© particular case and whether th© regu­
lations promulgated to enforce it were authorized by the
statute.
I think that is exactly what we have her®.
QUESTION:

General McCree, your hypothesis that

Congress is not directing th® state or the school to have
foreign language instruction, it is pimply offering
financial aid if th© state chooses to hav© it.
MR. McCREE:

Well, as \m see this, Mr. Justice

Rehaquist, this Congress is not directing 'th© states to
participate in this program? as my brother, Mr. Bruno,

students of a particular race, color or national origin."
We do not understand th® petitiones to challenge at all
■; i ■
:
th© determination fetet these schools are sc identifiable,
so we ar@ right at th@ statute.
We submit that the Congress showed that it knew
how to require unconstitutional or purposeful discrimina­
tion when it wanted to, and w© refer to section 1605(d)

27
where in response to a question from the Court, my brother
sought to mak© feh© point that discrimination there was
purposeful and indeed it is because it says in order to
avoid th© participation of minority group children.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

W© will pick up there

at 10:00 o9clock in the morning.
(Whereupon, at 3:00 o’clock p.ra., the case was
recessed, to reconvene at 10:00 o'clock a.n., on Wednesday,
October 10, 1979.)
