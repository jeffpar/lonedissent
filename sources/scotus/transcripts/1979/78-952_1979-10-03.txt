PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF'JUSTICE BURGER:

We will heap argument

next in 78-952, Rush v. Savehuk.
Mr. Adamson, I think you may proceed whenever you
are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF OSCAR C. ADAMSON, II, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. ADAMSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case comes before this Court on appeal from a
Judgment of the Supreme Court of the State of Minnesota.

The

issue presented by this appeal succinctly stated is whether
or not the Minnesota courts may exercise constitutionally
permissible quasi in rem Jurisdiction over a non-resident
tortfeasor who has absolutely no minimum contacts whatsoever
with the State of Minnesota by permitting the plaintiff to
garnish the defendant’s liability insurance policy on the
basis that the defendant’s Insurer does business within the
Stats of Minnesota.

That is the issue presented by this

appeal.
The operative facts are very simple but they pro­
vide I think the necessary background.

Back in 1972, Mr.

Rush and Mr. Savehuk were involved in an automobile accident
in Indiana.

At that time, both Mr. Rush and Mr. Savehuk were

residents and citizens of the State of Indiana.

About a year

and a half later Mr. Savchuk decides to emigrate to Minnesota
and about a year after that he commenced this lawsuit against
Mr. Rush by serving a garnishment summons on State Farm, Mr.
Rush’s liability insurer in the State of Minnesota.

I might

say that Mr. Rush’s liability insurers. State Farm, is his
liability insurer by reason of a contract of insurance which
was written and issued in the State of Indiana.

There was no

point of contact with any of these activities at ail until
Mr. Savchuk’s going to Minnesota and then commencing this
action.
As soon as this was done. Rush and State Farm im­
mediately challenged the jurisdictional basis of the garnish­
ment quasi in rem jurisdiction by appropriate motion and the
Minnesota District Court and the Minnesota Supreme Court
found no due process problems whatsoever with the procedure.
We then appealed to this Court and this Court
vacated the judgment of the Minnesota Supreme Court and re­
manded it back to the Minnesota Supreme Court with directions
to reconsider their prior determination in light of Shaffer
v, Hrltner.

The Minnesota supreme Court duly reconsidered

the matter and found no problem whatsoever with the quasi in
rere jurisdiction in this case and felt that Shaffer v. Heitner
did not change a thing.

This second appeal followed and this

Court noted probable Jurisdiction.
Wow, before talking about Shaffer a little bit, I

5
would like to express tc the Court my understanding of the
reasoning followed by the Minnesota Supreme Court in ignoring
Shaffer.
QUESTIOH:

By What?

MR. ADAMSON:

By Ignoring, I say.

Maybe that is an

inappropriate word — distinguishing it.
QUESTION:

Misunderstanding.

MR. ADAMSON:

I would like to use that word, yes,

sir.
First of all — and I think this is rather interesting — the Minnesota Supreme Court, after talking about the
facts in Shaffer, said that it considered the decision unclear.
It also said that Minnesota's interest in facilitating recover­
ies for resident plaintiffs — notice that language, facili­
tating recoveries for resident plaintiffs — not only requires
a local forum in Minnesota but may override traditional
choice of law analysis,
Now, it may be there that the Minnesota Supreme
Court was mixing Jurisdiction and choice of law which we all
have so much trouble with, but at any rate that is what it
s aid.
The Minnesota Supreme Court went on to say that
Minnesota possesses sufficient contacts — without identifying
them -- and that due process is not violated in this quasi in
rem action because of three things, and here they are.

One,

6
notice was given to the defendant, it sure was.
doubt about that.

There is no

Two. the defendant cannot be held liable

for more than his policy limits in Minnesota pursuant to this
quasi in rem proceeding.

And

three, the procedure is avail­

able only to Minnesota residents and it is not available to
non-residents, it is available to only Minnesota residents.
Now, these are the three bases which the Minnesota
Supreme Court enunciated as providing the due process basis
for this quasi in rem proceeding that I have described.
QUESTION:

Your brief indicates that this plaintiff

has now moved out of the State of Minnesota.
MR. ADAMSON:

Yes, he has emigrated again to

Pennsylvania so that means I think he has lived In three
states in six years.

Probably that isn't material, but it

does illustrate how fluid our population is when we are trying
to arrive at a constitutional nexus based upon the transitory
residence of a plaintiff in a given state at a given time.
Now, that isn't all the Minnesota Supreme Court did.
I think it added the frosting on the cake really because
after having reasoned all of this and had come tc the con­
clusion that due process was satisifed, it really gave the

corn de grace to Mr. Rush.

It said that in this situation

where Minnesota requires jurisdiction of an out-of-state
accident o\7er a non-resident and so forth, it will apply
Minnesota substantive law.— "we are not a choice of law.”

?
They found that not only do we have jurisdiction but the choice
of law decision we are going to make; we are going to apply
Minnesota law to this accident because it is more favorable
to the plaintiff.
The consequences in this particular case is, Your
Honors, that by so doing the Minnesota Supreme Court would
strip from Mr. Rush what is basically an absolute defense,
the guest statute of Indiana which was certainly applicable
to him and Mr. Savchuk at the time of the accident, and also
would substitute a doctrine of comparative negligence for
contributory negligence and also would prevent this action
from being dismissed by reason of the running of the statute
of limitation.
All of these things Mr. Savchuk got by being able
to invoke the quasi in rem jurisdiction of the Minnesota
Supreme Court.

Now —

QUESTION:

You had a divided vote on the court.

MR. ADAMSON:
QUESTION:

I beg your pardon, sir?

You had a divided vote on the court.

MR. ADAMSON:

Yes, the vote was 6-3, Mr. Justice

Otis dissenting, and Madam Justice Wahl writing the majority
opinion.
QUESTION:

A hundred years ago, Minnesota didn’t

have a guest statute, and am I correct in assuming that it
still doesn’t have one?

8
MR, ADAMSON:
guest statute.

No, sir, Minnesota has never had a

Minnesota adhors guest statutes, the Judiciary

does.
QUESTION:

And you also do not have a direct action

statute, as Arkansas does?
MR. ADAMSON:
statute.

No, we do not have a direct action

I believe only two or three states. Louisiana and

Wisconsin dos but Minnesota does not.
Noif, of course, in the last analysis, Shaffer v.
Heitner is going to mean what this Court tell us what it
f

means, but our understanding of the teaching of Shaffer v.
Heitner is very simple and very, very easy to comprehend.

We

do not agree with the Minnesota Supreme Court about the lack
'•£

jil

of clarity of the opinion,
.

K

It seems to me that the heart of Shaffer comes

k

|

right out and says that the standard for determining whether
the exercise of quasi in rem jurisdiction is consistent with

lit

.

'

due process is the minimum contact standard enunciated in
•

|

J

_

International Shoe.

And you look to International Shoe and
:
you find out what are those minimal contacts. They are the
relationship among the defendant, the forum and the litigation
If you applied that yardstick to the instant case,
you would find two things immediately, and there can5t be any
argument about it, none whatsoever.

There is absolutely no

contact whatsoever between defendant Rush over in Indiana and

9
the state of Minnesota, none.

And there is absolutely no to

my understanding relationship between the litigation and the
state of Minnesota.

The only state in the union that has

any meaningful contact with this litigation would be the
state of Indiana, where everything happened, where Mr.
Savchuk was allegedly injured and where he was made well.
Thus, if you read Shaffer as I have and read inter­
national Shoe as I have Just done, that is the end of it,
there is no due process here on this quasi in rem basis.
Now, the Minnesota court took a somewhat different
view about these things.

The Minnesota court first of all

completely ignored the lack of relationship between the forum
in the s'cate of Minnesota and the litigation.
that matter completely»

It snubbed

Instead of that, it placed its pri­

mary emphasis not on the defendant but upon the residency of
the plaintiff.

>

t

Now, it may well be that the state of Minnesota has
an understandably strong public policy as enunciated by its
courts to provide its residents with a forum, but that policy
does not establish due process.

It almost begs the question.

Assuming such policy, you nevertheless must ask the question
does effecting that policy in this particular matter violate
or

ot violate the due process clause.
QUESTION:

Mr. Adamson, I assume — maybe I should

not — that your principal client is the insurance company

10
rather than the individual and there could be a conflict I
suppose here.

What I wanted to know though is assume that

the individual involved here felt as a matter of principle
that he had no contact with Minnesota and he didn't care what
the Minnesota judge said, he just wasn’t going to go up there
ancl testify.

He lives in Indiana, he wanted to stay home.

Could the Minnesota judge hold him in contempt for refusing to
respond to a notice to appear and testify in court?
MR. ADAMSON:

Mr. Justice Stevens, I would like to

answer that question in two parts.

I do consider Mr. Rush

morally and ethically my client as well as the insurance
company.
QUESTION:

I am not suggesting an athical problem,

but there is an economic -—
MR. ADAMSON:

The economic problem -- this is what

would transpire if jurisdiction were allowed in this case and
Mr. Rush would refuse to cooperate in his defense.

I think

that is the way we would put it and so forth, and a default
judgment would be entered against him.
QUESTION:

For the policy limit?

MR. ADAMSON:
QUESTION:

Yes.

But he could not be held in contempt of

court?
MR. ADAMSON:
QUESTION:

No, sir.

So really it is in the nature of a suit

11
against the Insurance company on the policy.
MR. ADAMSON:

But if Mr. Rush were to avail himself

of that privilege of not cooperating with his insurance com­
pany and what have you —
QUESTION:

And the insurance company could sue him.

MR. ADAMSOH:

— there would be quite a problem

about enforcing that judgment against the insurance company
because of his breach of the insurance contract of cooperafelon.
QUESTION:

Well* suppose at the outset of the liti­

gation he said I am simply not going to go up to Minnesota
and if you want to terminate your coverage, go ahead and
terminate it, and they terminate the coverage.

Then there is

no longer a basis for a quasi in rein jurisdiction, is there?
MR. ADAMSON':

If I understand your hypothetical,

of -course, a termination of coverage as of the time Mr. Rush
told State Farm he didn’t want any more to do with it would
not affect the period of time when there was coverage at
which time the accident had happened.
QUESTION:

But would it not extinguish their duty to

defend?

>
MR, ADAMSON:

f

QUESTION:

No, sir.

They have a duty to defend even if he

breaches his obligation to cooperate?
MR. ADAMSON:

Even if he breaches his obligation to

12
cooperate9 yes, sir.
QUESTION:

They then still have the duty to defend?

MR. ADAMSON:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

I see.

MR. ADAMSON:

So he could do that —

That period is very brief, as I under-

stand it.
QUESTION:

I see.

But you would agree that he could

not personally be subjected to any disciplina or any court
order by the judge in Minnesota.
MR. ADAMSON:

There is not a shadow of doubt in my

mind about that, Mr. Justice Stevens.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. ADAMSON:
QUESTION:

He could not be.

Well, there is not a shadow of doubt in

your mind that the Minnesota court was wrong in this case
either, as you submitted it to us, but what do you think the
Minnesota courts would hold?

The courts have held that they

have personal jurisdiction over Mr. Rush at least to the ex­
tent of the limits of liability on the insurance policy.
MR. ADAMSON:

They have held that they have quasi

in rem jurisdiction over Mr. Rush to the extent of the
liability policy.
QUESTION:

To enter a judgment against him.

MR. ADAMSON:
in this

There is no in personam jurisdiction

13
QUESTION:

— to enter a judgment against him to the

extent of the limits of liability of the liability policy.
MR. ADAMSON:
QUESTION:

Yes.

And then the —

Don’t you think it might follow In view

of the Minnesota court that the Minnesota court had the power
to punish him for contempt for refusing to obey a subpena?
MR. ADAMSON:

No, Your Honor, Mr. Justice Stewart, I

do not.
QUESTION:

You don’t —

MR. ADAMSON:

There is just no basis for it.

This

is a civil action —
QUEtSTIQN:

Well, you think there is no basis for

the Minnesota court opinion in this ease.
MR. ADAMSON:

I want to answer your specific ques­

tion without getting off on this tangent here.
civil action.

This is a

There is no process in the state of Minnesota

that can require Mr. Savchuk to come there and testify.
QUESTION:

Nothing more than a notice and a request.

MR. ADAMSON:

Yes, they can request him but they

can’t subpena him because of the limitations of the state
lires.
QUESTION:

And the penalty Is a default judgment.

MR. ADAMSON:

Default judgment, a civil penalty

which is imposed in that way but not to put him in jail or
fine him or do something of that nature.

1H
QUESTION:

The judgment that may be entered against

him is not a personal judgment.
MR. ADAMSON:
QUESTION:

Mo, sir.

It is in a sense that it would —- the

judgment entered would not be enforeible against him in another

ifj

state.

:

MR. ADAMSON:

If we are talking about a default

judgment, the answer to that is no.

If we are talking about a

judgment as a result of this case being litigated, I am not
so sure.

would he want to run off to —

sure I quite got your answer.

You might well try.

is a quasi in rem, but the assets supposedly are the policy

QUESTION:

But the race is now the security.

MR. ADAMSON:
wouldn’t work.

The race is the policy so I suppose it

But we are off on this, and this is another

is very disturbing to us and that is, while Minnesota says,

lock, we will not enforce this Judgment against Mr. Rush —
the Jury had come in for a million dollars, the policy Is
$50,000 — we will not enforce this Judgment here in Minnesota
for more than $50,000.

•jV

Now, that is all very nice because

that Is the amount of the insurance policy.

What is to pre­

vent somebody suing Mr. Rush anew some place else so they

can get some basis of jurisdiction?
QUESTION:

I know* but you would at least concede

that they couldn't sue them on that judgment for over the

$50,000.

QUESTION:

MR. ADAMSON;
QUESTION:

I can’t answer that question.

Say you started a suit on that judgment

in Indianas like you normally would to collect e judgment.
MR. ADAMSON:

lie shouldn’t be able to, but I don’t

knew the answer to that because of the very, shall we say,
unusual jurisdictional basis that we have here to begin with.
If we were playing a true quasi in rem ball game, the answer
to these questions would be all very easy.

Obviously, a

quasi in rem judgment Isn’t good for anything more than the
asset which comprises the race, and that is all you’ve got
to use to liquidate your judgment.
QUESTION:

Mr. Adamson, may I ask this question of

you.
MR. ADAMSON:
QUESTION:

Yes, Mr. Justice Powell.

Assume that the plaintiff in this case,

in order to protect himself against the possibility that
Minnesota would not have taken jurisdiction, had simultaneously

18
Instituted a personal damage suit in Indiana, the situs of the
accident.

Would that have changed the situation?
MR. ADAMSON:

Well, if he had commenced the lawsuit

in Indiana prior to the running of the Indiana statute of
limitations, of course it would change the situation and he
would have a valid in personam action going for him in Indiana
and he wouldnft need a quasi In rem proceeding in Minnesota at
all.

But after the Indiana statute of limitations has run, he

is foreclosed from doing that.
QUESTION:

Well, he may have thought it more conven­

ient to litigate in Minnesota but just as an anchor to win
with, he may also have sued in Indiana so that if his insurer
paid $50,000 in Minnesota, the plaintiff still might recover
the rest of that million dollars you mentioned in Indiana if
you had a solvent defendant, if this wa3 & 20-year-old young

But what I was asking is under Minnesota

lav would the simultaneous institution of an in personam
action in Indiana have ousted in rem jurisdiction in
Minnesota.
MR. ADAMSON:

Again, since there is no determina­

tions by any court in this area, I would be just giving you
my expert opinion.

I would think that the Minnesota court

19
under those circumstances would give comit;/ to the Indiana
action which was an in personam thing and hold their quasi

QUESTION:

MR. ADAMSON:

No one knows.

No one knows what the Minnesota courts

would do in that area.
QUESTION:

Mr. Adamson, where do you suppose the

limitation imposed by the Supreme Court of Minnesota that this
procedure is available only to residents of the forum state
came from?
MR. ADAMSON:

They told us in their opinion — I

think it was the first subject opinion, where Chief Justice
Sheran made it clear that without the plaint iff *’s connection
— we are using International Shoe language now —* without
plaintiff’s connection to the state of Minnesota, Minnesota
was —
QUESTION:

You mean by residence, by being domiciled

there.
MR. ADAMSON:

Thatfs right, by being a resident

citizen of the state of Minnesota, without plaintiff's eonnec :-ion with the state of Minnesota, Minnesota would lack
sufficient contacts with the suit to justify jurisdiction.
This is what the Minnesota Supreme Court said.
QUESTION:

But the sufficient contacts, as you are

submitting, has to do with the defendant and not the plaintiff.

20

MR. ADAMSON:

Yes, Your Honor.

And I think that to

predicate the constitutional basis of this doctrine on the
residency of plaintiffs and saying it is not available to non­
residents raises another horrible constitutional problem and
that is a denial of non-residence for the right of citizenship
in the state of Minnesota.
far as this is concerned.

The courts are closed to them as
Again, this is not before the

Court, but it illustrates the problems we get into when we
try to I think emasculate the Shaffer decision and go down
this line,
QUESTI OH:

Well,, would the Minnesota court under its

present decision after the remand under Shaffer say that a
resident of Minnesota can sue a defendant In any other state
anywhere?
MR. ADAMSON:

The Supreme Court of Minnesota in

both of its decisions held that a resident may sue a non­
resident involving any tort which occurred anywhere in the
world providing he can get garnishment jurisdiction over the
insurance company within the state of Minnesota.

I believe

that answers your* question.
QUESTION:

Well, what I am curious about is does

Minnesota law require any contacts on the part of the de­
fendant with the state?
MR. ADAMSON:
QUESTION:

None whatsoever.

Except through his insurer.

Except through the vehicle of the fact

Suppose instead of corporate stock, the plaintiff in Shaffer
had garnished in Delaware, an officers and directors liability

California and written by a company that happened to do busi­
ness in Delaware.

I cannot reach Shaffer as coming to an

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD H. BORKON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OP THE APPELLEE
MR, BORKON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The facts are simple in this case as far as how the
accident happened and where it occurred, but I think we have
to look at what Minnesota was doing after Seider v. Roth and
that type of case started out of New York, which had to do
with automobiles and automobile liability insurance.

25
In 1969, Minnesota realised that in ozkler to provide
a forum for its residents, through the legislation they did

f

pass the garnishment statute, the 571.41, adding subdivision
2

.8

„

where they definitely had in mind this type of case, such

as Savchuk v. Hush.

They felt there where there would be a

policy of insurance between a defendant and the insurance
company, where the defendant had proper notice and the plain­
tiff was a resident of the forum

02’

of Minnesota, he could

then bring the action,
They even used terms, as the Court knows, judgment,
debtor and defendant.

Following that statute, the first time

I believe that Minnesota actually looked at the statute was
in -Judge Neville's opinion in the Rlntalla case, and I think
that goes to the heart of the matter here, is Judge Neville —
and we are right in line with the Shaffer case as far as
saying fundamental fairness and contacts — that really is
the defendant getting due process under the statute and he
looked at it and said, yes, because the insurance company and
the defendant and the plaintiff are actually — you have to
look at all of them in the transaction, the automobile
accident.
?r>v

You can't just isolate it on the defendant such as

we have in the Shaffer ease.

Judge Neville then felt that

the statute was constitutional, they have applied it and
they have applied It in Minnesota over the last ten years.
So when Savchuk moved to Minnesota', actually his

26

father was transferred to Minnesota.

Some year or so later

he moved after th® accident, we received the case in our
office.
f!

Vt

Actually, the forum in Indiana, the statute of

limitations had run and, of course,, the Minnesota statute has
run now because in 197^3 when we obtained the garnishment and
this procedure started,

State Farm and along with its

defendant through the policy has been bringing it before the
court.
Now, the important part of the decisions in
Minnesota and what we look to is the fact of the insurance
company is th® real interest, th® real party in interest in
the case.

There is no question that from the time that the

accident happened, albeit in Indiana, the insurance company

"calling the shots, " is Incorrect to vise that term, but the
plaintiff after the automobile accident occurred and the
i

defendant gives notice through his Insurance carrier from
that time on, myself or as attorney for the plaintiff would
then only contact — the only contact we have is the attorney
really for the Insurance company, even though he Is representI:

QUESTION:

J

You have never run into a. ease where the

defendant Individually hired his own lawyer because he felt
the insurance company was refusing a reasonable, offer of
jlv

settlement and insisted that the Insurance company settle,
where the insurance company Is unwilling to settle?
MR. BORKON:
QUESTION:

]

Yes, in bad faith.
Or where there was a risk of a judgment

beyond the amount of the coverage.
MR. BORKOM:

That may be true, Your Honor, too.

20
Hera I think that is why the Minnesota court* the Supreme Court
and also the federal decisions* of which there are three in
Minnesota* have all stated that that will comply with the
minimum contacts and fair play and substantial justice because
you are limiting it to the $50,000, you are giving them
notice to come in to defend, but it is this relationship that
is so close between an insurance company and the defendant.
In Shaffer -QUESTION:

Mr. Borkon, I am not aure I follow your

Are you saying that this relationship between the

insurance company and the other parties is what controls in
this case?

Suppose the driver of the automobile that is

allieged to be negligent had been a Rockefeller.
i

MR. BORKON:
QUESTION:

Had been a what?
Had been a Rockefeller, with many

.millions of dollars that could have paid any deficiency
judgment, would you have dealt if you had the case originally
vita the insurance company or with the counsel for the
wealthy defendant who could pay a million dollar judgment?
MR. BORKON:
QUESTION:

I

::

Well —
I don?t understand whether you are say-

ing that Minnesota has jurisdiction in this case only because
the only party likely to respond to any judgment anywhere is
the insurance company.
MR. BORKON:

Well, it is to get jurisdiction is

29

proper because the insurance company is the on© doing business
In Minnesota.

That ia the number one insurance carrier

writing liability insurance in Minnesota.

So we look to get

the Shaffer ease with no problem because it is a particular

recognised and said when it comes to automobiles and auto­

QUESTION:

Mr. Borkon, in the original papers, the

insurance company took the position that the debt was zero,
as I understood it, because it was a contingent liability.

Right.
They never did deny that they had. an

obligation to defend though, did they?

38

No „ they nerer denied that.

MR. BORKON:
QUESTION:

Nor an obligation to pay, a conditional

obligation to pay.
MR. BORKON:

That5s correct, lour Honor.

We feel

that that is a different obligation to defend and there is an
obligation to pay and the fact that the statute 1b there, so
it takes away fro® the contingency that Mr.. Justice Stevens

t talked about.

In fact, in Minnesota you even have Interroga­

tories that can find out the policy limits for what you are
