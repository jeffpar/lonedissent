MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Me will hear' arguments

nest in 79-198® Supreme Court of Virginia v. Consumers Union

of the United States*
Mr. Attorney General® I think you may proceed
whenever you are ready now.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. MARSHALL COLEMAN, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. COLEMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice® and may it

please the Court:
•

This is a ease that arises fro© the holding in

the Bates decision on lawyer advertising.

Because the

Virginia Supreme Court promulgated a rule that banned ad­
vertising prior to Bates® it was subject to award of
' attorneys fees by a three-judge panel..

And so at issue

in this case is whether judicial immunity will stand «b
fall.
We are in a period in our history of enormous
harmony between the federal judiciary and the state
■judiciary.

But this case is really an anomaly in that be­

cause we are confronted with a punitive measure against a
court that did not act to the harm or detriment of any
party, intended no harm and wished no harm on any party.
But because it had a rule that was generally accepted, to
be valid throughout the country at the time of the Bates

4

decision ia 1977 th© thr«©-judge panel has found that at­
torneys fees that could amount to $120,000 should be assessed
against the Virginia Supreme Court and against'our Chief
Justice»
QUESTIONS

Do you concede, General Coleman,, that

the Supreme Court of Virginia is a person under 1983?
MR* COLEMANs

No.

We urged below the question of

judicial immunity and we are -QUESTION:

I am not talking about judicial immunity.

I had thought that immunity was a defense that one raised.
I think in order to have a lawsuit under 1983 you haves to
show that the person you are suing is a person for purposes
of 1983 as defined by Congress under Mon-all and related
cases.
MR. COLEMAN:

Well, during the course of this

litigation, which was quits protracted, there was — and I
think in the record there is a proposed order that could
give rise to the thought that there was a concession on
that point,

lufc during the case as it went, forward, the

states always took the position that it could not bs

that

attorneys fees could not be assessed against it, that they
would like to settle the question and that it was a matter
that was of great moment and ought to be resolved by the
federal courts.
QUESTION:

But —
Is there any connection between Mr.

s
Justice Rehaqutst's question, the subject he is bringing up
and the fact that the party named, the named parties are
the Supreme Court presumably as an entity and Lawrence
I’Anson, the Chief Justice?
MR, COLEMAN;

Weil, they n?ere named as was the

state bar.
QUESTION:

Clearly he is a person.

MR. COLEMAN;

That's right.

The fees, of course,

against him ware in his official capacity, bat he is a
person.
Nov, it is our position here that no on® was
harmed after Bates came down, arid I think it is a clear rule
of this Court that when a rule or law is declared unconsti­
tutional , then it has nc fore® or effect, that it is not
necessary for any party to take any action.

Aid I think it

is in fact recent doctrine that if the Court should change
that rule and reverse Bates, for example, that that law
could corns back into effect.

But there is no evidence in

the record or any suggestion that the Court or any officer
of the Co;. :t at any time sought to violate Bates or sought
to

enforce the rule.

They clearly did not.

What we tried to present to the court, and it
refused to hear it. below, was that the machinery was going
forward through the offices of the state bar to amend and

|

change the rule consistent with Bates.

That is not a matter

6
that, is free of difficulty, I might add.

And after I took

office 1 issued a si Attorney General's opinion for the bar
which was published and promulgated to all lawyers saying
what the impact of Bates was on the rule.

But there was

never any question involved in this case of our Supreme Court
not acknowledging the supremacy of this Court or ever trying
to enforce a rule that was in violation, of Bates, but the
court below seemed to believe that because our Supreme Court
did not with great haste change the rule subsequent to Bates(i
that these attorneys fees should properly be assessed under
1388.

And it is our position that with today's practice

that the awarding of attorneys frees against a court or
against the Chief Justice has an inhibiting effect that is
just as severa as damages.
Certainly, if the court has to stand v/hen it is
acting as the court in its judicial functions against the
dread of having attorneys fees assessed against it, the very
essence of our system of federalism and constitutional law
is at issue, oecanse than the judge is not really in the po­
sition to exercise the kind of independent judgment that he
ought to in trying cases and in making judicial rulings;
It is interesting that when the doctrine of the
case to which we all look for the best articulation of the
doctrine of judicial immunity, Bradley v. Fisher was a cass
that itself was involved with lawyer discipline.

That was a

7
case, as the Court will remember, when th© judge sought to
remove a lawyer from th© rolls within his inherent authority
to regulate the bar, and th® Court found that he could not
b@ malkeci for that decision because th® doctrine of judicial
immunity was such an important on© that has been there as
long as we have had courts.
The lower District Court seems to b© saying that
the priorities o.f our state Supreme Court should be its
priorities, and its priorities apparently were that cur
Supreme Court should: amend th© ruLs immediately.
other states didn’t and still have not.

Wall, many

Our state has now

changed that rule, but change it or not, there was no on©
who was at hazard in Virginia as a result of our not chang­
ing the rule because the law in the Bates case applied.
Now, we are not talking about the assessment of
cost

or filing fees.

great moment.

Obviously, that is not usually of

And in the Fairmont Creamery case, the court

was talking about th© need to get filing fees to continue
in business.

We are talking in this case of shifting a fee

under the 1983 statute that was put there specifically for
one purpose, which was at the invitation in part of this
Court, after the ruling in Alyeska, to permit attorneys fees
to be shifted, not to create some new remedy, not to abolish
judicial immunity or th© other immunities that existed at
law or in th© Constitution.

In fact, the report accompanying

8
bill said that: it did not create any new substantive rights.
So it is our position that, first of all, even if
you look at a. statutory construction without conceding a
constitutional dimension to the right of judicial immunity,
that certainly in this case our court, is being fined because
it had, a rule that .was .part of pur governance, in Virginia ,
that everyone thought was appropriate and valid and' legal.
Our court should not b© held to in effect punishment because
that rule was there.
otherwise.

Special circumstances should indicate

There is no hint of any bad faith on the part of

our court.
Secondly, looking at ‘the statute itself and look­
ing it the guidance that we have from several cases —
Pierson v. Ray and others —~ this Court haa found that if
the Congress is going to abolish an immunity, that it ought
to do it specifically and it ought to be manifested that it.
wanted to do that.

There is no such evidence,of that in

the reports that accompanied the adoption of 1988.
Finally, it would b© our position that the entitle­
ment to judicial immunity is so much at the core and at the
heart of a function of government that is necessary for our
Virginia Supreme Court, that the Congress ought not to fo®
able to overrule-it even if it wanted to do it.

This in

fact posas a threat to the doctrine of judicial immunity.
We are not talking about prospective relief.

We are talking

9

about attorneys fass being awarded for something that hap­
pen©! several years ago, In 1970, when ear court adopted
this rule.

We are not talking about a recalcitrance or bad

faith on the part of the court in any respect.

But w® ar®

talking about the inherent authority to manage by rulemaking
the lawyers in Virginia, which is an inherent functio® being

in jeopardy, and evory other ruling of the court being in

It is something that is? essential and is

The. question of who pays the assessments, whether

it is th® state or whether it is the court, whether it is
an individual does not. change the question before the Court,
and the question before the Court simply is what chilling
effect this decision, if it is upheld, would have on oar
j orImprudencer not only in Virgi nia and the other states,
rad in view of Davis v. Passman what affect it would have

on other judges.

Certainly, in Stump v. Sparkman this Court

seem<ad to take the immunity issue to its very limit and to
hold that in that case the judge could not be answerable for
an act he did as a judicial officer.

Certainly is this case,

unlike the characterization in the opposing brief, we don’t
have a court that was not sympathetic or sensitive to in­
dividual rights, wo don’t have a court that in any way

I think that three-judge panel certainly under­

estimated th® difficulty aad complexity of making a rule for­
th® entire regulation of the bar consistent with Bates, it
underestimated th© nature and extent of th® job that was
before it, but th® appellees in this case seem to argue that
even if the rule had been changed. that that alter the
liability of the court in this case to pay attorneys fees.
It is oar position that this trenching on judicial
immunity is a threat that it would result la th© intimidation
of the judiciary which would certainly interfere with the
functioning of our republican form of government and omr
syat m of governance.

MrV Chief Justice, and may it please

Tbs Virginia Supreme Court-'s 'disciplinary rate which
it at issue- i» this case is without: -question unconstitutional.

Her® the
QUESTION;

Ms, Brcadman, I take it you do contend

that th® Supreme Court of Virginia as an entity is a person
under Section 1983 and under 1341?

MS, BROADMAN:

Mr. Justice R@hnqu.ist, we feel that

this court, does not need to reach that question, because we did
name the chief justice in his official capacity as a defendant,
so that we clearly do have a defendant who is a person within
th® meaning of 1983.
QUESTION %

Did th® Chief Justice promulgate these

rules?
MRS, ©ROADMAN;

Well, ifc was the court, but he is a

member of the court.
QUESTION;

Well, yes, but he didn’t do itr at least

not all of them.
MS. BKG&DMAN:

No, not all of them.

He wasn’t an appropriate defendant alone

in this case, was h@?
MS. BRGADMAM:
QUESTION;

That’s correct.

Supposing you had sued just the Supreme

Court of Virginia, th© Supreme Court of Virginia as an entity,
is a person within 1983?
MS. BROAUMM?s

Well, whan w? refer to the Virginia

Supreme Court, we intended to refer to each of the members of
the supreme court in their official capacity, so when we refer

12
to it as an entity, we're really referring to each of the in­
dividual justices in their official capacity, and they are
persons, but as aa entity wo would argue that they are persons
for purposes of 1983»
Here the consumer groups only means to protect their
First Amendment freedoms was to institute this action.

The

disciplinary rule at issue hers prohibited attorneys from par­
ticipating in an attorney directory that fch© consumar groups
wanted to publish to educate the public about available legal
services.

Here the consumer groups could not appeal that rule

in order to protect their First Amendment freedoms.

They could

not publish that directory, and challenge the unconstitutional
rule through disciplinary proceedings.

Their only recourse ms

to bring this action under 1983.
The consumer groups here needed to join the Virginia
Supreme Court as a party in order to obtain complete relief
’.gainst all entities who had authority, to enforce the rule
against attorneys who participated in the directory.

Well, let me go on to the administra­

The Virginia Supreme Court in issuing its

rules is not resolving cases and controversies between the
parties by applying relevant laws.

The court is not bound by

case precedent in issuing its disciplinary rules, and there is
no right to appeal? non© of the characteristics typical of
judicial acts apply hers.

Would you call it. a legislative act, then?

MS. BR0M3MAN:

No, we would not call it legislative.

The legislature -—
QUESTION:

Because of Termy v. Brandhove?

MS. BRGADMAN:

Because here the Virginia Supreme

Court has authority to ««force the rules, it has authority
to ©•.-.force the rules independently of the State Bar Associa­
tion.

It. has inherent authority to enforce the rules, and

it also has express statutory authority under the Virginia
Code., Section 5474.

That section authorises the Virginia

court to bring a disciplinary action whenever it observes an
attorney engaging in unethical conduct.
We brought this action against the Virginia court

in its enforcement capacity.

and asking tfeeaa questions or ordering them confined until the
©rad of the session?

Would you say that was a legislative act?

MS. BRGADMANs

I'm not familiar with the case.

They

were basically just asking the state bar association for
opjxions, or —
QUESTIONS

Ho, they, were telling him that he was go­

ing to either have to desist from certain conduct, or — I
don't rerasaber the particular facts, but it was an action of
the legislature enforcing its own rules.
MS. BROADMANi

Wall, it's probably if the legislature

starts enforcing the rules, fcho purposes for legislative im­
munity

bo

longer apply.

Legislative immunity is intended to

protect legislator’s speeches and debates from interference
by the excscutiv© or judicial branch*
QUESTION:

Are. you saying that a legislative body

doesn’t have the right and the power to protect the integrity
of its own proceedings?

This was what Father Groppi was cited

for, contempt, for interfering with the proceedings of the
legislature.

You say that's something, that's not a legis­

lative act?
MS, BROADMAN:
QUESTIONS

Well, enforcing —

When they find someone in contempt?

25
MS.* BROADMANs

Well, enforcing their own proceedings

is somewhat different than enforcing the laws that they issue.
At the point when the legislature starts enforcing laws that,
it issues, it's no longer acting within a legislative capacity.
QUESTION:

The Congress of the United States until

recent tines enforced its contempt determinations by decreeing
confiheasent ©f a person in contempt, and because it was such a
burdensome thing? they finally passed a statute giving that
authority to the United States courts*

But if they enforced

'that? they enforced contempt order a, d© you say that's not a
legislative act?
MS. BROADM&Ns

No? that is a legislative acre because

it’s inherently involved in permitting th«r, to freely speak?
debate? gather information in order to pass laws? and that
whole process through which laws are passed.16' protected by
legislative immunity.

But once a law is passed? the minute

the legislature assumes responsibility for enforcement?
typically'it’s not the legislature that enforces? legislative
immunity no longer applies.

You're no longer within the legis­

lative realm*
It would be wholly contrary to the doctrine set forth
•V

in Ex parts v. Young a hundred years ago to apply legislative
immunity here*

During the past hundred years? many times

this court has held that enforcement entities are subject to
actions for prospective relief from unconstitutional —

QUESTION?

What would be — suppose the Congress

passes a law and you sued all hundred Senators, for example,
for having passed an unconstitutional act, which you claimed
was unconstitutional.

Would they have immunity from defending

that suit?
MS. BROADMAN:

Yes, they would.

But that's very

different than th® case before the Court now.
QUESTION:

Does your characteriz&tion of this as

administrativa and not judicial and'not legislative, is that
motivated in any way by our cases of Pierson v. Say and Tenny
V. Brand hove and Buts v. Econcsaou?
MS. BROADMAN:

Well, we argue that it's administra­

tive in nature because we believ© it is administrative, and
■it's not necessarily motivated by all those cases.

Court is doing does not look at all like a typical judicial

If the Virginia Supreme Court regulated doctor par­

conduct in the state?

MS . BROADM&N:
QUESTION:

0 h-huh.

Coaid you sue 'feli® members of the Virginia

MS. BROADMM?s

No.

We would sue whoever was respon­

her®.

Me brought the action against the tv® entities with

authority to enforce the unconstitutional disciplinary rules.
QUESTION:

Well, I suppose one easy way, on© certain­

ly sure-fire way of raising the validity of the rule is if the
Virginia court moved against somebody to enforce the rule-.
MS. BROADMAH:

W© could not do that here.

None of

the attorneys in Virginia were willing to participate in that
directory.
QUESTION:

I knew.

But. let's assume that the Supreme

Court was enforcing the rules against some lawyer.

He could

certainly raise then the constitutionality of the rule?
MS. BRGABMAB:
QUESTION:

Sure.

He could resist on the grounds that it

was unconstitutional.
MS. BRGADM&N:
QUESTION:

That's true.

And I suppos® if he won. he could get

MS. BROADMAN:

If he prevailed? that's correct.

But I not© her© the consumer groups, because the attorneys
/

were unwilling to participate in the directory, their only

29
jaeans to challenge the rule was by instituting a suit.

In

th© record below there is documentary evidence that there

In Bates there

were attorneys who were willing to advertise in order to
challenge the rule, but that's not the situation here.
QOESTICSI:

Ms. Broadiaan, I understood you to say in

answer to Justice Whits ' s question that you had the procedural
situation you had in Bates, that the lawyers could get fees

I don't under «stand that to be the case.

MS. BRO&PMAMs

Well, I guess — no, no, that's true,

because there •*QOSSTXOWs

You’re correct? that’s right.

QUESTION:

And of course Hutto, on which you rely

very heavily, is a case in which I suppose it would have been
appropriate to award damages against the prison officials.
But

think you concede no damages could be awarded here.
MS. BfSG&DM&Ns

We’re not seeking damages.

All we’r©

seeking ia prospective declaratory and injunctive relief so
that we can publish this consumer directory.

QUESTION:

To the extent that Hutto analogized the

free recovery to punative and all the rest of it, analogizes
that the damage is, and it seems to m© cuts against you to a
certain extent.
X think you must concede that you could1 not gat

Yes.- I'll concede that we could not

But in Hutto v. Finney, there were two bases
There ar® two fee awards.

The first on©

was on the basis of bad faith, and
QUESTIONS

That basis of the opinion cuts against

you, the basis of fees as part of cost cuts for you.
MS. BROADMANs

My reading of the bad faith ~~ wall,

the Courts need" not reach that question, because you're de~
\

%

ciding the ease hare on the basis of statutory interpretation
the Civil Rights Attorney Fee Award Act.

If that act did

not exist, though, we would argue that fee awards are ancillary
to declaratory injunctive prospective relief, and therefore
wholly distinct frees damages.

Damages are retroactive reim­

bursements;; fee awards are merely awards which enable people
to bring actions to obtain prospective relief, to stop unconstituttonal governmental acts.
QUESTION!

But as I understand your brief, yen do

rely primarily on the federal statute, the attorneys fee award
act, in which reliance you don't have to recover your damages
and the question of bad faith and all the rest of it is totally
irrelevant?
MS, BRQADMANi

Exactly.

That's correct.

32
QUESTION:

Well, if the Supreme Court, of Virginia

moved against a particular lawyer for violating one of its
rules , and the lawyer defended ©» the ground that the rule is
unconstitutional *

He lost,, final judgment against him in the

Virginia Supreme Court.
Then your organization brings a suit against the
individual justices of the Virginia Supreme Court for an in­
junction.

You sue in the federal court, asking that those

judg -s be enjoinc.-d from deciding cases that way because they re

wrong.
Would those judges, would they be immune from that
kind of a suit?
MS. BROADMAMs

I think in that situation what we’d

foe saying is not that they cant decide the case that way,
but —
QUESTION:

Well, you’d say, "Your rules are uncon­

stitutional, and therefore you must not decide" —
MS. BROADMAN:

I think that’s a distinct situation,

because thure the court is acting in a capacity of deciding
cases in controversy.

then ia your suit, la federal court?
MS. BROADMAisfs

Well, I think as I understand it,

you're assuming now that that judgment somehow interferes with
our First Amendment rights?
QUESTION:
here.

Well, you make the same claim as you do

"Judge? you've just upheld this rule ef yours" —
MS. BROADMMs
QUESTIONS

Unconstitutional»
"and you're wrong.

We're going to en­

join you from deciding cases like that any more»"
MS. BRO&DHAK:

Well, I think in that situation, the

court is interpreting the rule.

Ifc9s just enforcing the rule.

The rule on its face violares constitutional rights.

In that

situation, consumer groups could sue the court only because
it enforces a.u unconstitutional disciplinary rule, apart from
deciding the cases and controversies, because that court can
independently go out and initiate proceedings against attorneys
in violation of constitutional rights.
So 1 think there the consumer groups could bring an
.notion, if the court was applying an unconstitutional rule in
way that violated their constitutional rights.
QUESTION:

Now, let me ask you a question that re­

lates somewhat to that.

It’s clear that you brought the

action against the Chief Justice I*Ansoii> including him, be­
cause the court had adopted, and promulgated this rule.

QUESTION:

Than how would you gat here?

Where

Would be the person?
MS. BEOMSMAN;

Well, we would bring an action against

You didn’t bring that kind of an action,

QUESTION:

Yes, I know.

But the names *— the other

justices ar@ not named, are they?
MS. BROADMANs

No, they are not.

Let vaa just point out that many situations, people
will bring actions against a board, an administrative hoard,
and they'll brine? it against the named head of the hoard and
the whole board, even though everyone on that board may not
have voted in favor of the particular regulation, so that 1
don't think this situation is all that different.

I think it

was sufficient to name the Chiaf Justice and the court.
Yes?
QUESTION:

Back up a minute.

You ask lawyers to

take legal action on this on their own, and they refused to.

MS. BROADMAN;

We asked attorney© whether they'd be

willing, you know.
QUESTIONS

Now, suppose they did advertise in your

directory and they were ordered to be disbarred, and they
sued the Supreme Court that disbarred them.

On®, could they

sue vhe Supreme Court in the federal court?

MS. BRGRBMANj

Could consumers Union sue, is that

what you're saying?
QUESTION;

Could the lawyers?

The lawyers.

No.

No.

Because that —

And Mo. 2, therefor© he can't get counsel

fees?
MS. BRO&DM&H;
QUESTION;

That's correct.

How does it so happen that you can?

MS. BROADMAN;

Because the lawyer has procedures that

•the lawyer is supposed to follow to review that disciplinary
proceeding.

The lawyer appeals from the disciplinary decision

of the Virginia Bar and to the Virginia Supreme Court, and then
has a right to appeal up to ..the United States Supreme Court.
QUESTION;

Yes, but —

MS. BRQADMAN:

-We don't.

But Justice Marshall's question is, those

I don't think where there are proper appellate procedures and
those procedures are adequate that a party can turn around and
sue a judge.

The only tiro® that they can bring these kinds of

actions is where there's no appeals, no other recourse.
QUESTION;

My point is, aren't you asking us to opart

the door where anybody can do what a lawyer can't do?
MS, BROADMAN;

Well, no.

I think you can assure

that people follow proper appellate procedures if you clarify
where they exist, they must be followed.

The doctrines of

comity prevent people from bringing these actions to circum­
vent existing appellate procedures.
QUESTION?

But comity doesn't apply to you?

MS. BROADMAN:

To us, because — that's correct, be*

causa there was no other recourse that wa had.
QUESTION:

I want to get this straight, now.

If we

and there's no immunity therefore? and you can get attorneys
fees, you could also get damages?
MS. BROADMAN:

Well, the standards applied to

The court may want to characterise this

as an administrative judicial act and preserve the immunities
that exist for damages, but not for declaratory and injunctive
relief.

Bat if the court characterizes this as a wholly ad­

ministrative act then the same standards would apply as apply
to other administrative officials.
Where courts are issuing disciplinary rules, there
will rarely be any cases where people can obtain damages.
People aren't going to bs able to show the panel of eight
judges are acting in bad. faith.

But it's only a qualified immunity that

40
ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. MARSHALL COLEMAN, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF TEE APPELLANTS—REBUTTAL
MR, COLEMAN:
Justice.

A couple of comments, Mr. Chief

It is our position that the remedy in a case like

this would b® an appeal„ that that has been the rule of this
Court, that in the Virginia Supreme Court the partias could
have appealed the petition to the Supreme Court to have a
ruling on the question of the rule and if they had lost they
could have then appealed it to this Court,

But it is not

appropriate for them to go at this collaterally, which in
effect is a review of what our highest District Court has

done
There i3 nothing that the Suprema Court did in
its capacity as the Supreme Court that deprived tltsra of any
right.

In fact, they are not even the prosecutor in these

cases.

They simply hear cases that are brought to them by

the state bar.

So in this case the doctrine of judicial

immunity is certainly a hasard, whether you call this im­
munity legislative or judicial, and it has been I think
wall briefed that judicial immunity is the proper denomin­
ation here because it is an inherent right in the court to
regulate the practice of law.

There is also an argument

that this is rulemaking that is legislative in nature,
whatever the immunity is identified as, it is on© that
should be absolute and that should not foe broaches here.

But

41
The remedy should simply be a petition by a lawyer or by
sane other group to the court.

And as I said in my opening

remarks, there is no evidence, there is no act at all doneon the part of the court to the prejudice of the Consumers
Union and, despite the finding in Bates and the changing of
the rule, this directory has not yet been published but that
is not because of anything that the Supreme Court of
Virginia did.

It should be able to continue to operate on

the basis that it is immune from its judicial acts and the
judgment below should be reversed.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, counsel.

The case is submitted..
(Whereupon, at 3:01 o'clock p.m., the case in the
