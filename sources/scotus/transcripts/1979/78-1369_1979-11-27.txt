MRa CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

Mr. Pfeffer, I think you may proceed -whenever
you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEO PFEFFER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. PFEFFER;

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may

it please the. Court;
This case presents another chapter, but I'm
afraid, not the last chapter, in the continuing effort, now
more than a decade old, in efforts by the legislature of the
State of New York to appropriate moneys raised through taxation
c>f all citizens, irrespective of their religion, to finance
schools closed to many for no reason other than their religion.
QUESTION;

Well, does tills statute not cover"-

MR. PFEFFER:
QUESTION:

Pardon’

Does this statute not cover schools that

c.re not religiously sponsored’
MR. PFEFFER;

This statute covers private schools

that are not religiously sponsored, but I have no idea why
one of the private schools which are not religious, Horace
Mann, has joined in this suit as intervener.
We do not challenge the constitutionality of
this law; this was decided by this Court previously.

But

•

4
insofar as non-religious schools are concerned, therees
no constitutional barrier to the type of statutes here
involved.
The challenge here is exclusively to schools
which exclude, and claim the right to exclude under the
free exercise clause, persons who are not of their religion
to which the school is dedicated.
The question—specifically, the question presented
in this case is the constitutionality under the establishment
clause of a state statute providing reimbursement to religious
schools for the cause of mandated record-keeping and test.ng.
1 think there is the prior history of this
statute is significant to the determination of the constitu­
tionality of the present statute.

The prior statute provided

for financing by pupil allotment the cost of tests prepared
by church schools, which might be used for religious instruction,
and which lacked auditing provisions.
The statute was held unconstitutional by this
Court in Levitt v. Committee for Public Education and Religious
Liberty,

Then a new statute, providing payment for teachers'

services, and conducting State-prepared tests, and in
pupil attendance reporting, was enacted.
This was to be on an actual cost, rather than a
per pupil allotment.

The law was held unconstitutional by

the district court in 1976.

On appeal, this Court vacated.

5
the judgment? and remanded the case for reconsideration in
the light of its concurrent decision in Wolman against Walter
On remand, the district court held by a vote of
2-1 that while the original decision was correct on the
basis of then-existing law? the law from Lemon against
Kurfcsman through Meek against Pittenger? Wolman?

and I quote

to you? relaxed some of Meek8s constitutional strictures
against state aid to sectarian schools? and it revived the
more flexible concept that aid to a sectarian'school3s

a high degree of certainty that the aid will only have a
secular value of legitimate interest to the State? and does
r.ot present any appreciable risk of being used to aid in
the transmission of religious viextfs? end of quotation.
In its original decision? the Court had held
that the statute had
advanced religion.

principal and primary effect which

And therefore the Court did not find it

recessary to pass on the question of whether it3s unconstitu­
tionally

fostered excessive entanglement with religion.
On remand? the majority of the district court

held that the statute passed muster here? too.
It is our contention that Wolman does not mandate
either a more flexible concept in respect to the establisliment
clause? nor determination upholding the constitutionality
of the new statute.

6

Specifically as to the latter, we urge that
Wolman is clearly distinguishable from the facts, and
therefore does not mandate

a holding of constitutionality.

As to the more flexible interpretation of the
establishment clause, we urge that the decisions of this
Court

as to Wolman manifest no intention to overrule sub

silento what has been held in all relevant cases, in 1971
through Meek and thereafter.
Wolman, we submit, is

clearly distinguishable,,

There the Court expressly noted that the Ohio statute
there in issue did not authorise . any payment to non-public
school personnel, nor did the non-public school personnel
participate in the drafting or scoring of the tests.
The Court said in Wolman, and I should like to
quote it, "These tests are used to measure the progress of
students in secular subjects.

Non-public school personnel

are not involved in either the drafting or the scoring of the
tests.

The statute does not authorize any payment to non-public

school personnel for the costs of administering the tests."
And what I consider a very significant footnote,
footnote 7, the Court said, and again I quote, "No nations!
aid is involved in Ohio.

The tests themselves are provided.

And further, it does not,*—the statute,-—"does not reimburse
schools for costs incurred in tests.
the non-public school or parent."

No money flows to

7
And the rest of the quote is in my brief.
In the present ease, religious schools are involved
in the scoring of the tests.

Payment for the services is made,

not to an outside secular testing corporation, nor even to the
religious school’s teaching personnel, but to the religious
school itself, which we suggest, represents an even more
flagrant violation to the establishment clausa.

Nor as in

Woliaan is the grading done by an outside secular corporation,
but by the personnel of the religious school itself.
Testing, I suggest, is universally recognized by
educators as being part of the teaching process.
QUESTION:

Who pays for the testing in the public

schools?
MR. PFEFFER:

The taxpayers who control the public

schools.
The thesis which I believe all the decisions of
this Court is predicated upon is that if an institution is
supported by taxes paid by all, irrespective of their
religion, the money so raised cannot be used to finance
educational institutions—I don't go beyond that*--educational
institutions which are closed to some of the taxpayers for
\

no reason other than religion.
QUESTION:

Do you think testing is more or less

neutral than textbooks, or—
MR, PFEFFER:

I think that this Court indicated

8

in VJoiraan that it was not happy with the decision in respect
to textbooks, but it felt bound by the fact that in 1968 the
majority of this Court found the loaning of textbooks to be
constitutional.
But—QUESTION:

How about transportation?

MR0 PFEFFERs

Let me finish with textbooks first,

and Is11 come to transportation.

But the Court made it quite

clear, by its decision in that case, that it was not going
to go one inch beyond what it was mandated to do under the
basis of stare decisis, by the textbook case.
In respect to transportation, I think a better
case—although I personally do not agree with the decision,
nor did five justices who dissented—transportion I think
can foe justified—
QUESTION:

Hoxi? can five justices dissent?

MRo PFEFFER:

Four justices; four justices dissented

sorry; it was a 5-4 decision.
That in the Everson case, the bus transportation
case, I think a reasonable case can made for the argument
that this is like medical and dental lunches, a welfare rather
than an educational expenditure.
And in respect to welfare, health, and so on,
exclusion of pupils in parochial schools would probably
violate the equal protection clause; might—-might violate it.

9

Her as in Woiman is the grading done by outsi.de secular
corporations, but the personnel of the religiotis school
itself.
Testing is universally recognized by educators
as being part of the teaching process.
QUESTION:

Would you think it was constitutional

if the tests were sent in to the State Board of Education,
let them do all the-—
MR» PFEFFER:
QUESTION:

No, I do not think so.

Then it isn’t very important where

they’re graded, is it?
MR. PFEFFER:

Is it not very important whether--?

Well, from my viewpoint, it is not.
£iome defensibility.

But it has at least

I think why .it's not significant,

important, is because it is a educational service.
I think the case is more grievous where this
educational testing is done by religious teachers, and you
cannot even, even in the statute here which provides that
essay questions are marked, are graded initially—initially
fcy the parochial school personnel, you cannot divorce the
personal religious predilections of the tester from the
grading of the paper.

It just—I don't think a person

committed to religion can divide himself into two parts and
close his eyes to answers which violate what he believes to be

10
God's word.
In respect to record-keepingf I come to this now,
recall the Court's attention to Walz v. Tax Commission, where
it upheld tax exemption for churches on the grounds that
non-exemption would have required the government to audit
and examine the operations and records of churches, and thus
entangle it in their religious affairs.
The Court said, obviously a direct money subsidy
would be a relationship pregnant with involvement, and as
with most governmental grant programs, could encompass
sustained, detailed administrative relationships for enforce­
ment of statutory or administrative standards.
We call this Court's attention to Lemon v. Kurtzman,
and Earley v. DiCehso.

There, the Court struck down statutes’

providing financial aid to church schools to compensate them
for so-called non-ideological services.
on page 15 of my brief.

The full quotation

is

I respectfully call the Court's

attention to the italicized sentences, which I should like to
read briefly.
There, in that case, the Court said:

The program

requires the government to examine the school's records, in
order to determine how much of the total expenditure is
attributable to secular education and how much to religious
activity.

The present statute requires that.
Then, later on, the Court said:

In particular, the

11
government's post audit power to inspect and evaluate the
church-related school's financial records, ar..d to determine
which expenditures are religious and which are secular creates
an intimate and continuing relationship between church and state.
May I suggest to the Court that if a school

hands

in a record saying, we spend X hours for taking attendance,
and no mere, and the amount there indicated for taking
attendance is disproportionate to other, public schools, time
spent in those schools for record-keeping, there would be an
obligation upon the state to inspect and examine how come
you spent three times as much time on attendance taking than
outside schools7
That very question, and the obligation of the
religious schools to answer that, entangles states in religion;
end I think it's constitutionally impermissible»
QUESTION:

Mr. 3Jfeffer, supposing a state adopted

a program whereby it said that any school which had a system
of lights for its stadium would be reimbursed for athletic:
events conducted in the stadium, but not for any educational
event conducted in the stadium.

And it was drawn tc the

state's attention that a particular parochial—this was
state—this was public schools and parochial schools.

And it

was drawn to the state!s attention that a particular
parochial school was sending in bills that were twice as high
as a public school, and the answer given by the school is,

we conduct twice as many athletic events?
MR. PFEFFER:

I don't quite know whether the racial

aspect of ycur question is significant.

If it

is, then I'd

say that the tests in respect to entanglement just doesn’t
&PPly ho race.

On the contrary, the courts are—governments

are very entangled in seeking to remedy history of past
discrimination with respect to race.
QUESTION:

Well, we're not talking about race here.

3 thought it was religion.
MR. PFEFFER;

Yes, indeed.

I would say that any

kind of testing, any kind of supervision, any kind of
" determination as to expenditures which are religious, as from
those which are secular, constitute impermissible entanglement.
QUESTION;

Okay.,

Well, then answer ray question as

to whether a state program and provides any school, parochial
or public, which has a stadium that is lighted at night will
be reimbursed by the state for any athletic event conducted in
the stadium, but not for any scholastic events conducted.
a particular parochial school sends in a bill to the state
that's twice as high as any public aschool.
And there answer, when the state questions then
as you say they must, is, just that we play twice as many
football games as the public schools.
MR. PFEFFER:

I could answer that by suggesting

that you could justify even—-I would not—but you could

And

13
justify on the basis of the decisions of this Court, the
expenditure of state funds for purposes related to the health
of the pupils.

And if you could make an arguable case--if

you could make an arguable case, that football is so related--!
do not agree with it—-but if you could make an arguable case
that football is so related to the healthiness of the students,
I think the Court has ruled in respect to gymnasiums you may
not, but in respect—-football is so related to the health of
the students that it is not part of the educational process;
perhaps.
Personally, I would not accept that argument; but
the Court, might very well.
QUESTION:

You emphasized the entangelentent aspect

ei few mirutes ago, Mr.

Pfeffer.

Now, the states—-all of the

states, I think, reserve the right to inspect and call for
reports cn the qualifications of the teachers in private
schools and the curriculum and the other conduct to see that
it meets minimum state standards; is that not true?
MR# PFEFFER:
to.

It does—-well, it does not require it

I think—
QUESTION:

that, do they not?

Well, but in fact, the states all do
They don’t just assume that every private

school is teaching all the things they should teach?
MR» PFEFFER:
answer is no.

My answer to' that is—-I think the

Suppose a parent, for non-religious reasons,

14
is disgusted with our whole school system, public, private,
parochial, non-parochial, and says, we can teach the child
better ourselves at home.
tutional right to do so.

1 think that parent has a consti­
But the state also has a constitution­

al right under its police power to impose such tests upon that
child to determine whether that child has, in effect, been
given the equivalent of a school education, and the parent has
therefore complied with the statutory obligation to see to it
that a child receives a basic primary education.
QUESTION:

States do that with respect to all the

pupils in all the religious schools, do they not?
MR. PFEFFER:
QUESTION:

But they don’t finance it.

No, no, but they do come into the schools

and test and require them to make reports.
Now, that’s quite a bit of entanglement, isn't it?
MR. PFEFFER:
QUESTION:

Well, the—

They audit.

MR. PFEFFER:

They audit.

Only if—well, if there is no

alternative, if the state comes in and determines the amount
to be paid to that school on the basis of how many school
children are present and how many are not present, whether
how many are excused for lawful absanse and how many not excused,
I think that constitutes an entitlement which, while—which is
forbidden by the establishment clausa.
In the broadest sense the other critical issue

15
now before the Court is, we suggest, as a majority held
whether—rather the majority held this Court has relaxed some
of the Meeks constitutional strictures against state aid to
parochial schools? and if it has, were the relaxations of
sufficient magnitude to justify the decision in this case,
find it's to this issue that I will devote the balance of my
initial presentation.
We suggest that the district court was in error in
assuming that this Court has retreated from its prior-—takes
this position in respect to aid to parochial schools.

The

•srror of this assumption is manifested in the Court's dis[>osition of three cases which came to it after Wolman.
The first of these was New York v. Cathedral
Academy, decided in the same term as Wolman, but after Wo/.man.
3!n that case, the Court said that if the challenged statutes

Eiuthorized payments for the identical services, that ought to
be reimbursed under the law held unconstitutional in Levitt.
It was invalid for the same reasons that the previous law was
beId invalid.
If on the other hand, it empowered the New York
Court of Claims to make an independent audit on the basis of
which it was to authorize reimbursement for clearly—for the
rake of the services, such a detailed inquiry would iteslf
impel impermissible entanglement.
The very inquiry, the very going in there to check

16
constitutes entanglement.

That's what the Court said in

Cathedral Academy; it's not less true here.

The Court there

said, the prospect of church and state litigating about what
does or does not have a religious meaning touches the very
core of the constitutional guarantee against religious
establishment.

And it cannot be dismissed by saying that it

will happen only once.
The second indication that the Court in Wolman
did not intend to water down or retreat from the principles
announced in Meek v. Pittenger, is indicated from it3 popinion
this year in NLRB

v. Catholic Bishop of Chicago.

There the Court said, and I quote again, only
recently we again noted the importance of the teacher's
function in a church school, whether the subject is remedial
reading, advanced reading, or simply reading.

A teacher

remains a teacher, and the danger that religious factors will
become entwined with secular instruction persists.

And cates

Meek v. Pittenger for that proposition.
It is, we respectfully submit, not-—-most unusual
for the Court to base it s determination on a decision, which
c.s the court below held, it had so recently compromised.
Finally, we should also like to call the Court s
position a bare six months ago of the case of Byrne v. Public
Funds for Public Schools of New Jersey.

Thera the Court

summarily affirmed a Court of Appeals decision invalidating a

17
provision in -the New Jersey income tax law granting tax
benefits to parents who pay tuition for children attending
religious schools.

That decision held that under this Court's

1973 in Committee for Public Education and Religious Liberty v.
Myquisfc, the challenged New Jersey law could not stand.
The affirmance in Byrne, we suggest, cannot be
easily reconciled with the district court's assumption in the
present case, that this Court has retreated from all that it
has held , and it has said through the many cases from Levitt
to the presen t time.
May I conclude with this—conclude with this.

These

cases are based on the implicit categorical imperative that
it is morally wrong, and constitutionally impermissible, to
compel all persons, regardless of their religion, to pay taxes
used to finance the operations of schools from ^hich some of
them are excluded solely because of their religion.
I would like to reserve the balance of my time.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Pfeffer.

Mrs. Siegel.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. SHIRLEY ADELSON SIEGEL, ESQ„,
ON BEHALF OF THE STATE APPELLEES.
MRS® SIEGEL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The state law that is before you today is simply
V

incidental to an historic and very long-standing state function

18
and responsibility to see that attendance is taken in the
schools at the elementary and secondary school level throughout
the state, and to see that certain minimum standards of
educational achievemeiit are met by administering state-prepared,
state-mandated tests at certain levels.
The public schools which abide by these identical
requirements, are compensated through the rather generous—
it's currently running $3.6 billion a year—state aid to the
local school districts, and the non-public schools are compen­
sated under this Act.
Now, this Court, as my—
QUESTION:

When you say "compensated," that nor.

public schools are compensated, are you referring to the—that
the non-public school costs of the examination and the
attendance record i.s paid for by the—
MRSo SIEGEL:

By this Act which is before you today.

Now, the prior act, which had a similar purpose,
which wa3 held to be a proper secular purpose by the Court
which it lecided the Levitt case,

was invalidated because

of the fact that that act has included reimbursement for
teacher-prepared tests which were deemed to be such a part of
the overall, integrated teaching process which was part of a
religious mission of many of these schools that it permeated
and, in effect, poisoned the well for the entire statute, and
since they were lump sura payments being made, based on the

19

number of pupils in each school under that act, it is
impossible for the Court to disentangle the amount, and to
determine just how much of it would go for proper secular
purposes.
And I would like to read thefinal paragraph of the
Court there, which was the basis for the statute which was
then promptly adopted by the state and is before you today;
Since Chapter 138 provides only for a single per-pupil
allotment for a variety of specified servicers, some secular
and some potentially religious, neither this Court nor the
district court can properly reduce that allotment to an
amount corresponding to the actual costs incurred in performing
reimbursable secular services.
I

That is a legislative, not a judicial function.

And

so with Ilia adoption of this new statute, the appropriations
dropped by from $28 million to $8 million a year, where they're
now constant.
Now—
QUESTION:

Mrs. Siege]?

MRS o SIEGEL;
QUESTION;

Yes.

Is it true that the private schools which

obtain the reimbursement in New York State exclude people
kecause of religion?
MRSs SIEGEL;

The intervenor schools that are

involved in this proceeding have in their answers to

20

interrogatories indicated that they do not exclude students
on the basis of religion; however, under New York law, the
schools do have the privilege of filing a form, which is in
the record, and which indicates that they want to avail them­
selves of the privilege which the law gives religiously
affiliated schools of limiting their student bodies to
children of a certain faith.
QUESTION:

I had understood Mr. Pfeffer to say

categorically that they simply eliminated them on the—
excluded them on the basis of religion.
MBS, SIEGEL:

While the schools, many of them,

have filed such forms, it is my understanding—and Mr. Nolan
will be able to address himself to that specifically, since
he represents the intervennor independent schools here today,
that these particular schools have answered interrogatories
that they do not.

They do not discriminate on the basis

of students or faculty.

And in fact such allegations in the

complaint were flatly denied by the

intervenor-defendant.

Now, the main thrust of the challenge to the new
statute is that it does not give substantial direct aid bo the
sectarian enterprise as a whole.

Yet this Court has rejected

the argument in several cases that just the freeing up of
private funds to make some money available for sectarian
purposes would not invalidate a statute which had its own
proper secular purpose, and which was not otherwise an

21

entangelemenfc, or did not liave the primary effect of
advancing religion..
The—actually under this new statute, by far the
lion's share of the money is going to the keeping of
attendance records? 86.5 percent last year, which seems to
be typical.

And this is largely going for the salaries—-

an allocated portion of the gross salary of the personnel
in the school that take attendance.
The dissent has—-and also, my learned adversary—has
belittled the state's interest in attendance-keeping,
stating that after all, taking pupil attendance is
essential to the school's sectarian function.

also

But this is not

a function of the state which is to be belittled.
Truancy is very much of a court matter.

MRSo SIEGEL:
QUESTION:

MRS» SIEGEL:

Yes, they do.

These records are

official records which must be retained for quite a few
years.

And the truancy officers may be requested by the

non-public school to come in from the public school district,
or they may because of the court’s direction or acting on
other complaints, come directly into the school.
QUESTION:

Is there any claim that that’s part of

the entanglement here?
MRS„ SIEGEL:
action.

That has not been claimed in this

I don't know whether my adversary would claim that.

But nothing's been said about it.
Now, of course, the fact that there's an incidental
benefit to the px'ivate school in that it would like to have
pupil attendance records anyway is an incidental benefit
which certainly should not detract from the secular purpose
of attendance-keeping which is such a fundamental child
welfare service.
The incidental.benefits in the Sunday closing laws
and in the busing case, and ever since—-and in other decisions
of this Court have been held to be there.

I mean, it may be

an incentive to parents to send their children to pcirochial
schools, or it may certainly confer some benefit on the

23

school, but it is not in and of itself a reason for
invalidating a statute, just because they might have some
incidental benefit from it.
The attendance records are so much like child
welfare records that one tends really to think it's reasonable
to include them in the same category as busing or school
lunches or providing lights for athletic fields, services
which are so totally secular and non-ideological in
character, and here, very much part of a welfare system.
And we recall that in the Everson case, when busing
was upheld, the analogy there was made to the service of
having a policeman available to the schools, and streets and
sidewalks and so on.

And keeping attendance and providing the

welfare services that go with it is really in that category.
Now

in the Wolman case—-and I do not think that

the question before the'Court today turns on whether in
Wolman it has retreated from Meek.

To us, it's all quite

And we find that the case that we're presenting

to you falls neatly within the parameters that have been
set within these rather definite adjudications, which have
been very helpful guidelines to the legislature.
In Wolman, the matter of secular, non-ideological
tests was squarely before the Court, paid for by the state.
And it was held that this was perfectly acceptable; there
was no primary effect to advance treligion.

The school had

24
had no control over the tests, just as here.
The logical basis for making any distinction between
contributions in kind and in cash to the school would seam to
falter if you have, as here, a situation where it is possible
to trace the dollars with such precision.

It is indeed so

ministerial and such nonjudgmental kind of audit that has to
be made, or.ce—in fact, an exhibit in this record shows a
typical teacher's time record showing one-quarter hour for
taking attendance.

There are normal ranges that are well

known to the state education department as to how long it
should take to take attendance.

If someone exceeds that

range, they may then look to see whether this is a particularly
large school; there may be other factors.
up a phone.

Or they may pack

The answer to the interrogatories by one of the

intervenor-defendants indicates that there had been a phone
call.
And in fact, I noted with interest that as to that
intervenor-defendant, the amount of money they had received
was substantially less than they had requested.

And I think

it was because they probably had included the time of their
own attendance officer, which is not something for which the
state reimburses.
The state reimburses only for the attendance keeping.
Now, the state reimbursement here is for a very special
service, aside fromthis over 86 percent of this money which

25

goes for the attendance keeping, child welfare service, there
is an annual statistics report on pupil enrollment, facilities
that are available, the number of handicapped children, and
so on, and that is the same information that comes in from
public schools throughout the state.

It is immediately com­

puterized and made available and used for somany various
purposes that it's really—it's hard to identify.
But it is the basic profile of the schools through­
out the state.

The balance of the money goes for administering--

administering is a very good word, because they're really
administrative tasks almost entirely.
and state-required tests.

The state-prepared

And these can very briefly be

described to you.
First, there are the reading and math tests which
are totally objective, and which are given to all third
grade and siscth grade students throughout the state, whether
they're in public or non-public schools.
This-—it happens that these tests developed out
of the Federal Act Title I of the Elementary and Secondary
Education Act of 1965, and the results of the test, which are
given to the state, target the schools where there are
low-achieving pupils, who will then be made available—made
eligible for the resources under the Federal Act.
They are scored by the teachers, and the rating

26

guides are given so that the teachers don’t even have to make
any independent judgment as to whether two and two is four,
because the answers are all set down for them.
The next group of tests for which reimbursement
is provided, are basic competency tests, which are now being
required.

In June of this year for the first time, all high

school graduates throughout the state, in order to get
their diplomas, have to pass a math and reading test, and
that is something that is required of these schools as well,
and--the giving of such a tests, which is marked—has no
essay questions at all, marked at the schools, is reimbursed.
And finally, in the more-—in the example to which
I believe Mr. Pfeffer referred, are the Regents Examinations.
These, again, are prepared by tie state, and they are marked
initially by the teachers of the schools.

These are exami­

nations which are given for college-bound students; not all
secondary school students take these tests.
The satisfactory completion of the state-designed
courses of study which lead to the Regents Examination,
and together with the taking of those courses and so on,
may make a student eligible for a Regents diploma, which is
a special diploma, considered meaningful by our state
university, for example, for admission purposes; and a historic
tradition that goes way back.
Row, it’s since 1865 that these Regents

27

Examinations have been given statewide to secondary school
students who were eligible, and without any distinction
between public and nonpublic schools.
Since 1904—QUESTION:

Is there a cost figure for that particu­

lar test reflected in the record?
MRSo SIEGEL:

The amount of money, according to the

answers of the defendant-intervenors here, it would seem
that perhaps 8-9 percent of the money that they've been
receiving from the state under this Act is for their
activity in connection with the Regents Examination.
The—preparing for the examinations, they are
given in 20 different subjects.

They are all wholly non—

wholly objective, except that there are some essay questions
in English and in Social Studies.
The questions are graded below, as I say, since
1904, and reviewed in Albany.

They now review just a 5

percent sample of all of the questions, but whether they come
from a nonpublic school

oj:

a public school makes no

difference; the same professional unit reviews these.

And

for the assay questions, elaborate rating guides are
provided, giving many sample answers, and indicating how
they should be handled.

And in fact, the head of the unit

responding to the questions, when they’re marking them,

a nonpublic or public school student.

They have not detected

any difference.
In any event, this certainly would not be a
prixnary effect.
Now, the question that's been raised here about
diverting some of the money to religious uses, because
perhaps there would be inaccurate 'records has been answered
in part by my saying that it's well known in the state
education department just how much time should be espent on
taking attendance, and they can multiply.
In the case of the tests, they have computer
printouts which indicate just at what schools which tests
have been given, to which they advert in making their
audit.

And they also have parameters by which they’re

which are a three-hour exam, they have been allowing about
four hours for the preparing and even the grading of the

If these parameters seem to you rather tight, I.
might mention that the state comptroller's office had had a
hand in approving them; and in fact, every application which
has been audited and approved for payment by the state
education department also must go to the state comptroller’s
office for a pre-audit before the payment is made.

29

The conclusion of our argument is that there
certainly is no breach here in the neutrality that the state
is to maintain.

It has historically required teh taking of

attendance of giving of Regents Examinations, and certain
other standardized tests.

And it obviously is in need of the

essential census data that it receives

every year.

All of this is very readily auditable, and we
believe that we have carefully framed a statute in response
to the injunctions of this Court .in the directions that it
gave involving the Mandated Services Act, which is known as
Levitt I, and consequently the decision below is correct,
QUESTION:

I take it the district court seems to

have believed, in reversing its original decision, that this
Court kind of relaxed the rules, or changed the criteria
somewhat, in Wolman, as against Meek v» Pitt.enger,
You haven't discussed that.

That point was

relied upon a good deal by—
MRSo SIEGEL:

I just passed over it, because it

seems to us that our position could and should have been
sustained under Meek.

The clarification of the Court's

position in Wolman has been helpful.

The Court, in Wolman,

has in so many words expressly sanctioned the giving of
standardized tests and the providing of scoring services.
QUESTION:
they?

They were not involved in Meek, were

MRSc SIEGEL:

What were involved were the giving

Right.

MRS0 SIEGEL:

And therefore, they were part of the

teaching process in the very real sense of the word.
And also, in Meek, there

were aux.Llliary services,

which involved putting remedial teachers, who were public
employees, right into the schools.

And it was felt that

because of the pervasive religious environment of those
schools that it would require a great deal of surveillance
to make sure that they weren't infected by the environment.
And it was impossible to disentangle this fromthe rest.
Now, this was all made clear in Wolman, and I
.don't find that that was really inconsistent with Meek,
myself.

And in our case, we just don't come near to

iibridging any of the adjudications that were made in either
of those.
QUESTION:

So you don't embrace

all of the

reasoning, or at least, all the language, of the district
court?

31
MRS„ SIEGEL;

It's a matter of the language.

We

think the reasoning is fine, but I don't—
QUESTION;

But you thought—you submit that it

should have reasoned that way the first time.
MRSo SIEGEL:

Yes, should have reasoned that way

the first time, and also, that to the extent that the issue
has been clarified by Wo liman, that's quite correct.

But it

does not seem to us that that was an inconsistent ruling;
did not really hold differently.
QUESTION:

I suppose every time we decide one of

these church-state cases, some group of people think it's a
retreat, and others think it's an advance.

it was a helpful clarification of a position of the Court.

AFTERNOON SESSION
(1:01 p.nu)
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Nolan.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD E. NOLAN, ESQ„,
ON BEHALF OF INTERVENING PARTIES-APPELLEES
MR. ROLAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I

argue here on behalf of the intervenor schools,

four of which are religiously affiliated.
I'd like to say one thing in the beginning, with
respect to the statement that Mr. Pfeffer made to the effect
that these schools discriminate in admissions against persons
not of their religious faiths.
The four religiously affiliated schools have each
executed answers to plaintiffs* interrogatories, answer ;J5,
denying that they imposed religious restrictions or preferences
on admissions.
I think that that is borne out at least as to the
Roman Catholic schools, by the fact that in Manhattan, in tha
elementary schools conducted by the Archdiocese of New York
in Manhattan, 16-1/2 percent of the children in those schools
are non-Catholic.
And there are various other statistics for other
areas.

But I think that at least the schools in New York

take great pride in the. fact that, far from discriminating

33

against non-Catholics inadmissions, they have consciously
kept open schools in inner city core

MR. NOLAN:

There is no evidence to support any

I take it a trier of fact would have been at liberty to

MR* NOLAN:
QUESTION:
MR. NOLAN:

That is right.
But it didn't go to trial?
It did not.

It went off in the context

almost of a summary judgment.
QUESTION:

But in this case at any time has tit been

why this money may not be given to these schools is that
they discriminate?
MRo NOLAN:

Not my understanding, Your Honor.
Has that claim ever been made in this

case?
MRo NOLAN:
QUESTION:

No, no? I do not believe so.
If it had, and the court didn't decide,

you would think the court had said:

Well, even if they

discriminate'—
MR0 NOLAN:

That point was never raised, to my

knowledge, either in the first or second phases of this
case.
QUESTION:

And if you went to trial--

35

MR„ NOLAN:
QUESTION:

If we went to trial—
—whose burden would it be to show

exclusion of-—
MRo NOLAN:

I

would think it would be the plaintiffs’

burden,, but I think we would put in statistical evidence
with respect to the number of non-Catholie children in the
various Catholic, Jewish, Lutheran and other schools that
are involved in the program under review.
Getting back to this program, and I don't want to
go over again what Mrs. Siegel has said, but I think it is
worthwhile talking a little bit about just what this program
is.
First of all, if involves attendance-keeping ar.d
reporting.

This is required by the State of New York.

This is not something the schools do on a voluntary basis,
or they very well might.

But it is required.to insure

compliance with the compulsory education law of New York.
The people who keep these records, or compile
these records—and this is based on the stipulation of fact
which is a part of the appendix—the people who compile
these records are typically secretaries in the main office
or the front office of the school.
They are not people who have anything to do with
the education or the instructional function.

They are simply

counting heads on a daily basis to be able to make the reports

36

that are required by the

State of New York.

And I fail to see any ideological content in that
type of activity.

I may say that, as the district court

found, that the great bulk—the lion’s share, I think they
said—of the money that is paid, 85, 90 percent, somewhere
through there, is for the maintenance of attendance records,
preparation of attendance reports.
QUESTION:
MR. NOLAN:

What percentage?
85-95 I think was the phrase used in

the district court opinion.

But it’s the great bulk, the

lion's share, as Judge Mansfield said.
QUESTION:

Are these records identical to those

required from the public schools?
MR. NOLAN:

As I understand it, they are, Your

Honor; they are the same forms that are used.

The parochial

schools are required'—-and it may also be that the public
schools are also required—to submit various reports based
on those records; and also to submit the so-called BEDS
report which goes in once a year, the Basic Educational Data
System report, which shows on a yearly basis people’s
faculty, courses given, and other information concerning the
schools.

And I think that is done both for the public

and the nonpublic schools.
QUESTION:

Mr. Nolan, why is Horace Mann-Barnard

School here at all, when the plaintiffs, through Mr. Pfaffer,

37
concede the validity of the application of the state law to
a school—to that school and schools like it?
MRc NOLAN:

Horace Mann-Barnard School was initially

joined because of the attack on the statute.
a

Horace Mann is

fairly large school with a stake in the financial side of

this.

'
QUESTION:

It is non—non-religious?

MRo NOLAN;

It is nondenominationa1.

And I think

that—
QUESTION:
MRo NOLAN:

Concededly so, isn’t it?
Ye3,

yes.

And I think that Mr. Pfoffer,

for the first time inthe proceedings, oh, before the

Court

on the second phase of this case, agreed that he really 1
sought no relief against Horace Mann.
But basically what I am here talking about—
QUESTION:
MR. NOLAN:

They’re just here as a historic vestige?
Historic vestige.

What I’m here

talking about are the religiously affiliated schools, which
to some degree conform, and to some degree do not conform,
according to the answers to interrogatories, with the
profile that has been used by this Court in the past.
But getting back to what this statute does, apart
from attendance, it provides for various testing-—standardized,
state-prepared tests, which are prepared by the Department
of Education for the State of New York to be made available

38
to public and nonpublic schools---made availcible to nonpublic
schools*

They’re the same tests that are made available and

used in the public schools.
These basically involve several types of tests*
The Regents Scholarship Examinations, which are given to
persons seeking New York State Regents Examinations, at the
end of high school.

These are prepared by and graded by

the personnel of the New York State DEducation Department*
The only thing that the schools do—the nonpublic
schools do--would be to receive the tests, under very secure
circumstances, sealed, kept under lock and key; distribute
those tests at the place of testing; pick them out; send
the tests back to Albany; and I suppose, keep order in the
classroom.
We also have the Pupil Evaluation Program, the PEP,
and that is a test that is given, I think in third, and
perhaps in sixth and ninth grades, to measure competence
in reading and mathematics, and it basically—and in fact
it's completely an objective, multiple choice type test.
It is given, again, to children in nonpublic and
public schools*

It is graded in the nonpublic schools either

by machine or by hand by the personnel of the school, but
basically what you're talking about is simply a teacher putting
an overlay—and I'm referring nox-7 to Exhibit No* 11 to the
stipulation of fact, which is one of the New York State tests

39

in reading for grade nine, simply put the overlay over and
see which places the child has marked properly.

There9s no

discretion at all involved in this.
Then you have the Regents Examination, which are
the end-cf-course examinations that are given in a number of
secular subjects in the public
schools.

schools and in the private

And these srethe ultimate measures, if you will, of

educational competence in secular subjects in New York.
QUESTION:
MRo NOLAN:

Is that an optional test?
I believe all students take it, but you

can only get a Regents degree if you have passed the Regents
examination.

But I believe it is required for all children.

But this is, again, to a very large extant, as fottr-d by the
district court, an objective, multiple choice examination
type of test, where there is no discretion in the grading
process.
There are a fevz, as found by the district court, a
very few, essay questions on various topics relevant to the
particular

examination.

Those are graded by the school

personnel.

But the state provides, along with the examinations,

the state provides rating guidelines, specific
guidelines, as to how these people are to do it.

rating
And in

addition, the schools are required to send both the passing
and failing papers to Albany, where they are checked bystate personnel on a random basis.

40

So again, there is minimal—minime.! opportunity
for any involvement»

There certainly—at that stage in the

game, these tests have nothing to do with the instructional
phase of education.
The only thing that I can think of would be the
possibility that some child might try to curry favor with a
teacher by using a religiously oriented answer.

But that is

indoctrination, if you will, coming back the other way.

It

is not indoctrination of the child.
I think that this statute is, in all respects,
constitutional under Wolman, as I think it is is modified by
Meek.

Even if it is not modified by Meek, I think it i.s

constitutional under Meek.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Nolan.

Mr. Pfeffer?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LEO PFEFFER, ESQo,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MRo PFEFFER:

One of -idle questions put

by Mr.

Justice Rehnquist is—deals with whether these schools—find
it was also asked by Mr. Nolan-—whether the schools which have
intervened in this case do discriminate in their admissions
policy in respect to religion.
Wa didn't sue these intervenors.

They voluntarily

intervened, and therefore, those who intervened, I would
assume were intervened because they reflected the best

41
possible picture.

And I think that's really the issue.

I

think that avoids the issue.
It’s a basic—
QUESTION:

They're the only litigants that we have

before the Court in that aspect of the case.
MRo PFEFFER:

Yes.

The—I must say that evidence

is irrelevant, for the reason which I will state in a moment.
QUESTION:

Why don't you state it right now?

MRo PFEFFER:

I'm stating it right now.

I mean right

now.
The constitutional issue in this case is not whether
these schools or other schools do or do not discriminate on
the basis of religion.

The constitutional issue in this

case is predicated on the fact that they have a right, a
constitutional right, to exclude on the basis of religion.
Whether or not—
QUESTION:

But wasn't hew you phrased your argument

on your original submission, during your direct.

You stated

it—-discrimination—as a fact.
MRo PFEFFER:

If I did that, I apologize.

My

argument is that they have a constitutionally protected
right, under Pierce v. Society of Sisters, and others, to
exclude on the basis of religion.
Whether they exercised that right or not, is notd
in the factual-—of this case.

They should not constitutionally

42
be allowed to receive taxes at all, irrespective of religion,
if they have a constitutional right to exclude.

This is the

foundation of our case.
QUESTION:

You say that whether these schools

exclude on the basis of religion or not, these payments are
unconstitutional?
MR0 PFEFFER:

Yes, because they have a right to

exclude; that's what I'm saying.

Because they have the right

to exclude on the basis of their religion, then I say you
cannot tax all people to pay for the maintenance of a school
which can exclude you if they want.
QUESTION:

So it isn't because these schools are

religiously connected that you—
MRo PFEFFER:

Oh, yes; it is because they're

religiously-—
QUESTION:

Well, what about a private school that

isn't controlled by any religion—
MRo PFEFFER:
QUESTION:
like Methodists,

There's no constitutional—•

--that just decided that it doesn't

And they--and here's a private school that

just excludes Methodists.
MR0 PFEFFER:

Well, Methodists is an exclusion on

the First Amendment was held applicable to the states.

It was

MR0 PFEFFER:

MR. PFEFFER:

There's no question about it.

Well, what about Horace Mann in this

Horace Mann has the constitutional right to exclude

on the basis of religion if it wants to.
MR, PFEFFER:

Well—
QUESTION:

Well, doesn't it?

MRo PFEFFER:
QUESTION:

Yes.

But if they do that—

Well, then, I don’t understand why you

MR0 PFEFFER:

Well, if Horace Mann receives money,

it has a constitutional right to exclude on the basis of

But it has no riconstitutional right to receive

QUESTION:

Well, you've changed your position.

44
MR. PFEFFER:

Which is all right.

You’ve changed your position completely.
That’s the way lawyers go.

MRo PFEFFER:
QUESTION:

No, I do not think—

Wall, I don't believe my position—

You've vacillated all over the lot.

MRo PFEFFER:

Oh, I don't think so.

what I said at the beginning.

I'll repeat it.

I'll repeat
It's been our

position all along that if you have a constitutional right
to exclude because of religion, you cannot constitutionally
use funds raised by compulsive taxation of all irrespective
of their religion.
This is the categorical imperative which I believe
the First Amendment stands upon.
Now—I suggest, too, that independent of that,
surveillance which is forbidden in respect to religion is;
necessary—state surveillance—is necessary to its—if public
funds are used for that school, whether it's record-keeping,
whether it's instruction, if you use public funds, then the

!

The very involvement, entanglement, of the state
to check whether—the law in this Court has dsaid so; I'm
not inventing this—to check- whether or not the law's complied
with, that very surveillance constitutes impermissible
entanglement, which forbids the use of public funds in that

case.
That's what this Court has said time and time again»
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
