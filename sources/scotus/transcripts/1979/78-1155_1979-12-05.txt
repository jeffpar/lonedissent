P 5- 9. £ E E D I N G S
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

We will hear arguments

first this morning in Vitek against Jones.
Mr. Rammerlohr, you may proceed whenever you're
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MELVIN KENT KAMMERLOHR, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. KAMMERLOHR:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
As the Court

is well

aware, this case was here

and extensively argued about a year and a half ago, at
which time it was returned back to a three-judge district
court on the question of mootness, because the—Mr. Jones
at that time had been paroled to a mental—VA mental hospital
in Illinois.
The three-judge court found that the case was not
moot because his parole could be violated—revoked at any
time, and he might be returned back to the penitentiary at
Nebraska, where he would be subjected to the same possibility
of being transferred to a state mental hospital.
QUESTION:

Then it's clear that at the time the

three-judge court acted, he was still in the VA hospital
in Illinois?
MR0 KAMMERLOHR?
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

How soon after—

MRo KAMMERLOHR:

Shortly after that, about three

months, I believe, he was found to have left—he violated
it some way.

But at any rate, the parole board violated

his parole and put out a warrant for his arrest.
.hud he was subsequently arrested in the State of
Arizona, and returned to -the penitentiary in Nebraska, where
he now is incarcerated in the regular part of the peni­
tentiary, as of this—as of Monday.
So they-—we

still have the same basic questions,

I believe, that we argued here before, and that's really
whether the statute

in Nebraska authorising transfer is

constitutional or not.
QUESTION:

Why is there a case in controversy

about that at this point?
MRo KAMMERLOHR:

Well, because the three-judge

court, Your Honor, enjoined the State of Nebraska.
QUESTION;

Oh, I understand that.

But why Weis

there jurisdiction—why is there any longer a live
controversy?
I know he's in prison, but just any prisoner in a
Nebraska prison wouldn't have

a case or controversy with

the state of Nebraska with respect to -the provisions to
transfer to a. mental institution.
Why would this man’

Because he’s been transferred

before, and is he about to be again, or what?

MRo KAMMERLOHR:

No, because the state has been

enjoined from transferring him to—
QUESTION:

Well,. I know, but if there's no case

or controversy left, if the case is mooted, what you would
do is, you would vacate the district court's judgment, and
dismiss it, dismiss the case,
I just want to know, is there still a—and it's a
jurisdictional matter.
QUESTION:

You wouldn’t object to that, would you

MR» KAMMERLOHR:
Your Honor,

No, I wouldn’t object to that,

If the case were mooted, and we were no

longer—
QUESTION:

Why is it a live case at this point?

Is Nebraska threatening to transfer him again or not’
MRo KAMMERLOHR:
one way or another,

I can’t say that, Your Honor,

I-—if he should—-as you know, he was

very violent before? he burned himself up.

And if he

should do something like that, the State of Nebraska would
transfer him immediately, I’m sure.
QUESTION:

But you say you can’t say—

MRo KAMMERLOHR:

But we don’t know from one day

to the next.
QUESTION:

When you say you can’t say, you don’t

mean it’s a state secret thcit you can’t reveal, but just
that you simply never know™”

6

MR. KAMMERLOHR:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

—until sonething happens whether it511

be dona or not.
MRo KAMMERLOHR:

Never know, and I am sura that

they are ready to transfer him, according to the statute,
is what they would like to do, at any time if he should
suddenly become violent.
QUESTION:

Just like any other inmate.

QUESTION:

Well, that’s true of any prisoner.

QUESTION:

Just like any other inmate.

MRo KAMMERLOHR:

Except that we aren't subject to

an injunction on any other prisoner except—
QUESTION:

I understand that; forget theinjunction

for a moment.
You think that—I' 11 ask you. this way.

Except

for the injunction, would. Nebraska now transfer him to the
mental institution, or not?
MRo KAMMERLOHR:
QUESTION:

It might.

Well, how do you know0
»

MRo KAMMERLOHR:

Well, it would depend on, I suppc.

on his conduct.
QUESTION:

On his conduct.

MRo KAMMERLOHR:
QUESTION:

On his conduct.

On his conduct.

Well, I suppose if he developed

tuberculosis, they might transfer him to an institution

7
where they could treat his tuberculosis.
MRo KAMMERLOHR:
QUESTION;

Yes, Your Honor.

But that's pure speculation, isn't it?

MR. RKAMMERLOHR:

And this gentleman did spend

five months in a civilian hospital in Lincoln because of his
burns before.

So, they do this everyday, they transfer

people to different hospitals for medical treatment.
QUESTION;

Well, all you want is to have the

injunction lifted?
MR» KAMMERLOHR:

We would like to have—-of course

we would like to have a rule.

But as far as my basic

legal interests, I would like to have the injunction ended,
yes.
QUESTION:

And if you can get a rule beyond that,

so much the better?
MRo KAMMERLOHR: Yes, Your Honor.
QUESTION;

Well, I suppose both parties, if there

weren't the case or controversy requirement of Article III
would like a ruling, since any district judge sitting in
Nebraska is going to see that the Eighth Circuit, when it
does have an actual case or controversy, will probably rule
the way the three-judge court did.
MR» KAMMERLOHR: That's correct, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

But that doesn't remove the Article III

requirement so far as we're concerned, nor so far as it is

0

concerned„
MRo KAMMERLOHR: We are—we only have three
district judges in Nebraska; two of them are on this
court»
QUESTION;

Well, why did the three-judge court

think this case wasn’t moot?

We remanded

to see if it was

moot.
MR0 KAMMERLOHR: They took the-—
QUESTION:

They just assumed that because he was

on parole and he had violated his parole, that the case
wasn’t moot; is that all they did0
MRo KAMMERLOHR: That'3 right, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Well, at the time he—

MR* KAMMERLOHR: Because the injunction ran for as
long as he was subject to our custody.
QUESTION:
to you at the outset.

Well, let me clarify the question I put
At the time the three-judge court

decision came down, was he still in the 'VA hospital in
Illinois, or had he violated his parole and left?
MRo KAMMERLOHR: He was still in the three-judge--or
excuse me, he was still in the Illinois hospital; yes, Your
Honor.
QUESTION:

But the situation has changed

significantly since then by reason of his escape and then
his apprehension?

9
MRo KAMMERLOHRs Yes, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

So he's back where he was before this

controversy ever arose,
MR0 KAMMERLOHR: Except that he’s not now in fche—
yes, he's back where he was before it ever arose.

If he

were in a—back transferred to the state mental hospital
we'd be exactly where we were when he brought the action.
I think the officials are naturally afraid to
do anything because of the injunction, and because of the
fact that two of the three judges are the same judges
they're going to have any time a case comes up.
So very briefly, then, I don't want to go over
all of the ground we've gone over before.

I appreciate the

Court's time.
And I only want to emphasize a couple of points.
And that is, that the transfer, according to statute, is not
just for treatment, but is for examination and study.

And

then treatment, if necessary.
The statute provides that when treatment-—when
treatment is no longer necessary, an inmate shall be
transferred back to the penitentiary.
So the first thing I want to emphasize is that
it's merely a question of sending- someone over ato a
private--o.r to a mental hospital, the same as civilians go
to for examination and study.

10

The second thing I would like to emphasize is
there there’s no issue in this case on the constitutional
quality of the conditions at -this hospital.
been raised in the pleadings.

This has never

The state has not presented

any evidence on whether or not the kind of treatment is
adequate or not.
And we think it would be a much better procedure
to attack this place, if they think it's bad,, on the
constitutional quality, rather than on the method of getting
over there.
And these are points which we went into quite
extensively before

,

and I don’t think there's any need to go

into them again, Your Honor.
So with that, I'll end.
QUESTION:

Thank you.

May I ask you a question, before you

sit down?
M.E«, KAMM3RL0HR;

Excuse me, Mr. Justice

Stevens.
QUESTION:
mootness?

I—when was the decision made on

Was this the opinion in October of 1978"

And

as I read the opinion—
MR® KAMMERLOHR:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

And as I read the opinion, he was

not in Danville, but he was then on parole, wasn't he?
And wasn't the theory of the three-judge

court, one of the

conditions of the parole was, he had to submit himself for
psychiatric examination upon request; is that correct?
MR, KAMMERLOHR:

He was on parole, but his parole

was a limited parole to Danville.

And at the time the

three-judge court—if you jibe the two times when the
parole violation was entered, I think that it was probably
about the time--the three-judge court didn’t know about it.
It was not before the three-judge court that he had violated,
it.
And we didn’t know about it—I didn't know about,
it until after the three-judge decision came out.
QUESTION:

That he’d violated his parole?

MR0 KAMMERLOHR:
QUESTION:

But he was on parole?

MRo KAMMERLOHR:
QUESTION:

He was on parole, yes.

He was on parole.

MRo KAMMERLOHR:
was concerned.

Yes, Your Honor.

And they—

As far as the three-judge court

I’m sure that's true.

QUESTION:

But they—

MRo KAMMERLOHR:

But they just thought that

because they’d entered this injunction, for as long as he
was under Nebraska's custody.
QUESTION:

No, they said Larry Jones is now on

parole, but he is subject, to and under the threat of
transfer to -the state mental hospital

for examination,

12
study and treatment.
Apparently—and that’s apparently their basis
for being-—saying it isn't moot.
QUESTION:

Plus the fact that the state asserted

the right to transfer him to a hospital on short notice,
didn't it?

It seeks to have that right?
MRo KAMMERLOHR:
QUESTION;

Yes, Your Honor.

Well, it

seeks-—of course it's

always sought to have that right, long

before the

injunctive proceedings.
MRo KAMMERLOHR;
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

If we vacate™just—if we vacate this

as moot, then I take it if you did try to transfer him, he
could--his lawyer could no doubt go into court and get a
temporary restraining order right away on the authority of
this opinion.
MRo KAMMERLOHR:

I'm sure he could; yes, Your

Honor.
He shouldn’t have any trouble at all.
QUESTION:

Which is true of any other prisoner?

MRa KAMMERLOHR:
QUESTION:

Unless you have a new—

MRo KAMMERLOHR:
QUESTION;

It would be now.

Unless we have some new rule.

Or a new district court judge.

MRo KAMMERLOHR:

We'll be fighting this thing

forever.
QUESTION:

Or unless you have a new district
»

court judge in Nebraska who interprets the constitution
differently than this three-judge court did.
MRa KAMMERLOHR:

That's right.

And we think

that basically this gets down to, has the legislature of
Nebraska, the legislative body, done its job by passing a
proper statute? not whether the administration is doing
anything or not doing anything.
MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Wurts.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS Ao WURTZ, ESQ«,,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES»
MR» WURTZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
The question here presented for review is
whether or not Larry Jones may be transferred from the
Nebraska penal and correctional complex, which is the
state penitentiary in Lincoln, Nebraska, to the Lincoln
Regional Center, which is -the state mental hospital, which
is also located in the State of Nebraska.
QUESTION:

Well, does that question arise until

they try to do it?
MR» WURTZ:
Your Honor.

Well, it arose—they did do it,

14
QUESTION;

He8e now in a penal institution, isn't

he, a prison?
MRo WURTZ:

He has been sent back to the penal

institution.
QUESTION;
MR. WURTZ:

Well, then, what's the question?
Gur contention is, Your Honor, this

is still a very viable and live controversy, for the reason
that he is still under the threat, as the district court
found below, of being transferred back.
QUESTION;

Would you say that he’s still under a

threat that if he develops tuberculosis he might be
transferred to a hospital for treatment of tuberculosis?
MRo WURTZ:

That might be true. Your Honor, but

that is not precisely the issue we face here today in
Court.
QUESTION;

How is this case-different from

Weinstein against Bradford?
MRe WURTZ:
QUESTION:

I'm not familiar with that case?
Well, that was the case where there

had been an injunction entered by, I think, the Court of
Appeals for the Fourth Circuit against certain prison
practices in connection with parole, and meanwhile, the
man's parole expired.

And we granted certiorari and then

dismissed on the ground that it was moot, because the man
was no longer under the same threat that he had been at the

time the case was decided.
MRe
parole.

WURTZ:

Well, for one, Larry Jones is not on

So therefore his parole had not expired.

He has

been sent back from the limited parole that he did have at
the mental hospital in Danville, Illinois, back to the
State of Nebraska.
QUESTION:

But he hasn't been transferred to the

mental hospital.
MRo WURTZ:

He would be transferred, it is our

contention, but for the fact that a three-judge federal
panel has entered an injunction.
QUESTION:
opponent says.

Well, but that's not what your

Your opponent says, it just depends on what

happens.
KR„ WURTZ:

Well, if this injunction, that we

have from the three-judge federal panel, were to be dissolved
by this Court, or by the three-judge federal panel, we have
no doubt that he would be transferred back, he could be
transferred back to the mental hospital.
QUESTION:
MRa WURTZ:

He could be, but would he?
Well, I can't see into the future,

Your Honor; I don't have a crystall ball.
QUESTION:
MR. WURTZ:

No, none of us can.
But it seems to be one of those

cases which seems to be capable of repetition, yet it would

16

be evading review if this Court would not decide that issue
here today,
QUESTION;

Well, what if as far as you could

tell or any doctor could tell, your client was completely
cured?

He; wouldn't be any different than any other inmare.

And just any inmate couldn't raise an issue about these
procedures.■
MR„ WURTZ:

Well, he isn't just any other

inmate.
QUESTION;

All right.

Nov/, tell me why—tell

me what substance there is—the fact that it happened to
him before.
MRe WURTZ;
QUESTION:

It's happened to him before.
And his condition hasn't, changed?
)

MRo WURTZ:

He sat over there-—that's right, he

sat over there for nine months.

He has had all of the

collateral consequences that will ensue from having to be
in the mental institution in the first place.
And he still has a threat of that hanging over
his head.

Now, I can't get into his mind and tell you

exactly how he feels or anything.

But it's just that type

of collateral consequence that is still existing.

And for

that reason, we feel that there's still a spirit of
controversy here.
QUESTION:

Well, you can't—-you won't cure the

17
collateral consequence that’s already happened in. this
case?
MRo WURTZ:

That’s true»

But the mere fact that

those consequences have already happened, and the fact that
they might happen again, and I think coupled with the fact
that that is still hanging over his head, makes it still a
very good and live controversy.
QUESTION:

But to have a live controversy, you

must say thatthe risk of his being transferred again is
real enough to call it a case or controversy.
MRe WURTZ:
Your Honor.

Yes, I would agree with that statement,

And I think those risks are real enough by the

mere fact that had this three-judge court not entered the
injunction, he would still be incarcerated in the state
mental hospital.
QUESTION:

Mr. Kammeriohr told us I think ecirlier

that he had escaped, was it from Illinois to Arkansas, and
has now been returned to prison in Nebraska.

Was either the

escape or return connected with any aberrant behavior'5
MRo WURTZ:

Well, as I understand the factual

situation--and I must say that it is somewhat murky, because
Mr. Jones was having some mental problems at the time, and
frankly, he cannot really remember some of the things that
%

happened.

One

day he was in Denver, and I received a call

from him.

And I said, well, you know, why aren’t you in

18

Danville, Illinois.
was in Arizona.

The next time I heard from him, he

And he had gotten to see someone in Denver

at a hospital, talked to a parole officer.

But then he

ended up—-next time 1 heard from him, he was in Arizona.
Then the next time 1 heard from him, he had been
extradited from Arizona, and he had been sent back to the
State of Nebraska.
QUESTION:

Maybe he's a sun worshipper.

(Laughter.)
MRo WURTZ:

Well, I don't know; he might be.

But maybe he left because he didn't like the mental hospital.
I don't know.
But one important point I think should be noted
here, the Court here, it was my understanding, determined
it was moot last time, because he was accepting psychiatric
services.
QUESTION:

We didn’t say it was moot.

MRo WURTZ:

Well, I—-excuse me, it was remanded

to consider mootness.

But it was my understanding from the

argument last time that one of the reasons that the Court
did that was because he was accepting voluntary psychiatric
treatment at the state hospital in Danville, but at the time
the three-judge panel entered the order reinstating the
injunction October- 27, 1978, Mr. Jones was no longer
accepting voluntary psychiatric treatment in Danville,

19

Illinois,

He was on a work—itBs actually a work-release

program from that limited parole.
So he was not receiving psychiatric treatment
voluntarily at the time the three-judge panel reinstated
that injunction.
So we—I thought that was one of the reasons that
the three-judge panel should have reinstated the injunction
because the circumstances had actually

changed from the

time that we were up here in Court arguing the case,
QUESTION;

Now, come back to my question, which

I'm not sure you addressed yet.
Suppose the prison doctors
had developed tuberculosis.

concluded that he

Is it your position

that they

\

must have adversary hearings before they can transfer him
to a hospital to treat the tuberculosis?
MR0 WURTZ;
Honor.

That would depend on two things, Your

First of all, if he wanted to be treated.

If he

did not wish to be treated, it would be—probably if I
was representing him, it would be our contention that he
could refuse the medical treatment.
I think—in the cases involving Christian
Scientists and other religious groups, I think we have keld
that one has that right to refuse medical treatment.
QUESTION:

Yes, but being a Christian Scientist

is not part of my hypothetical.

Just this man, unless

20

you tell us he's a Christian Scientist.
MRo WURTZ:

I would argue that he would have the

right to refuse that medical treatment.
QUESTION:

Well, my question is:

Must there be

a hearing before he is moved from the prison to the hos­
pital for the treatment of his tuberculosis7
MR.KWURTZ:

Well, the statute in Nebraska does

not specifically provide for that now at this time.
QUESTION:

Do you think the constitution does, the

Federal constitution7
MRo WURTZ:
really been addressed.

I don’t know that that issue has
I personally think, if he does not

really want to be operated on, or have his tuberculosis
treated, I think he ought to have that right.

And

perhaps, yes, a hearing ought to be mandated, or given to
him at that time.
QUESTION:

But your claim . .here is that the

Nebraska statutes themselves put some preconditions on a
transfer to a mental institution.
MRo WURTZ:

Well, there are conditions.

They

allow a physician to make that finding.
QUESTION:
MR, WURTZ:
QUESTION:

Well, I know, but they require it.
Yes, they require it.
And then there must be a finding that

he has a mental disease or defect before he may be

21

transferred to the hospital; isn't that right?
MR„ WURTZ:

That’s correct»

But it's also our

contention that there ought to be some type of independent
fact-finding.
QUESTION;
that.

Well,, I understand that; I understand

But you may not be the—the prison authorities just

may not transfer him to the mental hospital without making
this kind of a determination.
MR. WURTZ:

We would hope that they would make some

type of a determination.
QUESTION;

Well, the statute requires it.

statute requires it.

The

And you’re suggesting—I thought your

argument was—
MRo WURTZ;

Well, we need a further safeguard, that’s

what we're saying,
QUESTION;

—that because the statute requires it,

there should be a hearing about it.
MRo WURTZ;

Well, what I meant was that the

statute requires it, that therefore we have a hearing.

But

what I’m saying is, you don't have a hearing but they can be
transferred.
What we are saying, we’re challenging the sufficiency
of that statute.

We’re saying, yes, there is a safeguard

there, but that safeguard isn’t good enough.
QUESTION;

You’re saying--

22

MRo WURTZ:
QUEST100:

There ought to be a better hearing.
You're saying, in effect, that the state
«

provision gives you a state right to have some sort of a
hearing before you're transferred, and that because the state
gives you that much of a right, the constitution requires
you—the state to go further and to have more amplified
hearing proceedings?
MRo WURTZ:

No.

I'm of the popinion, Your Honor,

and we contend, that you have that right in and of itself.
Under the constitution.
But I also think it's also a good argument that if
you would want to categorize this type of case in. the
framework of the Heachum and Montanya decisions, that there
be, there is an expectation that he won't be transferred.
QUESTION:

Well, that was the district court's basis,

wasn't it?
QUESTION:. That’s certainly—
MR. WURTZ:
QUESTION:
MRo WURTZ:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
—the narrowest way for you to win.

And—

I agree.
—-I don't know why you want to climb a

higher hill than you have to.
MR. WURTZ:

I guess I'm on that hill, Your Honor,

because it may appear from reading that opinion that that is
why the district court found in our favors that they said that

23
there was an expectation that he did have this„

He could find

from looking at the statute that there is an expectation
there, and he should be transferred»
*

I think—
QUESTION:
MR, WURTZ:

Or something created by state law?
Yes, Your Honor»

I don't--! think he has the right, though,
independent of the expectation given to him by state law.
The Court also made a finding, though, and it was interesting
though, it said in the opinion that this was clearly a
transfer from a state penal complex to a state mental hospital.
And therefore it is distinguished and different from the
Meachum-type, Montanye-type cases.
I would agree—-1 don't think we need to go on that
narrow a basis.

But should this Court feel that this case
*

would somehow fit within that framework of the Meachum and
Montanye decisions, I think there is an expectation there,
rooted in Nebraska state law.
QUESTION:

You say that even though the state of

Nebraska required no finding by a physician, and simply
left it in the discretion of prison officials to transfer
an inmate to a mental hospital, that he would have a
constitutional right to a hearing before that could be done?
MRo WURTZ:

Yes, Your Honor.

In fact, there is a

statute, I believe it's 33-176, which empowers the Department

24
of Corrections to place any inmate wherever he wants to put
him.

And—
QUESTION :

But it does—the statutory scheme also

requires the physician's review in the case of a transfer to
a mental hospital, does it not0
MR0 WURTZ:

Yes, Your Honor.

In 83-180, subsection 1,

which the lower court found unconstitutional.
But w7e contend that even if 83-180 didn't exist,
and all there was was 83-176, which gave the Department of
Corrections officer the ability to just transfer him anywhere
he wanted to, as long as it was within the Department of
Corrections,that he has that—that fundamental right;

it's

protected—it’s a protected liberty interest that the
constitution should afford him.
QUESTION:

Even though he's already been sentenced

for a criminal conviction?
MRo WURTZ:
with it.

Well, that doesn’t have anything to do

Why should his rights be any different just because

he happens to be in a prison?
QUESTION:

Well, we've held, certain in Meachum v.

Fano, that the transfer from one prison to another doesn't
give rise to any constitutional right.
MR» WURTZ:

Yes, that's correct.

And I think that

is the precise difference between Meachum and this case.
This is not a transfer from one'prison to another.

It's a

25
transfer from one prison to a mental hospital»

Before it was

called the Lincoln Regional Center it was called the Nebraska
State Home and the Nebraska Hospital for the Insane.

This

isn't a Meachum-type case, in that sense.
QUESTION;

Mr. Wurtz, will you identify the

injunction that is still in effect?

Is it the one that's on

page 19 of the Appendix?
I guess it's the jurisdictional statement; I beg
your pardon.

It may be in the Appendix, but I'm looking at the

jurisdictional statement.
MRo WURTZ:

Ended October 27, 1978.

Yes, Your Honor,

it's my understanding

that the injunction is still left.
QUESTION;

If that’s still in effect, your client

can’t be transferred without the hearing that’s described in
that injunction, can he?
MR0 WURTZ;
QUESTION;

That

is correct, Your Honor.

Well, why are you complaining?

Aren't

you satisfied with that?
MRo SWURTZ;

Yes.

QUESTION:

You’re defending that injunction?

QUESTION;

You're not complaining.

You're the

respondent, or the appellee.
MR0 WURTZ:
QUESTION:
case is not moot.

Right.

I didn't appeal, Your Honor.

But I thought you were arguing that the
I should think you'd be happy to have us

26

say it is moot,.
MR» WURTZ:

Well, no, because—

QUESTION:

You'd have the injunction, wouldn't you?

MRo WURTZ:

—because it8s my understanding of the

mootness rule here in the Supreme Court, that if a Supreme
Court found a case moot, it would be—vacated the lower
injunction»
QUESTION:

I guess you're right»

I guess you are

right on that»
MR0 WURTZ:

I guess that’s what I was afraid of last

time»
QUESTION:
MR0 WURTZ:

Right»
We're happy that the injunction was

reinstated»
QUESTION:

2\nd you don't want to have to go back in

court if they move him over to Lincoln, Nebraska again.

If

they move him from where he is to Lincoln, Nebraska, you don't
want the burden of going in to get another injunction?
QUESTION:
MR» WURTZ:

Or if they start to move him?
Well, that is correct.

do it again if xve would have to.

We would gladly

But it would seem to me that

it's one of those cases that would just keep evading review.
QUESTION:

Do you think there's no state remedy in

this area7
MR» WURTZ:

That is correct, Your Honor.

That is why

27

we brought it in Federal court.
QUESTION:

I don't see—

Well, why do you think there's no state

court remedy?
MRo WURTZ:

Well, because habeas corpus, which we

thought would be one of our only remedies, which we talked about
last time, did not appear to lie in this type of case.

Because

he was-—habeas corpus would only help us if he was put somewhere
illegally.

And if we would see him sitting in the Regional

Center, and we bring the habeas corpus and we have the writ,
it "would be dissolved.
QUESTION:

Well, don't Nebraska, t.h.e Nebraska

state courts, entertain a challenge on the Federal constitu­
tional grounds0
MRo WURTZ:

Yes, Your Honor.

Oh—if the question is,

could we have, raised this in state court as opposed to
bringing it in a three-judge federal court, correct.
QUESTION:

This is a state statute which, I take it

from these papers, that it's never been construed by the
state courts.
MRo WURTZ:
QUESTION:

Yes, that's correct, Your Honor.
They might construe it just the way you

want it construed; isn’t that so?
MRo WURTZ:

That is a possibility, Your Hcno.r.

don’t know why—I think we brought it in the three-judge
federal panel.

I think we saw that this was a case that

I

28
probably was going to probably be appealed.

And it would

have taken-—probably five years already going through the
federal court system, and it probably would have taken seven
through the state court system.
QUESTION:

Maybe you could have got it rthrough the

state courts in 18 months.

MRo WURTZ:

Well, it would—I don’t know if we could

have or we couldn’t have, your Honor.

But it would have been

my opinion that we couldn’t have.
QUESTION:

You mean that the state courts would not

enforce the federal constitution, or consider your constitution
al attack?
MS, WURTZ:

No, I didn’t say that, Your Honor.

I

just said we made a calculated decision, and it was five
years ago; I really can't remember why; to bring it before
the three-judge federal panel, who—and I—the three-judge
federal panel had jurisdiction to hear this type of case.
I don9 t think there9s any contention there„
QUESTION;

Mr. Wurtz, I realize—Jones was convicted

of robbery, I believe, wasn't it?
MR, WURTZ:
QUESTION:

A felony?

Yes, Your Honor.
The statute applies to people in custody

of the Department of Corrections.

Who does that encompass?

Does that encompass people convicted of misdemeanors, by any
chance ?

29
MRo WURTZ:

That would depend on where they're

placed.
QUESTION:

But would a conviction of a misdemeanor

entitle the judge to sentence the misdemeanant to the custody
of the Department of Corrections?
MRo WURTZ:
QUESTION:

Yes, Yes, Your Honor,, I believe it would
So this statutory scheme would authorise

transfer of such a person as well as a felon to a mental
institution'’
MR0 WURTZ:

That's correct, Your

Honor»

And in

the state of Nebraska, as you get further out west, there are
a lot of counties who, for whatever reason, may not have
adequate facilities to take care of certain types of
prisoners»

Many times, they’ll contract, they’ll enter into

contract with the state to house actual prisoners that might
be in a county jail at the Nebraska penal correctional complex
So then they are clearly, in a situation like that, under the
direction of the Department of Corrections, and could be so
transferred under the statute.
QUESTION:

Would you refresh my recollection?

As I

understand, the case was originally certified as a class
action, then decertified, and now it’s simply an individual
action by Jones, is that it?

Why was it decertified'’

What

happened on the class action?
MRo WURTZ:

I wish I knew.

And I really

don’t.

30

And there is nothing in any opinion or order of the Court
which really gives us any clue.
Initially, we brought this case just up on—’before
*

the three-judge federal panel without a record.

We were

trying to argue the merits, and we wanted a temporary
injunction.
%

We had an oral hearing.

The cour tinquired of me

as to how many actual people were involved in this type of
transfer, and I said that to the best of my recollection there
were probably five or six people that probably were, under a
threat of being transferred from the penal complex to the
Regional Center.
Now, the court had previously entered the order
making it a class action.

I—from what I can surmise, I think

based on what I told them, they determined-—
QUESTION:
MR. WURTZ:
QUESTION:

Not enough people.
—there wasn’t, enough people.
Five or six people is not enough for a

class action in anybody's book.
MR. WURTZ:

It tvould ail depend, though, Your

Honor—
QUESTION:

Ten is not enough.

number that you can't put your hand on.

The number is a
If you can name all

of them, you don't have a class action.
MRo WURTZ:

Of course, it depends on how you define

31
the class.

Now, when I originally got the three-judge panel

to call it a class action, I tried to define the class as all
those people that were confined in the penal complex in the
Nebraska State Reformatory, which was about 1,300 people, under
the theory that these people are all under a threat of being
transferred.

And maybe when the three judges got together,

they just didn’t like ray definition of the class.
QUESTION:

And they—

Well, not only that, but that—you must

concede that all 1,300 of them didn’t have a case or
controversy with the state over the validity of that statute.
Not just anybody could have walked in and challenged that.
MR0 WURTZs

Well, I understand the reasons—

QUESTION:

You must concede that.

MRo WURTZ:

Well, no, I’m not—

QUESTION:
MR. WURTZ:

You don’t concede anything.
—going to concede anything, because I

always get into trouble when I concede

things, I found out,

particularly in this Court.
(Laughter.5
But it could be argued that 1,300 people are under
the threat as

.Jones is of now being transferred just by the

mere existence of the statute.
QUESTION:

It could be because you're arguing it.

QUESTION:

And you could also argue that the two

million people who live in Nebraska are under a somewhat more

32
attenuated threat of committing a crime, being convicted for
it, being confided to the prison system, and then suffering
this fate,
QUESTION:

Well, and the other 228 million people

in the United States who might go to Nebraska,
QUESTION:

Who might move to Nebraska,

{Laughter„)
MRo WURTZ:

Well, maybe.

Well, that would certainly

be a tenuous type of class,
QUESTION:

You won’t even concede that, will you?

(Laughter.)
MR0 WURTZ:

I’ll never concede anything here again.

(Laughter.)
QUESTION:

Mr. Hurts, my recollection is that your

client has a sentence that runs into the eighties, what is
*

it, '82, or--?
MRo WURTZ:

Yes, his parole is set for 1982.

And

it does not appear at this time that he is going to be paroled
in the very near future,
I just wanted to mention a few things about the
stigma that really attaches to those who are transferred from
a penal complex or a prison to a state hospital as happened in
our case.
Even if a prisoner would be released, and let’s say
he was sent over for evaluation and treatment under the

33

statute, the collateral consequences of what happens to him
really stay with him for a long time.

And that’s really

one of—
QUESTION:

Are they worse than his efforts to set

himself on fire?
MR. WURTZs

Your Honor, I really don’t concede

either—and I'm not trying to be smart about that-—but I
don't concede it, because I don't think it’s on the record,
and I don't think the state really made a prima facie case
that he did set hirnself on fire and tried to commit suicide.
QUESTION:

But in Nebraska, in Weinstein against

Bradford, the man had already suffered what the Court of
Appeals for the Fourth Circuit felt was unconstitutional
harm.

And we nonetheless vacated as moot, with the thought

I believe expressed by my colleague Justice White that you
can’t undo collateral consequences in the past.
MR„ WURTZ:

Well, I think there's a grave difference

though—there may be a fine difference—between the types of
collateral consequences.

And it really gets into this stigma-

or call it whatever you want—and I think it's been recognized
by the courts that it's there--that there's a difference
between a stigma when you go to a mental institution.

It’s

»

different.
QUESTION:

Well, isn't™

QUESTION:

Mr. Wurfcz, I'd like to follow through

34

on that a little bit»

It's your position that going to a

hospital,, be it a state hospital—-we used to call them
institutions for the criminally insane, but they don t anymore—
’■

is worse than being incarcerated in some state prisons that
we know of today?
Isn't this an old notion that is out of line with
current medical attitudes?
MRo WURTZ:

It would seem to me, Your Honor, that the

gist of psychiatric medicine right now is trying to come along
to those lines»

But I'm not so sure that that—that, we've

really come that far today»
QUESTION:

Well, obviously,, from your argument,

I'm afraid you haven't»
MR0 WURTZ:

Well, I don't—-I haven't come that far,

I suppose in some cities in the United States it may be even
chic to have a psychiatrist, or to be having—-to having
psychiatric problems„

It's kind of a thing to do in some

cities.
I guess in Nebraska, which is basically a rural—QUESTION:

I'm just disturbed about your constant

reference to stigma, because I think stigma in 1979 is far less
-than it was in 1900.
QUESTION:

I also think it might help to try to win

your case for your client on the narrowest possible grounds,
which we usually turn to if -they're the narrowest grounds.

35

The narrowest constitutional grounds there is*
.And you're arguing that the constitution itself
requires a hearing, even aside from the state statute is a
very broad ground that this Court hasn't gotten close to.
MRo WURTZ:

Well, I think if this Court would feel

that it hasn’t gotten close to that ground, it perhaps ought
to.

I think the case—
QUESTION:

I’m just suggesting to you that a

narrower—a much narrower ground that you argue in your
brief.

The three-judge court decided on that basis?
MR0 WURTZ:
QUESTION:

The expectation—Are you defending the three-judge court

opinion or aren't you?
MRo WURTZ:
QUESTION:
MR0 WURTZ:

Yes, I’m defending that opinion.
Well, why don’t you stick to if5
Well, because, had I written the opinion,

I felt the court didn’t have to go on that narrow of a ground.
I think that right, that liberty interest, is so fundamental-QUESTION:

What do you mean, they didn51 have to?

The—I suppose the notion in judging constitutional cases is
that you do decide as narrow a constitutional question as you
can.

That's the characteristic way.

Or don't you teach that

way?
MRo WURTZ:
QUESTION:

Well, I don't teach constitutional lav;.
Well, apparently you don't.

36

QUESTION:

You5re argument is that it’s not chic to

have a psychiatrist in Scott’s Bluff?
MR. WURTZ:

No, that's not my argument, Your Honor.

My argument is that I don’t think—I think if we have to go
on as narrow a ground, you have to concede that this is a
Meachum-type case.
case.

And I don't think it’s a Meachum-type

I think clearly it does not fit within that analytical

framework at all; the reason being that they talk about
transfers from prison to prison, this was clearly a transfer
from a prison to a mental hospital.
QUESTION:

But the fact is you've got a state statute

that puts conditions—that imposes preconditions that depends
on the ascertainment—-that depends on facts.

And the state

statute says there must be some events occur before this
transfer can happen.
MR. WURTZ:
QUESTION:

That is not Meachum.
No, that’s the statute.
And that is the basis on which the

three-judge court proceeded, is it not?
MR0 WURTZ:

Yes,

'it is, Your Honor.

And if I were

to argue in support of -that base, I would say that that
statute gives the prisoner an expectation rooted in state
law.
QUESTION:
MRo WURTZ:

But you don’t want to make that argument?
No, I was going to get to it.

But I think the fundamental--the argument is so

37
it's so fundamental.

I think he ought to have the right one

way or the other.,
I think also you get an expectation rooted in state
law by looking to Nebraska civil commitment statute itself,
even those these are in the civil context.

I think it’s

clear that Nebraska does have commitment procedure, and one
normally would not have the expectation that he would end up
in a mental institution without a hearing, whether ' or not he'd
be walking down the street or in a prison.
Getting back to the question, Mr. Justice Rehnquist,
what was the question about chic in Scott's Bluff?

I—it's

two questions.
QUESTION;

Well, all I meant to say was that you

were arguing that must because it may be thought chic in some
perhaps metropolitan areas for a person to have a psychiatrist,
it was not viewed that way in most of Nebraska.
MR0 WURTZ:

Right.

In answer to Justice Blackmun’s

question, I really feel that because Nebraska is such a rural
state—-my wife is from a small town in southeastern Nebraska.
And I know that if someone went into this town of 6,000,
.<

everyone knows exactly what they're doing.
And it's really the type of stigma that stays with
you in a small town.
QUESTION;

Does the

constitution vary—federal

constitutional right—vary from state to state?

If in New

38

York City it’s thought chic to have a psychiatrist, so there’s
no stigma, but in southeastern Nebraska, it's not thought chic,
so there is a constitutional right?
MRa WURTZ:

Clearly not, Your Honor.

That fundamental

right, or the right that is given to you because there's an
expectation given to you by state law, would exist one way
or the other.
I think what I’m saying is that the stigma, when you
go into a small town, might be more felt in a small town than
it would be in New York City.

Because in a town of 5,000

people, everyone knows you. came from the Nebraska State
Hospital.

And it would affect your job possibilities.
QUESTION:

If lawyers keep coming up to this Court

saying it's a stigma, they probably will help to keep it a
stigma, too.
QUESTION;

It’s more of a stigma than being in a

state penitentiary?
MRo WURTZ:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
In a small town9

MRo WURTZ:

No, I can't answer that.

I think in Mr.

Jones case, the plaintiff here, ha felt that it had—he didn't
want to be there.
him.

It was probably much more aof a stigma to

And it could be to some prisoners.

that might not be a stigma to everyone.

I'm not saying that
In fact, some

prisoners may in fact want to be at a state mental hospital

39
as opposed to the penal complex for certain reasons , for
security or for whatever.
I would also just, like to say—talk a moment about
the right to counsel which this—-the three-judge court found
should exist, if in fact the prisoner is given some type of
hearing.
It would appear to me that if we do find, and I
think we should find, that the prisoner does have a fundamental
right to a hearing before he’s transferred to the mental
hospital, if he can't afford a lawyer, he really ought to have
a lawyer appointed for him.
It’s analogous to the parens patria theory that,
as in the juvenile proceedings, that if the state is going to
take this person under their wing and take care of him now
because they have taken away some of his liberties, they
really ought to take care of him and insure that throughout
all of the proceedings that he is afforded counsel.
Because as the lower court found, unless the prisoner
really has—or knows his rights, what good are the rights?
They're illusory.
