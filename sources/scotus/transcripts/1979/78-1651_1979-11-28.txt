MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No. 78-1651, Seatrain Shipbuilding Corporation against
Shell Oil Company.
Mr. McDaniels, you may proceed whenever you are
ready.

*
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM E. McDANIELS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. McDANIELS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case comes before the Court on writ of
certioreri of the United States Court of Appeals from the
District of Columbia Circuit.

The petitioners, Polk and

Seatrain, were signatories to a contract entered into in June
of 1972 with the secretary of commerce whereby $27.2 million
in subsidy was provided towards the construction of the super­
tanker STUYVESANT.

The issue that this case presents

involves whether the secretary of commerce has the power
under the Merchant Marine Act, 1936 to amend that contract to
delete therefrom certain terms restricting the domestic trade
by the STUYVESANT in exchange for a repayment of the subsidy
award.

The district court held that power existed.
Q

Does it not also present a jurisdictional

issue of how the case ever got from the district court to the
court of appeals?

4
MR. McDANIELS:

Yes, Your Honor, it does.

The

district court had-Q

Are you very enthusiastic about that issue?

MR. McDANIELS:

Your Honor, Mr„ Lev&nder has briefed

that issue and would be arguing it.

We support his brief.

We have not addressed it in our particular briefs.
Q

You certainly did not touch upon it in your

initial brief.
MR. McDANIELS:

We did not, Your Honor.

The time

of argument has been divided and, with the permission of the
Court, I would address the merits, and Mr. Lavender would
address the issue of appealability.
General's position in that regard.

We support the Solicitor
What happened was there

was a remand of the particular exercise of this authority in
the case of the STUYVESANT for further consideration by the
secretary.

And prior to the decision on remand, the plain­

tiffs here, Shell and Alaska Bulk, took appeal of the issue
of authority to the court of appeals.

And the court of

Appeals in a split decision decided that the secretary did
not enjoy the authority tinder the act.
The Stuyvesant, Your Honor, may it please the Court,
had the benefit of and the participation by the Secretary of
commerce directly and indirectly in its construction
financing.

The secretary had loaned outright under the

Economic Development Administration Act $5 million and

5
guaranteed 30 percent of eighty million other dollars in
loans which were used to refurbish the shipyard, Brooklyn
Navy Yard., where the vessels were built.

This was part of a

program to both establish a shipyard for use in national
purposes and also to employ -the hardcore unemployed in that
area, provide them job training.
Q

Mr. McDaniels, let me ask, is the Solicitor

General going to confine his argument to the jurisdictional
issue?
MR. MeDANXELS:

No, I believe he will address the

merits as well, Your Honor.
Q

Because it is hard for us to get to the merits

if we do not have jurisdiction.
MR. McDANXELSs

I certainly would, if you had some

questions of Mr. Levande:: on the

question of appealability,

sit down and have him argue now and argue later on the merits.
Q

Is it not a rather odd distribution of time

to first argue the merits when there is a question of juris­
diction?
MR. MeDANXELS:

I agree, Your Honor, but it was

suggested that as petitioner I was required to go first? and
Mr. Levander and I had discussed it.

I would prefer if he

goes first, but it is up t© the Court.

He is certainly

prepared to address that issue within the time that he has.
■MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

It is your case.

We

6
will allow you to make the decision.

But? as my colleagues

have suggested, it is putting the cart before the horse a
little.
MR. McDANIELS%
Q

I agree.

Who suggested you had to go first?

MR. MCDANIELS:
Q

It was suggested that as petitioner-

Who suggested it?

MR. McDANIELS;

The discussions with the Solicitor

General's office suggested that it was appropriate that I go
first as the petitioner.

I would be happy to have

Mr. Levander take the podium at this time.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Levander.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J„ LEVANDER, ESQ.,
PRO EAC VICE, FEDERAL RESPONDENTS SUPPORTING PETITIONERS
MR. LEVANDER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Although I am tils© prepared to discuss the merits
of tills case, I will address myself primarily to the jurisdiction represented here.

Plaintiffs'- complaint asserted

that the STUYVESANT transaction, which is at issue here, was
unlawful for essentially three reasons.

First, is that the

\

secretary lacked power to enter into such a transaction.

The

second is that, given the circumstances of this case, the
secretary had abused her discretion by entering into the
transaction

for failing to consider the economic impact on.

7
the existing domestic traders in the Alaskan trade.
Third, they challenged the nature of the proceedings
before the secretary under the Administrative Procedure Act»
On November 22, 1977 the district court concluded that the
secretary had power to enter into a STUYVESANT type of
transaction»

He concluded, however, that the secretary had

abused her discretion by failing to consider the economic
impact issue.

The district Court therefore granted partial

summary judgment to both sides and remanded the case to the
secretary for determination within 45 days of the economic
impact issue.
Q

Was the jurisdictional argument made in the

Court of appeals?
MR. LEVANDERs

It was first mentioned to the

district court by Mr. McDaniels at the time of the entry of
order.

And in the court of .appeals, in the petition for

rehearing, a footnote addressed this issue.
Q

Any federal court has to take note of it on

its own motion, does it not?
MR. LEVANDERs

That is made quite clear by this

Court's decision in Wetael, Your Honor.
The court also concluded on November 22nd---the
district court—that the third issue, the procedural claim,
would require a trial, and therefor® did not grant summary
judgment either way on that issue.

On November 30th

8
plaintiffs—the respondents here whom 1 will refer to as
plaintiffs since we are also technically

respondents—went

before the court and asked them to modify the judgment»
Firsts they voluntarily dismissed their procedural claim.
Second, they first asked the court t© enter a certification
under 28 USC 1292(b).

That provision, in ©ur view, is the

only provision which would have allowed an interlocutory
appeal ©n the statutory power question®

The district court,

however, .intimated that it did not think that was appropriate
or

it did not think it was necessary, and it agreed to

accept the plaintiffs9 second suggestion, which was that it
enter a certification under Rule 54(b) to allow an immediate
appeal of the statutory question.

At that point the plain­

tiffs appealed although the secretary had naver had a chance
to render its decision on remand at that point and although
the district court has never had a chance to address the
remand decision which came down while the appeal was pending.
We submit that that appeal was prematura and that the court
of

appeals lacked power to hear this casa»
The primary submission of plaintiffs as t© why

jurisdiction existed in the court of .appeals is that the
November 30th order constituted a valid Rule 54 (b) certifica­
tion.

That is the

question of the secretary’s power.

Rule

54(b) permits the district court t© enter a final judgment
as to any separate claim for relief even though the litigation

9

as a whole is not terminated.

For example, in this case

suppose that plaintiffs had sued the secretary regarding the
STUYVESANT transaction and in addition had sued the secretary
for a subsidy that they claim was due them on some other
unrelated transaction.

If the district court during the

course of that litigation had concluded that the secretary
did not owe

them the subsidy and finally determined that

separate claim but then there were further -proceedings t© be
had on the STUYVESANT claim, then the district court, in our
view, would have had power to enter a Rule 54(b) certifica­
tion because then a sepasrate claim would have been finally
determined, and that is what Rule 54(b) exists to do.

That;»

however, in our view, is not what happened here.
Before I turn, to that, I would like t© say at the
outset that the standard of review of th© 54(b) question
depends on what is being challenged.

If the question

invoIves whether ©r not the district court should have
exercised its discretion as to a clearly separate claim,
then this Court.6 s decision in Sears Roebuck against Mackey
and other decisions made clear that there is an abuse-ofdiscretion standard.

However, the Court8® subsequent

decision in Liberty Mutual Insurance Company against Wetzel
makes clear that where the question is simply whether or not
there are separate claims that can be certified under Rule
54(b) that is purely a legal question and there is no

10
deference due.
In our view, what happened here is that the plain­
tiff had two interrelated legal theories supporting a legal
righta

And such interrelated legal theories do not conati»

tute separate claims within the purview of Rule 54(b)»
Q

D© you think claims for relief as used in

Rule 54{b} is synonymous with causes of action?
MR. XaEVANDERs

I think it is a very similar concept

if not identical* Your Honor.
Q

How is it different?

MR. LHVhNDERs

This Court in Mackey and in Wetgel

never precisely said what a claim for relief was,
Q

You are arguing this ease.

What do you

submit?
MR. LEVANDER;

1 submit that the Court indicated

in We tael -Mackey that a separate claim is; an independent cause
of action separately enforceable on a mutually exclusive basis.
And by that X mean if the awarding of relief on one of the
alleged claims precludes or obviates the need for relief on
the ofchcir alleged claim; then in fast you do not have
separate claims,, and^ou just have interrelated theories.
In Mackey—
Q

It says claims for relief.

1 understood your

answer to be yes*, it is tantamount to a claim for relief
means for cause of action.

11
MR, LEVANDER:

Right,

And in Wetsel the fact

that there were different—there was a damage claim and an
injunctive claim and a declatory relief claim all rising out
of one single legal rights the Court said that is not separate
claim for the purposes of Rule 54(b).

Similarly here and in

Mackey where they did hold that 54(b) was properly used the
plaintiff in that case could have recovered on its anti­
trust claims and its common law tort claims and business
claims and unfair competition claims regardless of what
happened as to the antitrust claim,
were separate claims.

And so therefore there

The rights are separate and the

recoveries are separate, and one does not preclude or obviata
the need for the other.
Here, however, if the district court had granted
conclusively either one of plaintiffs' legal theories, there
would have been no need to address the other legal theory,
and also if the secretary^Q

Mr, Levander, is that true as to the Alaska

Bulk claim.?
MR, LEVANDER:

That is my next point.

Their major

submission, as I see it, is that they have two separate
claims.

The first claim is that they are complaining about the

STUYVESANT itself and its operation.

And the second claim is

that they have a right to know about the broader picture,
the statutory question.

And their theory is that even if the

12
secretary on remand had concluded that the economic impact
was sufficiently adverse as to not go forward with the
STUYVESANT transaction# that they nonetheless could have
appealed the district court's determination of the statutory
power question with the court of appeals.

In our view that

ignores the controversy requirement of Article III.

Certainly

if the secretary had never authorised the STUYVESAMT to
operate in the first place# you would have had an unripe
claim.

They could not have entered court and asked for a

declaration as to the secretary's power when there was no
impending use of that power and there was no decision to use
it.

Similarly, if the secretary decided to withdraw from

the STUYVESANT transacticsn and not go forth
you would have a situation which was moot.

with it# then
There would be

no more case or controversy# and they could not go forth and
litigate the issue in the court of appeals as to the claim
of the statutory power.
Q

She in fact decided to the contrary.

1 mean#

the court in fact decided to the contrary.
MR. LEVANDER:

Yes# but I do not think you can

judge-first of all# I do not think you can judge—
Q

Do you not have to judge appealability at the

time the appeal is attempted t© be prosecuted?
MR. LEVANDER:
Q

That is right.

And at that time-”

At that time both claims were still being made f

13
and neither of them could be said there was no case or contra
versy*
MR» LEVANDER;

The two legal theories.

One of them

had been conclusively determined by the district court,, but
the other one had not.

And the purpose of Rule 54(b) is to

not increase interlocutory appeals of interrelated litigation
it is to alleviate-Q

But your Riootness arguments—I am just

addressing your moot ness now.

At the time of the remand for

the competitive inquiry neither theory could, be disposed of
on the ground that it was moot.
MR. LEVANDER:

That is correct.

But what I am

suggesting is that the test to determine whether we have
truly separate claims or, as the courts of appeal

have

realized in other circumstances,? interrelated legal theories
is whether or not the granting of one of the theories would
obviate the need to get relief on the other theory because
the relief would be the senna or would end the case, then in
our view there is no such thing as a separate claim.

It is

not separate; it is a related, closely intertwined legal
theories.

And that kind of single claim multiple theory

kind of litigation is not subject to a Rule 54(b) certifica­
tion .
Q

Would your argument fail if there had been 15

or 16 similar transactions on the horizon?

14
MR, LEVANDER:

That might indicate that mootness was

not appropriate in this particular case.

But here mootness

is clearly inappropriate doctrine,
Q

The argument would fail on the hypothetical

1 have given.
MR, LEVANDER:

That is right-well, possibly.

But

here the secretary has—
Q

Why did you just say possibly?--because is not

your whole argument that that claim is moot on these facts,
and I posit facts where it would not be moot®
MR. LEVANDER:

Yes, if there were other transac­

tions already approved, yes, that would foe ongoing.

But

here the secretary has used her power something like five
times since 1936.

Moreover, on the remand, if it had

determined not to go forward with the claim, it would have
determined—she would have determined that the economic
iaipact was sufficiently adverse on the existing Alaskan
traders that the STUYVESANT should not enter, and that
finding—
0

Mr. Levander, on my Colleague Stevens'

hypothesis there were 15 or 16 foreseeable claims in the
future? to avoid mootness you would not only have to have that,
but you would have to have them by the same plaintiff, would
you not?
MR. LEVANDER:

No.

I understood Mr. Justice

15
Stevens' hypothetical to be that there were 15 other applica­
tions granted or in process of being granted as to the
Alaskan trade»
Q

And—
Which might have the same impact on the

plaintiff.
MR» LEVANDER:
Q

On the plaintiffs,

Same impact on the plaintiff,

MR, LEVANDER;

There would have to be—I mean,» 1

take it even plaintiffs would not claim that they have any
right to complain about the secretary's exercise of power in
a situation or in an area of trade which they do not operate *
although they may say otherwise.
As I started to say, that mootness is particularly
appropriate in this case not only because the secretary-' has
so seldcmly exercised her power , which is the appropriate
way that, it should be exercised, but also the finding that
she would have had to make on remand would have militated
against her ever, or in the reasonable future, authorising
any other ship to enter the Alaskan trade, any other ship that
was willing to repay a subsidy and become unsubsidized.
I want to address one point on the merits, if 1
might, unless—
Q

May 1 ask just one other question?

MR. LEVANDER;
Q

Yes,

What is the practical consequence if you

16

prevail on the jurisdictional issue and we dismiss the
appeal, will not the case be right bade here almost immedi­
ately?
MR. LEVANDER:
would be vacated.
court.

Not necessarily.

First of all, it

It would go back down to the district

The district court would have to consider the findings

on remand, and it might actually conclude that the secretary
had abused her discretion and enter the injunction; and the
case would be over.

Otherwise it is possible—the first time

around the district Court and implicitly the court of
appeals rejected our standing claim that plaintiffs do not
have standing.

But. I think that Simon v. Eastern Kentucky

Welfare Rights Organization makes it clear that you can judge
standing from two positions; one at the pleading stage and,
secondly, at the proof stage.

And here the remand proceedings

demonstrate that at least some, if not all, of Trinidad and
Alaska Bulk Ships, which are of the smaller variety, do not
compete against the bigger STUYVESANT vessel.

And, therefore,

it is possible that at least some of the plaintiffs do not
have standing.
Moreover, Shell points out in its brief and footnote
six, I believe, that it has gotten Alaskan oil charters.

And

so, therefore, I ant not quite sure what its potential injury
would be either.
Q

Would not another practical consequence of

17
your prevailing in your jurisdictional claim be that district
courts and courts of appeal and litigants would be much more
careful of the rules that this Court has promulgated as to
when a court case can be appealed and when it cannot?
MR. LEVANDER:
Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

That is absolutely correct,
And as an institutional litigant the

United States has a very great interest in making sure that
the final judgment rule is adhered to, if at all possible.
The United States has been involved in many remand decisions,
and as a general rule the courts of appeal have recognized,
including an opinion by Mr. Justice Blackmun when he was on
the Eighth Circuit, that a remand decision is not a final
judgment for purposes of 1291«,

And we do not think there is

any reason to distinguish from that rule in this case.
Q

As a practical matter, is not my Brother

Stevens correct that this would be remanded to the district
court?

And even though the district court then agreed that

the secretary, on remand to her, now him, I guess, was quite
right in the finding as to the competitive situation, but
nonetheless under the compulsion of the law of the circuit
would enjoin the secretary, would have to?
MR. LEVANDERs

Ho, I think it would vacate the

court of appeals decision.

And, therefore, that decision

vroold not be law of the circuit any longer.

And then you

would have to go through the litigation on the remand, and it

18

might be determined there was no standing of plaintiffs.
Q

It would be an educated guess by any district

judge as to what the lav/ of the circuit was, would it not?
[Laughter]
MR. LEVANDER;
Q

That—-that--

And then Seatrain would be right back up here*

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Now we if ill return to

you, Mr, McDaniels.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM E. MCDANIELS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS, RESUMING
MR. McDANIELS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The STUYVESANT was the recipient under the Merchant
Marine Act of 1936 of two kinds of financial assistance in its
construction.

One was a guaranteed loan in the amount of

$30 million, and the subsidy of $27,2 million which is
designed to equalise the cost between building that vessel
in a domestic shipyard and what it would have cost to build
that vessel in a foreign shipyard.

And as a result, the

contract of CDS contained a provision required by Section
506 of the statute that the owner of the vessel shall agree
to operate that vessel in the foreign trade, except incident
tally on foreign travel and except temporarily upon the
consent of the commission and with a limit of six months out
of every year of its economic life.

In each instance a pro

rata repayment of the subsidy would be required.
Between the time that that contract was entered into
in 1972 and 1977 all foreign trade opportunities for the
vessel ware non-existent.

The Arab oil embargo and the

subsequent downswing in the international market had rendered

21
no need for this vessel in the foreign trade.

At the same

time, however., there was a domestic market that had developed?
the carriage of oil from Valdez? Alaska? the; end of the
Alaska pipeline? around to the west side of the Panama Canal
for throughput to the East Coast.
Q

This was obviously a tanker.

Q

Are there many larger than that?

HR. McDANIELSs

No? there are not many larger.

/

22
There are some in other registry, foreign vessels, that are
larger.

But in terms of our vessels there are not.
The charter that the STUYVESANT was able to obtain

from Sohio was in the domestic trade.

And in order to meet

that charter, the vessel would have to be freed of the
restrictions in its contract, which limited it to six months
out of every year and then with the consent of the commission.
So that in August of 1977 the petitioners applied to the
secretary for permission to amend the contract, to delete
the provisions, and to repay the subsidy which had been
provided.

And that was approved on August 30, 1977.

And

basis of a rather complicated sale transaction*»Q

So, at the moment the interest has

The subsidy is being paid back in equal

semiannual installments over the 20-year economic life of the
vessel.

And the vessel has been in the trade since September

30, 1977, has been working the trade since that time when
the preliminary injunction sought here was denied.
The authority that we rely upon, the secretary
relies upon—
Q

I suppose you would not challenge the idea

that payment of interest might be a reasonable or a sensible
administrative decision.
MR. MsDAMIELBs

I suspect, Your

Honor, that is a

request that we would not refuse, if that was to ba the
position of the secretary that now that would be required,
our clients would acknowledge that.

The secretary did

analyse the financial aspects of it on remand to show that it
did not result in any competitive disadvantage to the plain­
tiffs.

But we would not quarrel with that requirement.
The question of statutory interpretation for power

to make this amendment and to accept subsidy repayment
involves, in the first instance, the language of the statute

/

24
itself»

That is* Section 504 gives the power to contract in

this EDS area and gives with if necessarily the power to
amend and terminate.
In addition, Section 207 of the act specifically
gives the secretary powers to contract the system with the
purposes of the Merchant Marine Act* 1936 and specifically
further to protect and to preserve or to improve the collateral
position.

We submit the exercise of the power, if you look

to the circumstances of this case, fully met each and every
one of the purposes of the act set forth in Section 101 as
well as holding that a desire to preserve and protect and
improve the secretary’s collateral position.

It met the

purposes of the act because the shipyard was benefited by
the ability to sell the vessel and to have financial commit­
ments recognized.
The vessel itself is a viable vessel.

Instead of

going into layup, it is a viable vessel with American built,
American owned, and operated by American crew, available for
any national need.
The trade area itself was in need of further tonnage
and still is.

There was an undersupply of this type of

shipyard tonnage to carry the Alaskan oil.

Therefore, the

secretary was able to address the need in the trade by
permitting the domestic use of this tanker.
her collateral position was protected.

Furthermore,

First of all, the

25
secretary will receive back $27»2 million that obviously
would not otherwise have to be repaid since at the outset
it was a direct subsidy grant»

In addition, there are

$28«6 million of the proceeds of the sale that went immedi­
ately to discharge loans which the secretary guaranteed under
EDA»

The $28.6 million went directly to discharge those

guaranteed loans.
In addition, the $30 million of Title XI assistance,
which was guaranteed loans, which was increased to an addi­
tional $30 million at the closing, received an improved
collateral position because the vessel was a viable vessel
in a trade earning charter rate.

there are compelling indications that it is wrong, particu­
larly whereas here the secretary's interpretation has been

decision.

It was first done in 1964 in the Grace Line

It has been consistently spoken about by the

secretary ever since both in terms of other, although
infrequent, application for this relief and in its messages
to Congress.
Q

You say infrequent.

It is alleged somewhere

in here that it has only been done twice, the Grace Line case

MR. McDANIELS:

Yes.

There have been applications

have also received approval for this to be done but are

This litigation?

MR. McDANIELS:

No, they are contingent upon the

Virgin Islands if that were to become part of the domestic
trade, which it is not now; then the particular vessels
involved would be freed of their restrictions.

So, it is

contingent upon certain events happening in the future.

But

the principle has been recognized and accorded full value.
Q

So, it has actually been done only twice, in

the Grace Lina situation and in this case; Is that right?
MR. McDANIELS:

Yes.

And the three other times it,

It is additionally approved.

MR. McDANIELS :
in the industry.

Yes»

And the power is well known

It has been spoken ©£ before Congress by

industry spokesmen as well as the legislators themselves.
i

And this particular power has survived the amendment of the
statute in 1970 and has been specifically called to the atten­
tion of Congress twice, in 1972 and again in 1978®

And I

think the 1972 history is most important because in 1972
Congress specifically enacted positive legislation to

facilitate the secretary in grant-in-trade release restric­
tions,, release the trade restrictions, and repayment of the
subsidy because it amended Title XI to provide guaranteed
financing in the cases of an applicant who seeks to repay
like $27.2 million to gain trade restriction relief.

As

ultimately enacted the bill was broadened to include financing
of any repayment of subsidy, including the more common
repayment pursuant to the temporary relief authorised by
Section 506.

6ut it is clear that the Grace Line precedent

was called to the attention of Congress.

Congress not only

did not disapprove of it but specifically granted positive
legislation facilitating its exercise.
In light of these aspects and canons of statutory
construction, there is not in this case any compelling
indicationi- either in the language of the act or its history
or its purposes, that the secretary's interpretation ia wrong.
The language which the plaintiffs rely upon is Section 506 of
the act, which provides for when a vessel cen enter the
domestic trade while it retains its subsidy.

We submit that

that section, by its very language, has no application to a
vessel such as the STUYVBSA23T, which has repaid its subsidy.
There is nothing in that section that precludes the secretary
■

from exercising the power here, nor is there anything in the
legislative history that suggests this action is contrary to
the intent of the act.

28

In 1936 Senator Hugo Black afc that; time issued the
report which formed the basis for the act.

Chairman Kennedy, who presented the amendment, said
that there was an ambiguity in the 1936 statute.

The only

ambiguity in that statute, upon analysis, is that it appears
to permit the subsidised vessel to return to the trades for a
period of three months and not have to remit any pro rata
share of the previous subsidy.

This section was entirely

And as rewritten it makes the matter of

trade restrictions a contractual term to which the owner shall
agree.

We submit to the Court there is nothing in the

29
legislative history that suggests that that omission, of the
language was done with the intention of depriving the seeretary of the power she has exercised here.

One word of such

intent is in the legislative history, and indeed the people
from the industry who spoke about the amendment at the time
considered the amendment to increase the opportunity for
competition between subsidized vessels and • non-suhsitiized
vessels rather than decreasing it.
Q

Mr. McDaniels—

MR. MCDANIELS:
Q

Yes, sir.

“-is the Merchant Marine Act of 1936 the

original act here?
MR. McDANIELSs

Yes.

Prior to the Merchant Marine

Act of 1936, subsidies for the foreign trade had been done
indirectly by virtue of the mail subsidy route, that the
government would subsidize the carriage of mail.

And that

was a problem because a carrier who could be carrying the mail
with subsidy would also be involved in the domestic trade.
That was found to be an inadequate and improper way of subsi­
dising vessels for the foreign trade.
subsidy had existed before.

So, the concept of

But. the particular construction

differential subsidy program, the direct outright grant,
began in 1936.

And I submit that this is actually the main

focus of Congress throughout, was to prevent there being
simultaneously a vessel that has a subsidy competing with

30

vessels that do not have subsidies, that the only competition
that was a concern to Congress was competition by a vessel
which still retained its subsidy with other vessels, which
had not been built with subsidy»
Q

Of course this vessel would not exist without

the subsidy, would it?
MR. McDANIELS:
so.

Your Honor, that is not necessarily

The vessel could have been built without the subsidy.

In fact, it was built with the subsidy.

It may well be that

it contains certain features that it would not have had other
than the subsidy.

But you could in theory build this vessel

without subsidies.
Q

In theory but not economically.

MR. McDANIELS:

There are vessels bigger than this

that are built certainly in other countries.
Q

Not in American shipyards.

MR. McDANIELS:
Q

No.

That is the whole point.

MR. McDANIELS:

The vessel, in terms of its

economic burden, however, bears it now.

And that is to say

by virtue of requiring the repayment of subsidy, it stands
in the same position as it would if it had made the decision
to build the vessel, including the $2,700.
Q
house.

Something like paying off the mortgage on a

You could not own the house had you not had the

31
mortgage.
MR. McDANIELS:

Ho, but the difference, Your Honor,

in terms of the problem of competition is jvist as if the
vessel had been financed by a loan and that that loan is
being paid off.

As far as its competitive impact, it is as

if this vessel“~the original decision was to make a domestic
vessel this size at this cost because that is the economic
burden that the vessel carries at this time.
Q

As a matter of economics, business economics,

is this situation, in your view, essentially the same as
though the Chase Manhattan had financed by a lien on the
ship the precise amount that was given by way of a subsidy
here, with conditions imposed by Chase Manhattan as it would
be in the lien, and now they have exercised the right for an
accelerated payoff?

Just economically the situation is the

same?
MR. McDANIELS:

I would agree that the burden on

the vessel is the same.
Q

I am not asserting it,

I am asking your view

of it on that.
MR. McDANIELS:

I do feel it is the same.

It is as

if the vessel had been constructed with the aid of financing
in the amount of $27.2 million instead of a subsidy because
in planning a charter rate for the vessel it now must contem­
plate servicing that debt.

So, it is the same as if instead

32

of having a subsidy in the first instance there had been a
loan in that amount which it now must consider when it
services its debt.
Q

The quid pro quo for the subsidy are the

conditions which the federal government attaches on it, going
back into the history of our Merchant Marine, is that not so?
MR. McDANIELS:
foreign trade.

That is correct, its service in the

And when that quid pro quo no longer applies—

that is, when the subsidy is paid back, the reason for the
quid pro quo no longer exists either.
Q

If you borrow from a private source, usually

at least with a penalty you can pay it off if you have the
right to pay it off.

Are you suggesting you have the right

to pay back the subsidy if the secretary does not want it?
MR. McDANIELS:

No, no, no.

I thought the question

was in terms of the economic burden of this vessel.

Certainly

it would require the agreement of the seeretar?/ to pay back
the subsidy.
0

It is the secretary who has to agree to accept

it and also make these findings —
MR. McDANIELS:
Q

Yes, that is correct.

■—about these competitive impacts.

MR. McDANIELS:

Under the district court9s opinion

the secretary must consider­
em

You do not contest that, do you?

33

MR. McDANIELS:

No, I do not.

I think that one of

the factors that you consider is competitive impact.

That is

not the only one because there are a number of others that
are concerned who are protecting a collateral-»
Q

But the secretary just cannot say, "By the

way, I'd like to have that money back" and you just pay it.
He has to make some findings.
MR. McDANIELS:

He does because his decision in

that regard would be reviewable on whether it is arbitrary
and capricious.

And the findings would be related to the

purposes of the act and the purposes of the reason for making
the repayment—protecting collateral, servicing a trade,
making a viable vessel available for national emergency, and
competitive effect.
Q

That is one--

If it were a Chase loan, Chase could take the

money and the borrower could pay it no matter what the
competitive impact was.
MR. McDANIELS;
Q

Yes.

I understood that—

No, not without a provision for granting the

right of prepayment.
MR. McDANIELS;
or without penalty.

Unless there was a prepayment with

But I understood the thrust of the

Chief Justice's question to be whether or not the vessel
competitively sits as if it had received on day one a $27.2
million loan from Chase Manhattan as opposed to a subsidy.

34
And in that respect it is the same because it is servicing
the repayment of that debt at the present time.
Q
aspects.

My question was limited to the economic

The Chase Manhattan has not any interest in

preserving an independent or a viable Merchant Marine, which
the government has.
MR, McDANIELS:
Q

I agree.

That is the difference.

That is why the

secretary retains that control, is it not?
MR. McDANIELS:

It is, and I took the Chief

Justice’s question to mean that you were concerned with
whether there was some benefit that the party receives that
he would not have received if he had had a loan in the first
instance instead of a subsidy.
Q

Do you think that if the recipient of the

subsidy tenders back the subsidy to the secretary and the
secretary refuses the tender, that action could be reviewed
under the Administrative Procedure Act as to whether it was
arbitrary and capricious?
MR. McDANIELS:

I think that it could.

I think

that it would be a difficult burden for the person who is
seeking the exercise of discretionary authority to achieve
the standard to reverse it, arbitrary and capricious, but I
think it would be subject to review.

And in particular the

secretary has now indicated that it will be promulgating rules

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. AMY LOESERMAN KLEIN
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS ALASKA BULK CARRIERS, INC.
AND TRINIDAD CORPORATION
MRS. KLEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The government commenced its jurisdictional argu­
ment by filing briefs in this Court which

almost did not

address the issue of Rule 54(b); the initial government briefs
on jurisdiction were all addressed to the finality issue as
that concept is understood under 28 USC 1291»

In our rep^y

brief we focused the argument on Rule 54(b) because it was a
Rule 54(b) order that was entered by the district court.
And because our complaint so clearly asked for relief more
than the mere barring of the STUYVESANT.

The government

initially made its final order .argument purely on the supposi­
tion that the only relief that the plaintiffs below had
asked for was the barring of the STUYVESANT.
ment said you had two theories for that.

And the govern­

You had a theory

that there was no power to waive the STUYVESANT into the

36

domestic trades.

And you had a theory that if there were

power, the competitive effect was such that the power should
i-

not be exercised.

And we said no, that is not our complaint;

you have rewritten our complaint.

What our complaint said

was that the STUYVESANT should not be in the domestic trades
i

because the secretary has no power, and for other reasons
there were claims of violations under the Administrative
»

Procedure Act.

But we also said that the secretary has no

power to wake any vessel built with subsidy into the domestic
trades, and we asked for a declaratory judgment to that
effect and we asked for an injunction to that effect.

And

we referred in our complaint to the BAY RIDGE, which is a
sister ship of the STUYVESANT built by the same interests
nearing completion as to which we alleged that if the power
to waive the Section 506 bar were upheld for the STUYVESANT,
that there would be similar exercise for the BAY RIDGE
because the BAY RIDGE was also built with subsidy.
was the same government collateral risk.

There

There were heavy

government loan guarantees from the Economic Development
Administration.

And we asked for an injunction barring the

exercise of the waiver power for the BAY RIDGE and for any
other vessel ever built with construction differential
subsidy.

Q

You represent Alaska Bulk Carriers, Incorporated?
(
MRS. KLEINi That is correct, and Trinidad.

37
Q

And when you talking about the complaint, you

are talking about .its complaint?
MRS. KLEIN:

That is correct, sir.

So that not only is there a hypothetical of 15 or 16
ships in the wings, but there was an actuality one that was
referred to in the complaint.
clear, these are huge vessels.

And as has already been made
And one may be considered an

equivalent perhaps of the 15 or 16 hypotheticals in a dif­
ferent situation.
Q

But would the theory that you advanced on

behalf of—is it BAY RIDGE?
MRS. KLEIN:
Q

Yes.

—be substantially the same as that which you

advanced on behalf of the STUYVESANT?
MRS. KLEIN:
yes, identical.
Q

As far as the waiver is concerned,

But the secretary—
Then it really would not have been a necessarily

different claim; would it just have been a different theory?
MRS. KLEIN:
theory.

No, it would not have been a different

What we said was that the secretary had no power to

waive the Section 506 bar, and the relief that we asked for
was an injunction going against the STUYVESANT and an injunc­
tion going against the exercise of that waiver authority for
any other vessel ever built with CDS.
Q

Could the injunction have been granted without

38

the lesser included relief having been granted?
MRS - KLEIN;

An injunction could have been issued

against the STUYVESANT for the reason of violation of the
Administrative Procedure Act, which was also alleged in our
complaint and eventually sustained by the district court.
That was the reason for the remand.

The district court found

a violation of the Administrative Procedure Act.

So, the

STUYVESANT could have been barred for reasons going to issues
involved in the remand.

But the general injunction against

waiver of the power for any vessel could only be granted
upon the determination as to statutory authority.

And that

was the determination made by the district court.

So that

once the district court decided

the secretary had the

disputed authority, the issue as to our entitlement for an
injunction as to the BAY RIDGE and all other vessels in that
class was finally and irrevocably decided.
Q

You could have gotten the result you wanted,

but you could' not have gotten it by the injunctive relief
in a general injunction against the secretary?
MRS. KLEIN;

We could not have gotten the relief

we sought, which was a declaratory judgment that the secre­
tary lacked the disputed authority.
against us.

That was finally decided

The only thing we could have gotten was that the

exercise of that authority with respect to the STUYVESANT
was invalid.

I think that we finally convinced the government

39

that our complaint said what we said it said instead of what
they said it said because on the reply brief the government
moved away from the contention that we only advanced one claim
for relief, which was to bar the STUYVESANT, and the government
said that we had no right to ask for anything other than the
barring of the STUYVESANT because we were not presenting the
judiciary with a case or controversy under Article III.

And

the reason for that was said to be that we were asking for
something that was not concrete, that we had to wait as each
vessel was waived into the fleet, and we had to bring the
same lawsuit; and if we did not get the waiver set aside for
some other reason, then and only then could we focus on the
statutory authority.

And with respect we think that the issue

is a question of ripeness, the case or controversy issue.
Q

I do not know if you have mentioned in your

argument, but in your brief you rely fairly heavily also on
the appealability of this district

judge's order on the

ground that it was denial of an injunction.
MRS. KLEIN;
Q

Absolutely.

At 1292(a)(1).

1292(a)(1) which is quite a different and

alternative ground to 54.
MRS. KLEIN;

That is correct.

of an injunction.

We think that it was

It v/as a final denial

Nothing that happened on remand could

possibly have altered the decision below that we were not

40

entitled to an injunction barring the waiver of any vessel
built with CDS into the domestic Merchant Marine.
Q

So, you say there certainly was a controversy

between you and the federal parties although there may not
have been a controversy between you and Seatrain.
MRS. KLEIN:
Q

That is correct.

Do you think there was a controversy between

you and Seatrain on that second issue?
MRS. KLEIN:

We posed the waiver of—

Q

You really were asking for the injunction

against the federal parties.
MRS. KLEIN:

But the injunction was asked against

the government, yes, sir.
Q

And all you need is to say there was a case

or controversy between you and the federal parties.
HRS. KLEIN:
Q

Unquestionably, yes.

Would it not have been possible under the

Administrative Procedure Act, if the secretary had come back
and said, t!I have corrected whatever defects the district
court found," for the district court to have nonetheless
enjoined the secretary from doing what she proposed to do or.
the grounds that it would have been in violation of the
Administrative Procedure Act for her to have done it?
MRS. KLEIN:

Yes.

We could have conceivably gotten

an injunction against the STUYVESANT.

But we could not have

41
gotten an injunction against the exercise.

We could not have

gotten a declaratory judgment that the secretary lacked the
power o
Q

Because the BAY RIDGE was still on the draining

boards.
MRS. KLEIN;

That is correct, but our complaint

made very clear, pointed out~-it was a substantial part of
our entire case—-that the mere exercise of the power or, to
say it, the mere affirmation of the power has an immediate
impact upon us, upon our industry, upon the unsubsidised
domestic Merchant Marine.
Q

So that whatever happened on remand, unless

the district court changed its mind, you were out of business
on your injunction.
MRS. KLEIN:

That is correct.

That is correct, and

we are in a totally different trade, as it were.
our complaint.

We are in a different trade.

That was

We have assets

that are worth a different amount than they were before the
secretary said that she hati the power.

We have a whole dif-

ferent growth situation before the secretary said that she
had the power.

And I think a fair reading of our complaint

will show that we were at least as much or even more concerned
about the secretarial interpretation, that at any point in
time the secretary could waive into the unsubsidized Merchant
Marine, into the domestic trade, vessels built with subsidy at

42
any time merely by consenting to the repayment of the
unamortized subsidy,
Q

Mrs. Klein, may I ask you two questions.

Your

argument does not necessarily apply to Shell, as I understand,
because they have quite a different complaint.
MRS. KLEIN:
Q

That is correct.

Secondly, is it not correct that the appeal-

ability under 1292(a)(1), denial of an injunction theory,
really boils down to the same question as appealability under
1291 because you must, even on that theory, assume that the
injunction against the exercise of power is a broader form of
relief than the injunction against the recision of this
particular deal?
MRS. KLEIN:

It can be looked at that way, but there

is also an argument that there is a separate right of appeal
under 1292(a)(1) irrespective of whether we were asking for
more than one—we had more than one claim for relief.
Q

Even if they were precisely the same claims for

relief, two different alternate theories of getting the same
injunction, under 1292(a)(1) you might have appealability even
though you would not under 1291?
MRS. KLEIN;

We think so because under 1292(a)(1)

we were finally denied an injunction as to this class of
vessels, and nothing could change*—
Q

Then that is the broader point.

That is what I

43
MRS. KLEIN;
Q

Yes, that is correct,

All right.

MRS. KLEIN:

Petitioners’ statutory construction

rests upon the conception that this statute establishes a
quid pro quo relationship, and that is the key.
theme that the statute carries out.

That is the

If subsidy is retained,

there is a restriction against trading, domestic trading.
Once subsidy is returned it is said that the restriction
dissolves,.

We think that that is not what the statute says.

While there is some quid pro quo relationship, it is not an
open-ended quid pro quo relationship.

The statute says that

subsidy is given for operation in foreign trade.

The statute

has two exceptions to that, incidental domestic trading and
domestic trading, purely domestic trading, for no longer than
six months.

If the vessel engages in those two exceptions,

the vessel must return subsidy pro rata.
of the quid pro quo relationship.

That is the extent

The opportunity to engage

in trading other than foreign is limited, but there is no
open-ended statutory scheme whereby a vessel operator can
decide to go into any trade other than the ones that subsidy
was given for merely by repaying subsidy..
effect acknowledge that.

Petitioner's in

They do not say that you can go into

any incodental trade, for example, other than the enumerated
foreign incidental trades.

They do not say you can go into

domestic trade for eight months.

They say there is only one

44
other one-third example where you can go into*—where the
quid pro quo relationship is carried out.

And that third

example is, they say, that if you return all the subsidy or
the unamortized subsidy at any point during the vessel5s life,
then the restriction just dissolves.

The first two quid pro

4

quo relationships are found directly in the statute.
third one is not found in the statute.

The

But the petitioners

say that is okay, it should be implied into the statute.
The reason it should be implied into the statute is because
it carries out the quid pro quo theme.

But. the quid pro quo

theme rtself is a concoction, we submit, of petitioners.
There is no general quid pro quo theme, and indeed they
acknowledge that.
Moreover, the fact that there are two instances
in which a vessel built with subsidy can engage in other
than foreign trade upon a repayment of subsidy clearly does
not imply this third quid pro quo relationship the petitioners
have concocted, for the reason that it was the very category
of instances that unquestionably was taken out of the act in
1938 when the statute was rewritten.

All parties here

agree that the 1936 act, the act that was originally enacted,
had a Section 506 that might be interpreted as establishing
precisely these three quid pro quo relationships.

But in

1938 unquestionably that third quid pro quo came out of the
statute.

45
Petitioners here spend a lot of time on the ’36 act,
but the '36 act is not the law anymore? it is the 838 amendment
that is the law,
Q

The government's view is, as I remember, that

the deletion of that third quid pro quo was inadvertence»
MRS. KLEIN:

That is what they say.

We have cited

the legislative history chapter and verse to show that it was
not only an inadvertence, the section was rewritten at the
request

of the then chairman of the Maritime Commission,

Chairman Kennedy, Joseph Kennedy, who said, "We find it
confusing to have these two consents which we could give, oxie
for unlimited operation for return of subsidy, and another for
a temporary emergency.

We find that confusing and take out

this third instance.'’ And that is exactly what the Congress did

lie had been chairman of the committee or

subcommittee in "36.
MRS. KLEIN:
Q

That is right.

Did Chairman Kennedy say in words to take out

this third alternative?
MRS. KLEIN:
and confusing.

I suppose not.

He said it is ambiguous

And then he said how the section should be

rewritten, and as revjritten it was taken out.
Q

Eut he never said in words that a total recision

would be a bad' idea.

MRS. KLEIN:

He said, "We find the two consents that

we are empowered to give ambiguous and confusing, and v/e want
the section rewritten so that the total payout is taken out. '
2\nd that was the language that he proposed, and that was the
language that was enacted.
Q

You do not quote him as saying, "We want the

total payout taken out"?
MRS. KLEIN:

No.

No.

If I did, I overreached

myself.
Q

Did he submit a draft with it out?

MRS. KLEIN:

Yes.

He said as the section is

rewritten.
Q

And "I want it rewritten as attached." .

MRS„ KLEIN:

As the section is rewritten.

be sure of that, no, Your Honor.
Q

I cannot

He said---

Did he submit a draft or did he not?

MRS. KLEIN:

I believe he did, but I cannot be sure

of that.
Q

With the language out, or was it in?

MRS. KLEIN:

When the amendment was introduced, the

chairman of the committee said, "This has been rewritten wholly
in the light of the suggestions of the Maritime Commission."
Q

That infers that somebody besides the chairman

had written it.
MRS. KLEIN:

And he said, "And largely in. the words

47
of the Maritime Commission."
Q

"Largely."

MRS. KLEIN:

I think we have the exact quote in our

brief.
Q

Two-thirds, two-thirds at least?

MRS. KLEIN:
Q

Yes.

Mrs. Klein, the government also argues that if

you just had a transaction authorized, the subsidy with the
restriction on it, and did not say anything one way or another
about rescinding the transaction, that the government would
nave, just pursuant to its general powers

to make contracts

and amend them and so forth—they would have the power to, in
effect, rescind this transaction.

Would you agree with that?

In other words, do you have to rely on the fact- that the
authority for the legislative history, plus the authority for
six months permission, impliedly prohibits anything else.
That is your argument, as I understand it.
MRS. KLEIN:

No, I do not think we have to,

I think

we can rely just on the statute that says that you are
supposed to have subsidy for the foreign trade, and that is
the only purpose for which you can give subsidy.
Q

Supposing you had a statute that just contem­

plated cne transaction like the Chrysler proposal now or this
one vessel, and Congress said, ,rWe will give you a subsidy for
this 'transaction, and we will authorize a subsidy for this

48

transaction provided there is a restriction on domestic
commerce put in the contract," and that was all that was
done and the contract was made pursuant to the statute and
nothing was said one way or another about rescinding it.

Do

you think the secretary would have power to rescind such a
contract?
MRS« KLEIN:

No.

I think the carrying out of the

legislative intent is that you take the subsidy and you ful­
fill the contract.
Q

And it must be a permanent restriction.

Q

In other words, it is a permanent relationship?

MRS. KLEIN:

So tiie lower court found after very

extensive analysis, yes.
Q

Like the mark of Cain on this vessel.

MRS. KLEIN:

That is true.

That is what the vessel

was built for; that is why the aids were extended.
Q

With taxpayers' money.

MRS. KLEIN:

With taxpayers' money.

Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mrs. Klein.

Mr. Shulman.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN N. SHULMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT SHELL OIL COMPANY
MR. SHULMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I would like to pick up one or two points with

49

regard to the jurisdictional question that strike me as still
hanging a little bit.

One was that Mr. Justice White asked

whether or not there was still a case or controversy, there
would still be a case or controversy vis-a-vis Seatrain.

And

previously to that there had been questions raised as to what
would happen if there were 15 or 16 ships in the wings.
believe Mr. Justice Stevens raised that question.

I

The

important point to remember is that the STUYVESANT itself was
standing in the wings because with the only relief that could
be gotten injunctively, given the district court’s order, what
you would have was an injunction against the STUYVESANT
based upon the competitive conditions then.

then

And there could

have been a new attempt 30 days later to put the STUYVESANT
in again.

So that the STUYVESANT itself was waiting in the

wings tc be entered again into domestic trade when the
respondents had been denied a permanent injunction.
I would like also to advert to the point that
Mr. Levander made suggesting that following a remand proceeding
before the Department of Commerce, it would have been possible
to question the standard of what then would have been plain­
tiffs tc bring the action.

And I would say, one, it is a

strange procedure indeed that if you were remanded for a
determination of competitive impact and there was a finding of
no competitive impact, you thereby lose your standing to
attack or to review the finding of no competitive impact.

And

50

quite apart from that, it is certainly true that a two-year
charter of the Shell ship, which is what happened, does not
take care of 20 years of injury when the STDYVESANT is perma­
nently waived.
The question carae up-—Mr. Chief Justice Burger
raised the question about the similarity between this case
and the Chase Manhattan Bank financing.

And then Mr. Justice

White raised the point that you might be able to pay back the
Chase Manhattan Bank, with Mr. Justice Rehnquist pointing out
that you might need a prepayment requirement but that the
secretary might not be able to be forced to take back CDS.
Instead the secretary would have to make some findings before
she could take back CDS.

The only place where there are any

findings suggested at all that the secretary might have to
make is in the opinion of Judge Richey.

The statute does not

set forth any findings for the secretary to make.

The reason

why the statute does not set forth any findings for the secre­
tary to make is because there never was a thought that there
would be a permanent payback of CDS.
Q

What about temporary?

MR. SHULMAN s
temporary.

There cure findings to be made for a

The finding is that it is necessary or appropriate

to the purposes of the act.

And that is one of the reasons

why Chairman Kennedy raised the

question in 1938 with regard

to the ambiguity because there was absolutely no standard

51
suggested other than the three months standard»
Finally I would like to make a point in response to
Mr. Justice Stevens® question with respect to whether or not
a one-time statute with a one-time contract with restrictions
would, be amendable by the contracting party , to which
Mrs. Klein answered no, it would not be.

And I certainly want

to endorse everything that Mrs. Klein says before this Court.
But J. would add one additional point, that the words of Title
506, Section 506, are not "the purchaser."
"every owner."

The words are

The words are "every ownser shall agree."

And

the whole purpose of those words is that they go on as title
goes on.

And in fact the Maritime Administration referred to

this as a covenant running with the ship.
Q

Of course they did cigree.

MR. SHULMAN:
Q

What?

They did agree.

MR. SHULMAN:
Mr. Justice Stevens.

The owner did agree.

That is a very interesting point,
The fact of the matter is that the

current owner did not agree in the face of the language which
said every owner must agree because the secretary removed it
before that owner had to agree with it.

This whole case has

presented-Q

Does it not boil down, Mr. Shulman, to whether

or not Congress intended to protect your clients and others
similarly situated from competition, on the one hand, or from

52
subsidized competition on the other?
MR, SHULMANs

That would be an adequate way of

expressing it, Mr. Justice, but I do not think that is a
complete way of expressing it because the whole issue with^
regards to CDS is foreign commerce.
for foreign commerce.

CDS' has no meaning except

It is not CDL, construction differential
*

loan.

It is talking about paying it back.

case of the tail wagging the dog.

It is the worst

It is a subsidy.

The sec­

retary of commerce really does not want the subsidy back.
What she wants is ships in foreign commerce.
Q

Yes, but if ships are not usable in foreign

commerce, there can be at least temporary use in domestic
commerce,
MR. SHULMAN:
Q

That is exactly correct. Your Honor.

If there are some findings.

MR. SHULMAN:

That is exactly correct.

And that is:

precisely the balance that is drawn.
Q

In which event there has to be some refund of

the subsidy.
MR. SHULMAN:

That is precisely correct.

And the

reason for that is that you have a ship built for foreign
commerce, and there may be some incidental needs for it to
participate in domestic commerce,

One of those are the

enumerated trades that are set forth in Title 506.

And the

other is a temporary transfer up to six months when the

53

secretary has made the necessary findings»
Q

I suppose the secretary could string temporary

exemptions together as long as each time he made another
finding.
MR. SHULMAN:

But you can only string the exemptions

after a six-month hiatus.
Q

Yes.

MR. SHULMAN:
Q

Right, that any time that—

Six months on and six months off, six months

on and six months off.
MR. SHULMAN:
Q

That is correct.

Indefinitely?

MR. SHULMAN:

On the assumption that it did in fact—

was necessary or appropriate to effectuate the purposes of the
act.
Q

If proper findings were made.

MR. SHULMAN:
Q

Yes.

You could do that indefinitely if the necessary

findings were made.

But those findings could be challenged

in a judicial proceeding?
MR, SHULMAN:

I would expect so, Mr. Chief Justice.

And it is also true that there is a world of difference
between competing with a ship that is available in six-month
units ou: of each year and competing with a ship that is
available for the full year.

54
Q

It would depend to some extezit on which six

months and what tanker market conditions were at the time,
would it not?
MR. SHULMAN:

That question, Mr. Chief Justice,

exactly explains why you would deal in temporary transfers in
this connection because six months is the kind of discrete unit
as to which a rational judgment can be made.
One of the things that came out of the remand pro­
ceeding was the statement by the secretary of commerce that
you could not make a projection more than three years into the
future.

And that is some sort of basis on which to allow a

ship to eigage permanently in foreign trade.

It also speaks to

why there really are no standards in the act because Congress
never intended that there would be a transfer longer than a
six-month period.
There is only one provision in Section 509 which
deals with the question of loans, as this attempts to be
described here, or which deals with the question of building
for the domestic trade.

And that is Section 509, which allows

the secretary to make provision for building a ship and then sel
it to the purchaser for 12-1/2 percent down or 25 percent down,
depending upon what type of ship it is.

And Section 509

specifically says no construction differential subsidy shall
be allowed.

With regard to construction differential subsidy

Title V is perfectly clear that foreign commerce is the sole

55
purpose of it.

Section 501 establishes construction differen­

tial subsidy in these words, quote#

"to aid in the construc­

tion of a new vessel to be used in the foreign commerce of the
United States."
The secretary of commerce must determine, before
approving an application, that, quote, "The plans and specifi­
cations call for a new vessel which will meet the requirements
of the foreign commerce of the United States."

She has to

determine, quote, "that the plans will aid in the promotion
and development of such commerce.

And Section 506, as I

pointed out before, is a continuing prescription.
apply to the purchaser or the shipyard.
owner.

It does not

It applies to every

It says every owner shall agree, not may agree.

It

applies to every vessel for which CDS has bean paid, not has
been and paid and has not been repaid.

It allows only the two

indicated domestic uses, one incidental and, two, for sixmonth periods.

And it is the result of an amendment in 1938

at which time Chairman Kennedy did submit a draft.
Kennedy’s draft was enacted.

Chairman

And the words that Chairman

Kennedy said to describe this were, quote:

"If the owner

desires to engage in domestic trades other than those enumerated
in the section, he can do so only by receiving the consent of
the commission.

The consent for this service is limited to six

months in any one year."
Q

Was that what he was criticizing or was that

56

what he wanted?
MR, SHULMAN:

I am not sure that I have the quali­

fication to answer that question, Mr, Justice Rehnquist.

That

was both the only ambiguity in the act and the ambiguity that
he said was being corrected.

So, I think it was both what he
\

was criticizing and what he wanted in the sense that he was
observing the one ambiguity and. he was suggesting the correc­
tion.
Q

By another ambiguity.

MR. SHULMAN:
contains any ambiguity.

I do not find the section since 1333
The only way that the section can

contain an ambiguity is the way that is classically brought
out by footnote ttiro of the government's reply brief, which
says that a ship that has repaid the subsidy in full, and
therefore, no longer enjoys the benefits of that subsidy, is
simply not a vessel for which subsidy has been paid.
If a ship which has been paid subsidy, which must
have beer, paid subsidy, in order to repay subsidy is not a
ship as to which subsidy has been paid, I do not know what
ship might be.
is clear.

There is no warrant in the statirte.

The statute

There is no need to go to the legislative history.

And if the legislative history is gone into end considered, it
is

clear that the statute advertently does what it does, which

is to confine any sort of domestic trade by CDS-built ships to
two types—'incidentally enumerated services end six-month

57
temporary transfer.

Thank you very much.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. McDaniels.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM E. McDANIELS, ESQ.,
ON, BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. McDANIELS:

Yes, may it please the Court:

I think that the statute clearly sets forth the kinds
of findings that the secretary must consider when it says in
207 that she may contract consistent with the purposes of the
act-—those are set forth in 101—-and to protect and preserve
her collateral, which she did here.

It would be an unreasonable

interpretation of the statute to bind the secretary where, on
the one hand, you give her the power to invest $70 million of
the taxpayers5 money to say she can never react to the volatile
trading circumstances that occur in the maritime trade.

She

must have, this flexibility.
And with respect to the 1938 history, Mr. Justice
Stewart, the key there is this language that Mr. Kennedy
proposed was said at the same time that he says we have no
intent to change the original purpose of the section.

The

original purpose of the section was to remain the same.

It

clearly countenanced the right to have permanent payback.

And

the fact is that since 1936 and 1938 and clearly since 1954,
the unsubsidised carriers have realized that this possibility
existed.

They proposed--the unsubsidized carriers—proposed

legislation to permanently ban forever a subsidized vessel

58

from ever coining into the domestic trade.
done that.

Congress has never

Congress has never passed that legislation.

Instead the statutory scheme permits a half of the life--ten
years of the vessel5s life while subsidized can be spent in
direct competition with a subsidized vessel.
Q

Ten years in these—

MR. McDANIELS;

Six-month periods.

And that is more

dangerous to their interest frankly because you could pick
and choose as your foreign carrier the six months you want.
Here—
Q

If the secretary—

MR. McDANIELS:

If she will let you, exactly.

But

in this case we are committed as a domestic—we are now a
Jones Act carrier, always have been, the same as they are.
We are notv committed to the domestic trade to take the ups and
downs.

They are still in business.

We are still in business.

They still have a market, and we still have a market.

There

is no sense in any way, shape or form in the history that
there was to be freedom from competition from the vessel, only
freedom from unfair competition.
Q

Unfair—greenhorn in this.

But why do you say

you are locked into the domestic trade?
MR. McDANIELS:

Because the return of the subsidy

makes us a vessel which—
Q

It makes you free to go into the domestic trade.

Q

Yes.

But we can go 5.nto foreign

MR. MCDANIELS:

We stand at equal competitive

footing with them.
Q

You still have your options, and now you can

MR. MCDANIELS:

Exactly, but we cannot compete in

the foreign trade with the benefit of subsidy.

So, in terms

of our trading options, the domestic trade has to be the first
opportunity.

of Congress that the welfare of the country depends on a strong

Absolutely consistent with it

because the strong Merchant Marine would not have been served
if this vessel and its capacities were put into dry dock and
not available.

with an American crew, is a primary goal of the Merchant
Marine A.st, particularly when it causes no adverse competitive
effects to the unsubsidized carrier, which is the situation
here based on all the findings in the case„
