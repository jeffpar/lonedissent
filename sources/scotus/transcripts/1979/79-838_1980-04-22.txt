We will now hear arguments

in the State of Maine v Thiboutot.
fir. Smith, I think you may proceed whenever you
are ready»
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES EASTMAN SMITH, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. SMITH:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.
A Writ of Certiorari was granted to the Maine
Supreme Judicial Court on January 21, 1980, in the above
matter.

Questions presentee therein were threefold:
First, whether the. Petitioners' good faith viola-"

tion of the Federal Social Security Act and its regulations,
with the resulting incorrect reduction of AFDC benefits to
the Respondents, but without a violation of Respondents*
constitutional rights, constitutes a violation of 42 USC
Section 1983.
The second question posed was whether the Civil
Rights Act of 1976, 42 USC Section 1988, allotvs considera­
tion of an award of attorney's fees to Respondents who pre~
vail solely on a Social Security Act claim in an Action
where no violation of constitutional rights is found.
The final question was whether or not 42 USC Sec­
tion 1983 affords Respondents a remedy in. the State Court

4
for a violation of the Social“Security Act.
The statement of the facts follows.
The Respondentsr Lionel and Joline Thiboutot, are
married and have eight children.

Four of those children are

theirs pursuant to their common marriage.

Three of the

children were brought into the common marriage pursuant to a
prior marriage of Mr. Thiboutot*s„

One child was Mrs.

Thiboutot.8 s pursuant to a prior marriage.
In November of 1971, the State of Maine, Departmerit of Human Services, reduced, or notified Mr. Thiboutot
they were going to reduce, his benefits pursuant to a change
in what we believe, deemed by Federal Regulations.,

They

notified him of this proposed change.
The change was as follows:

In computing the net

available income of Mr. Thiboutot, in order to determine the
amount of AFDC benefits to be allowed for his three children
by a prior marriage,

the

Department would no longer sub­

tract that portion of Mr. Thiboutot*s income which went to
the support of the four children by the common marriage.
The effect of this was to count as available, in the compu­
tation of the eligibility ber. efits, income which was actual­
ly unavailable due to Mr. Thiboutot*s legal obligation to
support his four mutual children.
After exhausting their administrative remedies,
the Thiboutots, pursuant to a complaint filed in Superior

5
Court, appealed the Department's decision and on their com­
putation basis»

This appeal was brought originally pursuant

to Maine Rules of Civil Procedure; Rule SOB; and two sta­
tutes which in and of themselves allow for the Maine State
Courts to take jurisdiction of cases such as this:

the

denial or a reduction of AFDC benefits,
On January 7, 1977; an amended complaint was filed
in the same Court»

This followed the enactment of the Civil

Rights Attorneys Fees Act of 1976.

The amended complaint

brought pursuant to 1983, as well as the other State Sta­
tutes which would have allowed jurisdiction in the State as
well as the cause of action,- alleged violation of the Social
Security Act, regulations pertaining to the Social Security
Act. and also asked for certification as a class action
which was granted.
The Maine Superior Court entered judgment for the
Thibontots on the merits.

The Petitioners were enjoined

from enforcing the challenged regulationsy and in compliance
with Court Order, adopted new regulations.

The State also

paid benefits, respectively, to all class members who were
eligible; and also paid retroactive benefits to the
Thiboutots„
However, another issue is
and that issue is

attorney’s fees.

still before the Court,
The Court in subsequent

motion denied the Respondents’ plea for attorney's fees,

which was then, appealed to the Supreme Judicial Court for
the State of Maine.
QUESTIONS What other issues are here now, other
than attorney’s fees?
MR. SMITH:

Whether or not Section 19B3 applies ~~

or whether a violation of the Social Security Act is
encompassed within the parameters of Section 1383.
The reason for this, your honor, is that the word­
ing of Section 1388, the Attorneys Fees Awards Act, allows
the discretionary award of attorney’s fees in order to
enforce a provision of Section 1983.

So without a violation

of Section 1983, in this case, you would not have attorney's
fees that could be awarded to Respondents.
The Supreme Judicial Court of Maine concluded that
a right exists to sue under 42 USC 1983 in a state court;
that a similar right also exists to enforce the provisions of
the Social Security Act, even though the claim is not of
constitutional dimension; and that an award of attorney's
fees for violation of the Social Security Act may be consid­
ered .
A dispute over the computation of welfare benefits
without a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, or any vio­
lation of Civil Rights, was not in the Petitioner's mind
within the realm of foreseeability or within the intent of
the legislators, drafters, and enactors of the predecessors

7
of Section 1983? to wit, the Civil Rights Act of 1871, which
was also known as the Ku Klux Klan Act.
The historical background, and this Court is well
aware of this, of the times when the 1871 Act was enacted
during Reconstruction days, depicted a very sordid time in
the history of this country? almost all rights that Blacks
were to have enjoyed under the Fourteenth Amendment were not
available to them.

There were burnings? there were pil­

lages? there were no rights of property that Negroes could
enjoy.

This Court has recognised that.
However, in response thereto, Congress passed the

Civil Rights Acts of 1866, the Fourteenth Amendment, as well
as the Civil Rights Act of 1871, the Ku Klux Klan Act.
As this Court has said in Chapman v Houston Weifare Rights Organisation, in cases of statutory construc­
tion, our task is to interpret the words of those statutes
in light, of the purposes Congress sought to serve.

It is

the State's contention that the purposes of the Ku Klux Klan
Act, the predecessor of Section 1983, were to provide
enforcement of the Fourteenth Amendment.
not. at issue today.

That Amendment is:

There has been no due process viola­

tions or allegations thereof? there have been no equal pro­
tection violations or allegations thereof.
Another purpose of Section 1871 was to counteract
X'iolations of basic liberties.

They are not at stake in

this case or at issue.

Another purpose of the Act of 1871

was to provide a remedy when a state law existed in theory,
but was unavailable in practice.

Here, in contrast, we have

a state law that was available in practice? it was available
in reality? and indeed, the state lax? without Section 1983,
afforded the Respondents the rights to appeal under the Fair
Hearing Provisions and also to have the state's regulation
overturned.
QUESTION:

Is Barney v. New York on your side on

that point?
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

Excuse me, sir.
Do you have any case other than Barney

v. New York — which has been thrown out so many times — on
your side?
What case says that?
MR. SMITHS
QUESTION:

Says what, sir?

I didn't understand you.

When a state has laws that are the same

as federal lav/s, the federal laws don't apply .
MR, SMITH:
QUESTION:

If we’re getting into jurisdiction, sir?
No.

I am getting into what you're

talking about.
Didn’t you say that the State of Maine provides
all these things? therefore, you can't use 1983.
Now, I'm asking you:
anything close to that?

what case of this

Court says

9
MR. SMITH:

OK.

I'm not aware of any cases of

this Court that say that., your honor; however, I am reserv­
ing as a third argument the jurisdictional aspect of state
courts of 1983.
What I am trying to say to this Court is that
vrithout 1983, the Respondents had appropriate remedies in &
state court pursuant to state laws.
QUESTION:

Would they have been able to receive

fees there?
You can respond to chat at 1:00 o'clock.

You can

think it over in the meantime.
MR. SMITH:

Thank you, sir.

(Whereupon, at 12:CO o’clock, noon, the argument
was recessed, to reconvene at Is00 o’clock, p.m., the same
day»)
AFTERNOON SESSION
(1:00 p.m.)
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Smith, you may con­

tinue.
MR. SMITH:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

And may

it please the Court.
Shortly before the lunch break, Mr. Chief Justice
Burger posed the question as to whether or not, in the
absence of a Section 1988 authorization for attorney's fees
in the present matter, the Respondents would be able to

collect attorney's fees, if they prevail.
The answer to that question i.s:

no.

There is no

provision in the State of Maine under that situation as we
had before the authorisation in the award of attorney's
fees?

however, we would say that this certainly does not

place the Respondents necessarily in a different category
from other persons in this country who are serving or seek­
ing to obtain legal services.

Also there is the pro bono

aspect of legal work? and finally, there is the Legal Aid
Societies which have been in effect for several years in
this country.
Your Petitioner was stating that the purposes of
the Civil Rights Act, as shown by the enactors and legislat­
ors pursuant to its predecessor, the Civil Rights Act of
1871, was basically to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment pro­
visions and other rights? and to prevent further trampling
of those rights by the Ku Klux Flan.
QUESTION:

Were the words %

and laws, in the orig­

inal of tha statute?
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:
MR. SMITI-I:

No, sir.

They were not.

When did they coma in?
They came in in 1874 pursuant to the

revised draft.
QUESTION:
posed to cover?

Now, what do you suppose

they were sup­

11
MR. SMITE;

The Petitioner claims,

your honor,

that the "and-laws" provision was to relate to the Act of
1066? the laws contained therein, as well as the Fourteenth
Amendment provisions:

equal rights, civil rights? but not

the Social Security Act without a violation of seme due-process, equal-protection discrianinatory action.
QUESTION:

Well, specifically, to what kind of

laws do you suggest the statute was limited?
MR. SMITH;
QUESTION:
it?

Well, if I may give an example -—
I mean, is there a label you can give

Civil Rights Laws or something like that?
MR. SMITH:

Civil rights lav/s? equal rights laws.

Where one starts and the other stops, I’m not sure myself.
QUESTION:

But one of those words, those modifiers

are in the statute, as —
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

They are not.
— of today?

MR. SMITH:

No, sir.

The statute says:

and laws;

however, as this Court is well aware, it has been interpret­
ed by concurring opinions in the Chapman decision to encom­
pass equal rights, as it has also been interpreted in a con­
curring opinion not to.
QUESTION:

Has that been a suggested limitation

upon the kinds of law?

Two or three members of the Court in

the Chapman case, in a separate opinion, expressed the pretty
unambiguous view that the "laws" meant what it said.
4-rtr y *T5

Didn't

MR. SMITH:
QUESTION!

Yes, sir.
And. specifically, that they included

the Social Security Act?
MR* SMITH:

Just as three members stated the oppo­

site ■—
QUESTION;

Yes.

Although the Chapman case involv­

ed not 1983 directly, but 1343,
MR. SMITH;

Yes, sir.

Didn’t it?
The jurisdictional aspect.

Here, again, we don’t have problems with the
Respondents obtaining what relief they’re seeking, in the
absence of 1983.
QUESTION!
MR, SMITH:
QUESTION:

Right.
The Petitioner also asserts -Without 1983, there’s no authority for

counsel fee awards?
MR. SMITH:

For counsel fees.

No, sir.

As far as the relief which Respondents sought and
received, .1983 was superfluous,
QUESTION:

But if "laws" in 1983? if we should

construe that to mean just what it says;

laws; and

specif­

ically, Social Security Laws, then I gather there's a basis
for the 1988 counsel fee laws?
MR, SMITH:
QUESTION:
decide in this case.
MR. SMITH:

Yes, no doubt about, it.
And that's really what we have to
Isn't it?
That’s correct, your honor.

The State would a loo refer to the majority opinion
in Chapman and state that:

one purpose again of the Con­

gress in the Act of 1871 was to ensure right of action, to
enforce -the protections of the Fourteenth Amendment and the
federal laws enacted pursuant thereto*

And it is Petition­

ers firm assertion that the Social Security Act was- not a law
that was enacted pursuant to the Civil Rights Act.
In fact, taking into consideration the passions
and events of the time, the Reconstruction day era, your
Petitioners find it difficult to believe the legislators,
drafters, or revisers could have contemplated a good faith
error in computation of welfare benefits to be a violation
of civil rights or the Constitution and "laws" as they knew
them at that time.
QUESTION':
at that time*

There were no Social Security benefits

Were there?

MR. SMITH:

That5s correct, your honor.

If there had been find if people had been deprived
of benefits pursuant to a discriminatory action because of
their race or ethnic background, such, we*d say it would
apply? but not under the facts in this ease.
QUESTION:

There certainly were Social Security

benefits at the time the civil rights attorney's fees Act
was enacted in 576.
MR. SMITH:

Yes, sir

14
However, it’s the State's contention that Section
1988 would not apply to the violations in this case before
the bar, before the banc..
This is predicated upon two main assertions.
The first is that the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees
Awards Act liras based upon Fourteenth Amendment violations.
The second is predicated upon the lack of

specific statutory

authorisation, as we believe was mandated by the Alyeska
Pipeline decision.
Now, in Hutto v Finney, this Court awarded attor­
ney's fees; but they awarded attorney's fees pursuant to
violations of both the Eighth and the Fourteenth Amendment,
neither of which are at issue herein.
In FitzPatrick, we had a discrimination claim.

We

do not have any discrimination in this case.
Since 1866, Congress has seen fit to enact over 50
statutes is provide for attorney's fees, but they have not
dona so regarding the Social Security Act, except in limit­
ed areas.

One of those areas was Section 406(b)(1) which,

I believe was amended in 1966, 1958, and dealt with disabil­
ity claims.

Had Congress seen fit to specifically authorize

the award of attorney’s fees for a good faith violation in
computing of benefits, it is Petitioners' assertion that
they surely would have done so, and made it more plain than
is made in the ambiguous history of that Act as going

15
through the record as well as through the debates.
Once more, the wording of the Act is, that in the
discretion of the Court, if a party prevails on the Civil
Rights 1983 among other Civil Rights claims, and if it is

a

proceeding or action to enforce a provision of Section 1933,
attorney's fees would be proper.

Once again, this was not

an action to enforce a provision of 1983, as Petitioners
assert.
Respondents have argued that the plain meaning
theory would prevent any research into the history
tion 1983 prior to the revised statutes of 1979.

of Sec­
The State

would counter this by saying that throughout concurring
opinions and dissenting opinions in Chapman, we believe that
the Court has already gone beyond the revised statutes of
1874 and recognised that delving into the history
1874 .is indeed necessary.

prior to

There are other cases in which

the Cotirfc has also gone into the background of 1983 before
the revision of 1874? one of those cases was District of
Columbia v Carter, the other was Eraming Board v Otero da
Flores.
The Respondents have not considered Secticn 1983
in light of the events and passions of the times in which it
was enacted for this reason:

we believe that there are

arguments that the "and laws” provision applies? must be de­
nied .

Finally, the State, while reserving some time

16
for

rebuttal, would like to make brief mention of its third
argument having to do with exclusive jurisdiction.

The

State alleges that the State Court does not have authority
to hear a Section 1983 claim in a State Court.

This

was

brought to bear in the State Court of Maine; we brought it
forward for this Court for your disposition,
QUESTION;

What can you tell me from the Martinez

v. California case?
MR. SMITH:

I am not aware of that case, your

honor,
QUESTION;

It says specifically you could.

The State Court could.
MR. SMITE;

Excuse me.

I believe that an issue reserved in there was
whether or not the States must hear.
the State does not

In reading that case,

I guess the State would contest that,

it strictly and solely held that? and that it precluded this
argument.
Our argument is basically that if one were to look
at the specific words of the Act of 1871, we would find that
the District and Circuit Courts were given jurisdiction to
the exclusion of the State Courts; as well as the legisla­
tive history of the purposes of the Act, when State Courts
were indeed violating many of the civil rights which the
Acts of 1866 and 1871 were passed to enforce.

17
For these reasons , the State would ask this Court
to overturn the decision of the Maine Supreme Judicial Court
and specifically to state that the Social Security Act is
not within the provisions of Section 1983.
QUESTION:

Now what the Maine Supreme Court did is

to remand this case to the trial court.
MR. SMITH:
QUESTIONS

Didn't he?

He did,- sir, for the sole purpose of—
Exercising his jurisdiction, but upon

the hypothesis that 1988 was applicable.
MR. SMITE:
attorney's fees.

Yes

,

sir.

For determination of

The lower court did not state why they

denied attorney's fees.
QUESTION:

That was the purpose for remand.

But, so far as now appears the trial

court may still deny attorney's fees.
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

That's quite correct, sir,
As a matter of discretion,
As a matter of discretion.
The Supreme Court of Maine has said

that the authority is there.
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

Has it not?

Yes, sir,
In his opinion,

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.

Mr. Mittel.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT EDMOND MITTEL, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
.MR. MITTEL:

Mr. Chief Justice,

And may it please

18
the Court.
X have

two major points that I would like to

make on behalf of the Respondents.
QUESTIONS

Would you raise your voice a little,

Mr. Mittel?
MR. MITTEL:

I will.

The first of those major points is that over many
years, this Court has given all of the Civil Rights Statutes
a broad reading.
The second major point deals with the plain mean­
ing of Section 1933 as it now reads.
To turn first to what this Court has done in the
United States v Price and in Griffin v Breckenridge, it said
quite clearly that all of the Reconstruction Civil Rights
Statutes were to be read broadly and literally; and follow­
ing that instruction, this Court has over the last 12 years
reached a number of decisions in Section 1983, Social Secur­
ity Act cases.

And in each of those cases, there was before

this Court a claim for relief which had to turn on Section
1983,
Two of those cases bear particular note.

The

first is Rosado v Wyman; and the second is Edelman v Jor­
dan.

New Rosado is important because by the time that case

came to this Court, there was no constitutional claim of any
kind remaining in the case.

In fact, the constitutional

19
claim had dropped out several years previously in the Dis­
trict Court? and in fact, even prior to a remand, if that is
the proper word, from the three-judge court to Judge Wein­
stein.

This Court reached and decided.vthe .statutpry claim?

and the only possible cause of action that the Plaintiff in
that case could have asserted was based on Section 1983.
What had been done in Rosado was later specificalm.

ly recognised and accepted in Edelman? now be it

in dicta,

t

Edelman was of course about retroactive benefits.

But in

the course of that opinion, loth the majority and one of the
dissenting opinions specifically recognize what had happened
in Rosado and specifically stated-that the cause of action
that was before this Court v;as the statutory 1983 cause of
action.
The second point is that, as our brief points out,
this is a case for the application of the traditional pri­
mary rule of statutory construction.

One looks to the plain

meaning of the statute and applies it unless there is some
very clear and convincing reason initially on the face of
the statute to not do so? and in this case, looking at this
statute, there is no ambiguity on its face of any kind that
permits the insertion of modifying or limiting words.
I should point out here that there are, of course,
a range of cases involving federal statutes where Section
1983 actions cannot be brought.

20

First and foremost, there must foe defendants who
are acting under color of state law.
Second Congress can, either expressly or implied™
ly, preclude federal courts from entertaining Section
1983 statutory causes of action.

We discuss that

point in

some more detail in footnote 12 of our brief.
But once those two major exceptions fall by the
wayside,, we are then left with a very clear, very plain,
very unambiguous statute.
QUESTION:

Well, except there still remains, un­

less I’ve missed something you’ve said, one more issue, it
seems to me.
Even if you are correct that 1983 embraces claims
of violations of the Social Security Act, and even if you are
correct that such claims under 1983 can be brought in state
courts which have concurrent jurisdiction, there still
remains the question, does there not, of whether or not Sec­
tion 1988, which was enacted in response to the Alyeska
opinion in this Court which had to do only with the practice
of federal courts in awarding attorney’s fees, is applica­
ble at all to attorney’s fees; in state courts.
Even assuming that the first two questions are
answered:

yes; that you’re correct.
MR. MITTEL:
QUESTION:

The answer to - The 1983 action can be brought in a

state court; that a 1983 action embraces a violation of the»

21
Social Security Act; but nonetheless, the question remains:
does 1988 apply to the award of attorney’s fees to the pre~
vailing party in a state court, by contrast to the federal
court
MR. MITTEL:
honor, is;

The answer to that

question, your

yes.
QUESTION:
MR® MITTEL:
QUESTION:

That’s an issue though.

Isn't it?

It certainly is,
I mean, that's a remaining issue; even

if you're right on the first two,
MR. MITTEL:

That's correct.

That is one of the

questions that the Maine Supreme Judicial Court reached and
res olved unanimously»
QUESTION:
MR. MITTEL;
QUESTION:

I know that.

But the case is here now.

Oh, yes.
And that is one of the issues.

Is it

not?
MR. MITTEL:

No doubt.

And the way I would address that issue is by say­
ing several things.
First, again looking to the plain language of the
statute, it applies in all courts.
QUESTION:

But it is true as an historic matter of

fact, is it not, that the enactment of 1988 was in direct
response to this Court’s decision in the Alyeska case.
MR, MITTEL:

Oh, yes.

QUESTIONS

Then it's really true that the Alyeska

case had to do only with federal courts, is it not?
MR. MITTELs

Except for footnote 31, I believe

that’s correct,
QUESTION:
MR. MITTELs

And what did footnote 31 say?
Footnote 31 addressed the question of

whether or not a state attorney’s fee provision, statutory
or otherwise, was substantive? and would be applied by fed­
eral. court in a diversity action.
There is also —
QUESTION:
MR. M1TTEL:

But it’s a little bit different —Yes, I realise that.

But in terms of looking to whether the fees act
applies in state courts, one can, if one wishes then, look
beyond the plain meaning of the act itself; and look, here to
a very clear and very unambiguous legislative history.
QUESTION:

Let me get you back a moment, if I may,

to the first part of your answer in my Brother Stewart's
x on •
Your Supreme Judicial Court rejected in terms, did
it not, that attorney’s fees were recoverable under state
law for this kind of thing.

It said it had to be 1983 or

nothing, in Part I of its opinion, because the State of
Maine hadn’t waived its sovereign immunity.
MR. MITTELs

No question about that, your honor.

23

The history of this statute though is also plain;
and there are several indications which we've cited in our
brief, one speech by

Father Drinan,

who was here this

morning, indicating that the act was to apply in both state
and federal courts? and this court has held in Sullivan that
it does apply in state courts although that decision focused
on the first sentence of Section 1983 which has been in
place since the revised statutes were enacted in 1874»
«

It stands to reason though —
QUESTION:

The first sentence is the one that Bor­

rows from state law.
MR. MXTTEL:

Yes.

The long sentence explaining

what remedies are to be applied.
QUESTION:

The Sullivan opinion was rendered be­

fore the enactment of the present 1988.
MR. MIJPTEL:

Was it not?

That's correct.

Well, the present 1988 is nothing but an additional sentence attached to the original Act.
And the other reason though to look to applying
the second sentence, the fees act, if you will, in state
court, is that in many states, Maine being one, it’s a long,
long way to the federal court.

For people in the northern

part of the State — if people are to retain counsel of
their choosing and to bring cases in a straightforward sta­
tutory fashion, they should be able to do that in state

24
court.

They should not have to if they don't want to, go to

federal court.
And while we believe that in this case a constitu­
tional claim may very well have been made and may very well
have passed the Hagans test, there seemed no reason to do
that.
QUESTIONS

Of course, we've rejected the same ar­

gument when made from an opposite side in the sense that you
must have counsel for a person charged with a misdemeanor
who may get a prison sentence in a very large state where
there may be 12 or 14 counties and it would be a very

great

burden on the state to supply counsel or a magistrate or
that sort of thing.

We've said:

that doesn't make any dif­

ference; that if the right is there, it’s there.
And I would think that by inverse logic, the same
is true here.
MR. MITTEL:

The problem, I suppose, in terms of

focusing on the right is that in Chapman, this Court has
indicated that the Federal District Court may not have jur­
isdiction over many of these cases; and the only point, I’m
trying to make is that rather than in some cases go without
and in other cases strain to resolve the problem that one is
left with after Chapman and with Hagans, why not just turn
to the Superior Court;
QUESTION;

In some of the Par Western States,

23
thinly populated, the prosecution’s option is frequently to
just go without in prosecuting a misdemeanor case where they
might want a prison term of 6 months or one month or vrtiatever it may be? simply because there are just not enough
resources there.
MR, MITTEL:
QUESTION:

I understand that.
Mr. Mitte1, you mentioned in some of

these cases, there*d be no federal jurisdiction.

I take it

there'd be no federal jurisdiction in this case.

This very

case.
MR. MITTEL:

Well, if we had filed the complaint,

as we have it here, there certainly would, not be.

What I

suggested —*
QUESTION:

You suggested you might have drafted a

constitutional claim of some kind.
MR. MITTEL:
QUESTION:

No question,
But, no [Inaudible,] restriction to

this appeal?
MR. MITTEL:
QUESTION:
MR. MITTEL:
QUESTION:

This was a certiorari petition.
And we granted certiorari?
Yes, sir.
This clearly isn't a final judgment.

Is it?
MR, MITTEL:
certain.
s

Well, let me say this:

we are not

We think it is, and I can tell you why.
QUESTION:

Attorney's fees may or may not be

26
awarded.

We don’t know.
MR. MITTEL:

If you look at the Act and you look

at the history of the Act and you look at the way it has
been interpreted by a number of Circuit Courts, you see that
while indeed the language of the Supreme Judicial Court
leaves open, quote/unquote,, the discretion of the Superior
Court, I do not see how that Court could exercise its dis­
cretion in any fashion, other than attorney’s fees.
QUESTION:

Well, you don’t see how; but other peo­

ple might,
MR. MITTEL:

Well, I understand that.

But secondly, this case is not unlike any other
case where, after the judgment here, there will be, seeing
things my way for a moment, nothing left to do but to award
costs„
QUESTION:

Well, if the trial judge does on remand

award costs, the State might bring the question, depending
on how we deal with it here; might bring the underlying
question back hers.
MR. MITTEL:
state law they can.

They might.

I'm not sure that under

That's one of the exceptions to the

final judgment rule which is somewhat riddled with excep­
tions that this Court talks about in Cox Broadcasting v
Cohen.
There’s a Maine case that may raise some doubts as

27
to the ability to do that.
QUESTIONS

The rule is they’re all exceptions now.»

isn’t it?
MR. MITTEL:

Just about.

I mean, as I read Cox

Broadcasting and especially footnote 7, I’m not sure I want
to say it's left to the unreviewable discretion of this
Court; but it is.

And there seems to be no real hard, fast

rule in any direction.
There's another point that I think that 1 might
make about the statute, and the fees act in particular; and
that is;

contrary to the assertion that the State is making

somewhat silently, the fees act was enacted not to benefit
attorneys, but to benefit the people? and to enable them to
obtain counsel and to be able to litigate their valid
claims.

And. that without the fees act, many, many cases

involving many, many justifiable claims, will go unremedied.
And that is the purpose of the Act.

That’s what

both the Senate and the House Reports say, and that is
what’s made clear in the floor debates.
QUESTION:

Of course, every law is always enacted

in the public interest in the view of Congress that enacts
it»

Isn't it.
MR. MITTEL:

I think that could be stated with

some certainty,
QUESTION:
asked.

I'm sure Congress would so state, if

28

MR* MITTEL:
QUESTION;

Yes*

No question about it.

And often when unasked*

MR. MITTEL:

Probably.

If the Court has no further questions then, the
Respondents would only ask that the judgment of the Maine
Supreme Judicial Court be affirmed.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Very well, Mr. Mittel.

Do

you have anything further, Mr. Smith:
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES EASTMAN SMITH, ESQ*,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. SMITH;

Very briefly, sir.

May it please the

Court.
Going to Mr. Justice Stewart's question about the
finality of the decision, we would just state that the lan­
guage of Section 1988:

in any action or proceeding to

enforce a provision of sections, among them 1983.

When the

Maine Judicial Supreme Court made that determination on
remand that this issue is going to be considered and that
the Civil Rights Attorney’s Fees Awards Act is applicable in
the State action that we believe that the finality to the
present action, which was why we brought oux writ at the
time that we did,
QUESTION:

Well, I5m not critical of you for fil­

ing a petition, after all, we granted it.

But it just

23
occurred to me that this isn't final; that attorney’s fees
may never be allowed.
MR. SMITHS

As far as the 1983 question goes

though, we believe it to be final.
CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

And

the case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 1:28 o'clock, p.m., the Argument
was concluded.)
