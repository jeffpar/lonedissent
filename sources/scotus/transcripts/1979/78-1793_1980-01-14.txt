on behalf of the Petitioner

3
PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first this morning in 78-1793s Roberts v. United States.
Mr. Palmer, I think you may proceed whenever you
are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLAN M. PALMER, ESQ.,
ON'.BEHALF
MR. PALMER:

OF THE PETITIONER

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Perhaps the most important transcript aside from
the sentencing one that Is relevant to disposition of this
case did not become available until after the brief and the
appendix of petitioners were filed.

The Court of Appeals

for the D.C. Circuit sends it over here on December 5th
and the briefs were filed on November 15th, as I recall.
Mow, the transcript we refer to is a ^0-page
transcript concerning a so-called Miranda hearing held in
the District Court and that transcript indicates that there
was a wiretap in the District and during the course of it
someone named Win was overheard.
QUESTION:

And this is an argument that isn’t

in the briefs?
MR. PALMER:

Oh, it is in the briefs, Your Honor,

because although the full transcript was not available we
in fact summarized the gist of it from other source material„

QUESTION:

All right.

MR. PALMER:

Thank you.

Win was heal’d on a wiretap and then

a green Jaguar he was alleged to deliver $50 or $100 worth
of drugs in was observed at the situs of the tap.

The

young lady who owned the car was summoned in, subpoenaed
to the U.S. Attorney’s office.

At this point there was no

indictments or criminal charges pending.
who drives the car.

She was asked

She said the only other person that

drives it is her male friend, Winfield Roberts and he is
right outside the door.
Impressed with their good fortune, the District
Attorney and the police officers there invited him in to
discuss the matter.

And as the District Attorney, Mr.

McSorley, said, as soon as ,he walked in the door, the
defendant or potential defendant — he was not a
defendant at that time

was read his Miranda rights

pursuant to the PD~^7„ which is a compilation of those
rights, except the one that indicated that he was under
arrest because clearly he was not.

He was advised that

lie had the right to remain silent, anything he said
might be used against him.
QUESTION:

Do you make any point of impropriety

in giving him the Miranda warning too soon rather than
too late?
MR. PALMER:

No, sir.

He did it out of an

5
abundance of caution, so to speak.
QUESTION:

I see.

MR. PALMER:

And he was told that» if you want

to answer any questions now with a lawyer present, you
have the right to stop answering at any time, you also
have the right to stop answering at any time until you
talk to a lawyer.

This is is the standard PD-47 warning.

Now, as the District Attorney testified at this
hearing at transcript 38, he said the petitioner fully
understood his rights and the trial court agreed.

Now,

initially the petitioner was vague about any involvement
in the case ,until an actual tape of his voice was played
indicating "Win,” his own voice, the Jaguar, et cetera.
At that point he admitted what was on the tape to the
extent of on two occasions he delivered drugs worth .'»50
or $100 to this Charles "Boo" Thornton in a Jaguar.
At that point, the prosecutor pressed him and
said, well, where did you get the drugs from and, as the
testimony indicated, at that point, the police officer
testified at transcript 12, the petitioner gave an
evasive answer, he refused to tell us, the prosecutor
testified.

He clamped up and the conversation ended be­

cause he wouldn’t go any further than that.

He was

advised to come back in two or three days, think it over»
He did so and he said I can’t help you any more and he

6
left.
Wow, obviously the defendant who was not advised
by counsel at that point, was not under arrest, only ad­
mitted that which the government knew.

When he heard his

own voice on the tapes, two deliveries, he said yes, I
was involved in that»

As to any further involvement in a

conspiracy of the persons he may be involved with he relied
pursuant to his warning to remain silent, and indeed this
is the very consequence envisioned by this Court in the
Miranda opinion, where it indicated that if the individual
indicates in any manner at any time prior to or during
questioning that he wants to rely on the warnings, rights,
at this point he has shown that .he intends to exercise his
Fifth Amendment privilege.

This is precisely what this

petitioner did.
He was then indicted, arrested and indicted»
He was arrested about a month later and indicted about two
months after- that»

Here again, after the indictment, on

three or four occasions — now there is a transcript, a
remand transcript of 28 January 577 that was sent to this
Court also on December 5th which is alluded to in the
government’s brief.
On three or four occasions, personally the
prosecutor spoke to his attorney for cooperation.

He

x^anted his cooperation to testify in open court against

7
the codefendant and to identify the other people he was in­
volved with, places, locations, the full conspiracy, so to
speak.

And as the prosecutor testified at the remand hear­

ing, ’’This was rejected out of hand.

There was never any

indication that Mr. Roberts would assist us."

And indeed

throughout the course of this three-year litigation, Mr.
Roberts, the petitioner consistently relied on his right
to remain silent until at the sentencing hearing the
prosecutor urged this non-cooperation as a basis for in­
creasing the penalty or as a. sentencing aggravating
factor, and the court relying thereon and enunciated this
as one of the reasons for the consecutive setenee, at that
point Mr. Roberts, the petitioner was penalized for relying
on his Fifth Amendment rights which, the government concedes
at brief 37, it could not do, the court that is could not
penalize him.
Now, the government in its brief argues a waiver
theory, that this was never actually urged by petitioner
during the course of the three years or the sentencing
hearing.

He says, at page 35 of the brief, "Petitioner

or his counsel never said that non-cooperation was based
on constitutional rights and immunity was never sought
by petitioner or his counsel."

And it further goes on to

say at point two that at no time during the sentencing
hearing did in fact counsel allude to Fifth Amendment

8
rights o
Now, these are important considerations and we
are going to answer them fully, as we have in tbe brief, we
^believe.
Insofar as the three-year —
QUESTION:

Is it true, Mr. Palmer, that there was

a colloquy at least before the trial when defense counsel
agreed to withdraw their motion to recuse Judge Pratt if
he would agree to concurrent sentences?
MR. PALMER:

We filed a memorandum.

viously filed a memorandum.

We pre­

There was a mandamus petition

we served to the judge, we would ask you to recuse yourself
because under the Gregg opinion of this Court you have
already sentenced the man, you have read the presentence
report, out of an abundance of caution to preserve the
issue of fairness, the appearance of fairness, we think
the court should recuse itself.

In fact, if the court

does recuse itself — well, it didn't recuse itself, but
if it did not recuse itself, if it gave concurrent sen­
tences we would withdraw that claim, that is true, in the
footnote.

We did indicate that upon consent and advice

of the defendant.
Now, in many cases petitioners are asked to
cooperate.

It happens all the time in district courts.

And it is understood by all experienced counsel, defense

9
counsel that if the man says no, obviously he is i’e3.ying on
Fifth Amendment rights.

He does not have to confess, say

anything to the government at all.

And indeed in this

case, the petitioner was not brought into court during the
three-year period and say, well, why have you not confessed,
laid out the scheme for the benefit of the prosecutor.

It

was understood by the prosecutor and defense counsel that
by not cooperating the defendant simply relied on his right
to remain silent as he had throughout the proceedings.
So when the government says that the defense
never came forward during these three years and said, well,
we were relying on the Fifth Amendment as such or he never
asked for cooperation, that argument is — the brief in
that regard is long in argument and short in experience
because it is generally understood that there is no right
for the government to compel this incriminating statement
from the defendant.
Furthermore, we are not familiar with any in­
stance where the general practice where the defendant says
I would like immunity, prosecution, please give us im­
munity.

The government knows what to do.

If it wants to,

it could put the man before the grand jury; if he claimed
his Fifth Amendment right, then give him immunity«
not up to the defendant to ask for it.

It- is

It is up to the

prosecution to confer it if it deems fit.

10

Now, at the time of the sentencing or prior there­
to, from day one-, 13 June '75, when the defendant walked
into the prosecutor's office, through the morning of the
sentencing hearing, not one time in writing or otherwise
did the government ever urge non-cooperation as a sentencing
factor for aggravation or as any factor at all.
QUESTION:

Do you think cooperation eou.ld be used

and is it sometimes argued as a reason for moderating a
sentence?
MR. PALMER:
QUESTION:

Of course, it happens all the time.
Then it is just a one-way street in

your view?
MR0 PALMER:

On these facts, it is a one-way

street in the sense that the man is consciously giving un
the right to self-incrimination if he cooperates.

In a

narcotics case especially there is a danger to one's safety,
there is a danger to one’s life, his family, and he con­
sciously gives up these factors, these rights, the right
to silence, the right not to endanger himself or his family.
And for that reason, when a man cooperates he does so
voluntarily, fine.
that.

Courts have indeed p^iven benefit to

But the converse is not true, because if he doesn't

cooperate there are many valid reasons, such as in this
case, his reliance on the right of self-incrimination, why
he did not cooperate.

In fact, Judge Lombard, in

il
considering the issue in the Ramos and DiGiovanni case, a
most experienced federal appellate judge, has indicated
that it is a one-way street in that regard, that is quite
true, Your Honor.
Now, in its first allocution after the first
sentence, the government in discussing the confession, the
statement the defendant made, indicated that he did not
cooperate with the government in an historical sense, just
laying out the facts, did no say suggest or intimate that
that was the reason for the court to take into account on
sentence.

In fact, it was not urged at allocution and it

xtfas not urged by the court in sentencing.
Now, we came to the second sentence that is now
before us, here again the government wrote a written allo­
cution and never once did it ever suggest, intimate or any­
thing else say that lack of cooperation is a sentencing
factor.

It never said it.
QUESTION:

Well, are the prosecutors supposed

in the District of Columbia Circuit, do the prosecutors
get into the act with recommendations?
MR. PALMER:

Well, Your Honor, it is interesting»

Prior to 1970 or '71, prosecutors never recommended sen­
tences.

It Is only a recent occurrence, having started in

about '70 or f71, this report — for example, I was there
prosecuting cases up until '60, the government stood mute

12
at every sentencing and never said a. word.

It is a recent

innovation, so to speak.
QUESTION:
MR. PALMER:

It occurs around the country.
Ye3.

I remember I once served as

a student in the Second Circuit a long time ago, many years
ago, and it was fully allocuted,

I remember the prosecutors

allocuted there.
QUESTION:

Mr. Palmer, do you think it would be

permissible for a district judge to have a policy that when
he takes a plea that he tells the defendant that he in his
own sentencing practice, if the defendant cooperates he
will probably get one year, if he does not cooperate he
will probably get two years, assuming it fits the normal
pattern of a certain kind of offense?
MR. PALMER:

I don't believe so, because it is

forcing the defendant to give up Fifth Amendment rights
which still adhere after the plea, as in this case, for
example.
QUESTION:

But you did acknowledge, if I under­

stood your responses to the Chief Justice, that the judge
could have such a policy, that if the man cooperates he
will only sentence him a year instead of an otherwise
appropriate sentence of two?
MR. PALMER:

I think he could so sentence the man

if he cooperates, but I don't think the judge can get

13
Involved in that decision insofar as the defendant is con»
cerned.

I think if the judge gets involved with it3 he is

coercing the man to give up his Fifth Amendment rights.
That is where the danger lies.
QUESTION:

Supposing he had ten very similar

cases and in the first one the man cooperates, he says I'm
only giving you one year because you cooperated, the next
man he gives two years, he didn't cooperate, he says nothing
about it, but he establishes a pattern by what he actually
did, so the lawyer now knows based on a series of cases
that if his client cooperated he will get one year and if
he doesn’t cooperate he will probably get two.

I take it

the lawyer could tell the defendant.
MR. PALMER;

That’s a fact of life in the trial

courts all the time, that’s true»
QUESTION:

But it is a fact of life that the

judge cannot tell the defendant.
MR. PALMER:

I think at that point he is coercing

the defendant to give up his Fifth Amendment rights which
he can’t do, and I am going to get into that a little
further in even broader detail, if the Court will.
Now, the government erroneously suggests that the
reason why the government urged this lack of cooperation in
its brief, it indicates at page 8l4 and 84l of its brief
that what the government was really responding to

petitioner counsel's argument to the effect that the courts
should consider his cooperation or limited statement as to
involvement as a mitigating factor and the government re­
sponded tit-for-tat, so to speak.

At brief 8 of its brief,

the government says, in addition, prosecutor responded to
defense counsel’s remarks about the extent of petitioner's
cooperation with the government.
We never alluded to his cooperation as such as
a mitigating factor.

What we did, when you read the

sentencing transcript, is to allude to the facts of the
statement he gave to show that the case was not as large or
serious as urged by the government, because insofar as the
facts were concerned in the statement the defendant gave,
he said that on two or three occasions he delivered drugs
worth $50 or $100 for Mr. Charles Thorton’s own personal
use.

And indeed when the search warrants were executed,

six of them, found in Thornton’s house were bottle-top
cookers and syringes, indicia of personal use.
Furthermore, we urge that Thornton, a previously
convicted narcotic felon, who pleaded to gambling and
narfotic law violations, was sentenced to probation by
another federal judge in the very same ease in which this
petitioner was charged.
QUESTION:
were suggesting -

So —

If it wasn’t a very big deal, as you

15

MR0 PALMER:
QUESTION:

Mo, sir.
doesn’t that undercut your argument

or his argument, I should say, that he was liable to be
murdered and liquidated if he cooperated with the prosecu­
tion?
MR, PALMER:
referring to?

Well, whose argument is Your Honor

I don’t —

QUESTION:

Well, I thought you were telling us

that this wasn’t a very big narcotics operation.
MR. PALMER:

It was not very big Insofar as

this petitioner was concerned, as we saw it»

Notwith-;

standing that fact, someone gave him the drugs who was a
person in more of a distribution type of role to that
person, whether you call It a small amount distributed or
not, the individuals who supplied from above are very
concerned about their liability and the danger comes from
them, I would think, as the case would Indicate.,

In a-nY

event —
QUESTION:

Do you think the judge in those

circumstances is not entitled to take into account the
damage that the use of drugs does to a great many people,
that drug peddlers should be put away for quite a while?
MR. PALMER:

Of course, the judge can take that

Into account.
QUESTION:

I thought that is what he did here.

16
MR. PALMER:
factors. Your Honor.

Well* he took into account several
Mow, if this judge never talked about

cooperation, he never alluded to it, possibly the sentence
he gave might have been a viable one.

The fact is that,

theory aside, he specifically alluded to lack of cooperation
as a sentencing factor, and I am going to now refer to that
more specifically„
Now, the real reason the government alluded to
non-cooperation was this:

We urged in writing and orally

that when you have pleas or verdicts concerning two phone
counts, two so-called phone counts —- now, there are about
16 judges in the District Court here who are active and
hear criminal eases.

No judge in the District of Columbia

has ever given consecutive sentences for two or more
telephone counts.
QUESTION:

Mr. Palmer, a moment ago you said

that if the judge had not alluded to the absence of cooper­
ation, the sentence he gave might have been a viable one,
was the word used.
factors.

And then you mentioned sentencing

Is there some case from this Court that holds

absent a constitutionally statutory violation, a sentence
is to be reviewed by an appellate court on the basis of
sentencing factors the judge took into consideration?
MR» PALMER:
holds as we read it.

Well, the Grayson case itself so
In Grayson, the court said one of the

17
reasons may be impermissible that I am going to sentence
this man for, this

438 U.S., page 44.

And the court

said, Mr. Grayson, I*m going to sentence you to a prison
term because, one, to deter you and, two, it is my view
that your defense was a fabrication and doesn’t have the
slightest merit whatsoever,

and I feel it is proper for

me to mention the second factor because if it is an improper
factor, I want the Court of Appeals to know it so they can
reverse me.
Of course, the Court of Appeals did reverse him,
then it came to this Court which upheld that sentencing
factor.
QUESTION:

But that was the District Court’s view9

that sentencing factors could be taken into consideration
even though the sentence imposed was within the limits pre­
scribed by law.
MR. PALMER:

I think if the factor x«ras improper

or an impermissible one?, it is a basis upon which to reverse
the sentence.
QUESTION:

How do you know whether it is improper

or impermissible?
MR. PALMER:

Well, we look at it and if it strikes

us in the realm of human experience as an improper factor
that he shouldn’t consider, I think the reversal is required.
For example, if he had said, well, Mr. so-and-so, you are of

18
a particular ethnic group or you are of a particular race ~~
QUESTION:

Well, that would be a constitutional

claim, "would it not?
MR. PALMER:

It would indeed, and we think in

this sense the use of the Improper factor has always been
understood or has always been a basis upon which to at
least reverse the sentence even though it has been within
the proper —
QUESTION:

Do you define improper factor as being

a violation of some constitutional claim?
MR. PALMER:

In this case there was such a viola­

tion of constitutional claim, the Fifth Amendment.
QUESTION:

So that is what you mean when you say

Improper factor?
MR. PALMER:

Yes, sir, that was the critical or

most important faetor in this case, the violation of the
Fifth Amendment and the right to remain silent which was
penalised on the facts of this case.

That is true, that

is the outstanding reason.
Now, as we indicated, no federal judge before in
this jurisdiction has ever given consecutive sentences —
QUESTION:

Can't a federal district judge in this

district give consecutive sentences, despite what you said?

MR. PALMER:
QUESTION:

I'm not sure, it has never been —
What is to stop him from doing it?

I guess in those aggravating circum­

I am just looking at the facts of this case and

where there was a conspiracy and four overt acts.

Two of

the overt acts were also substantive counts, use of a
telephone.

Our point was under the rule of lenienty we

made an argument that the main count Is a lead conspiracy
count.

If pursuant to that you have 200 phone calls,

does that mean the man can get 80G years consecutively for
each of the phone and 15 years for the conspiracy?

MR. PALMER:

I don’t know about children.

were no children involved in this case, if it please the
Court.

MR. PALMER:

Hard facts make different circum­

stances, I would submit.

20
QUESTION:

Mr. Palmer, where do we get the —

where do we find fchi3 data that you mentioned on judges never
giving consecutive sentences?
MR. PALMER:
prior to sentencing.
QUESTION:

WE urged it in our statement of facts
The district attorney at sentencing —
I am talking about documenting it.

Where is that recorded?
MR» PALMER:

It was based on (a) my experience

over 17 years in the District Court, having conferred with
drug agents, et cetera, and the government conceded that at
the sentencing.

It was never controverted in the Court of

Appeals and indeed rot controverted her®.

In fact, the

prosecutor said that in asking for consecutive sentences,
at appendix 3*» and 35, we realise we are going against
custom and practice in this courthouse and I would like to
explain why we are doing so, as not to appear as a Simon
Lagree,

And then he launched for three pages into the

argument that this lack of cooperation should move the
District Court to do what no other1 District Court had ever
done before, that is impose consecutive sentences for the
two telephone counts.
Now, after he alloeuted, the court turned to us
and said do you want to make a response, Mr. Palmer.

And

remember, at this point the issue had not been joined,
because the government had never until that moment urged

21
this as a sentencing factor, and for a brief paragraph we
— when you are dealing with allocation, you are trying to
dissuade somebody, it is not a legal argument, and we said
to the court, well, apparently in this situation the co­
defendant Thornton got probation, this defendant is before
the court, he hasn’t cooperated, the government is obviously
mad at him, let's give him the time we can, as much as we
can while we’ve got him before us5 and then I went on to
another matter.

And in these circumstances we don’t think

we can be faulted for not raising the issue, having —- we
never thought about the issue, the implications of the
right to remain silent, the Miranda warnings, et cetera.
The Courts of Appeal are divided on the issue and in fact
that is why we are here today.

So we can’t be faulted for

not raising it at that time, and indeed the issue only came
into the case when the judge in imposing sentence said that
is one of the factors I am relying upon.

After that, the

case went on appeal and we researched the law and presented
it to the Court of Appeals and the case ultimately wound
its way here.
Now, since the record belov* was silent in effect
as to the reasons for the lack of cooperation, other than
this Fifth Amendment issue which is clearly there, it was
impermissible for the court to penalize for lack of
cooperation when lack of cooperation could just as easily

22
have been, as Judge Lombard said in his opinions, from fear
of harm, danger to himself or his family, or other like
reasons.

In other words, there is no reason to say that

failure to cooperate on these facts was because the man was
not amenable to rehabilitation.
Now, there is a further consideration here and
that is the fact that in. this case the prosecutor urged
consecutive penalties because petitioner failed to cooperate
over the entire course of the case.

At appendix 36, he said,

throughout the long process that has occurred, from June of
1975 when he first came into ray office up until today, he
still has refused to cooperate.
Now, at the stage where the defendant was in the
prosecutor's office and ho refused to cooperate, the
defendant was then penalised in part because at that point,
unrepresented by counsel, he didn't confess everything the
government wanted to know, indicated where he got the drugs
from and things of that nature, and we think that is clearly
imp e rmissible.
Secondly, between the indictment and the plea, as
we understand it, the defendant has pleaded, not guilty, he
has no duty to confess, cooperate with the government, his
Fifth Amendment rights have not been waived in any shape or
form, and yet the defendant was penalized in this ease
during this phase also because he never came and said,

23
prosecutor, I want to lay my soul bare to you.

I think

that is impermissible.
And in line with the questions Justice Stevens
asked, for example, under Grayson we think a judge could
probably say to a defendant, you are going to testify, the
Supreme Court has said if you do and do so falsely and you
are qonvieted, I am going to take that into account when I
impose sentence.

But we don’t think that prioi’ to disposi­

tion of the ease the defendant can be brought into the court
room and the judge say to him, now, Mr. Defendant, you know,
I’ve heard you haven’t cooperated in here, the government
wants you to testify against your codefendant, you haven’t
done that, you haven’t indicated whom you got the drugs
from, and I think that is something that should be done and
if you don’t do it, if you are convicted, when the sentencing
comes about I’m going to penalise you»

I think that is

totally impermissible, coercive, collides with the funda­
mental rights of a defendant in a criminal case.
For these reasons, we think the sentencing in this
case, on these facts is improper.

J. have about five minutes

to go and I would like to reserve those for rebuttal.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

I think we won't ask you to take two minutes
today and the rest tomorrow.
