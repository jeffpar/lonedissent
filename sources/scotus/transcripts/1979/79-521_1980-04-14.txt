MR0 BUSCEMI:

Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
This case concerns the relationship Act and Section
6(b)(1) of the Consumer Product Safety Act.
The case is here because two Federal Courts of
Appeals have disagreed over the way in which the two statutes
should be applied.
The Second Circuit in Pierce

&

Stevens Chemical

Corporation v. United States Consumer Products Safety
Commission adopted the Commission's view that Section 6(b)(1)
does not apply when the Commission responds to an FOIA request.

18

Four months later in the present case the Third Circuit reached
19

a contrary result.
2©

The Commission petitioned for certiorari to resolve
21

the conflict.

And the facts here are straightforward.

In-

22

March of 1974 the Commission published a notice in the Federal
23
Register announcing the time and place of a public hearing
24
to discuss television receiver safety with emphasis on shock an
25

4

fire hazards.

The notice asked manufacturers to submit a

variety of information concerning television safety including
all TV-related accident reports collected since 1969.
When the manufacturers' response to this informal
request proved unsatisfactory the Commission sought to obtain
the same materials through the special order and subpoena
procedures provided in Section 27(b) of the Consumer Products
Safety Act.
Eventually television manufacturers submitted a
large volume of information to the Commission, the vast
majority of which consisted of TV accident data.

And the

Commission received more than 7,600 TV-related accident
reports concerning accidents occurring between 1969 and 1974.
And soon after the manufacturers began to submit
the requested materials Consumers Union of the United States
and Public Citizens Health Research Group filed FOIA requests
to inspect and copy the information submitted., including the
TV accident reports.
In response to those requests the Commission made
available all the material submitted by the manufacturers as
to which no claim of confidentiality had been made.

The

Commission then notified the manufacturers of the outstanding
FOIA requests and asked them to substantiate the earliers
claims of confidentiality that they had made at the time they
submitted the information.

5

I

The manufacturers responded by asserting that the

1

accident reports and some of the materials were exempt from

3

mandatory disclosure under the FOIA under Exemption 4, so-

4

called trade secret exemption; and Exemption 7, the exemption

5

for investigatory files compiled for law enforcement purposes:,

j

S
©

They also asserted that some of the material, including some

7

of the material within the accident reports could not be

©

released because to release it would be to violate the

i

criminal provisions of the Trade Secrets Act, 18 D.S.C, 1905.

io

The Commission then reviewed the accident reports

1!

and the manufacturers' submissions on confidentiality and

12

determined that the bulk of the material was not exempt from

13

mandatory disclosure under the FOIA.

54

The Commission notified the manufacturers of its

5

18

determination and told them they would withhold three categories:

16

of information.

17

address of an accident victim or included other personal

18

Accident data that identified the name and

information, the release of which might result in invasion
of privacy, accident data in the form of legal material such
as legal memoranda and correspondence with an attorney
privilege because of the attorney-client relationship or the
attorney-work product doctrine and finally technical data
that the submitting company had kept secrets and the release
of which might cause substantial harm to the company.
The Commission also informed the manufacturers that

because of the apparent variations in the way the manufacturers
had maintained their accident records over the years between
1969 and 1974 that the release of those records under the F01A
would be accompanied by a statement to the effect that because
of the variations some of the data could be misleading.

16
In addition to repeating their contentions regarding
1?

the FOIA exemptions in the Trade Secrets Act, respondents for
IB
the first time alleged that the Commission's proposed release
{

19

of the accident reports would violate Section 6(b)(1) of the
20
..

Consumer Products Safety Act.

The District Court accepted

21
this argument and permanently enjoined the Commission from
22
releasing the material without complying with the procedural
23

requirements of Section 6(b)(1).
24
The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed,

Now, because both courts have decided this case in

4

reliance on Section 6(b)(1), neither has ever addressed the

S

allegations by respondents that the accident reports are

6

axerapt from mandatory disclosure under the Freedom of

7

Information Act.
So the case comes to the Court in the posture that

disclosure is required under the FOIA, unless respondents are

product the Commission must follow four procedural rules.
The first one is that the Commission must notify the
affected manufacturer, it must provide him with a summary of
the information to be disclosed and it must afford him a

reasonable opportunity to comment on that information.
The second requirement is that the Commission must
take reasonable steps to assure the accuracy of the information
The third requirement is that the Commission must
take reasonable steps to insure that disclosure would be fairunder the circumstances and reasonably related to effectuating
the purposes of the Act.
And the fourth requirement is that if the Commission

12

13
14

discovers after a disclosure has been made that some of the
information disclosed is innacurate or misleading it must
publish a retraction "in a manner similar to that in which the

original disclosure was made."

Are you referring then, Mr. Buscemi, to

the language of 6(b)(1) itself or to the regulation?

Now, the Commission's position is that these four
20
requirements of Section 6(b)(1) do not apply whan the

Commission responds to an FOIA request.

Stated in a different

way, the Commission believes that Congress did not intend the

phrase "public disclosures of information" under Section
24

6(b)(1) to include releases of information in response to the
25

f

mandatory disclosure provisions of the FOIA.

Now, the first of the principal reasons or the set
of reasons that I want to discuss are the contrasting structure j
and purpose of the Consumer Products Safety Act on the one
hand and the Freedom of Information Act on the other.
Now, when Congress used the phrase "public disclosure
of information" in Section 6 of the Consumer Products Safety
Act it was referring to the sorts of affirmative disclosures
made at the Commission*s initiative and with the Commission's
endorsement that are mandated elsewhere in the Act.

The Act

taken as a whole makes clear and respondents have never
disputed that the primary function assigned to the Commission
by statute is the collection, analysis and dissemination of
consumer products safety information.
We have listed in our brief at pages 15 to 17 a number
of the Act's provisions that direct the Commission to make
public disclosures or to require such disclosures by others.
The most important example of those provisions is Section 5(a)(1

20

of the Act which directs the Commission to maintain an
21

injury information clearinghouse, to collect, investigate,
22

analyze and distribute injury data and information relating to
28
24
25

the causes of death, injury and illness associated with
consumer products.

11

The Commission is thus under a statutory obligation
to investigate possible safety hazards and to disclose the
results of its investigations even if no one asks for those
results And Section 6 of the Act follows immediately after
Section 5.

And the Commission believes that even the place­

ment of the two sections in the statute supports its view thet
the public disclosures of information to v/hich Section 6
refers are those undertaken by the Commission in the perform­
ance of its statutory duties-

This interpretation makes sense

in light of the purpose of the Consumer Products Safety Act,
which is to educate the public with, respect to product safety
hazards When the Commission make§ a public disclosure of
the kind described in the Act it wants and expects the
consuming public to trust the accuracy of the information
disclosed and to rely on it in making purchasing decisions
with respect to consumer products.
The protections required by 6(b)(1) fit perfectly
in this context.

Indeed, the statute was designed specifically

to protect against the harm that a manufacturer might suffer
if the Commission threw its weight behind a public disclosure
of information that reflected adversely on a particular
product and that subsequently proved to be erroneous.

That

was the danger that Congressman Crane stressed on the House

12

floor in his discussion of the FTC's treatment of Zerox anti­
freeze that we print in the brief at pages 34 and 35, and it
was the danger against which the representative of respondent
General Electric Company vzarned when he testified at the
House subcommittee hearing on the consumer products safety
legislation that —
QUESTIONs

Are you suggesting that that is the only

precaution that the Congress took, the retraction?
MRu BUSCEM1:

I am sorry, Mr. Chief Justice, the

retration is only one of the four requirements in Section
6(b) (1) .
QUESTION:

I got the impression you were suggesting

this took care of everything.
MR, BUSCEMI:

No, I didn't mean to do that.

I meant,

to say that the four requirements of Section 6(b)(1) have
particular application and the Commission argues exclusive
application when the Commission is making an affirmative public
disclosure of information.

That is the time at which there is

some danger that a manufacturer will be injured if the
Commission discloses ianacurate or misleading information.
And that is why Section 6(b)(1) was included, all four require­
ments of Section 6(b)(1).
By contrast, when the Commission releases information
under the compulsion of an FOIA request the Commission does no:
vouch for its accuracy.

There is no distribution to the public

13

1

at large, much less is there any expectation or intention that

2.

the public will learn of the information or rely on it.

3

indeed to forestall any such reliance the Commission frequently

£

accompanies FOIA releases with the kind of disclaimer proposed

5

in this case, telling the requester that the information he

or she has requested may for one reason or another be mislead­
ing .
QUESTION:

in Chrysler Corporation last year we recognised some difference
between agency materials generated by the agency and materials

MR„ BUSCEMI:

Well, that may be so but it does not

in any way detract from the distinction between the FOIA
release and the release at the Commission's initiative that
I am trying to make here.

I mean there may be distinctions

betwen the kinds of information that the Commission possesses
but those distinctions are different than the distinction
between an FOIA release and a release at the Commission's

19

initiative or with the Commission's approval such as the kinds
20

the Commission is directed to make under the statute.
21

Now, the FOIA applies to all Government agencies.
22
23
24

28

It is not concerned with instructing the public about the
dangers of consumer products.

It is concerned with opening

the processes of Government to public scrutiny and the accuracy

14

a

3

of the information in the Government's possession is irrelevant

2

to that purpose.
The Commission's only duty under the FOIA, the duty

S
4

that it shares with every other Government agency, is to release

5

those documents reasonably described in an FOIA request that

6

happen to be within its possession and control.

MR0 3USCEMI:

for it by the Consumer Products Safety Commission and any
representation that there was is simply something outside of
the Commission's control.

it or said that it was correct.

Yes.

But when that cat is out of the bag

how many people are going to make that kind of analysis of wher
it came from?
MS» BUSCEMI: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, if you simply
look at the information that is at issue in this case, we are
talking about accident reports, many of which were submitted
to the television manufacturers by individual consumers, hand­
written letters, very tight letters,

"My television exploded,

ray television caught on. fire," this is not the sort of material
that is likely to engender public trust just because it is
released by the Commisson.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BERNARD G„ SEGAL, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MRo SEGAL:

S

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
I would like to respond to Justice Stevens' question,

$

because I am afraid it wasn't really answered.

And to do so,

1

I need to quote only two sentences and a response in the oral

a

argument in the Third Circuit.
Judge Higginbotham asked counsel for the Commission:

30

"So you concede that it" --

1!

referring to all this material —

12

"is deceptive, a melange of errors and a whole series

13

of other words which Judge Lafcchum found.

He said it

other words.
"Mr. Mutterperl.
Your Honor.

We have not disputed that,

That is correct."

And that is a major key.
QUESTION:

Is that partly related, Mr. Segal, to the lack

of a definition of what is a TV accident?
MRo SEGAL:

Your Honor, it is one of the big problems here,

Mr. Chief Justice, that the industry begged the Commission to
define what a TV-relatad accident was.

It simply refused.

They begged them to define what they meant by various types
of things they were asking.

They refused.

And so you have

f*
25

I

■ i

just what Judge Higginbotham described as a melange of errors -

2 !

You have some people who gave TV accidents when it happened

the set.
So, Your Honors,

for that reason the project director

for the Commission in testifying said that he really couldn’t
say that this was of any use to the public except for a general
picture of TV's.

He said you couldn't use it for comparison

among companies.

And the expert that they called upon, he

said, well, he didn't see that he would give them much of any­
thing to the public in view of the factor.

That is in the

1©

record and specific, if it please the Court.

19
The' facts that were given by the representative of
2©
the Commission disregards all of this, which is a basic.

He

22

15

m

n

addressed himself to, whether v;hen the Commission releases
information -- let me take an example.

Suppose The New York

Times comes to the Commission and says, "Give us this material, i
and the Commission gives it.

Instead The New York Times goes

under the Federal FOIA and asks for the information.

difference can there be in the public conception when that is
published?

The Commission is the source, in any event.

S

QUESTION:

In republishing what might be released

4

under FOIA, the republisher isn't required to put on a little

§

warning that this may be misleading?
MR. SEGAL:

§

Indeed, no agency is permitted to request

7

that or require it.

And I might say to Your Honors, I am sure

fi

you know the Legal Times of Washington each week publishes a

«

whole list of the FOIA requests.

In Pierce & Stevens Judge

Feinberg expressly contrasted the industrial nature of the

IS

supplier and the single person character of the requestor.

II

You had a very appealing case, Your Honors, and whc

12

.

13

came to the Commission with not information supplied by others

14

but as a woman who had suffered her house completely burning

IS

down, herself being injured and an examination by the agency

16

itself and she said,

"Can I have the result of chat examination. ,r
!

?
It was a rather easy case and Judge Feinberg said,

17
58
t*

IS

"Well, when you have all of these industrials and a person
asks for it, isn't it fair to give it to the person.

i
I think he lost sight of the fact that most often

by the

?ay, it is not individuals who go to the FOIA, it is

of course industry, it is of course the press, it is of course
interested parties, it is of course consumer groups.

And as

-

the Chief Justice pointed out to say that it is as an imprimatur
if it comes directly from the Commission but it has no

28

imprimatur that goes through the FOIA, even though the
Commission hasn’t the right to say it comes from the FOIA.
It is in my mind, Your Honors, simply to state a fact that
beggars belief.
Now, as to why it was that Section 6(b)(1) was put
into this particular statute, I must say to Your Honors that
sometimes doubting the wisdom of Congress, as some of us do,
perhaps unwisely, this was one time when it acted with great
statesmanship.

What happened?

The Commission foresavj that

it would require, or its particular assignment -- you must
remember, if it please the Court, that this came in 1972 when
consumerism was enveloping the Nation, and this was an
endeavor and the biggest thing the consumers were asking
protect the consumer by the Congress to answer that persistent
demand, pounding at its doors with representatives crowding
its galleries.

And the House report, the Commission studiously

avoids going into the legislative history.

And as our brief

discloses, and obviously I won't have time to do it, the
House report, the conference reports really answer all of the
questions.
For- example, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, to answer you..*,
there never have been regulations ever issued by the Commission
in the eight years that it has been in existence.

They issued

a form of regulation to be discussed and never issued the
regulation.

So there is none.

QUESTION:

Mr. Segal, on page 52 of your brief, the

last paragraph starts:
"Not surprisingly, when the CPSC's 'administrative
interpretation' was presented co Judge Latchum in
October of 1977, he refused to accord any
significant xveighfc to it, nothing that it 'did not
arise until after the present controversy began.'"
You are suggesting that that was not a matter that
had been -MRo SEGAL:

Oh, no, that refers to subsequent

legislative history which the Commission endeavored.

There

It was endeavored to be

And then

statement that we intended the Consumer Products Safety Act

does specifically refer to the FOIA.

Section 6

Section 6 does

specifically refer to things that could not be disclosed.
And it was an amendment to that that the Commission asked in
1977 and the Congress just wouldn't pay any attention to it,
because that was completely adverse to what they wanted.
What they realized was that the industry was unlikely

IS
17

It didn't say disclosure except

to cooperate and release all this vast data from its files
if it felt that the Commission was merely a conduit to the

18
public, whether by FOIA or directly from the Commission.
39
And second, I must say for the Congress that the
20

debates indicate that it recognized that it would be unfair
21

if the names of manufacturers -- and I emphasize to Your Honors
22

m
24
25

that Section 6(b)(1) does not apply unless the name of a
manufacturer is clearly named, is given or can be gleaned from
the

information.

?

32

!

2

If that is not soj then Section 6 has no application
whatever.

3

Now, the statutory language itself, this word

4

"public," let me just say to Your Honors in a word the title

5

of Section 552 of FOIA is "Public Information."
What do you think is the title of 25(c) of the

€
7

Consumer Products Safety Act?

8

Identical.
What is the title of Section 6 which we are discuss­

"Public Disclosure of Information."
The Acts use identical "Information."

How they can

argue that one applies and the ether doesn't, really is

certainly beyond the language of the Act, it is certainly

14

beyond the legislative history of the Act.

longer, in the interest of time.
The problem here is the interaction of two statutes

the clear language.

here deliberately, statesmanlike, we wouldn't be here.

at all.

It couldn't be any good for comparisons among

FOIA so we are in the clear, we don’t need to abide by even

2$

Now, the Pierce case, Your Honors, was a very

35

compelling case.

The Pierce case was a case in which a

woman had had her house burned down, had been severely injured,
and she asked for the labels to see whether the label on her
bottle was the same as the other label.

And the Department

advised her that there were questions about it, it had an
investigation.

But we have to go to the manufacturer.

Nov;, I suggest to Your Honors that if that case
had not gone the way it did and the information had been
supplied, no court in the land would have undone or would have
referred that action.
And to show you how much Judge Feinberg's emphasis
was on the incident and not the law, I might say to Your
Honors with the greatest of deference to a court of which I
hold the highest regard, I am sure if it rereads that opinior
it would not warrant its standing in the legal community to
be determined by that opinion.
legislative history.

It simply doesn’t address the

It simply doesn't address the questions.

But to show you the unitary attitude, I just quote you one
statement.
"We believe that in this statute affecting
only commercial enterprises, Congress did not intend
to reduce disclosure called for by the FBI when a
person requests documents. n
Now, a person requested in that case but the case
applies if a corporation asks it.

If an organization asks it.

36

If the New York Times asks it.

i

And somehow the sympathy for

the case, I am afraid, overrode the kind of analysis and the
kind of opinion that the Second Circuit has become admired
for.
Now, Your Honors, there is a great deal I could ta3.k
about concerning the language of the courts but 1 don't see
any reason why to take Your Honors' time unless there is a
'
question.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OP PETER BUSCEMI, ES0o

MR0 BUSCEMI;

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

I have

only two brief points.
This case is purely a case of congressional intent.
Respondents have not replied to either of two points that the
Commission relies on in both of its briefs.
The first is respondent has not explained why
Congress would have decided to place a provision like Section
6(b)(1) in the Consumer Products Safety Act but not in any
other statute that creates an agency and empowers an agency
to require private parties to produce information submitted to
the agency.

one example.
And there is no indication anywhere in respondent's

argument or in the brief what the explanation would be for
applying 6(b)(1)

to the Consumer Products Safety Commission

alone
Moreover, there is a second point where there is no

ft

s

The Commodities Futures Trading Commission is just

explanation.
There is something special about the Consumer

to

Products Safety Commission and that is that it has this

obligation to make disclosures to the public.
Section 6(b)(I)

That is why

has to be there, because that is why the

Consumer Products Safety Commission is different.

to the 1976 amendment to the Act in Section 29(e).

This is

discussed in our brief and I don't have time to go into it
but I submit to the Court that the conference committee report
of that section makes it absolutely clear that Congress
believes that there is no obligation to comply with the
procedures in Section 6(b)(1) when the Commission or another
Federal agency responds to

FOIA request.

Thank you.
MRo CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
case is submitted.

Thank you gentlemen.
