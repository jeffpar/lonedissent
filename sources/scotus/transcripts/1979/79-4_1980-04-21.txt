P ROC E ED I N G S
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in Williams v. Zbaraz and the two consolidated cases*
Mr. Wenzel, you may proceed whenever you are
ready*
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM A. WENZEL, III, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF MILLER, ET AL
MR. WENZEL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

plea,scs the Court:
I am appearing here today.on behalf of Jeffrey C.
Miller, the Acting Director of the Illinois Department of
Public: Aid.

Director Miller, the defendant below, appeals

from a ruling of the District Court which invalidated
Illinois Public Act 80-1091 as violative of the equal pro­
tection of the laws for women who were seeking medically
necessary abortions but not abortions which war® necessary
to pressarv(3 their lives.
The issue, today before the Court is two-fold:
First, there is the equal protection issue, whether or not
the state may validly limit abortion funding under its
medical assistance programs in instances where the mother’s
life would be preserved, taking into account the state * s
interest in fetal life, and. also taking into account the
state’s willingness to fund, alternative treatments to
abortion

5

The second issue really should be discussed
first because it certainly shapes and clarifies the
equal protection issue.

That issue is what is the state's

obligations under Title 19 of the Social Security Act.

A

short background would be appropriate to bring these
issues into focus.
The Illinois General Assembly, in Dec saber of

1977 f enacted Illinois Public Act 80-1091 in response to
two federal initiatives.

Earlier that year this Court

had issued its rulings in fch© eases of Maher v« Roe,
Beal v. Dos, and Poalker v. Dee.

Those cases stand for

the proposition that indigent pregnant women have no con­
stitutional right nor statutory entitlement to a nontherapeutic abortion.
Earlier the United States Congress, as was
explored in the case that just preceded. us, had enacted
the first vers ion.'of the federal Hyde amendment.

The

federal Hyde amendment limited abortion funding under
the M-. lie a if Act except where an abortion was necessary
fco avoid the endanger meat of the woman's life.
QUESTION:

Hr. Wens el, just 1st ra© s-s@ if I

understand the appropriate statutory context of this case.
Whan Title 19 was originally enacted, the criminal laws
of many if not most states made the performance of an
abortion & serious offense, and I suppose that nobody

6

could have argued bad: in those days. in 1965, when Title
19 was enacted by the Congress that Title 19 authorised or
directed the states, let alone authorised them, to pay for
therapeutic abortions.
MR. WENZEL:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
had then came along this Court’s de­

cisions in Roe and Doe and thereafter I suppose it was
clear that Title 19 -— this is prior to any Hyde amend­
ment — authorized and directed -the states to cooperatively
finance such therapeutic abortions.
MR. WENZEL:
QUESTION:

We do not taka that position,
You do not.

Than clearly you do take

the position that after the Hyde 'amendment the state is
not required to.
MR. WENZEL:

That is correct.

Our view of

Title 19 —
QUESTION:

What is your position in, that inter

mediate period, after this Court’s decisions in Doe and
before th© Hyde amendment?
MR. V7ENZED:
QUESTION:
MR. WENZEL;

After Roe V . Wade.
Yes, Roe v. Wad© and Do® v. —»
States were .operating under dis­

cretionary authority to fund, abortions , whether they be
medically necessary or elective aborti.©ns or not fund
such abortions, according to the primary test under Title

7
19, that Is whether there was a reasonable standard for
establishing eligibility for the scope of medical assis­
tance . under the act.
QUESTION:

,
Your position is that Title 3.9 it­

self prior to the Hyde amendment didn’t put any require­
ment on the states with respect to therapeutic abortions,
is that right?
MR. WENZEL;

That’s correct. Your Honor.

Now,

what the Hyde amendment did —
QUESTION;

How about abortions relating to -~

that would iavolva the health of the mother?
MR. WENZEL;

Well, I was going to say I guess

as a follow-up to Mr. Justice Stewart’s question —
.QUESTION:

That is what' I meant when I. talked

about th©rapaoti.c abortions.
MR. WENZEL:
therapeutic abortion..

It depends on what we mean by
1 would take the position, her®

today that if by ther .peufcie abortion we mean simply
health impairing but not necessary to preseve life —
QUESTION;
ML. wsnzeL:

That is what 1 meant.
— that the stata would have been

free to «Kcluda funding for such abortions bscaus® that
is in our view of things consistent with section 1396a(a) C17), the reasonable standards language.

But if by

tharapeafcio abortion wa mean an abortion which is

e
necessary to preserve Iif© or to avoid a threat of death,
then X would say that any state that had. such a. total
prohibition on the funding of abortions in 1974, for «g»
ampi®, would not be able to meat the statutory test set
out in section 1396a(a)(17).
The Hyde amendment effectively strips states of
the discretion to fund non-Hyde amendment abortions *
QUESTIONs

Ho, they can do it and pay for it

themselves„
Mil. WENZEL",

It strips states of the discretion

to fund then within the context of the Medicaid program.
It lets than wholly —~
QUESTION: It,couldn't take that power away from
the state, could it; constitutionally?
MR. WENZEL §

I asm making a distinction between

stripping statas of the discretion of doing something or
funding something but in the context of.the medical
os•• xsfcanoa program, that is the joint cooperative program,

v.rrl ' has states do outside of that cooperative program
within their own state

authorised and state funded pro­

grams .
Illinois, in addition to the Medicaid program,
has two wholly state authorised and state funded programs,
programs of general assistance and & program of aid for
the med ica 1 ly .1 sc igent.

9

QUESTION:

Well, when you say joint: assistance,

you mean than partial reimbursem-amt from the federal
government?
MR. WENZEL:

That is correct, Mr. Justice

Rehnguist.
QUESTION:

Just, to bo perfectly clear, Illinois

is perfectly free to fund abortions if it. wants to, isn’t
it?
MR. WENZEL:

Under its own programs with its

own funds, correct.
QUESTION:

If it is willing to pay for it.

MR. WENZELs
QUESTION:

If it is willing to pay for it.
But your position is that it is pro­

hibited from doing so under the federal program?
MR. WENZEL:

That is correct, which does not

affect •—
QUESTION:
that?

What in the Hyde amendment prohibits

All it does is says the government won’t put any

money up, isn't that all it says?
MR. WENZEL:

Well, our position rests with the

analysis of the impact of the Hyde amendment on Title 19
itself as the First Circuit in fir©term'V. Dukakis and the
Seventh —
QUESTION:

That didn't withdraw any requirement

©f the state doing ~~ but it didn’t say the state wasn’t

10
perfectly fre© to do it.
ME. NE&ZEL:

1 think the argument v*s to bs made

that th-a Hyde amendment has a substantive impact or: Title
19»

There is a substantive impact on Title 19 by modify­

ing the state's discretion tn fund or not to fund abortions
If it didn't have any substantive impact,, than what it
would he doing is altering impliedly the state * s right to
receive federal reimbursement, bat there is »,

evideron of

that either in the language of the Hyde .amendment or in
any of the debates in Congress that Congress, intended to
raqaira states as « condition of participation in Title
19 to fund non-Hyds amendment abortions.
OUBSTIO!?;
a-

1 understand that, bt.t the Hyde

it- slf is vaerely a refusal to have any part of
particular annua 1 appropriation,-, havr any part of that

money bs. spent to raimburs*; gthe stats for its funding of
abortion, isn't that right?
JR. WSHilu

We view the debates of Congress

as- herring used an appropriation vehicle bat that they were
clear -

the intent ’-ins clear that what they were doing

is engaging in substantive legislation»
2U3STI0E-:

Do you think that substantive legis­

lation would survive if during the following year there
rare r.o such rider to tfcsa appropriation bill?
yp, pip:;Hlc

io, Your Honor, -they would either

have tx case up with a —
QOESTlOMs

They are one-year pieces of legisla­

tion, each one.
MR. WENZEL:

But in this particular case, this

Court in prior decisions has looked to see whether Congress
has successively enacted th® same sort of rider and when
that sort of pattern of Congress intent is present then it
strengthens' the conclusion that they intended to engage in
substantive legislation.
QUESTION:

Are you getting any money for tuber­

culosis or mental health?
MR. WENZEL
QUESTION:

Yas.
Yet you do have facilities for that

in Illinois, don't you?
MR. WENZEL:
QUESTION:

Yes> we do, Your Honor.
Now couldn't you sat up a facility

for abortions th® same way?
or.

WENZEL:

QUESTION;
MR. WENZEL:

Yes, sir.
And pay for it. yourself?
Yes, we could do that, Mr. Justice

Marshall.
QUESTION:

Let me b© sure

* I am not sure what

this debate about or discussion about th© state's rights
are.

Prior to 1973, the State of Illinois, through its

legislature, could have amended th® law so as to achieve

12
the same status for abortions as the opinion of this Court
fid, could they not?
MR. WENZEL:
COURT:

Ye3, sir.

And they could have either paid for ail

of them or paid for none of them, could they not, the state
leg is latur 3 ?
MR. WENZEL:

The state could have independent

from its state medicaid program either
paid for none.

paid for all or

But if the law, for example, had been

amended in 1970, at that point in time Illinois was par­
ticipating in Title 10.

And as I answered the question of

Mr. Justice White, I do not believe it would have been
reasonable for consistent with the mandates under Title 19
for Illinois to exclude life preserving or life threatening
abortions.
Essentially, this dispute is a result of a foot­
note in the Court's ruling in Baal v. Doe that said that
serious questions would be raised if the states intended
to excludo medically necessary care, and the Court in that
opinion also mad® reference to the definition of medical
necessity in Doe v. Bolton which said that an abortion is
no ■ esary when a physician, exercising his professional
judgments in light of all factors, whether they foe physical,
emotional, psychological, economic.

familial, familial age,

all of those factors, if they are relevant to health.

13
doctors should be given that leeway,

That is an appropri­

ate standard within the context of litigation dealing with
criminal sanctions.

We feel that it is wholly inappropriate

to impose, as the District Court did below, the Doe v.
Bolton definition of medical necessity.
What that does in effect is to transform the
medicaid program into a program run and controlled by the
providers as opposed to being run and controlled by the state.
The state under medicaid has discretion, as we have pointed
out,

Illinois has exercised that discretion, has made ex­

clusions beyond merely abortions.

We do not pay for several

services of categories of particular procedures.
pay for infertility and sterility procedures.
pay for transexual surgery.

We do not

We do not

We impose durational limita­

tion requirements on in-patient car®.
Illinois views its participation in medicaid as
providing adequate, non-comprehensive care to the indigent,
and I think that that is crucial in helping to frame the
constitutional question,

Congress, by repealing in 1972

the requirement that statas achieve a goal of comprehensive
medical cars oy 1975, left intact the original intent
which was merely to provide adequate care;.

When Illinois excludes medically necessary abortions and will only fund abortions necessary for the
pres ervafcion of life, it is exercising the discretion that

14
Congress vested in it to maka these sorts of choices.
QUESTION:

Even though some — even in a great

many cases absent an abortion there would be a serious
health risk to the potential mother?
MR. WENZEL:

The reasonableness that Illinois*

exclusion here I think hinges in part upon the availability
of alternative forms of treatment on the on© hand and that
the type of abortions, using the Do® v.

Bolton standard,

that plaintiffs are seeking to have funded are so •— the
definition is so elastic that basically it sweeps into its
compass all elective abortions.

There is nothing to pre­

vent a physician from utilising a Doe v.

Bolton definition

of medical necessity and signaling out the fact, .for
example; of age and saving that that is relevant to health

That is your position.

MR. WENZEL;

As long as.w© didn't take that final

QUESTION:

Let's say the state makes the choice,

the state passes a law that says in all those cases the
choice shall be made in favor of the fetus, would that be
irrational?
MR. WENZEL?

MR. WENZEL:

I believe it may be, Your Honor,, yes.
Well, may be or would be?

Anything

It would be irrational, Your Honor.

But what we have here

I think that is precisely the state-

interest on which the United States relies in the previous
case.
QUESTION:

Do you mean irrational in my brother

Relinquish's sense of if you thought the other wav you
belonged in an insane asylum?
MR. WENZEL:

I am sure that the members of the

Illinois General Assamb.lv were aware that there were hard
choices, but I think that we could never cone down to that
either/or situation because of the state's willingness to
fund alternatives, number one, and that the state's interest

17
in fetal life does not thereby necessarily deneqrate the
state's interest in maternal health.

Tbs stata hopes by its

policy to promote both of those interests.
If there are no

.other questions, I would like to

reserve some time for rebuttal.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF VICTOR G. ROSENBLUM, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT WILLIAMS ET AL
MR. ROSENBLUM•:
please the Court;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

I represent the interveners in both cases

but I am addressing myself to the Zbaraz case this morning,
and in the course of the limited time that I have I hope to
be able to address the natura of the right to privacy within
context of the Constitution and whether the Hvde amend*

i.. :, t infringes on that right, especially through penalty
analysis, and I hops also to be able to address the appro­
priation'.; issue which raises another theory of constitutional
issue for this Court that at & minimum would counsel restraint.
With regard to the nature of the right to privacy,
may I point out that the Court's use of the term "childbirth"
in th® Maher decision was used interchangeably with the
language of "normal childbirth."

So, for example, at page

474 of the U.S. Reports in Maher, th® Court had said that it
implies no limitation on the author.!tv of the state to make

18

a value judgment favoring childbirth over abortion and to
implement that judgment by the allocation of the funds.
It is our position that at least at that time that
the use of childbirth and normal childbirth were used by the
Court interchangeably and that in any event the-Court’s
ruling was with regard to there being no limitation on the
authority of the state to make a value judgment favoring
childbirth.
Similarly, with regard to the Maher test, the Maher
test,, as we understand it, was a test that, used three words
as the standard, the. words of "unduly burdensome interference,"
an adverb, an adjective and a noun, and we would take the
position that with all respect the adverb is no violative,
that the adjective is not violative, and that the noun
standing alons is not violative either, that there is indeed
no interference by the state or by Congress here with the
defined right to privacy.
QUESTION:

Mr.

tbsenblum, let me pose to vou the

sarr qumotion as I asked one of the earlier counsel about
th c t fan ley v

Georgia and Rid. ell cases which were decided

vritbin two or three years of each other.

One held, that there

was a right to read in your own living room obscene material,
anything else that you could get ahold of.
years later

Two or three

the same Court held that although you had that

right, the government could prevent shipment for that

19
purpose and prevent you in effect from getting ahold of sane
types of that literature.
MR. ROSEN BLUM .
Refers guist,

We take the position.- Mr. Justice

that that is the vary essence of the difference

between the Court’s ruling ir. Roe and the Court’s ruling in
Maher, and that it is —
QUESTION:

Wasn’t the Court’s ruling in Roe based

on privacy?
MR. ROSBNBLUM;

Ho, the Court’s ruling in Roa was

indeed based upon privacy and the ruling in Maher was based
upon entitlement and there is a vast sea c€ difference be­
tween the issue of privacy in Roe as it bears upon the exarc is© of a prohibition on the part of the state and the
privacy issue as it bears upon the matter of entitlement,
:o.r there was indeed an impingement upon privacy as the
Court found in Roa because there was a prohibition in the
case of Maher...

in the present case

there is no prohibi­

tion on the woman's right, there is no denial of the benefit
on the basis that infringas the right to privacy in any way.
There is no pledge of allegiance or statement of belief
■chat is r.squired to keep the job. there is no switching of
political party allegiance that is required in this instance,
there is no finding, there is no retaliation.

sense of belief.

Arid finally there is no coercion in any
There is in the fullest sense in the

legislation involved here the recognition on the oarfc of the
legislatures of that basic right to privacy in the classical
Brandeis notion.

The woman is indeed being left alone.

She

is in no different a position after the legislation than she
vras before the legislation with regard to the exercise of
that right.
QUESTION:

That indeed is her complaint, she is

being left alone, not being given any help.
MR. ROSENBLUM:

Wall, that would be a 100 percent

correlation with the original conception of the right to
privacy,

that is, it is the right to be left alone —
QUESTION:

The original conception was a tort and

not a constitutional invasion in the original Brandeis
article,
It ROSENBLUM:

Even preceding, Mr. Justice Stewart,

to the constitutional determination, the test that was
established by this Court for interference is the test of an
rudely burdensome interference.

So presumably the Court

would still allow ©van an interference and we would assert
that in this instance there is not even that, that there.-is
the full regard and the full preservation of the woman’s
right to privacy in this instance.

The penalty analysis

consequently is peculiarly inappropriate in the type of

21
situation in which there is full respect for the exercise of
that interest.
Now,

if the position that is advocated by the

plaintiffs were to prevail hare, the legislature would be
reduced to the position of implementing a notion of neutral
principles.

There would bo no purpose served in having

elections, there would be no purpose served in stimulating
people to participata in those elections.

Quite to the con­

trary, the consequence would be that it would ’.make no dif­
ference because any time a legislature wished to exercise
the initiative or make value judgment to fund A, it would
b® required at the same time to fund non-A or anti-A and
consequently to reduce the legislature to engaging in mere
empty ritual.
I would like for a moment also to be able to address
the question of the special problem involved in the appro­
priations issue.

QUESTION:

Mr. Roseablum, I take it the.Solicitor

General doss aot join you in this argument.
MR. ROSENBLUM:

That is our understanding, Mr.

Justice Blackmon, that th© Solicitor General is representing

22

the Secretary of HEW and our intervening clients have an
additional view on this subject*
QUESTION:

Before we leave this, did I understand

you to say that the legislatures have the constitutional
authority to leaks value judgments?
MR. ROSENBLUM:
QUESTION:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

And would you say that includes the

right, the power to make value judgments that are erroneous
judgments in the minds of perhaps a majority of the people?
MR. ROSENBLUM:

Yes, I would, Mr. Chief Justice,

and I believe furthermore that this was a subject that this
Court assisted significs.vi.tly

the legislature with in its

decision in Baker v. Carr and its progeny, that is to say
that the Court helped fchoi integrity of the legislative
process by assuring the fairness of apportionment, a decision
which has been effectively implemented and counsels the
additional recognition that value judgments are essentially
for the legislature to make rather than for this Court to
make with regard to crucial and often divisive issues of
national policy.
QUESTION:

Who is supposed to correct the wrong,

ths erroneous value judgments of the legislature?
MR. ROSENBLUM:

The people through the elective

process, a process which was significantly improved, as I
say, through the decisions following this Court's action in

Baker v. Carr.

When of course there is a constitutional

violation, then under the separation of powers system this
Court must assert its authority.

But we submit that under

the circumstances of this case that there is no such occasion
which calls for the interposition of the Court's authority.

MR. ROSENBLUM:

But the economic interest argument

was similar to perhaps the mirror image of the economic in­
terest argument that was made on behalf of the plaintiffs.
QUESTION:

It may be the mirror image, but do you

mean if is just the opposite.

What you mean is they didn't

nave an economic interest.
MR. ROSENBLUM:

No, they did have an economic in­

terest because, as an obstetrician and a pediatrician, that
they had an economic interest in the continuity of childbirth
and the continuity of clients would b© the product of such
childbirth.
QUESTION:

And that was the approach, in the District

Court?
MR. ROSENBLUM:

That is indeed our understanding.

Now, .with regard to the appropriations question,
t:, : lif •: re o.

tween this situation and the situation in

■festert:. is emphatically that in the W@st.cott cases there was
agreement, on the part of all of the parties that it was
appropriate to rsach the decision that was reached there.
In this case, there is a clear-cut ~QUESTXON:

Mr. Rosonbluat, two questions.

talking —~ let in© ask thesn both.

Are you

First of all, are you

25
talking about the Congress or are you talking about the
Illinois legislature; and, secondly, are you talking about
remedy or ar© you talking about constitutional —
MR. ROSENBLUM:

I am talking hers especially about

the issue of remedy, and I am talking here especially about
the issue of Congress.

But in this respect we are dealing

with
QUESTION %

.Congress and that of , remedy.

MR. RQSENB1UM:

Yes.

In this respect we are deal­

ing wita the appropriations power of Congress and that while
this Court does, of course? as it showed in tbs Lovett case?
that it does, have the power to declare an appropriations
act unconstitutional, that nonetheless' even in the Lovett
case the Court did not order funding.

The Court left that

matter for determination by the Congress.

And the difference

between the ■ ■1^53 fcC- ©fct case and the present case is that in
Westcott there was agreement on the part of all of the
parties with regard to the funding issue, and in this case
there is clearly not such agreement and this would counsel
c/Mifcicna! r&wtrainb on the part of the Court in invoking
its constituiIona1 powers.
QUESTION %

Wasn't there something in the Lovett

case to the effect -that if the money were not otherwise
provided, Lovatfc and his colleague could go to the Court of
Claims and sue the government?

In other words, there is no

26
suggestion that in the Lovett case Congress could be ecar­
pel led to see that they were paid?

MR. ROSENBLUM:
Justice.

That’s quite correct, Mr. Chief

There was I believe scrupulous regard for the

constitutional separation of powers on this issue and for the
fact that Article I, clause 9, paragraph 7 reserves the
funding power to the Congress of the United States.
QUESTION:

I understand though, Mr. Rosehblum,

you said counsels restraint,, not that, as in Westcott, ex­
tent ion could not be directed by this Court?
MR. ROSENBKJMi

Well, we are saying that the Court

its:"If doss not have the funding powers, it may not —
QUESTION:

I am asking you, may w© do what w@ did

in Tvcstcc tt in this case if we find the Hyde amendment an*

cons titutiona1?
MR. ROSENBLUM's

We would submit no, that is you

stay find the Hyde amendment unconstitutional, but if the
Hyde amendment is found unconstitutional, the effect of that
is that there are no funds for abortion unless and until
Congress appropriates those funds.
QUESTION:
too.

That was true in the Westcott situation,

What I am trying to get at is do you say constitution­

ally we may not do it or that —
MR. ROSEHBLUM:
QUESTION:

I am 'saying that —

— I thought you said we must exercise

21
restraint and not do it.
MR. ROSEMBDJMs

I am saying that in general re­

straint should be counseled hare with regard to the finding
of unconstitutionalifcy on the part of Congress’ action; but
that even if there were to be a finding of unconstitutionality
that the Court does indeed not have the power to order the
funding —
QUESTION:

Constitutionally wa do not have the

power ?
MR. RGSEKBLUM:

That would ba the position of the

interveners, Mr. Justice, that the matter of funding is re­
served under the Constitution in cur separation of powers
system to Congress.
QUESTION;

How about a state?

How about directing

a state legislature?
MR. ROSENBLUM-

Well, the directing of a state

legislature involves another issue, Mr. Justice Powell.
QUESTION;

Is; that involved here?

'•Ut. ROSSHuniMs

Well, it could conceivably be in-

vo Iv ed her e.
QUESTION;

Well, ara you involving it?

MR. ROSENBLUM:

No, because the question here would

come basic to the question that is more like

the question in

Stewart Machine about whether the state wishes to participate
or not in the Social Security program, and if the state

28
wishes to participate it was indeed the finding by the Court
in Stewart Machine that there is no coercion upon the state,
and. th€?re is a vast diff erenciiv of course, between coercion
and motivation.
QUESTION:

Well, what if there is a declaration

that the Illinois statute was unconstitutional?
MR. RCSEN3LUM:

If there was a declaration that.

the Illinois statute was unconstitutional —
QUESTION:

What do we clo then?

MR. ROSE TBLUM:

It would then be up to Illinois to

decide whether it wished to continue in the Social Security
program or not.
QUESTION:

Could vo attempt to — would ws have

the paver to direct them cx not?
MR. ROSENBLUM:

Well, I think you reserved that

question in the Usery case, that at that time you I believe
in Footnote 17 —
QUESTION:

That may'be, but what is your position?

What is your submission on that question?

Would we have the

powsr or not?
MR. ROSBWBIUM;

My submission on the question, sir,

would b© that it would be inappropriate to order the state
to do so in that situation because that would place in
jeopardy the-; federal system.
QUESTION%

Well, it might b©

inappropriate, but

29

do wa hav© ths power ?
MR. ROSENBLDM;

I believe that you do have the

power with regard to the state.

It is not a separation of

powers issue as spac5.fiea3.ly spelled out under the first
article dealing with the legislative processQUESTION;

Lai. me pursue that.

If the state hav­

ing that order served on theta f that command and. the state
does what President Jackson did many, many years ago, what
can b® don® about it?

How does a. Court force the state

legislature to appropriate money?...
MR. ROSBNBHJM:

That of course is the very essence

of both the problem and the strength of our separation of
powers system, that the uses of restraint within that
system are expected to- work out political compromises and
that the usor:3 of coercion have been rare within that system
precisely because coercion itself is alien to the success
of the political system, and this is one sore reason for the
counseling of restraint even while the calling into question
of this Court's power to deal with the issue would be inap­
propriate.
QUESTION:

Do you view the constitutions 1 issues

in the state case and the prior casa as the same or different?
MR. ROSEFBLDMs

I view the constitutional issues

in the state case arc! in the prior case as having great
similarities, Mr. Chief Justice, but as having seme

30
differ «meas by virtue of the difference between the nature
of the system of separation of pomes and the system of
federalism.

These were problems that were alluded to in the

Usery case and I believe the Court reserved judgment on the
issue of the impact of funding on the application of Usery.
QUESTIONs

Mr. Rosanbliaa, how about language in

Article I of the Constitution that no money shall be drawn
from the public treasury save in osar else of the execution
of an act of Congress?

MR. ROSEKBHMt

Walls- that is what I was relying

on, Mr. Justice Rebnquist, for the special point about the

sanctity of til© appropriations power of Congress and the in~
appropriateness in response to ray question from Mr. Justice
Brennan — tha inappropriafc«mass' constitutionally of the
Court's asking & funding decision in this manner.

there really is not call for any equal protection analysis

MR. ROSMSLUMs

No.- there is a call for equal

protection analysis and it is a call for the application of

31
the rat.io.nal basis test»

But as this Co-.srt pointed out in

the MurgXia case in its par curium decision, the rational
basis test is a nor© relaxed test and under that relaxed
test of rationality, what is looked for first is the
rational decision which the Court found in Roe to be at
least a rational matter for concern for the life of the
fetus.

Consequently, if there is a rational relationship

between that and the legitimate state interest the state
has in tfe-s -praaarvation of the life of the fetus, than that

should be sufficient to meet the-rational relationship test
under this- Murglia standard.
Thank yon.

We appear principally here because

ca ruuand frcn the Court cf Appeals the District Court was
instructa-i to consider flu. constitutionality of the Hyde

th© plaintiffs did not claim that thsy were harmed au all by

tending that it impinged on any right of his and it has been
our position in this matter that there is no case or contro­

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT W. BENNETT# ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. BENNETT:

Mr. Chief Justice# and may it please

the Court:

Unlik® the Solicitor General# appellant Miller
and the intervening appellants gloss over the central fact

Both appellant Miller and the

interveners suggest in fchair brief that nothing much is at

QUESTION:

Mr- Bennett, when you said the record -

I take it yon mean the record before the District Coart?
ME. BENNETT:
QUESTIONs

That is correct. Your Honor.

Supposing that either the Congresss or

the Illinois legislature had had legislative hearings on
this and found conflicting evidence, some of it supporting
the evidence found in the District Court in the Northern
District of

Illinois, some of its exactly contrary, and

the committee reported a bill out. which was the Hyde amend­
ment.

Do you think that the Northern District of Illinois

could then hold..-its own hearing, hear' these same witnesses
aad come to a different conclusion as to whether or not th®
bill was rational or whether or not on© witness was to be

ME. BENNETTs

Under the constitutional test I

would assume rhafc the legislature would b© given the benefit
jf r-trip vis factual doubts and that that would fos the duty

of

br Di-;trier Court.

fee:;-r'd

Under th® statutory standard, th©

-rrtrrs entrusts those judgments to professional

standard review organisations.

But I would point onz that

we have no such question here.

There is absolutely no in­

dication that the legislature had any health concern or
health question in mind when it passed the statute it did.

35
QUESTIONS

Well, does it have fco appear on the

face of some sort of piece of paper that they had a h-aalfh
concern in mind in order fco say that they did?
MR. BENNETT:

No, it doesn't have to appear on

the face but then evidence about whether there was s plaus­
ible argument for such a health interest would be admissible
in a District Court.

In this case, we do have paper and

the state is very clear about the interest it was serving.
It was attempting to stop abortions and it cared not about
health or life of pregnant women.
QUESTION:

Well, supposing that the legislators

had gone back fco their various constituencies and talked to
the people who voted for or against the person who represent
chat district and acquired information in that manner, would
you say that was totally irrelevant?'
MR. BENNETT:

No, it was not, Your Honor, but the

very process' of constitutional adjudication, unless facts
ar© to be entirely irrelevant to constitutional adjudication
must rely upon the adducing of factual evidence in a court.
As I said,

if tier® is & debatable issues the legislature

would clearly have the benefit of fch® doubt.

Here there is

no debatable issue.
QUESTION:

Do you suggest that there is a monolithic

basic siefc of reasons by all the members of the legislature
who vofcisd this law?

36
MR. BENNETT*
QUESTION?

'

Well, I —

Ar® they all doing it for the sa:a ;

reasons?
MR. BENNETT;

I would never make any such sort of

cosmic judgment, but here we do have a statement by the
legislature itself in legislation passed in 1975 and again
in 1979 still on the books, .embraced by the attorney for fch©
state in his brief as a statement of the state’s interest in,
as he puts it, fetal ilia, and that is in the legislation.
It is quoted in his brief and in ours.

The legislature

makes it clear that what it was doing was trying to effectu­
ate the judgment that life begins at conception and that the
fetus has th© right to life from the moment of conception.

Oh the merits, appellees rely on a federal statu­
tory and a federal constitutional argument that 111111018’

;dfch ir.-«/aX of 'medicaid funding for medically necessary
abortions is illegal.

Th© statutory argument has two

Fir::':, the state's obligation under Title 29,
iho nececeic: provisions of th© Social Security Act; and,
second, the effect if any of the annual appropriation
measures' that have been referred, to her© at the Hyde amend­
ments, Smith, and Jonss aiaeradmeaits occasionally.
On the Title 19 question, the Court of Appeals
concluded that Illinois was required to provide funding for

37
all medically necessary abortions undar its medical assis­
tance programs.

A dozen other lower courts have reached •

essentially the same conclusion,
A state m@dica.id plan is required by Title 19 to
provide for the inclusion of at least the first five services
included in section !35Sd.(a) —
QOEfSTION s

Are you addressing yourself to the

decision of the Court of- Appeals on remand?
MR. BENNETTs

Your Honor, we urge that the statu­

tory ground hors is available to ihs Court as an alternative
ground for d-aci-sion.

I k«s simply char ac ter ising where

that statutory ground cam© from,
QUESTIONS

But it isn’t something that we 'have

granted certiorari on, it is something — you are just
urging that as an appellee to support the judgment?
MR. BENNETTs

That is correct.

As 1 ms saying,

the ct&fce medicaid plan -*• the federal medicaid statute
uses mandatary. language to express a minimal state obliga­
tion, that to provide at least the first five services
11si&d in section 1396d (a).

Those mandatory services in-

olr.physician services, in-patient and out-patient hospital
services, and early and periodic screening for children, all

it,:' sarnicas tint are necessary to provide medically neces­
sary abortions.

to?
MR. BENNETT;

Th® Hyde amendment is a very specific
Our argument with regard to it is that

it does precisely what its words specifically say? that is
to say restrict th® us® of federal funds and say nothing
about th® state's obligation under Title 19.

MR. BENNETT;

Well, I think it makes a lot of

Of course, there ere multiple opinions from -sals

Court siid others that the duty of s. court is to foils*-/ the
plain meaning of statutory language.

There is ah ex seption

stated to that, and that is where there would be an absurd
result produced by following that language, but I don’t
ia any absurd result here.

Congress was acting

in s particular confcsEt, the contest of appropriation, and
it took a 'particular action and its words ar© very clear
about v'kab it intended to bring about by that action.
In those circumstances, vm argue that there really
is so need to look to legislative history at ail in order to
determine what; effect th® Hyde amendment has on the state's
Title 19 obligations.
QUESTION;

Your position, Mr. Bennett, is that

Title 19 in tlx® absence of any Hyde amendment clearly re­
quires the state, to participat® is. the funding of therapeutic

39
abortions.
MR. 3ENNET7:

Yes , that is our position, Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

And even after the Hyde amendment,

which by its terms 3imply limited the appropriation- of fed­
eral funds, Title 19 continued to impose such a requirement?
MR. BENNETT:
QUESTION:

That is Correct, Your Honor.

Has any court agreed with you on that?

MR. BENNETT:

Yas, there have bean a cpuple of

lower courts chat have.
QUESTION:

Well, what do you do with the Dickerson

ca»@ in 310 U.S.?
MR. BENNETT:

Oh- yes, X do 'recall the Dick©:son

case actually, Your Honor.

It seems to me that there the

intent ’ to repeal was manifest, intent to impliedly amend a.
statute,

Ears: wo have examples, %-m have cited a number of

axar pies incur brief, the Solicitor General has offseed

'o::.o ctrers, .in which there is not the assumed eongruanc©
cat

;.e that fur. ling formula under these cooperative federal-

state programs and the underlying substantive obligations.
Congressman Hyde himself, in the coars® of fch© de­
bates, bemoan id on occasion the fact that he couldn’t get
the substantive questions —* constitutional amendments,
the Social Security Act --■* before Congress, and so the
Congress was acting in 2. particular context, that, of

40
appropriations.

If it is appropriate to look at the legis-

lativ© history in order to determine what Congress accomp­
lished by passing words that are quit© clear , that legislative
history really reinforces the conclusion ws are urging.
What members of Congress most frequently said was
that they were restricting the use of federal funds.

Congress

knows how to amend th® Social Security Act. if it wants to.
The Bowman amendment, which, has recently passed the House
and is now in the Senate, 'an amendment to the Child Health
Assurance Act, says, "Nothing in Title 19 shall be construed
to require any state funds to be used to pay for any abortion.’
The Hyde amendment could have said that, but it did not, and
this Court’s quit© recent decision in TVA v. Hill counsels
strongly against finding an implied amendment of an underly­
ing substantive statute brought about by an appropriations
act,
The equal protection clausa commands the same re­
sult.

Our claim here is depicted by the appellants as a

claim for affirmative subsidy of the exercise of a funda­
mental right.

But the plaintiffs here are making ao claim

for an affirmative subsidy for the exercise of a fundamental
right.

Their claim is not to be discriminated against in

violation of the equal protection clause, and the equal
protection clause applies to state medical car® statutes just
as much as it applies to any other statute.

41
QUESTION:

And now you are talking not about the

federal statute' but about the state statute?
MR. BENNETT:

That is correct, Your Honor.

MR. CHIEF (.JUSTICE BURGER:

We will resume there

at 1:00 o * c Io? fc, cour» se 1.
(Whereupon, at 12:00 o8deck noon, the Court was
in recess, to reconvene at 1:00 o’clock p.ra., the same day.)

42
AFTERMOON SESSION — 1;00 GrCLOCK P.M.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
MR, BENNETT:

Mr. Bennett.

Mr, Chief. Justice, and may it pleas®

the Courts
Appellants' constitutional arguments are premised
on an attempt to identify this case with the situation pre­
sented in. Maher v. Roe, but this case is not like Maher v.
Roe and it differs is ways that are central to the constitu­
tional analysis that is appropriate.
In Maherf tbs plaintiff complained that the state
favored normal childbirth over abortion, and this Court held
that it was permissible to express a value judgment in favor
of childbirth.

The value judgment was expressed by use of

a medical assistance program in which refusal to fund elec­
tive abortions lid

.0 violence whatsoever to the medical

assistance goals on which that program was grounded.
If a woman desiring an abortion could not obtain
err

?h? coul?. go through normal childbirth with all medic­

ally necessary expensas paid and neither her life nor her
health would la put in jeopardy.
QUESTION:

What if we disagree with you on what

the medical goals of the act are?

What if we decided that

like the District Court did, that if is not inconsistent
with the act?
MR. BENNETT:

I guess I —

43
QUESTION:

Well, with the Hyde amendment it is

not inconsistent according to the District Court.
MR. BENNETT;

Well,

if the Hyde amendment, Tour

Honor, modified the state’s obligations under Title 19,
then I would agree that the totality of the state judgment
and the federal judgment was on© which excluded those pro­
cedures.

That is clear, but that would be true of any state

discriminatory -action.

That does not prevent the applica­

tion of the equal protection clause, the equal protection
analysis.

Indeed, the Constitution commands the application

of the equal protection analysis.
QUESTION;

0rm reason for saying it violated the

equal protection clausa would»’tibe that it was inconsistent
with the statute, which
MR..BENNETTs

Is what you were just arguing.
Ho.

I3m sorry, I was trying to

distinguish this case from the situation in Maher.
QUESTIONS

I know you ware, yes.

MR. BENHET!s

In Maher’, the state could express

■; value judgment bur. do no violence to any health goals, do
no violence to the general area of activity in which it
it:-'..If had decided that it would undertake a very substantial

program.
QUESTION;

Did Congress express a value judgment

in the Hyde esiendment, do you think?
MR. BENNETTs

I aia sure that in some sense Congress

44
expressed a value judgment.

Indeed, I think Congress ex­

pressed a. pure sort of value judgment that abortions war©
evil am hence federal money was not to be associated with
that.
QUESTION:

P4r. BsBU.nett,, 1 am a. little bit con­

fused, the same way my brother White is.

Is this a statu­

tory as opposed to a constitutional argument that' you aro
making now, or is it a constitutional argument but somewhat
different than the other parties have made?
MR. BENNETT:

I take it that all constitutional

arguments about discrimination must define th® area in
which th® discrimination takes place. and against which th®
discriminatory denial of a benefit must be judged.
QUESTION:

Well - I could think my question could

be answered yes or no, whether this is a constitutional
argument you are now advancing or whether it is a statutory
argument, that really there isn’t any constitutional ques­
tion here for us to decide because the Hyde amendment
didn’t change the requirements of the medicaid act.
MR. BENNETTs

I advance both of those arguments,
i

Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Which ware you advancing at the time

Mr. Justice White asked —
MR. BENNETT:

The constitutional argument.

Th©

state obviously has wide discretion to choose its spending

45
and regulatory activity? but when it doss make a choica that
choice defines the area of discrimination for equal protec­
tion purposes.

And regardless of the equal protection

standard that is to be applied hare, what Illinois has done
cannot stand.

The abortion decision essentially touches

the health of indigent pregnant women.

That theme has been

reiterated time and again in this Court's decisions, and
indeed two or three provisions in abortion regulations that
have been upheld have all been I would submit carefully
sculpted so as to avoid any serious jeopardy to the pregnant
woman5 s hea1th.
Here

Illinois refuses to..fund medically neces­

sary abortions in pursuit I would submit of no legitimate
interest at all.

This Court has found that the state has

a legitimate interest in protecting potential life, but
*

Illinois was not atfc-s5Y-.pting to protect potential life,

i

t Illinois was doi ng was trying to prevent abortions

with the view that a fetus was a human life in the same
sensa that a two-year -old was and in the same sens© that a
22 and a 44-year-old W8 S »
If Roe v. Wade stands for any proposition, it must
stand for the proposition that a state cannot proceed on
that assumption when proceeding on that assumption will do
substantial harm to the interests of others involved.
QUESTION:

Your constitutional argument, Mr

46
Bennett, is exclusively an equal protection clause argu­
ment, is it?
MR. BENNETT:

Your Honor, the equal protection

standards and the due process standards are obviously closely
related *
QUESTION:

Well, is it any part of your .argument

as indeed it seemed to me logically to be part of your
brother*s argument in the preceding case that a state is
under a constitutional dutv to finance abortions quite apart
from whether or not it finances anything else?
MR. BENNETT:

No, Your Honor, we make no such

claim.
QUESTION:

So it is basically an equal protection

clause argument?
MR. BENNETT:

It is a claim of discriminatory

denial of public benefits.
QUESTION:

That are granted to others for similar

MR. BENNETT:

That is correct, for all medically

r.sc* ■:aary procedures.
QUESTION?

It is not your claim that there .is any

duty on the state to finance abortions or indeed to finance
anything for health?
MR. BENNETT:

That is correct, Your Honor.

this is not just any discrimination that the state has

But

47
undertaken here,.
QUESTION:

According to you it is unconstitutional

discriminafcion?
MR. BENNETT:

Yes, but it is not even an ordinary

unconstitutional discrimination because the discrimination
here is against exercise of a fundamental right, a right
that this Court has repeatedly recognised to be fundamental,
that is the woman’s interest in making the abortion decision
for herself.

Illinois —

QUESTION:

But Maher said that Congress could do

that or a state could do it in the first trimester anyway?
MR. BENNETT:
QUESTION:

No —

It said that Congress needn’t fund

elective abortions.
MR. BENNETT:

That is correct and we are not claim­

ing that
QUESTION:

Even though it tresspasses on the re­

sults in the inability, practical inability of a woman to
make her own decision?
MR. BENNETT:

That is correct, Your Honor, but in

Maher there was no discrimination in the sens© that the
equal protectior, clause makes relevant because there was no
jeopardy to the health care interest that the state had de­
fined for itself, whereas here there is disastrous signifi­
cance.

The scat® will fund all other medically necesarv

48
procedures but these it will not, and that is precisely a
discrimination based on the woman's exercise of a fundamental
right.
QUESTION;

Could the Illinois legislature provida

a comprehensive program for drug addiction and not provide a
comprehensive program for alcohol addiction or vice versa?
MR. BENNETT;

It might well. Your Honor, if it had

a rational basis.
QUESTION:

Well, just take it. as it is.

MR. BENNETT;

Well, I would have to know more about

both drug addiction and alcohol -~
QUESTION:

Most of the time state legislatures

don't go to any great extent to telling us why.
MR. BENNETT:

I understand.

Most state decisions

to fund or not to fund are justifiable bv a value judgment
in choosing between two goals.
C ir.

Will, could they make the choice of on©

and rot include the other, that is my guestion?
MR. BENNETTs

I would think they might well b© able

to, without knowing more about the particulars of alcoholism
and. narcotics addiction I hesitate to make an unequivocal
judgment, but my hunch would be that a state could make such
a distinction, and it would be justifiable by the value
judgment that alcoholism is a more significant problem or
less, depending on how the judgment came out, in our society

49
than was drug addiction.

But the state here is acting on

the assumption that this Court has held to be impermissible?
namely that abortion is to be stopped and the people whose
desired abortions the state has chosen to stop and discrimin­
ate against ar® those of a helpless group of indigent citizens
those that the legislative; process most easily can ignore
when it decides to launch upon a discrimination»
Justice Relinquish asked this morning whether one
had to assume thatlegislators were irrational in order to
decide that they had adopted an irrational means to the
pursuit of a legitimate objective.

I would point out first

of all that there is no legitimate objective here.
if there ware a legitimate objective

But even

that the Illinois

legislature had in mind, it is not at all necessary to assume
that legislators may or did have acted irrationally as in­
dividuals in order to conclude that the constitutional test
of irrationality is met.
Eve:: sine® James Madison and probably a long time

before.- our constitutional theorists recognised that a
ic . 1 -

i.7- majority 'world: often be tempted to ignora utterly

the int -rests of a iegitle.fciv© minority and the judgment on
a legislative level that the costs that have been exacted
from a minority ar© too great is what justifies the conclu­
sion.

that what the legislature has done is an irrational

means to pursue even of legitimate objectives.

50
QUESTION:

May I ask —

QUESTION:

That is easy to say in the case of the

Bill of Rights where you can't say that because appointed
counsel costs so much that the state legislature is going to
get together and say we are not going to appoint it and v;e
are not irrational and therefore this is okay.

Obviously

that would be the wrong result because that is' specifically
proscribed in the Sixth Amendment.
When you corns to the equal protection clause and
the standard is the so-called rational basis, then to say
that the legislature has in mind a goal which is perfectly
acceptable but was totally irrational in pursuing it, to my
mind does mean that they belong in the bug house.
MR. BENNETT:

Forgive me, Your Honor, I read your

dissent in Weinberger v. Weisenfeld to reach exactly that
conclusion about the discrimination there.

I don’t under­

stand how a stata could ever have a legitimate objective
and there could be any content to the requirement that 'they
pursue a rational means unless this Court at some level was
willing to make a judgment that the stats had simply gone
too far in exacting costs from a helpless political minority.
X take it that, that is precisely what the rational basis test
both under fcho equal protection clause and under the due
process clause means.
But I would repeat that we are not here dealing

with an. ordinary, even an ordinary unconstitutional discrim
ination hut rather a discrimination against a woman's exer­
cise of her fundamental rights.
QUESTION:

Now comes a question I was about to ask

—• you are arguing, as I understand it, that there is no
legitimate state interest —
MR.. BENNETT:
QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.

— did the District Court in your case

agree with that?
MR. BENNETT:
QUESTION:

Yes, the District Court —

I understood the District Court recog­

nised a legitimate state interest but weighed it against
the interests for which you are advocating.
MR. BENNETT:
5 or

I think the District Court's language

str ad .31 ed the two cone lus ions.

QUESTION:

But you can't point to any language

in the District Court that goes as far as you have gone?

MR. BSNN£?T:

We11, the Disftrict Court did

characterize what the state had done as illegitimate.

It

said it Lad no legitimate interest in favoring potential
life at the ©xnease of.
QUESTION:

No legitimate interest — none of the

leg itiraate interests identified by the Solicitor General?
He identified two primarily, that is the state interest in
bringing a fetus to a normal type birth

ctnd

a stats interest

52
in not expending public funds to further a cause which a
large segment of the population perceives to be an immoral
one.

I am not passing a judgment on those interests.

I am

just asking whether or not the District Court below in this
case found no such state interest.
MR. BENNETT:

Well, all I can say, Your Honor, is

the District Court did not articulate its conclusion in those
terras.

it sub-theoried its conclusion of illegitimacy with­

in its conclusion of illegitimacy, it subsumed an articula­
tion of the interests of the state was ignoring here.
QUESTION:

Did the 1973 opinion say something,

having something to say about the interest of the state in
encouraging natural births and normal term births?
MR. BENNETT:

Roe v. Wade and Do© v. Bolton did

recognise a legitimate stats interest in furthering potential
.life, but those opinions also addressed the balance that a
state was permitted to make in even the third trimester when
the

:

interest was held there to be compelling and

concluded that even in that third trimester a state could
not forbid abortion when that would pose jeopardy to the
pregnant woman’s life or health.

That I think is essentially

equivalent to the exact rationality balance that we are ask­
ing this Court, to make even on the assumption that Illinois ’
interest hare was to further potential life which it was not.
Illinois wanted to stop abortions and it was willing to adopt

53
a health cars funding program to do that because that was
the only means that it saw available to it, and the victims
of that desire are precisely the most helpless of Illinois *
citizens.
QUESTION:
in Maher v. Roe?

What was the state interest involved

We found a legitimate state interest in

that case.
MR. BENNETTs

That is correct» you found a legiti­

mate state interest in furthering potential life —
QUESTION:

That fs right.

MR. BENNETT;
in favor of childbirth.

and in expressing a value judgment
The potential life I am suggesting

is not involved here because Illinois was not actually pur­
suing that interest.
QUESTION:

Does the Illinois record, the legisla­

tive record support your view as to what its purposes were?
MR. BENNETTs

Yes, lour Honor, the Illinois legis™

Xative -record supports that view, but you don't even have to
resort to that.

Illinois in 1975 and again in 1979 adopted

legislation which articulates that view of when life begins
and of fir- interest that it. is furthering and the state in
its brief CMfcr&eas that as a statement of what they refer to
as the state's interest in fatal life.
Mthar-.v. Roe, as you just indicated, spoke • of a
state favoring normal childbirth, and appellants would like

54
to expand that language to include all childbirth and then
claim that Illinois is serving that interest.

But Illinois

has no actual interest in increasing the number of unwanted
births.

Illinois' medicaid program even funds non-1herapeutic

sterilisations.

What Illinois is doing is effectively coerc­

ing indigent women to have abnormal chiJ.dbirths sometimes resuiting in death.
The United States’ argument is that death is okay,
too.

The United States says that it would be perfectly ra­

tional for a state to decide, for the Congress or for a
state to decide not to fund any abortions under its .tied!cal
a8sistaac3 program.
QUESTIONI thought you agreed -that it would ba
perfectly const!tutzonal for a stats to decide net to fund
any health care of any kind?
MR. BENNETTi
QUESTION;

I do agree.

Well, then that is involved there, isn’t

MR. BENNETTs

That is involved there, but deaht is

involved in all sorts of thing's that the states —
QUESTION:

We are all mortal.

MR. BENNETT:

That’s correct, but also all sorts

of judgments to fund or net to fund that a state makes may
have implications for the longevity of the population, but
the equal protecti.on clause insists that we look at the

55
context: in which the state discrimination takes place, for
then the state has itself told us a great deal about the
things that it values and here the state has said for every­
one else health is of surpassing significance but not for
this one group that we will disfavor.

That is a classic,, I

would submit, a classic case of discrimination where the
equal protection clausa test comes into play.
QUESTION:

What, if the Illinois legislature had

said that we will fund all treatments medically necessary
except for rabies and that wa have corae to the conclusion
from evidence that the chances of survival of rabies are

one in a hundred once a person gets it and we just don't
want to spend our money, that a lot of money can ba spent
that way and it just isn't worth it, even though

\m realize

that people might recover, if they .were treated but it would
be only one out of a hundred?
MR. BENNETT;
i n*;

th■■■■;■■

. .n-;

There being no fundamental right.

it fch&'c only the rational basis test would

properly applied and that state interest in sonserv
funds sc as to maximize the health care benefit’ in

its program would b© a.rational, basis.

I take it that his

Court’s decision in Gechildig rested on an analysis similar
to that.

But here of course what Illinois dess costs the

state substantial funds, thus not only exacerbating

the

health problems of pregnant women when they cannot obtain the

56
necessary abortion, but of the health problems of others as
well because the# state actually — the program actually costs
more because of the refusal to fund medically necesary
abortions.

So that justification, even if it had motivated

tli® state, is not available here and, of course, it did not
motivate the state.
QUESTIONs

Illinois —
Is your equal protection argument

cor™

fined to what you submit is unconstitutional discriminatory
classifications of all other health car® and of not giving
health care to in the case of abortions, or is it — do you
refine it as between men and women and between teenagers and
adults and so on?
MR. BENNETT:
•that there is

No, Your Honor, we make no claim

discrimination here? for Instance, though

l would argue that the actual real life impact of discrimin­
ation is relevant to the analysis./
QUESTIONS

But you don't?

MR. BENNETT:

I don't claim any special constitu­

tional scrutiny is involved here bacatas® of a discrimination

on the basis of se».
QUESTION:

I do not thick that there was —
So it is purely a discrimination as

between all other health car® and health car® which Mould

MR, BENNETT:

That, is correct

You confine your equal protection case

to that.
MR. BENNETT:
QUESTION:

That's correct.

Mr. Bennett, I understood you to say

that the program as. a whole costs more money because they
deny funding for abortions.

Does the record establish that

because it is entirely possible that

there would be fewer

— that the number of unfunded abortions doesn't necessarily
mean all those want to full term, there could be abortions
that were obtained by other means.

establishes it.

QUESTION:

Not just a comparison between abortion

and childbirth but the total program is more expensive be­
cause of this exception.
MR. BENNETT:
QUESTION:

That is correct, Your Honor.

Well, that is assuming the same number

of pregnancies.
MR. BENNETT:

No, I don't think it is necessary to

assume —QUESTION:

ht least arguably if this statute is

upheld, there will be fewer pregnancies.

58

MR. BENNETT:
ment.

Yes.

Well, I understand the argu­

Mr. Hardy made that; argument in an Arizona law journal

article that the interveners have repeatedly relied upon,
although I think that in their most recent submissions they
have somewhat backed away from it and perhaps that is a sign
of the weakness of the argument.
QUESTION:

Of course %m don't know but at least

arguably this might inhibit carelessness, might it not?
MR. .BENNETT;

It arguably might, but the amount of

carelessness that it would have to inhibit —
QUESTION:

Who knows?

MR. BENNETT:

Well, but it would have to be enor­

mous in order to make this action not costly for the state.
Mr. Hardy’s argument is based on some studies dons i:i Japan
and in Eastern Europe where abortions were mad© available
freely, not in response to medical necessity, arid ©vssaa
j

tith-a mathematics that he employs comes out a little
strei"'3 '.

Wo address this argument at more length in some

of our briefs in the lowar court and our brief in this Court
does refer to those submissions which are in the record.
QUESTION;

Let roe go back again to the hypothetical

about the program for care of drug addicts.

Would you think

it is reasonable from general knowledge available to every­
body that there is a higher incidence of drug addiction
among the youth and the poor in this country than otl*er

59
categories?
MR. BENNETT:
QUESTIONj

It could be.

Well, it has bears widely stated by many

experts, assume that to be true, and then doss not the denual of drug addiction programs have the seme or similar
equal protection clause that you argue here?
MR. BENNETT:

Ho, 1 don't think so, Your Honor.

The state has to make judgments about some activities that
it rill undertake and others that it. will not.

Here the

state has made that judgment and it is within the context,
within a state defined context that the discrimination takes
place.

If drug addiction problem were part of a larger

whole in which it made sense to view it as an integral part
of that larger whole and the state discriminated against
drug addiction, then we would have the classical equal 'pro­
tection questions presented.
QUESTIONs

Where you say that although the utafce

has adopted 'both the. affirmative part and th® negative part,

the negative part simply is inconsistent with th© affirmative
part?
MR. FENNETT:

QUESTION:

When the state discriminates —

That is what it amounts to, isn't it?

MR. EENNETTs

No.

Here tha negative part I repeat

is in tbs service of an illegitimate interest.

But if wa

ware to assume that it was in pursuit of a legitimate

so
interest, then the state would fos permitted under the equal
protection clause to call upon that interest in order -to
provide the justification for the discrimination.

But the

judgment of whether you have a sufficiently rational relation­
ship to the pursuit of a legitimate interest is one that the
equal protection clause commands'this Court to make.
The United States' understanding of th© equal pro­
tection clausa in the context of a funding program such as
this I submit drains that clause of all human content, .but
legislation serves human ends and its rationality must he
judged in terms of human costs.
If there are no more questions. Your Honors, for
the reasons stated I would ask that the judgment of th© court
below be affirmed•«
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

You have about three

minutes remaining, Mr. Wens©!.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM A. WENZEL, III, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT MILLER ST AL — REBUTTAL
MR. WEFTSKL;

lit. Chief Justice, and may it pleas®

th® Courts
*

We would like to reply to throe points.

The first

point regards the record in th© case below involving th©
effectiveness of alternative treatment.

Th® record does

contain the affidavit of Dr. Jasper Williams, Appendix 9?,

61
and Dr. Williams did state in his affidavit that alternatives
to abortion war© available which were effective and as effec­
tive the state submits that no purposeful discrimination was
intended by the Illinois General Assembly to harm state's
interest or the interests of maternal health.
This is also supported in the appendix at 138 by a
survey put together by the Center for Disease Control? and
that survey concluded that there was ho increase in abortion
related- complications observed after -the implementation of
•the Hyde amendment in the project.
It is the willingness of the State of Illinois to
fund alternatives to abortion which w® believe satisfies
within the- contest of a non-comprehensive medical assistance
program for the indigent, the standard of reasonableness —
QUESTION:

.According to at least on® of the amicus

briefs, that is precisely the constitutional vice of what

."111:

: has don® when it finances sterilization, for cat-

c6.il p X 3 >>

i-lR. WENZELs.

The equal protection discrimination

that I understand th* plaintiffs to h® making is that
Illinois has selected out of all the necessary medical cate­
gories of care solely medically necessary Abortions *

We

have argued. —
QUESTIONS
MR. WENZEL?

And does finance alternatives.
.ibid doe® finane® alternatives,, but

62
that is not an accurate statement of Illinois9 practice nor
is it an accurate sfcat&saenfc of Illinois’ obligations under
the medicaid act.

Illinois can, as this Court recognised

in Beal, select which procedures to fund.

The Court expressly

stated that the state need not fund each and every kind of
care or each and every procedure available.

It is that dis­

cretion within the medicaid program, coupled with Illinois8
reasonable efforts to fund altarnatives to complications of
pregnancy which satisfies the rational basis test for equal
par o'tection purposes.
The second point we want to malts is that contrary
to the suggestions of the Solicitor General, the Hyde amend­
ment is at issue in this case.

It is logically and wa fael

inextricably interrelated with plaintiffs * statutory claims,
it was placed in issue by all of the defendants in their
motions for summary judgment and finally it is before this
Court insofar as the final judgment order on review Incor­
porated. in' the statutory rulings.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Solicitor General.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WADE E. MoCREE, JR., ESQ.,
OH BEHMi? OF TEE UNITED STATES
MR. McCRES:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pl@ass

the Court:
There are two points I would like to make because

S3
I do not wish to permit two assertions to go unanswered.

One

assertion that was made was that the United States says that
death is okay, and I think this was the contention that I
heard.

This of course is not so.

The other related, conten­

tion was that'the United States places fetal life above
maternal life, and that explicitly is not so because the
first exception in the Hyde amendment provides that funding
is available when the life of the mother would be endangered
if the fetas were brought to term.
The second point I wish to make is that since
the entire medicaid act was passed to help indig ants t draw­
ing a line within the program then doasn *t punish any of
them.
With those two comments* w© will rest on cur brief.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

Thank you.- counsel.

The caie is submitted.
(Misrsupon, at Is34 o’clock p.m., the case in the
above-entitl®i matter was submitted.)
