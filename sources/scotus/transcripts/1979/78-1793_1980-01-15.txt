PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will resume argu­

ments in 78-1793? Roberts v. United States.
Mr. Shapiro, you may proceed whenever you are
ready„
ORAL ARGUMENT OP STEPHEN M. SHAPIRO, ESQ« ,
ON BEHALF OP THE RESPONDENT

MR. SHAPIRO:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

ples.se the Court:
After listening to extensive allocutions from
defense counsel and the prosecutor, Judge Pratt imposed
sentence on petitioner explaining that he had considered
the fact that petitioner was a dealer in heroin, that

petitioner was

on

parole from

a prior bank robbery convic­

tion, and that petitioner had refused to cooperate with
the government In identifying the persons who supplied him
with heroin.
We contend that Judge Pratt*s consideration of
petitioner’s refusal to cooperate along with his prior
record and the severity of his offense was entirely proper
and was consistent with Congress’ directive that no limita­
tion shall be placed on the information concerning the
character and the conduct of a person convicted of an
%

offense which may be considered in imposing sentence.
Petitioner’s contrary view is based on the

28
argument that a refusal to cooperate was an exercise of
Fifth Amendment rights and that Judge Pratt punished him
for exercising those rights.
The short answer to that contention is that pe­
titioner never claimed or asserted any Fifth Amendment right
which he may have had.

Throughout the three-year period

that preceded the sentence, petitioner never suggested that
his refusal to cooperate rested on Fifth Amendment grounds.
In addition, his conduct gave no indication that he was
relying on the Fifth Amendment.

When he was first inter­

viewed in 1975, he immediately confessed.

He later pleaded

guilty, first to the charge of conspiracy and later to two
of the substantive counts in the indictment.

Most importantly,

at the time of the sentencing

hearing, defense counsel fully disclosed petitioner’s re­
fusal to cooperate and did not even hint that the extent of
his cooperation should not be considered or that this
subject was immune from consideration under the Firth
Amendment.

Far from invoking the Fifth Amendment, counsel

stated to the court that the petitioner refused to cooperate
because he wasn’t that involved in the conspiracy.
Counsel argued yesterday that everyone must have
known that the petitioner was relying on the Fifth Amend­
ment.

With deference, the District Court would have needed

powers of clairvoyance to recognize that there was a Fifth

29
Amendment claim in this case.

The Fifth Amendment was not

raised as a justification for petitioner's refusal to cooper­
ate until he filed his brief in the Court of Appeals.
This Court has repeatedly held that the Fifth
Amendment is not self-executing and may not be relied on
unless it is invoked in timely fashion.

Petitioner’s argu­

ment; that the Fifth Amendment protects his silence without
any indication of the Fifth Amendment in the District Court.
QUESTION:

Would your position here be different

if he had in his allocution asserted Fifth Amendment rights
not to reveal the sources of his drug supply?
MR. SHAPIRO:

I believe that that would present

a far different question and it would raise a serious con­
stitutional difficulty if petitioner had invoked and relied
on the Fifth Amendment.

That issue can be argued two dif­

ferent ways3 but we submit that the Court need not grapple
with that difficulty in this case where the Fifth Amendment
was never exercised.
QUESTION:

Well, how would you go about asserting

the Fifth Amendment?

Would It be an assertion that would

be retroactive to the time when he failed to cooperate?
MR. SHAPIRO:

He would simply, as the Second

Circuit pointed out in the Vermeulen case, he would simply
advise the sentencing court that he was relying on the
Fifth Amendment and not cooperating

and that this was an

30

Impermissible factor in sentencing, and had he done so I
have every confidence that the District Court would have
taken that factor out of its consideration.

It is a simple

matter, as Judge Moore pointed out in the Vermeulen case,
to apprise the court of one!s reliance on the Constitution
at the sentencing hearing.

A great deal of debate was

focused on the question of cooperation and it would have
been simple for counsel to advise the court that this was
an improper consideration and that the Fifth Amendment
privilege his refusal to cooperate.
QUESTION:

But you're not entitled to invoke the

Fifth Amendment unless there is a real and substantial
probability that the answer to the question will in fact
incriminate you.
MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

That's quite correct.

So just tails manic invocation of

the Fifth Amendment wouldn't necessarily solve the problem
even though you say, and apparently it is conceded, that
didn't take place here*
MR. SHAPIRO:

That didn’t take place here, and

Your Honor is quite correct In pointing out that if the
District Court concluded that there was no realistic ex­
posure to incrimination from this answer and that petitioner
was simply covering up for other persons, which was our
inference all along, that then it would be an invalid

31
invocation of the Fifth Amendment.

-

That is what this Court

held in the Rogers ease and other cases that we cited in our
brief.
QUESTION:

I took it from Mr. Palmer’s argument

yesterday that his chief reliance on this claim was because
fear of some possible consequences of disclosing who his
principal sources of heroin were.
MR. SHAPIRO:

Had he brought that to the attention

of the court, it would have greatly altered the complexion
of this case.

But as this Court has held, it is not suf­

ficient merely to refuse to answer a question or to fail to
provide information.
Amendment.

That is not an invocation of the Fifth

And had he entertained the subjective beliefs

i

he should have advised the court, the court would have no
way of knowing that he was fearful of self-incrimination
under these circumstances.

There was no indication of this

at all from counsel, and he had three years to develop this
theory if he wished to advance it.

We notified him from

the outset that the extent of his cooperation would affect
the charges against him, the amount of time he spent in
prison, and would be made known to the court, and yet he
never invoked the Fifth Amendment until this theory occurred
to him in the Court of Appeals when he put this argument
into his appellate brief.
QUESTION:

Suppose a witness is called in any

32

-

ordinary criminal case and he declines to answer on the
ground that if he gives information he might be placing him­
self in jeopardy of retaliation by the defendants or friends
of the defendants, is that a sort of de facto assertion of
the Fifth Amendment?
MFU SHAPIRO:
the Piemonte case.

This Court held that it is not in

In Piemonte the Court concluded that

fear of retaliation and one’s physical safety is not the
same as a fear of self-incrimination and that it is the
duty of the government to protect persons against retalia­
tion, and we do indeed have a system for doing that, the
witness protection program.

If this had been explained

to the government or to the court, steps could have been
taken to protect petitioner if that was his concern, but
no one was ever advised that this factor was a concern on
his part.

Other co-conspirators in this conspiracy did

assist the government arid did testify against persons who
were higher up in the chain of the conspiracy, and there
was no retaliation.

If petitioner had been fearful of this,

he should have apprised the court and the prosecutor, but
this was never raised.
As this Court pointed out —
QUESTION:

Suppose there were a codefendant who

was not asked to cooperate, is he to be treated more harshly
than one who is asked to cooperate and does it only

33

-

partially, or less harshly?
MR. SHAPIRO:

I would think that a person who has

not been asked to cooperate could not be faulted for failing
to come forth with information and that would not be an ad­
verse circumstance to take account In sentencing, whereas
somebody xvho provides some information but stonewalls the
government as to the rest of it would be turning his back
on the request and that would reflect on his character and
his attitude towards society.
In the first Instance that Your Honor has posed,
where there has not been a request, I think it is difficult
to fault that individual for not coming forward with the
information.
This Court pointed out in the Vajtauer case -—
QUESTION:

Mr. Shapiro, before you get to that,

did I understand that if he had said before the sentence
that the reason I was quiet was because I was asserting my
Fifth Amendment right, that the judge could not have used
that material, is that your position?
MR. SHAPIRO:

Our position is that that would

present a very serious difficulty.
QUESTION:

I am reluctant to say —

Oh, I thought you said that under these

circumstances he would not have done It.
MR. SHAPIRO:

He may ’well have not considered

that, but I don’t want to —

34

Is it your position that ha could do

it?
MR. SHAPIRO:

It Is my position that that is a

cently handed down —

QUESTION:

raised the Fifth Amendment points ignore the -—
MR. SHAPIRO:

There is a strong argument that he

could have done it, although that question hasn't been de­
cided by this Court, of course, and there are -—
QUESTION:

Well, is It your position that the

court can take Into consideration his silence?

MR. SHAPIRO:

After he has pleaded the Fifth

Amendment, if the court views that as a refusal to cooper­
ate,. which is essentially the same as standing on one’s
right to —
QUESTION:

What do you mean by cooperate, that a

man charged with a crime is bound to come in and say, one,
I committed the crime and, two, everybody that helped me
and, three, everybody that might have helped me?

How far

does he have to cooperate?
MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, this is a reflection in our

view on his attitude towards society.

If he Is unwilling

to Identify the persons who continue to inject heroin into
the community and continue to cause this injury to the

35
community, even though he has that Information, we submit
that that is an adverse reflection of his character.
QUESTION:

Well, would this be true for embezzle­

ment, too?
MR, SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

It would.

It would.

Well, why do you have to say Injecting

heroin in?
MR. SHAPIRO:

Because it reflects on the man’s

character, his —
QUESTION:

But you don't really mean a separate

law for —
MR. SHAPIRO:

We don’t need a separate law for

that, I agree with Your Honor.
QUESTION:

I assume that.

MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

As the court —

If there was an assertion of the

Fifth, the judge would still have to find that there is
some realistic —
MR, SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

Yes, he would.

— danger of incrimination that

compels self-incrimination.
MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

That's quite correct,

And.in order to sustain it, you would

have to say that — when you ask him to cooperate and you
tell him that if you don’t this is going to be taken into

36
consideration, and. he says, well, I will spea, you have to
assume that that is compulsion.
MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

Is that right?

Well, if his —

If you assume that his compulsion —

I don’t know why you wouldn’t just say then that taking this
into consideration is a penalty for his remaining silent.
MR. SHAPIRO:

Yes, but this Court has held in an

analogous situation, in the Corbitt case, that taking into
account someone’s unwillingness to waive their Firth Amend­
ment rights and go to trial is something that can be taken
into account in sentencing.
QUESTION:

I know, but I just wonder if the judge

would — in order to sustain his Fifth Amendment claim, he
would have to say that there was compulsion involved and
that the threat or the likelihood of taking that .into ac­
count amounted to legal compulsion.
MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

Well, that is correct.

Then how do you square that with Corbitt?

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, my understanding is that under

Corbitt it is permissible to impose differential sentences
when one does insist on a right to go to trial and to grant
lenience to those who do not insist on that right.

And in

Your Honor’s hypothetical, if the individual refuses to
cooperate, relying on the Fifth Amendment, I would think
that that would be analogous to the person who say3 I’m iiot

37
going to plead guilty, I'm going to stand trial, where the
court has agreed that differential sentencing is proper,
But I would reemphasize that that is not the issue here
because there has been no indication of the Fifth Amendmentc
This is an interesting and difficult issue but it simply is
not posed here,
QUESTION:

Well, tell me where the compulsion

would be?
MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

It would

If he Invoked it and said I was silent

because I didn't want to incriminate myself, what is the
compulsion?

He never said anything.

MR. SHAPIRO:

That's correct, there is no compul­

sion testimony -—
QUESTION:

He never said anything, there was

never any testimony.
MR. SHAPIRO:

But it would arguably be a penalty

imposed on him for not cooperating.
QUESTION:

Because of compulsion or —

MR. SHAPIRO:

It would Just be an additional

sentence attached to his lack of cooperation, but that
arguably is what was approved in court,
QUESTION:

Then I don't see why it makes any

difference whether he tells the judge if he relied on the
Fifth Amendment or not.

He should just say I was silent

,

38
and you can’t penalize me for it.
MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, I would agree that I think we

might be able to win this case even if the Fifth Amendment
was pleaded under the Corbitt precedent, but here it is an
a fortiori case because the Fifth Amendment was never
raised and this Court has held repeatedly that before the
Fifth Amendment can be relied on in the Court of Appeals,
it has to be asserted in the lower court.
QUESTION:

Is there any constitutional right to

maintain silence about criminal activity that is known to
the person in question —
MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

Certainly —

-— unless it will bring compelled

incrimination of himself?
MR. SHAPIRO:. There is no such right and in fact
there is a federal criminal statute, 18 U.S.C., section A,
that provides that it is compounding of a felony or mis­
prision of a felony to fail to report and to conceal the
occurrence of crimes by other persons, and this conduct of
petitioner treads very close to that.

Without an invoca­

tion of the Fifth Amendment and simply withholding the
information that was in his possession, that is —■QUESTION:

But- he wasn’t charged with that.

MR. SHAPIRO:

He was not charged with that, but

we say it reflects on his character and it reflects on his

att5.tude towards society, just the way the perjury in the
Grayson case reflected on the -—
QUESTION:

Let me get to another one.

If a

defendant in a criminal trial, and the judge calls him to
the witness stand and he says I}m not going to talk, does
he have to say I'm not going to talk on the basis of my
constitutional right not to testify?

Does he have to say

that in detail?
MR, SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

He doesn't have to —

Does he?

MR„ SHAPIRO:

He doesn't have to use lawyers'

language.
QUESTION:

You can't even call him, can you?

MR. SHAPIRO:

He doesn't have to use lawyers’

language<,
QUESTION:

So why does he have to, on the Fifth

Amendment, say at every stage of the proceeding that I am
asserting my Fifth Amendment?
MR. SHAPIRO:

As this Court has held repeatedly

in the Rogers case, in the Vajtauer case —
QUESTIO?!:

A minute ago I asked you about this

case;.
MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

When was he obliged to say I am relying

on the Fifth Amendment?

40
MR. SHAPIRO:

At the sentencing hearing he was

obliged to say I rely on the Fifth Amendment or I am rely­
ing on my right to refuse to incriminate myself.

He has to

fairly apprise the tribunal of his reliance on that con­
stitutional privilege.

He doesn’t have to use a particular

kind of lawyer's language, hut it isn’t enough just to say
I’m not talking.

The Court has held that repeatedly.

QUESTION:

Well, isn’t that what the Fifth Amend­

ment gives him the right to do —
MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

— not to talk?

MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

It is not self-executing.

It is not self-executing.

What does it say?

MR, SHAPIRO:

It says that no person may he com­

pelled to be a witness against himself in a criminal trial.
QUESTION:

That means talk, doesn’t it?

MR. SHAPIRO:

But this Court has held repeatedly

that there must be recitation of the Fifth Amendment.
QUESTION:

Suppose he didn’t say anything, still

he would be bad off, wouldn’t he?
MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

If he didn’t invoke it, his —

You are putting on him a duty to come

forth, aren’t you?
MR. SHAPIRO:

And invoke the constitutional

privilege, and this Court has held that that is the

41
requirement of the law consistently over the years.
QUESTION:

And you want us to say here chat from

now on every defendant who is relying on the Fifth Amend­
ment must make it clear to the court that he is relying on
the Fifth Amendment.
HR. SHAPIRO:

Precisely.

He would be leading

the court into an error if the rule were anything else, be­
cause he brought the court's attention to his cooperation
and gave a totally different explanation for his refusal.
He said he was not that involved in the conspiracy.
asked the court to consider it.

He

And if he didn't then and

there assert that this shouldn’t be a permissible factor,
he was simply leading the court into error and to raise it
for the first time in the Court of Appeals to us is just a
ploy.

It is leading the court into error and —
QUESTION:

Could I test your question?

I wonder

if it necessarily must rest entirely on the Fifth Amend­
ment.

I notice neither of the questions presented are

framed in constitutional terms, and I suppose the court
would have some supervisory power ever the factors that
could be considered.

Supposing in a case, this was a

crime of using a telephone to facilitate1the distribution
of narcotics.
HR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

That's correct.

Supposing the government intercepted

42
40 or 50 different telephone conversations and they con­
cluded that this man was just a runner of some kind who
would normally be entitled to a sentence of six months or a
year or some first offender and so forth.

Could the judge

say to him at sentencing, I know that you know who the
higher-ups are In this and if you don’t tell the prosecutor
who they are, I am going to give you thirty years because
there are thirty different Instances and I can make consecu
tive sentences out of them.

Would there be any legal ob­

jection to the judge doing that?
MR. SHAPIRO:

The outer limit is prescribed by

the Eighth Amendment and I submit that in Your Honor’s
hypothetical —
QUESTION:

Assume it is not a violation of the

Eighth Amendment.
MR. SHAPIRO:

If it is not a violation of the

Eighth Amendment —
QUESTION:

Is it proper sentencing procedure for

the judge to get Involved in the investigatory process in
that way?
MR. SHAPIRO:

Yes, we submit that it is, if it

is within the statutory limits.

Congress has prescribed

expressly that all information bearing on the conduct and
the character of the individual can be considered.

And if

there is no statutory objection under thd relevant penal

43
statute, no Eighth Amendment harrier to piling on the punish­
ments,, then this is a proper procedure.

But I would point

out that there is no element in this case of threatening the
defendant and negotiating with the defendant by the court.
The Seventh Circuit has approved a course of behavior similar
to what Your Honor described.

That was the rule in the

Seventh Circuit and we have cited the Seventh Circuit’s de­
cisions in our brief.
QUESTION:

But it isn’t up to the government in

the sense that the government is the prosecutor to prescribe
the sentence for a convicted defendant, is it?

It is up to

the judge.
MR. SHAPIRO:
that is quite correct.

It is up to Congress and the judge,
And if petitioner had within his own

mind any mitigating information that he wanted to bring to
the attention of the judge, he was permitted to do that
under the rules and he made an extensive allocution.

And

if any of these concerns that he is raising for the first
time on appeal were concerns that troubled him, any fear
about self-incrimination or fear about retaliation, he
should have presented them then and there.

That is the

only way that the District Court could have known of these
concerns.
QUESTION:

Earlier in your argument, Mr. Shapiro,

you referred to the statute which defined broad powers in

the sentencing judge to take into account everything.
Is the date of that statute?
MR. SHAPIRO:

1970*

What

When was that enacted?
That is part of the compre­

hensive -—
QUESTION:

The omnibus.

MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Now, did that add anything to what

this Court said in Williams v. New York?
MR. SHAPIRO:
rule in Williams.

It was merely a codification of the

The legislative history shows that

Congress meant to adopt the standard that this Court had
prescribed in several of its prior cases, Including
Williams.
Laying aside petitioner's after-thought arguments,
it Is possible to see this case as it was presented to
Judge Pratto

Petitioner stood before the court as a con­

victed heroin dealer.

He had distributed heroin and had

previously been convicted for bank robbery.

He had also

been, convicted for unauthorized use of a motor vehicle as
well as larceny.

He was on parole for his prior bank

robbery convictions when he was arrested once again for
dealing in heroin.
In addition, he stood before the court as a man
who refused to cooperate.

Although petitioner in amici

argued that this had no logical relationship to the length

45
of sentence to be imposed, we submit that it was a highly
relevant datum, along with the other information available
to Judge Pratt.
was,

It showed what kind of a man petitioner

It was part of the mosaic of information that re­

vealed his character and his attitude towards society.

It

showed who he wanted to protect and who he was unwilling
to protect.

It showed that he still adhered to the code

of conduct of the criminal conspiracy, not the code of
conduct that society recognizes.
The prosecutor's repeated requests to cooperate
presented a chance for petitioner to turn over a new leaf.
It is beyond dispute that heroin causes addiction of
members of the community which not only ruins many lives
and causes large numbers of crimes, but it actually results
in deaths of persons who overdose on heroin.
Last year, in the District of Columbia, 4l persons
died from heroin overdoses.

In short, dealing in heroin

is a highly antisocial act.

The prosecutor gave the peti­

tioner a chance to mitigate the harm which he had done by
stopping the other persons who continued to inject heroin
into the community.

It was an opportunity to break off

his prior pattern of behavior, an opportunity that he re­
jected.
Petitioner's refusal to help make amends for the
harm which he had done was one of many indications that he

was a poor prospect for rehabilitation.

As Professor Hart

has correctedly pointed out, rehabilitation requires recognition of the community's interests and the obligations of
community life.

Refusal to cooperate also suggested that

a substantial period of imprisonment was needed to protect
the community„

By refusing to cooperate, petitioner showed

that his allegiance with his co-conspirators was unbroken,
an association that could be easily resumed on his release
from prison.
Although petition at amici had argued that non­
cooperation should not be considered, we submit that this
statute that the Chief Justice referred to is direct
evidence to the contrary.

It says that there shall be no

limits on the information concerning the character and
conduct of the person convicted of an offense which may be
considered in imposing sentence.

This Court has approved

that principle repeatedly in its own decisions.

Most

recently, in the Grayson case, this Court emphasized that
the sentencing judge should consider the whole range of
information bearing on a convicted defendant's character
and his attitude toward society.

Failure to cooperate with

the authorities in stopping persons who continue to dis­
tribute heroin within the community is certainly relevant
to the appraisal of the defendant's character and his
attitude toward society.

47
We note that at common law there was a duty to
raise the hue and the cry to alert the police to the oc­
currence of crimes by other persons so those crimes could
be stopped.

And under the modern penal code it is compound­

ing or misprision, a felony not to report felonies and to
conceal felonies by other persons.
Petitioner’s unwillingness to realign his in­
terests with those of society and his determination to
conceal the actions of those persons who prey on society
was a facto)? that the sentencing court could not properly
ignore in making a responsible evaluation of his attitude
and his character.
Petitioner and amici have advanced the rather
surprising argument that the extent of a defendant’s co­
operation is relevant in granting leniency but is not
relevant in enhancing punishment.

We say that this is

surprising because it presupposes two levels of punishment
based on the convicted defendant’s willingness to cooper­
ate and to name his accomplices.

This theory would open

the door to precisely the result that petitioner opposes.
Within statutory limits, consecutive sentences could be
imposed on those persons who do not cooperate and concur­
rent sentences could be reserved for those who do and show
their entitlement for leniency.

This procedure, like the

procedure that petitioner opposes, would place substantial

pressure on convicted defendants to name their accomplices
to avoid additional prison time.
We

ntend that there is no logical reason why

defendant's refusal to cooperate should not be relevant in
imposing sentence, whether the decision is characterized as
increasing punishment or withholding lenience.

If the sen­

tence is within statutory limits, if the defendant has had
the opportunity to cooperate and if he has had the oppor­
tunity to plead any applicable constitutional privilege or
present any mitigating information that he may possess to
the District Court, and if he doesn’t take any of these
act j.ons 5 his uncooperative conduct is properly judged at
face value along with the other information available to
the judge.

It sheds light on the question of whether the

defendant is willing to recognize the obligations of com­
munity life and whether he continues to pose a threat to
the community.
QUESTION:

Mr. Shapiro, let me just think

through again the Fifth Amendment point.

Are you saying

that — you are not saying, I take it, that he must plead
the Fifth Amendment when he’s being interviewed by the
prosecutor before the sentencing hearing?
MR, SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

Not at all.

You are saying at the time of the

sentencing hearing he has to tell the judge that the reason

49
he previously did not cooperate was because of a Fifth
Amendment concern.
MR. SHAPIRO:

That's correcto

Our point is that

when the judge is considering these factors and petitioner’s
counsel is adverting to them before the court, he has a duty
to at least advise the court that this is an impermissible
factor because of the Fifth Amendment.

Counsel is there for

that very purpose, to raise constitutional or any other
legal objections to these considerations.
As the Court reaffirmed in the case of Dorszynski
v. United States, "If there is one rule in the federal
criminal practice which is firmly established, it is that
the Appellate Court has no control over a sentence which is
within the limits allowed by statute." This Court has ap­
plied that rule in narcotics cases where substantial con­
secutive sentences were imposed by the court.

The Gore

ease and the Blockburger case are examples.
The Senate imposed by Judge Pratt fell squarely
within the limits prescribed by Congress; limits that
Congress contemplated would provide maximum flexibility to
the judge, permitting him to tailor the period of imprison­
ment as well as the fine to the circumstances of the par­
ticular case.
From a common sense point of view, the sentence
v imposed within these limits was not a severe or a

50
disproportionate one.

Judge Pratt required petitioner to

serve only two years before becoming eligible for parole
and he declined to impose any fine of any kind.

For a con­

victed heroin dealer who was already on parole for a prior
conviction for bank robbery, this we submit was a very
lenient sentence.

In our view, there is nothing here that

would tempt an appellate tribunal to disturb the sentence
imposed by the District Court.
For these reasons, we respectfully request that
the decision of the court below be affirmed.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.

Do you have anything further, Mr. Palmer?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLAN M. PALMER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER — REBUTTAL
MR» PALMER:

Just briefly, Mr. Chief Justice and

members of the Court:
Counsel*s waiver argument bears no relationship
to the facts for this reason:

From the first day the pe­

titioner walked into the government's office, he was
advised of his Miranda rights and he refused to testify
or cooperateo

This Court had said that refusal or silence

Is an Indication that the man intends to rely on his Fifth
Amendment rights.
these proceedings.

He did that for three years throughout
Never until the day of sentencing did

51
the government ever urge lack of cooperation as a sentencing
factor, therefore there was no reason for the defense or the
petitioner to urge it because the government had neveralleged it, and that is the reason why the issue came up
for the first time on appeal after the judge had injected
it into the case.
QUESTION:

The statement you referred to was made

in the context of the person being interrogated after arrest
and while in custody, was it not?
MR. PALMER:
QUESTION:

No, Your Honor.
The interrogation was stopped as soon

as he indicates that he doesn’t want to talk?

Isn’t that

the context of that statement?
MRe PALMER:
QUESTION:

The statement of Miranda?
Yes.
t

MR. PALMER:

Well, Miranda dealt in that sense

but in any event, regardless of whether he is under arrest
or not, if he is warned and relies on that warning to re­
frain from saying anything, whether you say he is in
custody or not, the result is the same as we see it.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you. gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 10:36 o’clock a.m., the case in
the above-entitled matter was submitted.)
