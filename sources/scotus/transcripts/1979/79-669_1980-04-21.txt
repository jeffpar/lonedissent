MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Conley, I think now

you may proceed whenever you are ready.
OPAL ARGUMENT OF NED L, CONLEY, ESQ„,
i*

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. CONLEY;

Ilr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
I would like to illustrate the issue in this case
;

with the following:
Two people discover that two different chemicals can
:

be used as herbicides to kill weeds in ricefields.
chemicals both kill weeds perfectly satisfactorily.

These
One of

the chemicals had no other known use and that is the kind of
chemical we call in this case a non-staple material.

The

other chemical also has other known uses as, for example, maybe
it could be used making a dye.

This is called a staple material

in this case.
The contention of the respondent Rohm and Haas in
this case is that one of these inventors whose discovery uses
the non-staple material should receive a greater reward for
no reason other than that the material has not previously been
known to have a use.

Rohm and Haas' patent is on a method

!

for killing weeds in ricefields bv spraying a chemical called
I
propanil on those weeds and on the ricefields.

Now, propanil

,

“

is not patented.

Monsanto Company received a patent on propanil

4
in 1968 and they sued Rohm and Haas for infringement of that
patent and Rohm and Haas proved that the patent was invalid,,
that propanil had been known for a long time.
Mow, Rohm and Haas doesn't practice its patented
invention, which is in the method for using propanil.

Instead,

since they are a chemical company they manufacture propanil and
they sell it.

And there are instructions on the containers

for using the patented method.
By virtue of this the purchasers, the farmers who use
this and spray it on their ricefields have an implied license
to use that patented method.
In addition to this, Rohm and Haas has refused to
grant licenses to these farmers in any other way.

If idle

farmers want to use the patented process the only way they
can do it is to buy the unpatented propanil from Rohm and
Haas,

Otherwise, they are infringers.
Nov;, the petitioners in this case sell propanil, too.

They sold it long before the Monsanto patent issued in 1968.,
Our containers also have labels on them which give instructions
for using the propanil on ricefields.

We are required to do

this by lav;, by the EPA,, because otherwise people might misuse
it and cause harm.
Because of this Rohm and Haas sued the petitioners
on the patent, on the day it issued in 1974.
for summary judgment.

We filed a motion

This motion was granted.

In its very

j
5

thorough opinion the District Court held that using a patent
to obtain a monopoly in propanil, which Rohm and Haas did not
invent and which was not covered by the patent, was a misuse of
the patent„
QUESTION:

If you will notice the last page of

Judge Gee's opinion in the Fifth Circuit at page A-48 of
the petition for certiorari he quotes Judge Richards, saying
that

I think he says himself these are the kinds of cases

that are argued by professionals to amateurs.
And so you may take my question in that light.

j

Is it fair to say that both the doctrines of
contributory infringement and patent misuse are to a certain
extent the obverse sides of the same coin, neither of them are
the substance of the patent or what can be patented?

One

is trying to expand what is patentable and the other is
enabling the patentee to police the patent?
MR. CONLEY:

I believe I can say a qualified "Yes"

to that, because certainly the doctrine of misuse is a doctrine
that grew out of attempts by patent owners to expand the
patent grant beyond something or to use the patent in such
a way as to obtain a control which the patent grant in and
of itself does not grant them.
Whereas, the doctrine of contributory infringement

\

was a doctrine which grew up for the purpose of allowing patent­
ees a way to-enforce their patents to prevent infringement

6

in situations where it was impractical to file suit against all
of the individual direct infringers.
Does that answer -QUESTION:

That would be particularly true in

combination patents, wouldn't it?
MR. CONLEY:

Yes, that is primarily true in the case

of combination patents but I believe it is also applicable in
the case of the type of patent we have here, which is a patent
on a method of using a chemical.
Now, Rohm and Haas agrees,and I think the Court of
Appeals decision agreed, that the owner of a patent on a
method which uses one of these staple chemicals cannot compel
those people who want to use the patented process to buy the
staple chemical from the patent owner.

But the Court held,

this Court of Appeals held that Section 271(c) and (d) were
h

enacted by Congress for the purpose of authorising the patent

j

'

owner to monopolize these non-staple materials.

That was the

|
effect of their decision.
As agreed by everyone who has filed a brief in this
case that 271(c) and (d) were enacted as an outgrowth of the
decisions by this Court in the two Mercoid cases in 1344, in
those cases this Court found there was patent misuse by onewho sold a non-staple element of a patented combination, the'
type that you just discussed, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, who
licensed, ss the patentee did there, uother people to sell

7

this unpatented element and they sued contributory infringers
who made and sold the unpatented, element without a license.
QUESTJON:
MR. COWLEY:

Was that a staple or a non-staple?
It was a non-staple; it was conceded to

be in that case.

j

The Court went further then and raised the question
as to whether this decision left anything at all of the law of
contributory infringement.

Because of the

j

well, at least

unrest that this caused there was great effort made again to
get a statutory lav; of contributory infringement enacted.
And such a law was enacted, one which specifically defines in
subsection (c) a contributory infringement is, in effect, the
selling without a license from the patent owner of the non­
staple material.
And then subsection (d) was enacted which said that
those specific things, that is the selling of the non-staple
f.

S

material, the licensing others to sell, and the suing of people

f

who sell it without license, that those things would not be

!

misuse and that such a patent owner who was doing these things

|
S

would not be held guilty of misuse if he was otherwise entitled

j

to relief.
QUESTION:
MR. CONLEY:

Were they conjunctive or disjunctive?
In the statute it says if you do anyone

of these or any combination of the three.
Well, the Mercoid case did not involve merely the

I\

8

selling, the licensing and the suing, it involved a great deal
more.
In the Mercoid cases this Court repeated the longstandiiig rule limiting patent monopolies to the inventions
defined by the patent claims.

Nov;, that rule has been around

probably since the patent law was first enacted in 1790 or
when claims were first thought of in about 1836.

It was held

to be misuse in the Mercoid cases for a patent owner to
condition a license under his patent on the purchase of an
unpatented element.

And the Court specifically held that that

rule applied to non-staple materials or elements as well as
to staple materials or elements.
Now, there is nothing in Sect-on 271 or any other
part of the 1952 Act which recodifies the patent laws which
changes those specific rules of law which were the real basis
for the decision finding misuse in the Mercoid cases.
Instead, to the contrary, the recodification included
Section 154 which defines the scope of the patent grant as
the right to exclude others from making, using or selling the
invention.
propanil.

It is conceded that Rohm and Haas did not invent
That is the way the law has always been and it was

continued without dissent in the 1952 statute.
QUESTION:

Iut the question is whether the doctrine

of contributory infringement has been reintroduced and .Mercoid,
in effect, either sharply cut back on or overruled by the

Ii'

9
5

congressional Act, is it not?
MR. CONLEY:
correct.

Yes, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that is

The real issue, I think, is just that, as to whether

or not in 271 that the doctrine of contributory infringement
was restored.

And the reason that that question arose was

because there was a serious question as to whether it existed
at all.

And so the arguments were made to the congressional
!

committees that we had to have a statory statement of
contributory infringement so that this Court would recognize
that Congress wanted patent owners to have a right to sue
contributory infringers.

I$

And that is what Congress did, is

enact a statute that says it is 0,K, to sue contributory

1)

infringers.
But the patents, the patent grants the exclusive
rights only to the invention, and 2.71(b) did not say, or 271(c)
did not say that the patent owner has exclusive rights in the
non-staple element or component of the invention.

That grant

is stated in Section 154, which says it is just the invention
*
that the exclusive right extends to.
QUESTION:

}

Suppose the invention requires the use

of a non-staple material and you say the patentee has a right
to his invention.

Does he have the right to license the

invention even though he uses a non-staple material?
MR. CONLEY:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, he does.
And does he have a right to refuse it?

I
i

10

MR. CONLEY:

To refuse the license?

Yes, sir, he

has the right to .refuse a license, generally speaking.
QUESTION:

Well, how can you work it both ways?

Does that apply to this case?
MR. CONIEY:

It is contended'by siorae that the

patent owner has a right to refuse licenses and that What we
are trying to accomplish here is to compel him to grant a
I

license.
QUESTION:

I

Yes, that is what it sounds to me like.

I mean in a way, it sounds that way.
MR. CONLEY:

Let us put it this way:

A patent owner

has only two ways that he can profit from his invention.

One

, of them is by practicing his invention himself and the other
!

one is by licensing other people to do so.

Rohm and Haas

has chosen to license other people to do so.

They don't want

to practice this invention, they have said so.
Nov;, they want one more thing.

They want to profit

1

also by monopolizing the material used in the practice.

Now,

that is the third thing that they have done and they have
accomplished this by refusing to grant the license except in
connection with the purchase of the material.
Nov;, what that does is to coerce —
QUESTION:
MR. CONLEY:
QUESTION:

Has your client asked them for a license?
Sir?
Has your client ever asked them for a

11

license?
MR. CONLEY:

The dav we were served we asked for a

license.
QUESTION;

And they said, no, we won't give you a

license?
MR. CONLEY:
QUESTION:

That is right.
Would you take one if they said, yes, we

will give you a license; but, for a small fee?
MR. CONLEY;
QUESTION:
MR. CONLEY:
QUESTION;

Sure.
You would pay a reasonable royalty?
We told them so, and we still would.
So you do think that they must grant you
:

a license?
MR. CONLEY:

No, I don't think they must grant us

a license.
QUESTION:

Do you think you have the right to sell

it without a license?
MR. CONLEY:

I do, because of their —
I

QUESTION:

If they refused to license you, you claim

|

you can sell without license?

I
MR. CONLEY:

I say that we can sell it to farmers

whora they must grant an alternative.
QUESTION:

I sa/

Well, suppose in suing you they said we

offered them a license and they refused?
MR. CONLEY:

They said they offered the farmers a

12
license?
i

QUESTION:

No, no.

•MR. CONLEY:
QUESTION:

You.

Oh, they offered me a license.
Your client a license.

Suppose they said,

this suit is because we have this patented process using a
non-staple material; we offered a license to XYZ and they
refused it.
MR. CONLEY:

They would have a right to sue us.

Yes, j

sir, I agree they have a right to sue us.
QUESTION:
CONLEY:

And —
Because if we sold it then we would be

It sounds to me like you are saving that

MR.CONLEY:
alternative.

No, only that he has to give the farmer an

It is just as though I were in the business of

selling two different commodities and -QUESTION:
MR. CONLEY:

How dees he give the farmer an alternative?
By merely telling him that if he wants

to practice the invention by use of propanil, purchase from
someone else, then a license is available.
QUESTION:

This case could end up, I suppose,

theoretically at least, that you lose but the other side loses
too, in a sense that they have to give you a license?

j

MR. CONLEY:

Mo , I don’t think there is any loss

there, because they would receive — by either party, because
they would receive exactly what they are entitled to, and that
is the royalty that they would -QUESTION:
MR. CONLEY:
QUESTION:

You mean you v/ould both win?
We both win, right.
But they have no bargaining power under

your theory?
MR. CONLEY:

Oh, no, they can set the royalty as high

as is necessary —
QUESTION:

All they have to do is offer you a license

at a reasonable royalty and if you refuse it, you are in
trouble?
MR. CONLEY:

If we refused it and they continued to

make available to the farmers a license alternatively to the
one tied to the purchase of the material, yes, we would be
in trouble.
QUESTION:

They have no bargaining power with the

fanners?
MR. CONLEY:

Mo more does any other patentee of a

patent which uses staple materials.

If he decides to sell

his staple materials, he has no bargaining power, he puts in
the price of his material 15 cents of this price is a royalty,
if you want to buy the material somewhere else v/e will grant
you a license

QUESTION:

But dees propanil have any use except in

this combination patent?
MR. CONLEY:

For the purpose of this case it is

conceded it has none.
QUESTION:

Do I correctly understand that you, in

effect, agree that you are a contributory infringer, the issue

j

j

i

is whether there is misuse?
MR. CONLEY:
QUESTION:

j

Yes, sir, that is right,
That is the only issue?

MR. CONLEY:

Yes, sir.

Now, I think the essence of what I was trying to say
a moment ago is that Congress didn’t include in the statute
any right to monopolize.

Now, they could have done so, they

could have changed Section 154 or they could have put another
provision in Section 271, or something else, perhaps, that
would explicitly provide what Rohm and Haas contend is provided \
l

by implication in here.

I submit, that the implication that

they seek is explicitly negated by the words "otherwise entitled
to relief" that are in Section 271(b).
Now, the committee reports that were issued by the
congressional committees following the hearings that were

held, show that there was no intent to change the lav/.

15

QUESTION;

There were some other statements, too,

made by Senator McCarren -MR. CONLEY;
QUESTION;

Yes, sir.
— saying that there were some changes.

MR. CONLEY:

Senator McCarren said when asked

generally on the floor of the Senate, this statute — Title 35
as.. a whole, he .was talking about
it merely codified the lav;.

did not make any changes,

And then he inserted into the

record, by unanimous consent, a prepared statement whichincluded in it the general statement that due to some court
decisions there were some changes made.
happened.

And that is all that

It was immediately after that there was a vote,

without any recess, and the statute was enacted.
all that took place.

And that is

lie did not point directly to Section 271

or specifically he did not say that it was intended to expand
the patent grant to allow a. monopoly of something that the
patentee didn't invent.

I think he would have said so if that

is what he had intended to do.

I don’t think he would have

answered it that way.
QUESTION:

Uhv is your client willing to

take a license from the patentee and pay him some royalty?
MR. CONLEY:

We have some advantages, I think,

over a large corporation like Rohm and Haas„

We can cut the

cost some and still make a profit and get by without — and
pay the royalty, too.

QUESTION:

And the misuse that you talk about is

at least in part the fact that they refused to give you a
license when you offered it?
MR. CONLEY:

Specifically, Mr. Justice White, the

misuse is in the coercion of the farmers, the conditioning of
the granting of a license on the sale and the purchase by the
farmer of this unpatented material.

And that is all it is,

that is all the misuse is.
QUESTION:

How do they enforce that?

MR. CONLEY:
QUESTION:

Sir?
How do they enforce that?

Is that easy to

enforce?
MR. CONLEY:

Oh, I see no problem there, really.

It

is done all the time.
QUESTION:

IIow do they do it?

MR. CONLEY:

Well, one of the things that we suggest

because it is commonly used, even by Rohm and Haas itself, is
a label licensing program where they apply to the label of
their can a statement that the price includes a royalty and
if they want to purchase elsewhere, well, such licenses are
available„
We as people who manufacture and sell the product
would be more than glad to handle the paperwork and so forth
to provide the license.
The price is not going to be very much different

i

17

as between competing suppliers of the material, so there is
!

h

probably not going to be anv enforcement problem at all.
Undoubtedly, their patent would go right on for the full 17

i
I

years and they would receive their royalties all the time.
QUESTION;

So to avoid the misuse, quit coercing the

farmer and also give you a license?
MR. CONLEY:
way.

Or give the farmer a license, whichever

Or they can decide that they are going to do all the

application themselves, they can practice their own invention,
There is nothing to prevent them from doing that.

[
j

Mow, I

understand why Rohm and Haas doesn't want to; but they could
do it.

And then they don't have to grant anybody a license.
QUESTION:

What is involved in practicing their

invention?
MR. CONLEY:

Oh, buying some spraying equipment and

going around and spraying farms.
QUESTION:
MR. CONLEY:

•:

Ir
j

Exactly.
How, there was a great deal of discussion

I
by -- in the briefs about some testimony at committee hearings
on this bill.

The testimony on early bills —* not in this bill,

;

r

.

.

but on earlier bills — did indicate there was an intention

j by at least one of the witnesses — Mr. Rich, who is now Judge
i
Rich --- to allow the precise type of activity that we are
questioning in this case.

And by 1951 hearings on the bill

that passed finally, Mr. Rich did not make any such statement

;

I
1V

IS
In fact he — when asked directly, he refused to confirm, that
that was his attitude.
QUESTION;

Were his earlier statements directed to

the same statutory language?
MR. CONLEY;

The language was slightly different but

the meaning was in essence the same, I think.
This Court has on at least six different occasions
/

since 1952 made statements that the rule of law of the Mercoid
cases still applies.
The Aro cases are the most significant.
two of those, one in 1261 and one in 1964.

There were

And the 1961 case

it was held that although the ..misuse defense had been weighed
in that case the Mercoid cases were still good authority on
the scope of the patent.

And the Court held that the claims

of the patent were the sole measure of the grant and a patentes
was not entitled to any monopoly on the elements of the
invention.
£

QUESTION:

Well, they did involve contributory

.infringement?
~
MR. CONLEY:

I

Yes, there were contributory infringe­

ments .
In the second Mercoid case there was a specific
situation —
QUESTION:
MR. CONLEY:

You say Aro —
Aro --- the second Aro case, there was

19

a specific situation where Ford had a license, which they passed
on to their customers, which allowed customers to use the
patented combination .out only if they bought the unpatented
fabric from Ford»
QUESTION;
MR. CONLEY:

That was a convertible top.
Convertible top, that is right; that was

te case.
And this Court held that that was an invalid extension
of the patent in that particular case, that they were not allow­
ed to do it and would not enforce it.
Now --QUESTION:

Do you disagree with Judge Gee's analysis

of those two cases and references to Mercoid?
MR. CONLEY:

Well, I agree with what Judge Gee

finally concluded, and that is that on the whole those cases
cut against his opinion.
QUESTION:

Right.

Plow about the more detailed

analysis?
MR. CONLEY:

I don't know specifically what you are

referring to.
QUESTION:

Well, I take it, you know, you have read

his opinion?
MR. CONLEY:

Yes, I certainlv have.
lie devoted three or four pages of his

opinion to the analysis of Aro 1 and Aro 2 as he called them.

I

20

MR. CONLEY.

Yes.

I believe that his analysis

generally was fairly accurate.

I do not think that he treated

the Ford license situation to which I just .referred, though.
If I may, I would like to reserve the remainder of
my time.

Mr. Hutz.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RUDOLF E. HUTZ, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. HUTZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
I believe that, the fundamental question before the
Court is whether or rot the language of the 1952 Patent Act

j

and, in particular, Section 271 approves of Rohm and Haas'
conduct in this action.
Nov/, the Court of Appeals in a lengthy, -detailed
and, I think, scholarly analysis unanimously held that Section
271 did in fact approve of Rohm and Haas' conduct.

And we
■

submit, needless

to say, that that decision is entirely

i

correct and should be affirmed.
§

And I think as Mr. Justice Rehnquist mentioned, that

i

basically what we have involved here and as the Court of
Appeals also recognized, we have a clash between two principles
We have the principle of the patent laws which attempts to
stimulate innovation and protect inventions on the one hand.
And we have a clash with the concepts of the patent misuse

1

21
doctrine on the other»

And in principle those two concepts
§

are antagonistic and logically they cannot coexist one with the i
other.

I
ij

That conflict is precisely what was presented to
Congress when it debated whether or not to pass what is now
Section 271.

The Mercoid decision had drawn the line with

respect to that conflict and it had drawn that line on the
side of misuse almost to the exclusion of the law of patents.
And for the next four years people attempted to draft an
Act that would move that line to more of a middle road
position and for the next four years through three separate

\
hearings, many,debates, Congress attempted to draw that line
in a manner consistent with public policy as Congress perceived'
it.
Prior to Section 271 it of course had been the

j

courts that had drawn the line and now it was time for Concressjj,,
I
1
if you will? to try its hand at drawing that line. Congress
e
determined public policy and it drew that line dependent upon

the distinction between staple and non-staple articles.

a non-staple, supposing instead of just making periodic sales
of implied license to the user you entered into a long-term,
say a ten-year license with a farmer,giving him the right to
use your patent for ten years.

And you said as a. condition

of that license you may only use with propanil purchased from
us .
Would that be misuse?
(

MR. HUTZ:

It could well be a misuse in the sense

i
ii

that the extent of the license may continue beyond the point
at which propanil is a non-staple.
QUESTION:

Well, assuming that it is known in

advance that propanil will continue to be a non-staple for
ten years?
MR. HUTZ:

I am not sure how you know that in advance

but the question — if your question basically is could we do
it by an expressed license the --

MR. IIUTZ:

What we are doing now is we are granting

no licenses, as I think is clear.
QUESTION:

An implied license?

MR. IIUTZ:

Well, it is called an implied license, it

is actually —• it goes back to an exhaustion of the monopoly.
We sell the product propanil, that is all we do.

We do not

issue any written licenses, we don't state there is a license
on our label.

As a natter of law, when we have sold that

propanil we are no longer able to exercise any control over
it, because it has —
QUESTION:

Well, I understand.

But for purposes

of trying to decide whether there is a misuse -- I don't know
whether there is -- you are saying the case would be the same
on a misuse issue if there were an express license and if the
express license were conditioned on the purchase of an un­
patented product from your client?
MR. HUTZ:

If the express license 'was the equivalent

of what we are doing here I would say there is no misuse.
QUESTION:

Right

24

MR. HUTZ:

Once you begin to talk about a long-term

and other factors there may be something in addition —
QUESTION:

Well, isn't that the whole issue in the

case, because 271 they concede there is contributory infringe­
ment.
MR. HUTZ:

Yes, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

And nothing in 271 expressly covers the

kind of case we are talking about, so the question really is
whether this is a misuse when it is a non-staple item.

And

I don't think it has been decided before, as far 1 can see.
MR. HUTZ:

Your Honor, I would take issue with your

statement, because I believe that Section 271 does expressly
approve of what we are doing, because it expressly states
there shall ■—■ I am talking about. 271(d) now.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. HUTZ:

It expressly states that there shall be

no extension — illegal extension of the monopoly and no misuse
if the patentee engages in three specified acts.

It can be

any one, two or three -QUESTION:
a misuse.

It says none of those three shall create

It doesn't mean that if you do those three you are

exempted from something else which would constitute a misuse.
MR. HUTZ:

That is correct.

QUESTION:

The question is whether the something

else, namely granting a license on condition that ycu buy only

t

the product, is a misuse.

That is the question, and that

isn't discussed here.
MR. IIUTZ:

In this particular case that we have before

the Court the only acts that Rohm and Haas is doing — are
doing is exactly what is spelled out in Section 271id).
(1)

271(d)

savs "derive revenue from acts which are performed by

another without his consent would constitute contributory
infringement."
We do that, we sell propanil.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. IIUTZ:

My worthy opponent has conceded that if

we were to do it and not be the patent owner we would
contributorily infringe.

;

’We we have done that act.

The second thing that we have done is we have sought
— which is

(d) (3)

-— we have sought to enforce the patent

right against infringement or contributory infringement.

We

brought this suit.
We are of course able under Section 271(d)(2)

to

license or authorize -—■ says you can license cr authorize -and we have authorized in the sense that the law implies a
license, or more specifically, says the remedy is exhausted
at the time that we sell.
Now, I think it is very important to note, as I
believe Mr. Justice Rehnquist said, that the Act says one or
more of the following.

26

MR. IIUTZ:

It can be (1), (2) or (3j .

There is

•

nothing .in Section 271 that suggests that in order to sell
under (d)(1) we must license under (d)(2) and yet that is
precisely what the petitioner's position is here.

They are

saying if you want to take care, if you want to carry out the

act specifically provided, namely deriving revenue from acts
which are performed by another, you must license.

basically what they

QUESTION;

There are things besides those three things?

MR. IIUTZ:

I would suggest that we are not.

QUESTION:

Well, aren't you still telling farmers

in (d) ?

I don't use our patent except in connection with our propanil?
MR. IIUTZ:
farmers, Mr. Justice.,

Effectively we are saying nothing to the
We are selling the propanil and those
I

that obtain the propanil through us, the monopoly, if you will,
has been exhausted as far as that sale is concerned.

j
.1

I?■

The other thing that we are doing is we are exercising
a right which I feel that we have, Section 154 indicates that
we are, and that is we are not licensing expressly anyone.
We have the right to refuse that, we have always had the right
to refuse that.
QUESTION:

What is the basis for the claim that you

are letting people practice your patent but only on condition
that they buy an unpatented material from yon?

■
If

21

MR. IIUTZ:

Well, that of course is the position which

my worthy opponent makes.

But the fact of the matter is we

are selling the propanil, exhausting the monopoly as to that
product.

And then if we are asked whether or not we will grant

express licenses, we are of course at this time saying that
we wish to exercise the optional right given to us under
271(d)(2), we license or authorize or not.

And I would submit

that Congress was well aware of the argument which petitioner
is making in this case and Congress recognized that the effect
of this would be an extension of the patent grant.

And so

Congress specifically stated that it will not be an illegal
extension of the patent grant if one does any (1),

[

2

)

or (3)

of these acts.
iI

Now, the ability to carry out the steps that Rohm and
Haas has done in this case was fully explained to the judicial
subcommittees that heard debate on these acts.

One of the

very first things that was said in the course of the hearings,
— at page 4 of the 1948 hearings transcript — it was pointed
out that a necessary effect of the doctrine of equivalence is
to give a patentee the right to exclude others from doing acts
which would constitute contributory infringement of his patent
if done without his permission.

And necessarily contributory

infringement involves a measure of control over something that
is outside the literal scope of the claims.
QUESTION:

Do you contend that your sales of propanil

are to the ultimate consumer of the product?
MR. HUTZ:

Mo; no, they are not, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist, they are to distributors.

But the distributor
jf

acquires the right to resell and his customers obtain the
|

right to use because as to the product we have sold the
monopoly is gone.
QUESTION:

We can exercise no control whatsoever.
Was there any dispute over that in the

District Court?
MR. HUTZ:

Not as far as I know.

That was recognized ;

by the District Court and of course it was recognized by the
Court of Appeals.

The District Court’s problem was that it.
!>

couldn't understand why Section (d) (2)

I am sorry, (d) (3)

had any relationship to (d){2}, and of course that was corrected
by the Court of Appeals because contributory

I am sorry, I

have misstated.
The District Court could not understand why the rights
that you acquired under (d)(2) related to Section 271(c),

And

of course it must be a contributory infringement before either

\
i

(d) (1) or (d) (2) even comes into effect.

But

QUESTION:

How widely available is propanil?

MR. HUTZ:

Today?

It is sold by Rohm and Haas, it

is being sold by petitioners and •—
QUESTION:

The ordinary farmer?

MR. IIUTZ;

I don't believe there is any inability of

the farmer to obtain access to propanil if he wishes to use it

\

on his fields.

There are other competitive products.

There

are» I believe, six or eight other herbicides.
QUESTION:

VJhat I am trving to get at is what I

addressed in the form of a question to your friend and I am
not sure I understood the answer.

I am sure his answer was

1

clear but that didn’t mean I understood it.
You have this licensing.

How can you assure that

the condition in your licensing is carried out?
MR. HUTZ:

Well, we can only that, Your Honor, by

looking at others who produce propanil.
9,000 rice farmers.

There are approximately

There are approximately 3,000 aerial

applicators who would be practicing directly the method of our
patent.

And this is one of the fundamental problems when

you are dealing with a patent of this kind is trying to enforce
it.

If you had to go out and cry to license all 9,000 farmers

or license all 3/030 applicators it would cost you more to
*

I

get the licenses, in all likelihood, even if you could get the

■
1

farmers to agree to it.

|

So as a practical matter the only way you can enforce j
your patent and maintain your exclusivity is through the
doctrine of contributory infringement which permits you to go
to the source, if you will, of the infringement.

It should be

kept in mind there is no legitimate competition at che present
time in propanil.

By its very definition as conceded, anytime

you sell propanil you are guilty of contributory infringement

30

under Section 271(c)

and because of the definition of

contributory infringement the sale of propan.il by the
petitioners necessarily leads to a direct infringement.

That

is the whole basis of the distinction between staples and
non-staples.

With staple products there is a legitimate

existing business outside of the patent.
is not.

With propanil, there

It has no other use except to infringe.

Propanil

of course was known from back in 1903 as a chemical compound
but for 50 years it had no use, it was a laboratory curiosity„
it was of no benefit to mankind.

Rohm and Haas, through the

expenditure of a lot of research dollars and development
dollars and obtaining approval from the Government, developed
a specific use for propanil which has been a great benefit to
rice growers, to farmers and the public in general.
They created the market for propanil and today, some
20 years after the original disclosure and knowledge and
invention, the only use of propanil remains in the patented
invention.

And for so long as it remains a non-staple, namely

j no use other than as an infringement, we believe in accordance
with Section 271 that we are entitled to the conduct and the
activity which we have carried out today.

And that activity

and that conduct was known to those who considered the Patent
Act,
My opponent has said that in the early hearings — I
assume he is referring to the IS48 and the 1949 hearings —

.

that Hr. Rich, no1/ Judge Rich, who was a speak on behalf of
the Act indicated that that was the intention of the language.
That is very clear, he did indicate and stated specifically
that it was.
Nov;, the language has not changed in any substantial
manner from the time it was first presented in 1948 until the

f

present day when it was enacted as Section 271.
Not onlv did Judge Rich indicate that tills was the
1

intended raeaninc or one of the intended activities tnat would

|

be permitted without it being a misuse but tne Justice
Department vigorously protested the passage of Section 271.
Thev testified in 1349 and they testified in 1951 and in !49,
(
]

page 2, they said that enactment would enable tne patentee to
exercise control over the unpatented materials usable in his
patent process and oust from tne marketplace his competitor
dealing in the same material.
QUESTION:

That was their basic criticism.

Hr. ilutz, don't opponents of legislation

have a historv of a parade of horribles saying how bad this is
going to be when perhaps the actual enacted language does not
involve all the things they think it does?
HR. IIUTZ:

I think you are right but 1 tbinK you

have to keep in mind that I don't nelieve tnere was any
dispute between the proponents and tne opponents or even tnose
that were considering the Act that that would be permitted.
The issue was whether or not public policy would permit you

j

32

to —
QUESTION:

Were they not then talking about tributory

infringement; and is it not true even if it './ere feasible —■
and I understand it is probably not — to license farmers,
about 3,000 licenses to farmers, so there would be no claim
whatsoever that you are misusing the patent, then you could
still sue these people for contributory infringement under
this bill.

And the Justice Department didn't want you to even

be able to do that.
MR. HUTZ:

I would submit that the Justice Department

was accurately stating that exactly the conduct we are doing
today would be permitted.

And Judge Rich agreed with that

and, indeed, the members of the subcommittee agreed with that.
A statement was made interpreting the Mercoid decision.
QUESTION:

Well, am I not correct in what I said?

MR. IIUTZ:

I may have misunderstood the question.

I am sorry.
QUESTION:

Even if there were no basis for a claim

of misuse here and, as I say, I don't know whether that is a
valid basis, say you had a licensing program and you just
licensed the farmers.

And your competitor sold the product

to those farmers, knowing it had no other use.

You would

then clearly be able to hold them liable as a contributory
infringer and they would have no misuse defense.

And the

Justice Department didn't want you even to be able to hold

33

then liable in those circumstances.
MR. ilUTZ:

I an sure they didn’t want us to do that

under those circumstances.
QUESTION:

What I ara suggesting is that their

opposition to the bill didn't necessarily address itself
specifically to the misuse question.

It addressed itself to

the contributory infringement.
MR. IIUTZ:
misuse.

I would submit it was directed to the

And I started to respond to your question with

reference to the Mercoid decision.

There were a lot of things

decided in Mercoid but one of them dealt with the situation
in which licenses were granted only with the sale of a non­
staple and the Justice Department recognised that.

For example

at page 54 of the '49 hearings thev characterized the Mercoid
decision, and if I may indulge, it said:
"Instead of meeting its competition in
traditional ways it sought a competitive advantage
by permitting those who bought its switches to
use them in the patented combination, whereas those
who bought the switches elsewhere were subject to
attack for infringement and these who sold switches
were sued for contributory infringement.
And that is a characterization of the Mercoid

,

facts which can be found at 320 U.S. 676 in the concurring
opinion of Justice Frankfurter.

Co that one of the evils, if

34

you will, of Mercoid was exactly the alleged evil that we have
here, and it was recognized as such.

And Mr. Rich was

questioned whether or not that wasn't a fundamental reason for
the Mercoid holding, and he agreed.

And Mr. Rich was asked,

well, would that behavior be permitted under the Act?
the answer was '‘Yes."

And

Very clearly, "Yes."

So I would submit that the Justice Department has
raised in 1948 and 1951 exactly the arguments that were raised
here and fundamentally Congress faced that question, Congress
was faced with a public policy decision:

Where do we draw

the line between these competing doctrines?
And it drew that line.

It drew that line after

very, very careful consideration with all of the opponents and
all the proponents and all of the consideration that went into
that wording.

And as I stated earlier, the wording remained

remarkably the same from the time the Act was first introduced
in 1948 until today.
And I would, respectfully submit to this Court that
the decision by the Court of Appeals is eminently correct.
was a scholarly analysis, yes, they weighed things.

They

said, well, if we look at it through the lens of misuse we
reach one result.

If we look at it through the lens of the

patent lav;, we reach another result.

It was very careful

balancing.
What my opponent has done is to select certain

It

35
portions where the Court was doing the balancing and has
ignored what the Court ultimately held.

And what the Court

ultimately held was there is no obligation to compulsorarily
license your patent. . What the!COURT held was Section 271 permi t
you to do one or more of the defined acts.
you to license in order to sell propanil.

It doesn't require
The effective

result of reversing the Court of Appeals would be a compulsory
licensing.
My opponent claims that it would not be.

I would

respectfully submit that it is and it was recognized to be the
result of compulsory licensing by the Court of Appeails as
well as by the lower court.
If there are no questions,, I thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Bernard.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EUGENE L. BERNARD, ESQ.,
AS AMICI CURIAE
MR. BERNARD:

Thank you, .Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
I represent a number of amici here today and without
equivocation my comments favor the respondent.
The essence of rnv comments are that the patented
herbicidal use of the non-staple,per se unpatentable; propanil,
should not be subject to compulsory licensing, for public
policy reasons and for statutory reasons.
The amici I represent are all nonprofit organizations

36

they are all significant participants in what we label the
research,, development and commercialization processes.

From

the agricultural sector is the National Agricultural Chemicals
Association, the Ag Association for short.

Its 120 member

companies produce,, formulate and sell most of the pesticides
in the United States.
Propanil, a herbicide, is a specific type of
pesticide.

The ag business is big business and. it is high

I
technology.

For example, there are $32 billion of agricultural

products exported a year.

And the high technology character

of agriculture is set out in the Ag Association brief in
Section 1.
:

QUESTION:

Hay I just ask, you agree with respondents
■'

generally.

Do you specifically agree with the view that a

long-term license of a non-staple on condition that the

i

product be bought exclusively from the patentee is not a
misuse?
MR. BERNARD:

It is not a misuse, Your Honor.

is a practical factor to this.

There

For example, there are the
*

.9,000 rice farmers and, in addition, that is complicated
further by the fact that they just don't spray this, they use
-

aerial applicators to spray the propanil.

There are 3,000

aerial applicators, using 36,000 aircraft.
This gats us to the hub of the contributory infringe-:
i
ment doctrine. There are three petitioners. The hub of the

37
contributory infringement doctrine is that it is impractical
to go after these 9,000 farmers plus 3,000 aerial applicators»
But it is practical to stop the contributory infringers.
And Congress in section 271(c)

and (d) was explicit with

respect to non-staple articles.

The significance of the non­

staple article is that it creates a market.
monopolv.

It is not a

A monopoly means that there is something there

before that was taken away.

In this case it is an exclusive

right provided under Section 154 of the statute and that
statute says that every patent shall have that right to
exclude.
And as you go further with that on the economics of
this, the plain fact is that the price of rice is determined
on the commodity market.

Propanil is a tool for the farmer.

If he doesn't to pay that price or if he thinks it is
excessive, he then doesn't buy it.
QUESTION:

Does this mean that the patent becomes

substantially worthless if the product ceases to be a nonstaple?

Say so3Tiebody discovers another use for propanil, then

is the patent no longer of value?
MR. BERNARD:

Well, the patent is of value.

I think,

we are dealing with -QUESTION:

I thought you just explained that you

really as a practical matter could not enforce it, except by
controlling the sales?

38

MR. BERNARD:

:

No, as a practical matter when there

are contributory infringers in that group —
QUESTION:

They are infringers as soon as the product

ceases being a non-staple.
QUESTION:

Once other uses for propanii .are found,
i

then anybody could freely sell propanii without being a
contributor or infringer.
Correct?
MR. BERNARD:

That is a contention.

that the lav/ lias gone that far yet.

I am not sure

We do know that the lav/s,
i

namely 271(c)

and (d), are explicit on the non-staple.

And a
i
\;

good reason for it being explicit on the non-staple is that
there is no other market -!

QUESTION:

Well, what if tills were salt ox* sugar?

MR. BERNARD:

Well, let us draw an anology with salt, ji

Take the Morton Salt case, where vou had a device, just to draw j;
the line on patentability items.

In Morton Salt there were

{

.

salt tablets but the item that was patented was a device.
There is no restriction on the salt tablet per se.

And so

the Court back then said, well, look, it is misuse to try to
control that salt tablet.
Nov/, let us take a step closer,

let us take the
I

situation in Mercoid.

There is a combination there, and there
[

is a stoker switch.

That stoker switch was said to have no

other use than in that combination.

39

QUESTION:
MR

Right,

BERNARD:

But nevertheless that stoker switch

was unpatented.
Now, take the case of propanil.

Propanil is not

patentable per se, as a compound.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. BERNARD:

But its use is patentable.

It use is

patented.
QUESTION:

Well, in this method patented.

MR. BERNARD:

Yes,

But its use is patented as

distinguished, say, from the unpatentability of the stoker
switch in Mercoid.

The use of that switch per se was not

patentable.
QUESTION:

Well, as a component of the combination

it was patentable.
MR. BERNARD:
QUESTION:

Only in the combination.

Not an exact analogy.

MR. BERNARD:

No.

Buc that is quite different than

the patented herbicidal use of propanil that we have here.
QUESTION:

You are suggesting it is possible that

even if propanil was a staple that you could prevent people
from selling it if the purpose cf the sale was to use your
invention?
MR. BERNARD;
QUESTION:

Yes.

I think —

Rather than trying to monopolise the sale

40

of a staple generally.
MRo BERNARD:
1

yet to be developed.
QUESTION:

Yes, I think that is an area that is
For example, may I draw this —■

I thought the teaching of the briefs was

that we learned from. 271 that Congress wanted to draw a very
clear bright line between staples and non-staples.

You say

that is not -MR. BERNARD:

Congress did draw a very clear line

between staples and non-staples.

And it said in the connection

with non-staples that while using this contributory infringe­
ment doctrine that it wasn't subject to misuse if you did
the three things that he enumerates in Section (d).
QUESTION:

None of those should constitute misuse?

MR. BERNARD:
QUESTION:

Yes.

It did not say, though, that a long-term

license on condition is not a misuse?
MR. BERNARD:
QUESTION:

Well --

What you said, I think, is if you do

anyone of those three things you are not guilty of misuse.
And that is a little different from saying that none of those
three things constitute misuse.
MR. BERNARD:

None of those three things constitute

misuse, per se.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. BERNARD:

And that is what the statute said?

Yes.

Well, the bottom line on the amici is that they are
all involved in the research and development and commerciali­
zation activity and that they are all concerned about having
this non-staple, per se unpatentable chemical,as a resource
for their activities.

And the significance of it as a

resource is, Point 1, there are 10 million conpunds.
that with 50,000 in commerce.

Compare

Point 2, in a survey conducted

in 1975 of the 33,600 compounds that were considered to have
been included in major chemical developments, 8,400 were those
that new uses were found for.

Point 3, the universities --

researchers at universities and elsewhere want to publish and
in publishing they frequently publish compounds that are in
the early stages for which they have no known use or utility.
And by having/ this patent protection available, as you move
down the line this gives an opportunity to promote further
work with respect to those then useless chemicals.

And in

Item 4 within the area of the pesticides, a survey conducted
in 1972, 20 percent of the pesticides had no use other than
this use protection.
And the character of the investment and high risk
involved here, for example to get a pesticide approved requires
going through the EPA.

And in going through the EPA, there
I

is much experimental work required and it runs over several
|

years.

The year factor is eight years at a cost of roughly

$15 million-plus.

Now, that eight vears also comes out of the !

42

patent grant.
But in looking at the character of the protection
provided, in dealing with patents we are talking about subject
matter and conduct.

The subject matter is defined by the

claims but then before that patent is granted it is screened
by the Patent Office to insure that it meets the conditions
of patentability.

And patents are classified in several ways.

One of them is in products, per se,

Another is in the use

patent which is set forth in 100(b) and 101.
with the 1972 Patent Act.

100(b) is new

It interrelates with Section 271

and in this interrelationship it also interrelates to Section
154 that says every patent shall have this right to exclude.
I thank you, Your Honor.

MR. CONLEY:

And he has stipulated that he refuses.

It is stipulated,it is one of the facts of this case that he
will not grant any licenses except with the purchase of
propanil
QUESTION:
MR. CONLEY:

Where is that?
It is in the stipulation that was filed

before the motion for summary judgment was granted.
QUESTION:

Well, that is not inconsistent with the

language of the '52 Act of Congress,' is it?
t

MR. CONLEY:
QUESTION:

What is that?
You say his refusal to grant a license.

46

MR. CONLEY:

It is inconsistent when you look at

all of the cases that carne before.
QUESTION:
came before.

I am not talking about all the cases that

I am talking about the '52 Act of Congress.

MR. CONLEY:
not inconsistent?

That the refusal to grant a license is

It is, sir, if you understand the law of

patent misuse and apply the law of patent misuse.
QUESTION;

Well, but patent misuse sterns from

Mercoid and the question —
MR. CONLEY:
QUESTION:

No, sir, that is, not correct.,
Well, from Gatlin v. Leeds and so forth,

but it reached its apogee in Mercoid.
MR. CONLEY:
developed out of the

It did not.

The law of patent misuse

lotion Picture case — I beg your pardon,

sir, it developed out of the Motion Picture case v/here this
Court specifically limited the scope of a right to exclude
to the invention that was made.

And in the Carbice case in 19

was 'when they first said well, it becomes a misuse of the
patent, that the patentee is now allowed to take his license
that he has, his right he has to license people, and tall
the people who buy from him an unpatented material that they
can only have that license if they buy the patented material
from me.
The Leitch v. Barber case then came along in 1942,
I believe, or * 38, and said it doesn't make any oif /.erencs

47
whether he expressly says that you must buy this material from
me to get a license or whether it is merely implied by the
fact that you refuse to grant anv licenses except with the
purchase of the unpatented material.
Nov;, we had the. Morton' Salt case and we had the
B.B. Chemical case and the same theme was repeated every time
and they never said it is limited to staples, they never said
it made any difference what the nature of the unpatented
element was in ary of those cases.

But the patent owners,

they kept on pushing, pushing, pushing, until they finally
got to the Mercoid oases,

And the Mercoid case made explicit

what had been certainly not excluded from any of the previous
decisions, and that is that it applies regardless of the
nature of the component.
QUESTION:

And the '52 congressional enactment was

intended to either overrule or limit Mercoid?
MR. CONLEY:
QUESTION:

It was intended to clarify —
Well, you can call it. clarify but certain!

there wouldn't have been that legislation had it not been for
Mercoid and its predecessors.
MR. CONLEY:

If it had not been for the statements

in Mercoid to the effect that what there may be left of the
doctrine of contributory infringement we do not stop to
consider,

If that language had not been there, I seriously

doubt if we would be here today.

Because I think that through-

48

out the legislative history it is very clear that what they
want to do is to straighten out the confusion that had been
generated.

One District Court held that it was a misuse of

the patent to just file a suit for contributory infringement.
Now, Mercoid didn't say that.

But that was the fear and some

of the courts held that.
QUESTION:

Mercoid left very much in doubt whether

there was anything left of the doctrine of contributory
infringement?
MR. CONLEY:

Yes, sir; indeed, it did.

So they put three specific things in.

They put

first a specific definition of contributory infringement and
three specific things that they say are not misue, or any
combination of those.

But they didn't say anything about

extending the scope of a patent beyond the scope of the grant,

i

which Mr. Justice White said in at least three opinions that
he wrote, I know, that you can't do.

And those are since 1952.1

The Aro cases made very clear you couldn't do
that.

i

Deepsouth was one of them, there was the BlonderTongue case and there was one other one — what is that other
j:

;
QUESTION:
MR. CONLEY:
QUESTION:

But all those were scope of patent cases.
Yes, sir.
Contributory infringement and patent misuse

49

are both how you remedy-type cases.
MR. CONLEY:

No.

We are talking about scope of

patent, that is what we are talking about here today.

We are

talking about an attempt to obtain a monopoly which is outside
the scope of the invention.

What they invented was a method;

they didn't invent propanil, they never discovered it.

The

Constitution says you can grant patents to inventors on their
discoveries.

They didn't discover propanil, they admit they

didn't.
QUESTION:

But there is no question that Congress —

accepting the Commerce Clause definition of Wickard v„ Filburn,
Congress needn't rely on the Patent Clause to grant everybody
that comes up with an invention a patent on it.
MR. CONLEY:
they haven't done so.

I don't know of a single case when
And what we are trying to find here

is that implication from a statute, that that was what their
intention was.

Surely they have got to show that Congress

at sometime or other made a patent grant or passed a statute
which allowed patent rights outside of the scope of the
Constitutional specific authority.
QUESTION:

It is a question of which authority

Congress might have been acting under, just like in the Civil
Rights Act of 1954.

Was it the enforcement provisions of

Amendment 14 or was it the commerce power?
some said the other.

Some said one,

I think this Court said it didn't make

50

any difference.
MR. CONLEY:

It probably doesn't.

But there ought to

at least to be some indication by someone and not the offhand
remark that no, it doesn't even change anything, like Senator
McCarren said, or certainly they wouldn't put in their
carefully prepared committee report that the intention was
clarification, if that had been their intention to do some­
thing they had never done before, and that is grant a patent
right outside the scope of Article 1, Section {a), Clause (a).
QUESTION:

You say that there is just not fourth

paragraph in (d).
MR. CONLEY:
QUESTION:

There is not a fourth paragraph in (d)„
That says you may condition the use of

your invention on the purchase of a..non-staple material.
MR. CONLEY:
QUESTION:

Precisely.
Which you say is what is happening here

and which is outside the protection of (d).
MR. CONLEY:

And since that is precisely what

Mercoid held, was a. misuse.

If Congress had wanted to reverse

that precise holding, wouldn't they have put in a fourth
part in (d)?

It seems logical to me that they would nave.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
The case is submitted.

Thank you, gentlemen.
