ORAL ARGUMENT OF HARRY L. SHNIDERMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OP THE PETITIONERS
MR. SHNIDERMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and if the Court

please:
.

We are here for a second time on a petition for
certiorari from the Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia and for the second time that court has placed its
District Court on a collision course with the District Court
[

for Delaware and with the Third Circuit„
u
10
A

The petitioners here are twelve television m&nufacturers which furnished information to the Consumer Product
Safety Commission with respect to television related accidents.
The respondents are prominent consumer groups who have sought
access to that data.

e
3

In early ’75» the Commission notified all interested
parties that it was prepared to release the data, and shortly
thereafter the twelve manufacturers brought suit in four

)

District Courts. Most of the suits were brought in the
•
Delaware District Court; the balance were brought in other
District Courts not in the District of Columbia.
i

|

5
Temporary restraining orders were promptly obtained
and the non-Delaware cases were transferred to Delaware with
consent.
In May '75, about two weeks after the manufacturers
filed their suitss the requesters brought a suit in the
District of Columbia against the Consumer Product Safety Com­
mission and joined the manufacturers as defendants.

The

District of Columbia suit was fairly promptly dismissed by
Judge Ritchey in September of *75.

He found a lack of a case

of controversy between the requesters and the agency because
the agency stood quite willing to release the documents when
not enjoined from doing so.

And he found a failure to state

a claim upon which relief could be granted as against the
manufacturers because no documents were being sought from the
manufacturers.
In October '75, Chief Judge Latchum entered a oreliminary injunction in the Delaware case.
QUESTION:

He —

Mr. Shniderman, since so much of this case

seems to depend on procedural history and so forth, was the
theory of your case in Delaware solely a reverse POIA ease or
was It partly a Chrysler-type case that there was some protec­
tion given to providers that couldn't be furnished regardless
of v/hether an agency wanted to or not?
MR. SHNIDERMAN:

Well, it was really a — I guess in

view of Chrysler, it is clear that a reverse POIA case is

6

really —
QUESTION:

Thera is no such thing —
'

MR. SHNIDERMAN:

— there is no such thing.

It is a

very convenient shorthand way of describing the Chrysler kind

reversed the decision below and directed the case to proceed
on' the merits, in spite of the Delaware preliminary injunction.

This Court granted certiorari, summarily vacated

junction»

Now, in that proceeding the respondents in this

case appeared as amicus curiae on a procedural issue, and the
Consumer Federation of America, of which at least one requester

I

is a member, appeared as an amicus on the merits.
The Delaware case thus Is final except for a pending
petition for certiorari filed by the agency in this Court.
Now, the court below in this case first found that
there was a case of controversy with respect to the effect of
the then preliminary and final judgment, the injunction.
Second, it failed to find, failed to discuss the argument that
had been made by both the agency and by us that there had not
been an improper withholding of the documents within the mean'

ing of the Freedom of Information Act because the agency was
willing to produce the documents but was injoined from doing
so.

j

And third, it concluded that neither principles of comity

nor collateral estoppel preclude the District of Columbia from .
going forward.

I

Indeed, in its second opinion the District of
Columbia Court advised and directed the trial court to consider
whether It may enjoin the manufacturers from enforcing the inv>

junction in Delaware in the event the injunction were disobeyed.

4 :

And it also commented or class action opportunities for
I

j

joining all requesters, a technique whieh had been espoused by
neither side and to this day is not espoused by either side.
We rely on three wholly independent arguments for
urging reversal to this Court.
simple and it is this:

The first ground is quite

The Freedom of Information Act, in

section 552(a)(4)(b), provides a requester with access to a
District Court which is given jurisdiction, in the words of
the statute, to order the production of any agency records —
and here are the key words — improperly withheld.
We have here a permanent injunction which bars dis­
closure of the records whieh the agency would willingly pro­
duce .

It is a sufficient basis for this Court to dispose of

this case in its entirety simply to rule that the documents
are not improperly withheld in the circumstances when the
agency is permanently or indeed temporarily enjoined from
producing them.

The injunction must obviously be obeyed un­

less or until it is vacated.
QUESTION:

We would have to say, I suppose, that the

requesters had a right to intervene in the Delaware action
and to appeal the injunction against disclosure?
MR. SHNIDERMAN:

I would suppose they would have had

such a right and they still may have such a right.

That is

something that this Court would have to decide, whether bhey
have waived that right or not.
QUESTION:

I mean if we were to lay down a general

legal
MR. SHN1DERMAN:

Of course.

Of course, certainly and

they had every opportunity to do so at all levels, as I i*ould
point out.
Now, the entire orientation of this act — and I am
talking about the Freedom of Information Act now — is to
restrict unbridled administrative decisions.

No one before

has ever suggested that the agency is required to defy court
orders.

The act is directed at agency conduct, it is not

directed at courts, it is not directed at court restraining
orders blocking record production.
In Chrysler, this Court recognised that a submitter
of documents has a right to sue to restrain production of
those documents.

Now, if a suit is authorized, it obviously

has a prospect of success, and this means the prospect that
there will be a restraint on the agency, and such a court
restraint on an agency cannot be translated into an improper
agency withholding.
There are ways of vacating or modifying a decree but
only the issuing court can do so.

Never a moment in time has

there been since this case Si the District of Columbia has
been instituted when the agency was not under temporary or
permanent restraint from producing those documents.
QUESTION:

By virtue of —

MR. SHNIDERMAN:

By virtue of temporary restraining

10
order in the Delaware court, by virtue of a temporary injunc­
tion and by virtue of a permanent injunctions all in another
court.

And yet the —
QUESTION:

Just to be sure, you have told us that

the respondents could have intervened at any time in taking
part or sought to intervene at any time and then if allowed
take part in that proceeding and have a direct attack on the
injunction —
MR. SHNIDERMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

-- by way of court review,

MR. SHNIDERMAN:

And, Mr. Chief Justice, it is very

common in the reverse situation.

There are many cases on the

books where an agency has refused to produce documents and a
requester has brought suit in some court where the submitter
has intervened to help bolster the position of the government
and make whatever arguments it thought was appropriate.

That

has been very common.
The requesters would have this Court consider this
ease as if there had never been any restraining order in ef®
feet, but that is not our case.

And it is equally significant,

I submit, that the requesters in their brief never take a position whatsoever as to what ought to be done, what ought to
be done with this case new that there is a permanent injunc­
tion in place, and yet that is our case.
QUESTION:

Well, under your position, you would

.11

almost have to take the opposite position if they had first
filed an action under the Freedom of Information Act before
your clients had filed an action for an injunction against
disclosure3 wouldn’t you, if you rely on comity?
MR. SHNIDERMAN:

I would suppose that would be true

and I would suppose we would have intervened.

But in all

candor, when the decision is that the agency will release the
documents, it is usually going to b® the submitter of the
documents that will bring the suit first.

And when the ie~*

cision is not to release the documents, it will be the re­
quester who will bring the suit first.
QUESTION:

The agencies have set up internal pro­

cedures whereby they notify in advance, don’t they, at least
that was true in Chrysler, that the Secretary of Defense notify
Chrysler ten days in advance that he is going to release the
in case Chrysler wanted to do anything about it?
MR. SHNIDERMAN:

Yes, of course, and because a party

who is going to get what he asked for really has no cause of
action and that comes to a second point as to whether there Is
a case of controversy.

He has no basis for suing if the

agency says I am going to give you these documents tomorrow.
So we come to the second ground, the second quite
independent ground, and that is comity.

We submit that sound

principles of judicial administration really require that
deference be given to a sister court which has first seized

I

12
hold of a lawsuit and Is in the process of adjudicating it.
Unfortunately, we witness here an almost deliberate effort to
cause a collision.

It is very unfortunate, but I must say to

cause duplicative litigation, because I think the Court of
Appeals preferred its own court, and yet it is, as I have
said., quite natural for the plaintiff to select its jurisdic­
tion.
i
.

The suggestion has been made that comity principles
apply, as is the suggestion of the court below, only when all
the parties in the second suit are parties to the first, but
there is no such rule and we certainly urge that this Court
not to construct such a rule when there is, Justice Rehnquist,
an opportunity to intervene in the Delaware District Court,
if there is a feeling that the government will be an adequate
representative.

Or the respondents could have intervened here

in the Third Circuit,

And when they moved to appear as amicus

on a procedural Issue, we opposed their appearing on that
basis

and said in our same paper that we would have no ob­

jection even at that late date if they were to intervene at
the Third Circuit level.

i

So certainly where we do not have a recalcitrant
agency in this case, we do not think that the Freedom of
Information Act provides a basis for relief.

What we do have

here is that the manufacturers have a strong statutory basis
In 1391(e) for bringing a suit in a locality where it resides,

13
a very strong government policy dating back to 1962.

And with

a potentiatl of 200 million requesters who might request a

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH S. GELLER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL RESPONDENT
SUPPORTING PETITIONERS
MR. GELLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court —
QUESTION:

Mr. Geller, did the Court of Appeals

14
reject the argument that the District Court suit in the
District of Columbia

should be dismissed because there just

isn’t any wrongful withholding?
GELLER:

The interesting thing about the D.C.

Circuit’s decision., Mr. Justice White, is they never addressed

that question.

MR. GELLER:
QUESTION:

It was presented though, wasn’t it?
It was.
But I don’t see anything in the opinion

about it.
MR. GELLER:
QUESTION:

That is an interesting point.
Mr. Geller, is that true as to both of

the opinions of the D.C. Circuit?
HR. GELLER:
QUESTION:
MR. GELLER:

Yes, I believe it is.
It was presented both times, I mean?
Yes, I believe so.

I be*lleve that is

right,
Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
The federal respondents in this case are in basic
agreement with the petitioners that the D.C. Circuit erred in
ordering the District of Columbia District Court to adjudicate
essentially the same controversy with the same documents and
the same legal issues 0.3 that involved In the already pending
Delaware litigation.
The principal concern of the federal government in

j

15
this area* however* is not to urge this Court to adopt rules,
procedural rules that favor FOIA requesters or submitters,
but rather to urge the Court to adopt procedural rules to in­
sure that federal agencies are not put in a position where
they are subject to inconsistent and perhaps even irreconcil­
able injunctive orders of different federal courts, with one
■i

a

hi

I

court requiring the agency to turn over to the public certain
records whose disclosure another court has enjoined.
Kfow, this problem is unlikely to arise when the

i .

;

first suit brought is an action by a requester under the FOIA.

if

In those circumstances, as Mr. Justice Rehnquist has mentioned*
the practice has generally been for the agency to notify the

pi

Submitter of the pendency of the FOIA request or of a legal

tJ

action if one has been filed, and to give it the opportunity
to intervene If it believes that its interests are not ade-

I!

•h qu&tely protected by the agency.
The more significant problem, however, which is

1

'

’

clearly Illustrated by this ease occurs when the first suit

i" brought is a so-called reverse FOIA action by a submitte:.’ of
j
l

info: nation, to the government and when the submitter obtains

■;

an injunction prohibiting the agency from disclosing the
I
records in question.
The federal government’s view is that a second
District Court in a suit subsequently brought by an FOIA rel:
quester should not proceed to adjudicate the diselosability of

16
the very same documents that are the subject of the first suit.
QUESTION:

Mr. Seller, do you think there are going

to be any more reverse PCIA actions?
MR. GELLER:

i

Well, we use the phrase —

Yes, just as a shorthand, as Mr,

MR. GELLER:

QUESTION:

What you mean is action based on some

statute which forbids an agency to whom information has been
»: i!
'2 H

furnished by a private person from disclosing it to someone

else •
MR. GELLER:

That's right, and here there are alle­

gations that the Trade Secrets Act and section 6(b)(1) of the
Consumer Product Safety Act prohibited the agency from

[

17
disclosing the television accident reports.
Now, the first and most obvious reason why x^e think
“V j?

that the D.C. Circuit should not have ordered the District

li

Court to continue to take this case is one that Mr.
Shniderman has already touched on, but I v^ant to emphasize it
because of its obvious importance to this case, and that is
the very language of the POIA itself.
Section 552(a)(4)(B) empowers the District Court to
order the disclosure of agency records that are being

K> fi

"improperly withheld under the POIA."

And we agree witht the

petitioners that an agency’s obedience to a federal court
ii !■' order can in no sense be regarded as improper.

j

But the

, f.

Consumer Product Safety Commission believes that the injunc­
tive order that was issue 1 in Delaware is based on an
erroneous interpretation tf the law and it has appealed that
injunction to the Third Circuit and"±t has now filed a
certiorari petition in this Court.
But the commission is bound to obey the injunction
until and unless it is set aside.

We simply don’t understand

— and the D.C. Circuit, as I said a moment ago, didn’t
bother to explain — how the agency could have "improperly

1

withheld" television accident reports from the requesters
when it refused to turn over those documents solely because
of the outstanding Delaware injunction.

The requesters

never addressed this issue in their brief and they never

18
explained what the Commission is supposed to do if It is sub­
jected to Inconsistent injunctions.
Mow, along with the petitioners, the government also
believes that the D.C. Circuit’s decision is wrong for yet
another somewhat broader reason, and that is that it violates
fundamental principles of judicial comity.
The Court has often applied the general rule that a
federal court should refrain from duplicating or Interfering
with the proceedings —
QUESTION:

That is a pretty general ground.

I

wondered why the — you didn’t petition independently, did
you?
MR. GELLER:

We did not.

We filed a brief at the

petition stage and that is why we appear here as —
QUESTION:
MR. GELLER:

But you didn't file —
No, but it was not because we did not

believe that the D.C. Circuit’s decision was wrong.

We said

precisely that we thought it was.
QUESTION:

You do concede that there are eleven

Courts of Appeals in the country?
MR. GELLER:
QUESTION:
MR. GELLER:

I do concede that there are eleven.
Soon to be fifteen.
But we think in the FOIA area there is

a strong analogy to be drawn to cases Involving in rem or
quasi-in rem jurisdiction.

In such cases, this Court has

19
made clear that the second court In which an action is filed

: li

msut always defer to the court first asserting jurisdiction,
not as a matter of discretion but as a matter of absolute

5 -0

.

5j

■

:

SO H

necessity.

So the Court of Appeals in this case itself recog­

nized that actions seeking to require or to prohibit the dis­
closure of copies of specific documents are in many ways inj

distinguishable from actions seeking the particular disposition;

.13

I!

13

a I

of a specific piece of property»
In both types of cases, exclusive control over the
property is essential to effectuate the court’s judgment.

i■

iC .'

i2 H

It

Is obvious that an injunction preventing release of certain
information is absolutely useless unless it prevents agency

13 1

action everywhere.

And by the same token, an order requiring

disclosure of information obviously can’t be limited to a
single jurisdiction and would forever foreclose a subsequent
non-disclosure order from ever being effected.

io

In short. POIA claims or reverse FOIA claims, when
they concern the same agency records, we believe must be
adjudicated in one and not multiple jurisdictionsa

And we

believe that it makes the most sense from the standpoint of
:

<S^

'■

judicial administration to centralize that litigation In the
first court to assume jurisdiction, subject, of course, to
that court’s further order transferring the case to some

!

i :!

other district.
Now, the Court of Appeals candidly adknowledged that

20

its decision would require duplicate of litigation, but it felt
h

that that result was justified in this case for a number of
1

reasons.
QUESTION:

It was on the competitive theory, compeui-

.

tion is good for the judiciary as it is for business?
MR. GELLER:

That was the reason that they did not

offer, but they offered several others which we think are
equally meritless.

We discussed them in our brief.

The only

point I want to make about the D.C. Circuit's approach, its
so-called creative approach or flexible approach, as the re­
questers call it, is that it totally fails to offer a satis­
factory solution to what we believe is the most pressing
problem in this area, which is the very real possibility that
a federal agency may be subject to conflicting injunctive
orders of two separate courts.
The procedural device is, what the D.C. Circuit
. said is, "We’re not going to require that the litigation be
centralized In the first court.

It can proceed wherever the

FOIA action Is filed, despite the pendency of another casse,
and there are a number of procedural devices that can be used
to try to consolidate the litigation.
Cut the problem with that approach is that the
procedural devices that the Court of Appeals would relv on ,
such as Section 1404(A) of Title 28, Rule 19 of the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure, while they may be useful in some

21
cases to accomplish a consolidation clearly can't be used in
every case, and then you are left with the specter of possibly
conflicting inconsistent injunctions.,
For example, Section 1404 only allows transfer to a
district in which the case could originally have been brought,
and Rule 19 often can't be used to bring a non-party into a
law suit because of venue or service of process problems.

And

perhaps more important, the principal defect in the D.C. Circult's approach is that it relies heavily on procedural de­
vices that we submit are simply ill-suited to FOIA litigation,
where a plaintiff need not have any legal basis or any legal
interest in the documents that he requests.
For example, the Court of Appeals suggestion that
FOIA submitters or federal agencies should make use of the socalled requester class action is totally unworkable in prac­
tice because every person in the United States, indeed I sup­
pose every person in the world, is a. member of the class.
Anybody can make a request under the FOIA, and I might add
it’s significant, we think, as Hr. Shniderman said, that fcha
requesters in this case have abandoned anv reliance on that
portion of the Court of Appealsf opinion in this Court,
Moreover, if in fact the commission had attempted
to join these requesters in the Delaware litigation under
Rule 19, as the D„C. Circuit later said they should have at­
tempted, the tactic would have been of little practical value

22
in avoiding duplicate of litigation or inconsistent judgments„
because even if the commission could have succeeded in joining
the requesters, and the answer to that question is far from
clear in light of the venue and service of process problems
that I mentioned a moment ago, all that would have bean accom­
plished is that these two particular requesters would have been
bound by the collateral estoppal effect of the Delaware judg­
ment.
However, anyone in the United States would still have
been free to file an FOIA action in the District of Columbia
seeking access to the verv same documents, and under the D.C.
Circuit’s theory, since these new requesters would not have
been parties to or bound by the Delaware litigation, they would
have had a right to continue to litigate and to receive an
adjudication of their FOIA claim in the District of Columbia,
despite the existence of the Delaware injunction.
. /

So we think that this so-called flexible approach
just won’t work in a substantial number of cases, and could
lead to what we believe is the most important problem in this
area, one that the Court I think should be concerned about in
resolving tha issue, which is the very real possibility that
exists i.i this case and these types of cases of an agency hav­
ing to either comply with an order requiring or an order pro­
hibiting disclosure of the precisely the same document on pain
of contempt.

23

QUESTION;

You can’t really, enter a plea information,

can you?
MR. GELLER:

Well, it has been suggested, but there

is certainly no case, that the, I mean the requesters and Judge
Robinson in the D.C. Circuit, in an effort to explain what they
meant by "creative approach," listed every conceivable proce­
dural remedy that might exist in this area, but there are no
cases that ever applied it and we don’t think it would be;
workable.
QUESTION;

Is the government’s position that the

court in the — the court handling the second suit, the later
suit, should hold its hand from the verv outset, or do you say
that comity picks up when there has been a judgment in one

court or the other?
MR. GELLER;

Weil, we think that the first, the second

court in this case, the D C. Circuit, District Court, coo.ld
have stayed its action.
QUESTION;

I know it could have stayed its action.

What is your position, when should it have stayed it, from the
very outset?
MR. GELLER:
QUESTION;

Yes.
Or would it have then erred to go ahead

until there has been a judgment?

even though predictably — let’s assume the District of Colum­
bia District Court thought that the docket in this court is
much freer, much more —• much quicker than the court in
Delaware.

Couldn’t they have proceeded to judgment first?
MR. GELLER:

I don’t think so.

First of all, there’s

of course the improperly withheld argument which exists in
that situation.

By the time the second District Court case was

filed, the commission was already under an injunction not to
disclose the documents,

What's reason 1 why the D.C. District

Court should not have continued to adjudicate the case.

Mr. Cellar, 1' don't see how that case

of the Delaware action.
MR. GELLER:

Well, we said that we would have turned

that we were planning to turn the documents over on May first.

Yes, but ~
So this hypothetical couldn't arise?
Well, it could arise in the situation

where on April 10th the submitters ran into the Delaware
District Court and asked for a temporary restraining order,
which I think it's unlikely, you're right, the Delaware
District Court might have refused.

The case could then have

been litigated, could have gone to judgment in the very short

But Mr. Justice White's question was, as­

of the government's posit:.on all along has been, if there were

MR. GELLER:

Well, that's absolutely right; that's

right.

You would have been obliged to turn it

over, would you not?
MR. GELLER:

Well, the ccmmission has taken the;

position that it's not exempt, and we would have turned it
over; that's correct.

We have addressed that

We think that there is a lot of

controversy between the requesters and the commission as to
whether these documents are being improperly withheld.
QUESTION?

By virtue of the joinder under Rule 19?

MR. GELLER;

No.

No.

There is a case of controversy

between the requesters and the commission here in the District
of Columbia as to whether the documents that the requesters
have asked for are being improperly withheld under the act.
QUESTION?

So the District of Columbia — so the

Court of Appeals should have done what?
MR. GELLERs

The D.C. Court of Appeals we think

should have reversed on -die ground that the documents were not
being improperly withheld and that the requesters had not
stated a cause of action under the FOIA.

been an indefinite duration.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN B. MORRISON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. MORRISON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;:
Virtually from the start of this litigation, the
petitioners and the government have opposed the efforts cf the
requesting parties under the Freedom of Information Act to
litigate this case in the District of Columbia.
consistently asked why didn't you go to Delaware?

They hive
And I want

to answer that question tcday in three separate ways.
We didn't go to Delaware for three reasons.

First,

we didn'r want to go to Delaware? second, w@ didn't have to
go to Delaware? and, third, it is the wrong question to ask.
And the proper question to ask is why didn't the parties, and

30

in particular the government, move to take the cases in
Delaware and bring them down to the District of Columbia where
everybody was here, th© case could have gone forward for judg­
ment on the merits in one court, this on©.
Now, bluntly stated, this case involves forum shop­
ping by all the parties.
forum shopping.

There is nothing inherently evil in

Congress has provided alternate venue pro­

visions and they are there to be exorcised.
Th© manufacturer’s want to Delaware, because they be­
lieved it would be favorable to then to go to Delaware.

It

is not, of cours©, the principal place of business of any of
them.

In fact, four lawsuits were not even filed in Delaware,

they wera filed elsewhere and later transferred to Delaware.
QUESTION;

Isn’t that usually a reason for venting

a case, though, counsel?
MR. MORRISON;

absolutely, Your Honor.

And my point

is that, like saying this is a forum shopping case, w® don't
decide anything.

Th® manufacturers war© there in Delaware,

despite th© absence of any witnesses, despite th© absence of
lead counsel.

Th® documents weren’t there.

They ware merely

incorporated in Delaware.
Wq wanted to eve id Delaware for our own reasons,
i

because we believed it was inconvenient and because it was
more costly to litigat® h*re in th® District of Columbia.
clients were here, the counsel was here.

The

We considered going

31

up to Delaware and moving to intervene in Delaware and at­
tempting to have the cas® transferred here under 1404(a).

But

as soon as we thought about that, we saw we were in a box
because there are cases that have held that if you voluntarily
come into an action as an intervenor you waive your right to
go to ask that the cas© bo transferred.

So we were put in a

bind because they had run the race to the courthouse.
Indeed, we couldn’t have gone to Delaware only at
the time of filing.

We would have had to have gone to the

District of Delaware, the Western District of Pennsylvania,
and we would have had to have gone to the Western District of
New York and the Southern District of New York to litigate a
singla controversy.
Now, w© also perceived that th® action in the
District of Columbia would be raora favorably disposed of her©.
Presumably th© manufacturers thought th© contrary for th€jy
want to Delaware and th© general reputation of th© courts is
at least a matter that counsel believed they ought to con­
sider in their obligation© to their clients.

Moreover, there

had been temporary restraining orders already entered in these
other cases and it was a negative footing on which to settle
the cases.
The result is that we would have been faced with
the situation at th© time we filed th© complaint.

I want, to

emphasis© that this was four days after the May 1st s©l£“impos©d

32
deadline by the Court of Appeals.by the Product Safety Commis­
sion.

Pour days after that, wa did the simplest thing, we

filed one case here in the District of Columbia and, unlike
the manufacturers, we named every single person who was
relevant in the controversy and tried to get them all in a
single forum.
So that is why we didn't want to go to Delaware.
And as counsel, I must tell you that I am obligated to repre­
sent my clients to the best I can.
QUESTION:

Mr. Morrison, I trust before you are

through you will explain your views about the improperly
withheld argument?
MR. MORRISON;

QUESTIONs

Mr. Morrison, don't forget to answer my

question about improper withholding.
MR. MORRISON:
QUESTION:

I'm trying.

I know you're trying, but it is really

terribly important.
MR. MORRISON:
QUESTION:

I know it is, Your Honor, and --

Regardless of how it got here or the

equities or all the rest of it, we really have to address that.
MR. MORRISON:

There is now a final injunction,

affirmed on appeal, petition for certiorari pending.

But: the

origin of the withholding argument, the improper withholding
argument, the linchpin was the grant of the initial temporary
restraining orders in fch© 13 different cases that were
initially

filed.
Now, according to this argument, if you cannot stop

— if you have no jurisdiction, it is because there was no
improper withholding from the moment that that temporary
restraining order, Mr. Justice Whit®, was entered in those
cases,

hnd so we could not have from the very start had

jurisdiction and
QUESTION:

Well, I didn't realise this was a juris­

dictional argument.

MR. MORRISON;
Q3ESTI0N:

Well ~

The court adjudicates your cas© that you

3S

file and say you lose, there isn't any improper withholding.
MR. MORRISON:

But as soon as the temporary — but

the argument is made that as soon as the temporary restraining
order is entered, there can no longer -- the basis of with­
holding is no longer that there is a statutory right to with­
hold but that there is a temporary restraining order.

That is

the argument that was mado the first time and every time it
has been made that is —
QUESTION:

Well, what about the argument, that is

what I am trying to figure out.
MR. MORRISON:
QUESTION:

How —

At any time during this case, could they,

ware they wrongfully withholding documents?
MR. MORRISON:
with that argument.

There are two things that are wrong

The first is that presumably if we had

won the race to the courthouse —
QUESTION:

Bute you didn't.

MR. MORRISONs

— and filed a case and they had

gotten a temporary restraining order some place else in another
case without us being a party, at that point our case would
have to i>e dismissed under this argument.

And I don't think

that Congress ever intended this statute, which was a broad
remedial statute, to give the rights to requesting parties to
com© in, ever intended it to b© so narrowly -sonstrued — am
2 think this Court's dec if-.ion in the Banner craft case suggests

37
that the FOIA did not strip a court of its equity pawars.
QUESTIONS

So if the agency says I'm withholding the

documents because I have been ordered to or I will be held in
contempt if I don't, they neve;:the1® ss ar© wrongfully with­
holding?
MR. MORRISON:

That is correct, Your Honor.

That is

correct —
QUESTION:

What is your second reason?

MR. MORRISON:

I thought, Your Honor, -the first that

it was simply not a way of dealing with it, that it might be

gone in and requested and brought an action, had gotten a

broad and Congress didn't intend to strip a court of its
equitable powers, and yet I understood a manent ago that you
agreed that under Walker v, Birmingham th® only way to chal­
lenge an injunction was to appeal it, not to disobey it.

I mean that is after litigation.
MR. MORRISON:

No, we were tossed out and the argu­

ment on improper withholding was made at both temporary re­
straining and the preliminary injunction stage, and that is
when we lost our case in the District of Columbia, the
District Court initially, because we were told we could not
proceed.

And what I am trying to say is that the government

here and the petitioners are making everything turn on a race
to the courthouse, a race which we couldn't win for one
reason, because we let the administrative process take its
course.

And as sure as I am standing here today, I want to

assure you that this will be the last case we will lose on a

of controversy.
MR. MORRISON;

But W3 will gat in there before they

that the statute specifically authorises ~
QUESTION;

What about the ones which do?

Do you take

a position that a wrongful withholding occurs when an agency
says w© need time to evaluate your request?
MR. MORRISON;

Yes, Your Honor.

The statute I believe

is clear on this.
QUESTION;

It is wrongful withholding unless they send

you ths documents by return mail?
MR. MORRISON;

Ho, within 10 days plus the extension.

Congress dealt with this :in the 1974 amendments.

They were con­

cerned about this very problem and said we recognize the inter­
ruption in administrativo processes is not a good thing in
general, but wa also realise that the agency, if they keep
saying just wait a couple days, a couple days, a couple days,
and you don't get them — Congress said yes, the courts have
jurisdiction if the statutory time frames have passed.
QUESTION;

What if those statutory time frames hav©

not passed?
MR, MORRISON;

Your Honor, fchtsr© are not going to bs

very many of those cases.
QUESTION;

But what about the few of them that thana

43

a. r®?
MR. MORRISON?

At that point. Your Honor, I think what

would .happen is — what we urg© is that the government is in
the middle of all of these cases, it is the responsibility of
the government who claims to be a stakeholder hare and has no
other interest besides doing that, to say we've got to try to
do what we can, either join the parties under Rule 19, which
we say they should have done hare when we are known requesters,
not a hypothetical 200 million but known requesters who have
been asking for -these documents, or move to transfer ‘under
1404(a) which incidentally the government finally got around fee
doing after the first decision in the D.C. Circuit.
at that irate it -was denied as untimely.

Of course,

Moreover, the govern­

ment didn't have all th© casas in Delaware to begin with, there
war© four casas which they moved frcw other districts to
Delaware instead- of moving them all down to the District of
Columbia, and we say that is a more sensible way, that neither
requesters nor submitters ought to have th© option of unilater!

ally choosing the forum and having th© other person go. up ami
have to intervene and then loss their right to move to transfer.
That is not a sensible way of deciding in which forum trims©
cases ought to be litigated.
QUESTION!

Why prefer the forum in which th® govern-»

ment agency is located to th© forum in which either the sub­
mitter or th® requesters are located?

44
MR. MORRISON:

I’m not suggesting that you have to do

that, Mr. Justice Relinquish.

All I sm suggesting that you do

is to look at th© facts of a.particular case and sea where the
appropriate forum for litigation is,,

Here it plainly would

have been in the District of Columbia.

1404(a), an action under the FOIA can always be brought in theDistrict'of Columbia, so that that likelihood makes it much
more probable that xm will b© able to consolidate the cases in
a single forum.
Nov/, I do not suggest that it will work in ©very
case.

What I do suggest is that if the District Courts are

told you've got.to try to work this thing out flexibly instead
of just simply saying you lost your c&s® to the courthouse, so
good-by.

That is all we are talking about, a temporary

restraining order here is nothing more than the filing of ©
complaint and an automatic grant.

They said — th© petitioners

say so, and I think Footnote 11 ©£ their brief, they say it is
'automatic and we don't dispute that —
Qijf.ES-T.IOK:

Mr. Morrison, it may be that the TR0 is

automatic, but you don't suggest that District judges around
the United States, when th© governmentfc argues there is no legal
basis for the submitters to get an injunction, that they auto­
matically eater injunctions right and left, do you?
MR. MORRISONs
QUESTIONS

No, I don't, Your Honor.

They must at least be a legal basis for

th® claim.
. -Mlh MORRISON:
QUESTION:

I agree.

Shouldn't we presume that all judges are

equally competent to weigh th® merits of these claims, all

47
Federal District judges?
MR. MORRISON:

That is correct, Your Honor, but we do

have a.problem of forum shopping and that is what it is, and
the question is what ar@ w.s going to do about it.

And I don't

believe that th© principle that Your Honor is —
QUESTION s

But really if there is a colorable legal

basis, it persuades th® district judge that th® documents
should not bo released, they shouldn't be pell-mell released
just to protect th® forum of th© other side?
MR. MORRISON:
QUESTION:

I agree.

Congress could stop the forum shopping,

couldn't it?
MR. MORRISON:

That is, of course, true.

Everything

under th© FAOI, Congress car make any changes it wants in th©
statute.
QUESTION si

So your answer is y@s, but, you would rather

have us do it?

MR. MORRISONs

■

No, I am her© in court now, Your

Honor —

;
QUESTION:

up to Delaware.

Because you don't have to go all thb way

That's strange„

MR. MORRISON:

Or California, as other cases have been

involved.
QUESTION:

Well, California isn't involved in this.

You just object to taking a trip to Delaware.

48
MR. MORRISONs

And they object to taking a trip to

the District of Columbia, -with all due respect, Your Honor,
because they don't want to fe@ her® and wa don't want to be up
there,
QUESTION:

Neither of you like Amtrak.

(Laughter)
MR. MORRISON:

Your Hosier, this race to the courthouse
i

theory which has been put forth is going to produc® unnecessary
and prematur© litigation.

It is going to produce an unnecessary

interruption of the administrative process as parties are
facing to the courthouse to get their choice of form so that
. X

everything can be consolidated there because they are going to
win, and it provides an absolute choice of form to on®, side
or the other without regard to the merits.

We don't think that

is a sensible way of dealing with it, but if that is what, the
Court says we believe ws can live with it In the first case,
and we are her® today because we agree with the Solicitor
General that there is a problem with judicial administration.
We agree that it is desirable to have proceedings consolidated

in on© forum.

We disagree! that the race to fch® courthouse

with one side a guaranteed winner and the other side a guaran­
teed loser as a sensible way of resolving that conflict.
Whet wa urge is that the flexibility entailed in
Rule 19 and 1404(a) ba used to solve the problems in virtually
every case and that we don't think they:® are significant

49
problems that cannot fa® worked out through than.
Thank you, Your Honors»
MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.

Do you have anything further, Mr. Shnidarman?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF HARRY L. SHNIDERMAN, ESQ,,
OK BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS ~ REBUTTAL
MR. SHNIDERMAN:

Your Honors, first of all, in

responses to some questions frcsa th® Justice, I do want to
point out th© improperly withheld point was fully briefed in
fell© court below.

Those briefs indeed are lodged with this ■

Court; and if there is any question about it or
QUESTION:

Both times or the first time ..or th® second

time?
Mi. SHNIDERMAN:

It was briefed more sketchily th®

first time because w© were placing greater emphasis on the
rase of controversy, but it was there by both fch© government
incidentally and by us,
QUESTION:

But more fully the second time?

MR. SHNIDERMAN:

Yes, more fully the second time.

Arid we frankly do not know? why
deal with th© point at all.

the Court of Appeals did not

Perhaps sera© of the discussion

.her© today would suggest why th© point was not dealt with.
I might also add, although it may date me, Justice
Rehnquist, whan you rely on Walker v. Birmingham, I would
also like to say that inour brief we point to the United Mins

50
Workers case where John L. Lewis made a mistake as to whether
an injunction was binding or not and it cost his union $1
million.

So I -would think that injunctions ar© to be obeyed

until such time as they were sat aside.
We are frankly at a loss, although perhaps it is not
important, as to why the government has changed its position
on case of controversy.

Part of the difficulty that we get. in

here is because we really did not have a case of controversy
in this court.

The government now states that there is a case

of controversy as to the scop© or the effect of the injunction.
But I have not heard one word on the part of the governmcait or
on the part of the respondents as to what fchs controversy is
about that injunction.
QUESTIONS

So you say there still isn’t one?

MR. SHNIDERMANs

There still isn't one, and that is

No, Mr. Justice, you need not decide

There are three independent bases for deciding it and —
