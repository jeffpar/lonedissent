MR. CHIET'' JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in United States v„ Euge.
Mr. Smith, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STUART A. SMITH, ESQ„,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. SMITH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it p3ease

the Court:
This case comes here on a writ of certiorari to the
United States Courtoof Appeals for tha Eighth Circuit.

The

question presented involves tha enforceability of an Internal
Revenue Service summons.

The question before the Court is

whether the Internal Revenue Service has the statutory author­
ity to issue a summons requiring a person to appear and execute
handwriting exemplars in aid of an administrative investiga­
tion to determine his correct tax liability.
The facts are relatively simple and undisputed and I
can summarise them quickly, as follows:

In October 1977,

Special Agent Patrick Finnessey was assigned to investigate
respondent Euge’s tax liability for the period 1973 through
1976,

This period came to the attention of the Internal

Revenue Service because the respondent had filed no tax returns
for any of these years and he had sought no extensions for the
filing of these returns.
The case had been referred to the Intelligence Division

4

by the Audit and Collection Division after it had been deter­
mined that no tax returns

ware filed.

The special agent

determined to compute the respondent's tax liability by means
of the bank deposits method.

So the scrutiny focused on

respondent's bank accounts.
Now, respondent had two bank accounts in his own name
but the investigation revealed that there were 20 other bank
accounts, the bank statements of which were sent to post office
boxes in respondent's names.

These bank accounts were in other

names and there were signature cards on file with these 20
different bank accounts that bore addresses of proparties owned
by the respondent.

Moreover, there were frequent transfers be­

tween these bank accounts.

These facts suggested to the agent

that respondent was maintaining bank accounts under aliases to
conceal taxable income.
The amounts were substantial.

For 1975, these 20

different bank accounts had an aggregate balance of approxi­
mately $50,000 and for '76, it was something like $30,000.
Special agent served a summons on respondent requiring him to
appear and execute handwriting exemplars of the various signa­
tures on these bank accounts, so that he could take these
handwriting exemplars and submit them for handwriting analysis
by an Internal Revenue Service handwriting laboratory.
Respondent stated —
QUESTION:

Mr. Smith, Mr. Euge is here on an informa

5

pomptoris basis, isn’t he?
MR. SMITH:

That seems to be correct, yes, because

the briefs, I think, were printed at the expense of the Court.
After respondent told the agent at the time that he
wouldn't comply with the summons, so the United States and the
special agent commenced this summons enforcement proceeding in
the District Court.

The District Court held a hearing, the

transcript of which is set forth in the appendix, and briefly,
the special agent testified as to the nature of the investiga­
tion, the purpose of the investigation, the necessity, the
relevancy and the necessity for the handwriting exemplars, and
he also testified that he had made no recommendation with
respect to any criminal prosecution of respondent.
There is no question in this case that the handwriting
exemplars are relevant and necessary to completion of the
Service's investigation.

The District Court then ordered the

summons anforced and ordered respondent to provide exemplars
of eight different signatures, eight different signatures writ­
ten out ten times each.

In fact, there’s a particular form

that the Service has for this purpose.
On appeal, the Court cf Appeals heard the case
bloc and reconsidered and thereafter overruled its prior deci­
sion in United States v. Campbell, that was a two to one panel
decision which it upheld the Service’s statutory right to,
statutory authority to require the execution of these

6

handwr it ing exemplar s .
The opinions below are brief because the majority
simply said, "We overrule Campbell and adopt the dissenting
opinion in Campbell," and the dissent simply says I would fol­
low Campbell.

The dissenting opinion of Campbell, in Campbell,

is itself brief.

Briefly, what it says is that it views the

handwriting, process of requiring a handwriting exemplar as a
search and seizure within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment
and the dissenting judge went on in that case to say that
those charged with investigation and prosecutorial duties
should not ba the sole judges of when to utilise what h® cal­
led constitutionally sensitive means in pursuing their tasks.
There are two statutes involved in this case.

We

submit that the Court of Appeals erred in that there is statu­
tory authority to require the execution of this handwriting
exemplar.

The statutes ar© set forth in our appendix to our

brief at page 1A and 2A, in the back of our brief.

Section

7601 is the so-called canvass power of the Internal Revenue
Service which tha Court has explored in many, many different
decisions, most recently in the LaSalle national Bank and also
in tha Joa Doe summons case of several terms ago, United
States v.

Bisceglia.

And this sort of charges the Secretary

of the Treasury and his delegate, the Commissioner, to cause
officers to proceed throughout each district arid inquire after
and concerning all persons therein who raav bs liable to pay

7
any internal revenues tax.
Section 7602, the immediately succeeding section, is
the summons authority.

I would direct the Court’s attention to

Subparagraph 2 of that, which gives the Secretary or his dele­
gate the authority to summon the person liable for a tax, and
if I can. just move over to page 2A, to appear before the Secre­
tary or his delegate at a time and place named in the summons
and to product such books, papers, records and other data, and
to give such testimony under oath as may be relevant: or
material to such inquiry.

And the third subparagraph empowers

the officer of the Internal Revenue Service to take such
testimony of the parson concerned.
We believe that the compulsory process authority set
forth in the statute to require a person to appear and to give
such testimony as may be relevant reasonably carries with it
the statutory authority to compel a witness to exhibit certain
specific physical characteristics, such as handwriting or
voice exemplars.

This proposition we think has been well

established, not only by decisions of this Court but by the
pertinent authorities.
/

. QUESTION:
statutory question,
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

Well, what you’re arguing is basically a
isn't it?
Yes.
Certainly Mara and Dionlsio establish that

if Congress says so, there is no constitutional objection.

8

MR. SMITH;

Exactly.

And I think that Mara and

Dioaisio to the extent are relevant here, really refute the
dissenting judge in Campbell's view that there was some kind of
constitutionally sensitive thing, either from the Fifth Amend­
ment point of view or the Fourth Amendment point of view.

I

mean, I think it's established that this is not testimonial
compulsion, and that it's also established that exhibiting,
you know, that requiring someone to give a voice exemplar, show
his face, give fingerprints or whatever, is not a search and
seizure within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.

So I don’t

think there’s any really constitutional question.
QUESTION;

Mr. Smith, is your argument then, you are

not arguing that fch© handwriting exemplar is testimony.

In

fact, I guess it’s not testimony under this ~~
MR. SMITH;
QUESTION;
MR. SMITH;

No,

well, we’re arguing --

— given the power to take testimony —
Testimony; right, exactly.

Given the

statutory power to take testimony of a non-privi1eged nature,
since thase non-testimonial acts are non-pri vileged as estab­
lished by decisions of this Court, that that statutory authority
is reasonably inherent in the authority to compel somebody to
appear.

Because if you — in other words, if you can compel

somebody to appear before a revenue agent and let’s say the
Revenue agent, let’s say in this particular case — or take the
case of Bisceglia, where somebody had made a large deposit to

9

to a bank, the Service had a teller who thought he could
identify the person, and there was a suspicion that it was the
parson under investigation, if he were brought in, quote, "to
appear," the Revenue agent could say to the teller, "Is this
the fellow who deposited the 400 one hundred dollar bills,” or
whatever.

It's that, exhibition of his face, which is inherent

in the statutory authority to can pel somebody to appear.
QUESTION;

You don't really claim, then, that the

literal wording of the statute covers this case?
MR. SMITH;

No.

I don't think there's any question

that the literal wording doesn’t cover this case, but we think
that given the recent decision of law construing the statutory
authority in a broad way to enhance the Service’s power to find
out information and to discharge its canvass duty, to go around
and to find out who owes tax, that this is a reasonable con­
struction of the statute, and it doesn’t offend any constitu­
tional concerns, and 'there really is no policy reason to con­
strue the statute in any other way.
For example, I think one of the things that I think
is germane is, the Court observed in Bisceglia that had the
taxpayer or the bank official in that case been called before
a grand jury, -there wouldn't ba any question that the grand
jury could compel the bank official to answer questions.
the court analogized the Service summons authority to the
grand jury authority to seek information.

And

10
We don’t think that there really is -- we think that
analogy coupled with the statutory language which we think is
hospitable to our construction more or less carries the day and
demonstrates the error of the court below.

Because her© again,

had the respondent been called before a grand jury, there’s no
question that he would have to make these handwriting exemplars,
and the protections, one of the arguments that is made is wall,
you know, he doesn’t have any protections in this case.

Some­

how there is a — this is being decided by an Internal Revenue
officer that he has to do this, and that he doesn’t have any
protections of the neutral officer-.

But I think it’s well

established that the whole summons enforcement mechanism is
replete with protections, not only of a statutory nature, but
the protections established by the decisions of this Court,
decisions like Donaldson and Powell, which more or lass indi­
cata that, you know, that mors or less say, without any ques­
tion, that a summons from the Internal Revenue Service is not
self-executing, that person can object to its enforcement, as
indeed respondent did in this case, and that you have the
interposition of the Federal judiciary to determine whether
the summons is over-broad and a variety of questions which
courts determine every day.

In fact, you have the full adver­

sary proceeding which enables a person to object to particular
questions.

In fact, you have the right to appear with counsel

when you go to comply with the summons, which you don’t have

11
in the grand jury.
I think, you know, it more or less demonstrates to
us the truth of the court’s observation in Bisceglia that
Congress has provide:! protection from arbitrary or capricious
action by placing the federal courts between the government
and the person summoned.

So that the analogy between the

Internal Revenue Service summons and the grand jury subpoena
we think is sound and provides all the necessary, and the de­
cisions of this court provide all the necessary protections in
this case.
We. don’t see really that there’s any real problem
either from a constitutional or a statutory nature with con­
struing the statute in a way to provide giving these handwrit­
ing exemplars.
I simply say, and I simply address another point o::
'objection which w© think is really without force, is the fact
that the court below felt somehow that ths Service has no
authority to fore© somebody to create things; in other words,
that somehow you can get a piece of paper or, you know, books
and records, but you can’t say to somebody. "Okay, con© in and
create something for us,"

But, I mean, it ssems to us there

are really two answers to that.

You are not really asking any

body to create something when you ask them to provide handwrit
ing exemplars.

All you’re really doing is asking them to dis­

play a physical characteristic, much the same way that when
you take someone’s photograph, you’re not creating their face,

12
or if you record their fingerprints, you're not creating their
fingerprints.

All you're doing is recording a physical charac

ter istic..
QUESTION?

Mr. Smith,, does this statute authorise

taking fingerprints?
MR. SMITH:

I would think it would, Mr. Justice

Stevens.
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:
QUESTIONS
MR. SMITH:

Blood samples?
What?
What about blood samples, vole© exemplars?
I would think it would, also.
All cf those things.
I would think it would — you know, the

whole gamut of non-testimonial disclosures, like asking some­
body to put on a hat, or you know, these things are normally
not done in tax investigation.
QUESTION:

Is this power used in connection with

preparation of criminal cases or just civil cas&s?
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

The summons authority power?
Yes.
Well, I think that, you know, at this

stag©, I think the decisions of this Court indicate that the
civil and criminal aspects of the case &r© intertwined.

So 1

mean, I don’t think -that I can answer that question and say
that a criminal case .is being prepared liar©.
what — in effect it may b® nothing

I think that

In other words, just like the 400 $100 bills in
Bisceglia might have turned out to be an innocent thing, and
in fact, to go •—
QUESTION:

If these exemplars showed that it was the

same person who signed his name on all these accounts, it would
be pretty clear criminal liability, wouldn't there?
MR. SMITH;

Assuming that the balances that went

into the accounts ware, represented unreported taxable incoma.
They all could have b@©n inheritances from his grandmother.
Again, this is really an attempt to ferret out information in
order to determina what the scope of the liability is here.
QUESTION:

Arad if that, was his signature, the only

thing left for him to do was plead guilty.
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

Well, that would -It would be a real wests of time to try

him, wouldn't it?
MR. SMITH:

Well, it's possible tint he could then

say that an elderly aunt left him all of this money.

I thir.x

tie question would be fairly put, you know, as to where this
money came from.

But th© point is again.,, you’re right, Mr.

Justice Marshall, that if there were demonstrated to be his
signatures, I think that he would have an obligation to ex­
plain why he felt the need to maintain 20 different bank ac­
counts with false names.

That’s not the normal kind of thing

that peopl® do.
QUESTION:

Is th©r© any federal statute or — well,

14
we'll start with federal®

Is there any federal statute that

prevents you or me or anyone from having 10 bank accounts in
10 differant names, trad© names —
MR. SMITE:

Oh, I don't think there's any federal

prohibition, but I suspect that he probably ran the gamut here
and used false social security numbers, and you know, I suspect
at that point, there probably — because you do have an obliga­
tion, I think, to give your bank an appropriate, you know, the
correct social security number so they could report —
QUESTION:

Is that by federal statute?

QUESTION:

Well, most people only have one social

security number.
MR. SMITH:

Right, that's right.

Exactly.

And in

fact, if I may just pursue this for a moment, that really goes
to one of the things that we mentioned in our brief, as one of
the really prime necessities for this kind of summons.
Apparently it's become quit© common for people to
file multiple tax returns asking for refunds, and there is now
a program in the Service called the questionable return program
which is designed to determine who these people are.

Apparently

as of 1976, the Service has determined that some 8,900 returns
were questionable returns and sought refunds in the aggregate
of $12.3 mi .11 ion,
And then of course there's a whole host of — I mean,
tli© imagination, it's only limited by one's imagination to
think of the number of instances in which document authentication

15

is an important part of an Internal Revenue Service inquiry.

summer whose wages are withheld during the time they work, bat

MR. SMITH:

Yes, but Mr. Justice Relinquish, my recol­

lection is that several years ago, it certainly came long
after I worked for the summer that you could file a particular
form and absolve yourself of withholding, if you could demon­
strate, on the assertion, on the assurance that you were not
going to have taxable income in excess of a certain amount so
that you wouldn't have this over-withholding.

But it is, I tak® it from your response to

ray earlier question that there is no statute which forbids any
parson from having ten different bank accounts in ten different

MR. SMITH:

I am not aware of any statutory prohibi­

tion, but of course there is a statutory provision against
l

concealing taxable income and net reporting it.

16

QUESTIONS

That's not my question.

My question is,

prompted by Mr. Justice Marshall's point that revealing that
you had ten different bank accounts under ten different names
is not automatically an admission of any guilt of any crime?
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

Absolutely not; absolutely not.

But —

You might do that so that your children
Well, no, no.

Well, all it does in this

case is to — I think that all 1 am saying in this case is
that these facts reasonably suggested to the Internal Revenue
Service that, there might be a problem here with this respondent.
All that goes to is the legitimacy of ‘this investigation.
This is not, this wasn't a research project, but —
QUESTION:

— wasn't a pis® of guilty, but at least

was a prima facie net worth cme, wasn't it?
MR. SMITH:

It certainly would enhance, it would

bring the Service, Mr. Justice BXackraun, sir, to first base.
QUESTION:

Let's settle with "enhance."

Let's settle

with that.
MR. SMITH;
QUESTION:

Okay.
Perhaps he might case in and explain that

ha just didn't want his wife and his children to know how much
money he had in the bank,
MR. SMITH?

Yes, indeed, but ©f course he hadn't

filed any tax returns at all, s© it's possible he didn’t want
the Internal Revenue Service to know how much money he had

17

earned.

He was a tax return preparer, so —
(Laughter.}
MR. SMITH:

~ lie’s not th© kind of person who is

innocent of learning in these matters.
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

And he’s here IFF?
He’s here IFF.

I cannot explain that.

But getting back to this business about creating the
materials,, even apart from the question, I don't think that,
you know, displaying a physical characteristic is a creation
of any evidence but rather recordation of something that really
exists.
There also is settled authority that Section 7602,
the summons enforcement authority, includes the right to have
the Service summon client lists of tax return preparers.
Without regard to whether they war© in existence or not, those
eases ars firmly established in th© circuits, and in fact, were
cited with approval by this Court in Biseeglia at page 148 of
the opinion.
So hare, I think that the concerns of th© court, the
constitutional concerns are groundless and-, the statutory con­
cerns, I think from a matter of sort of textural analysis cf
tlie statute as well as policy concerns are groundless.

Th©

respondent here has sufficient protections to be able to narrow

QUESTION:

Mr. Smith, I know you discuss in your

I think that th© 6th Circuit in

Brown misread the legislative history in two different ways#
which we discuss in our brief.

They# it misread it by suggest­

ing that th© word "other data” was added to a transferee
liability provision and in fact it was not# and then it also
we think narrowly focused on simply on® of th® three legs of
th© antecedents of Section 7602 and mad© something about th©
fact that# you know# "memoranda“ became "other data#” so that
"other data* must necessarily mean "memoranda.1!

But it seems

20
to us that the words books, papers, et cetera, more or less
would cover memoranda and that other data is a word of general
import that would cover information of any kind.
QUESTION!

It would be harder to say that exemplars

are memoranda than it is to say that they are data?
MR. SMITH;

Exactly.

Exactly,

1 think that's right.

We set it forth in our brief, it's detailed information of
any kind or material for an investigation.

Certainly I think

it would fit any kind of constitutionally admissible, permis­

ORAL ARGUMENT BY JAMES W. ERWIN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

21

MR. ERWIN:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please the

Courts
My name is James Erwin, counsel for the respondent
Harvey F. Euge.
The issue in this case is whether the Congress has
authorised the use of an administrative summons to compel the
creation of physical

or real evidence, in this particular-

case handwriting exemplars, in the administrative investigation
of tax liability.
We submit that there is nothing in the text of the
statute, in its legislative history ©r in the antecedents of
the statute to which the legislative history makes reference
which supports that view.
Th© government relies upon two words or phrases that
appear in th© statute, the first of which is "appear."

The

power to compel a person to appear and giv© testimony, or conpel a person to appear and produce books, papers, records,
and other data.

Wa believe that th® word "appear" merely has

reference to compelling a parson to respond to the summons.
This is in accord with the purpose of the statute.

The agent

who issues a summons is conducting a tax investigation.

There­

fore the::© Is no such thing as a default in the ordinary cases
of where monetary or equitable relief, ha needs to have a
response.

A person must either comply with the summons or he

must appear arad make whatever good faith defense h© may have

22
to it
The statutory structure is likewise set up in this
way.

Section 7604(b), to which this Court had reference in

the Kaplan case in 1964, noted that it was only for the use of
a person wholly defaulted or contumaciously refused to comply
with the summons.
:
'\

In fact, this was a procedure that was

followed in this case in the District Court.

Mr. Euge initial-

ly failed to appear before the revenue agent in response to
the summons and he Initially failed to appear before the

J

.

District Court in response to an order to show cause, and an
attachment for his arrest was issued under section 7604(b) and
'

he was brought before the court and the case eventually pro­
ceeded to a hearing.
Incidentally, at the time that he was brought be­
fore the court, there was a hearing held on his financial
ability to retain counsel.
QUESTION:
MR. ERWIN:

You say there was a hearing?
Yes, there was.

that he fulfills the IFF standard?
HR. ERWIN:

Yes, I ara, sir.

I think it is further significant that the statute
does not- use the broadest possible language that it could in

2k

setting forth the scope of the summons.

For example* it does

not say that a person could, be compelled to appear and give
evidence of any kind.

Evidene®* of course* includes not only

testimony and oral statements under oath but the production of
documentary evidence* books* papers* and records, but also
real and physical evidence* handwriting exemplars* finger­
prints* summaries, charts* many things that can be used as
evidence? in a trial.

Would you agree* as suggested by your

brother* that he could be summoned to appear for the purpose

MR. ERWIN:

No* Your Honor.
You don't?
I do not agree.
He could be summoned to appear and bring

with him an existing pictura* couldn't he?
MR. ERWIN:
QUESTION:
MR. ERWIN:

Yes.
You do concede that?
I believe that the point on which the

statute addresses itself, he could be compelled to produce
documents or evidence of a documentary nature that does exist.
A picture would be an example of that.
QUESTION:

Your response to that Is in the frame­

work of the Tax Code* I take it?
MR, ERWIN:

Yes

QUESTION:

Not generally®

MR. ERWIN:

No, not generally.

1 think that a grand

jury or a court has inherent power to compel production of
evidence which the Internal Revenue Service does not have.
The Internal Revenue Service power is statutory and it has
only that power which —
QUESTION:

If he is ordered to produce an exemplar

in the proceeding by the District Court, where does the com­
pulsion originate?

Is not the court acting?

MR. ERWIN:

Yess the court is acting but it is act­

ing pursuant to the statute.

There is a jurisdictional statute

that is worded in the same words as the scope of the summons
power, section ?^02(b) and also section 7604(a), conferred
jurisdiction upon the District Court to enforce a summons for
the production of books, papers, records} and other data.
QUESTION:

But the District Court trould have no more

power fcc enforce the summons than the service had to Issue the
summons,
MR. ERWIN:
QUESTION:

That’s correct ®
Then why do you say that the District

Court could do something that the service could not do?
MR. ERWIN:

The District Court in a pending criminal

case pursuant to a motion of the government could order the
execution of the handwriting exemplar or it could order the
enforcement of a grand jury subpoena for handwriting exemplar.

Internal Revenue Service has the power to summon books, papers,
records and other data.
is very simple»

The legislative history of the statute

It is just one sentence, and it states that

the section was not intended — it was intended to enact no

material change from existing law.
V-.

!

Existing law in 196*1, of
j

course, was the 1939 Internal Revenue Code which was,Itself a
codification of previous internal revenue acts.
The three statutes which set forth the scope of the
summons In the 1939 code are section 36i*i, section 3615 and
section 365**-

Section 361**(a) refers to the examination of

books, papers, records, or memorandum; section 3615(a) referrs
to summons for production of books; and section 365**(a) refers
to examination of books, papers, accounts and premises in the
summoning of books and papers.
QUESTION:

Mr. Erwin, supposing that under section

7602 the last sentence of it, and to give such testimony under
oath before the Secretary or his delegate at a time and place
named in the summons and to produce such books, papers,
records or other data and to give such' testimony under oath
as may fee relevant or material to such inquiry.

And the

Secretary’s delegate decides it would be very helpful to us
and material and relevant for us to have a statement from you
of your net worth on January 1st and your net worth on

1

December 31st, and the man responds 5’I don’t have any such
thing in existence.”

Bo j?ou think the Secretary could say,

well, give us your best estimate?
MR. ERWIN:

I believe in that situation the person

would have the Fifth Amendment privilege to refuse to respond.

came within the Fifth Amendment.

it is much more manageable for us?

affirmatively by the service.

And at least until the mid-

1970*s I believe th® service itself recognised that.

We cite

it in our briefs and administrative regulations, where they
stated that the person was not to be required to produce
summaries or lists, that that was a job for the agent based
upon the testimony that he may have taken or the documents
that have been produced at the hearing.
QUESTION:
1«

What if he said in response to the same

question that we have been talking about, it is all on a data
processing system in my office and I just don't have any

30

recollection of it, and the people in the service say, well, ws
have no way of getting into your data processing machine,
would you just wrote out the summary of the net worth or name
or whatever it is as of January 1st and as of January 31st?
MR. ERWIN:

Well, again I do not think they could

be compelled to create that document.

Now, if It exists on

computer tape, the Second Circuit in United States v. Davey
has said that a computer tape which contains those types of
records is other data under the statute.
QUESTION:
MR. ERWIN:
QUESTION:

So that —
If that is in existence,
He could compel the retrieval of raw

data in the computer?
.

MR. ERWIN:

Well, the data case involved the pro­

duction of the actual tape itself rather than the retrieval of !
the data.,

I think most persons would rather retrieve the data j

voluntarily than turn over the tape if that is the only record
v I

they have.
QUESTION:

That wasn't ray question.

MR. ERWIN:

Yes.

Well, there is a suggestion that

32
the grand jury analogy, which Mr. Smith has made reference to,
is complete in this type of case, that the Congress intended
to give to the internal revenue agent the same power that the
grand jury has.

I believe that that is not correct, that the
.

grand jury and the internal revenue agent stand on different
j

footing, and while the analogy does have force in certain

situations, it does not have force in this particular situa-

JS

tion.

First of all, a grand jury, as was pointed out in

Constitution.

The Internal Revenue Service is a statutory

body.

It does not have inherent power a© a grand jury does to

compel the production of all types of evidence.
|] .

QUESTION:

Do you think that if Congress abolished

grand Juries, that law would be unconstitutional?
MR. ERWIN:

so

QUESTION:

Yes, I think it would.
The Constitution assures every defendant

in a federal criminal case that he can't be tried unless he is
indicted by a grand jury.
MR. ERWIN:

I believe it does in practically those
r

/

very words. Your Honor, and I believe that therefore it could
not be abolished.

There may be restrictions placed upon It,

but it could not be abolished.
QUESTION:

1

So maybe it -wouldn't be constitutional,

but nobody could be tried in a federal criminal court.

II

33
MR. ERWIN:

Right.

The functions of the grand jury are not the same as
the special agent4s function., as the agent of the Internal
Revenue Service.

I

There is a similarity and both of them —

QUESTION:

You are saying that somehow the guarantee

that Justice Stewart has commentad upon, upon the right of

j; ’ every

""

|

person to be indicted by a grand jury constitutionalizes

the right of the grand jury in a way that favors the govern­
ment over an act of Congress which authorises the service to
do something.

Is that what you mean?

MR. ERWIN:

Well, what I am saying is that the grand

jury has inherent power such as the court does in a pending
criminal case to order the production of this type of evidence.
As contrasted to the power of the Internal Revenue Service,
'

which is statutory, and if the statute does not provide for
that power, no matter how much they would like to have it or
might need it, they do not have it, and that is the point I am
.

■
;i

trying to make.
I would further point out that the grand jury has
two functions historically.

j

One is the investigative function

which the agent of the Internal Revenue Service also has o

The
»

other i£ to function as a protection of citizens of the
■
prosecutorial arm of the government. This is not something
that is shared by the agent of the Internal Revenue Service.
:

True, the Internal Revenue Service does not actually prosecute

i

34
the case if it comes to trial s but certainly they are aligned
with the; prosecution and they investigate, prepare the ease
and make recommendations»

Frequently agents or other employees

of the Internal Revenue Service participate in grand Jury pro­
ceedings for technical assistance and they frequently provide

expert witnesses at a criminal trial.
Finally, there is no neutral supervision of the is-

i

jn ;

■|
suance of a summons prior to its issuance except in very
limited cases aa set forth in section 7609.

There is super­

vision 3f the taxpayer objects, in which ease it goes to the
District Court and the matter is reviewed,
this does not occur very often.

It appears that

Taking the government5s

statistics from their briefs, in an 18-month period ending in
December ??8, it said that handwriting exemplars were used in
ii
ij

320 cases.

Our research has turned up only about 10 cases

reported and unreported in which the use of a summons was
u

revienred.

So it is less than five percent of the cases have

reviewed the use of summons for handwriting exemplars, and
\

this is in a situation where there is neough doubt about
whether the Internal Revenue Service even has the power that
j

is required for resolution by this Court.
It may be that the experience of the Internal
Revenue Service is such that it has revealed the need to be
able to use administrative summons to obtain, had meriting

li­

exemplars or voice exemplars or perhaps in exceptional eases

35
;

fingerprints, I believe even blood samples were mentioned.

But

it is our position that the present statute does not authorise
that»

It is an old statute that goes back many years.

There

was an existing practice at the time that the present statute
was enacted* a practice that had been in existence since the
19th Century for the production of documentary evidence, which
is the usual type of evidence used in a tax case, whether

It may be that the statute to that extent

is the body which has enacted the statute and given them power
to issue the summons in the first place.

It is our position

that the summons power should not be enlarged by this Court
under the guise ©f statutory construction to include within
Its scope that which Congress has excluded, and the judgment
of the Court of Appeals should be affirmed.
