ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM H. ALSOP, ESQ.s
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ALSUP;

Thank yon Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Courts
The issue presented in this case concerns the
•r

meaning of -the phrase “opportunity for public hearing" in
section 403(a) of th® Clean Water Act. and the extent to which
the Environmental Protection Agency may condition the
availability of an adjudicatory hearing on the submission of
a prior request for such a hearing setting forth a material
issue of fact.QUESTION'?

Your opening comment suggests to me

that at some point I hope you will discuss whether there is
a live case here any longer.
HR. ALSUP:
address -that now.
controversy.
Chief Justice.

Well, certainly S would be happy to

We do believe there is a continuing

I am not quite sure I follow the question, Mr.
Is there some particular reason that you

might believe that 'die case is no longer a live controversy?
QUESTION;
running out

I have some feeling that it may be

4
MR. ALSUPs

Well; it is true that the original

permit was granted, or extended in the action in question
through December 17 of this year*

But the case would not

become moot even if this Court were to rule on the ease some­
time in the spring ©r next year, because there is a pending
application for an additional permit by the City of Los
Angeles and by operation of the Administrative Procedure Act.
-*«* I believe it is section 558(c) — that application as long
as the agency does not act on the pending application would
extend by operation of law the expiration date in the existing
permit.
So therefore if the Court, for exaa?ple? were to
rule one way or -the other in April of next year and the agency
in the summer ©f next year war© to issue a

act on the

pending application'^id issue a new -peamit>* the 4>ld permit
at that point would expire by operation of law and not on
December 17 ©£ this month.

;

There is an additional reason why, it occurs to me,
why the case would not be moot.

And that is because the terms

and conditions of this permit are the subject of an enforce­
ment action in another lawsuit pending against 'the City of
Los Angeles in the District Court in Los Angeles.

And because

of the preclusion clause in section 509 of the Water Act, the
only means ©f determining the validity of the terms and
conditions that ara sought to be enforced are through a pre-

5
enforcement, review stilt such as the one at issue in this
litigation»
The case arises on the following factas
For several years the municipal sewage system of the
City.of Los Angeles has discharged treated sewage into Santa
Monica Bay»

Most of that sewage has ox.Iy received primary

treatment, that is a process by which the heavy solids sink
t© the bottom? and some 30 percent has received secondary
treatment, which is an additional step which removes some of
the chemical ossygen demand materials and suspended solids from
the sewage»
This process results in two end products»
•i

One of

these is ©ffluent — liquid effluent — and the city pumps thai
into Santa Monica Bay through a pips that is five miles long»
The second product is a muddy substance, liquidy
subiftmne® called sludge and that is pumped into Santa Monica
Bay through a different pip®»

That one is seven miles long»

New, under the Clean Water Act it is unlawful to
pump these materials into Santa Monica Bay without a permit

l

«

called a NPD.ES permit -- National Pollution Discharge
Elimination System Permit — which is set up tlje scheme in
, \

section 402 of th© Act»

j
i

Now, although section 402 allows the- States to
operate their own NPDES program^that doesn’t apply for
discharges beyond the three-mile limit»

So only the Environ-

6

mental Protection Agency may issue permits for the fivaand the seven-mile outfalls that are involved in this case»
There is also & ©no-mil® outfall at this plent called the
Hyperion plant in Los Angeles and for that one-mile outfall*
because it falls within the three-mile limit* the Stats issues
an HPDES permit»
Now. on August 18* 1975 the EPA issued such & permit
for the five- and the' seven-mile outfalls»

And the State

Water Quality Eoard issued a permit for the one-mil© outfall»
Th®s® wsr© combined into a single document that received two
numbers:

a Federal permit number and a Stats permit number»
This document* this permit contains several

compliance schedules which ar® designed as timetables to
eventually get the polluter to meet the statutory require­
ments»

And there are two of those compliance schedules that

have bean disputed in this cas®»

j
/

•;

On© of thos© compliance schedules governs the fiverail© pipe through which the city pumps the effluent and it
requires that 10G-pere©nt secondary treatment of all the
effluent through that pips eventually be attained rather than
the 30 pereant that it now achieves»
The second compliance schedule in this case is the
so-called sludge out schedule»

That one pertains to the

seven-mil® outfall and that schedule requires the City of Los
Angeles to phase out completely its discharge of sludge through,

7
that seven-mil© outfall in Santa Monica Bay.
New* with that background, the immediate issue in
this case concerns the procedure used'by EPA to implement the
phrase 45opportunity for public hearing® in section 402 which
provides -that the Administrator may, after opportunity for
public hearing, issue a permit for the discharge of any
pollutant upon the condition that it meet a number of statutory
requirements*
New, in 1974 EPA published regulations that defined
in detail how a parson could go about getting various types
of public hearings and the regulations, which are set forth
at Part

140(c) of Part 125, describe thsre© basic kinds of

hearingso
First, there is a public legislative-type hearing
"at which the public can come and make oral arguments or written
presentations on hen? they feel about the proposed action by
BPA in either granting or denying a request for a permit.

Th® second is called an adjudicatory hearing«

That

is a trial-type hearing at which evidence Is received and
findings are made 0 QUESTIONS

Those are kind of analagous to differences

in the Administrative Procedure Act, are they not?
MR* ALSUP:

They are analogous to rule-making versus

adjudication under the APAe,

But we do take the position that

adjudication does not necessarily mean that precisely til©

i
types of adjudication undar the APii or, for that matter, that
rule-making would — although we don’t reach that question
in this case -— but that the public legislative-type hearing
doesn’t necessarily have to follow sections 556 and 557 of
*
th© APA. —
QUESTIONt

l realise that, but «hat I w&n getting

at was that your distinction is similar t© that mad® in the
APA«.

One is kind of a regulation of legislative effect having

broad effect on what th® agency proposes to do interpreting
a provision of the statute will 'have in future applicability
to a broad msaber of people*

And an adjudication being a

much narrower determination of a factual natura as to what
"'happened on a particular day or what didn’t happen on $
particular day*.
MR* ALSUP:

That is generally correct, but there is

soma similarity in ’this sens®:

that both of these hearings

are directed to whether or not a license should be issued*
A

And in that sense there is — even at public hearing — a
specific concrete action before th® house*
QUESTION:

So that the legislative-* typ© hearing

that you described is more like an adjudicatory hearing than it
Would be under the APA0
MR* ALSpP: . 1 think that is correct®
Than there is a third type of hearing ■— although
the regulations don’t call it a hearing — and that is where

9

If season® had a legal objectio» to the issuance of a permit*
that legal objection could be referred to the general counsel
of the agencythe parties would have an opportunity to
submit briefs? and although there wouldn1t be an oral argument
or evidence received* the agency through ‘the general counsel
would still determine* or make a ruling* on that statutory or
legal objection®

IcOl F*M.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You may resume, Mr„

Alsup®
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM H. ALSUP* ESQ. (RESUMED) *
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
ME. MjSUPs

Thank you* Mr, Chief Justice* and may

it piaas© the Courts
As I was saying before® the recess* the regulations
promulgated in 1974 provided for basically three types of
hearings:

the public legislative-type hearing* the adjudicatory

hearing and the procedure by which legal objections could be
determined by general counsel»
The regulations also imposed threshold requirements
£or each ©f these type hearings.

The public legislative-type

hearing would only b© held if, after giving public notice of
what the EPA intended to do* the Regional Administrator
determined that there was significant public interest in the
proposed action®
The adjudicatory hearing would be held only if
someone presented a question — not just someone* but i:n
interested party presented & request for an adjudicatory hear­
ing that set forth a material issue ©f fact.

And the regulations

were quite specific on that* they said the request to be
denied* and must be denied* if no such requests presenting

II
a material issue of fact war© filed»
tod than finally -the only requirement for getting
a legal determination was that sosaone submit a request
■ stating an objection based on legal grounds to proposed course
of action»

l\

*
In the present s&s®, vhen the 1975 permit was issued

.

-*» on August IS of IS75 ■—« the EPA announced its proposed
action of Issuing the permit to the City of Los Angeles»

.It

gave notis® — public notide — held & public hearing and
then issued a permit»

That is the permit that I described a

moment ago containing the compliance schedules»
No ©a© ®fe that time sought review under section 509
' of the Act to have that action set aside»
Y

Similarly, when that permit expired by its own terms
la early 1977, the agency went through that same procedures
held a public hearing, received continents at that hearing»
' extended th© permit for six months through June 30, 19 77 with
no other modification other than simply extending the
expiration date of th© permit»

Once again, no one challenged

that action»
Than, on April 27, 1977, EPA announced, and this

was looking forward to the June 30 deadline when the permit
would expire again, EPA announced that it proposed to extend
the permit once again, this time to December 17 of this y©e.r0
The agency made this announcement by publishing in the Los

12
Angeles Tiises on April 21 a statement saying what it proposed
to do* saying that requests — invited the public to file
requests for the public-type hearing and stated that on© would
fee held if there were significant public interest in the
'action®

And* in addition * stated that there would also be

an opportunity under the regulations for requests for an
adjudicatory hearing.
QUESTION:

Mr. Alsup* could I interrupt there*

because X have eoias difficulty* frankly* understanding the
City ©£ Los Angeles* position in the case®
What did you do* just extend the date by which the
changes had to fe® mads* the sludge out and the improvement on
the liquid?

Is that all that happened* if gave Los Angeles

more time to comply?

MR. ALSOPt The action that was taken on both
occasions was really to extend the expiration date of the
permit itself®
’

QUESTION:
MR® ALSUPs

•
All right®
It did not not modify in any the

compliance schedule deadline dates —•
QUESTION:

I see®

MR. ALSUPs “*->• that were in the original permit in
1975®
Mow* it. is true that Los Angeles believes that EPA
somehow acquiesced in the State schedule for compliance which

13

was sstendsd by the Stata, we be Have that Los Angeles is in
error on that and that EPA never acquiesced in mid never
modified its mm compliance schedule fco achieve the so-called
" ultimate sludge out.
QUESTION%

i quite resily haven't been able to under*

stand hew just merely extending the termination date of the
permit? how could that adversely affect- the

City of Los

Angeles in any way?
MR. ALSUPs

Well s I don*t- -think it would, in on®

sensei end,that is because by law the city must have one of
these penults.
altogether.

Otherwise r they have to discontinue discharging

So, in a B®n&@g they are really not complaining

' about tie existence ©f the permit hut rather the conditions?
the compliance schedule that was imposed in -that permit.
QUESTIONS

They are saying teat the Federal permit

"'should have been modified to follow the State schedule.
MR. ALBOPi
‘ more ths-n that.

1 actually think they are saying much

Their basic position seems to be as doss

' ’RLF*s aad Kilroy1 a that the compliance schedule should be
eliminated altogether because tear® is no environmental harm
‘ in pumping that sludge into tee ocean? and that there should
be a© compliance schedule at all but rather what ERA should
do is set some maximum effluant level that could be perpetually
achieved by the city by continuing to pump forever into the
ocean

14
QUESTION:

That is a position they could have taken

hack in —■ whan the original August 18«. *75 permit was issued,
isn®t it?
MR. ALSUPs
taken that position.
QUESTION!

That 1© absolutely right, they could have
They did not.
And they could have taken it again in

January of *77, and they didtest.
MR. ALSDPs
QUESTIONS
MS. MsSUPs

That is correct.
2 sea.
tod I have to say I d©n!t think fehoy

took fchi.t position even in the extension that occurred in June
of 1977, although they had taken that position in correspondence
with the agency concerning a grant to- -the city to assist it in
its waste water treatment.
Well, again, no one commented on this April 27
notice, no ©a® requested a public legislative-type hearing;
even the City of Los Angeles, and a person©! copy was mailed
to them of this proposed action. ■
And so on June 2, 1977 the Regional Administrator
determined to go ahead and extend the permit with the compliance
schedules intact as before.
Now, that action triggered the tan-day period within
which someone could file a request for an adjudicatory hearing
and on June -- that is under the regulations — and on June
13f Mr. Kilroy did? ha filed it, being represented by the

15
Pacific Legal Foundation*
As 1 mentioned -though , the regulations require
;

that any such requests set forth a material issue of fact if
you want to have a trial**type hearing.
: 125,36(c).

That is section

The Regional Administrator looked at the request

" and concluded that it only raised legal issues and so advised
Pacific Legal Foundation and saidi “You don't raise factual
issuesr you raise legal issues,

1 am referring your legal

' issues to our third procedure, that is the general counsel
will a a*? determine th© validity of your legal objections
And the Pacific Legal Foundation on behalf of
Itilroy was asked to file a brief on those issues,

And Pacific

Legal Foundation did and said, “These are the issues ^feat we
plan to raise and we meant to raises and it is clear from -that
brief which is in the record that those wore not facturi issues,
those were purely legal issues,®
Now, th© general counsel then ruled against, ELF,
end that should have been th® end 'of -th© case, in our view.
However, it wasn’t.

Pacific Legal Foundation, Kilroyr the

City ©f Lob Angeles, and mcm tha City of Torrance, which is
a neighbor to Los Angeles, filed patifelons for review under
section 509 in the Court: of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,
Th© Court of Appeals ruled against EPA,

It didrr t question th©

general counsel's treatment of th© legal issues, which were
the only issues ever tendered to the agency,

That somehow

16

naver was addressad»

Rather, th® Court of appeals sat aside

the sludge out schedule* that is the on© that applies to that
savea*»mile pipe, and said:

“You can*fc enforce that any more;

because you, BP A, did net provide an adjudicatory hearing.*.®

QUESTION:

18
MR® ALSBP*

Wall, the Ninth Circuit didn't actually

say that.
QUESTIONs

X suppose consistent with their theory

they could &ayf no* they wouldn't b® bound.
MR. ALSUFt

1 think that is correct.

They might say

I believe that the 'theory of the Court of Appeals was that the
EPA has an affirmative duty to get in there and dig out all
the possible factual issues that sight exist.

And then even

if no one showed up at the hearing* to flush out those issues.
QUESTIONS

Imagine you had an enemy — imagine you

had ass opponent e and go at it that, way. .
MR. ALSUP:

The Ninth Circuit did not actually say

that but we think that is the practical implication.
In our view, if it would be permissible -- if the
Ninth Circuit sight, say, "Well of course if that happened you
wouldn't hav© to hold a hearing if a© ©si® shewed up."
But our response to that. .La:

Well, if that is true*

then why should we be required to hold & hearing it all if
no one bothers to even request one?

We don't think that those

are substantially greater burdens to place on the public.
Well* our basic disagreement with the Ninth Circuit's
holding is twofolds
First of all? the. phrase "opportunity for public
hearing" doss not prohibit the agency from imposing reasonable
threshold: requirements on the availability of a hearing.

And

19
barring at the threshold those people %?h© don*t satisfy those
threshold requirements*

This was the holding ©£ the court

in the Gfcorer case ©nd the Weinberger v9 Ejnsan cme and in
the Xleppe case* among others«,
For example* in the Storer case the FCC issued a
rule* the statute there said anyone could have a hearing on
■' their license s it seemed to be mandatory*
Court 3aid;

But in fact the

“Ho., the FCC can say we are not going to issues

■ a license to someone who already owns more than X number of
radio stations* so that these people would just be barred at
the threshold*83

and the Court went further to say that '«die

FCC would entertain waivers of that policy? but it would only
entertain waivers and they still wouldn't be entitled to a
hearing unless the facts set forth in the application for
waiver were sufficient, if true, to warrant a waiver in the
opinion of the FCC,
In the Kleppe csis®, which involved an Act under
which coal operators were assessed with fines, the statute
•there said, just like it does here, "opportunity for public
hearing before those fines are assessed***

But this Court

held, no, the agency can issue a regulation saying that
you have to request that hearing*

And if you don’t request

the hearing, then it is deemed to ba waived*
And we have almost an identical-type regulation in
this case*

20

It seams to use then that the issue is whether or
not this requirement for an adjudicatory hearing — that is
set forth a material issue of fact — is one which is a reason­
able threshold requirement under the decisions of this Court»
'And w© think it is*. for this reasons

If it is not

a factual issue*> then there is no need for evidence or an
evidentiary hearing»

If it is not a material issue*, then there

is no need to consider it anyway»

And if there is no request

made f it is rests enable to conclude people have no factual
objection, to the course of action that 'the agency proposes to
take „
The second basic objection that we have is that this
imposes an onerous burden on EPA®

Now*, of course if the statute

calls for it*, then we have to live with it®
But in the Du Pont casaf Du Pont v® Train» this Court
construing the vary same statute said that it would be reluctant
to construe the Clean Water Act to impose an onerous burden on
the agency*, because it would be hard to believe that Congress
intended such a burden to be imposed®
This is vary analagous to what would happen here®
Each year the agency issued about 2200 of these permits but
in the p asfc only about 100 adjudicatory hearings have been
held®
Under the practical implication of the Ninth Circuits
opinion, the agency in most cases would now begin to hold

21
hearings not in just 100 but in close to 2200 cases a year»
Because if we didn*fc do that, we would have to bear what the
Ninth Circuit called raa vary heavy burden of showing that a
hearing would have served absolutely no purpose.'*

T
V

So that the practical thing to do to avoid that
problem would simply be to hold one of these hearings, receive
evidence, if the Ninth Circuit eventually required that,
rather than to do what we do now? and that is simply to sea
if anyone requests one on a material issue of fact.
I would like to reserve the balance of our time for
rebuttal, with the Court*s permission*
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well/ Mr. Alsup.

Mr® Best®
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT K„ BEST*. ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. BESTs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
The underlying dispute which causes this litigation
to go forward is a dispute over a project in the City of Los
Angeles which is called the Interim Sludge Disposal Projacto
Now, it is true when we challenged the permit we
were concerned about other issues but the primary underlying
concern was this Interim Sludge Dispose! Project which has
been mentioned by Mrc Alsup.

This project created a

substantial controversy when it was first, announced by EPA

22

in a negativa declaration in November of 1976a

Now, it is

true that the permit requirements were issued in IS75 but if
you look at the permit as it is contained in the appendix,
you will see that it does not say what the disposal project is
going to be when the sludge discharge is terminated; it does
not detail what it is going to he*
So interested parties had no way of knowing what
they were dealing with until the negative declaration announced
the content, and that is when the controversy first arose*
I think the Court should understand that what this
project is and, in particular, what this project is not*

It

is argued in the brief and Mr* Alsup has indicated that this
project proceeds pursuant to a compliance schedule which is
going tc terminate the sludge discharge.

It does not do that*

This project is what it says it is, it is an interim project,
an interim sludge disposal project which modifies the sludge
discharge pending some eventual decision about what the sludge
dischargi should bac
This modification, in essence what happens, instead
of pumping the sludge out into the ocean it goes through large
centrifuges, centrifuges split into two products;

one, a semi-

liquid goo which is the xaain product of the sludge, which ia
supposed to be trucked through huge gondola trucks and dumped
in landfills in the Los Angeles area*

And the estimates, if

you read the City of Los Angeles'’ description of this, which

23
is in 'die appendix,, it says that if you live along that route
one of -these huge trucks is going to pass your home every
3“1/2 minutes*
How, there still remains the primarily liquid
product which is produced by the centrifuges, which still
contains high concentrations of sludge particles and other
materials in the sludge*

Under this project, that continues

to be discharged out into the ocean*
So we are not implementing the requirements of the
Water Act, we are not terminating the sludge discharge by -this
interim sludge disposal project*

And that is one of the

concerns that needs to ba addressed in any public hearing*
QUESTION s

What do you have to say about Mr*

Alsup’s assertion and

in

the briefs that no factual issues

were raised initially?
MR* BEST*

Are you referring to the request for an

adjudicatory hearing, Mr* Chief Justice?
QUESTION s

Yes*

MR* BESTi

We would have two answers to that*

Initially, X will describe for you our view of the
facts as they progressed^ which is considerably different
from the description by Mi:* Alsup*
facts which progressed

we

We believe that under ids®

had no way of putting into a request

for a hearing detailed factual issues*

The purpose of the

request of a requirement for the statement of factual issues

24

of course is to be able to determine whether the factual
issues upon which the agency9s decision rests are in dispute,
not just factual issues in general*

But at the time we had

to prepare the request for- adjudicatory hearing, SPA had
withheld from us the decision, they had withheld any
information as to why the- reasons for the decision*

They

have provided us only with a telephone call which said, wWa
took the action on June 2, if you want an adjudicatory hearing
you must request it today*El

___

......

That is why when you look in the record, it is a
telegraphic request for hearing that was prepared in a matter
of a couple of hours to meet a mandate by the Environmental
Protection Agency that it be on file within two days*
So we believe that under those facts, the fact that
this request for hearing stated only general issues is accept-"
able*
Besides that, w© had been in dispute with EPA*
knew what the issues wera we were concerned about*

EPA

Before the

Court of Appeals
QUESTION;

When was the hearing scheduled? how long

after was it until there was a hearing?
MR. BEST;

There has never been the hearing*

QUESTION;

I know, but you submitted a request for a

MR* BEST;

There was naver scheduled*

hearing*
It was denied*

25
QUESTIONS

And you requested that,you posed legal

issues# or what?
MR. BSSTs

When we submitted the request for hearing

we were interested in raising the issues relating to the interim
sludge disposal project# which are factual issues?

when should

it be implemented# can we get the trucks# what landfill should
be utilised; these are factual issues.
The request for hearing does say should the compliance
schedule in -the permit go forward# pending the environmental
studies that will give us the information relating to what land­
fill should be used# and so forth.

But it is the compliance

schedule for the interim sludge disposal project that is
challenged in that request for hearing.

And we believe that

that was a specific enough notice of the factual issues we
wanted to litigate.
that.

The EFA before the Court of Appeals admitted

It stated to the Court of Appeals that the only issues

that ware made were procedural legal Issues and issues relating
t

to the interim sludge disposal project.
And so we believe that in fact it did raise the factual
issues.
QUESTIONs

I am just trying to get the chronology in

:uind®
You said the negative declaration in November of
.1976# X believe it was# advised you of the interim sludge
disposal project?

26

MRa BEST;

That is correct®

QUESTION;

And then after that, if I have ray notes

correct, there was a public hearing in January of 1977 concern*»
ing the preceding six-month extension®
Was -the matter that you are now interested in having
the subject of hearing, the subject of that hearing?
MR* BEST;

It was not discussed at that hearing®

Let me briefly recount the facta so you can have your
chronology straight, Mr* Justice Stevens®
After the negative declaration, the controversy arcs©
and we became involved®

We sent to the City of Los Angeles and

said, "*Efeat is a bad project, let's talk about what, should be
done®**

And the City of Los Angeles 3aid, "There is nothing

we can do about it, it is required by the Environmental
Protection Agency in a permit®w
We then proceeded to write to. the Environmental
Protection Agency,and that letter is in -the record, where we
said, "Walt a minute®

We don’t want these requirements included

in any future permit and we specifically ask that before -they
are included in any future permit, that the agency go through
the full public participation requirements in the Act®53
H»?, the Environmental Protection Agency says that
wasn* fc a request for a legislative»*type hearing, because we
didn't use the word "hearing®”

All we asked for was the full

v

public participation rcjquiremsnt®

27
QUESTION?

When was that done?

MR® BEST:

That was done in December of 1976®

QUESTION?

Just before “~

MR® BEST:

Shortly before that,, there had been an

announcement in the Lcs Angeles Times that this permit was going
to be reconsid®red, the terms and conditions were going to be
reconsidered®

■jr<

■'

'

The action that EPA took then,, in January of 1B11 e was
to temporarily defer action on a. final decision of what to do
with the 'permit®

They said, "We need more time*

in the record as-well

this la

"We need more time to review these

requirements in this permit, so we are going to extend this
temporarily while we review the requirements in the permit®"
QUESTION:

You don’t contend that the notice in the

L.A® Times in December was not sufficient to give you an
opportunity to be heard as to -the issues specified in the
notice, do you?
MR® BEST:

No, we do not contend that®

The notices in

the Lc,A® Times as to the January issue was deficient, because
it was issued strictly by the State Board®

The Environmental

Protection Agency never issued a notice as to that January
meeting®
So they went forward and conducted their action without adequate notice®

But when we sew the action we didn’t

object to the action, so wo didn’t raise any claims against the

28
action®
QUESTION:

Well, wasn't there a December notice

published by the EPA?
MR* BEST:

There was not.®

In the record is our request

for that notice, and -the notice they sent back to us was publish­
ed by the Regional Board®

There was no notice published by the

Environmental Protection Agencyc
QUESTION:

And you say the publication by a Regional

Board is insufficient®
MR® BEST:

It is insufficient for the Environmental

Protection Agency®
How, this is a part -»
QUESTION:

Why is it insufficient?

Why can't it

MR, BEST:

Because the Environmental Protection Agency

delegate?

maintains as a position in this action that the Regional Board
has no authority as to its permit»

Nobody realised this at the

time but the Environmental Protection Agency says, KNcw,, the
actions taken by the Regional Board modifying the compliance
schedule were in fact not valid, were not actions of the
Environmental Protection Agency®”
If the actions taken by the Bocird modifying the permit
are not valid, then the actions by the Board notifying that
they are going to have hearings on modifications would not be
valid as to EPA

29
In addition —
QUESTIONS

Take a kind of down to earth example of

a typical State procedure where probating a will you have a
requirement the executor give notice ten days that the will
will be offered for probate»

And a notice is published that

idle will of so and so will be offered for probate at 9 s 30 in
such and such a division of such and such a court»

And some­

one comes in later «and proves that although that notice was
given conformed to idle statute in every way# actually it wasn’t
the executor that authorized its publication# it was somebody
else# although it complied with all the substantive requirements
of the statute»
Would you say such a notice was deficient?
MR» BEST:

I would not argue such a notice was

deficient# Mr» Justice Rahnquist# but that is not the facts in
this case»
B’irst of all# as I say# EPA maintains that the State
Board has no legal authority to act for or bind the Environ­
mental Protection Agency»

That is the position of the Environ­

mental Protection Agency# as I understand it»
QUESTION:

Where do we find that?

MR» BEST:

You can determine that from the Solicitor»

The other point is the notice by the Regional Board
does not comply with -the Environmental Protection Agency’s
regulations as to what should be in a notice for the Environ-

30

mental Protection Agency's action0
QUESTION %

Can you tell ms now where we would find

that in this Appendix or in these briefs?
MR» BESTs

Which record is that?

QUESTIONS

The statement that you just made* even

a ministerial act can't be delegated to the regional body0
MRa BESTs
that*

There is nothing in the briefs that say

It is the Environmental Protection Agency which maintains

in its brief and in the reply brief in particular, that the
actions by the State Board are not binding on the Environmental
Protection Agency.,
QUESTION?

Well, but to say it is not binding isn't

the same thing as saying that notice published by the State
Board may not be an adaquate substitute for a notice required
by a statute from the Environmental Protection Agency®
MR® BEST?

Mr® Justice Rehnquisfc, I am willing to
!

accept that statement0

But I would again point out, first of

all, that the notice a® published did not meet the requirements
•V

,

of the Environmental Protection Agency's regulations»

The

State Board published its notice pursuant to Stata law, which
has completely different requirements concerning the content
of the notice®
The second thing is we have never challenged the
adequacy of that notios, and I don't wish to challenge it t©~
day®

We did not challenge the. January proceeding, because the

31

January proceeding was satisfactory to usc

It extended the

time for the permit so that they could reconsider the require­
ments in the permits

And that is what we wanted to have done»

And it was our argument that more time was necessary,, we had
to change this compliance schedule in order to get the time
to consider these issues0

And so we did not challenge that

issue»
QUESTION:

Can I ask you another question in trying

to understand the chronology»
Have they started hauling the sludge pursuant to the
Interim Sludge Disposal Project yet?
MR» BESTj

The Interim Sludge Disposal Project is not

under way®

*
As I understand it «—
QUESTION?

When is it —

MR= BESTs

tha centrifuges are still in storage

here on the East Coast*
QUESTIONS

Does the record tell us when it may get

HR» BESTs

It will not get under way as long as the

under way?

stay put in affect by the Ninth Circuit remains in effect»
QUESTIONs

Well, the permit that is now in effect

expires a couple of wetks from nowf as I understand it»
MR» BESTs
December 1?»

The permit by its term expires on

32
QUESTIONS

Is it not probable that before it can be

extended again there will have to be some kind of a notice of
a proceeding to .extend it again?
MR* BEST?

We believe before it can be extended again

EPA must go back -through its entire process f issue its notice,
give us our public hearingF and if necessary —QUESTIONt

If it gives you that notice before —

between now and Dacamber 17 — will you then have an opportunity
to argue everything you want to argue concerning the Interim
Sludge Disposal Project?
MR* BESTs

That is correct,. Mr* Justice Stevens*

QUESTIONS

Then ;hy do we have to decide *»-*

MR*. BESTs

Because the Environmental Protection Agency

refuses to start the permit proceedings*

We have asked them

what ~“*
QUESTION?

If they vacated the stay just, today? if

they vacated the stay, what would happen?
MR* BESTs

If they vacated -the stay* that would

delight the Environmental Protection Agencyf because then they
could go ahead and enforce this permit which has these require**
menta that we want modified*
QUESTION?

Well,, isn't it going to take them more

than between now and December 17 to start hauling sludge?
MR. BESTs

It certainly will*

But the key is by not

acting# by inaction the Environmental Protection Agency ante-»

33
matically extends the permit pursuant to section 558 of the
EPA because the City of Los Angeles has filed an application
for a new permit, which includes some of these modifications
we are concerned about»
QUESTION;

Well, can't you get a hearing in connection

with that extension?
MR. BEST;

We certainly can.

Our concern is — Mr. Justice Stevensc our concern
here today is that if the stay is vacated and EPA does nothing,
then 'chis case merrily goes forward and they can require the
permit to be implemented»

I assume that they will proceed with

their enforcement action that they have already filed against
the City of Los Angeles where they are asking the Court to
order the City of Los Angeles to implement the Interim Sludge
Disposal. Project.

And I presume they will proceed with, that

end they will just not issue a new permit.
QUESTION;

Wo are now touching on what I asked the

Solicitor General at the outsets

What ere we really doing here

now?
MR. BESTs

Quite frankly, Mr. Chief Justice, we don’t

understand why we are here■ because the Environmental
Protection Agency should be going through the process of
issuing a new permit.

If that process were under way, there

would be no reason for us to be here today.
The problem is the Environmental Protection Agency

34
is not, -and they have told us that they will not initiate
proceedings on this permit until the courts resolve what
procedural requirements they have to go through„
that means this honorable Court*

I assume

And that is why we are

concerned*
The permit proceedings should have been initiated
six months ago.

.For a permit as complicated as this it takes

at least four# possibly mere months to go through the process
Under EPATs new regulations for the NPDES

to get it issued*

permits, a n on con trove rsia1 permit takes two months before it
goes into effect*
QUESTIONs

Well, the EPA simply disagrees with the

Ninth Circuit's interpretation of the opportunity for hearing
language in the statute# as I understand it0
HR. BEST;
this Court»

That is the case they are presenting to

We do not believe that in fact that case even

arises out of the Ninth Circuit decision.

First of all#

remember the Ninth Circuit -«* before the Ninth Circuit was
never an issue a3 to what type of a hearing should be held.
No hearing was held.

So it wasn't a question of should this

be a legislative-type hearing or an adjudicatory-type hearing.
It is just a question as to whether any type of hearing should
have been held.

We argue that there was substantial public

interest in this matter, it was well known the Administrator
had filed -- the Regional Administrator had filed an affidavit

35

under penalty of perjury saying it was controversial and that
the legislative-type hearing should have been helds
3ays,

The EPA

"Well, if nobody asks for a hearing, then that means

there is no public interest0"
We pointed out that EPA's public participation
regulations which apply tc the NPDES permit,and which the EPA
entirely ignores in this lawsuit,require that a hearing be
held not only if there is significant p^iblic interest but also
if there is pertinent information to be gained«>

Clearly there

is pertinent information to be gained here, and the Ninth
Circuit so held0
QUESTION:

Well, then, the EPA wants us to reverse

the Ninth Circuito
HR„ BEST:

That is righto

The EPA wants you to

reverse the Ninth Circuit so that the stay will foe lifted and
so that their interpretation of the Ninth Circuit decision that
it requires them to conduct an adjudicatory hearing will be
off the booka

Vie don*t believe the Ninth Circuit decision

requires them to conduct an adjudicatory hearing in all
caseso
The general holding of the Ninth Circuit that goes
beyond the facts of this case is limited to the statement that
under section 402 of the Water Act, considering the legislative
history about using these hearings for public participation
and involvement of citizens, when a hearing is not held under

36

section 402 and it is challenged# the Environmental Protection
Agency must present seme kind of a record — seme kind of a
record to the Court to justify that there wan no reason for
a hearing, preferably by showing that none of the facts upon
which -die decision rest are in dispute»

That is idle general

holding»
QUESTIONs

Well, ordinarily aren*t those -things

resolved by having someone come in and say there are factual
issues and they are as follows and we want a hearing; was that
done here?
MR» BEST?

Resolved before the Court, Mr» Chief

QUESTIONs

No, no, the hearing that. ERA said, in

Justice?

effect, it was waived»

The EPA says that no one asked for a

hearing here»
MR» BESTs

That is correct»

No one asked for the

legislative-”type hearing,, because we received no notice that
the legislative-type hearing was under way»

We did ask

Mr» Kilroy asked for an adjudicatory-typs hearing»
QUESTION s

That Is what the Court of Appeals has

MR» BESTs

The remand .language, Mr» Justice White,

ordered»

says

proper hearing»"1
We believe that the Court of Appeals said EPA did not

conduct a legislative-type hearing»

37
lThen you read the beginning of —
QUESTIONS

Yesf but the court’s language is \;hat it

was unable to deny an adjudicatory hearing on the ground that
none of the material facts upon EPA’s decision rests are
disputed»
MR, BEST:

The court does use that language»

I would

point out «**"
QUESTIONi

Well*

MR. BEST:

But here -the adjudicatory «-

QUESTION:

Do you think it would comply with the

SO —

remand order if an adjudicatory hearing was not held?
•

MR» BEST:

We certainly do* and I will explain why.

An adjudicatory hearing war; requested — Mr. 'Justice White*
ass adjudicatory hearing was requested and so if the Court
found that the request was raised was adequate* then EPA
■ >

was obligated to give an adjudicatory hearings and since •
the request was on file.
'

The beginning of this section •— if you read the

beginning of this section where the court analyzes the question
about:

Can we order a hearing when there has been no request?

Should there have been a hearing held before the June 2 decision?
These are the questions the court addresses.

That applies to

the legislative hearing* it doesn’t apply to the adjudicatory
hearing.

Only the legislative hearing is held before the June

2 decision.

Only the legislative hearing was there no requests

38
submitte do
And so we believe what the Ninth Circuit was saying
is essentially it followed- the flow of the case.
look at the legislative-Shearing.

It said, let's

Can we order a legislative

hearing where there has been no hearing requested?
And it concluded that under the facts of this case,
the facts that no hearing was requested,, was insufficient,

And

it went on and discussed an adjudicatory hearing and concluded
that likewise — in the language of the court -- wa hearing
after an adjudicatory hearing is better than no hearing at

alio"
QUESTIONS

So we listen to this argument and we take

the case under submission.

What would be the status of the

case a couple of months from now?
MR, BEST?

The status of the case a couple of months

from now, I would certainly hope that it would be moot, that
the Environmental Protection Agency will start it procedures
to issue a new permit,
I cannot say what EPA will do,
QUESTION:

Do we have to wait a couple of months?

Thirteen days will talc.® you beyond the 17th of December,
MR, BESTs

Yes, but, Mr. Chief Justice, I have to

emphasize that' under section 558 of the AP& this permit remains
in effect as long as the City of Los Angeles has filed an
application for a new permit and the EPA has not acted,

And

39

so by just not acting, EPA will extend this permit for as long
as — until the city decides to mandate it*
QUESTIONs

Of course the entire thing is subject to

a stay of the Court, of Appeals*
MR® BESTs
Appeals®

It is subject to a stay of the Court of

But if this Court were to remand for mootness„ we

would lose that stay®
QUESTIONS

Well,, what if we *— what if two months

from now we decided against you*, what would the EPA have to
do?
MR* BESTs

Wall* I would hope that if the decision

goes against us* that it would be remanded to the Court of
Appeals

;o reconsider in light of the decision of this Court*
QUESTION;

By that time tine

if we decide against

you* the stay is dissolved* the EPA has held all the hearing
that it needed to hold «- the only thing is* the permit has
expired*
MR* BESTs

The permit will not expire until a new

permit in issued*
QUESTION;

I knows but they are going to have to

start over*
MR* BESTs

That is right*

They should have started

over six months ago*
QUESTION;

But I suppose they had some interest in

finding out what they had to do when they started over*

40

MR» BBSTs

They maintained to us that that is what

they —- why they are —
QUESTION:

That is what they are maintaining now,

MR« BEST:

That is right, that they were not taking

too, .

action on this permit until they know what is required»
QUESTION s

What if we decide for you* what happens?

MR„ BEST:

If you decide for us, then we will go back

to the Environmental Protection Agency and ask them to start
the proceedings on' the new permit»
QUESTIONS

We are not interested in ~

So in any event, whichever way the case

is decided, all you are talking about is what kind of procedures
should the EPA follow in issuing the new permit»
MR9 BEST:

Well, quite honestly —

QUESTION %

That is your position, I take it?

MR» BESTs

Our position is that the EPA*s procedures

as put out in its original regulations, the regulations which
were in effect at the time of this, were adequate»

And that

the Court of Appeals did not invalidate any of those regu­
lations®

We maintained that we complied with those regulations

and that therefore we should have had a hearing»

We maintained

that those regtilations required EPA to conduct the legislative
hearings»
Now, we have serious reservations about the adequacy
of the new regulations relating to adjudicatory hearings, because

41
they are much more onerous than the old ones»
*

But that is not

at issue»
QUESTIONj
would help meB

Perhaps you can explain something that

On page 22~A of the opinion, reading the end

of the paragraph. Section 4 of the Ninth Circuit's opinion, the
last sentence iss
"An adjudicatory hearing undoubtedly will yield a
- - record that will provide the reasons for the extension»w
Then in a few other places in the final paragraphs
under the title of Remand and Guidelines, the language is "a
proper hearing»"
How, is "a proper hearing" to be treated, the
adjectives "proper" to be treated as equivalent to the adjective
"adjudicatory"?
MR» BEST2

Mr» Chief Justice, we believe not»

We

believe that the Court of Appeals deliberately used the
adjective "proper" instead of the adjective "adjudicatory" and
it remanded it for a proper hearing»

Remember, the court says

in its opinion that if it were presented with an adequate
record demonstrating that what had been done was proper, it
would have to reconsider its decision that it was not — that
the opportunity for hearing had not been given»

And it did not

say what that record need to be»
QUESTIONs

Of course no one would dispute the

proposition that there ought to be a "proper" hearing, if

42
that means the hearing required by law®
MR® BESTs

We believe it means a hearing as require!

by EPA*s regulations»
QUESTIONs

And what kind of a hearing is that* again?

MR® BEST?

There are two kinds of hearings®

QUESTIONS

Which one does '’proper'5 mean?

MR® BESTs

We believe that it means start over again

with the legis1ative-type hearing* because the hearing in EPAas
context is a two-step process®

Much like section 554 of the

APA, 'the adjudicatory provision of the APA lays out a two-step
process®

Firsts you have an informal addressing of the issues*

where you present your complaint and you try to resolve it®
If that is unsatisfactory and you are unable to resolve your
differences* then you go forward to a formal®

We believe that

in essence that is the hearing concept within section 402 as
EPA*s regulations defined it®

So a "proper” hearing requires

that EPA go back and start with the informal resolution process*
in other words the legislative-type hearing®

And if we can

resolve our differences there* the case would end there®
QUESTIONS

When you get a legislative —* there is

nothing in her© about the legislative®
MR® BESTs

That is a term that was adopted by the

Environmental Protection Agency in their brief to describe the
initial hearing which they hold without going through the
adjudicatory provisions®

It is a non-adversary hearing that

43

you start out.
QUESTIONS

Mr® Bast»» is there anything in the record

that now requires the Interim Sludge Disposal Project to
commence?
MR* BESTs

The Interim Sludge Disposal -»

QUESTION?

Any order oustanding?

Is there anything

that now requires Los Angeles to go forward with that project?
MR. BESTs

The permit itself, except ~-

QUESTIONs

By what date? what date does it have to

start doing -that?
MR. BESTs

Well, unfortunately this is one of the

issues that we wish to address in the adjudicatory hearing.
The dates are all passsdo

'

The dates by which —

QUESTION:

They are all what?

MR. BESTs

Passed.

QUESTIONS

Passed.

MR. BESTs

When EPA took its action on June 2 and

extended the permit, the dates in EPA4s permit ware already
missed, iiiey ware already in the past®

And that was one of our

complaints, how do wo know when this thing is going to be
implemented or how. when you are extending a permit ■»»
QUESTIONS
to allow?

How much laadfciine did the permit purport

How much time was there between the entry of the

order that told Los Angeles to get started and the time they
were supposed to get started?

MR, BEST;

Well --

QUESTION;

Just approximately*

MR* BEST;

The requirement to initiate the project

was supposedly triggered by what is called "concept approval®"
Again, I would point out EPA has never given concept approval*
What was given was a concept approval by the State Board*

That

is a non-ministerial action®
QUESTION;

Well, if EPA has not given concept

approval and if that is what triggers it, then I would suppose
there is no outstanding requirement that they start®
MR® BEST;

Wa pointed that out to the Court of Appeals

and it has been one of our arguments, the EPA says the State
Board gave —* the complaint against the City of Los Angeles
alleges iihat concept approval was given and refers to the State
Board action as starting concept approval®

Then I believe that

by the implementation of the dates that the — it was April 1,
1.980 wher the full project had to be implemented®
staged, it was implemented and staged*

It was

I believe April 1, I960

W<ts the final date for it to be fully implemented, given the
date of concept approval®
QUESTION;

If no appeal had bean, no petition had been

sought here and none granted, what would have happened in the
meantime?
MR» BEST;

If before the Supreme Court, no petition —

QUESTION;

No, no»

If there had been no effort to

45

bring the case here, what would have happened?
MR. BESTs

In the courts at all, Mr. Chief Justice,

or in this Court?
QUESTION:

Just here.

MR. BESTs

I believe in that case what would have

happened is that EPA would have started over again with a new
permit for Los Angeles and we would be operating under a new
permit.
QUESTION:

That would have been quite a while ago,

some months ago.
MR. BESTs

Some months ago.

I only have a fe'w seconds and if I may make one final
point, I would like to urge the Court to remember the public
participation requirements of the Act.

This is a major permit

— the city of Los Angeles’ permit — in a major urban area
that was issued for a 2--1/2-year period, with absolutely no
public participation? in fact with steps that deliberately
precluded public participation.

We need -the hearing to address

these issues about this very unsatisfactory project.
I thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Alsup, you have about

four minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM H. ALSUP, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. ALSUPs

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

46
please the Courts
i

I would like to try to address this question of
whether or not the case will become moot and whether anything
rides upon this proceeding in this Court0
A very lot -- a great deal rides upon whether or not
this permit is enforceable or not»

There is now pending in

the City of Los Angeles in the District Court for the Central
District of California an enforcement action brought by the
United States by the EPA to enforce this very compliance
schedules however,, the Ninth Circuit has stayed that enforcement
actiont pending the resolution of this case.
If this Court were tomorrow to rule in our favore
that stay would be lifted and our enforcement action against
the City of Los Angeles would proceed immediatelya

And what

we are trying to do in that case is to have the city comply
with the condition in the permit that required by April of 1980
for the city to discontinue putting sludge in the ocean0
QUESTIONS

Why did the Ninth Circuit tie its stay

of the UaSe enforcement action in the District Court to this
Court5 3 action in this case?
MR* ALSUPs
Circuit did thate

I don * t know the answer to why the Ninth

But the order does road "pending final

resolution of this litigatione65

And I suppose what motivated

•the Ninth Circuit was that they knew that the Government was
attempting to enforce the terms and conditions of the permit

47
that had been extended»

And since the Ninth Circuit had

declared that to be an illegal action, that 'the Ninth Circuit
thought that it was best not to allow the Government to continue
to enforce it®
QUESTION:

The Ninth Circuit felt that if it were

affirmed here, that the Government failed in its enforcement
proceedings in the District Court?
MR* ALSUPs

I suppose what the Ninth Circuit

contemplated was that if our petition were not granted or we
lost in this Court, that then the enforcement action would be
permanently enjoined»

I think that is what was in the mind

of the Ninth Circuit»
QUESTIONS

Then you would have to start over, as your

friend put it?
MR, ALSUPs

Well, that is correct? but you know that

is only one-half of the possible outcomes»

The other one-half

of the outcome is that tomorrow or reasonably soon — even
February or March — this Court were to affirm what EPA did
and then our enforcement action would proceed, the stay would
be lifted and we would than be able to have enforced the permit
that now exists and tins conditions in that permit, rather than
wait until the entire administrative process goes through it
again»
Now, this permit does not expire on the 17th»

That

is by operation of section 558(c) of title V which provides

48

that so long as there is a timely application for renewal the
permit or license in existence continues by operation of law
to remain in effect.
So. for examplee if — I should say that these are
complicated, it has been complicated by the 1977 amendments
which allow under section 301(h) an additional application to
be made by the city*

It is quite lengthy.

They have made that

application, a lot of other cities have made those 301(h)
applications,and not 3 one of them has been acted on yet be™
cause of the scientific review that is necessary.

It may be

many monilis before the Environmental Protection Agency is able
to act on the pending applications for renewal.
By virtue of 558(c), in the meantime — which could
be as mary as 11 or 12 months
expire.

the existing permit does not

moot,
QUESTION;

Mr, A!sup> when do they have to start

hauling

•
Assume you prevail and -the permit remains in effect

becau.se there is a pending application for extension,

Must

they commence promptly to haul the sludge overland?
MR, ALSUPs

Absolutely? in our view.

Mow, the city resists that view and that is part of
the litigation in Los Ange3.es,

But our position in that

enforcement action in Los Angeles is that concept approvalr

true, was given by the State, but -that nonetheless triggered
the compliance schedule that is at page .18 of the Appendix
and required„ many months ago, for the city to start phasing
out putting the sludge in the ocean and putting it somewhere
else.

And by April of 1980, it was originally contemplated

that that process would be complete®

Now it is way behind

schedule because the city has fought us on this*

But, none­

theless, it is our position that the compliance schedule in the
permit is already operative and they are in violation of that
compliance schedulec
QUESTIONs

Is it the Federal Government’s responsi­

bility to approve of where the sludge is taken, or is it merely
the Federal Government®s position that it can no longer go in
the ocean?
MRe ALSUP s

The latter is our basic position®

The

permit simply says whatever you do with it, you can’t put it
in the ocean,,

And, the city, you can come up with your own

s chema *
The city did come up with its own scheme and it is
called the Interim Sludge Project®

They decided to put it in

landfills ®
It gets a bit complicated, because then they came to
the Environmental Protection Agency and saids

"Would you help

us fund this project"?
And it was at that point that the EPA saids

"Yes,

50

we will consider funding your project,”

„

i

And so the EPA is in fact involved on the funding
side of approving the so-called Interim Sludge Project,
But had there never been any funding, the permit by
its own terms would have said whatever you do with it, you can­
not continue to put it in the ocean after April I960,
Thank you,
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

above-entitled matter was submitted,)
