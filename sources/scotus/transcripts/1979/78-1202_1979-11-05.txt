MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 78-1202, Chiarella v. United States.
Mr. Arkin, I think vou mav proceed whenever vou are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT 0^ STANLEY S. ARKIN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ARKIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and mav it please the

Court:
This matter is on certiorari to the Second Circuit.
It concerns the scope of section 10(b) of the 1934 Securities
Exchange Act and, more particularly, whether it is a violation,
a criminal violation of that statute for a purchaser of stock
who is not an "insider" and had no fiduciary relation to a
prospective sellar to purchase that stock without revealing
that he had obtained information from a source thoroughly out­
side the issuer corporation,- that is, not inside information
but outside information created by the outsida source,
Mr. Chiarella, the petitioner, was employed in 1975
and 1975 as a mark-up man in Pandick Press, which is a finan­
cial printing house in downtown New York, and while there he
cante upon and in possession of information from customers of
Pandick with respect to their intention to tender through
other corporations, and using that information which he ob­
tained from the customers in his capacity as a mark-up man, he

4
went into the open market and he purchased shares of stock in
the target corporations.

He didn’t tell anyone he was doing

that; h© just did it.
The issue in this case is whether he had any rela­
tionship with the seller of the shares, which would have man­
dated that he make a disclosure, or whether pure nondisclosure
where there is no fiduciary or other special relationship
amounts to a violation of 10(b).
QUESTION;

Well, you said no special relationship.

What if an author has written a book and he takes it to a
printer to have it printed, and at this stage there’s no
problem about copyright.

Do you think there is a special re­

lationship between the printer and the author to take no step
that would jeopardise his copyright standing?
MR. ARKIN:

I would agree that there is a relation­

ship between the author and the printer, who is an agent of
his principal, the printer, but there th@,remedy would not be
something which is analagous to section l^{b).

which I think would b© most appropriate here.

QUESTION;

It would be a

By this statute, but you said no special

My question was directed at only your statement

that there is no special relationship between the customer
and fch© printer.
MR. ARKIN;

No special relationship between the

seller of the stock in the open market and the printer.

There

5

is a relationship of sorts, special, between Mr. Chiarella
here, the printer, and the customers of Pandick.

But that is

not at issue, I say, here, though X will deal with that in a
moment, because the Solicitor General seems to suggest it may
have some point.
The statute prohibits the employment of anv deceptive
or manipulative device or contrivance in violation of particu­
lar rules which are promulgated by the SEC.

Simply put, there

has been no deception, no manipulation here within that
statute.

This is a case of no more than a breach, if vou will,

of some kind of state fiduciary duty which Mr. Chiarella may
have owed the customers of Pandick.
If you look at the history of this particular liti­
gation, you will see a remarkable effort on the part of the
District Court and then the Circuit Court and notv the Solici­
tor General to formulate an entirely new theory of relation­
ship in order to impose 10(b) liability\on Mr, Chiarella.

In

the District Co&rt you had a simple, straightforward classic
insider analysis used.
QUESTION;
sider” com© from?

Incidentally, where does the concept "in­
Is there a specific rule under 10(b) deal­

ing with insiders?
MR. ARKIH;

No, the only rule that Congress has ever

enacted, Justice Rehnguist, which deals with insiders, insofar
as trading, is Rule 16(b), which mandates that an insider,

6

which is defined in the statute as an officer or director or
majority — not majority, but control shareholder — of a cor­
poration is proscribed from trading, purchasing or selling, or
selling or purchasing •—
QUESTION?

Was your client charged with a violation

of the rule under 16?
MR. ARKXN:

No, he was not.

He was charged with a

violation of Section 10(b).
QUESTION?

Well then, it really doesn’t make much

difference whether he's an insider or not, does it?
MR. ARKXN?
QUESTION;
MR. ARKXN:
QUESTION:
MR. ARKIN:

Well, as I think —The case law.
Th© case law also —
From the Second Circuit.
From the Second Circuit, yes.

I would

say that in this particular case, assuming that Texas Gulf
Sulphur and its progeny, or Cady, Roberts and its progeny are
correct, that it would make all the difference in the world,
because my client did not have any statutory or common law
fiduciary duty to any of the shareholders in the corporation
tha stock of which he purchased.

So it does make a difference

for -that reason.
QUESTION:

And Texas Gulf Sulphur is a SecoM Circuit

case?
MR. ARKIN:

Yes, Your Honor, it is indeed a Second

Circuit case.

It was the landmark case as of that time whan

alone.

In the Second Circuit?
In the Second Circuit, in that circuit

But if you look at what took place in the trial court,

the imposition of the classic insider duty and it was sorely
inappropriate and it was imposed on the theory that h@ had no
legitimate business purpose in his trad®, that is, Chiareiia
didn't, whereas the tender offer corporations whom he sought
to identify himself with had some legitimate economic purpose.
Interestingly, this theory was rejected at the circuit level
and an entirely nsv; effort to push this conduct into 10 (b) was
formulated which has been referred to as the market insider
rule, that is, the Second Circuit rule that since ,JIr.
Chiareiia was employed in a printing house which had access to
financial information on a regular basis, that that regular
receipt of information somehow put him into a particular
!

category of status requiring him to disclose or abstain, as
the case may be, and of course somebody in that position would
really, if the Court of Appeals were correct, have a duty to
abstain, and disclosure would not be something which would
be relevant or work at all.
That particular test formulated by th@ Second Circuit
was entirely new, expansive, novel approach to sec-cion 10(b),
was reject®! in a footnote by th© Solicitor General on the

8

ground that it was insufficiently discreet, that is, that rule
would encompass the activities of market professionals and
others who perform a worthy market function and that accord­
ingly that rule wouldn’t obtain, and an entirely new rule or
rules, again an effort to push this conduct into a particular
box,was formulated.
The theory which the Solicitor General now advances
in its effort to demonstrate some relationship Chiarella had
is that by somehow reaching a duty, committing some kind of
tort, vis-a-vis the tender offeror, the customer of Pandick,
that that, as if it' were a contageous disease, was carried
over into the transaction between Mr. Chiarella and the pur­
chaser on the open market; and then, secondly, on the other
hand that somehow Mr. Chiarella by virtue of having this
superior information which ha obtained in a — and 1 asm
quoting fch© Solicitor General — "a torteous manner," that
that itself created a direct duty by Mr. Chiarella to the
purchaser.

\
Neither one of those theories wash.

them should stand up to analysis.

Neither one of

They simply totally obviate

prior law under section 10{b) and th® common law.
With respect to whether or not there is any relevance
as to whether Mr. Chiarella did anything to the tender offeror,
the customer, of course that wasn’t charged in this case.

The

case was not indicted that way, it wasn’t tried on that theory,

9
it wasn't charged to the jury on that theory, so that is an
entirely novel and new approach.

But aside from the fact that

it is not in the case except at the appellate level, really,
there would have been no duty of Chiarella here because it is
a tender — not the tender offeror, it is the customer, the
seller of the stock which 10(b) is directed at, aimed at, and
there was no relationship of Chiarella to that person.

And so

what happened vis-a-vis the tender offeror we say is not
relevant at all.

Moreover, there was really no fraud there.

At most, I think you could say there was an unauthorized use
of information and I would suggest that not all fiducial
breaches, not all unauthorized conduct —■
QUESTION;

Well, his conduct certainly wasn't very

appealing to a person of ordinary moral standards.

That

doesn't necessarily mean it is criminalo
MR. ARKIN:

Well, not very appealing but that is

most respectfully, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, hardly a standard
to bring within a statute enacted by Congress.

No, it was

not but it was a kind of conduct which should appropriately
be dealt with by the state with a vast body of state lawc

He

could have been sued in conversion, he could have been fired,
as it was, sued for breach of contract, or possibly sued under
a theory of unlawful acquisition of a corporate opportunity,,
But it certainly wasn't within 10(b) and, of course, not all
unappealing conduct or undesirable conduct is within the

10

common law or statutory meanings of fraud or manipulation.
QUESTION:

In your opinion, was it criminal under

MR. ARKIN:

Mr. Justice Rlackmun, under New York

state law?

state law I don't believe it was, but there are statutes in
other states in this country which would seem to proscribe
what is called industrial espionage, that is taking a secret
of an employer and using it for your own benefit, and so
possibly in some states it might be deemed criminal, but not
in New York to my knowledge.
QUESTION:

You feel fairly certain about that in New

York?
MR. ARKIN:

I don't know, but I believe so.

We

have checked the statutes on that and could find no statute
which would make his conduct criminal.

I suppose that one

might attempt to fashion some kind of unlawful taking from
what Mr. Chiarella did, but our analysis of the statutes is
such that that couldn't be done, but to be fair we thought
about that.
Insofar as Mr. Chiarella's relationship to the seller
himself, of course there was no privity between the two of
them.

Mr. Chiarella classically made no misrepresentation.

He didn't say a half truth.

Pie had no duty to that seller.

had no reason, if you will, to have made a disclosure.

Mow, the Solicitor General does cite an ancient perhaps not so ancient, but 1870 English case, the Omphrey
case, which is a sport among the vast body of common lav/ and a
needle In a haystack type case, but a proposition that somehow
the superior information was tortiously acquired, it is unfair
for a seller to deal with the buyer without making that dis­
closure.
Aside fom its sporting nature, the Omphrey ease is
hardly applicable here in that the tort was afflicted upon the
seller in that case, which dealt with a sale of land and the
fact that there was coal under the land, unknown to the seller,
and there was a trespass committed onto the land affecting the
seller by the buyer, not at all apposite.
The background of section 10(b) and its administra­
tive and judicial history —
QUESTION:

Mr. Arkin, why Isn’t the case apposite?
/

You just said it wasn’t, but I didn’t quite understand your
reasoning why the ease wasn’t apposite.

Why isn't that ease

like this?
MR. ARKIN:

Well, because there there was conduct

which was directed at the seller, Mr. Justice Stevens.

There

the buyerdiad gone onto the land and he had •—
QUESTION:

You mean the trespass Itself was a tort

against the seller?
MR. ARKIN:

The trespass itself, and I suspect what

12
would happen there in the English court is that in those days
when trespass meant somewhat more than it may today, it felt
that that was something which was a fundamental wrong to the
buyer and so they imported or created for that particular case
that kind of duty.

To our knowledge, the case, aside from

perhaps a Law Review article or two, has not been used since.
I thought it was fair to bring it upB

It was in the

Solicitor General’s brief.
But if you look at the history of this statute, how
it originated and administratively and judicially how it has
been administered by the SEC, I think you find little or no
basis — I shouldnrt say little or no, it is giving away too
much — you find no basis at all for suggestint that the con­
duct at issue here is within the statute»

To the contrary, I

would say that what we have to show, it shows it is very far
outside the ambit of the statute.
QUESTION:

Suppose a judge trying a case in the

trial court knows that economic consequences are going to have
a great impact on the market.

Assume

(a) he has some stock

in the company and the impact is going to be to push the
market down, so he sells and then alternatively assume it is
going to go up as a result of his holding and he goes out to
the bank and borrows some money and buys a lot of the stock,
just the way this fellow did here,

would say he had some kind of an obligation overall to the

Now, let me suggest to you that there is still in my

mind some difficulty in applying section 10(b).

I don’t know

whether the kind of duty which the judge has which may flow
from common law notions of what a judge should do and
shouldn’t do, and up to the present time when

we have specific

rules regulating judicial conduct while on the bench in terms
of what kind of stock you can own and not own and how you sell
and buy, I don't know whether that would fit within section
10(b).

I —

Well, from the broker to Chiarella, that

Those were

;j the means.
Legislatively this statute, section 10(b), was
originally Introduced as part of 9(e) of the ’3*f act, and the
idea there was — If you look at the statute as originally
constituted before it was lifted out of 9(c) and passed in and
of itself by Congress, was to stop manipulation, that is
something which artificially affected the price of stocks.
It had nothing to do with the kind of fact pattern of a
situation we have here because certainly whatever Mr.
Chiarella did did not artificially affect the price of stock
on the market.

QUESTION:

Well, hypothetically if he had been able

to borrow enough money and borrowed a million dollars and
bought a million dollars worth of stock, it might have an
affect on the market, wouldn't it?
MR. ARKIN:

Not artificially, Your Honor. At most

it would have shoved the price of stock in the right direction

because the real value of the stock -- and that is the point
of the case — was the price at which a tender offeror was

occurred here.

Nothing like that

If anything, it moved in the right direction.

Administratively, too, this particular section has
always been considered, almost always been considered by the
SEC to deal with, in the category of inside information,
special information, if somebody who had a fiduciary relation­

of stock, who was not an insider or had no fiduciary relation

contract and just decided to publish, he is printing but he
decides he is just going to — it would be a hot Item to an­
nounce to the press, so he just announces It„

He probably

might be liable in damages to the offeror, but he probably
wouldn’t have violated 10(b), would he?
MR. ARKIN:

I think that Is exactly right and I

think a very fine hypothetical to test is what we are presenting to this Court here, and the point Is that had Vincent
Chiarella, for example, say, gone to the target company and

I
j

I

said let me sell you some Information you would like to have,
x-fhy, that would not have the violation clearly of section 10(eK
it would have been some kind of contractual or perhaps conver5f

sion breach.
QUESTION:

The reason, of course, I suppose was it

had not been in connection with the purchase or sale of a
security, that would be — but the thing that puzzles me a
little bit, we seem to be coming to the conclusion that your
client may have defrauded the customer of the printer, the
tender offeror but not the person that he bought the stock
from,,

But even if that conclusion is correct, why isn’t it

still true that he committed a fraud in connection with the

25
purchase or sale of a security?
MR. ARKIN:
QUESTION:

Because —
Even though the defrauded party is a dif-

■

ferent party than the person from x?hom he bought the security.
'

MR. ARKIN:

Well, that is one of the themes of the

.;

Solicitor General and I suggest to you that in connection which
means a fraud directed at the transaction, something which
intended to visit injury upon the seller or purchaser of
i shares.

ifr

That didn't take place here.
QUESTION:

Do you think all — it may be that blue

.3.
■3

ship and all the rest, but in essence does it hold that the
wrongdoer must defraud the other party to a transaction?
There are a lot of 10(b) cases that don’t fit -that mold, aren't
there?

Maybe I'm wrong.
MR. ARKIN:

I just -—

There are 10(b) cases which may, depend­

ing on the standing issue, come up with somewhat different
1 way, but basically all of the cases involved have to do with
imposing a sanction upon somebody who is directing his fraud,
: his misconduct toward the purchase or buyer of shares.
QUESTION:

What about (c), subparagraph (c), which

reads 5,to engage in any act, practice which operates or would
operate as a fraud or deceit upon any parson."

It doesn’t

limit it to any particular person, but in connection with the
purchase or sale of any security.

Now, he has engaged in the

purchase or sale of a security, hasn't he?

26

MR. ARKIN:

Yes, but his conduct was not directed at

the seller in this particular ease.
QUESTION:

Is there anything in that langauge that

says it must be directed at the seller?
MR. ARKIN:
Chips

Well, this Court, if you will, in Blue

seemed to suggest that very strongly, adopting the

Burnbaum rule out of the Second Circuit.
Moreover, I should say to Your Honor — I know my
time is up — that this was not the theory on which this case
was tried, it wasn't indicted that way, and that if for some
reason this Court were to find that any conducted directed to
the tender offeror fitted into a category of 10(b) violation,
that would run

afoul, I would suggest, of Lewis and Bouie

and those cases which called for fair notice.
QUESTION:

But isn’t that argument you just made

applicable to the arguments that the Solicitor General has
, made that are different from those made below?

liV

MR. ARKIN:

/ .

Yes, I think that the fact that differ­

ent arguments have been made

and rejected by the government

at various levels certainly does go to that point, yes.
fact is there was a deprivation of due process here.

ORAL ARGUMENT OP STEPHEN M. SHAPIRO, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. SHAPIRO:

15

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

i]

Section 10(b) and rule 10(b)(5) forbid the use of

i0 j

deceptive devices in connection with the purchase of securitiesl
The central question presented in-this case is whether peti/

tioner used such a deceptive device.
We contend that his use of converted non-public
:

market information to enrich himself in the stock market with­
out disclosure to anyone was a deceptive device x^ithin the
prohibition of the statute and the rule.

In establishing

I
this proposition, we look first to the duties which petitioner I
owed to the tender offerors whose Information he converted.

28
We then consider the duties which petitioner owed to
public investors*

We begin with the fact which was admitted
j

ff on the witness stand that the petitioner misappropriated
confidential information belonging to the tender offerors and
used that information to purchase securities at a large per­
sonal profit.

Because he xfas —

QUESTION:

•

Mr. Solicitor Generalv mayx^Just throw

one question at you that you could handle before you get ~
suppose that —- one can argue that it was the seller who was
.

i

defrauded or one can argue that it was the tender offeror who
was defraudeds either way.

Assume you had an action in which

the defendant came in and said I know I cheated somebody, I
will pay the money into the court and you two fight it out as
to who is entitled to this money.

Who would get it,

that is,

as between the tender offeror and the people who sold to him?
MR, SHAPIRO:

The SEC's dissent decrees Tn this

area have made the restitution first to jthe public investors
and if they canft be identified then to the tender offerors
whose information has been converted.

The priority has been

given to the investors.
QUESTION:

But assuming there has got to be a choice,

you say the Investor would get It even though the tender
offerors could have made

precisely the same transaction with

the investor?
MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, the tender offeror Is —
%

3

I

29
QUESTION:

He could have separately — say he doesn’t

have up to 5 percent, he could have gone to the sellers and
said I will buy this amount of stock at this very same price
that this person does.
MR. SHAPIRO:

That case is not only a distinguish­

able one, it is antithetical in our view.

The tender offeror

makes an investment decision on the basis of publicly avail­
able information.

He doesn't steal.

He doesn’t convert or

he doesn't embezzle.
QUESTION:

The information he is about to make a

tender offer isn’t publicly available.
MR. SHAPIRO:

That Is internally generated Informa­

tion, gotten through bona fide business activity»

It is not

stolen information.
QUESTION:

It is the epitbmy of inside information.

MR. SHAPIRO:

But inside information In the cases

that have come up thus far can’t be misused in situations
where it has been misappropriated, where there is conversion
or theft or misappropriation.

This Is the triggering cireum-

stance that gives rise to the duty of disclosure, and that is
how we distinguish that ease from the present case.
r

QUESTION:

Well, inside information has to be fitted

in with some portion of rule 10(b)(5), doesn’ it, which
doesn't say anything about inside Information?
MR. SHAPIRO:

That’s correct.

We rely on subjsection

i

30
(a) and subsection (c) which deal with devices, schemes or
artifists to defraud or practices which operate as fraudsThis Court held in the Affiliated Ute case that total silence
when there is a duty to disclose can be a device to defraud.
It held the same thing in the Capital Gains case.» and that was
the rule of common law when there was a duty to speak, total
silence was a device to defraud.
QUESTION:

Well, the issue here I suppose ultimately

is was there a duty to disclose.
MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

There was a duty to disclose here —

That is the issue, isn't it?

MR. SHAPIRO:

It is indeed •— to the tender offerors

and to the public investors.

I would like to begin with the

tender offerors and explain why there was a duty to disclose
to them.
QUESTION:
the tender offeror?

Wasn’t there also a duty to disclose to
Didn't Chiarella owe a duty to his

principal?
MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

Precisely.

Precisely.

Yes.

MR. SHAPIRO:

It was a double failure to disclose in

connection with a securities transaction.

An agent or other

fiduciary who plans to make personal use of confidential in­
formation that is entrusted to him has an unqualified duty to
make prior disclosure to his principal before using that

I

31

information*

At common law, failure to make disclosure to the

principal was a form of deceit.
.i

To be sure, it was a breach

of fiduciary duty, but was something more because there was a
failure to disclose and a duty to disclose.

Secret misappro-

priation is different from unfairness or negligence in the
discharge of a fiduciary duty.
Under black letter legal principles, it is a garden
variety type of fraud or deception.

Petitioner schemed to

enrich himself by using this confidential information, was
carried on through stock transactions.

In this case, as in

the Bankers Life case, a stock transaction was the vehicle
for a fraudulent misappropriation.

In Bankers Life, the de­

fendant engaged in securities transaction and afterv/ards
converted the proceeds of the sale.

Because that conversion

was in connection with the securities transaction, this Court
held that it violated section 10(b) and rule 10(b)(5)®
Section 10(b), we would point out, is not limited
frauds that injure investors.

As this Court held last term in

the Naftalin case, in construing tie parallel anti-fraud rule
in the *33 Act, the anti-fraud provisions that are phrased in
general terms reach frauds practiced on any person.
QUESTION:

No?/ to whom was this duty to disclose

owed as you are now positing it?

To the person he bought the

stock from?
i

MR. SHAPIRO:

to

The first duty that we deal with is

1
32

the duty owed to the tender offerors.

There was a duty to

Stf Ii

disclose to them prior to his misappropriation of their con­

S"'-}

fidential information.

i

QUESTION:

MR. SHAPIRO:

c> i

SO I

Disclose what?
Disclose that he was about to deal on

his own behalf or in his own interest with their confidential
property.
QUESTION:

That he was about to misappropriate this

information?
MR. SHAPIRO:
ito

That he was about to misappropriate

That is a black letter rule of agency and it is a black

letter rule of the common law fraud» and we rely on that In
connection with the tender offerors.
QUESTION:

Not that he was about to purchase shares

on the New York Stock Exchange?
MR. SHAPIRO:

He had to disclose that he was about

to use their information to purchase shares on the New York
Stock Exchange.
QUESTION:

That is all.

MR. SHAPIRO:

That Is the omission and it is con­

ceded that he made no such disclosure to these tender offerors
before converting their information —
QUESTION:

He made no disclosure of any kind, did he?

MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

No disclosure of any kind.

Just so I may be clear, your submission is

33
he should have disclosed what?
MR. SHAPIRO:

He should have disclosed to the tender

offerors that we are dealing with first that he was about to
misappropriate confidential information entrusted to them to
purchase stock on the New York Stock Exchange.
QUESTION:

And that — there were two separate di­

closures then — and that he was going to use this confiden­
tial Information —
MR, SHAPIRO:

Both things had to be disclosed as a

matter of agency law and as a matter of common law fraud»
QUESTION:

So then your basic submission Is that the

criminal provisions of the SEC make any violation of an agency
principal relationship into a crime?
MR. SHAPIRO:

Not at all.

Only when there is a

failure to disclose or misrepresentation in connection with a
breach of fiduciary duty is there a 10(b)(5) violation.

That

is the holding in the Green case and we think that is a correct
analysis.

In this case, there was a failure to disclose where

there was a duty to disclosea and under the Green case that
can be a violation of section 10(b),

That is the analysis we
f

rely on here.
It doesn’t matter that the victims of this scheme,
when we look at the tender offerors, weren’t purchasers or
investors.

The Blue Chips Stamp rule is a rule of standing

in private damage action.

It isn’t applicable in a government

3*}

enforcement proceeding.

In a government proceeding, all that

the government needs to show is that a deceptive device was
used in connection with the purchase of securities.
identity of the victim Is.simply irrelevant.

The

That was the

holding in Naftalin and it is equally applicable here,
QUESTION:

You think that criminal statutes should

be more broadly construed than civil statutes?
MR. SHAPIRO:

The statute should be given its liter­

al interpretation, that is all we are contending for, that it
reaches any fraudulent device used in connection with a
securities transaction, not limited to particular kinds, not
limited to transactions that injure particular categories of
victims.

It covers any fraudulent scheme.
QUESTION:

How about the officer of the tender

offeror who uses his Inside information to go out and trade on
his own account, just like this printer did?
MR, SHAPIRO:

He violates section 10(b).

The case

of SEC v. Shapiro, from the Second Circuit, held that persons
who misappropriate information from the acquiring company and
use that information to buy the target stock violate the rule.
QUESTION:

Do you think In that case the seller of

the stock from whom he buys could recover damages from him
under 10(b)?
MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, the question of who can recover

in a private action is an unsettled area.

There Is divergence

35
among the courts on that.
QUESTION:

I am not asking you how much.

I would

just like to ask you whether a legal duty to the seller of the
stock has been breached.
MR. SHAPIRO:
to that seller.

There ha3 been a breach of legal duty

If that seller can be identified —

QUESTION;

Under 10(b)?

MR. SHAPIRO:

Yes, that is correct.

That was the

holding —

MR. SHAPIRO:

There is a duty to disclose -—

Where do you get that out of 10(b)?

there is a duty to disclose.

What if it is just confidential?

MR. SHAPIRO:

information generated through bona fide business activity, with

buying shares.

Well, telling the truth is not a

violation of section 10(b) because it is not deceptive, it is
not fraud —

That is not enough?
MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

No,

If he —

Even though he breached his contract and

breached his fiduciary duty to his principal —*
MR, SHAPIRO:

That’s correct.

You need deception or

non-disclosure to come within the scope of section 10(b).’ That
is why Your Honor’s hypothetical is not a 10(b) violation, al­
though it is a vrrong to the tender offerors.
QUESTION:

Does he Wed to profit by it himself?

MR. SHAPIRO:
is irrelevant.

No, he doesn't.

The element of profit

If he uses a deceptive deviee in connection

with a stock transaction and he does so willfully and the
mails are used, the government's case is complete.

Personal

profit is not an element of the crime,
QUESTION:

Mr. Shapiro, may I ask this question:

Do

you read the opinion of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals as
requiring some special relationship, fiduciary relationship?

37
It seems to me it says — and here I quote from it — "a test
of regular access to market information appears to us to pro.

vide a workable rule."
MR. SHAPIRO:

The court does appear to adopt a rule

of regular access to non-public information.
\

QUESTION:

But you don't go that far?

MR. SHAPIRO:

We don't go that far, for the reasons

that are discussed in the amicus curiae brief of the Securities
i

industry Association.

Many legitimate businesses obtain non-

public market information in the course of their business
activities.

The specialist on the New York Stock Exchange

floor does this, and because there is no element of misappro­
priation or conversion, the cases have not interpreted this
kind of activity as a violation of the statute.
QUESTION:

What about the Investment analyst that

pays a visit to a corporation and obtains more current esti­
mates of earnings for the year than are available generally,
then that analyst advises his clients to buy, has he violated
|
10(b)(5)?

MR. SHAPIRO:

Yes, the theory that has been applied
'

in these cases is that the leading of the confidential in­
formation to this individual is a misappropriation or a misuse
• |

i

of confidential corporate information that shouldn't be available for the personal use of anyone and that is a wrong to the :
company.

And if he thereafter uses it for personal profit.

i
38
that is a violation of section 10(b)0
QUESTION:

You are saying that if a corporate execu­

tive gives any information to an analyst who visits him that
isn’t public, and it may arguably affect the Influence of the
stock and that information subsequently is used, that both the
executive — I guess he is a tipper and the investment
adviser is a tipee, Is that the -MR. SHAPIRO:

That is essentially correct, if the

information Is material, confidential Information that hasn’t
been disclosed to the rest of the analysts and the rest of the

;

investors in the market —
QUESTION:

Well, where do you get that out of either

i

the statute or the rule?
MR. SHAPIRO:

That has been the consistent interpre­

tation of the SEC since the Katy Roberts case and every court
that has considered it, every court of appeals —
QUESTION:

We are talking about the Second Circuit

now.

i

MR. SHAPIRO:

This Court approved that rule in the

case of Foremost v. McKesson.

It said that misuse of inside

information by Insiders is a violation of section 10(b).

It

said that in the course of its analysis of section 16(b) of
the act, but this Court has approved that analysis.
QUESTION:

It sounds like misuse, misappropriation

— they seem to me to be quite loosely used by the government
I

39
here»
MR. SHAPIRO:

It is a violation of legal duty* that

is what we mean by misuse.

If this information is taken for

!

the personal benefit of an employee of the company and used
in the stock market, that is a wrong against the company, of

i

course»
QUESTION:
legal duty or not?

How do you decide whether there is a
Is this a state law or a federal law?

MR. SHAPIRO:

It is ultimately a question of federal ;

law of whether there is a violation, but you look to state law

I
n

to determine if there is a duty to make this — to keep this
information confidential.
QUESTION:

I

Are you saying, in response to Mr.

Justice Powell's question, therefore that whether there was a

!

duty on the part of the corporate president not to disclose to
the analyst would depend on the law of the fifty states?
'

i
MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, the law in the fifty states is

consistent on this point.

An agent that has confidential

I
information of its principal. In your hypothetical the company,
can’t misuse that and can’t leak it to other persons.

That is

a violation of his duty under black letter agency rules.

It

isn’t a matter of various rules under different state juris­
dictions.

It is a settled principle of agency lax?.
QUESTION:

But the difficulty is that as a practical

matter corporate executives wouldnst knoxf whether information

40
was material or not in a sense that a jury might perhaps decide.
You talk about your company.

You talk about it all the time.

The country is full of analysts and investment advisers who
i

/

try to understand what is going on in corporations.
MR. SHAPIRO:

The courts have wrestled with this

difficulty9 and one of the safeguards against Improper prose­
cution or improper civil damage judgments is the sclenta re»
i

quirement.

This has to be done with an element of mens rea

or scienta.

It eanst be done innocently or even negligently.

QUESTION:

I think the point made in this case by

your colleague is that there is no proof of intent in this
case to defraud.
■

MR. SHAPIRO:

The District Court charged the jury

that it couldn?t convict unless it found engagement in a de­
vice to defraud knowingly, intentionally and willfully with
realization that it was wrongful, with an understanding that
this was wrongful conduct.
QUESTION:

What was the device in this case?

MR® SHAPIRO:

It was failure to disclose to the

tender offerors (a), and (b) failure to disclose to public
investors that stolen information was being used in transac­
tions with them.
QUESTION:
a

\

I u'lderatandp of course, that there was

failure to disclose.

The question in my mind is whether

the man on the street would construe that as a device or

j

hi
scheme or an artifice.

They are the statutory words and we

have a criminal case which is what concerns me.
MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

I have no doubt that the man —

I don’t defend xfhat this fellow did* but

I
\

MR. SHAPIRO:

I have no doubt that the man on the

street would say that someone that steals information that is
non-public and uses that to exploit a seller in the stock
market is guilty of a cunning devices but this is not a new
cunning device.
QUESTION:

Haven’fc you got new independent grounds

for this?
MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

We do.

Even if he didn’t have legal duty to the

seller —
MR. SHAPIRO:

He had a duty to those tender offerors

and that is a ground —
QUESTION:

And even if he breached no duty to the

sellers, he did breach a duty to the offerors in connection
with his purchase of the securities.
MR. §HAPIRO:
QUESTION:

That’s quite correct.

And that is as far as you need to go?

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, we agree that the Court could

affirm on that narrow grounds that is correct, but we also
think that

j

QUESTION:

Don’t they usually try to affirm on the

narrowest ground possible?
MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, that is a possibility but we

think that both of these theories are integrally related and
that they both have a clear basis in prior law and we would —
QUESTION:

I knoitf, but if you include the latter and

say — if you say you had to have a breach of duty to the
seller, you have some -— it seems to me you have some problem
about permitting the corporation itself to purchase shares
without disclosure of the facts.

I know you don’t think so,

but it seems to me that certainly before the Williams Act it
had been held that the offeror could go out and purchase
shares without disclosing.
MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

That’s quite true.

Information —

And there was no breach of duty.

MR. SHAPIRO:

That is because there was no embezzle-

menu or conversion in obtaining that information.
QUESTION:

That is just restating your conclusion»

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, the information is generated

within the corporation through honest methods.

There is no

way to characterize that as dishonest.
QUESTION:

I know, but there is no — I am talking

about the duty to the seller.

There is no disclosure whatso­

ever, although the corporation knows it is going to make a
tender offer.

MR. SHAPIRO:

That’s correct, and at common law

there wasn’t a duty to disclose when information was gotten
honestly and that is the principle we rely on here, and that
has been the principle that the SEC and the courts have used
under section 10(b).

As early as 19^3, the SEC concluded

that misappropriated non-public market information couldn’t
be used in the stock market to take advantage of uninformed
investors»
10(b).

That is one of the earliest cases under section

The Second Circuit in the Shapiro case held that you

couldn’t convert information from the acquiring company and
use that information to buy the shares from the target
company shareholders.
QUESTION:

This principle —

QUESTION:

I was under the impression that a

dissenting judge on the Court of Appeals said that there never

had been a criminal prosecution under 10(b)(5).

Did he say

that?
MR. SHAPIRO:

What he had in mind is that there has

never been a criminal prosecution for misuse of inside informa­
tion.

He didn’t mean to suggest that there has never been a

criminal prosecution for various other kinds of misconduct in
connection with a stock transaction because there have been
dozens of those.
QUESTION:

/
But never a criminal case like this?

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, there is one case that has some

similarity to this that we have cited.

It is the Hancock case,

where non-public information about an acquisition of a mutual
fund was misappropriated by an employee and that information
\

was used to purchase up the stock and this was the subject of
an Indictment and a guilty plea in New York, that is the only
case that fits this exact factual pattern that came up in a

45
criminal context.

QUESTION:

'

Yes, Your Honor.

One can agree readily with you that it

was a breach of some sort of a fiduciary duty for him not to
disclose to the customer corporation that he had acquired
this Information as an employee of the printers but how freely
translatable is a breach of a fiduciary duty into\ something
that is fraud or deception or misrepresentation?
MR. SHAPIRO:

this Court's Green decision because it has to be non­

QUESTION:

But fraud means misrepresentation upon

which there Is reliance to the detriment of the person to
whom the misrepresentation has been made.
MR. SHAPIRO:

The definition is suppression of the

truth to take advantage of another person.

That is the defin­

ition that was used in the charge to the jury, and here the
suppression of truth was in failing to disclose to the tender
offerors that this self-dealing was occurring, where there was
a duty under established black letter principles to make that
disclosure.
QUESTION:

Fiduciary duty, a fiduciary duty.

MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

A fiduciary duty.

And how is breach of a fiduciary duty 30

freely translatable into a misrepresentation or deception or
fraud?
MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, as the Court in the Green case

pointed out, if there is a duty to disclose and a failure to
disclose, that is a fraud.

It is a form of misrepresentation.

That is what this Court held in the Affiliated Ute case.
QUESTION:

That could follow as between strangers,

but it might not carry over where you are talking about a

47
breach of a fiduciary duty, which is a stricter 3tandard0
MR* SHAPIRO:

Well, if the fiduciary duty requires

disclosure and there Is non-disclosure and It is In connection
with a securities transaction, that is 10(b)(5) fraud.
QUESTION:

But I don’t see that follows necessarily.

It could follow but it need not necessarily follow.
MR. SHAPIRO:

That is what this Court held in the

Capital Gains case and it held that In Affiliated Ute, when
there is a fiduciary duty to make disclosure and there was a
failure, a complete silence on the part of the defendant, that
was a deceptive device.
QUESTION:

Now, Mr. Shapiro, what if the fiduciary

duty had been obeyed here and there had been a disclosure?
MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

To the tender offerors.

To the tender offerors.,

The sellers on

the stock market wouldn’t have known anything about that,
would they?
MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, in that case you would have to

address the question of whether failure to disclose is on the
sellers.
QUESTION:

Presumably it wouldntt thereby be public

knowledge, would it?
MR. SHAPIRO:

That’s correct.

It could well be a

fraud on the sellers of the securities, even though it wasn’t
a fraud on the tender offerors.

QUESTION:

Why would It have been a fraud?

Where

would it have been their loss?
MR. SHAPIRO:

Well9 In a government enforcement pro­

ceeding it isn't necessary to show that there is a. private
loss , but the -—
QUESTION:

Well, that is the definition of fraud

though, common law definition, It has to be detriment, doesn't
it?
MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, this Court held in Capital Gains

that there doesn’t have to be proof of private loss In the
government enforcement proceeding, and the lower courts have
all held that under section 10(b)*
under section 10(b).

That is not an element

The crime is complete when there is

proof of a deceptive device in connection with a stock trans­
action, use of the mails and mens rea.

That is the entire

ease.
QUESTION:

But somebody else has got to be involved.

People don’t write letters and Just drop them in the dead
letter box.
MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, there have been prosecutions in

cases very similar to that where a false prospective may be
misdelivered and that it causes no harm to anyone, but the
convictions are sustained uniformally because there has beerdeceptive conduct in connection with a stock transaction.

That is not an element

of the offense*
QUESTION:
tions to the jury.

Mr. Shapiro, I have not read the instruc­
To what extent in those instructions was

there emphasis placed on the tender offeror as the party to
whom the duty of disclosure was owed?

I thought the case was

tried on the other theory*
MR. SHAPIRO:

It was tried throughout on two theories

In the indictment it was charged that the petitioner's scheme
•was a fraud on the sellers and then, secondly and independently
it was a device, scheme or artifice to defraud without limita­
tion on the victims*
QUESTION:

And in the court's pretrial decision -—
Without limitation.

Do they specifically

say that the tender offeror was defrauded?
MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, the defendant moved for dis­

missal of the indictment and the District Court held that both
kinds of fraud were encompassed,by this language in the indict\\

/

ment and that it could be a fraud both on the tender offerors
and a fraud on the sellers, and that is how the case was
argued to the jury.

It was argued as a fraud on the tender

offerors and on the sellers.

Both theories were presented

and there was no question of surprise to the defendant because
the District Court held as its first ground for sustaining
the indictment that this conduct was a fraud on the tender
offerors.

Both of these elements have been in the ease

50
throughout the litigation.
QUESTION:

The Second Circuit certainly didn’t rely

on that theory at all.
MR. SHAPIRO:

The Second Circuit relied principally

on fraud on the sellers, although it affirmed on this alternative ground as well.

It didn’t give the same play to it that

the District Court had.
QUESTION:

Could the jury have decided it on either

ground or was the jury required to find that there was fraud
on both the offerors —
MR. SHAPIRO:

The jury could find on either ground.,

that’s correct, that is how the case was argued.
I would emphasize to the Court that as early as 19^3*
the SEC had held that it is a violation of section 10(b) to
r; convert confidential marketing information and use that inI

|i

formation to exploit uninformed investors.

That is the

QUESTION:

Mr. Shapiro, let me ask you just one more.

Would you concede that under Blue Chip the tender offeror
could not have recovered damages from the defendant?
MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, I wouldn't concede that because

51
the tender offerors did purchase securities, and if in fact
they could prove injury in connection with those securities in
their capacity as purchasers, they would have standing to sue
under Blue Chip —
QUESTION:

Say they had engaged in no purchase

transactions just because there was a breach of duty to them,
they could not recover damages just out of these five trans­
actions .
MR. SHAPIRO:

That’s correct, if they were not pur­

chasers, defrauded as purchasers they %\rouldn’t have standing
to sue under Blue Chip.
This Court’s decision in the Affiliated Ute case in
1972 held that use of undisclosed market information to ex­
ploit uninformed investors can violate the statute.

That

wasn’t a case involving insiders, that was a case involving
outsiders with market information.

And the Second Circuit in

the Shapiro case that I have referred to held that the same
principle applies to an acquiring company officer or consult­
ant who misappropriates confidential information and uses that
information to take advantage of the sellers in the stock
market.
QUESTION:
back a minute.

Mr. Shapiro, I am going to have to go

I gather that before there is a breach of duty

here to the sellers, there has to be a misappropriation of
information?

52
MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

Thatfs correct.

So you do have to find both elements?

You

.

have to find some wrong to the tender offeror —
MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

That's correct.

So there really aren't two independent

grounds.
MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

There is —

You wouldn't say a fellow who is eaves­

dropping at lunch one day and heard some Inside information

!

and he wasn't connected with anybodys he just heard it and he
went out and purchased on the market and made the same profit
as this man did, he would not have violated 10(b).
MR. SHAPIRO:

Without some element of misappropria­

tion of wrongfulness in receiving the information, that tippee
isn't liable.

He has to realize that it is non-public and he

has to realize that it has gotten through some improper means

:

before a tippee is responsible.
QUESTION:

So just a wrong to the sellers alone

i

would not violate 10(b)?
MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

Just using information without some —

Just non-disclosure to the sellers

wouldn’t violate 10(b)?
:

MR. SHAPIRO:

That’s quite correct.

That’s quite

correct.
QUESTION:

Unless you went on and showed that the

53
Information was wrongfully obtained and being wrongfully used.
MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

That’s correct.

That Is correct.

Mr, Shapiro, your argument as I understand

it turns on there being a relationships however one might
describe it.

In Ute, as I understand it* there was what

would normally be regarded as a relationship of trust, there
was a bank involved, a transfer agent or trustee.

In this

case, you had a man who had access to information, he would
not normally be viewed as a trustee.
fiduciary.

You used the word

He may have been sort of a sub-agent, Pandick was

perhaps an agent for a purpose, but you carry that thought
along, you have office boys in law firms, for example, you
have the cleaner who comes into an office firm at night and
who is smart enough to do what this gentlesian did, you go all
the way down the line to anybody who sort of picks up informa­
tion, regardless of how tenuous the relationship may be.
MR, SHAPIRO:

Well, our position is that stolen,

embezzled or converted information can?t be used in the stock
market under any circumstances.

Under the

situations that

you pose, if someone picked up a piece of paper without
realizing what it was in a ramdom way, that certainly would
not be a violation.

But if a secretary or a para-legal work­

ing on a tender offer prospectus were to take this informa­
tion and knowingly use it and realising that this was wrongful
conduct, that would be a violation.

It would indeed.

These

54
people are entrusted x*ith confidential information and they
have a fiduciary duty to tender offerors»
a principle of an agency»

That principle is

Where they have been trusting and

a violation cf that trust, there is a duty to disclose to
the tender offerors before misappropriating their information»
QUESTION:

But the cleaning woman who was smart

enough to understand the situation, who didn’t work for the law
firm but who did pick up not just one piece of paper but xfho
picked up drafts of prospectuses of tender offers, what cate­
gory would she fall in?
MR. SHAPIRO:

I would say that that situation, you

would have theft rather than embezzlement.

There hasn’t been

an entrusting of information to the cleaning woman, but if she
realizes that she is stealing something that belongs to some­
one else, that can’t be used in the stock market.

The com­

mission discussed this at some length in the Investors
Management decision, where it held that getting

Information

through burglary or commercial espionage is an improper way
to get information to exploit investors in the stoek market.
