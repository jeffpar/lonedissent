PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear* arguments

next in 78-1595, Lewis v, United States.
Mr, Woods I think you may proceed whenever you
are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW W. WOOD s ESQ„,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. WOOD:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I represent the petitioner, George Calvin Lewis,
Jr., and the facts of the case are as follows:

Lewis was

charged in a two-count indictment, one count of which is
relevant to Your Honors* consideration.

They charged him

with the violation of section 1202 of 18 U.S.C. Appendix,
that is the possession of a firearm, having previously
been convicted of a felony.
The case carae on before the United States
District Court in Richmond with a jury.

On the morning

of trial, counsel in a motion, in the context of a motion
for continuance pointed, out to the court in a proffer
that the conviction which formed the basis for the indict­
ment had been, obtained in counsel’s judgment in violation
a pure violation of Gideon v. W&inwright.

Counsel told

the court that he had called a lawyer in Florida who had
been kind enough to check the records and that the records

of fche Florida court, the records on the day of trial
showed affirmatively that Lewis had no lawyer-

Collater­

ally it was also represented to the court that the indict­
ment possibly was defective although that issue was not
pursued in view of the trial court’s ruling on Gideon.
QUESTION:

Mr. Wood, did it show affirmatively

that ha had no lawyer or did it just show or fail to show
that he had one?
MR. WOOD:

No, sir, this is not a silent record.

I was told or counsel was told by the lawyer in Florida
that it showed affirmatively that Lewis had no lawyer.
QUESTION:

Is there anything in the record other

than what counsel told?
MR. WOOD:

No, sir.

It was a proffer though

and was accepted by the government for purposes of the
court’s ruling.

I would submit that that settles the

issue»
I might point out, sir, the actual record
which was introduced were the orders on the day of
sentencing, not the orders with respect to the finding of
guilt.

1 believe that order — and it is in the record —

recites that Lewis having previously or earlier been
found guilty came on this date to be sentenced.

That is

a silent record.
QUESTION:

What is your position here?

If we

go along with you, is it your position that the conviction
must be reversed?
MR. WOOD:

Mo, sir.

I am happy to accept the

burden of proof, if Your Honor please.

proof.

QUESTION:

Say that again.

MR. WOOD:

I am happy to accept the burden of

Are you saying reversed and dismissed?

have misunderstood you.

I may

I offered to prove, granted the

continuance, that Lewis in fact had no lawyer,

I also

made a proffer of indigency, so that thi3 is unlike some
of the earlier cases and the dissenting opinions in which
no burden of proof was even attempted.
QUESTION:

Do you disagree with Judge Russellfs

statement in the opinion for the Fourth Circuit on the
first page of the petition for writ of certiorari which
has its APP. (1), where Judge Russell says, "The defendant
does not deny on this appeal the receipt and possession
of a firearm.

Neither does he dispute his earlier con-

vi/tion in Florida or that such conviction is facially
valid."
MR. WOOD:
that.

Mr. Justice Rehnquists I do dispute

I have said things sometimes not knowing what l*m

saying, but I don’t recall ever conceding that.

The

judge might have pointed out in his dissent, but i do not
understand the appellant Lewis to concede that it is

6
facially valid.
QUESTION:

Did the dissenting judge make any

issue of that?
MR. WOOD:

Yes, sir, he pointed it out, Mr,

C

Chief Justice, as I just said.

He did not understand my

position to be conceding facial validity.
I might add, if it is responsive, that I frankly
see no difference between facial validity or invalidity,
for that matter.

The nan either had a lawyer or he

didn't and to me that is a technical nicety which has no
place —
QUESTION:

But if you go back twenty years, it

may be very difficult to find out whether he had a lawyer
or didn't.
MR. WOOD:

Well, that question has been

addressed by this Court with agony I am sure sometimes,
but it is never too late to cure a wrong that was done,
whether it was twenty years ago or fifty years ago.
tainly it is a problem.

Cer­

I might say practically, sir,

that it would not have been a problem, I don't think in
this case, in view of what I was told by this lawyer in
Florida.
QUESTION:

Well, wasn't there some other way

to make that a little more clear and eliminated it as an
issue in the ease -, the proof of whether there was or was

7
not counsel?
MR. WOOD:

Well, as I say. Fir. Chief Justice,

it came on on a proffer, I presume that had the judge
agreed with me, 1 presume that he would have granted the
continuance.

It was a non-jury trial, it only took a

couple of hours to try.
QUESTION:

Mr. Wood, Judge Winter’s dissenting

opinion says that in arguing the correctness of the
District Court’s ruling that the government in effect
concedes that for the present purposes the conviction was
obtained in violation of defendant’s Sixth Amendment
rights.

And I had understood that for the purposes of

the case that the government made the same concession.
MR. WOOD:

I had never --

QUESTION:

It assumes at least that it accepts

the same hypothesis.
MR. WOOD:

Yes, sir. I had never understood

their position to be any different.
QUESTION:

And argues upon that hypothesis.

MR. WOOD:

Absolutely, sir.

QUESTION:

Is the final sentence or the final

two sentences in his dissent to put a mild amount of
question on that, because Judge Winter would remand in
order to determine whether or not — remand for a new
trial, at which time it would be demonstrated unequivocally

8
one way or the other.
MR. WOOD:

I think so, Mr. Chief Justice.

presume that would be z. remand.

I

I didn’t take it as a

stipulation so much as simply for the purpose of arguing
for the purpose of my proffer.
QUESTION:

But in Judge Winter’s view that

could not be accomplished except by granting a new trial,
by making a new recordo
MR. WOOD:

Yes, sir, an inquiry into that, a

factual inquiry.
QUESTION:

That is what you tried to do, isn’t

MR. WOOD:

Yes, sir, absolutely»

QUESTION:

Ard that is what you complained

it?

about, that you didn’t have a right to do that.
MR. WOOD:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

I thought I understood you.;

MR. WOOD:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

It would under 922(h).

MR. WOOD:

It would be sufficient if your client

were merely under indictment.
MR. WOOD:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

Dees that square with your position

as to convictions?

MR. WOOD:

Oh, absolutely, sir.

I think, Mr»

Justice Blackmun, that the congressional intent in the
indictment phase is obvious.

Indictment, of course, is

One has his constitutional

guarantees, for example, to a speedy trial which will
remove it in a short time, and the use of the word
"indictment” certainly is unequivocal.
May it please the Court, in constructing the
statute I would urge ycu that it is not necessary to
reach the consitutional issue.

The government, I think

the thrust of the government's argument has been and
seems to be that if Congress had meant to exclude Lewis
from the scope of the statute, that is to exclude people
who had been convicted in violation of Gideon, that it
would have spelled it out.
true.

I think the reverse really is

I think that had Congress, with its awareness of

Gideon, had it meant tc include people like.Lewis, I
think it is just as logical to say that they would have
spelled that out.
I am told that, for example, after this Court's
decision in Miranda anc some other cases that there was
considerable congressional discussion about certain cases.
Of course, I don't believe there has ever been any great
congressional stir over the Court's ruling in Gideon.
certainly they were aware of Gideon.

Likewise5 we are dealing with a penal statute.
It must be strictly construed.

I would suggests if Your

Honors please, that the statute is ambiguous for more
than one reason.

Obviously* if you took a literal read­

ing of the statute* one who was convicted of a felony and
won on appeal, for example* and had the thing dismissed,
and later possesses a firearm

well, if you read the

statute literally this man has been convicted of a felony.
I don't believe it excludes people —
QUESTION:

Well, doesn't the reversal affirma­

tively vacate the conviction so that there is at that
time no conviction extant?
MR. WOOD:

Yes. sir*

QUESTION:

It is quite like the situation you

have here, isn’t it?
MR. WOOD:

That’s right, and yet Lewis, even

if he had filed his writ of corum novis or what have you
and had the judgment vacated, Mr. Chief Justice, he still
would have been convicted of a felony at some time prior.
So I think the statute is ambiguous.

I think

there is an ambiguity* a latent ambiguity in the word
"felon” or "felony" or convicted of a felony.

I think it

Well, do you think the language of

Congress on its face is susceptible of including within
its sweep the position of a person who has been convicted
by a jury has appealed and the appellate court has re­
versed the judgment and directed a judgment of not guilty
to be entered?
MR. WOOD:

Yes, sir, I think so, but I think

there is an important difference,
QUESTION:

And you really see no difference be­

tween that and the question of a person who has been con­
victed and who after he is prosecuted under this statute
who has never appealed, now says I didn't have a lawyer?

MR. WOOD:

I do see a difference»

I think the

man that you mentioned first, the man who had his jury
trial presumably had a fair trial, I think it might be
more analogous to say what if he had a jury trial but no
lawyer.

We are talking about, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, the

This one though —

I think there is a

difference, at least that man has had it fair and square.

MR. WOOD:

Yes,

QUESTION:

— and got his conviction reversed.

This person never bothered to take any action to get his
conviction 3et aside until he was indicted for a new
trial for another offense.
MR. WOOD:

That’s correct and it raises an in­

teresting point that I have thought about, is if Lewis
had come into my office — and I hope I don’t publicly
confess malpractice or potential for it — but if he had
come in and said, look, I’ve been convicted in violation
of Gideon v. Wainwright, I had absolutely no lawyer, what
have I got to do -— I don’s think it would be malpractice
for a laywer to say nothing, that is do nothing.

QUESTION:

Mr. Wood, suppose instead of no

lawyer he offered to prove and for the purpose of the
decision the government accepted the fact that his con­
viction rested entirely on a conviction that was obtained
from him by stringing him up over a door and beating him
up or something like that, and therefore the conviction
was void.

What would you say about that kind of case?
MR. MOOD:

Sir, I think, as the Harvard Law

Review article points out, I think a line has to be drawn*
Fortunately, I think I am at the right end of the line.

It might be that a

proper distinction to rrake is between a conviction that is
void or one that is voidable if anybody can determine what
that is.
QUESTION:

But that is just as void as one where

you donrfc have a lawyer.
MR. WOOD:

I agree.

difference or not?
MRo WOOD:

Well, he knew he was behind bars.

No, sir, he never attacked —
QUESTION:

He had no habeas corpus, no collateral

attack of any kind on the conviction?
MR. WOOD:

No, sir.

You know, as you pointed

out in the dissent, Mr. Chief Justice, when Lewis was
convicted it was the law of the land.

I believe he was

convicted just prior to Gideon and put away in prison in
Florida.

I believe this is in the record, so I am not

going outside it.

When he got out of prison in Florida,

he joined the Army and went to Vietnam and came out.

So,

no, he didn’t think it was void.
I would like, if it please the Court, to touch
on some more aspects of the constitutionality.

As I

said, I believe throughout the case in my brief, 1 think
the issue before you bells down to an interpretation of
three cases, chiefly Burgett, Loper and Tucker.

Analyzing

each of the three, I have come not only within the
majority opinions but I believe that I am safe on the
dissents a3 well.

I know again, Mr. Chief Justice, that

16
some members of the Court were concerned because in Loper
and in Tucker you were speaking not only of a prospective
application of Gideon but you were talking about a retro­
spective application.

That is, these trials where the

evidence was introduced of the Gideon violations, these
trials had taken place long before Gideon was ever de­
cided and at the time they were introduced — this is
the case, I believe, in Loper — the trial judge ruled
correctly, it was the law of the land.
That is not the case here, of course.

Lewis’

trial in Richmond a couple of years ago, the law of the
land was Gideon and he had been clearly convicted in
violation of that, so I believe I have excluded that
portion of the dissent.
I find it impossible or difficult, as Judge
Winter did, to make any meaningful distinction between
this case and Burgett v. Texas.

I had thought that the

Court had made clear that a conviction obtained in
violation of Gideon was useless for any purpose, either
to enhance punishment or to establish guilt, and both
were done in this case.

That is, he gets 18 months to

serve by reason of this conviction, so he has got an
enhanced punishment, and it'was used as a predicate for
the conviction itself, that is the whole basis for it
t*?as this conviction in violation of Gideon.

17
I would, Mr. Chief Justice, ask that the balance
of my time be reserved for whatever rebuttal I would have.
If I may add one thing ----- I think I have made it clear
but it Is worth repeating, and that is the government and
I apparently differ on the phraseology of the issue,

I

phrased It so in the petition that whether one convicted
in violation of Gideon v. Wainwright could defend a fire­
arms charge on that basis, the government has the most
sweeping phraseology throughout their brief and referred
to it as may one attack the constitutionality,
I come here today on the wings of Gideon,
Loper, and Burgett and not any other basis,

18
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. LEVANDER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. LEVANDER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
First, in response to Mr. Justice Blackraun’s
and Mr. Justice Stewart’s inquiries, I think that the
government has conceded for the purposes of the proceedings
here that the petitioner has alleged that his conviction
was invalid under Gideon v. Wainwright.

If the court

accepts either petitioner’s statutory or constitutional
claim and rejects the government’s arguments, then the
appropriate remedy I think both petitioner and respondent
.agree would he a remand to the District Court for a de­
termination of whether or not in fact the prior conviction
was void under Gideon v. Wainwright.
As I understand his proffer, the record of the
conviction does not affirmatively show that the petitioner
did not have counsel at the time of his 1961 conviction.
Rather, tb

— I believe that the Florida lawyer indicated

to Mr. Wood that the record, the transcript of the proceed­
ings did indicate that he was without counsel.
QUESTION:

Well, showed that he was uncounseled

or did not show that he had counsel, which is it?
MR. LEVANDER:

Well, I believe that he alleges

that the Florida lawyer told him that the transcript

19
indicated affirmatively that petitioner was without counsel
at the time of his prior conviction.

We have never had an

opportunity to explore that as a matter of proceedings be­
cause the District Court and the Court of Appeals correctly
in our view said that whether or not he was without counsel
at his 1961 conviction is irrelevant.
He was convicted in 1961 and he never overturned
that conviction, he never obtained a pardon, and he never
pursued his administrative remedies under the act.
QUESTION:
proffer

Would that have been admissible, that

in the present trial?
MR. LEVANDER:

I mean it is double hearsay.

That's correct.

I think what

happened was that he asked for a continuance so he could
find out more fully what the actual facts were, and the
judge said, well, there is no need for a continuance
because it is irrelevant, which is our point.
As I started to say, the petitioner was con­
victed in lS6l in the Florida state courts of a felony»
That conviction has never been overturned and he has
never obtained a pardon, and he has never pursued his
administragive remedies under the act.

Nonetheless, he

claims that the act should be construed to permit him to
attack the validity of his prior conviction for the first
time in his federal gur lav/ prosecution»

Alternatively,

he claims that if the act does not provide for such a

20

defense, that the Constitution requires it, at least where
it is alleged that the prior conviction was obtained in
violation of the right to counsel.
In our view, the language and structure of the
act refutes petitioners statutory claim.
QUESTION:

The act —

Mr. Levander-, let me get back for a

minute to this continuance question.

I can fully under­

stand the government’s desire to resolve a case on a
fairly broad basis, but after the continuance was denied,
a trial took place?
MR. LEVANDER:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

And was any evidence adduced at trial

to show that the prior conviction was uncounseled?
MR. LEVANDER:

From the record I understand that

at the conclusion of the government’s case, Mr. Wood put
the petitioner on the stand and that he said, now, judge,
I want him to testify about the prior conviction and his
lack of counsel, and the judge said, well, we have already
gone through this, and he said, I agree, I just want to
make my objection that he would testify and the judge
said —
QUESTION:

So the judge refused the proffer

during the. trial?
MR. LEVANDER:
I understand it.

That’s correct also.

That is how

I think that the transcript, as far as

21
I know, Is partially reprinted in the appendix and If the
Court needed a fuller transcript we can obtain one*
As I started to say, the act unequivocally and
broadly declares that any person who has been convicted
of a felony may be receive, possess or transport a fire­
arm.

The plain meaning of that sweeping language is that

any person who has an outstanding conviction, particularly
ones such as the petitioner who served four years for
that conviction, is barred from possessing a firearm.

No

exception appears in the language for a prior conviction
that is Invalid or a prior conviction that is invalid
because of Gideon v. Wainwright or anything like that.
QUESTION:

Is it what you are saying that if

the man wants to purchase a firearm for whatever reason,
assuming he is going to be a guard at a plant or si bank,
that his first step is to go and take affirmative action
by collateral attack on the conviction and have it set
aside on that ground and then proceed to purchasethe
firearm in which he could recite that there was no valid
conviction outstanding against him or words to that
effect?

Is that what you are saying In effect?
MR. LEVANDER:

Chief Justice.

That is absolutely correct, Mr.

I would point out a couple of things.

First, of course, in this case the petitioner was not
going to become a guard at an institution.

He was arrested

22
for hav:lng a concealed weapon on his person as he was
about to enter an illegal gambling casino<>

I would

further point out that the act gives the defendant who
has been convicted and either thinks he has been convicted
unfairly or who thinks that his conviction is not indicative
of his perpensity to misuse firearms three alternatives
before going out and possessing the firearm*
First, he can collaterally attack his convic­
tion in the appropriate court.

Here he should have gone

back to Florida state court where they are familiar with
Florida law and Florida proceedings and Florida records
and not raise it for the first time in a federal court
after going out and possessing a firearm.
Second, he could obtain a qualifying pardon
under section 1203 of the act.

A pardon must state
|

•;

specifically not only that he is pardoned but that he
is pardoned and can use firearms or can possess firearms.
Third, failing the ability to overturn the con­
viction for one reason, or another or get a pardon, the
convicted person has the alternative under section 923(c)
of the act to petition the Secretary of the Treasury for
a dispensation.

This is not a meaningless procedure*

In the year 1978, some 1,75^ applications were made by
convicted felons for a dispensation, and of those some­
thing like 57^ were actually granted.

So this is a

23
real procedure which is followed by many people who are
apprehensive about their prior conviction.
Now, as I started to say, there is no exception
in the act, no defense in the act regarding the validity
of the prior conviction and such a defense would seemingly
be irreeonvilable with Congress' decision to impose a
similar firearm disability on persons under indictment.
If the petitioner is correct about the statu­
tory construction of the act, then he would attribute to
Congress the following purpose:

The person who was con­

victed albeit without counsel obviously has already been
indicted; yet, even though he has been indicted and a
jury or a judge has found him guilty beyond a reasonable
doubt, albeit without counsel, he would be deemed more
trustworthy than a person who is merely under indictment.
Yet a person whose conviction is overturned for lack of
counsel is not scofct free, he is still under indictment.
It is simply irreconcilable with the congressional
language to construe the act to permit the validity of
that defense.
We think the absence of -—
QUESTION:

In this case, there was no'discussion

about Congress or about anything.
MR. LEVANDER:
Your Honor.

Well, that is not exactly true,

The legislative history -—

24
QUESTION:

It must have been about ten minutes.

MR. LEVANDER:

Well, there is a lot more dis­

cussion about the parallel provisions In section 922 and
those were enacted at the same time and use the same
exact language, "has been convicted,” and the legislative
history a3 a whole shows a clear congressional purpose to
broadly reach out, as this Court has recognized in
Scarborough and Barrett and Huddleston and in Bass, a
broad purpose of Congress to limit the flow of firearms
to persons who might potentially be dangerous to society.
And certainly the petitioner fits into that category.
It is particularly reflective of congressional
intent that there is nc specific validity defense because
first of all there are exceptions and defenses contained
within the act. express ones, but not the ones sought by
petitioner.
Moreover, where Congress has thought it appro­
priate to allow defendants to challenge prior convictions,
it has so provided.

Per example, in the Special Dangerous

Offenders statute, which is found at 18 U.S.C. 3575(e):
Congress has specifically provided the defense sought by
the petitioner here.

Interestingly, the Special Dangerous

Offenders statute was enacted as Title X
Crime Control Act of 1970.

of the Organized

Title XI of that very same act

Is an explosive control statute which In high verba adopts

the gun control provisions, and yet in that Title XI no
special defense is made, the validity that is sought by
the petitioner.
So it is therefore clear that Congress knows
how to create such a defense or exception if they want to
and that it purposely did not here, and that is quite
understandable given the general thrust of the act, which
is that persons who by their prior acts

or characteristics

have indicated they might be dangerous, should clear their
name first before going out and possessing a firearm.

It

is a clear bright line rule.
The petitioner's construction of the act would
encourage defendants arc! people who have been convicted
to simply guess whether or not they think that their prior
conviction is valid.

That would certainly narrow the

ambit of the act and it would also tend to defeat the
purpose of Congress which was to make sure that people
who are running around with firearms or getting firearms
are to be trusted,
QUESTION:

Well, is it a question of whether

they can be trusted or whether they are the kind of people
who fit into the category that Congress said should not
be permitted to have firearms?
MR. LEVANDER

That's right, Congress has

sweepingly created these categories of persons and a

26
convicted person lias various options to show that he
doesn’t belong in that category.

One of them is simply

not to go out and buy a firearm and ignore the fact that
he has a conviction.
QUESTION:

What if he had been indicted and the

indictment had never been pressed and he had never been
tried and was out on bail for three years, four years,
would the statute apply?
MR. LEVANDER:
would apply.

Well, the under indictment part

Presumably he would go into court and

simply have it dismissed for failure to prosecute under
the Speedy Trial Act or something of that nature or the
speedy trial clause of the Constitution.

He has got

nothing.
QUESTION:

I am assuming three or four years

and he has done nothing and he is still under indictment
and then in the same posture as this fellow going into
an illegal establishment
MR. LEVANDER:

packing a gun»
He would have violated the act

922(g) or 922(h) if the receipt or transportation could
be shown .aider the statutory language.

Under indictment

is under indictment; convicted means convicted.
We think basically that the thrust of peti­
tioner's argument is his constitutional claims based- on
a Burgett line of cases.

Before turning to that though,

27
I think that in our view this is really a due process
case and the question is whether or not Congress has the
power to keep firearms out of the hands of persons that
they think have exhibited characteristics which might
suggest that they might misuse the firearms until such
time as they clear their name.
QUESTION:
in this case, is it?

Well, that is not really the issue
I mean, I haven't heard the peti­

tioner question, for example, the power of Congress to
keep firearms out of tYe hands of people who have been
indicted for something.
HR. LEVANDER:
QUESTION:
is it?

Well, if that —

That is not the issue in this case,

It is not due process.
MR. LEVANDER:
QUESTION:

Well, let me try to explain.

All right.

MR. LEVANDER:

If Congress could pass now, if

Congress is constitutionally empowered to say people
under indictment may net possess a firearm and that is
valid —
QUESTION:

Yes?

MR. LEVANDER:

-- then it cannot be or it

would be completely illogical for the Sixth Amendment
to require that persons who have not only been indicted
but have been convicted and have not done something about

28
that conviction cannot possess a firearm and ignore the
fact of their conviction.
QUESTION:

I did not understand Mr. Wood's basic

argument to be that Congress would not have had the power
to do this but that in fact Congress did not, that it is
a matter basically of statutory construction.
MR. LEVANDER:
QUESTION:

Maybe I misapprehended.

MR. LEVANDER:
ments.

I think that —

Yes, I think he makes both argu­

I think that, as I tried to demonstrate in the

last two minutes, that all the indicia of congressional
intent, the sweeping language, the legislative history,
the policy and the express exceptions and other acts
show what Congress intended to do.

He not only claims

that Congress did not —
QUESTION:

Did not do it but also that he

could not.
MR. LEVANDER:

That’s right, and as to that

point —
QUESTION:

For that argument that you are now

addressing,
MR. LEVANDER:
QUESTION:

Right.

And under your reasoning you could

make Burgett into a due process case.
MR. LEVANDER:

Well, I think probably that

29
the Court might have decided under due process principles.
I mean the use of so many collateral and perhaps preju­
dicial convictions was simply a violation of due process
as opposed to the Sixth Amendment.
QUESTION:

Mr. Levander, you say that if a

prior conviction has been set aside that he still is sub­
ject to section —
MR. LEVANDER:
QUESTION:

No, that once the prior —

Well, he has been convicted.

MR. LEVANDER:

Well. I think that would be a —

first of all, as a —QUESTION:

Well, he has been, hasn't he?

MR. LEVANDER:
QUESTION:

Well, the Chief Justice —

That is what the statute says, he

has—*
MR. LEVANDER:

Well, as the Chief Justice

pointed out, once a person's conviction has been over­
turned, the judgment of conviction is vacated and so
therefore he is no longer a convicted felon0
QUESTION:

That isn't what the statute says.

It says anyone who has been convicted.
MR. LEVANDER:

Well, I think that would be an

overly literal interpretation of the language which the

colleague uses.

QUESTION:

Well, we say someone who has an
The language that —

You would add that word rather than

the other?
MR. LEVANDER:

The other language would be more

appropriate if Congress said who has ever been convicted
regardless of whether or not -~
QUESTION:

It might be, but it says who has been

convicted and that literally would cover my case.
MR. LEVANDER:
QUESTION:

Well, literally —

And you say no, you should construe

that out of the statute and your colleague says if you
are going to do that, if you would ask Congress, surely
they wouldn't have intended to include an invalid convic­
tion in this prohibition.
MR. LEVANDER:

Well, the existence in the

statute of a pardon procedure and administrative procedure
for people who had outstanding convictions strongly sug­
gests that Congress intended that convicted meant an out­
standing conviction.

The person who has had their convic­

tion overturned certainly doesn't need a pardon.

And if

you went to a governor of the state of Florida and said
I had my conviction overturned but I -want a pardon, he
would say, you know, you're crazy.

That would not be a

31
%

normal procedure, I don*t think.

And I think that the

normal plain meaning of the language has been convicted
of a felony is someonw who has an outstanding conviction.
QUESTION:

Do you mean either he has served his

sentence -- especially if he had served his sentence, his
conviction is still you say a valid conviction.
MR. LEVANDER:

Well, it is presumptively valid

under Johnson v. Zerbsf until such time as it has been
overturned and certainly a petitioner who has served four
years for his crime in Florida in 1961 knew that he had
been convicted.
I started to say that if the general classifi­
cation of the statute is a rational one and it is a limited
civil disability regarding firearms that has been imposed
by Congress valid as to all people who had outstanding
convictions, then it follows that Congress could impose
a criminal penalty on someone who ignored the fact of
that conviction and failed to pursue administrative or
judicial remedies to overturn that conviction prior to
possessing a firearm.
As this Court stated in Yakis v. United States
— I am quoting from page 444 of Volume 321 — there is
"no principle of law or provision of the Constitution
which precludes Congress from making criminal the violar ■

tion of an administrative regulation by one who has failed

32
to avail himself of an adequate separate procedure for the
adjudication of its validity."
Therefore, if the classification is valids and
we submit that it its submit that it is valid for several
reasons, then the imposition of a criminal penalty by one
who ignores the fact of his conviction and fails to avail
himself of the adequate procedures that have been supplied
by Congress, Twill — then there is no question as to the
constitutionality of the act.
QUESTION:

What about one who has been convicted

but he has appealed his case and the case is pending?
MR. LEVANDER:

Well, in United States v. Liles,

in the Ninth Circuit, they held that both the act applies
to someone who has a conviction on appeal and there is no
constitutional impediment to convicting him.
QUESTION:

Ar.d you agree with that?

MR. LEVANDER:
QUESTION:

I agree with that, yes.

What happens to the poor man that

didn’t have a lawyer when he was convicted and didn’t
have a lawyerduring the four years when he was serving
his time and he hasn’t got a lawyer yet, he

He didn't have sense enough to get

a lawyer the first time.
MR. LEVANDER:

Well, 1*800 ~

This is sort of a non-lw yer man but

he is still a citizen of the United States.
MR. LEVANDER:
QUESTION:

He certainly is, sir.

He just hasn’t had the benefit of a

lawyer.
MR. LEVANDER:

But l.,300 felons knew last year

and sent applications to the Secretary of the Treasury.
QUESTION:

I thought constitutional rights were

individual.
MR. LEVANDER:
QUESTION:

They certainly are.

Limited by 1,800 or

MR. LEVANDER:

That is absolutely correct.

We

t

think that Congress, knowing that there was a tremendous
and precipitous rise in violence and particularly that
violence is connected to gun possession by people with
criminal records or characteristics, that it was entitled

to broadly provide that anyone who has been convicted,
whether or not the conviction may be subject to collateral
attack, cannot possess a firearm until such time as they
clear their name.
It is particularly constitutional and meets
equal protection analysis challenges because 925(c) makes
sure that the statute is individually tailored.

Someone

who thinks that their conviction is not indicative of
their perpensity to misuse firearms can go in and apply
to the Secretary for dispensation.
Moreover, even by focusing on the sub-class of
persons whose convictions are possibly subject to
collateral attack,that the statute is still rational.
Certainly a person who has been convicted even without
counsel has been both indicted and found guilty beyond
a reasonable doubt, and those facts differentiate him
from the populace at large.
QUESTION:

How about the case where the

possession of a•firearm takes place before a conviction
has been overturned but it is overturned prior to in­
dictment?
MR. LEVANDER:
QUESTION:

He still violates the statute.

So the crucial date is xvhen he

those eases are distinguishable for several reasons.

White’s question.

QUESTION:

As I understood it,, a person is con­

victed, he then collaterally attacks his conviction
successfully and has that conviction set aside and the
state appeals, and at that time may he be indicted for
violation of Title 3.8 —
MR. LEVANDER:

After he overturns his convic­

tion he received a firearm?
QUESTION:

And It is pending on appeal by the

MR. LEVANDER:

Then he is violating section

QUESTION:

MR. LEVANDER:
QUESTION:

The statute as we construe it -—■

The statute says has been convicted

and that would make it illegal for such a person to possess

White made before?

Yes.

MR. LEVANDER:

Yes, and I suggested that that

ally and you are relying on the literal terms of the

decide that here, because here we have a —

MR. LEVANDER:
QUESTION:

Well, the —

In literal terms, that is what the

statute says,
MR, LEVANDER:

But when you think of someone

who has been convicted of a felony, you don’t think of
someone who has overturned that conviction because the
order of conviction has been vacated.
QUESTION:

Maybe you don’t think of somebody

39
as such? but the Congress made this statute applicable,
made it a criminal offense for anybody who has been con­
victed, regardless of the ultimate fate of that conviction.
MR. LEVANDER:
QUESTION:

Well, for the purposes —

Can’t he be indicted and convicted

for having violated the statute by obtaining a gun while
there is an outstanding indictment against him?
MR. LEVANDER:
QUESTION:

Yes, he could.

Because the habeas corpus judgment

doesn’t nullify the indictment, it nullifies only the
conviction.
MR. LEVANDER:
QUESTION:

That’s right.

But he can't be under 1202(a)(1),

can he?
MR, LEVANDER:
QUESTION:

Not in our view, Your Honor.

That is the statute involved here,

isn’t it?
MR. LEVANDER:

That's right.

If the man has

had his conviction overturned, he is no longer someone
who has been convicted.
QUESTION:

How come?

MRo LEVANDER:

Because the word "convicted" as

used by Congress in our view means that someone who has *
a conviction outstanding.
QUESTION:

In other words, you are telling us

the statute doesn’t mean what it says.
MR. LEVANDER

Well, the Court need not decide

that question here, since in any event your broader read­
ing of the words "has been convicted" certainly applies
to petitioner who has never overturned his conviction.
QUESTION:

Well, I was wondering just what your

argument was.
MR. LEVANDER:
QUESTION:

We are saying —»

You are relying on the words of the

statute.
MR. LEVANDER:

Well, we are.

We are only say­

ing that the plain meaning of that statute is not the
broader definition or limited definition that you are
pressing upon me but rather a position in between what

*
Somewhere In between with what, it

says and what It doesn’t say?
(Laughter)
QUESTION:

Mr. Levander, isn’t it just like

the First Amendment, Congress shall make no law means
Congress may make some law?
MR. LEVANDER:

Thank you, Mr. Justice Blackmun.

At any rate, I am aware of no federal prosecu­
tion of someone who has possessed or received a firearm
after the time that their conviction was overturned, and

that is the policy that the government follows with re­
gard to this act.
I started to try to distinguish Burgett and
that line of cases and the first distinction is a dis­
tinction that this Court drew in Loper itself.

In a

footnote in the majority opinion in that case, the Court
distinguished between two things:

First of all, there is

a — what was not good in that ease was the use of an un­
counseled conviction to impeach a defendant’s testimony
generally.

Howefer, the Court suggested that a different

result would be reached if on direct testimony the de­
fendant got up and saida "I have never been convicted,"
simply ignoring the fact of his prior conviction, albeit
uncounseled.
In that case he would just be ignoring the
historical fact of his conviction as opposed to the
general impeachment where the reliability of the convic­
tion is critical to its impeachment value.
say the same thing.

And here we

The reliability of the individual

conviction with regard to the defendant propensity to
misuse a firearm is only relevant in two respects:

First,

in the administrative proceeding before the Secretary of
the Treasury and also that the general group of persons
who have been convicted are more likely to misuse firearms
than the populace at large.

42
Howevery in the criminal trial itself, it is
only the historical fact of conviction x?hich is at issue.
The second distinction I x»;ould draw between
the Burgett line of cases and this case is that Congress
has simply provided a timing differential.

The defendant,

the person who has been convicted must go out and clear
his name prior to obtaining the firearm, and the civil
d3.sabilit5r which is imposed by the statute attaches im­
mediately upon conviction»

The criminal penalty is im­

posed when he simply ignores the civil disability and
ignores the administrative procedures set up by Congress
or judicial procedures.
In Burgett and in Loper and in Tucker, the
first time that the prior conviction, allegedly uncoun­
seled convictions in those cases became relevant was at
the criminal proceeding itself, not immediately upon the
conviction, and therefore it was appropriate to allow
the defendants in those cases to challenge the validity
of their prior convictions at the criminal trial.
Here the petitioner eschewed his right to chal­
lenge his prior conviction at an earlier stage which
Congress directed him to do so and for failing to do that
Congress has imposed a penalty»
If counsel’s interpretation of the Burgett line
of cases and the Sixth Amendment is correct, it would lead

43
to the conclusion that a person who is convicted, albeit
without counsel, and is in jail could escape from jail
without any kind of penalty being attached, he can simply
ignore the fact of his conviction and walk out tomorrow
because under his theory

it is a3 if there is no such

thing as the conviction, and I don’t think that is what
Congress or this Court meant in those cases.
QUESTION:

Mr. Wood tells us in his reply brief

that Virginia has held, just that.
MR. LEVANDER:

Well, Mr. Wood suggests that the

Court didn’t —- correct me, but that the Court didn’t
reach that issue, it didn’t have to, and the court in
Virginia has never said that and there are other courts
that have suggested quite the opposite, that a person
ean*t simply ignore the fact of his conviction and escape»
QUESTION:

Why do you think that conclusion

inevitably follows from his argument anyway?
MR. LEVANDER:
QUESTION:

Well, I think he say3 that —

We are dealing with an act of Congress

and it is really — at least one of his points is that it
is a matter of construing that act of Congress, and maybe
the act of Congress makes it a penal offense to escape
from the jail or prison, then there would be a question of
construing that act of Congress, quite a different statute.
MR. LEVANDER:

I am now referring to his

constitutional argument and not his statutory arguments
and as to that the logic of his position, at least the
conclusion of the Sixth Amendment would justify such an
escape as the defendant could simply ignore the fact of
his conviction and walk out the jail door.
Thank you, Your Honor.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Do you have anything

further, Mr. Wood?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW W. WOOD, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER — REBUTTAL
MR. WOOD:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

Just a few comments if I may.
The joint appendix, if Your Honor please, be­

ginning at pages 2, 3, and so on show merely that the
point I believe was preserved.

The appendix will show

that after the government had rested its case in chief
and I believe called Mr. Lewis to the stand to testify
on other matters, we me.de the proffer again and that is
we told the judge that in view of his earlier ruling that
the evidence of the Gideon violation would not be re­
ceived, that we would rot go into that matter.

Of course,

it is conceivable that we could have gone forward even
without any records and had the man testify and he may
have been believed.

But in view of the judgefs earlier

ruling, he held that that would not be necessary to

s

45
present such proof.
I would only have a few more comments at this
time and that is the government has stressed that Lewis
and people like Lewis should have their convictions ex­
punged and file

petitions for writs of corum novis«

Real life just is not that way.

Lewis is not an educated

man, as are many people who are in his fix, and it just
doesn't happen that way, and I think this Court knows it.
To me, it is unthinkable that the Constitution would
permit some kind of penalty for his failure to have done
that.

He is already in trouble, as Mr. Justice Marshall

has said —
QUESTION:

I suppose you would say he could

be convicted even if he didn't know anything about the
gun law.'
MR. WOOD:

No, six’.

I am talking about a

deprivation of the constitutional right.
QUESTION:

I know, but even if he knew nothing

whatsoever about 1202 and got the gun, I suppose he could
be convicted, no matter how innocent he thought he was.
MR, WOOD:

Certainly, sir.

There is a differ­

ence between saying ignorance is no excuse or no defense
and saying that we've got to place an obligation on the
man
QUESTION:

You mean it would be different if

*16
he were told, if he had been told prior to his possession
of the gun- remember, don't pick up any guns because you
have been convicted and you haven’t had it set aside?
MR- WOOD:

No, sir, it would not be ~~

QUESTION:

Then what relevance is it whether he

is uneducated or not?
MR. WOOD:

Well, I think that the government

I think makes a fallacious argument on this score»
Loper decision I submit is controlling.

The

The real holding

in that ease is that it simply can’t be used affirmatively
by the prosecution, and that is the essence of it and the
gist of it.
QUESTION:

Mr. Wood, to the extent of just

confining it to a constitutional inquiry, supposing as
some cities do they have this regulation that you can’t
be a cab driver if you have been convicted of a felon
■and they have a form that you fill out and one of the
questions is have you ever been convicted of a felony
and if his answer is false you can be indicted for perjury»
MR. WOOD:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

He just ignores it because it is

totally void.

Can he be indicted for perjury as a

matter of constitutional law?
MR. WOOD:

Judge, I have thought about that a

good deal this morning, about the perjury aspect of it.

I think it is an interesting analogy,

I think — I can't

remember the leading case that this Court decided not too
long ago on perjury, bit I remember reading it some time
back, and I would think that you would have a difficult
time convicting him of perjury,
ambiguity In the word ’felon."

I think there is enough
I think it means validly

convicted felon and they could certainly exclude the man
who is convicted of a so-called felony in the absence of
flagrant denial of a Sixth Amendment right.
QUESTION:

I suppose then you are saying that

in the 1202 prosecution you can litigate the validity of
your prior conviction cn any ground you wanted?
MR. WOOD:

No, sir,

QUESTION:

Why?

MR. WOOD:

No, sir, I make no distinction.

QUESTION:

Well, what if he just says rny con­

Do you mean facial validity

or -—

viction is invalid because they introduced tainted
evidence.
MR. WOOD:

I don't —

QUESTION:

Dees the 1202 court hear that kind

of an attack on —
HR. WOOD:

No, sir.

QUESTION:

Why not?

MR. WOOD:

Well, I think the line can be drawn

48
with the ease that you have before you today as a Gideon
violation.
QUESTION:

I know, but this is a Fourth Amend­

ment violation.
MR. WOOD:

Yc-s, sir.

QUESTION:

Assume that he claims that he 'was

convicted on the basis of evidence

illegally seised

without a search warrant, in violation of the FourthAmendment, and the government says, well, so what, let’s
assume that It was, yoi. would say — would that kind of
a claim have to be heard in your case, in the 1202 case?
MR. WOOD:

I’m sorry. Your Honor, I may have

misunderstood you.
QUESTION:

Ir. the 1202 ease, would the court

have to entertain that kind of a defense?
MR. WOOD:

Your Honor, I don’t think so.

I

don’t think the court can draw a line
QUESTION:

Between what, between one consti­

tutional ~—
MR. WOOD:

Between those that are, for example,

obviously void and those

voidable, whatever that is.

I

confess not to be able to articulate the distinction very
well, but I think mine is an obviously void case.
QUESTION:

A number of states have a provision

that a person incarcerated in prison under a life sentence

^9
and commits a homicide in an effort to escape, for example,
and the death penalty is mandatory.
MR. WOOD:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

No-/, suppose you have a man who is

in prison under an uncounseled conviction for murder, he
has entered a guilty plea without counsel and he is in
for life and commits the homicide.
MR» WOOD:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

Yoi. would have to say, I suppose,

that he could not be uncer that statute because he is in
custody under an uncounseled and therefore unconstitutional
conviction?
MR. WOOD:

Judge, I would have to say thats yes,

sir»
i

think my time is up.

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you. gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
