MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear argument

ment Opportunity Commission.
Mr. Dickens, you assy proceed whenever you are

ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES R. DICKENS, ESQ»*
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. DICKENS;
please the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

I am James Dickens, of Karr, Tuttle,

Koch, Campbell, Mawer l Morrow, in Seattle, and I repre­
sent General Telephone, the petitioner herein»
We. have a very narrow procedural question
before tie Court.

It la very simple.

When the Equal

Employment Opportunity Commission brings a class action
under seation 706(f)(1) of the Civil Rights Act, does it
hay© to comply with Rule 23, and we believe It requires
.a very snort answer and that is yes.
& ' v|

QUESTION.:

■ Dickens.

Let me ask you this, if I may, Mr,

Why would EEOC bring a class action?

entitled to sue as a litigant.

It Is

I would have thought it

could have gotten virtually all the benefits of Its .
litigant status

as a litigant on behalf of the govern-

rent without denominating its action as a class action.
MR. DICKENS;

Your Honor, the government has

4
not te the prayer* or in the complaint said that it is a
class action* but by the scope of the complaint and the
relief requested, we believe that it is clear that it is
a class actiono

They moved at the trial court level to

bifurcate the issue of class liability from the issue of
individual damages.

We then moved to dismiss the- class

action aspects of the case and they acknowledge that
they were seeking relief for a class and that is what
they are.

We believe this is the way the statutory pro-

eedure is set up, they are seeking relief on behalf of
an individual plus on behalf of the class.
QUESTION:

But by definition there is no indi­

vidual :!n any conceivable class that the EEOC could repre­
sent other than itself* is there?
MR. DICKEMS:

Ms, lour Honor, that is where we

believe that what Congress has done in accordance with
its power to supersede the federal rales in whole or in
part, it. has declared that the cosmis sion is a properly
suing ptrty and therefore to that extent they have superseded tie requirement of Rule 23(a) that it be a member
of the class.

As a consequence by statute we believe

and we contend that Congress.has made the commission a
properly suing party under Rule 23-

Having taken that

step, they are a properly suing party, it is the same
as the Court has held, for example, in Hunt v. Washington

5
State App^e Commission, associations, state agencies and
so forth do have standing to bring suit on behalf of a
class, even if technically they are not a member of the
class.
QUESTION:

Who are all the members of the class?

MR. DICKERS:

The other members of the class,

that world depend on two things.
to the charging parties.
here.

First of all, we look

We have four charging parties

* hey are four women employees at one facility out

of 115 in one state out of five.
QUESTION:

Nov —

Are they of the same class as the

EEOC?
MR. DICKENS:

I didn’t say that.

There have

been cases in the lower court —
QUESTION:

Doesn’t a class action theory require

that they aX3 have the same claim?
MR. DICKENS:
QUESTION:

No, Your Honor, substantially —

Doesn’t the class action require that

all members of the class stand on the same footing?
MR. DICKENS:
QUESTION:

Isn’t that true?

MR. DICKENS:
QUESTION:

Yes, as a typicality requirement.

Yes, Your Honor, it is.

Now, who is on the same level as the

EEOC?
MR. DICKENS:

Your Honor, first of all, the EEOC

6
is —
QUESTION:

Who is cm the same level as the EEOC?

MR. DICKENS:
oy itself.

Your Honor, the EEOC is on a level

It is on the level with the charging parties.

That is our posisifcion, that the typicality requirement,
you loot to the charging parties.
QUESTION:

The EEOC —

Is that what Congress said when It

authorized, the EEOC to bring a suit on Its own behalf,
that it was to have the same status as the charging
parties?
MR. DICKENS:

Your Honor, w© believe that is

correct 1st the sense that it stands in their shoes.
QUESTION:

But is that what Congress said in

the sta" ute?
MR. DICKENS:

Your Honor, the statute itself,

as the Court is aware3 doesn't refer to this way or the
other ir. the sense of :1s the standing the same or other­
wise »

has- talked about this earlier today — the congressional
history kept referring to cease and desist approach
versus court enforcement approach and should we follow

QUESTION:

Well, what about the traditional

action that was in existence long before '72 enabling
the Wage and Hour Administrator to sue to enforce practices

7
o£ employers contrary to the Wage and Hour Fair Labor

Standards Act.

How, could he have bright a class action?

QUESTION:

I am surprised frankly that you con­

cede that the civil actions authorized by Congress

to be

brought by the EEOC is analogous in any way to Hunt v.

gant 3 o
MR, DICKENS.

Your Honor, in Hunt that was a

question of standing with regard to a state agency, the
Washington State Apple Commission, and the question Ws
standing, by it as a state agency to bring suit on behalf
of various growers in the state and this -QUESTION:

They were all members of the agency,

were they hot?
MR. DICKENS:

No, Your Honor.

They had some

effect to the extent that they helped select the people
who were on the agency, but it was not a private organi­
sation,
QUESTION:

It was a quasi-public trade agency,

it was ft. trade agency with legislative status-, was it not?
MR. DICKENS:

I don’t deny that, it was and

9
that was part of ths approach but the Court did say, as
four Honor is aware, having written the opinion, that it
was a state agency and there was standing to bring- suit
on behalf of the group.
We are not questioning the standing of the commission to bring suit..

We are saying that the eoKiaission

can bring suit and we are not questioning at this time,
it is not a question as to the scope of what they can. do.
All we are saying la that when the cosaaission brings suit
and .says, well, we will bring it instead of you, charging
party, and we know you would have to comply with it, we
want the same relief, we say they should comply with
Rule 23 also,
QUESTION:

Isn't it up to Congress to decide

that'?
MR. DICKENS:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor, it is.

Congress gave them the right, didn't

they ?
MR. DICKENS:

I a.® not denying they have a

right to sue.
QUESTION:

And did they have to go further?

MR. DICKENS:
QUESTION:

Did they have to go further?

MR. DICKENS:
they were going to -—

Yes. Your Honor, they did.

Yes, Your Honor, they did, if

10
QUESTION:

I said have to.

I didn’t say did or

didn’t»
MR. DICKENS:

No, Your Honors I said they did.

They would have had to go further to exempt the commission
from Rule 23.
QUESTION:

Why?

MR. DICKENS:

Because the general rule is that

the rules apply to all civil actions unless otherwise
exempted or unless clearly superseded by Congress.

Rule

1 bays it applies.
QUESTION:

Clearly superseded by Congress.

MR. DICKENS:

That’s correct, Your Honors
'

QUESTION:

A-

Congress gar® EEOC the right to bring
i

this action on behalf of these people.
MR. DICKENS:
QUESTION:

That’s correct.

And It didn’t say class action.

You

said It should have said pursuant to Rule 23?
MR. DICKENS:
QUESTION:
should rave sa:„d?

No, Your Honor.

Well, what do you think Congress
Or clo you say that Congress should have

said anything, that Congress intended Rule 23 to apply?
MR. DICKENS:

Your Honor, ;C am saying that if

Congress c.Id. not intend Rule 23 to apply, they should
have said so.
QUESTION: Why?

11
MR. DICKENS:

Because that is the general rule.

This Court and Congress have promulgated the federal
rules.

They have said in Rule 1 that ~~
QUESTION;

The Congress did it.

MR. DICKENS:

Yes, Your Honor, and this Court

has authority also under its power in the statute to assist,
too.
QUESTION:

The jurisdiction of this Court as

well as the other federal courts Is determined by guess

who?
MR. DICKENS:

Well, it is determined by the

Constitution, Your Honor.
QUESTION;

Day by day by whom?

MR. DICKEMS;

By this Cour>, Your Honor, and

by Congress,
QUESTION;

I thought Congress had that power.

MR. DICKENS:
QUESTION:

Yee, they do also.

I thought they had the power to de­

cide what jurisdiction this Court hai.
MR. DICKENS:
QUESTION:

Yes, they do.

And they say that the federal courts

shall have jurisdiction over act ions by the EEOC on, behalf

of people, period, and that is what the federal govern­
ment dieo

Now you say you have to add on to that Rule 23«
MR. DICKENS:

Your Honor, I am saying that Rule

23 applies.

They also did not mention —

QUESTION:

Can the average eitisen file a ease

who is a member of the class without making it a class
action?
MRo DICKENS:
QUESTION:

Can he?

MR,, DICKENS:
QUESTION:

If he only seeks —-

Yes .

Well, that is what they are doing.

MR. DICKENS:

Ho, Your Honor, they are not,

they are seeking class relief,, that Is where we have the
problem.

If they only sought relief for the four charg­

ing partias, we have no problem, but they are seeking
class right relief without the following of the general
rule that
QUESTION:

Which they have a right to do undes1

the act.
MR. DICKENS:
agree,

Your Honor, I respectfully dis­

The act doesn't say that.

a right to file the action.

It says that you have

If they file the action,

the private party files the action and want to make it a
class action, Rule 23 applies.
Let me just briefly give the Court a little
flavor for the facts.

We mentioned some of them.

We

had four women employees In the Beaverton, Oregon
facility file charges.

That is one facility cut of 116

13
and that is in one state out of five that General Tele­
phone operates 5„n.
The commission investigated and when it con­
cluded it wanted to file a broad-based action and the
action is as broad as possible.

It mentions no specifics,

no dates, no individuals, and requests injunction, af­
firmative action, it requests that people be made whole
who are adversely affected, and requests back pay..
We are not in this case questioning the scope

of relief that can be granted.

All w© are trying to do

quits frankly is avoid litigating this case now, in the
future, and in the future.

I mild think — there Is no

question that the court out our way doesn’t want to try
the case two or three times.

But if the class is not

bound by any decision that is reached, they can reliti­
gate.
Furthermore, this Court has continued to say,
in talking about Title VII cases, two principles which
we contend are very applicable here.

First of all.,

under Title VII It is the courts that are the final
authority on Title VII and how it is Implemented, and
we agree.

Secondly, this Court said in Rodrigues that

the adherence to Rule 23 Is Indispensable — the require­
ments of Rule 23.
trying to do.

We agree, and that is what we are

How, her© is what we have in this ease, for
example.

1 will give the Court I think a very concrete

example of where in this situation the commission is
making decisions that Congress intended the courts to
sake o
First of alls there is no question that be­
cause you allege something to be a class action, that
does not make it a class action.

We have good class

action allegations and we hare poor class actions..

In

this case, however, the commission has usurped the
authority of the court in the class certification area by,
number one, it said this is a class action.
normally a determination the court makes.

That Is
And number

two, it said the scope of the class is this broad.
How, we contend that those are requirements
that Corgi'ess intended the courts ha- re in making that de­
termination.
QUEST!OH:

Do you contend that in addition to

certification there should be notice to all the class
members?
MR. DXOREMS:

Your Honor, X think that depends

upon the type of class action that is certified, whether
it is —«
QUESTION:

Well, it is one in which they ask

the defendants to make all those persons adversely

15
affected by unlawful employment practices.
ME. DICKENS;

lour Honor5 1 think that notice of

Boae type will have to be given»

Now, whether it is an

opt-»in, opt-out. that depends on how th& court decides
to approach it»

It probably would be an opt-out type

notice that a class action is pending and you may opt out
if you do not desire to be bound*

That is the normal

situation I believe in this case.

But I want to go back

to —
QUESTION:

Hew about sett lenient?

ME. DICKENS;

Settlement, Tour Honor, that is

really a big problem quite frankly.

They say let's

settle arid I aay# well, I can't settle with you, some
good plaintiff’s lawyer is going- to tell me, hey, that's
a great settlement, let's file* a new action on behalf of
these people that settled and —

QUESTION:

Under the government's approach, what

about settlement?
MR. DICKENS:

They are not bound, Your Honor.

The class members aren’t bound*

Me have a settlement,

it doesn't bind the class members.

It binds the employer*

Once again, it is the same thing with a judgment.
bound if we lose, we are bound if we settle.

We are

members* they can either take It or they can go their own

merry my and either bring a separata action or whatever.

16
QUESTION:

Well, what if the EEOC brings an

action against your client simply seeking to enjoin prac­
tices in violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, do
you think they have to bring that as a class action?
HR. DICKENS:

Mo, 1 think there is a distinction

net so Euch under 706 but there can be a distinction, a
■filchatony between injunctive relief prospectively and the
situation where you are seeking individual may call
relief under 706,

It Is in the latter situation, where

you are seeking to give back pay, you are seeking a
seniority spot or 3lot, that Is where 1 believe we should
bind the class.
QUESTION:

But what. If they don’t ask for —

what if they simply ask for an injunction?
MR.. DICKENS:

If they come in and ask for an

injunction, probably they are not binding the class, al­
though if it is under ?C6 I think it should.

Now, 707

appears to be more of a situation where traditionally
broad ranging prospective injunctive relief under a
pattern or practice cases come in, but «—
QUESTION:

Then it is intentional.

MR. DICKENS:
QUESTION:

Pardon?

Then it is required to be intentional,

too, isn’t it?
MR. DICKENS:

Yes.

As the Court is probably

17
aware, it has already heard one Title* VII ease today*
there was a long debate in Congress in 1971 and 572 over
how ;aueh authority to give the commission»

Congress de­

cide i that the provisions under ?05 permitting individuals
to file suit was not working as well as it wanted, so we
had 'ihe two approaches.

We had the cease and desist,

which would have given them an awful lot of authority
similar bo the National Labor Relations Board.

How» in

that case the commission would have received the charge*
they would have investigated the charge, they would have
adjudicated the charge and would have prosecuted the
charge like- the board did.
that.

But Congress didn't go for

They said no, you've got all the regular pro­

cedures »

We are going to b© fair to everybody.

We are

going to be fair to the defendants and the employer is
going to be fair to the parties.
Nows we believe that what tre are requesting is
fully in accord with whait Congress intended in granting
court enforcement' powers to the comm:.usion.
give it unlimited authority.

They didn't

They gave it the same

authority under 706 as the private individuals.
QUESTION:

Mr. Dickens, on just one point«

MR. DICKENS:
QUESTION:

Yes3 sir.

Could it be. that at a later stage

in this proceeding you could raise this same point, this

class action point?

We don’t think that is what the court

intended or what this Court wants to do.

ME*ve gone through the various parts of the
history.

There is no question that the courts are split

ya the natter.

A® I mentioned earlier* we believe that

had. Congress intended to exempt the commission from Rule
23» it would have done so.

It is clear that In the

legislative history Congress made two specific references
and charges in two federal rules.

It made a change in

Rule 53 on special masters to insure that they would be
able to handle these cases.

They male a change in Rule

-o *

Mist you get out of that, you &:»e well aware that

congress knew about the federal rule» and knew how to make
exceptions.

It didn't make a similar exceptions for the

commission under 796 for a class action.
Kow, it did talk about in several cases in the
post history and throughout the committee reports that
the commission is a properly suing party.
you can bring a class action.

Under Rule 23

We have all of that.

do under 706 s it is the same as a private party.

is the same in both cases.

In­

The conciliation

The action is the same as a

private party vrith the possible exception that the stand­
ing is broadened to include other unlawful practices
discovered.

We are not- questioning the standing as such.

The relief is the same as under 796(g) in both of the
situations.
Now, when the private party instead brings the
suit instead of the commission, all absent members of the
class are bound.

There is no dispute on that.

QUESTION:

Mr. Dickens, let me just as you a

little tit about bow you handle the language of Rule 23(a)
that says that one or more members of a class may sue or

20

he sued as representatives of the class*

Is it your

theory that — the EE0Cs of course, is not a member of the
class but is suing on behalf of the charging parties who
are like the representative plaintiffs.

Is that your

theory?
ME. DICKENS:
QUESTION:

That’s correct, four Honor.

If that is true and your charging

parties, say, ere charging sex discrimination, say they
are four female employees who claim there was discrimin­
atio! on account of gender.

Say the commission in its

investigation decided they wanted to broaden the case to
.include some race discrimination charges, could they do
so?
MR. DICKENS:

They could if they discovered

race discrimination charges during their investigation in
addition to sex as part of that investigation under the
lower court decisions.

This Court has never ruled upon

that»
QUESTION:

Then would the charging parties, if

you look at it as the members of the class within the
meaning of the rule as the charging parties, could they
represent the victims of race discrimination when their
charge was based on gender discrimination?
MR. DICKENS:

Your Honor, what we are saying

is this, is that as far as the typicality requirement,

21
the typicality requirement it, coextensive with the stand­
ing which the commission is to bring the suit.

If they

have standing 1;c bring it on behalf of sex, fin®,.

If they

also have standing to bring it on behalf of race, fine.
The question here isn’t the standing,

We recognise there

are cases saying the commission may have broader standing
than the individual ehsirging parties,
that.

We aren't denying

That Is not an issue here.
Whatever they have standing to bring, that de~

termines the typicality.
QUESTION:

But In answer to Mr. Justice Marshall

you in effect said, well, the rules apply unless Congress
says they don *t.
MR. DICKENS;
QUESTION:

That's correct.

But if you Just read the rules, .they

wouldn't cover this double capacity 'rind of suit*
MR. DICKENS:
QUESTION":

No, Your Honor ~~

The rule would really cover maybe a

sex discrimination suit or any kind that would be an apnropriate class for your charging party.

You may have to handle a case somewhat

differently but there is no problem,

not a question.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. WALLACE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it nlease the Court:
Outside of the context of Title VII, no court
has ever held that a suit. by the United States or one of
its agencies to enforce federal law must proceed as a
class action on behalf of the affected members of the
public jven though there are many contexts in which such
sui;s arise, and the contrary practice has been common
pla :e

We reviewed in- some detail in our brief this
Court's decision in Porter v. Warner Holding Company
which involved the rent control legislation ©f the World
War II sra.

Back pay eases are eos»ion under the national

Labor Relations Act: actions to recover on behalf of an

Labor Standards Act.
