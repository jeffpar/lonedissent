MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

Taxes of Vermont.
Mr. Hellerstein, you may proceed whenever you are
.ready.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEROME R. HELLERSTEXN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. HELLERSTEXN:

Thank you, sir.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
This jis an appeal by Mobil Oil Corporation from a
decision of foKe Vermont Supreme Court holding that dividends
t

received play ^fobi 1 from its subsidiaries and affiliates which
operated exclusively in foreign countries and derived virtually
all their income from sources outside the United States, that
such dividends were proparly includable in the apporfcionable
base of. the Vermont tax.

That’s the only issue in the case.

Now, the facts are these:
poration.

Mobil is a New York cor­

Its coi^pdsafe headquarters and commercial domicile

are located in New York Qity.

It is engaged in all aspects of

the petroleum business including exploration, production of
oil and gas, refining, transportation, and sale of petroleum
and petroleum products.
Now, the only activities carried on in Vermont con­
sisted of the wholesale and retail marketing of products.

4
Mobile is subject to taxes measured by net income not only in
the State of Vermont, but in 40 other States, as well as the
District of Columbia»
The company is engaged in both interstate and foreign
commerce»
Now, with respect to these stocks, Mobil owned the
stocks of a large number of corporations, subsidiaries and
affiliates, and as 1 have said, they carried on their business
solely in foreign countries»

These dividends that are here in

issue constituted most of Mobil’s taxable income.

Now, 99 pea:-

cent of the dividends were derived from, received from cor-

J

'

porations that derived all or all except a very insignificant
portion of their income from sources outside the United Statas»
Mobil’s business as the owner of these stocks was in
all respects conducted outside Vermont.
offices outside Vermont.

Managed, directed

The same is true of the dividends.

The receipt of the dividends and the disposition of the divi­
dends, all outside —
QUESTIONS

Mr. Kellerstein —

MR. HELLERSTEINs
QUESTION;

Yes, sir?

How large a tax would Mobil have paid in

Vermont under your theory and under the return that it filed?
MR. HELLERSTEINs

Under the theory we are presenting,

something like $4,000 for the three years.
I'd like to go to that, Your Honor, because the

5

Commissioner has suggested that the tax of $4,000 for this great
multinational company can hardly be a fair representation of
what Mobil ought to pay for the activities carried on in the
state.

Well, 1 think we ought to remember several things. .

The Vermont Legislature imposed an income tax, and when the
Vermont Legislature imposed that income tax it knew perfectly
well that that might result in a loss, even though we have a
lot of property and assets in this state.
The Commissioner, in making this very argument, Mr.
Justice Rehnquist, that you're making, $4,000 for this gar­
gantuan company -QUESTION:

I thought it was a question, rather than

an argument; that I was making.
MR. HELLERSTEXNt

Mo, there’s no question about it.

It's a small amount.
The other point I want to make is, that’s what the
Vermont Legislature decided was a fair payment of the income
tax.

But this isn’t the only tax w© pay in Vermont.

subject; to other taxes;

We’re

Property taxes, sales taxes, highway

ns© taxes, and what-not.

So that the-smallness'of this amount

really reflects the fact that Mobil’s income is earned from
dividends that are all outside Vermont, for all practical pur­
poses.
QUESTIONj

Where are those dividends taxed, other than

fcy the Federal Government?

6

MR, HELLERSTEINs

That raises the question* Were

those dividends taxed by any other state?
QUESTIONS

That isn’t what I asked.

I said where

were they taxed?
MR. HELLERSTEIN:
QUESTION:

Where were they taxed* outside —

MR. HELLERSTEIN:
QUESTION:

Where ware they taxed?

By no state.

In no state.

MR. HELLERSTEIN s

Let me explain why.

They were taxed — the State of New York* which is
the comia ere ial domicilia of Mobil* has a policy of not taxing
dividends from subsidiaries at all.

With respect to non­

subsidiaries, it reverts the tax, takes the percentage of the
tax as to where the income was earned.

So with respect to

these dividends we paid little or no tax.
But now, Your Honor, Mr. Justice BXackmun, that gets
to a key question in the case.
QUESTION:

Let ra® ask another question.

Am I correct,

under the Vermont system is there not a statutory provision
that enables the taxpayer to seek a reallocation in the event
of —
MR. HELLERSTEIN:
QUESTION:

You’re right.

unfairness?

Did Mobil take advantage

of that?
MR. HELLERSTEIN:

We did, and it was denied.

7
Right»

Now, I want to go to the question

Mr.

Justice Blackmun raised, because one of the k@y questions in
the case, when w@ com© to the commerce clause argument, in
which we contend that we ought not, that the apportioned tax
by a state, by Verxaonfc, in which we carry on no aspect of these
operations, that non® of those, no state in which we carry on
our operating functions as distinguished from the iaaaagmesit of
our interest in the stocks,, that non© of those states ought to
fo@ able to apportion that income because you would have a risk
of multiple taxationt either the risk of possible double taxa­
tion as a result of the taxing power of the commercial domicil®
or business situs, if -that was the state, plus the apportioned
tax, or given just the apportionment, the risk of diversity of
taxation.
Mow, let me go first to this question that Mr. Justice
Blackmun has raised.

The doctrine, as Your Honor's will recall,

is well established.

The multiple taxation doctrine clearly, as

developed by its architects, who were Justices Stone, Rutledge,
later extended by other Justices of the Court — there isn’t
any question but that that doctrine depended on the following
proposition, Do other states have the power to tax, regardless
of whether they exercise it?
That's clear.
counsel, say

Everybody recognises that.

However,

subsequent opinions of this Court have modified

fch© doctrine so that the multiple taxation doctrine does not

s
prevent a tax on interstate or foreign commerce unless you
prove you've actually been double-taxed by another state.
First of all, an analysis of the case does not sup­
port the view that that doctrine has been abandoned.

But

authority aside, I want to go to the reasons why it should not
b© abandoned by this Court, and there ere two sets of reasons,
Your Honor:

One ar© pragmatic and on© are matters of constitu­

tional principle.
First as to th© pragmatic objections to the actual
multiple taxation tests

Such a test would foster a competitive

race among state legislatures, and tax departments, too, to b©
the first to tax and the first to assess.

Moreover,

in@qual.i~

i

ties between corporations earning th® same amount of income
within a state would be fostered.

Why?

The taxes could be

different under the actual multiple taxation test because of
different taxes that each ©f them pay in other states.
As a matter of constitutional principle, 1 suggest
that likewise dictates the retention of the power to tax.

What

ar® we dealing with?
QUESTION:

Aire you saying that only New York could

tax these —
MR. HELLERSTEXN:
QUESTION:

Sir?

MR. HELLERSTSIN:

Our contention is this, Your Honor,

that given a situation in which ail the operations of the com­

QUESTION:

Well, you ar© saying, then, that only New

*

MR. HELLERSTEXN:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

Well then ,

doesn't that lead to th© same

sort of competitiveness in order to get the advantage ©f cor­
porate presence and activity in a state, like Delaware used to
have in corporate charters, that the state with th® lowest in­
come tax rate for investment income earned out of the country
is going to b© a haven for corporate domiciles?
MR. HELLERSTSIN:
fundamental difference.

Your Honor, I think there5s a

The Federal Constitution has neve:

interfered with a state's working out their own policies to
attract business, or to make life livable.

That’s a choice

that ©very state has and should have, including th® charting
of its tax policy.
But Mr. Justice Relinquish, it’s very different to

10

say, very different to say on© state's power of tar: is going fco
be increased or decreased because of v?hafc another state does.
Each of the states can ns© its own policy reasons for attract­

ing trade, whether it’s for energy purposes or whether It’s to
make management central.

But that6s the substance of our

Federal constitutional system.

Mr. Heller si.© in, suppose you didn’t have

these subsidiari©®.
MR. HELLERSTEIN:

Right.

And th© incera© flowed in to the taxpayer,

Mobil.
MR. HELLERSTEIN:
QUESTION;

Right.

Would you be hare today?

MR. HBLLERSTEIM;

We would not be here on this case.

The reason I have to say that is, we might h® here on a later
case.

But this likewise gets to ona of the gut problems in

th© case.
The whole pitch, resally, of the argument ©n the other
side is this:

This runs through all their briefs, including

the numerous briefs signed by their and ray side.
They say Mobil and its foreign subsidiaries and the
foreign affiliates from which w© receive dividends, they’re
really all part of one unitary international petroleum busi­
ness.

And so it doesn’t matter that these stocks were not

handled,

no part of th© handling of th© stocks was taken care

11
of in th© State of Vermont»
We can look at th© whole system and we can take into
account the fact that what goes on in the Middle East in the
diggag for oil has some bearing on the international petroleum
business, including let’s say the marketing of oil in Vermont.
That is one of the methods that a state may employ»
some limitations.

You have to avoid distortions.

There are
You have to

But if Vermont had treated Mobil and

its subsidiaries and affiliates as a 'unitary business and had
used what is known as the combined method of reporting, what
would have happened would have been this:
The base of th® tax would be all th® income of all
these companies in the unitary business worldwide.

The appor­

tionment factors, proparties, payroll receipts that determine
the fraction that this state tax is, would be of all those
companies.

In those circumstances we wouldn't have this prob­

lem, but there would ba a different problem as to the propriety
of that.
But that isn’t our-case.

What I sen saying, Mr. Justice

Vermont doesn’t use that combined method.

Vermont uses the separate company method.

Vermont doesn’t

12
treat the companies as a unitary business, else there wouldn't
be any dividends to tax.

That if you are going to treat the

company, Mobil as a separate company, taking into account only
Mobil’s own income and only Mobil's own factors and giving no
credit to the fact that these hundreds of millions of dollars
of dividends were earned entirely outside the state, that the
stocks were managed outside tha state, if you're going to —you can't have apples and oranges.

If you want to tax our dividends, you've got to tax

QUESTION:

You have an interstate commerce clause.

MR. HELLERSTEINs

The due process argument, the rea­

son why we are not arguing that the dividends received, if they
were hare, that dividends received from domestic subsidiaries
could, need not, are not apportionabla, is this;
There is a problem as to whether the Moorman case
precludes that contention.

We would .argue it does pot.

If

you gat to th® commere® clause argument, Mr. Justice White, as
distinguished from the due process argument, and you get to the
commerce clause argument, we've got the problem that Moorman
took the position with respect to domestic commere©, that is
interstate commerce, that the Court maid not intervene in
methods of apportionment.

W© argue it's a jurisdictional

14
problem, due process.

But if that's rejected and you get to

the problem that this is something that involves a right of

apportionment, then Moorman says this Court will not intervene
when interstate commerce is involved.
QUESTION:

But wouldn't this —

MR. HELLERSTBIN:
QUESTION:

I9m sorry, Mr. Justice Rehnquist?

Just following up Justice White's question

isn't it precisely the same clause of the Constitution that
Congress shall have power to regulat® commerce with foreign
nations and among the several States and with the Indian
tribes that you derive your argument from?

So if it's good for

foreign commerc®, it must be good for interstate commerce?
MR. H&ILLERSTE1N :

Except, Justice Rehnquist, you her®

The majority of that Court, what-

ever else you may say about Japan Lin®, in which I am aware
Your Honor dissented, whatever els® you may say about Japan

vis a vis th© foreign commerce clause problem, Mr. Justice
Kbit®, as distinguished from the interstate clause.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. HELLERSTEXN:

Those are two things it established

One, foreign commerce is much more sensitive than domestic
commerce, and the tolerance under owx Constitutional principles

for a certain amount of inequality and difference and double
taxation that's acceptable in domestic commerce, that doesn't

QUESTION:

Is part of your argument here that if

Vermont wants to take in these dividend income, it should in­
clude in all of the assets owned and the property factor, all
of the assets owned by the subsidiaries?
MR. HELLERSTEIN:

It would have to use a totally

different method of taxation, that given this method of taxa­
tion —
QUESTION:

They can't have it both ways?

MR. HELLERSTEIN:

They can't have it both ways.

their tax, Your Honor, has to be judged by what they did.

They

didn't tax us as a combined company on a unitary basis, and
they can't argue here, as most of their briefs argue, that jur­

just isn't the method by which they taxed us.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. King.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD JOHNSTON KING, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR. KING;

Mr. Chief Justice, may it pleas© the Court;

Vermont imposes an annual net income tax on all cor™
porarions doing business in the state.

That tax is measured by

that share of a corporation's federal taxable income which is
apportioned to Vermont by a standard three-factor formula.
Professor H@ll@rst@in suggests that the tax system
adopt®! by the Vermont Legislature necessarily produced the
result that they seek.

I suggest it did not.

They arrived at

20

that result by clearly violating the terms of the Vermont
statute and not using as apportionable net ineam® their federal
s

taxable income, but rather using as apportionable net income
federal taxable income from which they had excluded all income
received in the form of dividends.

,

As Mr. Helleratein suggests, Mobil is a fully inte­
grated petroleum company conducting business in part in Vermont
and in part in other states of the Nation. . The question pre­
sented is whether the due process and commerce clauses of the
'

Constitution required Vermont to exclude dividend income from
apportionable net income.

In view of Mobil's substantial busi­

ness activities in Vermont, 1 suggest that the due process in­
quiry is frivolous.
Mobil had the burden of proving that the dividends
in question were not related to its integrated petroleum busi­
ness, and therefore were not properly includable in apportion­
able net income.
Professor Hellerstein mentions that they did seek
modification of the formula.

That is correct.

The Commissioner

denied modification and that issue has not been appealed to
this Court and the modification issue is not before this Court.I
QUESTIONS

Mr. King, may I just ask you if you would

regard as squally frivolous the position that as a matter of
constitutional due process, the state would h® required t©
exclude the toy business income, if they had a separat® toy

i

21
business in a different state?
MR. KING:

Yes, I would, Your Honor.

QUESTIGN:

You would say that was frivolous, too?

MR. KING?

I would say that was a frivolous question,

'atih&fc Professor Hellerstein proposes there in his answer t© that
question is separate accounting.

Separate accounting is ah al­

ternative to apportionment, but the two are not used in eonjimcj
tion with each other.
QUESTION:

Is he correct in saying that it is custern­

ary for states to segregate out, to permit a taxpayer to
eliminate income from entirely separate aspects of its business
which are allocable to another state, and clearly so?
MR. KING:

That depends on the state statute, Your

QUESTION;

1 realise that, but he said typically

Honor.

states do permit that.

Is that your judgment?

MR. KING:

I think that’s probably correct.

QUESTION:

AM does Vermont do that?

MR. KING:

The Vermont statute would include in the:

apportionable net income all federal taxable income of the
corporation.
QUESTION:

So that would take a contrary position on

MR. KING:

Take a contrary position.

that?
However, Your
i

Honor, the Vermont statute contains a clear provision that if

22
th© apportionment factors apply to all of a taxpayer:-s federal
taxable income do not produc a a result which fairly reflects
th® extent of business activities within the state * thsrs th©
Commissioner is direct-ad to modify.

This is not such a ease.,

Mobil has admitted that the income,, or stockholdings in its
subsidiaries and affiliates, are part of its integrated world­
wide petroleum business.
Whether or not on different facts modification would
be appropriate, I can't tell you.

However, it would depend on

the showing bafor© th© commissioner, much as the question of
multiple taxation depends on the showing before this Court.
QUESTIONs

Well, did Mobil ever claim that if you

wanted to include the dividends you must include the underlying
assets in th© allocation formula?
MR. KING:

Perhaps they claimed it.

But that, Your

Honor, is confusing, two entirely separate-systems of taxation.

Well, excuse me, that could cars® up.

It would also b@ included.

QUESTION;

It would be, wouldn't it?

MR. KING;

It would b© included, yes.

The answer to

th© question of why there is no property factor for the

24
intangible stock is twofold:

On©, this is a tax on net inccsae,

not a tax on the property which produces that income.
that's a critical distinction.

I think

The second point is that his­

torically, and
QUESTION:

Why do.you include any property, why do

you have a property factor?

I mean, non® of this is tax on a

property, but you include some property»
MR. KINS:

The second point is that historically, and

conceptually, intangibles, particularly when they are held by
a corporat© multi-state business, are attributed to those states
in which that corporation does business in the same percentages
as the apportionment factors of those states.

And mathematically

if you exclude the intangible property entirely, it lias no ef­
fect whatsoever on tha apportionment factors, because it's ex­
cluded equally in all of tha states, according to their appor­
tionment factors.

One

hundred, percent.
QUESTION?

And how about separate businesses?

MR. KING:

If it was a separate business, if Mobil

was holding stock in duPont, than no, then it would b@ included„
But Your Honor, the point raised on income from intangibles,'th©
same point can be made with regard to patents, royalties.
Professor Hellerstein has conceded that that is apportionablu
income.

Th© same point can be made with many other property,

tangible or intangible.

Th® income is included and is appor™

tionable.
Mobil has th© burden of proving that these stock­
holdings were not connected with its integrated petroleum
business.

Mobil has not mat this burden.

In fact, the only

proof that Mobil has offered in responsa to this burden are
the statements that the stock certificates are held, managed,
and controlled, and th© dividends ar© received outside Vermont.
This brings up another interesting question, and
that's Professor Hellerstein9s eeasaercitil domicile point.

X

suggest that that question, that' issue, is not properly before
the Court.

There is no evidence in th© record that commercial

I/

26
domicila had anything whatsoever to do with Mobil9s stockhold­
ings, with the stocks themselvas, ©r with the dividends re­
ceived „

Mobil has shifted position somewhat in its reply brief

to say well, it's either commercial domicile or business situs»
There is no business situs which has been identified on the
record.

That leaves a taxpayer with this kind of a record in a

position to go to each state in succession and say, "They’re not
here, can't tax them."
So 1 would suggest that the commercial domicil® argu­
ment is entirely speculative on this record.
As to the fact that Mobil's properties are held, that
Mobil's stockholdings are held, managed, and controlled outside
the state of Vermont, so ar® many of Mobil's other properties,
and the incoma from all of those properties is clearly includ­
able in apportionable net income.

The whole concept of appor­

tionment is to get away from precisely what Mobil is trying to
get us into here, and that is the difficulty of ascertaining
where in an integrated operation profits arise, and to what
particular location those profits are attributable.

That simply

is not a workable system, as 2 think this Court has recognized
long ago, and certainly as any scholar in the field has recog­
nised.
There is nothing in the Constitution which, or in the
decisions of this Court, which would support or imply a prohi­
bition against apportioning among the states income from

27
Intangible property used in an integrated business activity, a
part of which was conducted within the state.
1 mad® a point on dividends a little earlier in con­

nection with a question from Mr. Justice Whit®.

At page A90 of

the consolidated appendix there appears a graphic illustration
of what I said.

In Paragraph 31 there, they report a dividend

paid by a company which, and I quote, “had no gross income dur­
ing the year 1970, the only year her© at issue in-which it
paid dividends to Mobil.®
What's the relationship between the dividends and the
underlying factors?

None whatsoever.

Mobil next argues that because its operating sub­
sidiaries arid affiliates are engaged in foreign commerce, that
there is a prohibition against Mobil including th© dividends
paid on those stocks.

Once, again, a failure to focus on what

the subject of the tax is.

The subject of the tax is th© net

income, and in a very old case. Page v.' Lull, this Coart very
clearly focused on that distinction and said th® nest income is
not, the foreign commerce which produced that inscsu®.

1 think

that is a conceptual point that's exceedingly elementary and
basic to tils issue.

There is no decision of this Court that would deter­
mine th© tax consequences of income in the hands of a taxpayer
on the basis of th® tax attributes of th© payor of that income.

28
la this easgj Mobil is receiving the income from its ■
operating subsidiaries and affiliates, raueh as it wuM receive
income from the sal® of petroleum products, much as it would
receive royalties from the licensing of patents.

Nothing sup­

ports a tax analysis based on the characteristics or th© busi­
ness or the property factors of the payor.
She Court's decision in Japan Lin©* I suggest, therefor® has no application whatsoever to this ease.
As to Mobil’s multiple taxation argument, I b®li©v«s
•She Court clearly said in Moorman that multiple taxation mush
be proved to have in fact occurred.

I would also suggest that

.In tii® context of a tax on apportioned, mat income, th® multiple
taxation concept doesn’t make any sens®, because when you mis
taxes, for example thee® types of tax Mobil argues for in its
commercial domicile argument, is a gross receipts tax.

St says

that all dividends —
QUESTION:

Was the tax imposed in Japan Lins an ad

valorem property tax?
MS. KING:

Yes, it was, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Not an income tax?

MR. KING:

Absolutely.

And the problem of multiple

taxation that was raised in Japan Lin© was simply this:
foreign sovereign had taxed that property.

A

Th© County of Los

Angeles sought, to impose another tax, on that property.

Double

taxation ia fact appeared on th® record, and th© Court, in I

29
think a very sound rations is, said, "Look.

W© do not have th®

power to control the apportionment between a foreign sovereign
and a United States political subdivision."

That's basic.

Here th© foreign commerce multiple taxation argument
•that Mobil makes is that there is a risk that the states will
.impose multiple taxation.

That's a risk over which this Court;

clearly has a controlling power.

This Court, as it has said in

.•several opinions, will correct errors ©f apportionment when they
occur.
Mobil's speculative argument that multiple taxation
could result from diverse state formulae goes right to that
{point.

When it does, the Court clearly is authorised to make a

corrective, or require corrective measure.
Keifch<?sr th® Constitution nor any decision of this
Court grants to the commercial domicil® of a multistat® business
idle power to tax without apportionment income from intangibles
held in connection with that business.

If that issue was ever

properly raised, I suggest that this Court might require appor­
tionment which would fairly allocate to those states in which
business is conducted a share of that income.
not been raised ©a this record.

That ease has

That is, I think, exceedingly

important.
Vermont is a state in which Mobil conducts substantial
business activities, taxed Mobil's net income including divi­
dends from operating subsidiarias and affiliates fairly

30
apportioned to local business activities.

Mobil has conceded

that the apportionment factors were correctly calculated and
fcfe® apportionment formula was correctly applied.

On the record,

the tax imposed was nandisorimlnatory, fairly apportioned to
reflect Mobil’s substantial business activities in Vermont, and
fairly related to fch© services provided by Vermont.

Mobil has

failed to meet its burden of proving that its stockholdings in
operating subsidiaries and affiliates were unconnected with
its integrated petroleum business, a part of which was carried
on in Vermont.

In fact, Mobil has basically conceded that,

point.
Mobil has also failed to meet its burden of proving
that its dividends could be subjected to multiple taxation if
included in the Vermont tax base.
Accordingly, under the decisions of this Court, par­
ticularly the Moorman, or most recently the Moorman decision,
the decision of the Vermont Supreme Court should fe® upheld.
Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM D. DEXTER, ESQ.,
AS AMICI CURIAE
MR. DEXTERs

Mr. Chief Justice, may it pleas® the

Court:
Now, th® basic isstse in this case is whether certain
»

income from intangible property, namely dividends, can be

31
included in a state's net income tax base subject to apportion­
ment when the taxpayer has mad© no showing that the intangibles
wer© not acquired and held as an integral part of its unitary,
multi-state business.
Nos£, Mobil would lead this Court to believe that there
is scaae constitutional requirement in both the due process and
-

commerce clauses of the United States Constitution that exI

pressly prohibits states in which that business is conducted
from including such income in apporfcionab1e income for state
income tax purposes.
Now, Mobil initially argues that the state in which
a multi-state taxpayer maintains its commercial domicils has
fch® exclusive power to subject such income to a net income tax.
Mow, no decision of this Court supports such an arbitrary rule.
In fact, all of 'the apportionment decisions of this Court, net.
worth cases, income tax cases, ad valorem, utility, property
tax cases, refuta this idea.
How, recognising the weakness of th® commercial
domicil® fiction, and we must remember it is a legal fiction,
Mobil has changed this argument to include tbs states of either
the commercial domicils or business situs of intangible prop­
erties.

Mow, let us examine this fictional situs theory in

the context of state income tax laws..
First ms must realize that intangibles by their very
nature have no fixed location ©r situs.

This Court was well

3: 3'

32
•aware of that in many domicilary cases and particularly in the
cas® of Curry v. McCanless* and noted that the bundle of bene­
fits and interests represented by intangible properties could
be spread over many jurisdictions and that any jurisdiction
had tha power to tax Intangibles if those jurisdictions con­
ferred benefits and privileges in regard to the ownership of
such intangibles.

QUESTIONS
MR. DEXTER:
QUESTION:

Mr. Dexter?
Yes?
You ar© emphasising th© intangible point

very properly, of course, because that's this kind of case.
Would you distinguish ray hypothetical case of a toy businssss or
something els© that is a separate operating business with ac­
tual tangible assets* but identifiable in a state other than
the taxing state?
MR. DEXTER:

Well* Your Honor* basically th© position

33

of the states is, «md I think in conforming with the decisions
of this Court, that all of the unitary income of a unitary
business is subject to a reasonable rule of apportionment.
QUESTION;
MR. D.EXTER;

My hypothesis is that it's not unitary.
Okay.

Your hypothesis is that it's not

unitary;Under the commission regulations you would treat those
as two separate distinct trades or businesses and you would tar
them accordingly.
QUESTION;

Well, I understand that's the practice.

My question is, as a matter of constitutional law, would you
say that the argument that that is, there is a due process ob­
jection to taking that out-of-state income —
MR. DEXTER;
QUESTION;
tutional law.

Well, it seems to me that ~~
You draw distinction in terras of consti­

I know what the practice is.

MR. DEXTER;

Okay.

The question is — this is on® of

the fundamental questions in this case — the bottom line is
the apportionment result.

What income has the state attributed

to it by the application of an apportionment formula to a tas:
base?
QUESTION:

Well, I don't understand that you've

answered ray question.
MR. DEXTER;
QUESTION:

Well —
My question is, is there a constitution­

al — you say there is no constitutional objection to treating

i

34
intangible incane as being earned .in Vermont because you can't,
really place intangibles ansi it's pirt-vof the overall business
always.
My

question is?

Assuming you have income from

tangible assets which is clearly identifiable to another state
and it's not in the unitary, in the sense we've used it in the
past, part of the unitary business operated in Vermont.

Is

there a valid constitutional objection to Vermont taxing that
income?
MR. DEXTERs
QUESTION%
MR. DEXTEIis
you understand.

My answer would be yes.

*

Then there is a valid.
But here that is not the circumstance,

We're talking about an intangible property

integrated with Mobil as a single entity, unitary trad® or business.

It has nothing to do with combined reporting.

Wo

are saying that Vermont has a right to reasonably apportion
that part of Mobil's total income from its overall operations
by a reasonable attribution rule.

And that Mobil has the bur­

den of establishing that an apportionment result so applied is
violative of due process, because it taxes extraterritorial
values or income or violates the commerce clause on basically
the same ground.
QUESTIONS

But Mr, Dexter, how do you answer Mr.

Justice White's question that if you want to throw the income
into the pot, you must also throw the assets in?

!

35
MR, DEXTER:

Well, okay.

The rationales of an appor-

|

fcionment formula is the three-factor formula that income of a
corporation, regardless of what is the nature of the property
that generates this income, is attributable to where its tan­
gible property, payrolls, and sales are attributed.

How, in­

tangibles by their very nature don't haw a fixed situs.

So

that conceptualXy they may be spread over the business wherever
it is conducted.
How, that's basically what this Court did in the
Adams .Express case.

§15 million of intangibles, stocks and

bonds, $5 million of tangible property, the question is, what
is the value of this tangible property, going concern value, in'
the tasting state.

And this Court said it was an apportionment

:

of the entire intangible value on the basis of -the physical
location of the underlying property.
And it seems to me that you have to do this because
'

of the elusive natura of intangibles.

And really what Mobil

and COST and NAM are saying her®, because of that elusive na­
ture, they can know that it represents a tax ercesaptioft to apply;
legal fictions, or elusive concepts like business situs.

MR. DEXTER;

The denominator would be total property,

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT — REBUTTAL
MR. HELLERSTEIN:

Ur. Chief Justice, on© of the
i

cardinal principles, on© of the pillars of the argument of the
other side in effect is this?
If you are dealing with apportionment, everything
goes.

But you don5t have to have a due process connection.

Between th© items included in the apporfciorsafol© base and the
state, that5s just not so.

Th® casas are to the contrary.

The

cases have established the requirement that because a class of
\

income, for example, goes into a base of the 'case, typically,
that8s going to increase the tax attributable to the state.
Not always, but typically so.
Nov?, it!s for that reason that th© courts hava held
throughout that there has to b© a connection between th® types
of income that are included and th© taxing state.
!

Mr. Hellerstain, what about including in

th© denominator th® value of the shares owned in the
MR. HELLERSTEIN:

Of course, your answer — it*s a

really very simple proposition.

stocks and bonds, the Court said they’re to b@ included in th©

We8'/© got a totally different kind of situation.
W©8v© got an inconi® tax and we 've shown that in fch© earning of
this income, absolutely nothing feak©s place in the State of
Vermont.

So there5s not the slighest basis for thsir taxing

us.
Mow, I do want to press another point, and that isr
there really is an important difference between dividends and
operating income for purposes of how the states divide income.
Th® history of apportionment by formula is this:
Take the typical case.

You’ve got a company manufacturing In

on® state, manufactures goods in one state and sells in another.
We’ve never bean able to work out any accounting method to
determine how does th© net income, which comes final st@p on
the sale of the sho©s or whatever you manufacture, how do you
determine what the legitimate claim of each.of those states
that are part of this integrated operation, how do you divide
it up among them?
The accountants failed us.

And so we developed what

is admittedly a rough and crudes approximation, but the bast
thing w® know.

We said, "Wer 11 use a fomulary method and

of in the history of this Court which have considered that
question, the question, I take it, is this:

Supposes you have

a corporation organize! in Delaware and it has the usual
statutory office in Delaware but it really does business in
Now York, and New York is the commercial domicile.

Under this

commercial domicile rules, does that deprive the State of
«

Delaware of the power to impose this tax?
The only casas I know, Your Honor, ar© the old Cream
of Wheat case, I think, in the capital stock tax area which
seemed to suggest that the state of corporate domicil®, be­
cause it incorporated the company, might not be deprived of
its power to include all the intangibles, all the assets in
its bass.

Subsequent opinions of this Court indicated that’s

open to doubt.
I don't know how the Court would decide that.

that the commercial domicile becoming the real seat of the

that both would have the power to tax in that case.
