P R O C E EDIK G S
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments firs*,

this morning in Ferri against Ackerman.
Mr. Eula, you may proceed whenever you are ready,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JULIAN N. EULE, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER '
MR. EULE a

Mr. Chief Justice and may it Please the

Court s
This case should never have coma before the United
States Supreme Court,

At its inception, it involved no more than

a state common-law malpractice action commenced In a state court
involving two private parties, an attorney and his client.
Because, however, the attorney recsived compensation
for his services under the Criminal Justice Act, the Pennsylvania
State Courts concluded that federal common law afforded him abso­
lute immunity from such a stata causa of action.
It is Petitioner's contention that this erroneous
invocation of federal law is all that has necessitated review by
this Court.
Two obviously related and often intertwined questions
are presented by this case.
First, does federal common lew have any rightful placa
in a. state lav; action for malpractice commenced by an individual
against a private attorney in a state court who was appointed to
represent him in a federal criminal proceedings under the

4

Criminal Justice Act?
Second, if, in fact, Federal Common law is applicable,
what is khe nature of that Federal Common Law?
Is tile immunity that tills Court has afforded to judges
and prosecutors equally applicable to the office of Courtappointed counsel?.
Francis Rick Ferri, Petitioner herein, was indicted by
a Federal Grand Jury sitting in the Western District of Pennsylvania.
He was charged with violation of both the United States Criminal
Code and the .internal Revenue Code but because he was an indigent,
counsel was appointed to represent him,

;■ >'

Mr, Daniel Ackerman, the Respondent heroin';- was
appointed to represent Mg. Ferri in this criminal'' proceeding.
Although the three-year statute of limitations on the • ‘
Internal Revenue Code counts had fun by the time the. indictment
wa$> file. , .Mr* Ackerman at no time moved to dismiss the indictment
nor in any other Way raised the statute of limitations defense,
Mr, Ferri was convicted and sentenced to 20 years on
fch® counts under th® Criminal Cod© and 10 years to run consecutive
to the ’Criminal Cods counts on the Internal Revenue Cod© counts.
On appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for
the Third Circuit, Mr, Ferri, who was by this time represented by
new counsel, did raise the statute of limitations issue.

The

Third Circuit, in a judgment order, concluded that the Statuta of
Limitations had bean waived by its failure to have been raised, at

5

trial.

It is this failure to raise th® Statute of Limitations
defense that constitutes th© thrust of Mr» Ferrl*s present mal­
practice issue, malpractice common™law action that he instituted
in the Pennsylvania courts.
Pennsylvania courts dismissed the suit cn th© ground •
that Federal Common Lav? provided an absolute right of immunity
against suits.

Th© Pennsylvania Supreme' Court concluded first of

all that they were required by this Court*a decision in' Howard
versus Lyons to apply federal 1?®? to the question of potential
liability her© -and second of ©II# that th© Federal Common Law
Rule of Immunity that has applied to judges, federal judges under
Bradley versus Fisher and federal prosecutors under Yaselli versus
Goff applied with equal force to court-appointed counsel.
Petitioner 'submits that they were wrong on both
aspects of this case on their decision to invoke Federal Comam
Law and second, in their ascertaining what, in fact# that Federal
Common Law was.
QUESTION*

If we should agree with you cn the first

premise, that bhay were wrong in believing that Federal Common
Law was applicable# X suppose the appropriate action on the part
of 'this Court would than be to remand the case to the Pennsylvania
courts for them to decide it under stata 1®-?# would it not?
HR* EULE*

Yes, that is what th® Petitioner seeks and

I think that is what — even if th® Court decides the question on

6

the second issue and concludes that there is Federal Common Law
but that Federal Conation Law doss not afford immunity# 1 think that
the question of state law and whether state law affords immunity
will b© open nevertheless»
QUESTIONs

Well# if we agree with the Pennsylvania

courts that federal Common Law is what is governing here# than wa
would proceed to decide- whether or not we agree with them as to
what the Federal Common Law Is.
MR. EULE*

The Pennsylvania rule, if it is a state

MR. EULEs

No, it definitely would not.

is say ergumsnt that the decisions in th® 1383 actions, many of
which have bean dismissed for want of color of law, are entirely
consistent with ray position that 'this is not a federal office and

lar case»
QUESTION:

What would you say if this involved an

1 do think, not insofar as the

immunity question but certainly insofar as whether that person

More

mad© because the trappings of office are present in that particu­
lar- case.
QUESTION*

Well, in that case 1st us assum® that tbs

public defender, an employee ©£ the United States, did such a
bad job of representing the defendant who was convicted that his
conviction was reversed because of «« that he had inadequate
counsel.

It was so bad that a conviction was reversed, that th©

dant sued the counsel who had b©@n representing him for — to re*»

What would you say then?

Would not that b@ a federal

issue than?
.■Ii'!. EULS*

Well, X think that in that particular type

of case if it was under Bivens or if it was against the United
States* Government under the Federal Court Claims Act, certainly
more of an argument could be made that tear© was a color of law
provision.

No circuit has yet decided that question.

QUESTION s

»

Under our cases under th© Federal Tort
♦

Claims Act, is it not reasonably clear that if it is a federal
functien, it is a discretionary federal function, it would be exempt
from any liability on the government as distinguished from the
individual*
MR, EULEs

Well, Your Honors, I think that what took

place in this particular case is not a question of discretionary
judgment.

I 'think failure to know th® Statute of Limitations «•*QUESTIONs

Oh, no, no, I did not ns® discretion in

that sense; discretion in the sense that it is used, a discretionary
governmental function in the sens©, that is used under the Federal
Tort Claims Act and under our cases relating to that Act and I
am only speaking to the liability of th© government, not. the
liability of th© individual,
MTU EULEs

Perhaps there would be no liability to the

government under the Federal Tort Claims Act but not, I think, on
the ground that that individual was not an employee.

The casas

dealing with private court-appointed attorneys have been decided
on the ground that that individual is not even an. employee who
falls within the Federal Tort Claims Act*
The 1983 actions

similar against court-appointed

counsel have almost uniformly been dismissed for want of color
of law.

Th© courts, at least the lower courts, have treated 'th©

public defenders somewhat differently.

12

My contention is'that on the question of immunity,
while there are different considerations# I think one of the most
important different considerations that are involved is that a
public defender is prohibited from the private practice of law.
That is# 100 per cant of all hie casas would ha appointed casas.
The private court-appointed lawyer appointed under the
Criminal Justice Act is not so prohibited.

Indeed, most of thaw,

do have a substantial portion of their practice in the privateretained domain.

I think that —

If I could change that a little bit,

could Congress by statute grant absolute immunity to a Criminal
t

Justice Act-appointed counsel and public defenders and do so
consistently with the Constitution# in your view?
MR. HOLE*
possibly.

Your Honora, I believe that it might fco

In that particular case X think a very different

constitutional problem would be raised that is raised by this

empirical finding of the interest of the Federal Government and
the danger that it posed to the representation of indigents to
have potential liability,

I think tli® scrutiny of a common-law action ought to
be greater than that when we deal with — when this Court deals
with Congressional legislation,
QUESTIONs

Let’s back that up with another hypothetical.

Suppose the judge who made the appointment was guilty of such
gross negligence in appointing an obviously incompetent person,
Would there be any liability on the judge?

Or would

X think h© would have absolute immunity.

I think certainly a state judge under Stump versus Sparjugan,
Pierson versus Ray

and the federal; judges as well, I think that

;

there would be no difficulty with that questioni as well with the
prosecutor. ' I think the prosecutor would be in the same position
as the judge.
There is a vary differant situation presented here,
not only because an individual is much more clearly not only an
officer of the government but indeed, represents the government.
But I think policy-wise there is a vary different
situation that the judge or the prosecutor is in than the court»*
appointed counsel.

The judge and the prosecutor owe their duty

to the public, not to the specific individual.

Their overriding

duty is to the public and very often they may have to act and
indeed, do act in ways that are not in the best interest of that

particular individual because their duty is to act in the beat
interest of the public,
%

When we deal with court-appointed counsel we deal
v/ith a parson who owes his primary duty to the client.

Therefore,

if not the sole, certainly the primary duty is owed does not create
the potential conflict that subjecting a judge or a prosecutor

QUESTIONS

It is your position, than, that PenneyIv&nia

could go either way as to immunity in this case as a matter of
state law.
MR. EULE:

That is correct, Your Honor.

I do not

know hew Pennsylvania will go in that particular case and I be­
lieve it is possible that they will go either way,
I should like to call to Your Honors* attention, al­
though it is certainly not binding on the Pennsylvania Supreme
Court, that neither counsel in that cas© has argued for absolute
immunity.

They have only argued for qualified immunity in that

particular case.

Certainly the Pennsylvania Supreme Court is not

bound by. that decision and they may conclude that there is abso­
lute immunity but in any event, it is somewhat distinguishable on
its facts from this particular case- and may not govern in any
event in that that is a civil proceeding and not a criminal pro­
ceeding that is involved.
There is a public defender who has represented an
individual in a civil commitment action.
QUESTION:

Mr. Eule, as & matter of Pennsylvania law,

what sort of immunity does a judge and & prosecutor gat?
MR, EULE*

Absolutely the same, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Do you think that there would be a

difference between the responsibility of the counsel in a civil
cas© and a criminal case?

19

MR. EULE %

Yea, Your Honor.

1 think that wh rsn you

deal with the individual's right, the individual has a constitu­
tional right to b@ represented by counsel in the criminal action
and so we are dealing with more than a right that is afforded a-;?
a matter of —
QUESTION s

That is a federal right,

MR, EULE:

That is correct.

It is a federal right

but it also applies in state proceedings aa well.

But that right

may distinguish a civil commitment proceedings in that the problem
which is faced when one deals "with civil proceedings is that very
often what on© has is all volunteers, individuals who take pro
bonp cases.
Now, that would not he the case, certainly, in a
federal* criminal action unless that individual wished to take it
without the compensation offered by the Criminal. Justice Act.
Whether volunteers would- create a different- situation
or not / it certainly would not be & matter of federal law if an
individual volunteered

to represent

0

person'in a particular

action.
QUESTION:

Wall, supposing you are counsel for a

defendant who is convicted in a federal court and you are suing
fch® lawyer who represented him in the federal court and you are
suing him under state law just like in this action and he raises
a defense of immunity under state law.

1 take it you would not

move to strike that defense as wholly improper.

No# indeed# I would think that under Erie

ar© suing him in state court.
MR» EULE:

Than certainly the state creating immunity

to a cause of action it itself has created would create no problems
insofar as the choice of law problem.
The individual who is bringing the actlcn here# is
bringing an action against an individual who owes him a duty#
owes him the duty of effective representation.
earlier# this distinguishes the judge.

As 3. indicated

It distinguishes the

prosecutor# those individuals.
Tills Court’s grant of immunity to those individuals
has been precisely because the Court did not wish tc creato the
conflict between on the one hand the duty imposed by law# the
duty to the public and the public interest and on the other hand#
the duty to the particular individual or at least the fear that the
particular individual before him will subsequently sue him for
malpractice or potential liability.
QUESTION s

Is it. your position

. you do not really

contend that neither the prosecutor nor the judge-owes the dafen™
dant in n criminal trial any duty at all?

You do not contend that#

.

do you?
MR. EULEs

No# I do not contend that but I do contend

that the problem is that there is a conflicting duty there and

2:,

that the judge's public duty is to decide in tha best interests
of the public.
QUESTION?

Well# there are sciae constraints on counsel

representing a client# too.
MR. EULEs

Wall# there certainly are with regard to

the disciplinary rules that govern his conduct.

Incidentally# one

of those disciplinary rules is tha rule that an attorney may not
contract with his client to provide immunity front suit.
In any event# the suit against the counsel would#
however# be with regard to a duty that was primarily owed to the
client and tha conflict between tha self-»preservation, instinct
which this Court has recognised in those immunity cases and the
duty that is imposed would not be present because hi* re they would
coalesce.

That is# tha self-preservation instinct would be pro­

tected in the very same way that the performance of tha duty
imposad- by law would be protected.

‘

This Court# I think 'that it is the case that Z find
most clearly on point# in Hire® versus DcKalb County# concluded
that in a state cause of action# in a state court# between two
private parties, oven where tha Federal Government had provided ,
.

%

\

compensation which had# in fact# in that case created the duty*—
the duty to provide for safety in the Mires case# 'this Court
concluded unanimously that there was no need for federal law to
apply*
The analogy# I think# is quite clear,

We have a

22

contractual arrangement.

The government is providing funds.

The

recipient of the funds has not performed the duty imposed upon him
when those fluids war® granted and the individual# whether he is
suing as an implied beneficiary of that contract or suing instead
in malpractice# which is in itself a combination of a tort action
and a malpractice action# the potential liability of that irdivi*

dual# even though they are a recipient cf federal funds# should
foe a matter of state law.
Wa contend# however# not only that it should be a
matter of state law but that# in fact, if federal law is found to
be applicable# that that federal interest here would net bs an
interest in Immunity but would be in accountability.

Immunity is

Not only are -the

policy reasons clearly against it but this Court ought to be
concerned with the appearance of justice as well, the appearance
of treating the indigent, who is unable to afford his attorney,
differently than it treats an individual who can retain attorneys;
the mi's'.rust that exists between lawyers, court*” appointed lawyers
and the indigent is hardly likely to be helped by the absolute
grant of immunity on the part of the Federal Government,
Kt this point in time, it seems to me, an unwise
thing for -- in view of the cynical attitudes that have developed
around the legal profession in general ~ that a different rule
should be established with regard to lawyers than has been
established with regard to doctors.

MR, EULEt

No, that, is certainly not a case from this

Th© physicians who do work for th© Federal Government,

that i&, Veteran’s Administration physicians, public health
physicians and Armed Forces physicians, Congress has legislated
as to all three of those and Congress has•created an exclusive
remedy against the United States Government and has in turn
afforded immunity of sorts to those physicians in return for
creating th® absolute or exclusive' right of action under the
Federal Court Claims Act and Connecticut has adopted a similar
approach with regard to public defenders and court-appointed

25

attorneys„
The Connecticut Supreme Court held that there was
potential liability on the part of public defenders and that there
was no immunity as a matter of state law,
Connecticut legislature has subsequently passed the
statute and that statute has created an exclusive right of action
against feh© state in ratum for immunity,

Mr. Chief Justice and 'May it Pleas® th©

Courti
The issue in this case is not whether immunity would
best serve the,; private interests of an indigent defendant or
whether immunity would bast serve 'the private interests of a
court-appointed attorney but rather whether the Doctrine of
Immunity would best serve the public interest, particularly in
insuring the proper function of the criminal justice system.
Wo contend that the considerations found determinative
in this Court's prior decisions ar© fully applicable to this case.
These include the fact that the threat of litigation may influence
the manner in which th© person involved performs hie duty.
The fact of litigation will inflict harassment upon
such persons so as to deflect their energies from the duties which

26

they ar© obliged to perform in order to analyse and meat the
chargee with which they will be faced.
The threat of litigation would make service in an
already-burdened system less attractive and make it more difficult

QOESTIGMs

Let raa give you a hypothetical.

Suppose

after the defendant was convicted the defendant brought suit for
malpractice saying that the defense counsel told him there was no
chance of an acquittal unless he testified, that that was the
considered judgment of defense counsel.
And so the defendant decided to testify and then was
exposed, of course, to the usual cross-examination and now his
claim is cn one thing only, namely, that that was bad advice, that
exposed him to the conviction and brought about the conviction.
That would be grounds for a malpractice suit, would
it nofe?
MB,. ARNESSs
QUESTION*
MR, ARNESS 3

Yes, Your Honor, it would.
Under a holding of liability,
If malpractice suits are tc be per­

mitted, any grounds which would smack of a counsel giving improper
advlca would b© grounds for that action as a matter of law.
Now, you would have to prove it, of coiirse, under
the standards*
QUESTION*

Or if the defense counsel decided not to

oxoss-e:-arsine a prosecution witness, that might be a basis for a
malpractice suit, too.
MR. ARNESS*
QUESTION*

»
Yes, Your Honor,
Is not that true today?

Is it not true

that despite this case that if it is paid counsel that is possible?
MR. ARNES S s

Yes, it is, Your Honor,

The difference is -

30

QUESTIONt

In all this hypothetical# if it is paid

counsal- you can try them for malpractice.

MR. ARNESSs

Yes, Your Honor.

Thera are two important

distinctions., however? the paid counsel does not have an involun­
tary relationship where the threat of litigation is as real as it
is in an involuntary relationship etch

m

court-appointed counsel

has.
Secondly, the private attorney is not performing a
governmental function,
Now, it is because this Court in Johnson versus
Eerbat and in Gideon versus ffainwright

and then Congress has

enacted the Civil Criminal Justice Act — has mad® this function
a governmental function.
QUESTION*

Way is not the privately'-paid counsel

performing a governmental function?

Ha is performing it because

the court lias said the Constitution requires that there be counsel.
MR. ARNESS ?,
QUESTION*
MR, ARNESS:

Yes , Your Honor.
Is that not so?
I think my answer would be, Your Honor,

that court har. ...ale! that that is a constitutional right.
Congress could have said, in the Criminal Justice Act
that all people, regardless of means, are entitled
appointsd counsel.

Congress did not*

to

free

Congress choss to implement

the decision of this Court by depriving, people ©f means of that

yy

benefit and giving it only to people# who oan show that they

31

cannot afford it.

That Is a legislative decision .

QUESTIONS

But the root of the matter, the root of

fcha mattor, that is, the requirement of the presence of counsel
stems from the Constitution in both cases, does it not?
MR, ARNESS%

It does, Your Honor.

Yes, it doss and

Respondent would be perfectly happy for the purpose of this policy
argument to have it apply across the board,

Howevos, we maintain

that it. is fch® performance of a governmental function that dis­
tinguishes 'this case from others that that is -the critical area.
Both public defenders and privat® attorneys appointee
under the Criminal Justice Act are performing a governmental
function as the Criminal Justice Act intended they perform it.

Now, this Court in its wisdom left to Congress the

It would be the earn© right tc immunity if

you were appointed by a local bar association pursuant to some
committee procedure or something like that and everybody worked

MR. ARNESS i

The federal court is involved because

this attorney was appointed under the Federal Criminal Justice
Act in performing a federal governmental function.

Now, X would

think the public policy applicable would be equally applicable
to a state lawyer.
QUESTION?

Wall, no but supposing instead of being

appointed under the Federal Criminal Justice Act the Philadelphia
Bar Association where they had a committee that young lawyers did
this on a volunteer basis and they appointed such a lawyer to
defend the defendant in a criminal case, would such .a lawyer ba
entitled to the immunity under the. rule that you airs advocating

Yea.

MR. ARNESSs

We have going for us the public policy

considerations which tills Court has paid attention to in every
case of this kind that has been before the Court.

We contend that

they are identically applicable to this case plus we have this
Court’s decision in the Criminal Justice Act making this particular
function a. federal governmental function and that is why it
would fca incongruous, Your Honors, to have 50 statas deciding, on
their own, under state constitutions «—

MR. ASSESS*
QUESTIONS

That is correct, Your Honor.

Yes.

Mr. Arnes3, I take it from the briefs that

neither you nor your opponents think that Barr against Matfceo has
any bearing in the casa.
MR. ARNES3i

Am 1 correct in that understanding?
W© think Barr against Mafcfceo has bean

superceded by this Court's decision in 1 mbler_versus» Paohfcxsan and
in Buts versus Econoraou, Your Honor,
QUESTIONs

By ''superceded,*5 you mean overruled?

MR. ARNESS3

No, Your Honor, certain parts of Barr

versus Matteo, w© contend, are still good law in problems that do
not arise to th© dignity of constitutional rights, for instance*
In ordinary questions we think Barr versus Matfceo has 3t5.ll
standing under the Constitution and there should be absolute
immunity.

QUESTION s

I think your big problem is that federal

law controls and that Pennsylvania law has. not got anything to do
with it.
MR. ARNESSs

Your Honor, yes.

Your Honor, that

36

certainly is the thrust of Petitioner’s argument here.

However,

we think there can be no question about the applicability of
federal standards because it is the administration of a federal
statute and a federal governmental function that is involved here.
QUESTION s

What about a case where a defendant chooses

to exercise the constitutional right that the Feretta case
accorded him and decides to represent himself and the court
appoints stand-by counsel?

Is that stand-by counsel immune from

later suit by the defendant who ©looted to go jpro sc?
MR. ARNESS %

If h® is performing a governmental

function and he stays within the scope of that governmental
function, Your Honor, we respectfully submit that he has absoluta
immunity.
QUESTIONt

And do you think that he is performing a

governmental function?
MR. ARMESSz

If he is appointed under the Criminal

Justice Act to perform that service that indigents ere constitu­
tionally entitled to, yes, Your Honor.
QUESTION»

Well, but are they constitutionally en­

titled under Ferratfca to have stand-by counsel?
MR. AHNESSs

Well, I think the reason stand-by counsel

is appointed, Your Honor, is to provide, ©van when the defendant
does net want to have soma semblance ©£ effective assistance of
counsel and that is a constitutions! right.
QUESTIONS

Well, 1st us suppose that a federal

37

defendant Is convicted and ha claims that his constitutional rights
were violated by the inadequate performance of his counsel and
his conviction is affirmed, his claim is rejected because in that
court the standard for performance ia a mockery or a farce.

la

that still a standard in the Third District?
MR. ARNESS s
QUESTION t
MR. ARNESSi

No, it is not.
What is it?
It is not, Your Honor,

As a matter of

fact standing ia everywhere.
QUESTIONS

Well, let’s just assum® that the standard

in the federal courts is fare® or mockery and that the lawyer’s
performance was within that.

Than the defendant whe was convicted

turns around and sues tinder state law and he says, well, it may
be that you satisfied your obligations under the Federal Constitu**
tion but the state is entitled fco require you, to hold you to a
higher standard, namely, just negligence.

And you war© negligent.

Now, you ar@ saying that ha has no right to go into
state court to make that sort of a claim.
MR. ARNESS*

I am not saying that, Your Honor.

I am

saying t~at if he goes into a state court and it is shown that ha
was performing a federal governmental function, his rights are to
be governed by the public policy attendant to that which gives
him immunity,
QUESTION*

Wall, you are saying that he would have an

immunit/ defense to any stats law claim.

MR, AHMESS g
QUESTIONS
MR, AHNESS s

Yas, Your Honor.

Yes.

And that the state is not —
Because he — the liability he is being

charged with aros© during the course of his performance of s
federal governmental function.
QUESTION:

What possible reason *»- what are tha

reasons for affording immunity?
MR, ARNESS s
QUESTION?

Absolut® or qualified?

Your Honor ~
The reason is that you do not want to deter*

by a fear of liability* any of the performance of tha officer's
duty.

Now, a prosecutor, you want him to be fearless.
MR, ARNESSs
QUESTION?

That ie on© of the reasons.

The other —

New, just apply that to a defense counsel.

Now, how could h© possibly be deferred from .doing anything by fear
of liability?
MR. ARNESSs

Well, Your Honor, one of the ready things

that comas to mind is, if his involuntary client insists that he «»
QUESTION:
MR, AHNESSi

It is not involuntary*
Ycur Honor, ha voluntarily becomes a

Criminal Justice Act attorney but once he becomes on that list
then he gats an appointment.

H© doesn't choose it and the indi»

gent defendant dess not shoos® him,

Thar© is an involuntary

relationship created by the very essence of the Act,
QUESTION*

Now, wait a minute.

Did you say that if

he went to tha judge and said, “I just can't handle this," he

39

could not gat out?
MR, ARNESSs

Your Honor, fcha standards do not permit

him to gat out just hecans® he does not like the situation.
is correct.

That

And the standards of getting out or substituting or

withdrawing are very difficult.
QUESTION:

Nevertheless hs has held himself out as

being a competent lawyer, competent enough to represent defendants
in criminal casas by volunteering,
MR, ARNESS:
out to be competant,

That is correct.

That is correct,

He has held himself

Any lawyer who is admitted

to the bar and practices hold® himself out to be competent in the
things ha undertakes but the question is whether there is an in­
voluntary relationship created so as to distinguish that situation
from the situation that confronts privately»*retained attorneys.
QUESTION:

All right, well, go ahead, tell me why he

is entitled to immunity; what would ha be deterred from doing if
he did not have immunity?
MR, ARNESSsv.There are three reasons.

His judgment

would necessarily bo affected, Your Honor, because if he thought
that a certain ferial tactic was in th@ bast interest of his client
and hie client insisted on something ©Ise, then he is put in an
untenable position of either acceding to the client's request or
subjecting himself to a malpractice action,
QUESTION*
MR. ARNESS s

Let us put it on a concrete —
This would have a dampening effect on

40

his representation.
QUESTIONs

Well, how does that differ from hired

counsel?
MR. ARNESS:

Hired counsel, because of the voluntary

relationship and particularly the right of choice, is chosen be­
cause the defendant thinks their judgment is worth having and
they are paying for it and they ar© more prone to fellow it and
be satisfied with it.
On© of the first and essential requirements of handling
a criminal case is to have the lawyer in charge so that he can do
the best job for his client.

Now, that you can insist, on in a

private relationship.
That is almost impossible in an involuntary relation­
ship and that is on© of the major reasons why that the public
policy demands ‘that court-appointed counsel be given immunity.
QUESTION *

So that he might b© tempted to follow his

client's requests and orders when, if h® were hired counsel, he
would not?
■ MR. ARNESS3

Yes, Your Honor,

Every court that has

considered this problem, that w© know of, has stated that to be the
case,
QUESTION8
MR. AKKESS t

Arid then what follows from that?
What follows from that is that in order

to put him in a posture where h® can effectively represent and do
feis duty, immunity should be granted, for that and for tewo other

41

reasons.
QUESTIONS

Yese but suppose he does follow his client8©

directions where otherwise he would not?
MR. AKNESS j

What happens than?

If h© follows his client's directions,

that is the path of the easiest way out.

His client probably is

not well-served but he maybe dodges a malpractice action and that
is exactly what th© Criminal Justice Act should not do.
QUESTIONS

Hava there not been occasions where a

defense} counsel, paid, now, for th© moment, a paid defense counsel
privately retained, has informed the court out of the hearing of
the jury that he has advised the defendant not to tx.ke the stand
and that he wants th© court to Know that he has given that • advice
but the defendant insists on taking the stand.
Now, taking that hypothetical, is th© situation any
different for a privately*»retained lawyer or a public defendor
such as we have here?
MR. AFNESSs

That situation, in its essence, of course

is no different, Your Honor.

But it is almost inevitable that it

will occur in an involuntary relationship where it should not
occur in a private voluntary relationship.
QUESTIONi
in th® two?

Is feha fearlessness factor any different

If tho lawyer is skilled enough to realis© that that

is, in the particular situation that that is a desirable thing to
d© for hie own protection.
MR. AKNESSs

Yes, because the privately-retained

42

attorney can say, "If you do not want ray advic®, then hare is your
*

money and yon can gat another lawyer,”
QUESTIONS

Wall, but in the middle of a trial, that

is not very aasy,
MR, ARNESSs

Well,

that should have been worked out

long before th© middle of the trial, Your Honor,

Obviously, there

can occur things during the middle of a trial where even a privately*
retained lawyer could have a disagreement with his client.

There

is no doubt about that.
The question is whether or not the involuntary relation­
ship increases the risk and hazard of litigation,
QUESTION $

Mr, Amess, I question th® basic premise

on which you are arguing,

You Eire suggesting a situation In which

a lawyer in his professional judgment thinks ha should do A and
th© client nays, HI would rather have you do B” and the lawyer
thinks it would be stupid to do B so he does B anyway to protect
himself from a suit.
1 submit he is more likely to b® guilty of malpractice
if he follows th© stupid request ©f his client and does not folle»»?
his own professional judgment.
MR, ARNE3S:
QUESTIONt

Your Honor, the public policy —
I do not think that would b® a defensa to

a malpractice suit to say that "My client asked me to do this
stupid thing.”
MR. ARNES8s

I think you ar® absolutely right. Your

43

Honor but that is not the question.

The public policy considera­

tions here are not because there may be ultimata liability in a
malpractice suit.

We would presume that in most instances a mal­

practice action, because w® argue in our brief that it is not
we11-calculated to serva the interests — would not be availing.
The public interest is in freeing the lawyer from
having to go through and prove and being sued.and spending the
money said harassed and having to prove that his judgment was
correct and -™
QUESTION^
MR. ARNESS:

Mr. Amass, on© of the costs •»«
-« that the conviction would have

happened anyway.
QUESTION?

One of the costs of taking on casas like

this is exposure to the risks of complaints before the Ethics
Committee, the Bar Association, malpractice suits, all these sorts
of things.

There ara these complaints that are going to ba filed

against lawyers who take"on this litigation, no matter what the
rules ere.
MR. ARNESSx

Yes and we contend respectfully that

post-cc viction relief procedures, court disciplinary procedures,
Bar Ass elation disciplinary procedures are much betterecalculated
to handle the situation that can h@ conjured up.
Malpractice, because of the burden ©f proof require*»
meats, because of the defenses that are available and because of
the fact that 2255 relief is a concomitant of the thing where you

44

could well have a court rule that there be a requirement to
exhaust judicial remedies and then you would have collateral
estoppel problems.

Malpractice is really not well-designed to

get at the problem that wa are talking about here, which is the
competency of counsel.
QUESTION;

Mr. Amess# you told us earlier that there

were three reasons and you gave on® and then we hardly gave you
an opportunity to talk about th© other two.

Have you now given

them to us?.
MR, ARNESSs
QUESTIONS
MR. ARNESSs

Yes, Your Honor.
The 2255 and th© disciplinary,
No.

Those are important considerations

but the other two are these# Your Honor,

•

This Court has held

that th© reason for immunity of th© public policy is to prevent
harassment — I have talked about that —
QUESTION:
MR. ARNESSs

Right.
And secondly# th© recruiting, 'problem.

It is absolutely essential for the proper functioning of the
criminal justice system to draw well-meaning and competent counsel
into this,

If you read th® legislative history# such as it is#

with the Criminal Justice Act# it is apparant that Congress
wanted the participation of th© private Bar,
Now, that participation is something that is necessary
unless we are going to have a system where all dafenss is provided
by public defendes: systems, which would not be a good thing and

45

this, £.s I say, the recruiting element has been discussed in most
of the casus 'that have considered the immunity and w® think it is
a r©al concern,

tod those are the other two.

QUESTIONs

Do you think the actual fear of liability,

damages liability, would deter?

Because there is nothing you can

do about# as Brother Stevens says# these complaints before Bar
Associations and surely in the Federal Court itself if the defan$

dant is so-minded he can claim that he was inadequately repre­
sented and that the conviction should b@ reversed and I suppose
that, he could# if — let’s assume h© appealed and his conviction
was reversed on the grounds that his counsel has inadequately
represented him and had violated hi® constitutional right.

I

suppose the defendant could turn around and sue him in the
Federal Court in a Bivans-type action for violating his right to
counsel.

.
MR. ARNESS$
QUESTIONi

Yes# Your Honor# he could but *—
You would not suggest it?

You would not

suggest there would ba absolute immunity there# would you?
MR. ARNESS:

Well# we do not believe that the Bivens

situation is applicable here.

That was a Fourth Amendment problem.

That would not be within tbs scop© of the duty of a courtappointed attorney,
Your Honor# the 2255 relief which this vary Petitioner
could have filed more than two years ago has just been filed in
fcha month of September,

Why?

The record is silent.

But that

46

relief is much, more appropriate and that will do away completely
with the 10-year sentence that he is complaining about here if,
indeed —
QUESTIONt

It will do away with his lawsuit, too.

MR. &RNESS *
QUESTION?

Pardon?
It will do away with his damages and his

lawsuit, too.
MR. ARNESSs

Yes, it would render this case moot and

probably — either that or it would probably grant him certiorari.
QUESTIONS

Having rendered his case moot, how would

it stop the man from having don© the wrong that ha allegedly did?
MR,AKNESSt

Your Honor, that should fo© done by courts

and by Bar Associations disciplinary procedures.
QUESTIONS

Well, why have malpractice at all?

MR. ARNESS:

Well, Your Honor —

>s. •

QUESTIONS
