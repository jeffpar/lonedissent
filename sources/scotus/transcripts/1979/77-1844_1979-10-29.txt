PROCEED I N G S
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first this morning in Wo. 77-]844, City of Mobil© v. Bolden,
and the consolidated case of Williams v. Brown.
Mr. Rhyne, you may proceed whenever you ar© ready.
" ORAL ARGUMENT OP CHARLES S. RHYNE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OP THE APPELLANTS, CITY OF MOBILE
MR. RHYNE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
This case presents a question of whether the Equal
Protection Claus© of the Fourteenth Amendment requires the
abolition of the Mobile commission form of government elected
at large.
This is the first case involving a stata or a local
government where the entire form of government, not just the
manner of its ©lection, has been held unconstitutional.
Mobil© is on©-third black.

The District Court held

that only the abolition of the commission form of government in
its entirety could "provide blacks a realistic opportunity to
elect blacks to the city governing board."
I

The District Court also held that equal opportunity
included the election of representatives of their choice.

Now,

the ultimate issue in this case is whether the only way to
satisfy the constitutional requirement of equal protection,
equal participation in the voting processes of a government is

5
by electing a black to the Mobile governing body.
Now, the District Court held that while it was making
all of the findings about various subjects that I just men­
tioned, that blacks did not participate effectively, and we say
this is a clearly erroneous error because the record establishes
beyond question that in every contested election in the City of
Mobile,iand the last one was in 1973, the black vote is deci­
sive,,

In 1973, for example, Commissioner Graenow ran against

Mr. Bailey, who had defeated Commissioner Langan, who had bean
elected and re-elected 16 years with black support.

And in the

first election he received, only 15 percent of the black vote.
In the runoff ha received 43, and that elected him.
And as we state and quote on pagas 9 and 10 of our
brief, the judge is questioning Reverend Hope, v7ho is the black
president of the Mon-Bartisan Voters League, and he asked him,
!lIsn’t it a fact that the black vote in the Greenow race was
the difference, and in the Mimms race," the other commissioner,
and he said,

"Yes."

And then in addition to that, I would point out to
the Court that Commissioner 5oyle had no opposition, but he
testified that when he first ran, that he went to the NonPartisan Voters League, which is the only slating organization
in Mobile and it’s black, and h© was screened by them, and they
endorsed him.

And each one of these appellants have gone to

that league and received its endorsement after being screened

6

by them»

And so tha blacks do participate very vigorously in

the electoral processes of Mobile»
And so I say that where the elections are non-partisan
and where each of the appellants go and seek tha black vote *
and where it’s decisive, it cannot be said to be submerged or
diluted.
Mow, the Reverend Hope, when he was testifying in his
final statement that we quote on page 10, makes just one
sentence which 1 would like to quote to the Court because I
'think it's important, because he was talking about the fact
that he was speaking for the entire League, which is all black
and the most important slating organisation,

He said;

"They

fsal the candidates they have elected51 —- now these are the
three appellants who are here, and by "they" he means the NonPartisan Voting League — "have done a very good job along
that line of serving blacks,"
And over and over again this record is full of in­
stances in which blacks testified that when they supported
these appellants, they went down to City Hall and they asked
for what they wanted, and if it was possible in law and money,
they got it.
I’m not going to read the long list, but I can say
this:

Eight, the only sight of the witnesses of tha plain­

tiffs who were asked if they’d been down to City Hall, encl
under this open door policy that3s maintained by these ■

■

7
commissioners who exercise dual functions under the commission
form of government, they have both legislative and executive
powers, so they can in effect do it all.
these blacks,

If they tell on© of

"You’r© going to get a pavement," "You're going

to get this,” they get it, because they have the power to do it..
And so the fact that they not only take part in the
entire voting process from registration all the way through,
but they then in effect collect on their political obligations
shows that they play an extremely important part in the politi­
cal processes of Mobile.
Kow, w© had on© time, in 1973, where three blacks
ran, and those three blacks didn't carry the black wards.

Now,

as Witness Alexander, Dan Alexander who is a witness for the
plaintiff, testified in his testimony for the plaintiff

and

©lection for commissioner and an election for the school board
are two entirely different things.

When you run for the

school board, and Dan Alexander is a member of the school
board, you talk about what you can do for the school kids, and
it's county-wida.

When you run for commissioner, yon talk

about what a good businessman or woman you are, because the
commission form of government is supposed to elect businessman
to run cities.

That’s why it came into existence, and that’s

why over and over again, when they've had referendum» in
Mobile — well, they’ve had them in 1963 and 1973, according
to the record — th© people have overwhelmingly

.supported this

3

businessman form of local government.
Now, the Court below held that the intent that was
important here was not the intent of the three defendants but
the intent of the legislature.
defendant here.

Now, the legislature is not a

No State official is a defendant.

And they

go on and on and on talking about bills that have gone up to
Montgomery to change the form of government, and when you’re
talking about legislative intent, you're talking about a very
nebulous thing.

But in. their supplemental brief they cited

the fact that Sanator' Bus key, a black Senator, had introduced
a bill to give the people of Mobile a chance to vote on
another referendum about changing its government, and they go
on and on about how the fact that that bill went through the
House and then lost in the Senate.
What they don’t tell you is this, that that bill
reached the Senate on its 28th legislative day.

It got its

first reading that vary day, which is very unprecedented.

It

get its second reading -- and this is on page 10 and 11 that
they discuss thin -— its second reading on the 29th legisla­
tive day, and then it got .lost in the usual pile-up of bills
in State legislatures on that last day.
The thing that interests me is that the black Senator
from Mobil®, according to the journal, had absolutely nothing
to say.

Th@ bill died.
But again, it was going to give the people of Mobile

9
a chance to have a referendum.
So 1 urge upon the Court that the relevant intent
that you're going to consider intent is that of the three
defendants, the three commissioners that are before you, and
you can't find in this record, if you read it from beginning
to end, any instance in which they who must have the votes of ■
the black to win have discriminated against the blacks.

The

black votes are squally counted; they have an open door
policy; they see them; and as I say, the only eight witnesses
of the plaintiff who were asked testified unequivocally that
when they went to City Hall, they saw the appellants and they
got what they wont for, if it was legally or financially
possible.
And so it's not the State intent that's so important
her©.

It is the intent of these three appellants.

If it was

the State intent, why don't they have the State here?

Yet the

very basis of the District Court decision and the very basis
of.the Appellate Court decision is the inference that they
draw from the fact that n© black, and the District Court re­
peats this three times, has ever won a seat as commissioner of
Mobile.

He doesn't add the next part of it, which is that no

qualified blacks ever run.
And the other inference they draw is that State in­
action is circumstantial evidence of invidious intent against
what?

These thr©e appellants?

What do they have to do with

10
the Stat© Legislature's intenti"

And it's the most nebulous,

hardest thing to get at in the whole world.

It's like asking

Barry Goldw&ter what Senator McGovern's intent was on a bill.
I don't believe that the relevant intent is that of tha State
Legislature, but the relevant intent is that of the appellant
commissioners»

They're the only defendants, they'r@ fch® only

ones that are before this Court.

And so I urge, indeed, that

they have never been shown to have a racial purpose, that they
have been shown over and over again to be very sensitive to
the needs of blacks, and there is no racial purpose that st-.n

be attributed to them in any way, or how can they get over and
over the endorsement of the blacks, and how can they, when these
only three blacks ran, carry even the black wards?
So another point that I would make is that 'tha Court
of Appeals held that there was a very, very strong city
governmental intent in at-large elections in Mobile because
they were brought .in to wipe out ward healing, corrupt govern­
ment, and that this government has served Mobil© well for 6:3
years, without any charges of corruption or anything ©Is®.
And that is the good government than they are asking this
Court to uphold this abolition of.
Now, the failure of the Court below to find that in
this record, over and over again, that the blacks ara such an
important siment of the political processes — they get on
the stand and they brag about hew important they ara.

Wiley

11
Bolden said sure, they follow the pink sheet*

That pink

sheet is the one that has the names of the people that the
blacks have endorsed.

And when th® blacks ran, they endorsed

some of the blacks, but they also endorsed the whites, and
the appellants.

So I urge upon you that the intsnt that is

important is the intent of these appellants that they have done
absolutely nothing that can b@ called, on this record, in»
vldious discrimination.

No black has ever lost an election

in Mobil® because of polarised voting, and if you’re going to
draw inferences, why do you have to stop

they point to

Montgomery, they point to Birmingham where tomorrow we may
learn something, because the man who got more votes than I
think all three candidates, white candidatas, for mayor is up
for th© final vote.

I think h® got 30-something-thousand and

the other three got 3 G-something-thousand *
But look at Atlanta.

Look at Bradley.

of the people of Los Angeles were black®

He was defeated the*

first time around, but he pulled himself up and ran again, and
he’s been elected over and over and over again.
But yet in her© they talk about discouragement asbeing th® reason that no qualified black has run in Mobil®,
even though they have equal opportunity, equal access, equal

12
everything, and all they need is a qualified candidate.
Now, it's true that on the record there was some
dispute about whether qualified blacks could win.

The in­

teresting thing to me was, the judge was working over Mr.
Langan, who had won for 16 years straight and then the blacks
turned against him so h© lest.

He was trying to get him to

say that no black could be elected.

He said, "Well, it depends

And that I think is true.

I think the color

of a man, the color of a woman, doesn’t count in politics
anymore.

It8© their qualifications.

And this commission

form of government, above all, emphasizes, as Dan Alexander
said, the business capacity of these who want to be commis­
sioners.
Another aspect of this is, there ere enormous dif­
ferences between a city and a State.

2 don't think that your

decisions that relate to Stab® governments really apply here»
if you wipe out a multi-member State district, it doesn’t
change overall the State government.

If you wipe out the

commission form of government in Mobile, you disestablish the
whole government and bring in a whole new government, a mayor
and nine councilman and the councilmen most once a weak and
get $50 for a meeting, they can only talk to the mayor, they’re
not allowed to talk to the employees, and so the blacks really
are diluted by that order because now they can go down and
sea any on® of the commissioners and get anything they want,

13
talk to the head man, because they see them all.

And under

the Court’s order, they have to go down and see the mayor and
wait in line, and they don’t have the clout under the order
that they have now.
So ~
QUESTIGN:

Under the remedy decreed by the District

Court and affirmed by the Court of Appeals, predictably there
would be a minority of Negroes in the City Council, wouldn’t
there?
MR. RHYNE:

It looks like there would be three, yas.

And so, now, Reverend Hop©, for example, would have one of
those who h© could go see, and h© would go down to City Hall.
QUESTION:

They would fees a minority?

MR. RHYNE:

And so now, as the situation is, accord­

ing to his testimony, he goes down and sees one of the commis­
sioners directly, and the commissioner can order anything.
so they can do it all.
Now, the

And

So actually they’re being diluted.
we cited in our brief the comments that

political scientists have made about this.

They say that the

form of government, local government, is peculiarly something
for the people of the locality.

I think I’ve probably read

more charters, and 1 don’t mean to brag about it, than any
other man alive, because I’ve lived my life here.

I ones want

needs of that locality.

They are always adapted to the
And I’m not sure that courts are

political scientists enough to tell local governments what
\

kind of government is good for them.
But I com© back to the point I mentioned below already, and I want to emphasize it because I think it#s im­
portant.

Here we hav© a good government being wiped out based

on inferences and circumstantial evidence, as against the
record of the election of qualified blacks nationwide.

To me

it just doesn't stand up, and to me, the constitutional require\

ment is full participation in the political process, not a
guarantee of end result.
How, we talk about proportional representation of a
race, and you've said you're never going to grant that.

I

once went out to Cincinnati and talked to Mayor Seasongood for
half a day trying to understand proportional representation,
I never did.
QUESTION:
MR. RHYNE:

You hav© to run under it to understand it.
I suppose that you did.

1'S

QUESTION:

Mr. Rhyne, before you conclude, earlier

in your argument you suggested that the people whose intent
would ba most relevant would be the intent of fch© three com­
missioners.
MR. RHYNE:
QUESTION:

That's right.
How do you read th© District Court fincline j

and the Court of Appeals opinion?
those courts were talking about?

Whose intent do you think
The opinions are a little

bit unclear to me,
MR. RHYNE:

They were talking about the intent of the

legislature.
QUESTION:

You think it's definitely the intent of

the legislature?
MR. RHYNE:

Oh, yes.

They pinned everything on the

intent of th® lagislature.
QUESTION:

Because some of the material under the

Zimmar factors wouldn’t really bear on th© intent of the
legislature very much, and they seen to rely on those factors.
MR. RHYNE:

Well, I haven't said anything aboiat

some of-the 2isomer factors, th© service factors.

There are

other remedies for that, and I just don't think they belong in
a voting rights ease, and so I haven't gone into that.
But there is no qu@sfci.on but what both courts looked
to th© intent ©f th© legislature, not th® intent of these
appellants, because if you look to th© intent of th© three

IS
defendants here, it’s overwhelmingly in favor of the blacks.
There's nothing on -the other side.
QUESTION;

Mr. Rhyne, before you sit down, you have

indicated in your oral argument and also I think in your
brief that it’s your position that only the Fourteenth Amend­
ment is involved in this ease, and only the Equal Protection
Claus© of the Fourteenth Amendment,
MR. RHYNEs
QUESTIONS

Yes.
Your brothers talk about the Voting Rights

Act of 1965 as well as the Fifteenth Amendment, in addition
to the Fourteenth Amendment.
MR. RHYNEi

I gather you think they are —

Well, with respect to the Voting Eights

Act, I think that there has been no change here, and the foot­
note in Cirssu.it Court of Appeals, Footnote 14, where they say
it*8 problematic, they've never heard of it being applied this
way in a dilution case, I don't believe the Voting Rights Act
has any application whatever.
QUESTION:

Was that included as a ground of the

cause of action in the complaint?
MR. RHYNE:

It was, and if they didn't ilka the way

it was ruled on there, they could have appealed and didn't,
so I don't think it's before this Court.
QUESTIONS
MR. RHYNEs

How about the Fifteenth Amendment?
The Fifteenth Amendment, the District

Court really didn't say anything about the Court of Appeals,

17

said it required intent, so they really brought it doxm to
about the same thing as the Fourteenth Amendment.

And again,

they didn't appeal from that ruling, so I don't think it's be­
fore the Court.
QUESTION:

If the judgment can ba supported on the

basis of either the statute ©r the Fifteenth Amendment, I
suppose they are entitled to support it.
MR. RHYNE:
QUESTION:
MR. RHYNE:

Well, I think that —
On either of those grounds.
My answer would be that it cannot be on

the facts in this case.
QUESTION:

The decision of the District Court of

Appeals, as you understand team, were grounded on the Equal
Protection Clausa of the Fourteenth Amendment?
MR. RHYNE:

That's right, entirely.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr, Blacksher.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES 0. BLACKSHER, ESQ.,
CM BEHALF OF TEE APPELLEES, WILEY L. BOLDEN ET AL.
MR. BL&CKSKERs

Mr, Chief Justice, may it please the

Court, there ar© really only two issues that this Court must
address in this case.

The first is whether the case should fo©

decided on the basis of the statute, the Voting Rights Act,
or whether it should foe decided on the basis of the
Constitution.

And the second issue is whether this Court will

affirm and leave undisturbed the findings of two Courts below
V:'■

'

,

”

*

18
that the at-large election system in Mobile, Alabama, is
maintained for invidiously discriminatory reasons.
We believe that» particularly in light of decisions
of this Court in the last term. Cannon v. University of
Chicago in particular, that the conclusion that there is a
private cause of ’.action under Section 2 of the Voting Rights
Set is inescapable.
Under the factors of Court v. Ash®, there is vir­
tually no difference between the application of that case to
Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and Title 9 of the Education
Amendments.

That has bmm, briefed and I will not go into it

in further detail.
With respect to th® findings of fact that there is
an invidious purpose in the maintenance of this election
system, we believe, as w® have said in the supplemental brief,
that Columbus and Dayton and indeed, personnel Administrator of
Massachusetts v. Feeney, virtually require this Court, follow­
ing the same principles» to affirm the findings of the Dis­
trict Court and th® Court of^Appeals that th© at-largo exac­
tion system first put into affect in 1911 has not been changed,
notwithstanding attempts to do so, because of, not in spits of
but because of, th© knowledge that the at-large system pre­
vents blacks fresa having their electoral choices registered in
th® ©lection process.
Now, with r©sp@ct to the remedy —

19
QUESTION?

Mr. Blacksher, before you get to remedy,

whoaa intent are we talking about?
MR. BLACKSHER:
tors0 intent.

We are talking about the legisla­

We believe, if we correctly road Washington v,

Davis and Arlington v. Metropolitan Housing Authority, if wa
correctly read those casas, w© are talking about the lawmakers6
intent.

If we are investigating the question of invidious

purpose behind particular legislation.
If we ar© talking about the intent of the people who
operate the statute, then wa!v@ got what I suppose would be a
Yiquo v. Hopkins type of case, in which case wa would shift
our gas© and scrutiny to the actions of the people who were
actually operating th® election system.
QUESTION?

Mr. Blacks her, forg.lv a me if I have in­

terrupted your answer to Justice Stevens' question.

I wasn't

sure, whether you were finished or not.
If you ar© right that the judgment should be affirmed
hare because blacks ar© not being permitted to have their im­
pact felt in the electoral process, how far out can that line
of reasoning be extended under your theory?

How many ether

groups can claim that they were discriminated against by the
State Legislature because the State Legislature just didn't
happen to like that particular group?
MR. BLACKSHER:

I mean Catholics, Jews?

I think, Mr. Justice Rehnquisfe, that

that question has to be answered in the context of the Equal

20

Protection Claus© of th© Fourteenth Amendment.

And this

Court first must look to the question whether or not th©
judgments below must ba sustained on th© basis of the Voting
Rights Aet, which specifically addresses raca, or the Fifteenth
Amendment in tha cases decided undor ito
I believe that for th® purpos@s of this ease it is
important to recall that th® dilution principle? did not arrive
constitutionally fresa the principal of one person, one vote.
Racial, th© abridgement of voting rights on the basis of race
did not derive from the Fourteenth Amendment principles of a
full and ©££©stiv@ vote in on© person, on© vote.
QUESTIONS

Where did it dariv® from?

MR. BLACKSHER;

It derived from th® Constitution of

th® United States, th© Fifteenth Amendment and th© statutes
enacted under it.
What I wanted to point out was that in Reynolds v.
Sims, this Court had to look to the Fifteenth Amendment and to
th® cases decided under it, specifically Lana v. Williams,
Wilson, Goiaillion v. Lightfoot, Brown v. the Board, to find in
the Equal Protection Claus© a principle that says that there
is a full and effective vote for other classes of people.

And

it was on th® basis of that analogy or that juxtaposition of
the Fifteenth Amendment to th® Fourteenth that there was ever
developed a on© person, on® vote principis.
In fact, I think it8s interesting to not© that th©

21

fundamental disagreement that Justice Stewart had with the
Reynolds case all through the years has been that it was too
simplistic.

Sixth Grade arithmetic.

And did not take into

account the realities of -Idle political process to which the
Constitution must address itself.
For example, and I quote here, if the Court will in­
dulge me momentarily, from Justice Stewart's dissent in Lucas
v. the Colorado Assembly:
”1 could not join in the fabrication of a constitu­
tional mandat© which imports and forever freezes one theory of
political 'thought into our Constitution and denies to every
State any opportunity for enlightened and progressive innova­
tion in the design of its democratic institutions so as to
accommodate within a system of representative government the
interests and aspirations of diverse groups of people without
subjecting any group or class to absolute domination by geo­
graphically concentrated or highly organised majority."
QUESTIONs

Do you think that helps you?

MR. BLACKSHBKs

I believe it does, Mr. Justice

Stewart, because —
QUESTION:

Rather, an expression of unwillingness to

join in forcing a State to do anything, isn’t it?
MR. BLACKS HER:

1 confess that in -that particular

decision, your attention was directed to til© prerogatives of
the State legislature, not to what the Constitution requires.

22

QUESTION?

Well, I said th® Constitution didn’t re­

quire that,
MR. BLACKSHER?

You said th® Constitution did not

require th® imposition of strict population * one person ~~
QUESTION?

You think it follows that the Constitu­

tion does require something else?
MR, BLACKSHERs

I believe the Constitution does re­

quire that the right of persons to vote not be abridged on the
basis of r&e©.

That much we knots»

QUESTION?

What part of th© Constitution are you

relying on when you say that?
MR. BLACKSHERs
QUESTION?

Th@ Fifteenth Amendment.

This case was decided ©n th® basis of the

Fourteenth Amendment, wasn’t it?
MR. BLACKSHERs

This case was decided on the basis

of th© Fourteenth and th® Fifteenth Amendments in the judgment
of th© Court of Appeals below, and we relied from the beginning
on th© Voting Right® Act which was discussed, earlier as another
statute or as the first cans® of action that the Court ought
to approach, which of course is decided tinier the enforcement
provision of th© Fifteenth Amendment.
QUESTION?

Wall, th® Voting Rights Act, that is the

section with which this Court has dealt primarily has to do
with a change in th® method in soma scheme or device, or some
change in the method of «lection.

MR. BLACKSRBRs

In a footnote it said, we're going to

MR. BIACKSHERs

That is a possibility.

In the

rejected and th® Court want ahead and reached tha statutory

QUESTION:

But what result do you get in reliance

on the amendments you’ve recited to Justice Stewart and th©
statutes in respect to -- my question is to who, other than
blacks, can make this same claim, that although they’re al­
lowed to vote, their representation is diluted because of the
way th® districting goes, even though on© man, on© vote is
complied with?
I taka it from your referral to Yiquo that Asian
Americans could roly on it*
MR. BLACKSHER:

w© certainly believe they could, if

they can show that they've been treated th© way the black
folks hav© boon treated in Mobile.
QUESTION:

And that's a statutory showing?

MR. BLACKSHER:

That would ba our understanding of

the Reynolds principle under th© Fourteenth Amendment.

But

th© point I was trying to make, and I confess I got into it
a little bit obliquely, is this:
W© understand th© argument of the appellants in this
case to be that if this Court determines that the election
system in Mobil® satisfies the one person, one vote principle,
you ought to let it alone, that there ought not be any further
Federal inquiry or intervention into the actual workings of
the political process to determine whether or not blacks'

26
rights are neverth©l®ss being abridged»

And 1 am simply

pointing out that that.5 s letting the tail wag the constitu­
tional dog; that if there is a one person,, one vote principle»
it is because the Constitution spoke first to the equal rights
and to the voting rights of black people»

And whatever rights

other groups may h&v© under the Fourteenth Amendment principle:;
developed under Reynolds» surely the important rights of
blacks which the Civil War Amendment was designed to protect
cannot be forgotten in th© shuffle»

MR. BLACKSHER:

— mayor is the nominal chief

executive of the city, and that’s a rotating position among

QUESTION:

But th© three commissioners have the

MR. BLACKSHER:

They have the executive power, they

have th© legislative power, they have the administrative
power, and to sari® extent the judicial power, although we
have a municipal court that exercises most of 'the judicial
power of th© city.
QUESTION;

How do you distinguish the executive

functions of th© commissioners, and particularly of th© one
who is th© mayor, and the executive functions of the governor
of the State?
MR. BLACKSHER:

I don’t think there is any need to

distinguish those executive functions, Mr. Chief Justice

29
Barger.

I believe that, with respect feo the executive func­

tions , there's no reason to say that blacks must have an
equal opportunity to elect a parson in every executive office
or ©very executive department.

What they are entitled to is a

right to share fairly and affectively in the administrative
and legislative group determinations that government carries
out in Mobile.

QUESTION:

What percentage — does this record show

when it was a good as the white turnout it was around 36 to 40
percent.
QUESTION:

But if afol of the Negroes registered and

all of them voted, isn’t it likely that they could on this
record elect at least one commissioner?
MR. BLACKSHER:

Not in this case.

That was a fact

that the court found for the plaintiffs.
QUESTION:

I know they found it, but did they find it

with respect to that proposition that if every Negro eligible
to register did register and every registered Negro voter

voteds did they make a finding on that?
MR. BLACKSHER:

Although it was not cast in

those terras, the court's language can be read to include
that implication which was discussed during the trial.
I think the court says there is no reasonable oppor­
tunity for blacks to have their choices elected in the
at-large system.

QUESTION:

Mx», Blackaher, if we just for the

moment confine ourselves to the Fourteenth Amendment
agains I understand your separate argument on the Voting
Rights Act and the Fifteenth Amendment,

I would like to

pursue the thought Mr. Justice Rehnquist and I suggested
earlier about — you would say the same theory would
apply to Catholics» a religious or an ethnic group as well
as to blacks.

What about a political group such as

Republicans?
MR, BLACKSHER:

I was asked that question I

believe at the first argument» Mr. Justice Stevens» and
I replied that it would be the same.

I believe that

political groups probably would be protected» although I
think there is a difference in that -- as I have said
before» I think politics is the vehicle or the forum
through which we operate the political process» that it
is a volitional choice w-hl'ch^party you are in, and that
may cause some differences, differences which I simply
have not explored and which I don't think the Court needs
to at this point» certainly —»
QUESTION:

area in a city, do you think a city may draw their
electoral districts based on those, lines so as to clearly

MR* BLACKSHER:

I believe that a city can draw

their district lines any way that they fairly choose so
long as it cannot be demonstrated that the particular
ethnic or political group you are talking about has been
systematically excluded from the particular process*

history like that9 and there was proof that the at-large

argument here or wouldn’t you?

33
MR. BLACKSHER:
not.

I don’t know whether the difference in political

concerns makes the kind of difference that distinguishes
from ethnic or of religious or in this case racial classi­
fications, and I am Just not prepared to take a final
position on that.
QUESTION:

Well, it depends a lot I suppose on —-

whether you are not depends on how strong your Fourteenth
Amendment argument is as distinguished from your Fifteenth
and your Voting Rights Act.
MR. BLACKSHER;

Well, the thrust of my argument

today has been that I think that the Voting Rights Act and
Fifteenth Amendment arguments are clearly the strongest
because of their constitutional mandate3 because wa are
not dealing with a political theory that we are made out
of whole cloth, we are dealing with constitutional commands.
QUESTION:

And also I suppose in the Voting

Rights Act because you claim it covers effect as well as
purpose.
MR. BLACKSHER: vWe don’t think you have to reach
that question if you affirm the findings of purpose.
QUESTION:

I knew, but you wouldn't need to

affirm that, you could assume it if you take the Voting
Rights Act.
MR. BLACKSHER:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES P. TURNER, ESQ.,
AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING APPELLEES
MR. TURNER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court —
QUESTION:

Mr. Turner, before you commence, I

would be interested in knowing what groups you think are
encompassed by the term "race” in the Fifteenth Amendment.
MR. TURNER:

Well, that is a question on which

the Court has thus far given us very little guidance; cer­
tainly the purpose, the original purpose of the Fifteenth
Amendment was to secure the franchise for newly freed
black citizens.

blacks.

And /what we have here is a case involving

What we have in the United Jewish Organisation

is. a case Involving Jews and in each one you are going to
be able to make an assessment of the factual situation,
you are going to be able to compare the legislative history
end the constitutional history and make a coherent judg­
ment .
QUESTION:

But you had no trouble saying that

38
Hispanic Americans would be Included.
MR. TURNER:
QUESTION:

None at all.
What leads you to be able to answer

that question so easily and yet shy away from any expansion
into other national origin areas?
MR, TURNER:

Because 1 think that one of the

touchstones that I get out of this Court's opinions on the
Fifteenth Amendment is that it is directed towards the pro­
tection of the suffrage rights of traditionally discrimin­
ated against groups, and I think that includes Hispanics5
and Includes Puerto Ricans, it may in cases include Asian»
Americans.
QUESTION:
MR, TURNER:

Could it ever include whites?
Surely, as the Court at least in

majority seemed to say in United Jewish Organisation.
QUESTION:
MR. TURNER:

How about Marmans?
That would be a religious group and

I know of no basis under the Fifteenth Amendment directly
to cover Morraans, although if there were compelling cir­
cumstances and they were a discriminated against group,
it strikes me that the Court might well entertain the
argument although I don’t know how it would come out.
The one underlying concern that I think many
people have about this case is its scope.

There are lots

of large elections in this country, there are lots of

39
different minorities3 as we have just gone through, and
the question

I

think suggests itself of whether by affirm­

ing the decisions below, the Court would be taking a giant
3tep towards requiring constitutional reform of hundreds
of cities.
Now, if I make no other point today, I want to
argue that on this record the electoral practices in
Mobile are in a special category,

These cases do not pre­

sent the normal operation of your regular garden variety
at-large election system that all of us are familiar with
and which have produced competent governments across the
land.
QUESTION:

Mr. Turner, you speak for the United

States here, for the Department of Justice.

Now, over

recent years the federal government has engaged in a great
many activities, legislative, executive and otherwise to
insure the rights of minorities to have housing and in an
integrated way with all other people.
MR., TURNER:

Is that not right?

We have? made in my department every

effort to enforce the Fair Housing Act which so far we
have regarded as a freedom of choice statute.
QUESTION:

Now if you succeed in that enterprise

widely, then district elections 'won't help very much, will
they?
MR. TURNER:

Not if we succeeded at the measure

40
of success that la not so great at this point or foresee­
able —
QUESTION:

Well, not that it is right now, but

if you succeed, if your objective is a sound objective,
and Congrsss has decided that it is, how do you reconcile
that with the insistence on a program that will furnish an
incentive for people of a particular category to live in
enclaves» whether they be Indians, Puerto Ricans, Orientals,
Spanish sur-namsd people, whatever?

How do you reconcile

those two things?
MR. TURNER:

X think that as long as you ha^/e a

situation as In Mobile, where at-large systems are used
racially to dilute minority votes, there will be no progress
away from block voting.

And when minorities are able to

elect members of the government, our experience is that
the stigma that once attached to race quickly dissolves.
Birmingham is an example, as Mr. Rhyne mentioned.

Tomorrow

a black councilman, not a private citizen but a councilman
is in the runoff for mayor.

While there is no record of

the facts there, the participation — his particiulation in
local government certainly was of assistance in getting him
into the runoff.
So I think at this stage in the history, where
there are ghettos and

where there are separate residences,

and the record here shows that you couldn’t divide Mobile

41

into three districts without one of them being majority
black, it is that kind of housing segregation

we are

talking about, and no effort by my department to enforce
the Pair Housing Act is going to change

that in the next

few years.
So Mobile It seems to me is not a situation like
Marion County, Indiana in the Chavis case where blacks
Just got on the wrong side in elections and therefore
lost.

Here the blacks have formed a political group,

the Nonpartisan Voters League, and repeatedly have at­
tempted to form coalitions with like-minded white voters,
but it has been repeatedly unsuccessful.
My time is very short, but I would like to point
out a couple of things to you.

Mr. Rhyne has spoken about

the powers of the league's endorsement.

This endorsement

is made on a pink sample ballot and It is true that many
candidates seek this support, but it is not described how
the league has to withhold release of that endorsement,
keep it secret until sometimes within hours of the poll
operations.

State Senator Eddington, a white Senator,

testified that he has twenty years experience in Mobile
politics.

He says it has to be held up before the election

because those xfho don't get the endorsement want to get
copies and spread them out to other areas in Mobile County
to use against the candidates that were endorsed.

The

result is that black supported candidates frequently get
into the runoff —
QUESTION:

Is there anything in th® state law or

federal law that would prohibit that process of circulating
it in other districts?
MR. TURNER:

No.

What we are trying to find out,

it seems to me, is whether Mobile is a situation like
Marion County, Indiana, where blacks were Democrats and
they lost elections and they came to this Court complain­
ing that they lost more elections than they should and
they didn’t have enough representation and the Court said
that’s tough because you’ve made political choices and you
had a fair chance.
Now, if Mobile was like that, vs wouldn’t be
here, but the two courts below have said it isn’t like that
and I am trying to point out the basis for their reasoning.
So when you get to th® runoff election and there is a black
supported candidate whose pick endorsement^has been made
known now, there is no way to hide it any longer and that
is where you get what one expert called the Mkiss of death."
The record has several examples, but let me just give you
one.
If you will turn to page 593 in Volume II of the
appendix in the Mobile case, that is No. 77-l8t*i — the
numbers are at the bottom —

QUESTION:

MR, TURNER:

QUESTION:

Volume II seems to begin with page 821,

MR. TURNER:

QUESTION:
MR, TURNER:

Oh.
There was a Mobile person, Mrs.

Oerre Koffler, a white resident, who decided to run for
the school board in 1972 because she wanted to see if there
was some way we soulcl make the April Supreme Court decision
work in Mobile, that is your decision in Davis.

She ob­

tained the league’s endorsement, she got into the runoff,
and If you look at page 593 you will see the kind of ad
that came out after the endorsement was made public.

It

shows a picture of a black leader, John LaPlore, it shows
the white candidate, it alleges such scurrilous things as
"she has entertained blacks in her home, she has been seen
and photographed in company of blacks," but it also shows
the exact vote she got in each black ward —

is really most important here?

Whose intent

I suppose you can always

find in a community some very strong anti-black sentiment*
maybe in the legislature, maybe in the city council„

What

group of people if any should we focus on in the intent

issue?
MR. TURNER:

Well, it is a very troublesome

thing, and 1 think it may depend on which amendment you
want to talk about.

Intent is very nebulous, especially

in a case like this.
QUESTION:

What do you understand it to mean or

what do you understand the court below to have held on
the intent issue?
MR. TURNER:

I understand that as in Norwood v.

Harrison, where Mississippi 3ince 1940 had maintained a
textbook program and then when desegregation of schools
came, that program mushroomed to provide books to the pri­
vate schools.

It was the evolution, the changing circum­

stances that eroded what had been a perfectly proper state
purpose Into an illegitimate unconstitutional one by the
decision of this Court.

46
So if you are talking about that kind of change#
that kind of evolutionary change, it is very hard to —
QUESTION:

Here we are talking about a refusal

MR. TURNER:

Right.
And in this kind of case, whose intent

should we look at?
MR.- TURNER:

But here if you go in the Fourteenth Amendment,

I say you look at the legislative intent.

MR. TURNER:

Now, if —

MR. TURNER:

If you go on the Fifteenth Amend­

ment in the case. Your Honor, we have outlined in the brief
how this Court*s precedents, especially Terry v. Adams,
have held that by a state adopting private purposeful dis­
crimination —
QUESTION:

Let me put the question this way:

If

it is the legislative intent that is controlling, suppose
everybody in Mobile wanted to have blacks fairly represented

M6--A

Into three districts without cne of them being majority
black, it is that kind of housing segregation

we are

talking about, and no effort by my department to enforce
the Fair Housing Act is going to change

that in the next

few years.
So Mobile it seems to me is not a situation like
Marion County, Indiana in the Chavis case where blacks
just got on the wrong side in elections and therefore
lost.

Here the blacks have formed a political group,

the Nonpartisan Voters League, and repeatedly have at­
tempted to form coalitions with like-minded white voters,
but it has been repeatedly unsuccessful.
My time is very short, but I would like to point
out a couple of things to you.

Mr. Rhyne has spoken about;

tha powers of the league’s endorsement.

This endorsement

is made on a pink sample ballot and it is true that many
candidates seek this support, but it is not described how
the league has to withhold release of that endorsement,
keep it secret until sometimes within hours of the poll
operations.

State Senator Eddington, a white Senator,

testified that he has twenty years experience in Mobile
politics.

He says it has to be held up before the election

because those who don’t get the endorsement want to get
copies and spread them out to other areas in Mobile County
to use against the candidates that were endorsed.

The

and was giving them excellent services and were promptly
prosecuting people who burned crosses and everything was
going along fine, if you had a majority of the state
legislature who said w@ don't want any blacks in the
government in Mobile, would it be the same case?
MR, TURNER;

I'm not sure, certainly not under

the Fifteenth Amendment because it is our submission that
under the Fifteenth Amendment that there is certainly
state involvement in running ©lections and. in running atlarge elections in Mobile, and there certainly is private
discrimination3 just like there was in the Jay Bird Club,
and by the state magnifying and making use and making
effective that private discrimination, it is the same
principle as Terry v. Adams that would apply.

So you use

the private discrimination that is implemented by state
procedures,

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES S. RHYNE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS (MOBILE) — REBUTTAL
MR. RHYNE;

If the Court please, I only have two

comments and then, unless the Court has some questions, I
have no further argument.
I am really amazed at the government of the

48
United States trying to use a school board race exhibit
on 593, a county commission race on 595 against the city.
I pointed out in my argument that the two are
entirely different, and I think that this shows how weak
their case is if they would stoop that low.
Now, 1 would be glad to answer any questions
the Court has, but my time is just about up.
QUESTION:

Well, those exhibits, Mr. Rhyne, do

show that apparently there was some evidence that there
was black voting on racial lines there, doesn't it?
MR.' RHYNE:

Well —

QUESTION:

I suppose if there was black voting

on the school board or on the county election, it is
reasonable to infer that there would, be black voting on
the other kinds of —

QUESTION:

Do you challenge the District Court

finding that there was racial block voting within the

MR. RHYME:

I would say I do.

It is lessening,

according to expert Boyles and that more and mors through­
out the South as well as in Mobile race is not a factor in
all elections.
QUESTION:

Whoever put out these pamphlets ap­

parently thought It was.
MR. RHYNE:

Well, I think that those pamphlets

were used in a different race for difference purposes and
had nothing to do with the city.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEP JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Rhyne.

Mr. Allen, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM H. ALLEN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS WILLIAMS ET AL.
MR, ALLEN:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case concerns the legality of the way the
commissioners, the school commissioners of Mobile County
are elected.
Mobile County encompasses the City of Mobile
and a rather large surrounding area which Includes some
other smaller cities.

Overall, the population of the county

is divided, racially in about the same proportions as the
city.

Blacks make up 32 percent of the county's population

50
and I think 24 percent of its voters.
Mobile County's school system was the first to
be established in Alabama In 1826, seven years after state­
hood.

Since that time probably, and at least since 1836,

when a new statute governing the school system was enacted,
the members of the governing body of the school system
have been elected from the county at large.

The current

statute under which they have been elected, it was enacted
in 1919a provides for the- at-large election of five commis­
sioners.

They are elected in partisan elections held in

even numbered years for six-year staggered terms.
As a board, the commissioners are responsible for
the overall direction and management of the Mobile County
schools.

They hire a superintendent who is responsible

under their direction for the day-to-day management.

Wow,

certain salient points appear from the findings below or
the undisputed evidence of record concerning the school

X

board's elections and their relation to the black population
of the county.
First, the system of at-large elections for
Mobile County school board members was not created for any
racially discriminatory reasons.

As I have already indi­

cated, the system has deep roots in the history of Alabama
and of Mobile in particular. It was first established in

1836, no later, at a time when blacks did not vote and the

51
last reestablished in 1919 at a time when blacks were still
effectively disfranchised.
Second* the second salient point Is notwistanding
the history of racial discrimination in Alabama and Mobiles
there are today no barriers, no barriers formal or informal
to black participation in Mobile County’s political process»
Blacks are free to register and vote and they do vote
nearly in proportion to their proportion of the voting age
population.

Their votes are sought for.

The only signifi­

cant candidate endorsing body that appears to operate
countwydie in Mobil® County is what you have heard about,
that la the Nonpartisan Voters League.
QUESTION:

Is that the same league that we heard

about in the opening case?
MR, ALLEN:

MR- ALLEN:

MR» ALLEN:

Yes

it operates in the county —

And city —
— and the city as well, yes.
It is not two different organisations.
No, the same organisation.

They are

predominantly black, true, and there is nc comparable white
group, no backstage or- even front-stage slating organisation
of the kind that the Court may have been concerned with in
some other cases, no slating really in that sense.
QUESTION:

Is there anything in the record that

shows who pays for all of this advertising of political

52
stuff?
MR. ALLEN;
QUESTION;

I'm sorry, Your Honor?
Is there anything in the record that

shows who pays for these advertisements and other things
that normally help in political campaigns?
MR. ALLEN;

There is not, Your Honor,

One can

infer that the advertisements were paid for by the candidate
running against the candidate who is disfavored in those
ads^ if that ia vrhat Your Honor means.

politics that money doesn’t come out of the clear blue sky.

QUESTION:
MR. ALLEN:

So I am still in the same place.
Yes.

In any event, in that regard,

anyone is free to run for office and the fact Is that a
school board campaign does not cost very much.

Up until

very recently, the school board members have not been
paid at all and they are still paid rather nominally.

So

a typical campaign budget runs no more than $2,000,
$3,000 to $5»0009 according to th® record.

gered terms, two, two, and on® system.
QUESTION:

Is it a per diem compensation they

It is a per meeting compensation.

get or --

QUESTION:
MR. ALLEN:

Per meeting.
Yes.

Yes.

Now, the third salient

point — and I have to acknowledge this for the record of
this case, whatever may be the ease in the city’s case
there does appear to be racial polarisation in voting.
Pour black candidates ran In the Democratic
Primary for the school board between 1962 and 197*1.

Each

of them reached the runoff election, although each was a
first-time candidate for public office.

Each was defeated

in a runoff against a white opponent.
Now, on the basis substantially of what I have
recited plus a few more rather tangential items, the
District Court concluded that the at-large manner of
electing Mobile County school commissioners violates the
Fourteenth and perhaps the Fifteenth Amendments.

The

District Court made its analysis of this issue within the
framework of the so-called Zimmer factors, factors that
the Court of Appeals had professed to distill from this
Court’s opinions.
The Court of Appeals performed that distillation

in a case called Zimmer v. McKeithen before Washington
v. Davis was decideds and they were obviously — the
Zimmer factors were intended to measure the discriminatory
effects of an at-large system.
The District Court's ultimate conclusion in
this case was that the plaintiffs had met their burden by
showing an aggregate of the factors catalogued in Zimmer.
The Court of Appeals affirmed In a very short per curiam
opinion without hearing argument and referring merely to
a prior decision In the City of Mobile's case.
The District Court's remedy for the constitu­
tional violation It found was to create five districtss
two of which are preponderantly black in population.

The

Court of Appeals also affirmed this remedy, the judgment
was not stayed, elections were held and the two predomin­
antly black districts in 1978, the two black candidates
were elected to the board and noi* sit.
I am not going to dwell this morning on the
District Court's Zimmer analysis in what we conceive to be
its flaws which are thoroughly explored in our briefs.
If the plaintiffs continue to defend that analysis either
as it was actually engaged in by the District Court or as
it was transmuted by the Court of Appeals by other cases
into the equivalent of a finding of purpose rather than
effect, they do so I think very faintly at this stage.

55
What the plaintiffs essentially rely on In this
Court is something different, a passage, one passage of
the District Court*s opinion that is wholly removed from
the analysis on which it purported to base its opinion.
That is a passage in which the court does indeed talk
about a present purpose to discriminate,

Mow let me take

up the District Court's opinion.

each of the Zimmer headings.

law.

These are at pages 9 to 22

And then it turned to the conclusions of

The passage on which the plaintiffs rely appears in

a section of the conclusions of law where the court was
addressing itself for nine pages to the impact of
Washington v. Davis in vote dilution cases.

It asked

whether Washington v. Davis was dispositive of this ease
so as to preclude application of the Zimmer factors.
Now, at page 3*1 it made a comment about a —
QUESTION:
MR, ALLEN:

Page 3*1 of what?
Page 3*1 of our appendix, 3**& of

the appendix.
QUESTION:
MR, ALLEN:

Thank you.
It talked about a present purpose

to dilute the black vote.

Now, I submit that that is not

a finding of a present purpose to discriminate.

The

plaintiffs have tried to make of it a finding, have talked

56
even about the two court rules and urged deference to that
finding* but It isn't a finding3 Isn't even really a legal
conclusion.

It is sort of conjecture on the part of the

District Court at the best and really more likely a state­
ment of a discarded
the case.

alternative legal theory for deciding

Because what the court finally says down near

the bottom of page 34 is that more basic and fundamental
than any of the above approaches is that, and then it goes
on and I suggest says that Washington v. Davis established
no new purpose test so far as voting dilution cases are
concerned* and that was the answer to the question that
had posed itself at the beginning of this part of its
opinion and
QUESTION^

Mr. Allen* taking that page of the

appendix to which you are addressing* the last sentence
in the paragraph in the middle of the page* the court says
there is a "current" condition of dilution of the black
vote resulting from intentional state legislative inaction
which is as effectual as the intentional state action re­
ferred to in Keyes.

MR. ALLEN:
QUESTION:
MR. ALLEN:
QUESTION:
MR. ALLEN:
QUESTION:

Yes.
All right.
Yes, Your Honor.
All right.

Thank you.

Okay.
Vfouldn't you at least concede that

that is a finding of intentional state legislative inaction?
You may feel that is not the same thing as intentional
action.
MR. ALLEN:

I suggests Your Honor, the point I

sought to make was that I do not consider that a — I do
consider it indeed a statement of whatever is said there.
It is not I suggest a finding in any customary sense of
that.

He had made his findings of fact elsewhere and he

really had not addressed himself at any length to what
might underlie ft finding of current intentional state in­
action.
But I will go"on and say that we can suppose
that this passage really did mean to conclude far more
than it seems to have on its face, that the at-large
elections involves a present purpose to discriminate
through state inaction.

58
Now, the further question is what record facts
are there that might support such a conclusion.

The

court mentioned one specific fact on the preceding page,
and there it said — and these are its words approximately
—■ whenever a redistricting bill of any type is proposed
by a member of the Mobile County legislative delegation,
a major concern is centered around how many if any blacks
would be elected,

He does say that.

Mow, the fact is that In spite of that concern,
or perhaps even because of it, the legislature in 1975 did
enact districting legislation for the Mobile County school
system.

That legislation was voided on the suit of the

school board because of a defect in notice that rendered
It invalid under the state constitution.
Mow, the plaintiffs seek to make a great deal of
this invalidation, and I think what they would have this
Court rule is that the districting legislation and its
invalidation somehow constitute evidence of a present
purpose to discriminate.

The least that can be said in

response to that. Your Honors, is that the District Court
did not so treat it and made no such finding.

And I would

suggest further that the federal judicial inquiry that
might even yield such a finding nwould be an undertaking
of extreme delicacy.
I submit that this Court should not be asked to

59
make the sort of judgment on the Alabama legislature that
appellees state or imply on the basis of nothing more
than what appears in this record.

So when the specifics

are out of the way that the District Court cited9 and if
we forget the 1975 enactment that on its face looks the
other way, what we have at the very most, at the very
most is state legislative inaction that maintains a nonracially motivated at-large voting system and an awareness
on the part of at least some legislators of the disparate
racial effects of that system.
Now, I submit that to make a finding or to draw
a conclusion of a present purpose to discriminate on the
basis of this perpetuation arguably of discriminatory
effects through inaction is exactly what this Court re­
jected last term In Personnel Administrator v. Feeney,
and Indeedin the Feeney case there was more than mere
inaction.
The Massachusetts Veterans Preference law had
been amended from time to time and effectively reenacted,
and the Court did not blink at saying that there must
have been full awareness on the part of the general court
that the legislation was keeping a disproportionate number
of women out of the higher levels of the civil service,
but that wasn’t enough.

That wasn’t enough.

To have

made it enough vrould have undermined the rule of

60
constitutional law with which the Court began its analysis
in Feeney9 and that rule stated, even in the paradigm
case of race, that is what the Court said, even if a
neutral law has a disproportionately adverse effect, it
is unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause only
if that impact can be traced to a discriminatory purpose.
Now, let me stop there for a moiaent and just
say a word about the Fifteenth Amendment.

The Court of

Appeals held in the companion cases — one doesn’t know
what the court may have meant to hold in our case because
its opinion is not at all revealing, but in the companion
cases, the Court of Appeals held that the Fifteenth
Amendment imposes the same purpose requirement, and we
have urged in our briefs

I will not expand upon the

points now but I think they are adequately made there —
that the Court of Appeals wa» quite right that one does
not escape the problem that is posed under the Fourteenth
Amendment in this case by turning to the Fifteenth Amend™
ment.
QUESTION:

Assuming there were a private cause

of action in the Voting Rights Act, what do you say about
the Voting Rights Act?
MR. ALLEN:

I was just about to turn to that,

Your Honor, and I would say further two things under the
Voting Rights Act.

One, the argument that is made here is

61
made most belatedly»

To be sure, the Voting Rights Act

has been in the case»

Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act

has been In the case from the beginning.

It has never

been suggested until we reached this Court that it might
have a different content from the Fifteenth Amendment,
And what the government says in its amicus brief about
section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, it seems to me to
capsule what it is and why it also does not offer a way
out of what may be the problem posed by this case.
In a footnote on page 8*i of its brief, the
government says section 2 represents Congress’ rearfciculafcion of the Fifteenth Amendment, and that is what it
amounts to.

It is not section 5.

It does not read th®

same way as section 5.
QUESTION:

Yes, but the government doesn't think

necessarily that purpose is essential in the Fifteenth
Amendment.
MR. ALLEN:
QUESTION:

The government does —
So you are not really making much of

a point.
MR. ALLEN:

Oh, I understand that but independent

s

of what the government says, we believe that the legislative
history does indeed show that —
QUESTION:
MR. ALLEN:

Let me go at this in two steps.

62
QUESTION:

One, do you think the argument is

available in this Court by an appellee that the Voting
Rights Act is an issue here and should be disposed of
first
MR. ALLEN:
QUESTION:

Yes.
— and that the Voting Rights Act

covers effect as well as purpose?
MR. ALLEN:
question.

I will answer the first part of the

I say I think the issue is here.

Whether the

Court would wish to remand for development of the point
is a separate subject.
QUESTION:

So the issue of the Voting Rights

Act is fairly here?
MR. ALLEN:
QUESTION:

Yes.
How about the issue of the Voting

Rights Act covering effect as well as purpose?
MR, ALLEN:

Do I think that is a legitimate issue

here?
QUESTION:
MR. ALLEN:

Yes.
Yes, I think that is all the more

reason for a remand were the Court not to think that on its
face section 2 is a mere restatement of the Fifteenth Amend-»
ment s yes.
QUESTION:

And do you think that, as you under­

stand our cases, we should dealing with the Voting Rights

63
Act first —
MR, ALLEN1:
QUESTION:

1 think that —

— in any opinion that we write In

this case at least either on the merits or at least put
the issue aside?
MR, ALLEN:
issue aside,

I think It would be fair to put the

I think it would also be fair ~ I happen

to believe on the merits that the Voting Act meaning issue
is not a difficult one and that it does come down to mean­
ing the same thing as whatever Your Honors think the
Fifteenth Amendment means.
QUESTION:

Is your response to Justice White’s

question predicated in any way on an assumption that there
is or is not a private cause of action under —
MR. ALLEN:

Well, if he asked me to make that

assumption —
QUESTION:
MR. ALLEN:

I'm sorry, I misunderstood.
--has to be hurdled in getting to

section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, to be sure, and we
have urged in our reply brief at some length why it should
not be read as creating private cause of action.

It has

never been so read to this time that I am aware of.
Let me return to Feeney and make one final
point in respect to that opinion as it bears on our case.
The Court there spoke of the impact of veterans preference

on women as essentially an unavoidable consequence of a
legislative policy that has always been deemed to be
legitimate.
So far as the legitimacy of state policy is concerned3 if veterans preference is a legitimate legislative
policy, then surely the policy of at-large municipal
elections„ the policy that antedates the Constitution
still prevails in hundreds3 even scores of communities
throughout the country, is a legitimate policy.
And as for the inevitability of the adverse con­
sequences of pursuing the policy, one can hope that the
unfortunate consequences of at-large elections are not
unavoidable or inevitable —■
QUESTION:

I take it it is pretty fairly your

position that a municipal at-large election or a — for
the purposes of state legislatures, a county-wide at-large
election or a multi-number district, electoral district for
the election of, say, ten state representatives, neither
of those arrangements at-large is shown to be unconstitu­
tional if you have also a very clear proof of voting on
\

•

racial lines.
MR. ALLEN:
QUESTION;

Even though one has that proof —
Even though — let’s say anybody in

his right mind would say yes, there is pretty clearly
racial lines

65
MR. ALLEN.
QUESTION:

No —
Putting those two together, it doesn’t

euqal — MR. ALLEN:

— It does not add up to the con­

stitutional or statutory violation on which this case is
based.

Yes, that is exactly our point, Your Honor.

We

believe that that is the beginning point of analysis.

The

problem arises when somebody gets exorcised and brings a
lawsuit when he sees an at-large system of elections and
what can be termed racially polarised or block voting.
The inquiry proceeds from that point, the Inquiry proceeds
from that point, it doesn’t end there, and our concern
here is that we think the District Court essentially ended
its inquiry there.
QUESTION:

Let's proceed one step further beyond

the assumptions Mr. Justice White made.

Assume the record

does demonstrate and there Is an appropriate finding of a
present intent to maintain the system in order to prevent
black participation in the school board.

Would that con­

stitute a constitutional violation when the original law
was lawful when adopted?
MR. ALLEN:

What is your view on that?

All I can say in answer to that. Your

Honor, is that if there were indeed the basis for and the
kind of finding that I would hope this Court would insist
upon, the kind of record that I hope this Court would insist

66
upon to find a present intent of a legislature, then I
would have a hard tine distinguishing that ease from the
case in which the statute in its Inception was racially
discriminatory.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE:

Thank you.

Mr. Schnapper, you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAP35ERs ESQ. s
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES BROVJN ET AL.
MR. SCHNAPPER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Before turning to the substantive issues pre­
sented by the ease, I think It might be useful to lay out
some of the procedural problems about the way the Court
will choose to address the variety of issues presented
here.

Some of them have come up before arid some of them

have not.
One issue which Mr. Allen raised and which has
been raised by earlier questions is whether or not to deal
with the statutory question that is I think unquestionably
presented by the case.
The Court has for many years maintained a policy
which it has attempted to persuade the lower courts to
follow

of deciding statutory issues first and only reach­

ing constitutional issues if necessary.
As this case and Beesser and Bakke all illustrate.

6?
the lower courts have not been assiduous in attending to
that rule, and the question before the Court is how the
Court is to act when the lower court has not followed
your preferred procedure.
I think that there are three options, one of
which should not be taken.

The one that should not be

taken is the option fcak?n in Arlington HeightsB which is
to decide the constitutional question and remand for de­
cision on the statutory question.

As you may remember,

after ruling for the defendants on the constitutional
question in that ease, an opinion which provoked some
dissents and made a lot of law that may or may not have
been necessary, on remand the Court of Appeals reached
the statutory issues ruled for the plaintiff., and this
Court denied cert.

So that entire opinion, tilth all Its

ramifications, and we deal with many of them today, was
unnecessary.
31 think that following that course would be un­
wise not only because it leads you into deciding unneces­
sary issues but because it doesn’t -«• I would lead the
Courts of Appeals by example, and that was not the kind of
example I think you wanted to give them.

I think the two

options you have are, first, and I think this is the
proper option, to do what you dod in Bakke, to decide the
statutory issue first, reach the constitutional issue if

68
necessary„ or you could wipe the whole case out and send
it back and tell the Court of Appeals to do it right the
first time.
QUESTION:

Of course, your first option which

you say you prefer is going to lead to some undesirable
practices, too, on the part of people who have lost on a
constitutional question in a lower court because they can
just look through the statute books and if they can find a
statute that they say, gees the others I night have won on
this statute, therefore it was unnecessary to reach the
constitutional question, they will have a built-in argument
for at least a remand.
MR. SCHNAPPER:

I think they’ve got to. look

through a different volume.

They've got to look through

the appendix and take a look at the complaint.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. SCHNAPPER:
is one thing.

If it is in the complaint, that

I would —

QUESTION:

Rut under notice of pleading under

the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, you don’t have to
state the statute you rely on, all you have to do is plead
alleged facts sufficient to support a claim for relief.
MR. SCHNAPPER;

But the practice of this Court

has generally not been to permit litigants to raise issues
which in no way have been raised below,

So I think it

69
would be perfectly proper,, and I think consistent with the
pa3t practices of the Court that if a litigant wanted to
raise a statutory issue whieh had in no way been raised by
the complaint or briefs below, to preclude them from doing
that.
QUESTION:

You don’t go so far as to say that

the parties must raise a possible statutory issue along
with a constitutional issue?
MR. SCHNAPPER:
QUESTION:

I would say —

Suppose the parties constructed their

case as a constitutional case, if they want to, can’t they?
MR. SCHNAPPER;

Well, I would think that would

be terribly unwise and I —
QUESTION:

Well, it may be unwise but they may.

I suppose your answer might be that even if they do, per­
haps here the court would have, if they come from federal
courts, I suppose this Court would have the power to insert
another issue into it, but you wouldn’t say it was error
for lower courts to decide the constitutional issue if the
parties had never raised anything but the constitutional
issue.
MR* SCHNAPPER:

I would say it was an error on

the part of the Court of Appeals to have done that.

1

think it would have been entirely within the discretion of
the court to refuse to entertain a new statutory claim in

70
the first instance hers*

On the other hands quite frankly,

there have been cases where you have chosen to entertain
new statutory issues for reasons having to do with subse­
quent developments and also some — I wouldn't want to
suggest that you lock yourself into a ritual that you will
never do that.,

I think you ought to retain the power to

go either way.
QUESTIONS

constitutional question, w® are willing to assume the com­
plaint states a claim for relief under the federal statute

claim and asked for a decision on the constitutional claim,
I assume the District Court would have accepted their con­
cession, ruled for the plaintiffs, and that would have
been the end of it.
QUESTION:

So it could not then go to the

71
constitutional case?
MR. SCHNAPPER:

Well, I can’t imagine why a

district judge facing a concession of liability under
statute would decide a constitutional issue as well.
QUESTION:

Well, what if the defendant said, let’s

assume for the sake of argument, we don’t concede but we
think the most Important thing here is the constitutional
question?
MR. SCHNAPPER:

No district judge it seems to me

would act properly to let the defendant control the order
of decisions and to ignore the policies of this Court to
decide statutory issues first.
QUESTION:

I agree but I think there are a lot

of district judges that don’t,
MR. SCHNAPPER:

Well, I think there are, too,

and there are some Courts of Appeals judges who don’t and
it is upon that point: that I began my suggestion that you
deal with this the way you wanted the Couj’t of Appeals and
the District Court to deal with it, and that is to decide
the statutory issue first.
The second problem pertains to something quite
related to this, and that is the question of whether new
issues can be raised for the first time here on appeal,
and we’ve got two things that seem to be in that posture.
The first one is the question of whether or not White v.

72
Regester and the doctrine therein applies to municipal
governments.
This case is In precisely the same posture as
Wise v. Lipscomb, it was never raised below in the District
Court or the Court of Appeals.

The policy of this Court

is not to permit things to be raised at the last moment
and we think you should adhere to that.
On my reading of the record» the same thing is
true about whether or not there is a private cause of
action under section 2.

As you recall, with the exception

of Mr. Justice Stewart, most members of the Court were of
the view in Bakke that that issue not having been raised
below could not be raised in that particular case at first
instance here.

And we think that the question of whether

there is a private cause of action under the Voting
Rights Act is in that posture, in the same posture that
the private cause of action under Title 6 was In Bakke.
I say that without meaning to signal any lack of confidence
in our argument that there is a private cause of action9
but again as a procedural matter the Court has practices
which would be applicable to dealing with it.
QUESTION:

Wait a minute.

1 don't understand

what you are saying.

First of all, I didn't understand

the reference to me,

I think it was intended to be with

reference to Mr. Justice White, but that is neither here

73
nor there In the Bakke ease.
What I don’t understand here is what you have
Just told us about whether or not the private right of
action under Title 2, section 2 exists.

As X understand

it, the District Court in this case didn’t rest at all on
the statute.

Is that correct?

MR. SCHNAPPER:

Right, Just like the trial court

in Bakke didn’t rest on the statute.
QUESTION:

And the Court of Appeals relegated

the issue to a footnote, is that also correct?
MR. SCHNAPPER:
QUESTION:

That’s right.

And what does the footnote say?

MR. SCHNAPPER:

As I recall, they didn’t think a

whole lot of the argument, but if I remember there Is a
companion case —
QUESTION:

Well, one of the reasons they didn’t

want —
MR. SCHNAPPER:

— which explains why they did

not seek to —
QUESTION:

One of the reasons they did not hold

onto the argument was they might have thought offhand, my
golly, there is no private right of action under section 2.
MR. SCHNAPPER:
read that into it.
QUESTION:

No.

Well, I don’t think you could

MR. SCHNAPPER:

I am trying to give you an agenda

of the problems in the case and that is one of the issues
you are going to have to sort out.
QUESTION:

I think —

Well* certainly section 2 is not

dispositive and couldn’t be here if there is no private
right of action under section 2.
MR. SCHNAPPERi
QUESTION:

And if

Isn’t that true?

MR. SCHNAPPER:

Yes, that’r gith.

That’s right,

no question about it.
Third, there is a problem raised in both of the
cases here about what was referred to loosely as the twocourt rule.

With regard to what particular cases, I think

particularly Justice Stevens’ questions have pointed out,
we maintain that there le a finding of intentional discrim­
ination, and Mr. Allen tskes the position that if there is
such a finding it isn’t justified on this record.
If the Court ^^•£■re sitting

or you were riding

circuit, of course we would be in a very different.posture
than we are in now, but the normal practice of this Court
and a salutary practice at that is not to get into factual
issues of that sort when they have been resolved by the
lower courts.
The factual record on which the District Court
finding Is based is much more substantial than Mr. Allen

75
suggesta.

There was first direct testimony by members of

the legislature as to the motives of the legislature in
dealinw with redisfcricting legislation there was a long
•

. - U;v'

history of racial discrimination in Alabama; including a
number of cases in which multi-member districting plans
adopted by the state legislature had been held by federal
courts in other cases to have been racially motivated.
And the discriminatory impact of this system among blacks
was not only —- is not only pronounceds it was known to
everybody In the state and the school board at the time.
So this ease presented all the kinds of evidence
which Arlington Heights suggested were relevant to this
kind of inquiry, and we think the District judge had no
choice but to reach the conclusion that he did.
Finally., there is a problem here.* that really
fairly characterises the problem of stare decisus0 and it
goes particularly to whether White v, Regeater is good
law.

The briefs deal with this in somewhat greater length

and the argumenta have until now.
I think the —
QUESTION:

,v

s

|

Which do you mean, still In existence

or good?
MR. SCHNAPPER:
QUESTION:

Pardon me?

Which do you mean, still in existence?

MR. SCHNAPPER:

I think it is both of those things.

76
As w@ have noted in our brief. White v. Regester
was based on a series of decisions before then, it has
been cited with approval in half a dosen decisions 3ince
White, some of them after Washington v. Davis.

White it­

self was a unanimous decision and a decision only sis years
ago, and we think the Court should not entertain a general
practice of reopening recent constitutional decisions and
this one we suggest was in any event quite properly de­
cided.
VJe also note that the argument against for over­
turning White is really to legs.

One of them is that

Washington v. Davis has somehow or other changed the under­
lying law in this area.
\

We have suggested in our briefs

1*

that Washington v. Davis and White v. Regester deal with
two different branches of equal protection law, that
Washington v. Davis is concerned with the branch of equal
protection law forbidding racial classifications, whereas
White v. Regester is part of the Reynolds v. Sims branch
of equal protection law concerning special protections for
<3

particularly important and fundamental rights.
The other basis of the attack on White, and one
which I think has been recurrent in questions before the
Court today, is whether White makes any sense, and I think
our arguments about wouldn’t this all go away if blacks
lived everywhere and can’t blacks be elected in Los Angeles

77
and the lika, all of which on the merits are unpersu&sive.
In the final analysis, they are arguments that White v.
Regester was wrongly decided, and we think that the Court
ought not be entertaining that.

I think you should start

with White f, Regester and we think it would be dispositive
to this litigation,
I would like to turn to another Issue that arose
earlier.

When we were here in the spring, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist asked whether — he raised the following ques­
tion — we were discussing apparently inconsistent state­
ments about the Voting Rights Act.

Attorney General

Katzenbach was quoted by our side as stating that section
2 of the Voting Rights Act encompassed the purpose or
effect standard.

Mr. Justice Rehnqu:l3t noted that Senator

Dirksen had made a remark about section 2 almost meaning
the same thing as the Fifteenth Amendment, and I would
like to return to that because I think it is important,
particularly in view of my position that the statutory
issue ought to be decided first.
If you will revert to the Dirksen quote, you
will notice that it doesn’t happen on the floor of the
Senate, It happens during a hearing, indeed the very hear­
ing, almost at the very hour when Katsenbach testified.
Dirksen was one of the members of the Senate Judiciary
Committee and was, according to the transcript, in the room

78
at the beginning of the hearing.
Dirksen sat there while Katzenbach said section
2 means purpose or effect.

A few pages laters Senator

Dirksen says section 2 means almost the same thing as
the Fifteenth Amendment.
Nowfl either of those people — one has to try
to reconcile those statements and, of course,, one could
reconcile them by accepting our view of the Fifteenth
Amendment.

But 1 think that the government’s footnote

and Justice Stevens’ opinion in Bakke suggest a more
sensible resolution, which is to say that those two state»
ments were regarded by their spokesmen as consistent with
one another because Congress at that point in time regarded
section 2 as incorporating the purpose or effect standard
which they thought was in the Fifteenth Amendment.

And

there Is a passageD Justice Steven's, in your opinion in
Bakke which describes Title VI in the same kind of way,
but suggests that Title VI has independent force and it
doesn’t merely incorporate whatever the Fourteenth Amend­
ment should be held to mean by this Court.
Without wanting to reopen the particular issues
that were in Bakke, I think that method of analysis, how­
ever persuasive, in Bakke is the correct method of analysis
here.
The second thing that comes out when you re-read

79
that passage is the context in which it was made.

As you

will doubtless recalls one of the primary arguments that
was made against the Voting Rights Act was that it was
regional in nature9 that it singled out a group of southern
states for treatment different than the treatment that was
being afforded to the rest of the country»
Senator Dirkssn, in making that remark about
section 2e makes it —• in the context of a paragraph in
which he says look at section 2* section 2 covers Texas —
as you recall, Texas was a big bone of contention because
the President was from Texas and it wasn’t covered —
section 2 covers Texass so Texas is covered by the Voting
Rights Act5 too.
Now, if section 2 is merely the Fifteenth Amend­
ment and a purpose standard* then that statement makes no
sense at all.

But If it —

QUESTION:

The Fifteenth Amendment covers Texas.

What do you mean by that?
MR. SCHNAPPER:

The dispute was about why the

Voting Rights Act didn’t —•
QUESTION:

Section 2 covers each of the fifty

states* and so does the Fifteenth Amendment.
MR. SCHNAPPER:

But the criticism that was being

made about the Voting Rights Act was that section 5 didn’t
apply to all states.

8g
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. SCHNAPPER:

And in responsa to that* Dirksen

said* ah, yes, but section 2 does so the act applies all
over.

Now, if section 2 had no substanfcice force at all,

if it set a different standard in section 5S a lower stand­
ard, the only purpose would give you a cause of action,
then it was — and that was the same standard as the
Fifteenth Amendment — then to say that section 2 covers
Texas, so the act applies there was rathe:? unpersuasive,
because section 2 wasn't —
QUESTION:

It was true, that section 2 covers

every state, whatever it means,
MR. SCHNAPPER:

But it didn't make sense as an

argument unless it meant the same *—
QUESTION:

And the Fifteenth Amendment covers

every state, whatever it means.
MR, SCHNAPPER:

But as an argument to convince

other members of the committee —
QUESTION:

It was a little rhetoric perhaps,

MR. SCHNAPPER:

— well, as rhetoric to convince

other members of the committee that the act was equally
applicable to all states, that only makes sense if the
substantive meaning of section 2 was the same as the sub­
stantive meaning of the provisions which applied to the
southern states

81
And as we have noted In our brief, the history
of the Voting Rights Act reflects great sensitivity on the
part of the Court to the possibility of a regional rule.
We don’t think that it was the intent of Congress except
in the very narrow area which we have noted, having to do
with literacy tests, to create a situation in which the
same sort of districting system would be Illegal in Prince
Edward County, Virginia and legal in Prince George’s County,
Maryland, and w@ don’t think Congress should have presumed
to have made that kind of distinction unless it is crystal
clear that it did*
So that we find that the Dirksen statement is
consistent with the Katsenbach statement and with our view
of the law.
In addition, Justice Stevens, you asked earlier
what the relevance of intent was and it is a rather compli­
cated problem which I would like to deal with very, very
briefly. It is complicated because it is relevant to a
whole host of issues.
QUESTION:

This is a case which presents
I will ask you another question at

the same time, while you —
MR. SCHNAPPER:
QUESTION:

Surely.

Do you think intent was an essential

part of the holding in White v. Rsgester?
the Court relied thei'5@ on impact —

Do you think

82
MR, SCHNAPPER;
irrelevant.

Absolutely not,

It was entirely

As we have laid out in our briefa this Court

has three times described the rule in White as a rule that
means that in these terms is designedly or otherwise
diluting

the black vote.

Whitcomb began with a statement

that it was conceded that there was no discriminatory intent
and then went on to write for four or five pages.

So I

think it is crystal clear that intent was no part of White
v. Regester.
With regard to the relevance of intent here,
this is a case, as we noted in the spring, that raises
five or six different legal theories and intent is of
different relevance to various of them.

With regard to

our claim that this election system is intentionally main­
tained to prevent the election of blacks, the relevant
discriminatory intent is the intent of a people who make
laws.

I phrase it that way because the practical political

control of th® legislative process is rather complicated
and involves primarily the legislative delegation to a
significant extent, in this case the school board itself,
so I don't phrase it in terms of the legislature, but I
think that is consistent with the way you were phrasing
the question earlier.
With regard to our claim under White v, Regester,
it is our position that racial discrimination by the

83
elected officials is of some relevance to proving the
cause of action which we think we have proved her®»

We

don't think it is of much Importance as Zimmer v„ McKeithen
does.

We think that racial discrimination by the all-white

elected government tends to confirm our claim that they are
essentially elected solely by the whites and are solely
responsive to the whites in town.
With regard to our Fifteenth Amendment claim6
in arguing that the Fifteenth Amendment covers discrimina­
tory effects m resorted in particular to the legislative
history of the Fifteenth Amendment@ pointing out that the
framers of that amendment wera concerned to protect not
the right of blacks to put X’a on pieces of paper but to
give blacks a right that would allow them to protect them­
selves from racial discrimination by state and local govern­
ments a particularly at the end of reconstruction which
everybody by 1869 or 18?0 knew was inevitable.
If we are correct in that construction of the
Fifteenth Amendments then it would demonstrate the particu­
lar relevance of the effect meaning cf the Fifteenth, Amend­
ment that the right to vote such as it exists in Mobile for
blacks is clearly not carrying out the effect of Congress,
the intent of Congress.
QUESTION:

Is that view of the Fifteenth Amend­

ment consistent with the court opinion in Vermillion v.

84
Lightfoot?
MR. SCHNAPPER:
described as opaque.

I think Vermillion is fairly

One must recall that at the time

of Vermillion there were decision? of this Court, a line
of decisions which continued up until Palmer ve Thompson
and O’Brien v. United States, which suggested that an
inquiry into the intent of legislatures isere impermissible.
So that as of the date of Vermillion, opinions were being
phrased rather carefully so they didn't exactly find intent
and they didn’t exactly find purpose, they were Just sort
of outraged and said you couldn’t do it, and I think
Vermillion is in that posture®
QUESTION:

Wasn't there a great deal of emphasis

in the Vermillion opinion, which I have not read recently,
upon the fact that this particular — the city boundaries
in that case could only have been attributable to an intent
to disenfranchise non-whites?
MR. SCHNAPPER:

I couldn’t read Vermillion in

that way.
QUESTION:

You do not?

MR. SCHNAPPER:
way.

I don't read Vermillion in that

I mean I think that was the Intent Involved, but I

think that the opinion is phrased to avoid making that
kind of statement.

It would at the time have been quite

arguably improper to make, to put that kind of conclusion

85
of law In an opinion,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

Your time has expired

now, Mr. Schnapper.
MR. SCHNAPPER:

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Allen, I think we

can hear you out before we rise for lunch.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM H. ALLEN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS WILLIAMS ET AL—REBUTTAL
MR. ALLEN:

I think I only have one point and that

is that I hope it is not we who are being accused of thinking
that White v. Regester represents something less than good
law.
0?he fact is that the opening of the analysis in
White v. Regester begins this way:

We have entertained

claims that multi-member districts are being used invidiously
to cancel out or minimise the voting strengths of racial
groups.

To sustain such proof, it is not enough that the

racial group has not had legislative seats in proportion
to its voting potential.
The plaintiffs? burden — paraphrasing now — is
to produce evidence that would support findings that the
political processes leading tc nomination and election are
not equally open to participation by the groups in question,
and that we submit is what was lacking on the proofs
offered in the school district's case here.

86
QUESTION?

Do you think that is equivalent to

purpose or not?
MR. ALLEN:

Excuse roe?

I think that what was

~ that the circumstances which that general rule was ap­
plied in White v. Regester was the equivalent of a purpose
to exclude from participation, yes, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

I take it from what you answered me

before, when you were up before, that if it were satis­
factorily shown that a multi-member district was adopted
or that if it t*as refused to dissolve it for the purpose
of maintaining the effects of racial block/voting, that
you would have a tough time defending —
MR* ALLEN:

X would have a tough time — we have

— I should say this much about White v. Regester.

We

have Indeed urged, although the —
QUESTION:

Because you can have all the legisla­

tive purpose you want, but if the racial block voting
suddenly falls apart and they start voting on the merits MR. ALLEN:

Then you have not affected the dis­

crimination.

MR. ALLEN:

Yes.
That Is quite true.

One would have

One would have to find that the group claim

ing to be disadvantaged was Indeed disadvantaged, to be
sure.

But where all one has is the block voting and a

87
statute neutral In its inception, then it is our position
that that is what is not enough.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 12:00 o’clock noon, the oase3 in
the above-entitled matters were submitted.)
