General Ayotte.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KELLY A. AYOTTE
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. AYOTTE:

Mr. Chief Justice and may

it please the Court:
The Court of Appeals struck down New

11

Hampshire's parental notification act on its face

12

based upon a potential application of the act that even

13

respondents concede may only arise in the smallest

14

fraction of cases.

15

ineffective in the overwhelming number of

16

applications where it is unquestionably

17

constitutional, and State officials were denied the

18

opportunity to imply -- apply and enforce New

19

Hampshire's act within constitutional limits.

20

In doing so, the act was rendered

New Hampshire's act can be applied in a

21

manner to protect a minor's health if the rare case

22

arises where a medical emergency occurs that requires

23

an immediate abortion.

24

arise, where an abortion has to be performed

25

immediately and the child does not want to notify a

In that rare case, if it does

1

parent, there is a judicial bypass mechanism

2

available which requires New Hampshire courts to act

3

promptly and without delay and in the best interests

4

of the minor.

5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

May I interrupt you at

6

this point?

7

sure that I understand about your position, and one

8

way of reading your brief takes you a step beyond

9

what you have just said.

10
11

Because there is one thing that I'm not

So I would like to get

clear on this.
And I understood your argument to be that

12

given the safeguards such as judicial override, there

13

simply was no -- there was no need to read the health

14

exception in, that in fact it was taken care of --

15

any of the issues that might be raised in arguing for

16

the need for health exception in fact were addressed

17

by the statute.

18

The point at which I'm not clear on your

19

position is -- occurs in what you've said on page 11

20

of your yellow brief, if you could get that out.

21

you have the carry over paragraph on 11?

22

through the kind of a worst case analysis.

23

say, well, you know, assuming that all of the

24

safeguards somehow do not work, finally, in the

25

unlikely event that a parent refuses to waive the

Do

You go
And you

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

48-hour waiting period and so on, a doctor who

2

performs an emergency abortion under such

3

circumstances would not be subject to either criminal

4

prosecution or civil liability because his or her

5

conduct would not only be constitutionally protected

6

but would be independently justifiable, and then you

7

cite the competing harms.

8

say it would be constitutionally protected?

9

What do you mean when you

I read that as suggesting that there was

10

indeed a constitutional requirement for some kind of

11

a health exception, but that may not be what you

12

meant.

13

protected?

14

What do you mean by constitutionally
What are you getting at?
MS. AYOTTE:

Justice Souter, in that

15

instance, we did not say that it was an independent

16

constitutional requirement that there be a health

17

exception, but certainly reading this Court's cases,

18

we should apply our act in a manner to protect if

19

that rare case arises where an emergency abortion

20

would come forward.

21

prosecuted under those circumstances, we believe not

22

only would he have a statutory ability to say this

23

prosecution is inappropriate given our law, but also

24

given those rare circumstances, we do not think that

25

he, under the Constitution, may be prosecuted.

And, if a physician were

5
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And if he said, "I may

2

not be prosecuted under the Constitution because,"

3

what follows "because," in your view?

4

MS. AYOTTE:

I may not because New

5

Hampshire's act may not be applied in a manner to

6

ensure that if a minor in that rare circumstance

7

needs an immediate abortion, that she receives that

8

immediate medical care in those circumstances.

9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Doesn't that mean because

10

there is a required health exception?

11

that what you're saying?

12

MS. AYOTTE:

I mean, isn't

Justice Souter, not that

13

there is an express requirement of a health exception

14

but that the law cannot be implied in a manner to

15

infringe on the minor's health if that rare emergency

16

case arises.

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Your first answer to

18

Justice Souter was that the physician would say you

19

can't be prosecuted under our law.

20

act that we're looking at here?

21

law generally including constitutional protections

22

that this Court has proclaimed?

23

MS. AYOTTE:

Do you mean this

Or do you mean the

Justice Kennedy, in that

24

limited circumstance, we do not believe that the

25

physician would be prosecuted under our parental

6
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

notification act, given that there is a mechanism --

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Because of the text of

3

the act or because of some policy that the attorney

4

general would follow in order just to decline to

5

prosecute?

6

instance posed by Justice Souter.

7

MS. AYOTTE:

We want to know what this act says in the

Justice Kennedy, with

8

respect to the act itself, assuming it were a life --

9

excuse me, a health emergency short of a

10

life-threatening emergency, where a minor did not

11

want to notify her parents and assuming those

12

situations came forward and someone was unable to

13

reach a judge, the act itself provides a mechanism in

14

it that anticipates providing a judge where

15

necessary, and so that would be the ability of a

16

minor in those circumstances to seek a judge.

17

But if for some reason all of those

18

situations came together and the minor could not seek

19

a judicial bypass in those instances, there is an

20

existing provision of New Hampshire law, our

21

competing harms defense, that we believe protects the

22

physician in those circumstances.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

Let's just imagine a real

24

circumstance.

25

morning on Saturday into the emergency room and the

A 15 year-old walks in 2:00 in the

7
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

doctor looks at her, she's pregnant, she has this

2

very high blood pressure, whatever.

3

thinks to himself, he thinks, well, immediate

4

abortion, no question, immediately deliver the child.

5

If I don't, I don't think she's going to die but

6

she'll never have children.

7

And he's thinking that.

8

to happen?

9

Livingston and there is no answer.

And the doctor

What's supposed

He calls up Pam Pevagoglio or Pam
It's 2:00 in the

10

morning and there is one of those things, leave a

11

message, okay?

12

They don't know I'm pregnant.

13

to happen?

14

Should I call your parents?

MS. AYOTTE:

No.

Now, what's supposed

Justice Breyer, the

15

physician in those instances could perform the

16

immediate abortion.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

It doesn't say that in

18

the statute.

19

the particular provision of New Hampshire law that

20

tells that -- I mean, the doctor -- all these things

21

are, you know, questions of probability.

22

doesn't want to risk being prosecuted and he doesn't

23

want to risk losing his license.

24

particular provision -- he happens to have his lawyer

25

with him.

It suggests the contrary.

So what is

And he

And so what

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

(Laughter.)

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

What does the lawyer say?

3

Okay?

4

no health exemption in this statute.

5

What's the provision that saves him?

MS. AYOTTE:

There is

Your Honor, his lawyer

6

would advise him, in those circumstances, that the

7

competing harms defense would protect his actions

8

because he needs to act urgently necessary -- in an

9

urgently necessary circumstance.

10

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Would it protect him

11

from a civil damages action as well as prosecution in

12

a criminal case?

13

MS. AYOTTE:

Justice O'Connor, by the

14

plain language of the competing harms defense, it

15

also precludes civil liability.

16

that lawyer would also advise him, if given the

17

opportunity, the attorney general is prepared also to

18

issue an opinion describing the applicability of the

19

competing harms defense in this very rare

20

circumstance, should it arise.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

I would also say that

How do we know?

I mean,

22

what you're saying is fine, but how do we know that

23

that's actually the law?

24

people who absolutely in very good faith would say

25

that it isn't competing harm.

I mean, there are a lot of

They would say that

9
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

the competing right that the life of the fetus is more

2

important than the possibility of the mother having

3

children in the future herself.

4

See, there are people in good faith on

5

both sides of this argument.

6

that the New Hampshire statute is going to do -- not

7

the statute, but your competing harms defense is

8

going to do for this particular woman what a health

9

exception would do?

10

MS. AYOTTE:

And so how do we know

Justice Breyer, because

11

the harm that is being weighed here is the harm of

12

urgently providing care to this minor who needs it,

13

as opposed to the harm that the act is trying to get

14

at, which is notification of parents.

15

whether or not the minor can have an abortion.

16

minor can always go forward and have an abortion

17

under these circumstances.

It's not
The

18

So people aren't weighing the right of the

19

fetus, in this instance, to the right of the mother's

20

health.

21

the opportunity, my office would be prepared to issue

22

an opinion as to the applicability of this defense.

23

So the weighing is quite easy.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And if given

But, your opinion --

24

that's the real problem here for the doctor who is on

25

the line.

And you said the lawyer would say, oh,

10
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

you've got this defense of -- what do you call it harm --

2

JUSTICE SOUTER:

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Competing harm.
Competing harms, a defense --

4

I think that a lawyer who cares about his client

5

would say, defense is not what we want.

6

is there is no claim, not that you have to put up a defense

7

and maybe the attorney general will give us a

8

letter saying that we come under that defense.

9

Wouldn't a careful lawyer say, what you need to be

10

protected is that there is no claim for doing what

11

you're doing?

12

MS. AYOTTE:

What we want

Justice Ginsburg, in the

13

Simopoulos case considered by this Court, one of

14

the issues that was raised was a medical -- the

15

physician was prosecuted for performing an abortion

16

outside the parameters of the Virginia act.

17

physician failed to raise a medical necessity defense.

18

This Court held that that was sufficient prosecution,

19

that that was okay.

20

Once the physician raises a competing harms defense --

21

And the

And this would work the same way.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

General, may I just point

22

this -- suppose the lawyer or the doctor are aware of

23

the legislative history and say, well, generally that's

24

true.

25

suggests that the legislature considered this very

But when you have a legislative history that

11
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

defense and rejected it in the statute, would then that

2

then give them some concern?

3

MS. AYOTTE:

Justice Stevens, the

4

legislative history -- there certainly was some

5

indication that the legislature did not want a

6

general health exception.

7

the legislative history that the legislature intended

8

to preclude this narrow category of cases which

9

constitute emergency cases short of that.

10

There is no indication in

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But if they discussed

11

the issue on the floor of the legislature, why

12

wouldn't they have drafted the precise protection

13

they thought appropriate?

14

MS. AYOTTE:

Your Honor, when they

15

discussed the history on the floor of the House and

16

Senate, they felt that it protected for emergencies

17

and there was no discussion of this narrow category

18

of cases short of death.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And you have another

20

point here, don't you, about how general this statute

21

is.

22

that they are totally invalid if any application of

23

them would be unconstitutional.

24

with statutes normally, is it?

25

We don't normally interpret statutes this way,

MS. AYOTTE:

That's not what we do

Justice Scalia, no.

In

12
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

fact, the analysis, if you look at this one potential

2

application, this -- the standard applied by the

3

Court of Appeals in this case goes well beyond even a

4

substantial overbreadth test that is applied by this

5

Court in the first amendment context.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

In the first amendment.
Am I right in

8

reading your briefs that you don't object to a

9

pre-enforcement challenge to the bypass procedure

10

itself brought by physicians, for example?

11

MS. AYOTTE:

Mr. Chief Justice, no, we

12

do not object in that sense.

13

good mechanism to bring forth a case given that this

14

Court has granted third-party standing to physicians

15

to resolve these types of claims.

And teh benefit --

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And I gather that

We think that is a very

17

the debate on the evidence and the circumstances that

18

might arise in that case would be quite similar to

19

the debate in the present context.

20

there would be the same discussion between the

21

different physicians about what emergencies arise and

22

in what circumstances and whether that creates a

23

problem and whether you can get to the courts in time

24

and so on.

25

evidence that we have here, right?

In other words,

It would be the same underlying sort of

13
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

MS. AYOTTE:

Mr. Chief Justice, it

2

would, but it would be much more narrowly focused in

3

terms of bringing it as an as-applied challenge, this

4

was brought --

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How would it be

6

as-applied?

7

you've made it very clear, and I think that it is helpful

8

that you did, that there could be this pre-enforcement

9

action by doctors who would not have to wait until faced

10

Look at your reply brief at page 3.

And

with an actual medical emergency to bring the suit.

11

You've talking about this small category of

12

cases, but I take it from what you have read -- what the

13

lines I've just read, that you envision a doctor who says,

14

sooner or later, I'm going to have such a case.

15

now, I don't know and I can't know until it's too late to

16

come to any court, so I'm going to bring this

17

pre-enforcement which you characterized as-applied.

18

don't see how its as-applied, if if the physician just

19

says, as you put it, I don't have to wait until faced with

20

an actual medical emergency to bring this suit.

21

is the relief, what is the lawsuit that you envision would

22

be proper?

23

MS. AYOTTE:

Right

But I

So what

Justice Ginsburg, the

24

lawsuit would be a pre-enforcement as-applied

25

challenge and the physician would bring the claim and

14
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

would say, as applied to me, I perform abortions, I

2

also perform abortions on minors.

3

an abortion in these emergency settings.

4

can issue an order, presuming it's not satisfied with

5

the protections that are set forth in New Hampshire

6

law that I've described.

7
8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The court

Could you do that as a

class action?

9
10

I need to perform

MS. AYOTTE:

Depending on the

circumstance, he may be able to.

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What is the

12

circumstance?

13

pre-enforcement challenge by doctors who would not have to

14

wait until faced with an actual medical emergency.

15

All you said here is there coule be a

MS. AYOTTE:

Justice -- I'm sorry.

16
17
18

JUSTICE STEVENS:
case?

Why isn't that this

I don't understand.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

20

MS. AYOTTE:

Yes, exactly.

Justice Stevens, this is

21

not this case because this case was brought as a

22

facial challenge.

23

based upon that one potential --

24
25

Our entire act was struck down

JUSTICE STEVENS:

You mean he has to bring the

as-applied challenge when he has the patient in

15
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

his office?

2

in the office, is that what you mean?

3

He has to wait until he has the patient

MS. AYOTTE:

No, he doesn't.

He can

4

bring it before the patient is in his office and then

5

the court could issue relief which would be much more

6

consistent with the principles of certainly separation of

7

powers and allowing the overwhelming number of our

8

applications of our statutes that are valid to go

9

forward.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

We're talking about a

11

lawsuit which asks for declaration, not that the

12

entire statute is invalid.

13

an emergency of the sort that this discussion has

14

addressed, the physician can go ahead and perform the

15

abortion?

16
17
18
19
20

MS. AYOTTE:

But that, when faced with

That's correct, Justice

Scalia.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Quite a different lawsuit

from this one.
MS. AYOTTE:

That's quite a different

21

lawsuit and a lawsuit that would be certainly, from

22

the State's perspective, would allow the overwhelming

23

number of applications of this statute where there is

24

no dispute that it works well, to go forward.

25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But in Justice Scalia's

16
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

case, would not the reason for that relief have to be

2

a finding that the statute is unconstitutional?

3

can't just grant the relief because you think it's a

4

good idea.

5

MS. AYOTTE:

You

Justice Stevens, it would

6

be only in the context of that one particular

7

application as applied to that physician, which would

8

have stare decisis --

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It would be a

10

finding that the bypass procedure is inadequate which

11

doesn't necessarily implicate the general

12

notification provisions.

13

MS. AYOTTE:

Mr. Chief Justice, that

14

would be the case.

15

application, in that one potential rare case was

16

found not to be valid, then the remainder of the

17

applications can go forward.

18

cases work with respect to as-applied relief.

19

And certainly if that one

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And that is how most

Then I think what you're

20

saying essentially is that the First Circuit was concerned

21

with this category, wanted to give pre-enforcement relief

22

to the physician, so what they did was write except that

23

they should have said this statute is not

24

enforceable where there is a risk to the woman's health

25

and it cannot be applied in any such cases.

Where there

17
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1
2

is a risk to the health, then the statute is okay.
MS. AYOTTE:

Justice Ginsburg, the

3

First Circuit went well beyond because it focused on

4

a general health exception, they've now focusing it on an

5

emergency exception.

6

have been as-applied.

7

my time for rebuttal?

10

But certainly the relief should
If I may reserve the rest of

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Did you ask that the

relief ordered below be more restrictive?

Was that

challenged after the judgment was entered?

11

MS. AYOTTE:

12

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Justice -Did the Court below

13

have a chance to consider tailoring it more narrowly,

14

as you suggest today?

15

MS. AYOTTE:

Justice O'Connor, we did

16

raise the application of the severance clause below,

17

was a large fraction of the applications of the

11

statute that would give rise to the constitutional

problem.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, we may argue about

14

what the fraction may be and we may argue about what

15

substantiality means.

16

can argue about is that Casey was applying the

17

Salerno standard.

But one thing I don't think we

Well, two things,

Justice Souter.

20

come up postured as being about a choice between

21

Salerno and the large fraction test.

22

some points, based on the way respondents have

23

approached the case, that's become largely beside the

24

point.

25

I think, first of all, this case has

exception or an emergency exception clear on its face,

6

it is void in its entirety.

7

They instead are embracing a per

Once again, that may be,

8

but after Casey, I don't think one can plausibly

argue that the Salerno standard is the correct

10

standard.

12

Whatever their position may be, whatever

Well, I understand

13

that's your position, Justice Souter, given that you

joined Justice O'Connor's separate separate writing in

the Fargo case.

16

opinion in Casey and I see the large fraction

17

analysis only in the spousal notification context.

18

I think, however, that I read the

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But why would we have a

19

separate rule on facial challenges merely for spousal

20

notification?

21

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, I can think of

22

two reasons, Justice Souter.

23

because this Court applied the no set of

24

circumstances test in Akron II to a parental

25

notification statute, this Court in Casey may not

First of all,

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

2

have wanted to overrule Akron II to that extent.
Second of all, I think this Court, in that

3

very passage about the large fraction test,

4

specifically distinguished spousal notification

5

provisions from parental notification provisions.

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Suppose I were to

7

conclude that under Casey, this fraction test applies

8

to this case.

9

should not be applicable in this case.

10
11

Suppose I were to say that Salerno
How should I

rule in this case?
GENERAL CLEMENT:

You should clearly rule

12

in the State's favor.

13

really given you no choice because they aren't even

14

arguing that a large fraction of the applications of

15

the statute are invalid.

And the respondents have

16

What you have before you is really a case

17

where it's literally a one in a thousand possibility

18

that there is going to be an emergency where the statute

19

will operate.

20

faced with that kind of case.

21

applications of this statute noting that 999 of

22

them are constitutional?

23

And the real question for you is

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Do you invalidate 1,000

Could the plaintiffs have

24

filed a narrower action attacking the adequacy of the

25

bypass procedure?

22
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Absolutely.

And they

2

also could have -- what I think I would envision

3

them filling is an even narrower provision that

4

seeks a pre-enforcement declaration, kind of like

5

Steffel against Thompson would be the model, that say

6

that this statute can apply in an emergency situation.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now, that's exactly --

8

I'm leaving aside your fraction test, your 100

9

percent test, because I don't think they capture all

10

the considerations that are relevant.

11

you just said.

12

create an injunction that will separate out the sheep

13

from the goats, all right?

14

1 percent and the sheep -- But what does it say? I

15

don't think you can say enjoin the bypass procedure,

16

because if you enjoin the bypass procedure, there goes

17

down the drain your whole parental notification because

18

you can't have parental notification without a bypass

19

procedure.

20

Focus on what

What you've done is you've tried to

The goats are only

I don't think you can say enjoin

21

emergencies because to do that, you're going to have

22

to get into the greatest difficult issue there is in

23

this area, which is what does that health exception

24

mean.

25

exception has to be defined first by a legislature.

And we've said throughout that that health

23
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

So if you tell me how to write that

2

injunction, then I'll be able to decide whether it's

3

possible for a court just to say, okay, we only

4

enjoin the goats as opposed to saying, legislature,

5

this is basically up to you, the whole area.

GENERAL CLEMENT:

formulates that order.

this statute is not constitutional as applied to

given the fact that lots of people think health

2

exception is a way of getting abortion on demand.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Do you agree with Justice

4

Breyer that the legislature can draw this with more

5

precision than a court could?

6

GENERAL CLEMENT:

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, I don't Justice Scalia.
I mean, that seems to be

8

a solution, that the legislature can make it precise,

9

although a court could not.

10

GENERAL CLEMENT:

I think the court could

11

issue any order a legislature could issue.

12

think the fact that the court would have some

13

discretion is an answer to the argument that, oh,

14

well, if you leave this to the courts, you're cutting

15

the legislature out of this.

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And I

I think that -Why wouldn't it be an

17

abuse of discretion in this case?

18

seems to be an ample record here that the

19

legislature, or a majority of the legislature made a

20

conscious choice that they would rather have no

21

statute than a statute with a health exception in it.

22

They deliberately said the only statute we want is

23

one without a health exception.

25

Because there

was -- even had the belt and suspenders to worry about

that if you had a different view of that, it's the view

that actually Justice Thomas embraced in his Booker

The unfortunate reality is that some

pregnant teens experience medical emergencies for

14

which the appropriate care is an immediate abortion.

15

As the nation's leading medical authorities have

explained, delaying appropriate care for even a very

risk for liver damage, kidney damage, stroke and

Court in Casey addressed that consideration.

19

Casey was essentially this case, a pre-enforcement

20

challenge brought to the adequacy of the medical

21

emergency exception.

22

law prohibited an immediate abortion for some of the

23

very same conditions we outline here, it would have

24

been unconstitutional.

25

And

And this Court held that if the

present in the large fraction of cases.

MS. DALVEN:

We don't know

Respectfully, Your Honor, not

think that was true with respect to the spousal

7

notice provision, but not at all with respect to the

8

medical emergency exception.

9

I

In this case, it was -- we're talking about

10

the same conditions that were in Casey and here as well.

11

And actually here there were additional considerations

12

because in Casey, there was a medical emergency

13

definition that extended to some health threatening

14

circumstances and here there is none.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So why wouldn't it be

16

entirely adequate to protect what you're concerned

17

about to say this New Hampshire statute is

18

unconstitutional to the extent that it fails to

19

provide an exception for situations where there is

20

imminent danger to health, and then all those

21

immediate dangers to health situations would be left

22

unregulated.

23

The statute doesn't reach them.

But nonemergency cases would continue to

24

be governed by the statute.

the First Circuit to have entered in this case, to

2

say statutes fine for nonemergency cases, but for

3

emergency cases, there is effectively no law?

4

MS. DALVEN:

Your Honor, that would solve

5

the constitutional problem in this case, but I

6

believe it is not the best course for three reasons.

7

First, as this Court has already discussed, the States

8

around the country have adopted at least 10 different

9

medical emergency definitions.

10

And this Court has no

way to know which if any of those formulations --

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you wouldn't

12

have -- it would be that the emergency is not

13

regulated.

The private doctors can act in a medical

14

emergency.

They are not controlled by any

15

legislation.

16

MS. DALVEN:

Yes, Your Honor.

But many of

17

the States -- a few States have chosen to have

18

special exceptions that just say medical emergency.

19

Most of them define --

20

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

But we're dealing with

21

New Hampshire.

23

this one?

24
25

We have a specific case that

MS. DALVEN:

So can you focus on

Yes, Your Honor.

I think we

still don't know which definition New Hampshire

37
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1

would use.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, suppose it were from

3

your point of view.

4

I don't know from the other side's point of view, I

5

guess it would satisfy you to say that this statute can

6

not be enforced in any circumstance in which a

7

physician certifies in good faith that he believes an

8

immediate abortion is necessary for the health of the

9

mother.

10

All you're looking to is the state of mind

of the physician.

11

Now, the problem that I think we would see

12

with that is you would then be writing into the law

13

the broadest possible definition of what that health

14

exception means.

15

Hampshire legislator would have wanted to do it and

16

I'm not sure the other side would like to do it.

17

looking at it from your point of view, do you have

18

any objection to it?

19

So I'm not sure the New

MS. DALVEN:

But

No, that's correct, Your Honor.

20

That would solve the constitutional problem here, but

21

Your Honor is right, I think there is a significant

22

concern about whether that's what New Hampshire would

23

have done --

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but that

would be litigated in a pre-enforcement, as-applied

this narrower focused proceeding is going to be --

4

question of how it's going to come out.

5

I mean, you don't assume -- the fact that

But presumably the litigation would be

6

very similar to what we've seen in this case, in

7

which a doctor is saying, well, you do need an

8

immediate medical exception.

9

judicial bypass adequately addresses the concerns.

Others are saying the

causing you concern rather than the statute as a

whole.

we only want a declaration that the statute is

invalidation.

objection by you to remanding this thing to let it be

better course for three reasons.

I don't want you to agree

2

to this unless you've focused on it and think it

really is your position.

listening, that you would not object to an injunction

5

that says that this statute cannot be applied in any

6

circumstance where a doctor, in good faith, himself

7

or herself, believes that there is a health

emergency, period.

I take it, as I'm

9

Now, I take it as soon as we get more

10

narrow than that, you might object on the ground

11

that that will leave ambiguous cases where there

really is a health emergency, but the doctor doesn't

13

know what to do and would have to go to court, by

which time it will be too late.

that that is inappropriate.

abdication point, we believe that facially

eliminate any incentive for legislatures to pass

As Justice Souter pointed out, we don't

politics, it's not at all surprising.

And they refuse on principle to vote for any broader

3

exception, any ban, any restriction that has a

4

broader exception.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Then they shouldn't have

6

voted for the severability provision which clearly

7

says if, in one of its applications, it's invalid,

8

the rest can be given effect without the invalid

9

provisions.

I mean, the severability provision

10

really just flatly contradicts your assertion that

11

the New Hampshire legislature wouldn't want this to

12

happen.

13

MS. DALVEN:

Your Honor, a few things.

14

First, we don't believe that the severability clause

15

directs the court to sever applications.

16

neither this Court nor New Hampshire courts treat

17

severability clauses as mandates.

18

still whether, if there is significant doubt about

19

whether the legislature would have wanted it, they do

20

not sever, and as particularly whereas here, this

21

Court would have to make decisions for the legislature

22

about what that exception should look like.

different statute that would solve the problems?

MS. DALVEN:

They have not, Your Honor.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, maybe they

11

assumed that the medical health exception of the sort

12

you're arguing for is not constitutionally required

13

and that's what would be litigated in a narrow

14

focused challenge on the adequacy or inadequacy of a

15

bypass procedure.

16

the Salerno precedent, and they didn't have to worry

17

about severing in light of particular

18

unconstitutional applications.

19

Maybe they assumed it would follow

MS. DALVEN:

Perhaps that is true, Your

20

Honor, but I still believe that that is this case,

21

that there really is no different -- I mean, in

22

Casey, the plaintiffs brought a facial challenge

23

before the law took effect to the adequate --

challenging the adequacy of a medical emergency

And this Court indicated that if the law

prohibited an immediate abortion for women with the

conditions Dr. Goldner described in his declaration

relief would have been appropriate, even though that
