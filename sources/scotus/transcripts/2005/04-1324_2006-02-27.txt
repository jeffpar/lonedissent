CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

Mr. Busby.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. BRETT BUSBY

7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

8

10

MR. BUSBY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The State does not dispute that it waived

11

the affirmative defense of limitations by failing to

12

raise it in the District Court and by conceding in its

13

answer that Day's petition was timely.

14

year into the case, after the parties had briefed the

15

merits, the magistrate judge not only raised an

16

argument that the petition was untimely, he actually

17

imposed the State's limitations defense and dismissed

18

the case, despite the State's procedural default and

19

contrary concession.

20

Yet, nearly a

That was error, for two reasons.

First, it

21

violates the general principle of the adversary system

22

in the civil rules that it's error to impose a

23

forfeited limitations defense sua sponte, and the

24

statutory text in rules have confirmed that this

25

principle applies to habeas.

Second, the State's

3
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

concession of timeliness based on full information was

2

an express binding waiver, and it was error for the

3

District Court to override that concession.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It was a computation

5

error.

6

State chose to waive the statute of limitations.

7

miscalculated.

8
9

This is not a -- this is not a case where the
It

Isn't that the case?

MR. BUSBY:

Well, there was a 1-day

miscalculation, Justice Ginsburg, on the -- on the 352

10

versus 353 days before the -- Mr. Day filed his State

11

postconviction petition.

12

as to whether the days after -- between the time --

13

whether the --

14

But there's a legal dispute

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But we're not -- and we

15

didn't take cert to decide if this claim was timely.

16

We are on the assumption that it was untimely.

17

and what are the consequences of the State's failing

18

to raise that?

19

MR. BUSBY:

But --

Well, our position is that by

20

expressly conceding in their petition that it was

21

timely, that that's an express waiver.

22

say that they would have -- what they would have had

23

to say was, "We know we have a limitations defense.

24

We're expressly giving that up, that the proper

25

standard is the intentional relinquishment of" --

I mean, they

Washington, DC 20005

1

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

2

MR. BUSBY:

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But the --

-- "a known right."
-- the whole basis was

4

the number of days that they calculated, and the

5

magistrate said, "Oh, they miscalculated.

6

more days involved."

7

MR. BUSBY:

There were

The -- yes, under Eleventh

8

Circuit law, the magistrate said they should have

9

counted that additional time at the end.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

11

MR. BUSBY:

Yes.

But this Court has said that the

12

standard for -- the standard for express waiver

13

varies, depending on the right at stake.

14

always intentional relinquishment of a known right, as

15

it is with some constitutional rights.

16

It's not

In fact, there are several Courts of Appeals

17

that have said when you plead -- when you

18

affirmatively plead the opposite of an affirmative

19

defense, as they did here by saying it's timely, that

20

that's enough for an express waiver.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

22

MR. BUSBY:

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And --

Suppose --

-- this Court -Suppose the magistrate

24

judge had said, "I notice this error in accordance

25

with Eleventh Circuit law, so I am going to suggest to

5
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1

the State that they amend their answer."

2

certainly could -- under Rule 15, if the Federal rules

3

apply, the State could have amended its answer and

4

done just what the magistrate judge did.

5

MR. BUSBY:

The State

Well, certainly, Your Honor,

6

they could have moved to amend their answer.

7

have opposed it; and would, on remand, if the issue

8

were to come up, on the ground that they had full

9

information, and so that this is not an appropriate

We would

10

case to amend an answer.

11

that would have been one option, and that's the way

12

that the Third Circuit analyzes this issue in the Long

13

case and in the Bendolph case, using the principles of

14

Rule 15.

15

that here.

16

the court to impose the limitations defense; it did

17

not apply the Rule 15 --

But I agree with you that

The Fifth -- the Eleventh Circuit did not do

-- analysis.
Did it say "an

21

obligation," or that the court "could"?

22

I didn't think it said the court "must."

23

MR. BUSBY:

It didn't --

It did say, Your Honor, that

24

there was an obligation for the court to impose it to

25

further comity, finality, and federalism, and that can

6
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

be found on page 5(a) of the appendix to the petition,

2

"A Federal Court that sits in collateral review has an

3

obligation to enforce the Federal statute of

4

limitations."

5

Committee notes to Rule 4, saying the court has the

6

duty to screen out.

7

distinguished their precedent in Esslinger versus

8

Davis, which relied on Granberry versus Greer, to say

9

it was a discretionary analysis.

And, in fact, they quote the Advisory

And they also expressly

They said, "We're

10

not going to consider the discretionary issues raised

11

in Esslinger and Granberry whether this dismissal

12

would serve an important Federal interest.

13

going to say there's an obligation to impose this, and

14

that the District" --

15
16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Where is -- I see --

you're referring to page 4(a) and --

17

MR. BUSBY:

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

19

We're just

5(a), Your Honor.
Yes.

Which -- where is

the sentence that says it -- that --

20

MR. BUSBY:

The obligation is seven lines

21

from the bottom, and it's that last paragraph, where

22

they're distinguishing Esslinger.

23

the previous paragraph is where they say there's a

24

"duty."

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And the sentence of

I thought that that duty

7
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

is in connection with Rule 4.

2

MR. BUSBY:

Yes, Your Honor, and then they -

3

- they rely on that duty to say that there is an

4

obligation, in the next paragraph, and to

5

distinguishing Essingler and say, "We don't have to go

6

through this discretionary analysis, because there's

7

an obligation."

8

And so, our position is that even --

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So, the -- it's right that

10

there's an obligation if it notices it in the first

11

instance on its first review.

12

MR. BUSBY:

Well, we don't necessarily

13

agree, Your Honor, if -- we don't necessarily agree

14

that --

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And suppose, under the

16

review proceedings, that District Court is looking at

17

it for the first time, without yet having required a

18

response, and he sees a statute of limitation.

19

assume there's an obligation.

20

MR. BUSBY:

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MR. BUSBY:

Under Rule 4?
Sure.

Well, Your Honor, if you'd look

at what rule -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

an open-and-shut violation of the statute of

Washington, DC 20005

1

limitations, or barred by the statute of limitations -

2

-

3

MR. BUSBY:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

5

-- does District Court

have discretion to refer to the State for a response?

6
7

Uh-huh.

MR. BUSBY:
that

Yes, Your Honor, we would say

--

8

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

9

MR. BUSBY:

Really?

-- that they must do that,

10

because, as this Court recognized in Pliler versus

11

Ford, it's almost never apparent on the face of the

12

petition --

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

14

MR. BUSBY:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

16

MR. BUSBY:

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

19

No, my --

-- that there's an -No, my --

-- open-and-shut --- my hypothetical is that

it is.
MR. BUSBY:

Okay.

I would think that even

20

if it were apparent on the face of the petition, that

21

the -- Rule 4 has two parts.

22

the nonadversary screening function, only applies when

23

the petitioner is plainly not entitled to relief.

24

I think the better view of that -- of that clause is -

25

- although there are some arguments in our brief that

In the first part of it,

And

9
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

don't take this view -- I -- after having given it

2

thought, I think the better view of that clause is

3

that it does not apply to an affirmative defense

4

that's subject to waiver or tolling, that you can't

5

say, based on an affirmative defense that's subject to

6

waiver or tolling, that someone is plainly not

7

entitled to relief.

8
9
10

You could say, for example --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Because the other --

because the other side might make a mistake and not
recognize it?

11

MR. BUSBY:

Or it might be tolled, Your

12

Honor.

13

dates in the statute for when it can first apply, that

14

you aren't going to be able to tell, necessarily,

15

three of them from the face of the petition.

16

And there are also four different trigger

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Or the other side may say,

17

"Although technically the statute of limitations

18

applied here, taking all considerations into account

19

we think that this prisoner acted with reasonable

20

promptness, and perhaps the delay was somewhat

21

attributable to the State."

22

a proper consideration?

23

MR. BUSBY:

Do you think that that's

Absolutely, Your Honor.

There -

24

- the statute of limitations in AEDPA is designed to

25

prevent delay, not to -- as Congress has said, it's

10
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

not a forfeiture provision; it's designed to move

2

these complaints along speedily, particularly in

3

capital cases, of which this is not one.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But you -- it could be

5

argued that the Federal Government wants to move them

6

along speedily, whether or not the State government

7

wants to.

8

MR. BUSBY:

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Certainly.

And their --

So, that would suggest that

10

the State's voluntary waiver of a statute of

11

limitations should not make any difference.

12

Federal -- it's a Federal interest involved, not a

13

State interest.

14

MR. BUSBY:

It's a

Well, they -- there is an

15

interest in judicial efficiency that's at issue here,

16

too, but we submit that it's far more inefficient for

17

the Court to put limitations under this first category

18

of Rule 4 and say that the Court must, on its own,

19

look at limitations every time, without assistance

20

from the parties, than it is to make the State do its

21

job.

I mean, they're the ones, as this --

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

23

MR. BUSBY:

24

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

25

Well, we could --

-- Court recognized --- we could -- we could

agree with you that there is isn't an obligation on

11
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

the Federal judge to raise it, but the question is,

2

you know, the -- it could be a "must," it can be "may

3

not," or it could be "may."

4

MR. BUSBY:

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes, Your Honor.
And why shouldn't we

6

treat this as a "may"?

7

error and called it to the party's attention by an

8

order to show cause.

9

MR. BUSBY:

The judge noticed the clerical

Well, the proper procedure under

10

Rule 4 is not to call it to the party's attention in

11

that way; it's --

12
13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

because an answer has been ordered.

14

MR. BUSBY:

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

16

We're past Rule 4,

Yes, Your Honor.
So -- and it's only when

the answer comes in that this issue is spotted.

17

MR. BUSBY:

Yes.

That's correct.

And I

18

agree with you that the proper procedure after that

19

would be to bring the issue to the party's attention

20

and let the State decide whether it wanted to file a

21

motion to amend under Rule 15; and, if it did so,

22

there are very clear standards that are applied, that

23

were not applied in this case, to decide --

24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There are very what

standards?

12
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. BUSBY:
Your Honor --

4

There are very clear standards,

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes, "leave shall be

freely given."

5

MR. BUSBY:

Yes, but there are also -- it's

6

a -- again, it's a discretionary determination, and

7

there are prejudice issues that should be considered

8

as the --

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, what would be the

10

prejudice that could be claimed by the habeas

11

petitioner?

12

MR. BUSBY:

Well, the prejudice in this case

13

is that the standards of Rule 15 were not considered;

14

but, in addition, there are -- there are well-

15

recognized decisions, both from this Court and from

16

the Courts of Appeals, that went -- that says a judge

17

may deny leave to amend when the -- at the time the

18

concession is made.

had all the information it needed to make the

later.

25

analysis, that it would not be appropriate for the

JUSTICE ALITO:

3

MR. BUSBY:

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

Are you --

Now, also -Are you saying that the

5

error is simply that it wasn't done via Rule 15?

6

if we were to say that the same considerations apply

7

when it's simply raised sua sponte by the -- by the --

8

by the District Court?

9

to that?

10

MR. BUSBY:

What

What would be your objection

Well, that would be -- that's

11

the Respondent's position, and I think, in addition to

12

those considerations, if you disagree that this is a

13

forfeiture, that -- and you disagree that this is an

14

express waiver, and you get to their position that,

15

you know, this is a discretionary test and you should

16

just apply the same Rule 15 factors, I think you need

17

to also apply a presumption against sua sponte

18

consideration.

19

There's one way to do it under Rule 4, and

20

that's the most efficient way.

21

comports with judicial neutrality in the adversary

22

system.

23

It's also the way that

And so, to encourage people -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you couldn't do this

24

under Rule 4, because, as you, I think, recognized,

25

that, just from the petition, from the habeas

14
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

petition, you couldn't tell.

MR. BUSBY:

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

4

MR. BUSBY:

I'm sorry, Justice -There wasn't --

-- Ginsburg, I misspoke.

I

5

meant to say Rule 15.

6

to do this under Rule 15, the Court should adopt a

7

presumption against sua sponte consideration.

8

this -- in Arizona versus California, which they rely

9

on heavily, they say that this type of consideration

But if -- to encourage parties

And

10

should be reserved for rare circumstances.

11

cite several cases in our brief where that -- that

12

also support that proposition.

13

if you do get to this analysis, Justice Alito, that

14

there should also be a presumption involved.

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

And we

So, we would submit,

Well, if you think it's --

16

if it's done under Rule 15, would the considerations

17

necessarily be exactly the same in a habeas case as in

18

an ordinary civil case?

19

MR. BUSBY:

Not necessarily.

I mean, there

20

-- but we do submit that the timing issue that we just

21

raised, about them having full information, would

22

certainly be something we'd argue to the District

23

Court in its discretion.

24

to consider, to your point, is that limitations is

25

something that's -- that has a subtle meaning and

But another thing you have

Washington, DC 20005

1

derive -- and is directly addressed by Civil Rules 8

2

and 12.

3

that when that happens, that's where you start, with

4

the civil rules.

5

in the habeas statutes or rules that's inconsistent

6

with that approach, with the -- with the forfeiture

7

approach of the civil rules.

8

And this Court, in Gonzalez and Mayle, says

And then you ask if there's anything

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

9

allow for amendment.

10

MR. BUSBY:

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

12

12(b), but there's also 15.

13

MR. BUSBY:

Yes, but the civil rules

Yes, Your Honor.
There's 8(c), and there's

Yes, I agree.

And that was not

14

used in this case.

15

would be an appropriate way to raise this.

16

I -- and I -- we agree that that

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It seems the height of

17

technicality to say that the judge could suggest,

18

"Now, State, I will entertain a motion to amend the

19

answer, under Rule 15," instead of saying, "I'm

20

issuing an order to show cause why this action is not

21

out of time."

22

MR. BUSBY:

Well, I don't agree, Your Honor,

23

because there's a specific analysis that goes along

24

with Rule 15 that wasn't applied here.

25

addition to that, there's an efficiency interest to be

doesn't put the State in the position of being an

13

advocate -- excuse me -- it doesn't put the Court in

14

the position of being an advocate for the State and

you could wrap it all into the ruling and evaluate

that for abuse of discretion.

10

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I think

I suppose it might be an

abuse of discretion if you'd already had a hearing and

12

took -- and decided that there was merit to the

plaintiff's claim, and then decided, "Well, now I'm

going to just throw it out on limitations," might be

an abuse of discretion.

MR. BUSBY:

I would agree with that, yes,

Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, then why

19

doesn't that same standard apply to the decision of

20

the Court to raise it sua sponte?

21

MR. BUSBY:

Well, because in this case you

22

have an express concession.

23

Court has said, and other courts have said, that when

24

you have an express concession, it's error to override

25

that concession and impose the defense sua sponte.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. BUSBY:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Were those --

-- don't want to strip --- cases -- were those

cases of a miscalculation on the part of the State?

8

The judge's view was that the State had miscalculated

9

under eleventh-amendment -- under Eleventh Circuit

10

precedent.

11

MR. BUSBY:

Well, Your Honor, most of those

12

cases involved other issues, like exhaustion and

13

procedural default, where the State later came back

14

and said, "We were mistaken that they exhausted," or,

15

"We were mistaken that they didn't procedurally

16

default this claim."

18

pleaded the opposite of either exhaustion, procedural

default, or limitations.

20

that.

That's correct.

And then

15

our second fallback position is that even if Your --

16

even if Your Honors agree that the court could -- has

17

discretion to override the express waiver, that

18

there's at least a discretionary analysis that has to

19

apply under Civil Rule 15 that's coupled with a

20

presumption in -- against sua sponte dismissal that

21

the Eleventh Circuit didn't apply here.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why, just out of curiosity

23

-- I'm not familiar with the actual practice of a lot

24

of civil cases, but when somebody -- let's say the

And, also, speaking of run-of-the-mine

11

habeas corpus cases, this is a very rare instance.

12

There are -- there are lots of procedures for courts

13

to vindicate the interest that the State describes in

14

comity, finality, and federalism, whether inviting a

15

motion to -- whether ordering the State to file a

16

motion to dismiss under Rule 4, which we submit would

17

be the proper procedure, or, if the State fails to

18

raise it in its answer in certain circumstances,

19

inviting them to file a motion to amend under Rule 15.

20

That takes care of these interests in the run-of-the-

There's no need to vindicate those interests

23

in this case by creating an exception to the rules.

10

has not adopted the "beyond the concerns of the

entrusts even important public policies, like comity,

the waiver is not the beginning and end of it.

Your Honor, respectfully, I don't

9

I think that that is an interpretation of the Eleventh

10

Circuit's language.

11

phrase that Counsel pointed to in the opinion -- on

12

page 5(a), referencing "obligation" -- I believe that

13

the Court there was referring to, specifically under

14

Rule 4, that the court has this obligation.

it -- because it's in that discussion that the Court

16

is talking about the obligation.

17

that, indeed, under Rule 4, in response, I believe, to

18

Justice -- a point Justice Kennedy raised, I would say

19

that, under Rule 4, I think it is obligation.

20

what Rule 4 is, is a reflection of Congress -- excuse

- Mr. Busby told us that the reference was in the

2

following paragraph, and it is the sentence, "A

3

Federal Court that sits in collateral review of a

4

criminal judgment of a State Court has an obligation

5

to enforce the Federal statute of limitations."

6

That's the sentence that suggests that the Court of

7

Appeals thought that there was an obligation, the

8

District Court, to raise the statute of limitations on

9

its own motion.

10

MR. KISE:

Your Honor -- and I was referring

11

to that sentence, and perhaps I wasn't clear, but I

12

would -- I would say that they are still talking about

13

Rule 4.

14

even if, in fact, this Court believes that the

15

District -- that the Circuit Court's analysis is

16

flawed, then we must keep in mind that this Court is

17

reviewing judgments, not opinions.

18

could easily do what it did in Gonzalez, which is,

19

even though the analysis is not consistent with what

20

this Court -- I mean, frankly, if the Court takes that

21

view with what we're asking the Court to do here --

22

the District Court did, in fact, get it right.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

What would you say --

2

assuming that we're beyond Rule 4, what would you say

3

simply to a rule that said, "Yes, we recognize that

4

there remains a discretion -- not an obligation, but a

5

discretion -- on the part of the court to raise this."

6

But, just as a -- as a general rule, judicial

7

efficiency is better served by avoiding the use of

8

discretion unless the State, in fact, raises the

9

limitations issue, itself.

The courts have a lot of

10

things to do, and they shouldn't be spending their

11

time canvassing pleadings to see whether there might

12

be an issue that the State missed; so that in the

13

absence of some extraordinary circumstance, it would

14

be an abuse of discretion to exercise it as the -- as

15

the Circuit suggests it should have been exercised

16

here.

17

What would you say to that position?
MR. KISE:

I would say, respectfully, Your

18

Honor, that that is somewhat inconsistent, if not

that the State can do that is when the answer to the

suggested in the question earlier, that might well be

20

an abuse of discretion, but it would not -- for

21

example, take the case where the District Court had

22

dismissed, at the outset, on the merits, and it went

23

up to the Court of Appeals, and the Court of Appeals

24

said, "You know, that merits issue is a very difficult

25

one.

And

For example, if the case had gone on for

of the court's discretion.

But, you

We can dispose of

And we can save all of those

We think that would be an appropriate exercise

7

Here, as Your Honor noted earlier, this was

8

the first thing that happened in the District Court

9

after the filing of the petition, the answer, and the

10

reply.

11

the fact that it was raised sua sponte by the court in

12

the first thing that the court did after that

13

briefing.

14

because it was omitted from the State's responsive

15

pleading.

16

the failure to plead it perhaps waives the District --

17

the State's opportunity to insist on the defense.

18

State, because it said, in its answer here,

19

erroneously, that the petition was timely filed, or if

20

it had said nothing, would have waived its opportunity

21

to stand on, and insist on, that defense.

22

not an absolute forfeiture.

23

from suggesting at a later time, "We would like to

24

amend," or, in this case, the court to note it sua

25

sponte.

There was no waste of judicial resources by

The court did, here, of course, give the

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Excuse me.

From what you

4

just said, I take it that means that even when the

5

State is unwilling to change its mind and says, "No,

6

we would still prefer not to assert the defense," you

7

would allow the court to impose it.

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

The answer --- asserted by --

Yes.

Yes.

The

14

court is not absolutely limited by the affirmative

15

defenses asserted by the State.

16

perhaps most easily seen with respect to affirmative

17

defenses such as failure to exhaust, nonretroactivity.

18

If the court was going to have to assess a brand-new

19

constitutional claim that the habeas petitioner --

20
21

For -- and that is

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But with respect to

some --

22

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

-- was asserting --- of those, of

24

course, AEDPA specifically promulgates new rules about

25

when they're waived, and not.

And they -- Congress

52
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

hasn't done that with respect to the statute of

2

limitations.

3

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

That's right.

And

4

obviously, as the State suggested, if the State didn't

5

want to stand on the statute of limitations defense

6

because, for example, it was particularly messy, there

7

was going to be a lot of litigation about equitable

8

tolling, it would in inappropriate for the court to

9

insist on litigating that issue.

But if, for example,

10

the State said, "Well, you know, if we didn't stand on

11

this defense, instead this Petitioner would go back to

12

the State Court, and the State's Courts are going to

13

be very hospitable to this claim.

14

more likely to deny relief, so we'd rather have it

15

litigated here," it would inappropriate for the State

16

to try to force the Federal Court to litigate that

17

issue instead of the State Court.

18

specific, case-specific considerations.

19

what the Court did in Granberry.

20

after setting aside both extreme positions, it

21

remanded to the Court of Appeals for a case-specific

22

application of discretion.

23

We think you're

These are all factAnd that's

It remanded

--

As to the question of whether the Eleventh

24

Circuit here believed that there was an absolute

25

obligation, I think that it's relevant to note that,

53
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

although there was one point at which it said, "The

2

court was obligated to enforce the statute of

3

limitations" -- and, of course, that's true if the

4

State has preserved the defense -- there were three

5

other points in the Court of Appeals opinion where it

6

used discretionary or nonmandatory language.

7

example, at petition appendix 4(a), the court said

8

that the District Court "may dismiss."

9

petition appendix 5(a), it said that the State's

For

At the

10

failure to raise "does not bar" the court from acting

11

sua sponte.

12

State's concession, quote, "does not compromise the

13

authority of the District Court."

14

phrased in more permissive language --

15

Again, at petition appendix 6(a), the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

All of those are

But, of course,

16

"may" is -- "may" is embraced within "must."

17

"must," you "may."

18

[Laughter.]

19

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

If you

Well, perhaps the -

20

- perhaps the even most clear indication of what the

21

Court of Appeals viewed this is its citation to

22

Jackson as an application of Jackson.

23

there is no question, because Jackson said, quote,

24

"The District Court possessed the discretion to raise

25

sua sponte."

And in Jackson

And the -- and the magistrate judge, as

Washington, DC 20005

1

the State's counsel, mentioned -- in footnote 1 of its

2

opinion, cites that same standard and makes clear that

3

it's raising this at a -- as a matter of its

4

discretion.

5

would be -- serve no purpose in this case.

So, remand for the exercise of discretion

If there are no further questions --

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF J. BRETT BUSBY

10

Thank you, Counsel.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

11

MR. BUSBY:

12

I'd like to begin by addressing the "must"

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

13

versus "may" issue that Counsel discussed.

14

reasons I mentioned, I think the better reading of the

15

Eleventh Circuit's opinion is that there was an

16

obligation, and that the most clear indication of that

17

is its distinction of Esslinger, which expressly

18

applied a Granberry-type analysis.

19

Court believes that the Eleventh Circuit was only

20

saying "may," and that the District Court was only

21

saying "may," and recognized the that it had

22

discretion -- and there is a footnote in the

23

magistrate's opinion that cites to Jackson that says,

24

"We have discretion" -- I would submit that if you

25

read Jackson, it's a standardless discretion.

For the

But, even if the

There

are no factors anywhere in Jackson of the type that

2

this Court discussed in Granberry.

3

no indication that the -- that the magistrate judge

4

considered any of those factors.

5

indication that the Eleventh Circuit considered any of

6

those factors.

7

discretion for a court to apply the wrong legal

8

standard or fail to consider the relevant factors that

9

channel that discretion.

10

It -- and there's

There's no

And it's certainly an abuse of

And so, we -- our position is that, because

11

the factors under Rule 15 and the other factors in our

12

brief were not applied, that a remand, at a minimum,

13

is appropriate in this case.

14

Also, I'd like to speak to Granberry and

15

Caspari.

16

nonretroactivity.

17

to characterize those two doctrines as affirmative

18

defenses; rather, the way that Congress codified them

19

is on -- as substantive limits on relief, unlike

20

"limitations," which it just said "period of

21

limitations," which the commonly accepted meaning is

22

an "affirmative defense."

23

very different from an affirmative defense, in terms

24

of sua sponte consideration.

25

Again, those involve exhaustion and
And I submit that it's not correct

And so, that makes those

Also, both "exhaustion" and

"nonretroactivity" are unique to habeas.

2

mentioned anywhere in Rules 8 and 12.

3

"limitations," of course, is mentioned explicitly.

4

And so, our position is that Rule 8 and 12, not

5

necessarily always, but at least in all but

6

extraordinary cases, would prevent the judge from

7

raising this sua sponte.

9

They're not

Whereas,

Also, I would say that the rules that we
rely on don't deprive the court of sua sponte

10

authority, they channel that authority.

11

they can plead it, or the court can make a motion to

12

dismiss -- ask the -- order the State to make a motion

13

to dismiss based on limitations under Habeas Rule 4.

14

They can plead it in their answer, under Habeas Rule 5

15

and Civil Rules 8 and 12, or they can amend their

16

answer, under Civil Rule 15.

17

drafters of the rules wanted them to do this.

18

Lonchar and Carlisle say they cannot -- that a judge

19

cannot use his sua sponte power to circumvent the

20

requirements of those rules.

21

Under Rule 4,

That's the way the
And

Finally, I'd like to mention that civil --

22

the statutes of limitations in civil cases also

23

implicate broader social interests.

24

we've discussed in our brief.

because there are lots of protections in AEDPA cases

presumptions of correctness and those sorts of things.

There are
