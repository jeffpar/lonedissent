ORAL ARGUMENT OF BURCK BAILEY

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

10

MR. BAILEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In 1947, this Court stated, in Cone versus West

11

Virginia Pulp & Paper Company, 330 U.S. at 216, quote,

12

"Determination of whether a new trial should be granted,

13

or a judgment entered under Rule 50(b), calls for the

14

judgment in the first instance of the judge who saw and

15

heard the witnesses and has the feel of the case, which no

16

appellate printed transcript can impart."

17

was repeated verbatim the following year in Globe Liquor

18

versus San Roman.

19

and Globe Liquor were cited for the same proposition in

20

Fountain versus Filson.

21

New York Railway, this Court again reiterated the

22

requirement -- is the word the Court used -- of submitting

23

a post-verdict motion, or JNOV, to preserve sufficiency of

24

the evidence for appellate review.

25

That language

And, in the year after that, both Cone

And, in 1952, in Johnson versus

MR. BAILEY:

No, Your Honor.

There was a motion

for a remittitur --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

MR. WOLFMAN:

Had a Rule 59 motion been

made, would it preserve a sufficiency-of-the-evidence

8

argument in connection with the motion for new trial?

MR. BAILEY:

Not a sufficiency-of-the-evidence

10

argument, Your Honor.

11

that in footnote 9 of the Weisgram opinion.

12

motion contesting the weight of the evidence would have

13

been appropriate.

14

And that -- this Court spoke to
But a Rule 59

No such motion was filed.

Eight of the Circuit Courts of Appeals have held

15

that in the absence of a post-verdict Rule 50(b) motion,

16

the appellate court cannot review for sufficiency of the

17

evidence.

Several of them do -Yes.

Some do not, but

And, Your

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Honor, we feel that those cases are mistakenly decided,

2

because the court's ruling on a 50(a) motion -- that is, a

3

pre-verdict motion -- is always interlocutory.

4

indeed, the trial court is encouraged to deny that motion,

5

pending the jury verdict, because if the jury comes back,

6

obviously, with a defendant's verdict, that's the end of

7

the case.

8

it, and the appellate court concludes that there was a

9

jury question, then it has to go back for a whole new

10

trial.

I mean,

And if the Court, on the other hand, grants

So --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

just while I have you here -- it's not --

13

MR. BAILEY:

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Just while I have you, I'm --

Yes.
-- probably, directly relevant

15

to this case.

16

it used to irritate me sometimes that the judge should

17

grant the motion and then he'd just sit on it.

18

the wisdom for the rule now, and the judge reserving it,

19

in the event the jury comes out the right -- the, quote,

20

"right way," anyway.

21

What if, after the plaintiff rests, there's a good grounds

22

for granting the motion for judgment as a matter of law,

23

the judge doesn't do it, and then there's a 3-month trial?

24
25

On that one point, when I was in practice,

But I see

What if there's a very long trial?

Do the judges ever take that into account?

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Three more months for the

defense to --

3

MR. BAILEY:

Yes.

Your Honor, I think my answer

4

to that is, not infrequently holes in the plaintiff's case

5

are filled when the defendant's case is put on.

6

happens, as I say, rather frequently, through cross-

7

examination and -- and it's just extremely iffy to say

8

that won't occur.

9

raises the specter of this problem that we've just talked

That

And, in any event, Your Honor, it

10

about, that that long trial that you -- that you

11

envisioned in your hypothetical would have to -- if the

12

appellate court finds that there is a jury question there

13

--

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

15

MR. BAILEY:

16

Yes.

-- has to try it all over again.

Not a -- not a very good consequence.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

On the issue that's before us

18

now, I can understand why, if the, what we used to call,

19

JNOV is not requested after the jury verdict, the

20

appellate court could not then enter judgment -- direct

21

the entry of judgment as a matter of law.

22

why it couldn't say, just as we would be reluctant to

23

affirm a decision when there was no claim for relief, so,

24

if there's insufficient evidence, we can remand for a new

25

trial.

But I don't see

But you would say that that is not possible

-- you haven't asked for it,

10

but the appellate court said, "We don't want to affirm a

11

judgment when there was insufficient evidence, so we are

12

going to" -- there was -- the judge was tipped off by the

13

-- by the directed-verdict motion, that the -- who turned

14

out to be -- the one who turned out to be the verdict

15

loser thinks the evidence is insufficient.

16

at least to say that the Court of Appeals could grant a

17

new trial.

18

MR. BAILEY:

That's enough

Your Honor, it's our position that

19

you can never ask for -- move for a new trial for -- on

20

the ground that the evidence is against -- the weight --

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

22

MR. BAILEY:

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

No, I'm not --

-- of the evidence --- talking about "against the

24

weight," because a trial judge would rarely be -- if it --

25

if a trial judge said, "It's against the weight of the

7
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

evidence," it would go back for a new trial, and you

2

couldn't raise that issue, at least not til you go through

3

the whole second trial.

4

there are decisions that say there was a judgment, but

5

the Court of Appeals determines there was never a claim

6

for relief to begin with, even though a motion wasn't made

7

to that effect.

8

that is without sufficient legal basis is troubling.

9

But why isn't it like -- I think

The idea of a court affirming a judgment

MR. BAILEY:

Well, Your Honor, I -- my response

10

to that is that these matters, pursuant to this Court's

11

jurisprudence in Cone and Johnson and other cases, simply

12

mandates that the trial court be asked to pass in the

13

first instance on this issue of sufficiency of the

14

evidence.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But, it -- but it was asked

16

by the -- by the pre-verdict motion.

17

thing that wasn't done is, it -- the request wasn't

18

repeated after the verdict.

19

had never been a motion for directed verdict at the close

20

of all of the evidence.

21

that we're missing is a repetition of the same words after

22

the jury comes in.

23

MR. BAILEY:

What -- the only

I can see your point if there

But there was that.

And so, all

Well, Your Honor, the -- if I may,

24

the standard of review is radically different.

25

motion for a JNOV is asked for and granted/denied, the

I mean, if

8
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

review is de novo.

2

is an abuse of discretion.

3

The issue about a new trial, under 59,

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, that's -- the new trial

4

comes in, by the courts that have said this, only --

5

they'd say, "We would direct the entry of judgment for the

6

verdict loser, but we're powerless to do that."

7

is all wrapped up in the Seventh Amendment.

8

best thing is, we grant a new trial.

9

MR. BAILEY:

And that

So, the next

Well, that's certainly what the

10

Tenth Circuit jurisprudence provides, Your Honor.

11

Federal Circuit adopted that.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

13

MR. BAILEY:

And the

Yes.

And we think that that's totally at

14

odds with this Court's rule in Cone and Johnson, that it

15

is out of step with the law in eight Federal Circuits,

16

that it simply is illogical to say, someone who never

17

asked for a new trial -- Your Honor, if they had -- if

18

ConAgra had sought a new trial on sufficiency of the

19

evidence in Federal Circuit, presumably, the Federal

20

Circuit said, "You didn't ask for that below.

21

It's waived.

What's your next argument?"

It's gone.

By not asking,

22

they say, in effect, "Since you didn't ask for it, that's

23

what we're going to give you."

So, one could say, "We won't give you a judgment,

MR. BAILEY:

And, Your Honor, I -- my response

8

is simply that those are two very different motions and

I have to make is that the reviewing court would determine

the issue of new trial on an abuse-of-discretion standard,

25

not on a de novo review of sufficiency of the evidence.

2

under Rule 59.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And that determination of what

was the weight of the evidence is typically left to the

trial judge, rather than to the Court of Appeals.

6

would be --

7

MR. BAILEY:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It

Well, you can --- somewhat novel for the Court

of Appeals to be reviewing a trial judge on the basis of

10

what it thought the weight of the evidence was.

11

thing to say, "If he's denied or granted a motion for a

12

new trial on that basis, we'll look for abuse of

13

discretion," but for the appellate court to do that de

14

15

me, quite unusual.

4

-- just automatically ask for JNOV or, in the alternative,

5

a new trial.

6

Those two are closely

I mean, lawyers usually, as a -- just a matter of

MR. BAILEY:

Your Honor, I think it shows

7

respect to the trial judge to require that the trial judge

8

be required, in the first instance, to review this

9

evidence that the trial judge saw, heard, and has the same

10

opportunity, as this Court has observed in cases going

11

back over a century, to see, just like the jurors saw, and

12

provides a perspective on it that is available to the

13

trial judge, alone.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

17

MR. BAILEY:

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well --

Your Honors, if --- it seems --

-- I may, I'd --- it seems to me that if the

19

Court of Appeals is going to grant a new trial, it must

20

say one of two things.

21

"There was not sufficient evidence to go to the jury, but

22

the conclusion of that determination ought to be -- and,

23

therefore, you know, the case is over"; but to say that

24

and then say, "And, therefore, we give a new trial," it

25

seems very strange.

It must say either, number one,

Or else, the Court of Appeals has to

14
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

say, you know, "The weight of the evidence was not in the

2

plaintiff's favor."

3

kind of a determination that I find unusual for a Court of

4

Appeals.

And if it says that, it's making the

MR. STEWART:

20

may it please the Court:

21

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

It's a well established principle of Federal

22

appellate practice that the litigant must adequately

23

preserve a claim in the trial court in order to raise it

24

on appeal.

25

claim of insufficient evidence is adequately preserved for

The disputed issue in this case is whether a

3

50(b) must be filed, as well.

4

practical considerations that underlie contemporaneous

5

objection rules, and this Court's decisions construing

Rule 50 all indicate that a post-verdict motion is

7

necessary for adequate preservation of the claim.

The text of Rule 50, the

It often is.

It can be made --

practice.

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. STEWART:

Yes.

It doesn't -- it doesn't have to

be made at the close of the plaintiff case, but it can be

20

made at any time after the opposing party has had an

21

adequate opportunity to be heard.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And so --

But they're really different

-- relief, but it -- different

7

considerations would affect the trial judge's decision

8

whether to grant the motion.

9

this goes to Justice Kennedy's question -- that is, one of

And I think -- in a sense,

10

the reasons that, at least with respect to the motion

11

that's filed at the conclusion of all the evidence, that

12

these motions are almost uniformly not granted, the case

13

is almost always submitted to the jury, because the

14

thought is, very little is lost by submitting the case to

15

the jury, because the suit has been tried already, and

16

there may be substantial gains in efficiency from pursuing

17

that course.

18

conclusion of the plaintiff's case, and the judge thought

19

it clearly had merit and thought that a substantial

20

savings in cost and time would ensue from granting the

21

motion, the trial judge could take that into account in

22

deciding whether the motion should be granted or not.

23

I think -- I think it's important to look at the text of

24

Rule 50.

25

57(a) of the appendix to the certiorari petition.

I think if a motion was made at the

But

And it's reprinted, among other places, at page

19
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

1

-- at the beginning of Rule 50(a)(1), it says, "If, during

2

a trial by jury, a party has been fully heard on an issue

3

and there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a

4

reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue, the

5

Court may determine the issue against that party."

6

the word "may" is permissive.

7

Again,

So, while the judge may take into account

8

potential savings in time and expense, the judge is never

9

required to grant a Rule 50(a) motion, even if the judge

10

is firmly persuaded that the evidence on the other side is

11

insufficient.

12

And then, at the very bottom of the page, the

13

first sentence of Rule 50(b) says, "If, for any reason,

14

the Court does not grant a motion for judgment as a matter

15

of law made at the close of all the evidence, the Court is

16

considered to have submitted the action to the jury,

17

subject to the Court's later deciding the legal questions

18

raised by the motion."

19

And the significance of that sentence is that it

20

says, "No matter what stated rationale the District Court

21

gives" -- whether the District Court simply says, "I'm

22

reserving the motion," or says, "I'm denying it, because

23

the evidence is, in my view, clearly sufficient" --

24

"whatever stated rationale the Court gives, the action

25

will be treated as a reservation of the legal questions."

20

1

And I think one of the reasons that it would be

2

inappropriate to allow appeal of a sufficiency claim

3

without a renewed post-verdict motion is that in order to

4

attain reversal on appeal, regardless of whether the

5

remedy is entry of judgment or a new trial, the Court of

6

Appeals has to be able to point to an erroneous ruling by

7

the District Court.

8

the 50(a) motion, by its nature, can't be erroneous.

9

is, the judge is specifically authorized to submit the

10

And the reservation of a ruling on
That

case to the jury --

11

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But, Mr. Stewart, just let me

12

clear up one thing of confusion.

13

the District judge denies the motion before submitting the

14

case to the jury, within 10 days after the jury verdict,

15

if no further motion is made, he would still -- the judge

16

would still have authority to change his mind and grant

17

the motion?

18

MR. STEWART:

Is it not true that if

We don't believe that that's the

19

case.

20

so that the time for filing a post-verdict motion is 10

21

days after entry of judgment, rather than 10 days after

22

verdict, as it used to be.

23

Johnson, that, in the absence of a renewed verdict post-

24

-- a renewed motion post-verdict, neither the District

25

Court nor the Court of Appeals may order entry of judgment

That is, at this point, the rule has been amended

But this Court said, in

in the favor of the verdict loser.

And I think that the

2

text of Rule 50(b) bears that out.

If you look farther

3

down that paragraph, on page 58(a), the rule says,

4

"Submission of the case to the jury is to be treated -- or

5

considered to be a reservation of the legal question."

6

And then it said, "The movant may renew the request."

7

then that sentence says, "In ruling on a renewed motion,

8

the Court may, if a verdict was returned, allow the

9

judgment to stand or grant a new trial or order entry of

11

-- renewed motion," is significant, because the only

12

express authority that the District Court has, post-

13

14

court may do so in ruling on a renewed motion.

16

And I think that phrase, "in ruling on a new

So, you're saying that if the

should say to the losing party, "Renew your motion, and

MR. STEWART:

That's correct.

And the judge

could do that, either pre- or post-verdict.

nothing wrong with the judge encouraging the litigant to

He should.

And, indeed, this

17

Court, in -- as early as Montgomery Ward, have said that

18

was the better practice, and that requirement has since

19

been codified in what is now Rule 50(c), which says that

20

if the Court grants the motion for judgment as -- the

21

renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law, and there

22

is also an alternative motion for a new trial, the judge

23

should rule on that, as well, and should basically say,

24

"In the event that my ruling on the JNOV -- or the JMOL"

MR. STEWART:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MR. STEWART:

"Shall."

It does say "shall.

Yes, "shall."
It says "shall."

Thank you.

So, "In the event that my ruling

5

on the sufficiency question is reversed on appeal, the

6

Court of Appeals will know how I would have ruled on the

7

new-trial motion, and the processing of the case can be

8

expedited."

9
10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It's a -- it's a conditional

ruling on the new-trial motion.

11

MR. STEWART:

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's correct.
Because if it were a ruling

13

on the new-trial motion, you would never get up to the

14

Court of Appeals.

15

MR. STEWART:

That's correct.

But the Court --

16

this Court, in Montgomery Ward, noted that there may be

17

inefficiencies if the District Court rules on the JNOV

18

motion, but doesn't rule on the conditional motion for new

19

trial, because if the JNOV -- if the ruling on the JNOV

20

motion is reversed on appeal, then there's a need for

21

remand for further proceedings, and it's inefficient.

22

But to return to the point about taking an

23

appeal from a Rule 50(a) motion, I think it would put a

24

District Court in an untenable position to say, "You can

25

reserve ruling on the 50(a) motion, even if you think the

24
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

evidence is insufficient," and, indeed, it's usually the

2

better practice to do so, but, if you do that, and the

3

jury comes back against the movant, the movant can take an

4

immediate appeal, and you can be reversed on the ground

5

that your ruling on the Rule 50(a) motion was erroneous.

6

There's simply no -- by its -- by the terms of the rule

7

itself, the submission of the case to the jury, in the

8

face of a Rule 50(a) motion, is considered to be a

9

reservation of the sufficiency question.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, well, I don't know that

11

you have to read it that way.

12

the -- when the -- when the rule says that it -- that it

13

is deemed to have been reserved, it also implies that the

14

question that was reserved is implicitly resolved when the

15

court does not -- does, later, not act.

16

I mean, you can say that

It's an implicit

Why can't you read the rule that way?

17

MR. STEWART:

I mean, conceivably you could have

18

read the rule that way at the time of Johnson, but first

19

we have this Court's decision in Johnson, which says the

20

submission of a post-verdict Rule 50(b) motion is an

21

essential prerequisite even for the District Court to act

where the court is ruling on a renewed motion.

doesn't contemplate a situation in which the motion is not

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The rule

What about the plain-

error question?
MR. STEWART:

I think we would say, for some of

10

the same reasons that Mr. Bailey has identified, that

11

plain-error review would be inappropriate, because in

12

order to have plain error, there has to be error.

13

the gravamen of the appeal is that denial of the pre-

14

verdict Rule 50(a) motion was plain error, it can't be

15

right, because the pre-verdict -- the submission of the

16

case to the jury is treated, as a matter of law, as a

17

reservation of the legal questions, and it can't be plain

18

error to reserve those questions for later decisions.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A. SCHROEDER

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

10

MR. SCHROEDER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Before getting to some of these questions that

11

have been discussed this morning, I think it's helpful to

12

ground ourselves a little bit in the fundamental decision

13

made by the Federal Circuit that is not within this

14

Court's grant of certiorari, and, therefore, is the

15

foundation from which we proceed.

16

the Federal Circuit said, "Unitherm never presented any

17

evidence that could possibly support critical factual

18

elements of its claim.

19

present any facts that could allow a reasonable jury to

20

accept either its proposed market definition or its

21

demonstration of antitrust injury."

22

And, rather succinctly,

In particular, Unitherm failed to

Building on that foundation, Unitherm wants a

23

judgment entered in its favor for $19 million for the

24

injury that they have never proven.

25

they have to accomplish each of three things.

And, to get there,

1

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

May I just stop you with that

2

point?

3

that argument -- which, as you prefaced, is not before us

4

-- is, the Court of Appeals was looking to a truncated

5

record to see whether there was sufficient evidence that,

6

in fact, the record was much larger than the piece of it

7

that the Federal Circuit examined, so that the Federal

8

Circuit, when it says there was no evidence, was looking

9

to the appendix that was before us, but that was not the

10

Because one of the things that Unitherm said about

whole picture.

11

MR. SCHROEDER:

Your Honor, in the Federal

12

Circuit, each party had the -- had the ability to put any

13

part of the record, or the entire record, before the

14

court, and, under the Federal Circuit's own rule, they

15

were also entitled to go back to the District Court

16

record, whether it was in the appendix or not.

17

entire record --

18
19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So, the

Well, but if they had

been on --

20

MR. SCHROEDER:

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

-- was --- if they had been on

22

notice that insufficiency of the evidence was going to be

23

an issue, they might have put more in the record about the

24

sufficiency of the evidence.

25

MR. SCHROEDER:

When the case was appealed to

28
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

1

the Federal Circuit, Your Honor, insufficiency of the

2

evidence was presented as an issue at that time.

3

that was --

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And so,

But under this Federal

5

Circuit's own law, it could not be, because there had not

been the post-verdict motion.

7

MR. SCHROEDER:

8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

9

Well, that -The Federal Circuit is

borrowing Tenth Circuit's law for this purpose, but the

10

Tenth Circuit's law, as I understand it, has -- is the

11

position that was just presented to us by Mr. Stewart.

12

That is, if you don't make what used to be called the

13

JNOV, even if you made the directed verdict, you can't

14

raise the sufficiency on appeal.

15

MR. SCHROEDER:

Well, Your Honor, going to the

16

Federal Circuit, of course, the meaning of Rule 50 was in

dispute.

position that the evidence was sufficient -- was

19

insufficient, and that was the issue before --

2

for insufficient evidence.

3

MR. SCHROEDER:

That is the Federal Circuit rule

4

in patent infringement cases.

5

the Federal Circuit would apply in this case, because the

Federal Circuit would apply --

It was not the rule that

MR. SCHROEDER:

Yes.

But that's -- in

12

respect to the Chief Justice's question, the -- Unitherm

13

could have thought, "Well, the Federal Circuit is not

going to deal with sufficiency; therefore, I don't have to

MR. SCHROEDER:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

19

MR. SCHROEDER:

-- certainly, they did have to

20

deal with that, Your Honor, because one of the grounds for

appeal was that there as no antitrust standing.

23

view the question.

24

certainly everyone knew, when this case went to the

Circuit law applied, and that the evidence should be

reviewed for its sufficiency --

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Yes, but the -- the antitrust

4

standing issue is not the same as the relevant market

5

issue that was decided, is it?

6

MR. SCHROEDER:

No, it's not, but it certainly

7

is the same with respect to antitrust injury, and the

8

Federal Circuit found there was no evidence of antitrust

9

injury.

So, there, the entire record should have been

10

before the Federal Circuit.

11

so, when they made the determination that there was no

12

evidence of antitrust injury, they did that in the

13

presence of a full record on that issue.

that anyone could have thought that that issue was not

are before the court.

I certainly would refer the Court to the Cone case, which

21

I think is very similar to this case, procedurally.

22

Cone, there was a Rule 59 motion.

23

-- excuse me, a Rule 50(a) motion, no Rule 50(b) motion.

24

There was a motion for a new trial on the grounds of newly

25

discovered evidence.

There was no Rule 50(b)

Well, of course, Your Honor, if

there were no proof of damages, the whole antitrust claim

18

would fail.

19

when a motion is made under Rule 50(a) for judgment as a

20

matter of law, that certainly permits the District Court

21

to grant a new trial, because it's a lesser remedy.

22

we see situations all the time --

23

But I would also say that it seems to me that

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And

Well, why -- it's -- why

24

is that a lesser remedy?

remittitur is a lesser remedy, too, but you don't say,

there are different motions for all these different

9

off the board.

The approach seems to be, "Something's wrong

13

16

many situations like that, where a particular remedy --

21

a new trial addresses different issues than a judgment as

22

a matter of law, and remittitur addresses different issues

23

than a new trial.

24
25

Whatever it is that gave rise to the

MR. SCHROEDER:

But

Well, it seems to me that it is

the principal point of the trilogy that when a motion is

34
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

made for entry of judgment based on insufficiency of the

2

evidence, that raises the question of whether there ought

3

to be a new trial.

4

in the trilogy, that you really can't have one without the

5

other.

6

That was the principal point discussed

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The principal point was that

7

the Court of Appeals could not enter -- direct the entry

8

of judgment as a matter of law if a 50(b) motion had not

9

been made.

That's what those three cases --

10

MR. SCHROEDER:

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

12

MR. SCHROEDER:

That's --- invoke.

-- absolutely correct, Your

13

Honor, the trilogy stands for that proposition.

14

all three cases of the trilogy, even though there was no

15

Rule 50(b) motion, those cases were all remanded.

16

case was the verdict winner who had insufficient evidence

17

allowed to prevail.

18

the Solicitor General relies on stare decisis, but he's

19

asking the Court to do something radically different from

20

what happened in any of those cases of the trilogy.

21

They're asking that judgment be entered for the party that

22

failed to --

23
24
25

But in

They just remanded the cases.

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

I don't believe, as to all of the cases, Your Honor, but

2

certainly it is clear in the first case, the Cone case,

3

that there was a motion for a new trial, but it was

4

based on different grounds.

It was based on newly

10

the case.

11

as a matter of law can be made, and specifically says that

12

the judge can grant that motion.

13

on to say that that motion is deemed to continue to be

Rule 50(a) provides that a motion for judgment

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

That's the way this Court has

11

read it.

12

That's the problem.
MR. SCHROEDER:

I don't believe so, Your Honor,

13

because if the Court -- if the rule says that the Rule

14

50(a) motion can be granted; conversely, it can be denied.

15

If it can be granted or denied, those decisions are

16

appealable under section 2106, which is the general

17

provision that orders of the court can be appealed.

18

not see anything in Rule 50 that says that denial of the

19

50(a) motion is not appealable.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What Rule 50(b) does is

Well, it can't -- it can't be

23

be raised until final judgment is entered.

24
25

MR. SCHROEDER:

I do

It couldn't

Well, Your Honor, I think that

would be a most peculiar rule.

Entering judgment in a

38
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

case is one of the most fundamental and important things

2

that a court does.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes, but you don't go up on

4

appeal with a final judgment rule, a firm final judgment

5

rule, as there is in the Federal system, from the denial

6

or refusal to act on a 50(a) motion.

7

MR. SCHROEDER:

8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

9
10

is no judgment.

Well -The trial isn't over.

There

You can't appeal til you have a final

judgment.

11

MR. SCHROEDER:

That's certainly correct, Your

12

Honor, there can be no appeal without a final judgment.

13

But what I'm saying is that an interpretation of Rule 50,

14

as a whole, which says to the trial court judge that a

15

judgment should be entered without resolving the question

16

of whether there is sufficient evidence, and then take

17

that up later, under Rule 50(b), isn't a very good way to

18

proceed.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, there is, you know -- I

20

mean, this truly is a case where a page of history is

21

worth much more than logic.

22

strange language is, at common law, it was thought, once

23

the jury came in with a verdict, that was it, the judge

24

had no power to overturn it, because of the Seventh

25

Amendment's Reexamination Clause, "no fact tried by a

The reason for that somewhat

39

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

jury, shall be otherwise re-examined in any court of the

2

United States, than according to the rules of common law."

3

And the rule of common law that is embodied in this

4

somewhat strange language in Rule 50 is that there could

5

be a reserved question so that after the jury comes in

6

with the verdict, the judge would be deciding the pre-

7

verdict question by this post-verdict motion.

8

there's -- none of this is in doubt, where this language

9

in 50 comes from.

It comes from a need to adjust to the

10

Reexamination Clause of the Seventh Amendment.

11

so?

12

I mean,

MR. SCHROEDER:

Isn't that

Yes, that's all correct, Your

13

Honor.

14

reserved decision under 50(a), I would still say that the

15

denial of the 50(a) motion should be appealable when the

16

judgment is entered, because the -- all of the prior

17

orders of the court merge into that judgment when it's

18

entered.

19

But if there were no provision of the rule that

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you don't get it out of

20

that language, because that language is there for the

21

specific purposes of allowing a judge, after their

22

verdict, to enter judgment NOV.

23

MR. SCHROEDER:

24

is there for that purpose.

25

that the court -- that the case proceed by that route.

Yes, Your Honor.

What I'm saying is that once the 50(a) motion is made and

2106.

4

litigant, who does not believe that the issue has been

5

fully heard, briefed, considered by the court, to raise

6

the issue again, but not to put us in the position where,

7

in the normal course, the judge follows the usual

8

procedure of submitting the case to the jury, because the

9

jury may resolve the problem by deciding the case in favor

10

of the party that should win on the evidence, but then, at

11

that point, the judge merely has to enter -- has to enter

12

judgment in order to trigger the 50(b) motion.

13

doesn't seem to be a good way to proceed, and I don't

14

believe that's what's contemplated by the rule.

15

fact, it is a common practice among --

16

The Rule 50(b) route is merely there to allow a

18

between the verdict and the entry of judgment.

MR. SCHROEDER:

that it can be made up to 10 days --

-- after the entry of judgment.

So, from the point of view of the District Court, if the

24

court ever wants to get to the end, wants to put a time

25

limit on this, the only way to do it is to enter judgment.

41
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

That forces the moving party to get a 50(b) motion --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

3

MR. SCHROEDER:

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But I don't --

-- on account of the defendant.
-- I don't follow that,

5

because you -- you know, I'm sure, that it's almost

6

routine that -- yes, you have the 10 days, the extra 10

7

days, under the rules -- but isn't it almost routine, at a

8

trial, that the verdict loser will say, "Judge, please

9

give me JNOV, or, if not, a new trial"?

They don't wait

10

til after the judgment is made -- entered.

11

But it's just -- well, in the trials I've seen, it's

12

almost by rote that lawyers who lose, where the jury comes

13

in for the other side, will renew the judgment-as-a-

14

matter-of-law motion and ask, in the alternative, for a

15

new trial.

16

They could.

Isn't that the common practice?
MR. SCHROEDER:

Well, I think it's a common

17

practice in those circuits which have indicated that a

18

50(b) motion is required to preserve all rights to

19

appellate review.

20

practice in other circuits where that is not required, I'm

21

not sure.

22

Whether or not it is the common

Certainly -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, it's not a question of

23

what is required or what is permissive, but isn't it to

24

the lawyer's advantage, to the client's advantage, to say

to the judge, sooner rather than later, "Look don't enter

MR. SCHROEDER:

Well, Your Honor, this case may

And the issue had not changed.

And, in

10

fact, when the 50(a) motion was made, at the end of the

11

trial, the Court may have noticed that it was made in a

12

rather peculiar way, an attorney attempting to persuade

13

the court that that motion should be granted wouldn't

begin the motion by saying, "For the record."

going to change it, and, in fact, declined, on several

We had a great

What I'm worried about, to put

16

all my cards on the table -- if we were to say there is

17

even a possibility of plain error in this case, the plain-

error exception in the rules would become a monster,

19

wherein complex cases, people who hadn't made the proper

had.

MR. SCHROEDER:

Well, certainly the plain-error

argument is always, in a sense, available, Your Honor.
