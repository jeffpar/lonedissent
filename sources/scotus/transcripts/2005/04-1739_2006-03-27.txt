ORAL ARGUMENT OF LOUIS J. ROVELLI

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. ROVELLI:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

The policy challenged in this case applies to

11

a small class of dangerous, disruptive inmates, all

12

confined at level 2 of the Long Term Segregation Unit,

13

which is the most restrictive custody in the

14

Pennsylvania prison system.

15

These central facts inform every aspect of

16

the Turner analysis which governs the outcome of this

17

case.

18

the opportunity to earn them back by improved behavior,

19

is logically connected both to rehabilitation and

20

security.

21

attempt at rehabilitation.

22

will be released from prison.

23

to turn these inmates around, to improve their behavior

24

enough that they can be advanced safely to programs

25

with more opportunities for self-improvement.

The denial of periodicals and photographs, with

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Mr. Rovelli, I -- I forget.

4

about?

MR. ROVELLI:

JUSTICE STEVENS:

10
11

Less than 40.
Less than 40?

And does the

record tell us how long they have been in level 2?
MR. ROVELLI:

Well, the duration of -- of

confinement at level 2 varies widely from one inmate to
another because it is affected by their improvement.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

But is there any average or

12

any -- is there -- does the record tell us how -- how

13

long most of them have been there?

14

MR. ROVELLI:

The record does not tell us how

15

long most of them have been there.

16

case in the trial court, which was 2002, 25 percent of

17

them had been promoted to level 1 or had been released

18

from the Long Term Segregation Unit altogether.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

At the time of the

Does that mean that 75

percent had not?

21

MR. ROVELLI:

22

JUSTICE STEVENS:

At that time, yes.
And how long -- do we know

23

what the average period of incarceration in level 2 is?

24

Is it a matter of weeks, or is it a matter of years?

25

MR. ROVELLI:

Well, realistically it's in

operation for 2 years at the time that the record was made.

3

So there's very little --

4

Again, the -- the unit had only been in

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I'm trying to understand

5

whether typically they're there for a long period of

6

time on the one hand, or are they there sort of on

7

probation and are periodically reviewed and moved into

8

another system?

9

MR. ROVELLI:

They're -- they're moved when

10

their behavior improves.

11

period of time has been in the range of a year or so.

The average over a long

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I see.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Were there any prisoners,

14

since the inception to your program, that have been in

16

MR. ROVELLI:

17

from the time of its inception?

Through today?

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

19

MR. ROVELLI:

I'm sorry.

Yes.

Until the 2-year point.

20

there were.

21

but there definitely were.

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Oh,

Yes,

I don't know exactly how many there were,

Are -- do -- is -- is

23

Pennsylvania alone or nearly alone in imposing this

24

rule, or is this typical of the restraints imposed in

25

-- in this maximum restrictive confinement?

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. ROVELLI:

There's a wide variation of

2

privilege grants and withdrawals even at the highest

3

levels of security.

4

three other States that -- that have the same program

5

as Pennsylvania, and frankly, I'm not even sure as to

6

those, that it's identical.

7

recognized that -- that these sorts of variations,

8

particularly when we're talking about high security

9

prisoners, are precisely what Turner contemplates.

10

The ACLU's amicus brief points to

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But the Court has

Is this one of the most

11

severe restrictions in the Nation with respect to

12

reading material and photographs?

13

MR. ROVELLI:

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I'm sure that it is.
What is the reason that --

15

that the State or the regulations allow paperbacks from

16

the library and not current events?

17

-- the rationality of -- of that line escapes me.

18

MR. ROVELLI:

I'm just -- that

Well, there's -- there is

19

certainly a security component to it.

20

small, compact, much more difficult to use as weapons,

21

and the experience of the prison staff that operate

22

this high security unit is that newspapers and

23

magazines are -- have been a -- a frequent source of

24

mischief.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Paperback books,

Can we explain that?

How

does one use a newspaper as a weapon?

know, maybe disciplining a dog or something.

(Laughter.)

4

MR. ROVELLI:

I mean, you

Actually inmates, particularly

5

the worst of the worst, are quite clever at using

6

newspapers.

7

used as an adhesive can be compacted into very nearly

8

the equivalent of a nightstick.

12

13

MR. ROVELLI:

But a paperback
It seems a

The experience of prison

14

officials is that, yes, it is, and -- and actually it's

15

very common in prison systems to distinguish, for

16

example, between hardback books and paperbacks.

17

it's -- these are difficult lines to draw, and that's

18

where the professional expertise of the people who deal

19

with the problems every day comes into play.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes,

But if the concern is the

21

safety concern, then you would have an equal concern

22

with the Jewish Daily Forward, which is a newspaper

23

format, or -- and I don't know what the Watchtower

24

comes out in these days.

25

MR. ROVELLI:

Yes.

Well, Justice Ginsburg,

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

the -- the experience of prison administrators is that

2

prisoners are less likely to use religious and legal

3

materials for mischief, and as to paperbacks as well,

4

they do supply an alternative means of receiving

5

information from outside the prison.

6

-- if I allude frequently to the experience of prison

7

administrators, it's -- it's because that's what these

-- this policy is guided by.

9

have a high value to inmates.

10

But again, if I

Newspapers and magazines

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, that's why I

11

thought your answer would have focused on that rather

12

than the security concerns, is that you take away what

13

it is they want the most because that's most likely to

14

result in them conforming their behavior so they can

15

get it back.

16
17
18

MR. ROVELLI:

Yes, and that is -- is the

primary purpose of the policy overall, and -JUSTICE BREYER:

JUSTICE BREYER:

time may be let out of his cell and is escorted to a

9

All right.

Why couldn't you have a -- if he wants to see

10

the newspaper in that mini law library, why couldn't

11

there be a copy there, only the parts that are

12

consistent with the censorship policy, just like a news

13

of the day.

MR. ROVELLI:

JUSTICE BREYER:

JUSTICE BREYER:

Is there a security reason

when he's there in leg irons looking at the books, the

21

law books, in the mini law library?

22

MR. ROVELLI:

Allowing the -- the inmate to

23

request to go to the mini law library for an additional

24

purpose or for a separate purpose to read periodicals

25

puts increased demand on going there, and moving these

MR. ROVELLI:

MR. ROVELLI:

theory, could the State do that?

MR. ROVELLI:

Because that's something you

Would that -- I'm not saying that

Yes.

Yes, Justice Souter, the

20

State could, as long as the overall Turner analysis is

21

observed.

22

implicate the availability -- the availability of

23

alternative means of exercising the asserted right to

24

receive information from outside the prison.

25

And, in particular, I think that would

Well, what would -- I mean,

11
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

you know, one of the arguments made on the other side

2

is that if you accept the behavior modification theory

3

as an adequate justification, the Turner categories

4

essentially become incoherent.

5

What, for example, would be the alternative

6

means in this case if the State said, we realize that

7

the people in -- in -- at level 2 want to see legal

8

materials very, very much because that is a source of

9

hope for them, and we want them to have that source of

10

hope only if they shape up and -- and get down to a

11

reduced level of security, so we're going to stop it,

12

period?

13

the Turner analysis?

14

What would be the alternatives within the --

MR. ROVELLI:

The inmate would still have

15

unlimited access to counsel visits and can still visit

16

the mini law library and do his own legal research,

17

even if he's not allowed to subscribe to or -- or keep

18

legal materials, legal periodicals in his own cell.

19

JUSTICE SOUTER:

What if the -- what if the

20

inmate said, look, the -- the lawyers who come to see

21

us are -- are great guys, but they're -- they're

22

overworked. They don't have time to be thinking about

23

novel legal theories, which we would dream up perhaps

24

if we could get to Legal Times and these periodicals?

25

So it's -- it's not an alternative.

MR. ROVELLI:

Ultimately any prisoner is --

2

is free to challenge the adequacy of his ability to

access the courts in a -- in an as-applied challenge to

4

his own conditions.

5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So you're -- you're saying

6

there -- there's a separate value here, and that is the

7

value of access to courts.

8

can be done for purposes of behavior modification.

MR. ROVELLI:

JUSTICE SOUTER:

All right.

What about the

14

that would affect that analysis.

17

18

The -- the Court has said, yes, you

I don't see where the

No right of access to

The associational rights can be abridged and so

Why, on your analysis, wouldn't -- wouldn't

19

the proper disposition of the earlier case have been to

20

say, yes, the State can preclude marriage too because

21

that's something they very much want and -- and the

22

State can preclude that unless they shape up and -- and

23

get down to a -- a lesser level of security?

24
25

MR. ROVELLI:

Well, the marriage ban, Justice

Souter, of course, is subject to Turner analysis as

13
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

well, and I think that where Turner might bring up

2

short a ban on marriage for these high security inmates

3

is in the -- the logical connection to the

4

rehabilitative purpose in that there being so few

5

inmates and marriage is going to be such an infrequent

6

occasion, it's hard to see the marriage ban as

7

influencing level 2 inmates generally to improve their

8

behavior.

9
10

JUSTICE SOUTER:

is not a logical connection there within --

11

MR. ROVELLI:

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

13

Yes.

MR. ROVELLI:

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

That -- yes.
But there would be a logical

connection for those who want to get married.

17

MR. ROVELLI:

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

19

-- the meaning of the -- of

the case?

14

16

So you're saying there just

That -- that implicates -You're -- you're saying it

might not make sense as a systemic policy --

20

MR. ROVELLI:

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yes.
-- because it isn't a big

22

enough problem.

23

whole system here.

24

less, and if some of those 40 people want to get

25

married, why doesn't it make perfect sense to say no

But for -- we're not talking about a

marriage?
MR. ROVELLI:

Well, you could say that about

3

all -- probably a range of things if you went so far as

4

to query each inmate as to what it is that they value

5

most or what it is they're most interested in doing --

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

7

analysis, why isn't that sufficient?

8
9

MR. ROVELLI:

You can, and on -- on your

It would be an interesting

program and I would defend it that you could query

10

inmates on what is most valuable and then deprive them

11

of it subject to --

12
13
14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay, but how do we get

around the marriage case then?
MR. ROVELLI:

Well, I -- I don't think we

15

need to get around the marriage case in the sense that,

16

particularly as to high security inmates, prison

17

officials have very wide discretion to fashion policies

18

that serve the goals.

19
20
21

And -- and to do it --

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So as to these, the -- the

marriage could be banned, in effect, you're saying.
MR. ROVELLI:

It could be banned, but I do

22

think that it would be subject to a -- a pointed

23

challenge on the logical connection, but in theory,

24

it's -- it is one of the instruments -- a privilege

25

that could be withdrawn for behavior modification

15
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

purposes.
This case is -- is exceedingly similar to

3

Overton where the Court directly observed that

4

withdrawing visitation privileges is a proper and even

5

necessary technique to -- to improve the behavior

6

especially of high-security prisoners who have few

7

privileges left -- left to lose, which is precisely the

8

same situation that we're presented with in this case.

9
10
11

Turner too -- I'm sorry.

Overton as well is

instructive on the subject of adequate alternatives.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But I thought there, there

12

was a genuine security concern, which I think you

13

pretty much said doesn't exist here when you consider

14

what they can have in -- in the cell.

15

MR. ROVELLI:

I think that -- that in both

16

Overton and this case, there were both behavior

17

modification and security concerns.

18

sure that their weight -- they're weighted as between

19

the two altogether different between the two cases.

20

Actually all of the discussion in Overton was in the

21

context of behavior modification, which is related both

22

to security and to rehabilitation.

23

tenor of the discussion was actually, I would say, more

24

directed to rehabilitation.

25

And I'm not even

do we tell when -- when you can deprive someone of

6

something they -- to modify their behavior and when it

7

goes too far?

I take it somewhere -- you couldn't deprive them

8
9

MR. MARCUS:

I mean, how

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

This --

I mean, this Court has already said that with respect

10

to Eighth Amendment rights, the Turner analysis does

11

not apply.

12

necessities, health care, food, and water, the -- the

13

Turner analysis doesn't apply, and so you could not

14

sort of create an incentive program to take away Eighth

15

Amendment rights.

16

So with respect to basic -- basic

And under -- with respect to the rights that

17

can be -- that can be limited in order to serve

18

legitimate penological interests, we think that -- that

19

the Turner approach would give a lot of deference to

20

and a lot of flexibility to States to -- to use

21

incentive programs --

22

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But don't we -- don't we

23

have the same problem if we're -- if we're dealing with

24

First Amendment interests that we do when we're dealing

25

with Eighth Amendment interests?

In other words, if --

if we don't say, well, they get outside of Turner

analysis because they require -- by virtue of being

3

enumerated rights, they require an analysis specific to

4

them, is the abridgement of the right carried so far

5

that it is unreasonable?

6

don't see, as your friends on the other side have

7

argued, I don't see where the logical stopping point is

8

if we accept the -- the behavior modification theory.

9

MR. MARCUS:

If we don't say that, then I

Well, I -- I think -- I mean, I

10

think there is -- I don't think it's a boundless

11

theory.

13

last resort.

14

regulation applies to are a narrow class of 40

15

prisoners who have been the most violent and most

16

disruptive --

17
18

I think you have to keep in mind that this

I mean, the prisoners that this

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Oh, oh, I -- I realize that.

I mean, they're -- they're making an in extremis kind

19

of argument.

20

accept an in extremis kind of argument on the theory of

21

behavior modification, then I don't see why that

22

argument does not, for example, cover the marriage

23

case, and maybe -- maybe it should.

24

that argument would not allow for a total deprivation

25

of all communication outside of, let's say, access to

I understand that.

But if -- if we

I don't know why

2

And -- and so it seems to me that whether we

3

admit it or not, what's going on here, whether we call

4

it Turner analysis or not, is we're making some kind of

5

a judgment as to whether they're carrying the

6

deprivation for behavior modification purposes in these

7

extreme cases too far.

8

MR. MARCUS:

JUSTICE SOUTER:

10

But -And if that's what -- I'll

-- I'll be quiet in a second.

11

(Laughter.)

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

If that's -- if that's what

13

we're doing, aren't we just as much outside the Turner

14

analysis when we're talking about the First Amendment

15

or associational rights under the First Amendment as we

16

are when we're talking about the Eighth Amendment?

17

shouldn't we say so?

MR. MARCUS:

Souter.

20

analysis to apply the exaggerated response test, and

21

that's one of the things the Turner analysis does when

22

you go through the four factors, as -- as the

23

Government did and the State has done in its brief,

24

that there could be a situation where you would find

25

that there's been an exaggerated response and that

I think there's still room under the Turner

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

their withdrawal of the First Amendment right is

2

actually an exaggerated response.

3

For example, maybe if -- if there was just

4

one minor disciplinary violation for, let's say, using

5

obscene language, and then every -- all First Amendment

6

rights to communication were -- were pulled out at that

7

point for the remainder of the time --

10

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So -- so but at some point,

there's sort of a reasonableness limit then you're
saying.

11

MR. MARCUS:

12

and we've -- we've --

13

There is a reasonableness limit,

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Do -- do you concede that

14

just because a right is enumerated, it means it cannot

be entirely taken away in prison?

No.

an incentive program like this could be struck down as

challenge is.

18

think you do -- you do still go through all the -- all

four factors, and you would look at the fourth factor

and see that, in fact, Pennsylvania does give prisoners

the opportunity to regain those privileges if they

I think it would be a rare case.

MR. MARCUS:

They can regain

But the -- the only thing that

Well, we do think that -- that

7

the State can go -- can go quite far with respect to

restricting First Amendment rights, but this Court

still -- I mean, under prong two, this Court does look

10

to alternative means to exercise the right.

11

99.9 percent of the prisoners in Pennsylvania, do get

12

to possess newspapers, magazines, and photos.

13

prisoners who graduate get to, and on top of that,

14

while they're in the LTSU, the prisoners get to possess

15

two books.

16

And here,

The LTSU

Mr. Marcus, I was kind of

interested in your calling this an incentive program.

Is there any -- there are no intermediate stages.

an all-or-nothing incentive, isn't it?

20

MR. MARCUS:

Oh, not at all.

It's

There are many

-- there are many intermediate stages.

22

restricted housing units and then there are SMUs and

MR. MARCUS:

There are incentive programs

within each of those restricted units, and -- and the

3

prisoners that end up at the LTSU -- the vast majority

4

of them have already been through the SMU program and

5

haven't made it and have failed that program.

6

they've tried numerous other incentives before getting

7

to this point.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, I didn't understand

that the -- the prisoners in this particular part of

the prison had any intermediate incentive.

Isn't that

So

MR. MARCUS:

Right, and that depends on their

behavior.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

There's no scoring.

You've

got 25 points now, so you're pretty close to your goal

or anything like -- it's not --

22

MR. MARCUS:

Well --- not like most incentive

Justice Stevens, they get a

review after 90 days and then every 30 days thereafter.

24

There's nothing in the record to suggest those reviews

are an empty gesture.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And -- and does the review

2

correlate it in any way with these particular

3

deprivations?

4

the review correlate with their inability to get

5

reading materials?

6

I mean, what is the review -- how does

MR. MARCUS:

Well, the -- the review

7

correlates with their behavior, and to the extent they

8

show a positive adjustment in their behavior, their --

9

they graduate from level 2 to level 1 where they do

10

have access to newspapers and magazines and then they

11

can graduate all the way out.

12

a number of prisoners have done that within 1 year.

13

And with respect to someone who never gets out, that

14

person might have an as-applied challenge if that

15

person could show that his behavior --

16

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And my understanding is

Is there any evidence at

17

all that the amount of reading that they do has any

18

correlation to their opportunity for getting better

19

assignments?

20

MR. MARCUS:

21

JUSTICE STEVENS:

While they're in the LTSU?
Yes.

That there's any

22

correlation whatsoever between how much these people --

23

these prisoners read and when they get into the next

24

level of the prison.

25

MR. MARCUS:

No, I don't think any such study

is done.

between the regulation and the goals need merely be

5

logical.

6

But again, the court of appeals was wrong to

be precisely the same if the State denied totally any

issue.

10
11

MR. MARCUS:

14

Well, it would be a more

difficult case to defend under the second --

12
13

We'd have the same

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Why would it be more

difficult?
MR. MARCUS:

-- under the second prong of

15

Turner because under the second prong of Turner, you

16

look to alternative means.

17

and defend that program, but here they do provide

18

alternative means to read and to see loved ones through

19

visitation and through correspondence and to have two

20

-- they have two books in their cell so they can

21

continue reading.

22

into the balance, and we think it -- it's very clear

23

that Pennsylvania's program is reasonable, and it would

24

just be a more difficult case if they totally

25

prohibited --

We might still come in here

So there -- that -- that does factor

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I understood your argument

2

to, in effect, contend that the behavior modification

3

rationale will justify the program no matter what the

4

balancing process is.

5

MR. MARCUS:

No, that's -- that's not our

6

position.

7

and you do -- you do look at all four factors of the

test.

satisfies that test.

We think there is a balancing under Turner,

wouldn't pass the test.

12

these are the worst of the worst and they've gone

13

through many other -- Pennsylvania has gone through

14

countless other measures to try to improve these

15

inmates' behavior, and so I think it's wrong to

16

conclude, as the court of appeals did, that this was an

exaggerated response.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JERE KRAKOFF

22

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

23

MR. KRAKOFF:

24

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

25

MR. KRAKOFF:

Mr. Chief Justice -Mr. Krakoff.

-- may it please the Court:

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

3

I'd like an opportunity to respond to several
of the points that were made by my colleague.
First, I find it interesting that and also of

4

some relevance in this case that the decision to deny

5

access to secular newspapers and magazines that this

6

policy of withdrawing access to these materials is not

7

a policy of the Federal Bureau of Prison with respect

8

to its most maximum security inmates, those who are

9

housed in the control units.

10

I also think it's important to note that

11

while there's a 90-day minimum period that these

12

inmates have to remain in the Long Term Segregation

13

Unit on level 2 status where this -- when this policy

14

applies, the policy also says that as long as an inmate

15

is serving a disciplinary sentence within the prison,

16

that he's not eligible for promotion to level 1.

17

the testimony from the department's designated witness,

18

Deputy -- Superintendent Dickson, acknowledged that

19

most of the inmates in the unit are, indeed, serving

20

disciplinary time.

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And

Well -- well, it seems to

22

me that that's an as-applied challenge.

23

particular inmate -- the terms of -- the conditions of

24

confinement are particularly harsh and he -- he or she

25

has an unrealistic opportunity to get to a less

If -- if a

28
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

1

restrictive confinement, then -- then he can bring a

2

suit.

3

MR. KRAKOFF:

I was -- I was simply trying to

4

point out -- the -- the Court had asked how long are

5

inmates generally in the Long Term Segregation Unit,

6

and -- and the point that I made is that it's not

7

unusual for inmates to remain on level 2 for periods in

8

excess of 1 year.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Mr. Krakoff, what --

10

I take it you wouldn't have any objection to

11

terminating of television rights, for example.

12

prisoners have the right to watch television, they

13

misbehave, the penalty is no television.

14

right?

15

MR. KRAKOFF:

That is correct.

If

Is that all

Our position

16

is that the choice of what vehicle the institution

17

wants to permit through which inmates can gain access

18

to what is occurring outside of the prison walls in

19

political and other public matters, that's the

20

institution's choice.

21

sued for access to newspapers and magazines is because

22

the representative plaintiff, Mr. Banks, was allowed to

23

receive his Christian Science Monitor magazine because

24

it was religious in nature, but was denied the

25

opportunity to receive his Christian Science Monitor

And the reason these inmates

There's another very important --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What other

alternatives would you have the prison administrators

MR. KRAKOFF:

Okay.

They go through every
What -- what should

Bottom line under my

10

reading of Turner and Safley is that there has to be

11

first that logical connection under the first prong.

12

But that's not a -- an imperative --

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'm sorry.

What

14

should they have done instead?

15

of the prison 1 hour every other day.

16

taken that hour out?

17

Out of his cell.

18

away, or what -- what other options do they have?

19

Let's say he gets out
Should they have

I mean, not out of the prison.

Should they have taken that hour

MR. KRAKOFF:

Well, what their -- their

20

argument is essentially that this policy was basically

21

a decision by default, not a decision that was reasoned

22

by prison administrators.

23

said virtually everything has been taken away from

24

these prisoners.

25

They -- they essentially

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Right, and I want you

1

to tell me --

3

MR. KRAKOFF:

And we have nothing left to

take away.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I would like you to

5

tell me what else they should have done.

6

wrong?

7

MR. KRAKOFF:

Why is that

It's wrong because there is no

8

logical connection to taking something away under the

9

facts of this case when taking away an entire litany of

10

-- or a very broad spectrum of things which -- in the

11

special management units, where these inmates came

12

from, they had had magazines taken away on their first

13

phase in the special management units.

14

offered the incentive of earning access to magazines,

15

of earning access to weekly visits with family members,

16

of earning access to telephone calls, in fact, of

17

earning access for release from their cells the 23

18

hours a day to engage in -- in small group activities

19

with other inmates.

20

the opportunity, while in the special management unit,

21

to earn a 3- to 6-month probationary period in a

22

general population cell block.

23
24
25

They had been

And most spectacular was they had

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And none of that

worked. Right?
MR. KRAKOFF:

Absolutely.

And my point is if

31
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

-- if that didn't work, including magazines, which is

2

the equivalent of -- essentially of -- of newspapers,

3

they had no logical or --

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So your answer to my

5

question is there's nothing else they could have done,

6

but they shouldn't have done this because this wasn't

7

going to work either.

8
9
10

MR. KRAKOFF:

My answer is that you can't

deprive an inmate of his constitutional right of free
speech --

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

12

MR. KRAKOFF:

13
14

No, but consistent --

-- unless there's reason to do

so.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

Consistently with your

15

answer, it seems to me, you have to say they should

16

give the TV back, they should give the magazines back

17

because none of those worked either.

18

First Amendment deprivations to some degree.

19
20
21

MR. KRAKOFF:

And those are

What they've done here is

they've removed all of the vehicles to -JUSTICE SOUTER:

No.

But I mean, what's --

22

what's your answer to my question?

23

your point to the Chief Justice was the courts have to

24

review the efficacy of these moves.

25

MR. KRAKOFF:

It seems to me that

That's right.

32
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And if -- if there is no

2

efficacy and there is an infringement of what, at least

3

for people on the outside, would be a protected right,

4

then they have no justification for taking those rights

5

away.

6

-- on the argument you just gave, they've got to give

7

the TV rights back, they've got to give the magazine

8

rights back, and so on.

10

And if that's going to be the analysis, then on

Isn't that correct?
May I answer it this way?

know I'm supposed to say yes or no and then --

11

(Laughter.)

12

MR. KRAKOFF:

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

14

-- to give an explanation.
I sure would like that, but

--

15

(Laughter.)

16

MR. KRAKOFF:

17

I

I'll say no.

My instinct is

no, and I would also say the --

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

19

MR. KRAKOFF:

But then why?

Why?

I've been reading Turner v.

20

Safley and then more recently Overton because this is

21

basic in my practice to represent prisoners.

22

reading of Overton is that you can't have a policy.

23

The prison officials cannot have a policy unless there

24

is reason to believe that the policy is going to

25

advance a legitimate penological interest.

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Right.

And in -- in your

2

argument, in your answer to the Chief Justice, you were

3

pointing out a situation in which taking away the TV

4

didn't work, taking away the magazines didn't work.

5

MR. KRAKOFF:

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

7

10

Why then do they not, on

your theory, have to give TV and magazines back?

8
9

I think --

MR. KRAKOFF:

I -- I think that an

institution can always make judgments about how
extensive they want to allow inmates to --

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

All right.

Then where does

12

your efficacy criterion go?

13

make judgments, and apparently they may -- may make

14

judgments and maintain them even if those judgments do

15

not, in fact, advance their interests.

16

saying they -- it's not going to advance their

17

interests, so they can't do it.

18

saying they don't advance their interests, but they can

that line.

to the inmates, but that's exactly the State's point.

That's the reason it's taken away.

it's the heart of your case and that it surfaces here

17

in the answers you've attempted to give.

18

MR. KRAKOFF:

Obviously, this -- this did

19

matter enough to the prisoners to commence a lawsuit.

20

I don't think that the standard by which a court --

21

this Court or any other Federal court should determine

22

whether or not there's a logical connection or a

23

reasonable connection is whether or not inmates choose

24

to file suit.

25

That's establishing a litmus test --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

35
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

for the suit is that it matters to the prisoner, and

2

that's exactly why it's been taken away because there's

3

nothing else left that we can do with these prisoners.

4

MR. KRAKOFF:

But I see a distinction.

There

5

are lots of things that matters to prisoners and lots

of things that matter to us in the free world that

7

aren't going to change our behavior.

people's behavior?

11

no good is based upon the fact that it has not altered

MR. KRAKOFF:

Well, but if you look --

would be suspended.

So let's say if -- if the

22

flaw is it doesn't deter other people because they

it all over so everyone knows about it, then it's okay?

25

MR. KRAKOFF:

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

1

make a deterrence argument, at least an argument that

2

makes sense to me, that in order to deter somebody from

3

doing something, they have to know about that policy

4

and they have to know what the consequences are.

5

there were a secret policy in the State of Indiana that

6

they, you know, will execute persons committing first

that the death penalty is going to act as a deterrent I

17

for the reasons said.

Yes, and -- and I -- I do want

to say -- and I don't know how to say it more -- more

22

clearly -- I understand it, but I'm obviously not

23

framing this in a way that is getting my point across.

24

I'm not suggesting that because people -- these are

the most incorrigible, recalcitrant inmates in the

Alderson Reporting Company

2

that they can get anything that they want.

I'm suggesting that when you take away a very

significant right -- and that is the ability to learn

5

what is happening beyond the prison walls -- there has

6

to be a reasonable basis for doing so.

So I thought that's why

you were using that, just to say that the -- the

achieve exactly the same end.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So if visitors -- if

there's a security issue with visitors to the prisoner,

you're saying you can't prohibit visitors because if

you allow the lawyers to come in, because they're

9

visitors too?

10
11
12

MR. KRAKOFF:

No, I think that would be a

specious argument.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but it wouldn't

13

undermine the security rationale just because you have

14

some exceptions where there are other countervailing

15

interests that might outweigh the security concern.

16

MR. KRAKOFF:

But if, in fact, their

suggestion is that -- if their suggestion is that the

inmates are less likely to burn a Bible, for example,

and assuming they're -- they're Christians rather than

makes sense.

newspaper, that doesn't make sense.

MR. KRAKOFF:

And I think we make out a

strong case -- that we make out a strong case for why

10

the policy in question is not reasonably related to a

legitimate penological interest.

12

I would suggest, looking at another aspect,

13

Justice Breyer, that there was some comment about the

14

adequacies of the -- the alternatives, the other

15

avenues, and that's an important consideration under

16

the second prong of -- of Turner.

17

it's strange to suggest that the prison chaplain who

18

visits level 2 inmates for religious purposes and that

19

attorneys, assuming that an inmate has an attorney,

20

generally are going to come discuss either a section

21

1983 action or a criminal case, and that relatives once

23

MR. KRAKOFF:

Yes.
You said that the prison

grapevine really doesn't tell the prisoners about this

5

particular lack of access to public materials.

6

the prison grapevine let them know that they're going

MR. KRAKOFF:

Does

They're actually, Your Honor --

JUSTICE STEVENS:

If that is generally known,

11

it would seem to me that that itself would be

12

sufficient incentive to try and avoid this program,

13

whether or not you're going to be able to read the

14

Christian Science Monitor or the New York Times.

15

seems to me that the -- the -- what we're fighting

about is trivial compared to the very obvious deterrent

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LOUIS J. ROVELLI

14

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

15

MR. ROVELLI:

Very briefly, if -- if I might

16

turn myself to just the very first point that Mr.

17

Krakoff made about inmates being compelled to stay in

18

the Long Term Segregation Unit until they complete

19

their disciplinary custody.

20

attention to pages 40 and 41 of the joint appendix,

21

which show that -- that the unit manager has the

22

authority to set aside disciplinary custody, and an

23

inmate who graduates the Long Term Segregation Unit

24

gets all of their disciplinary custody set aside

25

completely.

I would draw your

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Rovelli, do the other

5

anyway, so it doesn't deter anybody.

MR. ROVELLI:

I'd like you to respond to

The principal means by which

7

other prisoners would know about it is the very

8

effective prison grapevine, although it does appear in

9

the -- in a chart that's appended to the handbook for

10

the special management unit, and 75 percent of the

11

inmates who wind up at level 2 come from the special

12

management unit.

13

The other thing I would point out about the

14

effectiveness of this program, as opposed to the give-

15

up-on-them proposition, is that even at -- even in

16

2002, when the program was only 2 years old, 25 percent

17

of the inmates who had been sent there had graduated.

18

The statistics on that are at pages 7 and 8 of our

19

reply brief.

20

Finally, if -- if the Court were to affirm

21

the court of appeals, then this case has to be sent

back to trial and the burden is put on the prison

system to demonstrate empirically that this regulation

can achieve its goals.
