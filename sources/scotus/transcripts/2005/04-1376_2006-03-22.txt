ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID M. GOSSETT

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

MR. GOSSETT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Using the ordinary tools of statutory

11

construction, it is clear that Congress intended the

12

1996 reinstatement provision to apply only

13

prospectively.

14

intent as to the retroactive applicability of that

15

provision, under Landgraf it would, nonetheless, not

16

apply in this case.

17

But even if Congress had no specific

Applying it to aliens who reentered before

18

IIRIRA's effective date would give the statute an

19

impermissibly retroactive effect.

20

aliens were entitled to seek, and eligible to receive,

21

discretionary relief from deportation.

22

provision is applied to them, they are not.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Before IIRIRA, such

Now if the

Wouldn't it be the

24

same result if Congress decided, for example, to take

25

away one of the available methods of seeking

discretionary review, just saying, "We're not going to

2

have that available anymore"?

3

MR. GOSSETT:

Congress might change the

4

specific types of review that are available, and then

5

this Court would have to -- but would either have to --

6

would have to engage in a Landgraf analysis of whether

7

--

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

9

MR. GOSSETT:

10

But that would be --

-- that would be --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

-- a pretty easy

11

case, wouldn't it?

12

saying some -- an alien in this position can apply for,

13

you know, this type of relief, this type of relief, or

14

another, and they say, "Well, we're not going to allow

15

this type of relief anymore.

16

those" -- was -- that's a pretty easy case, under

17

Landgraf, isn't it?

18

I mean, if you have a mechanism

MR. GOSSETT:

We're going to change

The -- yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

19

And the transition from suspension of deportation to

20

cancellation of removal would fall into that category.

21

However, the reinstatement provision talks in terms --

22

in categorical terms of any forms of relief from

23

deportation.

24

of relief that would be available --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It doesn't specify the particular types

MR. GOSSETT:

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- and, therefore --- why should that make a

difference as to whether it's retroactive or not?

Now, you could argue that -- if you want,

8

that there are some due process violations in making

that prospective law affect past activities as they do.

10

I mean, let's -- one of the examples given in

11

Landgraf, or at least in my concurrence in Landgraf,

12

was a change of the law procedure so that expert

13

testimony, which previously was not admissible, is now

14

admissible.

15

that's involved in the next case that comes up when

16

that new procedural rule is applied, he can say, "Well,

you know, you've changed -- you've changed the rules on

me.

21

can inquire into under the due process clause, but

22

nobody would say that that procedural change is

23

retroactive.

Now, the person who committed the crime

going on here.

MR. GOSSETT:

Two responses, Justice Scalia.

3

The first is, I think it's unfair to say that this

4

provision merely regulates the procedure of removal.

5
6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

My

point --

7

MR. GOSSETT:

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

That wasn't my point.

The --- was, you look to the --

to the activity which is governed by the new law.

In

10

the case of the -- of the expert testimony, the

11

activity governed is the trial, so that law applies

12

prospectively to all future trials.

13

case, this law applies prospectively to all future

14

removals, QED.

15

have an argument, although I don't think it's a very

16

good one, that there are due process problems involved

17

in this prospective law.

call the law retroactive.

19

So, also, in this

It is not retroactive.

MR. GOSSETT:

Now, you may

But I don't see how you can

20

the reinstatement provision, besides for the provision

barring other forms of relief, I would agree, are

raising those here.

think can only fairly be categorized as regulating the

process of reentry, not the process of removal.

His reentry occurred.

It -- how could

it possibly have anything to do with his reentry?
MR. GOSSETT:

Under Your Honor's analysis, a

12

statute that said that if the Attorney General finds

13

that an alien has reentered in the past, the alien may

14

be sentenced to 15 years in prison, would also merely

15

be procedural and governing the sentencing rather than

the underlying act of reentry.

That's

Therefore, I think it's unfair

Of course, we don't even

10

change here, or a substantive change, unless we get to

11

stage two of the Landgraf analysis under the -- under,

12

I would say, either the majority's approach in Landgraf

13

or your approach, Justice Scalia, because the first

14

stage of Landgraf is about this Court's deferring to

15

Congress's specific intent as to the applicability of a

16

statute, because if Congress has decided whether a

17

statute should apply prospectively or retroactively,

18

this Court defers to that, outside of the ex post facto

19

context.

20

Congress intended the 1996 reinstatement provision to

21

apply only prospectively.

22

And I think here it's clear that, in fact,

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Has any -- a number of

23

courts have considered this question -- have any of

24

them accepted your first -- your argument that the

25

statute is clear that it is nonretroactive?

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. GOSSETT:

Yes, Justice Ginsburg, both the

2

Sixth and the Ninth Circuits have accepted that

3

argument.

4

form than we are currently raising, because before the

5

Government's brief in this case, no one has laid out

6

the history of the 1950 and 1952 statutes as carefully

7

as the Solicitor General's Office now has.

8

the Sixth and Ninth Circuit have held that this statute

9

is exclusively prospective by a comparison between the

11

1952 Act and the 1996 Act.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I'd -- I'll have to look

12

at those decisions.

13

did, indeed, hold that it was retroactive, but not on

14

the ground that Congress had clearly spoken to the

15

point, so that you didn't need any further inquiry.

16

It was my impression that they

MR. GOSSETT:

Both -- they didn't use the

17

term "clearly," because, of course, as we explained in

18

our brief, there's an asymmetry in retroactivity

19

analysis, and using the ordinary tools of statutory

20

construction, one can demonstrate a prospective intent

21

on the part of Congress.

22

Ninth Circuit, in the Bejjani case and the Castro-

23

Cortez case, did stop their retroactivity analysis at

24

stage one of the Landgraf inquiry --

MR. GOSSETT:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- I think that's because

3

they were using the version of stage one that you are

4

using, which includes, in the consideration of whether

5

Congress has been clear, an inquiry into whether the --

6

whether the law is retroactive or not, which, as I

7

understand it, should be left to stage two,

8

exclusively.

10

MR. GOSSETT:

I --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Your analysis in your brief

11

mingles the two.

12

can take into account in stage one is whether it's

13

retroactive.

14

to speak that way.

15

all other indicia of legislative intent, other than the

16

normal rule against retroactivity, in deciding

17

congressional intent, and then you go to stage two,

18

which is where retroactivity comes in.

19

It says one of the factors that you

And as I -- I don't understand Landgraf
I thought you were supposed to use

MR. GOSSETT:

In both the St. Cyr's case and

20

the Lindh case, this Court did invoke the presumption

21

against retroactivity in its stage one analysis.

22

more generally, I don't think we need a presumption to

23

win this case.

24

an inquiry into congressional intent -- what we have in

25

this case is a history of Congress providing for the

But,

I think that -- under stage one, under

10
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

reinstatement of deportation that goes back to 1950.

2

In 1950, Congress passed a reinstatement provision that

3

said that for the specified aliens -- and it was only a

4

subgroup -- if they were deported and reentered, they

5

would be -- that their previous deportation order would

6

be reinstated.

7

at page 2 of the Government's brief -- the INS

8

interpreted that statute as applying only

9

prospectively, and only applying to an alien who was

The INS -- and that statute's quoted

10

deported, and, therefore, obviously reinstated --

11

reentering after the effective date of that statute.

12

Now, in 1952, Congress, evidently

13

dissatisfied with an interpretation -- with a

14

reinstatement provision that was only prospective,

15

added the "before or after" language to the

16

reinstatement provision.

Act, "If you were deported, either before or after the

18

effective date of the INA, your deportation order can

22

category of reentrants could be subject to

reinstatement.

So, it's not really a

Actually, Justice Scalia, under

our stage one argument, we are now arguing that, in

10

fact, the Government is right, that the 1952 Act was

11

tied to the date of deportation.

12

understand is how the Government thinks that helps its

13

case, because the obvious and necessary consequence of

14

that is that the removal of the "before or after"

15

clause in 1996 must imply that the 1996 provision only

16

is triggered by post-enactment deportations.

20

reasonable inference, but I think it's a real stretch

"clear," you want to be able to point to actual words.

that, elsewhere in IIRIRA, Congress specifically

And they did not do that in this

MR. GOSSETT:

They also specifically

delineated, in some context, Mr. Chief Justice, that it

would be retroactive.

comparison -- and I think it's an important one for

8

this Court to focus on -- is to the criminal

9

reinstatement provision, which is section 1326 -- 8

10
11

The Government's primary

U.S.C. at 1326.
Now, the Government asserts that that

12

provision is exclusively prospective, and, therefore,

13

that the comparison should be that, in this context,

14

the reinstatement provision must be retroactive.

15

in so arguing, the Government hides, in ellipses in its

16

brief, on page 14, the actual text of the provision of

17

the criminal -- the temporal applicability of the

18

criminal reentry provision.

19

said was that deportations that predate IIRIRA could

20

trigger reinstatement, but reentries post- -- only

21

reentries post-dating IIRIRA could trigger it.

22

fact, what Congress was doing in the criminal context

23

was reaching back and saying, "We're changing the

24

consequences of pre-enactment deportations, but not

applicability, to be exclusively prospective.

The first

And the

10

second is implausible because the -- the "before or

12

presumably have been brought forward, the 1996 Act, had

13

they wanted to, specified the date of enactment of this

14

Act.

15

the Senate proposal to modify the first -- the

16

provision also would have left it in terms of this Act,

17

not of a specific date of 1952, which would have been

18

the INA date.

19

It would have been about this Act.

And, in fact,

More generally, I think that with this

20

history of the 1950 Act, the 1952 Act, and the 1996

21

Act, any interpretation of the 1996 Act as being

22

retroactive, or as being ambiguously retroactive,

23

doesn't pay adequate deference to Congress's choice

24

over time that this Act should apply prospectively in

25

Why would -- I find it

difficult to understand why Congress wouldn't have

wanted this to apply to illegal entrants who had come

4

in before IIRIRA.

5

have been deported once, already deported once, and

6

then, in violation of the law, come back in again.

7

there was a regime for deporting them, which allowed

8

certain variations, which are eliminated by IIRIRA,

9

permission for them to stay.

Bear in mind, these are people who

And

You really think Congress

10

wanted to keep faith with the people who had, already

11

have -- having been deported once for illegal reentry

12

- illegal entry -- come in again -- and you think

13

Congress says, "Oh, well, you know, we have to keep

14

faith with these people who are violating our law, and

15

not -- and not deport them except under the conditions

16

that existed when they broke the law to reenter"?

find that a very -- what should I say? -- touching --

MR. GOSSETT:

Justice Scalia, clearly

Congress was attempting to change -- or to increase the

disincentives to reentry.

25

criminal reentry provisions.

At the same time that they

8
9

MR. GOSSETT:

The question, however, though,

is not whether they were trying to change that

10

consequence.

11

retroactively, because this Court presumes that if

12

Congress is trying to change the consequences of an

13

action that has occurred in the past in substantive

14

ways, Congress should say so explicitly, because, as

15

your -- you have said in previous decisions, it is a

16

foundational principle of Western law that primary --

17

the consequences of primary conduct are judged as --

The question is whether they did so

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. GOSSETT:

JUSTICE BREYER:

But is that --

-- of the time of that conduct.

I want to know,

21

if your client had known about this law or gone to a

22

lawyer and said, "What do I do now?" wouldn't the

23

lawyer have said, or would he have said, "Just leave.

24

Leave the country, quick, before you're caught.

be able to come in, in all likelihood."

3

right about that, the Act does not attach new

consequences to old behavior, it attaches new

consequences to new behavior; namely, the act of

6

staying within the United States, when you could leave.

MR. GOSSETT:

No, Justice Breyer, it does

not, because had he left in 1996, upon enactment of

Well --

-- as a result of having left.

Whereas, otherwise, otherwise, if he had stayed in the
country, he would be eligible to apply for suspension

JUSTICE BREYER:

Being -- if you get married

13

Okay.

But, of course, at the time --

7

pre-IIRIRA, the choice was: stay in the country and

seek

other routes.

-- and seek American citizenship through these
And so, the forcing of him to leave is

10

itself a retroactive effect of the enactment of this

11

Act --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MR. GOSSETT:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

15

Well, in this --

-- because --- in this case, he was

married after the effective date of the new statute.

16

MR. GOSSETT:

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Yes, Justice Kennedy.
Did Judge McConnell, in the

18

Tenth Circuit, suggest -- because he discussed this --

19

suggest that the result might have been different if

21

MR. GOSSETT:

effective date of IIRIRA.

4

first inquiry.

5

stage two analysis is on a categorical basis, because

6

Congress, in the statute, said that, at the time of

7

reentry, the mere act of reentry wouldn't categorically

8

preclude you from seeking any forms of relief from

9

deportation.

We think that's the wrong

We think that the way to approach the

And so, had Congress wanted to change

10

that, it would have -- it would have had to do so

11

retroactively on a categorical basis.

12

accepts Judge McConnell's analysis of the forms of

13

relief you're entitled to as of that date, at the very

14

least, at that point, my client would be eligible to

15

seek both voluntary departure and cancellation of

16

removal.

17

seek adjustment of status, because, although it's true

18

that he is not -- he was not, at that point, married to

19

his now-wife, adjustment of status was a -- is a

20

defense from deportation, and he would have been able

21

to get married even if put into deportation

22

proceedings.

23

now-wife had -- already had a 8-year-old son --

But even if one

1
2

that it was a real marriage.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

-- it does point out that

3

your argument is a difficult one, because this

4

expectation that you argue for is that, number one, he

5

has an expectation that he'd be able to adjust his

6

status even after Congress has changed the law

7

respecting reinstatement.

8

MR. GOSSETT:

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I don't think that's --

10

MR. GOSSETT:

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

12
13

This is --

-- a difficult analysis.
-- this is a far-reaching

expectation on his part.
MR. GOSSETT:

The only expectation, Justice

14

Kennedy, that we are proposing is that my client -- and

15

aliens, generally, because this is an analysis that

16

must be done on a categorical basis -- reasonably

17

expected that Congress wouldn't change the consequences

18

of their reentries far in the past without doing so

19

explicitly.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Am I wrong in thinking

21

that readjustment based on his marriage was not one of

22

the modes of relief that he could have had in '82 or --

23

that that didn't come in until much later, is that so?

24

MR. GOSSETT:

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That is true, Justice Ginsburg.
So, any -- so, that was a

25
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

consequence that certainly wasn't taken away from him,

2

because it wasn't there in '82.

3

MR. GOSSETT:

In 1982, Justice Ginsburg, my

4

client reasonably presumed that the act of reentry,

5

while itself a crime and while itself rendering him

6

deportable, wouldn't categorically preclude him from

7

seeking relief from deportation if, at a future date,

8

he might become eligible to adjust in some way, either

9

through suspension of deportation by having been here

10

for 7 years, or by marrying an American citizen, or by

11

having a reasonable claim for asylum.

12

were routes to stay, despite illegal entry or reentry.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

All of these

Even though what --

Why would he think that?

15

Why wouldn't he just think, being here illegally, he is

16

subject to being deported under such rules as the

17

country has for deporting people who are here

18

illegally, whatever they may be, from time to time?

19

That would be my expectation if I came in illegally, in

20

violation of the law.

21

sufferance of the country.

22

whatever rules they have for kicking me out are the

23

rules that I'll have to abide by."

I'm saying, "I'm here at the

MR. GOSSETT:

Justice Scalia, the implication

3

of your argument is that a wrongdoer has no reasonable

4

expectation in the law staying constant.

5

course, both the Hughes Aircraft and the Landgraf

6

decisions are cases in which a conduct was clearly

7

illegal or unlawful at the time it was done, but,

8

nonetheless, a change in the law would retroactively

9

change the implications of that unlawful conduct.

But, of

And

10

this Court, in both those cases, held that it was --

11

that such change cannot be effected retroactively.

expectations, and that's what the Court fastened on.

17

Isn't that so?

18
19

MR. GOSSETT:

That's true, Justice Ginsburg.

However, the parallel in St. Cyr is that at the time

20

the immigrant in St. Cyr pled guilty, he was

21

presumptively deportable as a result of having pled

22

guilty to a crime.

discretionary relief from deportation, which this Court

called "a matter of grace" in the St. Cyr decision.

I

It's unclear to me whether or

not the St. Cyr case would also generalize to someone

who simply was convicted of a crime at that date.

there's a debate in the lower courts about that.

more generally, in my client's context, at the very

But,

10

least his decision to stay in the United States for 7

11

years, and thus become eligible for suspension of

deportation, and then not to leave thereafter, was,

13

itself, a very similar choice to that of the alien in

14

St. Cyr.

rather than to leave.

16

It's a conscious decision to remain here,

JUSTICE SOUTER:

to criminal prosecution for his prior illegal entry if

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN

5

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

6
7

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:

8

Section 1231(a)(5) aims to streamline the

9

removal of aliens who were already removed but have

10

since illegally reentered.

11

IIRIRA did not intend to grandfather the provision and

12

exempt those aliens who are already in the country

13

illegally.

14

for getting illegal reentrants out of the country is

15

fully applicable, and, indeed, is especially applicable

16

to illegal reentrants who were already in the country

17

at the time of IIRIRA's enactment.

18

The Congress that enacted

Rather, the focus on streamlining the rules

Three considerations, I think, point to the

19

conclusion that section 1231(a)(5) is addressed to

20

removing illegal reentrants from the country, including

21

aliens who are already in the country, and that the

22

provision is not so much addressed to the antecedent

23

act of illegal reentry, as such.

24
25

The first consideration I would point to is
the operation of the provision.

And it's useful to

29
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

bear in mind the following possible scenario in which a

2

person, who's been removed, illegally reenters the

3

country, but then returns to his home country.

4

that situation the individual would have engaged in the

5

act of illegal reentry, but section 1231(a)(5) simply

6

would have no relevance to him whatsoever, because what

7

section 1231(a)(5) seeks to do is to remove someone

8

who's found in the country on the basis of their

9

previous removal order.

Now, in

Now, if they have engaged in

10

the act of illegal reentry, but then have gone back,

11

section 1231(a)(5) simply is not relevant.

12

that goes to show that what the statute is focused on

13

is not the act of illegal reentry, as such, but,

14

rather, removing someone who's found in the country and

15

who's determined to be an illegal reentrant.

16

And I think

Now, that operation stands in significant

17

contrast to the criminal prohibition against illegal

18

reentry, which is at 8 U.S.C. 1326, and the prohibition

19

against illegal entry, which is 8 U.S.C. 1325.

20

respect to both of those provisions, the act of illegal

21

reentry, or the act of illegal entry, necessarily

22

triggers the operation of the criminal prohibition, and

23

there's nothing that the alien can do after the fact to

24

take himself outside of the -- of the purview of that

25

criminal --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And those --

2

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Should --

3

MR. SRINIVASAN:

I'm sorry?

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And those provisions are

5

specifically recited to apply only to reentrants after

6

the effective date.

7

MR. SRINIVASAN:

That's right.

Congress

8

specifically indicated, in the text of IIRIRA, that

9

it's -- it understood the distinction between the way

10

in which those provisions operate and the way that

11

1231(a)(5) operates.

12

the criminal prohibition on an illegal reentry, and it

13

also, for the first time, imposed civil monetary

14

penalties on the act of illegal entry.

15

civil fines, and then -- I think, $50 to $250 per

16

episode.

17

both of those changes, Congress specified, in the terms

18

of IIRIRA, that they would only apply, on a prospective

19

basis, to acts of illegal entry or reentry that post

20

dated IIRIRA.

21

with respect to 1231(a)(5), and I think that's

22

significant, because what that indicates is that

23

Congress understood that that provision, unlike the two

24

criminal -- unlike the two criminal provisions, focuses

25

not on the act of illegal reentry, as such, but rather

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, let me go back to the

3

criminal provision for a second.

4

to the question I asked your brother a moment ago is

5

that if the individual reenters, and, hence, has

6

committed a criminal offense, and later voluntarily

7

returns to -- in this case, to Mexico, that the

8

criminal violation, in effect, would not, in any sense,

9

be canceled out.

I take it your answer

10

MR. SRINIVASAN:

That's right.

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And that if he returned, he

12

could be prosecuted for the prior reentry.

13

suppose, in theory -- I don't know what the extradition

14

treaty is -- in theory, he might be subject to

15

extradition for it.

And I

MR. SRINIVASAN:

completed at the moment that the criminal reentry is

24

completed, and nothing that he does afterwards can take

4

MR. SRINIVASAN:

That's right.

Which is

5

different, obviously, from the operation of section

6

1231(a)(5).

7

Now, another consideration that I think

8

indicates that section 1231(a)(5) is focused on the

9

timing of the removal, as opposed to the timing of

10

reentry, is to take into account section 1231(a)(5) in

11

the context of Section 1231 as a whole.

12

was a new provision that was enacted by IIRIRA, and

13

Congress entitled it, quote, "Detention and Removal of

14

Aliens Ordered Removed," close quote.

15

title indicates, the provisions in section 1231, like

16

1231(a)(5), all pertain to executing an order of

17

removal against an alien who's been ordered removed.

18

For example, those provisions concern the time period

19

within which somebody is to be removed.

20

the travel of somebody to the removal destination, the

21

identification of the countries to which they may be

22

removed, the payment of expenses.

23

address the execution of an order of removal in the

24

same way that section 1231(a)(5) does.

order of removal, the one that the alien had in place

2

when he illegally reentered the country, but it's of a

3

piece with those other provisions, in the sense that

4

it, like them, addresses the timing of removal rather

5

than speaking to the act of illegal reentry, as such.

6

The third consideration, I think, that points

7

to the same conclusion, which is that Congress was

8

focused prospectively on removals that postdated

9

IIRIRA, rather than retrospectively, in some sense, on

10

acts of illegal reentry that predated IIRIRA, is that

11

at the time of illegal reentry, as we explain in -- at

12

length in our brief, an alien would have had no

13

eligibility, as a categorical matter, and at least as a

14

practical matter, for the three types of relief that

15

Petitioner invokes.

16

are adjustment of status, suspension of deportation,

17

and voluntary departure.

18

And those three types of relief

Now, with respect to adjustment of status, as

19

the colloquy earlier indicated, at the time that

20

Petitioner illegally reentered the country in 1981, up

21

until 1994, which was just 2 years before IIRIRA,

22

adjustment of status was categorically unavailable to

23

illegal entrants and illegal reentrants.

24

light, it's -- one would be hard-pressed to assert that

25

an illegal reentrant would have performed that act in

of status.

It was simply --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You don't want to --

4

MR. SRINIVASAN:

-- unavailable.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You don't want us to decide

6

it on that ground, do you, so that all future cases

7

you'll have to decide whether he came in before '94 or

8

after '94, right?

9

MR. SRINIVASAN:

That's right, Justice

10

Scalia.

11

this statute is addressed to the removal, rather than

12

the act of illegal reentry, is that it decides, once

13

and for all, what the temporal reach of the statute is.

14
15

I think a virtue of focusing on the fact that

And -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but your point,

16

though -- I mean, someone illegally reentering at that

17

time might not have had a reasonable expectation of the

18

availability of discretionary relief.

19

hand, someone in the -- a petitioner's position, after

20

all that had happened, did have a fairly good case

21

under those provisions that were no longer available.

22

MR. SRINIVASAN:

On the other

Well, that might be, Mr.

23

Chief Justice, but his claim is that section 1231(a)(5)

24

should be construed not to apply to anyone who

25

illegally reentered before IIRIRA.

And so, I think the

35
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

proper frame of reference is to look, ex ante, at what

2

someone would be thinking, had they illegally reentered

3

before IIRIRA, because he seeks to treat everyone who

4

illegally reentered before IIRIRA as a uniform

5

category.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, and someone

7

entering says, "Well, obviously, if I'm detained the

8

day after I enter, I'm not going to have a very good

9

case.

On the other hand, if I'm not, and I happen to

10

make a life here, and I'm here for 20 years, and I get

11

married and I have a child, I'm going to have a strong

12

case," and he's going to -- he's willing to take his

13

chances.

14

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, two responses.

First

15

of all, that's not true with respect to adjustment of

16

status, because someone who reentered before IIRIRA, at

17

least if they reentered before 1984, couldn't have

18

imagined that their marriage to a United States citizen

19

would have given them a basis for adjustment, because

20

adjustment simply was categorically unavailable to

21

illegal entrants.

JUSTICE BREYER:

remove him.

22

provision simply ceases to have any relevance to him at

all, because he's, in some sense, self-removed.

so, he -- any ineligibility wouldn't stem from this

by a separate provision and that would attach if he

he?

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

MR. SRINIVASAN:

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In the instance --

-- of course --- of a child -May I ask this --- who had -- he had a

17

relationship to a child in the United States.

18

couldn't that have counted for suspension of

19

deportation or removal, whatever terms I use now?

20

--

21

MR. SRINIVASAN:

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

23
24
25

And

Did

It --- for a hardship claim, a

parent-child relationship?
MR. SRINIVASAN:

That's right, Justice

Ginsburg, it would count for purposes of suspension of

44
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

deportation, which was renamed cancellation of removal.

2

But that form of relief is available to somebody who's

3

inside the United States, and I was meaning to address

4

the situation where he has voluntarily removed himself

5

from the United States and is seeking admission from,

6

presumably, Mexico, in which case, suspension of

7

deportation wouldn't really come into play, because

8

deportation wouldn't be on the table.

9

But, you're right that if he had stayed in

10

the country, suspension of deportation is a form of

11

relief that he would have been eligible for -- eligible

12

for, pre-IIRIRA.

13

deportation, I think it's important to understand that

14

that form of relief required an -- a period of presence

15

in the United States of 7 years before one could gain

16

eligibility to seek that relief.

clearly met that eligibility criteria -- there is no

question about that -- under the pre-existing law.

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

1

whether suspension of deportation is relief that would

2

be realistically available to them, you'd have to think

3

that they would act on -- in reliance on their ability

4

to stay in the country for 7 years, and to remain

5

undetected, only at which point they would qualify for

6

suspension of deportation.

7

me, as a factual matter, somewhat farfetched, but it's

8

not clear that the law should attach significance to

9

that sort of reliance --

And that not only seems to

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

11

MR. SRINIVASAN:

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is it --

-- interest.
Is it farfetched, in view

13

of the history of now I- -- before INS, weren't there a

14

great many people who got here and -- just as this

15

Petitioner -- who just lived here for years and years,

16

and were never disturbed?

17

MR. SRINIVASAN:

As an -- as an empirical

18

matter, I think that's right, Justice Ginsburg, but I'm

19

not sure that that necessarily means that that's a

20

legitimate expectation or a reasonable reliance

21

interest of the type that the Court would typically

22

take into account in its retroactivity inquiry, because

23

at the end of the day what it is, is a reliance

24

interest that's predicated on essentially lack of

25

prosecutorial resources, or a favorable exercise of

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

prosecutorial discretion in some sense.

hasn't attached significance to that sort of reliance

interest before.

And the Court

not only about coming into the country, but coming into

the country and then meeting a United States citizen,

misimpression about the availability of adjustment of

But I think that was based on a

Now, I'd like to address, briefly, if I

10

could, the argument at step one of the Landgraf inquiry

11

concerning the negative inference the Petitioner seeks

12

to draw from the "before or after" clause -- so-called

13

"before or after" clause.

14

be compared side by side at pages 2 and 3 of the

15

Government's brief, and that's in the body of the

16

Government's brief.

17

And the two provisions can

The fundamental flaw with the argument at

18

step one is that the "before or after" clause in the

19

old provision, which is at the bottom of page 2,

20

referred, by terms, to the date of the INA's enactment.

21

Now, what we've reflected is the codified version,

22

which refers specifically to the date of June 27 of

23

1952.

24

the enactment of this Act, which can only be seen to

25

refer to the INA itself.

But even the INA itself referred to the date of

So, if this language had been

2

have been a reference to the date of the enactment of

3

the INA.

4

deported before or after 1952.

5

So, it would refer to somebody who was

Now, I think, as Justice Alito suggested, the

6

probable reason that Congress decided not to carry

7

forward this language is because the question of

8

whether someone was deported before or after 1952

9

doesn't have a great deal of practical significance at

10

this point in time.

11

the actual reason for Congress's failing to carry

12

forward the language, I don't think that you can draw

13

any negative inference from Congress's failure to carry

14

forward that language, at least certainly not the

15

negative inference that Petitioner wants to draw.

16

fact, the negative inference that one would draw, if

17

one were going to do so, is that the section 1231(a)(5)

18

applies only to people who were deported initially

19

after 1952.

20

wouldn't be of much assistance to Petitioner, or any

21

other person, for that matter, that illegally reentered

22

before IIRIRA, at least as a practical matter, because

23

everybody, I think, in that category, would have

24

illegally reentered -- or would have been deported

25

after 1952, rather.

But whatever one might think was

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I'm not sure that gives the

other side the -- you know, the benefit of their

argument.

that it was deleted, but that it was not replaced by --

5

whether "before or after," and then filling in the date

6

of IIRIRA, rather than the date of the INA.

7

nobody thinks that they would leave in June 27, 1952,

8

but why wouldn't they have substituted, for that, the

9

date of this new legislation, the date of IIRIRA?

I think what they're arguing is not just

certainly not enough there to make the argument that

16

he's making, I don't think, because what was -- what

17

Congress did was to replace that provision with utter

18

silence.

19

there's any way to read into it that Congress meant for

20

the applicability of section 1231(a)(5) --

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID M. GOSSETT

15

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

16

MR. GOSSETT:

17

Only a few points I want to make.

18

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

The first is that illegal reentrants'

19

reasonable expectation that they might grow into

20

relief, as Mr. -- the Chief Justice said, not only is

21

reasonable, but has a statutory basis.

22

deportation and cancellation of removal, by their very

23

terms, are only available to aliens who were illegally

24

present in the United States for the relevant time

25

period, and, therefore, these forms of relief

enactment of this Act, he would be kept out for --

9

inadmissible for 5 years.

That's 8 U.S.C.

10

1182(a)(6)(B).

11

within 5 years of his 1981 deportation, he -- under the

12

Government's interpretation of that statute, he would

13

be inadmissible for 5 years from -- even if he were to

14

re-leave in 1996, he would have been ineligible to

15

reenter for 5 years.

16

Because he had reentered the country

JUSTICE BREYER:

So, a person who just leaves
