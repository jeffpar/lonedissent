ORAL ARGUMENT OF RAYMOND G. KUNTZ

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. KUNTZ:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

11

The statute awarding attorneys' fees as part

12

of the costs to the prevailing parents provides a clear

13

rule, imposes a certain obligation.

14

expanded to include fees for expert witnesses.

It should not be

15

This is a case of statutory construction.

16

Under longstanding rules, statutes are construed by

17

first looking at the words of the statute.

18

meaning plain?

19

If so, the inquiry stops there.

This statute is unambiguous.

20

not a part of attorneys' fees.

21

costs.

22

fees.

23

the parents prevail.

24
25

Is the

Expert fees are

Expert fees are not

The statute contains no reference to expert
They are not shifted to the school district when

It's our belief that the lack of compensation
for experts is an intentional exclusion and omission

1

from the statute.

2

fees in a cost-shifting statute, and that omission is

3

telling here.

4

Congress knows how to add expert

In that context, I think it's important to

5

draw the Court's attention to the origin of the

6

statute.

7

in Smith against Robinson.

8

against Robinson was heard, the EHA was often grafted

9

onto other causes of action as a pleading device to --

10

in an attempt to ensure that attorneys' fees flowed to

11

the prevailing party at the conclusion of the case.

12

cases were brought not only under the -- the Education

13

for All Handicapped Children Act, but also under 504 of

14

the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and under 1983 as well

15

of -- on the theory that these were equal protection

16

claims brought under the Fourteenth Amendment.

17

Smith against Robinson, this Court made it clear that

18

the avenue that had to be followed by the parents was

19

exclusively that of -- of the remedy provided under the

20

Education for All Handicapped Children Act.

21

It was in response to this Court's decision
At the time that Smith

So

In

In response to that decision of the Court, as

22

my opponent points out in his brief -- I think it was

23

19 days later -- bills were introduced into Congress to

24

remedy what Congress at that point saw was a -- a lack

25

of coverage for fees for attorneys for the prevailing

4
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

parties in cases under the -- under the act.

2

no -- no great surprise that what Congress did in that

3

instance was to take the language that appears in

4

section 1988 and, in effect, lift it and put it into

5

the -- into the act, into what we now call the IDEA.

6

So it's

And it's very clear that in doing so, it

7

limited the right of recovery to attorneys' fees, and

8

that right does not include the expert fees advocated

9

by the Respondents here this morning.

10

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Do you think the right

11

includes any costs other than statutory costs, any

12

expenses?

13

MR. KUNTZ:

14

JUSTICE STEVENS:

No, it does not, Your Honor.
How do you explain the

15

reference to expenses on page 4 of the red brief which

16

quotes from the -- a section of the statute authorizing

17

a report to be made, a report authorized under?

18

shall include data about the specific amount of

19

attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses.

20

suppose they put the word expenses in?

21

MR. KUNTZ:

22

costs, and expenses.

They

Why do you

Well, it said attorneys' fees,

23

JUSTICE STEVENS:

24

MR. KUNTZ:

25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Right.

And it's a direction to -So the expenses must be

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1

something other than attorneys' fees or costs.

2

MR. KUNTZ:

Well, they could be expenses of

3

the attorney.

4

separately, that's no indication that -- that Congress

5

intended that expenses of other individuals be shifted

6

to the cost -- shifted, rather, to the school district.

7

It's a direction to the GAO to acquire data --

But if they were to be -- be set aside

8

JUSTICE STEVENS:

MR. KUNTZ:

10

Right.

-- for future reference by -- by

Congress.

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, what about -- may I

12

just take the question one step further?

13

in a subsequent clause in that same section requiring

14

the GAO report that it refers to the -- the -- I forget

15

whether -- the expenses of consultants.

16

word consultant in there?

17

understand it, a consultant would not be covered by the

18

costs -- the general costs statute.

19

MR. KUNTZ:
correct.

I think it's

Why was the

Because as -- as I

Your Honor, I believe that's

That's in -- in subdivision (B).
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is it?

Is it?

I thought

22

the -- there was a reference to hours of consultants,

23

but not expenses.

24
25

MR. KUNTZ:

There are two subdivisions:

subdivision (A) and subdivision (B).

Subdivision (A)

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

says attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses -- expenses,

2

and in subdivision (B), it refers to consultants.

3

there isn't any --

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But

I -- I would have thought

5

that your answer would be that the Congress was

6

interested in finding out the cost of this act, and

7

it's very clear that school districts hire consultants

8

to assist them in -- in these cases, and it wanted to

9

know the amount they were paying to the consultants.

10

And that's also why it used the word personnel, which

11

-- which is a word usually reserved for a government

12

agency.

13

MR. KUNTZ:

I -- I believe Your Honor is

14

correct in that it -- it's a direction by the GAO to

15

acquire data.

16

our brief, just as Your Honor has expressed it.

17

think that that direction to the GAO, however, does not

18

relate back particularly and -- and certainly doesn't

19

inform this Court or inform the statute that expert's

20

fees are to be included and shifted over to the -- to

21

the school district.

22

And I believe we argued that point in

JUSTICE BREYER:

We

But does it make it possible

23

to read -- I mean, I agree with you it doesn't say to

24

do that, but I guess you could read it to do that,

25

couldn't you?

I mean, you said the word cost wasn't

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

ambiguous.

MR. KUNTZ:

JUSTICE BREYER:

Under this statute.
Maybe you might be right,

maybe absolutely, but might you also be wrong?

5

it not ambiguous?

fees of consultants.

7

made is right, but it also mightn't.

8
9

How is

It might cover -- it might cover the

MR. KUNTZ:

It might be that the argument you

Your Honor, I think this Court

has looked at that issue in -- in two separate cases,

10

and one of those cases is Crawford Fitting and the

11

other is --

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

13

MR. KUNTZ:

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

Which involved this statute?

Well, it didn't involve this -All right.

Well, I mean, we

15

have a statute and they're using the word costs in the

16

statute, and whatever they used in some other statute

17

they might have meant something different in this

18

statute.

19

didn't by just reading the word five times,

20

particularly since, in fact, if you look at another

21

part of the statute, they do seem to use the word cost

22

to include number of hours spent by personnel,

23

including consultants, and the expenses incurred.

24

mean, can you say -- is there a dictionary that says

25

the word costs couldn't include that?

And my question is simply how do we know they

MR. KUNTZ:

Your Honor, it -- it could, but I

--

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, once you say it could,

4

then possibly it's reasonable to ask what the Congress

5

Members were actually thinking, and as soon as we look

6

at what they were actually thinking, that's perfectly

7

clear.

8

and the Senate report say absolutely clearly that they

9

intended this kind of expense to be used, which is why

10
11

Isn't it?

Because both the conference report

the GAO went out and did all the studies to include it.
MR. KUNTZ:

But we come back to the

12

historical derivation of how this statute came into --

13

into being, and it did come in in response to Smith

14

against Robinson.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I thought the GAO study

16

included not just the -- the hours worked and the --

17

the costs, however you choose to define it, on the part

18

of the parent challenging the school board action, but

19

it also included those hours and those costs expended

20

by the school.

21

MR. KUNTZ:

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, Your Honor, it does.
In which case it could not

23

possibly have been directed to what items are

24

compensable.

25

MR. KUNTZ:

We think that's a separate

9
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

section.

2
3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

On its face, it covers at

least half of the items that are not compensable.

4

MR. KUNTZ:

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

6

JUSTICE STEVENS:

That's true, Your Honor.
It's true, but -Isn't it true that the

7

provision I referred to refers to the specific amount

8

of attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses awarded to the

9

prevailing party?

So it's definitely referring to

10

expenses incurred by the -- by the plaintiff.

11

that true?

12

MR. KUNTZ:

13

JUSTICE STEVENS:

14

MR. KUNTZ:

Isn't

Your Honor, I -- that's correct.
Yes.

But I think there are expenses

15

that -- that the attorney bears in -- in the routine of

16

a -- of a -- of handling the client.

17

expenses --

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Those are

So you're saying the word

19

expenses should refer only to expenses incurred by

20

counsel, which of course would be normally

21

reimbursable.

22

MR. KUNTZ:

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Yes, Your Honor.
Well, but I'm not -- I'm

24

not sure that you don't have a further answer to

25

Justice Stevens because there's (3)(A) and (3)(B).

10
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

(3)(A) talks about costs and expenses awarded to the

prevailing party.

(3)(B) says, for the same sample the

MR. KUNTZ:

They're talking about -- the same

sample refers to a -- a designated number of States, a

6

representative number of States.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

So the sample refers

I just wonder why don't we look and see what they

11

report, they say the conferees intend the phrase,

12

attorneys' fees as part of costs, to include reasonable

13

expenses and fees of expert witnesses and the

14

reasonable cost of any test or evaluation which is

15

found to be necessary for the preparation of a parent

16

or guardian's case in the action or proceeding.

17

are we metaphysically trying to guess what Congress

18

intended when they told us what they intended?

19

MR. KUNTZ:

In the conference

So why

Your Honor, I don't think it's so

20

much a question of metaphysics or philosophy -- maybe

21

perhaps of philosophy.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

My question is why don't we

23

just look and see what they intended since they wrote

24

it down on a piece of paper and all we have to do is

25

read it?

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Did Congress say that, Mr.

Kuntz?

3

MR. KUNTZ:

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, Congress didn't say that.
I thought it did.

I thought

5

that the conferees in Congress wrote in the conference

6

report precisely what they intended.

7
8

MR. KUNTZ:
that.

10

Your Honor, if I might respond to

JUSTICE BREYER:

Oh, I'd like you to respond

to it.

11

(Laughter.)

12

MR. KUNTZ:

It's -- it's a longstanding rule

13

of statutory construction that Congress' intent is best

14

found in the language that Congress actually puts into

15

the statute.

16

were previous versions of this act which included

17

experts' fees which did not make its way to the final

18

version approved by both the -- the Senate and the

19

House.

20

And as we pointed out in the brief, there

JUSTICE STEVENS:

There's no doubt that the

21

best evidence is the text of the statute, but at least

22

the people who drafted this, even if they were not the

23

conferees themselves but were just staff members, they

24

apparently thought the language was subject to that

25

reading.

4
5

MR. KUNTZ:

Your Honor --

The rule that we look first to

the -- yes, Your Honor.

6

Which would mean it would

Yes.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

The rule that you refer to

7

that you cannot look at legislative history -- of

8

course, we always start with the plain language.

9

That's clear.

But the rule that you cannot look at

10

legislative history didn't really get any emphasis till

11

after 1987, and this statute was enacted in 1986.

12

MR. KUNTZ:

But that -- in -- in the

13

retrospective view that the Court looked at in -- in

14

the -- the Casey decision, it went back and it traced

15

the origin of a number of -- of statutes and looked

16

essentially to similar language, and it found that

17

experts' fees were not a part of attorneys' fees, and

18

it found that experts' fees were not a part of -- of

19

costs.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But it also found that

21

there were dozens of statutes, I think -- didn't

22

Justice Scalia list in his opinion for -- it went on

23

for a couple of pages, including footnotes?

proves that Congress knows how to distinguish between

experts' fees and attorneys' fees when it wants to.

Even if --

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I thought it was a joint

explanatory statement.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- even if everybody in the

House agreed with that, which we don't really know.
What about the President?

When he signed it,

did -- did he indicate any interpretation?
MR. KUNTZ:

His -- Your Honor, the -- the

22

President's hesitancy was about the retroactive effect of

23

the statute, and he noted that in his signing

24

memorandum, but he didn't note any other differences.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So we have a committee of

one house that said -- that said that, that thought it

MR. KUNTZ:

And it isn't

all that unusual that the congressional history of a

5

particular statute might point one way and the actual

plain meaning point another way.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

How do you explain the

title, Joint Explanatory Statement of the Committee of

Doesn't that speak for both the House

This Court should give the attorneys' fee

2

provision of IDEA the same construction it gave the

3

nearly identical language of section 1988 in Casey and

4

hold that an award of attorneys' fees as part of the

5

cost does not include expert fees.

6

Respondent's sole argument is that expert

7

fees are included in the statutory term costs, but as

8

this Court made clear in both Casey and Crawford

9

Fitting, the term costs in a fee-shifting statute has a

10

well-settled meaning and is a reference and is limited

11

to those -- that modest category of costs that may be

12

awarded under 28 U.S.C. 1920 and 1821.

Now --

JUSTICE SOUTER:

What -- what do you say

15

about expenses?

16

practice for a -- a trial lawyer to -- to hire his

17

experts and pay them and then bill the client for --

18

for whatever he's paid for the experts?

19

that is the -- this has been a long time since I've

20

practiced law.

21

anymore.

22

way, and -- and if that is still the practice, wouldn't

23

it make sense for Congress to have assumed that expenses

24

would include those kinds of expenses?

25

Isn't -- isn't it a fairly common

I mean, if

So maybe that isn't the way it's done

But it -- it certainly has been done that

It says attorneys' fees as

Now, in this separate section instructing the
GAO to do a report -JUSTICE SOUTER:

It's the GAO reference.

You're right.
MR. SALMONS:

-- it says to look at the --

11

the awards in cases, the awards of attorneys' fees,

12

costs, and expenses.

13

in -- in that provision can fairly be read to somehow

14

dramatically expand the meaning of the phrase,

15

attorneys' fees as part of the costs.

16

much more naturally to read that as just a reference,

17

as this Court noted in Casey, to the common practice of

18

including out-of-pocket expenses of attorneys for

19

things like copying costs and -- and necessary travel

20

expenses and things like that as -- as also being

21

compensable.

22

term expenses does anything dramatically to the meaning

23

of the statutory provision at issue here.

24
25

We don't think the term expenses

And as far as subsection (B) of that
provision related to the GAO, we think it's clear that

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

it's no longer referring to the actual awards in cases,

2

and is instructing the GAO to do a broader study about

3

the time that's spent by attorneys and consultants and

4

others on both sides in these cases because Congress

5

was very concerned about the amount of litigation and

6

the expense of that litigation and the diversion of

7

funds away from the core educational services of the

8

schools.

9

of the primary concerns Congress has had, especially in

10

As this Court noted in Schaffer, that's one

the more recent amendments to the act.

11

And we think, in fact, that the -- the fact

12

that Congress instructed the GAO to study that is, if

13

anything, more consistent with the idea that Congress

14

decided not to legislate on the question of expert

15

fees, but to leave it for another day after they've had

16

the benefit of that study at a minimum.

17

Now --

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Salmons, there's one

19

difference, a marked difference, between this statute

20

and the others, and that is, in -- in many of these

21

cases, it is the consultant that is the primary,

22

perhaps exclusive, aide to the parent.

24

in the front line.

MR. SALMONS:

That -- that is correct.

3

During the administrative proceeding and in the -- and

4

in the district court, there was no attorney here.

5

But -- but I think there's one important

6

thing to keep in mind about that is that that's --

7

Congress expected that that would be the result.

8

is not a statute where Congress didn't think about the

9

role of experts.

when the text is clear.

2

JUSTICE SOUTER:

-- an argument, a perfectly

3

fair argument, can be made, whether -- whether you find

4

it dispositive or not, that everything that goes into a

5

committee report of one house cannot simply be taken as

6

a literal reflection of the thinking -- the -- the

7

actual thinking of -- of everybody on that committee,

8

let alone a whole house.

9

But when we're talking about a conference

10

report that has been hammered out between two sets of

11

conferees, I think it is reasonable to suppose that the

12

conferees know exactly what is in that report and would

13

take exception to it if it didn't represent their

14

views.

15

saying that whatever you may think of reports in

16

general, the conference report probably has a -- a

17

superior authority?

18

Isn't -- isn't that a -- a fair reason for

is that what this Court said --

13

Well, but my point, Your Honor,

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Would you answer my

question?

14

MR. SALMONS:

Yes.

If the Court thinks the

statute is ambiguous, it's fair to look at the

16

conference report.

17

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And why is it not ambiguous

18

if the author of the conference report read it that

19

way?

20

MR. SALMONS:

For, among other reasons, Your

21

Honor -- this is what I was trying to -- trying to

22

state because this Court in Casey, dealing with this

23

exact same language, said the following.

24

the statute contains a phrase that is unambiguous,

25

attorneys' fees as part of the cost, that has a clearly

2

practices -- again, this Court in Casey tracked through

3

the -- the usage, the history of the usage of this

4

language and the way courts had responded to this over

5

time -- that when that's the case, we do not permit it

6

to be expanded or contracted by the statements of

7

individual legislators or committees during the course

8

of the enactment process.

9

Casey is equally applicable here --

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

11

MR. SALMONS:

12
13

We think that holding in

Well, one thing here --

-- and it be would wrong to

look to that.
Now, if the Court did, I think the thing that

14

the Court should take away from it, if you're going to

15

look at what Congress intended here -- and this is

16

undisputably true.

17

primary purpose of this legislation was to respond to

18

this Court's decision in Smith v. Robinson.

19

to this Court's decision in Smith, section 1988 had

20

provided the means by which courts had awarded

21

attorneys' fees in cases under IDEA's predecessor.

Everyone agrees on this.

MR. SALMONS:

first argument, absolutely, Your Honor.

making now is that if you look at the context in which

7

this language was used, Smith foreclosed the award of

section 1988 fees.

9

thereafter by -- by adding the precise language of

The point I'm

Congress responded shortly

11

Now, however anomalous it would normally be to give the

12

same language in two different fee provisions different

13

meanings -- and it would be quite anomalous -- to do so

14

here with section --

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But isn't it true that at

16

the time they did that, it was well settled in cases of

17

this kind that the Court would look at the conference

report to ascertain the meaning of the statute?

And that even when it's

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Counsel, even in -- in those

10

benighted days, I don't think -- I don't think we ever

11

would use the conference report when the statute was

12

not ambiguous.

13

that --

14

I thought it was always a rule that --

MR. SALMONS:

We certainly agree with that,

15

and I would just add that I'm not aware of any decision

16

of this Court that would suggest that the type of

17

statutory construction tools the Court would use would

18

depend on what was in place at the time that the

19

statute was enacted.

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

21

MR. SALMONS:

No.

Of course --

I mean, this Court applies the

rules that it thinks are appropriate at the time it

issues its decision.

understand that.

3

if the presence in this bill of the GAO section

suggests in the bill itself the possibility that the

5

then I would think it is ambiguous enough to refer to

7

the legislative history.

Green doesn't include red.

would allow you to otherwise deviate from the -- the

14

clear meaning of this language when it's -- when it's

15

been consistent with statutory usage over time.

16

this Court noted in Casey, more than 34 statutes use --

thing to keep in mind is that it's not just this fee

provisions of the statute itself, again, the language

Thank you so much, Your Honor.

I think -- I think that if the statutory text was
clear, which -- and I believe this text is clear in the

10

other direction -- I think we would lose that case.

11

But that is not this case, Your Honor, and let me

12

explain why.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well if that's not

14

this case, what in the world prevented the conferees

15

from putting something as important in this context as

16

expert fees, as I understand it, probably more

17

important than attorneys' fees -- what prevented them

18

from putting that in the statute if that clearly was

19

their intent?

20

MR. VLADECK:

Without being flippant, Your

21

Honor, I think that the conferees thought they had put

22

it in the statute.

23

back in 1986 when, at least with respect to the 99th

24

Congress that enacted this provision, the word cost did

25

not have the term-of-art meaning that was later

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

As you -I was going to say it

4

certainly had the meaning in Federal -- the Federal

5

court context set forth in section 1920 of the Judicial

6

Code.

7

MR. VLADECK:

I understand that, Your Honor,

8

but Congress thought it was adding -- that the use of the

9

word cost and its breadth was a way of -- of including

10

the cost.

11

The language --

12

And -- and this is important, Your Honor.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Before you get past Casey,

13

Casey didn't invent this as a definition.

14

it has always meant this in innumerable Federal

15

statutes.

16

which existed long before Casey was -- was pronounced.

17

Casey said

Casey was relying on a longstanding practice

MR. VLADECK:

Your Honor, at the time Casey

18

was -- at the time this case was -- excuse me -- at the

19

time this statute was enacted by Congress, for example,

20

costs were routinely read to include expert fees in

21

title VII cases, for example.

22

Your Honor's point.

23

So I don't disagree with

I am simply saying that the lens through

24

which this statute must be judged is the understanding

25

of the 99th Congress, and every indication in the

30
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

legislative history here is that Congress used the word

2

cost for its breadth, not as a term of art.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Vladeck, why -- if

4

that was what Congress had in mind, then how do you

5

explain the multiple statutes that are listed in Casey

6

that say, in the text of the statute, witness fees?

7

MR. VLADECK:

My only explanation, Your

8

Honor, is that the -- the Members of Congress who wrote

9

this provision were unaware of the difference this

10
11
12
13

Court would later ascribe to those statutes in Casey.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Not later ascribe.

I mean,

Casey was relying on -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Casey -- Casey is very

14

clear in saying the judicial background against which

15

Congress enacted 1988, talking about 1988, mirror the

16

statutory background, and it says the judicial

17

background was that expert fees were quite different

18

than attorneys' fees.

19

attorneys' fees.

20

MR. VLADECK:

They were not a subset of

Even -- even conceding all of

21

that, which I -- I think is -- let me take a step back.

22

Even if you reject that submission, the next provision

23

of the statute on which we rely is section 4 of the

24

Handicapped Children's Protection Act, which was

25

enacted at the same time as section 1415(i)(3)(B), and

31
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

if you look at that provision, it is clear that

2

Congress intended the word cost to have a broader

meaning.

Section 4(b)(A) directs the General

MR. VLADECK:

Thank you.

That directs the General

12

Accounting Office, first, to study the amount of

13

attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses awarded to the

14

prevailing party.

15

could be the awarding -- the prevailing party because,

16

unlike 1988, this statute is a one-way street and

provides only for awards to parents.

refers to the State educational agency and local

little more basic.

9

fees, I don't see how it helps your case that in

Assuming, which I think is a -- is

10

another part of the statute, the statute says, fees,

costs, and expenses, whereas in the operative part that

12

we're talking about here, it only refers to fees as

part of costs.

How does it help your case that --

14

MR. VLADECK:

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

16

out of their way to add and -- and expenses?

MR. VLADECK:

Your Honor, there is a body of

13

law on that issue that already exists because courts

14

have interpreted this provision since 1986.

statute are costs that are normally associated with

MR. VLADECK:

The -- the way the courts have

5

addressed that issue, Your Honor, is they -- they have

6

looked to the -- the initial phrase of the statute, in

7

an action or a proceeding, and have found those costs

8

not sufficiently closely enough related to the action

9

or proceeding to justify an award.

10

And also courts have applied the rule 54

11

reasonableness standard in ordering costs under this

12

provision, and therefore, expert costs have been

13

reduced and other costs have been reduced to meet the

general requirements of rule 54.

12

in the Joint Explanatory Statement of the Committee of

that there were dramatic and substantial changes made

because there were substantial disagreements between

reimbursement of expert costs.

means could not be clearer, and he -- he --

MR. VLADECK:

Well, I'm happy for you to rely

on the joint statement, Your Honor.

12

My only point is, is that the understanding

13

in the House report is expert fees were included in the

14

House bill, which referred to costs and expenses.

15

Senator Weicker explains precisely the question you

16

asked, which is what happened to the Senate bill.

17

Senator Weicker's explanation, which was made before

that language, that attorneys' fees may be awarded as

directly that costs may be awarded.

that the attorneys' fees are simply to be regarded as

another element of costs that -- that may be awarded

under the costs statute?

Mr. Vladeck, you have --

you referred to the section on GAO reporting --

MR. VLADECK:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes, Your Honor.
-- as an assist to help

5

you include consultant fees in -- in costs.

6

you explain the -- the provision in this very statute

7

that says attorneys' fees can be reduced?

8

explicitly provided that you could reduce attorneys'

9

fees -- this is in 1415(i)(3)(F) -- and not one word

But how do

Congress

10

about reducing the costs of testing fees or consulting

fees.

12

MR. VLADECK:

reasonableness, and --

Then why -- then it would

MR. VLADECK:

Here's the reason, Your Honor.

At least, here's the reason that -- as I understand

19

it.

20

takes place outside the confines of Federal court.

21

Most of the litigation takes place in State due process

22

hearings.

23

in making sure were the general rules, like rule 11,

24

the general rules that punish parties for engaging in

25

vexatious or frivolous litigation would have some

Much of the litigation in IDEA cases takes out --

And what I believe Congress was interested

2

analog in these proceedings.
And therefore, what the court -- what -- what

3

Congress did was to authorize a Federal court, in

4

reviewing an application for attorneys' fees incurred

5

before a State-administered tribunal, because that's

6

where the action takes place in these cases, to -- to

7

be able to reduce an attorneys' fee award if there was

8

misconduct by the parent or -- or the lawyer,

9

misconduct in the sense of trying to protract

10
11

litigation or multiply proceedings.
And interestingly, Your Honor, the -- the

12

conference report addresses this issue and does explain

13

-- and now I'm quoting from page 6 of the -- of the

14

conference report, the joint explanation -- that the

15

court shall accordingly reduce the amount of attorneys'

16

fees and related expenses otherwise allowable if they

17

determine that this misconduct had taken place.

18

think that at least in the conference report, Congress

19

is signaling that if there were other costs that were

20

incurred unreasonably as a result of lawyers

21

protracting or delaying the proceeding, they too would be

22

subject to the same reduction.

MR. VLADECK:

That's the problem, and

Your Honor, my only point is

13

that the Congress that enacted this statute, the 99th

14

Congress, thought -- and this -- this view is expressed

15

repeatedly in the legislative history, and I believe it

16

-- it is reflected in the statutory language as well --

17

that the word costs here would be given a broad meaning

18

to ensure that parents were made whole when they have

19

to fight against school boards to secure that which

20

IDEA guarantees their child, which is a free and

21

appropriate public education.

22

This Court has repeatedly in Township of

Burlington, in Tatrow, in Florence County said that

24

provisions of IDEA should not be interpreted in ways

25

that detract from this fundamental guarantee.

There

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

would be no more clear detraction from that guarantee

than requiring parents to bear the expense, which for

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But -- but --- a right to oppose the

10

school board's choice, and if what you say about making

11

it easier on parents of limited resources, they're told

12

it's going to be a gamble if you lose, you don't get

13

your fees.

14

MR. VLADECK:

That's correct, Your Honor, but

15

they lose only when the school board is providing, in

16

fact, an education that is appropriate.

17

parent prevails because the school board was not

18

providing a free and appropriate education, the act's

19

guarantee would be seriously eroded unless parents can

20

recover the costs of their expert -- of their experts.

If there are no further questions, thank you

MR. KUNTZ:

Shifting the costs to the school district of

experts' fees will also shift scarce public resources

5

away from the point where it's most effective, at the

6

stage when the parent meets with the IEP team to

7

resolve the differences.

When Congress has revisited this statute, as
it has since 1986, time and time and again, it's --

10

it's spoken to the -- to the goal of reducing

11

litigation and -- and reducing the costs associated

12

with litigation.

13

it's central to the fulfillment of this statute that --

14

that Congress be seen to have shifted the costs of

15

these so-called experts to the -- to the school

16

district when -- when they prevail, I -- I call to the

17

Court's attention that the reality is that the school

18

district has no staff of experts as Respondents

19

intimate.

20

If -- if as the Respondents claim,

It has no staff of consultants.
What it has are the people who actually

21

provide the services to the child, and when they come

22

to testify at the hearing, typically they're -- they're

23

scared or nervous because it's the first time that

24

they've been at such a hearing.

They're not

They're not testimonial experts.

Those are the kinds of experts that the Respondents

2

are talking about and asking this Court to see in the

3

statute.

4

One needs to ask the question if Congress

5

really intended expert fees to be a part of this

6

statute, what stayed Congress' hand from writing those

7

words into the statute?

8

knew how to do that when it became appropriate, in its

9

judgment, for it to do that.

It's very clear that Congress

of -- of the act and to intimate from there that the

12

plain language of the statute has meaning that needs to

13

be expanded and enlightened by the congressional report

14

doesn't make a lot of -- of sense.

important, it should have been there.

16

absence is very, very telling.
