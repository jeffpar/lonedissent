ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAULA K. SMITH

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

11

MS. SMITH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The question presented in this case is

12

whether one occupant can give law enforcement valid

13

consent to search the common areas of a premises

14

shared with another, even though another occupant is

15

present and objects to the search.

16

Georgia submits that the answer to this case is a

17

resounding yes.

18

person who satisfies Matlock's definition of common

19

authority -- that is, a definition that is not based

20

upon property-law concepts, but one who has mutual use

21

of property by virtue of having joint access or

22

control for most purposes -- can give consent for a

23

search of that premises, in his or her own right.

effect in some of our cases?

2

MS. SMITH:

There has been some of that in

3

some of the prior cases, Your Honor, that you do look

4

to social norms.

5

You've also said --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Do you think it is the

6

norm that, if there are co-inhabitants of a house or

7

apartment, that it's okay to let a stranger in,

8

against the express wishes of your spouse or co-

9

inhabitant?

MS. SMITH:

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

17

but I'm not sure that's an acceptable kind of

18

performance.

19

MS. SMITH:

Well, I think, Your Honor, we

20

have what we have called either adduced expectation of

21

privacy or a limited expectation of privacy or what we

22

called a shared expectation of privacy, by making the

23

decision, long before police appear at the door, to

24

share this premises with someone.

put a sign up, "No police allowed here"?

MS. SMITH:

I don't think that, even as --

in -- one could ensure that the spouse would honor the

6

other person's wishes.

give some substance to the recognition in Matlock of

the ability of the cotenant to consent, in his or her

I think, Your Honor, that would

16

19

that she puts socks in there for him, she puts --

by looking to what they know.

every invitation to enter.

give consent to search.

the issue was whether his statement, in effect, vetoed

-- only a search that --- do you --

-- is unreasonable --- think the officers had

sufficient grounds to get a warrant here for a search?

MS. SMITH:

They ultimately did, Your Honor,

10

but that consideration of getting a warrant was also

11

at play in Matlock and, I think, in Rodriguez.

12

the point is, if one has valid consent, you don't have

13

to get a warrant.

we're going to have a third-party-consent rule, then

this is an issue that is going to have to be resolved.

Yes, Your Honor.

- that it is the reasonable expectation of two people

court had talked about how it had reserved, in Amos --

10

the Amos case -- the question of whether a wife could

waive her husband's rights.

the Frazier case, and that was what was described as

the nonconsenting absent codefendant in which two

cousins had shared the use of a duffle bag, and the

15

defendant had left the duffle bag with the cousin.

present, but this Court found there was mutual use of

that bag that gave the cousin the authority to

consent.

12

your whole argument rests on the fact that, although

he has, and may assert, an expectation of privacy,

that is irrelevant to the right of his wife to let

people, including the police, come into an area which

16

MS. SMITH:

MS. SMITH:

looking at Justice Stevens' dissent in Rodriguez,

there is that recognition of: When you make the

22

decision to share premises with another, you have lost

the expectation of exclusive or absolute control --

1

The law of consent searches is governed by a

2

determination of what is reasonable for the police to

3

do in a particular circumstance, and it starts from

4

the premise that consent is not a disfavored species

5

in the law, that cooperation with law enforcement is a

6

good thing and should be encouraged.

7

The right of the cotenant, in this case, to

8

consent stems from her common authority, which is

9

independent of his and allows her to serve valuable

10

social interests, as well as interests that represent

11

her own personal interest.

12

not among couples who are harmonious, but among

13

couples in which there is some degree of tension, and

14

the spouse who consents in these situations has an

15

independent interest in ensuring that she can call

16

upon the protection of the law.

don't think that the law in this area is founded on a

7

notion of agency.

8

independent authority of each to grant access to the

9

police, to cooperate with law enforcement with respect

It's founded on a notion of

But she can do that by

advising the police, and then there's probable cause.
Or, if the husband's there, there are probably

17

exigent circumstances.

18

MR. DREEBEN:

Justice Kennedy, there may

19

well be other bases to allow law enforcement activity

20

to go on, but that presupposes that her authority to

21

consent is somehow qualified: If the police could

22

obtain a warrant or some other doctrine, would it

23

support the search?

24

exactly that approach to the analysis of consent

25

searches.

And this Court has twice rejected

Mr. Dreeben, does this

authority to let someone in, over the objection of the

also the case that -- I don't know, as a matter of,

5

what, property law, or whatever? -- that when two

6

people have common ownership of a piece of land or a

7

house or whatever, and one of them says, "I don't want

a certain party to come on," the tie always goes to

9

the other party, who says, "I do want somebody to come

10

on," is that -- is there any cases that establish that

11

proposition?

12

would have thought the opposite.

13

MR. DREEBEN:

It seems to me an odd proposition.

Well, that's possible,

but you have a case here where the wife says, "Come

16

in," and the husband is right there and says, "No, you

17

can't."

18

MR. DREEBEN:

And I think that the other

19

factor that the Court needs to consider in evaluating

20

this is not just social expectations with respect to

21

non-law-enforcement events and visitors, but this

22

positive, affirmative social interest in encouraging

23

cooperation with the law, which is something that she

24

has the ability to do with respect to property over

25

which she has common authority.

occupant to allow entry, that that -- that that

interest must, necessarily, be overridden.

15

MR. DREEBEN:

And I

I think that what the Court

16

needs to do is look at the consent-search doctrine in

17

relation to third-party consents, generally.

18

makes quite clear that if the objecting -- potentially

objecting party, the target of the search, does not

voice an objection, then the third party has full

authority to allow the search, even if they're --

kind of an assumption there that if the cotenant is

MR. DREEBEN:

I don't think that, on the

2

facts of either Matlock or Rodriguez, that would be a

3

particularly logical or reasonable assumption.

4

Matlock, you're dealing with a man who was arrested

5

for bank robbery in the front lawn of his house, the

6

police take him to a police car, put him in a police

car, do not ask him for consent; instead, they go back

house, for consent to search.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Rodriguez is even more

Now, as for the attempt to mirror --

Matlock is the reasonable

The attempt to transpose

infinitely varied settings that do not involve law

enforcement, I submit, will not correctly allow this

Court to calibrate what it should be doing, which is

balancing the individual interests in privacy against

the social interests that affirmatively encourage and

validate the use of consent.

does, to put this case in context, is to illustrate

18

that if the police had waited until Respondent had

left his house to go to work, or to go to court, or to

20

do anything else, or if he had stayed there and gone

21

other cases involving this kind of potential incident,

was a reason for them to be on the scene.

2

should be able to conduct the search as a reasonable

3

matter under the Fourth Amendment, just as they would

4

if Respondent had been asleep or if Respondent had

5

said, "Well, I have to go now.

6

the police said that, "You are."

7

Am I free to go?" and

And I don't think that it always would be an

8

advantage for the nonconsenting tenant, somebody like

9

Mr. Randolph, to insist on the police getting a

10

warrant or conducting a probable-cause arrest.

11

he's arrested, he's taken down to the station, he has

12

a search incident to arrest, he may not get a hearing

13

for 48 hours.

14

they are entitled to search anywhere and everywhere in

15

the premises; whereas, in this case, one of

16

Respondent's main claims is that she wasn't credible.

If

If the police do have to get a warrant,

17

Well, if she wasn't credible, and she had led the

18

police upstairs, and the police had found nothing,

19

that might have been the end of the whole incident.

20

And I think that it's because of the socially valuable

21

function of efficiently resolving accusations,

22

potentially dueling accusations of criminal conduct

23

that consent searches can facilitate, that this Court

24

has said that consent searches are a positive social

25

good and should be encouraged, rather than

expectation is -- and this is what the Court said in

Minnesota versus Carter -- that, while it's

14

technically possible that the people -- Minnesota

Let me look at

perspective of a reasonable police officer.

22

there are two points to make.

common ground between the sides in the case is, you

look at it from the perspective of the person who

believe they have authority over the premises, versus

that is, the Government has argued, and this Court has

accepted, again -- and this is a different point; and

8

that is, you have to have a clear line for police

9

officers that is administrable.

And the line that is

10

reflected in Matlock and Rodriguez is:

11

consent to come into the house from someone who has

12

the common authority to do so, that will be

13

sufficient, but that doesn't mean that if some -- and

14

so, you don't have to go around and -- finding other

people and asking other people.

Matlock, I think, reflects an administrable rule, and

that is, if you do have permission from someone who

has the authority to admit you, you don't have to go

where I'm assuming, in some social situations, you do

17

think you'd be left alone; but, in the typical

18

situation, stretching well beyond, but certainly

19

including, situations of danger where the police might

20

be involved, you wouldn't have an expectation that you

21

will be left alone.

22

if they are facts -- and you can say they were not --

23

fit within the category called "reasonable expectation

24

of privacy."

25

I want to know how those facts,

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Justice Breyer, the Court

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

has precedent on this very point, and that is -- and,

2

Justice Souter, he is asking about reasonable

3

expectations of privacy -- Minnesota versus Olson.

4

The Court considered this and said the very reason

5

that person had standing and could -- had a Fourth

6

Amendment right is because they did have a reasonable

7

expectation of privacy in the premises, that, even

8

though they had no property rights to keep any -- this

9

is the overnight guest -- had no property rights to

10

keep anybody out at all, their expectation -- their

11

reasonable expectation of privacy for Fourth Amendment

12

purposes -- is that if somebody wanted to come in, to

13

which they objected, that objection would be honored.

14

Now, I don't want to lose sight of the fact

15

that our position is the balance; and that is, we

16

don't tell the police to go away.

17

she tells you that there's contraband in the house,

18

she can bring it out."

That's the Coolidge case.

And I do think, Justice Thomas, that there

20

is a difference in kind, not degree, in giving

21

something to someone and then having -- versus having

22

a uncabined search of a house.

JUSTICE THOMAS:

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Yes, because that's not a

20

State's rule of law would authorize, and what Matlock

21

and Rodriguez authorize if they're extended to this

22

point, is not, "Take me to the drugs," which is an

23

interesting proposition, but, instead, "Go ahead and

24

search the whole house."

Breyer is, "Look, don't leave.

control over the property is equivalent, then, in that

2

tie, if you will, the Fourth Amendment controls.

3

- there are doctrines designed to protect against

4

situations in which you have concerns about ongoing

5

criminality and protecting people.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If -

But that's -When you talk about

7

that tie, your approach applies in the case -- a

8

dormitory, you have a common room, there are ten rooms

9

off of it, nine people say, "Sure, come on in and

10

search," and the one person says, "No."

11

person exercises a veto over a search of the common

12

area?

13

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

That one

Mr. Chief Justice, the

14

straightforward rule that I have argued for today is

15

that if you have an equivalent interest in the

16

premises -- it is, of course, the State's rule that,

17

if nine people object, Matlock says that any one of

18

them can let them in, and an individual can override

19

the objections of everybody else in the house.

20

I'm saying, I think, just to return to the basics, is,

21

I do think --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What -- well, what

is your answer --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Your case is that, if one out of ten who share the

2

common room says to the police, "You may not come in,"

3

that controls?

4

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

I don't think that has to

5

follow from our rule.

6

one broad rule that would allow the Fourth Amendment

7

to control, but I think if we analogize to the social

8

situation -- if you said to yourself, "What do you

9

expect will happen if nine people that you live with

10

want to let in someone and you're the only one who's

11

going to object?" -- I think it would be perfectly

12

reasonable to say to -- that individual expects the --

13

them to come in.

It's true, we have articulated

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

21

don't think that's true.

22

Rodriguez, on this question, which is assessing the

23

degree of the authority over the premises, does call

24

for a "totality of the circumstances" inquiry.

1

point, that we look at this question from the

2

perspective of the officer and the reasonableness of

3

the search.

4

in Rodriguez, the Court's analysis was that it's

5

reasonable, because the person whose privacy is

intruded on has assumed some risk.

And our point,

10

fundamentally, is that it cannot be the case that when

11

the framers enacted the Fourth Amendment so that you

12

could live with other people and have a private space

13

away from the Government, that you, merely by living

14

with your family, assume the risk that your privacy

15

will be lost.

16

That assumption of the risk --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So, can I just take

17

the next step in my hypothetical?

19

from our -- that, to affirm the judgment, you have to

outvoted.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

4

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yes.
So, it does go to

6

his presumably objectively reasonable views of what

7

nature of privacy he has.

8

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yes.

And what -So, if he thinks,

10

"Look, I've been having a bad time with my wife.

11

think she's going to consent and let the police in if

12

I'm not" -- then his objection shouldn't control?

13

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, when -- I

agree with you objectively.

16

particular family dynamics at that time.

17

broader social understandings.

18

I

This Court didn't, for

It looks to

I did want to return to your "children"

19

point.

20

-- and that is, the Courts of Appeals uniformly

21

conclude, after Matlock and Rodriguez, that children

22

are residents, which is the inquiry in Illinois versus

23

Rodriguez, and they can give consent to search a home.

24

It necessarily follows that if you extend that rule,

25

Remember -- and I think this is a vital point

Matlock and Rodriguez, to this case, that children,

because they have the authority to admit the police --

2

minor children, 12, 14, 15 -- can then authorize the

3

search, notwithstanding the objection of the parents.

Now, if everyone agrees, "That can't be right, it's

5

the parents' home," that's because we are assessing --

We're going to have to look to more.

the officers have found someone, however ignorant, has

the ability to consent in their own right, if we're

going to assess the other factors, the rule should

Schneckloth, said, "We are not going to allow consent

to circumvent the requirements of getting a warrant."

I do think,

think, that this is simply a way of getting around the
