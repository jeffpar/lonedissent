ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. RICHLAND

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. RICHLAND:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This is a bankruptcy case, but it is a

12

bankruptcy case in which the Ninth Circuit has made --

13

come to the extraordinary conclusion that the Federal

14

bankruptcy court has no jurisdiction over the chief

15

assets of the bankruptcy estate.

16

tort cause of action, was to be the main source of the

17

payment to the creditors.

18

to this conclusion because it gave a very broad

19

interpretation of the so-called probate exception to

20

Federal jurisdiction.

21

That asset, a -- a

And the Ninth Circuit came

As I will explain, the Federal bankruptcy

22

jurisdiction statutes are incompatible with the concept

23

of having adopted a probate exception to Federal

24

jurisdiction, particularly to Federal bankruptcy

25

jurisdiction.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

2

MR. RICHLAND:

Any exception whatever.

That's correct, Your Honor.

3

There is no exception to that.

4

itself is structured in such a way that its

5

jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court depends on the

6

relationship of the matter to the bankruptcy estate.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The -- the statute

So if -- if the contention

8

in the -- in the bankruptcy proceeding is that the will

9

which has been probated by the State probate court is,

10

in fact, not the true will and that under the true

11

will, the bankruptcy estate would get money, you think

12

the bankruptcy court would -- would have jurisdiction

13

to probate the will.

14

MR. RICHLAND:

Yes, Your Honor.

Now, the

15

question is, of course, that's an attack on a probated

16

will, I believe, and I think that this Court's

17

jurisprudence also supports the notion that --

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

All right.

Well, I'm

19

willing to -- to move it back.

20

that's even harder for you.

21

will is in probate but has not yet been probated.

22

you think the bankruptcy court has jurisdiction to

23

decide which will is the true will?

24
25

MR. RICHLAND:

I mean, that's --

But let's assume that the
Do

Well, the -- the bankruptcy

jurisdiction statute states that --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. RICHLAND:

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

4

MR. RICHLAND:

Yes or no.

The answer is yes, it doesAll right.

-- and it must have that power

5

to be able to do so because the bankruptcy jurisdiction

6

statute states that the court has jurisdiction, in rem

7

jurisdiction, exclusive in rem jurisdiction --

8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

9

MR. RICHLAND:

10

What if the rem --

-- over all assets of the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

-- what if the rem is in

11

another court before the bankruptcy begins?

12

the res is within -- is in another court?

13

MR. RICHLAND:

What if

Yes, yes, Justice Ginsburg.

14

28 U.S.C., section 1334(e) states the bankruptcy court

15

shall have exclusive jurisdiction, in rem jurisdiction,

16

over the bankruptcy estate, and that has been

17

interpreted by the courts as meaning that it has

18

paramount jurisdiction in the sense that the normal in

19

custodia legis doctrine does not apply where it is a

20

bankruptcy court case.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So even -- even if

22

property is in the custody of another court in the

23

probate proceeding and the bankruptcy proceeding comes

24

later, the bankruptcy proceeding would sweep whatever

25

assets are before the probate court into the

bankruptcy.

2

MR. RICHLAND:

That -- that is correct, Your

3

Honor, and there have been courts that have held that

4

with respect --

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Do you want to stand on this

6

position, Mr. Richland, or do you have a lesser

7

position --

8

MR. RICHLAND:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

you to win?

Well, it's certainly not --- that -- that might cause

Because --

11

(Laughter.)

12

MR. RICHLAND:

Well, it certainly is not

13

necessary, of course, to -- to -- for us to prevail in

14

this case.

15

principle to interpret the -- the bankruptcy

16

jurisdiction statute, look at the language of that

17

statute, and determine what Congress intended from

18

that.

19

to get into, implying exceptions into that statute.

However, I think it is an important

And -- and I think it also is a dangerous thing

20

But -- but let me state this.

Obviously, in

21

this case we have an action, the -- the in rem

22

jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court over the chosen

23

action, that is -- is miles away from the probate of --

24

of a will.

25

here was an interference with an inter vivos gift.

The particular cause of action involved
And

6
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

I think it's important to realize that that was

2

intended to be a gift that would be complete during the

3

lifetime of the decedent.

4

case really has almost nothing to do with probate or

5

probate jurisdiction.

6

That fact means that this

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But you did file a

7

challenge to the probate of the will, didn't you, in

8

Texas?

9

MR. RICHLAND:

There was a challenge filed to

10

the probate of the will originally by the -- the

11

brother of the respondent in this case, and eventually

12

yes, our client did join that some years later after it

13

was first filed.

14

alternative.

15

So that would have been an

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And wasn't the ground

16

for that that it would be inconsistent with the inter

17

vivos trust that you are asserting in the bankruptcy

18

court proceeding?

19

MR. RICHLAND:

No, that was not the case,

20

Your Honor.

21

that there had been undue influence with respect to the

22

will.

23

interference with inter vivos gift claim -- that was

24

added only many years later in the year 2000.

25

3 years, 3 and a half years after that same action was

The -- the grounds for that was the belief

But the inter vivos gift claim -- a tortious

pending in the bankruptcy court.

2

it was raised at that time was that respondent went to

3

the Federal court and said -- and interposed the

4

probate exception and argued at that time there is no

5

jurisdiction here.

6

caution, our client went to the Texas probate court and

7

said, well, I will -- I will make this -- this claim

8

here.

9

And the only reason

Therefore, out of an excess of

In fact, once there was success in the

10

bankruptcy court and the bankruptcy court said, now I

11

have made a determination on that claim, our client did

12

dismiss that claim and dismissed all affirmative claims

13

with respect to the probate estate.

14

I think the important thing to realize here,

15

with respect to both this particular claim and with

16

respect to the bankruptcy jurisdiction statute in

17

particular, is that the -- that the breadth of the --

18

what that statute does is, it -- it announces that

19

rather than having jurisdictional preclusions, there

20

will be preclusions based on abstention.

21

abstention provisions in section 1334(c), and indeed

22

section 1334(c)(2), which is the mandatory abstention

23

--

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

It has broad

You like this -- apparently

you like this argument, although you say you're miles

Washington, DC 20005

1

away from probate.

2

argument, I guess the strongest argument against

3

keeping it -- for keeping it is bankruptcy

4

jurisdictional statutes shouldn't be interpreted

5

differently than diversity jurisdiction or any other

6

statute, and Markham at least recognizes that there is

7

such a thing as the probate exception and that Congress

8

implicitly adopted it, just as they did the domestic

9

relations exception.

Well, if you want to get into that

Therefore, if we are going to

10

find for you on this ground, we'd have to go back and

11

overrule that case and a lot of other water that's

12

flowed over -- under the bridge or wherever the water

13

flows.

14

(Laughter.)

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

And we ought to take what's

16

given as given, whatever the true meaning of

17

ecclesiastical courts having jurisdiction over certain

18

probate matters or not in the 18th century.

19

MR. RICHLAND:

Well, of course, if one looks

20

at 1334(c)(2), one sees that Congress itself

21

contemplated that there would bankruptcy jurisdiction

22

under circumstances where there was no diversity

23

jurisdiction and when there was no Federal question

24

jurisdiction.

25

rolled into the whole notion of mandatory abstention is

So it -- it certainly is true that

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

the possibility that the bankruptcy court will have

2

before it matters over which there would be no

3

diversity jurisdiction.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But you could say the same

5

thing about diversity jurisdiction, that Congress

6

contemplated that there would be diversity jurisdiction

7

where there was no bankruptcy jurisdiction and no

8

Federal question jurisdiction.

9

what that proves.

10

MR. RICHLAND:

I mean, I don't see

Well, excuse me, Justice

11

Scalia, but what I think it does prove is that when

12

Congress enacted in 1978 the rather comprehensive

13

change that it made to the bankruptcy statutes, that it

14

intended to exercise as broad a jurisdiction as

15

possible so that the bankruptcy courts would be able to

16

control the bankruptcy estate and make determinations

17

as to how the creditors could best be protected.

18

Let me -- let -- yes.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I'm sorry.

I'm just saying no more so

20

than -- than when Congress enacted diversity

21

jurisdiction.

22

uniformly.

It intended it to apply, you know,

23

MR. RICHLAND:

24

according to its terms.

25

To -- to apply very broadly

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes.

10
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. RICHLAND:

And, of course, this Court in

2

-- first in Lear v. Armstrong said, yes, this applies

3

very broadly.

4

exception is purely the probate of a will -- the

5

probate of a will and that alone.

6

really hewn very closely to that very narrow limitation

7

since that point in time.

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

MR. RICHLAND:

However, there is an exception and the

And this Court has

That's true.

I do think that it's

10

important, however, to realize that if one examines

11

this Court's probate exception jurisdiction over the

12

years, it has consistently determined that the -- the

13

narrowness of that exception must be confirmed, and as

14

late as the Markham case, this Court has held that --

15

that Federal courts have jurisdiction to decide all

16

kinds of issues with respect to wills, all kinds of

17

issues with respect to trusts.

18

has said that it can determine questions such as how to

19

interpret the provision of a will.

20

that Federal courts can determine whether a will is

21

invalid.

Certainly this Court

It has even held

It can make that determination if the -JUSTICE SOUTER:

First, the probate exception to Federal

2

jurisdiction is a will-specific rule and it does not

3

apply beyond the context of wills to other types of

4

will substitutes like inter vivos trusts.

5

Second, even with respect to wills, it is a

6

very narrow exception that is no bar to deciding the

7

rights to a decedent's estate, construing a will, or

8

determining the testator's intent.

9

There are only three things under this

10

Court's precedent that a Federal court cannot do.

11

first is to probate a will, that is, to determine the

12

formal key requisites of the validity of a will;

13

second, to annul an already probated will; and three,

14

ORAL ARGUMENT OF G. ERIC BRUNSTAD, JR.

6

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

7
8

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

9

The probate exception exists precisely to

10

prevent what happened in this case, a Federal court

11

enjoining ongoing probate proceedings in the middle of

12

a probate trial, a Federal court determining that the

13

decedent's estate plan was invalid, a Federal court's

14

reallocation through a damage claim of the decedent's

15

assets, contrary to the value of the estate plan, a

16

Federal court's creation of a novel cause of action --

17

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, is it -- is it

18

correct -- I just want to be sure I follow you -- that

19

they determined that the estate plan was invalid?

20

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Correct, Justice Stevens.

At

21

petition appendix 123 to 126, the district court

22

determined that the -- that J. Howard's living trust

23

was a forgery, that there were pages that were

24

substituted --

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

But this is all -- this has

1

nothing -- I mean, I -- you have the total differently

2

-- different understanding than I do of this case, and

3

I did read Judge Carter's opinion.

4

simply held that because your clients had interfered

5

with an effort by J. Howard to give quite a few

6

millions of dollars to Vickie Marshall -- because of

7

that interference, they had committed the tort of inter

8

vivos interference with a gift, and they had to pay

9

damages.

10

I thought that case

Now, they said a lot of things by way of what

11

the evidence was.

12

out, that your clients forged three pages of the will.

13

But that was simply evidence of their bad intent, and

Indeed, they did say, as you point

14

it did not invalidate anything in the probate

15

proceeding, as I read it.

16

Now, what have I said that's not right?

17

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Justice Breyer, the answer to

18

your question, I think, depends upon the fact that

19

opposing counsel has studiously avoided actually

20

revealing what his claim is.

21

on the -- her exact claim.

22

a matter of law, she did not prevail --

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- because that, it seems to

2

me, is -- and what is it that Judge Carter did that was

3

wrong in this respect?

4

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Judge -- Judge Carter

5

understood quite clearly that in order for her claim to

6

proceed as a matter of fact and as a matter of law, he

7

had to invalidate her living trust.

8

why that was so.

9

And let me explain

That was so because her claim is that J.

10

Howard intended to give her a catchall trust.

11

argument is that Pierce blocked the catchall trust from

12

being funded by rendering the living trust irrevocable

13

in July of 1994.

14

trust was drafted in December of 1994.

15

The

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Isn't -- isn't it the case

2

that she can have her claim and she can prove her

3

claim, but she may not be able to collect the judgment

4

unless the living trust is invalid?

5

what we're litigating here, is it?

6

MR. BRUNSTAD:

But that's not

Your Honor, as a matter of

7

law, she cannot have her claim because the two cases we

8

rely on, Neill v. Yett and Thompson v. Deloitte, the

9

two Texas cases, establish as a predicate to any

10

tortious interference claim, she must demonstrate that

11

the estate plan, the living trust, was invalid as a

12

matter of Texas law.

13

Texas law for the Texas probate court to decide.

And that is exclusively under

14

Now --

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Why does she have to show

16

that is invalid as distinct from showing that another

17

trust, favorable to her, was not created and it was not

18

created because of the tortious conduct of your client?

19

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Because, Justice Souter, under

20

Texas law when the -- the probate court determines the

validity of an estate plan, it forecloses, as a matter

22

of law, all expectancies contrary to those that are

Federal court, enter a judgment for tort liability

16

against your client?

17

MR. BRUNSTAD:

No, Justice Souter, and the

18

reason why is because her cause of action is a State

19

law cause of action, and under Texas law, putting aside

20

the fact that no Texas court has ever recognized a

21

cause of action for tortious interference --

22

JUSTICE SOUTER:

That's in -- you may be

23

right on that, but that's not what -- what we're here

MR. BRUNSTAD:

31
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

under Texas law -- and the Deloitte case and the Neill

2

v. Yett case conclusively established this, and there's

3

no contrary decisions in Texas -- that once the probate

4

court determines an estate plan is valid, it

5

conclusively determines the universe of persons with

6

legitimate expectancies.

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But when you speak of estate

8

plan, you are -- you seem to be talking in global

9

terms; i.e., that there could have been no other

10

disposition of assets by the decedent or on behalf of

11

the decedent except those which the Texas court is

12

recognizing, the trust, the will.

13

Texas court does, or does the Texas court say, the will

is good, the trust is good?

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Is that what the

Souter.

JUSTICE BREYER:

And the

That -- that sounds to

7

me like a matter of preemption, but -- but -- or not

8

preemption but, you know, res judicata.

9

But just out of curiosity or -- because I

10

think it is relevant, did the Texas probate court have

11

in front of it the documents among the lawyers that the

12

district judge, Judge Carter, relied upon in showing

13

that there was an intent to create the catchall trust?

14
15

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Yes, Justice Breyer.

Everything

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, Justice Breyer.

Everything the district court had and more was examined,

Texas probate court exhaustively.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So why isn't that, as

the reason why it can't be subsumed by res judicata or

Well, there's -- there's a

further irony here in that revocable trusts are always

promoted on the grounds that it keeps us out of

17

And now you're -- you're insisting that it

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Well, Justice Kennedy, the

living trust here did two things that a will does.

19

provided for the succession of J. Howard's property

20

upon his death, and it provided for the payment of his

21

last -- last illness expenses and his -- his debts.

again, a critical element of her cause of action is

the invalidity of the trust as a matter of fact and

law.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why?

Why?

Why?

That is to

say, what the finding is, is that there was a different

particular facts have anything to do with this, as far

10

as jurisdiction is concerned.

11

Now, explain to me why I'm wrong.

12

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Certainly, Justice Breyer.

13

First of all, Texas has the right to prescribe the

14

elements of its own causes of action, and under Texas

15

law, her cause of action depends upon two critical

16

things, a legitimate expectancy J. Howard intended to

17

do this for her, and the second, tortious conduct of

18

some kind.

19

critical elements by showing two things.

20

Howard intended to give me this -- this gift in the

21

form of this -- this trust, and that it was tortiously

22

interfered with because the living trust was rendered

23

irrevocable.

opinion and there are like about 30 things in there.

6

I grant you that one of those things is the fact that

three pages of the living trust, according to the judge,

8

were created after the event of that trust and slipped

in without his knowledge.

MR. BRUNSTAD:

That's our argument.

The

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And my -- my second

22

question is I noticed you quoted from a Minnesota Law

Review about 250 cases, and the -- your opponent

pointed out that the -- the next sentence of the

apart from the Markham case, what is the case -- what

holding of a case lends the greatest support to your

probate exception argument.

Justice Stevens, I think that

some went off a lot of different grounds than purely --

This Court has determined that there is no

I'm sorry.

That is also Broderick's Will.

That is Byers v. McAuley.

Now, no jurisdiction.

It's always been a

jurisdictional doctrine.
And for the same reasons this Court refused

13

to recharacterize the -- the domestic relations

exception as a abstention doctrine, the Court should

15

also decline to do so here under the probate exception.

it permissible for a Federal court to undertake a

exclusive probate system, then Federal courts may

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Justice Breyer, all claims of

incomplete gift, which Vickie's claim is here, compete

with an estate plan.

JUSTICE BREYER:

So -- so, in other words, if

they find out about that incomplete gift at age 15,

nobody can bring a lawsuit anymore.

whether the Texas court had all of the material before

it that was before the bankruptcy court, the answer to

that can be seen at page 45 of the appendix where the

district court judge says that there were 400 boxes of

Yes, but did those documents

MR. RICHLAND:

They did.

They contained the

billing records that showed that that trust was

The trust, of course, never saw the

22

massive transfers of J. Howard's assets to Pierce

appendix page 42 where the -- the district court

indicates that both a proof of claim and an adversary

complaint were first filed by Pierce Marshall in the

10

bankruptcy court, and that is, indeed, what caused,

11

several months later, the compulsory counterclaim to be

filed in a response.

13

Mr. Brunstad indicated that what happened

14

here was that while the claim was pending in Texas, it

15

was then brought to the bankruptcy court presumably

16

because there was some dissatisfaction on Ms.

17

Marshall's part as to how the Texas probate court was

18

going.

19

specifically the fact that the first time that the

20

tortious interference with gift claim was made was in

21

the bankruptcy court as the compulsory counterclaim.
