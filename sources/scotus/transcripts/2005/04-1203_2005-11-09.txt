ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

8

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER IN 04-1203

9
10

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

11

Title II of the Americans with Disabilities

12

Act validly abrogates the States' sovereign immunities

13

as applied to the class of cases involving the

14

unconstitutional treatment of disabled inmates.

15

result follows from this Court's decisions in Nevada

16

against Hibbs, and Tennessee against Lane.

17

That

In Lane, this Court held that it was clear,

18

beyond peradventure, that Congress had an adequate

19

basis to enact prophylactic legislation to ensure that

20

individuals with disabilities had access to public

21

services.

22

surveyed a broad array of evidence, not just limited to

23

the court-access context, and, indeed, surveyed

24

evidence involving prisons, in particular.

25

result, the sole remaining question, and the only

In reaching that conclusion, this Court

As a

4
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

question in Lane on which this Court applied an as-

2

applied analysis, is the question of whether or not

3

Title II's remedies are congruent and proportional as

4

applied to the particular context; here, the context of

5

the discriminatory, inhumane, or otherwise

6

unconstitutional treatment of inmates with

7

disabilities.

8

Now, if one applies the congruence and

9

proportionality analysis of Lane, in particular, in the

10

prison context, it easily passes constitutional muster.

11

For all of the factors that this Court emphasized as

12

making Title II appropriate in the court-access context

13

-- the absence of absolute mandates, the inherent

14

flexibility of the reasonable modification standard,

15

the fact that benefits are limited to otherwise

16

eligible individuals, the defenses for fundamental

17

alterations or undue burdens -- all of those factors

18

apply with full force in this context.

19

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Can it -- with respect to

20

the reasonableness aspect, in Turner versus Safley, we

21

said prison administrators have a good deal of

22

latitude, in the prison context, in order to maintain

23

order.

24

of the Disabilities Act as being congruent with the

25

Turner-Safley reasonableness analysis?

Now, do you see the reasonableness requirements

5
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Absolutely, Justice

2

O'Connor. And one of the reasons that I think that

3

Title II is particularly congruent and proportional in

4

the prison context is, the reasonable-modification

5

standard, which, after all, uses the term

6

"reasonableness," is very well amenable to the kind of

7

Turner deference standard this Court applied.

8

course, just last term, this Court, in Johnson against

9

California and Wilkins -- and in the Wilkinson case,

And, of

10

Cutter against Wilkinson, applied deference to prison

11

officials even in the context of strict scrutiny.

12

so --

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

14

GENERAL CLEMENT:

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

16

GENERAL CLEMENT:

17

Are you --

-- I think it --- suggesting --

-- applies, a fortiori.

I'm sorry, Mr. --

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

19

GENERAL CLEMENT:

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Are you --

-- Chief Justice.
-- suggesting that

21

the ADA does not add to the burdens of the State

22

officials, it just simply tracks what's already

23

required under Turner?

24
25

And

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Mr. Chief Justice, I don't

-- I don't -- I'm not up here today saying there's no

6
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

prophylaxis at all with respect to Title II, but I

2

think it is proportional and congruent, and I think the

3

prophylactic gap between what the Constitution protects

4

and what Title II protects is relatively narrow in the

5

prison context, both because if you think about one set

6

of claims, the Turner claims, much of that deference

7

can be brought in under the reasonable-modification

8

standard; and then, if you think of the other class of

9

cases, those involving deliberate indifference, I think

10

in those class of cases, this is -- the prison context

11

is one of the rare contexts in which the State is under

12

an affirmative obligation to provide accommodations to

13

the medical needs of inmates, including disabled

14

inmates.

15

the Constitution requires affirmative accommodation

16

also helps narrow the prophylactic gap.

17

And I think the fact that here's a case where

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Under Turner, one of

18

the considerations that can be taken into account are

19

the budgetary limitations of State officials.

20

that apply under the ADA, as well?

21
22

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Does

I think it certainly could.

I think -- if you look at the cases that we collect at

23

footnote 17 of our reply brief, which are cases where

24

the lower courts have applied Turner-style deference to

25

claims under the Rehabilitation Act or under Title II,

7
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

I think some of those Courts of Appeals have clearly

2

taken into account those kind of budgetary concerns.

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Of course, all of the

4

concerns you've mentioned could be taken care of by

5

injunctive relief.

6

You don't necessarily need damages.

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, I think damages are

7

an important aspect of the remedial scheme, Justice

8

Kennedy.

9

of States have challenged the application of Title II,

I would also point out that, because a number

10

in the prison context, in particular, as not being

11

valid Commerce Clause legislation, it's not a foregone

12

conclusion that there would be injunctive relief

13

available.

14

damage --

15

But I do think if we want to focus on the

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but if we held the

16

Act was applicable for injunctive relief, it would --

17

it would be, because I'm -- the pert part of your

18

argument is that you could have a attorneys fees and

19

triple damages where trial attorneys levy against the

20

State treasury, which is -- which is what the eleventh

21

amendment is largely concerned with.

22

that would follow from what you've said so far.

23

GENERAL CLEMENT:

That -- all of

Well, I'm not sure about

24

the treble damages, but certainly compensatory damages

25

would be available.

This Court, of course, in Barnes

8
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

against Gorman, has already said that punitive damages

2

are not available under Title II.

3

look at compensatory damages --

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And I think if you

I know they're not

5

available under Title II, but, I mean, as a

6

constitutional matter, there's certainly nothing

7

barring them, based on what you've told us so far.

8
9

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, I think punitive

damages would be a harder case, in terms of

10

proportional incongruence.

11

the absence of congressional action, found damages to

12

be an appropriate remedy for unconstitutional or

13

unlawful State conduct.

14

example, or the Franklin case, in Title IX, and, I

15

think, if damages are appropriate where Congress hasn't

16

acted, I think where Congress has provided for damages,

17

damages are clearly an appropriate remedy.

18

respect to damages, in particular, I think it's

19

important to note that the prophylactic gap here is not

20

large, because, in the Title IX context, in the Gebser

21

case, this Court has already said that, in order for

22

there to be compensatory damages, there needs to be a

23

showing of deliberate indifference.

24

be some difference between what "deliberate

25

indifference" means under Gebser and what "deliberate

But this Court has, even in

1

indifference" means under Farmer against Brennan, but,

2

whatever that small gap is, that certainly seems

3

manageable.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

General Clement, in two

5

respects, it -- I think you have addressed the cost

6

concern by comparing, in your brief, the Federal

7

experience, which is subject to these controls, and you

8

said it wasn't an inordinate expense, but you also

9

pointed out that every State prison system is subject

10

to the Rehabilitation Act, because they get Federal

11

funds.

12

that State systems would have under the Rehabilitation

13

Act and under the ADA?

14

Is there a difference between the obligation

GENERAL CLEMENT:

No, Justice Ginsburg, we

15

don't think so.

16

to emphasize is that, although at the current time

17

period all 50 States take Federal funds for their

18

prisons, so that all 50 States are subject to the

19

Rehabilitation Act, that wasn't true at the time that

20

the ADA was passed.

21

is both that Title II plays an important gap-filling

22

role and also that, for whatever reason, I think, this

23

is an area -- prisons taking Federal funds -- where the

24

degree to which they take Federal funds may wax and

25

wane over time.

But one thing I think it's important

And I think what that illustrates

And so, I don't think this is a

10
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

situation where Title II is purely duplicative of the

2

Rehabilitation Act, but the difference is really in

3

terms of the scope of the coverage, not in terms of the

4

substantive obligations under the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

-- damage remedies

GENERAL CLEMENT:

I'm --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And the --

Damages are available?
Yes, they are, as to the

States.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

General -But this --

-- Clement, I'm interested

16

in another statute that has applicability in the

17

circumstances, and that's Section 1983 and the Prison

18

Litigation Reform Act.

19

Litigation Reform Act, if you're bringing a

20

constitutional claim under Section 1983, you have to

21

exhaust your prison remedies before you can do that.

22

And that is not the case here, is that right?

23

Under the -- under the Prison

GENERAL CLEMENT:

No, I don't think that is

24

right, Justice Scalia.

25

would say that the PLRA fully applies to claims under

I think that we would -- we

11
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Title II and there is an exhaustion remedy.

2

also, of course, an exhaustion remedy inherent in Title

3

II, because, in order to get a reasonable modification,

4

you have to ask for the modification in the first

5

place.

6

There is

We also think that the PLRA applies, in all

7

its provisions, to Title II claims.

8

provision to keep in mind is 1997e(e) -- 42 U.S.C. 1997

9

e(e) -- which is a limitations on the damages that are

And one important

10

available.

11

damages for emotional or mental injury, you have to

12

also show some sort of physical injury.

13

courts have interpreted that to require at least the

14

kind of more than de minimis injury you need under the

15

Eighth Amendment.

16

Title II, in the particular area of damages, which is

17

what Justice Kennedy has pointed out is the particular

18

area of concern under the Eleventh Amendment, is even a

19

further narrowing of the relief that's available and a

20

further narrowing of the prophylaxis under the Title

21

II.

22

actually helps make sure that the remedy here is

23

congruent and proportional.

24
25

And, under that provision, in order to get

And the lower

And I think the PLRA, together with

So, I do think the PLRA is actually something that

the Title II is entirely unconstitutional, it cannot

even be enforced by injunctive relief?

If we hold this

Because of the lack of the

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, it --

9

GENERAL CLEMENT:

JUSTICE STEVENS:

-- the whole basis for the

10
11

Stevens?

12

constitutionality of the statute, I think, is the

13

Enforcement Clause of the fourteenth amendment.

14

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, it was -- when it was

15

originally enacted, Justice Stevens, it was supported

16

by both the Commerce Clause and, of course the --

17
18
19

JUSTICE STEVENS:

That's true of Title II, as

well as Title I?
GENERAL CLEMENT:

That is -- that's true, the

20

statute generally -- and it's true of Title II.

21

would make -- we would certainly defend the Act as

22

valid Commerce Clause legislation.

23

is a much more difficult argument as to Title II,

24

generally, and particularly difficult argument with

25

respect to prisons.

We

I think, in that respect, it's --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Right.

2

GENERAL CLEMENT:

-- telling that, if you go

3

back to the Government's brief in Yeskey, when we were

4

dealing with constitutional challenges to the

5

application of Title II to prisons, the Government

6

focused all its energy on defending it as valid Section

7

5 legislation --

8

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Right.

9

GENERAL CLEMENT:

-- and dealt with the

10

Commerce Clause in a footnote.

11

certainly, at that point, were of the view that the

12

Section 5 authority was the much stronger basis to

13

defend the statute, especially in the prison context.

14

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So, I think we

So, what I'm suggesting is

15

that it is not merely a matter of damages that's at

16

issue here, but the entire validity of Title II.

17

GENERAL CLEMENT:

We agree with that, Justice

18

Stevens.

19

again, I don't want to mislead you, in the sense that

20

we would be here defending it as Commerce Clause

21

legislation, but I think that's a tricky argument.

22
23

And I would say, with respect to -- I mean,

If it's possible, I'd like to reserve the
rest of my time for rebuttal.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SAMUEL R. BAGENSTOS

2

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER IN 04-1236

3
4
5

MR. BAGENSTOS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
The Americans with Disabilities Act is

6

congruent and proportional as applied to the prison

7

setting for essentially three reasons.

8

the nature of the constitutional right that's at stake

9

in the prison setting.

The first is

As in the access-to-courts

10

setting, this is a setting where States have

11

affirmative constitutional duties, including, in many

12

circumstances, duties of accommodation of inmates'

13

disabilities.

14

The second reason relates to the record of

15

constitutional violations in this context, a record in

16

the context of State treatment of inmates with

17

disabilities that is extensive, that is judicially

18

documented and confirmed on a nationwide basis.

19

And the third reason relates to the tailoring

20

of the ADA remedy, which the -- which General Clement

21

has spoken about to some extent already -- both

22

limitations inherent in the ADA itself and in the PLRA,

23

which fully applies to ADA cases.

24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Do those violations that you

allude to -- is there an extensive record of violations

15
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

13

MR. BAGENSTOS:

Well, I mean, of course, in

14

this case, the lower court said that there might have

15

been a constitutional violation that allowed that claim

16

to proceed in the --

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

18

MR. BAGENSTOS:

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, no, my --- companion --- I mean a record -- a

20

record that would have justified applying, against the

21

State of Georgia, prophylactic measures.

22

MR. BAGENSTOS:

Well, we think the

23

prophylactic measures are justified by the nationwide

24

record, just as in this Court's case --

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Even against people who

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

2

played no part in that nationwide record.
MR. BAGENSTOS:

Well, that's this Court's

3

cases on prophylactic nationwide legislation,

4

absolutely.

5

Court upheld nationwide prophylactic legislation on the

6

basis of a record that included constitutional

7

violations in only eight States.

8

record that touches on at least 37 States, if you look

9

in pages 20 to 36 of our opening brief.

10

You know, in Tennessee versus Lane, this

The

MR. BAGENSTOS:

In determining whether the

evidence before Congress was sufficient, I think, you

5

know, this Court has said -- I think the standard comes

6

from City of Boerne -- it's the congruence and

7

proportionality test, but it recognizes that Congress

8

has to have a great deal of leeway in determining where

the line between enforcement and substantive change in

MR. BAGENSTOS:

City of Boerne standard of congruence and

25

proportionality, exercised with the kind of deference

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I understand your

5

submission -- and that's what I heard from the

Solicitor General, as well -- on the difference between

enforcement and the substantive right.

us that we don't need to worry about that, because

9

there's no great difference between what you think is

10

required under the ADA and what's required under the

Constitution.

12

MR. BAGENSTOS:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I

13

think there is clearly a difference.

14

prophylactic sweep to the statute.

15

not very much, in this context, for a number of

16

reasons, one being the nature of the constitutional

17

rights, that they impose requirements that are

18

affirmative duties, the other being the way the

19

reasonableness language of the ADA has been

20

consistently read by lower courts to take account of

21

context, and another being the Prison Litigation Reform

22

Act, which further ties the ADA to the --

the demands of the prison environment and the -- and a

high level of deference to prison administrators.

you think that approach is, in fact, consistent with

what Congress had in mind with the ADA?

MR. BAGENSTOS:

And it seems to me quite

Do

I think that the approach of

11

taking into account the significant State interest in

uniform treatment in the prison setting uniquely, yes,

13

is very much consistent with what Congress had in mind,

requirements, perhaps.

be, in the "congruence and proportionality"

4

examination?

5

Is that a concern, or should it

MR. BAGENSTOS:

Well, I think there are two

6

sides to that coin.

7

the ADA in the prison setting, you know, is important.

8
9

I think, definitely, the scope of

I think that the lower court's reading of
"reasonable," which I think is the -- is the reasonable

10

reading of "reasonable," if I may say so -- is, you

11

know, "reasonable" takes account of context, and

12

"reasonableness" takes account of proportion, as well,

13

the kind of accommodation that may be reasonable, where

14

what's at stake is the ability of an inmate with a

15

disability to go to the bathroom safely, like Mr.

16

Goodman alleges, may be entirely unreasonable, where

17

what's at stake is attending an arts-and-crafts class,

18

or something like that.

19

but I think the flip side of the -- of the State's

20

complete control over every aspect of the inmate's

21

environment is, this is one of the few areas of

22

Government where States have affirmative constitutional

23

duties, including --

25

So, I think that is important,

1

2

former President George H. W. Bush really emphasizes

3

this -- the ADA was passed based on a firm conclusion

4

by Congress that the Rehabilitation Act had failed,

5

that it hadn't worked.

6

constitutional violations here shows that, that we have

7

such an extensive record of judicially confirmed,

8

judicially established findings of constitutional

9

violations in the prison context, and we have

And I think the record of

10

constitutional rights that impose on States the same

11

kinds of requirements, not in all particulars, but in

12

very similar ways, as the ADA does, itself.

13

that's where -- that's where the congruence and

proportionality really comes in.

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

damages are necessary and that equitable relief

It's --

MR. BAGENSTOS:

20

puzzling to me, the notion that trial attorneys and

21

their clients can levy upon the funds in State

treasuries under the Eleventh Amendment.

23

congruent and proportional to allow that?

24
25

MR. BAGENSTOS:
about that.

Why is it

Well, a couple of points

I mean, the first is the deterrent

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

1

function of damages is really essential in this

2

context.

3

constitutional violations.

I think that's the import of the record of

4

Section 1983 failed.

I think the second point about damages is,

5

they're very limited in the prison context.

6

limited by this Court's decision in Barnes, no

7

punitives.

8
9

They're -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

why shouldn't that suffice?
MR. BAGENSTOS:

17

-- something this Court has said repeatedly, that the

18

deterrent function of damages is important -- and here,

19

we have -- we have a very good -- we have very good

20

evidence that we need deterrents in this context.

21

need deterrents because constitutional violations have

continued and continued.

12

You can't get damages there.

MR. BAGENSTOS:

Well, you know, I think that

13

the -- with respect to constitutional violations that

14

might not relate to people with disabilities, you know,

15

that's something Congress could certainly consider in

16

other legislation.

17

staring in front of it -- right? -- a record of

18

constitutional violations that showed -- right? --

19

proven constitutional violations showed that the 1983

20

remedy, which doesn't authorize damages against the

21

State, wasn't working.

22

remedy.

23

compliance on the part of States.

24

also important to note how limited the damages remedy

25

in this context is.

Here, Congress would -- had,

We need to have some additional

We need some additional deterrents and spur to
But I think it's

It's not just the absence of

punitive damages.

2

have the provision of the PLRA that says no damages for

3

mental and emotional injury in the absence of physical

4

injury, which means that, in the kinds of cases that

5

are peripheral to core constitutional rights, we're not

6

going to have damages anyway.

7

the exhaustion requirement of the PLRA, which imposes

8

on plaintiff the requirement that they go to the prison

9

and tell them, "Here's the problem," which means that

10

if we have a case that satisfies the PLRA, we're very

11

likely to have deliberate indifference, a problem that

12

prison officials have refused to resolve --

13

It's not just -- you know, we also

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It also -- we also have

Well, wait, but -- you know,

14

in 1983, when you exhaust your prison remedies, the

15

prison fixes what was wrong, and that's the end of it.

16

But, under this Act, you go through your prison

17

remedies, what do you ask the prison for?

18

prison can't give you money, so they say, "No, you

19

can't get your money."

Money?

The

I --

20

MR. BAGENSTOS:

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, I think --- mean, the prison-remedy

22

thing is -- the only thing it does is make it take a

23

longer time to get to court, but it does the prison no

24

good.

25

It's going to be liable for damages anyway.
MR. BAGENSTOS:

Well, I think that, of

28
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

course, the prison can reduce its damages liability,

2

and, of course, where we have a continuing violation

3

after exhaustion, which is what -- when people file

4

these lawsuits, when they have continuing problems,

5

like Mr. Goodman alleges were continuing problems in

6

his case -- we will have cases where we have very much

7

-- very likely to have deliberate indifference.

8

so, I think that's an important thing, too.

9

And

I think the other important point about

10

Turner v. Safley that the Solicitor General spoke about

11

-- right? -- many of the constitutional rights in the

12

prison setting that are significant here don't

13

implicate Turner v. Safley.

14

and-unusual-punishment claims don't implicate Turner v.

15

Safley, as this Court said in the Johnson case.

16

have a very substantial record of Eighth Amendment

17

violations.

18

accommodation of serious medical needs, as this Court

19

has said ever since Estelle v. Gamble, and "serious

20

medical means -- needs" is a term that's very close to

21

the way this Court has narrowly read the disability

22

definition in the ADA.

23

significant aspect of the congruence and

24

proportionality here is how close the ADA's disability

25

definition is to the class of people who implicate

Eighth Amendment cruel-

And we

Of course, the Eighth Amendment requires

And so, I think another very

Washington, DC 20005

1

constitutional rights, affirmative constitutional

2

rights of accommodation, under the Eighth Amendment

3

itself.

4

significant aspect of the tightness of the fit here.

5

And so, I think that's another very

But, here, I think the most salient fact is,

6

if you ever had a record justifying prophylaxis

7

nationwide, the record here, that touches on 37

8

different States, that includes, in many cases,

9

statewide findings of constitutional violations, is it,

10

it's a record that justifies, certainly, some

11

prophylactic legislation; at least -- at the very

12

least, the minimal prophylaxis that we have in the ADA

13

in the prison setting.

14

of prophylaxis that's very much like the kind of

15

prophylaxis this Court has previously upheld in

16

Tennessee v. Lane, where we had very similar

17

affirmative constitutional obligations, and in Nevada

18

v. Hibbs, where we had a much less significant record,

19

nationwide, of constitutional violations.

It's a kind of -- it's a kind

20

And so, for all those reasons, you know, we

21

believe that the ADA is congruent and proportional in

22

the prison setting.

And if the Court has no further questions --

Mr. Castanias.

MR. CASTANIAS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

6

Before I sit down today, I'd like to make

7

three basic points, and hopefully I'll get to make --

8

elaborate on each of them a little bit.

9

First of all, this case is not anything like

10

Tennessee versus Lane.

11

important civil right of access to courts, access to

12

voting booths, or anything like that.

13

It doesn't involve the very

JUSTICE BREYER:

It involves --

But was there -- there was a

14

reporter who was one of the disabled people, I think,

15

wasn't there, in Tennessee versus Lane?

18

MR. CASTANIAS:

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

20

I believe that's correct -And so --- Your Honor.
-- what is the right that

that reporter has that's specific to courthouses?

21

MR. CASTANIAS:

As I understand it, Your

22

Honor, from reading the opinion, that right was the

23

specific right to access the courts.

24

right of access to see court proceedings, like the

25

people --

It's the public

31
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, was there any problem

2

of that in Tennessee versus Lane?

3

courthouse officials there said, "There'll be a trial.

I thought the

4

No problem there, just whether you have to walk up the

5

steps or don't, and we'll give you a trial down below."

6

Was there -- it's the right of access to courthouse,

7

specially?

8
9

MR. CASTANIAS:

It's the right of access to

courts, specifically, that was the context that was --

10

that was created for purpose of the as-applied analysis

11

in Lane.

12

The second point I hope I'll get to address

13

today is the very fundamental differences between the

14

prison context the -- and the courthouse context at

15

issue in Lane, and the reasons why the prison context

16

that it's -- that is at issue in this case makes this

17

case so fundamentally different.

18

as Justice O'Connor pointed out, is one where issues of

19

safety and security and, as well, from the Court's

20

decisions, issues of federalism and deference to prison

21

officials hold sway.

22

and they --

The prison context,

Those were not at issue in Lane,

the other side say that's not a big deal, because the

2

ADA looks only to reasonable accommodations; you can

3

take all those factors into account; and presumably the

4

lower courts would.

5

already subject to most of these obligations anyway,

6

and it's just a little bit extra, under the ADA.

7

In other words, they say you're

MR. CASTANIAS:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, we

8

respectfully, but strenuously, disagree with that

9

submission, and I'll give you a very good example of

10

what they're not talking about here.

11

under the ADA, as a practical matter in the prison

12

context, is that it's giving prisoners trials on issues

13

like whether or not they have access to the television

14

room in the prison.

15
16

That's not a constitutional right.

Before the ADA, that was never understood to be a
constitutional right.

17
18

What's happening

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Have Courts of Appeals

approved those determinations?

19

MR. CASTANIAS:

I'm not aware, Justice

20

Ginsburg, of any Court of Appeals that has ruled on

21

that yet, but I am aware of two District Court cases --

22

I could give you the names of them -- where summary

23

judgment was denied, and a trial was given to the

24

inmate.

1

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And how many has it -- in

2

the District Courts, how many have been rejected when

3

it's something like television or recreation?

4

MR. CASTANIAS:

Justice Ginsburg, without

5

making any representations that I am going to canvas

6

the universe on this, I have not seen a case where the

7

District Court has rejected a trial in that respect.

8
9
10

And I think, Your Honor, this gives me an
opportunity to talk about one of the fundamental
problems --

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

12

MR. CASTANIAS:

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, before you do --

20

first of all, the First Amendment right that was at

21

issue there was the general right that's possessed by

22

the public to attend court proceedings, not just a

23

right that was inherent in the newspaper or the -- a

24

right that was prophylactically being exercised there.

25

Justice Kennedy, you asked the Petitioner's

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

counsel about alternative remedies here, and I think

2

there's an important point to make with regard to Title

3

III of the ADA, and that's the title of the ADA that

4

applies, not to public entities, as we have here, like

5

the State prison, but the title that applies to public

6

accommodations, like restaurants and hotels.

7

important to note, I think, that, in that title,

8

Congress did not provide for money-damages remedies.

9

Quite the contrary, it provided for an Attorney General

And it's

10

action, and it provided for injunctive relief.

11

the notion that States somehow are special and should

12

be the ones that get damages against them for violating

13

the -- violating access rights is, in words that the

14

Court has used -- in Boerne and the cases following it,

15

that is a real indignity to the States.

16

that, the standard that applies --

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And so,

And, beyond

Well, presumably,

18

that's because the prisoners don't have a lot of choice

MR. CASTANIAS:

I'm not sure, Mr. Chief

22

Justice, that it follows that damage -- that damages

follow from that observation.

24

to the choices that are available to prisons, much has

25

been made in this case about the affirmative

standards of health and safety for prisoners.

3

point out that, in the Court's decision in DeShaney --

4

specifically, footnote 7 -- the former Chief Justice

wrote for the Court that, in determining both the scope

of discretion imposed in the State.

And I'd

So, it's hard to

any way congruent with the broad affirmative remedies

that are at stake in this case.

12

Now, if I could just go through, very

13

quickly, the various constitutional rights that are

14

being addressed here by the -- that are being claimed

15

here by the Petitioner, you can see, in each case, why

16

it's not a proportional and congruent remedy to use

17

Title II of the ADA to enforce them.

18

First of all, with regard to the Equal

19

Protection Clause, it's almost obvious, from the

20

findings of Congress, that they meant to impose a

21

higher degree of scrutiny.

22

Carolene Products, as well as Matthews against Lucas,

to the disabled, this is almost proof positive that

Let me begin by attempting to answer Justice

12

Scalia's questions -- question about the Rehabilitation

13

Act.

14

between the Rehabilitation Act and Title II is that --

15

is that the Rehabilitation Act requires intentional

16

conduct, which, obviously, is a much -- a much higher

17

standard.

18

My understanding is that the key difference

Instead of dwelling on the record offered in

19

support of Title II -- and we agree with Georgia that

20

the record was not sufficient -- I'd like to focus on

21

the congruence and proportionality requirements, which

22

are quite separate from the record requirement, and

23

which we believe are independently dispositive in this

24

case, for two separate reasons.

25

But, first, I think it's important to recall

1

the two key purposes that the congruence-and-

2

proportionality analysis serves.

3

Court has reiterated, is to prevent Section 5 from

4

becoming a kind of police power through which Congress

5

can regulate the States and impose litigation and other

6

burdens on them as though they were mere corporations.

7

One of those, as the

The second purpose, of course, is ensuring

8

that the specific remedies that Congress chooses, and

9

especially the abrogation of sovereign immunity --

10

sovereign immunity that this Court has held is within

11

12

Congress's legitimate goals.

13

important, because of the -- of the -- of the tension

this point?

21

MR. SCHAERR:

22

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Yes.
Are you, in fact, arguing

23

that the statute might be -- I know you don't agree

24

with it -- might be proportionate and congruent with

25

respect to all of its prohibitions, but, to the extent

51
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

it provides for a damage remedy, then it crosses the

2

line?

3

MR. SCHAERR:

I do believe that the statute

4

could be invalidated on that ground alone, but I don't

5

think the Court needs to do that, because I think it's

6

clearly not congruent with constitutional requirements.

7

And let -- and I believe there are --

8

JUSTICE STEVENS:

9

MR. SCHAERR:

10

But --

-- four reasons for that.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But is that -- it --

11

because it has a damage remedy, or would it be equally

12

noncongruent without the damage remedy?

13

I'm trying --

14

MR. SCHAERR:

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

16

Kennedy's question to your colleague.

17

MR. SCHAERR:

That's what

I -I'm following up on Justice

Well, the way -- the way I

18

would view it is that the damage remedy is

19

disproportionate to Congress's legitimate goals in this

20

case, for a couple of reasons.

21

in Florida Prepaid and some of this -- some of this

22

Court's other decisions, the abrogation of sovereign

23

immunity is not limited to the specific areas that

24

Congress and the courts have identified as the greatest

25

concern, from a constitutional standpoint.

Number one, as in -- as

And, number

52
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

two, the abrogation of sovereign immunity is not

2

limited to the States, or categories of States, where

3

there has been a finding of unconstitutional action.

4

So, we do think that that would be a sufficient basis

5

to invalidate this statute's abrogation of sovereign

6

immunity, but we also think that the statute is not at

7

all congruent with the requirements of the

8

Constitution.

9

And, as --

JUSTICE SOUTER:

10

MR. SCHAERR:

11

four reasons for that.

12

Mr. --

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Mr. Schaerr, before you go

13

on, may I just ask you one question on the point that

14

you made -- and you made it in the brief -- about the

15

failure to establish a -- some kind of a history of

16

unconstitutional action in this particular State?

17

understand you to claim that that is a -- that a record

18

of some sort must be made by Congress?

19

of that sort be made in the courts, in the course of

20

litigation, as a predicate for a particular lawsuit

21

like this one?

22

MR. SCHAERR:

Do I

Or can a record

Well, City of Boerne and other

23

courts -- other decisions of this Court say that, to be

24

a valid exercise of Congress's Section 5 authority, it

25

has to be a response to a record of constitutional

53
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

violations.

2

JUSTICE SOUTER:

3

MR. SCHAERR:

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

5

Right, but Congress --

And it's hard for me to --- but Congress normally

operates on a -- on a national scale --

6

MR. SCHAERR:

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

True.
-- so that, I mean, we -- I

8

guess, we would normally say, "Well, you can show 40

9

States out of 50 were in trouble.

That's probably good

10

enough to get you across the line, at least."

11

you're not saying that.

12

Congress has got to make the record with respect to

13

each individual State?

14

MR. SCHAERR:

But

So, are you saying that

No, I'm not claiming that

15

Congress necessarily has to make the record, but I

16

believe the record has to have been created before

17

Congress acts; otherwise, the --

24

violations.

25

So, it could be done --

-- legislation isn't --- it could be done --

-- a response --- in the litigation of this

There could be a trial record of prior

MR. SCHAERR:

No, I -- I don't think the

54
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

record in this case would satisfy it, because this --

2

because --

3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but my question is,

4

Where does the record have to be made?

5

have to make it, on a State-by-State basis, or may that

6

record be made in the course of a trial in a particular

7

State as a predicate for subjecting that State to

8

liability in this instance?

9

MR. SCHAERR:

Does Congress

Well, this Court's decisions

10

suggest that the record has to at least have been

11

within Congress's awareness at the time the statute was

12

passed.

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So that Congress could have

14

known this, whether they specifically adverted to it,

15

or not.

That would be sufficient.

16

MR. SCHAERR:

17

Again, four reasons why Title II is not

I think that's correct.

18

congruent with the -- with the requirements of the

19

Constitution.

20

accommodation duty imposed by Title II far exceeds the

21

requirements of the Constitution.

22

need look no further than Mr. Goodman's complaints that

23

are in the Joint Appendix, the Government's Addendum C,

24

and the Justice Department's implementing regulations,

25

which are found at 28 C.F.R. Section 35.130(b).

First, as in Garrett, the substantive

And to see why, we

And if

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

you -- if you look at Mr. Goodman's complaint, yes,

2

there are some allegations there that obviously raise

3

constitutional issues, but there are a lot of

4

allegations that clearly state a claim under the

5

Justice Department's interpretation of Title II, but,

6

equally clearly, don't raise constitutional issues.

7

For example, on page 65, he has a claim seeking to make

8

the TV lounge and other entertainment facilities

9

wheelchair accessible.

Pages 53, 57, and 82, he makes

10

a claim for better access to recreation facilities,

11

rehabilitative exercises, and physical therapy.

12

page 64 of the Joint Appendix, he makes a claim to

13

force the State to install wheelchair-accessible

14

bathrooms.

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:
you.

[Laughter.]

18

MR. SCHAERR:

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

20
21

And I'm saying this to help

I'd love to get reason two.

17

At

I'm wondering --

Okay.
Even if they're bad, why

aren't the other ones good?
MR. SCHAERR:

Well, in order to abrogate the

22

State's sovereign immunity, there has to have been a

23

valid exercise of Congress's power, and there has to be

24

a statute that represents a valid exercise of that

25

power; otherwise, there's no basis for subjecting the

56
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

States to liability.

2

just to say, "Maybe there -- maybe there is an Eighth

3

Amendment claim here that's legitimate, and maybe,

4

therefore, in this case, the State's sovereign immunity

5

can be abrogated."

6

legitimate exercise of Congress's power.

7

So, I don't think it's enough

It has to be done pursuant to a

Reason number two, Justice Kennedy, is that,

8

as in Boerne and Garrett, even where constitutional

9

issues are implicated, Title II effectively imposes

10

heightened scrutiny on many decisions that are subject

11

to rational-basis review under the Constitution -- for

12

example, access to the law library, religious services,

13

associational rights, those sorts of things.

14

I think, is the key distinction between this case and

15

Lane and Hibbs.

16

Garrett, even with the undue-burden exception, the

17

statute makes unlawful a range of alternative responses

18

that would be reasonable under the Constitution, but

19

would fall short of imposing an undue burden on the

20

employer.

21

And that,

And so, as the Court put it in

Number three, as in Garrett, Title II

22

prohibits standards and criteria that have a disparate

23

impact on the disabled, even though that obviously

24

wouldn't be enough to establish a constitutional

25

violation if the disabled were a suspect class.

And,

57
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

again, the Court need only look at the Justice

2

Department's regulations to see how they impose a

3

disparate-impact requirement.

4

And, fourth, again, as in Kimel and Garrett,

5

Title II reverses the burden of proof.

6

held in Garrett, under the Constitution,

7

classifications based on disability are prima facie --

JUSTICE BREYER:
true of Lane?

As the Court

Well, why isn't all that

Everything you've said is also true of

10

the prophylactic part of Lane.

11

heard that people took seriously -- though maybe they

12

should have -- but, before the ADA, I have never heard

13

there was a constitutional right of a disabled person

14

to go to a courthouse on the second floor.

15

second-floor courthouses all over the country.

16

know that was true of the bathrooms.

17

was true of a lot of things in courthouses.

18

think your argument could be made in schools,

19

courthouses, all over the place.

that sort" --

said, "All the courthouses in this country, or in this

bathrooms -- I need a special bathroom," and they would

have won without the ADA.

19

then?

MR. SCHAERR:

Why did we need the ADA,

I'm not sure, Justice Breyer, that the claim of the

of that.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

13

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER IN 04-1203

14
15

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice.

16

Before I say anything else, I want to just

17

clarify that the scope of the Rehab Act and Title II is

18

really coextensive.

19

the fact that you need intentional conduct under the

20

Rehab Act.

21

lower courts with respect to damages claims.

22

after this Court's decision in Gebser, in the context

23

of damages claims, the lower courts have generally

24

required deliberate indifference both in the

25

Rehabilitation Act context and in the Title II Act

Mr. Schaerr made a reference to

I think that was true for a while in the
I think

60
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

context, to the extent they've reached the issue.

2

with respect to the substantive obligations, they

3

really are identical.

4

in a couple of ways.

But

And I do think that's important,

5

In particular, I think it's worth remembering

6

here that the damages remedy in Title II -- and this is

7

different than Title I, where there was a specific

8

provision for back-pay -- but in Title II, the damages

9

remedy is just an incorporation of the damages remedy

10

available under the Rehab Act, which, in turn,

11

incorporates Title VI and Title IX remedies.

12

those, of course, are entirely judge-made.

13

And

And so, one of the things this Court

14

recognized in Gebser, in deciding there had to be

15

deliberate indifference for a compensatory-damages

16

claim, is, this Court said, the judge-made nature of

17

those remedies gives the court a particularly free hand

18

in making those remedies make sense, in terms of the

19

statute, and, I would think, a fortiori, in terms of

20

the Constitution.

21

So, if

--

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

General, when you --

22

earlier, you told us that this doesn't add much to the

23

Constitution, in Turner versus Safley, and then we hear

24

about access to the TV lounge, which doesn't sound like

25

a constitutional deliberate-indifference Eighth

61
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

1

Amendment claim.

2

much of this applies, how do we address that issue?

3

I mean, if it's important to us how

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, let me address the

4

specter of all these claims for TV access, because I do

5

think that that's something that can be taken care of

6

in any number of respects.

7

application of Turner-type principles to the

8

reasonable-modification standard can certainly be done

9

in a way to weed out those claims.

One is, a sensible

I also think --

10

especially given Justice Kennedy's principal concern

11

with damages, I think here's an area where the PLRA is

12

particularly helpful, because I don't know what kind of

13

physical injury you're going to be able to show to

14

being denied access to the TV room.

15

what you need to show under the PLRA in order to

16

recover any damages for mental and emotional suffering

17

that I suppose you could try to bring a claim for

18

emotional suffering for not seeing TV -- I'm not sure

19

which way that would cut -- but, in any event --

20

[Laughter.]

21

GENERAL CLEMENT:

And since that's

-- I think, in those

22

contexts, the PLRA is the gateway you need to some

23

physical injury, so I think that's going to help weed

24

these out as a matter of damages claims.

25

think that's going to have a helpfulness, too.

And so, I

62
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Also, I think, in some -- in some sense, you

2

can't lose sight of the fact that perhaps the reason

3

that somebody's being denied access to the TV room is

4

because they're in a wheelchair on the second floor,

5

and the TV room and the law library and the religious

6

services and everything else they need in the prison is

7

on the first floor.

8

an appropriate degree of prophylaxis.

9

And, in those contexts, it may be

But I guess what I would say is, I would

10

think that this Court would want to interpret the PL- -

11

- I'm sorry, would want to interpret Title II in a way

12

that avoids constitutional problems, rather than in a

13

way that engenders it.

14

access to the TV room is critical to the

15

constitutionality of the statute, I think the

16

reasonable-modification standard provides plenty of

17

tools to apply Turner-type principles and ameliorate

18

the constitutional problems.

19

And so, to the extent the

I mean, if you compared this case with Cutter

20

against Wilkinson from last term, there you had a

21

statutory strict-scrutiny standard that was

22

specifically directed at the prisons in one other

23

context.

24

be applied with Turner deference-type principles."

25

And, nonetheless, this Court said, "That can

Here, you have a statute that applies

63
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

broadly, and I would think it would be a very easy act

2

of interpretation and constitutional avoidance to say

3

that, "In the prison context, we're going to interpret

4

in a way that avoids constitutional difficulties."

5

If I could try to address just one or two

6

specific questions -- Justice Souter, you asked about

7

the practical experience of the Federal Government.

10

less than 2 percent of our compliance cost.
