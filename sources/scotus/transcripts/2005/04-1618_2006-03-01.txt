ORAL ARGUMENT OF MIGUEL A. ESTRADA

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. ESTRADA:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
In this admiralty case, the Eleventh Circuit

12

held that Chatham County, a political subdivision of

13

the State of Georgia, is entitled to sovereign immunity

14

in Federal court.

15

reasons. First, for well over a century, this Court

16

consistently has held that counties and other political

17

subdivisions are not entitled to sovereign immunity.

18

And second, in the specific context of in personam

19

admiralty cases, the same rule has been recognized for

20

over 100 years.

21

That is wrong for at least two

To go to my first point, in Lincoln County v.

22

Luning, decided in 1890, this Court squarely held that

23

counties and other political subdivisions are not

24

entitled to sovereign immunity.

25

least three, significant aspects of Lincoln County that

bear emphasis.
The first one is that even by 1890, the Court

3

was able to say that in its own cases it could see

4

decades of case law where counties had been a defendant

5

without any objection being raised.

6

The second was that an important aspect of

7

the Court's reasoning was the recognition that when a

8

county is sued, the State is not a real party in

9

interest, not the real party in interest, which is

10

another way of saying that the county is not an arm of

11

the State, the issue before here today.

12
13
14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Can a county be an arm of

the State for some things?
MR. ESTRADA:

I am not aware of any county

15

that has been organized so as to meet the requirements

16

that this Court set forth in Hess and other cases for

17

an arm of the State.

18

question of labeling.

19

a -- that a particular State would associate so closely

20

with a county, so closely control its -- its acts, and

21

be on the hook for its liabilities, that under this

22

Court's cases it could be an arm of the State, but that

23

is not the case here.

24
25

This is, of course, not a
It is possible that the -- that

other words, the county could be an arm of the State

2

for some purposes but not others.

3

MR. ESTRADA:

That is -- that is a

4

possibility, Mr. Chief Justice.

5

county would meet that inquiry with respect to what we

6

have here.

7

I'm not aware that this

What we have in this case is essentially two

8

propositions.

9

county in the country, exercises a slice of State

One is that the county, like every other

10

power, and that was something that was found

11

unremarkable by this Court in Lake Country Estates.

12

And the second one is that this county, like many other

13

organs of government, may get funding, even substantial

14

funding, from the State, and again, that was found

15

unremarkable in Mt. Healthy by this Court.

16

What is controlling here is that the county,

17

like most counties or maybe all counties, enjoys a

18

significant amount of autonomy, has the power under the

19

State law to raise its own revenues through taxes and

20

bonds, and that the State is ultimately not liable for

21

its debts.

22

county is unable to meet any definition of arm of the

23

State that has ever been articulated by this Court's

24

cases.

25

And under -- under those factors, the

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is -- is the failure to

2

State just a historical relic?

3

semantics.

4

government policy that dictates the distinction?

5

It depends on

Or is there some normative or good

MR. ESTRADA:

Well, I think as a -- as a

6

fundamental feature of the Federal system and -- and

7

the plan of the Convention, that the States came

8

together as sovereigns to form a new country, and under

9

this Court's cases, the immunity that they retain is

10

called residual because it is recognized that insofar

11

as they did not relinquish it to the National

12

Government, they kept it.

13

record of the founding that contemplates that counties

14

came to the Convention as sovereigns.

15
16
17

There is no historical

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

just a close textual reading of the Eleventh Amendment.
Right?

18

MR. ESTRADA:

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

20
21

It's just a -- it's

Well -It says a State.

It

doesn't say county.
MR. ESTRADA:

That might be the end of the

22

case, in fairness, Mr. Chief Justice, if the Eleventh

23

Amendment were the source of the sovereign immunity

24

that this Court has recognized, but we know from cases

25

like Alden v. Maine that the Eleventh Amendment is

6
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

merely an example of the structural immunity that is

2

implicit in the structure of the Constitution.

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So it's -- it's a matter of

4

respecting the dignity of the States because they

5

participated in the Convention, the plan of Convention?

6

MR. ESTRADA:

And because they came to the

7

Convention as sovereigns.

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

Let me say that -Well -- I -- I guess, in --

in going beyond the Eleventh Amendment, we were

10

appealing to an understanding of sovereignty that

11

existed at the time of the framing.

12

MR. ESTRADA:

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Exactly right.
And at the time of the

14

framing, counties in England did not enjoy the -- the

15

sovereign immunity of the king, did they?

16

MR. ESTRADA:

I do not believe that counties

17

anywhere at the time of the founding enjoyed the

18

sovereign immunity that was -- that has been recognized

19

by this Court's cases.

20

And you're right, Justice Scalia, that this

21

has been reflected in -- in the Federalist Papers, 81,

22

by Hamilton.

23

Founders, that this was a feature that need not be

24

stated in the Constitution in order to recognized.

25

It was clear, at least to some of the

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So it's a historical relic

7
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

based on the dignity of the State, or the king in one

2

case, and of corresponding lack of dignity of the

3

entities on the other?

4

MR. ESTRADA:

Well, it is -- it is what the

5

history was and what the plan of the Convention was,

6

and it's also a recognition, even functionally, that

7

we're talking about sovereign immunity.

8

most common sense understandings of what a sovereign is

9

would imply at least the ability to prescribe law for

And I think

10

the government of others without having to draw your

11

authority for that from a higher source and without

12

being accountable to a higher source.

13

the respective sphere would meet that requirement, but

14

that would not be true of counties.

15

A State within

I will point out, as my third point with

16

respect to the Lincoln County case, is that the -- the

17

case came down March 3rd, 1890, which was the same day

18

that the Court handed down Hans v. Louisiana.

19

is significant because, as the Court is aware, the

20

holding of Hans has been the subject of significant

21

disagreement over the years since by members of past

22

and current courts, and many members of the courts have

23

viewed Hans as an unwarranted extension of sovereign

24

immunity.

25

And that

If the Court was not prepared to extend

8
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

immunity to counties on the day that it ruled on Hans,

2

it seems hard to see why it would do it now.

3

fact, the history of this Court's cases since then

4

reflects an almost inflexible understanding, again and

5

again, that counties and political subdivisions are not

6

entitled to the State's immunity.

7

With respect to my second point --

8

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

9

Would you -- would you say

thoughtful rather than inflexible?

10

(Laughter.)

11

MR. ESTRADA:

12

And in

I will settle for thoughtful,

but I'm hoping for inflexible.

13

(Laughter.)

14

MR. ESTRADA:

With respect to my second

15

point, Mr. Chief Justice, Workman v. City of New York

16

squarely dealt with the question whether a political

17

subdivision, a -- a municipality made up of four

18

counties in that case, was entitled to immunity in an

19

admiralty suit in personam, and the Court concluded

20

that the answer was no.

21

Now, the only argument I have heard for why

22

Workman is not controlling in this case has been that

23

somehow in Ex parte New York No. 1, this Court cast

24

doubt on that holding.

25

that is being relied on, all that the Court said in Ex

But if you look at the portion

9
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

parte New York was it cited one of the distinctions

2

between the New York case and Workman, when it could

3

have cited two.

4

case actually says.

5

That's not enough to override what the

And one of the reasons that I started with

6

the Luning County is that even if there were any doubt

7

on the question or even if Ex parte New York had cast

8

enough doubt under Workman, despite the uniform

9

understanding since Workman that that's what the rule

10

is, the fact that this Court in every other context of

11

sovereign immunity has consistently held that counties

12

are not entitled to sovereign immunity ought to be

13

dispositive of the question there as well.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Do you -- do you agree that

15

-- that it's possible that an entity can have sovereign

16

immunity in admiralty where -- where the same entity

17

would -- would not have it elsewhere?

18

MR. ESTRADA:

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

20
21

No -I find that discussion quite

perplexing.
MR. ESTRADA:

I do not believe that is

22

possible, and with respect to the argument to that

23

effect that is being advanced by Respondent, a close

24

reading of the cases being cited will disclose that

25

they're not, in fact, unique to admiralty.

They are

10
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

common law cases about what the -- what the power --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

immunity in most of the cases, not necessarily --

4

MR. ESTRADA:

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

6

They're talking about

Sovereign immunity.
-- not necessarily sovereign

immunity.

7

MR. ESTRADA:

8

And -- and another important distinction,

9

That's right.

Justice Scalia, is that even if one could unearth a --

10

a body of case law that recognized municipal immunity

11

at the time of the founding, it would not become

12

sovereign immunity, and that's the only issue that is

13

-- that is in contention here.

14

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But -- but there is a

15

textual basis for drawing a distinction between

16

admiralty and law and equity.

17

doesn't extend to -- to admiralty.

18
19

MR. ESTRADA:

The Eleventh Amendment

That is right, Justice Stevens.

And if this Court had held that the Eleventh Amendment

20

were the source or even the sole source of sovereign

21

immunity, that would be a compelling argument.

22

main holding of the Ex parte New York No. 1 case is,

23

indeed, that that limitation does not apply because, as

24

understood by Hans, which had been ruled on some 31

25

years earlier, the sovereign immunity really comes from

11
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

the structure of the Constitution.
And the state of this -- this Court's

3

doctrine is that the Eleventh Amendment's sole purpose

4

was to overrule the holding in Chisholm, and that but

5

for the fact that Chisholm came down, the Eleventh

6

Amendment never -- if the Eleventh -- if the Eleventh

7

Amendment had never been enacted, every sovereign

8

immunity case would come out the same way.

doctrine works.

MR. ESTRADA:

Of course, it's the
It did not

That is -- that is true, though

16

with respect to Chisholm and the issue in this case,

17

Justice -- Justice Stevens, it is very instructive that

18

both sides of the argument in the Chisholm case

19

understood that the issue was whether States may get

20

sovereign immunity.

21

subdivisions didn't.

22

Both sides conceded that political

Chief Justice Jay for the majority argued

23

that it made no sense to extend sovereign immunity when

24

a -- where -- where a city like the size of

25

Philadelphia was the same size and had as many

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

inhabitants as the State of Delaware, and that's what he

2

argued.

3

And Justice Iredell, whose views have come to

4

command a majority of the Court, saw it to his argument

5

to distinguish political subdivisions from States, so

6

that even though this Court's first holding was not

7

until 1890, it was embedded in the understanding at the

8

founding, as -- as shown even by Chisholm, that

9

political subdivisions were not entitled to sovereign

10
11
12

immunity.
I would like to reserve the remainder of my
time, if I may, Mr. Chief Justice.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAN HIMMELFARB

16

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

17

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

18
19

MR. HIMMELFARB:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

20

States enjoy a constitutionally protected

21

immunity from suit, but cities and counties do not.

22

That principle has been established by an unbroken line

23

of precedent dating back to the 19th century and was

24

applied to an admiralty suit more than 100 years ago in

25

Workman v. City of New York.

13
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Both Workman and the principle it applied

2

answered the question presented in this case.

3

held that, as a matter of the Federal law of admiralty,

4

a political subdivision is not entitled to immunity

5

from suit.

6

the Court explained that if the government entity

7

defendant in an admiralty suit were a sovereign, it

8

would be entitled to immunity, not as a matter of

9

admiralty law, but as a matter of the law of sovereign

Workman

In the course of deciding that question,

10

immunity, in which case the Court would be without

11

jurisdiction.

12

The Court went on to say, however -- and this

13

is at page 570 of the opinion -- the municipal

14

corporation of the City of New York unlike a sovereign

15

was subject to the jurisdiction of the Court.

16

Workman's holdings resolved the issue in the case.

17

But the result would be the same even if

18

Workman had never been decided.

19

County case in 1890 through the Richland County case in

20

2003, this Court has repeatedly held that States, but

21

not cities or counties, are sovereign and that States,

22

but not cities or counties, are therefore entitled to

23

sovereign immunity.

24

sovereign in an admiralty case than it is in any other

25

type of case.

From the Lincoln

A city or county is no more a

14
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

The theory on which the court of appeals

2

apparently relied was that not only States but what it

3

called political subdivisions of States are entitled to

4

sovereign immunity, at least when the -- the political

5

subdivision is exercising a power delegated by the

6

State.

7

But that's no different from saying that

8

cities and counties are, after all, entitled to

9

sovereign immunity because every city or county is a

10

political subdivision of a State and every city or

11

county exercises power delegated by the State, what

12

this Court has called a slice of State power.

13

apparent rationale of the court of appeals is just

14

flatly inconsistent with more than a century of this

15

Court's precedent.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So the

You don't doubt that

17

a county could have sovereign immunity if it qualified

18

as an arm of the State in a particular instance.

19

MR. HIMMELFARB:

That's absolutely correct,

20

Mr. Chief Justice.

21

the Court, all agree that Chatham County is not an arm

22

of the State for purposes of this Court's

23

constitutional sovereign immunity doctrine.

24

only issue in this case is whether there is some other

25

ground on which the county would be entitled to

Respondent's theory is that there are two

distinct notions of sovereign immunity, what it calls

is that there is only one doctrine of -- of

18

Supposing a State passed a statute that said that the

19

following counties shall hereby be designated arms of

20

the State and be entitled to immunity, period.

21

that provide an adequate defense, do you think?

22

MR. HIMMELFARB:

Would

That in and of itself,

23

Justice Stevens, would not.

24

clear that in deciding whether an entity is an arm of

25

the State, there are three principal considerations to

This Court's cases make

take into account.

2

which is the classification of the entity under State

3

law.

4

are whether the State would ultimately be liable for a

5

judgment against the political entity and also the

6

extent of control exercised by the State over the

7

entity.

8
9

You've identified one of them,

The other two, which are probably more important,

It's important to point out, with respect to
the latter of those two considerations, that control in

10

this context doesn't mean simply that the county has

11

been delegated authority by the States since, after

12

all, all counties are -- are delegated authority by the

13

State.

14

control, for example, that it is the Governor who

15

appoints the members of the commission that governs the

16

particular entity, the Governor who has the power to

17

remove them.

18

the sort of considerations that courts have taken into

19

account in deciding whether the control element of the

20

arm of the State inquiry is satisfied.

21

It means that there's more of a day-to-day

The Governor may have veto power.

That's

There is no basis for any notion of

22

constitutional sovereign immunity beyond the one

identified by this Court.

basis for any arm of the State test other than that

25

applied by the Court in its cases involving the one

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

doctrine of constitutional sovereign immunity.

2

The only other possibility that would entitle

3

Respondent to prevail in this case would be some notion

4

of non-constitutional immunity unique to admiralty.

5

But, of course, whatever else Workman held -- and

6

Respondent takes the position that Workman did not

7

decide the constitutional issue.

We think it did, for

8

the reasons I've already stated.

But whatever else it

9

held, it clearly held that, as a matter of the Federal

10

law of admiralty, political subdivisions are not

11

entitled to immunity from suit.

12

adopt a non-constitutional rule of immunity limited to

13

the admiralty context without overruling Workman.

14

Respondent does not ask the Court to do that.

15

indeed, so far as I can tell from reading Respondent's

16

brief, it does not even advocate a non-constitutional

17

rule of immunity for admiralty cases.

18

So the Court could not

And

So there's no non-constitutional basis for

19

immunity.

20

is when the political entity is an arm of the State.

21

As this case comes to the Court, all agree that Chatham

22

County is not.

23

Chatham County was not entitled to immunity and that

24

the judgment of the court of appeals should be

25

reversed.

It was -- charities had immunity until very

Some States still had it when I was in law

18

You couldn't sue a charity for tort.
MR. HART:

look at these core functions and if you -- if you

20

define that as something that's being delegated by the

21

State where the State says we want you to have

22

sovereign immunity, then that's something that should

be respected as part of the dignity of the State.

24

In this particular case, Georgia is extremely
strong on that point.

MR. HART:

The answer to that question is

4

that if you look at the -- the function of -- of State

government and you look at what they define as being

important -- and in this case, Georgia has defined that

7

as one of the functions under its constitution and

there that ought to be respected insofar as outside

Are you

don't concede that we might not fit in the -- that we

now moving to discussing general principles of

One of the things that has been argued by the

sovereign interest of the State by this Court.

6

If you go back and look at the St. Anthony

7

Falls case, at that time they were dealing with

8

riparian rights, and -- and there was a deference to

9

the State in regard to that.

You also had the Coeur

D'Alene Indian Tribe dealing with submerged lands, and

11

you recognized the sovereign interests of the State in

12

those situations, and in the Seminole Tribe case, said

13

there's no exceptions in regard to carving out an

14

exception to an admiralty immunity.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

All that establishes

is simply that if the State were operating this bridge

The control issue we feel is something that

13

the dignity issue ought to take precedence over.

14

control issue is something that the State decides

15

during the delegation, and if you wish to place an

16

emphasis on the control, then you're asking -- asking

17

basically, do you require the State to make a certain

18

kind of delegation?

Earlier we had a question that -- that

20

followed up on the issue of if there -- if we just did

21

a single function alone, built a bridge without

22

anything else, would that alone create a responsibility

23

on the part of the county?

to that, the core function here is the county accepting

25

the responsibility of the State.

The Hines case was an

MR. HART:

Well, it's a function that

be a function on behalf of the State with the counties.

And -- and it has traditionally historically been a

function of the States to build roads and run bridges.

MR. ESTRADA:

Thank you, Mr. Hart.

Mr. Chief Justice, just a few

points.
On the issue that was raised by Justice

17

Alito, the -- this doctrine comes from the Wickman case

18

from the old Fifth Circuit.

19

on a -- on a case called Kegan from the Supreme Court

20

of Florida, which was, indeed, a bridge case, but it

21

was not an admiralty case.

22

someone who was crossing a bridge with a heavy truck

23

fell through the bridge because the -- the bridge was

structurally unsafe.

25

took it as a bridge case and took over that doctrine.

That case relied primarily

If that fact -- scenario were to come up

2

in Chatham County and the plaintiffs and the defendants

3

were diverse, there is no question that -- that the

4

county would be entitled to plead its State law

5

immunity under Erie.

6

I will point out incidentally that even

7

though in this case there is a diversity of citizenship

8

and admiralty jurisdiction, this Court held in 1953 in

9

a case called Pope & Talbot v. Hawn that in that

10

circumstance, any defense that is available solely on

11

the diversity side under Erie gets trumped by the

12

uniform application of the maritime law.

13

not be an issue here.

14

So that would

With respect to the question that was raised

15

by Justice Ginsburg, Hines was an admiralty case in

You may recall that such a distinction

3

between core and non-core governmental functions was at

4

the core of the -- of this -- this Court's cases under

5

National League of Cities v. Usery, and in the Garcia

6

case, the Court overruled National League of Cities

7

primarily on the point that the distinction between

8

core and non-core governmental functions had proven to

9

be unworkable.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You're -- are you

11

suggesting that the -- the State would enjoy sovereign

12

immunity in proprietary activities?

13

MR. ESTRADA:

I am suggesting that if you

14

named the State on the wrong side of the caption on the

15

V in Federal court, it does enjoy sovereign immunity,

16

irrespective of what your cause of action is.

17

Chief Justice.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yes, Mr.

But I would have

19

thought, particularly when we're talking about the arm

20

of the State doctrine, that the -- the nature of the

21

activity is one of the key questions we look at.

MR. ESTRADA:

activity would be something else.
