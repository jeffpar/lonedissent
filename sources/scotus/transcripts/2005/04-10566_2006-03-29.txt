ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER GARTLAN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER IN 04-10566
MR. GARTLAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case presents three questions.

The

12

first is, does article 36 of the Vienna Convention on

13

Consular Relations confer rights to individuals such as

14

Mr. Sanchez-Llamas?

15

Llamas enforce the right in a State criminal

16

prosecution.

17

enforced by suppression.

The second is can Mr. Sanchez-

And the third is can the right be

The first issue is -- is a matter of treaty

19

interpretation, and the language of the article 36 is

21

says that the consulate and the individual can have

22

free communication between them.

23

gives to the detainee, the foreign national detainee,

24

the right to have his consulate notified of his arrest

25

and the right to forward communication to the

11

text is plain, but if the Court resorts any

12

secondary sources, that too will confirm the plain

13

language of -- of the article.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But I thought that the

15

argument on the other side is that those references in

16

the secondary sources and in the document itself are

17

meant to make clear that if the individual detainee

18

does not want contact with his consular officials, for

19

example, in a case where he might be seeking asylum or

20

something like that, that it was, as you said earlier,

21

his decision and not necessarily that there was to be a

22

departure from the norm in international -- the

23

international context where treaties are between the

24

sovereigns and don't confer enforceable rights on

25

individuals.

MR. GARTLAN:

Well, Your Honor, actually the

2

article 36 is -- is unique and different in that the

3

revolutionary part of this is that the detainee did,

4

for the first time, have the authority to have the

5

consulate notified.

6

statutes, bilateral treaties, multilateral treaties

7

require mandatory notification, but this is an instance

8

where the detainee gets to control.

9

decides whether or not the consulate is going to be

Typically most of the notification

contacted.

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Right.

So the --

12

that's what the different countries, the signatories,

13

are supposed to provide, and if they don't, that's a

14

matter to be taken up bilaterally between the countries

15

involved and not necessarily an individual enforceable

16

right.

17

MR. GARTLAN:

18

the international level as well.

19

could complain to another state, but the question here

20

is whether or not this article, as domestic law in the

21

United States, confers a personal right to a foreign

22

national detainee because a treaty in the United

23

States, a self-executing treaty -- and everybody agrees

24

this is that -- works in two spheres, on two levels.

25

One level is the international level, but by -- through

Well, it -- it could work on

treaty confers personal rights to individuals because

that it -- it decides the particular case and does not

set forth propositions of law that are binding in

future cases.

Many of the treaty partners

view it as conferring a right, at least 11 tell an

9

arrestee of his rights under -- under the treaty and --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But do any of our

11

treaty partners apply the exclusionary rule to

12

violations of this?

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What -- what remedies have

10

other countries provided for -- for these rights?

I

11

mean, it's -- it's easy to say the right exists.

What

12

-- what have other countries done by way of vindicating

13

these rights?

14

MR. GARTLAN:

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Typically I think the -I mean, advising them of

16

them is -- is really not vindicating them, it doesn't

17

seem to me.

20

MR. GARTLAN:

Typically it is a matter of

state to state complaints or apologies and -JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, that's -- but, you

21

know, that's what the other side said the whole thing

22

should consist of, that it's a matter to be enforced by

23

-- by state-to-state protests, not -- not by the

24

judicial system or the legal system taking it upon

25

itself to provide a remedy.

What -- what remedies have been provided in

exclusion in Australia?

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. GARTLAN:

10

Yes, Your Honor.
When -- when was that?

Offhand -- I believe it's

within the last couple years.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Was there a showing of

prejudice in that case or just automatic exclusion?
MR. GARTLAN:

No, it's not automatic.

11

Typically in the commonwealth countries, a judge has a

12

lot of equitable authority to kind of balance some

13

interests and decide whether or not to exclude the --

14

the evidence.

15

worldwide, that it's pervasive practice, but in -- in

16

some sense, what other countries are doing in their

17

individual systems, it's nice to know but it's not all

18

that controlling because the question, again, is how

19

does this statute work as domestic law?

20

And I'm not saying that it's happened

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, is that -- that -- my

21

question was going to be are -- are you suggesting or

22

arguing that the remedy ought to be exclusion as a

23

matter of domestic law or as a necessary implication of

24

-- of the treaty?

25

MR. GARTLAN:

It's a necessary implication or

10
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

it's an implication of the treaty, of section 2 of

2

article 36.

3

But --

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, what would you do in a

4

country that does not apply an exclusion remedy in --

5

in domestic cases given the provision, which I can't

6

quote correctly, but you'll know what it is, the -- the

7

provision that the treaty will -- will be administered

8

in accordance with or consistently with, I guess it is,

9

domestic law so long as full effect is given to its

10

substantive provisions?

11

-- that that provision for administration in accordance

12

with domestic law would have a great bearing, if -- if

13

not being dispositive, on the remedy, so that if I were

14

answering the question I -- I had asked you, I -- I

15

would have said, well, it's probably a domestic law

16

basis for -- for exclusion, but not a treaty basis.

17

I would have thought that that

So why in those countries -- getting back to

18

-- to my -- why -- why in those countries that do not

19

customarily apply an exclusion remedy wouldn't it be

20

consistent with the treaty for them to decline to apply

21

it given the provision for administration consistently

22

with -- with domestic law?

23

MR. GARTLAN:

It could be appropriate.

The

24

treaty was prepared -- drafted full knowing that there

25

are various and myriad kinds of legal systems

11
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

throughout the world, and it wasn't intended to say,

2

here's the -- here's the remedy because typically under

3

international law, the remedy is -- is a domestic

4

remedy.

5

not say, thou shalt suppress.

And this -- this doesn't -- the treaty does

6
7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
--

8

JUSTICE SOUTER:

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

10

Well, if it doesn't

So if the treaty -Why don't you go

ahead?

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

The -- the treaty provision

12

then governs only in the sense that for remedy it

13

refers you to domestic law.

Is that it?

14

MR. GARTLAN:

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yes, Your Honor.
Okay.
So -- so if the

17

treaty doesn't say suppress, what authority does a

18

Federal court have to direct a State court to exclude

19

evidence?

20
21
22

MR. GARTLAN:

Through the Supremacy Clause,

Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Supremacy Clause

23

gives effect to the treaty.

24

treaty doesn't require suppression.

25

MR. GARTLAN:

You just told me the

Well, the treaty doesn't in --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

in its text doesn't say, thou shalt suppress, but is --

2

it is a source of authority because the treaty says

3

thou shalt give full effect to the law.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, it's a source of

5

authority but not a source of authority for

6

suppression.

7

a treaty which requires us to suppress evidence of this

8

sort, but allows the other treaty partners to do

9

whatever they like, not -- not suppress, let it in,

And I find it implausible that we signed

10

rely upon consular protests.

11

provision, you know, in accordance with domestic law,

12

means, that -- you know, each man to himself?

13

MR. GARTLAN:

Is -- is that what this

In -- in many cases, yes, Your

14

Honor.

15

remedies would be local, and so the question is for our

16

system, for the United States system, how does the

17

United States system -- how does it remedy breaches?

18

And it depends upon the type of the breach.

19

instance, the breach here involved statements, and so

20

the breach occurred when the authorities did not inform

21

Mr. Sanchez-Llamas of his right to contact the

22

consulate.

23

Again, the -- the drafters recognized that

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In this

Well, of course, that's

24

assuming a causal link, which is an altogether

25

different problem.

13
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

But it's still not clear to me.

Are you

2

saying that we should require the States to follow and

3

the United States Government to follow an exclusionary

4

rule because that's what the treaty requires or because

5

this is the remedy that we ought to devise in the

6

exercise of our supervisory powers?

7

latter, it seems to me surely there must be some causal

8

linkage between the violation and the -- and the

9

statement at -- at a minimum.

10

MR. GARTLAN:

And if it's the

Yes, Your Honor.

Well, it's

kind of a combination of both.

14

suppression is a creature of this Court's authority,

15

common law authority.

The treaty directs give

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

23

It was not

again, that -- that's a call upon the judiciary to

remedy treaty violations, and -- and that's been -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But there wasn't any word

3

in either of the ICJ judgments, if I recall them

4

correctly, that said, United States, you have a

5

suppression remedy, so you should suppress.

6

MR. GARTLAN:

No, Your Honor, because again,

7

remedies are a question of domestic law, so it's up to

8

the domestic courts to decide what would be the

9

appropriate remedy.

10

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, did you ask for any

11

remedy in this case other than suppression?

12

on the motion to suppress, am I right?

13
14
15

MR. GARTLAN:

This arose

Correct, Your Honor.

No other

remedy but -- but suppression.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

One of the things -- and I

-- I really have this question for all counsel.

Miranda warning is given, it seems to me that that

comprehends the relief that you need.

If the accused

If he does not, he proceeds at his risk.

Attorneys

22

have lots of things they can tell clients, and if you

23

don't have an attorney, you proceed at your risk.

24

just think this is a very important point here.

25

MR. GARTLAN:

I

Yes, Your Honor, and many

15
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1

courts have held that -- well, the Miranda rights

2

pretty much encompasses these rights, but they're

3

different.

4

critical about this, what's really important is that

5

for every United States citizen who's arrested -- and

6

typically interrogation is going to follow quickly on

7

the heels of the arrest -- they're giving the Miranda

8

warnings.

9

They can speak to the police.

These are standalone rights, and what's

And essentially they have three options.
They can invoke the

10

right to silence, or they can invoke the right to an

11

attorney.

12

option and that fourth option is they can have the

13

consulate contacted, if they want.

14

provides different kinds of information and support for

15

the arrestee.

16

However, foreign nationals have a fourth

And the consulate

And it's -- what's critical is -- what's hard

17

to see is that because we're in this country, we don't

18

see it, but if you're overseas and you've been arrested

19

-- let's say you're in Damascus and you're given a dime

20

and your options are to call the local attorney

21

provided by your jailers or the American consulate.

22

And I think it's pretty clear that most people are

23

going to call the American consulate.

24

because there's a kind of a familiarity.

attraction there.

There's an appeal.

4

You're dealing with the known.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Whereas, a

That may give you a warmer

5

feeling inside, but do you think that the foreign

6

consulate is -- is more likely to give you good advice

7

about what you should do under American law than an

8

American lawyer that you've been provided?

9

MR. GARTLAN:

Well, you know, Your Honor,

10

it's not really the content of the advice.

11

question is at this point what would people do, and the

12

legal error here, what's wrong, is that the foreign

13

national is given the same three options, but by law,

14

he's supposed to have a fourth option.

is not to be trusted to have the expertise that's at

9

least equivalent to that of the foreign counsel?

10

MR. GARTLAN:

No.

What I'm saying, Your

11

Honor, is that if you're arrested, the next -- you have

12

a choice, and you have one of three if you are a

13

national, but if you're a foreigner, you have one of

14

four.

And the question --

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The question -But the question is who

17

tells you about that choice, and your attorney can tell

18

you about that choice.

19

MR. GARTLAN:

But this contemplates that the

20

detaining authorities informed the person of -- of what

21

their rights are to contact the consulate.

22
23

JUSTICE BREYER:
They don't do it.

Suppose they don't do it.

They violated the treaty.

24

MR. GARTLAN:

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, Your Honor.
We assume that.

Then the

question is, what is a proper remedy?

2

MR. GARTLAN:

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, Your Honor.
And I'll assume with you,

4

for the moment, that -- that the treaty has to be read

5

as saying you have to have some kind of appropriate

6

remedy, but it doesn't say what kind.

7

an appropriate remedy that he was given a lawyer, if he

8

wanted one, and the lawyer either told him about the

9

right to talk to the consul or he didn't.

So why isn't it

And if he

10

didn't -- if he did, he found out, and if he didn't and

11

it mattered, maybe that was ineffective assistance of

12

counsel.

13

counsel claims to take care of the tough cases where it

14

really did matter, doesn't that suffice under the

15

treaty, or does it?

16

So if we have ineffective assistance of

MR. GARTLAN:

Your Honor, I'd -- I'd like to

17

-- to move back the discussion to there's no attorney

18

yet, and the question is what can that person do.

19

-- and the error --

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

And

Oh, he's stuck without an

21

attorney.

22

that the treaty was violated.

23

but now you're talking about the domestic court's power

24

to do what there is an international obligation to do,

25

which is to create a remedy.

I have no doubt about that.

I have no doubt

I'm not sure why that

MR. GARTLAN:

Well, actually the language of

the article says without delay, Your Honor, so that

suggests that there's some kind of promptness that's --

4

that's involved.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Promptness.

And I think

that the United States has told us it's generally done

here somewhere between 24 and 72 hours.

has been given Miranda warnings as here -- the

begin before that 24 hours or 72 hours expires.
MR. GARTLAN:

And our reading of the article

12

is that once the -- the police know or have grounds to

believe that the -- that the person is probably a

foreign national, then that duty arises on the police

to give him his rights.

MR. GARTLAN:

Yes, Your Honor, but in -- in

this case, the -- the statements that we're seeking to

after the initial arrest.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

going back to -- to the point Justice Ginsburg made, if

the United States follows a 48- to 72-hour rule, is --

is that a violation of the treaty?

15

MR. GARTLAN:

Yes, Your Honor, because our

position is that once somebody says, yes, I -- I want

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, that, Mr. -- could your

client's attorney have argued in the Virginia habeas

proceeding that his procedural default should have been

excused because of ineffective assistance of trial

Yes.

13

limitations because an ineffective assistance claim,

doesn't raise a Miranda violation in trial, it can be

MR. STANCIL:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Why should this be

elevated to a special status beyond that?

7
8

Correct.

MR. STANCIL:

It's not elevated, Your Honor.

It's actually treated more like the right it

9

resembles, like a Brady right, which is not defaulted

10

if you don't raise it -- raise it at trial, for three

11

reasons.

12

First, like a Brady case, a Vienna Convention

13

violation resulting in the exclusion of exculpatory

14

evidence is, by its nature, not known at the time of

15

trial.

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but isn't -- isn't the

17

problem with your analogy that counsel do not advise

18

their clients about Brady rights because, by definition

19

or in the normal case by definition, counsel doesn't

20

know whether there's a Brady violation.

21

does know or, it seems to me, can properly be charged

22

with knowing that when he's representing a foreign

23

national, the foreign national has a Vienna Convention

24

right, just as much as the foreign national has a

25

Miranda right, and he can advise him of that.

But counsel

1
2

seems to me the Brady analogy is -- is not apt.
MR. STANCIL:

A Brady violation is a closer

3

match than a -- for example, a Miranda violation, for

4

the central reason that the consular officer and the

5

foreign national, working together, know best whether

6

to exercise those rights.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But in this case, wasn't

8

it true that the trial counsel knew about the Vienna

9

Convention right and, for whatever reason, thought his

10

client would not be aided by talking to the Honduran

11

counsel -- consul.

12

MR. STANCIL:

As an initial matter, it's --

13

it's not perfectly clear in the record.

14

an affidavit stating that he never advised clients of

15

Vienna Convention violations, but it does not say on

16

this record that he knew at the time of trial about the

17

Vienna Convention.

18

He submitted

But even granting that he did, the attorney

19

is not in the position to make that decision.

20

case illustrates why, and this is my second reason why

21

an ineffective assistance claim, Justice Alito, would

22

be insufficient, which is ineffective assistance trusts

23

strategic decisions about whether to invoke a right to

24

the counsel, but the counsel, the lawyer, is not -- is

25

not in a position to make that decision for his client.

As this case illustrates, even assuming that the

counsel knew about the Vienna Convention right, he

said, well, that's more trouble than it's worth.

case illustrates precisely why we don't leave those

5

decisions with the lawyers.

This

First and foremost --

JUSTICE ALITO:

ineffective assistance of counsel.

understand why -- if a jurisdiction in this country has

a procedural default rule that can be overcome by a

That may or may not have been

10

showing of cause and prejudice with ineffective

11

assistance of counsel being cause, why isn't that a

12

remedy that is sufficient to give full effect to the

13

treaty, which is what the treaty requires?

14

MR. STANCIL:

Because that cuts out an entire

15

category of treaty violations where it may have been a

16

strategic decision by counsel not to raise it, but

17

where that decision is ultimately mistaken.

18

treaty is structured --

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And as the

Well, that's true about

20

the right to remain silent or any other rights that are

21

very much the rights of the defendant, not the rights

22

of the counsel, but they're exercised in consultation

23

with the counsel, and if they make a determination not

24

to contact the consul, then that's a decision that

25

counsel made, and if it's ineffective, there are

2

than the right to remain silent.

3

MR. STANCIL:

I'm not sure how it's different

Well, I should back up and --

4

and point to the first reason why a lawyer isn't

5

effective in making this decision and -- and first,

6

state that the lawyer here never told Mario Bustillo

7

about the Vienna Convention.

8

situation where he consulted with his client and

9

elected not to raise it.

10

So it isn't that

He didn't even tell his

client.

11

But more fundamentally, the lawyer operates

12

under inherent conflict of interest.

13

the consular officer does, when he makes contact with a

14

foreign national, is decide is the lawyer that he has

15

good enough.

16

assistance that's specified in the text of the treaty.

17

The first thing

In fact, it's the only form of consular

In article 36(1)(c), it says to ensure that he can

obtain adequate legal representation.

who's deciding whether to get the consulate involved,

has to think in the back of his mind, well, is the

21

first word out of this consular officer's mouth going

22

to be, well, you know, fire this guy and get a new

lawyer, and that's why the treaty doesn't trust those

rights to the lawyer.

If the

him, and if the lawyer fails to tell him, then that's

ineffective assistance in an appropriate circumstance,

What's wrong with that?

14

But that's a good remedy.

And the other obligation is, counsel, you

have to raise this issue as soon as everybody learns

16

about it, in which case you might be out because I

don't -- he's certainly learned about it by the time he

I'm not sure I -And if so, what is it?

So following our

JUSTICE BREYER:

Anywhere.

I -- I just think

--

22

MR. STANCIL:

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well --- think for our most severe

24

violations, we provide an approach that you tell the

25

lawyer.

The lawyer brings it up.

If the lawyer

1-800-FOR-DEPO

1

doesn't bring it up and it's important or there's a

2

conflict of interest or something terrible is going on,

3

normally you'd say that's ineffective assistance.

4

I just wonder if that approach doesn't work here.

5

MR. STANCIL:

6

foremost, it doesn't vindicate --

7

It does not.

JUSTICE BREYER:

And

First and

Well, I'm not interested in,

now at the moment, whether it does or does not work.

9

10

American law or international law where people have

11

gone further than that.

12

asking it seriously.

13

MR. STANCIL:

And there might be.

I

I'm

Well, the -- well, the ICJ has

14

held that you can't rely -- that these procedural

15

default rules are not adequate to vindicate the treaty

16

interests.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

18

procedural default rule.

19

that was suggested.

20

22

MR. STANCIL:

I'm not talking about a
I'm talking about the system

In -- in terms of ineffective

assistance?
JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, the procedural default

23

rule would mean you get procedurally defaulted if you

24

fail to bring it up, but I think you might say if you

25

failed to bring it up the first time that the lawyer

1

knew about it.

2

3

-- the client.

4

And if it's his fault for not bringing

But if it's not, he's not out.

MR. STANCIL:

I believe that actually would

5

not be the practice in civil law countries, for

6

example, where a judge as the inquisitor has much more

7

flexibility than he does in an adversarial system when

8

and whether to consider evidence that may or may not

9

have come in at the certain time.

10

But I'd like to get back to, Justice Souter,

11

your question, with respect to two additional points

12

why the treaty -- and I'm not saying this is our rule

13

-- the treaty says the State has to notify and -- and

14

it doesn't say the lawyer has to notify.

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No.

And I'm not -- I'm not

16

suggesting anything that -- that affects that.

17

the State does have to notify him, and if he wants, the

18

State has to make the phone call.

19

Yes,

What I am suggesting is that the lawyer

20

should be taxed with knowing that that is the

21

individual's right.

22

knowing that because it's the law of the land.

23

treaty.

24

upon the lawyer to say, well, did they -- did they tell

25

you, did they notify the consul, just as the lawyer

The lawyer should be taxed with
It's a

And -- and it seems to me the obligation is

36
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

would say, did you get the Miranda warnings.

2

and if the lawyer does not make that inquiry and does

3

not raise an objection, whatever it may be, if in fact

4

the individual didn't get his rights, then I don't see

5

why there should be -- there should not be a waiver

6

with respect to the Vienna Convention objection, just

7

as there is a waiver with respect to a Miranda

8

objection or a search and seizure objection and -- and

9

other constitutional rights.

10

MR. STANCIL:

And --

And again, ineffective -- an

11

ineffective assistance claim doesn't give full effect

12

because under this Court's cases, if it's -- if it's in

13

the rubric of ineffective assistance, you leave

14

strategic decisions to the lawyer, and so if --

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, the problem at the

16

trial level, I think, is you would be -- you couldn't

17

make it at that stage because it's the very lawyer

18

who's ineffective.

19

counsel on appeal, and that's really the first

20

opportunity it could come up because the -- the lawyer

21

who didn't give this advice certainly isn't going to

22

say, in -- in the course of the trial, I was

23

ineffective.

24

the ICJ was trying to make when it said you couldn't

25

use the procedural default rule.

Here, it was raised by a new

So -- and that's I think the point that

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. STANCIL:

Yes, Justice Ginsburg, and in

2

that sense, it's very much like the rule this Court

3

laid down in Federal cases in Massaro where it -- it

4

explained just the practical difficulties associated

5

with requiring claims that need, for example, a

6

prejudice record, and everybody believes that a

7

prejudice showing would need to be made before you

8

could establish a violation.

9

But here, we'd have to -- we have to go back

10

and we need the tools of post-conviction review to

11

establish prejudice.

12

this is -- this is not speculation.

client.

15

16

saying it was barred for other reasons, said that

17

18

treaty violations that, if you push these claims to

19

ineffective assistance, they evaporate, and that does

20

not get --

21

And here, once we got there -This is a lawyer

And then we tried to raise an ineffective

22

we've been covering, but all seem to concede that the

23

particular characteristics of a national system have to

of our system is that it's an adversary system.

And the distinguishing feature

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

you're asking us to make an exception to that system --

2

MR. STANCIL:

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I --- an exception to the

4

usual rules that prevail in that system, and that's not

5

consistent with what the treaty requires.

6

MR. STANCIL:

Your Honor, it's no more of an

7

exception than Brady, which is exactly the same

8

situation where you have a right that you don't know

9

either the violation has occurred, because they didn't

10

tell him and his lawyer didn't tell him, and you don't

11

know the evidence that could have been developed.

12

Here, once that -- once that missing piece, that one

13

critical part of article 36, direct notification and

14

contact with the consulate, once that key is removed,

15

everything else follows.

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but that's because in

17

Brady, as Justice Souter has already pointed out,

18

there's a factual piece of evidence that the State has

21

Here, the lawyer is presumed to know the

It's just not an apt analogy.
MR. STANCIL:

We believe it is, in part,

22

because this is an affirmative obligation on the State.

23

Miranda is a rule, for example, that requires you to

24

say what the -- the rules of the game are and this is

25

how it works.

This is different.

This is

3

that he has a right to go out and ask somebody for

5

uniquely within the possession and control of a

6

consular officer.

7

This says, you've got to tell

The government immigration records.

The consular -- the lawyer could not have gotten those

8

records.

9

fundamentally, the lawyer didn't even know those

They were crucial to the defense.

11

So even if you would assume that an

12

ineffective assistance claim could remedy violations --

13

and -- and we certainly believe this case and a large

14

category of other cases could never be remedied through

15

ineffective assistance claims as a practical matter.

16

Even then, all it does is breed ineffective assistance

17

claim after ineffective assistance claim because the

18

trial lawyer doesn't know what's in the embassy's file.

19

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, maybe after the first

20

ineffective assistance claim is decided in the client's

21

favor, people are going to wake up.

22

to admit at this stage of the game -- and it's not your

23

client's fault, but the -- this is a fairly rare bird.

I mean, you have

And therefore, my -- my

MR. STANCIL:

Don't you?

It doesn't seem to be the case.

In fact -- and our research has revealed that about 60

13

ineffective assistance claims based on the Vienna

14

Convention violations -- it's ambiguous as to whether

15

there's one or none where the court has granted relief

16

either on prejudice grounds or performance grounds.

17

litigants have tried, but that just shows what a poor

18

fit ineffective assistance claims are.

19

JUSTICE SOUTER:

May I ask you one factual

20

question?

-- if I did know it, I can't remember it now.

22

So

I just -- if

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT IN NO. 04-10566

MS. WILLIAMS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Counsel describes the rule that he asks this

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Court to announce under article 36 as revolutionary,

2

and I think that's accurate.

3

for this Court to construe the article 36 of the Vienna

4

Convention to grant an individual foreign national a

5

right to obtain a judicially created sanction against

6

the State for its failure to provide the information

7

that it is obliged to -- to provide under article 36.

8

No other signatory's court has construed the treaty to

9

permit an individual in a criminal proceeding to raise

It would be revolutionary

10

the kind of challenge that Petitioner seeks to raise

11

here, and certainly no other court has suggested that

12

exclusion of lawfully obtained evidence would be the

13

appropriate remedy for that violation.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

Have there been courts

15

that have held the contrary?

16

that said when somebody wasn't notified and they sought

17

to obtain some remedy for that, that even though the

18

treaty has been violated, you have no remedy under our

19

system?

20
21
22

MS. WILLIAMS:

Have there been courts

There have been only a handful

of courts that have dealt with the issue.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Which are -- which is the

23

best authority abroad for you that -- where they say,

24

no, we're sorry, we give you no remedy, even though we

25

violated the treaty?

no remedy for -- in a criminal proceeding for that sort

4

of remedy.

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's a holding?

They --

they held that?

And there are, in fact --

MS. WILLIAMS:
court opinion.

9

It is a holding.

It's a lower

It's not the --

JUSTICE BREYER:

So we have a lower court

10

opinion in Canada, and you -- and they have a lower

11

court opinion in Australia.

12

the conclusion no one has ever really decided this?

13
14

MS. WILLIAMS:

Is it fair if I come to

I think that's absolutely

fair, and what's --

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

If -- then if

16

that's fair, is it fair also for us to say that -- that

17

we have to take this treaty, since it's self-executing,

18

as if it were written into American law?

19

MS. WILLIAMS:

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

21

MS. WILLIAMS:

22
23

I think, though, it is -Is that fair?

Yes, that is fair, but I think

it -JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

If that's fair, then

24

suppose you're coming -- suppose the treaty had said --

25

and it's part of American law.

1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

MS. WILLIAMS:

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.
It didn't say this, but

3

suppose it had.

4

and if you don't inform the individual, you have to

5

give him a remedy so that he is not prejudiced thereby.

6

Now, if it had said that and the State or the Federal

You have to inform this individual,

7

Government refused to give him a remedy and it's part

8

of American law, wouldn't we have to say that American

9

law, Federal law, treaty law requires you to do that

10

rather than what you're doing, if it had said that?

11

MS. WILLIAMS:

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

13

MS. WILLIAMS:

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

If it had said that -Okay.

-- I would agree with you.
And once we're there, it

15

seems to me what we're arguing about is not this

16

metaphysical thing about rights.

17

what the treaty says.

18

we're back to where we were in the last case and say

19

does this treaty or does it not, as a matter of

20

American law, say that the person is entitled to some

21

kind of remedy.

22

has said, yes, it does, but it doesn't mention it, but

23

it does say that you cannot have procedural rights that

24

do not give full effect to the purpose of -- of this

25

section.

We're arguing about

Now, if that's so, I -- I think

And our problem there is that the ICJ

So where are we?

45
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

MS. WILLIAMS:

I think the starting point is

2

with the text and context of the treaty, and beginning

3

with the preamble that makes it very clear that this

4

treaty, like other international treaties, is an

5

international agreement concerned with the obligations

6

of the signatories, not with any particular granting of

7

rights for the individuals who may benefit from those

8

obligations.

9

And one thing that the preamble makes very

10

clear is that matters not expressly regulated by the

11

provisions of the treaty are left to the rules of

12

customary international law.

13

The only remedy that is discussed as part of

14

the -- the treaty negotiation is the optional protocol

15

that would permit signatories, not individuals, to take

16

a dispute under the treaty to the International Court

17

of Justice.

18

of the treaty and there is evidence contrary --

19

So there is little evidence in the context

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, the -- the thing is, I

20

found stronger the other way, which you can answer, is

21

that ordinarily, I guess, since they quote in one these

22

amicus briefs, since at least 1927 we consider -- our

23

State Department -- the treaties that have obligations

24

are -- also require appropriate enforcement remedies,

25

et cetera.

And we have Avena and we have LaGrand, and

46
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

there the ICJ, as I read it, has said you have to have

2

some kind of remedy, being pretty vague about what kind

3

it is.

4

we can.

5

All right.

So normally we follow the ICJ, if

Schooner Betsy and go back forever.
All right.

So why not?

Just follow what

6

they say, say there has to be some kind of remedy.

7

then we put our minds to figuring out what that kind

8

is.

9

MS. WILLIAMS:

And

Your Honor, even following the

10

ICJ opinion in Avena does not get Petitioner the relief

11

that he seeks in this Court or that he sought below.

12

It does not get you to suppression of the statements

13

that were made.

14

It's -- it's -- there are a couple of very

15

important things to consider in the Avena decision from

16

the ICJ.

17

rule, and they specifically reject Mexico's assertion

18

that there's a connection somehow between the provision

19

of information and -- under the article 36 and the

20

ongoing criminal interrogation.

21

discuss the -- the concept of without delay and what

22

that meant to -- to those who put together the treaty.

23

They discuss suppression and the exclusionary

So -- and they also

And it does not mean immediately.

So there -- under

24

the ICJ's reading of the treaty, there would not be a

25

basis to suppress the statements that Petitioner seeks

47
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

to suppress in our court.

I think --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is there any other relief

request.

6

the kind that the ICJ thought would be appropriate,

7

which was, court, reconsider this and determine whether

8

the defendant was prejudiced by the absence of Vienna

9

Convention notice?

10

There was the suppression

Was there any other?

MS. WILLIAMS:

Was there a request of

There -- there was not, Your

11

Honor.

12

this case is suppression of the statements.

13

The only remedy that Petitioner has sought in

And it's also important, I think, to make the

14

distinction between the Oregon case and the Virginia

15

case.

16

Petitioner knew about the obligations under article 36

17

and raised them in the motion to suppress.

18

there's no question about the State's obligation to --

19

to inform the consul that the -- that Petitioner was

20

being detained or any concern with interference with

21

consular access and communication.

22

that we have in the case is that the State failed to

23

provide the information that it was obligated to

24

provide under article 36.

25

In the Oregon case, it's clear that counsel for

Does this mean that the --

the desk sergeant in the police station or who?
MS. WILLIAMS:

We've actually worked with our

5

jail managers to develop a form that could be used as

6

part of the booking process to provide the information.

7

And the -- I mean, I think the more we do the

8

education, probably the better the compliance will be.

9

But what's important is that we're attempting to do

10

that not because the treaty obligates that sort of

11

immediate notification at the risk of not being able to

12

use evidence obtained in a later criminal proceeding.

13
14
15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, it does obligate

immediate notification to the defendant, doesn't it?
MS. WILLIAMS:

It says without delay that the

16

information should be provided, but that phrase,

17

without delay, when you look at the prefatory materials

18

and how the ICJ has construed it, doesn't mean

19

immediately.

20

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, but there are two

21

different without delay points:

22

-- the defendant; and secondly, whether or not he wants

23

the consulate notified, and there's the second delay.

24
25

MS. WILLIAMS:

one, when you tell the

And the way the ICJ has

construed that, after reviewing the materials, is that

the phrase, without delay, means the same thing in the

2

three places that it's used in the treaty.

3

there is -- it's not an immediate requirement.

4

is some time that can pass, and in some countries,

5

there may be considerable time.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And so

not -- it's not required for police interrogators in

the station to include this?

MS. WILLIAMS:

It is not required under the

treaty that the advice be given prior to interrogation.
That's correct.

13
14

They can -- they can

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, how about during the

interrogation?

15

MS. WILLIAMS:

At some point in a prolonged

16

interrogation, that right is -- that obligation will

arise.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I mean, it seems to me it's

not like rocket science.

them -- give them the advice.

22

You've had study groups and

Well, you just tell the policemen give

MS. WILLIAMS:

End of case.

Well, and part of the

23

difficulty is it's not so easy to give simply a simple

24

advice because it's not always clear that someone is a

25

foreign national, and even if there's a suggestion that

someone might be --

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, that's easy.

If you

3

are a foreign national, you -- that's easy too.

4

don't -- I don't see why this is so complicated.

5

MS. WILLIAMS:

I

The other difficulty is that

6

for some foreign nationals, this is not -- this is not

7

the case where the detainee controls the contact with

8

consular officials.

9

obligations.

We have mandatory notification

So it's important to establish what

10

country the individual is from, and some individuals

11

would prefer that the officials not know what country

12

they are from.

And certainly we're hoping to

move toward better compliance by moving toward that

goal.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Of course, he doesn't

have to answer that.

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Your answer -- your answer

6

doesn't give me confidence that you're implementing the

7

treaty.

8
9

MS. WILLIAMS:

But the question is when there

is a violation and -- and if it's from lack of

10

education or lack of effort on the State's part to

11

ensure that people understand the obligation, then does

12

the treaty give the individual the right in a criminal

proceeding to have that lawfully obtained evidence kept

out of the proceeding.

15

better efforts to improve compliance with what is an

16

obligation that we have under the treaty, but that

17

doesn't take this Court to suppressing the evidence in

19

sought from the Court.

20

And so certainly we can make

JUSTICE STEVENS:

A little while ago you were

21

asked about the judge asking whether or not to ask the

22

defendant if the advice was given him.

23

suggestion was made there's no duty on the State judge

to enforce a Federal treaty, but if it's a matter of

Federal law, why wouldn't it be a duty to -- on the

judge to obey Federal law if -- if it is part of our

2

Federal requirement?

3

MS. WILLIAMS:

I think the question would

4

come down to whether the judge falls in the category of

5

competent authorities under the treaty, and I'm not

6

sure how that would be construed, whether it would be

7

construed to include the judge or if it's primarily

8

focused on the -- the State government officials who

would be involved in the -- the criminal proceeding.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM E. THRO

16

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT IN NO. 05-51

17
18

MR. THRO:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

19

The Vienna Convention does not create

20

judicially enforceable individual rights.

21

Nevertheless, if this Court were to hold that it does

22

create individual rights, those treaty claims should

23

not be treated more favorably than constitutional

24

claims.

25

In Virginia, if a criminal defendant has a

55
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Miranda claim or a Fourth Amendment claim and fails to

2

raise it at trial, he may not raise it on collateral

3

review.

4

to any violation of the Vienna Convention.

5

reason to elevate a treaty claim above a Miranda claim

6

or a Fourth Amendment claim.

7

The same reasoning should apply with respect

JUSTICE SOUTER:

There's no

Does -- does -- would

8

Virginia allow the -- a claim of ineffective assistance

9

of counsel to be raised on collateral review for a

10

failure of counsel to -- to advise the client or take

11

action on the client's behalf under the Virginia

12

Convention -- the Vienna Convention during -- during

13

the -- the direct proceedings?

14

MR. THRO:

Yes, Your Honor.

If -- if this

15

Court were to announce a new rule that the Vienna

16

Convention confers individual rights, and if counsel

17

failed to raise that at trial, and if that failure

18

constituted ineffective assistance under the standard

19

articulated in Strickland v. Washington, then it would

20

be permissible for that criminal defendant to raise it

21

in his collateral review.

22

Yes.

And in fact, Mr. Bustillo attempted to raise

23

an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, did raise

24

an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in the State

25

trial court.

That claim was denied, and for whatever

56
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

reason, he chose not to appeal that to the Virginia

2

Supreme Court.

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

I have a couple -There was a State

collateral review?

6

MR. THRO:

7

review, Your Honor.

8

Yes.

JUSTICE BREYER:

It was on State collateral

-- thinking of the wrong

9

thing, but it seemed to me I have a couple of opinions

10

here on habeas, State habeas, where they did raise it.

11

Am I thinking of the other case?

12
13

MR. THRO:

It -- it was raised in the -- in

the State trial court, Your Honor.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

15

MR. THRO:

And -- and not on --

But -- but what was -- and the

16

State trial court chose to deny the ineffective

17

assistance of counsel claim on a variety of reasons,

18

and it was chosen -- he chose not to appeal that to the

19

Supreme Court of Virginia.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought the first time

21

it was raised was on direct appeal by appellate

22

counsel.

23

MR. THRO:

Appellate counsel on direct appeal

24

attempted to raise it.

25

-- a remand.

He filed a motion requesting a

That motion was denied as -- as improper.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Then in -- once the conviction had been

2

affirmed by the Virginia Court of Appeals, by the

3

Supreme Court of Virginia, and review had been denied

4

by this Court, he went back and filed a collateral

5

review claiming ineffective assistance of counsel for,

6

among other things, failure to raise the Vienna

7

Convention.

8

assistance of counsel claim, and then there was no --

9

and then the decision was made not to pursue that --

The trial court denied that ineffective

10

the appeal of the denial of the ineffective assistance

11

of counsel claim to the Supreme Court of Virginia.

12
13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And the reason for the

denial?

14

MR. THRO:

There were several reasons for the

15

denial, one of which was statute of limitations, but

16

the court also noted that even if it had been made

17

within the statute of limitations, there was no merit

18

to it.

19

The record reflects, Your Honor, that Mr.

20

Bustillo's retained trial counsel was fully aware of

21

the Vienna Convention claim.

22

of Salvadoran diplomats and was familiar with Vienna

23

Convention issues.

24

it would be better to -- to contain his client and to

25

contain the amount of people talking to his client and,

In fact, he was the son

He made a strategic decision that

58
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

therefore, he should not raise the Vienna Convention

2

issue at trial. And that is set forth in the affidavit

3

of retained counsel, set forth on pages 318 through 319

4

of the habeas record in the Fairfax County Circuit

5

Court.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I think that counsel said

7

that the -- the people at the consulate -- they tend to

8

talk a lot?

9

MR. THRO:

Yes, he --

yes, he did, Your

10

Honor, and having grown up as the son of diplomats, he

11

was obviously familiar with diplomats and their

12

behavior in social settings.

13

his strategic view that his client was better off not

14

raising and not contacting the consulate.

15

And it was his feeling and

But, again, this goes back to the basic point

16

that Justice Kennedy raised earlier.

17

give all criminal defendants, regardless of

18

nationality, a lawyer to represent them.

19

that lawyer with knowing their rights and with

20

vindicating their rights, with making the objections

21

necessary to vindicate Miranda rights, with making the

22

necessary objections with respect to the Fourth

23

Amendment.

24
25

In America, we

We charge

The Vienna Convention should be no different.
If this treaty does, in fact, create judicially

59
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

enforceable individual rights, then the attorneys who

2

are appointed or to represent these people will know

3

about that and will be responsible for vindicating.

4

That's how we do things in the American system.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

So then the -- then the only

6

question really is this thing that I find metaphysical,

7

and maybe you can explain it.

the individual rights that -- enforceable, that sounds

to me like a -- you know, a case that arises under 1983

11

concept.

12

law of the United States.

13

the only question is whether the action here violates a

14

provision of the treaty, which is the law of the land.

15

But I thought we don't need that

We all agree that -- that this -- this is the
It's self-executing.

And

What else is there?

16

And -- and the only thing I read that the ICJ

17

said, it said, by the way, I'll tell you what kind of

18

procedural rule you can't have.

19

procedural rule that says after you failed to inform

20

him of the right and after he's unbelievably

21

prejudiced, you say he can't raise it because he didn't

22

raise it before he could possibly have found out about

23

the right.

have that kind of a rule.

25

You can't have a

That would be self-defeating.

So you can't

Now, do you agree with that?

1

MR. THRO:

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

3

6

No, Your Honor.

We --

You explain to me where I --

where I --

4
5

No.

MR. THRO:

Well, I will certainly attempt to

do so.
I -- I think the flaw in the ICJ's reasoning

7

is failure to recognize that in the United States all

8

criminal defendants are -- are given an attorney, and

9

that that attorney is charged with providing

10

constitutionally effective assistance of counsel,

11

meaning being aware of all of the constitutional rights

12

and all of the Federal and State statutory, and presumably

13

Federal -- Federal treaty rights as well.

14

There's no doubt that no Virginia official

15

informed Mr. Bustillo of his opportunity to contact the

16

consulate, but it is also clear that his retained

17

counsel knew of it and chose not to pursue it.

18

that may or may not be ineffective assistance of

19

counsel, but it does not justify setting aside the

20

State's procedural bars on collateral review, which

21

would apply for a Miranda violation or a Fourth

22

Amendment violation.

Now,

23

I would also note, Your Honor, that the

24

United States is unique in the world in having an

25

extensive system of collateral review for criminal

61
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

convictions.

2

have a method of collateral attack.

3

the world doesn't have to have a method of collateral

4

attack, it seems rather disingenuous to suggest that

5

the United States has to modify our rules of collateral

6

attack in order to accommodate the treaty.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

12

would be, if this Court were to announce a new rule --

13

would be charged with the knowledge and, therefore,

14

could I think correct any error that may have been made

15

by the failure of the local officials or the national

16

officials to inform the criminal defendant of his

17

opportunity to contact the consulate.

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

However, the -- a defense counsel

You know, one thing I find

19

difficulty understanding in this case is I just can't

20

understand how a lawyer thought it would be to his

21

client's advantage not to consul -- not to tell the

consul because the facts are quite persuasive that he

really was severely prejudiced by the fact he didn't

makes the judgment that, you know, I don't think it's

going to do any good to notify the consulate, wouldn't

he be better advised not to tell his client about it?

that's one thing -- thing that, whatever rule you

reason to -- to --

he has a right to a trial within a certain number of

Suppose that the treaty provides that if the individual

2

sends a letter to the counsel, they have to deliver it.

3

Doesn't it?

4

MR. GARRE:

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

It does, Your Honor.
Well, suppose a sheriff

6

somewhere grabs the letter, keeps it, and the counsel

7

sues him under State property law.

8

law, they say, entitles me, says the counsel, to this

9

letter.

It's mine.

And State property

It was sent to me.

Now, if that

happens to be the interpretation of the judge in the

State of X the sheriff can keep the letter, wouldn't

you say that that property law of the State is invalid

13

in light of this provision of the treaty, which is the

14

law of the United States self-executing?

you had a State law which prevented our Nation from

giving effect to our obligations under the Vienna

Convention --

JUSTICE BREYER:

But I'm not saying a treaty.

I'm saying there's a letter and wouldn't it be the

case that the judge would have to say, here, Mr.

Sheriff, you take the letter and you hand it to the

10

counsel?

11

It's his property.

result, then yes.

JUSTICE BREYER:

to putting weight on the absence of authority.

those contracting states, most of which I guess are

account, but you won't find a case on it.

where they refused to provide for a suppression remedy.

17

So there are authorities going the other way.

18

The manner in which this treaty is

implemented by the State Department overseas and by the

through the traditional means.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If they don't -- if

they can't ask him -- I mean, I assume many foreign

nationals are detained fairly close to the border, and

if you start saying, well, my first question is, are

you a citizen or not, you've got to give Miranda

That's right.

9

Llamas.

10

First, with -- with respect to him, the

11

question is how to give full effect to the treaty in

the context of custodial interrogation, and his

13

position is that suppression is necessary to give full

14

effect.

15

the custodial -- that the remedies that are currently

16

afforded in a context of custodial interrogation are

17

ineffective.

18

And we need look no further than the fact that

And secondly, admitting evidence encourages

19

violations, and that's been the -- the result that's

20

been a constant pattern and practice of violations.

21

If I could switch back to Mr. Bustillo's

22

case, and I'd like to address what Mr. Garre just said,

23

which is that there's a presumption or that -- that

24

treaties don't create individually enforceable rights.

25

Every decision of this Court is unambiguously

the domestic law -- here it is.

3

creates rights -- here the treaty says his rights.

4

third and critically, where you have a cause of action

to enforce those rights, it is judicially enforceable

as a matter of domestic law.

international dimension of the treaty, as a matter of

example.

1

MR. STANCIL:

Not automatically, but if you

have a statute that said his rights and refers rights

3

and makes it his obligation and his decision whether to

4

invoke them, it would be classic rights-creating.

5

If I --

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It said his rights in

9

10

enforceable rights.

11

MR. STANCIL:

I would -- I would compare the

12

language of article 36(2) to any of the rights cases

13

this Court has decided.

14

If I could, in my remaining minute, describe

15

why -- and this goes to the heart of what we were

16

talking about with the procedural bar.

17

is, as Justice Breyer put it, whether pushing these

18

claims to ineffective assistance is self-defeating, we

19

have ample evidence here that it is.

20

well, it may or may not be ineffective assistance.

21

State court said it wasn't ineffective assistance.

22

That's because trial counsel doesn't have unique

23

experience and knowledge necessary to make these

24
