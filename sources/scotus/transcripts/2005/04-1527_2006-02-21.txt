CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Mr. Kayatta.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM J. KAYATTA, JR.,

8

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

9
10

MR. KAYATTA:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

- and may it please the Court:

11

The Presumpscot River is a single body of

12

water, as that term was used in last year's Miccosukee

13

decision.

14

that single body of water through Warren's five dams is

15

not a discharge into that same single body of water.

16

In arguing that certification under section 401 of the

17

Clean Water Act is, therefore, not required, we are not

18

maintaining that the State either has, or should have,

19

no voice on matters of water quality in connection with

20

the relicensing of these dams.

21

Warren's position is that the flowing of

In 1986, Congress took care to ensure States

22

a forceful, but not controlling, voice on environmental

23

issues, including water quality issues, in all

24

hydropower relicensing proceedings.

25

specific about its intent in 1986, and it intended to

Congress was very

1

give States a strong voice, but not a veto.

2

feel the case -- that the States clearly have that

3

voice.

4

Now --

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So, we

Mr. Kayatta, if I

6

took a drum of water out of the river and put it in the

7

garage next to the river for 5 years, and, 5 years

8

later, came out and poured that drum of water back into

9

the river, is that a discharge into the river?

10
11

MR. KAYATTA:

Yes, that would be a discharge

into the river.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

How is it different

13

here, where you have the dam restraining the waters for

14

a certain period, and then it's being released later,

15

at a subsequent time?

Why --

16

MR. KAYATTA:

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

18
19

Yes.
-- isn't that also a

discharge?
MR. KAYATTA:

There is -- we draw a

20

distinction -- and I'm referring just to discharge, I'm

21

not addressing the issue that the Court could get to in

22

another case of whether you actually need a discharge

23

of a pollutant, as to just a discharge into the river

24

- we draw a distinction between actually removing

25

something entirely from the river, exercising control

Alderson Reporting Company

over it.

2

for 5 years.

3

there may be a discharge into the river when an

4

activity is proposed to pour that back into the river.

5

Your hypothetical, Mr. Chief Justice, had it
In that situation, one could say that

In a -- in the dams -- the dams, the water

6

continuously flows down.

7

single body of water called the Presumpscot.

8

that's the distinction that we would draw.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The water never leaves the
And

Even though it's

10

retained in a -- what -- an impoundment pool, or

11

whatever, behind --

12

MR. KAYATTA:

Well, the dams slow down the

13

water as it comes down the Presumpscot.

14

the dams slow down the water, then the river widens in

15

an area called an impoundment area.

16

is a continuous motion leaving the dam in the same

17

amount of water that comes into the area above the dam.

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And because

But the -- there

Well, this -So, you think it's a

20

different case if it's not a continuous motion; in

21

other words, that the water is released -- you know,

22

it's released on the weekends, but, during the week, it

23

has to build up in the -- you would draw a distinction

24

and say there's a discharge, in that case?

25

MR. KAYATTA:

Mr. Chief Justice, the

5
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

distinction we would draw would be when the exercise

2

over the water, and the separation of the water from

3

the river, reach the point where it could be said that

4

we're no longer dealing with one unitary body of water,

5

as that term is defined in Miccosukee.

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If we --

But this is an important

7

point for me, and I wasn't quite clear what the briefs

8

told me about it.

9

an argument that when the water stays in the reservoir,

My understanding was that there is

10

the impoundment area, that there's a stratification,

11

and the oxygen components at different levels change,

12

so that when the water goes back into the dam, it's

13

qualitatively different.

14

sense, but it's also qualitatively different in its

15

oxygen and other characteristics.

16

me like a discharge.

17

MR. KAYATTA:

It's the same water, in a

Yes.

And that sounded to

The -- there is -- there

18

is no dispute that when one changes the movement of

19

water and its flow, then characteristics of the water

20

can change.

21

can have not a change, overall, of temperature, but a

22

stratification of warmer water going to the top, colder

23

water going to the bottom.

24

changes in other aspects of the water.

I don't --

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But is it --

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So, if it were established

I don't -So, if --

8

in this case that the water is qualitatively changed in

9

a significant degree because of its oxygen component,

10

that would be irrelevant to the question you're asking?

11

MR. KAYATTA:

The water, as it comes into the

12

dam and in the impoundment area, there is a -- there

are findings, that we are not here challenging, that

19

has pointed to.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Are you -You're saying the changes

22

occur in the river, above the dam; and, therefore,

23

what's left -- what's let back into the river below the

24

25

MR. KAYATTA:

We're saying that the river

JUSTICE STEVENS:

MR. KAYATTA:

No.

But the character of the

The character of the water

JUSTICE STEVENS:

14

Chief Justice's barrel of water that has not been

removed from the river -- it comes down the river.

16

No.

The same water that went into

the dam -JUSTICE STEVENS:

Yes, but it's the same

23

water, with a slightly different chemical composition,

24

isn't that true?

25

MR. KAYATTA:

It's the same water that went

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

JUSTICE STEVENS:

MR. KAYATTA:

JUSTICE STEVENS:

MR. KAYATTA:

MR. KAYATTA:

JUSTICE STEVENS:

10

Than it was further -Am I correct --

-- up the river.
-- when I say that?

Yes, you are.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Thank you.
But you said -- in response

11

to Justice Kennedy's question, you said that there was

12

nothing, I think, as you put it, in the exiting of the

13

water that was significantly different that -- or that

14

we could peg as significantly different.

15

seems to me to be at odds with your answer to the Chief

16

Justice's question about the barrel, because the

17

exiting of the water from the barrel and the exiting of

18

the water from the dam are exactly the same.

19

one is a discharge, I don't see why the other isn't a

20

discharge.

21

MR. KAYATTA:

But that

And if

Well, the difference, we would

22

say, is that, in the barrel hypothetical, the water has

23

been -- the water that is put into the river from the

24

barrel that has been in someone's garage for 5 years --

25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Then it isn't the exiting

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

that you're getting at.

And I --

2

MR. KAYATTA:

3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, we -I mean, it seems to me --

4

and I don't want to make a joke, but I think you're on

5

to something when you talk about the exiting, because

6

the word "discharge," as we commonly use it, is a word

7

that describes how you get rid of something.

8

you get rid of something, it seems to me, is exactly

9

the same, whether you're pouring the barrel over the

And how

10

bank or whether pouring the barrel, as it were, through

11

the turbine after impounding it, it is the --

12

everybody's been quoting dictionary definitions -- it's

13

the "flowing out."

14

the barrel as it is with the dam.

15

MR. KAYATTA:

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

The flowing out is the same with

The difference -And that seems to me where I

17

have trouble with your argument.

18

MR. KAYATTA:

Yes, Justice Souter.

19

difference is the "discharge into."

20

"discharge into the river," you need something

21

different than the river to go into the river.

22

JUSTICE SOUTER:

The

To have something

Well, as I understand it, in

23

some or all of these dams, at the point of discharge,

24

there isn't any river down there.

25

the bed, in effect, has been deprived of the river by

It's dry.

It's --

the impoundment, so that you're not simply, as it were,

2

taking, you know, one spoonful out here and dropping it

3

into a river -- putting the spoonful back into a river

4

that's flowing there, because it isn't flowing there,

5

as a result of your dam.

6

MR. KAYATTA:

But the -- if you accept the

7

proposition that the river is divided into two

8

different things, then you can start to talk about a

9

discharge of one thing into the other.

But Miccosukee

10

makes clear that the structure of a dam does not keep

11

us from viewing this as a single body of water which

12

flows through a dam.

13

14

through the dam.

15

It does not flow "into the

Yes.

water as it flows down the river, before it goes

The water that then goes in and emits

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought the descriptions

6

that we had was, it is a result of the impoundment and

7

the subsequent release that the water emerges in this

8

unnatural state, in this striated state that Justice

9

Kennedy was referring to.

10
11

MR. KAYATTA:

The -- it is the

impoundment that changes the nature of the water.

12
13

Yes.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And not the release.

You

contest that the release makes any change.

14

MR. KAYATTA:

The release simply continues

15

the flow of that water, albeit however it has been

16

changed by mechanisms other than discharges into the

17

river.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, that's true, but --

19

so, you said it's conceded in this case?

20

answer to Justice Kennedy, you said something that -- I

21

was surprised, if it's conceded.

22

conceded -- tell me if I'm wrong -- that the States

23

have water quality standards.

24

standards may or may not have something to do with

25

point source discharges.

agreement that it only concerns point discharges, or

14

does it concern water quality standards?

This seems to me to go back into
And of course you have to

And so, isn't the purpose of -- is there

15

MR. KAYATTA:

The consistent position of the

16

EPA all along has been that 401 requires a discharge

17

from a point source before it applies.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

19

MR. KAYATTA:

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

Really?

Yes.
In other words -- discharge

21

from a point source, what is -- well, then EPA concedes

22

you win?

23

MR. KAYATTA:

No.

EPA is claiming that the

24

discharge from a point source occurs as the water exits

MR. KAYATTA:

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, fine.

-- not in the -So, what's --

-- impoundment.
-- the problem?

So, they're

6

saying, as I thought was true since 1920, that you're

7

going to get your dam only if you comply with State

8

standards, including standards about fish, algae, junk

9

in the water, all kinds of things that might be put

10

there by the dam.

11

MR. KAYATTA:

Well, the -- 401 is a

12

triggering, or a threshold determination, as set forth

13

in one of this Court's prior decisions, that gives the

14

State not just a voice, but essentially a mandatory

15

veto over a very broad area.

16

is, have we triggered -- have we stepped over that

17

threshold?

18

between the parties on is that to step over that

19

threshold, to trigger 401, one has to have a discharge

20

into the navigable waters --

21

The question in this case

The point that there is no disagreement

JUSTICE BREYER:

Right.

And they're saying,

22

"Of course there is a discharge.

23

discharge of water."

24

Now, that's enough for you to have to comply with the

25

State standards before the F- -- FERC is going to give

MR. KAYATTA:

No, their position is precisely

that the water is running into the water.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now, have you got anything

- I've heard you argue about the word "discharge"; and

6

you say "discharge" doesn't mean "discharge of water,"

it means something else.

8

logical argument.

9

you'd have, related to the purpose of the statute for

Is there any other argument that

11

MR. KAYATTA:

Yes.

Let me refer to the

12

purpose.

13

general pronouncements about purpose.

14

Respondents have taken those general pronouncements to

15

basically say, "Anything that allows the States greater

16

control or improvement over water quality is the

17

direction in which the statute should be interpreted,

18

to achieve that general purpose."

19

that, notwithstanding the general purposes, that

20

Congress, when it turned to approve specific words in

21

401, did not simply say "anything that affects water

22

quality."

23

example, means that Federal permits for grazing, or

24

Federal permits for logging roads, do not trigger 401;

25

and they do not trigger it, because there is no

There's -- as is always the case, there are

Alderson Reporting Company

1

discharge from a point source.

2

So, we know a line has been drawn by Congress

3

in pursuit of its purpose, as compared to other goals

4

that Congress has in mind.

5

that line drawn?

6

see where that was drawn, and it was "discharge into

7

the navigable waters."

8

is, we're left with trying to, sort of, almost

9

metaphysically think of the water discharge -- the same

10

water discharging into the same water in order to reach

11

a conclusion that the real way you should read the

12

statute is just as if it says, "If one does anything at

13

all to the water, you need to get certification."

14

we don't think it says that.

15

The question is, Where was

We think you look to the statute to

MR. KAYATTA:

Exactly.

And we would --

I think they could -- I'm not

sure they could word it that way, but they could

consideration to the State's arguments.

So, you're concerned

about conditions -- I mean, as a practical matter, in

22

considers and decides whether it wants to impose those

conditions.

That's correct.

very substantial issue, because essentially what FERC

proceedings are -- under the hydropower sections of

MR. KAYATTA:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Does FERC --

-- "proceeding."
-- as a regulator,

tend to give greater priority to power considerations,

8

as opposed to local environmental concerns?

9

MR. KAYATTA:

There was some concern prior to

10

'86 by Congress that FERC was doing just that.

11

that's why Congress told, in 1986, long after the

12

statute was passed, that FERC has to make specific

13

findings if it disagrees with the State.

14

Congress gave to the Department of Interior, under

15

section 18, certain powers to dictate to FERC, for

16

example, fish passages.

17

So, Congress -- this reference to cooperative

18

federalism clearly was in Congress's mind, but it

19

wasn't a cooperative federalism in which, on all issues

20

in all proceedings, all the State needed to do is tell

21

FERC what to do.

22

And

Additionally,

FERC has no choice on those.

But they --

about the wording posed in your hypothetical, so I

can't answer the wording.

effectively the States can do precisely that by simply

saying, "We want the river water quality to be like X,

because it's their jurisdiction that's being taken

They're sort of the odd man out,

10

away; and yet we're talking about a Clean Water Act

12

FERC has argued to the courts, on several occasions,

13

that 401 needs to be limited to discharge of

pollutants.

-- if Congress uses the same word throughout the

really means is doing anything to the water is always

-- the --- isn't the answer to your

question that a great number of those usages that you

reasons in the statute -- and we have recognized them

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

1

- to say that when you discharge a pollutant, you are

2

adding something that wasn't there before?

3

the statute, in this case, is using "discharge" without

a reference to "pollutant," it makes perfectly good

5

linguistic sense to construe it just as the Court has

done.

MR. KAYATTA:

But when

Well it makes -- it is

8

linguistically logical to say that we're, therefore,

going to assume that a pollutant is not needed here.

10

But when Congress has replaced the "discharge of a

pollutant" with a "discharge into," it seems to me

12

Congress has actually moved in the other direction of

reinforcing that we're talking about --

those situations.
MR. KAYATTA:

Well, I would -- I would

3

hesitate, Justice Souter, to go from taking a specific

4

word, like "discharge," and, therefore, saying that it

5

meant something that is both more general and much more

6

easily set.

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but your argument, I

8

thought, was simply this, that it uses "discharge" in,

9

you know, X number -- I forget how many you had -- and

10

it's perfectly clear that in most of those instances it

11

requires an addition; and, therefore, it should be

12

construed as requiring it here.

13

great many of those instances, the statute is not

14

merely using the word in isolation; it's using it in

15

connection with a couple of other words, like

16

"discharge a pollutant."

17

one, makes sense to construe "discharge of a pollutant"

differently from "discharge."

the same thing every time it's used.

is, I am including instances not just in which

that the word itself, when you use the word "into,"

naturally suggests

the phrase "discharge into the navigable waters" if

what they really meant was, "If you do anything to the

interpretation here.

MR. KAYATTA:

I -- this logic, I think, would

21

probably include virtually anything you do to the

22

water, because it would separate the water, the water

23

going around the stick.

24

dictionary definition means it's then discharging back

25

into itself on the other side of the stick.

Your Honor, the "pollution," as

defined in the Clean Water Act, is the alteration of

That's the pollution.

11

The reason 401 exists, and the reason

"discharge" is used broadly, and it's the trigger for

the section to work, is because you look at the impacts

of that activity on the environment.

in an impoundment, of sorts, moving the water over.

MR. MINEAR:

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

8

MR. MINEAR:

9

Section 402 uses "discharge"

No, it does not, Your Honor.
Why doesn't it?

Because it uses the term

"discharge of a pollutant," which is --

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

11

MR. MINEAR:

Yes --

-- which is defined, under the

12

Clean Water Act, as a statutory term of art, to mean

13

the addition of a pollution -- of a pollutant from a

14

point source.

15

interprets or defines "discharge" to include the

16

"discharge of a pollutant."

17

term "discharge" is broader than the term "discharge of

18

a pollutant," and does not include the requirement of

19

an addition.

20

On the other hand, the Clean Water Act

So, it's clear that the

But

body to another is not a discharge of a pollutant,

2

which is what we said in Miccosukee, the only basis for

3

saying that is that there has been no discharge.

4

There's obviously been an addition of a pollutant to

5

the -- to the other body of water.

6

can say is, there hasn't been a discharge.

7

because it's the same body of water.

8

MR. MINEAR:

The only thing you
It's --

I respectfully disagree, Your

9

Honor, because, in Miccosukee, it addressed the

10

specific question of whether or not there is an

11

addition.

12

what it was talking about, in that instance, was taking

13

a ladle of soup, removing it from the pot, and adding

14

it back.

15

a discharge, it's a flowing or issuing out.

16

an addition, because nothing is being added to the

17

soup.

18

And, in the much-quoted soup-ladle example,

The pouring back of the soup into the pot is
It's not

Now, in this case, we're using the term

19

"discharge," not "addition."

20

a flowing or issuing out from the dam.

21

and observes a dam, and sees the water leaving the dam,

22

will say that's a "discharge."

10

JUSTICE SOUTER:

11

MR. MINEAR:

Yes.

But I think, Justice Souter, you

12

are right in focusing on the exiting from the dam and

13

why discharges are important here.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

If, in Miccosukee, liquid of

15

the same composition had been taken from another body

16

of water, and from -- not the body of water that was

17

adjacent and which we held was the same body of water

18

- with the same composition, and that had been added,

19

do you think Miccosukee would have come out the same

20

way?

21
22
23

MR. MINEAR:

Yes, I think it would have come

out the same way.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Really?

That you could take

24

pollutants from a different body of water and add it to

25

an already polluted stream?

I thought that was clear

discusses this issue.

One of the issues there is, Are

JUSTICE SCALIA:

7

MR. MINEAR:

Exactly.

And the Court -- that question

8

was left unresolved in Miccosukee.

9

tried in Florida right now.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's what's being

Because if it was one body

11

of water, it was okay, and if it was two bodies of

12

water, it was bad, right?

13

MR. MINEAR:

Yes, but in -- at page 109, what

14

this Court said -- it talked about the S-9 pump, which

15

was central there, because it was moving the body --

16

that the -- the water.

17

was -- talked about pumping the water from one part of

18

the water body to the other. That's a discharge, even

19

though it's the same water body.

20

It was transmitting it.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And it

But it would add pollutants

21

to the other body whether it comes from the adjacent

body or whether it comes from some distant body.

23

only reason that the pumping from the adjacent body did

not qualify is -- not because there no addition of

25

pollutants.

I'd like to point out that one of the things

3

that's been talked about here is the oddity, supposed

oddity, of a water discharging into itself.

5

not odd at all.

6

the fresh water above the dam being discharged into the

7

fresh waters below.

8

about this, because we're talking about the

9

characteristic of a water that might be shared by the

10

water that's upstream and contained in the dam and is

11

also a characteristic of the water below.

12

section 401, the upstream characteristic doesn't

13

matter, because it's -- it refers to "any discharge,"

14

and it says "into the navigable waters."

15

significant, because "any discharge" is "out of

16

something."

17

And by stating "into navigable waters", Congress

18

indicated what it was concerned about, which was that

19

discharges that go into the navigable waters can cause

20

pollution, and, therefore, ought to be reviewed by the

21

State to make sure the water quality standards are

22

being met.

23

And that's

simply indicates that Congress was not concerned about

or would not, have wanted, in effect, to incorporate

7

all State water quality standards into a permission to

8

build a dam?

9

MR. MINEAR:

The reason why, it was because

10

Congress gave the States primary authority under the

11

Clean Water Act to deal with pollution.
