ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEANNE E. MAYNARD

7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

We'll now hear argument,

MS. MAYNARD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

The Federal Tort Claims Act waives the sovereign

11

immunity of the United States for the torts of Federal

12

employees when private persons in like circumstances would

13

be liable.

14

principles of liability, the Ninth Circuit looked to the

15

State and governmental-entity principles of liability.

16

concluded that the United States could be liable here,

17

because Arizona has decided to hold its governmental

18

entities liable when State employees are negligent.

But instead of applying private-person

It

19

That decision is wrong, for two reasons.

20

it is contrary to the plain text of the Federal Tort

21

Claims Act.

22

the liability of the United States is to be judged by the

23

principles of private-person liability in the place where

24

the tort occurred.

25

Tort Claims Act allows jurisdiction and waives the

First,

The Federal Tort Claims Act makes clear that

In section 1346(b)(1), the Federal

3
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

sovereign immunity of the United States under

2

circumstances where the United States, if a private

3

person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with

4

the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Do I understand that you would

6

accept the rule that if Arizona held a private inspector

7

liable to third persons for their injuries, then the

8

Government of the United States would be liable?

9

quite the Good Samaritan -- not quite the Good Samaritan

10

type, but you would accept that as the proper measure of

11

your liability in a case like this?

12
13

MS. MAYNARD:

It's not

As long as Arizona applied that

principle of liability to private persons in Arizona.

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

15

MS. MAYNARD:

Yes.

Yes, Justice Kennedy.

So, it will

16

depend on what the particular State's law is.

17

only private-person law that was argued below was the Good

18

Samaritan doctrine, and -- as a possible analogy to the

19

conduct of the mine inspectors here.

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Here, the

But it might -

It gets ahead of the argument

21

just a little bit, but you had a footnote about police

22

officers.

23

the analog there that we look to -- what the duties of a

24

private security guard would be -- what do you do with

25

those cases?

You have a park ranger, Federal employer.

1

MS. MAYNARD:

Well, those cases, as we note, do

2

present, often, special circumstances not present in this

3

case, Justice Kennedy.

4

that's presented here is the same.

5

to whether or not there is private -- a private-person

6

analog.

7

liability of private persons in that circumstance.

8
9

But the answer to the question
You still would look

And, if there is, then you would look to the

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So, even with the police

officer, I have to find a private analog.

10

MS. MAYNARD:

Yes, you do.

For example, if

11

someone brought a trespass action against a Federal law

12

enforcement officer for entering upon their land, you

13

would apply the same State law as it relates to trespass

14

claims against private persons.

15

example, have a defense of lawful authority to enter.

16

When looking at whether or not a police officer had -- a

17

Federal officer had lawful authority to enter, one might

18

then look to Federal law to determine whether or not the

19

officer had authority to enter, but you would still be

20

applying the principles of private-person liability.

21

Those claims may, for

If one concluded that there was no private-

22

person analog, then the only answer under the Federal Tort

23

Claims Act would be that the United States cannot be

24

liable.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I mean, that's

5
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

kind of a $64,000 question here.

2

you think there's no private-person analog.

3

MS. MAYNARD:

Give me an example where

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, we think

4

it's often rare that there is no private-person analog,

5

given this Court's decision in Indian Towing, which

6

stresses -

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

8

MS. MAYNARD:

9

Right.

-- that one should look to a

private person in like circumstances.

I think this Court,

10

in Feres, although that decision has been -- has been

11

limited -- did determine that there was, in that

12

situation, no private-party analog -

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Isn't there always a

14

private -- I mean, we're talking about tort law -- isn't

15

there always a private analog, which is, you know,

16

exercising reasonable care under the circumstances toward

17

people to whom you owe some duty, and you just apply that

18

general principle?

19

MS. MAYNARD:

To the extent you're suggesting

20

that we just look to general theories of tort law, I think

21

that would be incorrect.

22

Act -- the language of the Tort Claims Act makes the

23

United States liable only where a private party in like

24

circumstances would be liable.

25

Court defines "in like circumstances" as looking to the

The -- because the Tort Claims

And in Indian Towing, this

Alderson Reporting Company

1

same character of conduct of the -- of the person.

2

you would have to find a private person who's engaged in

3

the same character of conduct, and then ask the question,

4

What principles of liability does the State apply to those

5

persons?

6

So,

Here, the CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, all right, so if

7

it's a police officer stopping somebody on a highway, it's

8

the same as a private security guard stopping somebody at

9

a -- you know, the driveway at a plant or something.

10

MS. MAYNARD:

That may be the closest private-

11

person analog.

12

to apply the defense, it's just as one would if talking

13

about a private security guard.

14

questions whether the guard had the requisite authority.

15

And the State would look to what that guard's authority

In that situation, however, when one goes

One would ask the

16

was.

17

to be a Federal officer, would look to Federal law.

18

that can be appropriate, I think, for -- under,

19

potentially, three different -- for, potentially, three

20

different reasons.

21

2680(a), which provides the United States with a defense

22

to liability in circumstances where , with due care, you're

23

carrying out a Federal statute or regulation.

24

another source of authority might be the State-law

25

principles simply look to what the authority of the person

And often States would look -- if the guard happened
And

One, the language of the defense in

1

doing the conduct is, and then you would look to Federal

2

law for the source of that authority.

3

right, under this Court's suggestion in Muniz, that

4

Federal regulations -- once an actionable duty is

5

established under State tort principles, one can look to

6

Federal regulations to determine whether or not -- what

7

the applicable standard of -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

MS. MAYNARD:

10
11

And that could be

Can you back -

-- care was.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

-- up in Muniz a little bit?

Because that was a prison administration.

12

is the private-party analog to that?

13

MS. MAYNARD:

And so, what

I think this Court suggested, in

14

Muniz, that perhaps there could be private persons

15

operating prisons, or one would look -

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

17

MS. MAYNARD:

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I don't recall -

-- in that -- that in the decision.

The

19

phrase from the Tort Claims Act about "as a private party"

20

was repeated, but I don't remember any discussion of what

21

that private party would be, in Muniz.

22

MS. MAYNARD:

You may be right, Justice

23

Ginsburg.

24

Muniz is that the Court stressed that, whatever the

25

measure of the United States' liability would be for the

I think the important point to take away from

8
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

claims at issue in that case, it could not be the State

2

law as it related to governmental entities; that one would

3

have to, as the text requires, look to State law as it

4

relates to private persons.

5
6
7

The point that I -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Because in those days the

Government was arguing it should be like State officials.
MS. MAYNARD:

For purposes of obtaining

8

immunity, we were arguing that -- which I think is a

9

different argument than we're making here today -- we were

10

arguing that the Federal Tort Claims Act was not meant to

11

waive our sovereign immunity at all with respect to

12

certain types of governmental activities.

13

the argument that we're making today.

14

arguing simply that one must, as the Court held in Indian

15

Towing and Rayonier, one should look to the -- to the --

16

to the text of the statute, and that that must be the

17

measure of our liability.

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But that's not

Today, we are

May I ask you, what would you

19

do if Arizona had a statute that said that any company

20

that contracts privately to do mine inspections must obey

21

the standards in the Federal guidelines?

22

standard be?

23
24
25

MS. MAYNARD:

What would the

That presents a difficult

question, Justice Stevens, as I'm sure you know.
[Laughter.]

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

MS. MAYNARD:

And that would, obviously, be a

2

harder case than the one that we have here, and -- which I

3

would like to -

4

JUSTICE STEVENS:

5

MS. MAYNARD:

6

JUSTICE STEVENS:

7

But you say -

-- address how you apply it here.
-- and I think you're probably

right --

8

MS. MAYNARD:

9

JUSTICE STEVENS:

If -- that you can't just make a

10

Federal -- implied Federal cause of action under the

11

Federal standards, from what we know.

12

wondering, What if the Arizona statute said that's what

13

the private firm should do?

14

MS. MAYNARD:

But then I was

If a State statute looked to

15

Federal law as the source -- I think one has to be careful

16

when one talks about "negligence per se" type principles,

17

which is what you're suggesting -- some States look to

18

statutes and regulations solely to establish a standard of

19

care once a separate duty has been established.

20

States, as respondents claim Arizona does, look to it

21

establish both duty and a standard of care.

22

And some

But, putting that aside, if -- to respond

23

directly to your question -- if a State adopted a Federal

24

statute and used it to apply to private persons, you would

25

be most of the way home in getting Federal Tort Claims Act

10
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

-- at least the creation of potential liability against

2

the United States.

3

there would still be a question as to the intent of

4

Congress, in the Federal statute itself that was used, as

5

to whether Congress intended to foreclose any private

6

action, any private enforcement, such that the States --

7

if the State has misinterpreted, in other words, a Federal

8

law, that presents, I think, a Federal question.

9

However, I think in that instance,

JUSTICE STEVENS:

No, I'm assuming they just did

10

it independently.

11

private mine inspectors, and let's just adopt the -- a

12

standard that shall, in all respects, be the same as the

13

Federal standard."

14

They said, "We want a regulation on the

MS. MAYNARD:

If they're just simply borrowing

15

it, and don't feel compelled to borrow it, and are,

16

indeed, applying it to private persons who perform safety

17

inspections, then the United States could potentially be

18

liable under the Federal Tort Claims Act.

19

here, though, that is definitely not this case, because -

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

As I mentioned

Well, but it seems to me that

21

that's quite a foreseeable possibility.

22

a thing as private safety inspectors in Arizona -- I'm not

23

sure, but if there are, I assume that what they do is,

24

when they go into a particular industrial area, they look

25

at the safety standards for that industry, including

If there is such

Federal and State regulations.

2

inspector, then it seems to me that his liability might

3

very well be measured by whether or not he's inspected the

4

mine in accordance to Federal safety standards.

5

MS. MAYNARD:

So, if you have a mine

Well, I have several answers to

6

that question, Justice Kennedy.

7

"standards" there appears not to be one to create an

8

actual duty in the first instance, which is really the

9

question before this Court.

10
11

First, your use of

Is there any duty between the

United States and the private miners?
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Secondly -

Well, but I thought we said,

12

at the outset -- and correct me if I'm wrong -- if Arizona

13

imposes liability on private safety inspectors for

14

injuries to third persons, then the United States would be

15

liable here.

16
17

MS. MAYNARD:

Oh, I'm sorry.

I didn't realize

you were still operating -

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

19

MS. MAYNARD:

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

21

MS. MAYNARD:

That was the -

-- under Justice -- hypothetical.

-- Stevens' hypothetical.

If

22

Arizona has created an actionable tort duty that it

23

imposed -- that it's willing to impose upon its private

24

citizens who perform safety inspections, to all persons

25

who work at places where they perform safety inspections,

12
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

that would be a different case.

2

applying the law as it relates to private persons in like

3

circumstances.

4

Then that would be

Here, though, it's clear from the cases we

5

discuss in our brief, including Easter and Papastathis,

6

that Arizona -- when private parties perform safety

7

inspections on the property of another, Arizona applies

8

its Good Samaritan doctrine.

9

determine, at the outset, whether there's any actionable

That is not -- in order to

10

duty between the inspectors and the injured party.

11

the step that the Ninth Circuit did not engage in here.

12

The Ninth Circuit, instead, decided --

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

14

MS. MAYNARD:

That's

I understand.

Okay.

So, the -- and the reason

15

that you can't, in this case, follow Justice Stevens'

16

reasoning is because the only provisions of law to which

17

the respondents point to set the negligence per se

18

principles are policy manuals and procedures of the coal

19

-- Federal Mine Act that apply only to Federal employees.

20

So, they point to no case or law where these provisions,

21

upon which they rely, would impose either a duty or a

22

standard of care upon private persons in Arizona.

23

in that -- to distinguish it -- I'm sorry.

24
25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Now,

In your view -- even though

the Federal standard would not be controlling, in your

13
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

view, if you applied a general reasonable-person test,

2

would the Federal standards be admissible so that the

3

plaintiff could argue that there was a failure here which

4

is evidence of negligence?

5

MS. MAYNARD:

In many States, one would look to

6

Federal standards for setting the standard of care.

7

we think that it could be relevant here what the -- but

8

you must get over the duty hurdle.

9

cannot do by looking to State and governmental-entity

10

And

And that, respondents

liability.

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

12

relevant, are you thinking of 2680(a)?

13

says, you know, if you exercise due care, any act that you

14

take in the -- in -- well, let's use the exact language --

15

"any act or omission in the execution of a statute or

16

regulation will not be a ground of liability," with -- at

17

least leaving open the door that any failure to take steps

18

that would have been reasonable in executing it might be.

19
20
21

When you say that it may be
Because 2680(a)

Is that why you answered Justice Stevens as you did?
MS. MAYNARD:

Well, just to take your question,

10

MS. MAYNARD:

Okay.
Give me an example of the -- of

When would there be liability,

Well, I think -- obviously, you

11

don't get to 2680(a) unless you've gotten through the

12

first part and established -

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

14

MS. MAYNARD:

Right.

-- that there's some actionable

15

duty on private persons in like circumstances and that we

16

might be liable.

17

for example, the State standard of care with -- in

18

relation to private parties is higher than that required

19

by Federal statute -- imagine a Federal regulation that

20

requires VA doctors to -

If you do get over that hurdle -- say,

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

22

MS. MAYNARD:

23
24
25

Oh, I could -- I could --

-- take care of their patients

once a day.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

-- I could understand that if

they -- it would be an easier question for me if the

15
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

statute said, "Even if you violate the statute, if you

2

otherwise use reasonable care, no liability."

3

it talks about reasonable care when you are -- when you

4

are, in the statutory phrase, in the execution of the

5

statute, which suggests to me you're not violating the

6

statute, you're not violating any standard.

7

function does it serve?

8
9

MS. MAYNARD:

But here,

So, what

Well, it can serve functions in

other instances; for example, if someone alleges that you

10

were following the statute, but the statute was invalid.

11

But I think in terms of a -- because it goes on to say

12

whether or not the -- the regulation -

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

14

MS. MAYNARD:

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

16
17

So, it's really -

-- is valid.
-- the validity is the -- is

the nub of the provision.
MS. MAYNARD:

No, Your Honor.

I was just saying

18

it has that other function.

19

answer to your question is, if this -- if, when you're

20

talking about the -- what's an appropriate standard of

21

care once one's established an actionable duty -- if the

22

State law, as it relates to private persons, set a more

23

stringent standard of care than the Federal regulation,

24

for example, and the Federal employee were complying with

25

the standard of care set forth in the Federal regulation

JUSTICE SOUTER:

MS. MAYNARD:

Of the Federal -- I -- okay.

-- this could potentially provide

4

a defense, even though, once you went through the first

5

part of the statute -

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I really don't understand the

7

-- are you sure that a failure to execute a statute does

8

not come within the language, "an act or omission," in the

9

execution of a statute?

10

I would think a total failure

to execute is an omission in the execution of the statute.

11

MS. MAYNARD:

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I'm not sure I You mean if you executed 90

13

percent and omit 10 percent of what you're supposed to do,

14

it comes within that language, but if you don't execute at

15

all, it doesn't?

16

it seems to me --

17
18

That seems to me most unlikely.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I mean

She's saying "execution" is not

synonymous with "performance," which may well be correct.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes. Well, you -

20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I had assumed that -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- you accepted, it seemed to

me, the premise of -

Yes.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There was an argument that

5

was made in your brief, and I didn't fully grasp the

6

thrust of it, in the -- that is, you said that the Mine

7

Safety and Health Administration has a duty to the

8

Secretary of Labor, but not to the mine operator and not

9

to the miner.

If that were true, then would there be --

10

you wouldn't even get to the Good Samaritan doctrine,

11

would you, if the only duty is to the Secretary of Labor?

12

MS. MAYNARD:

Well, I think that, in fact, would

13

be an application of the Good Samaritan doctrine, Justice

14

Ginsburg.

15

first part of the -- we have an -- we believe we have an

16

argument.

17

whether -- I think this is an open question in Arizona law

18

under their interpretation of the Good Samaritan doctrine

19

-- whether someone in the position of the United States

20

here is -- has undertaken to render services to another.

21

Because that's the argument to which you're referring, I

22

believe.

not rendering services to another.

2

take into account whether someone will have a duty,

pursuant to the Good Samaritan doctrine -- one of the

4

factors is that you must have undertaken to render

services to another.

also relevant here, is whether or not the injured party

justifiably and detrimentally relied.

8

-- you know, they have asked you to decide this question

remand, but the United States does not believe that the

11

respondents can make out either of those elements of the

12

Good Samaritan doctrine, and that the United States,

13

therefore, cannot ultimately be liable only -- under the

14

only available private-person analogy.

15
16

But the important point is, you -- that is an
application of the Good Samaritan doctrine.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You're not sure that the

18

Good Samaritan doctrine is the -- is necessarily what the

19

Arizona law would be -- what the analog would be.

20

MS. MAYNARD:

In our view, it's the only

21

private-person law that respondents argued to the Ninth

22

Circuit.

23

this court contending that governmental-entity law and

24

private-party law in Arizona is equivalent in this

25

situation.

Respondents have submitted a new argument to

But that is wrong.

It is clear that the State

20
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

of Arizona, as a public-policy matter, has decided to

2

create broader, actionable tort duties on its own

3

governmental employees, and to expose itself and open its

4

own coffers to -- when -- to claims when its employees

5

have injured its citizens.

6

that they apply to private persons, and we know that from

7

the Daggett case, which we discuss -- I believe it's on

8

page 6 of our reply brief.

9

But that is not the same law

In the Daggett case, that was a case involving

10

an inspection by a county of a swimming recreation area,

11

pursuant to mandatory State and county regulations that

12

required such inspections.

13

there held that there was a duty by the county to a person

14

who had -- who dove into the swimming pool and was injured

15

as a result of hitting the bottom, that there was an

16

actionable duty running against the county there as a

17

matter of the State of Arizona's decision to create tort

18

duties when its employees and governmental entities violate

19

mandatory obligations or perform them negligently.

We think it's perfectly clear, from the text of the

statute and the language of the Ninth Circuit's decision,

that what they did is improper.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But I'm just wondering if

5

you're not discussing a State-law issue that has not been

7

MS. MAYNARD:

Well, it has not -- the -- whether

12

JUSTICE STEVENS:

13

MS. MAYNARD:

Right.

And, therefore, it was not

16

respondent -- the only thing respondents point to here to

17

assert that there is an equivalent are cases making State

to nothing, as they concede, cases involving private

We do not think -- it is a question of State

The Daggett court went on to decide that the
county, although it had a duty to the injured party

pursuant to governmental entity law, similar to what the

11

Ninth Circuit applied to us here, there would be no

12

actionable duty if one applied the Good Samaritan

doctrine.

raised the question as to whether or not someone in the

position of the county would even be rendering services

I'd like to begin by addressing the last point

16

made by the Office of the Solicitor General, which is the

17

Daggett case.

18

this is a State law issue.

19

as the Solicitor General maintains, that under Arizona law

20

there would be no duty under the restatement sections 323

21

or 324.

22

case because they found a duty under the county

23

regulations, is, "We assume, without deciding, that there

24

is a claim under 324 and -- 323 and 324, and note simply

25

that there are no allegations in the plaintiff's complaint

And I address that merely to highlight that
It -- the Daggett case did not hold,

In fact, what the Court says in remanding the

24
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

that would satisfy those issues."

2

because there's additional litigation coming, they were

3

giving heads up to the party that he needs to amend the

4

complain to assert the Good Samaritan elements.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So, they simply say,

May I ask you a question that

6

Justice Kennedy just brought up?

7

Olson collect, under the State workers' compensation

8

statute, from the mine operators?

9

MR. COTTER:

Did this -- did Mr.

Your Honor, Mr. Olson did collect,

10

under the State workers' compensation statute, from the

11

mine operator, that is correct, as did Mr. Vargas.

12

in fact, the State of Arizona was sued -- the State mine

13

inspector -- alleging that they were negligent, and that

14

case was resolved.

15

case is that in that case, the State -- because Arizona is

16

a pure comparative-negligence State -- alleged that the

17

Federal mine inspector was partially at fault and that,

18

therefore, Mr. Olson and Mr. Vargas' damages should be

19

reduced, just as, in our case, if we had proceeded beyond

20

the motion-to-dismiss phase, we could have anticipated, as

21

is common, that the Federal Government would have

22

identified the State of Arizona and the mine operator to

23

be non-parties at fault, as well, so that those

24

individuals -- the negligence of those individuals would

25

reduce the plaintiff's damages against the Federal

And,

That -- a point of interest in that

Government.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But the -- but the mine

3

operator -- the Compensation Act is the exclusive remedy

4

under Arizona law, so the -- nobody could get anything

5

more from the mine operator.

6

MR. COTTER:

Is that so?

That is correct.

In the interest

7

of candor, I have to tell Your Honor that we sued the

8

parent company to the mine operator, which is Grupo

9

Mexico, in an attempt to assert a claim, and that case was

10

resolved only by some -- by making some concessions on the

11

workers' compensation lien issues that the workers'

12

compensation carrier had back against the claimants for

13

their recovery from the State of Arizona.

14

I hope that's clear.

But, generally, workers'

15

compensation carriers have a right to get repaid if

16

there's some private settlement, and concessions were made

17

on that right, because of the -- suing the parent company,

18

and that case was never resolved on the merits.

19

To begin, Your Honor, this came to the Ninth

20

Circuit from a motion to dismiss.

21

significance to this -- to this question, because the

22

plaintiffs were not able to develop the factual record

23

which goes to the issues of whether or not there would be

24

liability under the State law -- the Good Samaritan law or

25

under -- issues about assumption of duty under State law.

8
9

Well, that goes to the remand

MR. COTTER:

Well, in a roundabout way, it does,

Justice Scalia, because what happened was, the Ninth

10

Circuit was faced with the task, under the Federal Tort

11

Claim Act, of deciding whether -- if the Federal

12

Government -- the Federal mine inspectors, if you would --

13

were private people under like circumstances, would they

14

be liable?

15

hypothetical question by the Federal Tort Claim, and it

16

was asked to resolve that question on a motion to dismiss

17

for failure to state a claim, which the standard is, of

18

course, that we can set -- we can prove no facts which

19

would -- which would establish a cause of action.

20

what the court really did, because the court applied a

21

body of law -- the Ninth Circuit -- that began with the

22

Louie doctrine -- is, the court looked at Arizona mine-

23

inspector law as a predictor to what Arizona private-

24

person law would be.

25

So, the Ninth Circuit was essentially asked a

the State of Arizona, had waived sovereign immunity.

-- you might have won if they had said, "We're going to

look to see what the law is in Arizona governing a private

guess.

12

the law governing private persons, we are just looking at

law governing municipalities, and they're -- it seems to

14

me they are pretty clearly wrong about that, unless you

15

give me a reason why they're right.

16

MR. COTTER:

Well, Your Honor, what -- our

17

position is that, although they applied the law of

18

municipalities and the State, what they were really doing

19

is applying the Louie doctrine, which says that when you

20

cannot identify a private actor, then the best evidence of

21

what the State's law is, with respect to the actions of a

22

party in the same circumstances, is to look at the State

23

liability, and that -

24
25

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's a good question.

Suppose you really had a person who -- there's just no

thought -

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. COTTER:

Maybe there are not -

If the private mine inspector had

13

the -- assumed the same duties, so it's under like

14

circumstances, that the Federal mine inspector had here,

15

which was to inspect the mine in its entirety four times

16

per year and to respond to all safety-related complaints

17

and determine whether they present imminent hazards, and

18

to remove the miners from the area -- if those are the

19

characteristics of the private individual under like

20

circumstances, then I concede that would be a better

21

predictor of State -- and if we knew what Arizona would

22

decide in that context, I -

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Cotter, I don't -- I don't

24

see, in the opinion, any indication that the Ninth Circuit

was doing what you -- what you assert it was trying to do

-- namely, to predict what future California law -- locked

2

deep in the bosom of the California Supreme Court, but not

3

4

proceed that way at all.

5

States can be held liable only when liability was attached

6

to a private actor.

8

performance of some activities that private persons do not

However, the United States may be liable,

under the law where the activity occurred.

11

saying, "We are trying to predict what California would do

12

in a private situation."

13

where there's no cause of action against a private person,

14

we look to whether there would be a cause of action under

15

-- against a State or subdivision of the State.

16

MR. COTTER:

I don't see they are

They have set forth a rule that,

operator who -- a law enforcement official who failed to

23

stop a drunk driver, and they said, "There is" -- the

Government said, "There is no private person here."

And, in fact, I think that that remains the

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, but Louie, according to

4

the SG, says, "We say here that this person is not liable

5

-- the Government is not liable, because, in Washington,

6

Washington would not make a municipality liable," while

7

adding that the law of Washington is that a municipality

8

is liable only if a private person in Washington is

9

liable.

So, I wouldn't think Louie is very good authority

10

that the Ninth Circuit thought it was for the proposition

only the municipality.

1

contention is that the genesis of the doctrine that they

2

applied, and that the Fifth Circuit applies, and that the

3

D.C. circuit applies, is to predict State law, that its

4

purpose is not to expand liability where State law doesn't

5

exist.

6

Circuit in this case, it acknowledges that private person

7

is the test.

8

private person, this is what we do.

9

State law.

In fact, if you read the opinion of the Ninth

But then it says that when we cannot find a
We go look to the

And the Crider case says, basically, that when

10

you do that -- from the Fifth Circuit -- what you're doing

11

is looking at the legal principles that are -- you're

12

looking at a factual situation that best articulates the

13

State-law legal principles -

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But, doesn't that

15

approach -- it doesn't make any sense, because you're only

16

looking at half of the equation.

17

a special set of principles for governmental actors, they

18

include immunities and defenses and all that.

19

just want the benefit of the liability, but you don't

20

want, I take it, the immunities and defenses that go along

21

with it.

22

MR. COTTER:

Presumably, if you have

And you

Well, that issue was actually

23

raised in the Henzel case, in the D.C. circuit, where the

24

-- there was a high-speed chase and the officer caused a

25

collision, and what happened was, the Government argued

34
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

that you can't apply the standard applicable defined duty

2

of the Government, but you can apply the Government -- or

3

the D.C. regulations as to standard of care.

4

Circuit found, no, it would follow Louie and Crider, and

5

say that the best predictor of the State law, when you

6

can't find an analogous private person, is the liability

7

statutes that concern the law enforcement, but, following

8

Indian Towing, it would not apply the gross-negligence

9

standard that the D.C. Circuit had adopted that concerned

10

And the D.C.

the officers.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's actually a rather

12

interesting question I don't really know the answer to.

13

The idea is that you can't find an analogous private

14

person.

15

could say -- you -- there always is an analogous private

16

person.

17

We might have to write something about that.

It's impossible to think of an example.
The other extreme, you have the Ninth Circuit,

18

which could -- which says as long as the Government was

19

involved in regulation, there is no analogous private

20

person, because private people don't regulate.

21

think that was almost certainly wrong.

22

I would

But what is the right way to go about it?

23

there such people, or aren't there?

24

MR. COTTER:

25

You

Are

Well, Your Honor, what I would say

in this case is, the absolute wrong way to go about it is

35
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

on a motion to dismiss, because, unfortunately, the record

2

wasn't developed, which may, in fact, speak to issues that

3

may, in fact, address Arizona law on Good Samaritan, for

4

instance -- the issue of whether, under Arizona law, a

5

duty was assumed, the issue of whether reliance exists.

6
7
8
9
10

And I have to correct the Solicitor General.
The reliance does not merely come from the injured party.
The restatement section, section three- -- or the
restatement section 324 says reliance is from the other
for the injured party.

11

So, in this case -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, doesn't that make

12

it a contract case?

13

who's contracted with, say, a private inspector -- I mean,

14

I have a contract, somebody comes and inspects the house

15

for termites, and I assume, if they don't do a good job

16

and the house is damaged, they're liable.

17

under contract, and this is a question of tort liability.

18

If you're talking about the party

MR. COTTER:

But that's

Well, if I may answer with a

19

hypothetical, Your Honor, because we did not get to

20

develop the record, what happened in this case is, the

21

mine method changed.

They went from taking the floor to

22

the taking the back.

And they ripped out the ground

23

support.

24
25

So, people were working under unsupported ground.

We, because there was a motion to dismiss, never got the
opportunity to take the mine operator and said, "Why on

36

"Why on Earth did" What was your response to the

MR. COTTER:

in this situation.

MR. COTTER:

Okay.

What was your response?

Our response was that the law --

22

first, our response was that, under the motion to dismiss,

23

our factual allegations in the complaint have to be

24

accepted, and we alleged all the elements of the Good

25

Samaritan doctrine, and all the elements of the uniquely

37

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You said that?

You said that,

"And we have a -- we have asserted all the elements of

4

Good Samaritan"?

5

MR. COTTER:

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

7

MR. COTTER:

Yes.
Okay.

And what happened was, frankly,

8

Judge Browning dismissed, relying, I think, on the -- more

9

on the discretionary function exception, and then the

10

Myers case, out of the Sixth Circuit, saying, as a matter

11

of law, this -- as a matter of Federal law, MSHA is not an

12

assumption of duty by the Government.

13

whether this Court is inclined to address that issue or

14

not, but I'd just like to point out on that issue, the

15

Federal Tort Claim Act makes the issue of whether the

16

Government's liable a question of State law.

17

is, as we have conceded, whether the mine inspector would

18

be liable if he were a private person, and -- which I

19

think goes to the prior question about, "What if there is

20

no" -

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And I don't know

The question

But we can remand for that.

22

What's here is, the Ninth Circuit held that there's

23

liability based on what the liability of a State agent

24

would be, and that's just not the rule.

25

MR. COTTER:

Well, Your Honor, if the Court is

So, we have to give some

instructions as to how the -- as to whether or not the

Ninth Circuit is right about that.

MR. COTTER:

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

7

MR. COTTER:

If the Court And that's why you're here.

-- if the Court is convinced that

8

what the Ninth Circuit did was not try to predict what

9

private law would -- that -- what private law in Arizona

10

would be, if the Federal mine inspector was a private

11

citizen, then we would concede that that's not the law.

12

But we believe that is what the Ninth Circuit did

13

following those cases -- the Louie case, the Crider case,

14

and all of the cases that were -

15

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

See, that's exactly what's

concerning me, and I don't quite see my way to an answer.
Suppose we do send it back because we think just what you

said wasn't so is so, they have to now into this.

MR. COTTER:

Your Honor, if you do decide to

2

remand -- which if the issue of the Good Samaritan

3

doctrine or assumption of duty under Arizona law is going

4

to be addressed, we recommend that there is a remand -- we

5

would urge the Court, as a matter of first -- the first

6

rule is to instruct the Ninth Circuit that these are badly

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, that's not -- that's not

what I've been asking.

14

MR. COTTER:

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

And And to expose everything I was

16

-- perhaps the better thing is to say, "There's always a

17

private analogy," or try very hard, because if you really

18

found an instance there was no private analogy to, maybe

19

there would be no recovery, because the statute simply

20

speaks about private party.

21

MR. COTTER:

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

23

With all due respect, Your Honor And this is a statute designed

to give people recovery -

MR. COTTER:

It's a -- it's a statute where --

with a broad waiver intended.

3

-- if the rule were "If there's no private analogy,

4

there's no recovery," it sort of reverses the statute.

But I actually think if the

It does.

Yes, it does, but that --

would we end up there, because of the way the statute's

You avoid the whole matter if you say, "Look for

And maybe

I concede that point, Your Honor.
Okay, who's your -- what's your

best analog?

MR. COTTER:

My best analogy here is a private

But

this would be inspector liability.
MR. COTTER:

Well, in the restatement, section

12

324, under "Assumption of a Duty," gives an example.

13

the example is, if a private company hires a scaffolding

14

inspector, and the scaffolding inspector does a negligent

15

inspection, and a worker falls and is injured, the worker

16

has a claim against the scaffolding inspector.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And

And then,

Well, but only --

presumably, only if they meet the requirements of the Good

21

MR. COTTER:

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I believe Which -- they would have

23

to show that there was an increase in the risk of harm,

24

which I think it would not be true in your hypothetical,

25

or that there was a duty owed to the third party -- the

43
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

scaffolding inspector is presumably hired by the

2

contractor, not by the employees -- or there was reliance.

3

MR. COTTER:

I think that that's true, Your

4

Honor, although I'd like to read a quote from Papastathis,

5

which is -- the court relied on.

6

"Numerous cases have held that once a party gratuitously

7

agrees to inspect and the third party is subsequently

8

injured, that party can be held liable for its negligent

9

inspection."

The quote is just this,

There is a host of Arizona case law on

10

assumed duties.

11

versus State, which is simply a case where a road washes

12

out, and the Government reroutes the road for a -- for a

13

period of time across a private land, and, for a period of

14

time, grades it, and then stops grading it.

15

circumstance, the Government was held liable simply for

16

having, for that period of the time, assumed a duty.

17

there wasn't an analysis in the Martinez case of whether

18

or not the elements of section 324(a) were met or not.

19

And the case I would refer to is Martinez

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And, in that

And

So, we're just debating

20

now whether or not you've satisfied the requirements of

21

the Good Samaritan statute.

22
23
24
25

MR. COTTER:

Or whether there are alternative

theories of liability available under Arizona State law.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Did you argue -- I mean,

you lost in the district court on the Good Samaritan

MR. COTTER:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yes.
On your appeal, did you

argue that that was wrong?
MR. COTTER:

Yes.

And the Ninth Circuit simply

didn't reach that issue.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

8

court went off on discretionary function?

9

MR. COTTER:

But you said the district

It went off primarily under

10

discretionary function, but then in addressing the Arizona

11

-- the Good Samaritan doctrine under Arizona, it relied on

12

the Myers case, which is a case in which -- the Sixth

13

Circuit said that when you have the case -- or safety

14

inspections like the Federal -- like MSHA, that court

15

would adopt a actor, slash, monitor dichotomy so that

16

there could never be an assumption of duty under --

17

because the Government was only in a monitor function.

18

And, to the extent that that's at issue, Your Honor, I

19

would think that that would be a question, under State

20

law, of whether the Government had assumed the duty.

21

if not under State law, it would be a question under the

22

Federal Tort Claim of whether an -- there is an exception

23

that has been met.

24

that this Court, in Berkovitz, said that regulatory

25

conduct can be actionable under the Federal Tort Claim if

question has suggested -- it seems that they think there

But, tellingly, I think, as Justice Breyer

The premise of the court of

Justice Breyer, if there is no private-party

19

analog, if you conclude that this type of regulatory

activity has no private-party analog, the only appropriate

answer under the Federal Tort Claims Act is that the

22

United States cannot be liable.

doctrine affords an -- under this Court's interpretation,

in Indian Towing, of the "like circumstances" doctrine, we

think one could look to the Good Samaritan principles,

4

under which we think we would prevail.

5

If I may, Justice Ginsburg, return -

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Saying that there is no

7

private-party analog is not quite the same thing as saying

you lose under what we consider to be the proper private-

party analog -- namely, Good Samaritan.

MS. MAYNARD:

We believe that once -- I'm not

11

sure I get the vein of your question, but I'll -- the --

12

if there is no private-party analog, so there's no

13

private-person in like circumstances, the United States

14

cannot be held liable.

like circumstances, one then must apply that law to the

facts and the claims and determine whether or not the United
