ORAL ARGUMENT OF JANE N. KIRKLAND

7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

9

MS. KIRKLAND:

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

10

Whether a capital sentencing statute is

11

categorized as "weighing" or "non-weighing" determines how

12

courts assess the impact of an invalid death eligibility

13

factor on a jury's sentence selection.

14

a statute is "weighing" or "non-weighing," we look to the

15

function, if any, of an eligibility factor in the

16

statute's sentence-selection process.

17

To decide whether

In a "weighing" scheme, as this Court first

18

stated in Zant, a jury is specifically instructed to weigh

19

the statutory eligibility factors, along with any

20

mitigation, to choose the sentence.

21

scheme, the eligibility factors have no role above the

22

role of "all other sentencing evidence."

23

In a "non-weighing"

California is a "non-weighing" State, for two

24

primary reasons.

25

"eligibility factors" in California's statutory list of 11

First, the only reference whatsoever to

3
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

open-ended sentencing factors is in its sentencing factor

2

(a), but that reference has no significance, because,

3

under the language of the statute and the holdings of the

4

California Supreme Court, factor (a) means the jury is to

5

consider, if it's relevant, the facts and circumstances of

6

the offenses, including the facts and circumstances that

7

underlie the eligibility factors.

8
9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Isn't the difficulty with that

argument that that, at least, is not the way the jury was

10

instructed in this case?

11

don't have it in front of me, but I looked when I was

12

going through the briefs -- the jury was instructed to

13

consider the special circumstance, or -stances, as such.

14

They were not instructed that, "You will simply consider

15

the facts that underlay whatever conclusion you drew at

16

the -- at the earliest stage about special circumstances."

17
18

As I understand it, the -- and I

They are instructed to consider special circumstances.
MS. KIRKLAND:

They're instructed in the

19

language of the statute.

20

(a), there is a reference to those special circumstances.

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

22

MS. KIRKLAND:

23

JUSTICE SOUTER:

24
25

And in that sentencing factor

As such.

I mean --

So that --- it calls them special

circumstances, right?
MS. KIRKLAND:

Correct.

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

JUSTICE SOUTER:

2

MS. KIRKLAND:

Yes.
But it's not reasonably likely

3

that the jury would have understood that to mean that they

4

should accord any special weight to the title of special

5

circumstances, apart from the overall umbrella of the --

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

7

MS. KIRKLAND:

8

JUSTICE SOUTER:

9

Well --- special circumstances that --- well, that may be an

argument for the way we have looked at special

10

circumstances, is as something -- as factors that do carry

11

a special weight, but I don't see any reason to

12

differentiate the instruction to consider special

13

circumstances here from the instructions in law to

14

consider eligibility factors in other States, which we

15

have called "weighing" States.

16

MS. KIRKLAND:

Well, in "weighing" States, the

17

eligibility factors form the primary aggravation for the

18

jury to consider at sentencing.

19

reference to the eligibility factors is that one subpart

20

of one of otherwise completely distinguished from

21

eligibility factors --

22

JUSTICE SOUTER:

23

MS. KIRKLAND:

24

JUSTICE SOUTER:

25

In California, the

Well, I --- sentencing factors --- I know what you're saying,

because, in California, you've got a long list of other

5
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

things, and you're entirely right.

2

it, in the States that we have classified as "weighing"

3

States, the juries were not -- were not strictly limited,

4

on the aggravating side, to consider only the special

5

circumstances or the aggravating factors, as they have

6

been previously defined; they could consider other things.

7

And that's the case here.

But, as I understand

So, I don't see how we can

8

draw a categorical distinction between California's

9

situation and that of States we've called "weighing"

10

States.

11

MS. KIRKLAND:

There's two differences between

12

that.

13

Mississippi and Florida, for example -- the eligibility or

14

aggravating factors are -- are the sole aggravation at

15

sentencing, and --

In any of those "weighing" States -- well, in

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

17

MS. KIRKLAND:

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

19
20

I thought in --- that's really --- I thought in Mississippi

they could take into consideration other facts.
MS. KIRKLAND:

Well, they couldn't at the time

21

of Clemons and Stringer.

22

the 1990s, as is discussed in our brief, they --

23

Mississippi changed the interpretation of its statute, so

24

it now has, sort of, an overarching circumstances-of-the-

25

crime aggravation consideration in its sentencing.

Apparently, in the interim, in

But

6
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

that was not the time as of Clemons.

2

in Clemons, which -- this Court referred to the statute of

3

Mississippi -- it was clear that, at least at the time of

4

Clemons, the eligibility factors were the sole

5

aggravation.

6

And, in the footnote

But the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So, you would say Clemons

7

should come out the other way, given the current state of

8

the Mississippi statute?

9

MS. KIRKLAND:

It depends how else the

10

aggravating factors are; what kind of a role the

11

aggravating factors play now under Mississippi

12

statute.

13

a "weighing" State.

14

"weighing" States, the eligibility factors are the

15

lynchpin of the sentencing decision.

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If the role is de minimus, then it's probably not
But the "weighing" States -- in the

Well, I suppose the reason

17

behind this distinction -- and it's, in a sense,

18

artificial, because we made it up -- I suppose the reason

19

is that, in the "weighing" State, the concern is that if

20

there is an ineligible -- or an invalid factor in the

21

eligibility determination, it carries over with a degree

22

of force and weight -- it's almost -- it's a presumption

23

that the jury is liable to treat it -- or, at least the

24

jury is liable to treat it as such.

25

aspect to this case, when the instructions refer -- as you

And I see that same

7
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

indicated in your colloquy with Justice Souter -- that the

2

instructions specifically say "any special -- any special

3

circumstance which has been found."

4

MS. KIRKLAND:

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

6

MS. KIRKLAND:

It's -- that is a -Am I right that the special --

That's what it says.

It's a --

7

it's a phrase, just as it's in the California statute,

8

that directs the jury, as a sentencing factor, to consider

9

the facts and circumstances of the crime along with any

10

special circumstances found to be true.

11

made it clear, in Stringer and in other cases, that how

12

the State court sees its statutory language ought to be

13

dispositive.

14

submit it's not reasonably likely a jury would interpret

15

it any other way -- that that means that the jury is to

16

consider the facts and circumstances of the case, all of

17

those facts and circumstances, including those that

18

underlie the special circumstances.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

20

And this Court's

And California has repeatedly held -- and we

That --

See, I'm not -- this is a

fairly complex area.

21

MS. KIRKLAND:

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'd agree.
And, as I understand, at this

23

moment -- and I hope you'll correct me if I'm wrong -- in

24

a "weighing" State, we look at the aggravating side, and

25

there seem, let's say, to be three factors that you could

8
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

take into account and weigh them against all the

2

mitigation.

3

thought, if factor one turns out to be invalid, the reason

4

that that's a big mistake, because the jury would have

5

weighed something against all that mitigating evidence

6

that it shouldn't have.

7

would be a lot of evidence on it, so it took it --

8

evidence into account it shouldn't have.

9

thought that was so.

10

I'm imagining that.

And you might have

And what's something?

There

So, I might have

But when I read the cases, that isn't so,

11

because I think it's -- in Clemons the evidence would have

12

come in anyway.

13

with this problem in the "weighing" State?

14

answer, I guess, has to be that the prosecutor or the

15

State said, "Jury, you look to these three things," with a

16

tone of voice that really made them important.

17

jury then weighed one and two and three.

18

anything to do with the evidence.

19

So, if that isn't so, what could be wrong
And the

And the

It didn't have

Well, if that's the problem, California seems to

20

have that problem, because one of the things it says to

21

weigh is, "Weigh circumstances of the crime."

22

means that's not everything.

23

this defendant.

24
25

And that

That's not the history of

And so, the problem that existed in Clemons and
in Stringer and in Zant that led to constitutional error

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1
2
3

seems to be there in California's case, too.
Now, I probably have made five mistakes in my
little recitation here, and I'd ask you to point them out.

4

[Laughter.]

5

MS. KIRKLAND:

In California -- well, first of

6

all, if this is new jurisprudence to you, or unfamiliar,

7

the critical difference is that most States, and most of

8

this Court's jurisprudence, uses the term "aggravating

9

factor" and "eligibility factor" interchangeably, because

10

in most States, and particularly in the "weighing" States,

11

"aggravating factor" is the eligibility factor that makes

12

the defendant eligible for death, but it's also the sole,

13

or primary, factor that the jury is to take into

14

consideration on the side militating in favor of death.

15

In California, we have "eligibility factors,"

16

which are the special circumstances, and those happen at

17

the guilt phase of the trial.

18

"sentencing factors," 11 factors that are totally

19

different from the special circumstances or --

20
21
22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And then we have

They're not totally

different, because one of them is special circumstances.
MS. KIRKLAND:

Well, one part of one of them.

23

In factor (a), there is one reference to special

24

circumstances, and that's --

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And it distinguishes those

10
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

from circumstances of the crime, and then it -- then it

2

says, "and special circumstances."

3

that "special circumstances" is a discrete factor,

4

different from "circumstances of the crime."

5

MS. KIRKLAND:

So, it seems to me

The way that California has

6

interpreted that -- in fact, there is a case that's cited

7

in these briefs, People versus Cain, and Morris -- which

8

is on our merits brief, in page 27, and in our reply

9

brief, on page 6 -- where a defendant in California argued

10

that that reference to "special circumstances" ought to be

11

excised from the direction to the jury of what they're to

12

consider at sentencing.

13

that should be excised, the California Supreme Court said,

14

"An instruction not to consider the special circumstances

15

would defeat the manifest purpose of factor (a) to inform

16

jurors that they should consider, as one factor, the

17

totality of the circumstances involved in the criminal

18

episode that's on trial."

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And in rejecting the idea that

It is, indeed, very

20

complicated, Ms. Kirkland.

21

of the Constitution is it that contains this complexity?

22

[Laughter.]

23

MS. KIRKLAND:

24
25

And, I forget, which provision

All of this jurisprudence is

based on the eighth amendment requirement -JUSTICE SCALIA:

That says?

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

MS. KIRKLAND:

-- that says that, "A valid

2

death-penalty statute must provide sufficient narrowing"

3

--

4
5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Is that what the eighth

amendment says?

6

MS. KIRKLAND:

That's the way the eighth

7

amendment has been interpreted in its application of cruel

8

and unusual --

9
10

JUSTICE SCALIA:
are forbidden.

11

Cruel and unusual punishments

And this is where that comes from?

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And may I ask you a question

12

about the California statute, if I may, please?

13

subsection (a) of 190.3, it says that the trier of fact

14

"shall" take into account any of the following factors, if

15
16
17

relevant.

In

And one of those is the existence of any

special circumstance found to be true, pursuant to 190.1.
And under 190.1, one of the special circumstances is

18

number 14, "heinous, atrocious, or cruel."

19

the statute required in the weighing process -- that the

20

jury take into account that factor?

21

that factor was held invalid?

22
23
24
25

MS. KIRKLAND:

Does that mean

And is it not true

That factor was held invalid, but

what -JUSTICE STEVENS:

So, they were -- they were

directed to take into -- they "shall" take into account an

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1
2

invalid factor.
MS. KIRKLAND:

Well, yes.

"Shall" -- as

3

interpreted in California versus Brown by this Court and

4

in the California Supreme Court jurisprudence, "shall" is

5

a directive, it's not -- it's not -- California does not

6

have a mandatory statute.

7

8

9

JUSTICE STEVENS:

10

clearly is not mitigating.

11

MS. KIRKLAND:

In fact, none of these factors
It's

No, but the -- number 14

No.

But whether or not a crime

12

is heinous, atrocious, and cruel is part of -- apart from

13

its labeling as a special circumstance, that's certainly a

14

valid consideration for the jury to be thinking about when

15

it's engaged in its normative process of choosing

16

sentencing.

17

California statute -- when "heinous, atrocious, and

18

cruel," as a special circumstance, is out of the mix -- is

19

whether it can be labeled "heinous, atrocious, and cruel,"

20

and whether that label has any independent weight.

21

all of the evidence and the --

The only thing that's different under the

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

1

have all the evidence, and that jury was instructed that

2

at the guilt phase a determination has been -- that has --

3

it has been found that the crime was especially heinous,

4

atrocious, and so forth, that that finding might tip the

5

scales in favor of imposing the death penalty?

6
7
8
9
10
11

MS. KIRKLAND:

I don't think so, Your Honor,

since that -JUSTICE STEVENS:

Because the underlying facts

are already before the jury, and they can make their own
judgment about them.
MS. KIRKLAND:

Right.

And that instruction

12

specifically directs the jury to all the facts and

13

circumstances of the crime; and so, not only the

14

characteristics of all those facts, but it would even be

15

appropriate for the prosecutor to refer to the crime as

16

"heinous and atrocious."

17

JUSTICE STEVENS:

See, one of the -- one of the

18

things that concerns me about this case -- unlike Zant,

19

most of the cases in which we have found the label of

20

aggravating -- immaterial -- or findings like prior

21

criminal histories -- robbery, or something like -- but

22

whenever a pejorative factor of this kind has been found,

we've generally found it did tilt the scales a little bit

MS. KIRKLAND:

So, the -- California's holding

2

on "heinous, atrocious, and cruel" in its Engert case,

3

which is cited in these briefs, pre-dates this Court's

4

holding in Maynard that "heinous, atrocious, and cruel"

5

was invalid under the eighth amendment.

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So, now we have an extra layer

7

of complexity, because something that's been held

8

unconstitutional under State law is said to skew the

9

weighing, if it is weighing, as a matter of Federal law.

10

MS. KIRKLAND:

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

12

MS. KIRKLAND:

Yes, it can be looked at -All right.

-- that way.

But the other thing

13

that I wanted to say about your question about Profitt is

14

that Florida, like some of the other States, after Maynard

15

v. Cartwright declared that "heinous, atrocious, and

16

cruel" was an inappropriate eligibility circumstance under

17

the eighth amendment, some States have fashioned either

18

instructions or changes in their law to tailor their

19

"heinous circumstance" to meet the concerns that are

20

expressed in Profitt.

21

because --

But California has never done that,

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's in the -- it's cited in the briefs.
What did -- what did the

10

California Supreme Court hold?

11

considering the "heinous, atrocious, or cruel" nature of

12

the crime as part of the totality of the balancing was

13

improper, or did it hold that that language is

14

insufficient to form one of the narrowing functions that

15

the aggravating circumstances provided.

16

MS. KIRKLAND:

Did it hold that

The Engert case specifically held

17

that the "heinous, atrocious, and cruel" circumstance was

18

only invalid as an eligibility determinant, because it

19

failed to adequately narrow.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So, it specifically --

So, if I think something is

21

"heinous, atrocious, or cruel," I can use that in the

22

balancing, even though I can't use it as one of the

23

narrowing factors.

24
25

MS. KIRKLAND:

That's correct.

And in the Engert case

itself, the California Supreme Court indicated that

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

this Court -- as the Ninth Circuit did, is to look at

2

whether California performed a proper Clemons review,

3

which is that the appellate court looks to see whether

4

there is a principled and complete harmless-error review.

5

The Ninth Circuit held that there was no such principled

6

and complete review, because --

7
8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I would have thought

that that might have collapsed into the Brecht analysis.

9

MS. KIRKLAND:

It could have, but it -- the

10

court did it in two steps, and we believe it's because the

11

Ninth Circuit recognized that it couldn't get to Brecht

12

unless it found that California's attempt to cure the

13

error under Clemons failed.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In other words, you said that

15

the error was harmless under Chapman, the higher standard

16

--

17

MS. KIRKLAND:

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes.
-- and that the California

19

court so ruled.

20

would never get to any Brecht standard; the Federal court

21

would have to say California applied the proper harmless-

22

error analysis, and that's the end of the case.

And if that ruling is correct, then you

23

MS. KIRKLAND:

24

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

25

That's correct.
So the -- so the second

question, once we get past weighing, is whether

right?

MS. KIRKLAND:

Is that

That's correct, that they not

4

only have to have applied the appropriate standards --

5

that is, the "beyond a reasonable doubt" standard, which

6

is the same as California's "reasonable possibility"

7

standard -- they not only have cried -- applied the

8

correct standard, but they have to have done so in a

9

principled and complete way so the reviewing court can

10

make sure that they've actually cured the error.

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

12

MS. KIRKLAND:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, the problem --

California Supreme Court decision is rather skimpy once

How do you

Why is it not a "weighing" State when it

MS. KIRKLAND:

Because the word "weigh" isn't

11

the talisman for the process that the jury goes through.

12

"Weigh" is a normative process that -- opposing counsel

13

have made the point that, in the 1977 law, which everybody

14

agreed was a "non-weighing" law, that when we injected the

15

word "weigh" into the 1978 capital sentencing statute,

16

that that changed this.

17

made clear, in its Frierson decision, that, as far as

18

California is concerned, the process -- the mental process

that the jury goes through under either statute is the

same, that "weigh," "consider," "balance," so on, none has

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NINA RIVKIND

11

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

12
13
14

MS. RIVKIND:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I would like to focus on the observation that we

15

need to look at what the jury was instructed, because I

16

think that will clarify for the Court that California's

17

1978 law is, indeed, a "weighing" statute under the

18

established law of this Court.

19

In Mr. Sanders' case, the jury was instructed in

20

the language of section 190.3, and this language gave the

21

jury a very explicit roadmap as to how it was to undertake

22

its sentence selection in this case.

23

Section 190.3 assigns a specific role to the

24

aggravating factors.

25

determining the penalty, you shall consider, take into

It tells a jury that, "In

Court have noted, are specifically included.

defendant had a prior conviction.

9

However, there are two additional aggravating

And so, in this sense, we -- the Mississippi
statute is very comparable to California.

And it goes

10

further, because, in Mississippi -- in Clemons' case, if

11

you look at the joint appendix, at 24, and also in

12

Stringer's case, at joint appendix 10 -- the juries were

13

instructed, pursuant to the Mississippi standard capital-

14

sentencing instructions -- the very first opening

15

paragraph tells the juries that, "In determining penalty,

16

you must objectively consider the detailed circumstances

17

of the crime."

18

the court's footnote 5 in Clemons, which I think is very

19

important in terms of understanding why this whole focus

20

on circumstances of the crime is not relevant to the

21

distinction between "weighing" and "non-weighing."

And I think this instruction helps explain

which are -- have been specified and which are narrowing

circumstances; there are only five named in the statute --

4

"shall weigh the aggravating circumstances found to be

5

true against the mitigating," and it turns out that one of

6

those five aggravating circumstances is unconstitutional.

7

Okay?

Then you have the jury weighing something that it

8

shouldn't have weighed, because that aggravating

9

circumstance was bad.

10

I don't see why any harm is done where you have

11

a statute that lists aggravating factors, one of which is

"heinous, atrocious, or cruel," and that is later found

13

invalid by the State supreme court.

And his jury

But the -- but the

evidence supporting them was perfectly admissible.

So,

10

the jury could consider that evidence and come to the same

11

conclusion; it's just the label that seems to be giving

12

you the most concern.

13
14

MS. RIVKIND:

I have two responses, Your Honor.

First, the rule -- the distinction between "weighing" and

15

"non-weighing" is not an evidentiary rule.

16

about the statutory labels that a State gives to the

17

factors that the jury puts on death's side of the scale.

18

Even in a "non-weighing" State, as Zant made clear, if and in

19

where a harmless-error review need not be done, because

20

the court has concluded there will be -- the aggravating

21

circumstances have an inconsequential impact, because the

22

jury is not required to consider them in the selection

23

decision -- even there, if an invalid aggravating

24

circumstance permits the introduction of evidence that

25

would otherwise have been inadmissible, we have error.

It is a rule

31
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

And that's the conclusion that the --

2

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay, but aren't we in, sort

3

of, the converse situation here?

4

about the admissibility of evidence that shouldn't

5

otherwise have come in.

6

the error proceeds from the fact that, by using this label

7

-- by referring to the circumstance as a "special

8

circumstance," having been found at the eligibility stage

9

-- that circumstance, and all the evidence that might

There isn't any question

I thought your argument here is:

support it, is given extra weight, and that's where the

thumb on the scale comes.

My argument is that the "special

circumstance" finding, itself, is the invalid aggravating

14

factor on death's side of the scale.

2

The harm to Mr. Sanders was that the jury was

told that it had a process that was mandated for reaching

4

its decision, and that process required the jury to put

5

two special circumstances on death's side of the scale,

6

that should not have been there, and then required the

jury to reach the penalty decision by balancing.

read it, it says juries don't give special circumstances

any extra weight in considering all the variety of factors

listed in the statute?

MS. RIVKIND:

I don't read Bacigalupo as saying

that.

invalid special circumstances being weighed at the penalty

12

selection.

13

California Supreme Court are its Hamilton and Benson

14

decisions, wherein, addressing exactly the situation, a

15

claim that invalid special circumstances tainted the death

16

sentence, the court said, specifically, "We presume the

17

jury weighs those special circumstances, apart from the crime"

18

--

19

Bacigalupo did not deal with the question of

I think the more appropriate authority of the

JUSTICE BREYER:

The word "special

20

circumstances" is ambiguous, because it might refer to

21

something in the world, in which case it's about evidence,

22

or it might refer to something in the law, in which case

23

it's a statement by a prosecutor to look at some of this

24

evidence and give it some special weight.

25

what's confusing me throughout.

Now, that

1

As I understood this area, to go back to what

2

Justice Scalia was saying -- no, wait, just -- I'll back

3

up to try to get you to correct my misunderstanding --

4

Zant is the key, because Zant says, "Judge, if you have a

5

'non-weighing' State" -- that is, everything's relevant

6

but the kitchen sink -- "the fact that the prosecutor made

7

a mistake at the eligibility stage by including something

8

he shouldn't is beside the point."

9

MS. RIVKIND:

10

Is that right?

That is correct.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Fine.

Then we look at Stringer

11

and Clemons, and they're making exceptions to Zant.

12

they're making exceptions for "weighing" States.

13

if the evidence in all three cases is identical and it

14

made no difference to the evidence -- that is, to what

15

really happened in the world -- still, says Clemons and

16

Stringer -- still, you're not home free yet, State.

17

Rather, you have to back up and do harmless-error

18

analysis.

And

So, even

19

So, the answer, I think, to Justice Scalia, if I

20

understand it, is, Justice Scalia, you may be right, maybe

21

all this is harmless, but we don't have before us the

22

product of harmless-error analysis, because you didn't

23

grant cert on it, among other reasons.

24
25

Now, if I'm right so far, and if we want to
straighten all this out, why not go back and say all three

35
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

cases are wrong?

2

"Court, always conduct harmless-error analysis.

3

it whether you're in 'non-weighing,' conduct it whether

4

you're in 'weighing.'

What you really ought to do is say,
Conduct

We'll simplify."

5

Now, what would be so terrible about that?

6

MS. RIVKIND:

7
8
9

Your Honor, if I were able to

write on a clean slate, that is the rule I would propose.
I think that if you -- the whole idea of Zant was carving
out an exception from conducting harmless-error review,

10

and the court was assured that because the aggravating

11

circumstance, which was only a death eligibility factor,

12

fell away at the selection stage, there was really -- it

13

was -- the impact of that aggravating circumstance was

14

likely to be inconsequential, as the Georgia Supreme Court

15

found, and as this Court found in Zant.

16

approach would be to apply harmless-error review, no

17

matter what the structure of the statute --

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

The simple

Then we would not have this

19

crossword puzzle, which probably only five people in the

20

United States understand, and the worst thing that would

21

happen would be, you'd always conduct harmless-error

22

analysis, and thus, if Justice Scalia is right about it,

23

you would lose, and if -- because it would be harmless --

24

and if he's wrong about it, you'd win.

MS. RIVKIND:

So then,

So, what mitigation is

Your Honor, I think we first need

19

to distinguish between the lack of a formal mitigation

20

case and the absence of mitigating factors.

21

in reviewing a different claim, the California Supreme

22

Court -- and I refer the Court to joint appendix 108, I

23

believe is the cite -- the California Supreme Court found

24

that Mr. Sanders' decision to refuse to take part in the

25

penalty phase did not necessarily make a death sentence

In this case,

37
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

1

more likely, and it also found that the jury could have

2

found mitigating factors from the guilt-phase evidence.

3

Indeed, the jury was instructed to consider the evidence

4

from all parts of the trial.

5
6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:
that sentence.

MS. RIVKIND:

8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

10

I see

The jury --

7

9

Well, what were those?

So, I think there was a -Yes, but what were the

mitigating factors from the evidence presented at the
guilt phase?

11

MS. RIVKIND:

The main mitigating evidence was a

12

powerful mitigating factor which went to the personal

13

culpability of Mr. Sanders, and that was that the

14

prosecutor, in his closing guilt-phase argument, told the

15

jury, "We don't know whether Mr. Sanders was the actual

16

killer or whether his co-defendant, Mr. Cebreros, was."

17

And there was evidence from the surviving victim that

18

there was a conversation between the two assailants,

19

before the surviving victim was struck, in which one of

20

the men said he wanted to leave the apartment.

21

again, there was no evidence as to which defendant this

22

was.

23

And,

This Court, in Green versus Georgia, has

24

realized that whether someone is an actual killer or an

25

accomplice is of critical importance in deciding between

38

Alderson Reporting Company

life and death.

2

factor in this case.

3

That was the main powerful mitigating
And --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I've never heard that described

4

as a mitigating factor before.

5

worse if you're a triggerman, but I don't know what makes

6

it -- somehow it's mitigating if you were not the

7

triggerman.

8

something even worse.

9

mitigation --

10

I mean, it's certainly

I would say that you're not guilty of

MS. RIVKIND:

But to call that a factor of

I think it is mitigating, and the

11

fact that there is a question about one of the people,

12

perhaps the accomplice, which very well could have been

13

Mr. Sanders, wanting to leave before the murder occurred

14

was basis enough to give the jury pause.

15

at the deliberations, we realize that there was a jury

16

note, about three-quarters of the way through its

17

deliberations, asking the jury the consequences if it

18

could not reach a unanimous jury verdict.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And if we look

But now you're getting into

But there was no such argument made in this

MS. RIVKIND:

MS. RIVKIND:

No, in the trial court, nothing was

argued, because trial counsel acquiesced to Mr. Sanders'

request that there be no penalty defense.

13

And I want to make it clear, this is not a case

14

because Mr. Sanders wanted death.

wanted to go home.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

statement that he was indifferent between death and life

2

indicates the -- that you would not be disconsolate if we

3

jettisoned the whole -- the whole distinction.

4

it true that it's paradoxical that a State which tries to

5

structure the selection phase by giving specific factors

6

as held to a higher standard than a State that doesn't?

7

That seems to me very odd.

8
9

MS. RIVKIND:
that's odd.

And isn't

Well, I don't -- I don't think

I think what that recognizes is that the

10

Court has said, "While you do not have to give a -- we do

11

not need a guided-discretion statute" -- that, as Zant

12

holds, a jury can have complete, absolute discretion in

13

choosing between life and death -- that when a State does

14

regulate that, it must be done within the contours of the

15

Constitution.

16

between "weighing" --

17

The essential wisdom in the distinction

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But it is within the contours

18

of the Constitution if, in a "non-weighing" State, the

19

same evidence could be considered.

20

MS. RIVKIND:

But it -- I don't -- again, I

21

don't think it's a question of evidence, I think it's a

22

question of what are those factors that are being put in --

23

on -- in death's side of the scale, and how are they being

24

balanced --

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, and I can imagine, in

41
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

"non-weighing" State, a prosecutor banging on and on, at

2

the eligibility stage, on factor X, and really fixing that

3

in the mind of the jury, and it turns out that factor X is

4

not an aggravator.

5

prejudiced.

Now, the jury might have been

6

And I can imagine, in a "weighing" State that,

7

because the evidence is the same, and because there were

8

so many factors just like it, the fact that they used the

9

wrong factor didn't really make any difference.

10

So, it seems to me the lineup between harm --

11

real harm in a case, and weighing/non-weighing, it doesn't

12

line up terribly well.

13

that's why I'd like your reaction.

But you have the experience.

14

MS. RIVKIND:

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

In terms of the rule of -Yes.

Yes.

I mean, a serious

16

effort to go back and say, "Look, harmless error

would like to be thrown --

MS. RIVKIND:

I -- I'd like harmless-error

3

analysis.

I think -- I think that would be a simpler

4

approach.

It would accommodate competing interests,

5

because each State's statute would be informing the

6

prejudice analysis, and you would be looking at how many

7

different sentencing selection factors were before the

8

jury.

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

10

MS. RIVKIND:

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In that --

I --- analysis, would you use, as

12

one factor, the circumstance that an eligibility

13

determination was made by the jury, was focused on by the

14

prosecutor, and that that was impermissibly vague?

15

that be a component of your harmless-error analysis?

MS. RIVKIND:

already, that if there is an invalid eligibility factor

factors, the invalidity of eligibility factors -- that

in Mississippi, the "heinous, atrocious, and cruel" was

only a selection factor.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JANE N. KIRKLAND

7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

MS. KIRKLAND:

I'd like to make three quick

points in rebuttal.
The first is that, as to the claim -- Ms.

11

Rivkind's claim, that she's reiterated here, that the

12

California Supreme Court has determined that the "special

13

circumstances" label has some independent weight that it's

14

important for the jury to consider at sentencing -- she's

15

only cited half of the sentence in Benson and Hamilton.

16

The other half rebuts her claim.

17

The sentence is, "Although we presume that the

18

jurors followed their instructions and considered the

19

invalid special circumstances finding, independent of thier

20

underlying facts" -- that's what she relies on -- they

21

say, then, as they've said in a number of cases, "we

22

cannot conclude that they could reasonably have given them

23

any independent significant weight."

24
25

So, it's just the point we're making.

It's just

a label that does not carry with it any independent

significant weight, because the evidence, the argument,

2

the circumstances are all before the jury in the same way.

3

The second point is that, while there may be

4

some doubt as to whether Mr. Sanders was the actual killer

in this case, there's no question as to his complete

culpability in the crime.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Do you agree that such

10

residual-doubt factors are appropriately considered if the

11

defendant didn't raise them?

12

that, yes, the jury found the defendant guilty beyond a

13

reasonable doubt, but maybe there's something that makes

14

that determination doubtful.

15

MS. KIRKLAND:

I mean, the question of --

I don't think that's an

16

appropriate consideration here, where it wasn't raised,

17

ever.

18
19

The third point is that we wouldn't be here,
except for the overlap in factor -- sentencing factor (a).

20

That subclause, which the California Supreme Court has

21

repeatedly held, means only that the jury is to consider

22

all the facts and circumstances of the crime, including

23

the facts and circumstances underlying the special

24

circumstance, or eligibility factor.
