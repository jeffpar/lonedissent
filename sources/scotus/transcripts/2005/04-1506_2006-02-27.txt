ORAL ARGUMENT OF LORI FRENO

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MS. FRENO:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

The parties agree that Medicaid paid over

12

$215,000 to cover the costs of medical care provided to

13

Ms. Ahlborn that resulted from an auto accident that

14

she was involved in.

15

Petitioner, the Arkansas Department of Health and Human

16

Services, may place a lien on some portion of the third

17

party settlement proceeds that are at issue in this

18

case.

19

lien may reach into the third party settlement proceeds

20

in this case.

21

The parties also agree that the

They disagree, however, as to what extent that

The Respondent, without notifying the

22

Department of Health and Human Services, finalized a

23

settlement with the remaining tortfeasor accepting

24

$550,000 as a compromised settlement for a claim that

25

she had originally valued at over $3 million.

Can you tell me?

It's my

My understanding was that Arkansas had

MS. FRENO:

That is correct, Your Honor.

Arkansas did intervene in the lawsuit.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So after the settlement, I

7

take it Arkansas would -- still would have had the

8

right to -- to pursue its claim in the litigation, or

9

am I wrong about that?

10

MS. FRENO:

Well, Your Honor, after -- at the

11

point that Arkansas learned about the settlement, the

12

case had already been dismissed out of State court with

13

prejudice, and the Respondent notified the department

14

that if it would not accept -- it would not compromise

15

its Medicaid claim, that they would be filing a

16

declaratory judgment action in Federal court to resolve

17

the anti-lien question.

18

Federal court.

19
20
21
22
23

And that is how we ended up in

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But if Arkansas was a party

to the case, it didn't get notice of the dismissal?
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That's what I don't

understand.
MS. FRENO:

They -- it did not get notice of

24

the dismissal.

25

know what happened, but we did not get notice of the

No, it did not, Your Honor.

We do not

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, I don't understand --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

How can they do that with

-- with a party?

5

reason I ask is it seems to me that you still have the

6

cause of action left.

7

question.

8
9

I mean, the -- and the reason -- the

Maybe that would be my next

Suppose there's a settlement and you don't
get, in the settlement, even earmarks, medical

10

specialists, plus general damages, and you're -- you're

11

unsatisfied.

12

Arkansas law -- or do you -- to pursue the tortfeasor

13

for the balance that's owed to you?

14

Don't you still have the right under

MS. FRENO:

Arguably Arkansas could have

15

attempted to get the case reopened in State court, but

16

the Petitioner -- I'm sorry -- the Respondent in this

17

case selected the Federal forum to resolve the issue.

18
19

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, but that's not that issue.

That is, I think the question is, why is it that this

20

statute doesn't simply provide the following route?

21

Party A and party B enter into a settlement, and they

22

say $10,000 is for medical and $90,000 is for pain and

23

suffering.

24

fine.

25

for the remaining $40,000.

You, Arkansas, are out $50,000.

You're in the case anyway.

Well,

MS. FRENO:

JUSTICE BREYER:

3

MS. FRENO:

Well, Your Honor -And that's the end of it.

I'm not familiar with the terms

4

of the settlement agreement, but I would assume that if

5

Arkansas would have sued the defendant for the

6

remainder, that there would have been an

7

indemnification clause in the settlement agreement,

8

which means that the money would have ended up coming

9

right out of Ms. Ahlborn's pocket in any event.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, I have no idea about

11

that.

12

question I think that I would have is why doesn't the

13

statute propose the route for a State in your -- in

14

your position that I just said.

15

faith settlement and they think that $10,000 of this

16

good faith settlement is attributable to the medical

17

expense and you are out $40,000 -- $50,000, you can sue

18

the other party.

19

proceed with the suit.

I'm interested in this nest of statutes, and the

Your Honor -They can't settle your claim

out from under you.

That is exactly what happened.

They did settle the claim out from under the

department.

No, but the -But we're asking how that

can be.

MS. FRENO:

We don't -- well, we don't know

5

how that can be.

6

know why the State court dismissed the action.

7
8

We don't know why the -- we do not

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

We're asking you as a

matter of Arkansas law.

9

MS. FRENO:

As a matter of Arkansas law, a

10

claim should not be dismissed until all parties are --

11

the rights of all parties are determined.

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

13

JUSTICE STEVENS:

14

Why didn't Arkansas -I wonder if you have a

claim for incompetent counsel representing you.

15

MS. FRENO:

16

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I'm sorry?
I'm wondering you -- if you

17

have a claim against counsel for being incompetent in

18

letting a settlement be made without notice to the --

19

to you.

20

how this could happen.

21

It seems to me hard to -- hard to understand

MS. FRENO:

Well, if -- in fact, there is an

22

Arkansas statute that if monies that belong to the

23

department are distributed in a -- in a manner that is

24

inconsistent, you know, with the interests of the

25

department, that it can pursue either the Medicaid

Because -I mean, why are we going

Then why don't we just send

The reason we're going through

as a part of the declaratory judgment action.

That was not

It was brought in Federal court

No.

But at -- at the end of the day, you want your money,

15

and -- and I don't see why you can't get your money

16

simply by going back into the State court.

easier to do that than come to the Supreme Court of the

MS. FRENO:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yes.
Well, if you're

filing a petition, you have to have some expectation

16

that you might end up here.

MS. FRENO:

Oh, I thought you meant at the

18

time that the State court case was dismissed.

19

I misunderstood the question.
JUSTICE BREYER:

I want to go back to the

Federal statutes and the State statute.

22

MS. FRENO:

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.
Why isn't this discussion

24

just suggest what the answer is to the legal question

raised?

8

literally, and why not just follow them?

It is not medical expense money.

9

The

That doesn't leave you

The remedy is to go against the

MS. FRENO:

The statutes say that

Your Honor, the third party

10

liability provisions of Federal Medicaid law is what

11

governs this case, and those statutes require that the

12

States seek -- seek reimbursement from liable third

13

parties for medical costs for the full amount of that

14

liability.

15

Now, as a -- a condition of Ms. Ahlborn's

16

eligibility -- or as a condition of eligibility for

17

Medicaid, Ms. Ahlborn had to assign to the State her

18

right to payment for medical costs -- her right to

19

payment for medical costs.

20

assigned that right to the State, it was synonymous

21

with what the State itself had to do, which was seek

22

full reimbursement from liable third parties to the

23

extent of the third parties' legal liability.

24
25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Consequently, when she

But could she -- after that

assignment, could she bring a suit in her own right to

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

do that, to recover the medical costs?

2

MS. FRENO:

Yes, she could, Your Honor, and

3

in fact, that is what the majority --

4

JUSTICE STEVENS:

5

Even though she's assigned

the cause of action to the State?

6

MS. FRENO:

Yes, Your Honor.

And that is

7

what the majority of the Medicaid recipients in our

8

State choose to do.

9

on their own and in the end just reimburse the Medicaid

10
11

They prefer to pursue the action

program.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why isn't it dismissed on

12

the basis that they -- they don't have a cause of

13

action because they've assigned it?

14

MS. FRENO:

Well, they -- she is basically --

15

a recipient is pursuing the cause of action with the --

16

the approval of the State.

17

party liability provisions, it's important to recognize

18

that they provide -- they include a duty of cooperation

19

that the recipient has to cooperate with the State in

20

seeking full Medicaid reimbursement.

21

the Federal third party liability provisions basically

22

consider the recipient and the State to be a team, a

23

team that is out to get full reimbursement.

24
25

And also, in the third

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So the third --

You're -- you're talking

without reference to the statute, and as I read the

11
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

statute, the phrase that keeps reappearing is payments

2

made by a third party for health care items or

3

services.

4

what she got for health care, but we know that her tort

5

claim consisted of a lot more.

6

statute says she has to turn over what she received

7

from the third party for health care services, well,

8

she did that, and you agreed that that would be a fair

9

allocation.

10
11

So she has to turn over from her recovery

So if the Federal

So I don't see how you get from her the --

a much larger share than what she got for health care.
MS. FRENO:

Your Honor, what the statute

12

requires -- this is in the Petitioners' brief on pages

13

2 and 3 -- at 42 U.S.C. 1396k(a)(1)(A), which is the

14

section that talks about the scope of the assignment,

15

she has to assign her rights to payment for medical

16

care, not payments that she actually receives for

17

medical care.

18

And what are her rights to payment for

19

medical care?

20

Medicaid context and put it in a standard tort context,

21

someone who's injured by a third party has a right to

22

receive all the money that she is out due to the fact

23

that she was injured by the third party.

this question so far as the rights of the assignee and

the assignor.

Suppose it's a very weak case and the

10

litigant says I want to settle for 20 cents on the

11

dollar.

12

to notify the State and -- and to consult with the

13

State before this is done?

15

Are you saying that there's some kind of duty

MS. FRENO:

Yes, Your Honor, and that is

encompassed within State law.

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Okay.

Suppose the -- the

17

State says, well, we -- we don't -- we don't agree with

18

you.

19

loggerheads and you go to Justice Souter's position I

20

suppose.

21

Then -- then what happens?

MS. FRENO:

Then they're at

In that situation, then the --

22

the case would just have to go forward to litigation.

And yes, the State, if it wished to pursue --

2

nonetheless, for 20 cents on the dollar.

3

think you have the right to receive 100 percent of your

payment from the proceeds in the case that I put?

MS. FRENO:

Do you still

Would you repeat that?

9

you have the right, as you understand the law, to

from the gross settlement?

that you're entitled to 100 percent of your payments.

but -- and I take it, that would be without regard to

what the Federal law required.

beyond what the Federal law requires you do as a

condition of participation in Medicaid.

7

MS. FRENO:

No.

The Arkansas law can go

Correct?

State law cannot go, Your

8

Honor, beyond Federal law, and Federal law allows the

9

State to receive full reimbursement to the extent of

10

the third party's liability.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, if we disagree

12

with you on that -- in other words, you're saying we

13

don't even have to reach the anti-lien provision

14

question.

15

to the extent payments for medical care, then you would

16

lose without regard to the anti-lien provision?

I'm sorry.

Would you repeat

that?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Arkansas law, as you

understand it --

MS. FRENO:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yes.
-- requires a -- a

23

full -- full assignment of any expenses the State -- or

24

full recovery of any expenses the State has incurred.

It's not -- it's a debate whether Medicaid law requires

that.

Medicaid law does not require it, you would lose

without regard to any consideration of the anti-lien

provision?

And what you're saying is if we think the

MS. FRENO:

If Medicaid -- Medicaid law does

7

determined that Medicaid law did not require full

reimbursement from -- to the extent of a third party's

liability, well, then there would not be an anti-lien

But if this Court

10

-- there would not be an anti-lien provision question.

11

But Federal law does require the State to seek full

12

reimbursement to the extent of the third party's

13

liability.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, that's one of

15

the issues, and I'm trying to understand.

16

Respondent's position is that the Arkansas law goes

17

beyond what the Medicaid assignment provisions require.

18

And I want your position on whether or not, if that's

19

right, again without regard to the anti-lien provision,

20

that you would lose.

21

Arkansas can go beyond what the Medicaid law requires

22

for reimbursement, if it wants.

23

MS. FRENO:

It seems to me that you can --

No, that is not true, Your Honor.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That would be correct.
Okay.

That's without

regard to the anti-lien provision, or is it because of

the anti-lien provision?

MS. FRENO:

It would be because of the anti-

for medical care, that -- the anti-lien provision

doesn't operate with regard to that amount of money

that is recovered from a third party in a -- in a third

settlement includes the payment for medical care that

she was entitled to and the one she assigned to the

the position of the beneficiary is that the amount that

There's never been a claim by the beneficiaries here

that there's something left under State law to do or

to what the fair medical payment is in this settlement,

can we insist upon 100 percent?

Otherwise, there's two things happening.

The

3

-- the beneficiary should not be better off for having

4

cut the State out of the process, but that's what's

5

going to happen.

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well -- well, if your rule

7

is just one that you have to pay the 100 percent if

8

there's non-cooperation and a non-notice, that's one

9

thing.

But the briefs, it seems to me, indicate that

10

you have an absolute right to 100 percent.

11

are two very different propositions.

12

MS. MILLETT:

And those

Our position is the 100 percent

claim -- the default -- as a default rule, when the

14

State has been cut out and cannot make the reasoned

15

judgment that the Medicaid statute charges the State

16

with making on these claims, that's a 100 percent rule.

17

Quite -- our position, quite

18

straightforwardly, is if the State was involved or if

19

there was a jury finding of 50/50, you know,

20

comparative negligence, then the Medicaid claim gets

cut in half because it -- the -- the State can consider

And if we try to take more, it violates the anti-lien

provision.

I see your

white light is on.

5

What are they?

MS. MILLETT:

The -- the first one,

obviously, -- there's three.

8

The first one is evidence control.

The State

9

has a pile of bills but no evidence about liability.

10

Now, beforehand, if they're involved, their -- their

11

interests and the beneficiary's are aligned to maximize

12

recovery.

13

either at a post hoc hearing with the beneficiary or

14

try to sue some third party, and the beneficiary is

15

going to say, oh, I fell asleep at the wheel, I was on

16

my cell phone, I had preexisting conditions, because

17

her incentive is now to reduce your recovery.

18

the exact opposite of the duty of cooperation that

19

Federal and State law envisioned for this process.

After the fact, the State is going to go in,

20

The second --

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Why is it her incentive to

22

reduce recovery?

23

but why does she have incentive to reduce it?

This is

She may not be getting anything more,

MS. MILLETT:

Because at this -- if -- if

we're in a post hoc hearing to sort of allocate the

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yes.

Insofar as the suit

16

against the defendant is concerned, she's not -- she

17

does not have an interest in minimizing.

But she may if there's an

19

indemnity agreement, which means if they have to pay to

MR. BLAIR:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

6

The problem here, of course, is one where the

7

funds, the proceeds, to resolve a claim are less than

8

the damages of all parties, including the medical bills

9

that have been paid by the State.

10

Now, the Court is correct that not only under

11

the Federal statute did the State have the option of

12

pursuing an independent cause of action, there is a

13

State statute that provides that very thing, our code

14

20-77-301.

allows a splitting of the common law cause of action

for personal injury, which otherwise would be

Because they're -- they're taking

They intervened and claimed a lien upon the

occurrence, the kind of injury they sustained, the

15

proportion that the claim for medicals bore to the

16

MR. BLAIR:

But roughly speaking, is it

It -- it is the same percentage

18

that the total medicals bore to what we agreed was a

fair valuation of the claim or what we agreed there

JUSTICE SOUTER:

22

MR. BLAIR:

Okay.

In other words, the State --

23

after this dispute broke out, the Respondent and the

value of the claim, absent any considerations of

given for the medicals.

MR. BLAIR:

client to make a claim not of $3 million but of $6

damages, the physical damages, the loss of earnings,

that this is a fair calculation of the settlement.

There was no agreement with the

The idea that we unilaterally came up with

Respondents couldn't reach an agreement, ultimately, in

Do you think under Arkansas

in all likelihood, would have never received --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but what you're

saying is that there's no duty to notify the assignee

if you think you might get a pretty good result for

yourself.

10

I don't understand that as much of -- much

of a duty.

the assignee would be true insofar as proceeding

serve any purpose in maximizing the total recovery,

there probably is a duty, but notice to the assignee

That is to say, even if it's not your problem by

reason of our coming out the way you would like us to,

wouldn't it remain a problem for the insurance company

so they could not enter into any settlement until they

we're going to get to the same place, that if -- if you

that you have to get the -- the State involved.
MR. BLAIR:

And -- and perhaps if we

We ultimately rely upon the text

Arkansas law, as to who owned the chose in action first

and, secondly, who owned the proceeds of the settlement

recovery after the assignment had taken place.

4

MR. BLAIR:

First, I think there's no

5

question that Heidi Ahlborn owned the chose in action

6

because under Arkansas law her claim was complete by

7

the time the glass and the metal stopped falling to the

8

highway.

9

Secondly, as to the who owned the proceeds

10

depends upon the extent to which the State was allowed

11

to take an assignment.

12

take an assignment from something other than the claim

13

for medical expenses, then they owned the proceeds.

14

Our contention is that the State was only allowed to

take an assignment under the language of the statute

That's correct, Your Honor.

Is that -- and which

MR. BLAIR:

The claim that was -- that we

2

were bringing was under Federal law in that we were

3

claiming the Arkansas statute was invalid by reason of

4

a anti-lien statute, and we believed that that

5

presented a question of Federal law and therefore

6

brought it --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
defense.

MR. BLAIR:

11

Sounds like a

-- in district court.

Which hadn't been raised, Your Honor, and I'm
having to wing it.

But that's --

12

(Laughter.)

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Do you still have a

14

declaration that the Arkansas statute was

15

unconstitutional because it conflicted with the Federal

16

statute?

17

MR. BLAIR:

That's correct.

That was our --

18

our claim before the district court that ultimately

19

wound up in the Eighth Circuit.

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It still sounds like

21

a defense to me, counsel, and I think it may make a

22

difference if your argument relies on the anti-lien

23

provision as a defense or perhaps relies on the -- the

24

assignment provisions in the Medicaid statute.

25

why I'm just trying to focus on whether it's the

That's

Alderson Reporting Company

1

assignment provisions that limit what Arkansas can do

2

as a matter of its own law, or if it's the anti-lien

3

provision as a defense.

4

MR. BLAIR:

I believe that it is both.

I

5

think that the assignment provisions limit the

6

permissible assignment as a matter of Federal law by

7

reason of the anti-lien statute.

8
9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

assignment provision as such that limits it, is there?

10
11

But there's nothing in the

MR. BLAIR:

Other than its language as to

what it's for.

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, it said -- I'm looking

13

at 1396k(a)(1)(A), which refers to assign to the State

14

any rights to payment for medical care from any third

15

party.

16

MR. BLAIR:

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

18
19

Yes.
There's no limitation in

that.
MR. BLAIR:

Payments -- the right to payments

20

for medical care, which we believe is the language of

21

limitation in that the State is -- in effect, is

22

seeking an assignment of the entire cause of action not

23

just that that is related to the right to payment for

24

medical care, which is simply a component of the claim

25

that may have 5 cents on the dollar value or 100 cents,

depending on what the facts of the case are.

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is there any reason

3

that the Federal law would have to act as a limitation

4

on the State law?

5

the Federal law your way, is there any reason it would

6

frustrate the Federal purposes for the State to say,

7

well, we want to get all of the medical expenses?

8

don't just want to get the proportionate share of the

9

recovery.

16

That -- that's enough for the Feds, but we

They can go further, can't they?
MR. BLAIR:

statute.

We

are also out State money and we want that State money.

13

In other words, if we read the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

In the absence of the

anti-lien.
MR. BLAIR:

In the absence of the anti-lien

17

statute, the State statute would be, in my opinion --

18

the State would be allowed to take a greater lien than

19

provided by Federal law.

20

there, and we say that that is the stopping point.

21

Federal anti-lien statute gives protection to the

22

recipient's property as to which these assignment

23

statutes are an implied exception, but the exception

24

must be limited by the --

the State tries to get around that by saying it never

reason of the assignment provision, all choses in

action automatically vest in the State, causes of

5

action arising out of transactions in which there's a

claim for Medicaid compensation.

7

MR. BLAIR:

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I -- I -But you say -- you say they

9

can't do that because, at the time the accident occurs,

10

you don't even know that there's going to be a claim --

11

MR. BLAIR:

I say -- excuse me, Your Honor.

12

I say that that is a fiction because what it attaches

13

to is the cause of action that existed instantly at the

14

time of the injury, and so say, no, you don't own that

15

because it was assigned to us.

16

something to assign, otherwise assignment was

meaningless.

Well, we had to have

We -- in -- in summation, as I see the white

light is on, we believe that this case -- and it is

Respondent's position that these three statutes that we

21

have been discussing here are plain and unambiguous and

that the case should be resolved upon the basis of the

statutory language.

results that that takes place.

liability of the third party can be considered to be

And it makes sense because

Such hearings would be incredibly

is money that could be going into the Medicaid program.

The State would have

parties is put back into the Medicaid program, and if

the State has to keep hiring more lawyers and has to

have administrative hearings or proceeding in judiciary
