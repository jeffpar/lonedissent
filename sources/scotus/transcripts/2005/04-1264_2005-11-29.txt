ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER LANDAU

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. LANDAU:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case presents the question whether a

11

party can avoid arbitration by challenging the validity

12

of the underlying contract containing an arbitration

13

clause as opposed to the arbitration clause itself.

14

We believe that this Court answered that

15

question almost 40 years ago in Prima Paint.

16

Florida Supreme Court tried to distinguish Prima Paint

17

on State law grounds, holding that the challenge at

18

issue there, fraud in the inducement, would have

19

rendered the contract voidable under State law, whereas

20

the challenge at issue here, illegality, would have

21

rendered the contract void under State law.

22

The

We respectfully submit that this distinction

23

misses the point.

24

avoid arbitration by challenging the validity of the

25

underlying contract as opposed to the arbitration

Prima Paint held that a party cannot

3
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

clause because an embedded arbitration provision is

2

severable from the underlying contract as a matter of

3

Federal substantive law.

4

law ground, on which the underlying contract is

5

challenged, and the State law severability implications

6

of that challenge are irrelevant.

7

Thus, the nature of the State

What matters, as a matter of Federal law, is

8

that a challenge to the underlying contract does not

9

allow a court to deny arbitration.

Rather, that

10

challenge must be presented to the arbitrator in the

11

first instance.

12

That point, we submit, is dispositive.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You -- you concede,

13

though, that if -- if the challenge to the underlying

14

contract implicates the arbitration clause as well,

15

that that is for the court and not the arbitrator.

16

MR. LANDAU:

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Your Honor, we -In other words, you

18

know, you put a gun to the person’s head and say, sign

19

this contract, and the person does.

20

arbitration clause.

21

arbitration to challenge that.

22

It contains an

They don’t have to go to

MR. LANDAU:

Your Honor, we concede that

23

there is asterisk, as we put it in our brief, to the

24

otherwise bright line rule set down in Prima Paint,

25

that rule being if you’re challenging the arbitration

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

clause, you can stay in court, but if you’re

2

challenging the underlying contract, you have to go to

3

arbitration, precisely along the lines that Your Honor

4

identified where the challenge to the underlying

5

contract involves the parties’ assents to the

6

underlying contract, that challenge necessarily

7

challenges your assent to arbitration.

8

the whole premise of arbitration in the first place is

9

that it’s a matter of consent, we would say that that

And given that

10

particular challenge, as the lower courts have

11

recognized since Prima Paint, an assent-based challenge

12

to the underlying contract, is again an -- an exception

13

or an asterisk to the otherwise bright line rule.

14
15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Does -- does that include a

quarrel over offer and acceptance?

16

MR. LANDAU:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Your Honor, I think -I’m -- we’re trying to

18

explore the -- the meaning of -- of this -- of this

19

assent.

20

want to try to see how we describe this area where it

21

is for the court.

22

I know there are going to be hard cases, but I

MR. LANDAU:

You’re absolutely right, Your

23

Honor, that there are going to be hard cases.

24

could just start by answering that by saying I think

25

one thing that’s clear is that this case is not one of

4

The challenge to the underlying

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What about offer and

acceptance?

5

MR. LANDAU:

I think generally when you’re

6

not saying I didn’t agree to the underlying contract,

7

in other words, where you’re not saying that’s a

8

forgery or the -- the person who signed that didn’t

9

have authority, where you’re -- where you’re really --

10

where you’re not challenging factual agreement to the

11

underlying contract, then it’s fair game to send you to

12

-- to arbitration because when -- you factually agreed

13

to -- to arbitrate.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:
letter.

You misinterpreted my

It was not an acceptance.
MR. LANDAU:

You misinterpreted my letter.

17

The -- there was no acceptance at all.

18

that that’s -- that would fall within the scope of this

19

potential asterisk because you’re basically saying I

20

never agreed to any contract at all.

21

would think under those circumstances, the whole

22

premise of the Prima Paint rule that -- that’s once

23

you’ve agreed to arbitration, you can let the

24

arbitrator decide your grievances with the underlying

25

contract is not present.

I would think

So, therefore, I

JUSTICE O’CONNOR:

Well, Prima Paint did,

2

though, involve what we would characterize as a

3

voidable contract.

4

MR. LANDAU:

5

JUSTICE O’CONNOR:

Your Honor, that is not -And I think it is

6

conceivable that the Florida court was correct that you

7

could draw the line some way and say contracts that are

8

void should be handled differently.

9

MR. LANDAU:

Your Honor, two responses to

10

that.

11

the point to talk about the nature or the -- the State

12

law severability implications of your challenge to the

13

underlying contract because the insight to Prima Paint

14

is that you treat the arbitration clause --

15

At the most fundamental level, I think it misses

JUSTICE O’CONNOR:

Yes, but voidness is a

16

question of public policy.

17

decision that certain contracts can’t be entered into.

18
19
20

The State itself makes a

And the question of voidability is usually one
affecting the -- the will of the contracting party.
MR. LANDAU:

Your Honor, you’re entirely

21

correct, and I think again the -- the insight of Prima

22

Paint is that you are perfectly able to present your

23

challenge to the underlying contract.

24

who is the person to -- which is the forum in which you

25

present that?

The question is,

Are you allowed to -- to present that in

7
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

court or -- or are you relegated to -- or are you

2

required to submit it to the arbitrator pursuant to

3

your agreement?

4

court recognized that if you allow parties to avoid

5

arbitration altogether by bringing whatever challenges

6

they may have to the underlying contract, whether it be

7

fraud in the inducement or illegality or -- you know,

8

there are obviously any number of grounds for

9

challenging contracts under State law -- you

And -- and I think the Prima Paint

10

effectively vitiate the arbitration agreement, the --

11

the whole point of which is that we’re going to --

12

we’ve chosen the arbitrator as -- the arbitration as

13

the correct forum to resolve our dispute.

14

And -- and so again, as long as you are not

15

challenging arbitration specifically -- the arbitration

16

law specifically, then it’s fair game to send you to

17

arbitration, again where you are perfectly entitled to

18

raise the whole panoply of challenges that you may

19

have.

20
21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It’s -- it’s a little odd

that --

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Mr. Landau --- the way our -- it’s a

24

little odd that the way our cases have -- have worked

25

out is that we assume there’s two contracts, one for

8
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

arbitration and the other for the rest of the

2

contracts.

3

these cases.

4

That’s -- that’s the way we’ve rationalized
It seems a little odd to me.

MR. LANDAU:

Well, Your Honor, again, I think

5

the -- the Federal Arbitration Act, both section 4 and

6

section 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act, certainly

7

permits that -- that way of looking at it because

8

section 4, as Prima Paint emphasized, says, you know,

9

once the making of the arbitration agreement is clear,

10

it must go to arbitration.

11

arbitration provision in a written contract -- or the

12

written provision in a contract that shall be valid and

13

enforceable.

14

distinguish between the arbitration provision

15

specifically and, in fact, treat it as an underlying

16

contract.

17

And section 2 says it’s the

And so, both those provisions do

And again, I don’t think there’s any shame in

18

admitting that Prima Paint, I think, recognized the

19

important policy implications of a contrary rule, that

20

--

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Landau, maybe this --

22

this is a point your -- the respondent makes.

23

Paint talks about section 4 and it says, with respect

24

to matters within the jurisdiction of the Federal

25

courts.

Prima

So the answer to everything you said could be,

9
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

fine, if this were proceeding in, say, the Southern

2

District of Florida, but it’s in a State court.

3

Prima Paint just spoke about procedure in Federal

4

court.

5

MR. LANDAU:

And

Your Honor, it is certainly true

6

that Prima Paint itself arose from Federal court and

7

that the decision is, I think, rather carefully written

8

to talk about Federal courts as a -- in fact, Justice

9

Harlan concurred in Prima Paint to say he would have

10

affirmed the Second Circuit in that case on the basis

11

of the Lawrence case, which said that this rule applies

12

in Federal and State court, the FAA.

13

But the Court was obviously unwilling in

14

Prima Paint to cross the bridge of saying that our rule

15

applies in State court.

16

that’s why it’s written in that way of -- of focusing

17

on section 4 and not really specifically addressing

18

section 2.

And I think that, frankly,

19

This Court, however, subsequently confronted

20

that issue head-on in the Southland case and held that

21

the substantive provisions of the Federal Arbitration

22

Act, really relying on Prima Paint for the proposition

23

that the -- the Federal Arbitration Act does create

24

Federal substantive law enacted under the commerce

25

power -- it says that that rule -- those rules of

10
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

substantive arbitration law apply in State as well as

2

Federal court because you really wouldn’t want to

3

attribute to Congress kind of a -- a reverse Erie

4

presumption of creating substantive Federal law that

5

applied only in diversity cases in Federal court which

6

would then promote forum shopping between Federal and

7

State courts.

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What -- what’s wrong

9

with the argument that when you’re dealing with a void

10

contract, as opposed to a voidable one, that the State

11

policy is that you don’t enforce any aspect of it?

12

mean, if you and I had, you know, a contract for murder

13

and it had an arbitration clause, it’s pretty strange

14

to send that to an arbitrator and enforce part of that

15

contract as opposed to saying that the contract as a

16

whole is void.

17

MR. LANDAU:

I

Not really, Your Honor, in the

18

sense that the -- the insight of Prima Paint, again, is

19

that you treat the arbitration clause as separate from

20

the underlying contract.

21

So --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But we don’t do that

22

with other provisions of void contracts.

23

our contract had a liquidated damages clause -- if you

24

didn’t go ahead and murder somebody, you’d owe me

25

$1,000 -- we don’t say, well, that part is enforceable

I mean, if

11
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

even if the contract as a whole is not enforceable.

2

treat it as a whole.

3

contract is illegal ab initio, the whole contract is --

4

is void and illegal.

5

MR. LANDAU:

We

Because the subject matter of the

Your Honor, that is certainly

6

one plausible world view that one could have taken as

7

an initial matter when confronting this issue.

8

it’s a little bit like a chicken and egg issue here.

9

You have got the underlying contract, which contains an

I mean,

10

arbitration provision, and one could certainly say, as

11

Your Honor just did, that well, if the underlying

12

contract falls, it seems perfectly sensible to say that

13

everything falls.

14

that approach in Prima Paint.

15

This Court specifically rejected

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Of course, you could say the

16

same thing about a voidable contract.

17

you know, the whole contract is voidable.

18

MR. LANDAU:

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You could say,

Well, in fact -I mean, in -- in that

20

respect, a contract that’s void is no different from a

21

contract that’s voidable.

22

MR. LANDAU:

In fact -- exactly.

The -- in

23

Prima Paint itself, it was far from clear that the

24

rescission suit that was sought there -- in other

25

words, when a contract is -- is voidable, basically

12
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

what that does is that -- under general common law

2

principles, that creates an option for the aggrieved

3

party.

4

contract or it can seek to rescind that contract.

5

when you seek to rescind it, basically you’re saying it

6

was void ab initio, which is exactly what Justice Black

7

said in his dissent in Prima Paint.

8

And that party can either seek to affirm that

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And

You also run into a

9

problem with the -- some States classify a contract as

10

voidable and other States for that same ground make it

11

void.

12

uniformity if you’ve made the distinction between those

13

two.

14

So at least you would have -- you would lose the

MR. LANDAU:

You are absolutely right, Your

15

Honor, and I don’t think this Court should lose sight

16

of the bright line importance of the Prima Paint rule.

17

But in a sense, Prima Paint again is a rule of Federal

18

law.

19

Federal law approach taken by the First Circuit as

20

opposed to the State law approach, which I think was a

21

little bit like Your Honor’s hypothetical, the Chief

22

Justice’s hypothetical.

23

The Court in that case specifically affirmed the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Do we usually -- do

24

we usually ask arbitrators to enforce broader notions

25

of public policy as opposed to the specific agreements

13
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

of the party?

2

contract is void or voidable has to do with broad State

3

public policy, do we -- what -- what’s this -- the best

4

you case you have for the notion that arbitrators

5

enforce those types of constraints as opposed to

6

figuring out what the parties agreed to?

7

In other words, if the reason the

MR. LANDAU:

Oh, sure, Your Honor.

I think

8

if you think about the Mitsubishi case, all the cases

9

that sent statutory cases to arbitrators and said that,

10

you know, RICO claims or antitrust claims could be

11

arbitrated, I think initially the -- the argument that

12

was made against that was precisely the one Your Honor

13

is making, that, gee, arbitrators have expertise in the

14

specific commercial agreements here, but we don’t

15

expect them to be knowledgeable about RICO or -- or

16

other statutes.

17

But I think the insight of the cases, really

18

over the last 30 years in this Court, is that

19

arbitrators are perfectly able and certainly have to be

20

presumed to be able to decide legal and public policy

21

questions.

22

And I think if you -- again, if you go the

23

other way and you say, well, we’re going to allow

24

challenges to the arbitration clause, we’re not going

25

to allow it to be enforced, I think you are really

14
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

going to declare open season on arbitration in the

2

sense that it is -- as a logical matter, there is no

3

way to limit the principle that the other side is

4

proposing to challenges based on illegality, which is

5

what they’ve tried to -- to cabin this off as.

6

Basically -- and I think the Florida Supreme

7

Court was very forthright about this -- they said it’s

8

any challenge that leads to the contract being void as

9

a matter of State law.

And in fact, the -- the

10

respondents in their brief in this Court really admit

11

that it’s any challenge that goes to contract

12

formation, the formation at all of the underlying

13

contract.

14

like consideration, mutuality, anything that could be a

15

ground for that.

16

So they would presumably sweep in all things

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What would be the issues

17

for the arbitrator in this case?

18

other than was it -- was this interest usurious?

19

dispute between the parties -- we’re not told what the

20

issues are that would be subject to arbitration.

21

MR. LANDAU:

Is there anything
The

That is the key issue, Your

22

Honor.

23

interest in the contract is usurious, in violation of

24

several Florida statutes.

25

They are essentially saying that the underlying

And again, one thing that is important to

15
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

keep in mind is that there is no question that these

2

issues now, the practices that they’re complaining

3

about, are entirely legal in Florida today.

4

an act passed in 2001 that clearly made all this legal.

5

The only issue is they’re saying it was illegal prior

There was

6

to enactment of that statute and whether or not that

7

statute clarified the law or changed the previous law.

8

But presumably the arbitrator would be asked

9

to decide is -- was the law in Florida prior to 2001

10

such that -- that these other statutes that limited --

11

that limited interest applied here.

12

dispute is really about whether these charges are

13

interest or whether it’s a service fee for cashing a

14

check.

15

that’s certainly one that the arbitrator is capable of

16

deciding --

The underlying

That’s the heart of the underlying dispute, and

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

18

MR. LANDAU:

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Did the arbitrator --

-- looking to Florida -Could the arbitrator decide

20

that I’m -- I’m going to apply the new statute rather

21

than the old one?

22

MR. LANDAU:

Well, I think the arbitrator

23

will say, you know -- first of all, if I could just

24

make one point clear for the record.

25

the underlying issue here, whether or not this 2001

The -- this --

not involve arbitration.

5

It was

So presumably, the arbitrator, if this case

6

goes to arbitration, will look at that case and will

7

decide whether or not that governs this case, will

8

decide is there any ground for distinguishing this

9

case.

10

And -- and, you know, one point to remember

11

is that when you go to arbitration, that’s not the end

12

of the line.

13

arbitration.

14

You have rights to judicial review of

So going back to your hypothetical, Mr. Chief

15

Justice, if the -- if the contract were to be, let’s

16

say, for murder -- that’s a favorite example of -- of

17

respondents -- that does not mean that a contract for

18

murder gets enforced.

19

will decide whether the contract for murder is -- is

20

valid under State law and -- again, this is in the

21

farfetched situation where somebody who has signed a

22

contract for murder is actually trying to enforce

23

arbitration, you know, presumably from his or her jail

24

cell --

25

That means that the arbitrator

to enforce arbitration, and then if -- you know, if the

arbitrator says it’s illegal, would -- you know, even

4

if the arbitrator were, in the most fanciful situation,

to say, yes, this contract for murder is legal under

the law of our State, well, then presumably you could

go up for manifest disregard review.

It is what they

They are saying these contracts

court should decide that underlying question as a

21

threshold matter.

22

whatsoever left for the arbitrator to decide, and they

23

have effectively vitiated the arbitration agreement.

24

And again --

25

Well, then there’s actually nothing

Oh, no, that’s not

true. There may be dozens of other subsidiary issues

apart from illegality.

determine that it’s legal, we think that we’re entitled

4

to these damages or those damages or -- or the rate

5

should be this or that.

6

threshold issue doesn’t mean there aren’t other issues

7

that an arbitrator might decide.

8

MR. LANDAU:

9
10

They may say, well, once you

Just because there’s a

Well, Your Honor, I -- I guess

maybe it depends on how you look at the word threshold.
I mean, I would think that that is the core issue in

11

the dispute.

12

absolutely right that there could be some ancillary

13

issues like damages.

14

I mean, certainly there -- you are

But clearly, the -- the nub, the crux of

15

their challenge here is a challenge to the legality of

16

the underlying contract.

17

get to obtain judicial resolution of that issue in the

18

first instance, notwithstanding the fact that they

19

don’t dispute that they agreed to arbitrate all issues

20

relating not only to the validity of the arbitration

21

clause itself, but relating to the underlying contract.

22

And under their view, they

So there’s no question here -- and I think

23

this is really important not to lose sight of -- that

24

this dispute falls within the plain language of their

25

arbitration provision.

If you look at joint appendix

19
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

42, the arbitration provision here is very broadly

2

worded in this regard, and the parties clearly agreed

3

to do it.

4

State could frustrate the -- the plain, express intent

5

of the parties by saying, oh, well, this challenge

6

implicates arbitration -- implicates legality.

7

The only question is basically whether the

JUSTICE STEVENS:

If the case was one in

8

which the merits issue you claim is basically the same

9

as the legality issue under the contract -- but would

10

your argument be as strong if it were different, if you

11

had a different reason for claiming that the contract

12

was void or voidable?

13

MR. LANDAU:

The -- I think the argument,

14

Your Honor, would be the same.

15

particularly stark illustration here of the dangers of

16

the -- of -- of that position.

17

absolutely right.

18

the -- that the challenge to the contract is going to

19

be the merits dispute in itself, but I think where, as

20

here, it is, it really shows how pernicious this rule

21

is and precisely why the Prima Paint rule, which again

22

has been in effect almost 40 years now -- why that

23

approach works and actually promotes the policy

24

supporting arbitration.

25

It’s just -- it’s a

It may not -- you’re

It may not always be the case that

And when you -- again, when you think of an

20
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

alternative rule, it’s one in which you could come in

2

-- the party who has concededly agreed to an

3

arbitration clause and says, well, I think the

4

underlying contract is void on public policy grounds,

5

which again you can make in virtually any case.

6

the Florida Supreme Court’s rationale in this Court --

7

in this case, that is a basis for remaining in court,

8

and --

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Under

What about the possibility

10

that you always want a neutral decision-maker in cases

like this?

finding that the contract is valid and arbitrable

because that’s his source of business is arbitrating

14

disputes.

15

The arbitrator always has an interest in

MR. LANDAU:

Your Honor, you -- I think it’s

16

important to keep in mind that in this case, they have

17

not challenged the arbitrator.

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

No.

The reason -I’m just talking about

19

as a general matter if we’re trying to decide the issue

20

not just on these facts, but what is the better rule --

21

MR. LANDAU:

Your Honor, I don’t -- I think

22

that’s -- again, that -- if you were to have a

23

presumption that the arbitrator is always in favor of

24

upholding a contract, that would seem somewhat in

25

tension at the very --

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, no.

I mean, the

2

question is, I take it, in most of the arbitration

3

associations, once you have arbitration, you will get

4

paid even though -- the arbitrator will be paid, won’t

5

he, whether --

6

MR. LANDAU:

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

8

Oh, yes.
-- he decides one way or the

other?

9

MR. LANDAU:

10

Oh, I’m sorry.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Then yes.

So he has no particular

11

interest in getting paid in upholding the contract or

12

not.

13

MR. LANDAU:

You’re absolutely right, Your

14

Honor.

15

would think he would not have an interest in -- in

16

saying that a contract for murder is perfectly valid.

17

You’re absolutely right.

18

money in his pocket and it certainly would, I think,

19

lead to the reputation of a rogue arbitrator out there

20

who is not to be trusted.

21

person wouldn’t -- wouldn’t get much business.

22

That is absolutely clear.

And -- and again, I

It wouldn’t get him more

And -- and presumably that

Again, so I think that the key point here is

23

that the respondents have tried to create a lot of

24

State law issues regarding void, voidable.

25

I think as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, the problem is

And -- and

22
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

it’s kind of like trying to put a square peg in a round

2

hole, that whether something is void or voidable under

3

State law, which may vary from State to State, kind of

4

misses the whole point which is the genius of a Federal

5

separability rule is we don’t care about those State

6

law issues.

7

decide the arbitrability question or the -- you know,

8

you cannot avoid arbitration by simply coming up with

9

all those grounds.

You don’t have to get into that bog to

And whether it’s ground A for

10

challenging the underlying contract and whatever the

11

severability implications may be of ground A or ground

12

B, the point is when you’re not challenging the

13

arbitration clause, it’s fair game to send you to

14

arbitration, and then you can raise ground A or ground

15

B or whatever ground you have before the arbitrator.

16

And it’s simply not a basis for avoiding arbitration

17

altogether to be talking about that.

18

And again, the -- the point -- I think this

19

is all kind of a common-sensical point that you want to

20

get parties quickly to arbitration.

21

if you have a situation where the parties have to spend

22

years in court litigating these kind of issues, that

23

really, in and of itself, defeats the whole point of --

24

of arbitration.

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I mean, if you --

Well, Prima Paint certainly

23
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

displaced the States and State law from this area in a

2

very substantial -- to a very substantial extent.

3
4

I’m curious now.

Have there been any

attempts in Congress to overrule Prima Paint?

5

MR. LANDAU:

I’m not aware of any, Your

6

Honor.

7

Arbitration Act has been amended multiple times since

8

1967 and it has always been in a pro-arbitration

9

direction, as this Court emphasized in the Allied-Bruce

And to the contrary, I think the Federal

10

case where there was a concerted attack not on Prima

11

Paint, but on Southland.

12

And in a sense, Southland is really a -- a

13

reflection of Prima Paint because Southland simply says

14

that the -- the substantive Federal arbitration law

15

that was announced in Prima Paint sensibly should not

16

be limited to Federal court, but should also apply in

17

State court.

18

So I think the -- the Court faced a fork in

19

the road in Prima Paint about the meaning of the

20

Federal Arbitration Act.

21

provision that governed in -- in Federal proceedings

22

based on Congress’ power over the Federal courts and

23

their procedures?

24

enacted under the Commerce Clause?

25

the latter approach and made that absolutely crystal

Was it just a procedural

Or was it a substantive provision
And this Court took

24
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

clear in -- in Southland and then later again in

2

Allied-Bruce.

3

And so what I think the respondents are

4

really asking you to do here is to really overrule root

5

and branch the whole Federal substantive law of

6

arbitrability altogether and say, well, this should

7

just be -- you took the wrong path back in 1967 and --

8

and you should just interpret the FAA to be a -- a

9

procedural statute.

We would respectfully submit that

10

that would cause an earthquake in the law in terms of

11

arbitration and, therefore, would respectfully urge you

12

to reverse the Supreme Court of Florida’s judgment.

13

I’d like to reserve the balance of my time.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. BLAND:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
This Court has repeatedly said that Federal

22

law preempts State law only where Congress clearly and

23

manifestly intended for it to do so.

24

also repeatedly said that the best guide to what

25

Congress intended was the language of the statutes.

And the Court has

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Now, petitioners have not pointed to any

2

language of the Federal Arbitration Act itself that

3

would create a separability rule for this case.

4

moreover, the language of the act itself and

5

particularly section 2 -- and particularly section 2

6

the way it was followed in the Prima Paint case --

7

actually strongly supports us.

8

arbitration provision is enforceable if it is in a

9

contract evidencing interstate commerce.

10

And

Section 2 says that an

Now, to order of arbitration, they say, well,

11

the -- the threshold issue is whether there’s an

12

agreement.

13

order arbitration is to enforce the act.

14

enforcing the act.

15

before we’ve determined if section 2 is met, before the

16

requirements of section 2 are met.

17

--

18

Let’s have the arbitrator decide that.

To

That is

But they want to enforce the act

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That’s not the way

I guess what they

19

would say is that there -- they insist only that the

20

agreement be to arbitrate, and to the extent there is

21

an agreement to arbitrate, they can enforce section 2,

22

and the arbitrator can decide whether the broader

23

agreement is enforceable.

24
25

MR. BLAND:

That’s an argument.

The word

agreement was used in section 4, and that’s the -- that

26
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

provision, of course, is the provision that refers only

2

to the -- not only applies to the United States

3

district courts, that refers to jurisdiction under

4

title 28 and twice refers to the Federal Rules of Civil

5

Procedure, and that in the Southland case in footnote

6

10, this Court said doesn’t apply in the State courts.

7

Section 2 doesn’t use the word agreement.

8

Section 2 uses the word contract, Mr. Chief Justice.

9

And the word contract is a very different idea than

10

agreement.

11

interstate commerce or a transaction in interstate

12

commerce, perhaps they would have a point.

13

Court, instead, used -- excuse me.

14

instead, used the word contract.

15

the most important words in the law.

16

If section 2 had said an agreement in

But the

The Congress,
Contract is one of

Now, when the Court in Prima Paint looked at

17

this, in the first sentence, the very first sentence of

18

Prima Paint, the Court said this case involves a

19

contract involving the U.S. Arbitration Act.

20

the first sentence, the Court said this case is a case

21

involving contracting parties.

22

we’re going to see what the arbitrator thinks as to

23

whether there’s a contract.

24
25

And in

The Court didn’t say

In Prima Paint, this Court did it the right
way.

They said section 2 -- does it apply first?

1

if it does apply, only if once after we have crossed

2

that Rubicon will we go to the next step.

3

Then the Court in Prima Paint goes and

4

discusses whether or not the interstate commerce prong

5

has been met.

6

in interstate commerce or not, and they find that it

7

is.

8

And there’s a long discussion of is this

theory, why should the Court be deciding interstate

Arbitrator -- the interstate commerce issue

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why shouldn’t the

When I was working on the

14

first options in those cases, I thought there was from

15

Southland a pretty clear distinction between whether

16

the person is attacking the arbitration clause itself.

17

If he says that’s not valid, that probably goes to the

18

court, unless there’s some other special thing.

19

what he’s doing is attacking the rest of the contract

20

as illegal, that doesn’t.

21

But if

That goes to the arbitrator.

Now, I really did think that was the law.

22

And even if I was wrong in thinking that was the law,

23

it seems to me the whole community, the whole business

24

community in the United States thinks it’s the law.

25

Everybody else thinks it’s the law, and the briefs on

points about Southland.

JUSTICE BREYER:

And let me make two

I mean, logically you’re

I accept all that you’re saying logically.

You

10

could make those distinctions, but you also could come

11

out the other way logically.

12

what’s really bothering me about the case are two

13

things.

14

And so to expose to you

One, I think you’re worried about consumer

15

contracts, and there are a lot of good arguments on

16

your side.

17

But this rule also applies to business

18

contracts, and there what’s bothering me is that --

19

that the whole business community seems to have

20

developed an arbitration system throughout the world

21

that depends upon the distinction I just made.

22

we decide for you, we’re going to throw a large section

23

of those contracts back into the laws of the 50 States

24

and arbitration will be seriously injured as the

25

commercial community has come to rely on it.

And if

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Now, that’s what’s worrying me because I

2

wouldn’t want to reach a decision, in the absence of it

3

being clear anyway, that would make a significant

4

negative difference to the gross national product of

5

the United States, for example.

6

MR. BLAND:

go on with the statutory arguments --

Well, Your Honor, let -- before I

JUSTICE BREYER:

I’m putting it dramatically

because I want to get your --

10

MR. BLAND:

-- let me -- before I talk about

11

the statutory arguments, then let me go to the policy

12

arguments and this idea that we’re going to open the

13

flood gates and undermine the Federal Arbitration Act.

14

It is a minimal requirement to say that you

15

must have a contract in interstate commerce.

16

the Southland case, on page 10, at the bottom of page

17

10 and page 11, before it said that section 2 would

18

apply in States, Chief Justice Burger’s opinion for

19

this Court started off and said there -- we perceive

20

two limitations on arbitration -- on the enforceability

21

of arbitration provisions.

22

it does have to be in a contract in interstate

23

commerce.

24

oh, well, the question about whether or not there’s a

25

contract is something the arbitrator gets to decide.

And in

Mr. Bland.

-- Your Honor -Mr. Bland, some State may

say fraud in the inducement is void.

13

are classifications that States make.

14

that the State puts on them.

15

vast disuniformity if you say that the line to draw is

16

between void and voidable.

17

because the Prima Paint case dealt with voidable.

you -- that you -- you are drawing a line between void

19

and voidable which shifts from State to State.

20

MR. BLAND:

These -- these
These are labels

And you are introducing

You are forced into that
So

Well, the -- the -- Your Honor,

21

first, the Congress drew the line when it said that you

22

had to have a contract first as to whether or not a

23

contract came into existence.

24
25

But the law of contracts does not differ so
much from State to State.

This case in the American

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Airlines v. -- this Court -- excuse me -- in the

2

American Airlines v. Wolens case said that the law of

3

contracts is not largely disuniform from State to

4

State, and there is no State in the country that I know

5

of -- and I’m fairly certain of this -- that hold that

6

fraud in the inducement means that a contract never

7

came into existence.

8
9

And the reason for that is -- is that if
someone defrauds me into buying a stock or someone has

10

an unconscionable deal or almost any of the other

11

things that give rise to defenses to formed contracts,

12

one party has an option to get of out it.

MR. BLAND:

I think you will find, Your

Honor, if you look at the -- at the law that’s

10

developed around void ab initio contracts, that it’s

11

fairly rare.

12

where State courts have found that an entire line of

business is illegal, where State courts have found that

no contract ever comes into existence because of a

public policy.

But, Your Honor, there are

23

already a host of circumstances in which litigants

would like to be able to get out of contracts that do

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You’re giving the end

many of those, but --

19

How many cases have the lawyers gone into

MR. BLAND:

Courts may reject

Well, I think there’s no reason

20

to suspect that there’s going to be abuse in which

21

parties are going to come in and make frivolous

22

arguments that an entire line of business is illegal

23

and then -- and that that’s going to cause a flood gate

24

of cases into courts because courts have, with rule 11

and other similar rules, a lot of ways of getting rid

of those.

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. BLAND:

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, what about --

It’s very hard -You get rid of them after

5

frustrating the arbitration provision, the whole

6

purpose of which is to keep you out of courts.

7

I’d like to -- I’d like to ask you about your

8

argument on section 2, which --

9

MR. BLAND:

10

Please.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- appears at page 3 of the

11

petitioner’s brief.

12

you’re reading it, you say a written provision in a

13

contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce.

14

You say that has to be a -- a contract that is a valid

15

contract.

16

If you want to read it the way

Well, what do you do about the end of section

17

2 which says, shall be valid, irrevocable, and

18

enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or

19

in equity for the revocation of any contract?

20

would apply to -- to contracts that are not -- not void

21

but voidable.

22
23

MR. BLAND:

That

Exactly, and that’s the language

--

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So Southland was wrong.

25

MR. BLAND:

With all respect, Your

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

1

Honor, that’s the language that -- that the

2

separability rule in Prima Paint has been used to apply

3

to.

4

create an arbitration provision.

5

enforceable provision if it’s in a contract, but there

6

is an exception for general State contract laws that

7

provide defenses to a contract.

The first part of section 2 says this is how you

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

MR. BLAND:

You have an

Why?

That --

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

11

that weird distinction --

12

MR. BLAND:

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why would you make that --

Because that --- and treat the first part

14

of it as though it applies across the board to the

15

entire contract, but the last part of it, reading it

16

differently?

17

I -- I don’t understand that.

MR. BLAND:

The first part of it is the way

18

you -- the way you trigger the existing forceability

19

option at all is that it has to be in a contract in

20

interstate commerce.

21

Court went through interstate commerce rather than

22

leaving that for the arbitrator.

23

That’s why in Prima Paint the

The second part is once you have an

24

enforceable agreement, it may be subject to certain

25

defenses.

37
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

And then in Prima Paint, what this Court did

2

was it looked at section 4 of the act and it derived

3

from section 4 of the act, the one that only applies in

4

Federal court and refers to the Federal Rules of

5

Judicial Procedure, a rule of separability for these

6

kinds of defenses, for the defenses that arise in the

7

Savings Clause.

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It seems to me even if you

9

separate it, you still have the language, save upon

10

such grounds that exist in law or in equity for the

11

revocation of any contract.

12

language, the reference to contract in section 2, as

13

referring to two separate things, the contract without

14

the -- without the arbitration clause and the

15

arbitration clause alone, it seems to me section 2

16

doesn’t make any sense.

17

MR. BLAND:

Unless you take that

With all respect, Your Honor, I

18

think that the way that it makes sense is that the --

19

you get the threshold issue of getting through the

20

limitation, as this Court described it in Southland on

21

pages 10 and 11, of the limitation on the

22

enforceability of arbitration clauses of is it in a

23

contract in the first place.

24

first part is talking about.

25

That is the -- what the

Then separately the Court -- the -- the

38
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Congress had intended only a limited intrusion into

2

State law, as this Court said in the Volt case where it

3

said that this -- that there was not -- this is not the

4

National Bank Act.

5

There was no express preemption.

6

conflict preemption.

There was no field preemption.
There was only

7

And in the Allied-Bruce case, what Justice

8

Breyer’s opinion for the Court said was we recognize

9

that State law will play an important role for certain

10

contract defenses after the contract has first been

11

found to be enforceable.

12

I think that if -- if this jurisdictional

13

idea -- the way you get into the Arbitration Act, what

14

triggers that the Arbitration Act exists -- and this is

15

pretty much the language that’s used at the -- in the

16

bottom of 10 and top of 11 of Southland -- is that you

17

have an arbitration agreement that’s enforceable.

18

there is a but in which Congress left out an

19

alternative where you have specific challenges to how

20

the arbitration clause is formed.

21

a very workable system, but that’s also the way

22

Congress drafted the statute.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

Then

I think that that’s

It’s not -- the workability

24

of it depends on how many challenges you get to people

25

saying this contract is void, you know.

And if there

39
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

are a lot of them, then that takes a whole wide set of

2

cases out of arbitration and puts them into the courts,

3

just where they’re trying to escape.

4

don’t know the answer to how many, to be truthful, and

5

I suspect no one does.

6

And -- and so I

So I’m wondering if there isn’t another route

7

to the problem you’re getting at, which is, as I think

8

in other countries, you say there’s a doctrine of

9

kompetenz-kompetenz.

10

13
14

MR. BLAND:

No, I’m afraid I do not, Your

Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER:

It’s arbitration generally.

They don’t even look to see whether people agreed

15

about the arbitration clause.

16

goes to arbitration regardless.

17

You know what I’m

thinking of?

11
12

You know that?

It says arbitration.

It

Now, the safeguard is, A, maybe the

18

arbitrator will get it right or, B, if the arbitrator

19

doesn’t get it right, they have to come to court to

20

enforce it.

21

know, this arbitrator is out to lunch.

22

he has to be really out to lunch, but you could make

23

some distinctions there, you see.

24

is really a problem that arbitrators are upholding

25

illegal contracts, that might be the place to begin to

And at that point, you could say, you

MR. BLAND:

language before is this Court has always said not until

the case falls within section 2 will you then go and

15

enforce section 2, that you have to be in the act

before you apply the act.

2

we cited a number of cases of this in our brief and in

contract law professors’ amicus brief, there’s a number

of cases around the country.

the essence of the contract is that -- that it was to

do an illegal purpose, was that it was to violate a

that it is so extremely illegal that no provision of it

we are talking about businesses that are skirting

6

cases in which come -- someone comes in and say, hey,

business of car selling was void ab initio.

9

It’s a crime.

It’s 29

That’s why so many of these cases are payday
You don’t see a lot of void ab initio

The only example that’s supposed to show the

10

flood gates that has come from petitioner’s brief is

11

they cite to this Vacation Beach case in Florida.

12

what -- that was a case that involved was sort of a

13

uniquely Florida problem, but after a bunch of

14

hurricanes, they’ve had people come down who were

15

unlicensed contractors and they go and say we know how

16

to fix roofs and so forth and they do not.

17

people’s roofs blow off, and there have actually been a

18

number of people who have died.

19

And

And then

So the State set up a licensing regime that

20

was a licensing regime not designed to extort money

21

from businesses, but a licensing regime designed --

22

scheme based on safety and health and welfare of the

23

citizens and said, you can’t go into this line of

24

business without passing certain certifications.

25

So in that case, it was a declaratory

could be a crime.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But there’s no -- but

13

-- but why do you assume that that underlying

14

illegality taints the arbitration clause?

15

the arbitration clause that you would find in a

16

perfectly normal contract, and if you put it in the --

17

the contract of the sort that you’re hypothesizing, I

18

don’t see why this underlying substance of the contract

19

taints the enforceability of the arbitration clause.

of the statute is what draws the key link difference to

Under their theory, there’s no good reason

why in Prima Paint this Court spent all those pages

talking about whether interstate commerce was met.

8

wasn’t that for the arbitrator?

9

wasn’t for the arbitrator was that was something that

Why

The reason that that

10

went to the threshold issue of whether section 2 had

11

been met.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Are you saying then if

13

this case, the case that was brought in Florida, had

14

been brought or removed in -- more likely removed

15

because there was diversity, removed to the Federal

16

court, the Federal court should do just what the

17

Florida Supreme Court did?

18

say, well, we’ve got our instructions from Prima Paint?

19
20
21

Or would the Federal court

It says excise the arbitration clause.

If that’s

okay, we decide the other questions.
MR. BLAND:

Your Honor, in this case I

22

believe that the answer is that you would have the same

23

result in State court or in Federal court.

24

reason I believe that is because section 2 makes the

25

existence of a contract a precondition, and you don’t

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Doesn’t it -- doesn’t it

3

follow from -- from that theory of yours that in every

4

case you are entitled to a judicial determination, not

5

an arbitrator’s determination, but a judicial

6

determination that this was a contract evidencing a

7

transaction involving commerce?

8

MR. BLAND:

9

Yes, we do believe that, Your

Honor.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Wow.

So in every -- every

11

case, the person who -- who is being brought to

12

arbitration can say, I deny that interstate commerce is

13

involved in -- in this -- in this contract and I want

14

to have a -- a judicial determination of it.

15
16

MR. BLAND:

And of course, in the Efabco case

--

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

18

MR. BLAND:

Well, I mean, that’s --

Well, that -- this Court 2 years

19

ago in 2003 in the Efabco case, the Alabama Supreme

20

Court had developed a practice of finding that lots of

21

contracts didn’t involve interstate commerce and

22

interstate commerce didn’t reach to a lot of things.

23

And this Court just 2 years ago said this is an issue

24

for the court and there is interstate commerce here and

25

they -- they -- and this Court -- I can’t remember the

47
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

phrase -- per curiam.

There was no need for an

2

argument or whatever.

The Court just came in and

3

resolved it --

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

5

for the court.

6

case?

You said this was an issue

Was there an alternate forum in that

7

Was it an arbitration case?
MR. BLAND:

This was an arbitration case, and

8

the Alabama Supreme Court had said that we’re not going

9

to enforce the Federal Arbitration Act, and Alabama is

10

one of the three States that has -- that has a State

11

statute that bars it.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

I had thought that the

13

interstate commerce question was like Crowell v.

14

Benson.

15

And in fact, if you can’t -- if there’s not the

16

constitutional -- if there’s not the connection with

17

interstate commerce, Congress, at least arguably, would

18

lack the constitutional power to tell the State court

19

what to do in this case.

20

there is a difference between that kind of fact and the

21

kind of fact that goes to whether the -- the contract

22

is void ab initio.

23
24
25

You know, it’s like a constitutional fact.

MR. BLAND:

So it’s not as surprising if

But it -- but it is also a

statutory fact, Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, it is.

It’s both.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. BLAND:

both.

3

concede that.

It is a constitutional fact.

4
5

It’s a fact that the statute says
I certainly

Justice Ginsburg, I believe I did not answer
-- I’m sorry.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The question isn’t whether

7

the court can -- can determine that fact.

8

if the arbitrator determines it incorrectly, you can

9

take it to court.

Ultimately,

But the question is whether in every

10

arbitration case, you can go immediately to court to

11

have that question of interstate commerce or not

12

determined.

13

wrench into the whole system, it seems to me.

14

And that would really throw a monkey

MR. BLAND:

Your Honor, it’s -- it would not

15

throw a monkey wrench because it’s exactly what

16

happened in Prima Paint.

17

started off and before it enforced the Arbitration Act,

18

before it got into what it called the main issue and

19

started talking about what does section 4 mean, this

20

Court first went and did the entire interstate commerce

21

analysis.

22

we’re in section 2 first and described that.

23

the monkey wrench.

24
25

In Prima Paint, this Court

This Court said, we’ve got to figure out if
It’s not

It’s exactly what’s happened.

And in the Efabco case, it was a issue for
the Court.

To say that now, whether or not section 2

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

exists except for the assent agreement, but everything

2

else about a contract and everything else about

3

interstate commerce would suddenly be for the

4

arbitrator, that is an exact shift from what this Court

5

did in Prima Paint, and it’s a shift from what Chief

6

Justice Warren Burger said in the -- in the Southland

7

case, that this is a prerequisite.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Once the case is in the

question.

12

have to go first to the court before it goes to the

13

arbitrator, and -- and Prima Paint doesn’t decide that

14

question.

15

Once it is in the court.

MR. BLAND:

And it was in the

The question is does it

Well, where these cases come up

16

again and again, Your Honor, is someone brings a

17

lawsuit in court and then there is a motion to compel

18

arbitration and there is a challenge to that motion.

19

There are next to no challenges anywhere in the country

20

right now in the -- after your decision 2 years ago, in

21

which anyone is saying, oh, this transaction doesn’t

22

involve interstate commerce.

23

There are going to be a small number of

24

challenges involving companies operating at the edge of

25

legality and maybe a tiny number of challenges

50
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

involving consideration where people are going to be

2

able to say there’s no contract at all, there’s not

3

even a -- there’s not even the beginning of a contract

4

here.

5

the -- of those, but there’s going to be some cases,

6

mostly involving the payday lending industry, but

7

they’re just aren’t dozens of businesses out there

8

where there is a conceivable, plausible, colorable

9

argument that the whole line of business is violating

10
11

There’s not going to be a wealth of hundreds of

the law.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

Mr. Bland, I’m curious to

12

know if you agree with your opponent that whoever

13

decides it, an arbitrator or a judge, it’s really going

14

to be decided by the Florida Supreme Court in the next

15

couple of months.

16

MR. BLAND:

I think that the question of

17

whether or not this is illegal will be something that’s

18

decided by the Florida Supreme Court, but that question

general rules of State contract law are going to be

tossed overboard is really going to be a dramatic

5

change for this Court -- for this Court’s

jurisprudence.

7

In case after case, this Court has said

8

arbitration clauses are as enforceable as other

9

contracts, but no more so.

And that was the basis of

10

this Court’s ruling in the EEOC v. Waffle House case

12

Waffle House was saying arbitration clauses are sort of

super contracts.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

Mr. Landau, I’d like to know

how you read section 2.

MR. LANDAU:

What -- what meaning do you

Your Honor, I think the word

4

contract is not a precondition in the sense that

5

respondents talk about in the sense that the court has

6

to look into whether it’s a valid contract with all the

7

bells and whistles of State contract law because I

8

think that is entirely inconsistent with Prima Paint.

9

I think the -- the answer is --

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But State law -- the

11

supposition is that State law provides that in this

12

case, the usury context, whatever, you do not have a

13

contract.

14

and voidable.

15

That’s the difference between void ab initio

MR. LANDAU:

Your Honor, I think the point is

16

that it -- the key part there is -- I think Justice

17

Breyer was getting to this -- that it has to be a -- a

18

contract that evidences interstate commerce to have the

19

hook of commerce power for the FAA to apply in the

20

first place.

21

commerce power.

22

That was enacted under the substantive

really where they’re hanging their hats in this case to

State law for a valid underlying contract.

2

with that is that looking at it that way -- I think

3

this is the heart of this case -- that completely

4

undermines -- or the severability rule says, we’ve got

5

a different contract.

6

there, and you can raise your challenge to that

7

contract, but as long as you’re not challenging the --

8

the arbitration clause, then any challenge you have to

9

the underlying contract goes to the arbitrator.

10

The problem

The underlying contract is -- is

And again, I think the point is to say that,

11

well, they don’t deny that there’s a severability rule,

12

but to say that before you apply the Federal

13

severability rule, you have to go and look at the

14

underlying contract and ascertain all this is to deny

15

the Federal severability rule.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I -- I guess that respondent

17

uses the language in the way it -- he says it should be

18

used when he refers to a contract that is void ab

19

initio.

20

void ab initio, is there?

There’s no such thing as a contract that is

it -- it just doesn’t make sense to say that you have

2

to go through all the bells and whistles of looking at

3

the validity of the underlying contract if the whole

4

point of Prima Paint -- I think this goes back to what

5

the Chief Justice said is you just look at the

6

arbitration provision as a severable contract.

7

say that --

8
9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So to

But I -- his answer

would be, well, you only get to do that if you’re under

10

the Federal Arbitration Act in the first place, and if

11

you don’t have a contract, then you’re not under the

12

Federal Arbitration Act under State law.

13

MR. LANDAU:

You’re right, Your Honor.

I

14

think that’s the key point, that to say that the -- you

15

have to go to the -- the validity of the underlying

16

contract under State law and the severability

17

implications of the challenge to the underlying

18

contract before you -- before you even get to the

19

arbitration clause is essentially to negate the

20

severability of the arbitration clause because the

21

whole reason you’re looking at the underlying contract

22

is presumably to see whether or not the arbitration

23

clause can fall.

24

regime that says the arbitration clause is severable

25

from the underlying contract.

So they cannot logically have a

therefore this arbitration clause, which is separable

MR. LANDAU:

And you’re absolutely right,

12

Your Honor, and that was the lines that were drawn in

Prima Paint.

14

that was presented.

15

They said I’m bringing a rescission suit.

16

read what Justice Black said in dissent in Prima Paint,

17

he said there was no contract.

18

That -- that was the -- the real issue
They said there was no contract.
And if you

And this kind of goes back to what Justice

19

Ginsburg was saying, that to talk about the

20

implications, the severability implications, of

21

particular challenges under State law misses the point

that the Federal severability rule doesn’t depend on

State law.
