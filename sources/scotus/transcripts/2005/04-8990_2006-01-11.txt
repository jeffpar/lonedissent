Why don't you raise the

Is that better, Your Honor?
Not much.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

MR. KISSINGER:

19

The jurors who convicted Mr. House of first

20

degree murder heard that semen stains on the victim's

21

clothing matched Mr. House.

22

evidence which showed that not to be the case.

Thank you.

They didn't hear the DNA

23

The jurors heard --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Thank you.

Was that because there was

no such analysis at the time?

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

How many years ago was

this trial?

That's correct, Justice

MR. KISSINGER:

The trial, Your Honor, was

approximately 20 years ago.

7

The jurors who convicted Mr. House heard that

8

bloodstains on Mr. House's blue jeans matched the blood

9

belonging to the victim.

They didn't hear the

10

assistant chief medical examiner for the State of

11

Tennessee testify that the source of those bloodstains

12

was a sample taken during Ms. Muncey's autopsy, nor did

13

they hear --

MR. KISSINGER:

Found as a matter of

Justice Scalia, the court

23

made a conclusion that the blood which had spilt from

24

the tube had spilt after -- after the blood had been

25

tested.

It did not, however, make a factual finding.

It made a conclusion of law regarding that, Your Honor.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That -- is that a conclusion

of law?

4

MR. KISSINGER:

It is, Your Honor.

If the

5

Court were to look at the district court order, the

6

district court order was divided into two distinct

7

parts.

The first part --

8
9

JUSTICE SCALIA:
put it in.

I don't care what part it

The district court did not believe that the

10

blood on the trousers was a consequence of the spill

11

and that -- and that, therefore, blood was identified

12

on the inside of his trousers that was the blood of the

13

victim.

14

having heard the testimony.

15

That's what the district court believed,

MR. KISSINGER:

Your Honor, what the district

16

-- what the district court concluded as a matter of law

17

was that it -- that notwithstanding Dr. Blake's

18

testimony regarding the source of the blood found on

19

Mr. House's jeans, that that did not eliminate the --

20

eliminate the testimony of Agent Scott who said that he

21

saw blood on the jeans when he first -- excuse me.

22

me rephrase that because it's actually a critical

23

matter.

24

bloodstains on the jeans when he first picked them up.

What the district court did in that instance

was exactly the error that Mr. House has brought to the

2

attention of this Court, which is in the face of

3

evidence of innocence, the district court, simply

4

because it found some contrary evidence in the record,

5

found that Mr. House had failed to make his showing.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

On that point -- on that one

7

point, do you contend that the district court was

8

clearly erroneous?

9

MR. KISSINGER:

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Your Honor -On that one point of the

11

blood, of whether, indeed, his blood was on -- or the

12

victim's blood was on the inside of his trousers?

13

that one point, do you claim that the district court

was clearly erroneous?

instructed the district court to examine when it

a finding of fact, was clearly erroneous.

Despite all of that, you -- you can

MR. KISSINGER:

Your Honor, including not

14

only that testimony, but the testimony of the same

15

expert who made the statements which the Court just

16

cited, who said that she was unable -- that she was

17

excluding merely the direct spillage, the pouring of

18

blood onto the jeans, and conceded in her testimony

19

that the transfer stains which she observed, the type

20

of stains which she observed could, in fact, have been

21

-- that she had no opinion as to the cause of those,

22

only that it was the result of one object wiping

23

against another object.

1

that all of this stuff would -- would have made a

better case for the defendant here.

has been tried and both sides have put on all the

4

evidence they have, we have a -- a much different test,

5

and -- and that is whether any reasonable juror could

have found him guilty.

7

whether any reasonable jury could have found guilt.

8

agree it would have been a much closer case, but -- but

the burden you -- you have before us here is to

thing alone, I -- I find that a hard burden to bear.
MR. KISSINGER:

Justice Scalia, there --

16

there are two things which come into the -- into the

17

Court's analysis.

18

First is the Court is correct.

The burden is

19

quite high, and it's -- it's high for a reason.

20

justifiably high.

21

Your Honor.

22

I

It's

We don't shrink from that burden,

What we say is that along with that burden,

the Court also requires that the entirety of the

evidence be reviewed.

that's the nature of the -- the determination -- what

Your Honor, quite frankly, we

15

can't determine that -- that statement rests on

anything.

18

time they were received by the defense expert.

19

was opened.

20

shows clearly that one entire tube of blood is missing

21

and the second tube of blood has leaked within the

22

packaging.

The undisputed evidence in the record

A photograph was taken.

The box

The photograph

23

But the record also contains the testimony of

24

the TBI agent who transported the blood from the FBI to

25

the defense expert who said he observed no blood that

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

1

leaked other than the -- other than what was inside the

2

container.

3

It also contains the testimony of the FBI

agent who tested the blood at the FBI who said two

5

things.

6

a tube of blood and that no blood spilt while the tube

7

was in the possession of the FBI.

One, I used no -- no more than one quarter of

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And it also contained the

testimony of an expert who said that if the tube

10

spilled in that way, it would not have created the kind

11

of spatterings that -- that were incriminating in this

12

case.

13

produced the kind of spattering.

14

that a draw.

Even if there was some spill, it would not have

15

MR. KISSINGER:

So, you know, I call

Your Honor, two -- two things

16

to -- two things to point out there.

17

that eliminates only one possible hypothesis and that

18

is the hypothesis that blood was directly spilt onto --

19

onto the -- onto the jeans.

20

the expert gave was these are not stains, for example,

21

the pouring of a -- like coffee -- pouring coffee onto

22

the lap of your jeans or something like that.

23

are simply transfers:

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

and again, Your Honor, it comes to the could and would

2

distinction.

3

evidence of guilt, what would a -- but, however, that's

4

not the inquiry.

5

reasonable juror who heard that on one side, that it

6

didn't spill directly, but on the other side, heard the

7

evidence that we began -- that I began to discuss with

8

Justice Breyer, which is the evidence of the TBI agent,

9

the photographic evidence, the evidence of the FBI

Yes, it -- that could be considered

The inquiry is what would a

10

agent, the evidence that the Styrofoam box was opened

11

during transit to the FBI and that objects were removed

12

from it during transit.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I have two questions on the

14

blood, and there's a lot you want to cover here, so I

15

won't take too much of your time.

16
17

One, is it significant for your case that
this was a very small sample?

18

Two, was the evidence about the enzymatic

19

degradation -- was that available?

20

about that fully available to the defense at the time

21

of trial?

Was the science

22

I had those two questions.

23

MR. KISSINGER:

Justice Kennedy, in terms of

24

the -- the size of -- of the bloodstains, it was

25

significant to the extent that it bears upon the

11
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

probative value of the testimony of Charles Scott when

2

he says -- when he said he saw what he thought might be

3

stains.

4

were stained with a number of substances, not just

5

blood, and a number of witnesses, including the trial

6

prosecutor himself, described the bloodstains as

7

actually so small that they were difficult to detect by

8

the human eye.

9

As a simple matter of fact, this -- the jeans

The second part of your question, Justice

10

Kennedy, yes.

11

position is that it -- that goes actually to the

12

substance of our constitutional ineffective assistance

13

of counsel claim.

14

-- or his expert certainly had in his possession the

15

photograph that showed an entire tube of blood missing.

16

That evidence was available.

And our

17

wrong with the blood.

to suppress this blood evidence.

20

with evidence that blood is missing.

21

critical issue in the case and he failed to go out and

22

hire someone like the assistant chief medical examiner

23

for the State of Tennessee who came into Federal court

24

and testified as to the -- that the source of this

25

blood was, in fact, that empty tube.

1

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That -- that would be an

2

important point if, in fact, it conclusively

3

established that the blood was not the blood of the

4

victim, but I don't think it does conclusively

5

establish that, and if it doesn't, the -- the less than

6

perfect performance of counsel is -- is no basis for

7

setting aside the conviction.

8
9

MR. KISSINGER:
that.

Your Honor, two matters on

Again, the proof of innocence does not have to

10

be absolute.

11

that there is still some evidence of guilt or that

12

there still exists even substantial evidence of guilt

13

does not prevent a defendant from passing through the

14

Schlup gateway.

15

This Court stated in Schlup that the fact

The second matter and one which I think is

16

important is that as a matter of Tennessee law, a

17

circumstantial evidence case requires not only that the

18

prosecution prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt,

19

but that it eliminate all reasonable hypotheses of

20

innocence.

21

blood came during -- that the blood got on the jeans

22

during the course of the crime, it would also have to

23

be able -- it would also have to be probable that the

24

same jury would also conclude that it was an

25

impossibility for Mr. Blake -- Dr. Blake's testimony to

So even if a jury could conclude that the

MR. KISSINGER:

Ginsburg.

17

this case, when the blood came to get on Mr. House's

18

jeans.

19

The question has been, from the beginning of

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Right.

And -- and the point

20

of controversy is whether a spill of -- of the -- of

21

the blood in -- in the course of transport could have

22

produced this -- this kind of -- of spattering,

23

including a spattering on the inside of -- of the

24

trousers near the button.

25

unlikely, and -- and I am unable to say that no

It -- it seems to me

reasonable jury -- juror could not think it unlikely.

2

MR. KISSINGER:

Justice Scalia, I -- I would

3

disagree with -- with the Court's analysis there.

4

I think what -- what the issue here is more whether,

5

given the testimony of Dr. Blake, given the

6

corroborating evidence that supports Dr. Blake's

7

testimony, would a reasonable juror have doubts or

8

would any reasonable juror have a -- retain a

9

reasonable -- excuse me --

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

11

MR. KISSINGER:

12

Scalia.

13

instruction --

It's much more than that.
Let me rephrase that, Justice

The question is, given the Tennessee jury

JUSTICE BREYER:

15

have had to have a reasonable doubt.

16
17

I --

MR. KISSINGER:

Any reasonable juror would

Yes, thank you, Justice

Breyer.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

And you're

19

saying yes, any reasonable juror would have had to have

20

a reasonable doubt irrespective of what the trial judge

21

found.

22
23
24
25

MR. KISSINGER:

That's correct, Justice

Breyer.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So the -- so the --

we would have to be finding in this case, if we ruled

15
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

in your favor, that we think the trial judge is

2

unreasonable.

3

MR. KISSINGER:

Your Honor, that's actually

4

not correct either.

5

function of the district judge in a Schlup hearing is

6

not to make an independent judgment on the evidence in

7

front of him, but to make a probabilistic determination

8

of the effect of the evidence on a reasonable juror.

9

Schlup specifically says that the

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Oh, but surely he's supposed

10

to make factual determinations.

11

want to make factual determinations on all these

12

questions.

13

Those factual determinations are made by the trial

14

judge.

15

to accept his judgment as to what a reasonable juror

16

would have done, but I do think that we have to accept

17

his factual findings as accurate unless they're clearly

18

erroneous.

19

that blood was there before the transport.

20

think I'm bound by that unless you can show that it is

21

clearly erroneous, which I don't think you can.

We -- I -- I don't

That's -- that's not our system of law.

And here, I agree with you that we don't have

22

And here, he made the factual finding that

MR. KISSINGER:

And I -- I

Your Honor, first, we -- we

23

believe we have -- have shown that it's clearly

24

erroneous.

25

Second, even viewing the blood evidence

1

separately, even saying, well, Mr. House has put up

2

some evidence of -- some evidence of innocence

3

regarding this blood evidence, but not enough to really

4

sway me regarding that, that evidence itself has to be

5

viewed in light of the entire record.

6

the entire record, that blood evidence, standing alone

7

in its even somewhat compromised state, no reasonable

8

juror would be able to come to the conclusion that Mr.

9

House was guilty because the remaining evidence of his

11

And in light of

innocence is also very substantial.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Are you going to mention

12

any of the other, or are we going to just deal with the

13

blood today?

14

MR. KISSINGER:

Justice O'Connor, we -- we

15

would like to move on to -- to some of the other

16

evidence because it -- it is substantial.

17

set -- we've set out a lot of that evidence beginning

18

at page 6 of our reply brief.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And we've

Will you also cover,

20

because your time is short, if you get through the

21

gateway on your actual innocence contention, what are

22

your constitutional claims that lie behind it?

I don't think much was said about that in the briefing.

24

What is it that you would -- you would say if you got

25

through the gate?

1

MR. KISSINGER:

Justice Ginsburg, as -- as I

2

mentioned earlier, we believe that we have numerous

3

instances of ineffective assistance of counsel.

4

counsel's failure to -- upon knowing of the importance

5

of the blood evidence, which he clearly did because he

6

raised -- raised the issue himself, upon knowing of the

7

photograph showing the missing blood, he failed to go

8

forward and basically do what we did in Federal court,

9

which was hire an expert to look at the results of the

First,

10

FBI testing and to determine whether there was a viable

11

defense -- a viable defense strategy available there,

12

which he did not.

13

Also, if we look at the record in this case,

14

we have a situation where trial counsel also pointed

you're going to say is the State should have given us

evidence that they had that showed that Mr. Muncey had

sexual relations with his wife the morning of the

trial counsel attempted ineffectively at trial to -- to

show that -- that that semen belonged to Mr. Muncey.

there is either Brady for the State's failure to turn

As well, Paulette Sutton in the Federal

This wasn't microscopic.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So the things

Ms. Smith, could -- could

10

you go on to some of the other elements that are

contested here?

12

Mr. Muncey's confession.

13

do you say about that?

14

In particular, I'm interested in -- in

MS. SMITH:

What -- what do you -- what

Your Honor, I -- I think of all

15

the evidence presented below, I think that the

confession evidence is -- is perhaps the least reliable

17

in terms of -- of the Schlup analysis.

18

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

19
20
21

What did the jury hear

about Muncey's confession?
MS. SMITH:

The jury was never informed of

Muncey's confession because the --

22

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

23

MS. SMITH:

I thought not.

-- the fact of Muncey's

24

confession didn't come up until 13-14 years after the

25

trial had already been concluded.

And -- and that's

40
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

one of the things that the district court, in -- in

2

examining their testimony, found what was significant

3

in his --

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But wasn't the district

5

court incorrect in that?

6

there was evidence from one of the two witnesses who

7

put in the confession evidence that she had gone to the

8

sheriff's department to -- to tell them about the

9

confession and had simply gotten a runaround and

Because as I understand it,

10

finally left.

11

would not support the finding that -- that the -- the

12

sources of evidence simply kept silent for over a

13

decade.

14

So as I understand it, the -- the record

MS. SMITH:

Well, that's what the witness

15

testified to, Your Honor.

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, is there any reason

17

not -- did the -- did the district court explain that

18

it was rejecting that element of the witnesses'

19

testimonies?

20

MS. SMITH:

The district court did not

21

specifically address that element of the witnesses'

22

testimony.

23

that it was not impressed with the testimony of a

witness who waits.

many occasions that --

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I know, but without getting

2

to that point, it sounds as though the district court

3

simply made a mistake, just forgot I suppose, the

4

evidence that the witness didn't wait at all.

5

MS. SMITH:

Your Honor, regardless of whether

6

the witness waited or not, the Court examined the

7

credibility of the testimony and found that it wasn't

8

credible.

9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, but one of the reasons

10

for the finding of -- of incredibility was the decade

11

or more of silence.

12

MS. SMITH:

That was one of the reasons, but

13

the primary reason that the -- that the confession

14

itself was inconsistent with the other evidence, and

15

that was what the court specifically pointed to in his

16

opinion.

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, the -- tell -- help me

out here.

20

the body, but not to all of them.

21

there other disparities between the confession and --

22

and the -- and other evidence?

23

MS. SMITH:

As -- as has been explored earlier, the

Were there -- were

There were several disparities,

24

Your Honor.

25

apparently an extensive argument at home.

The confession indicates that there was
The

2

habeas corpus proceeding was that there was no such

argument.

4

incidentally, found her testimony to be very credible.

5
6

She heard no argument.

And the court,

He observed her demeanor and -- and found her
testimony to be credible.

7

So that's inconsistent.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, as far as that's

8

concerned, she did testify that there was a car out

9

there.

10

MS. SMITH:

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's correct.
And the rest of the story

12

doesn't -- doesn't put the defendant House at the time

13

of the crime in a car.

14

MS. SMITH:

He's walking.

Your Honor, the -- the testimony

15

at trial was ambiguous about the -- about the car.

16

witness identified two separate incidents.

17

car and she heard someone inquire as to Mr. Muncey's

18

whereabouts, and then she also heard an individual come

19

and tell her -- her mother that her father had been in

20

a wreck down by the creek and heard her mother leave

21

sobbing.

22

Muncey testified that she did not know whether she had

23

gone back to sleep.

24

define the specific length of time between the two.

25

The

She heard a

2

and ask where Mr. Muncey is and then to say, well, he's

3

down by the creek.

4

seems that just logically those are two separate

5

incidences, and there's nothing in the -- in the

6

testimony to indicate that -- that they're same.

It doesn't make sense for someone to come

No, Your Honor.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

-- the child testified to

11

what she heard, and I thought she heard a car and

12

someone in a low voice, and then her mother left with

13

that someone.

14

MS. SMITH:

No, Your Honor.

She heard a car

15

and someone inquire as to the whereabouts of her

16

father, and she heard her mother answer.

17

there was a period of time where she said she wasn't

18

sure whether she went back to sleep or not, and then

19

she heard a person with a low voice come in and inform

20

her mother that she -- that -- that her father, Hubert

She heard her mother sob and leave with the individual

who had relayed that information.

1

incidentally, found her testimony to be very credible,

2

found that her testimony did not support this -- this

3

theory of some sort of confrontation in the house.

4

In addition, the court also heard the live

5

testimony of Hubert Muncey, Jr. himself, explaining his

6

whereabouts, explaining -- and actually denying ever

7

having made the statement.

8

balanced that.

9

And -- and the court

As well, Dennis Wallace, who testified at the

10

evidentiary hearing -- he investigated a missing

person's report.

evidence of any sort of struggle in the home.

He was in the home.

He saw no

So all of these things balanced against this

14

-- this confession, which has absolutely no

15

corroborative support in the record, the court found

16

that the testimony simply wasn't credible.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

You tell me yes or no.

MS. SMITH:

It -- it could be consistent with

the confession.

5

-- there was a dispute between the two pathologists in

6

the habeas as to whether or not that -- that wound

7

could have been sustained by -- by falling and hitting

JUSTICE BREYER:

So overall, if -- looking at

bothering me -- I -- I see what that district judge

answer your question is if you are at that mental state

where you are saying maybe this evidence is right, maybe

47
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

or another, then I think the respondent prevails in this

case --

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, but that -- that simply

4

says if the -- it seems to me you're simply saying there

5

would be sufficient evidence to go the one way rather

6

than the other.

7

that, but that certainly is not the reasonable doubt

8

standard.

9

And -- and you may well be right about

MS. SMITH:

I think it goes beyond just

10

having sufficient evidence to convict, Your Honor.

11

think you also look at these credibility determinations

12

and you look at the probabilistic result of a

13

reasonable juror.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I

Justice Breyer has not heard

15

these witnesses and hasn't had the opportunity to know

16

whether -- whether, for example, these -- this

17

testimony about the confession was credible or not.

18

MS. SMITH:

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

20
21

That's correct, Your Honor.
And the hearer of -- at the

trial did have that opportunity.
MS. SMITH:

The district court heard both of

22

23

The district court heard Hubert Muncey, Jr. regarding

24

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But -- but may I interrupt

48
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

you?

2

something that Justice Breyer alluded to and that is

3

the significance of the DNA evidence.

4

tended to -- to think that a reasonable juror would

5

look at it this way, but if I'm wrong, I -- I want you

6

to comment on it.

7

What -- what about -- I want to just follow up on

And I have

One of the -- I -- I assume, to begin with,

8

that any reasonable juror would have found this

9

evidence, the evidence of the semen stains, extremely

10

significant because not only did the State argue rape

11

as a -- as a motive, possible motive, but there was a

12

specific finding of an aggravated circumstance that the

13

murder occurred in the course of kidnapping and rape.

14

I don't know of any evidence that would suggest an --

15

an independent kidnapping crime without the rape

16

element under, you know, the circumstances of -- of

17

this crime.

18

reasonable juror, having come to the conclusion that

19

that aggravating circumstance is true, found that a

20

rape was being committed.

21

So I'm -- I -- I assume that the

If that juror had heard the DNA evidence,

22

that juror would have said the only positive evidence

23

that a rape was committed here would be evidence that

24

pointed to the husband, not in fact to -- to the

25

defendant House.

And if -- if a juror had heard that

49
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

evidence, it seems to me it is highly unlikely that any

2

reasonable juror would have concluded that that

3

aggravating circumstance was found, and I suppose that

4

would play a -- a significant role in -- in the

5

ultimate conclusion.

6

Now, you have argued that the fact that the

7

DNA evidence shows that it was the husband's fluids,

8

not House's, doesn't conclusively prove that House

9

didn't rape her, and of course, you're right.

But my

10

understanding is that there is no evidence from which

11

one would reasonably infer that House did this.

12
13

Now, what is -- what is your comment on that
--

14

MS. SMITH:

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

16

MS. SMITH:

My comment -- sorry.
-- analysis?

My comment on the DNA evidence is

17

that the DNA evidence did nothing more than confirm

18

what the jury was -- already knew was very likely,

19

which was that the donor of the semen was the husband.

20

The jury at trial was informed that the husband -- and

21

it went through several pages.

22

it goes all the way from page 56 to 66 where we're

23

exploring that the semen could have been deposited by

24

the husband or by Mr. House.

kidnapping or rape or attempted rape.

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, then at -- at a

16

minimum, it seems to me that the sentencing phase is --

17

is in question by that.

18

But also, it seems to me if I were a juror

19

and was faced with these conflicting things, I would

20

look for motive.

21

MS. SMITH:

Your Honor, the motive is -- is

22

well supported by the circumstances.

23

you look at the prosecutor's argument --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And in fact, if

There is evidence of rape

No, sir, it wasn't.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

There was -But -- but the semen was

7

used to -- to connect it to the -- to the defendant,

8

and we now know that that's wrong.

9

MS. SMITH:

The prosecutor argued at trial on

10

the motive question, why else would someone lure a

11

woman out of her home with a lie in the middle of the

12

night in her night clothes and take her out into the

13

woods, if not to have some sort of --

The State put in the semen

evidence, Your Honor.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

They did that to prove

she had sex with her husband?

20

(Laughter.)

21

MS. SMITH:

Is that the reason?

The State put in the semen

22

evidence because it was -- it was not inconsistent with

23

Mr. House and that there was other evidence in the

24

record that was not -- all of the -- all this -- this

25

physical evidence was consistent with Mr. House, just

as the semen was.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Isn't it -Can I get back to

4

this -- the standard of review question?

5

goes directly to this point.

6

the argument based on the semen is not harmless error,

7

in other words, that the prior jury may well have

8

convicted based on that, we're not reviewing that

9

jury's determination.

10

MS. SMITH:

Because it

Even if you think that

Correct?
That's correct, Your Honor.

11

You're looking at how -- how a reasonable juror would

12

view the case if it knew --

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So we should be

14

looking at the case with the semen evidence showing

15

what we know it to show, regardless of whether we think

16

the prior jury was misled by the admission of that

17

evidence.

18

MS. SMITH:

That's absolutely correct, Your

19

Honor.

20

the semen belonged to Mr. -- belonged to Mr. Muncey and

21

not Mr. House, the result would be exactly the same

22

because Carolyn Muncey's blood was all over Mr. House's

23

pants.

24

25

If -- if the -- if a reasonable jury knew that

That is an indisputable fact.

of it at the sentencing stage.

MS. SMITH:

that was of significance.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN M. KISSINGER

12

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

13

MR. KISSINGER:

Very quickly.

Dr. Blake's

14

testimony was not, in fact, discredited.

15

respondent says that -- places great significance on --

16

on Dr. Blake's interpretation of the initials inc as

17

standing for incomplete penetration, and that --

18

correctly that should have been construed as

19

inconclusive.

20

-- record 4 of the district court, volume 6, page 906.

21

Agent Bigbee himself uses the term inc to mean -- or

Counsel for

Counsel fails to acknowledge the record

22

incomplete, just as Dr. Blake did.

23

Dr. Blake saying, yes, I meant the same thing as

24

Justice Breyer observed, Justice Bigbee himself uses

25

the term inc to mean incomplete.

So in addition to

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

appendix, he says inconclusive is what the inc stands

for.

which I haven't the foggiest idea what that means.

5

Dr. Blake testified it is incomplete penetration,

MR. KISSINGER:

And that's correct, Your

6

Honor.

7

for incomplete, and then Agent Bigbee at trial

8

proceeded to use incomplete and inconclusive

9

interchangeably just as Dr. Blake did.

In trial, he used -- he said that inc stands

10

In addition, when -- concerning Dr. Blake's

11

testimony, we have to remember that we still have the

12

missing tube of blood, and the blood on the jeans is

13

more consistent with blood coming from the degraded

14

blood sample than it is from blood which came -- got on

15

the jeans during the time of the offense.

16

The other thing, which I think is an

17

important matter to -- to keep in -- keep in mind

18

regarding Dr. Blake's testimony and Dr. Bigbee's, is

19

that Dr. Blake and Agent Bigbee both agree on the basic

20

science that blood enzymes deteriorate according the

21

various environmental factors and that as they

22

deteriorate, they become less detectable.

23

In terms of the -- the implicit credibility

24

findings, which respondent relies upon, the district

25

court during its opinion demonstrated that it know --

56
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

it knew how to make credibility findings.

2

made two specific credibility findings in this case

3

when it found Mr. House's testimony to be incredible

4

and the testimony of Lora Muncey to be credible.

5

In fact, it

As far as the -- the suggestion that, yes,

6

there was -- the crime scene was wet, that that -- that

7

there was water at -- or there's a possibility of mud

8

at the crime scene, not only is this contradicted by

9

the absence of the mud -- of mud on the victim's

10

clothing, but also the drizzling which counsel

11

described occurred on the day following the murder, not

12

before it happened, not at the time the murder was

13

occurring, but on the day following the murder.

14

fact, there was -- the murder scene was dry, just as

15

petitioner has informed the Court.

16

So, in

As far as the daughter not hearing any sign

17

of a struggle, the daughter's testimony was that she

18

did not hear any sign of a struggle when she got up

19

immediately after her mother left the home.

20

testimony at the evidentiary hearing, unrebutted and

21

unimpeached, was that at that point in time when she

22

was hearing nothing, her mother was, in fact, at the

23

C&C Recreation Center involved in a fight with Hubert

24

Muncey, Jr.

25

House's innocence because at the time she hears

nothing, she hears no sign of a struggle, is the very

2

time that the State of Tennessee contended that Mr.

3

House was out murdering Carolyn Muncey, and yet the

4

daughter who was outside of the home within 50 yards of

5

where this murder occurred heard absolutely nothing.

Justice Scalia asked was there, in fact,

other evidence of -- of rape.

bruises found on her thighs?

that the scratches on Ms. Muncey's thighs were more

likely attributable to her being dragged through the

brush and her body being hidden which, incidentally, is
