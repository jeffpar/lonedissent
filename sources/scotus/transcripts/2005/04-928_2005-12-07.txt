ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARY H. WILLIAMS

7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

8
9
10

MS. WILLIAMS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The eight amendment requires that a

11

sentencing jury in a capital case must consider

12

mitigation, which this Court consistently has defined

13

as related to a defendant's background, character, or

14

the circumstances of the offense.

15

Court in this case has broadly construed circumstances

16

of the offense to include evidence that is inconsistent

17

with the defendant's guilt.

18

constitutionally compelled and does not further the

19

purpose of having the sentencing jury consider

20

mitigation.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

22

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

24

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

25

The Oregon Supreme

That holding is not

Can you -Is it -Can you --- possible that the

Supreme Court of Oregon misapprehended some of the

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

facts in this case?

2

MS. WILLIAMS:

Justice O'Connor, it is

3

possible that the Supreme Court was not aware that

4

defendant's mother had testified in the --

5

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

6

MS. WILLIAMS:

Right.

-- guilt phase, and that's

7

because defendant did not raise that issue in the trial

8

court, did not move to have her alibi testimony

9

admitted under the State statute that would have caused

10

the Court to address her prior --

11

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

12

MS. WILLIAMS:

13

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

14

-- testimony.

MS. WILLIAMS:

16

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

18

-- need to vacate the

judgment and remand for that, or --

15

17

Do we --

No --- do we just go ahead and

-MS. WILLIAMS:

No, Justice O'Connor, I don't

19

believe that there needs to be any change in the

20

posture of the case in order -- in order for the Court

21

to address the Federal issue, and that's because the

22

significance of the Oregon Supreme Court ruling doesn't

23

turn on whether someone's testimony was admitted in the

24

guilt phase, or not.

25

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, under Oregon law, is

4
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1

it possible that some of the mother's testimony would

2

be otherwise admissible at the penalty stage?

3

MS. WILLIAMS:

Under Oregon law, under the

4

majority's holding in this case and the way they dealt

5

with the grandfather's prior testimony, on remand

6

defendant could have the mother's transcript from the

7

guilt phase read, but what would be different about it

8

under the Oregon Supreme Court holding, and what we're

9

asking the Court to address, is what they can do with

10

that alibi testimony, no matter what form it comes in.

11

And that's the significant part of the Supreme Court

12

holding.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I -- may -- I want

14

you, perhaps, to elaborate on that, as well.

15

perhaps the Respondent is the one to answer this

16

question.

17

they prevail in this case, would want to introduce the

18

mother's live testimony?

And

Do you understand that they, on remand, if

19

MS. WILLIAMS:

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

21

MS. WILLIAMS:

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

23

MS. WILLIAMS:

I am not sure.

Under the --

We're not sure --

-- Oregon Supreme --- all right.

-- Court holding, they would

24

certainly be free to introduce her live testimony.

25

It's very clear from the Oregon Supreme Court decision

5
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

that any alibi evidence comes in, and that's not

2

limited to evidence that was presented in the guilt

3

phase, or even witnesses who had been in the guilt

4

phase.

5

holding focuses on is how that alibi evidence can be

6

used in the remanded proceeding.

7

come in, and the primary statute on -- that they dealt

8

with for the grandfather's testimony is really a

9

statute that deals with admissibility of evidence --

And -- but coming back to what the court's

And not only does it

10

prevents the parties from having to go through making

11

foundations and other showings in order to get evidence

12

admitted.

13

defense counsel can argue, based on that evidence, that

14

the jury should consider the possibility that defendant

15

is innocent, as a mitigating factor in determining the

16

sentence.

17

But, under the Oregon Supreme Court holding,

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, can't you under --

18

look, first imagine that they don't want to introduce

19

one word from the mother's mouth that isn't already in

20

that transcript.

21

that's the circumstance, then I should think there is

22

no doubt, under Oregon law, that those words in the

23

transcript are admissible.

24

Oregon law -- and I'm not certain -- that, an ordinary

25

case, a death-eligible person does have the right to

Imagine that's the circumstance.

If

And I believe that under

1

argue in the sentencing proceeding.

2

that trial jury and you will see that there are doubts

3

as to whether this man is guilty or not.

4

am I right on the first part?

5

part?

6

MS. WILLIAMS:

Think back over

Am I right --

Am I right on the second

Justice Breyer, you are

7

correct on the first part, but not on the second part,

8

and that's because Oregon Supreme Court unanimously has

9

construed Oregon's law on mitigation to say that what

10

the Oregon Legislature intended was to have as

11

mitigation only those pieces that are required by the

12

eighth amendment.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

In other words,

14

prior to this case, in the State of Oregon, where there

15

was a death case -- maybe there weren't very many, but

16

where there was one, under Oregon law -- we have the

17

trial; immediately thereafter, the sentencing, and the

18

lawyer had no right to argue, under Oregon law.

19

back about your certainty as to whether this individual

20

is guilty.

21
22

MS. WILLIAMS:

That would be correct, Your

Honor, that --

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

24

MS. WILLIAMS:

25

Think

Yes, all right.

-- unless the eighth amendment

JUSTICE BREYER:

And did the court say, here

2

-- the Oregon court, in this case -- one, You can

3

introduce evidence, which it seems to have been

4

mistaken about, about not being there, but that,

5

second, the Federal Constitution gives you the right to

6

argue the residual doubt?

7

MS. WILLIAMS:

Yes, Your Honor.

And that's

8

most clear, from the dissent, as characterizing the

9

question that the Court is addressing.

And the Oregon

10

Supreme Court opinion is in the -- excuse me -- the

11

appendix to the cert petition.

12

of the appendix from the dissent, Justice Gillette

13

writes, "The issue in this case is whether under the

14

emphasized wording of that statutorily required jury

15

instruction," referring to the mitigation question,

16

"defendant was entitled to have the jury consider the

17

evidence that he proffered.

18

And at page 68

The majority says he was.

I disagree."

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

Ah.

"Consider the evidence"

20

is different from "making an argument about the

21

evidence."

22

majority opinion, is a statement that not only can this

23

evidence be introduced -- because, after all, in a

24

normal case, the jury's heard it --

25

And what I didn't see in the -- Oregon's

MS. WILLIAMS:

Yes.

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

JUSTICE BREYER:

It's the same jury.

But I

2

didn't see, anywhere, where they addressed the question

3

about what kind of argument the defense had the right

4

to make at the sentencing trial in respect to the

5

residual doubt that they might have from what they just

6

heard.

7

made that statement that you just said they made about

8

the argument?

Can you point, in that opinion, to where they

9

MS. WILLIAMS:

About the argument.

Where I

10

read -- no, I cannot point to specific language in the

11

majority opinion that says "and defense counsel gets to

12

make an argument based on this, and the jury must

13

consider that."

14

of how mitigating evidence must be treated once it is -

15

-

That comes from this Court's case law

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MS. WILLIAMS:

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

MS. WILLIAMS:

Yes, Your Honor, I -- our

2

position is that the eighth amendment does not require

3

that as a mitigating factor, that that is not one of

4

the circumstances of the offense, certainly not -- it

5

doesn't go to the defendant's character or background.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Ms. Williams, I don't -- I

7

don't understand all of this discussion about what the

8

-- whether the State law would have produced the same

9

result, or not.

We have never held, have we, that,

10

where a State Supreme Court opinion clearly rests on a

11

Federal ground, a Federal constitutional ground, we do

12

not have jurisdiction if there is a possible State

13

ground that would have left it -- led to the same

14

result?

15
16
17
18

Have we ever held that?
MS. WILLIAMS:

No, Justice Scalia.

In fact -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And we've said just the

opposite, haven't we?

19

MS. WILLIAMS:

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, Justice Scalia.
Well, that isn't the thrust

21

of my question, of course.

22

is that if, in fact, this evidence from the mother

23

comes in under State law, it comes in under State law,

24

because -- I have the cite; you know the --

25

MS. WILLIAMS:

The thrust of my question

Yes.

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- section I'm referring to.

If it comes in under State law, and they're not trying

3

to prove anything else, and the holding of the Oregon

4

Supreme Court is about what evidence is admissible, and

5

not about what arguments to be made, I don't see what

6

reason we would have to reach an issue that isn't in

7

the case.

8
9

MS. WILLIAMS:

And, Justice Breyer, I think

the primary reason that the State is concerned with it

10

is because of the broad holding that the Oregon Supreme

11

Court has announced under -- about what eight amendment

12

requires.

13

has said about what that means when evidence is

14

mitigating evidence, then I think a necessary corollary

15

of the Oregon Supreme Court holding is that defense

16

counsel does get to make that argument, and that the

17

jury must --

When you combine that with what this Court

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

MS. WILLIAMS:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But there's no --

-- be permitted --- reason that the

21

defendant couldn't introduce other evidence in his

22

resentencing trial, is there?

23

MS. WILLIAMS:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

25

Under the -I mean, if he has

other -- he says, "I have other witnesses that go to

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

the residual-doubt question," and I would -- you know,

2

on retrial, if he prevails here, presumably he would be

3

entitled to put in that evidence, as well.

4

MS. WILLIAMS:

That's correct, Mr. Chief

5

Justice.

6

broad, that any alibi evidence comes in, and, as the

7

dissent notes, that it also would not be limited simply

8

to alibi evidence, but any evidence that is

9

inconsistent with the guilt verdict in this case that

The Oregon Supreme Court's conclusion is very

10

would form a basis for arguing that doubt about the

11

defendant's guilt should be a factor that the jury

considers in responding to the mitigation question that

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MS. WILLIAMS:

also that the State is going to have to live with this

6

decision in other capital cases, and other capital

defendants --

JUSTICE STEVENS:

MS. WILLIAMS:

11

Yes.

And it's

But our --

-- may not be willing to --

JUSTICE STEVENS:

-- jurisdiction is limited

to reviewing a final judgment in this case.

12

MS. WILLIAMS:

13

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Yes.
We can't give an advisory

14

opinion which would tell you what to do in other cases,

15

which -- if that's all it does.

16

MS. WILLIAMS:

But I do not believe that a

17

party can force the Court into that position by

18

stipulating that, although the State Supreme Court

19

holding permits it --

20

JUSTICE STEVENS:

21

MS. WILLIAMS:

22

JUSTICE STEVENS:

25

But would they're --

-- to do much more --- they would be giving up

the right that you claim you don't want them to have.
MS. WILLIAMS:

way that would basically lock the State into a box.

Not for this case

--

8

JUSTICE STEVENS:

9

MS. WILLIAMS:

10

Yes.

-- that's correct.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

That's why I'm concerned

11

that perhaps we're being confronted with a request for

12

an advisory opinion.

13

categorically agreed to what -- they may be going --

14

willing to say that they aren't going to put anything

15

else in.

16

I don't know.

Maybe they haven't

I don't really know that yet.
MS. WILLIAMS:

But I think their stipulation

17

would have to have two parts -- one, that they wouldn't

18

put anything else in that wasn't presented in the guilt

19

phase; and, two, that they wouldn't argue that, based

20

on that evidence, the jury should consider doubts about

21

the defendant's guilt in deciding what the appropriate

22

sentence is.

23

JUSTICE STEVENS:

We may -- we may not have

24

held they have a constitutional right to make that

25

argument, but do you -- do you think that State --

14
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

that you did -- you don't think they could even make

2

the argument as a matter of State procedure or anything

3

at all?

4

MS. WILLIAMS:

Not on the mitigation

5

question, Your Honor.

6

the Oregon Supreme Court has construed the mitigation

7

question, and has construed it to mean that only that

8

which the eighth amendment requires is to be presented

9

to the jury.

And that's because of the way

The Legislature adopted that provision in

10

response to this Court's mitigation case law, and

11

that's what they were intending to implement, and

12

nothing more than that.

13

more, but Oregon has not, as a matter of how the Oregon

14

Supreme Court has --

I think States are free to do

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

16

MS. WILLIAMS:

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, why is --

-- construed the statute -What about Oregon revised

18

stat 163.150?

19

proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that all

20

evidence previously offered and received may be

21

considered for purposes of the sentencing hearing."

22

Now, that's Oregon law.

23

possible reason could Oregon have for having that

24

provision, which is, "Jury, you shall consider all the

25

evidence you just heard at the guilt phase of the

It says, "In a capital sentencing

It's long been there.

What

1

trial"?

2

to be relevant, "all evidence," unless it's relevant to

3

the question of whether there is doubt?

What reason could that be?

4

MS. WILLIAMS:

How is it supposed

Justice Breyer, I'd point you

5

to the -- an earlier part of that same section of the

6

statute that says, "Evidence may -- in the sentencing

7

proceeding, evidence may be presented as to any matter

8

that the court deems relevant to sentence."

9

--

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

And their

But that's a different

11

provision.

12

where you hear the guilt phase, and now we're in the

13

sentencing phase, and it says here, under Oregon law,

14

"Judge, tell the jury that everything they previously

15

heard at the guilt phase they may consider for purposes

16

of what sentence they should impose."

17

what that sentence is doing there in Oregon law, unless

18

the jury is supposed to think about whether this guy's

19

really -- "I'm completely certain he's guilty."

20

I'm now thinking of the "normal case,"

MS. WILLIAMS:

I just wonder

There -- it does serve a

21

different purpose, Your Honor, and that is that -- when

22

you read the entire section, what it -- what it does

23

is, it says that, first of all, parties may present

24

additional evidence, if it's relevant.

25

cannot present repetitive, or cumulative, evidence that

The -- they

16
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

1

had been presented earlier.

2

supposed to inform that jury that what had come in the

3

guilt phase may be considered in the penalty phase.

4

And so -- and we've had the --

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And then, the court's

I suppose that if that

6

provision weren't there, the court would have to

7

decide, item-of-evidence by item-of-evidence, which

8

pieces, that the jury has already heard, were relevant

9

to the penalty, and not to the guilt.

Whereas, by just

10

allowing everything in, but just telling the jury, "You

11

only consider it insofar as it goes to the penalty, and

12

not to the guilt," we -- the court does not have to

13

enter into that item-by-item discrimination.

14

MS. WILLIAMS:

Justice Scalia, what it does

15

is, it allows the jury to know that just because

16

something hasn't been re-presented to them in the

17

penalty phase, but came in, in the guilt phase, it's

18

open for their consideration.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

20

MS. WILLIAMS:

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Without any clue --

What it doesn't do --- without any clue

stage.

anybody wants to put it to in the guilt phase.

10
11

And this does not mean that evidence that

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That isn't the basis on

which the court decided this case, is it?

12

MS. WILLIAMS:

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, sir.
What we're saying here is

14

that this is a possible basis on which the Oregon

15

Supreme Court might have decided this case.

16

not decide it on that case -- on that ground.

17

decided that the jury has to be able to consider doubt,

18

not because of that provision of the statute, but

19

because of the eighth amendment.

MS. WILLIAMS:

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

They did
They

And --

Yes, Your Honor.
And -No, I wasn't suggesting

23

anything other than what Justice Scalia said, but I was

24

just curious about this statute that tells the jury,

25

"You can consider everything," and gives them no

1

guidance, because some of it might be quite

2

inappropriate for them to consider.

3

MS. WILLIAMS:

And the guidance does come

4

from the other instructions that tell the jury what the

5

specific questions are that they must answer in the

6

penalty phase, and what they take into account in

7

answering those questions.

8

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But --

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What has our constitutional

10

law regarding the requirement of allowing the jury to

11

consider all mitigating factors -- the requirement that

12

they have to be allowed to be take into account of that

13

-- what guidance has that provided?

14

constitutional law said what constitutes a mitigating

15

factor?

16

MS. WILLIAMS:

Has our

In -- it has.

And I believe

17

that in Franklin versus Lynaugh, this Court came very

18

close to deciding this question, that residual doubt is

19

not one of those mitigating factors.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Apart from that, apart from

21

the fact of whether the person's guilty or not, have we

22

specified what factors the jury can take into account

23

by way of mitigation?

24
25

MS. WILLIAMS:

There are some factors that

the Court has described as being required as

19
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

appropriate for mitigation.

2

of the individual, the --

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So, age, the mental state

Don't you think that if a

4

State listed specific factors that could be taken into

5

account, and no others, that there would be

6

considerable doubt whether this Court would allow such

7

a statute to stand?

8
9

MS. WILLIAMS:

I think certainly with respect

to the background and character of the defendant, but

10

the question here would be a fairly limited restriction

11

to say that circumstances of the offense presume that

12

the offense has occurred and that the defendant is

13

guilty; and so, evidence inconsistent with that guilt

14

is not a circumstance of the offense.

15

And I'd like to reserve time for rebuttal.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Contrary to the

Do you have any view

4

on whether this question is properly before us, given

5

the Oregon statutes?

6

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Mr. Chief Justice, our view

7

is that this Court certainly could reach the

8

constitutional question presented.

9

are good reasons that this Court should.

10

And, indeed, there

The Oregon Supreme Court squarely confronted,

11

and resolved, the Federal constitutional question, and

12

it is ripe for this Court's review.

13

Justice O'Connor suggested at the outset, that the

14

Oregon Supreme Court appears to have been laboring

15

under a factual misimpression -- namely, that

16

Respondent's mother did not testify at the initial

17

trial.

18

that Respondent was seeking -- and is still seeking,

19

even before this Court -- to introduce the live

20

testimony of his mother.

It is true, as

That having been said, it appears to be clear

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

22

MR. SHANMUGAM:

23

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But -And the -But, based on what you have

24

just said, which was my understanding, too, assuming

25

the Oregon Supreme Court made the assumption that the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

mother's testimony had not been admitted at prior

2

trial, the only thing that the Oregon Supreme Court was

3

ruling on was the admissibility of new testimony, and

4

the use to which new testimony could be put, right?

5
6

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, that is correct,

Justice Souter.

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

8

MR. SHANMUGAM:

9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So that if the -I do think --- if the other side says,

10

"We totally give up any claim to introduce new

11

testimony," then don't we have a jurisdictional

12

problem?

13

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, I think that we would

14

agree with the State of Oregon that a necessary

15

implication of the Oregon Supreme Court's holding,

16

albeit unstated, was that a defendant is

17

constitutionally entitled to argue residual doubt, as

18

well as to present evidence of residual doubt.

19

that not true, the failure to admit the evidence would,

20

in some sense, be harmless, since it is true, certainly

21

to some extent, that the mere presentation of the

22

evidence might lead to the jury taking it into account

23

even absent an argument or instruction to that effect.

Were

24

But, as a practical matter, this Court has never

25

distinguished, in its consideration of mitigating

1

factors, between the presentation of argument or

2

evidence and obtaining --

3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

4

MR. SHANMUGAM:

5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Oh, we --- an instruction --- have not, but it's

6

possible for, it seems to me -- for all we know, it's

7

possible that Oregon could say, "Look, we have a

8

statute that says everything that was introduced at

9

trial may be considered.

That may be a good thing or a

10

bad thing, but that's what our statute says, and they

11

may consider it.

12

evidence may be admitted at the sentencing hearing --

13

the sentencing phase only, then we're going to restrict

14

that only to evidence which, in our view, is required

15

by the eighth amendment."

But when the question comes, What new

16

So, if that is, then -- we don't -- I don't

17

know whether the Oregon Supreme Court took that view,

18

or not. But if it did take that view, and, in this

19

case, the Respondents say, "We no longer want to

20

introduce any new evidence," then we would not have a

21

case left, it seems to me.

22

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, I think that that is

23

true, to some extent, Justice Souter, but I do think

24

that -- at least with regard to the question of what

25

factors are relevant to the ultimate determination,

23
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

that is governed by a quite different statutory

2

provision.

3

provision to limit the mitigating factors that the jury

4

can take into account to those that are mandated by the

5

eighth amendment.

And the Oregon Supreme Court construed that

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

7

MR. SHANMUGAM:

8

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

9
10

Well, on that --

And I would further note --- on that substantive

point, it does seem -- I assume a Governor could take
this into account in clemency?

11

MR. SHANMUGAM:

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Yes, certainly.
And I suppose the Governors

13

can do more than juries can.

14

to me that a jury cannot consider that this is a close

15

case.

16

course.

17

defendant is obdurate in not accepting guilt.

18

"I didn't do it."

19

But, still, it seems odd

It's been proven beyond a reasonable doubt, of
It goes at least to whether or not the

MR. SHANMUGAM:

He says,

Well, acceptance of

20

responsibility may present different issues, but we

21

would submit that the fundamental problem with the

22

constitutional rule that the Oregon Supreme Court did

23

expressly adopt is that it would effectively allow

24

jurors, at their discretion, to apply what is a higher

25

standard of proof at capital sentencing than the

24
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

reasonable-doubt standard, which, after all, is the

2

standard that applies in all other criminal contexts.

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, no, the evidence goes

4

to explain why the defendant is taking the position

5

that he does.

6

true, the jury, in the guilt phase, found that he was -

7

-

He said, "I wasn't there."

8

MR. SHANMUGAM:

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Now, it's

Well, the jury did --- at least it explains his

10

attitude, his demeanor, his refusal to accept

11

responsibility.

12

There's a reason for that.

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, the jury did determine,

13

at the guilt phase, that the defendant was guilty

14

beyond a reasonable doubt.

15

of the reasonable-doubt standard is that it is the

16

highest standard of law -- of proof known to the law,

17

short of absolute certainty.

18

this Court's case law in the mitigation area, this

19

Court has, time and time again, limited mitigating

20

evidence to evidence concerning the character or record

21

of the defendant and the circumstances of the offense.

And the fundamental point

And I think, turning to

22

And the reason for that, I think, is that the very

23

concept of mitigating evidence really does presuppose

24

that the defendant has committed the crime in the first

25

place.

To put it another way, mitigating evidence is

25
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

evidence that suggests that a defendant who has

2

committed the crime is somehow less deserving of the

3

death penalty.

4

And going back to --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, it would follow from

5

that, that if a State wanted to exclude the defense

6

evidence on alibi from a sentencing jury's

7

consideration

8

sentencing jury -- they could do that.

9

-- let's assume it's a new -- a new

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, we believe that that

10

would be permissible.

11

joint opinion in Woodson versus North Carolina, which

12

was really where this constitutional requirement of

13

mitigation was first recognized, this Court did not

14

suggest in any way that, to the extent that

15

individualized consideration at sentencing is mandated,

16

a jury is entitled to consider any and all factors that

17

it might think is relevant.

18

recognized a category of mitigating factors that is

19

limited to factors that are traditionally taken into

20

account at sentencing -- namely, the character or

21

record of the defendant and the circumstances --

And I think, going back to the

22

JUSTICE STEVENS:

23

MR. SHANMUGAM:

24

JUSTICE STEVENS:

25

in new evidence.

Instead, the Court really

Of course, that's true --

-- of the offense.
-- with respect to putting

I understand your point.

But there -

26
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

- as a realistic matter, do you think it's possible to

2

prevent a juror from deciding, "I thought it was really

3

a closer case than beyond a reasonable doubt; and so,

4

I'm a little hesitant about the death penalty"?

5

There's no way to prevent that --

6

MR. SHANMUGAM:

7

JUSTICE STEVENS:

8

MR. SHANMUGAM:

9

I think --

-- as a practical matter, it

may be very difficult to --

10

JUSTICE STEVENS:

11

MR. SHANMUGAM:

12
13

-- from happening.

Yes.

-- prevent it.

I'm not sure

that it is necessarily desirable for jurors to do that.
And there is some suggestion, in the empirical

14

evidence, that what actually goes on in the jury room

15

is that jurors with some level of doubt about a

16

defendant's guilt will actually negotiate with other

17

jurors to ensure that a defendant is convicted, but

18

ends up not being sentenced to death.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But there's -- used on the

20

other side and as a policy model, the model penal code,

21

I think, says it's okay.

22

okay.

23

It -- not really that it's

It should be considered.
MR. SHANMUGAM:

24

penal code does say that.

25

1962.

Justice Ginsburg, the model
It was adopted, I think, in

And I think that it is telling that, in the

27
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

years since 1962, since this Court recognized that the

2

death penalty was constitutional again in the 1970s, no

3

State has expressly adopted a statute that permits

4

consideration of residual doubt in --

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

7

10

But there are a number of

States that do --

8
9

When you --

MR. SHANMUGAM:

To be sure, there are courts

in several States -- I think we identified seven in our
brief --

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

12

MR. SHANMUGAM:

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

14

MR. SHANMUGAM:

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Your --

-- that have --- position is --

-- recognized --- that it's up to the

16

States, I take it, but it's not compelled by the eighth

17

amendment.

18

MR. SHANMUGAM:

That's exactly right, Justice

19

Ginsburg, just as it would be up to the States, at

20

their discretion, to decide to simply adopt a higher

21

standard of proof across the board in capital cases.

22

State could certainly decide to adopt an absolute-

23

certainty standard.

24

that no State has expressly permitted consideration of

25

residual doubts.

A

But I think my point is simply

Courts have construed statutes in

28
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

some States to permit it, typically because those State

2

statutes contain broad language either with regard to

3

the definition of "mitigating factors" or with regard

4

to the discretion the jury has in making the ultimate

5

sentencing determination.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So, you think -- you think

7

the Oregon Supreme Court might well come out that way,

8

if it wished, although not resting on the eighth

9

amendment?

10

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Might come out that way with

11

regard to the right of a defendant to, say, argue

12

residual doubt?

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

MR. SHANMUGAM:

15

of that on the face of the opinion.

16

in some sense, it would be quite difficult for the

17

Oregon Supreme Court to do that, having construed the

18

statute that governs the determination that the jury

19

actually makes at sentencing, to limit the factors that

20

the jury can consider to those that this Court has

21

recognized are constitutionally mandated under the

22

eighth amendment.

23

the Oregon Supreme Court's reasoning in this case

24

really forecloses that interpretation.

25

Yes.
Well, there's no indication
And I think that,

So, as a practical matter, I think

If the Court has no further questions, we

29

Hopefully, I can simplify this matter for the

11

that was recently filed, Mr. Guzek does disclaim any

reliance on the eighth amendment of the United States

14

-

15

As is set forth in our brief, and in our motion

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but that

16

doesn't matter.

17

Oregon Supreme Court did, and it's quite clear that it

18

based its decision on the eighth amendment, not these

19

various provisions of Oregon evidence law.

20

I mean, the question is what the

MR. WOLF:

Well, with all due respect, Mr.

21

Chief Justice, if Mr. Guzek does not intend to rely

22

upon the eighth amendment, I think that this would moot

23

the case and that the -- this Court could then vacate

24

that portion of the Oregon Supreme Court's opinion.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You argue in -- an

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

eighth amendment case in the Supreme Court, you win on

2

the eighth amendment, then you leave the courthouse and

3

say, "Well, I don't want it anymore," and you think

4

that moots the case?

5

MR. WOLF:

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well -It's still a

7

decision, binding in this case, giving you the right to

8

admit any evidence on residual doubt in the retrial.

9

MR. WOLF:

Well, I respectfully disagree.

In

10

-- because, in fact, we didn't really argue, in the

11

Oregon Supreme Court, that we were entitled,

12

necessarily, under the eighth amendment.

13

was primarily under the statute, that this statute says

14

any evidence which came in should be admitted in the

15

retrial.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Our argument

But you don't

17

question, or doubt, that the State Supreme Court

18

decision was based on the eighth amendment.

MR. WOLF:

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's correct.
Okay.

So, if we vacate it and the

22

case is remanded on that ground, I assume it's still

23

open for you to point out to the Oregon Supreme Court

24

that they were in error about the -- about the status

25

of the testimony that you tried to get in, and have it

31

handle the matter, rather than your --

3

MR. WOLF:

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

5

"mooting the case"?

6

MR. WOLF:

Why isn't that the way to

That --- as you express it,

Well, that -- we believe that we

7

are entitled to present it under State law, and we

8

think that is the resolution.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Of course, that -- there

10

would still remain -- whether you mooted the case, or

11

whether we vacated and then it was left to the Oregon

12

Supreme Court whether to let this evidence in -- there

13

would still remain the question of what kind of an

14

instruction the jury can be given regarding the

15

consideration of this evidence for purposes not of

16

determining whether a guilty person should not be given

17

the death penalty, but, rather, for purpose of

18

considering whether the guilt is clear enough.

19

that's -- that issue would still remain, wouldn't it?

20

MR. WOLF:

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

22

MR. WOLF:

Well, not necessarily.

I mean,

I --

Why wouldn't it?

Well, I think, under Oregon law,

23

we are entitled to put on -- well, first we have to

24

distinguish between these unitary juries and these

25

retrial juries, because, of course, the retrial jury

32
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

has not heard the evidence from the guilt/innocence

2

phase, from the original trial.

3

a retrial jury is hearing -- they're hearing this

4

evidence for the first time, and the State should not

5

be permitted to just put on the evidence that they

6

think helps aggravate the case.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And in the event that

No, I understand, but what

8

are you -- what are you going to argue to that jury?

9

Are you going to argue to that jury, you know, that,

10

"Yes, my client has been convicted, but the evidence of

11

his guilt was really not all that clear, and you should

12

take that into" -- don't you want to make that argument?

13

MR. WOLF:

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, that's a potential argument.
And the Oregon Supreme Court

15

says you can make that argument, because the eighth

16

amendment requires you to be able to make that

17

argument.

18

MR. WOLF:

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But we think -And what the State says is,

20

"No, the eighth amendment requires no such thing."

21

the issue hasn't gone away.

22

here in this very case.

23

MR. WOLF:

It's still here.

So,

It's

Well, we think we're entitled to

when you go back, you can put on anything, whether it

15

was presented before, or not, right?

16

eighth amendment requires that, according to the Oregon

17

Supreme Court.

18

MR. WOLF:

Because the

Well, whether it's required under

19

the eighth amendment, or not, is for you to decide,

20

obviously, but we think --

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

MR. WOLF:

Okay.

-- that it's whether or not Oregon

23

law also requires it.

rebut this.

about a scenario -- and, in this very case, the joint

2

appendix, at page 92, the prosecutor in this case --

3

this is an excerpt from the trial -- was trying to get

4

in evidence that the defendant was being manipulative.

5

And, at this point, the alibi evidence had been

excluded.

8

manipulating people by trying to get them to come

forward to say, "I wasn't there," then alibi is

And so, the fact that the defendant was not

10

relevant to respond -- to rebut and respond to that

11

kind of an argument.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Whatever Oregon law might

13

say, or not say, it appears that this Supreme -- Oregon

14

Supreme Court was acting under what it thought was the

15

compulsion of the eighth amendment.

16

about that, you can make your argument about what

17

Oregon law should be, without any eighth amendment

18

constraint.

19

MR. WOLF:

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If it's wrong

Correct.
But it does seem that this

21

court was operating on the assumption that the eighth

22

amendment required it to let in this alibi and other

23

evidence.

24
25

MR. WOLF:

And we think -- we agree that the

Oregon Supreme Court went farther than it needed to in

We can prevail on

Uh-huh.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But are you going to make

11

any argument in support of the decision made by the

12

Oregon Supreme Court?

MR. WOLF:

No, not as long as the State of

Oregon agrees that this statute operates in an

evenhanded fashion.

transcript testimony, then we should have the same

right.

In other words, if they get to

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, this is -Well --- so odd.

It -- almost

22

as though we should appoint some amicus here, Counsel,

23

to argue in support of the merits.

be doing that.

MR. WOLF:

Well, Your Honor, on the merits,

4

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

5

MR. WOLF:

It's very strange.

Well, we think that the -- that

6

the Oregon Supreme Court decision was correct in -- on

7

the -- on the eighth amendment.

8

but it's -- not necessarily for the reasons stated by

9

the Oregon Supreme Court.

And we think it's --

And the fact is that if the

Oregon Supreme Court held that we have a right to -- we

11

believe that we have a right to respond to any evidence

12

they offer on aggravation.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

What about -- what about --

14

for example, the single most important feature leading

15

juries to recommend against death, apparently, from the

16

studies, is their residual doubt.

18

automatically takes that into account.

19

those who are resentenced and have a new jury should

have the same kind of right.

22

Every juror who

Therefore,

Otherwise, it's cruel and

Now, I made that argument.

You didn't

24

arguments that you might make in favor of the Oregon

25

Supreme Court's approach if, at least, you concede that

But it seems to me that there are several

1

it is up to Oregon to control, through its evidentiary

2

rules, whether a matter is relevant, what form it comes

3

in, et cetera.

4

MR. WOLF:

Well, we think that if -- by

5

directing that the jury consider all evidence in both

6

phases of the trial, it must be relevant.

7

would they instruct the jury to consider such evidence,

8

unless it was relevant to the sentencing questions

9

the jury must answer?

Why else

And obviously I agree with you,

10

Justice Breyer, that if the -- if a defendant must run

11

the gamut of having -- we have to remember that the

12

first trial was set aside because it was defective in

13

some way.

14

resentencing jury to not be entitled to hear what the

15

first jury heard when the defendant had an

16

unconstitutional, or a defective, trial.

17

And it would be an anomalous result for the

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So --

Mr. Wolf, in view of the

18

direction this discussion is going in, I want to go

19

back to something that I really think we all thought we

20

had passed but I would like to go back and get clear

21

on.

22

to Justice Stevens, that you currently maintain that

23

you have a right to recall the mother to the stand at

24

the -- at the sentencing proceeding.

25

My recollection is that you stated, in your answer

My question, which is prompted by your motion

55
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

-- my question is, Is it your present intention to call

2

the mother to the stand, or is it your present

3

intention to use the mother's testimony, which we all -

4

- I understand to be admissible?

5

her, or not?

6

MR. WOLF:

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

8

MR. WOLF:

9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Are you going to call

Well, we would intend to call her.
You do intend to call her.

Because we think it's important -No, I'm not asking why.

I

10

just want to know whether you are.

11

representation to me is that you do intend to call her

12

as a live witness as the -- at the resentencing.

13

MR. WOLF:

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

15

MR. WOLF:

And your

Yes.
Okay.

And I'd like to answer the reason

16

for that, because we think the jury is entitled to see

17

her demeanor and gauge, based on how she testifies, how

18

believable she is.

19

better for a jury to be able to see a live witness than

20

hear a cold transcript being read by surrogates.

21

We think it's much -- we think it's

And so, of course, in -- as we know, in -- if

22

she were to stray from what she testified at the

23

original trial, of course she would be impeached with,

24

"Well, you didn't testify about that the first time."

25

But the jury, we think, as the statute clearly

56
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

indicates, should allow witnesses who testified

2

originally to be recalled, unless, for some reason,

3

they're unavailable --

JUSTICE STEVENS:

MR. WOLF:

6

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Mr. Wolf, I --

-- in which case --- I had misunderstood

7

something.

8

there also is going to be a new trial, is there, on

9

the merits?

There's going to be a new sentencing, but

10

MR. WOLF:

11

JUSTICE STEVENS:

12

There -Why -- because you

mentioned, earlier, about the defect in the trial.

13
14

No.

MR. WOLF:

The convictions -- well, the

defect was in the penalty phase.

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

MR. WOLF:

And so, the convictions are

20

questions:

22

concerns, we believe we have the right to respond to

24

that.

25

The jury is going to be instructed, "The

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1

-- that the alibi in this case was -- really was

2

offered as impeachment of the codefendants.

3

codefendants are really the only evidence that links

4

the defendant to these crimes.

5

that -- it's impeachment by contradiction.

6

they may find that if the codefendants say, "He did A,

7

B, and C," and mom says, "No, he was with me," it

8

doesn't necessarily mean that he was with mom, only

9

that they should disbelieve the codefendants.

The

And so, to the extent

instruction that they're to consider it for the limited

13

purpose of whether or not to believe the codefendants,

14

but not necessarily as substantive evidence of alibi.

15

And that happens in trials every day.

16

think it's that unusual for the -- if the evidence

17

relates to the sentencing questions the jury must

18

consider, then it should come in.

19

The jury is given an

So, we don't

So, the other point that I think is important

20

in this case is that the -- you know, the -- it's

really not unlike this -- cases that this Court has

held, Sumner versus Shuman, and Skipper.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARY H. WILLIAMS

3

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

General Williams, I have one

5

question.

6

question before us, but I honestly don't understand

7

what your statute is all about.

8

having been convicted of aggravated murder --

9

aggravated murder -- the sentencing jury shall be

I'm not sure it goes to our eighth amendment

It says that after

10

presented with the following questions.

11

whether the conduct of the defendant that caused the

12

death of the deceased was committed deliberately and

13

with the reasonable expectation that death of the

14

deceased, or another, would result.

15

find that in order to convict of aggravated murder?

16

MS. WILLIAMS:

Number one,

Don't you have to

Justice Scalia, we copied from

17

Texas on those special issues.

18

guilt phase, what you have to establish is the

19

defendant acted intentionally.

20

required as far as a constitutional state of mind.

21

And the deliberateness question is sort of an

22

intentional-plus.

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

24

MS. WILLIAMS:

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And so, in the

And that's what's

Plus, okay.

It's from an additional --- I gotcha.

1

MS. WILLIAMS:

-- finding, beyond

2

intentional, that the State has to then establish in

3

the penalty phase.

4

Two quick points.

First, on how this

5

evidence was offered.

It was not offered as

6

impeachment evidence.

It was not offered under any

7

State statute.

8

second volume, at page 94 is the notice of intent to

9

rely on evidence of alibi as mitigating evidence.

If you look in the joint appendix, the

And

10

then there's an accompanying memo that follows.

11

also, at page 88 of the joint appendix, there's a

12

colloquy between defense counsel and the trial court,

13

where defense counsel says, "Your Honor, I made it

14

very clear that alibi is being offered as mitigation.

15

It goes to the circumstances of the crime.

16

mitigating evidence that someone is not there."

17

later, circumstances of the offense is part of the

18

fourth question, which, in Oregon, is the mitigation

19

question.

20
21
22
23

And,

It's
And,

If the -JUSTICE BREYER:

Is the 2:16 a.m. alarm clock

in the original trial, or not?
MS. WILLIAMS:

The mother's testimony about

the time from --

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

MS. WILLIAMS:

Yes.

-- 2:10 a.m. to 4:20 is in the

60
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

guilt phase of the trial.

2
3

And again from the colloquy, "If you're not
there, that is certainly mitigating."

4

And let me just mention, in terms of the

5

timing of the alibi evidence, the grandfather's alibi

6

covered from 9 o'clock at night until 2 o'clock in the

7

morning; the mother's, from 2:10 in the morning til

8

4:20.

9

The crimes occurred in the early morning hours.

And so, there isn't any way to parse this out and say

10

that the alibi testimony might have been relevant, in

11

some small piece, on deliberateness.

12

To the extent that the State puts on

13

additional evidence to establish deliberateness, of

14

course defendant can respond to that additional

15

evidence, but the State doesn't make the question of

16

whether the defendant was there wide open again in the

17

penalty phase.

Williams.
