CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

Mr. Gray.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY S. GRAY

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9
10

MR. GRAY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In cases involving safety exigencies, an

11

officer's actions should be judged against a single

12

objective standard of reasonableness, that is, whether

13

the facts and circumstances known to the officers at

14

the time of entry would warrant a reasonable person in

15

believing that immediate intervention is needed to

16

preserve the peace and protect others from harm.

17

officers have reason to believe that violence is

18

imminent or ongoing, they meet that standard.

19

When

In this case, the Brigham City officers

20

responded to a complaint at 3:00 a.m. and, upon

21

arriving, witnessed a violent and tumultuous struggle

22

between four adults and a teenager.

23

when the juvenile threw a punch is when the officers

24

acted and thereby prevented injury.

25

what we would expect officers to do.

The officers --

This is exactly

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What were they doing in the

2

yard anyway?

3

couldn't have seen that until they went into the fenced

4

backyard violating the curtilage of the property.

5

-- was that justified?

6

This sort of occurred to me.

MR. GRAY:

Yes, it was justified.

They

How

At that

7

time what they heard from the curb side and then from

8

the front was the same kind of violence going on.

9

heard that from -- from the time they arrived all the

They

10

way.

11

someone saying, get off me, stop, stop.

12

these officers were doing, in the course of that, is

13

investigating that -- that, and it led them to the

14

backyard.

They -- they heard the thumping, the shouting,

15

Now --

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And so what

Is any less required to --

17

to go into the curtilage than is required to go into

18

the house?

19

MR. GRAY:

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No.

21

MR. GRAY:

And again, that was --

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No.

Yes.

It's the same test?

So you say that even if he

23

didn't see him throw the punch and -- and draw blood,

24

they could have gone in just because they heard

25

somebody say, stop, stop, get off me?

4
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. GRAY:

It's our position that they could

2

have, though that's a much closer case.

3

the officers acted in a very guarded manner.

4

they -- they proceeded and they investigated step by

5

step and, in fact, did not enter until a punch was

6

thrown and there was --

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

In this case,
I mean,

So what -- what you're

8

saying is they've got to have a reasonable ground to

9

take the first step.

That may not be a reasonable

10

ground to have taken the second step right then and

11

there, but it's the same reasonableness standard.

12

MR. GRAY:

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

14

MR. GRAY:

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes, it is.
That's -- that's --

Yes.
One thing that was left

16

out of the succession of acts -- Utah provides for

17

telephone warrants, and there was no attempt to do

18

that.

19

was probable cause to enter, they could have called for

20

a warrant, but they didn't.

21

didn't?

22

Once they checked to -- to determine that there

MR. GRAY:

Yes.

Is there a reason why they

The reason is where there's

23

a violent situation, things can change in seconds.

24

mean, it can turn deadly in seconds.

25

time.

I

They don't have

Even though a telephonic warrant would certainly

5
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

be a more speedy process of getting a warrant, it's not

2

speedy enough where punches are being thrown.

3

it can turn deadly, one blow could give someone a

4

concussion or even rupture a spleen.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I mean,

Well, you don't -- you don't

6

really mean that if they saw somebody inside with a gun

7

and they heard him saying, I'm going to shoot you in 2

8

minutes, since they could have gotten a telephone

9

warrant, they would have to had to get a telephone

10

warrant?

11

MR. GRAY:

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, not at all.
I mean, you -- you don't

13

want the -- the telephone warrant requirement to -- to

14

up the ante on -- on what it takes to -- for the police

15

to go in without a warrant, do you?

16

MR. GRAY:

No.

In fact, precisely for that

17

reason, the officers would not need a telephonic

18

warrant in that situation no more than they would need

19

a telephonic warrant in this situation.

20

essence.

21

Time is of the

Violence -JUSTICE SCALIA:

But it wouldn't be of the

22

essence if you know you have 2 minutes. You know I'm going

23

to kill you in 2 minutes.

24

MR. GRAY:

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, that -- that's -Do you really want the

6
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

policeman to say I got 2 minutes, you know, dial in and

2

get a warrant?

That's ridiculous.

3

(Laughter.)

4

MR. GRAY:

That -- that would be assuming --

5

that would be assuming that you could take someone who

6

is threatening in that manner at his word.

7

think that's something the officers could -- could

8

afford to do.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I don't

Are the police instructed

10

-- the city police instructed about when the telephone

11

warrant procedure is appropriate?

12

MR. GRAY:

13

so.

14

know.

That I -- I do not know.

I assume

They have procedures in place, but that I do not

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

When you speak about a

16

violent situation, would that be limited -- would that

17

apply here just because a punch was thrown, or would it

18

be enough that the officers saw some men restraining

19

the young man, or would it be enough if there were

20

violent words being exchanged?

21

MR. GRAY:

With -- with violent words,

22

generally not, though if it's accompanied with a show

23

of immediate force or violence, then yes, in that

24

situation.

25

In this situation, I believe that officers

7
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

could have entered prior to the punch being thrown.

2

What they witnessed is -- is this violent struggle

3

between four adults and a teenager.

4

whether or not they were trying to molest the -- the

5

teenager or whether the teenager was an intruder or

6

what happened.

7

violent.

8

the circumstances as they approached.

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

They had no idea

But they could tell that it was

They knew that alcohol was involved based on

Did they know that minors

10

were involved?

11

in the preliminary direct exam of the officer.

The record doesn't show that, at least

12

MR. GRAY:

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

14

that once they got into the backyard.

15

before they got into the backyard?

That minors were involved?

16

MR. GRAY:

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Yes.

Or did they just know that

minors stay up late at night?

19

MR. GRAY:

They knew that minors were in the

20

backyard.

21

They did not know that --

23
24
25

Did they know

They knew that minors --

18

22

I mean, they knew

They -- they witnessed the two juveniles.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But that's after they went

into the backyard.
MR. GRAY:

No.

They saw that from the

driveway, through the -- the slit -- slit -- slats in

8
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

the fence.

2
3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

They could see that they

were minors.

4

MR. GRAY:

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yes, yes.
How much -- you've

6

been focusing on the violence because of the punch

7

being thrown, but I gather they were called originally

8

because of concern about the noise and disturbance of

9

the peace and all that.

10

MR. GRAY:

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yes.
Is that a sufficient

12

basis for them to have gone into the backyard and

13

proceed from there?

14

MR. GRAY:

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well -They're just

16

shouting.

17

It's 3:00 in the morning or whatever.

18

that enough?

19

There are five people in the house shouting.

MR. GRAY:

Is that -- is

Probably not, certainly not where

20

the State is -- where the State offers as -- as the

21

proffered justification safety, it would not be enough.

22

That would be a different justification for their

23

actions.

24

neighbors, we would argue that the expectation of

25

privacy had diminished in that home because of that

Certainly where they're disturbing the

9
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

disturbance.

2

the city is offering as a justification safety, that

3

would not be sufficient to go in.

4

But again, where the State -- or where

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but if -- if the -- if

5

the complaint were -- were simply a complaint of noise,

6

and they got to the -- the gate, the back fence, and

7

they could hear all the racket inside and there didn't

8

seem to be any practical way to get people to come to

9

the fence to talk to them, wouldn't they have had the

10

right to go through the gate and at least go up to the

11

door and bang on the door?

12

MR. GRAY:

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yes.
So they could have gotten

14

through the curtilage.

15

to the back door based entirely on noise.

They could at least have gotten

16

MR. GRAY:

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

18

MR. GRAY:

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes.
Okay.

Yes.
Except that there was a

20

front door, which they approached first.

21

they left one of the officers in the front.

22

MR. GRAY:

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

24
25

As I recall,

Yes.
So they could have banged on

the front door.
MR. GRAY:

They -- they could have, though

10
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

the evidence was that -- and the trial court found that

2

it was so loud and tumultuous that nobody would have

3

heard it or probably would not have heard it.

4

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But I'm a little puzzled.

5

If the noise is the cause of their being there and if

6

the noise is so loud at 3:00 in the morning that it's

7

still continuing and nobody can hear the knock on the

8

door -- they knock on the door several times and shout

9

-- would they not have the right to go in then to quell

10

the noise?

11

MR. GRAY:

Absolutely.

All that I am

12

maintaining is that they would not be justified under a

13

safety exigency to go in.

14

disturbing the peace, then yes, but not where the

15

proffered justification is safety.

16

Certainly to -- as far as

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So if you're going to rely

17

on the safety and the -- safety and the danger of harm,

18

how serious does the harm have to be?

19

word harm as defining the -- the threshold for this

20

kind of entry.

21

for example?

22

And I use the

What if a father was spanking his child,

MR. GRAY:

No.

Spanking of a child would

23

not.

24

an intent to injure or abuse.

25

are circumstances that would suggest abuse, then

There's no indication under most circumstances of
Now, of course, if there

11
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

officers could go in.

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Doesn't yelling so

3

loudly you can't hear police knock at the door at 3:00

4

in the morning suggest that violence is at least

5

imminent or may well be associated with what they're

6

hearing?

7

MR. GRAY:

It certainly approaches that, but

8

again, what we would maintain is there probably has to

9

be more than simple shouting.

If -- if it's

10

accompanied by threats or a show of force or violence,

11

then certainly they could go in.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Is there, in addition to the

13

safety rationale which you're -- justification, which

14

you're arguing here -- is there a justification to go

15

in to stop an ongoing felony whether safety is involved

16

or not?

17

MR. GRAY:

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Is -- is that a separate --

19

MR. GRAY:

That --

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes.

Yes.

I mean, you see a guy

21

turning out counterfeit dollar bills, $100 bills, and

22

can you go in right away if you see him doing that?

23

MR. GRAY:

Well, it's a crime ongoing, in

24

progress.

So there certainly could be made an

25

argument.

Now, whether or not there's an exigency, I

12
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

think that's doubtful because police could secure the

2

scene and secure a warrant and then execute that

3

warrant.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, I mean, but if that's

5

the case, you have a much easier argument.

6

there an assault here?

7

MR. GRAY:

Wasn't

There was clearly an assault.

Yes, and certainly where officers

8

have reason to believe that there's an ongoing assault,

9

officers can enter.

10
11
12

Now, one of the problems with the Utah
Supreme Court's holding in this case -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In connection with the

13

answer you just gave, it doesn't matter then?

14

an ongoing crime, they can go in?

15

whether it would be a misdemeanor or a felony?

16

doesn't matter how grave the crime is?

17

MR. GRAY:

If it's

It doesn't matter
It

Well, this Court in Welsh

18

indicated that minor offenses -- you couldn't rely on

19

the exigent circumstances exception, or at least it is

20

what it suggested.

21

Utah law, is a class B misdemeanor, punishable by up to

22

6 months in jail, and that's certainly of sufficient

23

gravity to justify officers entering.

24
25

But certainly an assault, under

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Any kind of assault.

I gather it's an assault if you're just sort of a

13
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

couple of guys pushing each other back and forth.

2

MR. GRAY:

Well, under Utah law, an assault

3

is defined as unlawful force or violence so as to --

4

with an intent to do bodily injury.

5

there's not that there.

6

Now, pushing --

Now, one of the chief problems or primary

7

problems with the Utah court's decision in this case is

8

it creates a complicated and confusing bifurcated

9

standard that forces officers unrealistically to choose

10

between roles, to choose whether or not they are going

11

to enter and act as caretakers or enter and act as law

12

enforcement officials.

13

Well, the reality -- first of all, it's --

14

it's very difficult for officers to try to make those

15

kind of judgments in the heat of the moment, and this

16

is precisely the kind of a -- the kind of case where

17

that would be impossible to achieve because officers in

18

this case are acting clearly under both roles.

19

stopping crime and they are also protecting others from

20

harm.

21

they have a reasonable basis to do it, not wait until

22

you have to call an EMT.

23
24
25

They're

We want officers to rescue people from harm when

That's what Mincey provides.

And if there are no further questions, I
would reserve the remainder of my time.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

Let me just ask this one

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

question, if I may, if you have -- did the other side

2

preserve the right to challenge this entry under the

3

Utah constitution?

4
5

MR. GRAY:

No, they did not, and -- and the

Utah Supreme Court recognized that.

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

10

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

11
12

MR. MCNULTY:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

may it please the Court:

13

The Fourth Amendment does not require police

14

officers to stand by and be a spectator to escalating

15

violence in the home when such an officer has an

16

objectively reasonable basis to believe, given the

17

totality of the circumstances, that prompt action is

18

necessary to prevent imminent harm.

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So if there were no

20

punch in this case, would they have had a sufficient

21

basis?

22

conclude, based on their experience, that's likely to

23

escalate into violence and enter on that basis?

24
25

3:00 in the morning, loud shouting.

MR. MCNULTY:

Can they

Well, that's just because

JUSTICE SCALIA:

One thing leads to another.

Right?

10

MR. MCNULTY:

Well, that's correct.

It

depends upon, of course, what those words are.

12

really a combination of the words and the context of

13

the words.

indication of the likelihood of escalation into

MR. MCNULTY:

Correct, Your Honor.

That's --

that's --

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, why?

just so loud that it's perfectly obvious they're

keeping -- getting -- the neighbors are awake and

disturbed by it.

23

violence?

Does it have to be a threat of

loud noise alone, certainly the neighborhood shouldn't

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

have to be a hostage to that noise, and the police

2

officers may be acting reasonably to do what is

3

necessary to end that noise.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But it's going to -So then it doesn't matter

what's being said.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MR. MCNULTY:

So then it does matter.

But the -- what's being said

8

may determine -- may determine -- whether or not entry

9

is necessary to respond to an imminent threat where a

10

prompt response is critical.

11

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It may determine what is

12

necessary to prevent harm, but what if it's not

13

necessary to prevent harm, just necessary to prevent

14

noise?

15

17

MR. MCNULTY:
reasonable.

Then it may still be

It may still be reasonable, Your Honor.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It seems to me the harm

18

inquiry in this case is, you know, sort of superfluous.

19

We don't even have to look at that.

20

MR. MCNULTY:

I agree, Your Honor.

21

that the -- the noise alone could justify the

22

circumstance.

23

It may be

Certainly we wouldn't want a test that

going in without knocking as would the -- a scene of a

4

way to get their attention to stop the noise is to go

in, fine, but wouldn't you have to knock on the door

6

real hard before you went in to stop the noise?

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I hope so.

Yes, but we've got a case

That's why a knock on the door

MR. MCNULTY:

They entered and announced

their presence, and they were not heard when they did

5

either be futile, it could be dangerous, depending upon

7

what was happening, and it certainly could waste some

8

time if it was a dire emergency.

9

So the knock is -- is normally the appropriate

The -- under the Fourth Amendment, a police

10

officer may enter a residence without a warrant when a

11

reasonable officer could conclude, given again all the

12

circumstances, that an impending threat to life or

13

safety justifies immediate intervention and the scope

14

of the intrusion is reasonable in relation to the

15

nature of the emergency.

16

Whether the officer was subjectively

17

motivated to enforce the law or render aid has no

18

relevance in a constitutional inquiry.

19

situations involving violence in the home can escalate

20

in -- in seconds, and the on-the-scene, split-second

21

judgment about exactly when the police officers should

22

intervene is precisely what the totality of the

23

circumstances test has long addressed and resolves the

balance of the Fourth Amendment values.

It's the

Well, counsel, let's

suppose you have a police officer who knows there's

4

some movie as part of the family reunion.

5

there just at the time where the -- in the scene the

one guy says, and now I'm going to kill you with this

7

knife, and he says, ah, and he goes in.

8
9

And he also knows that the

And so he's

Now, subjectively we know that he has no
basis for fearing violence, but a reasonable officer on

10

the scene, hearing somebody say I'm going to kill you

11

with this knife, would have a basis for entering.

12
13

So under your test, is that entry permissible
or not?

14

MR. MCNULTY:

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

16

MR. MCNULTY:

Permissible, Mr. Chief Justice.
Really.

Because there the officer is

17

unaware of the fact based upon the -- as I understood

18

the facts presented, unaware of the fact that that is

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

He knows.

He heard this is what they do at the family
They always reenact this.

23

(Laughter.)

24

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

25

Oh, no.

So he knows that

there's no -- well, but that's the difference here

21
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

between looking at the subjective motivation or what an

2

objective, you know, officer would understand.

3
4

MR. MCNULTY:

If the officer has specific

information --

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

6

MR. MCNULTY:

Right.

-- a fact knowing that this is

7

not truly an imminent threat or necessary to prompt a

8

quick response, then that would be a fact in the

9

totality of the circumstances that wouldn't justify.

10

But, on the other hand --

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So you're saying the

12

objective -- the -- the objective officer always knows

13

at least as much as the officers actually know.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

MR. MCNULTY:

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

17
18
19
20

A good way to put it.

The -- the officer knows -Isn't -- isn't that your

standard?
MR. MCNULTY:

Well, if -- I'm not sure if I

understand the question.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

Would you please repeat it?
Yes.

I -- I thought you

21

were getting to the point of saying that on the

22

objective test that you urge, the officer -- the

23

objective police officer who sets the standard is

24

deemed to know at least as much as the officer on the

25

scene actually knows.

In other words, we don't exclude

information --

MR. MCNULTY:

JUSTICE SOUTER:

4

Right.
-- from our objective test

when the officer actually has that information.

5

MR. MCNULTY:

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

7

MR. MCNULTY:

That's correct.
Okay.

What makes it difficult at

8

times is that you often have two officers.

9

know something, another may not know it.

10

One may

And that's

why objective information is --

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Except I -- I don't think we

12

look to whether he knew that this was a family

13

reenactment.

14

-- that had come to his attention which caused him to

15

believe that this was a family reenactment.

16

you know, if he had read it in a newspaper or something

17

else.

18

I think we look to the facts that he had

I mean,

The facts are -- are what matter and not -MR. MCNULTY:

Thank you, Justice Scalia.

19

That's -- I agree that that is going to -- even what

20

the officer believes he knows may be subject to error,

21

and therefore, the objective test pulls us out of this

22

question of knowing the officer's mind and allows us to

23

look at the totality of the circumstances, what really

24

was occurring and determine whether or not the

25

reasonable officer would be able to enter

constitutionally under those circumstances.
And here again is the -- a situation where

3

there was mounting evidence, and the court in Utah

4

wanted to make the motivation of the officer a

5

significant factor in determining whether or not the

6

officer could enter.

7

the motive or intent of the officer to render aid as

8

one way to analyze the situation.

9

argued that those distinctions -- or the distinction

Specifically, the court looked to

And the government

10

between rendering aid or entering for a law enforcement

purpose is really a -- an unnecessary distinction

argued, is acting in a split-second situation, seeking

Mr. Studebaker, we'll hear now from you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL P. STUDEBAKER

18

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

19
20

MR. STUDEBAKER:

Thank you, General.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

21

There's two bases or two exceptions which

22

would allow somebody to enter into somebody's home,

23

which are before the Court today, one being the

24

emergency aid exception to the warrant requirement, the

25

other one being exigent circumstances requirements for

24
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1
2

the warrant.
Under the facts of this case, neither one of

3

those situations apply.

4

there has to be probable cause to enter, and there has

5

to be a warrant to enter.

6

-- actually under exigent circumstances, there has to

7

be probable cause and there has to be the requirement

8

that there be imminent danger basically to evidence or

9

to the person.

Under exigent circumstances,

And if neither one of those

And if there's not exigent circumstances,

10

and the officers have an obligation to obtain a warrant

11

based upon probable cause to enter the home.

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What -- what -I thought that probable

14

cause was conceded, and I thought that the Utah courts

15

didn't question that there was probable cause.

16

MR. STUDEBAKER:

Your Honor, the -- what

17

happened was that the Utah courts found that the

18

probable cause was there for the emergency aid

19

exception, but I believe under the exigent

20

circumstances requirement -- or the exception, that

21

probable cause was not there to get out -- or actually

22

to get into the home on the situations.

23

But even if probable cause is conceded, the

24

fact is that the facts of the case don't rise to the

25

level of requiring such as immediate entry into a home

25
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

to bypass the warrant requirement.

2

JUSTICE SOUTER:

May -- may I just get back

3

to your general statement?

4

that if they arrived on the scene and, you know, a

5

really wild party was going on at 3:00 a.m., they knock

6

at the door, nobody answers the door, they can't hear

7

it for all the screaming and the music and so on, that

8

under those circumstances, the police could not go in

9

to -- to quiet things down?

10

MR. STUDEBAKER:

Do I understand you to say

Correct, Your Honor.

They

11

would actually have to go out and get a warrant to

12

enter the home.

13

under the facts that you presented which would require

14

them to enter the home and bypass the warrant

15

requirement.

16

There's not an exigent circumstance

It's not severe enough under those facts.

JUSTICE ALITO:

Let's say they -- they see a

17

fight going on.

18

has to go on in the mind of the officer?

19

think, well, let me look at these people.

20

like they're -- they're strong enough to really hurt

21

each other?

22

grab some object that's lying around, a knife, a

23

baseball bat, or something, and -- and escalate the

24

violence?

25

think a reasonable officer is supposed to go through in

What kind of calculation do you think
They have to
Do they look

How likely is it that they're going to

What -- what sort of thought process do you

26
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

that situation?

2

MR. STUDEBAKER:

Justice Alito, what the

3

officer is required to do is to weigh the totality of

4

the circumstances and make a decision based upon the

5

totality of what they see.

6

situations are always fact-intensive based upon what's

7

seen on the scene.

8

before the Court, none of those facts are presented

9

that -- that would actually weigh and that was going to

10

And unfortunately, these

And in the case presented here

escalate into that type of situation.

11

The officers actually had personal, firsthand

12

knowledge of the events that were happening.

13

14

transpire through the window.

15

when the officer entered the home.

16

They

They watched the event

JUSTICE BREYER:

The exigency was over

Why can't you?

Is there any

17

case or anything that says you don't look at the whole

18

circumstance to decide if it was reasonable to enter?

19

I mean, suppose I just wrote an opinion, for a

20

hypothetical's sake, that says, look, there was so much

21

noise at 3:00 in the morning nobody could even hear a

22

knock and he looks in the window, sees one of the -- a

23

kid there being held, who's obviously been drinking

24

under age.

25

him in the nose and blood starts to run or -- and under

He takes a swing at somebody else and pokes

MR. STUDEBAKER:

5

or not.

noise stopped?

10

MR. STUDEBAKER:

It -- shortly after the

11

smack in the face by the juvenile, Your Honor, the

12

officer entered the home, and by his testimony, it

13

abated right after he entered the home.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

No.

The question is whether

15

he could go into the house, and are you saying that

16

before he went into the house, all the noise stopped?

17
18

MR. STUDEBAKER:

It had not stopped.

No, it

had not, Your Honor.

1

repeating myself.

2

the law makes that opinion wrong?

3

But what I want to know is what in

MR. STUDEBAKER:

Your Honor, what makes that

4

opinion wrong, based upon the facts that were

5

presented, is the fact that the -- there was no warrant

6

achieved in the situation.

7

under exigent circumstances --

8
9

JUSTICE BREYER:

If the officer is entering

And there are two reasons

why he didn't want to go get a warrant.

It would take

10

about half an hour, at which time all the neighbors are

11

awake, and they have to lose an hour of sleep.

12

addition to that, the underage drinking will continue

13

for another half an hour or an hour.

14

to that, somebody else might get poked in the nose.

15

those are the reasons why -- or worse.

16

the reasons why he thought it was reasonable to go in.

17
18

MR. STUDEBAKER:

And in addition
So

So those are

That may be what he thought,

not the officer --

And in

JUSTICE BREYER:

Those are the reasons why it

was reasonable to go in.

21

MR. STUDEBAKER:

Yes, Your Honor.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now, what's wrong with that

MR. STUDEBAKER:

What's wrong with the

23
24
25

opinion?

opinion, Your Honor, is it still requires a warrant

29
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

under the situation.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now, suppose I were to say

3

at the end of that it doesn't require a warrant because

4

it was not unreasonable objectively to go in under

5

those circumstances.

6

to tell me why.

7

What I'm looking for you to do is

MR. STUDEBAKER:

Your Honor, the -- if

8

they're going to enter the home, there has to be,

9

obviously, a serious situation that's going to arise.

10

And so with the -- the presentation which you

11

presented, it's not serious enough to require the

12

sidestepping of a warrant in the situation.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Studebaker, I'm not sure

14

that even the noise wasn't enough to justify what the

15

police did here.

16

they went in, they -- they heard all this noise and

17

they saw the punch.

18

and announced that they were the police.

As -- as I recall, they -- before

They pushed open the screen door

circumstances, which is what they were there for, it's

18

got to be more serious than a -- a loud party, the

19

situation.

20

The -- the -- to bypass that

And ironically, the -- the testimony of the

21

officer, which I guess there was a dispute about

22

whether that was there or not because it's not

23

specifically in the findings that the trial judge made

Of course, he had to raise

I mean, there was a lot of noise going.
It just seems to me so unreasonable, when a

noise and the neighbors have complained, that he can't

do the minimum that's necessary to get their attention

too much noise?

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

1

somewhere, or is that just your opinion?

2

MR. STUDEBAKER:

It's my opinion, Your Honor.

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

Now, what I

4

would like to know is what does it say in a case

5

because I -- I agree, at 3:00 in the morning, it might

6

not appear to many people to be unreasonable when the

7

party is so loud that no one can sleep, that they have

8

to take an extra hour or half an hour or 40 minutes to

9

just tell the people inside the house, knock it off.

10

Now, is there a case somewhere that says -- I guess, we

11

could take a poll or something, but is there a case

12

that casts some light on this?

13

MR. STUDEBAKER:

Your Honor, I believe Mincey

14

itself requires the -- the seriousness of the offense

15

be evaluated, and further --

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

Which case?

17

MR. STUDEBAKER:

Mincey v. Arizona.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

Was that involving a -- is

19

that in this Court?

Yes?

20

MR. STUDEBAKER:

Yes.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

And was that involving a

party or noise, or what was it involving?
MR. STUDEBAKER:

No, it was not involving a

What was in question was

the search after the premises had been secured.

MR. STUDEBAKER:

helps you because here, in the course of securing the

needed.

14

Court's question, there is nothing that I'm aware of

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't understand that.

2

MR. STUDEBAKER:

Your Honor, and I think the

3

reason the -- the trial court and -- is concerned about

4

the knocking issue is it's, if you will, the baseline

5

requirement under the Fourth Amendment, under the facts

6

of this case, was to make their presence known by

7

knocking.

9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but the -- as I

understand the -- the trial court, he accepted the

10

probability that the knock would be futile, and yet he

11

thought as a formality it was nonetheless required.

12

do you understand the trial court to have taken that

13

position?

14

correct as a statement of Fourth Amendment law?

I do, Your Honor, and I know

3

that that's a -- a complicated issue, but it's still a

requirement.

7

But further, the court -- the trial court

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Why should there be no

futility exception?

8

MR. STUDEBAKER:

Well, even if there is, Your

9

Honor, the trial court did not just say that -- there

10

-- he -- the evidence was gone because of the failure

11

to knock.

12

as well as the appellate courts, didn't rise to the

13

level which would require entry into the home.

14

The trial court found that the exigencies,

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, that -- that may be on

15

your argument that noise is never sufficient to

16

dispense with a warrant requirement.

17

me that in -- in the reasonableness analysis that the

18

trial court was going through, the trial court was

19

saying even if it would probably be futile, it is not a

20

reasonable entry without a knock.

21

you -- you accept that and you think the trial court

22

was correct, that there is no futility exception.

a -- a futile act in the name of reasonableness?
MR. STUDEBAKER:

Your Honor, first, it

3

wouldn't have taken any effort at all to follow through

4

on this, and even though this Court has ruled that, you

5

know, there is mandatory knock and announce -- or

6

requirement, with some exceptions, I don't believe that

7

this is one of those exceptions.

8

10

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No one is denying that.

I

mean, we've had a knock and announcement requirement
for 900 years.

11

MR. STUDEBAKER:

Correct.

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But the question is do you

13

have to knock and announce when, on the facts before

14

you, it is apparent that nobody will hear the knock and

15

it will just be a wasted gesture.

16

MR. STUDEBAKER:

Yes.

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Why?

18

MR. STUDEBAKER:

Because, Your Honor, it's

19

our position that it's one of the -- the threshold

20

requirements to protect somebody when they're inside

21

their home is to make that effort.

22

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But isn't the standard of

23

the Fourth Amendment a reasonableness standard, and

24

isn't there something bizarre about saying

25

reasonableness requires a totally futile gesture?

1

MR. STUDEBAKER:

That was the finding of the

2

court, Your Honor, the trial court, that it was futile.

3

But, again, when an officer is placed in that

4

situation to say that if an officer can decide whether

5

something is futile or not, that could actually -- then

6

that exception, if we're not careful, absorb that rule.

7

So I --

8
9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, yes, that's why courts

review these things.

10

MR. STUDEBAKER:

Correct, and that is --

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And if the court says, yes,

12

based on the evidence before me, it would have been

13

futile, do you think Fourth Amendment reasonableness

14

requires the court and ultimately the officer to demand

15

the knock anyway?

16

MR. STUDEBAKER:

Personally?

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay.

it would be appendix page 47.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes, but what it says

right after that to explain is it would have been

sufficient.

knock, and that would have supplied all that was

20

necessary.

What he -- what he should have done was

Your Honor, and again, this

isn't the, maybe, best worded order that the city had

prepared in this case when they -- when the -- it was

When I look at it, I look at two different sentences

further, what he should have done was knock.

There was no exigent circumstances, and

3

But further, the two appellate courts that

4

heard this matter before, did rule on the exigent

5

circumstances because that's what the Petitioners in

6

this Court had brought before the appellate courts, and

7

they found that in both the Utah Court of Appeals and

8

the Utah Supreme Court, that the exigent circumstances

9

weren't sufficient enough.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You know, maybe -- maybe

11

you're taking our announce and a knock -- knock and

literally.

little bit more vocal, then they noticed him there.

gradually, as each participant in the melee became

aware of his presence, did they sort of stop.

down immediately.

seemed to be puzzled by your failure to raise the Utah

would appear that you're correct in the fact that the

the fact is that it seems to have been briefed under

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY S. GRAY

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. GRAY:

Thank you, counsel.

Just a matter of clarification

initially.

12

misdemeanor, punishable by up to 90 days in jail under

13

the -- how it was charged here.

14

class C misdemeanor, and contributing to the

15

delinquency of a minor is a class B misdemeanor,

16

punishable by up to 6 months in jail.

17

that's what -- but the officers -- and again, this case

18

isn't about what they were ultimately charged with.

19

It's whether or not they had a reasonable basis to

20

believe that immediate intervention was necessary.

21

Disorderly conduct is a class C

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Also intoxication is a

So that's --

Don't you think the

22

evidence that was available without going in the house

23

would have supported all those charges?

24
25

MR. GRAY:

Not the intoxication.

The

intoxication has to be --

defendants in this case were the adults inside the

home.

JUSTICE STEVENS:
adults were intoxicated.

MR. GRAY:

JUSTICE STEVENS:

10

Yes.
Well, that's a serious

crime in Utah I guess.

MR. GRAY:

16

JUSTICE STEVENS:

17

(Laughter.)

18

MR. GRAY:

And -And what's your response?

Normally -- normally intoxication

19

-- we think of it as -- as public intoxication, and --

20

and that's where it's usually prosecuted and where we

21

find it.

22

where it disturbs others outside of the home, and

23

that's what happened here.

24
25

But intoxication that can become an offense

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
you have two questions presented.

Counsel, you have -The second is

whether this was sufficiently -- sufficiently exigent

2

to fall under the exigent circumstances.

3

was whether the test should turn on the officer's

4

subjective motivation.

5

about that this morning.

6

these facts?

7

MR. GRAY:

8

different tests.

9

tests.

But the first

I haven't heard much
How is that presented on

Well, the court created two

The Utah court created two different

And under the one test, it examined whether or

10

not the officers were primarily motivated by a desire

11

to arrest or search for evidence.

12

Utah Supreme Court, concluded that they did -- that

13

they were -- their motives were primarily law

14

enforcement motives because they did not render aid.

15

And this Court has repeatedly held that an officer's

16

subjective motives play no part in the objective

17

reasonableness test, and it should not do so here.

18

Now, the court, the

Justice Ginsburg, you indicated that there

19

was no -- no suggestion of domestic violence.

20

Supreme Court actually acknowledged that where violence

21

is seen in a home between adults and, for example, a

22

younger person, that there would be reason to believe

23

that domestic violence is possibly present.

24

what -- now, the court refused to look at that because

25

there was no finding that the inhabitants or the --

2

those involved were actually cohabitants.
Of course, this Court has never required that

3

officers have a certainty of the situation, only a

4

reasonable belief, and they clearly have that.

5

And in any event, whether or not it's

6

domestic violence or some other type of violence, it's

7

something that I believe this Court in Mincey

8

recognized, that officers can and -- and probably

9

should -- maybe they didn't go that far, but it would be

10

our position that officers should intervene in the face of

11

violence, and that's what the officers did here.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

My point was simply that

13

this was not a 911 call from a distressed spouse.

14

was a neighbor saying they're keeping me up at night,

15

so that the -- the police response was to the noise,

16

not to the violence.

17

MR. GRAY:

This

The initial response was clearly

18

to the noise, but once the officers arrived, it became

19

apparent that there was violence ongoing in the house

20

and that's how the officers proceeded.

21

If there are no further questions, we would

22

ask the Court to reverse the decision of the Utah

23

Supreme Court.

Thank you.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
