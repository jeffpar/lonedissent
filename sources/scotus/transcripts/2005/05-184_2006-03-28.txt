MR. KATYAL:

Justice Stevens, and may it please

the Court:
We ask this Court to preserve the status quo to

11

require that the President respect time-honored

12

limitations on military commissions.

13

in articles 21 and 36 of the Uniform Code of Military

14

Justice, require no more than that the President try

15

offenses that are, indeed, war crimes and to conduct

16

trials according to the minimal procedural requirements of

17

the UCMJ and the laws of war themselves.

18

not represent any change in the way military commissions

19

have historically operated.

20

Congress's authority under the Define and Punish Clause to

21

codify limits on commissions, limits that this Court has

22

historically enforced to avoid presidential blank checks.

23

These limits, placed

These limits do

Rather, they reflect

And because this commission transgresses those limits, it

24

should be struck down and the district court order

25

reinstated.

version of the bill that passed the Senate on November

That's correct.
And the President, who signed

this bill, never saw the prior language.

17

MR. KATYAL:

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That is correct.
So, why should we attribute to

19

both the House and to the President a knowledge of the

20

prior version of the legislation?

21

So

the House presumably never saw the prior --

12

16

Where was that change made from

MR. KATYAL:

Well, because the language itself

22

was, I think, the subject of an immense amount of debate.

23

And, indeed, when the language was --

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

MR. KATYAL:

the second reason for you to believe that this case is

grandfathered under the existing DTA.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

However, we do think that is

But isn't that -What, in addition to this

15

case -- I mean, this case is pending in the U.S. Supreme

16

Court.

17

when this law comes into effect.

18

There are many cases pending in the district court

MR. KATYAL:

What about those cases?

We believe that, as the cosponsor

19

said, on November 15th when they introduce the final

20

version of the language, that all of those cases are

21

grandfathered with respect to the H(1) effective-date

22

provision and the E(1) jurisdiction-stripping provision.

23

However, that still leaves in place the Government's main

24

argument in the D.C. Circuit below, which is that the E(2)

25

provision governing CSRT and final decisions, and the H(2)

6
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

provision governing final decisions of military-- final

2

decisions of CSRTs, truncates all of the review that is

3

currently in the D.C. Circuit.

4

-- it's certainly possible, though it's not, of course,

5

presented in this case, to read the DTA as truncating the vast

6

majority of claims at Guantanamo in current pending cases.

7

Of course, that isn't the issue before you here.

So, it's certainly plausible

8

The issue before you here is simply the Hamdan case, and

9

there was -- and there was a strong -- the strong desire

10

by the Congress not to interfere with this Court's

11

traditionally exercised jurisdiction.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Please go over that again.

13

not -- I'm not sure I understood -- I understood your

14

response.

15

MR. KATYAL:

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

17
18

I'm

Okay.
You say that it could be read

to preclude cases in the lower courts, but not here.
MR. KATYAL:

That's right, cases in which there

19

is a final CSRT decision; that is, that the Government's

20

argument in the D.C. Circuit, Justice Scalia, is that

21

there are two different ways in which the DTA truncated

22

the review of Guantanamo cases.

23

jurisdiction-stripping provision applies to pending cases.

24

That, we reject.

25

One is the claim that the

1

claim that the E(2) provision governing final decisions of

2

CSRTs, which does, of course, apply to pending cases, as

3

the plain text says, eliminates and truncates a vast -

4

majority of the detainees' claims.

5

That is the provision --

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Does that mean, in practical

7

terms, that the -- that the -- that the other claims that

8

are in the district court get transferred to the circuit,

9

the circuit is bound by the limitations that you've just

10

described, and, at the end of the day, the complaining

11

parties in those cases can raise the question whether they

12

-- whether Congress could properly have truncated them, as

13

it did, but it's simply got to wait?

14

MR. KATYAL:

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

16

MR. KATYAL:

Absolutely.

And --

Okay.

-- to be clear, that's not the

17

position we're saying that is the DTA.

3

it's a statute that alters substantive rights of Mr.

4

Hamdan.

5

eliminates question 2, upon which certiorari was granted,

6

which is compliance with the Geneva Conventions.

7

addition, it alters entirely what both courts below found,

which is that Mr. Hamdan has a pretrial right, a right

analogous to Abney versus United States, to bring his

13

the early cases that this Court decided, on pretrial

14

habeas.

That pretrial right is something that

In addition, we believe that --

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

Why does it -- why does it

17

affect the scope of the review that he could get

18

eventually?

19

review of whether the use of the standards or procedures

20

that were used by the commission to reach a final decision

21

is consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United

22

States?

23

might want to make later on?

24
25

If there's a final decision, there can be

Why doesn't that encompass any claim that he

wants to give, well, then it essentially means that the --

5

that the President has the ability to block habeas corpus

7

it doesn't turn on -- you can't walk into court right

8

after you're convicted, under the DTA; you can only walk

9

into court after a final decision.

It's a change from the

14

And so, effectively, this reading would give a

I mean, criminal litigation

16

There generally is not any interlocutory -- any

interlocutory appeal.

MR. KATYAL:

And what you say could happen in

They could delay indefinitely and postpone

25

And that's why it's different than the ordinary criminal

context you're positing -- and I'm thinking of a case like

Schlesinger versus Councilman, a court-martial case --

7

what the Court has said is that it's the -- the predicate

16

ordinary criminal context, the thing that, as this Court

17

said, stops military justice from being lawless is the

18

Congress of the United States setting clear limits on the

19

use of military justice.

20

Here,

It's all been made by the

Now, if those limits had been observed, if this

rules of courts-martial, we wouldn't be here.

point is that they don't, and that it falls outside of the

24

well-recognized abstention exception for courts-martial

25

cases.

1

In addition, we believe that to further -- to

2

further on -- Justice Alito, on your point -- this Court

3

has already said in the military commission context that a

4

different rule applies.

5

to hear a military-commission challenge before the

6

commission was over, and the reason why it did so was, it

7

said that the public interest required adjudication of

8

these issues.

9

in that case than it is here.

In Quirin, this Court rushed in

And the public interest is no less severe
That is, this is a military

10

commission that is literally unbounded by the laws,

11

Constitution, and treaties of the United States.

12

you adopt the Government's position here, it effectively

13

replicates the blank check that this Court rejected in

14

Hamdi.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And if

Could I come back to Justice

16

Alito's question as to what the normal procedure would be

17

in criminal cases?

18

to the makeup of the tribunal in a criminal case.

19

-- is it the normal practice that you would get to raise

20

that challenge?

21

disqualified for some other reason.

22

raise that challenge before the criminal case is filed?

Suppose you're -- you have a challenge

Let's say one of the judges is

11

Oh, I know --

-- the matter is --- the merits of the

I'm just talking about the timing of the issue.
MR. KATYAL:

Well, I do think that there's an

12

integral relationship to the -- between the two.

13

that the predicate for abstention has always been that

14

Congress, or some other entity, has fairly balanced the

15

rights of both sides.

Here, you don't have that

16

fundamental guarantee.

Indeed, if you adopt the

17

Government's reading here, the -- they have said that they

18

want to try 75 military-commission cases or so in the

19

first wave.

20

take place without even the most basic question of what

21

the parameters are that these commissions are to operate

22

under.

23

That is,

You will then be left with 75 trials that

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, when you say Congress

24

hasn't fairly balanced it, I mean, I guess that depends

25

upon your reading of the statute.

If, indeed, you read it

13
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

the way the Government reads it, they would assert that

2

Congress did consider these military commissions and

3

thought that it was okay to wait until they had completed

4

their work before full review was provided.

5

MR. KATYAL:

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

7
8
9

But -I mean, it's sort of a -- you

know, a -- you're running in a circle.
MR. KATYAL:

Well, that's precisely, Justice

Scalia, our argument, that I don't think one can consider

10

the abstention claim -- and this is what I believe both

11

courts below had held -- you can't consider the

12

abstention claim without deciding the underlying merits.

13

And if you believe that the -- that Congress has fairly

14

balanced the rights and are compliant with the UCMJ and

15

the like, then I don't think -- then you're reaching the

16

merits, and there's no abstention holding.

17

So, if I could turn to the merits -- the merits

18

challenges.

19

question number 1 and whether this military commission

20

states a charge that violates the laws of war.

believe it doesn't, for two essential reasons.

The first thing I'd like to discuss on -- is

was -- there was an article, article 134 of the UCMJ,

which was a criminal statute, and it had been interpreted

6

to punish drug dealing.

facts showed the requisite amount of drug dealing to

violate the Uniform Code."

10

would be closer, at least, to accepted practice in the

reasons.

that the tribunal is authorized and that all of its

which is not a violation of the laws of war.

So far, Justice Ginsburg, all that

the CSRT isn't in the record, so we don't really know.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

2

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

3
4

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Justice Stevens, and may it

please the Court:

5

The executive branch has long exercised the

6

authority to try enemy combatants by military commissions.

7

That authority was part and parcel of George Washington's

8

authority as Commander in Chief of the Revolutionary

9

Forces, as dramatically illustrated by the case of Major

10

Andre.

11

Constitution.

12

And that authority was incorporated into the

Congress has repeatedly recognized and

13

sanctioned that authority.

14

extended the jurisdiction of the court-martials, Congress

15

was at pains to emphasize that that extension did not come

16

in derogation of the jurisdiction of military commissions.

17

And in its most recent action, Congress clearly did not

18

operate as somebody who viewed the military commissions as

19

ultra vires.

20

review at all for charges resulting in a conviction of

21

less than 10 years.

22

Indeed, each time Congress has

They offered no immediate review, and no

Of course, even more clearly, Congress's most

23

recent action made it clear that the courts no longer have

24

jurisdiction over pre-enforcement challenges.

25

that I'd like to turn first.

And it's to

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But let me just ask this

2

question, Mr. Clement.

3

commissions generally enforced over the years, beginning

4

with George Washington and so forth?

5

regulations or American law or foreign law?

6

basic sources of law that they can enforce?

7

What sources of law have the

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Just Army
What are the

Well, what I would say,

8

Justice Stevens, is, they basically enforce the laws of

9

war.

At times, there are obviously United States sources

10

that are relevant to that.

11

manual or something that says specifically that certain

12

offenses are triable under the law of war, that would be

13

very instructive in the tribunals.

14

that I don't think are principally relevant here, you

15

might also have war courts that were set up to deal with

16

municipal offenses.

17

then, they would look to U.S. law.

18
19

Obviously, if you have a field

In certain situations

But that's not what we have.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And

And what we have here is

enforcement of the laws of war.

20

GENERAL CLEMENT:

That is right.

And, of

21

course, in this context, you have a controlling executive

22

act in the form of the regulations themselves that make it

23

clear that the executive views things like conspiracy to

24

violate the laws of war to be actionable under the laws of

25

war.

37
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Now --

2

JUSTICE STEVENS:

If -- just one hypothetical.

3

Assume that the laws of war do not prohibit conspiracy.

4

Just assume -- I know you disagree with that.

5

President, by his action, add conspiracy as a triable

6

offense by a commission?

7

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Could the

I think if you did that,

8

Justice Stevens, it would present the very difficult

9

question that this Court has never squarely addressed,

10

which is, does the President have some authority to try,

11

by military commission, beyond that which Congress has

12

joined him in?

13

Congress's sanction to any military commissions, to the

14

extent they try crimes that are triable by the law of war.

15

So, in that sense, I think, as long as this Court

16

construes consistent with over 100 years of United States

17

tradition and history, the conspiracy to commit a law -- a

18

violation of the law of war is a war crime, then you don't

19

have to reach that --

Obviously, article 21 of the UCMJ gives

20

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, if --

21

GENERAL CLEMENT:

-- difficult issue.

22

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It's easy if it is a war

23

crime.

24

concluded that it were not, and just -- and I'm asking --

25

can the question add an additional crime that the

I'm trying to wrestle with the question of, if we

38
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

commission could try?

2

GENERAL CLEMENT:

I think he --

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

You think he could.

4

GENERAL CLEMENT:

I think we would take the

5

position that he could, as a matter of pure constitutional

6

power.

7

case on the theory that conspiracy is outside of the laws

8

of war.

9

tradition.

10

I don't think, though -- he has not acted in this

He's acted inconsistent with 150 years of

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So, the basic position you're

11

asserting is that we have -- that the -- this commission

12

intends to try a violation of the laws of war.

13

laws of war then have any application to the procedures

14

that they have to follow?

15

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Yes.

And do the

I mean, in the sense

16

that I think that if there were -- there -- the other side

17

is certainly able to argue, before the military

18

commissions, that certain procedural provisions or the

19

like are prohibited by the law of war or give them some

20

greater entitlement.

21

cases like Madsen, I don't think that the law of war is --

22

you know, extensively regulates procedure.

23

as the Madsen Court recognized, Congress's approach to

24

military commissions has been radically different than its

25

approach to court-martials.

Now, as this Court has recognized in

And, indeed,

In court-martials, they

39
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

regulate every jot and tittle of the procedure.

2

the UCMJ and its provisions for court-martials applies,

3

then the defendants are going to get not just Miranda, but

4

Miranda plus, and a whole panoply of rights.

And if

5

If, on the other hand, this Court follows the

6

precedents in Madsen, it will recognize that only those

7

nine provisions of the UCMJ that expressly reference

8

military commissions will apply, and the rest is left to a

9

much more common-law, war-court approach, where there's

10

much greater flexibility.

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

What do you -- what do you make

12

of the argument that Mr. Katyal just alluded to, that if

13

you take the -- as you do -- take the position that the

14

commissions are operating under the laws of war, you've

15

got to accept that one law of war here is the Geneva

16

Convention right to a presumption of POW status unless

17

there is a determination by a competent tribunal

18

otherwise, with the -- among other things, the rights that

19

that carries.

20

don't you go from the frying pan into the fire, in effect,

21

when you take the position that the laws of war are what

22

the tribunal is applying?

23

I mean, how -- do you -- why not -- why

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Souter, I don't

24

think there's any frying pan effect or fire effect,

25

precisely because what you have with respect to the claim

40
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

that the Geneva Conventions applies -- okay, that claim

2

could be brought to the military commissions, but they

3

could adjudicate it and say that the Geneva Conventions

4

don't apply here, for any number of reasons.

5

that this idea that there needs to be an article 5

6

proceeding --

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And I think

Well, but you're -- are you

8

saying that the -- that the commission will adjudicate POW

9

status under the Geneva Convention?

In other words, are

10

you stipulating that the Geneva Convention does apply, so

11

that the only argument left between you and Mr. Katyal

12

would be whether the commission itself was a competent

13

tribunal to make the determination?

19

apply.

I mean, I think the disagreement is more
What I would say is, a claim could

Now, just because the Geneva Convention does apply

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

22

applies as part of the law of war?

23

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, do you agree that it

Well, I don't think,

24

consistent with the position of the executive, that the

25

Geneva Convention applies in this particular conflict.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But that, I guess, is the

2

problem that I'm having.

3

domestic authority to set up a commission, you say, the

4

President is operating under the laws of war recognized by

5

Congress, but for purposes of a claim to status, and,

6

hence, the procedural rights that go with that status,

7

you're saying the laws of war don't apply.

8

see how you can have it both ways.

For purposes of determining the

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But he is entitled to make a

claim under them to determine whether, on the merits, he

16

is entitled.

17

Isn't that entailed by your position?

GENERAL CLEMENT:

I think it is, Your Honor, but

18

let me just say that that's a claim that he could have

19

brought before the CSRTs, and that is a claim he can still

20

bring before the military commissions.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But I have --

22

GENERAL CLEMENT:

structural invalidity to the military commission, that he

but we don't think it would be -- and that argument would

10

be made; but, if by some other, sort of, principle of the

We think that most of those claims -- to

language to allow any challenge that is being brought

18

here, with the possible exception of the treaty challenge.

There is a reference to the first military order.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

GENERAL CLEMENT:

All of that,
So, I would

Would you -And -Would you --- I think the language is

23

capacious enough if the treaty challenge is what you

24

thought was very important, the D.C. Circuit, at the end

25

of the day, could decide whether or not there is a

requirement that the treaty challenge be brought.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

General Clement, if you can

3

straighten me out on the piece that you read about

4

"consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United

5

States," I thought that it was the Government's position

6

that these enemy combatants do not have any rights under

7

the Constitution and laws of the United States.

8
9

GENERAL CLEMENT:
Ginsburg.

That is true, Justice

And Congress, in this act, was very careful to

10

basically write without prejudice to the answer to that

11

question.

12

side would have their argument.

13

that we don't have any argument on, that was something

14

that wasn't before this Court, say, in the Rasul decision,

15

was the fact that the procedures that the military has

16

promulgated are going to be enforceable under this

17

exclusive review provision.

18

some law to apply now under this exclusive review

19

provision.

So, we would have that argument.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

21

GENERAL CLEMENT:

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The other

What this act provides

So, there at least will be

But what -So, that -But how will the question,

23

whether the laws in the United -- and Constitution -- of

24

the United States, whether these petitioners have any

25

claim to state under the laws and Constitution of the

2

provided doesn't open up that question.

3

narrow review that's given to the D.C. Circuit.

4

Because as I read -- the review that's

GENERAL CLEMENT:

It's a very

Well, Justice Ginsburg, I

5

certainly think that Petitioner will be up there arguing

6

that Eisentrager is no longer good law, not just as a

7

statutory matter, as a constitutional matter, and those

8

arguments will be made.

9

certainly the arguments about article 21 and Article 36,

Without respect to that,

10

that are very much the centerpiece of their argument

11

here today, would also be available to the D.C. Circuit.

12

And if there's some constitutional requirement that that

13

review be slightly broader or slightly narrower, that

14

seems like something that can better be adjudicated in the

15

context of a concrete case at the point that that review

16

is sought.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

18

GENERAL CLEMENT:

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is there -But one thing I -Is there -- is there any

20

review in this Court, following the D.C. Circuit, either

21

the original classification or the conviction -- is there

22

-- does this Court have any part in the scheme?

23

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Yes, Justice Ginsburg, there

24

would be 1254 review.

25

of appeals, then the case would be under -- under E(3),

Once the provision is in the court

51
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

the review provision -- then the case would be in the

2

court of appeals for purposes of this Court's 1254

3

jurisdiction.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

I still don't see the answer to

5

my question, which had two parts.

6

which is what's cross-referenced, refers to Military

7

Commission Order Number 1, August 31, 2005, or any

8

successor military order.

9

that's created the commission by the President, is an

10

order which was November 13, 2001, not a successor to

11

2005.

12

As to the language, (a)

The order, as I understand it,

But leaving the language aside, what I'm mostly

13

interested in, because I think your interpretation

14

inevitably creates it, is, what is the answer to the claim

15

that it is not constitutional for Congress, without

16

suspending the writ of habeas corpus, to accomplish the

17

same result by removing jurisdiction from the courts in a

18

significant number of cases, even one?

19

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Breyer, let me

20

answer that question in two parts, which is to say that I

21

think that this case, and most of the cases, don't raise a

22

serious Suspension Clause problem, for the simple reason

23

that I think deferring review or channeling it to the

24

court of appeals does not amount to a suspension.

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

I listed four sets of cases

52
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

that I don't see how you could possibly shoehorn into E(2)

2

and E(3), even if you are able to shoehorn this one.

3

my language was designed to make you see how difficult it

4

is.

5

GENERAL CLEMENT:

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

7
8
9

And

Well, but -I listed four that I don't

see how anybody could shoehorn into that.
GENERAL CLEMENT:

But, with respect, Justice

Breyer, I think that cuts both ways, because I don't think

10

there's any particular interpretation of these provisions

11

on the table before this Court that's going to eliminate

12

those potential Suspension Clause issues.

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But the whole point, it seems

14

to me, of the argument, is, should we not consider the

15

significance of those very questions, because, if we

16

don't, as Justice Breyer said, at the end of the day, as

17

you describe it, we will have to face the serious

18

constitutional question whether Congress can, in fact,

19

limit jurisdiction without suspending habeas corpus?

20

whole point is to grapple with them now, and to -- and to

21

treat them in a way that allows for this adjudication, so

22

that we avoid this constitutional difficulty tomorrow.

23

GENERAL CLEMENT:

The

Well, Justice Souter, first of

24

all, I would think general principles of constitutional

25

avoidance would say deferring the constitutional question

53
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

is a good thing, not a bad thing.

2

--

3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

The one point I would

We may not have to reach the

4

constitutional question.

5

constitutional avoidance hopes for.

6

That's what -- that's what

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Right.

But I don't see any

7

argument on the other side that's really a constitutional

8

avoidance argument.

9

Their principal argument is --

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, the argument --

10

GENERAL CLEMENT:

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- don't apply this --- the other side -- if you

12

want the argument, the other side is, there are several

13

hundred cases already pending.

14

accept your interpretation, we know we have to reach the

15

constitutional argument.

16

interpretation, since all these cases, several hundred of

17

them, are already there, it might be: new ones won't be

18

brought.

19

therefore, what is your answer to --

20

GENERAL CLEMENT:

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

22
23

And, therefore, if we

If we reject your

But, of course, "new ones won't" might.

And,

Well --- the question that this is

unconstitutional -- if not here, in other places?
GENERAL CLEMENT:

And, Justice Breyer, what I

24

would say is that our interpretation basically provides

25

for pending claims exactly the way that Congress did.

54
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

With respect to any future claims that might be brought,

2

there may or may not be a constitutional question.

3

And if I could turn to our interpretation of the

4

DTA, it's the only one that really, I think, reads the

5

various provisions in the statute in harmony.

6

Court's decision in Bruner, and in a host of other cases,

7

says that when Congress eliminates jurisdiction, pending

8

cases fall, unless there's a savings clause.

9

thing to a savings clause in this statute, in E(1), is the

Now, this

The closest

10

provision that says "except pursuant to Section 1005."

11

And I think that's important, because if Congress wanted

12

to put in a savings clause of the kind that this Court

13

seems to refer to in Bruner, and that would certainly be

14

consistent with Senator Levin's intent, it would have been

15

very easy.

16

they could have said "except for pending cases."

17

Instead of saying "except for Section 1005,"

The choice is important, because what does

18

Section 1005 provide?

19

E(2) and E(3).

20

fashion, says that, just in case there's any question

21

about it, those provisions on E(2) and E(3) apply to

22

pending claims governed by those sections.

23

word's important.

24

"pending claims."

25

It provides the exclusive review in

And then, H(2), in very complementary

I think every

It doesn't say "pending cases," it says

Congress understood two important things.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

were no cases currently pending under E(2) and E(3),

2

because Congress was creating E(2) and E(3).

3

that most of the cases before the D.C. Courts had some

4

claims that were pure challenges to the final CSRT

5

determination and other claims.

6

H(2) says that, to the extent those cases involve claims

7

governed by E(2) and E(3), they are preserved under E(2)

8

and E(3); otherwise, this -- there's no savings clause

9

that covers those claims, and their jurisdiction is

10

removed.

It also knew

permissible exercise of the power to suspend the writ, or

18

do you say it is not a suspension of the writ?

When they do take away some jurisdiction of some

GENERAL CLEMENT:

I think both, ultimately.

I

21

JUSTICE STEVENS:

22

[Laughter.]

23

GENERAL CLEMENT:

It can't be both.

Well, I -- I don't see why I

24

can't have alternative arguments here, as for anywhere

25

else, Justice Stevens.

We think that Congress, in this

56
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

action, did not do anything that triggers the suspension

2

of the writ.

But if you think that --

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, that --

4

GENERAL CLEMENT:

-- it did, I think that --

5

JUSTICE STEVENS:

-- that's your position, they

6

did not suspend the writ.

7

justifiable suspension of the writ.

8

GENERAL CLEMENT:

9

You're not arguing that it's a

Well, I think that the terms of

the Suspension Clause would be satisfied here because of

10

the exigencies of 9/11.

11

the position that Congress consciously thought that it was

12

suspending the writ, then I would say no.

If the question is, am I taking

13

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Okay.

14

GENERAL CLEMENT:

And if you think, in order for

15

there be to a -- to be a valid suspension, Congress has to

16

do it consciously, then I think you could see why the

17

arguments are mutually exclusive.

if Congress, sort of, stumbles upon a suspension of the

writ, but the preconditions are satisfied, that would

still be constitutionally valid.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

23

GENERAL CLEMENT:

24

JUSTICE SOUTER:

25

My view would be that

So, I think that may be

Isn't there a -I mean -Isn't there a pretty good

argument that a suspension of the writ of Congress is just

about the most stupendously significant act that the

2

Congress of the United States can take?

3

we ought to be at least a little slow to accept your

4

argument that it can be done from pure inadvertence?

5

GENERAL CLEMENT:

And, therefore,

Well, a couple of things,

6

Justice Souter.

7

talking about is suspending the right as to citizens

8

within the Continental United States, but all Congress did

9

here is restore the law to the understanding of the law

I would agree with you if what we were

10

that had prevailed for 200 years.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Now, this Court

If we have to --- in Rasul.

us with the position of the United States that the

Congress may validly suspend it inadvertently.

Is it also your point when

where there's any question of --

that Congress, here, tried to amend the habeas statute.

intent on the part of Congress to suspend the writ under

its article I power.

5

GENERAL CLEMENT:

With respect, Justice Souter,

I don't think making a retroactivity analysis or holding

here is going to spare you the trouble of dealing with the

Suspension Clause argument.

worth noting that this Court addressed the specificity

10

with which the statute applied separately from the

What made ex parte McArdle so unique is,

that unusual, and it's certainly happened several times

effect of eliminating jurisdiction in this Court over a

commissions in a real war than, certainly, the use of

military commissions against the Medoc Indians or any

17

the events of 9/11 speak to the fact that this is a war

18

where the laws of war are involved.

19

This is much more of a call for military

I think

As to whether or not the law of war encompasses

20

the crime of conspiracy to violate the laws of war, we

21

think that is clearly established.

22

He makes it very

And this Court saw it in the Kearing case,

although it didn't reach that element of the charge.
Now, I think it's very important to understand

12

that history, because the most relevant text on this

13

question is article 21's reference to the law of war.

14

as this Court was crystal clear in the Madsen case, what

15

that reference is, is Congress's effort, when it extended

16

the jurisdiction of the courts-martials to include more

17

and more crimes, that it didn't want to crowd out the

18

military jurisdiction of the military commissions just

19

because they had concurrent jurisdiction.

20

in Madsen, said what Congress authorized was the

21

jurisdiction of the military commissions as it existed in

22

1916, and then presumably again when it passed article 21

23

of the UCMJ, the jurisdiction that existed as of 1950.

24

Well, in 1960, you could try conspiracies to violate the

25

law of war.

And

And this Court,

In 1950, you could violate conspiracies to

1
2

the law of war.
So, now let me try to get to the procedures that

3

would be applicable.

4

extraordinary one, that article 36, when it says that

5

military commissions can deviate from the laws of

6

evidence, to the extent the President determines

7

necessary, except that it must apply for the -- comply with

8

the provisions of the UCMJ.

9

means is the provisions of the UCMJ that specifically

The argument that's made here is an

11

there are nine of them.

12

minimum rules.

13

And

And they impose some -- certain

But to say that that provision incorporates all

14

of the UCMJ provisions that put much higher requirements

15

on courts-martials, is to violate this Court's Madsen

16

decision, which clearly recognized that there were

17

differences between court-martials and military

18

commissions.

19

case that addressed the articles of war, article 38 is

20

identical to article 36(a) of the UCMJ, so that's not a

21

difference that matters.

22

And, although that was an act -- that was a

And, if I could say, the other thing is, that

23

just violates any normal principle of statutory

24

construction, because then the nine express references to

25

the military commissions are rendered utterly superfluous.

69
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Clearly, what Congress had in mind was that,

2

"You must comply with those provisions of the UCMJ that

3

apply specifically to the military commissions."

4

If I could make this point clear, because I

5

think it's helpful in reading the past cases, what made

6

Yamashita and other of the World War II cases so difficult

7

is that the President in that situation constituted

8

commissions that violated even the procedural rules that

9

the articles of war made specifically applicable to the

10

commissions.

11

Rutledge's dissent in the Yamashita case, he was at pains

12

to emphasize that very few of the provisions of the

13

articles of war applied to military commissions.

14

difficulty was that the -- that the military, in that

15

case, was not complying with even those provisions that

16

specifically applied to military commissions by terms.

17

And so, if you look, for example, at Justice

That's not an issue here.

And the

These military

18

commissions comply with all of the provisions of the UCMJ

19

that are specifically addressed to military commissions.

20

So, I just don't think there's a procedural problem here.

21

The import of extending article 2 jurisdiction

22

to new individuals doesn't mean that anything in

23

Yamashita, as to this point, is really no -- is still

24

relevant.

25

-- to the extent that these individuals are within article

What that does is, it takes away the argument

70
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

2, it takes away the argument that the President doesn't

2

have to even comply with those provisions of the UCMJ that

3

are expressly directed to the military commissions.

4

that's not an argument we're making here.

5

But

The argument on the other side of this is really

6

that when Congress specifies that nine rules apply to

7

military commissions, and everything else applies to

8

courts-martials, that somehow all of them have to apply to

9

the military commissions.

And as Justice Scalia's

10

question alluded to earlier, in order to accept that

11

argument, you really have to believe that what Congress

12

was doing when it was carefully preserving the military --

13

the jurisdiction of the military commissions was simply to

14

preserve the option of calling something that had to

15

comply with every single statutory requirement in the

16

court-martials.

17

They got to label it a "military commission."

18

They got to label it something else.

Clearly, if you look at the legislative history

19

of Article of War 15 and article 21, as they were

20

developed in the Madsen decision and discussed in the

21

authoritative testimony of General Crowder, that's exactly

22

what wasn't going on.

23

argument, that as we get more and more things that come

24

within the military jurisdiction of the courts-martials,

25

that somehow we're cutting back on the military

They wanted to make sure that this

commissions.

2

That's not what they wanted.

The next thing that may be lurking in the

3

question is the question of, Wwat about the Geneva

4

Conventions?

5

arguments that we have surfaced in our briefs that the

6

Geneva Conventions do not provide relief in these

7

circumstances, that they do not apply, for various

8

reasons.

9

whether this Court is going to overrule that portion of

And I think that, very importantly, we have

But the first question, at the outset, is

10

Eisentrager that basically said the Geneva Conventions are

11

not judicially enforceable.

12

Now, of course, this Court can say, "That was

13

the '29 Convention, and this is the 1949 Convention."

14

But, as the court of appeals correctly determined --

GENERAL CLEMENT:

-- Justice Black was concerned

23

about that, and said, "What are you doing reaching the

24

merits when you have, you know, said there's no

25

jurisdiction?"

But the Court, as a holding, said that the

today, at that point, Justice Jackson was quite correct

that the idea that an enemy combatant would get access to

the domestic courts of a detaining power was absolutely

impossible to read it as applying judicially enforceable

11

I think, also, since article 21 is the most

logical place you would -- you would look to any of this

that I would read that as incorporating some question

about what kind of crimes can be brought in this

found when they recognized his ability to bring this

pretrial challenge, because he is not an offender under

the laws of war until he obtains his article 5 hearing,

13

because the charge doesn't state a violation of the laws

of war, which is, itself, jurisdictional, and because it

doesn't follow the procedures of the laws of war, which
