ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER K. STRIS

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. STRIS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

11

The question presented today is whether a

12

claim for contractual reimbursement is cognizable under

13

section 502(a)(3) of ERISA.

14

In this case, MAMSI, the fiduciary of an

15

ERISA plan, seeks monetary reimbursement from the

16

Sereboffs, two beneficiaries of the plan.

17

consistently taken the position that its money claim is

18

governed exclusively by the terms of its contract with

19

the Sereboffs.

20

replaces most equitable principles.

21

MAMSI's claim is nothing more than a request for money

22

damages.

23

because MAMSI is not entitled to any relief that was

24

typically available at equity.

25

MAMSI has

This contract expressly disclaims and
At its core,

This claim is not cognizable under ERISA

JUSTICE SOUTER:

May I ask you this?

If the

3
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

-- if the day before the settlement was consummated,

2

the plan had gone into court and had said the -- the

3

beneficiaries plan to settle the case and they've

4

indicated that they're not going to give us any of the

5

settlement in accordance with the terms of the contract

6

and we want an injunction preventing their distribution

7

to anyone but -- but us, if the -- if the judge

8

believed that and believed that under the contract, the

9

plan was entitled to reimbursement, could the judge

10

have enjoined the -- the distribution of the funds to

11

the -- you know, to the extent of the plan's claim?

12

MR. STRIS:

Well, what I would say, Justice

13

Souter, is that an injunction to -- merely to prohibit

14

distribution would be equitable relief.

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

16

MR. STRIS:

Okay.

That doesn't necessarily mean,

17

however, that once that injunction issued, the plan

18

could enforce the terms of the contract under ERISA.

19
20
21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, it could enforce the

injunction.
MR. STRIS:

It could enforce the injunction

22

provided that -- that the injunction was not a

23

mandatory injunction.

24

held that a mandatory injunction under 502(a)(3),

25

saying pay us this money that's due under the contract,

1

is not --

2

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but that -- that was --

3

that was an ex post remedy and there were no

4

identifiable funds.

5

an ex ante injunction and the funds are identifiable.

6

And you are telling me that, in fact, all the -- all

7

the equity court could have said was, don't pay

8

yourself?

9

MR. STRIS:

10
11

What we're talking about here is

Well --

JUSTICE SOUTER:

It could not have said, give

the $75,000, or whatever it is, to the plan?

12

MR. STRIS:

I -- I would say two things,

13

Justice Souter.

14

don't think Great-West made the distinction that a

15

mandatory injunction was impermissible because it was

16

ex post.

17

mandatory injunction is just a clever attempt by

18

lawyers to enforce a contract for legal damages.

19

The first is that, respectfully, I

I think Great-West squarely held that a

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, when we get down to

20

clever attempts, aren't we at the clever attempt point

21

when -- when you say that they can enjoin the

22

distribution to anybody else, including themselves, but

23

they can't tell them to pay the money to -- to Great-

24

West?

25

silliness?

I mean, isn't that the point at which we get to

5
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. STRIS:

I don't -- I don't think that's

2

true, Your Honor, because we do not take the position

3

that MAMSI or an ERISA plan doesn't have alternative

4

remedies.

5

that consideration should be irrelevant because either

6

the claim is legal or equitable, and there are many

7

claims that beneficiaries have for the violation of a

8

plan term that --

9

Of course, there -- that -- that should --

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But you -- in any case, I

10

don't want to prolong this unduly.

11

there would have been some equitable claim and some

12

equitable remedy with respect to the $75,000 that --

13

that a -- a court could have taken cognizance of the

14

day before the settlement.

15

MR. STRIS:

You're saying that

Oh, to be clear, Your Honor, I

16

will suggest a few remedies that I think might be

17

available here.

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No.

I'm -- I'm just trying

19

to characterize your answer to me.

20

would be an injunction and it would be an injunction

21

typical of what courts of equity issue.

22

MR. STRIS:

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

25

pending litigation?

You said, yes, that

That's correct.
But I don't understand.
But -- an injunction

Is that the idea just until you

Washington, DC 20005

1

resolve whatever claim it is they have to -- to the

2

money, determine it.

3

equitable claim, but until you sort it out, you can

4

get an injunction to prevent them from dissipating

5

the -- the claimed funds.

6

MR. STRIS:

It may be a legal claim, an

That's correct, Mr. Chief

7

Justice, and that's extremely important because we

8

would suggest --

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But I -- I still don't

10

understand.

11

-- and I'm asked to enter an injunction, I enter an

12

injunction knowing that in the end it's going to be to

13

no purpose?

14

ultimate injury of -- of which the plaintiff has

15

standing to assert.

16
17

If I'm the -- the trial judge and you ask

I have to -- I have to be enforcing some

MR. STRIS:

That's a fair point, Justice

Kennedy, but that doesn't --

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

19

understand your questions.

20

injunction because, at the end of the day, it amounts

21

to nothing.

22

MR. STRIS:

So that's why I don't
I would think you'd say no

See, I don't think that's true,

23

though, because there's a distinction I'd like to draw

24

between having a remedy under 502(a)(3) of ERISA and

25

having a remedy at all.

We would suggest that the plan

7
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

can intervene in the State court suit.

2

suggest that the plan could write a letter to the

3

tortfeasor notifying the tortfeasor that it has a

4

subrogation right, and if the tortfeasor entered into a

5

release, it wouldn't be viable.

6

reason for the Federal court to enter the injunction

7

that you suggested, Mr. Chief Justice, merely to

8

prevent the dissipation of the funds because the funds

9

might need to be preserved for a separate purpose.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

We would

So there may be good

Mr. Stris, I'd -- I'd like

11

to know what -- what you make of our opinion in Barnes

12

v. Alexander.

13

situation similar to this, namely, a contingent fee

14

arrangement with a lawyer, and the client received all

15

the money, without giving the lawyer his contingent

16

fee.

17

contract for a contingent fee out of a fund awarded

18

constituted a lien upon the fund and that, quote, it is

19

one of the familiar rules in equity that a contract to

20

convey a specific object, even before it is acquired,

21

will make the contractor a trustee as soon as he gets

22

title to the thing.

23

resolve the present case?

24
25

It's an old case but it involved a

We reasoned in our opinion that, quote, the

Why doesn't that absolutely

MR. STRIS:

That does not resolve the present

case, Justice Scalia, because the -- MAMSI's

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

interpretation of the Barnes line of cases, the

2

equitable lien by assignment cases, would entirely

3

negate the limitation that Congress put into 502(a)(3).

4

And -- and if you'd permit me to explain why.

5

A remedy of an equitable lien by assignment,

6

as we explained in our opening brief, is not a

7

restitutionary remedy.

8

proved.

9

contractual remedy.

No unjust enrichment need be

No tracing need be proved.

It's purely a

10

Now, as a result, courts of equity

11

historically developed this remedy to give priority to

12

one creditor over another if there was a present intent

13

on the part of the promisor to pledge that specific

14

property as security.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But we -- but, you know, our

16

opinions haven't said only certain kinds of equitable

17

relief, only restitutionary equitable relief.

18

simply said whether equitable relief would normally be

19

available.

20

our cases to say that only certain types of equitable

21

relief are -- are available.

We've

And now you're -- you're trying to rewrite

22

MR. STRIS:

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't -And -- and if, indeed, it

24

does -- it does occupy a lot of the field, so be it.

25

That's the way Congress wrote the statute.

MR. STRIS:

Yes, that's fair, Your Honor, but

2

that's not what I'm saying.

3

the Court's attention to -- to page 211 of the Great-

4

West opinion, note 1, where the Court wrote that any

equitable remedy under 502(a)(3) must -- and I quote --

be deemed to contain the limitations upon its

availability that equity typically imposes.

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I would -- I would direct

And my

Well, what about --

-- my only --- what about if you're --

12

if you're using Great-West, it seemed to me the most

13

relevant point made in Great-West was that the plan

14

could seek restitution in equity where money identified

15

as belonging in good conscience to the plan could

16

clearly be traced to particular funds in -- in the

17

defendant's possession.

18

the money had already been dissipated.

19

aside.

20

MR. STRIS:

The problem in Great-West was
It had been set

That -- that's true, Justice

21

Ginsburg, and -- and it -- it proves my point more than

22

refutes it, and here's why.

23

Court in Great-West had no occasion to explain when

24

something was traceable or when it belonged in good

25

conscience to the plan.

Great-West had no -- this

It merely said that you look

10
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

to history for those requirements.

2

And this is why, Justice Scalia, I

3

distinguish between equitable restitution and an

4

equitable lien by assignment.

5

available in equity as narrow exceptions to getting

6

money for breach of contract.

7

they had very different requirements, neither of which

8

can be met in this case.

JUSTICE BREYER:

They were both typically

I concede that.

But

Suppose in the 18th century

10

-- I'm not an expert in this.

suppose you had an absolute classical trust.

of the Duke of Hamilton.

MR. STRIS:

It depends, and that -- and that

--

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

16

MR. STRIS:

What does it depend on?

-- and that is my answer to

17

Justice Scalia's question.

18

the -- what the court believed the intent of the great

19

grandson was at the time the promise was made.

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

It -- it depends on whether

The great grandson's intent

21

was to get the money as fast as he could, and, in fact,

22

he thinks -- when he'll get the ring, he thinks he'll

23

give it back to the trust but -- at least -- yes.

24

That's what he thinks.

12
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

1

that would not be enforceable as an equitable lien by

There must have been cases

Well, we -- we cite a -- we cite

11

a series of cases in our reply brief, pages 12 and 13,

that all stand for this principle.

to understand why.

14

assignment historically only occurred in cases where

15

there was -- for the most part, 99 percent of the

16

times, occurred in cases where there was insolvency.

17

So the fight was between different creditors.

18

question was, was there an intent to merely just pay

19

this debt as a promise, in which case we don't give

20

priority of -- of the ring to this one creditor, or was

21

there the intent to pledge this particular piece of

22

property as security, in which case we will give it as

23

priority?

24
25

And it's important

The reason why is equitable lien by

And the

And I'd like to take a step back because I'm
concerned that this comes across as a hyper-technical

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

argument, but it's really not because if we start with

there -- there are very few cases in that area because

in that area the person would usually sue at law for

money damages.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Can I get back to the

-- the Barnes case that Justice Scalia asked you about?
Is it a possible distinction of that case that that

4

involved a contingent fee arrangement, and in other

5

words, the lawyer's labors generated the -- the asset,

6

while in this case, the claim depends upon the -- the

7

contractual provision?

8

MR. STRIS:

Certainly, Your Honor, and -- and

9

as we note in our -- in our reply brief, many courts

10

over the years have described Barnes, Wylie, and the

11

other attorney's fees cases cited by MAMSI in this case

12

as -- as very narrow exceptions to the strict rule at

13

equity because in attorney's fees cases, it was the

14

attorney's efforts that created the fund.

15

think we need to rely on that exception.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't

What -- I don't understand

17

what difference that makes.

18

there was a commitment to pay the contingent fee.

19

was a promise. And when the money was collected, the

20

court said, we're going to enforce an equitable lien

21

upon your recovery in order to comply with the promise.

22

MR. STRIS:

I mean, in both cases
It

Well, to be clear, Your Honor, we

23

don't rely on the distinction, but we do think the

24

distinction adds some persuasive force, and here's why.

25

My understanding is that these courts viewed the

15
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Barnes line of cases as a hybrid line of cases.

2

They're willing to relax slightly the very strict rules

3

at equity because they think there's an element of

4

unjust enrichment.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, you may not --

6

you may not rely on the distinction, but I would have

7

thought your answer might have been that the lawyer had

8

an equitable claim apart from the contractual

9

provisions so that when you enforce the contractual

10

provisions, Justice Holmes would have thought of it in

11

equitable terms, while here, there's no equitable claim

12

apart from the particular provisions of the contract.

13

MR. STRIS:

Well, in candor, Your Honor, I

14

was attempting to suggest that and clearly I didn't say

15

it as artfully.

16

meant --

17
18

But that -- that is -- that is what I

JUSTICE SCALIA:
good one.

Take it.

Take it.

It's a

Right.

19

MR. STRIS:

20

(Laughter.)

21

MR. STRIS:

22

And it bleeds very nicely into what I was

-- about the -- the distinction

I will take it.

23

about to say, which is to take a step back as to why

24

this isn't a hyper-technical argument.

25

to start with the background principle that 502(a)(3)

doesn't include legal relief, and this is -- this is

2

significant.

3

narrow provision for plans to enforce terms that

4

require certain employers to make contributions to

5

plans, and in 502(g) Congress said, well, in this case

6

you can seek liquidated damages to enforce the terms of

7

the plan.

8

the phrase, legal and equitable relief.

9

here today and look at 502(a)(3), it's very easy,

If we look at 502(g), there's a very

13

equitable relief.

14

But Congress made the decision only to allow

But why is that?

15

mean, we spend a lot of time with these old English

16

cases.

17

arbitrary line.

18

I

Why -- why did Congress -- it seems an

MR. STRIS:

I don't -- I don't think it is

19

arbitrary, Your Honor, and I would suggest that there's

20

two reasons why did that.

21

The first is that as a backdrop rule they

22

believed that it's not a good policy to have

23

fiduciaries suing participants and beneficiaries for

24

money, and when they thought that there was a good

reason like 502(g), they expressly enumerated it.

The second reason I think that they -- they

2

did this is because the only times when it might make

3

sense to recover money for the violation of a plan

term, for the most part, fall within -- under the

5

rubric of unjust enrichment.

6

Congress, rightfully so, thought that there were non --

7

sufficient non-ERISA remedies whereby a plan could

8

assert truly equitable unjust enrichment claims.

9

there was no need to provide that remedy in the civil

And I believe that

11

So if we look at that as the backdrop rule

12

and apply it to Barnes and that line of cases, I would

13

suggest that MAMSI's reading of the Barnes line of

14

cases is very dangerous.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Do you -- do you not think

16

that Congress had in mind no compensatory damages, no

17

punitive damages?

18

had in mind the distinction that you are now drawing in

19

the ring case based on 15th and 16th century English

20

precedent?

21

Do you really think that Congress

MR. STRIS:

I -- I wasn't suggesting that

22

they had 15th and 16th century cases in mind.

23

Certainly not.

Great-West mandates that that's what we do.

promised that, if it gets a tort recovery, it will

7

It said money, identified as belonging in

MR. STRIS:

Okay.

And why doesn't it belong

Well, that goes to the

8

very heart of why we believe this is a -- a legal claim

9

and not an equitable claim.

If we look at the

10

particular plan provision here, it allows MAMSI to

11

totally avoid proving any double recovery.

12

-- let me give an example, Your Honor.

13

And let me

There are 36 States that have limited the

14

collateral source rule.

15

a particular plaintiff recovered money in a personal

16

injury suit, it clearly could not recover all, in some

17

of the States, part in other States, of its advanced

18

medical expenses because they came from a collateral

19

source.

20

written it, they can recover their full amount, and

21

there's nothing equitable in allowing a boiler plate

22

provision to authorize the plan to get contract

23

damages.

24
25

Under the MAMSI plan here, if

Nonetheless, under the plan, as MAMSI has

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, isn't -- isn't the

simple answer to that is that the equity court would

19
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

not enforce any injunction or any mandatory order, or

2

whatever the relief was, if it involved double

3

recovery?

4

MR. STRIS:

Well, I -- I don't know how

5

simple that answer is, Your Honor, but I would -- I

6

would take it, as Justice Scalia said a moment ago.

7

And if this Court believes that MAMSI could state that

8

sort of equitable claim, we would be very comfortable

9

with a remand in this case to weigh the equitable

10

factors at issue.

11

That didn't occur here, though, because MAMSI

argued that the contractual terms govern.

established double recovery --

And so as a result, the disclaimer of the

MR. STRIS:

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

21
22

The plan has paid

That's correct.
And now it wants to get

back its benefits in full.
MR. STRIS:

Right.

And -- and I would

23

suggest that at equity, whether we look at it

24

historically or even in a modern sense, a subrogation-

25

based claim or an equitable claim would require MAMSI

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

demonstrating that some of the settlement it received

2

constituted a payment for medical expenses.

--

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And that

But the plaintiff could so

5

-- in the tort litigation, if that's what it is, the

6

plaintiff could say, I don't want any medical damages.

7

Give me everything for pain and suffering.

8

MR. STRIS:

That's true, and -- and I would

9

suggest that if that occurred and you applied equitable

10

principles, the insurer could argue, I think rightfully

11

so, that the insurer impaired its subrogation rights.

12

That would be an equitable claim.

13

The point I'm making, Your Honor, is that

14

none of this occurred here because the procedural

15

posture of this case was a motion for summary judgment

16

at the district court level where MAMSI went in and

17

said all that matters are the contract terms.

18

have to look at whether the Sereboffs were made whole.

19

We don't have to look at whether there was double

recovery.

brief, is a doctrine that is governed by equity.

in your argument.

MR. STRIS:

It is an important question, and

8

I would answer it this way.

hypothetical presents a much closer question.

I would say that that
If the

10

contract merely had a subrogation provision that said

11

we are subrogated and the plan went in and tried to

12

enforce that provision by employing equitable

13

principles, seeking equitable remedies, that would be a

14

closer question.

15

502(a)(3).

16

That might be permissible under

That's not what occurred here.
I think it probably wouldn't be permissible

17

because, although it would seek an equitable remedy, it

18

wouldn't be an equitable remedy to --

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

20

occurred here?

21

difference?

22

Why -- why isn't that what

What -- what's the essential

MR. STRIS:

Oh, the essential difference is

23

that there are various equitable principles that were

24

categorically applied to subrogation claims, including

25

reimbursement versions of subrogation claims.

And they

24
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

could not be disclaimed or overridden by contract.

2

burden of the insurer was to establish that there was a

3

double recovery.

4

of the insurer was to show that the defendant, the

5

insured, was made whole.

6

That's part of the claim.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The

The burden

How does the -- how does

7

the insurer show that if the parties could just say --

8

the plaintiff can say, I am the master of my complaint.

9
10
11

I am not seeking damages for medical expenses.

I just

want damages for lost earnings, pain and suffering.
MR. STRIS:

Right, but my answer to that,

12

Your Honor, would be that if it's a lie, meaning if

13

they did get damages for medical expenses, you couldn't

14

overcome it merely by saying you didn't seek them.

15

if it's true, meaning in the -- in the tort action the

16

plaintiff didn't actually seek those damages, then

17

there would be an equitable theory called impairment of

18

a subrogation right that could be asserted.

19

But this is significant.

And

This isn't -- this

20

isn't historical minutia.

21

it goes to the heart of whether the claim is equitable

22

or really just a dressed-up claim to say, hey, you

23

breached this contract provision because when you

24

define in the contract -- and this goes to your

25

jurisdictional question, Justice Souter.

This is significant because

When you

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

define in the contract the very contours of

2

reimbursement, all you're doing is mandating contract

damages.

10

they're not -- they're continuing to rely on their

11

ability to do that in their contract.

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay, but why -- why isn't

13

the answer to your argument the -- the historical

14

answer that courts of equity frequently provided

15

remedies and supplementary remedies when remedies at

16

law were not fully adequate?

17

equitable remedies.

18

equitable, and that's what is being requested here?

They were still typically

19

MR. STRIS:

20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

21
22

And they were still

Well -Why isn't that the answer to

your -- your argument?
MR. STRIS:

I would say two things, and then

23

I would -- if -- if I'm permitted, I would like to

24

reserve the rest of my time.

25

First, I would say that that's not what's

26
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

being requested here, and if MAMSI could state that

2

claim, then a remand is required so they can proceed on

3

that theory.

4

The second thing I would say, though, is that

5

that notion runs square up against Great-West because

6

Great-West said it had to be a claim that was

7

traditionally available in equity, not something that

8

an equity court would have jurisdiction over because of

9

the clean-up doctrine, not something that could come

10

into an equity court for another reason, but a remedy

11

that was traditionally equitable.

12

looking at something like a constructive trust, MAMSI

13

is correct to point out that it doesn't matter if

14

there's an adequate remedy at law.

15

trust historically was an equitable remedy that was

16

available in an equity court even if there was an

17

adequate remedy at law.

18

for MAMSI.

19

requirements, the tracing requirements, which don't

20

exist here in this breach of contract case, and that's

21

why that remedy is not available.

And when you're

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

2
3

MR. COLEMAN:

Good morning, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:

4

Subrogation-based claims have always been

5

fundamentally equitable in nature and fit comfortably

6

within the prescriptive limits of section 502(a)(3).

7

The Court should reject Petitioners' attempt to make

8

these kind of subrogation-based reimbursement

9

provisions universally unenforceable in ERISA plans.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, but I mean, once you

11

get out of the contract terms and are trying to make

12

your case on the basis of subrogation, you do have to

13

show that -- that part of the recovery was -- was for

14

the -- for the medical expenses.

15

shown?

And has that been

16

MR. COLEMAN:

17

And -- and let me make clear what the plan

It has been, Your Honor.

18

says.

19

memorializes our right to subrogation, a -- a right

20

that has existed in equity in modern times and ancient

21

times throughout the history of equity.

22

The plan, I think, does three things.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The plan

Second --

Well, if I can just

23

stop you there.

24

cites the many common law cases not allowing

25

subrogation in this sort of situation, or if it does

MR. COLEMAN:

I don't believe that he does

3

cite cases disallowing it under circumstances anywhere

4

close to this.

5

other cases from his reply brief that this Court in

6

Barnes expressly disapproved.

7

that -- that there is not somehow an equitable right

8

that attaches to this type of a plan language, we think

9

that on that additional ground that fails.

10

He did cite in his brief Trist and

And so in suggesting

This type of a claim is a fundamentally

11

equitable claim.

12

expenses, we obtain a right in equity to receive an

13

amount up to that which we have provided to the

14

Petitioner.

15

also goes on to say that it contains a commitment that

16

we will look only to the recovery, to the fund that is

17

received from a third party by settlement or judgment.

18

When we pay over the medical

Our plan reflects that language.

Our plan

We think that that fits clearly within the language of

19

Barnes, that we are committing ourselves to a recovery

20

that will look only to the fund that is recovered.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

He just said -- your

22

brother said, well -- because I simplified that to the

23

ring, and he says, well, if in fact you had a

24

subrogation right or some other absolutely clear

25

contractual right to get repaid from the ring, you

29
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

know, which is a physical thing, you couldn't --

2

stronger than your case -- you couldn't get it in

3

equity.

4

I would realize that, and it's only my ignorance that

5

and my dissent that prevents me from understanding

6

this.

If I really knew about the 18th century cases,

7

MR. COLEMAN:

I disagree with his response.

8

I think the ring clearly would have been recoverable in

9

equity and I -- I don't think there can be any

10

reasonable question about that.

11
12

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right, fine.

Then where

do I look?

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Can you cite us to

14

something for the -- can you cite something to that

15

effect?

16
17

MR. COLEMAN:

For the -- for the ring

proposition?

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

19

MR. COLEMAN:

For your answer.

I do think the Barnes line of

20

cases that include with it Walker v. Brown and -- and

21

other cases fully stand for that type of a proposition,

22

that -- that if you have committed to something that --

23

that requires the return and recovery of a specific

24

item or fund, that is it.

25

would also fall clearly within the realm of specific

I think that type of thing

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

performance, which is a known exception to contract-

2

based claims that falls clearly within -- within the

3

realm of equity.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, instead of

5

looking for an equitable counterpart, this is an action

6

for money you think is owing to you under a contract.

7

Why isn't that a classic form of legal relief?

8
9

MR. COLEMAN:

Because the right to

subrogation exists independent of the contract.

10

Court has said that numerous times.

11

in our brief going back into the 1800's.

12
13
14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

This

We've cited cases

So why did you cite

the contract in your complaint?
MR. COLEMAN:

Because of the specific

15

requirements of ERISA litigation.

16

say that you can bring any claim in equity.

17

that we can bring a claim seeking appropriate equitable

18

relief to remedy a violation of the plan or to enforce

19

the terms of the plan.

20

of equity and the terms of the plan when you bring --

21

502(a)(3) doesn't
It says

So there is a necessary joining

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If equity -- if the

22

equitable subrogation claim were subject to the make-

23

whole doctrine or -- or these other equitable

24

doctrines, and your contractual claim is not, which

25

relief are you entitled to?

The -- the one subject to

31
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

the equitable doctrines or the relief that's specified

2

in your contract?

3

MR. COLEMAN:

We believe that the courts of

4

appeals have already resolved that question, and that

5

is that -- first of all, there are -- there are

6

variations on make-whole.

7

view of it is only one, which is the -- the most --

8
9
10
11

Theirs is only one.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Their

Is your claim subject

to the equitable doctrines or subject to the legal
contractual claim?
MR. COLEMAN:

I don't distinguish between the

12

two, Your Honor.

13

is that a third part of the plan language is that it

14

contains essentially a pre-agreed allocation.

15

all that it does.

16

manipulation in these settlements where the insured

17

will settle a third party claim and say, okay, it's a

18

million dollars, but let's write $10,000 in for

19

medicals and the rest will be pain and suffering

20

because we don't want to have to pay back on

21

subrogation. So it is well established, both within and

22

outside the ERISA context, in these types of

23

situations, that the subrogation language will contain

24

an allocation so that when you get the money coming

25

back, it is applied first to the medical damages.

And ultimately the reason for it is,

That's

It says because of the risk of

That

something that exists outside.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It is -- it is not

Well, are you -- do you

4

contend it's always applied first to the medical

damages?

6

instead of the $750,000 settlement, it had been

7

$100,000 here.

8

of substantial other claims, pain, suffering, loss of

9

earnings, and so forth.

In other words, supposing there was --

$75,000 was medical, and they had a lot

Would you always get your full

10

amount if -- if the amount of the settlement is over

11

the amount of the medical expense?

MR. COLEMAN:

I think we would be entitled to

JUSTICE STEVENS:

You think that's the

equitable rule.
MR. COLEMAN:

Obviously, in -- in doing these

17

things, there's a practical side on -- on the business

18

side when they work these things out.

19

that claim would settled for $100,000 again speaks to

20

the strength of their claim for other kinds of damages.

MR. COLEMAN:

I think that's an accurate

statement outside of the ERISA context, Justice

17

Stevens, that there are courts that enforce one form of

18

make-whole that might not.

19

that do enforce a --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But there are many States

21

curiosity and -- and didn't satisfy it.

are variations on make-whole.

MR. COLEMAN:

You say there

There are variations that --

the -- the most stringent is Petitioners' rule, which

is we have to be made whole for everything that we

2

wanted to claim, pain and suffering.

3

claim was $1 million and we didn't settle for $1

4

million, and therefore, we're not made whole.

5

We thought our

There is -- there is another version that is

6

less restrictive than that, but as long as there is a

7

showing that medical expenses have been paid, you get a

8

return of medical expenses.

9

There are another version -- there's another

10

version that is enforced in many States, including

11

Virginia and California and I -- some others I believe,

12

in which essentially the make-whole runs the other way

13

towards the insurer, that -- that you have basically a

14

first dollar type to ensure that the medical expenses

15

are paid first.

16

There are -- there are a variety of things,

17

but within the ERISA context, every court of appeals

18

that has addressed this has said that when you put

19

these kinds of terms into the plan -- and they are very

20

common -- we're not going to adopt from various States

21

equitable rules that will contradict the terms of the

22

plan and that will --

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, it seems to

me you -- you must be biting your -- your tongue here.
There's an easy answer to Justice Stevens and to

35
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Justice Scalia, and it's that we get all the money

2

first because that's what the contract says.

3

can't give that answer because then it starts to look

4

like a legal claim. Instead, you get mired in all these

5

obscure equitable doctrines because you're -- when

6

there's a simple answer there in black and white, but

7

it's in the contract.

8

starts to sound legal rather than equitable.

9

MR. COLEMAN:

But you

And as soon as you say that, it

Well, the -- the plan contains

10

an allocation agreement that is part of -- the

11

allocation agreement is enforceable.

12

appeals that has -- has ruled on this issue has said

13

that they are -- that they are not going to adopt State

court rules that contradict plan terms because that

15

would be contrary to the intent of Congress in enacting

16

ERISA and in making plan sponsors the -- the governors

But that -- that --

Every court of

Every court of appeals has ruled that.

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

What do you think --

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The fact that your equitable

22

claim, you know, traces itself to a contract certainly

23

doesn't -- doesn't cause it to cease to be an equitable

24

claim.

25

declaring a trust in exchange for some money, and he

I mean, the classic equitable claim is somebody

36
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

1-800-FOR-DEPO

declares a trust.

2

the trust is based on a contractual commitment.

3
4
5

Equity will enforce that trust, but

MR. COLEMAN:

Right?

I believe -- I believe that is

correct.
We believe that it runs the other way, that

6

our plan language simply reflects an age-old,

7

historical subrogation right that has existed in equity

8

and that has been slightly modified.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

If -- if you understand as I

10

-- that four people on the Court took a broader view

11

that Congress didn't want to get into this matter, and

12

restitution is restitution, whatever it means now; but

13

five took the historical view.

14

historical view, which we are, that was the majority.

15

At that point, I want to know how you think this case

16

should come out.

17

I'm thinking of the next case?

Now, if we're in the

What words should be written there if

every future case that you have, and now the pension

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

you be if -- if an -- if this -- if you prevail in this

case and then every other personal injury lawyer will

7

make sure that that recovery goes into a trust for the

care of the accident victims, never goes into their own

investment account.

MR. COLEMAN:

Your Honor, that presumes that

-- that we don't have things that we can do along the

12

way before it comes into the attorney's hands.

a very interactive process.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

This is

Yes, but Justice Breyer's

15

question is the eggs have gotten scrambled.

16

-- that's the hypothesis.

going to say you can't unscramble the eggs consistently

18

with -- with the limitation to equitable remedies, or

19

are you going to say you can unscramble the eggs?

MR. COLEMAN:

Are you saying or are you

Justice Breyer's example is one

21

specifically related to commingling.

itself does not, in fact, bar --

That's the

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Commingling

1

you know, give out dollar bills on the street till it's

all gone -- we accept that there are limits to our

recovery.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, how about Justice

Breyer's hypothetical?

6

ERISA incapable of dealing with that situation, or is

7

isn't it?

MR. COLEMAN:

Is the -- is the court under

The -- the commingling

situation is one in which the courts would look to see

10

if the person is still essentially in possession of the

11

funds as the Court stated in Great-West.

12

under that circumstance it would be.

13

I can envision circumstances --

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

We think

Under that -- under Justice

15

Breyer's hypothetical, a court, consistently with

16

ERISA, could give an equitable remedy?

17

MR. COLEMAN:

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes, absolutely.
Okay.
But -- but if the recovery

20

is set up in such a way that it never goes into the

21

personal account of the accident victims and, instead,

22

just what happened in Great-West, isn't that what every

23

personal injury lawyer will do if you prevail in this

24

case?

25

MR. COLEMAN:

Then, Justice Ginsburg, we

40
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

would test the language at the end of Great-West and we

2

would have to go after a different defendant.

3

would -- we would have to test our luck under that type

4

of situation, go after the person in possession or

5

control of the funds, and we would be able to do that.

6

And we believe that courts would -- would allow that

7

and would enforce our equitable rights in that type of

8

a situation.

11

I don't mean --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Would California allow you

to intervene when it has a no-subrogation rule?

12

strong argument that California might not have

permitted us to intervene at all.

14

And we

going to prevent the funds from being commingled or

being assigned immediately to a trust?

I think that our -I'm not sure how you

MR. COLEMAN:

You don't need the

We have a right that exists in

equity independent of the plan, but (a)(3) does have

that language that you seek appropriate equitable

relief to enforce the terms of the plan.

it might be missing if we were just out relying solely

on what exists in equity, separate from the plan.

That is why the plan memorializes these

rights.

terms into the plan so that people can be given notice

5

of what is there and they can accept it.

6

understand what is in the plan.

7

plan is consistent with -- and we believe it is -- in

8

seeking what is appropriate equitable relief, then we

9

think that the courts have authority to hear these

10
11

It was Congress' intent that we write the

They can

And as long as our

claims.
And really, there's a lot that's been

12

discussed here, but the question that has been

13

presented to the Court is really only does (a)(3)

14

authorize these types of claim.

15

clearly yes, and in asserting that a court should have

16

enforced or should have looked at various equitable

17

defenses, we think that's merely a concession that our

18

claim is equitable in nature and that in asserting

19

these various defenses, that -- that the courts of

20

appeals have unanimously thus far rejected, the Court

21

does not need to look at it.

22

correctly decided all of those issues in -- in

23

evaluating the -- the balancing of Congress' intent in

24

enacting ERISA and putting these kinds of terms into

25

play, allowing plan sponsors to have a lot of deference

The answer to that is

Those courts have

43
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1

and leeway over how plans are designed and then

2

enforcing them under (a)(3) in seeking equitable

relief.

properly evaluated that and that the court's judgment

should be affirmed.

to your first point, how is this specifically

with in equity.

11

MR. FELDMAN:

I don't think that's correct,

12

with respect.

13

whole line of cases that we cite, the Court has made

14

quite clear that parties can commit contractually that

15

a particular fund that will come into existence in the

16

future should be used for a certain purpose, and that

17

will be equitably enforced.

18

In Barnes against Alexander and in the

20

do that legally not equitably.

21

So we -- how

I mean, if you're enforcing a contract, you

MR. FELDMAN:

I don't think that's right.

22

And if you're enforcing a contract and you're seeking

23

normal contractual damages of various sorts, you

24

definitely do that legally and not equitably.

25

equity always enforced contracts.

But

They would enforce

its equitable liens that were created by contract.

2

For example, in the case of Walker against

3

Brown, which was not an attorney's fees case -- by the

4

way, on -- in Barnes against Alexander, which was an

5

attorney's fees case, nowhere in the decision does the

6

Court rely at all on the fact that this had anything to

7

do with any special rule that applies to attorney's

8

fees.

9

But that, in turn, relied on the prior case

10

of Walker against Brown in which -- just involved an

11

equitable lien that was created by contract and that a

12

party was trying to enforce.

13

Pomeroy's Treatise.

party sufficiently indicates an intention to make some

described.

And the Court quoted

that the terms of the plan, both under ERISA law and

would likely be entitled to get -- get up to the amount

MR. FELDMAN:

It is the case that in extreme

12

cases, for example, the beneficiary has collected the

13

medical benefits, does have some leverage over the

14

plan, and in fact, the plan -- and -- and can say,

15

well, I'm not going to bring the claim, I'm not going

16

to, you know, do what I can to collect the money unless

17

we come to some kind of agreement.

18

plan in this case provides -- that says, the company's

19

share of recovery will not be reduced because your --

20

you have not received the full damages claimed, unless

21

the company agrees in writing to a reduction.

22

leave it open there, in appropriate cases, for

23

the parties to negotiate that.

24
25

Washington, DC 20005

1

out of a contract where that satisfied the -- the

2

standards for an equitable lien.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Are these claims

4

subject to the qualifications that go along with the

5

equitable lien, the make-whole, whatever the applicable

6

rules are?

7

MR. FELDMAN:

Well, first of all, make-whole

8

I think is best -- there are a variety of make-whole

9

rules in addition to those that Mr. Coleman

10

mentioned.

11

settlement in certain ways so that you get some

12

proportion.

13

described by the courts of appeals, is a default rule

14

and that is where you're just relying on a pure

15

subrogation clause or you don't mention it all in a

16

particular insurance document, then some courts have

17

said you apply some kind of make-whole rule or some

18

other allocation rule to figure out how much of the

19

tort recovery goes to the insurer.

20
21
22

There's rules where you prorate the

But the basic make-whole rule, as has been

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So that wouldn't

apply here because you're relying on the contract.
MR. FELDMAN:

Right, where you -- where the

23

parties have specified.

24

law generally, where the parties have specified in the

25

insurance contract how that's supposed to work, then

11

negligence.

12

there would still be no prorating --

13

But there was some contributory

So I think $80,000 would be right.

MR. FELDMAN:

So

I think, first of all, the --

14

the question presented in this case is whether there's

15

a cause of action.

16

to the amount of money that gets recovered in the cause

17

of action, and actually the -- the question presented

18

in the petition doesn't squarely present that.

19

Those -- that question really goes

But insofar as where you're going on to that

20

further -- because this case can be just answered by

21

saying, yes, there's a cause of action under 502(a)(3).

22

Now, insofar as the Court goes further into the make-

23

whole doctrine, I think generally courts should --

24

courts have recognized that under ERISA what they're

25

supposed to do is enforce the terms of the plan.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So what if the plan

2

said -- you know, this is an insurance company.

3

don't like litigation -- we are subrogated to double

4

whatever the medical expenses are that we contributed?

5

That's our recovery.

They

It's an equitable claim, but

6

it's going to be enforced according to the terms of the

7

plan.

8
9

MR. FELDMAN:

The Court has recognized that

-- that Federal courts, especially in an unusual

10

circumstance like that -- but Federal courts do have

11

the obligation under ERISA to determine a common law of

12

rights and obligations under ERISA plans.

13

are doctrines like unconscionability and other

14

doctrines that may be applied in particular cases where

15

some plan is just taking advantage of another party,

16

where --

17
18
19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And there

But you would still

call that an equitable claim?
MR. FELDMAN:

Yes.

It would still be an

20

equitable claim because the question still is are you

21

There were two other grounds that the Court

whether there's an equitable lien is determined by what

the contract says.

13

As far as the make-whole doctrine, another

14

point about the make-whole doctrine that's worth

15

keeping in mind is that insofar as some States have

16

applied it, as a matter of their insurance law and have

17

said, well, an insurance company is not allowed under

18

our State's law to contract out of the make-whole

19

doctrine which we -- under our State's law is the

20

default rule.

21

would apply equally to ERISA plans under the insurance

22

savings clause and there wouldn't be any question I

23

think that it would.

for determining what equitable remedy would be

MR. FELDMAN:

That's right.

And if the

5

insurance contract departed from what the State's law

6

was, the State's law would govern it under ERISA's

7

insurance savings clause.

But where you have an -- and so the -- the
case with ERISA plans is not really any different than

10

it is outside ERISA.

11

insurance law decides to establish a make-whole

12

doctrine or an allocation rule of some sort or a

default rule, it can do that, and that can be applied

to insured ERISA plans.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PETER K. STRIS

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

19

MR. STRIS:

20

In my limited time, I'd like to make three

21

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

very brief points.
The first point I'd like to make is why these

23

claims are never permissible under 502(a)(3).

24

think it comes out of a -- a concession that Mr.

25

Coleman made in his argument.

And I

He answered your

question, Mr. Chief Justice -- and he said that they

2

would have had this equitable right without any plan

3

provision.

4

because that's what section 502(a)(3) requires.

5

can only get equitable relief to remedy the violation

6

of a plan.

authorized under 502(a)(3) because they're not really

term.

But, hey, they put the plan provision in
You

That's why these claims are never

More importantly, though, that's not what

10

happened here because in this contract they disclaimed

11

the very equitable principles.

12

And that brings me to my second point, which

13

is that even if the answer to the question we presented

14

in our cert petition is sometimes, the question is

15

still presented.

16

that, as you put it, Justice Souter, jurisdictionally

17

sometimes these claims for reimbursement are

18

authorized, and the sometimes is when the contract

19

doesn't disclaim equitable principles because if the

20

party relies on the contract and fails to establish the

21

equitable principles that make the remedy equitable,

22

then it's nothing more than a breach of contract

23

damages case.

24
25

The answer to the question could be

And Mr. Coleman's answer was very
interesting.

He tried to -- to sort of squirm out of

this was a pre-allocation of how the money would be

awful like a liquidated damages provision for a breach

of contract.

liquidated damages provision, but this Court has

squarely held that that's legal relief when it's for a

breach of contract.
