ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

MR. ENGLERT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

10

Sixty-six years elapsed between the passage of the

11

Robinson-Patman Act and the judgment of the District Court in

12

this case.

13

finding of a violation by a seller operating in an industry like

14

this one in which a sale is made to the plaintiff distributor

15

if, and only if, it has already secured a contract for resale to

16

a particular end user.

17

offers at different prices cannot violate the Act, because it

18

requires two purchases, and that successful purchases in

19

winner-take-all bidding cannot have the requisite effect on

20

competition.

22

never been applied before.

In that time, there is no reported instance of a

MR. ENGLERT:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Very much the opposite, Your Honor.
Well, you have a person

who's engaged in commerce, who's discriminating in the price

that they offer to different purchasers.

argument about the structure, but the actual language does seem

7

to encompass the activity.

MR. ENGLERT:
Your Honor.

Now, I know your

With respect to mere offers, offering a price to

10

different purchasers is not covered by the statutory language.

11

With respect to the sales-to-sales comparisons, there is not the

12

requisite effect of such discrimination

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

14

MR. ENGLERT:

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

--

Well, just to --

-- on competition.
-- get to your first point,

16

the statute talks about discrimination in price between

17

different purchasers, and not different actual purchases.

18

MR. ENGLERT:

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But this -It doesn't seem it's that

20

much of a stretch to cover would-be purchasers, potential

21

purchasers.

22

MR. ENGLERT:

Well, except that, back in 1947, this

23

Court, in the Bruce's Juices case, made clear, in the early days

24

of the Act, that it takes two completed sales to violate the

25

Act.

No one sale can violate the Act.

Even earlier than that,

rule, and it's been an accepted rule of Robinson-Patman Act

3

jurisprudence for that entire time.

4

of the statute, and in accordance with the general principle,

5

that this statute should be construed consistently with the

6

larger body of antitrust law.

7

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And it is a natural reading

But may I not ask, Isn't it true

8

that each of the parties here, over a long period of time, was a

9

purchaser?

10

I mean, the -- Reeder was a purchaser, was he not?

They were a dealer.

11

MR. ENGLERT:

Yes.
So, they were a purchaser.

Over a --

Yes.

the effect of "such discrimination" must be to harm competition

2

in one of these justified instances.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And the discrimination occurred

over a period of a couple of years, as I understand it.

5

MR. ENGLERT:

No, Your Honor.

This case was tried

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

MR. ENGLERT:

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Englert --

-- why the Robinson-Patman Act --- suppose you had a case of

10

two Volvo dealers, and the scheme is, as this one, specially

11

ordered goods with competitive bidding, but, over a substantial

12

period of time, one dealer -- we'll call that dealer the

13

"favored dealer" -- consistently gets higher concessions, and

14

the other dealer, who ends up being the plaintiff in the case,

15

consistently, in that same period, gets lower concessions.

16

we don't have a picture of what you call "mix and match," but

17

two dealers, one consistently getting higher concessions, and

18

one consistently getting lower, and, therefore, missing out on

19

sales or making sales at a very low profit.

20

out of Robinson-Patman, if I understand your view of the

21

statute.

22

MR. ENGLERT:

So,

That, too, would be

It -- yes, I think that's correct.

23

That's a closer case to what's the -- what the statute was

designed to cover than this case, but, yes, that, too, would be

out of Robinson-Patman.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Englert, I thought you were

Well --

22

relying on the succeeding phrase, where "either or any of the

23

purchases involved in such discrimination are in commerce,"

24

which seems to require that -- "to discriminate in price between

25

different purchasers where either or any of the purchases

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

2

were hanging your hat on, to say that there has to be a

3

discrimination in particular sales.

MR. ENGLERT:

5

compels that conclusion.

6

there is enough ambiguity to admit of a different conclusion,

7

then the principle comes into play that cases of ambiguity in

But how can you say --

goods for resale in competition with other Volvo dealers?
That's exactly what they do every day, isn't it?
MR. HUNGAR:

No, Your Honor.

When they purchase the

12

goods, they are not in competition with any other Volvo dealer.

13

By definition, they have the sale.

MR. HUNGAR:

No, Your Honor.

the point that the price discrimination occurs, they are not.

And, therefore, even in the -- in the -- in the -- well, in any

of the examples offered by the Respondents in this case, they

don't show price discrimination between competing purchasers,

cases, have indicated the Act was aimed at.

16

indicated, that is why, in the 70 years since the

that circumstance.

first one is whether or not there is competition in this

posed the issue about as starkly as it can be:

was, if you had two dealers competing for the same sale, they

question is, Do Volvo dealers compete against other Volvo

two cars from two different purchasers in the -- in the classic

inventory situation.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, but it's very hard to compare

20

those two sales, because they all depend upon the special

21

features on the trucks that are ordered by the particular

individual, and also how -- you know, how much of a hard bargain

"Remember, it has to be like kind and quality.

discount on and the truck that they're getting a 20 percent

Justice Scalia, that was precisely

I'd commend the record to you if you want to read it -- but he

10

meticulously examined each of those trucks and showed that,

11

systematically, for 102 sales, they sold the exact same truck to

12

a dealer down the road, with a significantly better price than

13

the truck they sold to us, in order to implement the "Volvo

14

Vision" and drive my client --

18

may have been in a better position with regard to the

19

negotiation than any of your customers were.

20

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, he -- but whatever that

21

person's position was, vis-a-vis its customer, doesn't affect

22

the relationship between Reeder-Simco and Volvo, and that

individual and Volvo.

-- why is it -That is precisely what

JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- why is it unreasonable -- why

6

does it violate the principle of Robinson-Patman, and why does

7

it destroy competition, for Volvo to say, "We'll make whatever

8

discount it takes to get the sale, and if this dealer needs a 20

9

percent discount for this sale, but this other fellow over here

10

only needs a 10 percent discount to make that sale, we're going

11

to have a differential discount"?

12

harms competition.

13

MR. PHILLIPS:

Why -- I don't see why that

Because the -- it wouldn't

14

necessarily, on an episodic basis.

15

case is substantial price discrimination across time, which this

16

Court held, under Morton Salt, triggers an inference of

17

competitive injury.

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But what you have in this

Mr. Phillips, the problem that I

19

have with even accepting your theory is what the other side

20

calls the "mix and match" quality of your evidence.

21

you say here's Reeder, disfavored, and here's someone else,

22

favored.

23

for all we know, someone else could make a case saying, "We

24

compare ourselves with Reeder, and we say, oh, there was that

25

sale 7 months ago, where they got a whopping discount and we got

That is,

But it's not consistently the same someone else.

4

we don't --

5

You're not -- you don't have the same

You're picking from a series of sales, and we

MR. PHILLIPS:

And we I mean - and

Well, I mean, putting aside the fact,

6

Your Honor, that I think that that's essentially a jury question

7

-- I mean, I do think both sides get to put on the evidence that

8

shows that there's been discrimination and that there -- and

9

then we know what the market consequences will be.

But if you

10

look at plaintiff's exhibit 104, which is in the appendix to the

11

Court of Appeals at 577, and you look down that list, you will

12

see that they are -- where they're specifically talking about

13

Reeder-Simco, and it has -- and it satisfies its 28 percent of

14

its overall objective in 1999; and then you go through the

15

testimony of Reeder-Simco's co-owner, and he's -- identifies

16

each of the four or five competing entities that were the

17

beneficiaries of those -- of the price discrimination of those

18

sales in the 102 sales that were the basis for liability; and

19

their percentages for the objectives during the next -- during

20

1999 are 71 percent, 81 percent, 97 percent, 107 percent, 92

21

percent

It's not because they gave another Volvo dealer a bigger

be sure.

because I didn't have enough capital to have the same quality of

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

10

may not be terribly concerned about whether you, as a reseller,

11

are making enough profit to last 3 years or 5 years.

12

MR. PHILLIPS:

That's true.

But we know from the

record that Volvo's purpose in this enterprise was to eliminate

50 percent of its dealers --

seller such as Volvo has to make sure that each of its

distributors makes the same profit?

way that one of them is making less profit than another, it's

2

liable?

3

MR. PHILLIPS:

No, there are -- there are two

4

elements to this, Justice Scalia.

5

that there's discrimination.

6

anticompetitive discrimination is to show that there is a

7

consistent pattern.

8

over a substantial period of time.

9

You first have to demonstrate

And the way you demonstrate

It has to be substantial discrimination

If we're trying to cut deals on a daily basis,

10

presumably today you got a deal with a customer, and I'll give

11

you a 10 percent, and then the Chief Justice got a deal

12

tomorrow, and I may give him 12 percent, but, 2 weeks down the

13

line, the situations will likely be flipped out.

14

going to find, where you have 55 percent of your sales, 102

15

sales involving $250,000-plus of sales differentials to be the

16

basis for the claim that there is price discrimination in the

17

first instance, Justice Scalia.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You're not

Do you have any instance where you

19

made an offer to a buyer assuming that you'd get the kind of a

20

break that Volvo gives to other dealers -- all right? -- you

21

made that offer, and the buyer says, "Yes, I'll take it at that

price" -- and then you go to Volvo, and they won't give you that?

JUSTICE BREYER:

But we don't have

If it's not, the -- the reason -- I

thought, for about 60 years, the words "different purchasers of

39
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

commodities," it forbids any person to discriminate in price

2

between different purchasers of commodities.

3

refer -- as soon as I ask the question, or start getting into

4

the language, I forget the statute, and it's so complicated that

5

I'm giving you time to think about it --

6

[Laughter.]

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

8

Now, you have to

-- and to think of those words in

your mind.

9

MR. PHILLIPS:

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.
It's a -- it's forbidden to

11

discriminate in price between different purchasers of

12

commodities.

13

MR. PHILLIPS:

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

Right.
Now, I had always thought -- and I

15

think the Courts' decisions bear that out, or the absence of

16

decisions -- that the words "discriminate in price between

17

different purchasers of commodities" meant you can't

18

discriminate in price between different purchasers of the item,

19

or items, in respect to which the discrimination of price

20

exists.

21

that was the general understanding in the antitrust bar, that

22

was the general understanding of the courts.

23

not permissible to give such an interpretation -- I don't know

24

why it wouldn't be; it's literal -- or there's a good policy

25

reason for not doing it in respect to the policy.

That's what I thought it meant.

And it seems to me

And either it's

40
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

And in respect to the policy, what worries me about

2

the broader interpretation is suddenly doing what Volvo --

3

forbidding Volvo from doing what it probably wants to do here.

4

If it wants to get rid of its dealers, it's because it wants to

5

compete better with other brands.

6

for consumers, though individual dealers might be hurt.

7

And that means lower prices

So, if I'm trying to read that law consistent with

8

60 years of history, and the basic purposes of the antitrust

9

law, I guess I would -- might favor your opponents in this.

I'm

10

exposing my entire line of thought.

11

interbrand competition, why -- while, at the same time, not

12

being -- not being unfair to the purposes of Robinson-Patman;

13

and, therefore, I'm reading this fairly literally, as it's been

14

read.

I'm trying to protect

So, what's your response?

15

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I guess the difficulty I have,

16

Justice Breyer, is understanding why you don't think we are --

17

what we have here is precisely different purchasers of

18

commodities.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, I said -- I said they -- in --

20

the problem for you is that, in respect to discrimination

21

between the item, or items, the -- in respect to -- the purchase

22

of the item, or items, in respect to which the discrimination

23

existed.

24

there is no discrimination.

25

that -- in terms of the injury of the statute, creates that kind

was no purchase of the item, or items, from the manufacturer in

Yes.
That's fine.

As long as you accept

11

that the first class is a distinct one, and, as far as I'm

12

concerned --

JUSTICE BREYER:

case, as far as I'm concerned.

[Laughter.]

21

MR. PHILLIPS:

-- we'll start there.

But I just

22

want to be clear that that's a completely separate analysis.

23

Then, it seems to me, what you -- what you have to go back to is

24

the kind of analysis that Justice Stevens was saying, which is

25

that when you're talking about different purchasers of

43
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

commodities, there is no reason to be so focused on the -- on

2

the identical transaction, rather than recognizing, particularly

3

in the context of a dealership arrangement where you're -- have

4

continuous relationships between the -- between the seller --

5

the manufacturer and the dealer, where you have this enormous

6

disadvantage to the dealer, who has already sunk, you know, huge

7

amounts of money into this and is in -- essentially at the whim

8

of what is now a monopoly seller

9

seller.

-- a monopsony -- a monopoly

And, under those circumstances, it makes perfect sense

10

to say, "Look, if I'm going to systematically keep getting 20 --

11

10 percent discounts, where my competitor, a hundred miles away,

12

is always getting 20 percent discounts," that's a situation that

13

this statute seems clearly aimed at dealing with.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

monopoly seller.

16

you've got a contract with them.

whatever you want about pricing.

You're not at the whim of a

4

-- I didn't write that contract,

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But on a misinterpretation of

Robinson-Patman.

5

[Laughter.]

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What do you do with the

7

policy argument -- at, sort of, the level of the forest, rather

8

than the trees -- that the antitrust laws are designed to prefer

9

competition in interbrand -- in the interbrand market, rather

10

than intrabrand, and that, therefore, to the extent there's

11

ambiguity, that supports an interpretation that allows the

12

manufacturer to strengthen his interbrand position, as opposed

13

to protect the intrabrand position?

14

MR. PHILLIPS:

I think to make that argument you

15

essentially have to make mush out of the last half of the

16

Robinson-Patman Act, because it's not injury in any line of

17

commerce, which is where I think you would be talking about

18

interbrand problems.

19

either of them.

20

1948 in Justice Black's opinion for the Court in Morton Salt,

21

that this is designed to recognize that when you harm an

22

intrabrand competitor, that that's the kind of injury to

23

competition that this statute was aimed at.

24

reaffirmed that both in the 1980s, reaffirmed it again in 1990,

25

in Texaco.

the Court to revisit Morton Salt at this point, it seems to me

2

that that principle ought to be completely settled at this

3

stage.

4

that's offered up by Congress.

If there's to be any fix there, it ought to be a fix

5

To go back to, then, your point, Justice Scalia, I

6

told you, first, you have this discrimination in price, you have

7

to show that it's substantial, lasts for a substantial period of

8

time, you get the Morton Salt inference.

Your argument that focuses

on the dealer's profits, I guess, doesn't depend upon you losing

have the same argument, right?

else was getting a bigger discount -- if you had gotten the

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I think, at the end of the day,

what we're talking about is essentially a jury question:

JUSTICE BREYER:

I hope not.
If you want to go look at this, you

We're going to be realistic.

2

but the profit was lower.

3

MR. PHILLIPS:

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

There's no purchaser problem.
Right.
But they got a lower profit.

And I

5

think, there, the mine-run of cases is against you that that

counts as an injury.

MR. PHILLIPS:

That, by itself, wouldn't count as an

injury.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.

Yes, but it's -- you know, it

10

shows that they're going to be hurt, that they may be driven out

11

of business.

12

MR. PHILLIPS:

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

Right.
Indeed, the market in -- the

14

dealership market, whatever -- if that's a separate market,

15

which it might be -- becomes more concentrated, and the result

of -- you know, I could make a -- tell a little story there that

2

And, court, look to see whether competition, in the sense of

will lead to higher prices with the ordinary antitrust proxies

What about that?

MR. PHILLIPS:

Forget the presumptions.

I mean, I don't know if you -- you

Well, I'm not here to --- I'm being a little --- I'm not here, necessarily, as an

10

advocate for overturning Morton Salt, for obvious reasons.

11

think the answer to your question is, under Morton Salt we

12

clearly win, because we -- we probably didn't need to show as

13

much as we did, in terms of the impact of this particular

14

discrimination on our ability to compete in the future.

15

we were entitled to a straight inference of that, in terms of

16

the substantial -- or reasonable possibility of injury in the

17

first instance.

certainly hold, in this case, that Reeder-Simco has made more

19

than enough of a case in order to recover under the

you almost concede that, right?

MR. PHILLIPS:

7

it.

8

that head-to-head item wasn't part of the jury instruction.

9

that -- we -- I can't rely on it, in terms of supporting it.

And part of this -- part of the problem is that it's not -So,
If

So, just to point to Reeder's

There's one 77-truck transaction to New Hi-Way before it was

They are all cases in which all Reeder did
