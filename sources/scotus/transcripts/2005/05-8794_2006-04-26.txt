We'll hear argument

Mr. Doss.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF D. TODD DOSS

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. DOSS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

In Nelson v. Campbell, this Court held that a

11

challenge to procedures to execute an inmate may be

12

brought in a section 1983 action unless the challenge

13

would necessarily prevent the State from carrying out

14

its execution.

15

right to execute him by lethal injection, but instead,

16

only challenges the particular protocol Florida

17

Department of Corrections in their discretion has

18

adopted.

19

prevent his execution, and his claim falls squarely

20

within the scope of Nelson, as announced by this Court.

21

Mr. Hill does not challenge the State's

Mr. Hill's claim, thus, does not necessarily

The current claim -- the only focus of that

22

claim is the discretionary choice of the particular

23

injection procedure that has been chosen by the Florida

24

Department of Corrections.

25

violate Nelson because the relief sought would not

Therefore, it does not

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

necessarily prevent the State of Florida from carrying

2

out its execution.

3

execution through a more humane means by altering the

4

particular protocol that -- that they have adopted.

JUSTICE SCALIA:
specify.

7
8

The State could still carry out the

Which you decline to

Right?
MR. DOSS:

I'm sorry, Justice.

I didn't hear

the first part of your question.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

By a means which you decline

10

to specify, so that if they come up with some other

11

means, you could -- you could object to that as well I

12

assume.

13

MR. DOSS:

Well, there -- in -- in answer to

14

your question, there's never been a -- a requirement

15

that a section 1983 plaintiff must plead a

16

constitutionally acceptable alternative.

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, I understand that.

But

18

I'm just -- I'm just pointing out what -- what becomes

19

available to you if we -- if we give you the relief you

20

request.

21

MR. DOSS:

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, this -You -- we -- we say this --

23

this procedure is no good.

24

another procedure, and you challenge that one.

25

The State comes up with
Right?

And -- and another few years go by.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. DOSS:

I -- I respectfully disagree with

2

the fact that it would just leave open a total series

3

of challenges.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

5

MR. DOSS:

Why?

The State -- the State would have

6

the opportunity to come in and propose a acceptable

7

alternative.

8

unconstitutionality, once they propose that

9

alternative, we can challenge that if something is --

Just like any other finding of

10

is not acceptable, or accept the -- the proposed

11

alternative and the court enters a -- a consent decree.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You -- you think that the --

13

the way you would proceed in trial court is the trial

14

court finds that this is no good, and -- and then the

15

trial court proposes an alternative, or -- or invites

16

the State to propose to the trial court an alternative,

17

and then asks whether you agree to that alternative.

18

And if you don't, the trial court makes the decision

19

whether the alternative is -- is constitutional or not.

20

MR. DOSS:

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

22

MR. DOSS:

This -- that's -That's not bad.

-- that's entirely correct, and I

23

think we've seen that in -- in a couple of the cases

24

that are out there.

25

Carolina followed that track.

Mr. Brown's case out of North
Mr. Morales' case

5
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

somewhat followed that track, although through no fault

2

of Mr. Morales, California wasn't able to carry through

3

on the alternative that they chose because the

4

anesthesiologists decided to not participate.

5

-- but it just proceeded to basically an up or down

6

ruling upon the proposed alternatives.

7

disagree that there's a seriatim effect of -- of just

8

perpetual litigation over whether the alternatives --

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But it

So I -- I would

You're envisioning that

10

one case will take care of it.

11

rules against you, that's the end of it.

12

come back with another inadequacy because you'd be

13

barred by claim preclusion.

14

That is, if the Court
You can't

On the other hand, if the State comes up with

15

an acceptable alternative, you agree to it.

16

thing.

17

second episode I think.

18

proceeding would end it.

19

That's one

The Court holds -- but there wouldn't be a

MR. DOSS:

One way or another this

The only -- the only way I would

20

foresee a second episode is if they -- if they proposed

21

a second unconstitutional procedure.

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, that probably

23

will be what will be alleged.

24

know when -- at this proceeding, we have no idea, if we

25

rule in your favor, what alternative the State is going

Of course, you don't

6
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

to provide, and I am willing to bet whatever that

2

alternative is that it will be subject to a challenge

3

under a new 1983 suit. There would be no claim

4

preclusion if you didn't know what the alternative was

5

at this point.

6

Right?

MR. DOSS:

That's correct, although it would

7

proceed to basically an up or down ruling, just as it

8

did in -- in the Brown case and the -- the Morales

9

case.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

In this very case, you're

11

saying the court would -- would rule on the State's

12

proposed alternative.

Right?

13

MR. DOSS:

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

that, you could appeal it up again.

16

to the court of appeals --

That's correct.

17

MR. DOSS:

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

19

here.

But if you disagreed with
Right?

You can go

That's correct.
-- and then seek cert up

Right?

20

MR. DOSS:

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

That -- that would be correct.
May -- just as a -- maybe

22

this is technical, but what did you ask for for relief?

23

Did you ask for relief that the State be enjoined from

24

using this method, or that the State be enjoined from

25

executing him until an acceptable method had been

found?

2

theoretically is open to seriatim 1983 actions, and in

3

the second case, presumably the issue would be resolved

4

in this one case, as you suggest.

5

for?

6

acceptable alternative came up?

Because in the first case, the door

So which did you ask

Injunction against this or injunction until an

7

MR. DOSS:

We asked for -- for two -- two

8

injunctions:

9

-- the Court to be able to consider the case, and then

one a preliminary injunction allowing the

10

the way the prayer for relief was worded is, is that we

11

asked for a permanent injunction barring the State of

12

Florida from executing Mr. Hill as they currently

13

intend.

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, if that's -- if that's

15

the relief you get, then the door would be open to

16

successive different 1983 actions every time the State

17

comes up with -- with a new protocol.

18

the -- if -- if the trial court -- if you succeed at

19

this stage, if we say, yes, you're -- you're properly

20

in court and you go ahead and litigate it, if the trial

21

court, in fact, awards not the injunction that you

22

asked for but the injunction saying do not execute this

23

person until a constitutional protocol has been

24

proposed and accepted by the court, then everything

25

will get resolved in this one action, as you suggest.

Whereas, if what

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

So would -- would you consent to -- as it

2

were, to an amendment of your prayer for relief so that

3

the injunction will be in such a form that everything

4

can get resolved in this one case?

5

MR. DOSS:

In -- in the sense of -- of the

6

State of Florida proposing a -- a -- hopefully a

7

constitutional way of executing --

8

JUSTICE SOUTER:

MR. DOSS:

-- Mr. Hill, where it wouldn't

give rise to another 1983 action?

Yes.

that?

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, do you have

You said --- do you have confidence

that Florida can do that?
MR. DOSS:

Based upon the litigation that

22

we've seen around the country, yes, I think there are

23

acceptable ways to -- to do it out there.

24

would choose that way or not, I don't know because the

25

way Florida's system is designed is -- is that it's not

questioning is this.

available.

16

State resolves it once and for all, I suppose the State

17

couldn't adopt a new protocol that it thought was

18

better, more humane, without risking more litigation.

19

So it -- it really is a disincentive for the States to

20

try to make the procedure less painful for the -- for

21

the accused.

22

States generally have the defense

What

10

was the experience -- you mentioned a couple of other

11

cases where the particular combination of drugs was

12

successfully challenged, but then the State did what?

13

MR. DOSS:

In Mr. Brown's case in North

14

Carolina, my understanding was -- is that the State had

15

went and purchased a device to make sure that he was

16

actually unconscious during the procedure and wasn't

17

subject to the excruciating pain that's been detailed

18

within -- within the briefs.

19

challenged because Mr. Brown's attorneys didn't think

20

that the -- the people that were monitoring the machine

21

were properly trained.

22

and as we know, Mr. Brown was -- was executed.

23

didn't result in the series of challenges as -- as many

24

are obviously concerned about.

25

That actually was

The court ruled against them,

JUSTICE ALITO:

It

Do you agree that that was

11
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

not a -- that method of execution is not a violation of

2

the Eighth Amendment?

3
4

MR. DOSS:

As far as using the machinery that

was used in Brown?

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

6

MR. DOSS:

Yes.

I -- I don't know enough about --

7

about that machine to -- to accurately comment on -- on

8

that.

9

Brown wasn't necessarily regarding the machine itself,

I know that the challenges that were brought in

10

but it was the qualifications of -- of the people

11

monitoring the machine and whether they had the

12

authority and ability to intervene in the execution

13

itself.

14

was ruled upon by the court in Mr. Brown's case before

15

he was executed.

16

And I believe that that was the challenge that

JUSTICE ALITO:

Do you know of any method

17

that has been used -- used throughout the country that

18

is not a violation of the Eighth Amendment?

19

MR. DOSS:

As far as -- as far as this

20

particular protocol, this particular protocol that's --

21

that's utilized and that we're -- we're challenging is

22

unconstitutional because of the excruciating pain.

23

the -- if the sedative works, and there's no -- and --

24

and the person is not in -- not in wanton and

25

gratuitous type of -- of pain, as -- as this Court's

If

12
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

precedents hold, that would be constitutional.

2

the -- it's the evidence that's coming forward that

3

this is not what's happening that gives rise to our

4

claim that -- that we would like to be able to litigate

5

in a 1983 action so that we can get those facts before

6

the court.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's

Is it only excruciating pain

8

that the Eighth Amendment prohibits or is it any pain?

9

Does the Eighth Amendment require painless execution?

10

MR. DOSS:

No, absolutely not.

It's -- it's

11

that it's -- it's that it's wanton and -- and

12

gratuitous pain.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, when you say wanton

14

and gratuitous, you're -- you're saying any pain that

15

can be eliminated must be eliminated.

16

gratuitous I assume.

17
18

MR. DOSS:

Otherwise, it's

It's -- it's gratuitous when it's

beyond what's -- what's necessary, and whenever the --

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes.

So if there's any way

20

of -- of execution that is totally painless, that --

21

that must be pursued.

22
23

MR. DOSS:

-- I would agree with that.

24
25

If there were a way to do that, I

that from?

Where -- where do you derive

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

certainly never the principle evident in -- in

2

executions in the past.

3

you know, a quick and easy way to go.

4

thought they would have required a firing squad instead

5

or something like that.

6

you're deriving this principle that there cannot be any

7

pain associated with the execution.

Hanging was -- was not a -You would have

I -- I just don't know where

8

MR. DOSS:

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I -I can understand

10

excruciating pain, but -- but you -- you want to press

11

it to the point where there can't be any pain

12

associated.

Any pain that can be eliminated must be

13

eliminated.

That seems to me a very extreme

14

proposition.

15

MR. DOSS:

The -- the -- what -- what we've

16

detailed here in our complaint is an extreme and

17

tortuous method of -- of death.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No.

At this point -I understand what

19

you're challenging here.

20

would be acceptable to you?

21

-- that, to the maximum extent possible, eliminates all

22

pain.

23

But what -- what alternative
Only one -- only one that

Isn't that right?
MR. DOSS:

Well, when you look at the -- when

24

you look at -- at Morales and Brown, both of those that

25

-- that were proposed were eliminating -- for instance,

14
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

one of the options within Mr. Morales' case was that

2

only the sodium thiopental be used eliminating the

3

pancuronium bromide and the potassium chloride.

4

State of California, for -- for whatever reason, did

5

not -- did not choose that and went, instead, and tried

6

to use the same protocol and bringing in

7

anesthesiologists that were properly trained and

8

qualified to determine whether or not Mr. Morales was,

9

in fact, anesthetized to -- to a degree where he would

14

that for -- there's -- there's never been a requirement

15

for -- for us to plead this.

16

this Court's case law within -- for example, Lewis v.

17

Casey shows the -- the strong deference that this Court

18

gives to States in -- in coming up with the prison

19

procedures.

20

Florida courts -- not Florida courts, but the Florida

21

officials within the Department of Correction -- they

know their facilities.

1

execution in the sentence, then you would not have a

2

1983 action.

3

be challenging the sentence, and it would have to be

4

brought under habeas.

5

Is that correct?

MR. DOSS:

Because you would then

If the particular protocol that was

6

alleged in the sentence, yes, it would be ripe at that

7

point in time as opposed to Florida's system where it's

8

within -- it's within the discretion of the Department

9

of Correction to change it at any time.

We've seen

10

that happen whenever the electric chair litigation was

11

going on, that they changed these procedures over time,

12

adding and detracting different things.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, but -- but you -- you

14

-- their procedure was set forth in a -- in a notice, a

15

regulation or something.

16

procedure they intended to use several years ago,

17

didn't you?

18

MR. DOSS:

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You -- you had notice of what

The only -Now, you're saying they

20

could change it in the future, but sure, of course.

21

Any -- any agency can change its -- its regulations.

But didn't you know that this is the procedure they

23

intended to use several years ago?

24

MR. DOSS:

No, Your Honor.

It was -- what

they relied upon was what was -- what was detailed in

discretion that Florida Department of Corrections has

3

and that they've exhibited in the past, that they've

4

utilized that discretion whenever we were having the

5

electric chair litigation going on, we can't presume

6

that.

But with the -- with the

7

The added problem is --

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

So you have to wait to --

you have to wait to the eve of execution before --

10

before you think you have a -- a ripe claim under --

MR. DOSS:

13

yes, we have to wait because they have the complete

In fact, we've been denied throughout.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Congress has the complete

discretion to change the statutes it's enacted, but

18

that doesn't mean that you can't change -- you can't

19

challenge a statute now because it might be changed

You can challenge it now.

That was essentially done at the

public records hearing on December 19th whenever they

came in and said it was -- that it was Sims.

MR. DOSS:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Okay.

The -- the thing is, is -Well, you -- you

10

alleged in your complaint -- I'm looking at footnote 3

11

-- that you assumed they were going to follow the same

12

protocol as in Sims.

13

MR. DOSS:

Because of their -- because of --

14

of the representations that were made during the public

15

records litigation.

16

what we based our assumption on, knowing that they

17

still had the ability to change it all the way up until

18

the date that Mr. Hill was scheduled to be executed.

19

That was based upon -- that was

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, they still do, but

20

you're here.

21

opportunity to change it, but you're here challenging

22

it even though it is still changeable.

23

I mean, they -- they still have the

MR. DOSS:

They -- yes.

Right?

Because of the way

24

Florida operates with the total discretion and -- and

25

the refusal to give any public records regarding this,

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1

yes, we are in the dark regarding it.

2

they could alleviate that situation by doing an

3

administrative rulemaking process, that that rule is

4

then in place, and with that rule in place, it would be

5

ripe at that point because at that point they're

6

constrained to follow the rule as opposed to having the

7

liberty to -- to change the procedures as they -- as

8

they deem fit at the last minute.

9

JUSTICE STEVENS:

They could --

Can I just clarify one

10

thing for myself?

11

Federal district court -- I'm not talking about the

12

State court -- did not rule on the merits of your

13

claim, but merely held that 1983 is not the proper

14

method of pursuing the claim?

15

MR. DOSS:

16

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Do I correctly understand that the

That's correct.
So that there hasn't been a

17

decision by a Federal judge on whether or not there's

18

merit to your case.

19

MR. DOSS:

20

JUSTICE STEVENS:

That is correct.
It's just a question of

21

which -- whether you do it by way of habeas corpus or

22

by 1983.

23

MR. DOSS:

That is -- that is correct, and it

24

was recharacterized as -- as a successive habeas

25

petition rather than a 1983 action.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And I suppose it's entirely

2

possible that if the judge then decided it is really --

3

if we said it should have been a 1983 action, the judge

4

could say, well, okay, even under 1983 the State has

5

the defense of laches and you still lose.

6

-- we don't know what's going to happen if we find out

7

-- if we agree with what your argument in this Court

8

is.

9

I mean, you

Is that right?
MR. DOSS:

It would go back for -- for an

10

analysis as to the equities of the situation, and --

11

and that being an intensely fact-bound procedure, the

12

district court is actually in -- in a better position

13

to go ahead and -- and be able to make that analysis

14

there at the district court level, a Gomez analysis as

15

to the equities that are involved within the situation.

16

So as -- as we sit here today, there has not

17

been any ruling on the merits of -- of this, and there

18

hasn't been any evidence produced in -- in any court

19

through testimony whatsoever regarding the issues of

20

the protocol and -- and things of -- of that nature

21

that we've been discussing here this morning.

22

And I think that -- that whenever -- whenever

23

you -- you look at -- actually if the Court doesn't

24

have any more questions, I'm going to reserve the

25

balance of my time.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Ms. Snurkowski, we'll hear now from you.

3

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CAROLYN M. SNURKOWSKI

4

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

5
6

MS. SNURKOWSKI:

Thank you, counsel.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

7

The State is here today to suggest that the

8

method that -- to challenge these claims is by habeas

9

corpus, and that the Federal district court, as well as

10

the Eleventh Circuit, was correct in finding that the

11

district court had correctly found it had no

12

jurisdiction because, in fact, it was a functional

13

equivalent of the habeas corpus.

14

But to -- to address some of the issues that

15

were currently brought before the Court today with

16

regard to the ability of the defendant to come forward

17

and discern what exactly was the method by which

18

Florida was intending to execute him, the record bears

19

out that, in fact, the Sims case was in the public

20

domain and, in fact, is the method by which Florida

21

does execute individuals.

22
23
24
25

There was --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But there's no statute and

there's no regulation that requires Florida to do that.
MS. SNURKOWSKI:
specific statute.

These -- there is no

The statute itself merely says that

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

lethal injection is the method by which Florida is to

2

execute individuals.

3

The Department of Corrections, through

4

rulemaking process internally, provides protocols for

5

the execution day and other protocols with regard to

6

the execution team performing its function on that

7

given day and -- and hours leading up to that.

8

that has not been changed nor modified, nor has it been

9

challenged --

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

11

no regulation.

12

will.

13

was done in Sims' case.

14

And

But there is no statute,

That means the executive can do what it

There's nothing that binds them to the way it

MS. SNURKOWSKI:

That is correct, to the

15

extent that there's no statutory provision or

16

regulatory rule because, in fact, under Florida -- the

17

Florida legislature has exempted rulemaking of the

18

Department of Corrections with regard to executions.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And I suppose that's --

20

that's the complaint.

21

place, we could address it.

22

itself the ability to change at any time, well, that's

23

-- we want to be told what it will be in our particular

24

case so we have a target that we can aim at.

25

If there was a procedure in

MS. SNURKOWSKI:

If Florida reserves to

And I understand that, but

27
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

the State would contend that based on the fact that

2

there have 16 executions since the time that Sims has

3

occurred and all those executions have been performed

4

exactly as the manner in which Sims has occurred, and

5

that there has not been any challenge to a deviance

6

from that, and in fact, the Florida Supreme Court has

7

ratified again in this case, when Mr. Hill brought his

8

Eighth Amendment claim, that Sims was the method of

9

execution in Florida, I think we have a very reasoned

10

determination that, in fact, the method of execution,

11

as it has been proposed in Sims, is currently the

12

method of execution that we utilize.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

But what he -- I -- I take

14

it the ripeness issue is -- he delayed in bringing it

15

because he wasn't certain what you'd do.

16

one of the reasons, I think, would be that it's only

17

recently there was an article in the Lancet --

And -- and

18

MS. SNURKOWSKI:

Correct.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- that says the -- in the

20

opinion of the doctors who wrote it, a significant

21

number of executed people are conscious when they die,

22

and that's painful.

23

And then it's been suggested there are ways

24

around that.

25

have a doctor or somebody there to make certain the

Just give them more sodium pentothal or

2

causing drugs take effect.

3

All right.

Now, that doesn't seem too

4

difficult.

5

too difficult.

6

Florida -- they can read there too.

7

who read these articles, and indeed, maybe they'll just

8

do it.

9

causing suffering.

10

Maybe it's difficult, but it doesn't seem
So why can't they think, you know,
They have people

They don't have any real interest in -- in
Why don't they just do it?

And so he thinks, up until the last minute,

11

that maybe Florida will just do it, and lo and behold,

12

when the death warrant is actually executed, it now

13

begins to appear that they won't.

14

that time, he brings the case.

15

And therefore, at

Now, I've spun out a story which seems

16

probable, but if it's true, it would be very

17

understandable why this wasn't ripe before the

18

execution warrant is issued and thereafter it is.

19

what is your reply on the ripeness question?

20

MS. SNURKOWSKI:

Now,

Well, my reply on the

21

ripeness question is, first of all, that I don't

22

believe that your scenario -- while I'll accept your

23

scenario as your scenario, it is not accurate with

24

regard to what occurred in Florida.

25

But apart from that, there has not been a

2

defendant.

have read and, in fact, did read the Lancet article and

made no statements with regard to his allegations --

MS. SNURKOWSKI:

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

Is the kind of thing I was

9

explaining why it would be ripe I think -- is that

10

accurate enough for the purposes of ripeness as to what

11

happened in Florida?

12
13

MS. SNURKOWSKI:

No.

And my answer, I would

suggest to you, is no --

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

No.

15

MS. SNURKOWSKI:

-- because I think it's part

16

of the pleadings.

17

wherewithal. If he felt that there was another manner

18

by which it could have been changed or that the

19

Department of Corrections, in this particular instance,

20

was suddenly going to -- now aware of the Lancet

21

article, would change its method, he has not made any

22

allegations of that, nor has he asked.

fact that in -- that he never asked.

7

-- use of this injection would cause excruciating pain.

8

Would the Petitioner who is objecting being exposed to

9

Suppose there

that have to come up with an alternative in order to

10

avoid the risk of excruciating pain?

11

MS. SNURKOWSKI:

Well, it seems to me, based

12

on this Court's decision in Nelson, that that was the

13

focal point of why relief was granted in the fashion it

14

was, that it was a proper issue to rely in 1983

15

because, in fact, there might be a -- he had proposed a

16

mechanism that might be alternative mechanism that was

17

accepted by the government.

18

the record is silent and -- which goes --

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In this instance, it's --

Well, my question to you

20

is -- I take it you're answering yes, that if they

21

prove that some people will be subject to excruciating

22

pain, that's not good enough unless the Petitioner

23

proposes an alternative, that it's all right for the

24

State to expose someone to the risk of what has -- what

25

has been determined to be the risk of excruciating pain

31
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

as long as the Petitioner himself doesn't come up with

2

an alternative.

3

MS. SNURKOWSKI:

Well, I think the answer is

4

twofold.

5

there reflect that there's a potential that that could

6

happen, there's not been evidence that it has occurred

7

or has happened, which has been necessarily what is the

8

precursor to when there has been changes in the method

9

of execution because there has been a history where, in

First of all, the fact that the articles out

10

fact, a botched execution has occurred no matter what

11

the method may have been.

12

The second part is that there has not be a --

13

a specific showing in this particular case, nor an

14

allegation for that matter, that any kind of event in

15

this particular case would, in fact, cause excruciating

16

or any kind of pain --

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, because there's been

18

no hearing.

19

open the door through 1983, and I -- I still don't

20

understand what your answer is to my question.

Bottom line of

That, in fact, I think that

7

he has to make some colorable showing of an alternative

that would be acceptable to him based on the procedures

because, again, the second prong of that seems to me --

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

11

MS. SNURKOWSKI:

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So the answer is yes.

Yes, Your Honor.

I'm sorry.

The court, having found

13

that some people will be subject to excruciating pain,

14

still no Eighth Amendment violation because the

15

Petitioner hasn't come up with an alternative.

16

MS. SNURKOWSKI:

Yes.

obligation to do this?

has to propose a less painful alternative?

legislative feeling that unless that procedure were

followed, there's a risk of undue pain to the dogs and

sufficiently convincing to get the Florida legislature

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, I would have

18

thought your -- your answer to the line of questioning

19

earlier was that the reason that the Petitioner has to

20

come up with this -- an alternative is that otherwise

21

it's plausible, at least, to suspect the reason he's

22

bringing the action is as a challenge to the execution

23

itself rather than the particular method.

24

it's a challenge to the execution itself, it has to be

25

brought under habeas.

And that if

If it's just a challenge to the

2

unwilling to say there is a valid method, then it

3

starts to look like a challenge to the execution that

4

has to be brought under habeas.

MS. SNURKOWSKI:

If he's

position the State has taken, and I'm sorry if I did

not articulate that in a fashion that --

JUSTICE BREYER:

But in respect to that core

position, I can understand the State's concern with the

10

possibility of abuse.

11

says is it points to Gomez, and Gomez was a 1983 case.

12

And there, the Court denied a stay of the execution

13

because it looked into the history of the litigation,

14

and they said that this particular individual had done

context.

arguing for something else, it seems to me that the

basis upon which we are here today is to determine

It would come within the Heck

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, our view is that the

10

Heck principle is not applicable here where a prisoner

11

is seeking relief that is indisputably available in

12

habeas.

13

really the touchstone here is this Court's decision in

14

Preiser v. Rodriguez, which drew the distinction that

15

the Court has long recognized between claims

16

challenging the conditions of a prisoner's confinement

17

and claims challenging the fact or duration of that

18

confinement.

19

Our view is that the governing precedent and

that which renders the claim --

where a prisoner brings an open-ended claim of the type

Yes, and if I bring a claim

one particular way.

I think that the cold

I may, the reason that the identification of an

of an alternative that renders the claim the functional

equivalent of a conditions of confinement claim because

a conditions of confinement claim is really necessarily

predicated on the assumption that the prisoner will

the claim is successful.

12

prisoner claims that his cell is too cold, the

necessary implication is that the prisoner will be able

to continue to be imprisoned at some higher

temperature, even if the prisoner does not specify in

his complaint that he wants to be held at 70 degrees or

72 degrees.

Where a prisoner fails to identify an

alternative, the risk here is that such a claim could

delay and may, in fact, prevent the ultimate execution

11

of the death sentence.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What about the risks that

the claim that fails to identify a permissible

there would be no functional difference is if the State

chose to, in fact, litigate the issue, notwithstanding

his identification of the permissible alternative.

This -- this is a death

It was not that amusing.
Let me ask you this.

Doesn't the State have

5

some minimal obligation under the Eighth Amendment to

6

do the necessary research to assure that this is the

7

most humane method possible?

8

minimal obligation on its own to do that?

9

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Doesn't the State have a

I'm not sure whether it -- it

10

would have an obligation to use the most humane method

11

under the Eighth Amendment because this Court's cases

12

have only suggested that the gratuitous infliction of

13

pain is barred by the Eighth Amendment.

14

of any cases --

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I'm not aware

Well, I can define

16

gratuitous -- I don't have the dictionary here.

17

gratuitous means essentially unnecessary.

18

were other -- other means, other alternatives, that

19

might be used, it seems to me that the State might have

20

some minimal obligation to investigate those.

21

MR. SHANMUGAM:

But

If there

Well, I think more broadly,

22

Justice Kennedy, that one reason that States do have

23

discretion in this area -- and I think that Florida is

24

not unusual in that regard -- is that prison officials

25

are expected to adopt to evolving methods of execution

47
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

1

and to take into account changes that might suggest

2

that a particular method is problematic.

3

whether or not there is a constitutional obligation, I

4

think that there is every reason to think that States

5

will, in fact, do that.

And so

6

I think that it is noteworthy --

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But is there -- is there in

8

this case?

9

there for a while, and it certainly is enough to

I mean, the Lancet article has been out

10

suggest, in your words, that there is something

11

problematic about the manner in which Florida proposes

12

to do this.

13

Florida has made any effort whatsoever to find an

14

alternative or, for that matter, to -- to disprove what

15

the Lancet article suggests.

16

And yet, we have not heard a word that

And so it's one thing for you to say the

17

States have discretion.

18

Justice Kennedy's question as to why the State does not

19

have an obligation to fulfill its constitutional duty

20

to execute without gratuitous pain.

21

why you have given any answer to -- to the proposal

22

that that obligation requires the State to do some

23

investigation of it's own.

24
25

MR. SHANMUGAM:

I don't think that answers

And I don't see

Well, whether or not the

State has that obligation -- it may very well have that

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

obligation as a constitutional matter, but putting that

2

to one side, it does seem as if the critical question

3

is whether or not the State, in fact, has adopted a

4

method that inflicts cruel and unusual punishment, and

5

where a prisoner has a claim of that variety, a

6

prisoner has other options if the prisoner is unwilling

7

to identify a permissible alternative to bring that

8

claim besides --

in imposing the death penalty, use a method that

inflicts the least amount of pain.

The Court has not held that.

19

there's some range between most humane and what's cruel

and unusual.

21

Right?

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, I think that that is

22

presumably true, based on the formulations that this

gratuitous or wanton infliction of pain as opposed to

18

that the 1983 is a civil action, and the plaintiff has

19

the burden of proof, burden of producing evidence.

20

MR. DOSS:

That is true.

That is true, and

21

we would be prepared to do that if we were allowed to

22

go back and -- and proceed.

23

at the -- at the pleadings stage, and as we sit here

24

today, since there hasn't been an answered filed, our

25

-- our pleadings are -- are accepted as -- as true for

5

can't do it for humans.

6

They can -- they can lay

That's perfectly in the open.

Yet, they shroud this in secrecy.

We can't get public

7

records. We can't -- 3.852(h)(3) of the Florida Code of

8

Criminal Procedure prevents us from going and getting

9

these records before --

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Do you think there

11

was adequate time for the district court to fully

12

consider the evidence you intended to present and

13

consider your claim and still proceed with the

14

execution that was scheduled?

15

MR. DOSS:

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

17
18

No.
You filed your case 4

days before the execution.
MR. DOSS:

No, but we were put in that

19

posture by -- by the way the State of Florida has

20

chosen to -- to vest this total discretion, shroud

21

everything in secrecy, and then complain that we didn't

22

bring it earlier when we --

Because at that point, I knew that

they had total discretion.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, it seems to me that

11

you might -- you might have alleged that -- that you've

12

read articles, Lancet articles, and so forth, and that

13

there is a substantial risk that they're going to do

14

this.

I think that might suffice.

15

MR. DOSS:

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That -And -- and it would -- it

17

would mean that the -- as the Chief Justice indicates,

18

the court has more time to look at this.

19

MR. DOSS:

As far as -- as far as the -- the

20

ripeness issue, it's not -- because of the way Florida

21

chose to do their procedure, it was not ripe, and it

22

doesn't comport with this Court's basic ripeness

23

doctrine that we are going to presume it's going to be

24

done a certain way when the State can come in and say,

25

it's not ripe for review, we -- we still have the

If they -- if they never told us,

I guess we would be in -- in a position of -- of

assuming Sims is in place.

But the thing is, is that

it's an equitable -- it's an equitable argument.
