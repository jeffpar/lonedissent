ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS IN 04-1704

12

MR. OLSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Respondents dispute the wisdom, efficacy, and

13

constitutionality of Ohio's franchise tax system, but

14

they face two insurmountable obstacles in this Court.

15

First, they cannot demonstrate any actual, concrete,

16

and direct injury as a result of Ohio's investment tax

17

credit to satisfy the irreducible minimum requirement

18

for standing in this Court.

19

Dormant Commerce Clause challenge that they bring is

20

without merit.

21

Secondly, the facial

Ohio imposes no burdens or tariffs on

22

interstate commerce.

24

local, or interstate businesses.

Respondents are not injured when a business

with which they do not compete receives a reduction in

their taxes as a result of a tax credit.

MR. OLSON:

Mr. Olson, who would have
I understand your argument

I'm not sure, Justice Ginsburg.

15

In some of this Court's Dormant Commerce Clause cases,

16

competitors, who are arguably injured because they are

17

paying a higher tax against the -- compared to the

18

company that's receiving the benefit -- in a couple of

19

cases, this Court has recognized customers of companies

20

that are paying higher products, and, therefore,

21

potentially higher prices, for the products that they

22

purchase.

recognized for purposes of standing.

Some of our opinions say

MR. OLSON:

What -- Justice Scalia, I think

9

the strongest statement is in the Valley Forge case, at

10

page 489, where the Court said, "If Respondents have no

11

-- the argument that if Respondents have no standing to

12

sue, no one would have standing, is not a reason to

13

find standing."

14

requirement that must be observed only when satisfied.

15

But the fact is that under any standard articulated by

16

this Court in its article III cases, the Respondents

17

here do not having standing.

the words of this Court, with respect to them.

This would convert "standing" into a

And

Mr. Olson, I had asked you

23

the question, because I wanted to know whether this

24

case was distinguishable from Flast in that regard,

although I recognize your quotation from Valley Forge.

That -- Flast seemed to be a case that fit that

2

description, that there was no one who would have a

3

better claim for injury, in fact.

4

MR. OLSON:

Well, nonetheless, the Court made

5

that distinction in the Flast case with respect to the

6

Establishment Clause, and, specifically, the spending

7

and taxing powers exercised by Congress.

8

determined, in that case, that the Establishment Clause

9

was a specific limitation on spending authority.

And the Court

The

10

Court has been very careful, and many Justices of this

11

Court, individually, have said that that distinction in

12

that case will not be extended beyond the Establishment

13

Clause, in the context of spending, in connection with

14

a religious conviction, or the establishment of a

15

religion.

16

think, that that is not going to be extended.

17

The Court has indicated, frequently, I

At any rate, it wouldn't be extended -- the

18

logic of Flast wouldn't be applicable here anyway.

19

This is not an application of the spending power by

20

Congress or the taxing power by Congress.

authority to Congress, and, at most, under the Dormant

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It's --

the other ones, then we do have to consider whether

there's a pig to piggyback them onto.

MR. OLSON:

No, we're saying -- we -- the

circumstances, to challenge municipal actions,

This -- with respect

Mr. Olson, I don't mean to

deflect you from getting on to the merits, but there

8

was one point in your brief that was of concern to me.

9

That is, you said that you questioned whether,

10

assuming we accept your argument on standing, it would

11

be appropriate to return this case to the court of

12

appeals with instructions that it be remanded to the

13

State court and with the counsel fees that 1447 entitle

14

one to.

15

And you said that would not be right.
MR. OLSON:

No.

We believe that the case was

properly removed, and, therefore, there's not counsel

17

fees with respect to the removal statute; that the

18

proper resolution would be to vacate the Sixth Circuit

19

decision and then remand to the district court for a

dismissal because of lack of standing, or the Court --

this Court hasn't resolved whether it would be a

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:
We agree with DaimlerChrysler's position,
both as to standing and as to the merits.

The

Respondents' grievance as taxpayers, the sole standing

11

argument they press here, is a textbook example of the

12

generalized public grievance that the Court has

13

repeatedly rejected as a basis for -- or for standing.

Respondents' only claimed taxpayer harm is their

assertion that the State fist loses money as a result

of the investment tax credit.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yes, Your Honor -Do they have

standing?

16

MR. COLE:

Yes.

And I wanted to respond a

17

little bit to Justice Scalia's point.

18

they're trying to claim is, because they have municipal

19

taxpayer standing to challenge the property tax

20

exemption, that that somehow allows them, then, to

21

sweep in their challenge to the investment tax credit,

22

as well.

23

taxpayer standing to challenge the property tax

exemption.

25

gives them standing to also challenge the ITC.

And that's because it's a

2

local -- it's a Toledo city property tax, is that the

3

distinction you're making?

4

MR. COLE:

Well, the property tax exemption

5

is a State tax program, Your Honor, but it requires

action by local city leaders --

the local action --

you distinguish the municipal taxpayer.

MR. COLE:

In a sense, that's right, Your

18

between a municipal citizen and a municipal corporation

19

is akin to between a shareholder and a corporation,

generally, and that, in some instances, that will allow

their municipal leaders, in a sense.

So, a tax -- just --

2

so, a taxpayer in Wyoming can't challenge the State tax,

3

because his claim is too diffuse, but a resident in New

4

York City can challenge the city tax, because it's not.

5

MR. COLE:

Your Honor, when looked at from a

6

numerical basis, I agree that the distinction might not

seem to carry a lot of weight.

8

not looked at it in terms of numbers, it has looked at

it in terms of the, quote, "special relationship" that

exists independent of the size of the municipality.

And presumably that special relationship

But, in any event, whether or not they have

municipal taxpayer standing to challenge the property

tax exemption, there's no way to somehow grow that into

standing to challenge the separate enactment by the

Ohio General Assembly.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

There's also a

redressability problem, too, isn't there?

assuming they could, is there any -- would action

against the Assembly eliminate their tax?

MR. COLE:

It wouldn't, Your Honor, although -No?

There are some -- at least

my only suggestion was that, even if there is municipal

But there, in the Flast case, it was a

situation where they were using two theories to attack

the same legislative enactment.

Here, they're trying

10

to attack a statute which they haven't shown causes

11

them any harm.

12

that they are bringing is, in a sense, an abstract

challenge.

14

that's judicially cognizable.

ancillary standing theory, which would represent a

also like to turn to the merits, briefly, of the

Respondents' claim.

We believe Respondents' claim also fails on
the merits of the Dormant Commerce Clause.

Ohio

10

provides a benefit for those who invest in the State;

11

but Respondents have not, and cannot, identify any

12

burden that the ITC places on interstate commerce.

13

Absent that burden, their Dormant Commerce Clause claim

14

fails.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

On the merits, I think that

16

their claim is -- take company A and company B.

18

people, have a certain payroll, have a certain amount

19

of property, and have a certain amount of business.

18

"discriminatory" is, Does it somehow tax your decision

credit doesn't have that characteristic that the Court

2

has found so troubling.

3

In fact, looking back through the Court's

4

cases, over and over again this notion of burden comes

5

up, and -- whereby, "burden," it means "imposing taxes

6

on the business of other State," all the way back to

7

Guy versus Baltimore, "You can't build up your commerce

8

by means of an -- unequal and oppressive burdens upon

9

the industry and business of other States."

10

So, certainly if Ohio were attempting to tax

11

DaimlerChrysler, or treat DaimlerChrysler worse because

12

it had put a plant in Missouri, that would create a

13

Dormant Commerce Clause question.

14

simply nothing like that.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

MR. ENRICH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I'd like to begin with the question of
standing, and then turn to the Commerce Clause merits.
Let me begin at the point where Petitioners

15

and Respondents agree on the question of standing.

16

original lawsuit brought by Respondents in the Ohio

17

State Court raised two claims, one challenging the

18

investment tax credit that's before this Court today,

19

the other challenging the property tax exemption.

20

point on which Petitioners and Respondents agree is

21

that Respondents do have standing, in their status as

22

municipal taxpayers, to bring their challenge to the

23

property tax exemption.

24

court agreed and found that there was standing, in the

25

district court's judgment, to reach both parts of the

2

taxpayer standing.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is there any -What was --

Is there any authority at

6

all for saying you can piggyback the basic case or

7

controversy requirement?

8

you can hook a nondiverse claim, but it's a claim; it's

9

a case or controversy.

I mean, it's one thing to say

I'm -- I don't know of any

10

authority that says that you can -- you can take a

11

matter that is not a constitutional case or controversy

12

and latch it onto something that does qualify.

13

MR. ENRICH:

Justice Ginsburg, there are two

14

reasons why we believe that there is such a basis.

15

First, there are cases -- one case in this Court, in

16

Flast v. Cohen, where the Court has found that standing

17

to raise one claim extended, as well, to raise, in that

18

case, a free-exercise claim.

19

such cases in the courts of appeals.

20

has recognized a concept of what they refer to as

21

"ancillary standing" on that basis.

22

There are a number of
Wright and Miller

But the second point that we think is perhaps

23

more important is, once there is one claim in the case

24

that satisfies the article III "case and controversy"

25

requirement, then there is a case or controversy here.

28
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

The question that then faces this Court is, how far

2

should it reach in addressing the other claims which

3

are part of that very same case or controversy?

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I think it was pointed out

5

that, in Flast, at least, you were dealing with the

6

same spending on the part of the Federal Government.

7

Here, you have apples and oranges.

8

quite discrete from the investment tax credit.

9

MR. ENRICH:

The property tax is

That is true, Your Honor.

And

10

in at least some of the circuit court cases, they have

11

reached a second claim where the -- where a different

12

part of the same transaction was being attacked.

13

Sierra Club case that we cite in our brief is one good

14

example of that.

15

The

In the present case, the two issues that we

16

challenge both arise out of the very same transaction,

17

out of a deal that was entered into between the City of

18

Toledo and DaimlerChrysler --

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Can I back you up

20

just a bit before we talk about piggybacking?

21

Court hasn't held that municipal taxpayers have

22

standing in this sort of situation, have they?

23

MR. ENRICH:

This

No, this Court has not ever had

24

to address the question of municipal taxpayer standing,

25

except in Establishment Clause contexts.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So, if you want us to

2

piggyback, we -- and if it is an article III question

3

- we would have to decide that issue before we can

4

decide whether we can piggyback your current claims

5

onto it.

6

MR. ENRICH:

Mr. Chief Justice, you would at

7

least have to decide the question of whether municipal

8

taxpayer standing was -- satisfied the article III

9

requirements under your standing doctrines.

If you

10

found that it satisfied the article III requirements,

11

then that would suffice to bring this case or

12

controversy past the article III threshold --

13
14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And you agree

that the --

15
16

Right.

MR. ENRICH:

-- bring us to prudential

threshold.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And you agree that

18

the municipal taxpayer standing on the property tax

19

question is an open issue before this Court.

20

not had a holding on that.

21

MR. ENRICH:

We have

That's absolutely correct, Your

22

Honor.

23

consistent holdings of every circuit court that has

24

addressed this topic, it would make sense for this

25

Court to acknowledge municipal taxpayer standing, or,

We would suggest that, in keeping with the

30
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

at the very least, to acknowledge that the obstacles,

2

any obstacles to municipal taxpayer standing, are

3

prudential obstacles, rather than article III

4

obstacles.

5

There are actually other reasons why we

6

believe the article III barrier is crossed.

7

that this case -- that, as Judge Posner wrote in a

8

recent opinion that we referenced in a letter to the

9

Court -- it came out after our brief was filed -- in

We believe

10

his analysis of the taxpayer standing cases, he

11

concluded that the Court's burden on taxpayer standing

12

was based on prudential, not on constitutional grounds.

13

We believe his analysis is correct.

14

Once this becomes a question of the

15

prudential standards, we believe that the very

16

particular factual history of this case provides ample

17

reason for the Court to find that there should be

18

standing in this particular case to reach the

19

investment tax-credit claim.

20

Respondents brought this case in the Ohio

21

State courts largely out of a recognition that the

22

standards for standing were different in the State and

23

Federal courts in this area.

24

felt that we didn't have standing in Ohio, perhaps the

25

wisest strategy for them would have been to oppose

might say, "But you don't have standing," and require

she was complaining about a denial of equal protection

MR. ENRICH:

True,

Justice Ginsburg, the premise

behind our argument is that the article III hurdle is

cleared on other grounds, on grounds that I've already

discussed and we can certainly reiterate.

then becomes -- on prudential grounds.

And that is the

10

issue that was presented in Craig, that she had a

the prudential standards because she was asserting

was, because the parties had adjudicated the issue

MR. ENRICH:

It is, indeed, Your Honor.

We

4

acknowledge that, although, again, as I say, in some of

5

the lower court cases there have been challenges where

6

the claim that the plaintiffs did not have standing

7

with regard to was challenging a different outcome in

8

the same transaction or occurrence.

example was a challenge to an environmental impact

The specific

10

statement, where the plaintiffs had standing to

11

challenge certain elements, but did not have standing

12

to challenge the potential -- the failure of this

13

impact statement to consider impacts on indigenous

14

tribes.

16

their other standing claims, to reach that claim, as

well.

If I can turn, Your Honors, to the merits, if

19

Ohio were to impose an income tax on those corporations

20

which did their manufacturing outside of the State of

21

Ohio, but not to impose that tax on those businesses

22

which did their manufacturing inside of Ohio, there's

23

no question that such attacks would violate the

24

Commerce Clause by facially discriminating in favor of

25

in-State business activity.

It would be a tariff, by

MR. ENRICH:

Well, I'm -- in the case of a

lower income tax rate, Your Honor -- it's a different

15

situation for the lower property tax rate, but take the

16

lower income tax rate first -- the lower income tax

rate will reduce the tax burden on all businesses,

MR. ENRICH:

Yes, Your Honor.

The

7

discrimination here is not between those businesses

8

which are not present at all in Ohio and those which

9

are doing their manufacturing in Ohio, the

10

discrimination is between those who are doing business

11

in Ohio, but not locating their new manufacturing

12

activity in Ohio, and those who do business in Ohio,

13

but do locate their new manufacturing activity.

14

is the same situation that the Court has confronted

15

over and over again.

16

discrimination only affected those purchasers or

17

sellers of stock where the transactions had sufficient

18

nexus with New York to be subject to New York's tax.

19

The problem was that, of that universe of transactions,

20

the ones where the sale was made on a New York exchange

objection here that you don't agree that a State should

people fight it out?

MR. ENRICH:

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

16
17

Justice Scalia, our objection -Why should that be an issue

that a court should decide?
MR. ENRICH:

-- our objection is that when

18

States use discriminatory tax measures as a way to

19

provide tax benefits to those businesses that locate in

20

the jurisdiction, that it leads to a competition

21

between the States that ends up hurting taxpayers, like

22

Respondents here, by reducing the ability of the States

to generate tax revenues from business.

MR. ENRICH:

That is simply the effect of a free choice, and any

11

business is free to make that choice.

12

MR. ENRICH:

Your Honor, we would suggest

13

that that is exactly the situation in many of the cases

14

that this Court has previously struck down as facially

15

discriminatory tax provisions.

16

anyone could move to Hawaii and produce pineapple wine

17

and receive the benefit of the tax exemption.

19

the New York exchanges, rather than an out-of-State

20

exchange, and get the benefit of the lower rate.

What this Court has consistently said is,

22

when the benefit that is given is -- takes the form of

23

a credit, an exemption, a reduction in a tax which

24

applies to out-of-State businesses, transactions, and

25

there was not taxation being made of the out-of-State

subject to the same analysis?

2

MR. ENRICH:

No, Your Honor, it would not.

3

As this Court has suggested, as far back as Hughes v.

4

Alexandria Scrap, when the State is essentially acting

5

as a participant in the market, deploying its own

6

resources

7

-JUSTICE STEVENS:

No, they wouldn't be acting

8

-- other than the one transaction, "We'll give you one

9

particular benefit in this new development progress --

10

project, with no further participation as a market

11

participant or anything like that," that would -- it

12

seems to me that would fit right into your analysis.

13

MR. ENRICH:

Well, in terms of its economic

14

effect, it would, Your Honor, but this Court, in cases

15

like Camps Newfoundland, has recognized a significant

16

distinction between cash subsidies, on the one hand,

17

and tax benefits, on the other, largely because the tax

18

that is reduced is a tax which does involve an exercise

19

of what this Court has called "a primeval governmental

20

activity," and constitutes a kind of regulation which

21

brings it within the scope of the Dormant Commerce

22

Clause; whereas, in -- ordinarily, a direct subsidy

23

paid out of the general funds of the State does not

24

involve any such regulatory impact on interstate

25

commerce.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But in terms of

2

discrimination and economic impact, they really are the

3

same?

4

MR. ENRICH:

5

there's a wide, wide continuum.

6

is the standard -- the pure tariff.

7

there is providing training for workers or

8

infrastructure for a plant.

9

recognized that tariffs are unconstitutional.

Yes, Your Honor.

In fact,

At the one end, there
On the other end,

This Court has clearly
There is

10

no suggestion that providing training or infrastructure

would be.

12

All of those have the same economic effect.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, but they're -- what our

13

opinions hold are that there are some matters of

14

producing the same result as a cash subsidy --

15

MR. ENRICH:

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

17

Yes.
-- that are no good, but

there are other matters that are perfectly okay.

18

MR. ENRICH:

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That -And the mere fact that it

20

has the same effect as a cash subsidy is not a problem,

21

as far as the Commerce Clause is concerned.

22

you're arguing here is, the mere fact that it has that

23

effect of favoring businesses that choose to locate in

24

Ohio is what makes it bad, not the fact that it's

25

relieving, from a tax that applies to both in-State and

2

That's -- that was the Hawaii case, and all the other

3

cases you cite.

4

the mere fact of providing a subsidy violates the

5

Commerce Clause.

But what your argument here is that

And I don't know --

6

MR. ENRICH:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

8

MR. ENRICH:

9

No, Your Honor --- any case --

-- what we're suggesting is that

a measure which has the identical effect, and is

10

structured very much like a provision which applies a

11

tax to those businesses who engage in out-of-State

12

activity, while excusing from tax those businesses that

13

engage in in-State activity, is a tariff, by another

14

name.

And this provision, as --

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Except the criterion is not

credit is a quid pro quo.

21

domiciled.

20

underlying taxes were, in all respects, identical.

21

The problem that the Court recognized in

Westinghouse is that by giving a credit that was

restricted to a particular kind of in-State activity,

effectively providing a benefit to in-State business

struck it down.

But -And he's not getting

20

the benefit of this, because his homestead -- he lives

MR. ENRICH:

that the question is whether the tax scheme in question

in the State whose provision is being challenged

imposes differential burdens on two different entities

of the homestead exemption, the State offering the

homestead exemption is not saying, "We'll tax you if

6

repeatedly avoided judging the legitimacy of one

State's tax by the question of what other States did.

say, "You're going to be taxed at a lower rate if

that's where you're living, if that's your homestead;

12

but if you happen to live outside the State, you're going

13

to get taxed at a higher rate."

14

very similar to what you're challenging here.

15

MR. ENRICH:

It would seem to be

Your Honor, maybe I'm not

16

understanding your example.

17

State that's offering the homestead exemption was

18

imposing a tax on the property located outside the

19

State?

20

Are you imagining that the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, it's imposing tax

21

on property in the State at a higher rate if it's not

22

the person's homestead; in other words, if they don't

23

live in the State.

24
25

MR. ENRICH:

Okay.

So, that is a provision

that, I think, does raise at least some questions.

It's one

49
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

where I think there are strong justifications outside

2

of the effect on interstate commerce that very well

3

might provide ample justification for it.

4

and the question on which we have asked this Court to

5

grant cert about the property tax exemption raises

6

precisely the question of what sorts of conditions on a

7

property tax exemption do, and what sorts do not,

8

constitute discrimination against interstate commerce.

9

I would suggest that there would be ample opportunity

10

to distinguish something like the homestead provision,

encouraging in-State economic activity from --
