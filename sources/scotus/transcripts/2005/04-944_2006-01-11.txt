ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY A. SCHWARTZ

10
11

We'll hear argument

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SCHWARTZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
A Federal court has subject matter

14

jurisdiction over a claim brought under title VII

15

regardless of whether an employer has 15 employees.

16

This is so because when Congress enacted title VII, it

17

included a specific jurisdictional grant and that grant

18

provides that jurisdiction will exist in the Federal

19

courts over all claims brought under the act.

20

This specific grant of jurisdiction is

21

consistent with the more general grant of jurisdiction

22

contained in 28 U.S.C. 1331 wherein Federal question

23

jurisdiction exists over all claims that arise under a

24

Federal law.

25

Title VII is a Federal law.

The Fifth Circuit erred when it -- when it

3
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

determined that the employer numerosity issue went to

2

the subject matter jurisdiction of the court.

3

Indeed, when title VII was passed, Congress

4

actually expanded jurisdiction, the Federal question

5

issue of title VII, because at that time 28 U.S.C. 1331

6

had a $10,000 amount in controversy requirement that

7

Congress did away with because the jurisdictional grant

8

contained within title VII made no mention of the

9

$10,000 requirement.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So you say -- so now it's

11

essentially redundant.

12

jurisdictional amount, no amount in controversy, the

13

jurisdictional provision in title VII is just going

14

over the same territory.

15

Is that so?

Now that 1331 has no

It doesn't add or detract.

16

MR. SCHWARTZ:

17

Indeed, the question --

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

19
20

I would agree with that.

In the first sentence, but

not in the venue part.
MR. SCHWARTZ:

Not in the venue part and --

21

and certainly -- because it does apply to which

22

district court a case should be brought.

23

it -- it's redundant to the extent of conferring

24

jurisdiction to a Federal court, but not on the venue

25

provision --

I would say

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Which is not subject

2

matter jurisdiction, which is what we're concerned with

3

here.

4
5
6

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Right.

It's not an issue in

this case.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What about the

7

argument, though, that when you're talking about a

8

threshold question like coverage, who the statute

9

covers, and it's quite different from the cause of

10
11

action cases, many of which you rely on in your brief?
MR. SCHWARTZ:

Well, we're talking here about

12

a question of whether or not coverage is subject matter

13

jurisdiction, and it's our position that once you go

14

beyond the text and you start evaluating the various

15

aspects of title VII, Mr. Chief Justice, you are going

16

down a -- a slippery slope.

17

An example would be a case perhaps where a --

18

in fact, a case that I'm currently involved in where a

19

plaintiff is alleging that they were discharged

20

discriminatorily.

21

employer's perspective, that that person was never

22

terminated.

23

an essential issue of a cause of action.

24

of title VII --

25

And the reality is from the

They're still an active employee.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That is

The coverage

It's more a question

5
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

of -- of whether or not the -- there's been a violation

2

of title VII.

3

employee issue is whether you're covered at all,

4

whether you have to conform your conduct to that law.

5

Your question -- your -- your case of whether someone

6

has been discharged or not just goes to whether there's

7

been a violation.

8
9

It seems to me that the number of

MR. SCHWARTZ:

That's correct, Mr. Chief

Justice, but I believe that the analogy applies because

10

it still goes to whether or not you start reading the

11

act beyond the jurisdictional grant.

12

to go beyond the jurisdictional grant because --

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It's unnecessary

But in City of -- in

14

City of Kenosha, of course, the Court went beyond the

15

jurisdictional grant and it said that the definition of

16

the term person in 1983 raised a jurisdictional

17

question.

18

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Well, I -- I would not

19

necessarily agree that that goes beyond the

20

jurisdictional grant because the jurisdictional grant

21

of -- contained in 1334 -- 1343 requires that -- that

22

jurisdiction apply against a person acting under color

23

of State law.

24

done many times of putting qualifiers within a

25

jurisdictional grant.

And that's an example which Congress has

6
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

An example of -- of that we have -- we attached

2

60 such statutes to our appendix in our reply brief, but

3

a specific example, which I think is applicable here, is

4

the Uniformed Service Employee Reemployment Rights Act

5

wherein Congress put in that the act would only apply

6

jurisdictionally, subject matter jurisdictionally,

7

against employers.

8

definition of employer further on in -- in the statute

9

which is missing here because title --

And then there's a subsequent

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

11

consequence of the one or the other?

12

you don't raise it below, you can still raise it on

13

appeal if it's jurisdictional.

14

MR. SCHWARTZ:

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What's the practical
Number one, if

Right?

That's correct.
And number two, the -- if

16

it's a jurisdictional question, it would be decided by

17

the -- by the judge rather than by the jury?

18

MR. SCHWARTZ:

That's correct as well.

And I

19

would go further that the practical problem is what

20

happened in our case where it wasn't raised in the

21

trial -- in -- in the case until after a trial on the

22

merits and after the jury returned the verdict, and we

23

wasted a lot of time.

24

up beforehand as a -- a substantive motion for summary

25

judgment or a 12(b)(6) motion if the pleadings resolved

It -- it could have been brought

the issue.

2
3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But that's always the case.

I mean, why -- you know, if those disadvantages --

4

those disadvantages will always exist.

5

Congress ever make something jurisdictional rather than

6

simply making it an element of the cause of action?

7

You understand what I'm saying?

8

a consequence.

9

MR. SCHWARTZ:

10
11

So why would

I mean, that's always

Well, I -- I think the --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And yet, you -- you

acknowledge that some things are jurisdictional.

12

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Well, I -- I think if I'm --

13

if I'm an attorney representing a plaintiff and I want

14

to make an evaluation of whether or not I have a claim,

15

I want to first evaluate do I pass a jurisdictional

16

threshold.

17

and says, look, this happened to me, I want to bring a

18

cause of action, and I know that they employ less than

19

15 people, then I'm not going to waste my time.

20

If a come -- a person comes into my office

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, but what's the rule

21

that you suggest we look to in deciding whether a

22

provision is jurisdictional?

23

Justice pointed out, in 1983 cases where the question

24

is whether the defendant is a person, we've held that

25

is jurisdictional.

Because, as the Chief

So what is the rule in telling us

8
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

when we should treat something as jurisdictional?

2

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Well, the rule that has

3

existed for some time now, going back to Bell v. Hood,

4

is a -- a fair way to look at this.

5

Federal law, creates a cause of action, then a cause --

6

a cause of action lies absent Congress expressly

7

limiting or qualifying an -- a jurisdictional element

8

within its grant contained within that law, which is --

9

which is missing completely in title VII.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

claim that you must prove?
MR. SCHWARTZ:

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes.
Or there could be an

affirmative defense and you're not claiming the latter.

16
17

What would you call this?

Would you call 15 or more employees an element of your

13

15

If a statute, a

MR. SCHWARTZ:

It could be an affirmative

defense.

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you're -- you're

19

accepting that it is your burden rather than the

20

employer's to show that the employer had fewer than 15

21

employees.

22

MR. SCHWARTZ:

23

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

24

MR. SCHWARTZ:

25

More than 15, yes, Your Honor.
More than.

Yes.

That -- that's the

plaintiff's burden just like it's the plaintiff's

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

burden to prove that they were terminated --

3

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Did you establish that in

the course of the proceedings?

4

MR. SCHWARTZ:

We did not plead it with

5

particularity.

6

harassed the plaintiff, and then thereafter in the

7

pretrial order, it was not raised as a contested issue

8

of fact.

9

would control in that instance because the --

10

We pled that the employer sexually

And I believe the law of the case doctrine

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I was going to ask what --

11

how does the waiver work?

12

verdict says, you know, I'm concerned that there are

13

less than 15 employees.

14

well, now, Your Honor, you can't get into that?

15

waived that.

16

that work?

Suppose the judge pre-

Can the plaintiff say, oh,

They didn't raise it.

MR. SCHWARTZ:

I mean, how does

If it's -- if it doesn't go to

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Under your theory of the

case?

They

MR. SCHWARTZ:

-- then I would say that it is

waived, if it's been answered --

23

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, but if it's your

24

burden to prove it, how can it be waived by the

25

defendant?

I don't understand your theory.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You mean the judge just has

to watch the case sail over the waterfall and --

3

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Well, let's talk about two

4

different examples.

5

that the employer has 15 or more employees and is

6

subject to title VII for liability purposes and the

7

defendant in their answer admits that fact, then that

8

becomes a -- a admission --

If we have pled with particularity

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

10

mentions it but the judge.

11

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Well, in my case nobody

All right.

So we have alleged

12

in our lawsuit that the employer terminated or sexually

13

harassed the plaintiff and the -- there is not -- it's

14

not particularly pled.

15

Justice Kennedy?

16

Is that the hypothetical,

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Yes, and the -- and the

17

judge calls it sua sponte to the attention of the

18

parties.

19

MR. SCHWARTZ:

I would think that if the

20

judge in a -- in a Federal cause of action was troubled

21

by any element of the claim, based upon his or her own

22

review of the factual setting, it's conceivable that --

23

that the court then could entertain motions on that

24

particular issue.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, wait.

You -- you

11
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

pleaded -- you pleaded that -- that the defendant was

2

-- was an employer under the act.

3

MR. SCHWARTZ:

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Right?

Yes.
And it's the definition of

5

employer that says he has to have more than -- more

6

than 15 employees.

7

your complaint, you -- you at least implied and maybe

8

said that this person is an employer under the act.

9

it seems to me at that point the -- the burden shifts

So, in effect, you -- in making

So

10

to the other side to say -- the burden of going forward

11

of saying no, this person isn't an employer under the

12

act, and if they say nothing, then they've accepted

13

what -- what your complaint on its face says.

14
15

MR. SCHWARTZ:

I agree with you, Justice

Scalia.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

17

(Laughter.)

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I knew you would.

But -- but maybe --

19

but that doesn't sound like a reasonable agreement.

20

All you -- so you file one sentence saying this person

21

violated title VII.

22

the allegations of what constitutes a violation of

23

title VII because if you didn't allege every particular

24

element, it wouldn't be a violation of title VII?

25

That's not how pleading works.

Are you impliedly including all of

1

MR. SCHWARTZ:

No.

And -- and I can -- I can

2

tell you, Mr. Chief Justice, I have probably handled

3

500 causes of action for discrimination cases, and I've

4

never seen anybody plead the issue of whether or not

5

somebody has 15 employees.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

In your pleadings, did you

say he's an employer?

8

MR. SCHWARTZ:

9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

10

It's just not done.

Yes.
Did you use the term

employer?

11

MR. SCHWARTZ:

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

13

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Yes, Justice Souter.
Okay.

And -- and it was admitted and

14

then it was never challenged thereafter until after the

15

verdict.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

17

told us of your extensive experience.

18

numerosity requirement usually come up?

19

accepted that it's an element of your claim rather than

20

an affirmative defense the defendant must plead and

21

prove.

22

because defendant answers and asserts that it has fewer

23

than 15 employees?

24
25

How does it -- you -- you
How does the
You've

So how does it ordinarily come up?

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Does it --

I can give you one real-world

example, Justice Ginsburg.

I represented a defendant

13
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

in a case that didn't employ 15 people, and when I

2

attempted to convince the plaintiff -- plaintiff's

3

lawyer of that fact after the litigation commenced and

4

they weren't willing to -- to go ahead and voluntarily

5

dismiss, I simply filed a motion for summary judgment

6

attaching affidavit material, including payroll

7

records.

8

reviewed that, they voluntarily gave up and the case

9

was dismissed.

And then once the plaintiff's attorney

That would be the way it would normally

10

play out, provided it's not held to be an issue of

11

subject matter jurisdiction.

12

Another reason why this should not be a

13

subject matter jurisdiction goes to the practical

14

elements of the way this would progress in litigation

15

and title VII's admonition, which is a rare admonition

16

in legislation, that title VII cases be heard in an --

17

is in an expedited way.

18

language, it appears to me that Congress was

19

acknowledging that this is a very important law.

20

trying to remediate a terrible wrong, that is,

21

employment discrimination.

22

cases to languish.

23

processed like a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure

move very quickly.

And many courts, like the one across the

dockets, process these cases on a very fast track.

know that -- that court does it.

question of whether or not the person is an employer

I

Other courts that I

If this was to be subject matter

10

and putting aside all other issues in the case, it

11

would invariably result in a dragged-out process.

12

In our case, as we -- as we noted --

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's true in a lot

I think of admiralty.

If there's an issue

14

of areas.

15

of admiralty jurisdiction that questions whether an

16

injury is caused by a vessel in navigable water, you

17

often have extended litigation over that jurisdictional

18

question.

19

MR. SCHWARTZ:

And -- and in those cases, the

20

jurisdictional grant in the Jones Act does include

21

elements of jurisdiction.

22

So it's -- it's required.

But I don't -- I don't believe that the Jones

23

Act has the same type of language, Mr. Chief Justice,

24

that title VII has, requiring that these cases be heard

25

expeditiously.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Does it -- does it have to

be resolved preliminarily?

jurisdictional question to be decided at the conclusion

some rule of law that says that a jurisdictional

Why can't you leave the

Is there

Indeed, most jurisdictional questions are
reexamined as the trial proceeds.

That is, you know,

10

initially the court will say, yes, there appears to be

11

jurisdiction on the basis of the pleading.

12

there's a motion to dismiss, yes, there -- there

13

appears to be jurisdiction on the basis of the

14

affidavits.

15

turns out that, in fact, there isn't jurisdiction, the

court dismisses.

leave it to be resolved during the trial.

slow anything up.

There -- there's a few

21

problems with that.

22

title VII cases that there are supplemental State

claims brought in the cause of action, and so we would

effort on the pending claim if, at some point, Justice

Scalia, at the end of the day the case was dismissed on

2

subject matter jurisdiction.

had a pendant tort claim for battery, and we also had a

5

pendant claim under the ancillary Louisiana

6

discrimination statute.

7
8

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Okay.

So this is a third

consequence of the jurisdictional issue.
MR. SCHWARTZ:

Yes.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

If the issue is

11

jurisdictional, all the pendant State claims don't

12

belong there and they've got to be chucked out;

13

whereas, if it just goes to the merits, the pendant

14

claims are properly before the court.

15

MR. SCHWARTZ:

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

17
18

That's right, Your Honor.
That's an important

consequence.
MR. SCHWARTZ:

In addition, the Court's

19

recent opinions addressing subject matter jurisdiction

20

have all gone back, it seems to me, to this question of

21

what does the text say.

22

conflating the use of the word jurisdiction, which has

23

been referenced in a number of the Court's opinions,

24

Steel Company, Kontrick, Eberhart, Scarborough, all

25

point to the fact that where the text is clear, as it

under a Federal act.

If there's no further questions, I'd like

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DARYL JOSEFFER

10

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

11

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PLAINTIFF

12
13

MR. JOSEFFER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

14

Justice O'Connor, we think the rule here,

15

because it's a question of congressional intent, is

16

simply how to best interpret the relevant statutes.

17

Here, Congress twice unambiguously conferred

18

jurisdiction over all title VII claims, at least twice:

19

first in section 1331 and again in the title VII

20

jurisdictional provision which confers jurisdiction

21

over all claims brought under title VII.

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Joseffer, maybe you

23

can raise the podium a bit so the microphone works

24

better.

25

The other way.
MR. JOSEFFER:

Sorry.

Is that better?

Thank

1

you.

2

As I was saying, the question is -- is --

3

because it's a question of congressional intent, we

4

think normal rules of construction apply.

5

And, Justice Ginsburg, you asked about

6

whether the title VII subject matter jurisdictional

7

provision is now redundant in light of the reduction of

8

the amount of controversy from section 1331.

9

Technically we think the answer is yes, but it still

10

has great interpretive value because it shows that when

11

Congress meant to address the jurisdictional question

12

in title VII, it expressly said so and it did so by

13

conferring jurisdiction over all title VII claims.

14

The definition of employer, which is the

15

relevant issue here, does not itself speak in

16

jurisdictional terms and does not modify in any way

17

title VII's broad jurisdictional provision.

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What -- what about the

19

EEOC having typed the question jurisdictional for

20

administrative processing purposes?

21

MR. JOSEFFER:

Right.

Well, as the Court has

22

remarked on multiple occasions, the word jurisdiction

23

is a word of many, many meanings, and the EEOC has

24

never said that it's a question of the subject matter

25

jurisdiction of the Federal courts.

It was -- until

19
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

about 5 or 6 years ago, EEOC in an administrative

2

context used the word jurisdiction to refer to the

3

definition of employer, statutes of limitations, and a

4

variety of other matters that are clearly not subject

5

matter jurisdictional.

6

But after this Court held in Zipes that

7

another provision of title VII is not one of subject

8

matter jurisdiction, EEOC realized that its

9

administrative use of the broad term jurisdiction was

10

confusing.

11

compliance manual and no longer refers to any of these

12

questions as jurisdictional.

13

is it never said it was on subject matter jurisdiction.

14

So 5 or 6 years ago, EEOC amended its

But I guess the key point

And Mr. Chief Justice, you asked about

15

whether a threshold question of coverage could be

16

considered different than another element of the cause

17

of action.

18

the place where Congress used the term person is in

19

setting forth what conduct is unlawful.

20

that it shall be an unlawful employment practice for a

21

person to discriminate in various ways.

22

definition is irrelevant is in setting forth the scope

23

of unlawful conduct which is a quintessential merits or

24

cause of action inquiry as opposed to a jurisdictional

25

one.

I think the important thing here is that

Title VII says

So the way the

20
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

The City of Kenosha is different because, as

2

petitioner's counsel recognized, that interpreted not

3

section 1331 but section 1343 which --

4
5
6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Interpreted section

-- the use of the word person in section 1983.
MR. JOSEFFER:

Interpreted the word person in

7

section 1983 not to apply to municipal corporations,

8

but with respect to the jurisdictional inquiry, it said

9

that the -- that 1343 did not confer jurisdiction.

10

In Mt. Healthy several years later, the Court

11

held that although section 1343 was narrowly limited to

12

actions that are quote, authorized by law, which

13

connoted somewhat of a merits inquiry, section 1331's

14

jurisdictional provision is not so limited and is not

15

limited by the definition of person, which is what the

16

Court held in section 1331.

17
18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

was just kind of a silly waste of time.

19

MR. JOSEFFER:

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

21
22

So City of Kenosha

there as well.

Well -1331 was applicable

Right?

MR. JOSEFFER:

At the time section 1331 had

23

the amount in controversy requirement, and I think

24

that's why now that section 1331 no longer has the

25

amount in controversy requirement, this Court's section

21
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

1343 cases have more or less petered out because

2

plaintiffs can now just go under section 1331.

3

And Justice Scalia, you asked about the --

4

the practical consequences.

5

practical consequences, and from that perspective, it

6

makes little sense to believe that Congress would have

7

thought that this requirement should be jurisdictional.

8
9

I agree there are three

The first is whether the issue can be raised at any
point in the litigation.

The second is who decides the

10

issue, and the third is whether, after dismissal of the

11

Federal claims, the State law claims must be dismissed

12

for lack of jurisdiction.

13

And given that this is just one of many facts

14

that arises in determining whether a plaintiff can

15

state a valid title VII claim, it's hard to believe

16

that Congress would have thought that this is the one

17

fact that should be raised at the end of the case

18

instead of at the outset where it can be adjudicated in

19

an orderly manner with all of the other facts.

20

Also, common law juries have been deciding

21

for centuries whether a worker is an employee or an

22

independent contractor for purposes of agency and tort

23

law.

24

seems remarkable to think that that's the one fact that

25

Congress would say should not go to a jury.

And since that is the ultimate dispute here, it

22
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

And similarly --

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

3
4
5

I'm sorry.

What have

juries been determining?
MR. JOSEFFER:

Well, the question as to

whether there are 15 employees here --

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

7

MR. JOSEFFER:

Right.

-- turns on whether some

8

workers are independent contractors or employees.

9

for agency law purposes, which becomes relevant in tort

10

law in terms of vicarious liability, the question

11

whether someone is an employee or an independent

12

contractor is a -- is a longstanding jury question.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And

The -- the question was

14

whether the truck drivers counted as employees because

15

if they did, they'd have enough?

16

MR. JOSEFFER:

Right.

If the -- if the -- if

17

those -- if the delivery drivers were workers -- were

18

employees, there's no question there were 15 employees.

19

So the question was whether some workers count as

20

employees and whether a worker is an employee or an

21

independent contractor is -- is a longstanding question

22

for a jury when there's a disputed issue of -- of fact.

23

And then the third consequence -- I mean,

24

here, there -- the jury rendered a verdict on the State

25

law claims, found in favor of respondent on one,

23
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

petitioner on the other.

2

that Congress would think that that jury verdict should

3

be vacated and the case retried in State court because

4

the defendant has 14 instead of 15 employees.

5

And it seems highly unlikely

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But that's the --

6

that's a consequence of a determination that it's

7

jurisdictional in any case.

8
9

MR. JOSEFFER:

Right?

That's correct, and there --

there are circumstances --

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I mean, if you had a

11

case where you didn't dispute that the issue was

12

jurisdictional and there had been a jury trial on the

13

pendant State law claims, we'd still have to throw that

14

out.

15

Right?
MR. JOSEFFER:

Yes, but I think that's one

16

reason that Congress does not ordinarily make

17

jurisdiction turn on those types of facts.

18

admiralty concept -- context that you recognized, it's

19

necessary to distinguish between admiralty jurisdiction

20

and general Federal question jurisdiction.

21

had to distinguish in some way, and the way it did was

22

by saying, well, is the alleged injury caused by a

23

vessel in navigable waters or elsewhere.

24
25

In the

So Congress

But ordinarily when -- a distinction does not
have to be drawn like that.

In section 1343, it was

24
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

the same because Congress didn't want that to be

2

conflated with section 1331 at the time.

3

jurisdiction does not necessarily turn on contextual

4

factors, Congress ordinarily just lets the broad

5

jurisdictional ground of section 1331 be a clear,

6

simple threshold inquiry so parties can determine

7

they're in the right court, and then the case can be

8

proceeded -- can be litigated on the merits from there.

When

9

Justice Kennedy asked whether a court could

10

raise the issue on its own, even assuming that it's a

11

merits issue.

12

the defendant waived the issue here and therefore has

13

no right to insist that it be raised, most waiver

14

doctrines are discretionary, and therefore, courts

15

retain some inherent discretion to overlook waivers in

16

some circumstances.

17

at the outset of a case where a Federal court decided

18

it should not be deciding a case than it would be once

19

a jury had already decided the case, which is what

20

happened here.

21

And I think the answer is that although

That discretion would be greater

Finally, respondent relies on a number of

22

this Court's title VII decisions for the proposition

23

that this requirement is one of subject matter

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRETT D. PRENDERGAST

19

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

20
21
22
23

MR. PRENDERGAST:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it

please the Court:
I have to start off by disagreeing with my
learned colleagues on at least three areas.

24

First of all, Mr. Schwartz indicated that the

25

plaintiff pled that the defendant Y & H was an employer

26
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

in this matter.

2

defendant actually pled and which became the subject of

3

the subsequent post-trial motions was that the court

4

had jurisdiction, and when the matter of the number of

5

employees was raised, that was the pleading -- the

6

allegation in the complaint that the plaintiff raised

7

to say this issue has been waived.

8

specific pleading in the complaint that said that Y & H

9

qualified for the definition of an employer under title

That is inaccurate.

What the

There was no

10

VII.

11

employees for the 20 or more weeks that were necessary.

There was no pleading that Y & H had 15 or more

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There was no -- there was

13

no allegation that the plaintiff was employed by your

14

client?

15

MR. PRENDERGAST:

There was an allegation,

16

Your Honor, that the plaintiff was employed by the

17

company, but there was no allegation that Y & H was an

18

employer as the term is defined in title VII.

19

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

21
22

Was the --

Was the word employer used

in the pleadings?
MR. PRENDERGAST:

I don't recall, Your Honor,

whether or not the word employer was used.

24

was clearly stated that -- and -- and there's no doubt

Ms. Arbaugh was, in fact, employed by Y & H.

MR. PRENDERGAST:

Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Was there an allegation that

11

the company, petitioner, or whatever it was -- that

12

they violated the act?

13
14
15

MR. PRENDERGAST:

There was an allegation,

Your Honor, that -JUSTICE BREYER:

All right -- I guess that --

16

they must have thought that there were 15 or more

17

employees because otherwise you wouldn't have.

18
19
20

MR. PRENDERGAST:

Right.

And -- and

naturally, though, Your Honor, that was denied.
The -- the admission that the plaintiff

21

relied upon in the post-trial motions was the

22

allegation that this Court has jurisdiction under title

23

VII, under the relevant provision.

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

MR. PRENDERGAST:

Was that denied?
That was admitted.

The

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1

jurisdiction was admitted, and -- and in the post-trial

2

motions, that was the issue that the plaintiff hung

3

their hat on to come back and say this issue is -- is

4

established and stipulated.

5

admission that the --

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

There was clearly no

You denied it.

7

presented evidence, and their evidence was A, B, C, D,

wasn't an employer.

So I guess the odds are he was.

11

MR. PRENDERGAST:

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

13
14

Well, there was -- but -And if the odds are he was,

they win in the absence of any evidence.
MR. PRENDERGAST:

Justice Breyer, if an

15

employer -- and -- and I disagree with the position

16

that it's -- I -- I think it is an element of the

17

merits in addition to being an element of jurisdiction.

18

But if a plaintiff has that as part of their burden of

19

proof, then the plaintiff naturally has to introduce

20

evidence --

21
22

JUSTICE BREYER:

Then I guess maybe you could

have appealed on that point.

23

MR. PRENDERGAST:

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

So did you?
No, Your Honor, because --

Then I guess it's waived

unless it's jurisdictional.

So we're back to the

it is jurisdictional.

whether or not there is, in fact, any waiver because --

I'm not sure, Your Honor,

JUSTICE BREYER:

I never heard of a point on

6

the merits that if you -- you think you're right.

7

right on the merits, the element of the offense.

8

don't think they proved it, but unfortunately, you

9

don't raise that in the appeal.

10

MR. PRENDERGAST:

It's
You

No, Your Honor, we didn't

11

raise it in the appeal, the reason being that while the

12

matter was still pending in the trial court, in

13

addition to the motion to dismiss for jurisdiction,

14

which was granted, there was a motion for a renewed

15

judgment as a matter of law, which included the

16

plaintiff's failure to maintain their burden of proof.

17
18

JUSTICE BREYER:

And did you win or lose on

that?

19

MR. PRENDERGAST:

That was dismissed as moot

20

because of the jurisdictional issue, Your Honor.

21

whether or not that is waived or not -- I agree with

22

you.

23

think it's a matter that can be decided by this Court

24

either.

25

that it is a merits issue, that goes back to the trial

MR. PRENDERGAST:

What other aspects of

I think the other aspects

5

-- and clearly, this has not been the subject of as

6

great a research -- would be the other ones that

7

designate the scope or the coverage of the act, for

8

example, especially as it relates to employer.

9

At least three circuit -- and in addition to

10

excluding small companies as employers, the act also

11

includes as -- excludes as employers private membership

12

clubs, the Government, the United States, agencies of

13

the United States, wholly owned corporations of the

14

United States, and also Indian tribes.

15

circuit courts have held that Indian tribes and their

16

status is a matter of subject matter jurisdiction.

17

Tenth Circuit in Duke v. Absentee Shawnee Tribe, and

some of the structures and just the business

9

organizations that the Indian tribes were using and --

10

Instead, what they

There was a question concerning

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Do you interpret those

11

cases as, in fact, holding that if there was a trial

12

and a judgment in favor of the plaintiff against what

13

turns out later to be an Indian tribe, that after the

14

case is taken up on appeal, the Indian tribe can have

15

the judgment set aside?

16

MR. PRENDERGAST:

Yes, Your Honor, because

17

the -- the cases did clearly hold that the matter of --

18

as an Indian tribe was a matter of subject matter

19

jurisdiction.

20

jurisdiction, it is completely established law that

21

that may not be waived.

22
23

And as a matter of subject matter

It may be raised at any time.

So -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Did it, in fact, come up

24

in that posture in the case?

tribe cases as it did here after the case was fully

tried and after there was a jury verdict for the

4

plaintiff?

Did it -- did the question come up in the Indian

5

MR. PRENDERGAST:

No, Your Honor.

Those were

6

cases where there were motions to dismiss based upon

7

lack of subject matter jurisdiction.

8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

When -- if -- if it's

9

brought up promptly, it really doesn't matter, does it,

10

whether you label it 12(b)(1) jurisdiction or 12(b)(6),

11

failure to state a claim?

12

When it is consequential is when you bring it up, as

13

you did here, after you lose on -- at the trial.

It goes out either way.

14

MR. PRENDERGAST:

15

could be different when you raise it.

16

can also be a difference in effect in how it will be

17

treated, even if it was promptly raised.

18

example, on a 12(b)(1) motion, I don't believe the --

19

the court is obligated to accept all the plaintiff's

20

pleadings.

21

to actually determine the jurisdiction.

your -- your contention is that I don't know how it is

that you -- that you intuit that this one definition is

employer in section 701.

I mean, the definition -- the -- the

7

MR. PRENDERGAST:

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

Yes, Your Honor.
There are 13 other

definitions in section 1701.

For example, it defines

10

on the basis of sex.

11

a particular remark or a particular practice of the

12

employer was -- fell within that definition, was on the

13

basis of sex or not, would you say that the court had

14

no jurisdiction?

Now, if -- if you contest whether

MR. PRENDERGAST:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, Your Honor.
Will you challenge -- well,

17

why are you challenging jurisdiction when you're --

consequences of affirming here are severe in terms of

handling these cases.

recent cases of ours that we've been a little sloppy in

5

the past in using the word jurisdiction.

6

to me like there are many indicators that would point

7

to not treating the 15 employee requirement as one of

8

subject matter jurisdiction.

And we've pointed out in some

MR. PRENDERGAST:

of the concerns, I believe, that Congress did have with

I think -It would make the

MR. PRENDERGAST:

I think that would be

contrary, however, Mr. Chief Justice, to the previous

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

MR. PRENDERGAST:

-- and you look to all the

statutes.

but if -- if the jurisdictional statute is going to be

24

discussion, then Zipes would have merely looked and

So I think to say just, okay, let's look at
the jurisdictional statute -- one, I think there are
two problems with it.

One --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

May I go back to Zipes?

12

In Zipes, the Court was faced with the -- the word

13

jurisdictional had been appended to the statute of

14

limitations.

15

spoke of the rigid time limit, that it was mandatory

16

and jurisdictional.

17

Zipes that a strict time line doesn't mean that it's

18

jurisdictional.

19

it doesn't determine subject matter jurisdiction.

20

that's what Zipes tried to explain.

21

was faced with a number of cases that had used that

22

term to describe the time in which you must bring the

23

action, mandatory and jurisdictional.

24

MR. PRENDERGAST:

25

I think that was true of the way the EEOC

And then the Court explained in

You can have a rule that's rigid, but
And

The Court in Zipes

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

But

Zipes also dealt with a legislative history where they

38
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

referred to it as a statute of limitations period.

2

Zipes also said, okay, we have other cases where we

3

have used the term jurisdictional, but more often than

4

not, we've referred to this as a limitations period.

5

Zipes looked at the whole context and said, yes, we're

6

not going to be held by a few random, maybe casual or

7

careless uses of the term jurisdictional, but we are

8

going to look at the whole thing.

9

Here, the legislative history has

10

traditionally referred to this as a jurisdictional

11

provision.

12

decrease the number of employees necessary from 25 to

13

15, referred to it as an expansion of jurisdiction.

14

This Court has had the matter come up before it always

15

in jurisdictional terms.

16

this.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes, but now we know it's

-- EEOC has changed.

19
20

This Court has referred to

EEOC has referred to it as jurisdictional.

17
18

The '72 amendments, which increase --

MR. PRENDERGAST:

Seeing the errors of their

ways, I guess.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But why -- now that we do

22

have Zipes, why should the number of employees be

23

treated any differently than that rigid time line in --

24

in Zipes?

25

MR. PRENDERGAST:

Your Honor, I think the

39
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

reason that the number of employees should be different

2

-- treated differently is because we go back to the

3

Aldinger question, and the Aldinger question is this

4

Court has to decide did Congress want to give this type

5

of jurisdiction to the lower Federal courts.

6
7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:
jurisdiction case.

But that was a pendant

Wasn't Aldinger --

8

MR. PRENDERGAST:

9

pendant party issue, yes, Your Honor.

Aldinger dealt with a

10

Kenosha, however, dealt with -- as the Chief

11

Justice has indicated, Kenosha dealt with a definition

12

that excluded counties from section 1983 and that was

13

found to be implicitly brought into the -- the

14

jurisdictional grant for civil rights actions.

15

So I think the mere fact that something is or

16

is not in the jurisdictional statute cannot be

17

determinative because ultimately you do need to go back

18

to the question of did Congress want to give this type

19

of jurisdiction to the lower Federal courts.

20

My question would be why would Congress seek

21

to give this type of jurisdiction to the lower Federal

22

courts for a whole category of cases where, in the

23

words of this Court in Hishon, it has granted these

24

businesses complete immunity from title VII?

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, you just used an

40
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

interesting word because there are litigants who can

2

claim complete immunity from liability, but that

3

immunity, whether it's absolute or qualified, doesn't

4

go to the court's subject matter jurisdiction.

5

to be raised in those cases as a defense.

6

MR. PRENDERGAST:

It has

True, Justice Ginsburg.

7

The difference, however, between the immunity in those

8

cases and the type of immunity here that the Court

9

talked about in Hishon -- immunity for a police officer

10

in a civil rights case with qualified immunity will

11

depend upon a police officer's particular actions in

12

that particular case.

13

can be sued under section 1983.

14

The police officer, in general,

The immunity that's present here, with

15

respect to small employers, has no relationship

16

whatsoever to the actions of that employer.

17

employer who employs 12 people at most can engage in

18

the most egregious employment discrimination and

19

harassment possible, and the Congress of the United

20

States has said, as a policy matter, on balance we

21

would rather accept that kind of awful conduct because

22

we don't want to impose these burdens on small

23

businesses.

4

the operations -- into the culture of these small

6

between the immunity that you mentioned, the qualified

or prosecutorial type immunity, which depends upon

8

actions, and this immunity here which depends upon

9

simply the status of the defendant, the whole class --

10

JUSTICE SOUTER:

doesn't apply to absolute immunity cases, and yet in

15

There's simply immunity.

4

MR. PRENDERGAST:

It certainly -- yes, Your

Honor, I will concede it's a different kind of inquiry.
But I -- I do think, though, here the categorical

5

exclusion of small businesses is a clear indication of

6

congressional intent of what Congress wanted to have

7

happen.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But I -- I don't see why the

same argument can't be made with respect to

10

prosecutors.

11

is acting in a prosecutorial capacity and enjoys the

12

appointment as a prosecutor, that at least the -- the

13

system -- we're not necessarily talking about Congress

14

here.

15

categorical matter, an -- an immunity from prosecution.

16

It is clear that if -- if an individual

The system says there -- there should be, as a

And yet, that does not go to subject matter

17

jurisdiction.

18

essentially the exact argument that you're making here,

19

and I don't see why it should be any more sound here

20

than it would be in the absolute immunity case.

21

And it seems to me that that is

MR. PRENDERGAST:

Another -- well, Your

22

Honor, I'll offer another distinction then.

23

distinction is prosecutorial immunity and qualified

24

immunity, for that matter, are court-created entities

JUSTICE SOUTER:

2

MR. PRENDERGAST:

3

That's right.
-- court-created defenses.

And as this Court is well aware, this Court nor any

4

other court has the power to define subject matter

5

jurisdiction.

6

Only Congress can limit the court's jurisdiction and

7

define the court's jurisdiction for the lower Federal

8

courts.

9

That is Congress' purview and power.

Here, Congress has spoken with respect to

10

small businesses.

11

suggest, with respect to prosecutors, which is an

12

immunity that is -- is a product of common law and --

13

and a judicial creation.

14

It's a different matter, I would

I would also want to point out that --

15

another thing.

16

you look at the structure of the -- the liability

17

section, he implied that it just imposes the employer

18

definition into the -- all the other causes of action.

19

The Solicitor General indicated that if

In fact, it does not.

It says, it -- it shall be

20

unlawful for an employer to, and then it defines what

21

is unlawful.

22

difference between other elements of the cause of

23

action and the employer relationship and the employer

24

existence under title VII.

25

So I think there again it's indicating a

Ultimately, what this boils down to is

44
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

whether or not small businesses are going to continue

2

to receive the protection that Congress has indicated

3

that it wanted them to have.

4

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, why can't get they get

the protections through summary judgment?
MR. PRENDERGAST:

I think they would be

7

offered some level of protection, Justice Souter,

8

through summary judgment.

9

judgment offers its own unique hurdles to a defendant.

10
11
12
13

The problem is summary

And again, it's a difference -JUSTICE SOUTER:

Among other things, you --

you've got to do it up front.
MR. PRENDERGAST:

It's -- it's a different

14

standard as well, Your Honor, because under summary

15

judgment, a plaintiff has it within their capability --

16

have to view all the inferences in the light most

17

favorable to the plaintiff, and -- and the small

18

business could end up being dragged into the litigation

19

further and further than I think Congress intended.

20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, if -- if we're worried

21

about dragging people into litigation, I presume

22

Congress didn't intend, as a -- as a general matter, to

23

allow the -- the situation that we've got here.

24

25

2

that was within the contemplation of Congress' intent.

3

MR. PRENDERGAST:

Surely you can't say

Your Honor, actually I -- I

4

would not have viewed it as outside of Congress'

5

contemplation or intent because Congress -- and I think

6

this is an important part of legislative history.

7

Congress in 1990 enacted the ADA, and they adopted the

8

employer definition from title VII.

9

that Congress adopted title VII's employer definition

And at the time

10

for the ADA, all but one circuit court had decided that

11

this was a matter of subject matter jurisdiction.

12

if you decide something is a matter of subject matter

13

jurisdiction, you take with it the unfairness.

parties, some of the consequences of subject matter

MR. PRENDERGAST:

JUSTICE SOUTER:

5

Congress in some specific sense, when it establishes a

6

jurisdictional requirement, does not intend the

7

occasional costs that the system has to bear by virtue

8

of treating that requirement as jurisdictional.

9

My point simply is that if we are in -- in a

10

situation in which it is not clear whether it's

11

jurisdictional or not, and the issue can be raised, in

12

effect, up front effectively through summary judgment,

13

and in the alternative, can be treated -- and -- as --

14

as an ineffective fact element, and in the alternative,

15

can be left, in effect, forever to be raised as a

16

jurisdictional element.

17

treated effectively up front is one reason to think

18

that Congress would probably have wanted that fact

19

issue to be regarded not as jurisdictional but as

20

elemental so that it can be gotten out of the way and

the parties are not going to go through entire trials

only to have the whole thing upset by a belated

I think the

10

importance of -- of categorizing this as subject matter

11

jurisdiction is to avoid -- among other things, is

adding another complicating factor to a jury trial

13

because, if you make this a matter of the merits now --

14

counsel for petitioner describes in his brief extended

15

hearings to determine the number of employees.

16

now -- if you make it part -- just a part of the

17

merits, now before you can get to the actual issue of

18

discrimination, a jury is going to have to sit through

19

and try to decide how many employees there were.

the Fifth Circuit law to determine whether or not

somebody is an independent contractor or an employee,

that seems to me to be more like the function of a

judge than a jury because it's a matter of balancing of

the relevant factors.

MR. SCHWARTZ:

If there are no additional

questions, I -- I have nothing further.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Do you think -- do you think

19

it's possible that -- that Indian tribes could be

jurisdictional but an employer couldn't?

seems to me the two the questions are quite different.

MR. SCHWARTZ:

But the -- I could -- in

answer to that question, I can see an interesting

scenario where a plaintiff working for a casino on an
