ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL F. STRAIN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. STRAIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
We are here about a bankruptcy priority, and

12

bankruptcy priorities must be clearly granted by

13

statute or they are not granted at all.

14

first principle of bankruptcy law that this Court has

15

laid down, that equal priority, that equal distribution

16

is the first principle, and every priority is a

17

deviation from that first principle, and therefore,

18

they must be clearly set out in the statute.

19

Court has been very clear over and over on those

20

bedrock principles.

21

That's the

This

Applying them here, Zurich must demonstrate

22

that its workers' comp insurance policy receivables are

23

clearly included within the statutory phrase of

24

507(a)(4), contributions to an employee benefit plan

25

arising from services rendered within 180 days.

MR. STRAIN:

The strongest authority for

12

that, Your Honor, is the opinion in Kothe, K-o-t-h-e, a

14

Embassy Restaurant, and it is the --

20

out in the majority opinion, Mr. Chief Justice.

21

Nathanson majority opinion relied on Kothe, and

22

Nathanson majority opinion was followed in 1959 by this

23

Court in Embassy Restaurants, and followed in 1968 by

24

this Court in Joint Industries Board also dealing with

25

bankruptcy priorities.

The principle is laid

And what we have here, Your Honor and members

of the Court, is that a -- an insurance policy -- what

We don't even have a plan here.

Now, that is what our case is, an insurance

2

policy that incorporates a duty to pay benefits subject

3

to workers' comp laws of the different States.

4

under the citation in -- the full citation in Pegram,

5

it is seriously questionable whether this insurance

policy is a plan at all.

7

employee benefit plan.

8

it be clear from the statute that this insurance policy

9

is itself a plan.

10

So even

The statute requires an

The -- this Court requires that

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Now, ERISA -- ERISA makes it

11

very clear that -- that a plan to pay insurance for

12

employee benefits, whether it's disability or

13

retirement or whatever else, is an employee benefit

14

plan and -- and explicitly excludes workmen's comp

15

because otherwise it would fall within that definition

16

of an employee benefit plan.

17
18

MR. STRAIN:

I believe that is -- is correct,

Justice Scalia.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I know that's a different

20

statute.

21

definitions of that statute have to apply here, but the

22

definitions of that statute at least demonstrate that

23

it is a permissible use of the -- of -- of the term

24

employee benefit plan.

25

I'm not saying that the -- that the

MR. STRAIN:

I disagree with you, Justice

1

Scalia --

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

3

MR. STRAIN:

All right.

Tell me why.

-- to this -- to this extent.

4

The definition of employee benefit plan under ERISA is

5

in two parts:

6

listing; and a section (b), which is incorporation of

7

provisions of the Taft-Hartley law.

8

section (b), the incorporation of provisions of the

9

Taft-Hartley law, that workers' compensation comes in.

10
11

a section (a), which is a -- which is a

And it's under the

And, of course it is then excluded by -- by ERISA.
But a -- the ERISA definition does not

12

demonstrate that a -- an insurance policy is a plan.

13

This Court has dealt with the issue under ERISA of

14

whether everything scheduled in ERISA is a plan or not.

15

In the Massachusetts v. Morash decision, this Court

16

determined whether a vacation -- unpaid vacation policy

17

was a plan under the definition of ERISA, and this

18

Court held that it was not.

19

Court's precedent that whether or not something is

20

listed in ERISA, even if it applied -- in that case,

21

ERISA applied; in this case it does not -- even if it

22

applied, would not qualify as a plan.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So it is clear from this

Would it -- would it if

24

the employer were self-insured?

insured for workers' comp?

MR. STRAIN:

The employer can be self-insured

for workers' --

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

4

MR. STRAIN:

Would that be a plan then?

I think it would not, Your

5

Honor, because the self-insurance for workers' comp, as

6

I understand them, what they normally do is, just as

7

the Court referred to in that omitted section of the

8

Pegram opinion, is it simply is -- is an agreement that

9

it will provide the necessary wherewithal and bonding

10

to pay the benefits as specified, as they may change

11

from time to time in a State statute.

12

the other things, as I understand it, that the Court

13

dealt with in Pegram which would make it a plan that

14

are present in either a workers' compensation insurance

15

policy or a self-insurance program, as is permitted and

16

--

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So it would be an employee

benefit program, but not a plan.

19

MR. STRAIN:

21

There is none of

It would be, Your Honor, or in

the case of our case, an employee benefit policy.
And I would like to pick up on that, if I

22

may, because it is not --

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Before you -- before you go

24

on, could you satisfy a curiosity of mine?

25

Verrilli should be the one I should ask this, but you

Maybe Mr.

8
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

must have your -- your version of it.

2

decide whether an insurance premium is for work that

3

was done within the last 180 days?

4

calculate it, whether that characteristic of the -- of

5

the statute is complied with?

6

MR. STRAIN:

How do you

How -- how do you

Your Honor, I don't know that

7

there is any good way to do that, and I think that's

8

one of the anomalies in trying to superimpose an

9

insurance policy under the rubric of an employee

10
11
12
13
14
15
16
17

benefit plan.
Now, premiums -- premiums, of course, there
is a -- there is a mechanism -JUSTICE SCALIA:

Oh, if it said premiums due

within the last 180 days, I could understand it -MR. STRAIN:

And there is a mechanism in the

policy to determine the payment of premiums.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

But isn't -- doesn't the

18

mechanism take into account the number of employees who

19

are on the rolls at any given time?

20

MR. STRAIN:

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I believe it does, Your Honor.
Well, if that's the case,

22

then -- then doesn't the premium that you're supposed

23

to pay depend in -- in -- on the number of employees

24

within the last 180 days, which in turn depends on

25

their working in the last 180 days?

1

MR. STRAIN:

It is not my understanding -- and I

2

may be mistaken because this policy was not placed in

3

the record by Zurich.

4

that is how the policy premium calculations are made,

5

Your Honor.

6
7

Now --

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, how -- maybe you just

don't know the answer.

8
9

It is not my understanding that

MR. STRAIN:

-- certainly, Justice Souter,

you may be right, but we've checked the proof of claim

10

filed by Zurich which started this off, and they did

11

not attach the workers' compensation insurance policy

12

to it.

13

know --

14
15

So it is not in the record, and I simply don't

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So that's -- that's really

not an issue for us.

16

MR. STRAIN:

17

it's not an issue, Your Honor.

18

--

19

Well, I -- I will not say that

JUSTICE SOUTER:

It is -- it is an issue

Well, if you want to make it

20

an issue, you'd have to get the -- the predicate in the

21

record to do it, and -- and we just don't have that.

22

MR. STRAIN:

23

JUSTICE SOUTER:

We -- we couldn't resolve

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Or else establish that

24
25

Well --

that.

10
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

there's no conceivable way that 180 days makes any

2

sense.

3

MR. STRAIN:

And -- and I -- I think that, as

4

-- as I hope may blend the answers to both questions.

5

I think that --

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Consider us together, yes.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

We're together on this.

8

(Laughter.)

9

MR. STRAIN:

I -- I think that is -- I think

10

that is where we -- where we are.

11

that was not placed in the record by the applicant for

12

this priority.

13

workers' comp insurance policies are.

14

15

180 days, which I suggest is an anomaly when we compare

16

it to the statutory language.

17

We have a policy

We have our general knowledge of what

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

We have a

Is there anything in the

18

statute which says how promptly the premiums have to be

19

paid as it -- to -- to make it analogous, say, to

20

withholding where you might have to pay every quarter

21

on -- by a certain day?

22

regulate when and how promptly the premiums must be

23

paid, or is that just all comprehended in the terms of

24

the policy agreement?

25

MR. STRAIN:

Does -- does the statute

doesn't --

No.

I meant the State

workmen's comp law.

5

MR. STRAIN:

The State workers' -- workers'

6

comp law.

7

know that the State laws -- I know that the State laws

8

vary, and we have 10 different workers' comp laws that

9

allude to or mention workers' comp insurance policies

Your Honor, I -- I don't know the answer.

10

present just in this case.

11

statutes might provide some of the basis for an

12

explanation, but I simply don't know the answer to

13

that.

So it may be that those

I did want to --

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

If you have an employer who

15

says, I promise to give $200 a month per worker to a

16

fund, which money will go to pay their health costs

17

when they're sick, that's plainly covered.

18

MR. STRAIN:

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, it is, Your Honor.
And now suppose it's exactly

20

the same, but instead of his paying $200 a month, he

21

pays $200 to an insurance company in return for a

22

promise that they'll pay precisely the same amount to

23

the employee if he gets sick.

covered.

hypothetical you pose is not quite our case.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Of course.

It's not meant

to be.

MR. STRAIN:

JUSTICE BREYER:

It -- it -I want to know how you are

7

going to answer my hypothetical.

8

(Laughter.)

9

MR. STRAIN:

Your Honor, I -- I think the --

10

the focus of the answer should be on whether it is an

11

employee benefit or not.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. STRAIN:

Yes.

MR. STRAIN:

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. STRAIN:

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, no.

No, I --

Then what is the answer?

-- I understand it, Your Honor.
In your view, is my

hypothetical covered or not?

21
22

-- to answer my hypothetical

If in fact -- you didn't want me to repeat it?

16

20

I'm not -- I'm asking you --

MR. STRAIN:

I -- I think it is not, Your

Honor.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

24

MR. STRAIN:

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

It is not.

I think -And therefore, if we accept

13
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

your interpretation, then all those employers who,

2

instead of contributing directly to health funds,

3

instead buy insurance policies to do the same thing,

4

will discover they do not have the advantage of the

5

fifth priority.

6

MR. STRAIN:

All right.

And now I see -- now

7

I see, Justice Breyer, I did misunderstand --

8

misunderstand the facts.

9

covered.

10

Those facts clearly are

They're -- they're covered under -JUSTICE BREYER:

Now, if they are covered --

11

if they are covered, as I thought, then what is the

12

difference whether the employer buys a policy whereby

13

the insurance companies pays for their health benefit

14

when they're sick or pays for their accident benefit

15

when they have an accident at work?

16

MR. STRAIN:

Your Honor, I think the

17

difference are -- are several.

18

employer is doing here is insuring itself against a

19

claim that would otherwise be against the insurer.

20

That was not in your hypothetical, Your Honor.

21

makes what we have here a policy for an employer

22

benefit.

Number one is what the

That

It is not an employee benefit.

23

Now, the -- the employer is the insured.

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

The -- the correlative

hypothetical would be a plan such as Justice Breyer

14
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

describes in which the employer has contracted to pay

2

his employees $200 a month for when they're sick, and

3

that's a contractual obligation of his, and then he

4

buys insurance to cover that contractual obligation.

5

MR. STRAIN:

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

7

MR. STRAIN:

That would be this case, Your

Honor.

10
11

You say that would be this

case.

8
9

And --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And you say that wouldn't be

covered.

12

MR. STRAIN:

And that would not be covered,

13

and that would not be covered in great part because it

14

is an employer benefit, employer choice, employer

15

benefit.

16

And what we have in this case -JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, that's -- that's a

17

better way to put it.

18

you're saying, as I understand it, is in those cases

19

where an employer goes to an insurance company, they

20

give a contractual promise to pay the employee when he

21

gets sick in return for a premium by the employer --

22

and it's a health benefit or a vacation benefit, the

23

most typical thing -- you're saying all those -- all

24

those -- there's no fifth priority.

25

can't take advantage of that.

If -- if that's right, then what

I'm saying is and what we have here, if what you're

describing, if I understand it correctly, is a normal

fringe benefit.

out a -- to contribute to a pension fund for the

6

benefit of the employees.

That was the kind of thing dealt with in Embassy

was intended to supplant or overrule.

because, as Justice Scalia changed the hypothetical, it

was not an employee benefit.

here, insuring itself, so it -- so it could make the

position whether there is insurance or no insurance.

2

In fact, the irony here is that if Zurich prevails, not

only do the employees not benefit, they are harmed

Zurich is not.

9

But what happens -- and there's not enough

10

money to pay everyone.

11

Insurance Company receivable gets an equal priority

12

with the health and welfare funds, then there is a

13

dilution of the money going for the employees' health

money in the till for the plan, isn't there a

Government fund so that the worker would receive the

12

benefit in any event if -- I don't see the distinction

that you're making based on whether the worker would

get a benefit whether or not the employer made the

contribution.

MR. STRAIN:

Well, Your Honor, there

certainly is -- there certainly are -- in most States

at least, there certainly are funds that step in if a

injured -- a worker who was injured on the job.

On the other -- on the other hand, Your

Honor, whether such funds exist to step in and supplant

And is there any

requirement that there be an actual fund in place or is
it just a general liability?
MR. STRAIN:

Well, there is -- there is -- it

is a -- a traditional self-insurance with the overlay.
That is, there -- there must -- there must be a

14

showing of the wherewithal, but with the additional

15

overlay, in all or virtually every State which permits

16

this, of the requirement of a bond.

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

18

MR. STRAIN:

And that's --

A bond.

-- which is an interesting point

19

because if Zurich prevails, we have the -- the camel's

20

nose is under the tent because in all the self-

21

insurance contexts, the bond issuer will have an

22

equivalent claim to Zurich.

23

reasoning or broad interpretation of the statute that

24

should be considered narrowly -- under the broad

interpretation they want, that camel's nose would be

under the tent, and the bond issuer would have an

2

equivalent claim to Zurich on its policy.

3

To extend that a little further, what Zurich

4

did here -- was an insurance company -- it required

5

letters of credit of Howard Delivery, the debtor, to

6

issue its policies.

9

not enough.

10
11

It drew down those letters of
F&M Bank, the letter of credit

As is commonly the situation once the

liquidation is finished, there wasn't enough security.
So F&M, which had facilitated Zurich's workers'

12

compensation insurance by its letters -- letters of

13

credit, would have an equivalent claim to Zurich as

14

well.

So more and more of the camel is going under the

15

tent.

This is a very broad interpretation with major

16

implications that they seek and it is completely

17

inappropriate under the bedrock principles of

18

approaches to priorities under bankruptcy law.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

-- in -- in your brief,

5

you seem to put considerable stress on something that I

is that these -- workers' compensation is State-

13

I'll take this opportunity to mention it, Justice

15

We know that in the statute -- (a)(4) we're

talking about -- section (a)(3) -- these are numberings

But there are two that work together.

There -- there was that discussion in your brief, and

1

absolutely clear, Your Honor, that the fact of the

2

judicial -- the statutory mandate for workers'

3

compensation insurance is very important because what

4

is spoken about, as Judge Niemeyer pointed out in his

5

dissent below -- what is spoken about in the

6

legislative history over and over again is a wage

7

substitute or a wage surrogate that employers do not

8

give -- will lower the wages but provide fringe

9

benefits.

So the package remains the same.

Now,

10

that's not a workers' compensation insurance policy,

11

but that is the wage surrogates that the Congress was

12

looking at.

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Let -- let me, if I may, ask

14

you about other possible wage surrogates because what

15

you're saying now seems to me to mesh with the

16

argument, another legislative history argument, to the

17

effect that the -- the current provision was meant to

18

overrule two prior cases of this Court.

19

question I have turns on the fact that the -- the

20

language is broader than what would merely have been

21

necessary to overrule those cases.

22

And the -- the

So my question is if the broader language

23

does not cover the premiums that we're concerned with

substitutes would it pick up, would it include?

MR. VERRILLI:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

I think it's important to focus at the outset
on exactly what a workers' compensation plan provides.
A workers' compensation plan provides health insurance
that pays for the medical costs of a workplace

You're begging the question

Well, I'd be happy to go right

to the question of whether it's a plan, Justice Scalia,

under the dictionary definition, ordinary meaning of

19

plan, this Court's interpretation of it in Pegram,

20

under ERISA, under the Department of Labor's

interpretation of it, and under plain common sense.

22

plan is an arrangement or program or scheme, as Pegram

said, to -- established by an employer or an employee

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Verrilli, there's no

planning.

The planning is all done by the Government

MR. VERRILLI:

-- because what's covered

is prescribed by law.

8

See, I -- I --

MR. VERRILLI:

I think there is a plan for

this reason, Justice Ginsburg.

The -- what the law

10

prescribes is that which the employer must provide to

11

the employees.

12

The -- the employer has got to make arrangements to

13

ensure that the benefits are provided, and under the

14

laws of the vast majority of the States, the employer

15

has options for doing that.

16

with an insurance company to do it.

self-insure to do it.

18

there are quite stringent requirements for fiscal

solvency and there is a surety bond that needs to be

posted in order to -- in order to self-insure.

Here, the law determines what the benefits will

MR. VERRILLI:

I agree that that aspect of

4

the arrangement is not negotiated, but there is

5

nonetheless an arrangement that secures and guarantees

6

the provisions of the benefits, and that's the plan.

7

There are steps that the employer has to take to secure

8

the provision of the benefits, here through the

9

purchase of insurance, and that is the plan.

10

The plan

is the arrangement to secure the provision of benefits.

MR. VERRILLI:

I think

there's a limiting principle here and I think the

limiting principle is to look to ERISA.

4

set of -- it defines what employee benefits are for

5

ERISA purposes, and it's not -- and it's not these

6

benefits and similar things.

7

of benefits.

8

Similarly, a break room wouldn't be on the list.

9

of those things are on the list, and therefore, I think

ERISA has a

It's an exhaustive list

The parking lot isn't on the list.

10

by reference to ERISA, one can relatively easily

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But -- but providing

13

for workers' compensation through insurance, rather

14

than through self-insurance, is also not on the list.

15

MR. VERRILLI:

Well, I think both of them are

16

on the list actually, Mr. Chief Justice, because both

of those are programs or arrangements to secure the

2

-- but the services have to be within the last 180

3

days.

4

MR. VERRILLI:

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

6

Right.
How do you square that with

-- with the purchase of block insurance like this?

7

MR. VERRILLI:

Well, because the amounts that

8

Zurich is seeking in premiums are the amounts that were

9

due for providing coverage during the 180 days before

10

Howard ceased operations, and the reason that arises

11

from -- it seems to me there are two ways in which that

12

could arise from services rendered.

13

services rendered to the employees in the following

14

sense.

15

benefits by virtue of the fact that the employees are

16

working for it during that period of time.

17

Judge King said in his opinion in the Fourth Circuit,

18

and that seems to me exactly right.

19

alternatively, as other courts have suggested, the --

20

the services rendered --

21

It can arise from

Howard has the obligation to provide those

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's what

Alternatively --

But each of those insurance

22

premiums that's paid by the employer doesn't just cover

23

workers who've worked for the last 180 days.

24

is divided among all the workers who've been working

25

there for years.

Each premium

Some of the premiums are going to go

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

to -- to allow the insurance company to pay in the

2

future people who have been there for 20 years.

3

MR. VERRILLI:

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well -I mean, it just seems to me

5

it's a square peg in a round hole.

6

how you make sense out of that 180 --

7

MR. VERRILLI:

I -- I don't see

I appreciate that, Justice

8

Scalia, but I do think the -- the obligation on the

9

part of the employer to keep paying the premiums

10

during that period arises from the fact that the

11

employees are continuing to work during that period.

12

And what the -- and what the insurance company is

13

seeking to recover is merely the cost of providing the

14

insurance during that period of 180 days which arises

15

--

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

If -- if they don't pay the

17

premium with respect to the 180 days, if there's an

18

accident during the 180 days, the insurance doesn't

19

cover the accident.

20

MR. VERRILLI:

That's an important point,

21

Justice Souter, and I would like to focus on that and I

22

-- I hope correct something that the Petitioners said.

23

With respect -- it all depends on when the

24

insurance policy cancels.

25

premiums, then the insurance company has the right to

If there's nonpayment of

30
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

1

cancel the policy, and there has -- there's a notice

2

provision, 10 days in some jurisdictions, up to 30 days

3

in others.

4

But they have a right to cancel the policy.
If an injury occurs before cancellation, that

5

injury is covered and it's covered for all time, even

6

if the policy subsequently cancels.

7

But the key thing here, I think, the critical

8

point is that without the priority, the -- the

9

insurance company is going to look at the situation and

10

say, we have very little prospect of recovering if this

11

company actually goes down the tubes and into

12

bankruptcy as a general unsecured creditor.

13

we need to get out of this situation fast.

14

at that point, they're going to cancel the policy.

15

There's going to be much more of a hair-trigger sense

16

of the need to cancel policies.

17

policies, the immediate consequence, of course, is that

18

the -- that the employees are no longer covered.

19
20
21

And they --

When they cancel

And then, the -- it seems to me, the
secondary consequence, which is also quite important -JUSTICE SCALIA:

that they cut it that fine?

24

about that, but don't worry.

25

Therefore,

MR. VERRILLI:

They say, oh, yes, this
We're pretty sure

We'll have priority.

It's absolutely --

I think as soon as they

smell bankruptcy, they're going to pull the plug

anyway.

4

MR. VERRILLI:

That -- I -- I disagree with

5

that, Justice Scalia.

6

practice here, the amount that they can recover and the

7

amount that they think they have a prospect of

8

recovering is a very important determinant in their

9

decision on whether to hang in and how long to hang in

I think in -- in the real common

10

11

debtor can then husband its assets and can pay the

12

workers' compensation premiums as an administrative

13

claim.

14

determinant.

15

So I think it's a -- it's a significant

Without the priority, there's going to be a

16

hair trigger, which means coverage is terminated

sooner, and it's going to mean for many employers that

can't operate without --

to the side.

benefits.

difference there, though they argued the mandate makes

a difference.

And you want to say there isn't enough of a

Of course, you could mandate health

But if you're right, what about a -- a longterm contract for bottled water for the workers?

11

MR. VERRILLI:

I think my answer would be the

12

same as to the Chief Justice that in some sense, I

13

suppose you could say it's an employee benefit; in some

14

sense, I suppose you could say that there's a contract

15

to provide it.

not.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

this that is -- does make it different, at least one,

way that the others are not.

The employer -- there's a

the other benefits, there is no -- no such tradeoff.

13

MR. VERRILLI:

And in the other cases of

Well, the fact that there may

14

be a benefit to the employer doesn't make it any less

15

of an employee benefit.

16

is a plan that provides employee benefits, and the

17

insurance coverage provided by workers' compensation

18

are clearly employee benefits.

19

of course, the with -- with respect to that tradeoff,

20

that's -- that tradeoff is an employee benefit too,

21

Justice Ginsburg, because the -- the employee has no-

22

fault liability, gets paid promptly rather than have to

that it's not an employee benefit plan on the basis of

And of course, voluntarily provided

JUSTICE STEVENS:
Mr. Verrilli?

7

MR. VERRILLI:

8

JUSTICE STEVENS:

9

May I ask this question,

-- better morale.
Can I -- can I ask you --

it goes back to the first point your opponent made.

10

What is the purpose of granting the priority?

11

to me the purpose of the priority is to increase the

12

likelihood that the wage claims will be paid.

13

you -- if you win, it won't affect it one way or

14

another, as you acknowledge in your brief.

15

seems to me the priority should serve the purpose of

16

increasing the likelihood that the benefits would

17

actually flow to the employee benefit plan.

18
19

MR. VERRILLI:

And if

But it

I think there are four things

I'd like to say in response to that, Justice Stevens.

20
21

It seems

First, there isn't a textual hook for -- for
that being a determinant, and it -- and it --

22

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, it talks about

23

contributions to an employee benefit plan which one

24

would not normally think of as paying insurance

25

premiums.

36
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. VERRILLI:

And the second thing -- well,

2

I think to the contrary, Justice Stevens.

3

the overwhelming majority of instances, the

4

contributions employers make to employee benefit plans

5

is the payment of insurance premiums to secure the

6

benefits.

7

union trusts are a small minority of the benefits that

8

are provided to workers in this country.

9

I think in

Collectively bargained benefits provided by

But -- but going back to the specific

10

question, of course, as Justice Alito's question

11

earlier suggested, in a multi-employer pension plan

12

situation, the plan is obligated by law to provide all

13

vested pension benefits whether or not the employee's

14

employer has defaulted on its payments into the fund.

15

So it's in exactly the same position as the insurance

16

company is with respect to that set of benefits, and

17

therefore, the argument doesn't draw a distinction

18

between the two.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Verrilli, what -- what

20

is your response to Mr. Strain's assertion that if you

21

get a priority, so should the secondary insurer, that

22

is, the -- the bank that gave letters of credit?

23

They're just insuring -- that -- that's part of the

24

plan too.

25

you unless they got the letters of -- of credit from

They couldn't have gotten the insurance from

Alderson Reporting Company

1

the bank, which is a kind of secondary insurance.

2

And also in the case of self-insurance, which

3

is something of a plan -- I -- I guess you'd call it a

4

plan -- what about the -- the person who puts up the

5

bond?

That person is a kind of insurer, just as you

6

are.

Do all of these people now -- now get bumped up

7

to the head of the line?

8
9

MR. VERRILLI:
expressly covers this.

The answer is no.

The statute

The last provision of section

10

507 says no subrogation, and those would be subrogation

11

situations.

12

They aren't -- they don't get bumped up in the line,

13

period.

I don't think there's any dispute about that.

14
15

If I could, though, return to a -- a point
that --

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. VERRILLI:

It's not, but that is what the last section of section 507

2

says, that those who are subrogated to the rights of

3

someone with a priority don't get the priority.

4

that's just taken care of by the statute.

5

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So

But if the payment of the

6

premiums doesn't increase the likelihood that the

7

employees will get the benefits, why should you get

8

priority?

9

MR. VERRILLI:

It does increase the

10

likelihood, and it goes back to the example I was -- I

11

was discussing with Justice Souter earlier.

12

what -- it will not affect employees who are injured

13

before cancellation, but it will accelerate

14

cancellation.

removal, and it would make it a harder question, I

22

suppose, as to whether there would be a -- whether

23

there would be a claim for priority in that context.

24
25

But I think, if I could, Mr. Chief Justice,
I'd like to return to the question of narrow

41
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

construction where we started the argument.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

May I detract you just for

3

a moment?

4

history, correct me if I'm wrong, but originally, 1934,

5

the kind of claim that you have would be a seventh

6

priority claim.

7

priority at all covering workers' compensation.

8

then when Congress restored a priority, it ratcheted it

9

up to four or five, depending upon which version of the

On -- on a question of the statutory

And then in '38, Congress said no
And

10

statute we use.

11

Congress originally assigned first a very low priority

12

and then no priority, suddenly it gets up to be on a

13

par with the fringe benefits?

14

Is there any explanation why, when

MR. VERRILLI:

Yes.

I think there are two

15

significant points there, Justice Ginsburg, in terms of

16

the history.

17

that workers' compensation could be a provable claim.

18

It then said it's -- it gets the -- the seventh

19

priority, but the seventh priority was not a priority

20

specific to workers' compensation.

21

that's -- it was a provision that said you get a

22

priority if State law provides the priority.

23

what Congress did was wipe out that provision for all

24

State law granted priorities, not for workers' comp in

25

specific.

First, in 1934 what Congress said was

It was a priority

In 1938,

So it doesn't seem to me it was a specific

judgment about workers' comp and its place in the

2

priority system.

3

And, of course, you didn't have the well-

4

developed system of employee benefit plans in the

5

1930's that you have now.

6

it enacted this provision in 1978, following closely

after ERISA, was to use language which is identical to

8

ERISA in providing a priority for employee benefit

plans which, as ERISA on its face, I think, makes

clear, would encompass workers' compensation plans.

your friend's argument about the interrelation between

13

(a)(3) and (a)(4) seems like a compelling one.

14

your answer to that?

15

MR. VERRILLI:

What is

I think the complete

16

explanation for the relationship between (a)(3) and

17

(a)(4) was that Congress was trying to expand the scope

18

of the priority here without doing damage either to the

19

wage priority above it, which -- and -- and there would

20

have been damage to the wage priority above it if wages

21

were simply redefined to include the broader set of

22

employee benefits -- or to the priorities below.

23

Congress just took the aggregate amount.

11

In many, many more cases in which this Court

12

has interpreted the priority provisions of the act and

code.

Counsel, much of your

What -- what is your strongest evidence for

MR. VERRILLI:

Well, I think the fact that

11

the phrase is identical to the phrase that appears in

12

ERISA, employee benefit plan, is significant.

13

was one of the most substantial legislative

14

accomplishments of that decade of the 1970s.

15

think the mere fact that the exact same language

16

appears in both places, importantly, however, with --

17

without the limiting qualification in section 507(a)(4)

18

that exists in ERISA itself with respect to workers'

19

compensation plans.

ERISA

And so I

20

I also think that if the Court does look at

21

the legislative history, what -- what one learns from

22

the legislative history is that when the bill was

23

originally introduced to -- to create this priority, it

24

created a priority for -- proposed to create a priority

and said that's too narrow.

significantly broader to ensure that the full range of

must have:

19

what's unemployment, is that a plan too?

20

Those two I think of as

workers' comp and unemployment.

MR. VERRILLI:

So

No, because the employer

21

doesn't have the obligation to provide unemployment

22

compensation.

23

State has the obligation to provide the benefit, and

24

the State does in fact provide the benefit.

25

usually funded through a tax.

That's a State-run system in which the

It's

In conclusion, if I could just focus on the

8

-- the point that it really is the case that enforcing

9

this priority, as it is written, will advance the

10

purposes for which Congress included it in the code.

11

It will protect the interests of workers, millions of

12

whom have no employee benefit plan other than workers'

13

compensation, because it will increase the prospects

14

that that money is there to pay workers' compensation

15

claims.

16

It will also advance the code's purpose of

17

better rehabilitation because it will give insurance

18

companies a reason not to pull the hair trigger, to

19

hang in there with these companies, and to allow them

20

to have a chance to rehabilitate rather than forcing them

21

into liquidation by canceling coverage which the law

22

allows.

Thank you.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL F. STRAIN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. STRAIN:

This Court 10 years ago in United States v.

engrafting of the ERISA definition into this bankruptcy

statute was improper.

ERISA definition into the bankruptcy statute is dealt with

in plain language in this Supreme Court decision.

simply improper to do that, and yet, that is the answer

13

given by Zurich to the many probing hypotheticals about

14

parking lots and bottled water and the rest.

2

insured-for or paid-for benefits count as the plan and

3

which ones don't?

4

MR. STRAIN:

What we look to, Justice Breyer,

5

first of all, is whether it is a true wage substitute

6

rather than a policy to take care of a non-negotiable

7

statutory requirement that's --

JUSTICE BREYER:

So if, in fact -- if, in

fact, the State legislature mandates certain health

10

benefits, then the plan that provides those benefits

would no longer qualify.

others, but that would be one significant factor to

consider.

That would be one significant
There are certainly

That is true.

16

And I -- I suggest to the Court that when we

17

look to the legislative history, as the questions were

18

asked about the legislative history, it is devoid of

19

any reference to the commission that recommended the

20

law, the House report or the Senate report, or even one

21

stray Congressperson suggesting that workers' comp

22

insurance policies should get a priority.

The industry didn't even put up a representative to

make that suggestion at a hearing.
