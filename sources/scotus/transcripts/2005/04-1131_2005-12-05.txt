CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We’ll hear argument

first today in Whitman versus Department of Transportation.

Ms. Karlan.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAMELA S. KARLAN

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MS. KARLAN:

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

10

The Government now concedes that the Ninth

11

Circuit erred in holding that the negotiated grievance

12

procedure of the Civil Service Reform Act strips

13

Federal courts of their jurisdiction to hear

14

constitutional claims by Federal employees.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

We’re not bound by that

16

concession.

17

doesn’t matter whether the Government conceded it or

18

not, does it?

19

If that’s a jurisdictional question,

MS. KARLAN:

No.

That’s correct, but the

20

Government correctly conceded perhaps I should have

21

said.

22

So I think that the --

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

24

MS. KARLAN:

25

Yes.

That’s a different question.
So the question before the

Court is not whether, I think, Mr. Whitman can receive

3
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

constitutional judicial review, but rather, where and

2

how he is supposed to do so.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I still think it’s whether

4

because I don’t agree with the Government.

5

that?

6

MS. KARLAN:

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

8
9

Can I do

Of course, you can.
So that is the question.

I

mean, the question is open whether there -MS. KARLAN:

Yes.

I -- I think, obviously,

10

the Court has an obligation to satisfy itself of the

11

jurisdiction.

12

have had that obligation as well in NTEU against Von

13

Raab in which this Court addressed precisely the same

14

kind of case, litigated in precisely the same posture.

15

But I’ll point out then that you would

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Was it raised?

Was that

16

objection, the jurisdictional question, raised in the

17

briefs and --

18

MS. KARLAN:

It was raised in the district

19

court and the Government chose not to raise it in the

20

court of appeals or here.

21

Justice Scalia said, an independent obligation to

22

satisfy yourself of your subject matter jurisdiction.

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But, of course, you have, as

But our cases say that where

24

we don’t speak to a jurisdictional question, it is not

25

regarded as having been decided.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

MS. KARLAN:

No.

I’m not saying that you

2

decided it in NTEU against Von Raab, Justice Scalia.

3

I’m just saying that given that you were apparently

4

satisfied with the theory, you should be satisfied here

5

too as well.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Even -- even if you assume

7

that Von Raab decided it, you have a quite different

8

situation here.

9

any judicial review.

The issue isn’t whether there will be
The issue is whether there will

10

be judicial review for the minor grievances, even if

11

they happen to involve a constitutional issue, that are

12

-- that are not -- for which judicial review was not

13

provided.

14

review, as I understand it, is available, and it is

15

only relatively insignificant actions for which

16

judicial review is not available.

17
18

Any major employee action -- judicial

MS. KARLAN:

No.

Isn’t that right?

With all respect, Justice

Scalia, I think that’s incorrect.

19

The Civil Service Reform Act provides for

20

judicial review of personnel actions, and if you go

21

back to the opinion for the Court that you wrote in

22

Fausto, you’ll see that you repeatedly referred to them

23

as personnel actions there.

24
25

Now, a warrantless search of a Government
employee, as this Court’s opinion in Bush against Lucas

5
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

says at note 28, is not a personnel action, and

2

therefore, there is no way of obtaining review of it

3

through the Civil Service Reform Act.

4

any sense here a minor violation of Mr. Whitman’s

5

rights.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But it is not in

He could have refused -- he

7

could have refused the search, in which case if there

8

was any significant personnel action taken against him

9

for refusing it, he would have had judicial review of

10

whether the search was constitutional or not.

11
12

MS. KARLAN:

Yes, Justice Scalia, but he

would have to bet the ranch to do it.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And I think --

That’s often the case where

14

-- where, in -- in order to challenge a governmental

15

action, you -- you have to be willing to -- to go to

16

court by resisting it.

17

MS. KARLAN:

Justice Scalia, I think that’s

18

incorrect when it comes to Government agency actions of

19

this kind.

20

that we cite in our brief makes quite clear.

21

That’s what the Abbott Laboratories case

And I think last week, just last week, this

22

Court understood precisely that problem in talking

23

about the doctor who faces the abortion statute in

24

Ayotte.

25

that to risk your license there or to risk, in this

And several members of the Court pointed out

6
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

case, a job that our client has held for 20 years in

2

order to challenge whether his Fourth Amendment rights

3

are violated is not normally how judicial review should

4

be accomplished.

5

And so the question here really is how

6

judicial review should be accomplished, and we’ve

7

maintained all along that the way judicial review

8

should be accomplished here is the way that it’s

9

accomplished in all sorts of cases, by bringing an

10

action in the Federal district court seeking injunctive

11

relief.

12

Now, what the Government --

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Even though if -- if

14

-- do you concede that if he had, for example, refused

15

the testing and been fired and it was a major personnel

16

action, he would have to go through the statutory

17

procedures before bringing that -- the constitutional

18

claim on review of those administrative procedures?

19

MS. KARLAN:

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Absolutely, Mr. Chief Justice.
Well, doesn’t it seem

21

odd -- and this is sort of the logic of -- in Fausto

22

and some of the other cases -- that when you have a

23

major action, you have to exhaust before you can go

24

into court, but if you have something that doesn’t

25

qualify as a major adverse action, you get to go to

7
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

court right away?

2

MS. KARLAN:

I can see why that might seem at

3

first a little strange to you, Your Honor.

4

point of the CSRA is to deal not with major versus

5

minor actions.

6

administrative review and not judicial review, but

7

that’s about personnel actions.

8

challenging a personnel action here.

9

a warrantless search.

But the

It’s true that minor actions you get

Mr. Whitman is not
He’s challenging

The warrantless search was the

10

non-random, arbitrary urinalysis and breathalyzer to

11

which he was subjected.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But that search was a

13

consequence of his employment.

14

search of a -- of a citizen who had no connection with

15

the Government.

16

to submit to as an employee.

17

as unrelated to employee action seems to me

18

unrealistic.

19

that if he didn’t, he would have -- he would have been

20

subject to an employee action.

21

It -- this wasn’t a

It was a search that he was required
So to -- to describe it

The only reason he submitted to it was

MS. KARLAN:

No, Justice Scalia.

He was

22

required, as a condition of his employment, to submit

23

to constitutional drug testing.

24

this case is that this drug test was unconstitutional

25

and --

And his allegation in

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Do you think it becomes

2

unconstitutional when -- when you have one more test?

3

What did it become unconstitutional?

4

was not unconstitutional.

5

MS. KARLAN:

The first test

No, Your Honor.

It became

6

unconstitutional when it became clear that at the

7

Anchorage air traffic control facility, they were not

8

complying with the requirements both of --

9
10

JUSTICE STEVENS:
MS. KARLAN:

How many tests did he have?

Well, he alleges in his

11

complaint that he was subjected to 13 tests, and then

12

when he complained --

13

JUSTICE STEVENS:

14

MS. KARLAN:

Over what period of time?

Over a period of time of

15

approximately 5 years in which other employees were

16

subjected to no more than one or two.

17
18

JUSTICE STEVENS:
three a year?

Is that what it was?

19

MS. KARLAN:

20

JUSTICE STEVENS:

21
22

So it’s maybe three --

Yes, but he was picked -And that’s

unconstitutional?
MS. KARLAN:

No, Justice Stevens.

His

23

allegation is he was picked seven times in a row for

24

random drug testing.

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, somebody will be if

9
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

it’s random.

2

will be if it is random.

3

picked seven times, that would show it wasn’t random.

4

So, you know --

If you have thousands of people, somebody

5

MS. KARLAN:

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

If there were nobody who was

Right, and --- whether he has a good

constitutional claim here I guess is rather doubtful -MS. KARLAN:

Well, he may well not.

He may

well lose on his constitutional claim, Justice Breyer,

10

and that’s not the issue before this Court.

11

question is whether a district judge should decide,

12

should listen to the facts and decide whether this was

13

random or not.

14
15
16

I tried once to calculate what are the
chances of -JUSTICE BREYER:

17

people are there?

18

try to calculate it?

19
20
21
22

What are they?

How many

How many people are tested if you

MS. KARLAN:

How many -I -- I tried to do it and I

couldn’t do it.
JUSTICE BREYER:

-- in the Federal

Government?

23

MS. KARLAN:

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

The

Well, it wouldn’t -All you do is you get a bell

curve and you ask the Library of Congress and they’ll

do it --

2

MS. KARLAN:

3

I -- I know.

4

doesn’t go that high.

5
6

Well, right, but it would be --

You know, I -- it -- my calculator

JUSTICE BREYER:

MS. KARLAN:

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

10

But it’s high.

They’ll do it for

you.
(Laughter.)

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

13

MS. KARLAN:

But the -- the --

It’s the undergraduates that

know how to do that.

15
16

But it’s not hard to do.

You just ask someone at Stanford.

11

14

It’s -- it’s not hard

to do.

7

9

No.

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

Regardless, this

is beside the point.

17

I -- all right.

Can I -- I just want you at

18

some point to get to not just the constitutional

19

question.

20

don’t know if he should have exhausted or not, et

21

cetera.

Maybe he can go in and raise his claim.

22

MS. KARLAN:

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

I

Right.
But I find it hard, in

24

reading this, to believe the following.

25

worker, I mean, normally you have a collective

Like any other

11
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

bargaining agreement, and the union takes up your minor

2

thing.

3

it’s a major thing, like a personnel action, there’s a

4

special thing where you get in -- you know, you -- you

5

get into court way down the road.

6

complicated.

7

classifies it as a grievance where the union is

8

supposed to take it up and the union tells him we’re

9

not going to take it up, we don’t believe in your

And here, what you’re saying is although if

It’s very

This individual, even though he

10

claim, that then he can run in to a Federal judge.

11

Now, that -- that I find surprising, and I’d like you

12

to explain how in your theory that works.

13

MS. KARLAN:

Yes, Justice Breyer.

The

14

problem with assuming that a union will take a claim

15

like this to arbitration is the following.

16

generally do not take individual employee grievances to

17

arbitration, especially if you look at this collective

18

bargaining agreement, which requires the union to pay

19

the costs if they lose.

20

Unions

Now, on a claim like this, for the very

21

reason that you suggested earlier, it may be difficult

22

to figure out what the facts are.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought your position,

24

Ms. Karlan, was that he doesn’t even have to ask the

25

union.

Justice Breyer is presenting a scenario where

12
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

he asks the union and the union says we’ve got better

2

things to do with our money.

3

MS. KARLAN:

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That’s right.
But I think your position

5

is he doesn’t have to ask at all.

6

into Federal court under 1331.

7

MS. KARLAN:

He can go directly

That’s correct.

Just as, for

8

example, the employees did in the NFFE against

9

Weinberger case on which you sat in the court of

10

appeals where the Government again there tried to argue

11

there was no subject matter jurisdiction, and the court

12

really gave that argument the back of its hand because

13

traditionally the way that someone who wants to allege,

14

someone who is an employee or not who wants to allege,

15

that there -- that he’s seeking injunctive relief for a

16

constitutional violation, goes to the Federal district

17

courts under 28 U.S.C. 1331, not to a negotiated

18

grievance procedure that was not intended and cannot

19

operate in the way that the Government seems to hope --

20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, why -- why can’t he?
Why not?

Because my --

22

when I first looked at this, I thought, well, this is

23

the kind of thing that should have been -- should have

24

been resolved at the grievance level, it shouldn’t have

25

even have to get to arbitration if he’s right.

He

13
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

wants a survey to see if he’s being picked on.

2

is, there would be redress.

3

the kind of complaint that was best handled in that

4

kind of procedure.

5

MS. KARLAN:

If he

So it seemed like this was

Well, I have two somewhat

6

different answers to your question, Justice Ginsburg.

7

One, which I’ll turn to in a moment, is about the

8

specifics of this case, but I want to give the more

9

general one first.

And that is, that the negotiated

10

grievance procedures that unions set up are for the

11

benefit of employees who believe that that is the best

12

way of seeking to resolve their complaints, and most

13

complaints, quite honestly, will be done that way.

14

Most people are not going to go into Federal court,

15

especially not if all they can seek is injunctive

16

relief and they have to pay a filing fee and it’s going

17

to take a long time to go there.

18

Now, Mr. Whitman had two problems that made

19

it unlikely he was going to go through the grievance

20

process here.

21

grievance process, as it sets -- as it’s set out in the

22

joint appendix, the two stages of which he has control

23

-- and I can return in a moment to what happens after

24

that.

25

to talk to his supervisor and to talk to the facility

The first of these problems is that the

But the two stages at which he has control are

14
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

manager.

2

When it comes to drug testing of the kind to

3

which Mr. Whitman was subjected here, his supervisor

4

does not have authority over that.

5

outside the facility.

6

will not get him anywhere.

7

It’s done from

So talking to his supervisor

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yes, but that simply means

8

that the grievance procedure is more valuable in this

9

case than merely talking to his supervisor.

And -- and

10

the -- the issue -- maybe -- maybe we’re missing it,

11

but the issue is why isn’t there a very good reason to

12

require him to go through the grievance procedure,

13

number one, to -- to cut down on needless Federal court

14

actions and, number two, under the -- sort of the

15

general policy of favoring what collective bargaining

16

agreements negotiate.

17

MS. KARLAN:

Well, if his union had

18

negotiated a collective bargaining agreement that

19

required exhaustion, then it would be appropriate to

20

make him go through it, but they didn’t do that.

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but -- no -- no

22

question.

23

shouldn’t we require an exhaustion for those two

24

reasons and maybe others?

25

That would be an easier case.

MS. KARLAN:

But why

Well, if I could go through the

15
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

grievance process, I think you’ll see why this

2

grievance process cannot be turned into an exhaustion

3

process without this Court, in words that Justice

4

Ginsburg used last week, inserting a lot of carets into

5

the statute.

6

That is, there are two stages of this

7

grievance process over which Mr. Whitman has control.

8

He can go to his -- his supervisor in an informal

9

conversation.

There will be no factfinding.

10

no right to call witnesses.

11

present evidence.

12

There is

There is no right to

If he doesn’t like that -- and he has only 15

13

days to do it -- he can then appeal to the -- to the

14

supervisor of the facility.

15

present evidence.

16

factfinding.

17

Those are the --

18
19

He has no right to any kind of

He has no right to a reasoned decision.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

MS. KARLAN:

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

23

He may not have any right to

it, but in fact, he may get some relief.

20

22

Again, he has no right to

Well -The union may say, okay,

we’re going to take this one up.
MS. KARLAN:

They may and I’ll turn to that

24

in just a moment, but let me add one more thing to the

25

answer I was giving a moment ago to Justice Ginsburg,

16
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

which is one of the problems here is that our client

2

alleges in his supplemental complaint that when he

3

first complained about this, he was singled out yet

4

again for retaliatory testing.

5

precisely the kind of case in which someone who is

6

being subjected repeatedly to retaliatory tests would

7

be worried.

And so this is

8

Now let me turn to the question of --

9

JUSTICE O’CONNOR:

Well, Ms. Karlan, let me

10

put one other element in here.

11

specifically told by the FLRA to bring a grievance

12

under the collective bargaining agreement?

13

MS. KARLAN:

Was -- was your client

He was -- he wasn’t told.

He

14

was advised by someone who said the FLRA has no

15

jurisdiction here because this isn’t an unfair labor

16

practice.

17

him to do is to exhaust by going back to the FLRA which

18

has already told him that it has no expertise on this

19

matter.

20

Now, of course, what the Government wants

So let me turn to that third stage of the

21

grievance process now, which is now he invokes

22

arbitration, or at least he asks his union to because

23

under section 7121(b)(1)(C)(iii) of the statute, only

24

the union can invoke arbitration.

25

noted, as long ago as Vaca against Sipes, that unions

Now, this Court

17
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

invoke arbitration in only a minuscule handful of

2

cases, so that in Vaca against Sipes, it was 1 out of

3

900.

4

There was a recent study, the most recent

5

study I could find that was published, about Federal

6

Government employees, dealt with civilian employees of

7

the Army, and it looked at how often did the 31

8

different unions that represent civilian employees of

9

the Army actually invoke arbitration vis-a-vis the

number of grievances that were filed.

11

that in the years it looked at, no more than 6 percent

12

got arbitration.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

And it found

Well, why isn’t the thing to

14

do here -- I -- I see that you are raising a

15

significant question in respect to -- at least in my

16

view, in respect to the -- an action that violates a

17

regulation that violates a statute.

18

Constitution aside, but it might violate a number of

19

practices, good practices, et cetera.

20

focusing on that the thing for the plaintiff here to do

21

is he goes to the union -- I’m just reading from page 6

22

and 7 of your brief -- and he says, I would like you to

23

invoke arbitration?

24

they do it and it comes out a way they don’t like,

25

he then -- they might file exceptions and they might

Leave the

But why isn’t

And they might do it.

Now, if

win.

2

But what you’re worried about is if they

3

don’t win or if they don’t do it, they can go to court

4

only if it involved an unfair labor practice or a major

5

adverse personnel action.

6

I take it.

7

MS. KARLAN:

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

That’s what’s worrying you,

Yes, Your Honor.
Well, why isn’t it, at that

stage if he doesn’t get into court, you then say that

10

that isn’t true?

11

in other instances as well, making the same kinds of

12

arguments that you’re making now.

13
14

MS. KARLAN:

Well, there are two reasons for

that I think.

15
16

They should be able to come to court

One is he suffers an irreparable bet-the-farm
injury every time he’s searched unconstitutionally.

17

The second is that the statute simply doesn’t

18

say that.

19

this Court is in favor of exhaustion requirements.

20

if the statute contained one, it would be eminently

21

sensible for you to apply it.

22

I can understand -- honestly, I can -- why

JUSTICE BREYER:

And

You -- you -- I -- I believe

23

that there are millions of instances, perhaps.

24

I’m -- when I think something like this, I’m quite

25

often wrong.

Now,

But I thought that the reason that

19
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

exhaustion is required is not always because statutes

2

require it.

3

the APA, which applies here as well, and it’s also

4

because of the common law of administrative law that

5

requires people to exhaust their remedies.

6

It’s partly because of the word final in

MS. KARLAN:

Absolutely, and I think if you

7

used this Court’s opinion in Madigan against McCarthy

8

as your template for thinking about whether to impose

9

an exhaustion requirement here, because I think, quite

10

frankly, that’s what you would be doing -- you would be

11

imposing one that doesn’t exist now.

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

13

MS. KARLAN:

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, but the -- the --

The Court --- the whole right to -- to

15

go into court with a constitutional claim is absent

16

from the statute.

17

hung for a sheep as a lamb.

18

recognize the one, I don’t see that we’re going too

19

much further in -- in saying it’s got to be conditional

20

on the other.

21

And -- and so we may as well get

MS. KARLAN:

If -- if we’re going to

I -- I don’t think so, Justice

22

Souter, because I think this Court has traditionally

23

allowed individuals who are bringing constitutional

24

claims for injunctive relief to seek that relief.

25

Nothing in the CSRA changed that, and if I can explain

20
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

why for just a moment, I think it’ll be helpful.

2

If you look at this Court’s opinion in Fausto

3

or you look at this Court’s opinion in Bush against

4

Lucas or the opinion in Karahalios, which I think are

5

the three leading cases from this Court construing the

6

Civil Service Reform Act in -- in this kind of fashion,

7

you’ll notice that they repeatedly refer to those

8

acts as being comprehensive with regard to personnel

9

actions.

10

Personnel actions is not a casual phrase.

It

11

is a defined term in the CSRA.

12

2302(a), which is -- was discussed in the Government’s

13

brief at page 5, note 5.

14

you read it, that they do include -- indeed, Congress

15

in 1994 amended the statute to add to the list of

16

personnel actions orders for psychiatric testing.

17

There was nothing here that turns a drug test into a

18

personnel action.

19

It’s defined in section

And you will notice there, if

Now, the CSRA is absolutely comprehensive in

20

its field, but its field is personnel actions.

21

this case is not a personnel action.

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And

But the grievance procedure

23

covers it, and you took pains to point out to us that

24

when you go to the grievance procedure, you’re not

25

necessarily entitled to findings and -- and written

conclusions, et cetera.

But there’s a reason for that.

The reason for that is that these things can be very,

3

very minor.

4

-- the grievance procedure doesn’t entitle you

5

necessarily to findings, et cetera, that you can go

6

into court.

7

findings is because we know, going in, that they’re so

8

minor.

9

seems very anomalous.

10

MS. KARLAN:

So now you’re saying that just because of

But the only reason you don’t get those

So now the most minor things go to court.

That

Justice Kennedy, all sorts of

11

personnel actions might be minor and they might be the

12

kind of thing that the CSRA wants to have decided

13

administratively only or through exhaustion.

14

Fourth Amendment violation.

15

Court held in Von Raab, the only thing that makes this

16

kind of test constitutional --

17
18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It is not minor.

This is a
As this

I have to interrupt you.

What is the Fourth Amendment violation?

19

MS. KARLAN:

The Fourth Amendment violation

20

here is this Court said that warrantless, suspicionless

21

drug testing of Federal employees is acceptable only if

22

it has safeguards that ensure that there is no

23

discretion exercised in the field and that it’s truly

24

random.

25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

As I understand, the

22
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

allegations are that there was random procedure in

2

effect, and he thinks maybe he’s been tested more

3

frequently than some other people.

4

MS. KARLAN:

That’s all.

No, Your Honor.

He alleges that

5

they are not, in fact, following the random procedures,

6

that instead, when it’s more convenient for them to

7

test him -- and I can understand why they want to test

8

him.

9

why not ask Mr. Whitman who is a compliant, sober

Every time they test him he passes the test.

So

10

employee, if you need another person to just round out

11

the numbers to --

12

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, but as I understand

13

it, the -- the system as a whole is not challenged as

14

violating the Fourth Amendment.

15

MS. KARLAN:

16

No.

The operation of the

system, as it applies to Mr. Whitman in Anchorage.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

By having him take more

18

tests than would be produced by a purely random

19

selection.

22
23
24
25

MS. KARLAN:

That’s correct.

And then by

retaliating -JUSTICE STEVENS:

Have we ever said that’s a

Fourth Amendment violation?
MS. KARLAN:

Of course it is, because you

can’t conduct a random --

JUSTICE STEVENS:

If the computer

malfunctions, that’s a Fourth Amendment violation?

MS. KARLAN:

No.

And if the Government --

the Government in its answer in the district court does

5

not say there was a computer malfunction.

6

don’t really even keep records back as long as he --

7

JUSTICE STEVENS:

They say we

But the relief that he

8

requested was to do a little more testing to see

9

whether he was being tested more than the average

10

person, as I understand it.

11
12

MS. KARLAN:

Well -- well, yes.

Of course,

he was proceeding pro se in the district court.

13

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Which is not -- did not

14

seem to me to be alleging a violation of the Fourth

15

Amendment.

16

MS. KARLAN:

No.

He -- he did.

He said it

17

is not random, and then in his supplemental complaint,

18

he alleged that he was retaliated against for

19

complaining the first time around and was selected out

20

when he wasn’t on the list to be tested yet again.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Ms. -- Ms. Karlan, if this

22

is indeed serious, are you sure that it’s not a

23

personnel action?

24

MS. KARLAN:

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes.
There is a residual category

24
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

in the definition of personnel action which says, any

2

other significant change in duties, responsibilities,

3

or working conditions.

4

That’s the residual category.

But one of the specifically named categories,

5

before you get to that, is a decision to order

6

psychiatric testing.

7

could be a personnel action, why couldn’t a decision to

8

conduct -- to conduct a drug test be considered a

9

personnel action?

10

Now, if that kind of a decision

MS. KARLAN:

Well, two answers to that.

One

11

is the fact that Congress -- in 1978 they first gave

12

the entire list of personnel actions.

13

amended that list to add psychiatric testing.

14

after the Government has already been engaged in urine

15

testing of Federal employees.

16

drug testing, they would have said it.

17

add that is really --

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

In 1994, they
This is

If they wanted to say
And for you to

I’m not adding it.

There’s

19

a residual category at the end:

20

significant change in duties, responsibilities, or

21

working conditions.

22

a significant change in working conditions.

I consider this -- you consider it

23

MS. KARLAN:

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

or any other

With all respect -And he thought he didn’t

have to undergo drug testing, and what do you know?

1

He’s being picked on for drug testing all the time.

2

MS. KARLAN:

Well, with all respect, Your

3

Honor, I think you would have to overrule the Fort

4

Stewart School against FLRA case that the Court decided

5

in 1990 to define working conditions to include a drug

6

test because there -- and it’s cited at page 28 of the

7

NTEU’s brief -- the Court says that the term, working

8

conditions, refers to, quote, circumstances or states

9

of affairs attendant to one’s performance of a job.

10

Now, drug testing is not attendant to his

11

performance of his job.

12

holding the job in some sense that he pass the test.

13

And if he failed that test, he would, indeed, have to

14

go through the CSRA.

15

he has no way of getting into court.

It is the condition of his

But because he passed the test,

16

Now, if I could turn --

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why then would a decision to

18

order psychiatric testing qualify?

19

any other.

Because it says, or

Right?

20

MS. KARLAN:

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That’s -Significant change in

22

duties, responsibilities, or working conditions.

23

implication is that a decision to order psychiatric

24

testing is a significant change in duties,

25

responsibilities, or -- or working conditions.

MS. KARLAN:

But if the -- but if Congress,

covered psychiatric tests, it would not have amended

4

the statute in 1994 to add them specifically.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It’s always good to be safe.

Well, yes, and it’s good for the

think he should be allowed to go to Federal court.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And that’s why we

Ms. -- Ms. Karlan,

10

you have a -- a statutory claim that essentially

11

mirrors the constitutional claim.

12

the testing to be random and impartial.

13

there’s a difference between the constitutional claims

14

and statutory claims with respect to their treatment

15

under the CSRA, how do you handle that?

16

to exhaust the statutory claim but not the

17

constitutional one?

The statute requires

review of the statutory claim.

here is arguing that there should be a differential

23

treatment with respect to exhaustion.

24

respect to whether you can get into court --

25

the Government on that, that he can never get review of

Oh, well.

to them on a -- on a point on which you don’t agree

9

with them.

I mean --

10

MS. KARLAN:

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What can I -- what can I say?
I still don’t

12

understand how they proceed.

13

can he go right into court on the constitutional claim

14

even if the statutory claim has to go through the

15

grievance procedure?

16
17

MS. KARLAN:

Does he have to bring --

The answer to that would be yes.

He might end up being precluded, if he lost in Federal

18

court on the constitutional claim, from coming back on

19

the statutory claim.

20
21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So the identical

claims have to proceed under two different routes.

22

MS. KARLAN:

No, Your Honor.

We don’t think

23

there is exhaustion required with respect to either set

24

of claims.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART

5
6
7
8
9

Thank you, counsel.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. STEWART:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Although Congress has not clearly expressed
an intent to foreclose all judicial review of

10

petitioner’s constitutional claim, such review should

11

be conducted in a manner that is as consistent as

12

possible with the text and structure of the CSRA.

13

Because petitioner failed to invoke the grievance

14

procedures of the applicable collective bargaining

15

agreement, his suit was properly dismissed.

16

And if I may, just in a -- a moment or two,

17

summarize the Government’s position as to the steps

18

that an individual in petitioner’s position would have

19

to take in order to obtain judicial review of a

20

constitutional claim like this one.

21

First, the employee must make all reasonable

22

efforts to utilize the available administrative

23

remedies under the CSRA itself, including any

24

applicable collective bargaining agreement.

25

instance, the first two steps of the grievance process,

So in this

29
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

talking to the immediate supervisor and then to the

2

facility manager, would have been within petitioner’s

3

control.

4

petitioner should have requested that the union take

5

the case to arbitration, and then, if necessary, to the

6

FLRA.

7

And if those steps had proven unavailing,

Second, if at the end of the administrative

8

process an avenue of judicial review is available under

9

the CSRA itself, the employee must seek relief pursuant

10
11

to that provision.
And I think petitioner really concedes that

12

point to be true; that is, if petitioner were raising a

13

constitutional challenge to a major adverse action,

14

such as dismissal, petitioner concedes not only that he

15

would have been required to exhaust administrative

16

remedies by -- by appealing to the Merit Systems

17

Protection Board, but petitioner also concedes that we

18

-- he would have had to seek judicial review in the

19

manner specified by the CSRA, that is, by filing a

20

petition for review of the MSPB’s decision in the

21

Federal Circuit, rather than proceeding directly to

22

district court.

23

And finally, our position is that if at the

24

conclusion of the administrative process, judicial

25

review is unavailable under the CSRA, the employee may

30
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

then obtain review of his constitutional challenge

2

alone in district court, pursuant to the Administrative

3

Procedure -- Procedure Act.

4

Now, in some sense, there is an element of

5

untidiness in our position because what we’re trying to

6

do is reconcile Congress’ intent to adopt --

7

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Mr. Stewart, can I just ask

8

one question?

9

thought you were describing a major personnel action in

Because I didn’t quite follow it.

I

10

-- in your description of the administrative review.

11

But if this is a minor or whatever, a lesser review,

12

would there have been an avenue through the

13

administrative agency?

14

MR. STEWART:

There would have been, at least

15

for this employee, by virtue of the fact that he was

16

covered by a collective bargaining agreement.

17
18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Through the collective

bargaining --

19

MR. STEWART:

20

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Yes.
But then supposing the

21

union is unwilling to grieve or take it up or he fails,

22

then what happens?

23

MR. STEWART:

If -- if he requests that the

24

union take the grievance to arbitration and then to the

25

FLRA and the union refuses, our position would be that

31
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

he could then file suit in Federal district court under

2

the Administrative Procedure Act on his constitutional

3

challenge alone.

4
5

JUSTICE STEVENS:

MR. STEWART:

That would be in the district

court --

8
9

And it would be in the

district court.

6
7

That is, we think on the one --

JUSTICE O’CONNOR:

Now, that is if -- if the

union doesn’t agree to arbitration?

10

MR. STEWART:

That is if the union does not

11

agree to take the case to arbitration and then to the

12

FLRA.

13

If -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So your difference --

14

what’s separating you and Whitman, it seems, is a

15

question of timing.

16

that would come at the end, after he’s used the

17

administrative process, is the same one that he is

18

seeking to bring at the front end.

19

1331 action --

The action that you’re describing

20

MR. STEWART:

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That is, it’s a

I think --- and -- and it’s based

22

on the Government’s waiver of sovereign immunity for

23

nonmonetary claims.

24
25

MR. STEWART:

It is in part one of timing,

but it’s not one of timing alone.

That is, our

32
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

position is if Mr. Whitman had been successful in

2

prevailing upon the union to take the case to

3

arbitration and then to the FLRA, the position we’ve

4

taken in the brief is that judicial review, if the FLRA

5

had rendered an unfavorable decision, would most

6

appropriately be accomplished in the court of appeals

7

pursuant to the CSRA.

8

But our position is if the union is unwilling

9

to take the grievance to the point where the ruling can

10

be reviewed under the provisions of the CSRA itself,

11

that the APA remains available as a fallback.

12

But the -- the fact that it’s one of timing

13

doesn’t make it an insignificant difference.

14

--

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That is

Mr. Stewart, you know, you

16

have here a statute in which Congress, with malice

17

aforethought, very clearly provides for judicial review

18

of any major personnel actions and does not provide for

19

judicial review of what it had regarded as

20

insignificant personnel actions.

21

position, although I don’t agree with it, that the

22

constitutional provision which says Congress can -- can

23

make exceptions to the jurisdiction of the Federal

24

courts should not be interpreted to exclude significant

25

constitutional claims.

I can understand the

But when Congress has gone to

33
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

the trouble of providing for judicial review of any

2

claims that are significant and just saying any other

3

insignificant action, even though a constitutional

4

violation is alleged in connection with it, if in fact

5

it does not harm you that much, we’re not going to

6

allow judicial review, what is -- what is wrong with

7

that?

8

-- and you’re creating a scheme that simply contradicts

9

what Congress plainly said.

10

It seems to me that’s what Congress has said and

MR. STEWART:

I mean, first, certainly if

11

Congress had said with absolute clarity that district

12

court review of claims like this is precluded, we would

13

defend the statute as constitutional.

14

Second, I agree with you that the fairest

15

reading, the most likely interpretation of Congress’

16

intent is that claims of this nature -- that is,

17

complaints about aspects of the employment relationship

18

that don’t rise to the level of personnel actions.

19

fairest reading of Congress’ intent is that such suits

20

would be precluded.

21

The

However, this Court in a number of prior

22

decisions has required something more than that before

23

inferring that Congress has barred all judicial review

24

of a colorable constitutional claim.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Did any of them involve a

34
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

situation in which Congress took the pain to separate

2

significant actions from insignificant actions?

3
4

MR. STEWART:

I mean, in some sense the CSRA

--

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

This is a case where Congress has -- has carefully

tried to say these are major actions for which you

should be able to get into the courts.

And these other

things -- you -- you have these administrative

remedies, but that’s the end of it.

12

MR. STEWART:

of it is that some of those cases involved statutes

Well, that’s what -- that’s

what you’re asking us to say.
MR. STEWART:

I think the Court had the same

5

situation in Webster v. Doe.

6

Doe, the Court concluded that given the limits on

7

review of the CIA director’s employment decisions and

8

given the great sensitivity of hiring and firing

9

matters within that agency, the Court concluded that

10

there was simply no law to apply in review of the --

11

the claimant’s complaint under the Administrative

12

Procedure Act.

13

judicial review of the constitutional challenge

14

remained available.

15

That is, in Webster v.

Nevertheless, the Court concluded that

And the idea was not so much that Congress

16

itself had manifested an intent to differentiate

17

between the two types of claims.

18

had treated the two types of claims the same but that

19

the type of evidence that will suffice to eliminate

20

judicial review of a non-constitutional claim is --

21

it’s less demanding than the type that the Court would

require before eliminating judicial review of a

constitutional claim.

No.

The statutory claim

wouldn’t be before the district court.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

He’s --

Again, if -- if

Well, that’s what I mean.

8

This is a very odd system where you have to immediately

9

go to the constitutional claim and you’re foreclosed

10

from looking at the statutory claim.

11

MR. STEWART:

I -- I agree that it’s an

12

unusual system, but I think it -- and in a sense the

13

same situation would have been present in Webster v.

14

Doe, that is, the Court, when it came to review the

15

merits of the constitutional challenge, wouldn’t have

16

had any possibility of deciding the case on a non-

constitutional basis because non-constitutional

18

challenges would be foreclosed.

19

Now --

1

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought that the

2

Government’s position was there’s no right of action

3

under that statute.

4

MR. STEWART:

There’s no private right of

5

action conferred by 45-108 itself.

6

ordinary case, when a Federal statute places limits on

7

agency personnel and a particular category of

8

plaintiffs falls within the zone of interest that was

9

intended to be protected by that provision, then even

Now, in the

10

if the statute that limits agency discretion itself

11

doesn’t provide a private right of action, the

12

Administrative Procedure Act would entitle a claimant

13

to get into court and argue that the agency’s decision

14

was contrary to law, namely the relevant statute.

15

if there were no question of CSRA conclusion, we would

16

agree that the claimant could go into court raising a

17

statutory challenge notwithstanding the absence of a

18

private right of action in 45-108 itself.

So

19

Here, we think that the evidence from the

20

comprehensive congressional scheme is sufficient to

21

divest the courts of jurisdiction over the statutory

22

claim.

23

the clarity that this Court has required to divest the

24

courts of jurisdiction over the constitutional

JUSTICE O’CONNOR:

Now, as to that, if -- if

2

there were a petitioner with some constitutional claim

3

-- let’s not get into the debate about significant or

4

non-significant -- covered by the collective

5

bargaining agreement, you say the petitioner can’t go

6

to court with the constitutional claim unless he first

7

persuades the union to seek arbitration.

MR. STEWART:

No.

We’re saying that he first

has to attempt to persuade the union to seek

10

arbitration.

11

efforts to utilize the full range of administrative

12

remedies.

13

be available at the end of the day in Federal district

dismissing the suit.

24

merits of the Fourth Amendment dispute and then

switched to a threshold objection to adjudication.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

We’ve always argued that the suit was barred by the

2

CSRA scheme, and we’ve always pointed out that the

3

petitioner did not take advantage of the administrative

4

remedies that were available to him.

5

Really, the only change in our position is

6

that we have been in the -- in this Court have been

7

willing to acknowledge that in the hypothetical case

8

where someone in petitioner’s position did make -- take

9

full advantage or make reasonable efforts to take full

10

advantage of the administrative processes, that

11

judicial review would be available.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

So I guess

13

you’re saying, as to the constitutional claim, it’s

14

obvious they have to exhaust.

15

There’s no reason why they don’t have to

16

exhaust in respect to the 12th test, which has already

17

occurred, and in respect to the 15th, which might be

18

threatened, if it does come about that it’s threatened,

19

they can go in, I guess, under 705 of the APA and ask

for an injunction.

can’t imagine why they couldn’t do that if they have a

Is there any reason they couldn’t?

MR. STEWART:

I -- I mean, again with the

13

caveat they would first have to avail themselves of the

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, they wouldn’t.

Their

16

point is that the very -- availing myself of the

17

administrative remedy will work irreparable harm of --

18

in violation of my constitutional right.

19

that’s not true, but let’s imagine it’s true.

20

couldn’t they go in and ask for a protective order?

21

thought that you could do that, but I might be wrong.

22

MR. STEWART:

Now, maybe
Then

I mean, I think you’re --

you’re correct that you could do that in the general

run of cases under the administrative --

Alderson Reporting Company

1

reason that they shouldn’t be able to do that here?

2

Because they are going to say that -- I don’t know they

3

ever can make it out in this case, but they are going

4

to say that my having to go ahead with the number --

5

test number 15, which, by the way, may never be

6

threatened, but if it is, it will, the very fact that I

7

have to do it, violate an important constitutional

8

right that I need to have protected before undergoing

9

the text -- the test.

10

MR. STEWART:

No.

In -- in our view, in

11

harmonizing the -- the principle that judicial review

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

14

MR. STEWART:

Yes.

-- will ordinarily be available

15

for a constitutional claim with the remedial scheme

established by the CSRA --

on that.

20

You think they could not do

So there is a difference between you

As to the statutory claim, I mean, I find --

view that the notion of private right of action in this

area simply mixes things up.

25

It’s my personal

It’s apples and oranges.

It has nothing to do with anything.

it isn’t as an unfair labor practice -- do we have to

19

decide that issue as to whether a person in those

20

circumstances can then subsequently go into court?

21

MR. STEWART:

No.

I think you could

22

certainly decide the case on the ground that an

23

individual who has made no effort to utilize the

24

grievance procedures that are available under the

25

collective bargaining agreement, can’t bypass those

43
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

1

procedures entirely by filing suit into -- in Federal

2

district court.

3

Court to resolve --

4

And it wouldn’t be necessary for the

JUSTICE BREYER:

So we have to say the easier

5

matter is it’s clear that as to such matters, you must

6

exhaust.

7

to decide whether there is an implied repeal of the

8

right at the end of some days to -- to judicial review,

9

a matter which is disfavored in the law.

10

It’s so clear that there is no reason for us

MR. STEWART:

Well, certainly to -- I mean,

11

that is, justifiably to impose an exhaustion

12

requirement, the Court would have to find that the --

13

the exhaustion principle is in some sense implicit in

14

the CSRA.

15
16
17

JUSTICE BREYER:

I might.

My -- so I don’t

know why it wouldn’t be.
MR. STEWART:

And I think that there’s ample

18

basis for the Court to do that -- that is, one of the

19

noteworthy features of the CSRA is that the act

20

authorizes judicial review of a wide category of

21

Government actions in different courts under different

22

circumstances.

23

that ever gives a plaintiff a right of immediate access

24

to a Federal district court.

25

it be a little bit of a concern to us that the lower

2

court didn’t address it?

look at this exhaustion notion?

4

MR. STEWART:

Should it be sent back to

I mean, I think it’s clear --

5

it -- it is clear and undisputed that the plaintiff was

6

advised by the FLRA that the grievance procedure was

7

his available remedy and declined to invoke even the

8

initial step of the grievance procedure, and therefore

9

--

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But that was on the view

11

that it was an exclusive remedy.

12

not written in -- in any way as an exhaustion

13

requirement.

14

issue.

15

is no judicial review at the end of the line.

16

would be converting something that Congress wrote to be

17

an exclusive remedy into an exhaustion requirement.

18

The -- the statute is

It says you’ve got a minor grievance --

procedure.

11

MR. STEWART:

I -- I mean, I guess we would --

12

we would resist the notion that we’re making it all up.

13

That is, whenever Congress -- whenever this Court

14

attempts to harmonize two distinct statutes to make

them -- in order that they would make sense taken

16

together, the result is likely to be that neither

administrative procedures go.

MR. STEWART:

One of the things that makes

this tricky is that under this Court’s decision of City

of Los Angeles v. Lyons, if an individual is subjected

sense what you could say is the -- the agency action

JUSTICE STEVENS:

final agency action, is it?

The threat of another test isn’t a

MR. STEWART:

I would certainly think that if

7

-- if there were no question of CSRA preclusion, if we

8

were just looking at the APA standing alone, and an

9

individual said they’ve done this unconstitutional

10

thing to me time after time, my supervisor has

11

ransacked my office time and again or FBI agents have

12

shown up at my door every day and have insisted on

13

searching, I think even if damages were unavailable for

14

the prior unlawful actions, at some point we would say

15

the likelihood of repetition is sufficiently imminent

16

that a right of action should be available in court.

17

And -- but again, I think all of these are

18

perhaps potential alternative bases on which this

19

complaint could have been dismissed, but it doesn’t

20

alter the fact that an adequate basis for dismissal was

21

the failure to invoke the grievance procedures

22

available under the CSRA and the collective bargaining

23

agreement.

24

And I think it’s not simply a -- to say that

If the dispute were to go

could the constitutional claim still go to court?

15

MR. STEWART:

The constitutional claim could

16

go to court, and what -- what we’ve sketched out in the

17

brief is two alternative routes for judicial review in

18

the event that the grievance was processed to its

19

conclusion, that is, a finding by the FLRA.

20

On the one hand, it would be possible to

21

invoke the provision of the CSRA that specifically

22

refers to judicial review of FLRA decisions generally,

23

and that provides for review either in the regional

24

courts of appeals or in the D.C. Circuit.

MR. STEWART:

Yes, if -- again, if the OSC

asked for a corrective action in the MSPB.

15

OSC processes the complaint and concludes either that

16

the factual allegations are unsubstantiated or that the

17

allegations, even if true, wouldn’t constitute a

prohibited personnel practice and terminates the

investigation on that basis, there’s no avenue for

judicial review under the terms of the CSRA of the --

the OSC’s decision to dismiss the complaint.

think that the -- the route you’ve sketched out might,

at the end of the day, lead to judicial review without

JUSTICE BREYER:

What their brief says is

that they can go on a personnel, as opposed to major

4

personnel, to the OSC if, and only if, the complaint

5

has to do with whistleblowing.

MR. STEWART:

And that --

that’s --

That’s correct.

JUSTICE BREYER:

And this doesn’t have to do

with whistleblowing.

10

MR. STEWART:

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

That -- that’s correct.
And therefore, even if this

12

were a personnel action, that route to the OSC is not

13

open to them.

that they’ve taken in the brief.

MR. STEWART:

Is that true? What do you think?

-- the position of the OSC and

19

the Department of Justice is that OSC’s jurisdiction

20

over FAA employees is not limited to whistleblower

21

complaints.

22

Now -- now, it’s clear that in the run of

23

complaints, with respect to employees of other Federal

24

agencies, I don’t think there’s any dispute between the

25

parties that OSC’s jurisdiction would extend beyond

In the Government’s view, is it a

MR. STEWART:

No, it’s not.

And indeed, in

7

footnote 28 of this Court’s decision in Bush v. Lucas,

8

the Court specifically identified warrantless searches

9

as an example of conduct in which an employer might

10

engage towards its employees that would not constitute

11

a personnel action.

12

for the proposition that an allegedly unconstitutional

13

drug test is not a personnel action.

14

And we think that’s good authority

Now, if the employee had refused to take the

15

test and been dismissed or disciplined, that would be a

16

personnel action.

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I -In -- in those circuits

19

which allow these cases to go to courts, has there been

any indication that the courts are flooded with a

And again, if I could return just for a

2

moment to the -- the point I was making earlier about

the grievance procedure.

4

manifested a preference for the inclusion of grievance

5

procedures in collective bargaining agreements, and --

6

and given that express congressional preference, it

7

doesn’t seem right for this Court to assume that the

8

grievance procedures won’t work.

9

Congress has clearly

11

However, we don’t think that Congress has

12

spoken with the degree of clarity that this Court’s

decisions demand to preclude all judicial review of

constitutional challenges, and we think the best way of

15

reconciling that presumption of judicial review with

16

the comprehensive nature of the CSRA scheme is to

provide that claims -- constitutional claims are

reviewable if, and only if, the plaintiff has made all

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

2
3

MS. KARLAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

4

I -- I think it’s clear at this point that

5

the Government really is asking this Court to rewrite

6

the CSRA on the fly.

7

on the merits, they wouldn’t tell us whether our client

8

should go to Federal district court or to the court of

9

appeals.

As late as page 48 of their brief

Then in response to Justice Scalia’s

10

question, they say, well, you could rewrite

11

2302(a)(2)(A)(xi) and (x). And I think the CSRA is a

12

sufficiently detailed and comprehensive statute that

13

this Court has resisted rewriting several times.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

MS. KARLAN:

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

I

It is.
All right.

fine.
The -- the -- but the -- the issue it seems

20

that could be dispositive of this, in respect to the

21

non-constitutional claims -- and this is why I want to

22

get your response -- is simply that it is a fair

23

implication from Congress having set up on non-

24

constitutional matters a system of arbitration to

25

require your client to go through that system before

to the question that if I agree with you that on non-

constitutional matters, if this system doesn’t work for

24

your client, he gets review in a Federal district

25

court.

Suppose I agree with you on that.

argument against requiring him to exhaust the remedy

2

that is there, namely a request for arbitration --

3

MS. KARLAN:

JUSTICE BREYER:

5
6

The argument against it --- as an implication from

the statute?
MS. KARLAN:

The argument against it in this

7

case, which stems, from among other things, this

8

Court’s decision in Zipes against TWA and in Heckler

9

against Day, is the Government waived any claim that

10

our client should have been required to exhaust.

11

never raised that issue below, and this Court has

12

repeatedly held that a failure to raise a non-

13

exhaustion defense is waiver of that defense.

14

should wait until you have a case where there has been

15

briefing and factfinding.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

They

You

Now, is there

17

any other claim -- any other answer to the argument

18

other than they waived it?

19

MS. KARLAN:

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

21

MS. KARLAN:

Yes.
What?

And that is that when Congress

that it had no effect on judicial causes of action that

traditional sources of judicial enforcement things that

warrantless search of the kind to which our client was

not within the comprehensive scheme of the CSRA for
