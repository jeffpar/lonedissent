ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

8

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

11

MR. PHILLIPS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
There are two issues in this case.

One concerns

12

walking time, and the other concerns waiting time.

13

unless the Court has a different order, I'd propose to

14

start with the walking time.

15

And

Section 4(a)(1)'s language, which comes from the

16

Portal-to-Portal Act, which was enacted in 1947, by its

17

plain terms clearly covers the walking that's involved in

18

these two cases.

19

appendix of the petition, at 88(a), says that there is no

20

mandatory compensation for, quote, "walking to and from

21

the actual place of performance of the principal activity

22

or activities which such employee is employed to perform."

23

The statute, which is reproduced at the

It's difficult for me to imagine language that

24

could more directly cover what we're dealing with in this

25

particular case, because the Plaintiffs here are -- for

Alderson Reporting Company

1

IBP -- are employed to slaughter and to process beef.

2

employees at Barber Foods are employed to process chicken.

3

And thus, the actual place where they perform those

4

services are obviously on the lines where the processing

5

takes place.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

I would have thought that, but

we've held otherwise.

8
9

The

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I don't know that we've --

I don't know of any case where this Court has held
otherwise.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, we've held that they're

12

-- that the principal activity consists of doffing --

13

donning and doffing the clothes required, haven't we?

14

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, this Court said that

15

donning and doffing was a principal activity in

16

contradistinction to a preliminary or postliminary

17

activity for purposes of section 4(a)(2), but the Court

18

specifically said, in Steiner, that that holding does not

19

apply to matters that are specifically excluded under

20

section 4(a)(1), which deals with walking time, Justice

21

Scalia.

22
23
24
25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So, you think Steiner is

irrelevant?
MR. PHILLIPS:

For -- no, I don't think it's

irrelevant to the workplace.

I think it is irrelevant to

Washington, DC 20005

1

the proper disposition of this case, yes.

2

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, it is if we don't accept

3

the continuous workday rule.

4

continuous workday rule, why isn't it, in effect, the

5

premise from which the conclusion for the other side

6

falls?

If we do accept the

7

MR. PHILLIPS:

8

with the continuous workday rule.

9

does the workday begin?

Well, we don't have any quarrel
The question is, When

And our assessment of the

10

workday, as defined in section 4(a)(1), which controls,

11

specifically, the walking time in this particular case,

12

begins when you arrive at the actual place where you're

13

going to perform the services --

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

15

MR. PHILLIPS:

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but your argument --- or primary activities.
-- assumes that there is only

17

one actual place.

18

with the text of the statute, is that there may be more

19

than one principal activity, and hence, more than one

20

place.

21

is such a place, then wouldn't it be at least

22

administratively odd to apply the continuous workday rule

23

immediately to exclude some walking time that follows

24

that?

25

And their argument, which is consistent

And if the -- if the place of donning and doffing

MR. PHILLIPS:

No, I don't think so.

I think it

6
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

is perfectly sensible and a clear bright-line rule,

2

Justice Souter, to say that when you arrive at the actual

3

place where you perform, not just any activities, and not

4

just the activities that are integral and indispensable to

5

your working activities, but to the principal activities

6

for which you're hired -- and, admittedly, there can be

7

more than one of those, but that doesn't -- you know,

8

donning and doffing is not a principal activity --

9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

10

MR. PHILLIPS:

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

12
13
14

So, you're saying that --- of anyone who's cutting beef.
-- so-called "integral

activities" are not principal activities.
MR. PHILLIPS:
principal activities.

Right.

They don't have to

They're better understood as --

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

16

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

They felt otherwise.
Mr. Phillips, I -- the

17

Steiner opinion explicitly agreed with the lower court in

18

that case, which said that the term "principal activity or

19

activities" embraces all activities that are integral and

20

indispensable.

21

MR. PHILLIPS:

22

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Right.
And if -- if you think that

23

putting on the clothes fall within that, then that covers

24

walking, too --

25

MR. PHILLIPS:

It --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

2

MR. PHILLIPS:

-- after that.

The problem with that analysis is

3

that the court was only analyzing section 4(a)(2) for

4

these purposes.

5

prepared to accept that there are certain activities that

6

are either preliminary or postliminary, and then there are

7

others that are primary activities.

8

integral and indispensable to a primary activity, it is a

9

compensable event."

10

And what it was saying is, "We are

And if you are

Recognizing that Steiner is probably the most

11

extraordinarily extreme facts that you could imagine,

12

because we're talking about clothings that had -- clothing

13

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

15

MR. PHILLIPS:

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But, Mr. Phillips --

-- health and safety.
-- you're asking us to

17

interpret the same words, "principal activity or

18

activities," differently in sub (2) that was at issue in

19

Steiner, and in sub (1), and then the clause that follows

20

both of those.

21

activity" includes donning or doffing, under sub (2), why

22

wouldn't the same follow for sub (1) and the following

23

clauses?

24
25

The same phrase is used.

MR. PHILLIPS:

So if "principal

language "principal activity or activities" in (a)(1)

within the context of what Congress was trying to achieve

2

by the Portal-to-Portal Act, which was to absolutely and

3

categorically exclude walking time from being part of

4

mandatorily compensated activities of a particular

5

employee.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But it is included if it's --

7

once the workday begins, if there's a rotation, you walk

8

from one station to the other.

9

it's conceded, would be included.

10

MR. PHILLIPS:

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Right.

That walking time, I think

But that --

So, if your date -- if the

12

principal activity is donning and doffing, then the

13

walking time thereafter would also be included.

14

MR. PHILLIPS:

But, Justice Ginsburg, if you

15

step back and think about this language in the context of

16

the words that are written here, it says, "walking to and

17

from the actual place of performance of the principal

18

activity."

No one would think that that --

JUSTICE SOUTER:

20

MR. PHILLIPS:

"Or activities."
Or activities.

But, again,

21

Justice Souter, all that suggests is that there are times

when somebody who's working in a clothing operation may --

you know, may spend time distributing the cloth or may

24

spend time actually sewing the cloth.

is employed to perform.

MR. PHILLIPS:

18

that that are worth focusing on.

19

you can lump the two cases together, because the clothing

or the equipment that has to be put on with respect to the

21

Barber Foods company is barely -- is quite minimal and,

22

indeed, was deemed to be diminimus.

23

sure you can lump the two cases together in that way.

Well, there are two parts about

24

But also, in terms of where the Secretary comes

25

out on this, let's not forget 79.7(g), footnote 49, which

10
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

is, candidly, the clearest statement from the Secretary

2

with respect to, What do you do when you have donning and

3

doffing that is followed by walking time?

4

the -- and what does the regulation specifically say?

5

that's on, I think, 92 and 93 of the appendix to our

petition.

And what does

It specifically says that that walking time is

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Not necessarily excluded.

It's

really noncommittal on the point.
MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, except that, under their

11

theory of this case, it is always excluded.

12

that whatever else you can say about the meaning of that

13

particular language, the interpretation the Secretary

14

offers to you today flatly rejects --

MR. PHILLIPS:

JUSTICE BREYER:

The Secretary's.
No, but -- and if we were talking

11
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

about that in the context of other kinds of activities --

2

if you're back in the (a)(2) world of looking at whether

3

something's preliminary or postliminary, I have less of a

4

problem with dealing with that.

5

we're talking about (a)(1) activities, the core of what

6

Congress enacted the Portal-to-Portal Act to protect

7

employers for.

8
9

The problem is, here

The Portal-to-Portal Act is not a statute that
remotely provides protections for the employees.

This is

10

a statute that was designed to protect employers from

11

billions of dollars of liability.

12

talking about, "Under what circumstances can you ignore

13

the flat prohibition on requiring walking time to be

14

regarded as a mandatory subject of compensation?" then it

MR. PHILLIPS:

Now you skipped over "actual

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

12

MR. PHILLIPS:

13

think is an important --

You're trying to sever (1) and (2), when the

text itself joins them.

21

23

MR. PHILLIPS:

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The activities referred to in (2)

But that --

How can we possibly sever (1)

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

thing; for purposes of two, it means something else?

2

MR. PHILLIPS:

Because when the court was

3

interpreting (a)(2) in Steiner, it wasn't interpreting

4

(a)(2) to determine whether something was a postliminary

5

activity in connection with "said preliminary

6

-- primary activities."

7

not preliminary and postliminary activities, that they are

8

excluded from that.

9

with what is a third category of cases, which deals with

What it was saying is, these are

And so, the court's really coming up

10

integral and indispensable activities to a primary

11

activity.

They didn't have to analyze it as a primary

12

activity.

All they had to say was, it's not -- that the

13

preliminary and postliminary activities are not simply

14

temporal, that there is a substantive component to it.

15

And that is essentially the holding of the court

16

in Steiner.

17

therefore, we're not going to just simply look in -- time-

18

wise, whether it comes before or after principal

19

activities.

20

there are some situations that are so important that they

21

need to be compensated under (a)(2), because they don't

22

fall within preliminary or postliminary language.

23

It says there's a substantive component; and,

We're going to decide that there are some --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But, Mr. Phillips, it says it

24

-- either something is before, preliminary; or after,

25

postliminary.

And if it's neither of those, then, it

14
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

seems to me, it fits -- it's not before the principal

2

activity, and it's not after the principal activity, so

3

what else is it, other than the --

4

MR. PHILLIPS:

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

6

MR. PHILLIPS:

It's work --- principal activity?

-- that's mandatorily compensable

7

under the Fair Labor Standards Act.

8

Labor Standards Act, under this Court's interpretations

9

from Mt. Clemens Pottery and the cases that preceded it, I

10

mean, it -- you know, it had a very sweeping definition of

11

what is work within the meaning -- within the meaning of

12

what is compensable as minimum wages and as overtime.

13

that's in place.

14

Remember, the Fair

And

And now Congress has stepped in and said, "Well,

15

wait a second.

16

interpreted that broadly, we're talking about $6 billion

17

in liability."

18

talking about fairly minimal activities on the -- on the

19

-- that are involved here, triggering potentially massive

20

liabilities.

21

from those massive liabilities the walking, riding, and

22

traveling time, because that's the basis on which you end

up with big numbers.

statute.

5

But the statute -- that's nowhere in the

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

Well, I mean, that -- but

6

that's -- this Court's decision in Steiner was the one

7

that reached out to decide that "integral and

8

indispensable" was a category of activities that were

9

going to be compensable, even though, on the face of them,

10
11

they may have appeared to be -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, unless they were

12

saying those activities were, in fact, principal

13

activities.

14

principal activity, it is a principal activity, and that

15

at least is more consistent with the statute in keeping it

16

in two categories rather than inventing a third.

If it's integral, if it's embraced by the

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I don't think that creates

18

any particular problem, but what you end up doing, Mr.

19

Chief Justice, under those circumstances, is, you

20

completely eliminate the protection that Congress meant to

21

provide here for walking, riding, and traveling time,

22

which is -- which is a vital consideration --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, how does -- how

24

does your analysis apply?

25

to change their equipment several times during the course

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

MR. PHILLIPS:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You mean after they've -Yes, I mean, the --

-- arrived at the actual place --- the equipment is only

6

good for, you know, an hour, two hours, then they have to

7

get new ones.

They have to walk back to the place --

8

MR. PHILLIPS:

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Right.
-- they have to doff the

10

other equipment, don new equipment, and walk back.

11

Wouldn't your analysis say that that walking time is

excluded?

MR. PHILLIPS:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

MR. PHILLIPS:

the argument that once you, for the first time, arrive at

your actual place of performing the principal activity for

which you were hired, which is cutting beef or whatever it

19

happens to be in your hypothetical -- once you arrive

there, that does begin the workday.

21

of what starts the workday, which is why I -- to our mind,

this is a much clearer and brighter-line rule.

We can

Kennedy.

of clothing.

That's not --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

7

MR. PHILLIPS:

8

But the problem --

-- the understanding of

"principal activity."

9

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Mr. Phillips, the problem I

10

continue to have is that I thought Steiner embraced,

11

explicitly, the notion that principal activity embraces

12

all activities that are integral and indispensable.

13

take issue with that, but do you want us to overrule

14

Steiner --

it?

No.

MR. PHILLIPS:

What was so unusual

They're pretty common.

Well, no, I -- the notion that if

7

you didn't shower and change, you would expose not only

8

yourself, but your family and everybody else to the risks

9

of lead poisoning is a pretty extraordinary --

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

11

MR. PHILLIPS:

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, but the --

-- the routine where you

13

have to don, you know, safety equipment, and you have to

14

shower when you're done, whether it's being -- the

15

meatpacking or the stuff at Steiner -- that's a pretty

16

common occurrence.

17

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right, well, I would -- I would

18

argue that you could make a -- you could make a claim that

19

none of that donning and doffing ought to be compensable.

20

And, candidly, we've made that argument.

21

unfortunately, the court didn't grant the petition on that

22

particular -- on that particular question.

23

take it as a given.

exactly the reason you identify, Mr. Chief Justice, that

does create a problem.

MR. PHILLIPS:

But I still don't think that,

10

even if you accept that that is compensable conduct within

11

the meaning of Steiner, which I -- that's what it's

12

talking about -- but Steiner, Justice O'Connor, doesn't

13

say anything about the fact that there was going to have

14

to be walking or traveling, or the workday.

15

Steiner, clearly had in mind the workplace, where you're

16

producing batteries.

17

opinion that says, "This is where you really do the work.

18

That's your battery, and here's where you're going to get

19

-- engage in activities that we think you need to be

20

compensated."

21

you were entitled to the walking time between those two.

22

And, if you go back to 790.7(g), that language

23

specifically told every employer that simply because you

24

have to pay for certain kinds of activities at the outset,

25

because they're integral and indispensable, as decided by

MR. PHILLIPS:

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, again, if the Court decided

you assume that, that that's integral and indispensable,

2

it still isn't what triggers the time for starting the

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but isn't your -- in the

5

answer that you just gave, and an answer which you have,

6

in fact, consistently repeated, inconsistent with Steiner

10

going to allow walking and traveling time to be included

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

2
3

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

4

As the previous questioning suggests, the

5

outcome of this case follows directly from Steiner.

6

Portal Act, by its terms, applies only to activities that

7

occur before the commencement of -- before the

8

commencement of, or after the conclusion of, the

9

employees' principal activities.

The

Steiner holds that

10

donning and doffing, such as in this case, is "part of" --

11

that's a quote -- the employees' principal activities, and

12

it, therefore, follows that the Portal Act applies only to

13

activities either prior to, or after, that donning and

14

doffing.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But why isn't walking from the

16

gate of the -- of the factory to the -- to the place where

17

you're on the assembly line, why isn't that integral and

18

essential to the performing of the activities?

19

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Because -- and this is the

20

language that Mr. Phillips is referring to in Steiner --

21

4(a)(1) itself makes clear that a walk will not be the

22

first principal activity, including on the theory that

23

it's integral and indispensable.

24

activity has to be something other than a walk, and that's

25

what happens in this case.

The first principal

As in Steiner, there is

principal activities --

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's part of the

No, no, but if -- once you

4

accept the theory that the principal activity includes

5

those things that are integral, you can say walking from

6

the gate of the plant to the assembly line is part of the

7

principal activity.

8

part of the -- may not be part of the principal activity,

9

but -- I --

10

Now, walking to the gate may not be

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Two reasons, Justice Scalia.

11

The first is the one that I gave, and that is, the Steiner

12

Court concluded that -- and that was the end of the

13

sentence, where it said, "except as excluded by 4(a)(1),"

14

that Congress made clear in 4(a)(1) -- that the initial

15

walk wouldn't be the first principal activity.

16

the walk won't be integral and indispensable.

17

for whether or not something is integral and indispensable

18

is whether it's work that's required and closely related

19

to the productive activities.

20

donning station is not.

Justice Scalia, you made the point, and I simply

19

want to reinforce it, that the reference in -- to

20

"principal activities" in 4(a)(2) is the same as the

21

reference to "principal activities" in 4(a)(1), but it's

22

also the reference to principal activities in the

23

concluding clause of section 4.

24
25

If I could just take the Court to that.

The

statute is obviously reproduced in a variety of places,

32
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

but it's also at page 3 of our brief.

2

And so, after 4(a)(1) and 4(a)(2), there's this

3

concluding clause, and the text frames the workday.

4

it says that the Portal Act, 4(a)(1) and (2), will apply

5

to activities which occur -- I'm quoting now -- "which

6

occur either prior to the time on any particular workday

7

at which such employee commences, or subsequent to the

8

time on any particular workday at which he ceases, such

9

principal activity or activities."

And

And it simply follows,

10

as a matter of the plain text, that when Steiner held that

11

those activities, "such principal activities," include the

12

donning and the doffing, that everything that happens

13

between those two events is not encompassed by the Portal

14

Act.

Congress made some choices about things that were going to

It's worth noting that Congress drew a

right now, today, the employers have no incentive to adopt

line that the Department has in required clothes changing

that is, there isn't a predonning wait in the Alvarez

agency's footnote that flatly contradicts your theory of

mean that travel between the clothes changing place and

ORAL ARGUMENT OF IRVING L. GORNSTEIN

4

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES

5
6
7

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Portal Act excludes walking time from

8

compensation only when it occurs outside the workday,

9

before an employee commences, or after he ceases, his

10

principal activities.

11

"principal activities" includes activities that are an

12

integral and indispensable part of the principal

13

activities.

14

integral and indispensable parts of the principal

15

activities of the employees, then walking that occurs

16

after donning, and before doffing, occurs within the

17

workday, and it is not excluded from compensation by the

18

Portal Act.

And Steiner held that the term

It follows that when donning and doffing are

19

Now, the employers in these cases have argued

20

that the term "principal activities" does not encompass

21

activities that are integral and indispensable parts

22

thereof, and that Steiner did not so hold.

23

very outset of its opinion, the Court, in Steiner, posed

24

the question presented as whether changing clothes and

25

showering are compensable as part of the employee's

But, at the

46
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

principal activities, and had answered that question

2

several pages later by stating that it agreed with the

3

conclusion of the court of appeals in that case that the

4

term "principal activities" includes activities that are

5

an integral and indispensable part of the principal

6

activities, and that the activities in question in that

7

case fit within that description.

8
9

Now, that was the only textual basis on which
the Court could have reached the conclusion that it did,

10

because, if the only principal activities in that case had

11

occurred on the production floor, then the changing of

12

clothes at the beginning of the day, and the showering at

13

the end of the day, necessarily would have been

14

preliminary to and postliminary to said principal

15

activities, and thereby expressly excluded from

16

compensation.

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What if I think that opinion

18

was just flatly wrong, that Congress, when it referred to

19

the "principal activity or activities," was talking about

20

the cutting of the meat or whatever the employer hired the

21

person to do?

22

if I think that?

23

be an erroneous decision beyond its narrow holding?

24
25

He didn't hire him to put on clothes.

What

Why do I have to extend what I think to

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Justice Scalia, we are not

asking for an extension of what you would regard as an

term "principal activities" as the Court interpreted it in

then you are -- the plain language of the statute tells

10

you that that time is not -- is compensable when it occurs

11

after donning and before doffing.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why can't I say that Steiner

13

requires that interpretation of what constitutes a

14

"principal activity" only for purposes of determining what

15

is compensable, and that when we -- when we come to

16

examine the separate question, of when the workday begins,

17

we can -- we can apply, as far as precedent is concerned,

18

a different interpretation of what is a "principal

19

activity"?

20

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Because the term "principal

21

activity," I believe, as, you yourself, pointed out, is

22

listed in the first -- at (a)(1).

23

it appears.

24

(a)(2) and in the concluding sentence, it says "said

25

principal activities."

That's the first place

1

that the term "principal activities" has to mean the same

thing everywhere it appears.

3

interpreted that term, in Steiner, to include "integral

4

and indispensable activities," that terminology has to

5

appear everywhere in the statute.

agree that just because it's a compensable activity

8

doesn't necessarily mean that there isn't going to be a

9

break in the workday?

People have talked about the dog

10

example, and there are others.

11

you're talking about is the determination that this is a

12

principal activity.

13

second question, which is, How do we tell if the space in

14

time between two different principal activities, and

15

they're two very different types of activities, is a break

16

or part of the continuous workday?

17

MR. GORNSTEIN:

I mean, and -- so, all

It seems that there's a separate --

Well, first of all, that

18

question arises not under the Portal Act, which only

19

applies before the principal activities begin and after

20

they end, but under the Fair Labor Standards Act, itself.

21

And that question would be governed by the Court's prior

22

decisions on what constitutes hours worked, together with

23

the Department of Labor's regulations that address what

24

constitute hours worked.

25

what the Department of Labor has said is, generally,

And -- within the workday -- and

1

everything within the workday is compensable, except for a

2

meal period and except for a time period where there is a

3

break that is so substantial that the employees can

4

effectively use that time for their own purposes.

5

it says things like 5- to 20-minute breaks are not periods

6

where the employee is not working, but they are resting

7

for the further work.

8

And so, that would be an issue that would arise when you

9

had a break that was much longer than that, probably at

And so,

That is common in the industry.

10

least a half hour, where you can actually effectively use

11

that time for your own purposes and are not required,

12

essentially, to stay around on the employer's premises and

13

to wait or rest to begin your work anew.

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So --

I take it you then agree that

15

the answer for which you argue here follows not merely

16

from the text of 4(a), but the text of 4(a) plus a

17

continuous -- some variety of a continuous workday rule.

18

MR. GORNSTEIN:

JUSTICE SOUTER:

20

MR. GORNSTEIN:

That's correct.
You've got to have both.
That you -- that you have to

21

have a work under the Fair Labor Standards Act, and

22

then you have to have the exclusion from that not apply.

23

JUSTICE SOUTER:

24

MR. GORNSTEIN:

25

Yes.
The issue here, the exclusion

doesn't apply, and nobody has raised the question about

11

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Yes.

On the -- on the waiting

12

before the clothes, there's -- there are two series of

13

waits: the first wait and then later waits.

14

later waits, once you decide that the donning begins the

process of principal activities --

The initial wait -You don't think that's

covered.

22

MR. GORNSTEIN:

We do think that's covered.

And

23

under -- the Department of Labor's approach is to treat a

24

required wait for an activity as an integral part of that

25

activity.

So, if that activity is, itself, compensable as

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Is that

If -Is that a required -- or not?

And, if it is, where does it say that in the regs?
MR. GORNSTEIN:

It's a required wait anytime, in

24

order to get to the production floor on time, the employee

25

has to be at the donning station in a sufficient period of

52
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

then he's being required to wait.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

13

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

14
15

MR. PHILLIPS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

I

just have a couple of points I'd like to make.

16

First, Justice Breyer, I want to start with the

17

waiting times.

18

spend much time talking about them.

19

answer that the Solicitor General's Office has offered

20

with respect to the waiting time simply illustrates the

21

expandable nature of the workday.

22

Justice Ginsburg -- or, no Justice O'Connor specifically asked

23

that question, "You're not saying that waiting time prior

24

to engaging in a primary activity, in fact, starts the

25

workday."

I didn't actually have an opportunity to
But I think the

Their position --

And the answer is, absolutely, it does, because

55
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

they find that everything that is integral and

2

indispensable triggers the start of the workday.

3

it into fairly graphic terms.

4

order to put on a coat in order to go onto the floor in

5

order to do your services, then the waiting time for that

6

coat counts.

7

earplugs in order to get to the place where you have to

8

get the coat, not only do putting in the earplugs count,

9

under that theory, but, if you have to wait, you have

So, to put

If you have to show up in

If, however, you also have to put in

10

that, and that extends the workday, and all of the walking

11

in between there.

12

So, if you're asking, "Is this going to become a

13

significant liability?" the answer is clearly yes.

14

very significant compensable acts -- and, indeed, in this

15

context, some of those compensable acts were found by the

16

jury to be utterly diminimus -- you're going to end up

17

with significant waiting time, and you're going to end up

18

with significant walking time.

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

For

Was the predonning waiting

issue decided below?
MR. PHILLIPS:

Yes, Justice O'Connor, they

22

specifically held that all of the waiting time is not --

23

it is to be excluded.

24

790.7(g), before you get to the footnote -- because that's

25

the tag to the footnote -- as to what is -- what is the

And they did that on the basis of

56
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

ordinary meaning of wait -- of preliminary and

2

postliminary for waiting time?

3

that if you're waiting to get your check, and if you're

4

waiting to check in, the recognition is that those --

5

those are completely fortuitous, just as it is here.

6

There's nobody who structured this arrangement so that you

7

will end up spending time waiting.

8

designed to get people in as efficiently --

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

10

MR. PHILLIPS:

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And the expectation is

Indeed, the scheme is

They decided --

-- as possible.
-- no waiting time.

They

12

didn't decide "if" waiting time -- "which" waiting time.

13

But they said no -- it's irrelevant whether it's before or

14

after, because waiting time isn't covered.

15

see how they specifically decided, yes, waiting time is

16

covered, but not --.

17

MR. PHILLIPS:

So, I don't

Well, I think, Justice Ginsburg,

18

if they specifically decide that there is no waiting time

19

that's covered here, and the plaintiffs have sought

20

compensation for both pre- and post-waiting time, then the

21

issue is squarely posed, and they've certainly posed it in

22

their petition, and the Court granted it.

23

obviously, you're free to decline to decide issues, but it

24

seems to me that one is posed.

I want to --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

below said waiting time isn't covered, so we're not going

3

to engage in any debate about what -- if waiting time is -

4

- were covered, which waiting time?

5

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right, but that just goes to the

6

question -- I think it disposes of the issue of, if you

7

have waiting time that otherwise looks to be fairly

8

ordinary preliminary/postliminary activity, it,

9

nevertheless, can be converted into primary activity under

things -- two things that Steiner focused on -- it focused

be situations where you're going to be able to bargain

21

away clothes changing.

22

where, for some -- for -- in some circumstances, because

you've bargained away compensation for clothes changing,
