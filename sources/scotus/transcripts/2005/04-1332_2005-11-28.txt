ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

We'll hear argument

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

10

In enacting the Federal Tort Claims Act,

11

Congress recognized that suits against Federal

12

employees, based upon their official conduct,

13

constituted a very real attack upon the morale of the

14

Civil Service.

15

ways.

16

States directly, but secondly and importantly, it

17

provided that a plaintiff who took up that opportunity,

18

the judgment in the suit against the United States

19

would constitute a complete bar to any action against

20

the employee.

21

Congress addressed that concern in two

First, it allowed plaintiffs to sue the United

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And in enacting

22

section 1291, Congress specified that only final

23

decisions would be appealable.

24
25

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

That's right, Your

Honor, and this Court has adopted a practical rather

3
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

than technical construction of that statute.

2

Court has recognized in -- in numerous cases that

3

claims of official immunity are -- warrant immediate

4

appellate review because they can only be effectively

5

vindicated by review at the motion to dismiss stage.

6

And the

And -- and that is the kind of protection

7

that section 2676 provides.

8

judgment in the suit against the United States shall be

9

a complete bar against any action against the employee.

10

So it's the action itself that is precluded, and it is

11

precluded completely.

12

It establishes that the

And that --

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, you can -- you can say

13

the same thing of -- of res judicata, that there is a

14

complete bar.

15

seems to be, with respect to the employee, something

16

much closer to a res judicata case than to an immunity

17

per se case.

18

I guess my concern here is that this

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

Well, Your Honor,

19

the -- the Court recognized in the Digital Equipment

20

case that even a claim of res judicata could correctly

21

be characterized as a right to be free from suit, but

22

it said that that wasn't enough.

23

the importance of the -- of the value protected, and

24

the --

25

One had to look at

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

And -- and the Court

JUSTICE SCALIA:

4

(Laughter.)

5

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

6

And the Court has recognized in any number of

So do I.

I'm sure you do.

7

cases that claims of official immunity are the kind

8

that present sufficiently important public interests to

9

warrant an exception to the -- the otherwise rule that

10

appeals can only be had at the final judgment.

11

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

But in Digital Equipment,

12

I think that we said that the collateral order doctrine

13

is narrow, it should stay that way, and that we should

14

give it -- we should be very reluctant to expand the

15

practical construction of section 1291.

16

certainly would be an expansion, would it not?

17

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

And this

Well, I don't think

18

so, Your Honor, because this is like the other claims

19

of immunity that the Court has recognized warrant

20

collateral appeal in Mitchell v. Forsyth or Nixon v.

21

Fitzgerald.

22

It's a kind of official --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's certainly broader --

23

it's certainly broader than res judicata anyway, isn't

24

it?

25

Government is dismissed on jurisdictional grounds, what

Because if the Government -- suit against the

would be res judicata is only the jurisdictional

2

question, and -- and this doesn't -- this goes beyond

3

that, doesn't it?

4

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

That's right, Your

5

Honor.

6

section 2676 confers an immunity on employees that is

7

broader than the traditional common law rule of res

8

judicata.

9

suit against another party that could not have been

We point out any number of ways in which

For example, res judicata would not bar a

10

joined in the first suit, but by its plain terms,

11

section 2676 would bar such a claim.

12

Likewise, common law res judicata would not

13

bar a second suit to -- to recover a kind of damages

14

that were unavailable in the first, but whereas

15

punitive damages are unavailable in a suit against the

16

United States, section 2676 would plainly bar a second

17

suit against the employee to cover punitive damages.

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, I'm -- I'm assuming

19

that it's not res judicata in -- in the narrow sense of

20

the doctrine, but it's -- it's still a bar that depends

21

upon a -- a prior judgment.

22

sort of res judicata-like.

23

there is no immunity in the first instance conferred

24

directly on the employee as such.

25

that's why I -- it seems to me that there's an argument

And in that respect, it's
Conversely, there is --

And so that's --

6
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

that this is a lot closer to res judicata than it is to

2

classic immunity.

3

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

Well, certainly

4

there is no categorical rule that claims in the nature

5

of claim preclusion are not eligible for immediate

6

appeal under collateral order.

7

States, for example, the Court upheld immediate appeal

8

of the denial of a -- of a double jeopardy claim, which

9

likewise depends upon the existence of a prior action.

10

JUSTICE SOUTER:

In Abney v. United

But a double jeopardy claim

11

is -- is a claim in which there is an -- a -- an

12

immunity textually conferred by the -- the

13

Constitution, or at least, we -- we have thought it --

14

the guarantee does not make an awful lot of practical

15

sense, unless you read it that way.

16

that -- that situation here.

17

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

You don't have

Well, the

18

Constitution does not use the word immunity, nor does

19

the Westfall Act use the word immunity.

20

there's no immunity.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

1

there would have been no immunity at all if you'd sued

2

the officers directly and not brought that Federal Tort

3

Claims Act suit first.

4

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

That's right.

Like

5

the claim of double jeopardy in Abney, the claim of

6

immunity here depends upon the existence of a prior

7

litigation, but as in Abney, the -- the interests that

8

it protects are the interests to be free from the --

9

the cost burdens distraction of litigation.

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I -- I take it

11

Justice Ginsburg's point -- and it's my concern as well

12

-- is that if the Bivens action is brought first,

13

there's no protection of the Government against

14

multiple actions.

15

arguing for just is dependent on which suit happens to

16

be brought first.

17
18
19

So -- so the policy that you're

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

Well, I'm not sure

that -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And that's not -- that's

20

not a very strong policy interest to vindicate by

21

expanding the collateral order doctrine.

22

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

Well, it -- it's --

23

it's not entirely clear that the United States would be

24

subject to a second suit.

25

susceptibility of the United States to a further suit

8
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

would be governed by collateral --

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, it depends on -- it

3

depends on -- on how the case was resolved.

4

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

5

That's -- that's

right.

6

But -- but what's important here is that the

7

interest protected is the interest of the employee

8

against the -- the distraction -- against the attack on

9

morale.

10

That was the language that the Assistant

Attorney General used.

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It's hard to accept that

12

argument given that if the lawyer had sued in the

13

reverse order, there would be the same morale.

14

rest would follow.

15

All the

So here it's -- it's a question of the lawyer

16

brought the wrong lawsuit first, and the attack on the

17

morale -- there's no difference if a Bivens action had

18

been brought and no other action.

19

is this morale changed by the Government having gotten

20

the first case dismissed for lack of subject matter

21

jurisdiction with no consideration of the merits at

22

all?

23

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

Is there any -- why

Well, Your Honor,

24

the -- the statute protects against the -- the cost of

25

repetitive litigation, the harassment of the employee

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

of multiple suits.

interest that the Court has recognized --

These are the exact same types of

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What was the harassment

that this employee experienced in the -- in the FTCA

5

claim that was dismissed?

6

9

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

It -- well, in this

particular FTCA claim, there -- there was no discovery.
But as we point out in -- in our brief, FTCA cases,
even those dismissed on the basis of the 2680

10

exceptions, are often resolved only after years of

11

litigation, including often trial.

12

harassment is -- is the same.

13

So -- so the

On -- on respondents' view, the judgment bar

14

would not kick in.

Airlines, where this Court upheld the Government's

16

assertion of the -- the discretionary function

17

exception only after 8 years of litigation when the

18

case had been -- gone to the Ninth Circuit two times

19

where there had been a trial and final judgment and --

20

For example, in a case like Varig

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Did that -- did that

21

involve the employee or it was just legal argument

22

involving lawyers representing the United States?

23

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

It would certainly

24

involve the employee.

25

inevitably involve the employee in discovery, in -- in

Any trial would -- would

2

The -- the Government also is protected by

3

section 2676, as the Assistant Attorney General said.

4

The -- the burden on the Government, because the

5

Government is often called upon to defend employees

6

against suit -- and -- and the Government, having

7

litigated once and obtained a judgment in the first

8

FTCA suit, should not be forced to expend all those

9

resources again in a second suit, this time styled as

10

one against the employee.

11

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Counsel, can I ask you sort

12

of a basic question that I don't really think is

13

adequately addressed in the briefs?

14

understand it, that the exception in 2680(c) covers

15

this case.

16

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

17

JUSTICE STEVENS:

You contend, as I

Yes.

And 2680 -- the

18

introductory language of 2680 is the provisions of this

19

chapter shall not apply to such cases.

20

true that 2676 is in this chapter, and does it not,

21

therefore, follow that 2676 does not apply to this

22

case?

23

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

And is it not

2676 makes the --

24

the scope of its application turn on whether there has

25

been a judgment and an action under section 1346(b).

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But my first question is

2

how does 2676 apply if it's in the chapter that 2680

3

says shall not apply to -- to things in the exception?

4

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

Well, Your Honor,

5

the -- that view of the language, shall not apply,

6

would be inconsistent with this Court's decisions both

7

in United States v. Smith and in FDIC v. Meyer.

8
9

In United States v. Smith, for example, the
plaintiffs had made exactly that argument with respect

10

to shall not apply.

11

not apply to an action that arises in a foreign

12

country.

13

remedy to which we are supposed to be limited.

14

Court rejected precisely that argument.

15

They said that -- that 1346 shall

Therefore, section 1346 cannot provide the

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And the

But they held that the --

16

the action simply didn't apply in -- in that case.

17

There was no -- there was no recovery under the --

18

basically it held the foreign -- foreign country

19

exception precluded the statute from applying --

20

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

21

JUSTICE STEVENS:

22
23

Well, what they --

-- which is what also

happens here.
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

Well, take another

24

example why -- why you couldn't read the -- the shall

25

not apply language in that way.

The first exclusivity

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

provision of section 2679(a) with respect to sue and

2

be sued agencies -- if you said that 1346(b) shall not

3

apply to a suit against the Postal Service because the

4

suits against the Postal Service regarding miscarriage

5

of letters is excluded from 1346(b) by that same

6

language, shall not apply, well, that would render the

7

Postal Service exception meaningless and you would sue

8

the -- the Postal Service pursuant to its sue and be

9

sued authority instead of suing the United States under

10

1346(b).

11
12
13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Go -- go through that again,

would you?
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

The -- the --

14

2679(a) says that the authority of an agency to sue and

15

be sued in its own name shall not extend to claims

16

cognizable under section 1346(b).

17

be made, with respect to a suit against the Postal

18

Service for miscarriage of the mail, that -- that claim

19

is not cognizable under section 1346(b) because section

20

2680(b) says that 1346(b) shall not apply to claims

21

relating to the miscarriage of mail.

22

reading of shall not apply, one would come to the

23

conclusion that -- that the claim relating to the

24

miscarriage of mail is not cognizable under 1346(b),

25

and therefore you sue the -- the Postal Service.

The argument might

JUSTICE STEVENS:

No.

It only says it shall

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

And -- and a -- a

4

claim with respect to the miscarriage of mail is one

5

that comes within the exception.

6

of shall not apply has been rejected by the Court in

7

Smith v. United States, likewise is inconsistent with

the Court's decision, FDIC v. Meyer, and would render

it simply ridiculous with respect to claims against the

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

I guess it's true, is it --

12

I'm testing my own understanding of this -- that if, in

13

fact, shall not apply meant anything in that chapter,

14

if you had a State and that State gave a State law

15

remedy for, say, detaining property or for loss of mail

16

or something, then that State law remedy would continue

17

in existence because the thing in the law that sets

18

aside that State court remedy is a different part of

19

the same chapter --

20

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

23
24
25

That's right.

-- in 2679(b)?
Right.

And -- and

-JUSTICE BREYER:

But the whole point of the

Westfall Act is to get rid of those State causes of

1-800-FOR-DEPO

action.

2

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

Exactly, and in that

3

sense, that reading of shall not apply is simply

4

inconsistent with the Court's holding in United States

5

v. Smith.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

But the language does seem

to say it.
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

Well, I think what

it -- what it means is that -- what it -- what it has

10

been understood to mean is that the United States'

11

waiver of sovereign immunity.

12

has not subjected itself to liability on claims of the

13

nature of those exceptions.

14

has described it in any number of cases, that the

15

exceptions in 2680 mark the limits of the extent to

16

which the United States --

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

It -- the United States

And that's how the Court

All right.

Well, then --

18

then to get to the main point here, if we are going to

19

get to that, the question that I would have for you is

20

-- is the following.

21

it's pretty anomalous.

22

Bivens action first, of course, can sue the individual

23

employee, and you agree to that.

24

Bivens action second, because he made a mistake and

25

went into the wrong court or he brought the wrong

If we accept your interpretation,
I mean, someone who brings his

But if he brings his

action or it was a borderline case, frankly, and he

2

didn't know how it would end up, that person is out of

3

luck.

4

Now, there's nothing in this statute that

5

says that the Government -- that the Congress wanted to

6

achieve that result.

7

shouldn't really make any difference here.

8

action is totally different from all the other tort

9

actions in that respect, and it's listed separately in

10

What order you bring the suit in
The Bivens

2679 to make clear that it isn't -- it is different.

11

So why?

I mean, why read it your way?

The

12

burden that reading it their way would impose on the

13

Government is minuscule.

14

tiny, I would imagine.

15
16

All right.

The number of such suits is

Now, what is wrong with my

question?

17

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

19

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

20
21

Well, there --

A lot of things.
-- there are any

number of things wrong in our view.
First, Congress has, as Your Honor

22

recognized, created an express exception for Bivens

23

claims in 2679(b), but it has created no similar

24

exception to -- to 2676 even though prior to passage of

25

the Westfall Act, any number of courts of appeals had

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

1

construed 2676 to apply to Bivens claims.

2

Further, as respondents recognize, 2676's

3

application at this point is virtually limited because

4

of the Westfall Act to a second case that raises a

5

Bivens claim.

6

So their --

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

Well, the -- the

3

consistent view of the courts of appeals and district

4

courts over 50 years has been that the judgment bar

5

does have some application even when the claims are

6

litigated simultaneously.

7

universal rule among those courts of appeals that have

8

decided the issue that if the plaintiff obtains a

9

judgment against the United States, that that judgment

10

For example, it's the

immediately --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

12

before we get to a judgment.

13

brought?

14
15
16

But I want you to go back
Can such a suit be

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

Can it be brought?

It can be brought.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Could this lawyer have

17

brought the FTCA act complaint and pled in the

18

alternative the Bivens claim?

19

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

It -- it can

20

certainly be brought because the judgment bar only

21

comes into effect when there's been a judgment.

22

could be brought.

23

So it

But as I was saying, the -- the courts are

24

unanimous in holding that if both of those claims were

25

to proceed through litigation and to trial and there

were to be a judgment in the action under the FTCA

2

against the United States, that that would immediately

3

bar any recovery against the employee.

4

the view, again, for some 50 years now.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And that's been
So --

Counsel, what if the

6

first case against the Government were dismissed

because of a finding that the employee was acting

beyond the scope of his authority?

10

individual capacity?

11
12

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

Well, in -- in a

footnote --

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

14

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

15

Should that really

I read your --- in our brief we

suggest it might not --

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I read footnote 5.

17

You said it didn't.

18

consistent with the language of the statute.

19

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

But I don't see how that's

And -- and in fact,

20

in -- in re-reading FDIC v. Meyer in preparation for

21

oral argument, footnote 7 of that decision suggests

22

that that would be a judgment in an action under

23

1346(b).

24

nonetheless, be cognizable under 1346(b) because the

25

allegation was that they were acting within the scope.

FDIC v. Meyer was saying that it would,

19
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

So -- so perhaps we should not have conceded that.

2

But it could still be that the -- the

3

judgment bar wouldn't apply.

4

-- under -- a judgment in an action under 1346(b), but

5

the judgment bar protects an employee of the

6

Government.

7

defined in the way that suggests the person acting

8

within the scope of their employment, advancing the

9

purposes of the agency.

It would be an action in

And -- and that's a defined term and it's

So there -- there might be a

10

reason why the judgment bar itself would not apply to a

11

claim where the determination was that the person was

12

not acting within the scope of employment.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Your theory would cover

14

the case where the FTCA claim drops out because the

15

employee didn't file the administrative claim within

16

the -- what is it?

17

6 months?

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

It -- Your Honor, it

18

would not, I think, cover a claim that -- where the

19

dismissal was curable, where the person could go and

20

exhaust their claim.

21

But the test of whether --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But don't they have a

22

short span where they have to bring that administrative

23

claim?

24
25

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

They have -- they

have 2 years to bring the administrative claim.

They

20
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

have 6 months to bring the suit in court after the

2

administrative claim has been resolved.

3

reason --

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And the -- the

And the suit is tossed out

5

because one of those deadlines was met.

6

follow, I think, under your reasoning that there could

7

be no subsequent Bivens claim.

8
9

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

It would

That's right.

The

-- the statute makes the test whether there has been a

10

judgment in an action under 1346(b), and plainly, under

11

any reading of that language, it means where there is a

12

judgment that finally resolves the liability of the

13

United States under section 1346(b), there has been a

14

judgment in an action under 1346(b).

15

that the language is susceptible to any other reading.

And I don't think

16

So if the claim, as Your Honor suggested, finally

17

resolves whether the United States could be liable

18

under section 1346(b), then the judgment bar applies.

19

Unless there are no further questions --

20

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I'd like to pursue the

21

question I asked you earlier because I really didn't

22

fully understand your answer.

23

read 2680, it simply says that if one of the exceptions

24

applies, there's no waiver of sovereign immunity,

25

basically.

It seems to me, as I

That's what -- what the scope of it is.

21
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

And therefore, none of the other provisions of -- of

2

this chapter apply, and if none of the provisions of

3

this chapter apply, clearly the judgment bar provision

4

is one of those.

5

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

I -- I think I'm

6

going to borrow Justice Breyer's response because it's

7

-- it's a little clearer than the -- than the point I

8

was trying to make.

9

that would mean that the provisions of 2679(b) would

10

And that -- by that same logic,

not apply to the claim, and that is --

11

JUSTICE STEVENS:

12

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

That's correct.
-- precisely the

13

question that was addressed in -- in United States v.

14

Smith, and the Court said that -- that it did apply.

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It follows that 2679(b)

16

does not apply, but you're just have -- working on a

17

blank slate with no provision of the Federal Tort

18

Claims Act affecting a waiver of sovereign immunity or

19

imposing any kind of judgment bar.

20

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

But if 2679(b) did

21

not apply, there would be no basis for substituting the

22

United States and having the claim dismissed.

23

was precisely the issue that was addressed in -- in

24

United States v. Smith.

25

read it to mean that -- that all of the provisions of

And that

So -- so plainly you cannot

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

the FTCA are simply a nullity or nugatory with respect

2

to such a claim.

3

suggested, what it means is that the United States has

4

not waived its sovereign immunity.

That -- that -- rather, as Your Honor

5

JUSTICE STEVENS:

6

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

Correct.
But in FDIC v.

7

Meyer, the Court was very clear that the FTCA is the

8

kind of case which defines jurisdiction by the scope of

9

the waiver of immunity and to -- the claims to which

10

the United States has rendered itself liable.

11

all of those issues are interrelated, and -- and it

12

reflects the substantive nature of those exclusions.

13

It could not be --

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

So -- so

But you left out one word

15

that I think is important there.

16

I'm right about this is I thought 2679(b) was focusing

17

in large part upon State tort suits.

18

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

20

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

It is true that --

the State tort suits -MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

24

Is that right?

They wanted to get rid of

21

23

To test it to see if

The -- the --

-- in part.

Am I right

about that or not?
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

2679(b) applies only

to -- to State law causes of action.

23
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

So, therefore,

2

if in fact we had words mean what they seem to mean,

3

Congress would have both removed the State lawsuits in

4

2679(b) and reinstated them or set them in the

5

exceptions.

6

itself, and therefore, that case that you're citing

7

came to a correct result.

But that would have the statute defeat

8

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's right?

10

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

12

That's right.

Okay.

I -Don't tell me it's

right if it's not right is all I want --

13

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

15

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

Well, certainly --

Okay.
-- we -- we believe

16

that United States v. Smith was right, and that shall

17

not apply cannot have the meaning that Justice Stevens

18

was trying to attribute to it for that reason.

If there are no further questions, I'd like
to reserve the balance of my time.

Thank you, counsel.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

1

please the Court:

2

To begin with, the court of appeals did not

3

have jurisdiction under the final judgment rule to

4

review the district court's order.

5

Petitioners do not contest that they could

6

have been sued under Bivens initially or that the

7

Hallocks could have filed simultaneous FTCA claims and

8

Bivens claims.

9

cannot now be sued only because the Hallocks first

Petitioners' argument is that they

10

filed a different suit against the United States.

11

situation, which hinges on the sequence of lawsuits,

12

does not describe an immunity or a right not to stand

13

trial.

14

That

Petitioners try hard to paint the purpose of

15

the judgment bar as the same as the purpose of

16

qualified immunity, avoiding distraction and inhibition

17

of Federal employees from their work.

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But --

But what -- what

19

significance do you give to the word to complete, as to

20

whether it's a complete bar?

21

that the -- the statute is -- is a bar to all -- all

22

further actions after a judgment?

23

MS. ZIEVE:

Doesn't that indicate

I don't think complete bar means

24

anything more than bar.

25

and a statute of limitations is a complete bar.

Res judicata is a complete bar
And I

25
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

-- I think the statute would mean the same thing

2

without that word.

3

And there's --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, not -- there --

4

there are exceptions to the statute of limitations.

5

You could have tolling, and there are exceptions to a

6

preclusion doctrine.

7

complete in the sense that they are without exceptions.

8
9

MS. ZIEVE:

So those doctrines aren't

That's right, but when -- when

the bar applies, it's -- it's an absolute bar.

I don't

10

-- I agree that if the bar has been triggered, it is a

11

-- it completely precludes any further action on any

12

claims, but I don't think the word complete gives us

13

much guidance about when the bar is triggered.

14

And the purpose behind the bar generally is

15

not the same as the purpose of qualified immunity

16

because although the FTCA, in general, and the

17

legislative history of the FTCA indicates that the act

18

as a whole was intended to protect employee morale and

19

distraction from employment, that's not the purpose

20

behind the judgment bar.

21

a poor vehicle for accomplishing that purpose since it

22

allows not only a Bivens suit as an initial matter and,

23

when it was enacted, allowed -- still allowed employees

24

to be sued for State torts, but also would allow two

25

suits, as long as the Bivens suit were litigated

And the judgment bar would be

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, but that -- that --

3

see, that's what's -- I'm not at all certain about

4

this, whether they have an appeal, whether they don't

5

have an appeal.

6

I'm testing it out.

But it seems to me if we take your position,

7

we're going to make things awfully complicated.

8

is, the -- the basic idea here is in the vast mine run

9

of employee suits, go sue the Government, and you can't

That

10

sue the employee at all.

11

actions.

12

ordinarily, if you sued the -- the employee, whether

13

you sued him first, second, or third, you're not

14

supposed to and he ought to have an appeal right away

15

to get you out of court.

16

That's true of the State

That's true of ordinary tort actions.

And so

Now, there is an exception there with the

17

Bivens because you can bring your suit first and then

18

there's no problem.

19

appealability rule for that, people are going to get

20

mixed up.

21

Bivens case, it has a basic objective of trying to

22

prevent people from harassing the employee because the

23

instances in which you bring a Bivens suit first, as a

24

practical matter, are probably small.

25

But if we make an exception in the

It's a kind of curlicue, and even in the

Now, what's the response to that?

I'm just

27
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

nervous about making these collateral rules so

2

complicated as to whether -- you'd have to do it

3

whether it's a Bivens suit or some other kind of suit

4

under this, and nobody is going to understand it.

5

MS. ZIEVE:

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

7

MS. ZIEVE:

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9
10

Well -So put in --

I don't --- put them in the whole bag.

Say give the employee his appeal because most of the
time it's totally to help him from being harassed.

11

Now, what's the answer to that?

12

-- I'm putting it because I want to get your answer.

13

MS. ZIEVE:

And I'm not

Well, a couple things.

First of

14

all, the -- the bar to State law tort suits is in

15

2679(b), which was passed in 1988, 42 years after the

16

judgment bar and the -- and the bulk of FTCA.

17

passed as an express effort to overturn this Court's

18

decision in Westfall, which held that employees did not

19

have immunity from State law -- certain State law

20

torts.

21

section 2 of the statute, Congress specifically called

22

2679(b) an immunity provision, and this Court has since

23

recognized that, for instance, in Gutierrez de

24

Martinez.

25

indicating immunity for -- for -- under 2676.

It was

And in the findings that are incorporated into

There is no comparable legislative history

28
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

So I -- I don't think it's that complicated

2

to figure out now whether someone is proceeding --

3

whether the claim arises -- whether the claim to

4

appealability, whether the defense arises under 2679(b)

5

or under the judgment bar because they just really get

6

at very different things.

7

-- there's not a lot of case law in either direction,

8

but the -- the courts haven't exhibited much confusion

9

about that.

And the courts haven't shown

10

The other thing is that when you're -- when

11

you're construing the scope of the judgment bar, it's

12

important to remember that this was passed in 1946, and

13

it was intended -- at that time some 25 years -- 35

14

years before Bivens, what the -- what Congress was

15

getting at was State law suits against the employees

16

versus State law suits against the United States.

17

the effort was to shift the liability to the United

18

States.

19

morale, to protect employees from being distracted, but

20

that -- that was, again, the purpose of the shift of

21

liability, the waiver of sovereign immunity in general.

22

The only real explanation of the judgment bar

And

That effort to shift liability, yes, was for

23

appears in the background of where the drafters

24

explained that the bar is intended to -- as a bar to --

25

bar to further suit not only against the Government, as

29
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

1

would have been true under the prior bill.

2

around page 14 of my brief, the quote from -- from the

3

1945 report.

4

against the Government, as would have been true under

5

the prior version, but also against the employee.

6

there was no bar to suit in the prior version of the

7

bill.

8

been referring to the normal operation of res judicata.

9

This is

Not -- a bar to liability not only

And

So the drafters' explanation could only have

And this Court has used res judicata in Digital as

10

sort of the quintessential example of a defense that is

11

not subject to immediate appeal.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

Your rule would be this.

13

It's such a complicated area.

14

plaintiff brings a lawsuit, tort suit, against a

15

Government employee and the Westfall Act bars the

16

lawsuit, period, you can't sue him at all because of --

17

of (b).

18

court doesn't agree.

19

MS. ZIEVE:

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm sorry.

But if a

He gets an immediate appeal if the district

That's -But if under the Westfall

21

Act you could sue him, depending on the order, he

22

doesn't get an appeal.

23

MS. ZIEVE:

That's right because defense is

24

based on the order of suits.

25

defenses, and preclusion defenses are not immediately

Those are preclusion

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

appealable.

2

the Court's decision in -- in Irwin that -- that

3

certain defenses that are available to private parties

4

in litigation should also be available, treated the

5

same way, have the same rules when the Government is

6

being sued like a private party.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And, you know, I think this follows from

What -- what's wrong

8

with the Government's distinction of Digital that here

9

you have a policy embodied in a statute as opposed to a

10
11

private settlement agreement?
MS. ZIEVE:

The -- Digital explains that if

12

you have a right not to stand trial that is set forth

13

in a statute or constitutional provision, that the

14

court isn't going to second-guess the importance of

15

that right.

16

importance prong of the collateral order test should be

17

part of -- part of that effective reviewability or

18

whether it's part of the second prong about separate

19

from the merits of the case.

It's -- it's unclear whether the

20

But in any event, what Digital doesn't say is

21

just because something is in a statute -- a right is in

22

a statute -- it's -- it -- it is correct to

23

characterize it as a right not to stand trial.

24

contrary, Digital cautions that anything -- so many

25

defenses could be called rights not to stand trial, and

To the

31
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

so the court will look -- will apply the test very

2

stringently.

3

Statute of limitations, for instance, are in

4

statutes and when the statute has expired, you could

5

say that is a statutory bar to a right to stand trial.

6

But statute of limitations, like the res judicata

7

defense, are just not appealable under the collateral

8

order doctrine.

9

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, I suppose if there

10

was no appellate court jurisdiction, we're not going to

11

resolve the merits of that question.

12

MS. ZIEVE:

That's right.

If there's no

13

appellate court jurisdiction, the Court doesn't have to

14

go on to construe the scope of the judgment bar.

15

--

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But

Well, you would at the end

17

of the road.

18

if the plaintiffs prevail, you could still appeal from

19

that and say that that suit was barred.

20

never have gone forward.

21

If -- if you go to the Bivens claim and

MS. ZIEVE:

It should

That's right, Justice Ginsburg,

22

and that's exactly why this defense is effectively

reviewable after final judgment as opposed to now.

lot of time going through the whole trial to find out

the answer.

MS. ZIEVE:

It's there but you've wasted a

That's true to this -- just as is

5

true with defenses based on statute of limitations or

6

res judicata or, you know, a whole host of defenses --

MS. ZIEVE:

made to do that or --

The district court could have

certified it and -- and --

motion to certify because the issue is clear in my

view, but if you think you have a collateral order

doctrine, then go ahead and take your appeal.

MS. ZIEVE:

Well, I don't think he expressed

any view about whether the case satisfied the Cohen

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is it -- is it --

maybe this is an incorrect way to look at it, but there

is a relationship between the merits and the

interlocutory review decision.

6

7

words, adopted a fairly clear and categorical rule --

8

the need for an interlocutory appeal would diminish

9

because the district courts would almost always get it

11

I would suppose if we

right.
But if we adopt a standard for the

12

application of this bar that, you know, depends on a

13

lot of different things, then the appellate court is

14

going to disagree with the district court in a greater

15

number of circumstances, and maybe we should allow an

16

interlocutory review of that.

17

MS. ZIEVE:

The Court's cases allowing and

18

disallowing collateral order appeals don't turn on the

19

-- the litigation efficiencies that will be obtained if

20

the court goes forward, but rather on whether the issue

are the preferred ways to go rather than stretching the

6

language.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Perhaps you should go on

8

now to the question, assuming that it is immediately

9

appealable.

10

MS. ZIEVE:

If the Court reaches the second

11

question, the res judicata foundation of the bar shows

12

as well why the Second Circuit's decision on the

13

substantive question should be affirmed.

14

The -- the text -- the language of the text

15

uses classic res judicata terminology, judgment and

16

bar, and the historical context of the statute makes

17

that reading by far the most reasonable.

18

The -- when the act was passed in -- in 1946,

19

until then, Federal employees had been sued for State

20

law torts, the biggest category of cases involving auto

21

accidents with postal workers.

22

trying to waive sovereign immunity so that the

23

Government could step in to defend the suits and be

24

sued in their place, which it thought was fair and

25

would help morale.

And Congress set about

And so that plaintiffs would no

1

2

was considered a -- a burden.

3

When the -- when the -- the FTCA allows the

4

United States to stand in the shoes of the employee for

5

purposes of a State law tort suit.

6

judgment bar extends to the employee the preclusion

7

benefit of that suit so that the employee gets the same

8

res judicata effect that he would have had absent the

9

shift of -- of the defense to the Government.

10

And then the

The -- again, the -- the one clear

11

explanation in the background for why the judgment --

12

what the judgment bar does is that it -- it applies to

13

the employee the same bar that would have applied to

14

the Government under -- under prior bills which, again,

15

was only the bar of res judicata.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Because res -Did you -- did you

17

make the argument or the point that Justice Stevens

18

articulated earlier about the -- the provisions of this

19

chapter not applying and that including 2676?

20

MS. ZIEVE:

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

22

Does it sound good or

bad to you now?

23

(Laughter.)

24

MS. ZIEVE:

25

No, we didn't make it, and --

We did make a similar argument

that 2680 states that 1346(b) shall not apply and

37
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

because the judgment bar only applies to actions under

2

1346(b), it's something of a contradiction to say that

3

an action that -- to which 1346(b) shall not apply at

4

the same time an action under 1346(b).

5

As for Justice Stevens' broader argument that

6

-- that chapter -- chapter 171, which is the rest of

7

the FTCA, other than -- than 1346(b), shall not --

8

shall not apply to claims arising from the exceptions,

9

I don't think that Smith, which I think was Mr.

10

Hallward-Driemeier's response -- Smith doesn't really

11

provide a full answer to why that argument might be

12

wrong because Smith really -- Smith did say that an

13

action that -- an action to which the chapter does not

14

apply at the same time can be one to which the

15

exclusive remedy provision has been applied.

16

But one difference is the -- the order in

17

which those things happened.

18

2679(b) exclusive remedy provision invoked before the

19

question of whether 2680 applied would arise.

20

First, you would get the

And the other point is that Smith, which

21

construed the exclusive remedy provision to apply even

22

if the exceptions would then preclude a suit entirely,

23

was based on the purpose of the exclusive remedy

provision.

25

statements that it was intended to provide an immunity

18

says there is no Federal action for, among other

19

things, the case in front of us and, among other

20

things, actions in a foreign country.

21

says, one, this is in a foreign country, so you can't

22

bring it under Federal Tort Claims Act, and now we'll

23

go look to see whether this bar that you can't bring

it, period, applies.

25

And over here in the exceptions section, it

They say it does apply.

Now, Justice Stevens dissented, but he didn't

Alderson Reporting Company

1

dissent on that ground.

2

And -- and so -- so I don't see how we could

3

reach the result with this other exception without

4

overturning Smith because Smith said (b) does apply.

5

And so if the fact that it falls within an exception

6

means the whole thing doesn't apply, then they would

7

have held (b) doesn't apply.

8

apply.

9

But they said (b) does

So how do we get there given Smith?
MS. ZIEVE:

Well, like application of the

10

judgment bar, one distinction would be that it turns on

11

the order in which things occur, and in --

12
13

JUSTICE BREYER:

I mean, that -- that would

be to overturn the reasoning of Smith.

14

MS. ZIEVE:

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

16

MS. ZIEVE:

It would say --

But the reasoning -Yes.

Well, the reasoning of Smith is

17

not based on the language of 2680.

18

Smith is based on the statement of legislative purpose,

19

the background under which 2679(b) was enacted, and

20

based on 2679(b)(2), which has -- stating exceptions,

21

and 2679(d)(4), which has procedures for the United

22

States to certify and step into the shoes of the United

23

States.

MS. ZIEVE:

Right.

What the Court did in

Smith -- and I think this applies to much of the

3

Court's jurisprudence to construing the --

4

JUSTICE STEVENS:

The main holding in Smith

5

was that the foreign country exception applied.

6

all they held in Smith, wasn't it?

7

MS. ZIEVE:

Right.

That's

Smith held the foreign

8

country exception applied even though the employee

9

would -- the -- the plaintiff would have no remedy.

10

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And the -- and the -- I

11

don't see how that is at all inconsistent with what

12

I'm suggesting here.

13

MS. ZIEVE:

I really don't.
Well, I don't think it's

14

inconsistent.

15

that the Court -- both in that case and in Meyer and in

16

Gutierrez de Martinez, the Court looked at provisions

17

of the FTCA that are not models of clarity and

18

attempted to give a sensible reading, given the -- the

19

purposes that Congress was trying to achieve and the

20

context and structure of the specific provisions.

21

I think one thing that's important is

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, looking at it very

22

broadly, it doesn't seem to me that if the United

23

States did not waive sovereign immunity for a

24

particular category of tort case, that a dismissal of

25

such a tort case should bar an -- an action by an

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

1

individual against an individual defendant, just

looking at it in -- in a global sense.

the plain language of the statute also says.

don't really see any tension.

something obvious here.

6

MS. ZIEVE:

And that's what
So I

I -- maybe I'm missing

I agree entirely.

As the Court

7

said in Meyer, the jurisdiction under the FTCA is

8

defined by the scope of the waiver of sovereign

9

immunity, and without question --

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But we -- this case is

11

about the interpretation of 2676, as we took it.

12

before your time runs out, if we can get to the nub of

13

your difference, your reading and the Government's, you

14

say judgment in 2676 means judgment on the merits, and

15

the Government says it means any judgment.

16

your interpretation, we would have to put a caret mark

17

after judgment and put on the merits.

18

doesn't say on the merits.

19

MS. ZIEVE:

And

So to buy

But the statute

No, the statute doesn't say what

20

it means by judgment.

21

judgment has a clear meaning, and that's why it's

22

appropriate to look to the context of the provision,

23

what Congress was trying to achieve in the provision to

24

interpret the scope of the bar and the meaning of -- of

25

that word and all the words together.

And I -- and I don't think

42
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

The -- the purpose of the statute is to shift

2

suits from the employees to the Government, and the

3

background of this specific provision, little as it is,

4

and the comparison in a couple places to this provision

5

discussing a parallel way to the administrative

6

settlement provision -- we think the most sensible

7

reading is that Congress was trying to extend the

8

preclusion effect of the suit against the Government so

9

that although the employee would no longer be sued and

10

would get that benefit in the first instance, if the

11

plaintiff chose to go against the Government first, the

12

employee wouldn't have -- there would be no second suit

13

against the employee for those same State law torts

14

because in -- in 1946, the only torts Congress was

15

considering were State law torts.

16

the Government for negligence or my mail carrier for

17

negligence?

18

Am I going to sue

And to -- both for efficiency reasons, to

19

protect the Government, which was concerned about --

20

about the burden on it of having to go -- to litigate

21

twice, the preclusion effect would be carried to the

22

employee, so that once there was a resolution of the

23

State law torts against the Government, that would be

24

the end of the matter.

25

is actually a phrase that the Assistant Attorney

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What is the -- as a

3

practical matter, though, what is the great burden on

4

the plaintiffs in requiring them to sue the individual

5

defendants first if they're concerned about the

6

judgment bar?

7

MS. ZIEVE:

In -- in many cases, if not most

8

cases, an -- a plaintiff won't have both remedies

9

available.

So it's only a -- a small universe of cases

10

anyway in which a plaintiff would want to sue in Bivens

and sue under the FTCA.

12

case, before discovery, when all you've done is file

13

your administrative claim to which, in many cases as in

14

this one, the Government has never even responded, the

15

actually have a Bivens claim.

thought they had one, they filed it.

18

But at the beginning of the

In this case, when they

Also, the Government's view in -- in other

19

cases is not that your -- it doesn't help the

20

plaintiffs to sue simultaneously because the

21

Government's position in other cases has been -- and

22

courts have largely agreed -- that once the judgment in

the -- on the FTCA claim comes down, the Bivens suit is

24

then precluded, in some cases even if the judgment in

the Bivens suit has preceded the judgment in the FTCA

2

cases might -- might be feasible and seem like a good

idea, is not necessarily going to protect the

plaintiffs, given the scope of the Government's

arguments.

6

So bringing them simultaneously, while in some

MS. ZIEVE:

You can

11

statute of limitations work out, you could bring the

12

Bivens suit first, but again, you'd have to --

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If the -- if the

A Bivens suit is pretty

14

hard to prove, a lot harder than proving a case of

15

negligence.

16

MS. ZIEVE:

Yes.

And since, either way,

17

you're only going to get one satisfaction for your

18

claim, it seems odd to adopt a construction that

19

encourages plaintiffs to go first after the employees

20

when the purpose of the FTCA was try to encourage

21

plaintiffs to go after the Government instead.

22
23

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And plaintiffs, generally,

like to sue -- sue solvent defendants too I think.

24

(Laughter.)

25

MS. ZIEVE:

Yes.

And -- and if the

45
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Government had responded in this case to the

2

administrative claim in -- in a timely manner or at

3

all, the plaintiffs would have had a better sense of

4

where they stood on the FTCA claim before they filed

5

suit.

6

I'd like to mention, although the Government

7

has sort of retracted it, that footnote 5 of their

8

reply brief concedes that claims wholly outside the

9

purview of the FTCA, to use their phrase -- that

10

judgments based on claims wholly outside the purview of

11

the FTCA do not trigger the judgment bar.

12

on -- claims that arise under the exceptions of 2680

13

are surely outside the purview of the FTA -- FTCA.

14

-- the 1945 committee report, which is the last one

15

before the statute was enacted, actually describes the

16

FTCA 2680 exceptions as excepting certain classes of

17

torts from the grant of the right to sue.

18

does that make clear that they're outside the purview

19

of the FTCA, but that they are matters of subject

20

matter jurisdiction.

21

cases like Scarborough and last month in Everhart,

22

subject matter jurisdiction refers to classes of cases

23

that the court has authority to adjudicate.

This Court in Gilman, an early case relating

provision was intended to address precisely these types

6

of concerns, morale of employees, the same concerns

7

that have led this Court and Congress in other contexts

to recognize other forms of -- of official immunity.

9

And this one is equally subject to immediate review.

10

Respondents suggest, considering for a

11

moment, what Congress would have expected in 1946 when

12

it initially enacted this, and -- and I think that that

is helpful.
