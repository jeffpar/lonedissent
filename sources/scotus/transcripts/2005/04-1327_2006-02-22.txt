ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN H. BLUME

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

10

MR. BLUME:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:
In this case, the South Carolina Supreme

11

Court took the second of two recent steps that

12

dramatically curtail a defendant's ability to create a

13

reasonable doubt as to his innocence by presenting

14

evidence that another individual committed the crime.

15

The first step came in 2001 when, in State v.

16

Gay, the court held that the admissibility of third

17

party guilt evidence was dependent on the strength of

18

the prosecution's case.

19

The second step, which occurred in Mr.

20

Holmes' case, holds that third party guilt evidence is

21

inadmissible whenever the prosecution has presented

22

strong forensic evidence of the defendant's guilt.

23
24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Now, there's some dispute as

to whether that -- that is really what -- what it held.
And there's a big difference.

If -- if you just say

3
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

whenever you -- whenever the prosecution has a strong

2

case, you can't introduce other guilt, or whether all

3

that the court is saying is that one of the elements

4

that you consider in determining whether to admit this

5

-- this third party is not just -- it's the comparative

6

weakness of the third party case.

7

yourself to -- to the strength of the prosecution's

8

case.

9

You don't blind

Will you say it was bad even if it was the

10

latter that the court was -- was referring to?

11

saying you cannot consider the strength of the

12

prosecution's case at all in determining whether to

13

allow in third party guilt evidence?

14

MR. BLUME:

Are you

Yes, Justice Scalia, I am.

It's

15

not necessary for a ruling in our favor in this case.

16

It's not contingent here because at a minimum, the

17

South Carolina Supreme Court rule here in describing

18

it, they said in State v. Gay we held that in cases

19

where there is strong evidence of guilt, including

20

strong forensic evidence, evidence that a third party

21

committed the crime is not admissible.

22

categorical rule of exclusion no matter how you cut it.

23

That is a

But even if you deemed that there is some

24

discretion left in the system, it is still

25

unconstitutional because what the South Carolina system

4
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

requires is a reasoning backwards, that the

2

admissibility of evidence of the defendant's innocence

3

is conditioned on the judge's assessment of the

4

likelihood of the defendant's guilt.

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I -- I suppose that

6

in a purely discretionary system -- I -- I can't quite

7

think of the hypothetical -- the strength of the

8

prosecution's case may bear on the assessment of

9

relevance and materiality as to the evidence the

10

defense wants to introduce.

11

identification is -- is quite clear -- is quite clear

12

-- and then there's some witness of marginal

13

credibility that says he was in another city, I think

14

that may affect the trial court's balance.

15

If -- if the evidence of

I -- I take the thrust of your point, that

16

the strength of the case makes it more important to

17

introduce the third party evidence, not -- not less.

18

-- I take that point.

19

rule, I'm not sure that the strength of the case is

20

always irrelevant.

21

I

But just as -- as an absolute

That's what I'm saying.

MR. BLUME:

I think that it is possible that

22

under some circumstances not the strength of the

23

State's case but the evidence as a whole may shed some

24

light on whether the third party guilt evidence is

25

relevant.

For example, if the uncontested evidence is

5
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

the crime occurred on Tuesday, January 3rd, and the

2

third party guilt evidence shows that the third party

3

was in Acapulco on January 3rd and had no possibility

4

to be there, that's not a strength issue.

5

relevance.

6

That is

But when the touchstone for admissibility is

7

whether the defense evidence overcomes the

8

prosecution's case -- and in the South Carolina rule

9

for -- just to be clear, it's not even considered that

10

you consider the evidence of guilt.

11

evidence of third party guilt has to overcome the

12

prosecution's forensic evidence.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

The defense

Suppose that everything in

14

this case were the same.

15

except what the court of appeals or the State supreme

16

court holds is that we think under rule 403, which

17

happens to be the rule in our State, the probative

18

value doesn't warrant admissibility in light of the

19

risk of prejudice.

But everything else is the same.

20

MR. BLUME:

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

22
23

Everything is identical

If the South Carolina -Now, in your opinion is that

constitutional?
MR. BLUME:

Just to make sure I understand

24

it, if the South Carolina Supreme Court in this case on

25

these facts had said this was a 403.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.

2

MR. BLUME:

I think that would be

No.

unconstitutional --

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

5

MR. BLUME:

Because?

-- under this Court's decision in

6

Olden v. Kentucky that this Court has recognized that

7

evidentiary rulings, based on the strength of the

8

evidence in this case, can be arbitrary and capricious

9

and deprive a defendant of --

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

11

MR. BLUME:

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, what they'll say --

-- his right to defense.
-- if they want to build it

13

out, is they'll say, look, there -- there is DNA

14

evidence here.

15

that the light -- the -- the only doubt of the -- the

16

defense has cast on it is they found that there was

17

some opportunity that the police could have tampered

18

with it.

19

of custody cases, and that is not sufficient to

20

overcome what it shows.

21

the jury's time and it'll prove very confusing to the

22

jury.

23
24
25

It's absolutely conclusive, and all

That's true of 60 percent or so of all chain

And therefore, it's not worth

Now, why would that ruling under 403 be
unconstitutional?
MR. BLUME:

Well, that ruling in this case

7
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

would be unconstitutional because it would be a

2

mischaracterization of what Mr. Holmes' evidence was.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

Good.

Now, that's what I

want you to get to.
MR. BLUME:

Challenging the DNA evidence.

6

That is not the -- the state of the evidence in this

7

case, but --

8
9
10
11

JUSTICE BREYER:

And the key points that

suggest that what I just said is not a fair
characterization or a correct characterization are?
MR. BLUME:

That the evidence in this case --

12

that even the FBI agent who testified for the

13

government admitted the DNA could have been placed

14

through the incompetent handling of the evidence by

15

Officer Mobley, that without gloves and with all the

16

evidence in his possession, he inventoried the items,

17

including Mr. Holmes' clothing and the victim's

18

clothing, stuck his hands in the bag, determined what

19

was in there without washing them or gloves, stuck his

20

hand in another bag, determined what was in there.

21

even they admitted that due to the very small amount of

22

DNA that was recovered, that Officer Mobley's actions

23

could have been the source of the DNA on the clothing.

And

24

In addition to that, there were a number of

25

other suspicious activities, including Officer Mobley

8
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

locked everyone else out before he inventoried,

2

processed the scene.

3

contamination there.

4

And then there were problems with

And then at the bottom -- at the end of the

5

day, the defense presented a DNA expert, the only non-

6

forensic scientist, but the most qualified scientist in

7

the case from the New York University Medical School,

8

and he said, look, this DNA doesn't mean anything.

9

There are things that science cannot explain.

There

10

are dye globs here which should not be present.

11

There's also a spike that does not belong to Mr. Holmes

12

or --

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, where --

14

where in the record is the testimony of the FBI agents

15

that you were referring to?

16

MR. BLUME:

It's -- it's in the joint

17

appendix.

18

Agent Baechtel.

19

appendix, page 249, but I'm not positive of that, and

20

counsel will look for it.

21

The -- the agent which admitted this was
I think it's actually in the joint

But there was also their defense expert who

22

said that the bottom-line results were unreliable.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So

What about -- what about

the DNA -- the exclusion of the alleged perpetrator, of

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

White?

2

And that was a FBI officer who testified to that.

3

There -- there was no trace of White's DNA.

MR. BLUME:

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

I don't

4

find that surprising at all, given the facts of this

5

case.

6

seek and ye shall not find.

7

none of Jimmy White's clothing to test to see if there

8

was any incriminating DNA on that.

9

his shoes, even though they had the shoe print.

10

It's, you know, seek and ye shall find, or don't
In this case, they took

They didn't take

This was not a case in which the DNA pointed

11

to a single perpetrator.

12

or rectal swabs which contained any information of any

13

value whatsoever.

14

There were no vaginal swabs

And by the time they finally got around to

15

doing the DNA testing in 1996, numerous items of

16

clothing, including several items belonging to the

17

victim, had disappeared and no one could explain where

18

they had went.

19

White's DNA on Bobby Holmes' clothing I think is of no

20

significance whatsoever.

So the fact that they didn't find Jimmy

21

The main -- one of the main thrusts of the

22

defense case here was because of the incompetence or

23

the malfeasance of the police officers in this case,

24

that the evidence against Holmes was unreliable.

25

MR. BLUME:

Mr. Blume, I -- I know you're

10
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

more concerned about -- about what result you get in

2

this case and -- and whether your client gets another

3

trial or not.

4

rule of law that we're going to apply in the case which

5

will affect a whole lot of other trials, and I -- I

6

frankly think we're playing with fire.

7

about criminal trials turning into circuses in which --

8

in -- in which the police are put on trial, which is

9

part of what is happening here and what has happened in

I am more concerned about -- about the

I -- I worry

10

-- in a famous recent American case.

11

that that will be the -- the result if -- if we take

12

your suggestion, which is to prescind from any

13

consideration of the strength of the prosecution's case

14

and simply look at the -- at the alleged third party

15

guilt evidence on its own without -- without any

16

consideration of its relative -- its relative strength.

17
18
19
20

I worry that --

Just -- you want us to do it just absolutely.
MR. BLUME:

Well, I would say, Justice

Scalia, that that's the way the 49 other States do it.
South Carolina is the only State which has a rule

21

which requires a defendant to overcome the

22

prosecution's case.

23

you have to overcome the prosecution's case, the only

24

thing that counts is the prosecution's evidence.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Where -- where do you

2

think it says you have to overcome the prosecution's

3

case?

4

MR. BLUME:

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

In the Holmes opinion.
It's a -- it's a

6

factor that's considered in weighing the admissibility

7

and relevance of the third party guilt.

8

you don't have to prove and rebut and overcome, as

9

you've said a couple of times, the prosecution's case.

10

MR. BLUME:

They don't --

The -- the holding in Mr. Holmes'

11

case is Holmes simply cannot overcome the forensic

12

evidence against him.

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No.

But with respect, I --

14

isn't the -- the term that they use -- and I was going

15

to ask essentially the same question.

16

the court uses is raise a reasonable inference of his

17

innocence.

18

I read that, it said -- I thought to myself it sounds

19

as though they are saying he must present evidence or

20

make a showing, a preliminary showing, that it is more

21

probable than not that he is innocent despite the

22

State's evidence.

23

is it spelled out anywhere?

The term that

And I will -- I will grant you this.

When

But they never spell that out, and

decision since then.

Well, there has not been a -- a

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

sentence before that in the opinion where it says --

2

they describe the Gregory rule, which was the old rule,

3

with which we have no quarrel.

4

to that in other jurisdictions.

5

held in State v. Gay that in cases where there is

6

strong evidence of guilt, especially forensic evidence,

7

evidence of third party guilt simply is not admissible.

8
9

The rules are similar

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It says, further, we

Well, you say you

don't object to the -- the Gregory standard, and the

10

Gregory standard is the one Justice Souter just quoted,

11

raise a reasonable inference as to his own innocence.

12

Now, how can you tell whether it raises a reasonable

13

inference in a vacuum without regard to the evidence on

14

the other side?

15

-- I understand you dispute it in this case, but let's

16

say unobjectionable DNA evidence that your client was

17

the person there, and his third party guilt evidence is

18

it wasn't me.

19

reasonable inference or not without looking at what's

20

on the other side?

21

If the evidence on the other side is

How can you tell whether that creates a

MR. BLUME:

Well, I -- I think because, one,

22

if you do that, you could supplant -- you -- you have

23

made the judge the jury, and the defendant, in order to

24

present evidence of his innocence, have to -- has to

25

win a trial before the trial -- before the judge.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, not at all.

What

2

you're saying is that the evidence has to be -- the

3

admissibility of evidence has to be assessed in light

4

of the circumstances.

5

as it may be in this case, that the DNA evidence

6

doesn't show what you think it shows, fine, that

7

evidence comes in.

8

9

somebody else did it, and the -- and you don't

If your claim of innocence is,

If the evidence you're trying to

10

challenge the DNA evidence that places your client

11

there, then maybe that doesn't create a reasonable

12

inference, while it might in a different case,

13

depending on the nature of the prosecution's evidence.

14

MR. BLUME:

I -- first of all, there is no

15

other State that does it that way.

16

that.

inference.

No State considers

sure that's the case.

22

Scalia's word, that the -- the nature of the

23

prosecution's case just doesn't seem to me right.

We're asking about 403.

MR. BLUME:

say there's a more wooden rule and a -- and a more iron

2

rule here that was prejudicial, I think that's

something else.

There -- there is, and I think

the South Carolina rule is a categorical rule based on

the description.

whether the third party guilt evidence overcomes the

10

State's evidence, you look only at the State's

11

evidence, and the defendant's counter forensic evidence

is deemed irrelevant.

13

a stacked deck.

14

So you have to overcome it with

JUSTICE ALITO:

But is it your argument that

15

the State's evidence can't be considered at all, or

16

that it can't be given more than a certain amount of

17

weight?

18

line?

19

And if it's the latter, where do you draw the

MR. BLUME:

I think that you cannot -- that

20

as a general matter, a State cannot require a defendant

21

to persuade a judge of his likely innocence before he

22

can present evidence to the jury that he's innocent.

23

That is -- that is putting the judge in the role of the

24

jury, and that's what the South --

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yes, but the State doesn't go

that far.

2

persuade the judge of the defendant's likely innocence,

3

then there's no constitutional violation.

4

the rule of State law simply requires a consideration

5

of the strength of the prosecution evidence in relation

6

to the defense evidence, that's -- that's all right?

If it doesn't require the defendant to

Consideration, for example, in

10

some way, that is not constitutionally objectionable.

11

But when you have a weighing procedure like South

12

Carolina does and the admissibility of the evidence of

13

innocence depends on a judge's assessment of the

14

credibility of the defendant's case and the

15

prosecution's case, that is what juries do.

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

But where is the line?

17

That's what I'm trying to get at.

18

rule is that the defendant has to raise a reasonable

19

inference of innocence and you take into account the

20

strength of a prosecution's case in making that

21

determination, you don't just accept the defense

22

evidence and -- and see whether -- how -- how strong an

23

inference of innocence it would raise if it's believed.

24
25

If it's -- if the

I mean, where is the line?
MR. BLUME:

I think that would be -- because

implicitly weighed, and I think that's --

JUSTICE ALITO:

Your hypothetical to me is

And that would be

unconstitutional as well.

5

MR. BLUME:

6

All these cases where you indicate, well, you

7

know, what if it's conclusively -- that the evidence is

8

conclusive and the defendant didn't contest the DNA,

9

should it be let in --

10
11

I think that's unconstitutional.

JUSTICE ALITO:

That makes it sound like it

can't be considered at all.

12

MR. BLUME:

That -- well, only for relevance

13

and possibly for some 403's because that's looking at

14

the 403 part.

15

But in that --

JUSTICE SOUTER:

What if the -- what if the

16

court says, we will weigh it to the extent of

17

determining whether, in light of the State's case, the

18

proffered evidence, if accepted, would pass the laugh

19

test?

20

legitimate?

That's weighing.

21

MR. BLUME:

Is -- is that -- is that

I think that that is problematic.

And -- but the -- the point I think is no other State

does it.

the other, an intermediate decision by the California

much stronger evidence that Mr. White was in the area

a very significant factor in determining whether this

error was harmless or not is having succeeded in

convincing the trial judge to exclude the evidence, the

to present relevant evidence is not unlimited, however,

3

but is rather subject to reasonable restrictions.

A defendant's right

State courts as rulemakers have broad

5

latitude to establish rules excluding evidence so long

6

as they are not arbitrary or disproportionate.

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Mr. Zelenka, do you -- do

8

you agree with the characterization that your brother

9

has given, largely by way of quotation from the opinion

10

in this case, that the rule of admissibility that --

11

that the -- that the court followed in -- or that the

12

supreme court approved in this case would have required

13

the defendant to show to a degree of probability, in

14

light of all the evidence, including the forensic

15

evidence, that he was innocent as a condition of -- of

16

admitting the evidence?

17

MR. ZELENKA:

No, I do not.

I think it was

18

merely an application of the original opinion that

19

relied upon the straight -- State v. Gregory, that in

20

fact it must raise a reasonable inference as to the

21

defendant's innocence.

22

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But, well, what do you -- I

23

mean, your -- your brother's strongest point is this

24

statement, and I'm quoting from page 365 of the joint

25

appendix where the -- where the opinion is set out, at

29
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

-- at the top of the page, the second sentence.

2

simply cannot overcome the forensic evidence against

3

him to raise a reasonable inference of his own

4

innocence.

5

probability that he is innocent in light of all the

6

evidence, including the forensic evidence?

7

He

What could that mean other than a

MR. ZELENKA:

I think that -- that language

8

was basically a review determination as to what exactly

9

happened.

10
11

I don't think that the court -JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yes, but what does it mean?

I mean, I've given you a suggestion as to what it

12

seems to mean on a straightforward reading, and -- and

13

I take it you disagree with that.

14

how it could mean something else?

15

MR. ZELENKA:

But can you explain

No, I don't disagree with the

16

fact that, in fact, that is what the supreme court said

17

in its analysis, looking at the particular evidence in

18

this case, that he was unable to overcome that.

19

think State v. Gregory didn't require that to be the

20

ultimate threshold that it had to meet, rather that it

21

raise a reasonable inference as to his innocence.

22

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But I

Well, it's -- it's true.

23

When they -- on the -- on the previous page, the bottom

24

of 364, they -- they cite -- they first quote Gregory

25

and then they cite Gay and they characterize, I guess,

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

the two together as -- well, they say, in Gay, we held

2

that where there is strong evidence of an appellant's

3

guilt, especially where there is strong forensic

4

evidence, the proffered evidence about a third party's

5

guilt does not raise a reasonable inference as to the

6

appellant's own innocence.

7

overcome which it uses on the other page.

8

MR. ZELENKA:

9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

It doesn't use the word

No, it doesn't.
But even without the word

10

overcome, what -- what can reasonable inference of

11

innocence mean, considered in light of the other

12

evidence in the case, if it doesn't mean something like

13

a probability of -- of innocence?

14

MR. ZELENKA:

It's raising a possibility.

I

15

don't know what level of possibility it is other than a

16

reasonable inference level, which is a level which --

17

which means that it's subject to some belief.

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But quite apart from that,

19

it seems to me that the statement is questionable as an

20

empirical matter.

21

somehow should be used to exclude third party guilt

22

evidence as -- as a universal proposition?

23

some cases yes, maybe in some -- but this is a

24

universal proposition.

25

MR. ZELENKA:

Why is it that forensic evidence

Maybe in

It reads certainly like a

31
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

universal proposition, but I think it is merely an

2

application of what happened in State v. Gregory and

3

State v. Gay when they were presented at that time in

4

those situations with what they determined to be strong

5

evidence of forensic guilt --

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, if I were the trial

7

court, in a subsequent case in South Carolina, I would

8

-- I would have to read this instruction of the South

9

Carolina Supreme Court as saying I simply could not

10

admit this evidence when there's forensic evidence.

11

And that's a very strange proposition.

12

MR. ZELENKA:

I would agree that would be a

13

strange proposition because it suggests that they would

14

ignore the merits of -- of the proffered evidence

15

itself.

16

case, and I don't think that's what the South Carolina

17

Supreme Court --

18

That's correct.
But the language says they

So what do we do?

MR. ZELENKA:

remember that the -- the South Carolina Supreme Court

That's my question.

If you look into the evidence,

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's right.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, the trial judge also

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Supposing -- I've written a

fair number of opinions involving criminal cases where

I've had to say that we take all the inferences

favorable to the prosecution, and based on that rule,

we find there's sufficient evidence to justify the

Do you think they

I think they would have still

held the third party evidence inadmissible because of

the lack of corroboration.

of reliability to get over --

It lacked that requirement

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But it's odd that they

didn't say that.

that the evidence of guilt was overwhelming.

And they gave that immediately

13

after they had issued their prior opinion in -- in

No.

corroboration for what the individual was saying in the

MR. ZELENKA:

I think they could evaluate the

a credibility determination?

16

MR. ZELENKA:

But his

evaluation, we believe, necessarily needs to be done to

make a determination to the -- to the probative value

third party guilt evidence of -- of the defendant, that

all those matters need to be looked at as to whether,

MR. ZELENKA:

It's some evidence for the

MR. ZELENKA:

Actually Gay was -- two things.

Gay was not the standard when the trial judge made the

pretrial hearing.

11

time the case was tried, and the trial judge was

12

addressing that standard and he found that Gay was not

13

satisfied because he didn't believe that there was

evidence which clearly pointed to the defendant --

15

excuse me -- to the third party as being guilty of the

particular crime.

lacked appropriate corroboration at the trial --

I would also like to preserve the ability to

argue harmless error, as we've done in our case to some

extent.

a harmless error analysis, but more importantly, in

MR. JOHNSON:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

15
16

Thank you, Mr.

In my time today, I'd like to focus on two
basic issues.

17

The first is that this case does not approach

18

the outer limit of due process set by this Court in

19

Chambers.

20

instances, there is no evidence to corroborate these

21

confessions.

22

Chambers was far stronger than the confession evidence

23

in this case.

24
25

As the trial court found in three specific

And the confession evidence itself in

Second, I'd like to respond to Justice
Breyer's question about the nature of the Supreme Court

45
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

of Carolina's opinion and to remind the Court that it's

2

reviewing the judgment primarily, not the opinion.

3

it seems to me that Petitioner's argument is

4

essentially criticizing the opinion for the absence of

5

a word, the absence of the word automatically, and that

6

the opinion would look very different if it said where

7

there's strong evidence of guilt, the defendant's third

8

party guilt evidence doesn't automatically raise a

9

reasonable inference of innocence.

10

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay.

And

And I -- I take it

11

what you will do, in the course of your second point,

12

is tell us the answer to this question, that if we do

13

not accept the overcome by reasonable inference

14

formulation that is here, what would be an acceptable

15

formulation because I think that's what you -- you say

16

you're getting to.

17

us.

18

But that would be very helpful to

MR. JOHNSON:

We -- we believe that the raise

19

a reasonable inference of innocence standard, as the

20

counsel for South Carolina said, does not necessarily

21

require that it be the only inference --

22

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, one of the problems is

23

I don't know what it requires.

24

second page of the opinion that I quoted, it is used

25

with the word overcome, which certainly suggests that

On -- on the -- on the

46
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

it is supposed to raise a probability of innocence in

2

light of all the evidence.

3

without overcome, as it was earlier in the opinion.

4

don't know what they mean by inference.

5

evidence from which one might reasonably conclude, from

6

which one -- there is a reasonable possibility of

7

concluding?

8

I hope you'll give us a suggested formulation with --

9

with terms that -- that are defined that -- that you

Sometimes it is used
I

Do they mean

I just don't know what the terms mean.

So

10

and the States that you represent would -- would think

11

was an acceptable and constitutional standard.

12
13
14
15
16

MR. JOHNSON:
actually a fair one.

And I think your formulation is

Does it raise some --

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, I included several.

Which -- which one -MR. JOHNSON:

The second one, does it raise

17

some reasonable possibility of innocence.

18

words, if you believe this evidence --

19

JUSTICE SOUTER:

20

MR. JOHNSON:

In other

Okay.

-- does it raise a reasonable

21

possibility of innocence, not -- not that it's the most

22

likely or the only possibility from that evidence.

23

And I think if you look at the South Carolina

24

Supreme Court's opinion carefully, in light of the --

25

the supreme court's decisions in Gregory and Gay, you

47
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

see that in fact what the court was doing was simply

2

saying this case is like Gay.

There's strong evidence.

3

We're going to look at the evidence on both sides.

4

And there's a -- there is certainly language in the

5

opinion that makes it sound like an automatic or

6

categorical rule, but in fact, they did go on to look

7

at the defendant's evidence.

8
9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Has anybody else looked at

the evidence on both sides?

10

MR. JOHNSON:

The trial court certainly

11

looked at the defendant's evidence.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

13
14

Other States I mean.

Other

States.
MR. JOHNSON:

Yes, Your Honor.

I think that

15

it would be fair to say that -- that any of the nine

16

States collected in our appendix whose standard is does

17

the evidence raise a reasonable inference of innocence

18

look at those sorts of questions.

19

In addition, we collected, I believe, four

20

cases in our brief, in addition to the California Court

21

of Appeal and the D.C. Circuit's opinion in Cabrera.

22

There's the Kansas v. Adams case which very clearly

23

looks at the State evidence.

24

was the defendant was on trial for shaking his baby to

25

death, and the medical evidence of the prosecution

48
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

showed that the death took place within a certain time

2

period.

3

that his wife --

4

The defendant wanted to introduce evidence

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

5

up to Cabrera?

6

and --

The D.C. Circuit did not publish that

7

MR. JOHNSON:

8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

9

Can we -- can we just back

That's correct, Your Honor.
-- and unless the rule has

changed, it didn't have -- it didn't have any

10

precedential effect -- those opinions that they did not

11

put in the Federal Reports.

12

MR. JOHNSON:

I think its reasoning stands on

13

its own, Your Honor.

14

have these other three published cases, and we stand by

15

the description of them in our argument.

16

But in addition to that case, you

Kansas v. Adams was a case where the court

17

said the issue -- the State's evidence shows this baby

18

died within a certain time period, and although the

19

wife had a history of violence against the child, the

20

court said it's not getting in because it's -- there's

21

no evidence that she had access to the child during the

22

relevant time period.

23

There are other examples.

24
25

That's a very clear example.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Suppose there had been

evidence that the time of death testimony had been

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

contrived, planted, fabricated.

2

that was the allegation of the defense.

3

MR. JOHNSON:

Then what?

Or suppose

I -- I think it would be within

4

the -- the trial court's discretion to exclude it.

5

certainly don't think it would necessarily violate the

6

due process --

7

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But if he did, he would be

8

making a credibility determination, wouldn't he?

9

would be deciding an issue that normally would be

10

submitted to the jury.

11

MR. JOHNSON:

Honor, that -- that the trial court can make

13

credibility determinations, but --

15

He

It's not our position, Your

12

14

I

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But the example that

Justice Kennedy gave you was such a determination.

16

MR. JOHNSON:

I -- I think, though -- I -- I

17

suppose that would depend on the nature of the specific

18

evidence at issue.

19
20

If you look at the evidence --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why wasn't it in the baby-

shaking case?

21

MR. JOHNSON:

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I'm sorry?
Why was there no credibility

23

determination made in the baby-shaking case you just

24

described?

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm totally with you if I read American Jurisprudence

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

On that, could a

prosecutor have gotten this case -- gotten an

indictment against White on the basis that he had four

witnesses who put him in the proximity of the crime,

25

four who said that they heard him confess?

for this?

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Possibly -And -- and also throw in

one more thing, the victim's description of the

to hear that evidence, that sounds passing strange to

me.

10

So if -- if White could have been indicted

MR. JOHNSON:

Possibly that evidence would be

11

sufficient to support an indictment, Your Honor, but I

12

don't believe it would be sufficient to support a

13

conviction.

14

And I also think that it's -- it's -- we're

talking about the outer limits of due process here.

MR. JOHNSON:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I don't --

indict and that very same evidence is put before the

jury, but it wouldn't be enough to convict?

8
9

MR. JOHNSON:

I'm saying, Your Honor, that

the evidence here clearly isn't strong enough to meet

10

the standard for due process, quite apart from whether

11

it's enough to support an indictment or a conviction.

12

And if you compare it with the evidence in Chambers,

13

that's very clear where there was eyewitness testimony

14

of the shooting itself.

15

that the third party was at the scene of the crime with

16

the gun in his hand.

17

from the gun dealer that he sold the person the type of

crime at issue -- the type of gun at issue both before

and after the offense.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN H. BLUME

20

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

21

MR. BLUME:

22

The trial judge in this case found, if you

want to go -- he found there was sufficient evidence

24

from which the jury could find that Jimmy White was in

25

the area at the time.

May it please the Court:

2

On 135, he also found there was sufficient

3

evidence from which a jury could believe that Jimmy

4

White confessed to being the perpetrator, and there was

5

sufficient evidence from which a jury could conclude

6

that Jimmy White had in the past committed acts against

7

women.

And then he made the mistake of fact and a
mistake of law.

He treated White as unavailable and

therefore he excluded the statement made.

12

he should have been able to have been called.

18

that case, he found the statements were made.

that's why the State supreme court did not embrace or

rely upon what the trial court did because it was

clearly wrong.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

-- I mean, if it meets the standard for harmless, it

10

suggests that it didn't make a difference, would not

11

have been likely to make a difference with the jury,

12

and therefore it could have been excluded in the first

13

instance.

14

MR. BLUME:

No.

I just think it might be

15

that it was then -- the error might not have been

16

prejudicial in context of the record as a whole.

guilt evidence say, well, you know, this DNA isn't all

gets them off on a detour, distracts their attention

MR. BLUME:

And the jury might be absolutely

right about that, and it's their determination to make.

It might be that they don't challenge the DNA evidence

it.
