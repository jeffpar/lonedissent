CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

first in Texaco Inc. v. Dagher and Shell Oil v. Dagher.

5

Mr. Nager.

6

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GLEN D. NAGER

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8
9

MR. NAGER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

10

In this case, the Court of Appeals of the

11

Ninth Circuit held that a decision to unify the prices

12

charged for the two branded gasoline products sold by a

13

joint venture created by Shell and Texaco could be

14

deemed a per se violation of section 1 of the Sherman

15

Act.

16

The Ninth Circuit's decision is plainly

17

wrong.

18

entitled to create and set the prices for the products

19

that it sells.

20

A joint venture has to be able to and is

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Mr. Nager, on -- on that

21

point, I have a factual question and I figured I'd get

22

it -- excuse me -- get it out on the table at the

23

beginning so you'd know what at least is bothering me.

24
25

The nub -- the nub of your factual argument
is, as you just -- just stated it, there's a joint

4
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

venture here and joint ventures price their products.

2

The factual question that I have is this.

3

or the preface for it is this.

4

that has continued to market, in effect, the same

5

product that the -- that the two companies marketed

6

beforehand, and it has done so, ostensibly, under the

7

old brand names.

8

joint venture doesn't necessarily disclose that there

9

is a new product as -- as might be the case normally

This is --

This is a joint venture

Therefore, the fact that there is a

10

which you would expect the joint venture to set its own

11

price for.

12

Therefore, it seems to me that if the joint

13

venture is clearly going to cover pricing, the joint

14

venture agreements, the documents that indicated the

15

joint venture at the beginning, should have mentioned

16

pricing.

17

not do so, and in fact, the claim on the other side, as

18

I recall the briefs, is that when the Government looked

19

at the joint venture, prior to its going into effect,

20

nothing was said about fixing prices -- setting prices.

21

And yet, my understanding is that they did

So my question is, did the joint venture, as

22

indicated by documentation, say in any -- so many words

23

that the joint venture is going to set prices for these

24

two -- or for the -- the -- whatever it -- whatever it

25

sells?

And -- and number two, if -- if the answer to

5
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

that is no, should we regard the joint venture as

2

covering pricing?

3

MR. NAGER:

4

to your question is -- is yes.

5
6

I believe the -- the short answer

JUSTICE SOUTER:
Which?

7

(Laughter.)

8

MR. NAGER:

9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

10

There were two questions.

MR. NAGER:

The first question.
Okay.

I think it is undeniable -- and

11

Mr. Minear can speak on behalf of the FTC to this.

12

think it is undisputed that the Government understood

13

that this joint venture was a consolidation of both the

14

refining assets of the two companies, as well as the

15

marketing functions of the two companies, and that it

16

would own the gasoline and it would decide how to sell

17

it and what price to sell it at.

18
19
20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I

I don't --

Is there a document that we

could look at that -- that says that?
MR. NAGER:

I don't know off the top of my

21

head, Justice Souter, whether there's a specific

22

document that says marketing includes pricing.

23

don't think that anyone had any doubt that this

24

included pricing.

25

course, in bringing their challenge, haven't framed

But I

And indeed, the respondents, of

6
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

this as a challenge to the ability and right of the

2

joint venture to set its prices. What they've

3

challenged is the subsequent decision that was made to

4

sell the Texaco-branded Equilon gasoline and the Shell-

5

branded Equilon gasoline at the same price.

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, taking that point

7

just a bit further, your reply brief -- the reply brief

8

for -- for Shell says that the respondent has conceded

9

that the pricing decision to sell at the same price was

10

not made till 8 months afterwards.

11

that's quite a fair statement.

12

with its suggestion that there might have been an

13

agreement even before the joint venture to have single

14

pricing.

15

I'm not sure that your yellow brief correctly

16

characterized their position.

17

I'm not sure that

That isn't inconsistent

They just waited until 8 months to do it.

MR. NAGER:

So

Tell me if I'm wrong.

Well, I -- I think that that's a

18

-- a fair interpretation of one possible understanding

19

of their brief, Justice Kennedy.

20

matters for this Court in deciding this case whether

21

there was discussions by the owners of the joint

22

venture earlier than the time of September of 1998

23

whether they were going to unify the prices or not.

24
25

I don't think that it

The -- the important point for this Court is
that this was an efficiency-enhancing joint venture.

7
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

The Ninth Circuit didn't question that.

2

efficiency-enhancing joint venture, it is entitled to

3

set the prices of its product, whether it decides to do

4

it 8 months after the venture is in operation or 2

5

months before, as long as what they're doing is setting

6

the prices of the products of the venture itself.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

And that in an

Well, it would depend.

8

That's why -- really it's a question for Mr. Alioto,

9

but I want to know chapter and verse citations.

10

Pan Am and Grace meet before they set up

11

Panagra.

12

do they say?

13

have the power to set price.

14

have the power to set price but never below $14 a

15

ticket.

16

to do there?

17

Of course, they talk about price.

But what

Suppose what they say is you, Panagra,
Normal.

That wouldn't be normal.

You, Panagra,

What are they trying

They're trying to protect Grace.

So I think a lot would depend on what they

18

said in the preliminary meeting, and of course, what I

19

want to know is this is a summary judgment motion

20

where, as the other side pointed to particular

21

conversations that they made which would say it's more

22

like the second than the first.

23

MR. NAGER:

Well, what I can say to that,

24

Justice Breyer, is our opponents have repeatedly

25

pointed out in their briefs deposition testimony that

8
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

the parties refused to discuss price with each other

2

before they had an actual memorandum of understanding

3

out of concerns about the antitrust laws.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

It may be, but still at some

5

point they discussed it and I would like to know what

6

they said.

7
8
9

MR. NAGER:

Well, I'll have to leave that for

the respondents to address for you.
But what -- what the court below pointed to

10

was conversations that took place in the spring of 1998

11

about a strategic marketing initiative.

12

after the formation of Equilon, after Equilon was

13

operational.

14

have at that point with the owners of Equilon having

15

left the market is Equilon subject to the direction of

16

its owners setting the prices for its products, and it

17

could sell them as Shell gasoline, it could sell them

18

as Texaco gasoline, it could choose to sell them as

19

something else.

20

And this is

And at that point, all you conceivably

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Then what did it mean -- I

21

think you said it in your brief -- that there -- both

22

brands were sold exclusively by Equilon after the joint

23

venture created -- was created.

24

2

MR. NAGER:

I'm not sure what the reference

3

is, Justice Ginsburg.

4

Equilon had its own marketing strategy, and Motiva, the

5

other joint venturer, had its own marketing strategy.

6

The -- the role of the owners at that point was on a

7

members committee, which -- as a typical board of

8

directors where the -- each CEO of each joint venture

9

had to present a business plan and obtain approval by

Once the joint venture existed,

10

11

upcoming year.

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Were the parties

13

indifferent as to how much of each brand was sold?

14

Texaco didn't care if Shell got 90 percent of the

15

sales?

16

It just didn't care?
MR. NAGER:

Well, I don't think we could say

17

they didn't care because there were, as part of the

18

joint venture agreement, brand management protocols to

19

preserve the equality of the brands.

20

venture.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But -- but if they cared,

3

doesn't that show that there was still an element of

4

competition, but the competition is suppressed if the

5

price is the same?

6

MR. NAGER:

Not in -- not for -- with regard

7

to Equilon because why they care, Justice Kennedy, is

8

that -- that they licensed these brand names to the

9

joint ventures and they maintained control of the asset

10

that they licensed, their name, because they operated

11

in other markets where they weren't in competition with

12

Equilon and Motiva.

13

countries around the world, selling branded gasoline,

14

unbranded gasoline, and other petroleum products.

15

as with any licensor, they care that the -- that the

16

goodwill that they're licensing is not impaired.

17

like any licensor, they put restrictions on the ability

18

of -- of the joint ventures to disparage those names or

19

to undermine those names.

20

They did do business in other

So

But the decisions as to how to market and

21

what to sell and at what price to sell was the single

22

entity Equilon in the western United States, and that's

23

why it's not covered by section 1, much less subject to

24

per se analysis.

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

One more question and then

11
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

-- how was it decided how much raw gas would be

delivered to the venture by the two parties?

That was a decision made by

It could

And it -- the -- the petroleum

10

managers of Equilon or Motiva would make the decision

11

as to which petroleum products to make out of that

12

crude.

13

What's important to remember here is that

14

Sherman Act doesn't apply to any agreement.

15

Court's decision in Copperweld, it applies to decisions

16

between independent actors, that section 1 applies to

17

concerted activity, not to unilateral activity, so that

18

in Copperweld, a parent could not enter into a

19

conspiracy with its wholly owned subsidiary.

20

Copperweld, the Court -- the Court points out that the

21

officers of a company may enter into agreements with

22

each other, but they don't enter into agreements

12
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

the Court was talking about in Copperweld in getting to

2

its decision in Copperweld, is you have a agreement of

3

Shell and Texaco, which is plainly subject to section

4

1, to create this joint venture and can be challenged

5

on a rule of reason analysis.

6

agreement, you now have the directors of a single

7

entity determining what the prices of its products will

8

be, and that is not subject to further section 1

9

scrutiny.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But once they have that

Well, do you acknowledge

11

that the rule of reason analysis of the -- of the

12

initial formation can include a rule of reason analysis

13

of whether it -- it would violate the -- the Sherman

14

Act to -- to have the new entity price both products

15

the same?

16

MR. NAGER:

Yes, Justice Scalia, but I don't

17

think that anyone would ever do that in a rule of

18

reason section 1 analysis.

19

rule of reason section 1 analysis is whether the

20

combined entity would have the sufficient market power

21

to engage in supracompetitive pricing.

22

repeatedly said in section 1 cases it doesn't ask

23

whether the specific price set is a reasonable price --

And you're saying now we're

going to go look at their prices that they set and

9

decide if they're reasonable?

MR. NAGER:

Well, what I -- what I tried to

11

say, Justice Breyer -- maybe I should change my answer

12

to no.

13

the -- at -- that are involved in the creation of the

14

joint venture -- all of them can be considered as part

15

of a rule of reason analysis.

16

But what I tried to go on to say to Justice

17

Scalia was no one doing that rule of reason analysis

18

would care about what the specific price is.

isn't what they would look at.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

further if there's no market power.

MR. NAGER:

14
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

1-800-FOR-DEPO

respondents made a conscious litigation choice in the

district court to waive a rule of reason claim.

economic justifications, and what it -- and the only --

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Mr. Nager, what if you had a

wouldn't be so crazy -- in which it was just like this

we'll use one fleet of trucks and -- and we'll have one

the venture retained the -- the power to determine the

and they decide to fix the price.

1

be subject either to quick look or per se analysis,

2

wouldn't it?

3

MR. NAGER:

I think the answer to your

4

question depends upon facts that you haven't stated.

5

If the original joint venture is a sham for a

6

horizontal arrangement --

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, I'm assuming there --

8

there are, indeed, efficiencies to be attained by it so

9

that it's not a sham.

They just retained -- they said,

10

look, we're -- we're still using our old brands,

11

ostensibly, in the market and we're retaining the power

12

to set the price individually with respect to the gas

13

that is sold under those brands.

14

MR. NAGER:

So no sham.

Well, I'm not sure at that point

15

that they've entered into an agreement to share the

16

risks and loss -- of profit and loss from the assets

17

that they're putting together.

18

decision in Maricopa County says that that's the

19

critical test.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I mean, this Court's

21

saying in practical terms that my hypothesis is -- is

22

just a practical impossibility?

because you get to ask the questions.

No, no, but -- no.

really your -- your point that I've come up with a

hypothetical which is just a non-real-world

hypothetical?

9

MR. NAGER:

It's a big country, and there are

10

a lot of things that happen out there and so I can't

11

assume that I want you going back to chambers thinking

12

that it can't happen.

13

can happen --

14

I want to answer it even if it

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay.

Assuming it can

15

happen, in -- in that case, would the subsequent

16

agreement as to price be subject to per se or a quick

17

look analysis?

18

MR. NAGER:

I don't think so.

It's like a

19

law firm.

20

together with my partners, we may agree in our

21

partnership agreement that each partner is going to

22

have some control over what their billing rate is.

23

24

as we're sharing the risks and loss of that activity --

25

that may be a stupid thing --

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yes, but there's -- there's

2

one part of the lot that you haven't thrown in

3

together, and that's the pricing lot.

4

example, your -- your law firm agreement would be each

wants to charge $15 an hour, his choice.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY P. MINEAR

10

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

11

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

12
13
14

MR. MINEAR:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The court of appeals erred in this case in --

15

in its ruling that a alleged agreement between two

16

noncompeting owners of a joint venture respecting price

17

is a per se violation of the Sherman Act.

18

And this is not a per se violation for two

19

particular reasons.

20

not a sham, but rather a lawful efficiency-enhancing

21

integration of economic activity.

22

parties in this case do not compete with one another or

23

the joint venture in the selling of the product.

24
25

First, the venture in this case is

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And second, the

Respondents don't

concede that the joint venture is lawful, though.

1

MR. MINEAR:

As this case comes to this

2

Court, that's a necessary conclusion of the court of

3

appeals determination.

4

parties -- the respondents had argued that this was a

5

patently anticompetitive joint venture, and the

6

district court rejected that, and it said at page 68 of

7

the Texaco petition appendix that no reasonable jury

8

could find that this joint venture is patently

9

anticompetitive.

In the district court, the

And it further found that respondents

10

did not make a rule of reason challenge to the

11

legitimacy of the joint venture.

12

So as the case came to the court of appeals,

13

it came to it with that ruling, and the court of

14

appeals itself at pages 4a and 5a of the petition

15

appendix --

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, in the Citizens

17

Publishing case, it wasn't a necessary predicate of the

18

Court's ruling there to find that the joint venture was

19

unlawful, was it?

20

MR. MINEAR:

No, it wasn't, but we don't

21

think that Citizens Publishing has a direct bearing on

22

the case here.

23

per se analysis and joint ventures have evolved beyond

24

the simple statement that was made in Citizens

25

Publishing.

This Court's reasoning with regard to

Instead, the Court looks to the question

20
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

of whether or not the agreement at issue is plainly

2

anticompetitive.

3

And as this Court's decisions in cases such

4

as BMI and NCAA have recognized, the -- simply

5

attaching the moniker of price fixing or price

6

unification is not sufficient to answer the question,

7

the fundamental question here, which is, is there

8

actually a fixing of prices between two parties that

9

are in competition?

That's not the case here.

10

The price unification agreement that's

11

alleged in this case is -- arises out of a joint

12

venture in which, by the very nature of the joint

13

venture itself, the two participants no longer compete,

14

and in the absence of such competition, this is much

15

like a merger.

16

parties had merged their downstream operations, they

17

would be able to choose whatever prices that they

18

chose.

19

And in the same way that if the two

Likewise, the same applies with regard to the

20

joint venture, and it's particularly true that this

21

cannot be subject to a per se analysis.

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, the two parties

23

obviously don't compete within the terms of the joint

24

venture, but they compete more generally.

25

MR. MINEAR:

That's correct.

And with regard

21
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

to --

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And you couldn't have

3

two companies say we're not going to -- we're going to

4

have a joint venture on this corner, but in -- you

5

know, down the block, we're going to compete, and then

6

it's all right to set prices on this corner but not

7

down the block.

8

MR. MINEAR:

That's correct.

And so an

9

agreement outside the joint venture to take -- to enter

10

into anticompetitive activity outside the joint venture

11

is subject to further analysis.

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But didn't we have

13

competition even within the joint venture for a few

14

months?

Because -- correct me if I'm wrong on the

15

facts.

I thought for a few months the -- the price

16

differential was maintained.

17

cent price differential or something like that.

18

long as that was maintained, weren't they competing?

19

MR. MINEAR:

I think there was a 2

No, Your Honor.

And so

The -- the

20

decision, once the joint venture took effect, as to how

21

the products would be priced, was simply an allocation

22

of the profits of the joint venture.

23

competition between Texaco and Shell.

24

the formula for determining --

JUSTICE SOUTER:

There's no actual
That was simply

2

two stations in front of me and one was selling gas 2

3

cents cheaper, I'd -- I'd go to the one that was 2

4

cents lower.

5

I mean, if I had

Isn't that competition?

MR. MINEAR:

Yes, Your Honor.

But in -- in

6

that regard, there's competition at the pump, but

7

there's no competition -- as between those two gas

8

stations, but there's no competition between the owners

9

of the joint venture here, Texaco and Shell.

10

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Because that differential

11

was not reflected in what their agreement provided that

12

each could respectively take out of the joint venture.

13

MR. MINEAR:

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's exactly right.
That's exactly right.

I

15

would have thought there's no competition because there

16

are not two independent decision-makers.

17

MR. MINEAR:

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

19

That's correct.
It has nothing to do with

the prices that end up.

20

MR. MINEAR:

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

And in fact -Maybe you could explain to

22

me how this did work.

23

which might be not correct, is we have some facilities

24

that refine gasoline and there are some people who take

25

the gasoline that is refined and they sell it to gas

The -- the -- my understanding,

Now, those facilities and those people now

to say what price it's being sold at.

Who decides it?

MR. MINEAR:

Is

So somebody has
Equilon's gas.

Well, that's the factual dispute

that the court of appeals recognized in this case.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

11

MR. MINEAR:

All right.

What is it?

Texaco and Shell take the

12

position that simply this is a decision that's made by

13

the owners of Equilon or Equilon itself --

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

No.

I imagine there are

15

some human beings in Equilon called marketers, and

16

those human beings in Equilon who work for Equilon

17

would say Equilon will sell the refined gasoline to gas

18

stations at such-and-such prices.

19

a company works.

20

this?

21

That's normally how

Is there something different about

MR. MINEAR:

No, there isn't.

And in fact,

that is why this cannot be analyzed under the per se

This is simply a situation in which a single

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. MINEAR:

Respondents' view is that there

2

was an agreement that was entered into, an alleged

3

agreement, at the time of formation of this entity, in

4

which Texaco and Shell agreed to set the Texaco product

5

and the Shell product at the same price.

6

United States' response to that is that cannot be a per

7

se violation of the antitrust laws.

8

there -- because the parties are not competing with one

9

another, it doesn't make any difference whether or not

And the

That is simply --

10

they've agreed to set it as the same price or different

11

prices.

12

--

13

It simply is irrelevant to the anticompetitive

JUSTICE BREYER:

The Texaco product being a

14

product that comes out of refineries that previously

15

belonged to Texaco or the Texaco product being gasoline

16

that comes out of either refinery but is sold to

17

stations labeled Texaco, or both?

18

MR. MINEAR:

Which?

It is more the latter, Your

19

Honor, that what happens in these cases the refineries

20

refine unbranded gasoline.

21

distribution centers, the terminals, and at that point

22

additives are added and the gasoline then is sold as

23

either Texaco or Shell gasoline.

JUSTICE BREYER:

I could see how

that could be a violation because it's possible that

Alderson Reporting Company

Equilon, if left on its own, would decide that its best

2

marketing strategy was sometimes to set a differential.

3

6

But now they can't do that because the two parents
have agreed that they can't.
MR. MINEAR:

But that is simply the choice

that the owners --

JUSTICE BREYER:

8

MR. MINEAR:

9
10
11

Is that what happened?

That is -- would be the same as

if the owners or the shareholders made a decision about
how two different products -JUSTICE BREYER:

That would be rather like

12

Pan American and Grace saying that, Panagra, charge

13

whatever price you want, but above all, don't go below

14

$50 because remember, we, Grace, have some ships out

15

there and we want people to take the ships.

MR. MINEAR:

Well, Your Honor, in that

situation there could be an antitrust violation, but it

would not be a per se violation.

reason violation.

20

It would be a rule of

And as this case comes to this Court, the

21

question is whether is there -- there was a per se

22

violation of the antitrust laws, and we cannot say that

23

this agreement, if it exists, was so plainly

24

anticompetitive that it can be condemned without a

further inquiry into the nature of the relationship

Souter referred to earlier where if the two parties

entered into a joint venture and then the owners of the

11

of their products outside the joint venture -- in that

12

situation, under the ancillary restraints doctrine, the

reasonably necessary for -- to fulfill the purposes of

the joint venture?

16

The ancillary restraints doctrine does not
It applies to a situation that Justice

But that's not what we have here.

The

itself, and even under a rule of reason analysis, the

19

inquiry would be, first, what is the nature of the

20

agreement?

21

are those anticompetitive effects outweighed by other

procompetitive benefits?

that would be made in this case if a rule of reason

doctrine.

3

In both of those cases, there simply is not a

basis for finding a antitrust violation, and this Court

should reverse the finding of the -- the judgment of

the court of appeals and reinstate the judgment of the

district court granting summary judgment to

petitioners.

This case -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Mr. Minear, you've indicated

11

that in the first 8 months, when there was differential

12

pricing, you said that was the way to allocate profits.

13

I thought they shared the profits on some other basis.

14

MR. MINEAR:

If I said that, I misspoke.

The

15

profits were shared based on a ratio of the

16

contributions of -- of assets that were devoted to the

17

joint venture.

18

could have been more like a performance-based pricing

19

mechanism, but it does -- it had no bearing on the --

20

the relative profits that either firm would make.

21

was simply a pricing decision.

22

What I meant to say, rather, was it

Equilon had to price its products at some

price, and so initially it set it at some -- whatever

prices they may have been.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And therefore, it is a

2

decision of the joint venture, not of the -- the two

3

original principals.

5

MR. ALIOTO:

No, Your Honor, for a couple of

reasons.

6

First of all, in Citizens Publishing, that

7

did not exist.

This Court did not abolish the joint

8

venture there.

What it did was it cut out the price-

9

fixing part of it only.

10

Just as the lower court said,

the joint venture there does not depend upon --

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Citizens -- Citizens

12

Publishing did not have a joint venture that had

13

advance approval from the FTC.

14

MR. ALIOTO:

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Correct, Your Honor.
And I think that makes a

16

big difference.

17

it was okay.

18

Those were made.

19

maintain a differential in the price between Texaco and

20

Shell.

21

I mean, the FTC blessed this and said

They asked for certain adjustments.
One of them was not, that you had to

MR. ALIOTO:

If it please Your Honor, there

22

are many times in which this Court has said that the

23

FTC does not have the authority or power to grant

24

immunity from antitrust violations.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In --

But the FTC, which is the

32
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

expert agency, said we don't think this joint venture

2

is an antitrust violation.

3

to that determination, which was absent in Citizens

4

Publishing?

5

MR. ALIOTO:

Don't we owe some respect

Yes, Your Honor, but I believe

6

also that you should have -- give some respect, too,

7

to this Court's prior orders and this Court's prior

8

decisions.

9

In Citizens Publishing, the Court left alone the joint

10

venture, and it separated out the pricing and took it

11

out and cut it out.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, but that's because the

13

joint venture did not include -- did not include a

14

merging of the product as it did here.

15

gasoline from both of them was merged into one

16

gasoline, which was sold and the profit of which was

17

divided between them.

18

each of the newspapers continued to sell its own

19

newspaper and to -- and to reap whatever profit it

20

could make from its own newspaper.

That's

21

fundamentally different from here.

There -- there

22

still is competition between the two newspapers.

23

Here, the

MR. ALIOTO:

In -- in Citizens Publishing,

In all due respect, Justice

24

Scalia, they did not join the gasoline.

to set the price of that.

MR. ALIOTO:

think it's different because some people have always

products in order to make the joint venture work.

executive officer of Texaco and others specifically

said that the -- that the pricing had nothing to do

with the cost savings or the --

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, that's right.

9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, that's true, but Mr.

10

Minear had a response to that, it seems to me, a kind

11

of blanket response, and he said that's only relevant

12

unless you are dealing with pricing decisions between

13

competitors.

14

correctly, that is clear is that under the undisputed

15

portions of the joint venture agreement, the price at

16

which the products were sold, high, low, differential,

17

no differential, did not affect the distribution of

18

profits as between the two joint venturers.

19

they were not competing with respect to the pricing,

20

and therefore, the -- your -- in effect, your whole

21

argument collapses because you don't have, on any

22

analysis, an agreement between two competitors.

23

And the one thing, if I understood him

MR. ALIOTO:

Therefore,

But, Justice Souter, Citizens

24

Publishing -- they did exactly the same thing.

25

pooled their profits under a -- under a formula that

was very similar to the formula here.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

But they were competitors.

3

They were -- each one of them sold its own newspaper.

4

All they merged was -- was their publishing facilities.

5

And when they agreed separately not to -- to charge

6

the same price for the newspaper, that was not part of

7

the joint venture.

8

between competitors.

certainly before they were major competitors.

Shell and Texaco were -- operated

But look what happened here.

All of the

costs that were -- all of the cost savings in this

situation -- there are -- to show how -- to show the

anticompetitive effects of what happened, in this case,

Let me go back for a second.

I'm just trying to get it clear.

Citizens Publishing was a case where the district court

created a decree.

it.

And then they

And the question was -- for the

MR. ALIOTO:

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now --

I'll go back and look at

Yes, Justice Breyer.
If so, if I'm right on it,

12

then what we're lacking from your point of view here is

13

a claim that this whole joint venture is unlawful.

14

I agree with you.

15

think the FTC can insulate it, I guess, unless there's

16

something I don't know about, but you're not making the

17

claim anyway.

18

And

If you make that claim, I don't

So here, unlike Citizens Publishing, we're --

19

we have to deal with this on the assumption that the

20

joint venture is lawful.

MR. ALIOTO:

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

23
24
25

Even -I don't see how to get out

of that, but maybe you can tell me I can.

But wait.

Now, what I'm trying to get at is what
precisely is your claim, given the lawfulness of the

Alderson Reporting Company

joint venture?

2

One part I see.

One part I see is that the

3

people who are setting the prices are the board of

4

directors of a venture company who represent Shell and

5

Texaco.

6

Scalia's objection.

Now, that might run up against Justice

7

But I want to sure -- sure I have all of

8

them.

9

claim you're making here in respect to an agreement

That is, I want to know if there's some other

10

between Shell and Texaco as to Equilon's prices.

11

if so, what is it and where is the reference in the

12

record?

13

MR. ALIOTO:

And

Taking each of the questions

14

that you asked, Justice Breyer, first, Citizens

15

Publishing was section 1 and 2 and subsequently --

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

17

MR. ALIOTO:

18

Second, in Citizens Publishing, the

19

lawfulness of the joint venture, like here, even if you

20

posit that the joint venture is lawful, it -- the

21

pricing must be -- must be necessary in order to

22

achieve those -- those savings in order to be

23

justified.

Okay.

When there's no connection, it's just a
straight, naked restraint, and even if it were -- even

were so and they had all these cost savings, in the

face of all of those lowered costs and the lowest crude

question, which for me was the most important, because

I can read Citizens Publishing, but it's going to be

tough for me to find in the record any claims that you

make that the two companies have agreed as to price,

What differences this from -- from

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I can understand your

10

argument if we were doing a rule of reason analysis.

11

Is that something that can properly be analyzed on

12

quick look or per se?

13

MR. ALIOTO:

Absolutely, Your Honor, because

14

first of all -- first of all, with regard to Citizens

15

Publishing, it is per se.

16

Secondly, with regard to quick look, look

17

what you have.

18

-- as you've said before in your decisions, first you

analyze the restraint.

20

directly on price.

21

not something doing something like less supply to fix

22

the price.

23

First you analyze the -- as we've said

What is it?

It's a restraint

It's not covered up any way.

It's

It's directly at the price.
The second thing is, in doing that, is this

24

restraint necessary, not less -- not much -- essential

-- is it necessary to -- to get the -- what you're

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is it necessary to

May I ask a very naive

4

question?

Is -- this is basically the same commodity,

5

gasoline.

They have different attitude -- additives,

6

but basically costs the same.

7

are the same.

8

-- now that they're marketing this under one joint

9

venture, why should they make a difference in the price

10

Facilities to produce it

Why should they -- should there be from

of what is basically the same commodity?

11

MR. ALIOTO:

There are two answers to that,

12

Justice Ginsburg.

13

commodity because they said -- they were asked and they

14

said it was different.

15

They seem to think that it's different.

First of all, they are not the same

They maintain the difference.

16

Secondly --

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, what difference

18

physically is there other than they have different

19

additive -- additives?

20
21
22

MR. ALIOTO:

That's what they say, Your

Honor.
Secondly, if Equilon were given the right to

23

do its own pricing, if they had given all of that right

24

to them, and that they weren't the real puppeteers, as

25

it were, that would -- might be a different situation.

It's awfully dicey as to whether they should

very least, they should structure it in a way that the

Don't

represent Shell, half of whom represent Texaco.

the venture they come up with.

MR. ALIOTO:

They come -- then, if it please

21

Your Honor, that after I pointed out that the restraint

22

is directly on price, which should be a red flag to

anyone, and also that I pointed out that there is no

reasonable relationship between the pricing and the

cost, the savings, for the joint venture, the last

issue on that is whether there's any justification.

And what justification is there?

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

There's none.

But I don't -- I don't

4

understand, Mr. Alioto, if the profits are -- are not

5

traceable to how much of -- of the two products are

sold, if the profits aren't divided that way, why

7

should the two lines be continued to be marketed

independently?

in -- in the business world for that.

There's no other analog I can think of
There -- there's

10

no motive to make one any cheaper than the other once

11

the profits are shared evenly, and that's the structure

12

of the venture.

MR. ALIOTO:

Mr. Chief Justice, I believe

6

this Court has been consistently clear on this topic.

7

You cannot even think about or touch price unless you

8

have some specific, necessary connection to the joint

9

venture.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

Really?

Suppose we walk

11

into a department store.

12

see three perfume counters, and there are three

13

salesmen, one behind each.

14

The answer is obvious.

In the department store, we

Of course, not.

15

MR. ALIOTO:

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

17

Do they compete in price?

Three sales persons?
Yes.

Three counters.

They

sell perfume.

18

MR. ALIOTO:

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.
Of course, they don't

20

compete.

21

run that way?

22

can't prove it has to be run that way.

But do we know the department store has to be
I mean, maybe some places it isn't.

Of course --

1

Maybe they could compete.

2

The reason that -- the law says they don't

3

have to compete is because the law thinks in general

it's a reasonable way to run a department store without

forcing your sales people to compete.

joint venture.

7

price set at a central place, but the reason they set

8

it at a central place, because it's a joint venture.

9

And that's seems to me what the cases are consistent

10

with.

11

And similarly, a

You can't prove they have to have the

You tell me which one is it.
MR. ALIOTO:

The danger -- the danger,

12

Justice Breyer, is this.

13

that two major competitors in a major industry, that if

14

they get together from -- for some joint venture,

15

whatever it is, that they're then allowed to fix the

16

price?

17
18
19

JUSTICE BREYER:

Is the Court going to say

Oh, the answer is no.

You're right.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

But, Mr. Alioto, your

20

argument, I think, is assuming that the facts in this

21

case are like the facts in what I think I called my --

22

my crazy joint venture hypothetical in which the two

23

principals agreed to a joint venture, but they accept

24

in a clear and unequivocal way the pricing decisions.

25

And -- and it seems to me that the -- two

52
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1
2

things have come out of this argument.
Number one, you don't make that assumption,

3

and that assumption is -- is not supported by the facts

4

of this case.

5

And number two, Mr. Minear comes back and

6

says as long as the division of profits under the joint

7

venture agreement does not depend on these pricing

8

decisions, they are not competitors, and therefore it's

9

irrelevant anyway.

10
11
12

Doesn't your argument run against -- crash
against one or the other or both of those answers?
MR. ALIOTO:

I don't think so.

The second

13

one made by counsel for the Government runs directly

14

against Citizens Publishing.

15

Your Honor.

16

Publishing be reversed.

17
18
19

That was in the case,

And no one has suggested that Citizens

And the second part is in fact they did that.
They did act independently for at least 8 months.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, they did not change

20

the price for at least 8 months.

21

MR. ALIOTO:

No.

In between, they didn't --

22

they didn't change the price.

23

in the price.

24

then they instructed the joint venture to make the

25

prices the same.

They didn't get involved

Then they came up with their program and

JUSTICE SCALIA:

2

MR. ALIOTO:

3

Mr. Alioto --

Not the joint venture doing

that.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Who -- who is it that you

5

would have had the price set by?

6

MR. ALIOTO:

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That would be -I mean, it's their gas.

8

Okay?

9

Who -- who would have set the price if -- if we said

10

They're marketing it through their stations.

it's -- it's bad for Equilon to do it?

11

MR. ALIOTO:

If they gave them independence

12

and if there were some relationship with the joint

13

venture --

14
15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Gave whom independence?

Gave whom --

16

MR. ALIOTO:

Gave Equilon and to Motiva.

If

17

they gave them independence to make their own judgment

18

-- maybe Equilon would like to make Texaco a lower

19

price.

20
21

Maybe it like to make it a -- a discounter.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

They did give them

independence.

22

MR. ALIOTO:

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

24

MR. ALIOTO:

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No.
That is --

Precisely did not.
They gave their board of

Washington, DC 20005

1

directors independence.

2

was composed, as -- as boards of directors of joint

3

ventures are, by the parties to the joint ventures.

4

MR. ALIOTO:

Now, the board of directors

I'm not -- I'm not sure how it

5

is in other situations.

6

have these two oil companies who are directing this and

7

pretending that the decisions are being independent,

8

that is not the fact in this case.

9

wrong, Justice Souter, for two of these to read the way

10

All I'm saying is when you

And there's nothing

they did because they did it in our case.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

12

question?

13

in this case?

Who -- have you answered my

Who would you have wanted to set the price

14

MR. ALIOTO:

Shell and Texaco should have

15

done this.

16

Equilon for these -- for these cost savings.

17

Equilon, can make the price decisions if you want to.

18

Or they could say, you make the gasoline, give it to

19

us, like GM and Toyota, and we will separately price it

20

on our own.

22
23

25

They should have said, okay, we're making

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But I think they did say the

You -- you make the price decisions.
MR. ALIOTO:

Equilon.

Justice Scalia, they did not.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

55
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

1

that Equilon is in reality a joint venture of -- of the

2

two -- the two gasoline companies.

3

MR. ALIOTO:

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

5

MR. ALIOTO:

My complaint is -That's your complaint.

My complaint is that two

6

gasoline companies controlled the price that they were

7

never able to fix before.

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9
10

If that were a real rule of

reason argument, did you waive the rule of reason here?
MR. ALIOTO:

I -- I waived the rule of reason

11

argument with regard to showing market power and -- and

12

impact on the market.

13

-- and under footnote 39 of NCAA.

So is the answer -- in --

16

in case the Court does not agree with you, can you then

17

say, I would like to resurrect rule of reason or do you

18

agree with your adversary that -- that that's out of

19

the case because you forfeited it?

20

MR. ALIOTO:

If you do it, as was noted in

21

California Medical, where you have this whole line from

per se to the end on rule of reason, and in between on

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GLEN D. NAGER

16

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

17
18

MR. NAGER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

I

have three quick points.

19

One, just to bring us back to the stipulated

20

facts of this case, I'd ask the Court to check the

21

joint appendix, page 78 to 79, stipulated fact number

22

62.

23

after the formation of Equilon and Motiva, the pricing

24

was consolidated so that one person at Equilon set

25

prices for both the Shell and Texaco brands in any

The second sentence of that stipulation says,

57
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

given Equilon pricing area, and one person at Motiva

2

set prices for both brands in any given Motiva pricing

3

area.

4

There's never been any allegation in this

5

case that Shell and Texaco set the actual prices at

6

which this gasoline was sold at.

7

that the owners of the joint venture said that the

8

prices had to be the same between the two branded names

9

in any given area.

10

The only claim then

Secondly, with respect to the 8-month period

11

that the respondents keep pointing to, the record

12

reflects testimony that, as with any consolidation of

13

two businesses that have been separate and are coming

14

together, it took them a few months to figure out how

15

to consolidate and unify and save the $800 million a

16

year that was the purpose of this joint venture in

17

consolidating.

18

create a joint venture or merge, instantaneously are

19

able to operate as if they didn't previously exist.

20

takes a while.

21

No -- no two companies, when they

It

And the third point -- and this is the point

22

that Justice Breyer has made.

23

was created, it eliminated competition in the United

24

States for branded gasoline between Shell and Texaco.

25

That's a stipulated fact in this case.

When this joint venture

And when it

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

1

eliminated competition between Shell and Texaco, there

2

was no further competition to effect.

3

further anticompetitive consequence that could happen

4

from the pricing of the gasoline of that joint venture.

5

There was no

It's your three counters in the department store.

6

And if there is no further anticompetitive

7

effect that can happen, there's no quick look reason

8

possible, Justice Souter, for the issue that's been

9

challenged in this case.

10

Your hypothetical goes to the

formation which they waived.

11

Thank you very much.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

13

Well, just as long as you

have a minute --

14

(Laughter.)

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- I take it that their

16

point was, what you sort of said there, that -- that

17

they had agreed -- sorry.

Forget it.

(Laughter.)
