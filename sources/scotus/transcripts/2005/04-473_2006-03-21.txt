ORAL ARGUMENT OF CINDY S. LEE

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

We'll hear argument

MS. LEE:

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

10

At its core, the First Amendment is about

11

free and open debate on matters of public importance.

12

It's about citizens' rights to participate in public

13

debate and contribute their personal opinions and views

14

whether they are mainstream or not.

15

amendment is not, however, about policing the

16

workplace.

17

of public employment.

18

Ninth Circuit's approach is accepted or adopted, this

19

is what it will do.

20

The first

It is not about constitutionalizing the law
Nor should it be.

Yet, if the

In this section 1983 action, a deputy

21

district attorney prepared a disposition memorandum,

22

First Amendmentpursuant to his prosecutorial duties,

23

setting forth the reasons why, in his prosecutorial

24

judgment, the criminal case that he was supervising was

25

likely to be dismissed.

The fact that the supervisor

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

did not agree with the content of that memorandum should

2

not give the plaintiff a constitutional right to

3

challenge adverse employment decisions that he claims

4

were in response to the product of that memorandum.

5

There are no First Amendment interests that

6

are served when public employees are allowed to perform

7

assigned job duties in such a way as to the

8

disagreement of the public employer.

9

the --

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

11

MS. LEE:

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Essentially, what

Well, I --

-- Ninth Circuit --- I suppose the public

13

might have an interest in knowing about this debate.

14

don't know if you can say there are no public interest

15

served.

16

counterbalancing first -- interests, but I don't think

17

you could say we have no interest in speech.

18

-- this is a -- on its face, a rather interesting -- a

19

rather interesting argument that they're -- that

20

they're having.

It might be that there are other

21

MS. LEE:

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

25

I

This was

When -They're interested in

criminal law, criminal procedure, et cetera, et cetera.
MS. LEE:

Well, it's our position that when

speech by public employees cannot fairly be said to be

4
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

speech as a citizen, then the Government should have a

2

presumptive right to manage its personnel affairs and

3

internal --

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, that -- yes, that's

5

something different.

6

just no First Amendment interest --

7

MS. LEE:

But your statement, that there's

Well, there's no core First

8

Amendment values that are furthered when public

9

employers have to justify employment decisions that

10

they make on a routine basis.

11
12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, why wasn't that

equally true in Connick?

13

MS. LEE:

Well, the difference in Connick is

14

that the employee -- the prosecutor in that actions

15

spoke more closely with a citizen, and the Government

16

-

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

18

MS. LEE:

19

JUSTICE SOUTER:

20
21

Yes, but I mean that's --

-- had --- that's a fine

characterization, but I'm not sure that that helps us.
In Connick, the one subject of the speech that was

22

held to be protected was the speech questioning

23

political pressure to help in campaigns and so on.

24

issue here that would arguably favor protection is the

25

issue of calling public attention to lying by police

The

5
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1

officers in criminal cases.

2

the -- that if there's a public interest in political

3

pressure, there's a public interest in mendacity in law

4

enforcement.

5

MS. LEE:

And it seems to me that

Well, if the employee is required

6

to investigate or report that kind of conduct pursuant

7

to their normal duties of employment, then that is

8

speech that the employer should absolutely or

9

presumptively have an ability to monitor.

10

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, yes, but why?

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, that's the difference,

12

not the lack of public interest --

13

MS. LEE:

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yes.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- that you're --

16

MS. LEE:

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's --

-- absolutely right.
-- pointing to, is that in

18

one case he is making this statement as an employee;

19

and you say the employer, if it's a stupid statement,

20

ought to be able to fire him for it.

21

MS. LEE:

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

In --

That's correct.
-- the other case, he's

23

making the statement as a member of the public.

24

what the First Amendment is all about is that we allow

25

stupid statements to be made.

And

Right?

Washington, DC 20005

1

MS. LEE:

If it's not part of -- if it's --

2

if it's not part of your core job duties that you --

3

that employers should evaluate.

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but it may well -- I

5

guess the point that I'm trying to get at -- and it

6

goes back to your original public-interest issue -- is,

7

let's assume -- as Justice Scalia's hypo had it, let's

8

assume that the statement made by the employee on the

9

subject within job duties -- case like this one -- is,

10

in fact, a "stupid statement."

11

wrong, it's inaccurate, whatnot.

12

whether an employer, it seems to me, should, if that

13

turns out to be the case, be able to fire.

14

it seems to me, is whether, if it is not stupid, it

15

should be totally unprotected, so that the employer

16

could do anything, even if it's an accurate statement.

17

And my understanding is that your argument on public

Let's assume it's
The issue is not

The issue,

18

interest was an argument that says, even if it's

19

accurate and they were lying and so on, that there

20

should be no protection.

21

you correctly?

22

MS. LEE:

Am I -- and do I understand

Well, our position is, whether or

23

not the prosecutor in this case made an accurate

24

statement during the performance of his job -- so, in

25

other words, if his disposition memorandum -- if the

7
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

employer accepted it and agreed with it, and the case

2

didn't go any further, there wouldn't be a basis of

3

First Amendment, because normally he is acting pursuant

4

to his job duties and it's up to the employer to

5

evaluate whether or not he's adequately performing

6

those job --

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

8

MS. LEE:

9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Sure, but take --

-- duties.
-- take the case in which

10

the employee says, "It was accurate."

11

says, "No, it was stupid.

12

I take it, in -- your position is that regardless of

13

whether the employee got it right or not, there

14

shouldn't be protection, because it's within job

15

duties.

You got everything wrong."

Is --

MS. LEE:

JUSTICE SOUTER:

MS. LEE:

The employer

Right.

It --- that correct?

-- should not be protected under

the First Amendment.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

MS. LEE:

Okay.

That's not to say that the public

22

employer is free from being challenged with regards to

23

the employment decision.

employee to seek, through the grievance procedure, that

25

decisions that the personnel in those departments are

3

more ably, I think, to decide.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And this was true."

7

press would love it.

Right?

MS. LEE:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

required to be kept -JUSTICE SCALIA:

Take it to the press.

If his job --

He could say, "I got fired for saying this.

And those are the type of

I'm assuming it was --

-- internally.
-- not required to be kept

confidential.
JUSTICE ALITO:

But if he -- if it's part of

17

his job to speak publicly, then he has no -- things

18

that are said publicly in the performance of official

19

responsibilities have no First Amendment protection?

20

MS. LEE:

In our view, no.

If it's a job --

21

if the public employee's assigned job duties is to, on

22

behalf of the Government or the employer, speak to the

23

public about certain things that are going on in the

24

office, and he happens to get disciplined for it, that

25

wouldn't pass our step.

tells the employee to go out and lie?

the truth?

MS. LEE:

There's no First

Well, I don't know if that's a --

if that's a detailed enough hypothetical.

the employee's core job duties are to report X, Y, and

Z, and that employee goes out to the public and reports

X, Y, Z, E, and F --

"Go in and make a misrepresentation to the court, or

16

conceal evidence," or whatever --

So, suppose that a supervising

20

that, or he goes in and he says the opposite, he tells

the truth, and he's fired.

22

MS. LEE:

What result?

Well, I think the plaintiff could

argue that, "That's not my core job duties.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MS. LEE:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Oh, so --

-- "pursuant to" --- so you're saying that

4

there's an exception to your rule, so that if, in this

5

case, he has a -- he has a defense if he said, "Well,

6

it's my duty to call it as I see it"?

MS. LEE:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

9

MS. LEE:

10
11
12

Absolutely -Then --

-- not.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, then, if that's so,

you ought to remand this case.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, sure you'd agree with

13

that, if it's his duty to call it or -- just as it's

14

the duty of a -- of a lawyer not to lie to the court.

15

If there was a similarly clear legal duty for him to

16

say something, you'd say that was part of his job

17

description, right?

18
19
20

MS. LEE:

That would be the required

assignments of his job.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And -- and I suppose, in

21

this case, in the hypothetical we propose, that the

22

California courts and the California bar would have

23

disciplinary mechanisms against the senior attorney who

24

hypothetically told the junior attorney to mislead.

MS. LEE:

Well, that would be an issue of

fact.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Does California have, or

have not, disciplinary procedures in the hypothetical

case where a senior attorney who tells a junior

attorney lie to the court --

14

All right.
What is the --

Well, what is it?

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What is the California

11

13

They do.

Let's say his boss says, "Don't turn over

And the employer goes ahead and

turns it over?

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

16

MS. LEE:

Yes.

If the boss makes a determination

17

that, "This is not Brady materials.

18

disclosed," and the employee goes ahead and discloses

19

it, our position is, that would not be protected First

20

Amendment speech.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I don't want that

What about -- you were

22

talking about public speaking.

23

remember, a talk that was given to the Mexican-American

24

Bar Association, and that was not something that his

25

employer required him to do, but he --

There was, as I

12
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

MS. LEE:

No, it wasn't.

And it's not part

2

of this lawsuit, because there's no dispute that the

3

communication at issue in this case is that disposition

4

memorandum that he prepared purely pursuant to his

5

prosecutorial duties.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But would have a 1983 case

7

if he were disciplined or disadvantaged in the

8

workplace because of the talk that he gave to the

9

Mexican-American Bar Association in which he criticized

10

DA office policies?

11

MS. LEE:

Then our position is, it gets past

12

step one, because it's not normally something that a

13

prosecutor is required to do, and it would be subject

14

to a balancing --

15
16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Pickering balancing, I take

it.

17

MS. LEE:

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Correct.
But I thought -- correct me

19

if I'm wrong, just as a matter of fact -- I thought his

20

1983 claim listed the speech to the Mexican-American

21

Bar Association as one of the reasons that he was

22

demoted, or whatever it was, transferred.

23

MS. LEE:

It was initially alleged, but,

24

through the course of discovery, the focus of it was a

25

disposition memorandum, because by the time he went to

13
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

the Mexican-American Bar Association, he had already

2

been disciplined, so there is no causation between his

3

public speech to the Mexican Bar Association and the

4

disciplinary actions that were --

5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

6

MS. LEE:

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, the --

-- are at issue.
-- the focus may have

8

changed, but, I mean, he hadn't dropped the -- he

9

hadn't dropped the claim that that was one of the

10

causes --

MS. LEE:

MS. LEE:

Well, in --- of the --

judgment motion.

very clear that the issue --

And that's why the district court was

JUSTICE SOUTER:

MS. LEE:

to his prosecutorial duties --

JUSTICE SOUTER:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

-- the court of

American Bar Association speech.

the memorandum, correct?

7

MS. LEE:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

10

It focused only on

Correct.
And you concede that's

Pickering balancing, anyway.
MS. LEE:

Well, in -- to the extent that he's

11

alleging that if that's -- "I went to the Mexican-

12

American Bar Association, and I alleged -- or I made

13

statements that there were some improprieties in the

14

district attorney's office," that would probably get

15

past step one and the matter of public concern, and

16

then the question would be whether or not his interest

17

in speaking as a citizen outweighed the interests of

18

the Government.

19

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But let me -- let me raise

20

this question.

21

because of the Mexican Bar Association speech, and if,

22

as you suggested in answer to a question a little while

23

ago, that anybody could go public and get at least past

24

step one of Pickering, what is to be gained by the

25

extremely -- well, strike the "extremely" -- what is to

If, in this case, he gets past step one

15
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

be gained by the restrictive view that you take that if

2

he doesn't go to the Bar Association, or doesn't go

3

public, there's no protection at all?

4

it seems to me that the public is being protected in a

5

way subject to an immediate end run.

6

MS. LEE:

In other words,

Well, I think what Your Honor is

7

really asking is, if the plaintiff in this case had

8

taken his disposition memorandum, and, rather than give

9

it to his supervisor, which what he -- what he was

10

required to do, he went to the public and gave it to

11

them on a pending case, I don't necessarily think that

12

would be protected under Pickering, as well.

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But what if he simply goes

14

to the public and says, "Look, there's Brady material

15

here, and it should be turned over, and, instead, my

16

boss is telling me to suppress it."

17

turning over his work product.

18

what you said earlier, that, in that case, you would

19

say at least he gets pasts step one of Pickering for

20

the --

21

MS. LEE:

22

JUSTICE SOUTER:

23

MS. LEE:

That wouldn't be

And I took it, from

Well, he certainly --- newspapers --

-- wouldn't be speaking in his

24

capacity as a prosecutor, but that doesn't necessarily

25

mean that his interests would be outweighed by the

16
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

employer's interest.

In --

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Oh, he might -- he might

3

ultimately lose, just the way, on all issues but one,

4

the employee in Connick lost.

5

at least --

6

MS. LEE:

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

8

That's quite true.

But

And --- there would be a claim to

go through the balancing --

9

MS. LEE:

Well, in --

10

JUSTICE SOUTER:

11

MS. LEE:

-- exercise.

-- in some respects, if you're

12

talking about job-required speech that you are -- part

13

of those duties, and the function, is to keep it

14

internally until at least there's some decision by the

15

supervisor, and, rather than do that, you send it to

16

the press or leak that information out, I think a

17

governmental disruption in efficiency can be presumed

18

there.

19

as clear that that -- that Mr. Ceballos would have

20

ultimately prevailed under the balancing.

21

he had taken the --

FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

MR. KNEEDLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

Much of the work of public employees is

10

performed by speaking or writing, and much of that work

11

concerns matters of public interest.

12

13

work have at least a presumptive First Amendment right

14

to perform their jobs as they see fit.

15

Under the Ninth

That conclusion rests on a fundamentally

16

mistaken view of the First Amendment.

17

18

absolute right to control and direct the manner in

21

concerned, it's a basic rule of our constitutional

22

structure.

2

supervisors in the executive branch be able to control

4

5

No, you take the position,

14

then, that -- going to the earlier hypothetical that

15

somebody brought up, that, say, in a Brady case, if the

16

--if the Federal prosecutor believes there was Brady

17

material that -- and let's assume he's correct, just to

18

make it a simple case -- that there's Brady material to

19

be turned over, and the U.S. attorney says, "Do not

turn the Brady material over," that if the -- if the

Oh, I'm sure --

MR. KNEEDLER:

The First Amendment would not

be the -- would not be the source of protection.

10

Whether there would be some argument that, if the

11

employee could not be fired, it would be an

12

unconstitutional condition to require him to put his

13

job at peril for committing a due process violation or

14

something like that, whether there would be a claim

15

like that, that would be a different matter.

16

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But the

But why would you recognize

18

a due process violation if you wouldn't recognize a

19

First Amendment violation?

20

MR. KNEEDLER:

Because the First Amendment

21

does not address speech that an employee undertakes in

22

the performance of his duties.

Well, neither does due

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

1

there would have to be some unconstitutional condition.

2

Well, the due process --

3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yes, but to get to the

4

unconstitutional condition, wouldn't you normally look

5

to the First Amendment?

6

MR. KNEEDLER:

My point is that the due

7

process -- due process clause does address the conduct

8

at question, which is the requirement that exculpatory

9

material be turned over to the defendant.

And so, the

10

question is that the employee would be put in a

11

position where he would -- where he would be instructed

12

not to perform what he understood to be a

13

constitutional violation.

14

laws, most ethical rules, would take care of it.

15

as I mentioned, the Federal whistle-blower statute, in

16

2302(b)(9), I think it is, has a provision that

17

protects employees who refuse --

24

MR. KNEEDLER:

25

Yes, there would be -- there

would be those sorts of restrictions.

My only point is

23
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

that the First Amendment is not addressed to speech or

2

writing that an employee undertakes in the -- in the --

3

in the course of his official duties.

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

This --

But isn't there this -- isn't

5

there this anomaly in the position that you're

6

advocating?

7

employee speech that are most likely to be disruptive

8

would be public speech that's outside of the employee's

9

duties, or internal speech that is outside of the

It would seem to me that categories of

10

employee's duties.

11

that employees are bringing First Amendment claims

12

based on largely internal speech that falls within

13

their own job duties?

14

How much of a -- of a problem is it

MR. KNEEDLER:

I think that would be a huge

15

problem, because it would effectively constitutionalize

16

the day-to-day interactions between supervisors and

17

subordinates within the Government, and put the Federal

18

Courts in charge of overseeing that.

19

cases might ultimately be disposed of on summary

20

judgment, there would be discovery, there would be the

21

burdens of the litigation.

23

position that the -- these actions were not even taken

reasons -- but this case exemplifies what the problem

2

would be, is that the employee could identify something

3

that he said or did in the course of his duties that

4

involved speech and say, "That's the reason that I was

5

disciplined."

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

But are these going to be

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, is this going to lead

to difficult problems in determining what falls within
the job duties of a particular employee?

11

MR. KNEEDLER:

I don't -- I don't think it --

12

I don't think it will, and certainly no more problems

13

than the -- than this Court has wrestled with, and the

14

lower courts have, in terms of what's a matter of

17

it's a very important place to have a clear line, just

18

as there is a clear line with respect to matters of

I think it's a common inquiry to

And I think

Suppose, in the memo here,

the assistant district attorney had said, "I think that

Recognizing Richard Ceballos's claim

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I think it's probably

5

a bit much to say that the core of the First Amendment

6

is internal employee grievances or speech.

7

the concern on the other side is that you may -- as a

8

lawyer, you may have a view of what the -- what Brady

9

requires.

And I think

Your superior may have a different view.

10

And just because that disagreement exists doesn't mean

11

that you have a constitutional right to continue to

12

voice your view when your superior has reached a

13

different decision.

14

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

I agree with that.

The

15

First Amendment doesn't bar the Government from

16

disciplining employees for insubordination or poor job

17

performance or for continuing or persisting in a matter

once their supervisor's told them to stop.

No --

1

points embedded in the question, and I'd like to take

2

them one by one.

3

With respect to the standard, the standard

4

is, if the employer makes a judgment that the public

5

employee has not performed his or her job properly or

6

has been insubordinate, so long as that judgment isn't

7

based on a censorial type motive, like, "We don't

8

tolerate criticism of the sheriff's department,"

9

something like that, then the employer's judgment

10

prevails.

11

Federal district Court has license to second-guess that

12

judgment, so long as that judgment's actually the

13

judgment that was made.

analysis that might be made in this case --

will be few such cases, though you might convince me

unclear, until this Court has spoken to the subject,

3

and especially in light of the dicta in our prior

4

cases, which says that he has to be speaking publicly.

5

The reason for the -- for the -- for the paucity of

6

cases can be, simply, that the law was not clear, and

7

most people thought the way -- the way your opponent in

8

this case thinks.

9

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

That's incorrect.

I

10

mean, most of the Circuits have addressed this

11

question, and virtually all of them are -- have sided

12

with the Ninth Circuit and has -- have refused to draw

13

a bright-line rule when speech has come up as part of

the job.

15

And the -- and as -- Justice Scalia, you seem

16

to be referring to the "as a citizen" phrase the Court

17

has used in its opinions.

18

And I want to address that.

No decision by this Court has ever turned on the "as a

19

citizen" phrase, and it's always been used in

20

conjunction with "matter of public concern."

21

that can be said is the phrase characterizes the facts

of the cases in which the Court used it.

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

But if you look at the

2

way it was used in Pickering, which, of course, is a

different case -- but, in Pickering, the Court was

4

emphasizing that public employees, like all citizens,

5

have an interest in speaking on a matter of public

concern.

8

potential wrongdoing or breach of public trust, her

speech would have presumptively been protected.

One can readily imagine a

situation?

22

Is the test applied differently in that

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

It does, because if the

23

employer makes a judgment -- as I said before, if the

24

employer makes a judgment that the employee has carried

25

his job duties poorly, incompetently, insubordinately,

54

and so on, that interest is -- it's either dispositive

2

of the balance, or it's nearly so.

3

that standpoint, the Court could put a gloss on the

4

Pickering balance that explains or emphasizes that the

5

employer's interests are controlling how the jobs are

performed, prevails.

And it -- so, from

But to get back, for a moment, to the --

JUSTICE ALITO:

9

that answer.

No, I'm not sure I understood

So, in this situation, if the employer

10

said that Mr. Ceballos was performing his job poorly,

11

that would be enough to tip the balance in the

12

employer's favor --

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

JUSTICE ALITO:

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

If that was --

If that were really the

case.

17

pretextual, because not only -- not only was that not

18

the basis that was actually offered, but the employer

19

sided with him initially and released the defendant and

20

said he had a legitimate basis for speaking, and called

21

a meeting with the sheriff's department, and took all

22

these steps to show that they actually sided with him.

23

And only when the sheriff's department accused him of

JUSTICE ALITO:

the Pickering balancing is the same in this situation

Well, this case is almost

10

employee's assigned duties were all done competently,

- if -- so long as it was the -- a private

communication like that, I don't know that the employer

would have had an interest in saying, "Well, you're

incompetent on the subject of racial balance, and

therefore I -- you know, I'm going to demote you or

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400
