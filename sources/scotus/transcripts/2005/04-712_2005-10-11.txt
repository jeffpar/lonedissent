We'll now hear

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. FREDERICK:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
This is a routine diversity case that went

11

seriously awry in the court of appeals.

12

original defendants in -- named in the complaint,

13

Petitioners State of Wisconsin Investment Board,

14

which I'll refer to as SWIB, and Lincoln Property

15

Company, are completely proper and diverse parties.

16

The

SWIB owned the apartment complex, and Lincoln

17

managed it through agents.

18

nonetheless, embarked on a search for affiliates of

19

Lincoln that it thought would be more appropriate

20

party defendants, what the court deemed, quote,

21

"real parties in interest."

22

The Fourth Circuit,

The Fourth Circuit's holdings are

23

fundamentally flawed, in two respects.

24

because the named defendants are proper parties, the

25

court erred in holding that Lincoln had not carried

Alderson Reporting Company

its burden of proof by failing to establish that

2

some non-named putative defendants might possibly

3

destroy complete diversity, and that the remedy for

4

such a possibility was dismissal of the action from

5

Federal court.

6

engrafted a, quote, "very close nexus" requirement

7

onto the test for require -- for determining the

8

citizenship of a limited partnership.

9

Second, the court erroneously

Now, with respect to the first issue, a

10

number of black-letter legal principles govern a

11

court's consideration of non-named parties.

12

Let's start with the statutory text.

The

13

diversity statute, at section 1332(a), talks about

14

civil actions, and a "civil action" is defined as

15

the naming of a plaintiff and a defendant.

16

action does not encompass those that are not named

17

in the lawsuit.

18

removal statute, section 1441(a), which also speaks

19

of civil actions, and in -- mirrored in 1441(b),

20

which says that a defendant may remove, where it is

21

properly joined and served.

22

A civil

That language is tracked in the

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, I thought (b)

23

simply enacted a special necessary condition when

24

you had a local defendant.

25

eligibility provision.

I thought it was not an

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

1

limitation provision.

2

MR. FREDERICK:

It is, Justice Souter, but

3

what -- my argument is that that language, properly

4

joined and served, simply tracks the civil-action

5

requirement under the original diversity statute, as

6

well as the removal provision of 1441(a).

7

the court --

8

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But what

Well, it's consistent

9

with it, but I -- it seems to me that it's a bit of

10

a stretch to say that anyone who is properly joined

11

and served, at least in a formal sense, is,

12

therefore, the only person who may be considered in

13

a -- in a diversity inquiry.

14

MR. FREDERICK:

What the court of appeals

15

did, and where we think it got off track, was it

16

took the -- to -- the phrase "parties in interest,"

17

and it -- and it took cases from this Court that

18

have used the phrase "real parties in interest" to

19

determine what are proper party plaintiffs, and it

20

used that concept on the defendant's side of the

21

ledger.

22

about "real parties in interest" as being

23

defendants.

24

doing it on the plaintiff's side is to ensure that a

25

defendant is not going to be subjected to multiple

And none of the cases from this Court talk

suits.

But there are many purposes --

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So, I take it your

3

answer to Justice Souter is yes.

In other words, if

4

the mistake that the court made was relying on

5

1441(b), it was a similar mistake for you, in your

6

opening brief, to put such weight on that language

7

in 1441(b).

8
9

MR. FREDERICK:

Our position, Your Honor,

is that the phrase "parties in interest" -- we were

10

seeking to find out where the court could have

11

applied that phraseology on the defendant's side.

12

And the only place that we could find, in the

13

statutes or the rules, was in 1441(b) and the

14

explanation for removal, that we were not a "proper

15

party in interest."

16

And that's why we focused on that.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Frederick, what

17

about cases where a plaintiff sues two defendants --

18

one is diverse, and the other is not diverse -- and

19

there is a motion by the defendants to dismiss for

20

want of diversity?

21

but only one of those defendants is the 'real-party

22

whatever,' and I can drop the other one, because the

23

other one is not the 'real party in interest'"?

24

Now, that's a situation where courts, even if this

25

court has never had that problem, have said, "If the

The plaintiff then says, "Oh,

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

1

2

'real party,' you can't get rid of the case that

3

way, but if it's not -- if it's not, you can keep

4

5

the 'real party in interest.'"

6

cases.

7

MR. FREDERICK:

There are such

8

Ginsburg.

And the analysis goes to whether or not -

10

occurred before the plaintiff makes that choice.

11

course, a plaintiff can voluntarily drop defendants,

12

without any consequences, and the courts have fairly

13

uniformly held that it -- that it is no

14

jurisdictional bar for a plaintiff to drop a non-

15

diverse defendant in order to ensure that diversity

16

would be present.

17

in Federal court, there is no doubt that the court

18

would have had original jurisdiction, because, on

19

the face of the complaint, the two named defendants

20

were completely diverse.

21

Of

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Ah, but the plaintiff

22

said, "This is a complicated real estate business,

23

and I want to discover whether there is -- whether

24

the 'true defendant' is a Virginia citizen, as I

25

am."

So, on the face of it, it looks like there's

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

MR. FREDERICK:

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I presume, then --

That's correct.

It --

-- that the

24

plaintiff loses, not that you get to have the court

25

find the proper defendant for the plaintiff.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

1

MR. FREDERICK:

That's correct.

It would

2

be a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, where there is no

3

defendant who would be liable to the plaintiff.

4

But what the court of appeals did here

5

was, it imposed an obligation on the defendants

6

that, in effect, confuses the obligations that are

7

in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 19, which looks

8

at whether there are necessary or indispensable

9

parties.

And what the court did was, in effect, to

10

take an unnamed affiliated entity to Lincoln and

11

treat it as the --

12

position in this litigation, in discovery or

anywhere along the line, that they sued their own

20

Did the defendant ever take the

MR. FREDERICK:

No.

In fact, in their

answer, Justice Stevens, they admitted that they

25

rule 11 that would have given Lincoln Property

2

Company a basis on which not to defend the lawsuit.

3

And so, to that extent, we think it's quite clear

4

that they are a proper party defendant.

5

We've always taken the position that if we

6

are found liable, we would pay a judgment.

7

issue is that we don't think we're liable, because

8

we think that the allegations in the complaint are

9

completely baseless.

The

And that's what the district

10

court found when it held, on summary judgment, that

11

there was not a dispute of fact as to the core

12

allegations of the complaint.

13

Returning to the point I was trying to

14

make about rule 19, there is a mechanism for the

15

courts to consider whether there are indispensable

16

parties.

17

rule 19 kind of inquiry -- Is a non-named defendant

18

really an indispensable party, such that dismissal

19

of the action is warranted? -- and to engraft that

20

onto a jurisdictional inquiry.

21

we have the Rules of Civil Procedure is, of course,

22

to follow them.

23

here was, it took that kind of analysis, but it

24

didn't follow the standards that the courts have set

25

out for applying rule 19 properly.

And what the court did here was to take a

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

2

certainly wouldn't want to say there's an

that would put the plaintiff out of court.

plaintiff is arguing that there's another defendant

MR. FREDERICK:

And, Justice Ginsburg,

8

they never sought to name or join that other

9

possible defendant.

They never brought a joinder

motion.

11

whether or not there was another possible defendant

12

that might be affiliated.

13

liability made it unnecessary, because their theory

of liability was that Lincoln Property Company, the

parent, is responsible for all the acts of its

1

to be out-of-State citizens that have a right under

2

the statutes to remove the case.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And because you

4

represent the removing defendant, it is true, is it

5

not, that the removing defendant has the burden of

6

showing that proper diversity exists?

7

MR. FREDERICK:

And we readily satisfied

8

that, both on the face of the complaint, which

9

identified Lincoln Property Company as a Texas

10

corporation, and in the remand notice, which

11

identified its principal place of business as Texas.

12

Even the court of appeals had no problem calling it

13

a "Texas parent," because the corporation documents,

14

which are part of the record, amply demonstrated

15

that Lincoln Property Company is, in fact, a Texas

16

corporation and satisfies those requisites under the

17

diversity jurisdiction provision.

18

The -- instead, what the Fourth Circuit

19

has done is to erect a standardless forum that will

20

increase litigation over jurisdiction by inviting

21

courts to make inquiry about parties and entities

22

that are not named in the lawsuit, solely for the

23

purpose of determining whether or not there are

24

jurisdictional spoilers.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

contend that's not the case, but let's say there is

2

a in-State subsidiary that's completely responsible

3

for all the challenged actions, and the in-State

4

plaintiff sues an -- only the out-of-State parent.

5

What happens in that case?

6

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, what the ninth

7

circuit, in a -- in an opinion by then-Judge Kennedy

8

that we have cited, called Simpson -- said you

9

respect the plaintiff's allegations.

If the

10

plaintiff wants to sue the parent, and the parent is

11

an out-of-State corporation, the plaintiff is the

12

master of the complaint.

13

the Ninth Circuit held that it was completely proper

14

to remain in Federal court, even though it was

15

obvious to all that there was a subsidiary that was

16

an in-State subsidiary that, if it had been sued,

17

would be non-diverse.

the error is so egregious and leads to the

difficulties that have been outlined by the Real

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, all of the evidence,

Justice Ginsburg, in the record was that EQR was a

7

Delaware limited partnership, where it was

8

registered, composed of a Texas corporation as its

9

general partner, and a limited partner that had two

10

partners that were, themselves, Texas corporations.

11

So, the evidence in the record established that

12

EQR, which was the entity the Fourth Circuit was

13

alluding to here, was, in fact, a Texas citizen, and

14

its attempt to confuse the record by suggesting that

15

there was a way to look at the citizenship of that

entity through its, quote, "very close nexus with

the State," we submit, is also in error.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

3

The judgment of the Fourth Circuit should

be affirmed for two reasons, one of which responds

to a question that the Chief Justice asked, and that

is that Lincoln Property Company was not a real

party to the controversy.

Then why did you name

it, in the complaint, as the defendant?

13

MR. JOSEPH:

Trial counsel named it,

16

abandoned the apartment management business in 1991.

2

party in interest, when, in fact, it was not.

that's what's led to the problem that we find

I take it the reason that you won this case in the

that a person called Mr. Franzen, who is a resident

talking about cases in which the named party

Where the question is,

following position, that for purposes of determining

wrong?

11

MR. JOSEPH:

And let me explain.

It's

certainly true that Lincoln identifies, at page 96

that are salient.

the chart is the relationship of any of those

merits, that he is not a real party to that

MR. JOSEPH:

Your Honor, that cannot be

4

the case, or the "real party to the controversy"

5

case means that every defendant is a real party.

6

And it's true, in this sense, that --

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But they -- let me stop

8

you on that "real party," because, as has been

9

pointed out, the "real party in interest" concept,

10

as a procedural matter, comes out of rule 17, and

11

it's talking about plaintiffs, that suits have to be

12

brought in the name of the real party so that the

13

defendant isn't in a situation where he's sued one

14

day by plaintiff A, and is not home free when

15

plaintiff B comes in with the identical complaint.

16

So, it was originally designed with, Who is the

17

proper party, the assignee or the assignor?

18

what real party -- that's what the concept is

19

familiarly about.

20

defendant?

21

That's

Who is the proper plaintiff, not

MR. JOSEPH:

Your Honor, it's certainly

22

true that rule 17 only deals with plaintiffs.

23

in the cases we've cited, including two I just cited

24

today, it applies to defendants, as well, because

25

rule 17 doesn't confine the limits.

But

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Rule 17 is about

joinder of parties; it's not about jurisdiction.

MR. JOSEPH:

Exactly right.

And we're

7

talking about the jurisdiction of the court under

8

the "real party to the controversy" test.

So, that's -- it's

something different.

to, in Carden, was in distinguishing the dissenting

opinion, in saying that if, in fact, the question

were, Which of the parties before the court should

MR. JOSEPH:

There were significant

affidavits and deposition testimony.

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

16

seems to me the Fourth Circuit rule is totally

unworkable and unprecedented.

can possibly overcome that, because the plaintiff is

19

the master of its complaint, and it can decide who

defend it by proving diversity of citizenship, and

evidence that it is, indeed, the real party to the

that they did not prove that that was not the case,

the Fourth Circuit.

6

the burden of proof, we're not in a position to

8

But it is a failure

And because of the failure of

Had --

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But the failure of the

9

burden of proof is apparently a function of the

10

Fourth Circuit's assumption that if you sue the

11

parent, you have a duty to negate the possibility of

12

suing any subsidiary; or if you sue the principal,

13

you have an obligation to negate the possibility of

14

suing any agent.

15

except out of the sky somewhere.

16

MR. JOSEPH:

And I don't see where that comes,

Justice Souter, I believe, in

17

fairness to the Fourth Circuit, on page 16(a) of the

18

petition appendix, they said that they found Lincoln

19

to be a nominal defendant, not a real party to the

20

controversy.

21

subsidiary or other entity was to determine the

22

jurisdictional characteristics.

23

reason why the Fourth Circuit found a failure of the

24

burden of proof, because they could not identify, at

25

the time of that hearing, who was the appropriate

MR. JOSEPH:

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So, everything turned on

On the nominal-party

assumption.
MR. JOSEPH:

Correct.

There's no dispute

that if Lincoln were a real party to the

10

controversy, they don't have to join every other

11

real party to the controversy.

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But if the Fourth Circuit

13

is wrong on nominal party, that's the end of the

14

case for your side.

15
16
17

MR. JOSEPH:

Not quite, Your Honor,

because there's still the burden-of-proof issue.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but the burden-of-

18

proof issue, as you've just answered my question,

19

does not arise until the Fourth Circuit finds that

20

Lincoln is a nominal party.

21

conclusion is incorrect, then there's no burden-of-

22

proof issue that has -- or no burden of proof that

23

has not been satisfied.

24
25

MR. JOSEPH:

And if, in fact, that

That is correct only if Your

Honor makes that determination based on matters that

burden of proof was.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Joseph, do I take

12

it that the essence of your position is that a

removing defendant, if that removing party is a

14

corporation, must disclose all affiliates that may

15

have been involved in the -- in the occurrence that

16

the plaintiff might have, but failed, to name as a

17

defendant, that a defendant -- although, on the

18

surface, there's complete diversity, a defendant

19

corporation must, in order to remove, identify all

20

subsidiaries and affiliates who might have been

21

sued, as well?

22

MR. JOSEPH:

No, Your Honor, that's not

MR. JOSEPH:

Your Honor, that is correct.

And they clearly were a party to the controversy.

19

But if they were not the real party to the

20

controversy, they managed, perhaps, to acquire a

21

Federal forum by virtue of stepping into the shoes

22

of the subsidiaries.

23

if they are not the real party to the controversy

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. FREDERICK:

I would waive, but for the

clarification of two points in the record.
Number one, we take umbrage at being

8

accused of a lack of candor in this Court.

9

Paragraph 22 of their complaint says, and I'll

10

quote, "All the defendants, acting through Lincoln

11

and/or their obligations as owners of the property

12

through the lease and acting by and through their

13

agents, were responsible for one or more acts of

14

common law and/or statutory negligent conduct with

15

respect to Roche's apartment, including, but not

16

limited to," a long laundry list.

17

When the parent is sued for the acts of

18

its agents, and the parent comes forward and says,

19

"We will accept the responsibility for our agents,"

20

there's no cause to be accused of a lack of candor

simply because there's no effort later to identify

who those agents are.
