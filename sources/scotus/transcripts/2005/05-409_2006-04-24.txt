CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

Mr. Frederick.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID FREDERICK

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8
9

MR. FREDERICK:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

10

This case concerns the appealability of

11

remand orders under the Securities Litigation Uniform

12

Standards Act, or SLUSA.

13

Our position is that the general rule

14

prohibiting appealability applies in this case for

15

three reasons.

16

First, section 1447(d) has been consistently

17

construed to prohibit appeal of remand orders based on

18

a district court's lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.

19

That rule governs even if the district court

20

incorrectly construes a subject-matter jurisdiction

21

provision.

22

Second, SLUSA section 77p(c) concededly

23

defines removal jurisdiction and it does so by

24

incorporating the criteria for preemption.

25

court's subject-matter jurisdiction is coextensive with

Thus, the

3
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

those cases that SLUSA preempts.

2

And third, Congress knows how to make remand

3

orders appealable when it wants to, but SLUSA contains

4

no provision for appellate review of remand orders.

5

Under Respondent's approach, the Federal courts would

6

obtain jurisdiction in cases not subject to SLUSA

7

preemption, but there's no indication that Congress

8

intended that result.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Under your approach, Mr.

10

Frederick, the Federal court would decide the principal

11

substantive issue in the case, the principal legal

12

issue, nonfactual perhaps, and then decide that is has

13

no jurisdiction if it finds that it doesn't come within

14

-- within (c), sends it back to the State court.

15

is the State court bound by -- by that finding by the

16

Federal court?

17

MR. FREDERICK:

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

19

MR. FREDERICK:

Is --

No, it's not.
Why not?
Because under this Court's

20

longstanding precedent, for there to be preclusion,

21

there must be a right of appellate review.

22

agree that the general rule of 1447(d) applies and

23

there is no right to appeal the remand order, then the

24

basis on which that order is -- is founded, the

25

preemption of SLUSA is open for the State court to

MR. FREDERICK:

That's correct, through the

State court system.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

then, or was there a basis, for Judge Easterbrook's

9

comment, it's now or never?

MR. FREDERICK:

He was wrong.

He was wrong.

The issue of preemption under SLUSA can be raised by

12

the defendants on remand in the State courts.

13

14

provision says, shall be removable.

15

defendants' discretion whether they want to ask the

16

Federal court to test whether SLUSA preempts the case

17

or to keep it in State court for the State court to

18

apply SLUSA and thereby hold that the class action

19

would be unsustainable.

It can

It's important to note that the removal

It's at the

Do we have a standard -Do we have any cases that --

22

that are like this one which are like this one which

23

involve not just res judicata of -- of the -- of the

24

finding by the Federal court, but the law of the case?

25

I mean this is the same case when it's remanded.

You've already had a court that has found a particular

element with respect to this case.

highly unusual to have the same issue in the same case

then decided by a second court.

parallel?

6

MR. FREDERICK:

It seems to me

Do you have any -- any

There are cases in the lower

7

courts, Your Honor, in the complete preemption area

8

that have held that a removal based on the doctrine of

9

complete preemption was not sustainable because the

10

case was not completely preempted, but holding that

11

preemption, implied conflict preemption, can be applied

12

by the State courts on remand.

13

And it's important to note here that there --

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

15
16

You don't have any case of

ours, though.
MR. FREDERICK:

Not that I'm aware of, but

17

what the City of Waco case says, upon which they base

18

their reliance, is that the reason why there was appeal

19

of that particular order was because it would be held

20

preclusive.

21

because there is no right of appellate review.

22

Here, it would not be held preclusive

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, is -- is there --

23

correct me if I'm wrong, but I -- I had thought there

24

was an -- an easier answer, and that is that the -- the

25

decision that ultimately the State court will make, as

6
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

to whether there is or is not preclusion, is not

2

identical to the decision that the Federal court --

3

that the district court makes on the motion for remand

4

because on the -- and this is the way I was going about

5

it.

6

On the motion for remand, all a Federal court

7

decides is whether, in fact, there is a colorable basis

8

for the removal.

9

back, to the State court, there will be an opportunity

When it goes back, if it does go

10

not to go merely to the stage of colorable basis, but

11

to litigate it ultimately on the merits.

12

what we have is a -- in effect, a kind of quick-look

13

finding at the Federal level, and that does not

14

preclude a -- a complete development of the issue on

15

the merits in the State court, if that's where it goes.

16

MR. FREDERICK:

So -- so that

That is certainly true,

17

although I would take issue with the notion of there

18

being a colorable claim.

19

removal is analogous to the Federal officer removal

20

statute where the statute itself says the defense has

21

to be under color of law, and this Court in the Mesa v.

22

California case said that phrase is where the colorable

23

claim creates article III jurisdiction.

24
25

I don't think that the SLUSA

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay, but do you take

MR. FREDERICK:

If I could just finish.

it, which is that on remand, preemption can be

developed through amended pleadings, through facts that

5

are developed --

I don't contest the rest of

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes, but you must take

7

issue with the this is only a quick determination,

8

unless you also agree with -- disagree with Justice --

9

Judge Easterbrook when he said, the decision for the

10

Federal court is only two things.

11

or dismiss the action.

12

under no circumstances will keep this case for trial.

13

Either it will dismiss it outright or it will remand.

14

It's either remand

That is, the Federal court

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, under their theory,

15

though, Justice Ginsburg, the court could, because of

16

their construction of the removal jurisdiction

17

provision, would retain jurisdiction.

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

19
20

Yes, but that was not --

certainly not the Seventh Circuit's understanding.
MR. FREDERICK:

Well, and we think that that

21

position that they have advanced in this Court is

22

incorrect, and I would agree with your postulate that

23

what the Federal district court does and it has

24

jurisdiction to do is to decide whether preemption

25

applies and then remand the case, or if preemption does

apply, to dismiss it.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Whether preemption applies

or whether there's a colorable basis for saying?

thought you were saying that the district court decides

whether preemption applies.

It's actually -JUSTICE SCALIA:

agree with what Justice Souter was saying, that all
it's -- all it's making is a colorable basis.
MR. FREDERICK:

I thought I expressed my

position there.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

In other words, you take the

14

position that -- and -- and you may well be right, but

15

I mean, you take the position that there is a complete

16

determination on the merits at the -- at the stage at

17

which the district court rules on the motion to remand.

18
19

MR. FREDERICK:

That's -- on the basis of the

record then before it.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

MR. FREDERICK:

Yes.
Well, you say on the basis

courts.

4

That's routinely done by district

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Frederick, as I

5

understand it, at least the Seventh Circuit's fix on

6

this case was that the Federal courts have adjudicatory

7

authority to do one thing and to do that one thing

8

finally, that is, to decide whether this is a case that

9

cannot be brought in any court or whether it's a case

10

that Congress has left over for the States still to

11

deal with.

12

Circuit, that this is no quick look.

13

Federal courts are making a final determination.

14

think that would exclude what Justice Souter has

15

suggested.

16

That was the whole theory of the Seventh

MR. FREDERICK:

The -- the
And I

I -- I agree with you that

17

that is how the Seventh Circuit described the opinion

18

and what -- what the adjudicatory authority was, and

19

that is why we take issue with the Seventh Circuit.

20

do think that the State court on remand has any issue

21

that the defendants want to raise before it.

22

the Federal district court has done is to decide that

23

-- that there was no basis for a SLUSA preemption

24

because the requisites of subsection (b) had been

25

satisfied.

We

All that

10
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

But I want to point out that the issue before

2

you is whether or not that decision, correct or not, is

3

appealable.

4

Seventh Circuit was that they held that that decision

5

was appealable, and under the Thermtron rule, as

6

applied in Gravitt and Things Remembered, even a

7

district court decision that is erroneous in its

8

construction of a subject-matter jurisdiction provision

9

is still a remand based on subject-matter jurisdiction

10

And what is important in the error of the

and therefore falls within the four corners --

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, it doesn't -- what

12

Thermtron says is that we read (d) in conjunction with

13

(c).

14

because it says, if at any time before final judgment

15

it appears that the district court lacks subject-

16

matter jurisdiction, the case shall be remanded.

17

Now, the reason that (c) is relevant here is

Presumably what (c) is thinking of are cases

18

where subject-matter jurisdiction is not the whole

19

issue before the -- the Federal court.

20

that subject-matter jurisdiction in certain instances,

21

like a defect in a removal proceeding, is something

22

that the -- that the Federal court could get to prior

23

to a final judgment.

24
25

It's thinking

But here, the final judgment in the Federal
court is the very question of whether this is preempted

11
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

or not.

2

thinking is that that isn't the kind of subject-matter

3

jurisdiction dismissal to which (c) refers.

4

Consequently, it is not within the scope of (d)'s no

5

appellate review rule.

6

And therefore, I guess what Easterbrook is

MR. FREDERICK:

And our problem with that,

7

Justice Breyer, is that all eight district court

8

decisions here thought that they were deciding subject-

9

matter jurisdiction, and they thought that because

10

Federal preemption ordinarily is not a basis for

11

removal.

12

And -JUSTICE BREYER:

No.

It's no doubt that all

13

the lower courts then would be wrong.

14

he says that they are wrong is because they looked at

15

the word, subject-matter jurisdiction, in (c) without

16

realizing that the reference in (c) is a reference to

17

instances where subject-matter jurisdiction is not the

18

whole issue; i.e., it's something other than the final

19

Federal court decision.

20

MR. FREDERICK:

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

22
23

he's making.

But the reason

It -- it is -That would be the argument

I would like your response.

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, functionally it is the

24

equivalent of codifying the complete preemption

25

doctrine, which is how SLUSA actually works.

And in

12
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

the complete preemption cases, Beneficial Bank is what

2

spells out this --

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

I agree with you.

You would

4

also have to say that the same rule applies, one, to

5

the complete preemption cases and, two, to sovereign

6

immunity determinations under the Foreign Sovereign

7

Immunity Act.

8

nonetheless, Judge Easterbrook would say, well, so be

9

it.

But he would say that may be so, but

That's what Congress intended.

That is wrong to

10

deprive someone of a right to appeal when it turns on a

11

misreading of (c) and an incorporation of the

12

misreading into (d).

13

MR. FREDERICK:

It would be a strikingly odd

14

result, though, for this Court to reach that, given

15

that Congress has clearly provided for appellate review

16

of remand orders in other contexts, including in the

17

Class Action Fairness Act, under tribal property

18

disputes, the FDIC, the RTC, and specifically in

19

1447(d) itself, civil rights cases.

20

how to do this if that's what Congress had intended.

21
22
23
24
25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So Congress knows

No, but isn't the -- isn't

the argument -JUSTICE STEVENS:

Mr. Frederick, can I ask

you a question?
JUSTICE SOUTER:

-- that in those cases in

13
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

which Congress has provided, we -- we are not dealing

2

with a situation in which the -- the removal or not,

3

the preemption or not is the end of the litigation.

4

Here, we've got a case in which there -- there are

5

basically two kinds of preemption, as -- as you've

6

recognized.

7

on the basis of which there may or may not be a

8

removal, and there is a preclusion of any litigation

9

whatsoever.

10

There is -- there is regular preemption,

And in the cases in which Congress has made

11

specific provision, were they -- the instances -- were

12

they instances in which it was the second issue which

13

precluded any litigation whatsoever?

14

yes.

The answer may be

I just don't know.

15

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, I think that the

16

closest analogy, again, is in the complete preemption

17

area where the Court has held that, you know, the

18

removal is based on complete preemption, and if that is

19

found by the district court, that functionally

20

terminates the litigation.

21

But I would point out that even in the

22

Federal officer removal statute, there's no appellate

23

review of a district court's decision that the Federal

24

officer statute was improperly invoked to remove an

25

action.

So what the securities defendants here are

14
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

asking for is something Congress didn't even give to

2

Federal officers.

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Let me ask you one

4

preliminary question just to be sure I understand the

5

case.

6

was filed, did the district -- Federal district court

7

have jurisdiction to decide the preemption issue in

8

your view?

Is it your view -- when the petition for removal

9
10

MR. FREDERICK:

It had the -- it had the

power to determine whether SLUSA applied.

11

JUSTICE STEVENS:

12

MR. FREDERICK:

All right.

And that's what section

13

77p(c), when it says, as set forth in subsection (b),

14

is referring to.

15

factors and it came --

16

So the district court analyzed those

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So the -- there -- there

17

was jurisdiction in the Federal court to entertain the

18

removed case.

19

MR. FREDERICK:

20

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Yes.
Then -- then why -- then

21

how can you say the -- the remand was based on a lack of

22

-- of jurisdiction?

23

MR. FREDERICK:

Because the courts held that

24

the requisites of SLUSA of subsection (b) had not been

25

satisfied.

15
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, but they -- they had

2

held it acting on an interpretation of SLUSA before our

3

decision in Dabit.

4

MR. FREDERICK:

5

JUSTICE STEVENS:

That's correct.
And isn't it at least

6

possible that they would -- would have decided that

7

issue had they reviewed --

8
9

MR. FREDERICK:

It is possible, but that's

why the issue of the underlying district court's

10

determination is not before you.

11

is can appellate jurisdiction be asserted to review

12

that decision.

13

The issue before you

But I would further point out, Justice

14

Stevens, that the Dabit court assiduously avoided the

15

kinds of claims that are present in our case, which is

16

whether or not negligence can be asserted against the

17

securities defendants for failure to fair-value price.

18

Dabit was strictly a fraud case, as this Court made

19

clear.

20

of subsection (b) which makes very clear that what

21

SLUSA is getting at are claims based on fraud.

22

This is a negligence case, and there is a part

But even if you were to disagree that the --

23

the district court had, you know, an alternate basis

24

that had not been properly ventilated or addressed by

25

the district court because it went off on the holder

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

theory that this Court rejected in Dabit, you still

2

wouldn't have jurisdiction to decide that because of

3

the general rule of 1447(d), which provides, as I have

4

stated, that a court doesn't have jurisdiction to

5

review -- appellate review of a remand order.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How --

Mr. Frederick, will --

8

would you please explain something to me that you just

9

said?

You said that our complaint isn't about fraud.

10

It isn't about deception.

11

the Seventh Circuit reported and seemed to have no

12

doubt about it that the complaints in this set of cases

13

were based on allegations of deceit and manipulation,

14

not mismanagement.

15

MR. FREDERICK:

It's about negligence.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The -- the Seventh Circuit

3

said precisely, in particular, they did not argue in

4

their briefs and did not maintain at oral argument,

5

despite the court's invitation that their suits allege

6

mismanagement rather than deceit or manipulation.

7

is that totally wrong, that you did do it -- mention it

8

in your briefs?

9
10

MR. FREDERICK:

So

The briefs recounted what the

claims are, which are negligence claims.

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Then how could the Seventh

12

Circuit have gotten it that wrong?

13

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, the Seventh Circuit

14

made five crucial errors, that it was wrong to describe

15

the district court as saying that removal was proper.

16

The district court didn't say that.

17

They were wrong to say that the remand was

18

based on section 77(d)(4).

19

district court did.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But it -- it might

5

have been that prior to Dabit, you would have been

6

emphasizing -- or whoever would have been emphasizing

7

the -- the fraud character of -- of the claims, and

8

after Dabit, perhaps the negligence boat is the only

9

one left for you.

10

MR. FREDERICK:

But the point, Mr. Chief

11

Justice, is that this is on a basis of subject-matter

12

jurisdiction.

13

say that a district court decision based on subject-

14

matter jurisdiction can look at the relevant claims.

15

It is true that the perception at the time was that

16

these holder theories evaded SLUSA.

17

up until that time of Kircher II had held that, and

18

that's not an unreasonable position for a lawyer to

19

take.

20

It's not waivable and we're permitted to

All of the courts

Now, certainly after Dabit, those claims are

21

foreclosed where there are holder fraud claims.

22

-- we obviously don't take issue with that.

23

We do

But here, the claims in the complaint

24

themselves are based on negligence, and it is certainly

Maybe this is not a

fair -- how likely is it, given our determination in

Dabit about how Congress intended to treat fraud

4

claims, that negligence claims are going to fare any

5

better?

6

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, this Court in the Santa

7

Fe case, Mr. Chief Justice, said that negligence claims

8

are not within 10b-5.

9

properly brought under State law.

Those are claims that are

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

11

MR. FREDERICK:

Would it make sense -So if the -- if the State

12

court applies Dabit and Santa Fe, it will come to the

13

conclusion that the holder theory is preempted under

14

Dabit, but the negligence theory is not preempted under

15

the Santa Fe case.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

Does it make -- what's

17

worrying me in the back of my mind is we have decided

18

Dabit since this case was brought.

19

well, could we remand this case in light of Dabit.

20

Now, if we did that, we wouldn't decide the issue that

21

you all want decided, and we'd let this, unfortunately,

22

slightly confused situation continue to exist.

23

Then I thought,

What would be the consequence of that?

Are

24

there -- are there a lot of cases, or is this something

25

that comes up often?

MR. FREDERICK:

It does come up often because

2

the securities bar, every time they get a district

court decision that they don't like, they want to

4

appeal it, notwithstanding the general bar of

5

appealability.

6

important to both sides in the development of this law.

7

So this issue is something that is very

But I would further point out, Justice

8

Breyer, that as this case has come up, your -- your

9

view would have to be based on do you have appellate

10

jurisdiction, and our submission is that you don't,

11

subject for purposes of remanding the case in light of

12

Dabit.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm trying to think.

It

seems if you -- it ought to work out similarly to what

15

happens in a case where there's a Federal issue that

you remove under.

is a State issue pendent.

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, in the Cohill case,

2

this Court addressed the situation where there was a

3

Federal dismissal of the claims and the -- and the

4

Federal district court remanded the State claims for

5

consideration under -- under State jurisdiction.

6

the Court had internal discussion about whether or not,

7

you know, there was appealability of what was left in

8

the case.

9

And

Our -- our position is that ordinarily a

10

dismissal of a Federal claim is an appealable matter

11

and that that is subject to appeal, but that a remand

12

decision, which is what the district court made in this

13

case, is not.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

15

MR. FREDERICK:

Shouldn't it work out the same?
No, it shouldn't and the

16

reason it shouldn't is because Congress has decided

17

that it shouldn't.

18

a paramount interest in having decisions made on their

19

merits, which is why there is not appellate review of

remand orders.

21

Congress has decided that there is

That's --

JUSTICE ALITO:

But aren't you -- aren't you

22

urging a very strange result that the -- the decision

decided by the State courts when the whole purpose of

and it was because --

7

No, Justice Alito, to the

They are being decided by Federal district

They're just no subject to appellate review,

JUSTICE ALITO:

I thought you said the merits

8

of the issue was not going to be decided by the Federal

9

court.

10

MR. FREDERICK:

No.

Well, the -- the merits

11

of the case are going to be decided by the State court.

12

The question of whether there's a Federal defense

13

based on SLUSA in the first instance is decided by the

14

district court in remanding the case, and then if there

15

becomes a basis through evidence or amendment to the

16

pleadings or whatnot, if the defendants want to re-

17

raise their SLUSA preemption argument, they are

18

certainly free to do that.

19
20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So he's right that it's

ultimately not decided by the Federal court.

21

MR. FREDERICK:

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, it is decided.
You're saying the Federal

23

court makes a decision which is not binding in the

24

case.

25

That decision can be undone by the State court.
MR. FREDERICK:

It is decided by the Federal

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

1

court within the confines of what Congress has

2

determined based on its wording of SLUSA and its fact

3

that, as this Court has said in Things Remembered, the

4

Congress is presumed to accept the general rule of

5

nonappealability unless it says so.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

7

Can you answer my question?

Yes, I understand that.
You -- you were

8

saying that the -- that the decision by the Federal

9

court on this issue is not final.

10
11

MR. FREDERICK:
for purposes of remand.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

13

MR. FREDERICK:

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

15
16

I'm saying that it is final

Okay, but it is not final -And that in terms --- for purposes of the

lawsuit.
MR. FREDERICK:

Because -- because what SLUSA

17

does is it has an interplay between the removal

18

jurisdiction provision and it says, as set forth in

19

subsection (b).

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I understand that, but as

21

long as you say that, the point that -- that Justice

22

Alito makes is -- is well taken, that we -- we thought

23

that this was a -- a statute designed to have the

24

Federal courts determine this issue, and it turns out

25

that the Federal court just takes the first swing at

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

1

it, and if a State court disagrees, it's -- it's free

2

to do so.

3

MR. FREDERICK:

That is a policy choice that

4

Congress made when not providing a special mechanism

5

for appellate review of remand orders.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Of course, if the Federal

7

district court says there is preclusion, therefore,

8

case dismissed, that would be reviewable.

9

MR. FREDERICK:

That's correct, and that's

10

where the uniformity of decisions would come from, the

11

reviews by plaintiffs who's had their -- who have had

12

their cases dismissed.

Those are subject to appeal.

I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.

16

MR. PERRY:

Would their -- would

No, Your Honor.

Their complaint

First, misrepresentations.

They claim that our

JUSTICE STEVENS:

22

just a little differently.

23

SLUSA from preempting.

Let me put the question
Suppose the -- in Dabit, we

But does SLUSA preempt a claim

that is beyond the scope of rule 10b-5?

MR. PERRY:

Your Honor, SLUSA precludes

3

precisely what subsection (b) says it precludes, which

4

is beyond the scope of 10b-5.

5

requires scienter.

6

So a non-scienter-based State law claim is still

7

precluded under SLUSA.

8
9

For example, 10b-5

SLUSA has no scienter requirement.

What SLUSA requires is a misrepresentation,
omission, manipulation, or deceptive device in

10

connection with the purchase or sale of securities.

11

Period.

12

They allege omissions.

All of that is present in this complaint.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But they can always amend

14

the complaint and pare it down and say now -- we -- we

15

complained all along about negligence.

16

are complaining about mismanagement on the defendants'

17

part, nothing more.

18

could have such a complaint, and would that be

19

precluded if -- if they started afresh in the State

20

court and they said, we are complaining about

21

mismanagement?

22

deception.

23

No manipulation.

Now, Judge, we

Cut out -- they

We're not charging anyone with fraud or

Couldn't -- isn't that a viable claim?

12

Dismissal and remand are the only options.

think that there was any adjudication on the merits of

jurisdictional analysis, which is to say that the only

requirement of SLUSA that goes to the jurisdiction on

10

for example, and it's well supported by history from

11

the 1870's --

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That has

But I don't think that any

13

of those cases are comparable, in that the removed case

14

is going to be tried someplace.

15

Take a diversity case.

The Federal court has

16

to decide -- and it's removed -- whether the parties

17

are really diverse.

18

diverse, it keeps the case and it's adjudicated in

19

Federal court.

20

adjudicated in the State court.

21

If it decides that they are really

If it decides they're not, the case is

But here, the determination is, is there a

22

claim to be tried anyplace?

23

under SLUSA, then it's not a question of, as Judge

24

Easterbrook put a menu, where is -- it's not a where

25

question.

And if there is preclusion

It's a whether question.

And so that makes

35

-- makes SLUSA quite different from other cases where

2

the -- the case is going to be tried someplace.

3

the decision to be made is, is this going to be tried

4

or not?

Here,

Is it -- is it a claim or is not a claim?

5

MR. PERRY:

I entirely agree with you, Judge

6

-- Justice Ginsburg, and I think that supports Judge

7

Easterbrook's opinion.

8
9

In the where will it be tried case, the lack
of appellate review is less important because the

10

merits of the case will go to State court and up

11

through the system, and any Federal issues can reach

12

this case.

13

In the SLUSA case, where the district court

14

erroneously, as we know the district court erroneously

15

did here, denies the preclusion and sends the case back

16

to State court, that is a final determination of

17

Federal law that we submit is not reviewable in State

18

court and can't be reviewed by this Court up on review

19

through the State system.

20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So that -Why do you say it is not --

21

why do you say that it cannot be examined in State

22

court if there's no appeal in the Federal forum?

23

MR. PERRY:

Your Honor, this Court has always

24

held and reiterated in the Munsingwear case that where

25

a collateral estoppel attaches because an issue has

JUSTICE SOUTER:

MR. PERRY:

6

Yes, but the --

-- does affect collateral

estoppel.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes, but -- but there is

8

also exceptions to the rule of claim and issue

9

preclusion, and when you don't have an opportunity to

10

appeal because the system doesn't let you appeal, then

11

you can say, Judge, don't give this preclusive effect.

12

I did not have that full and fair opportunity because

13

I was unable to appeal.

14

preclusion law.

15

MR. PERRY:

And I think that that's a solid

Justice Ginsburg, this Court has

16

never held that an appeal is required to give

17

collateral estoppel effect.

18

court could -- the Madison County State court could

19

give collateral estoppel effect.

20

Petitioners would argue precisely that.

21

decision of this Court stands as a barrier to that.

22

The Court would have to change preclusion law to say

23

that the lack of an appeal is a prerequisite to an

24

approval.

25

be taken into account by a court, but it does not --

Therefore, on remand, the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

They didn't have a fair chance to appeal.

And that

would be all right.

5

MR. PERRY:

And if they came out the other

6

way and said, I am going to treat it as preclusive,

7

because the Supreme Court says you don't have to have a

8

right to appeal, we'd be stuck with that.

Well, you wouldn't be stuck

MR. PERRY:

Only one mistake.
But he made another one

when he said, it's now or never for appellate review.

22

That preclusion question could come to this Court if it

Petitioners' theory, though, is if this is a 1447(d)

bar, and it was removed to Federal court, decided that

it was not precluded by SLUSA and remanded it, this

9

Court could not review it directly or indirectly, could

not review the issue of SLUSA preclusion decided by the

Federal court.

JUSTICE SOUTER:
that.

I -- I don't understand

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

is Munsingwear?

MR. PERRY:

No, Your Honor.

Our case on

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

JUSTICE BREYER:

And why --

In other words, if -- I

7

mean, it's awfully surprising -- I think that's why

8

you're getting this resistance -- that there's an issue

12

some State court says, in our opinion it is preempted.

13

They've never had an appeal.

So they get it

The whole case is tried out, and then the --

But they can't decide that.

They can't decide it

14

because there was a Federal judge who said the opposite

15

in the same case before the case was final.

16

MR. PERRY:

Justice Breyer, I think the State

that district judge was wrong.

MR. PERRY:

Justice Breyer, we would

2

certainly hope that if Petitioners were to prevail on

3

the 1447(d) issue, this Court would make clear both

4

that we could relitigate the question to State court and

5

bring it to this Court.

6

What we are saying is under the current state

7

of this Court's law, laid out in our brief and not

8

challenged in any regard by Petitioners, that is not

9

obviously the case, so that we are left with the fact

10

that a State court could give preclusive effect to an

11

obviously wrong Federal judgment that could not be

12

reviewed in this Court.

13
14
15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So you're saying we would

have to overrule Missouri Pacific?
MR. PERRY:

I think you would have to clarify

16

at least that Missouri Pacific does not apply to SLUSA

17

removals and remands, Justice Souter.

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is part of the dynamic

19

here, Mr. Perry, that if this goes back to the State

20

court, that affects the dynamics of the litigation

21

because you now have a class action that has to

22

proceed, and that a large part of the litigation

23

strategy in these cases is determined by whether or not

24

there's going to be a full trial on the merits of the

class action to effect a settlement, and so forth, so

that Congress wanted to have this reviewed quickly and

2

in the Federal courts?

3

MR. PERRY:

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Correct, Your Honor.

And --

May I ask this question?

5

Because I hadn't, frankly, realized the importance you

6

attach to the Missouri Pacific case.

7

describe it as saying that the -- the State court

8

cannot be held to have decided against a Federal right

9

-- well, anyway, the -- the point is there are two

And the way you

10

things that are decided by the Federal court when it

11

remands a case.

12

therefore, there shall be a removal.

13

One, there was no preemption, and two,

Now, as I understood the principle underlying

14

that case, the -- the correctness of the remand could

15

not be reviewed.

16

correctness of the reason given for the remand, namely

17

there was no preemption, be removed by us on

18

certiorari?

19

That's litigated.

MR. PERRY:

But could not the

Not under Petitioners' theory,

20

Your Honor, because their theory is that the inquiries

21

are completely and totally coextensive. That the

22

jurisdictional inquiry, the -- the remand inquiry is

23

precisely the same as the preclusion inquiry.

24

position is that --

Under their theory, but it

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

1

seems to me very strange to say that we could not, when

2

we do get the case on a petition for certiorari --

3

couldn't review whether it was -- whether it was in

4

fact preemption.

5

MR. PERRY:

Your Honor, I'd submit that it's

6

very strange that this would not be just reviewable

7

straight up through the Federal system, as Judge

8

Easterbrook and the Seventh Circuit correctly held.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But the reason is

10

there are two separate questions.

11

be identical.

12

to worry about whether removal is appropriate or not.

13

It doesn't have to answer that question, but it may

14

well have to answer the question whether it's

15

preempted.

16

least under a reading of the statute, but that doesn't

17

meant that you -- that just because a review of the

18

removal decision -- the remand decision is -- is

19

precluded, that review of the preemption decision is

20

precluded.

The Court certainly

21

Again, I'll return to the simpler way --

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You're -- you're positing

23

a -- a State court that's going to, by golly, give that

24

Federal decision preclusive effect even though, say,

25

the Restatement of Judgments says -- now if a decision

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

didn't -- if there was no opportunity for review, then

2

that's a ground for refusing preclusive effect.

3

MR. PERRY:

And in -- and in Munsingwear,

4

Your Honor, the United States cited that precise

5

provision of the Restatement of Judgments to this

6

Court, and six Justices of this Court held, no, if

7

there's no appeal, we are still going to give this

8

judgment collateral estoppel effect.

9

court would not be unreasonable in following this

Certainly a State

10

Court's lead, since this Court has never retreated from

11

that statement.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought Munsingwear was

about mootness.
MR. PERRY:

Your Honor, it was about mootness

15

and the result of the -- the Government's complaint

16

there was that it was going to have to live with the

17

collateral estoppel effects of the judgment.

18

the arguments they made was, well, because we can't get

19

an appeal, we won't be bound, and the Court disagreed

20

with that en route to saying, and to avoid that

problem, precisely that problem, you should have asked

2

Munsingwear turned on -- not on the availability of --

of an appeal generally, but on the mootness of the

case.

6

the order you don't like is -- is vacatur.

7

didn't take that opportunity to get rid of it, then the

In other words, Munsingwear said, look, your

And if you

It -- it doesn't -- Munsingwear

would not apply of its own force in this case.

11

MR. PERRY:

Well, Munsingwear reaffirmed

12

Johnson v. Wharton which said that where Congress takes

13

away the right to appeal, there is still collateral

14

estoppel effect of the district court judgment.

15

-- that was the previous decision that Munsingwear

16

affirmed.

mistake that had been made.

22

MR. PERRY:

MR. PERRY:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Correct, Your Honor.
Okay.

I think --

But you say

12

that when it gets to whether it's a -- there's a --

why do we have such different approaches to the

different prongs?

MR. PERRY:

Your Honor, I'm agreeing with you

on covered security.

I'm -- I'm saying that there then

5

is the further inquiry of whether all of the preclusive

elements of subsection 77p(b) are met, which is the

7

merits inquiry.

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

MR. PERRY:

Right.

And --

There -- there are very few cases

10

that don't involve covered securities because virtually

11

every security is covered.

12

that aren't covered class actions because if they

requirement there is.

That's the disconnect that Judge Easterbrook

49
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

understood so that on the face of the opinion of the

2

district court, where it recites the defendants

3

maintain that the in-connection-with requirement was

4

met, that defense, if colorable -- and it clearly was.

5

This Court has accepted it in Dabit -- conferred

6

jurisdiction on the court, and then the substantive

7

decision on the merits was the merits determination.

8

That is the decoupling that Congress did in SLUSA, that

9

Judge Easterbrook correctly recognized, and that puts

10

this case squarely within the Thermtron exception to

11

1447(d).

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How do you answer the

13

argument, the third argument, that Mr. Frederick

14

stressed that is, that Congress provided specifically

15

in the Class Action Fairness Act, a couple of other

16

acts, and 1447 itself with respect to civil rights

17

actions removable under 1443?

18

provided specifically for review of remand decisions,

19

and here the silence is deafening.

20

MR. PERRY:

In all those cases, it

In those cases, Your Honor, they

21

work differently than SLUSA for two reasons.

22

they're the whether -- not whether it will be tried,

23

but where it will be tried.

24

when it was only a where question, Congress puts in a

25

specific provision.

there's no argument that it would be within Thermtron.

Congress had

to make it.

That was just too much, and the Federal court --

MR. PERRY:

And, Justice Ginsburg, if Judge

19

Hermansdorfer had said, I'm much too busy and therefore

20

I lack subject-matter jurisdiction, it is inconceivable

21

that the Thermtron case would have been decided any

22

differently.

23

between jurisdiction and merits.

24

understands the difference between jurisdiction and

25

merits.

Congress understands the difference
This Court

Judge Easterbrook certainly understood that

court here was a merits determination not controlled by

1447(c), and therefore, appeal was not barred by

This determination made by the district

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But -- but I still

don't -- and this gets back to the question I asked

7

before.

8

unfortunate we've got a lot of subsection (c)'s here

9

but -- of -- of SLUSA incorporates subsection (b).

10
11
12

I mean, subsection (c) of 77p -- it's

MR. PERRY:

No, Your Honor.

It references

subsection (b).
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, it says what

13

can be removed is the covered class action involving a

14

covered security, as set forth in subsection (b).

15

MR. PERRY:

Just as title VII says what can

16

be brought is an action under this title or just as the

17

environmental statute in Steel Company said what can be

18

brought is an action under subsection (a).

19

The cross reference of another provision

20

containing substantive elements of Federal law does not

21

make those elements jurisdictional.

of Arbaugh.

23

There's no reason that the same principle shouldn't be

24

applied when Congress makes a Federal defense removable

25

as when it makes a Federal claim subject to suit within

That's the holding

That's the holding of Steel Company.

2

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But -- but here, what is set

3

out in subsection (b) is exactly the reason for

4

Congress' wanting to place these restrictions on it,

5

and that, it seems to me, is the sensible reason for

6

reading it the way your -- your brother on the other

7

side does.

8
9

MR. PERRY:

Well, Justice Souter, we know

from Mesa that if Congress had just made all covered

10

class actions removable, we would have to find some

11

Federal defense to support article III jurisdiction.

12

Congress, by cross-referencing subsection (b), just

13

pointed the Federal courts to the particular Federal

14

defense that is sufficient, clearly sufficient, to make

15

article III satisfied under the Mesa case.

16

that that cross reference is doing.

17

That's all

It's not, however, picking up every element.

18

If Congress wanted to include every element of title

19

VII, that environmental statute of SLUSA, it would have

20

put them in the jurisdictional provision.

21

--

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Arbaugh says

Why would it have

23

done that?

24

mean, you just say, as set forth in subsection (b).

25

You're saying if they had repeated subsection (b)

That would have been a waste of time.

there, we'd have -- the case would come out the other

2

way?

3

MR. PERRY:

Yes, Your Honor.

We have not

4

only the -- the reference there, but we have the final

5

sentence of that clause where we say after removal,

6

after the court establishes that it has removal

7

jurisdiction, it shall subject the action to subsection

(b).

Entirely

I've read the reply brief a number of

I don't understand their explanation for that.

The only explanation is that Congress made
removability contingent on the subsection (c) factors.

Thank you, Your Honor.

Mr. Frederick, you have 4 minutes remaining.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID FREDERICK

18

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

19

MR. FREDERICK:

Thank you.

I think it's

20

really important for you to look at the complaints in

21

these cases because every single one of them asserts

22

claims on the basis of negligence and the value -- the

23

fair-value pricing of the securities.

24

based on misrepresentations.

25

attempted to make them look like misrepresentations,

They are not

The other side has

and they've quoted things out of context in order to do

2

so.

3

claims that would fall outside of SLUSA.

4

But the complaints themselves are pure negligence

But even if you were to disagree with that

5

and even if you were to disagree with the district

6

court's basis for saying that remand was proper because

7

it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction, the general rule

8

of Thermtron, Things Remembered, and importantly, the

9

Gravitt case applies.

And this Court does not have

10

appellate jurisdiction.

11

have appellate jurisdiction because of the plain

12

language of section 1447(d).

13

The Seventh Circuit does not

Respondents concede that State courts can

14

decide SLUSA questions.

15

decide whether to try to remove them.

16

(d), about which Mr. Perry spoke, expressly provides

17

that certain kinds of securities actions shall be

18

remanded because Congress was not so concerned that

19

Federal courts decide everything concerning securities

20

cases, but only as to those that are expressly set

21

forth in subsection (b).

22

It is up to defendants to
And subsection

And, Mr. Chief Justice, respectfully, what

23

subsection (c) is doing with its references to

24

subsection (b) are to incorporate those criteria as one

25

of the three elements or criteria for removability.

It

55
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

has to be a covered security, has to be a covered class

2

action, and it has to meet the requisites of subsection

3

(b).

4

the last clause is simply confirmatory that if those

5

are -- are met, then the district court has to find

6

that the case shall be precluded.

7

That's the only reasonable way to read that.

And

In the Gravitt case, in which this Court

8

through a per curiam dismissed the appeal, there was a

9

dispute between the district court and the court of

10

appeals over whether the district court had properly

11

applied subject-matter jurisdiction principles in

12

deciding whether or not there was diversity.

13

Court said, no matter.

14

requisite -- that is outside 1447(d), and the general

15

rule against appealability applies.

16

This

That is outside the -- the

Now, importantly, they argue that they would

17

be precluded by -- from arguing against SLUSA

18

preemption in State court, but in fact, the last brief

19

-- the last page of our brief, our reply brief, cites

20

the Standefer case in which this Court held, under

21

contemporary principles -- and I'm quoting now -- under

22

contemporary principles of collateral estoppel, the

23

inability to pursue an appeal is a factor strongly

24

militating against giving a judgment preclusive effect.

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Do you agree that there

56
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

would be Federal court review in this Court from a

2

State court determination on the applicability of SLUSA

3

in this case?

4

MR. FREDERICK:

Yes, there would be.

And

5

there would be -- their argument about the Missouri

6

Pacific case is wrong because what the -- what was

7

going on there was the remand determination, not the

8

underlying Federal right.

9

appealed, and there would also be appeal of the

10

preclusive consequences because that would be a

11

question of Federal law under this Court's longstanding

12

determination.

13
14
15

And that's what would be

The Restatement --

JUSTICE STEVENS:
Mr. Frederick?

May I ask you one question,

Because it's important to me.

Would you agree that a complaint that alleged

16

that the defendant negligently used or employed

17

manipulative devices and so forth would be covered by

18

SLUSA -- would preempt it?

19

MR. FREDERICK:

That would be covered.

20

-- and the reason is that it is -- involved a

21

manipulation.

22

manipulation of -- of the security.

23
24
25

And

The wording of SLUSA involves a

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So the mere fact that it's

negligently caused would not preclude preclusion.
MR. FREDERICK:

What -- what we're talking

57
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

about here, Justice Stevens -- it's important -- is

2

that in how these securities get priced, was there

3

negligence in the pricing of those, that had

4

deleterious effects on one class of holders but not on

5

market-timers that we were moving in and out of the

6

market.

7

And so, frankly, Judge Easterbrook was wrong

8

for a sixth reason, and that was in saying that there

9

would have been a derivative claim here too because a

10

derivative case has to be brought on behalf of the

11

corporation on behalf of all shareholders --

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

Then the district court was

13

wrong too I guess because the district court made the

14

same --

15

MR. FREDERICK:

The district court was wrong

16

in not anticipating what this Court held in Dabit, but

17

it was not wrong insofar as it held that there was no

18

subject-matter jurisdiction because this case is based

19

on negligence and not fraud.

20

Thank you.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

22

Thank you, Mr.

Frederick.

23

The case is submitted.

24

(Whereupon, at 11:59 a.m., the case in the

25

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
