ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID I. GOLDBERG

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

MR. GOLDBERG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Eric Michael Clark was denied his Fourteenth

11

Amendment right to a fair trial.

12

the cognitive elements of first-degree murder as

13

requiring proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Eric

14

Clark intentionally and knowingly shot and killed a

15

police officer in the line of duty.

16

Arizona was permitted to offer facts to

17

circumstantially prove these mental and essential

18

requisite elements of mens rea.

19

espoused by the Arizona Supreme Court in State versus

20

Mott, as we have been calling it, "the Mott rule," this

21

evidence, as offered by the defense both in lay

22

testimony and expert testimony, was arbitrarily

23

categorically excluded as a rule of evidence that's

24

unsupported by any valid State purpose.

It was excluded with

evidence came in with respect to the insanity defense.

MR. GOLDBERG:

It came in, yes, Mr. Chief

5

Justice, as to the insanity defense, but could only be

6

considered if Eric knew right from wrong.

considered because of the peculiar adoption of an

amendment to 13-502, which is the Arizona insanity

statute, that eliminated consideration of the nature

14

and we'll ask the State when they argue -- but is the

15

16

particular way for this, so that "intent" is just

17

having the purpose to cause the result --

MR. GOLDBERG:

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If they were --- and, therefore, that

20

this testimony is irrelevant?

21

argument, as you understand it?

22

MR. GOLDBERG:

Is that the State's

As I understand the State's

23

argument, they are adopting what Justice Ginsburg wrote

24

in Montana v. Egelhoff, that the State, by enacting

25

this rule, has made this a substantive choice to make

evidence of mental illness irrelevant.

2

Arizona did not do that, and Arizona did not argue

3

that below.

4

Eric Clark knew this was a police officer, that Eric

5

Clark intentionally shot a police officer.

6

they argued the same thing.

7

in this case, by the Court of Appeals of the State of

8

Arizona, the State -- I raised a challenge to the

9

sufficiency of the evidence in addressing that issue.

However,

Below, Arizona argued, repeatedly, that

sufficient evidence from which a reasonable finder of

16

fact could conclude -- and it states, "reasonable

intentionally shot Moritz, and knew that he was a

19

police officer when he did so."

20

references that the Arizona Court of Appeals did not

21

understand that Arizona had somehow, by adoption of the

22

Mott rule, decided to redefine the crime of first-

23

degree murder, and -- as it -- we point in our opening

24

brief, they could not constitutionally do so.

talked about his mental state, correct?

3

MR. GOLDBERG:

That's correct.

But the trial

4

judge ruled, under Mott, that he was precluded from

5

considering all mental health evidence, all evidence of

6

mental disease or defect, on the issue of mens rea.

7

So, even though it was admitted, and there's no quarrel

8

here that all of the evidence that we sought to present

9

was admitted, it was not considered by the trial judge.

10

He could not.

Because the Mott rule itself is

11

categorical.

12

follows, "Arizona does not allow evidence of a

13

defendant's mental disorder, short of insanity, either

14

as an affirmative defense or to negate the mens rea

15

elements of a crime."

16

the trial judge understood it to mean that, and that's

17

the way it is applied in --

And I quote from the Mott decision, as

That states "all evidence," and

23

that as far as the insanity defense is concerned, that

if he thinks the truckdriver is an alien, or he thinks

he's an animal, and has a serious mental problem in

knowing what's going on, that comes right in, as it did

here, because it's relevant to whether he knew it was

5

There is a distinction between

2

judge replies, "You can bring that in, because if he

3

thought the driver was a mental -- was a wild animal,

4

he did not know right from wrong in respect to this

5

killing."

Now, is that what happened --

6

MR. GOLDBERG:

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

No --- in effect?

Or would --

8

did the judge say, "You may not introduce that

9

evidence, because it is not relevant"?

10

The

MR. GOLDBERG:

No, Justice -- the trial judge

11

ruled that we could offer the evidence, because we were

12

not before a jury, and the judge was the trier of fact.

13

And he stated so, that he would separate out, for

14

himself, what he could consider and what he could not.

15

And his verdict in this case, on the "guilty, except

16

insane," focused only on whether Eric knew right from

17

wrong.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

19

MR. GOLDBERG:

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

In this case.

In this case -Well, fine.

So, then, what

21

is -- would -- if he thought it was a wild animal, then

22

he would not have known right from wrong in respect to

quality of the act."

MR. GOLDBERG:

And your question is whether

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Why that isn't sufficient

16

to answer your contention that his intent is not -- has

17

not been subject to question.

18

MR. GOLDBERG:

Because, first of all, it is

19

not offered and is not considered to specifically

20

determine whether it rebuts an inference that the State

21

has raised on factual point key to their case.

22

Secondly, the nature and quality is not a consideration

23

in Arizona.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MR. GOLDBERG:

would -- can point this out by an example that gets to

what Justice Breyer was saying -- if a person is

squeezing a lemon -- and this is a common example in

law school -- and it turns out to be his sister -- he

5

knows, in the abstract, that a person -- killing a

7

does not know that squeezing a lemon is wrong.

He knows it's wrong.

But he

In this case, if Eric Clark's evidence showed
that he believed the police officer was an alien, and

10

there was substantial evidence in the record to that

11

effect -- and I would specifically point you to page 39

12

in the joint appendix, where the -- where the expert

13

testified that Eric had a heightened fear of police --

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I'll look at

15

M'Naghten.

16

action was right and wrong, whether -- rather than the

17

-- than the -- than the moral command was wrong.

18

I had thought it was whether or not the

MR. GOLDBERG:

That is correct.

That is

19

correct, Justice Kennedy.

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

Then, what do you do --

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Then what you're saying, if

22

I understand it, is that when the Arizona statute

23

refers to whether or not the criminal act was wrong,

24

the criminal act that they are referring to, on your

25

view, is the act of intentional killing, period.

And

12
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

1

if that's what they mean, then it is irrelevant that he

2

thought he was killing a Martian.

3

reference to the criminal act being wrong refers to the

4

act in this case -- i.e., killing somebody you believe

5

is a Martian -- then the evidence could come in.

6

think your argument means -- your argument rests on

7

the assumption that the Arizona statute's reference to

8

the criminal act being wrong means the criminal act, in

9

general, in the abstract -- i.e., intentional killing

But if the Arizona

So, I

10

- as distinct from the act of killing somebody you

11

believe to be a Martian.

Is that correct?

12

MR. GOLDBERG:

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

14

MR. GOLDBERG:

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

16

MR. GOLDBERG:

Absolutely.

That's not --

Okay.

-- that's not -All right, if that's --

-- the end of it, as well.

17

And the Model Penal Code makes this point when they

18

talk about their formulation, which is a -- whether a

19

defendant appreciates the wrongfulness of his conduct.

20

And they, in their discussions, had indicated -- and

21

these are on pages 166 and 169 of the ALI comments to

22

the Model Penal Code -- that M'Naghten could, under any

23

formulation -- a person could, in the abstract, know

24

that killing is wrong, but could also, in the -- in the

25

-- their subjective mental state, due to their mental

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

But the Arizona Court, the

3

Court of Appeals, writes that it turns on the finding

4

of criminal responsibility at the time of the criminal

5

offense.

6

who did not appreciate the nature and quality of the

7

act he committed would reasonably be able to perceive

8

that the act was wrong.

9

the Arizona Court, suggested to me that, in the case of

It is difficult to imagine that a defendant

Now, those words, written by

10

the lemon you're talking about, or in the case of the

11

individual who thinks that the truckdriver was a

12

Martian, they would say he does not know right from

13

wrong, here, now, in this case.

14

is what the Court of Appeals wrote.

15

MR. GOLDBERG:

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

That, it seemed to me,

That -And if that's what they

17

wrote, then they don't adopt the test you're attacking;

18

rather, they do let the very evidence that you want to

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

-- Breyer's explanation is

14

MR. GOLDBERG:

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

16

MR. GOLDBERG:

Yes.
And what is that argument?

The argument is that the State

17

proved, circumstantially, his mental state.

18

as the finder of fact, never -- and stated so in his

19

ruling on this issue -- could consider the lay

20

testimony and the expert testimony on whether it raised

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And your evidence to

That it was equally plausible

that he was driving around with his music playing loud

because he was drowning out the voices in his head,

11

which were --

12

This

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So, it went to

13

diminished mental capacity.

14

Arizona law, it has decided that that evidence can only

15

be presented in the context of an insanity defense.

a very subtle, but important, distinction between the

diminished-capacity defense as an affirmative defense

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, if you're going to let

the evidence of diminished capacity in, on mens rea,

6

you've done, by -- as it were, by the front door, what

7

you can't do by the back door -- i.e., by a diminished-

capacity defense -- because you're making the same

point.

10
11

The burdens of proof are different, but you're

making the same point.
MR. GOLDBERG:

Well, the burdens of proof

12

goes to whether, if we did not -- if we did not prevail

13

-- or we did prevail on the second issue, the --

14

whether M'Naghten allows consideration of this --

15

whether it makes a difference.

burden of proof is on us, by clear and convincing --

But it's clear,

14

Counsel, though, that the first prong of M'Naghten adds

15

something different, "You don't understand the nature

and quality of your acts."

17

enough, if you recognized both prongs, if he thought

this was a Martian, regardless of whether he knew it

was wrong to kill a Martian or not.

20

MR. HOWE:

In other words, it would be

23

As the -- as the Solicitor General's brief points out,

Does it matter

My point, Your Honor, is, if he is

not actually killing a space alien, there is grave

10

doubt that he would understand his conduct, and that

would make rather meaningless, at some practical level,

12

asking the question, "Did you know that your conduct

was wrong?"

What he -- what

if he doesn't actually understand that he is killing a

14

had a mission in life to kill Martians, that they're

If that was the -- what the trial court found, could

right to define "insanity" as it -- as it sees fit.

door, as you say, but, even coming in through the back

door, if it raises a reasonable doubt as to his intent

12

to kill a -- make a wrongful killing, why shouldn't it

13

be admissible?

14

MR. HOWE:

It should -- it isn't -- it isn't

15

admissible, Your -- a State can preclude it, Your

16

Honor, because the State has the definite right to

17

define the element of mens rea, and it is -- again, as

18

it sees fit.

And as --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Does that mean that it

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Howe, would you

4

explain to me how the State has proved intentional --

5

not intentional killing, but of a police officer?

6

that's the charge, that he intended to kill a police

7

officer, how does the State meet its burden on a police

8

officer if the testimony on the other side is, "I did

9

not understand that this human that I killed was a

10

If

police officer"?

11

MR. HOWE:

What the -- what the State proved

12

in this case, Your Honor, is that, at least, you know,

13

2 weeks prior to the murder, he indicated a desire to

14

do -- to do something extremely similar to what he --

15

you know, to what he actually did.

16

he had -- he had an extreme dislike toward police

17

officers.

18

Officer Moritz was in -- was in a marked police car, he

19

had a uniform, he turned on his lights and siren, and

20

Clark -- you know --

There was testimony

MR. HOWE:

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I see that on the --

24

State has introduced evidence from which a trier could

conclude he intended to kill a police officer.

I thought I

Yes --- to counter --

-- the State's proof, as I

understand what the Arizona law is.
MR. HOWE:

Sure.

What the Arizona Supreme

11

Court recognized in Mott was -- what the Arizona

12

Legislature did when it enacted its criminal code and

13

it defined its mens rea, it defined the mens rea in

14

such a way -- you know, just as you -- you know,

15

just as you explained in Egelhoff, Your Honor, that the

16

-- that the condition of mental disease or defect does

17

not negate the mens rea.

18

what the State has to prove, in general, and had to

19

prove in this specific case, is, the State had to prove

20

that Clark either, one, actually had the -- had the

21

intent to kill a police officer, at least knowing he

22

was a police officer, or killed under -- or killed

23

under circumstances that would indicate that he,

24

knowing -- at least knowingly killed a police officer,

25

but for his mental illness.

So, what the State has --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is this an alternative

2

argument, so that, if we accept this argument, we need

3

not ask whether the evidence comes in under prong two,

4

or is this complementary to the argument that the

5

evidence comes in under prong two?

6

MR. HOWE:

I -- I'm not quite sure how to

7

answer that, Your Honor.

8

the -- you know, as far as the first issue, is that a

9

State is free to define "insanity" as it -- as it sees

MR. HOWE:

Surely, Your Honor.

This Court

has always noted that evidence of mental disease or

psychiatrists and psychologists very often can't agree

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

on the meaning or the value or the validity of

psychiatric evidence.

3

interest in preventing someone, who has -- you know,

4

who -- there's at least a serious question of mental

5

illness, from being able to forgo an insanity defense,

6

but raise evidence to negate mens rea, in the hopes

7

that he would walk free instead of being found "guilty,

8

except insane," and sent to the State hospital.

9

There's also -- you know, a third policy reason, that,

The State also has an -- has an

because the gross question of whether someone is insane

12

or sane is a difficult enough question with psychiatric

evidence, it raises -- it raises the question to a

whole other level of complexity to ask the juries,

15

"Well, if we -- if you find that he is sane, but he has

make fine gradations of ability and responsibility.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

21

FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

22

IN SUPPORT OF RESPONDENT

23
24
25

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
Arizona has decided to adopt a particular

39
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

form of the insanity defense, and it has also decided

2

to protect that substantive decision by channeling

3

evidence about a defendant's mental capacity into an

4

affirmative defense with the burden squarely on the

5

defendant.

6

the Federal Constitution.

7

Neither aspect of that judgment violates

And I think, with respect to the substantive

8

decision, there are two elements to it.

9

Arizona wanted to streamline consideration of M'Naghten

First of all,

10

and focus on the heart of M'Naghten, which is the

11

right/wrong test.

12

as 1965, in the Schantz case, where they first came up

13

with the rule applied in Mott, they also wanted to not

14

have a diminished-capacity defense in the State of

15

Arizona.

16

But, equally important, as far back

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Could the State say that

17

it's the defendant's burden to show that it was not a

18

police officer?

19
20

GENERAL CLEMENT:
could the State do that?

I don't think the State --

Is that the question?

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Yes.

22

GENERAL CLEMENT:

I don't think the State --

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Because the next question

24
25

is, Why didn't they -- isn't that what happened here?
GENERAL CLEMENT:

Right.

I don't think they

40
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

could do that.

2

here.

3

case -- I mean, it came in, in sort of a strange way,

4

in part, I think, because it was a bench trial, but I

5

think what the trial court did is say that, "All of the

6

evidence on insanity, all of the evidence in the second

7

phase of the case, is relevant.

8

I'm going to take it into consideration, but I'm going

9

to take it into consideration only on the insanity

And I don't think that's what happened

And I think if you look at the evidence in this

It's all coming in.

10

defense, not as part of the mens rea defense."

11

think that was consistent with Arizona law.

12

think would be a harder question -- and let me just

13

say, I think the way that this was postured for the

14

trial court was that the Petitioner argued that all of

15

that evidence comes in for consideration of the mens

16

rea.

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And I

What I

It seems to me that you

18

introduced the -- my concern by saying that they -- the

19

State can put the burden of proof on the defendant,

20

which we know is generally true in many States with

21

reference to the insanity defense.

22

it with mens rea, then it seems to me you have a

23

problem.

24
25

GENERAL CLEMENT:

But when you link

Well, I don't think so,

Justice Kennedy, but you're absolutely right to say

41
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

that there's this tradition with insanity, which is

2

quite different than the tradition with respect to

3

other elements of a crime.

4

to the common law, and goes back to Blackstone.

5

you look at Blackstone, and you look at some of the

6

common law cases that this Court cited in its Davis

7

opinion, they describe murder as having several

8

elements.

9

and one is malice aforethought.

And I think that goes back
And if

One of them is obviously killing a person,
And then, some of the

10

cases treat a sound mind as a separate element.

11

think, if you look at the history, it's clear it wasn't

12

a true element, because the common law put the -- it

13

started with a presumption of sanity, which you

14

couldn't have with respect to any other element, and

15

said it was perfectly appropriate to put the burden on

16

the defendant.

17

But, I

And I think what the common law recognizes is

18

the question of criminal responsibility or insanity,

19

although it has some logical relationship to mens rea,

20

can be separated out and can be dealt with in an

21

affirmative defense.

22

recognize the State's ability to do that, you end up

23

allowing a defendant to basically sneak in, through, as

24

Justice Souter put it, the front door, all sorts of

25

watered-down insanity defenses in the guise of

And I think if you don't

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

1

arguments trying to negate mens rea.

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It does seem as if the

3

argument, that, "Oh, this all comes in under second --

4

under the second prong," means that if there's a --

5

there's another inference.

6

argument about lack of mens rea.

It's a -- it's a secondhand

7

GENERAL CLEMENT:

8

Justice Kennedy, though --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Kind of, the second-class --

Well --

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

-- sort of evidence.

12

GENERAL CLEMENT:

-- I don't think it's

Well, it -- I think,

13

second class.

14

Schantz case and in Mott, in making this rule in the

15

context of rejecting the diminished-capacity defense,

16

is that if you allow a defendant to argue, "My evidence

17

shows that I lack the capacity to form the requisite

18

mental state; and, therefore, that comes in on the mens

19

rea case," you can make that argument in terms of any

20

insanity defense you like.

21

the capacity to form the requisite intent, because I

22

responded to an irresistible impulse."

23

that's decided to have the M'Naghten insanity defense,

24

rather than the irresistible-impulse defense, has to be

25

able to make the judgment, I submit, that, "We're going

to have the M'Naghten defense, and we're going to keep

by any ordinary psychiatric test, would be viewed as

GENERAL CLEMENT:

I don't think it's in this

think you can hypothesize a situation where somebody

would be exonerated by one form of the insanity

defense, and not exonerated by a narrow form of the

insanity defense.

GENERAL CLEMENT:

With respect, Justice

Ginsburg, I think that starts to confuse the

hypotheticals with the real case, because I don't think

Petitioner's argument was that they had no idea that

12

this person was a police officer, and he thought he was

13

killing an alien.

14

one for insanity, and that maybe there were other

15

explanations for the conduct.

16

testimony here suggests that maybe he sometimes thought

17

that his mother was also an alien, but he kind of knew

18

it was his mother, as well.

19

think that maps up with the argument they've made.

I think their argument was much more

The one point I want to leave you with,

though, is, as Justice Souter said, everybody agrees

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID I. GOLDBERG

6

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

7

MR. GOLDBERG:

There is a due-process

8

guarantee that the defendant can present evidence in

9

his own defense.

No matter how the Chambers line of

10

cases is viewed by the court, this Court made clear,

11

in Montana v. Egelhoff, that in the absence of any

12

valid State justification -- and I'm quoting now, from

13

the plurality decision -- "exclusion of exculpatory

14

evidence deprives the defendant -- it's very basic to

15

have the prosecutor's case encounter and survive the

16

crucible of meaningful adversarial testing."

17

--

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And that

But that certainly

19

doesn't include the right to present any evidence you

20

want.

21

MR. GOLDBERG:

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It's the difference between -You couldn't have

23

presented evidence that this person was, in fact, a

24

Martian.

25

MR. GOLDBERG:

That's correct, Mr. Chief

Court to affirmatively rule that all of this evidence

3

comes in, just that all of it cannot be excluded, per

4

se, and that the trial judge is, just as in any other

type of evidence, any other fact or opinion evidence,

purpose, that this evidence is inherently unreliable.

And it's not that we're asking to -- this

But Arizona has decided, only for this

10

And then they've taken it to the point where they have

11

proven somebody guilty of murder in the first degree of

12

killing a police officer without allowing him to raise

13

a reasonable doubt as to whether he knew he was killing

14

a police officer.

15

contrary to what the Solicitor just stated, in my

16

motion for directed verdict that I made in this case.

17

And that specific argument was made,

JUSTICE ALITO:

Was it a reasonable question

18

whether he knew it was a police officer or whether he

knew it was a human being?

find him guilty of second-degree murder or

manslaughter.

the court refused to do that.

And I asked the court to do that, and

So, the --

consideration of this evidence.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, I -- the best I can

10

find in that Court of Appeals opinion, at the moment,

11

is that they do reject the idea of diminished

12

responsibility, on Mott -- on the ground of Mott.

13

That's true.

14

I didn't think diminished responsibility went to the

15

question of whether he had the requisite intent.

16

thought insanity went to that, as they use those words.

17

What is "diminished responsibility," if it isn't, "We

18

admit the intent -- we admit that he intended to kill

19

the individual, knew it was wrong, but he isn't as

20

responsible as an ordinary person would be"?

21

was raised earlier about whether a State could define

2

"murder" without a requisite mens rea, essentially,

3

which is -- or a specific intent, as the State seems to

4

suggest that Arizona has done, inferentially, under the

5

Mott decision.

6

versus United States, that, "No one" -- and I'm quoting

7

here -- "No one, we assume, would wish either the

courts or juries, when trying a case of murder, to

disregard the main principle existing at common law and
