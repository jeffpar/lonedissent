ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. PINCUS

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. PINCUS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
In its opinion in Jefferson Parish, the Court

12

stated that the key characteristic of illegal tying is

13

the seller's exploitation of its control over the tying

14

product to force the purchase of the tied product.

15

Court held that the per se rule against tying applies

16

only if the plaintiff proves that the seller has -- and

17

I'm quoting from that opinion.

18

of our brief -- the special ability, usually called

19

market power, to force the purchaser to do something

20

that he would not do in a competitive market.

21

The

The quote is on page 12

If the Court were confronted today for the

22

first time with the question whether the presence of a

23

patent on some aspect of the tying product by itself

24

demonstrates the existence of this forcing power, it's

25

inconceivable that the Court would adopt that rule.

1

Not only is there no empirical evidence to support it,

2

there's no logical basis for such a presumption.

3

The focus of patent rights is very different

4

from antitrust market analysis.

5

to a particular invention.

of different products, some patented, some not, to

8

satisfy his or her need.

one of those devices does not preclude at all the

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

13

patents and tying products.

14

that are patented in today's complicated world, and do

15

they -- do they -- do the component parts become part

16

of the tying product?

17

MR. PINCUS:

Let me ask you about
Are there component parts

I mean, how does that work?
Absolutely, Your Honor.

One of

18

the -- one of the evils of the presumption is that

19

there's nothing that says that the patent has to be on

20

the entire product.

21

component of a product.

22

Honor says, television sets, CD devices, cell phones,

23

all of those devices are loaded with components, one of

24

which may happen to be patented.

25

that makes the -- it may not have to do with anything

The -- the patent could be on a
And in today's world, as Your

It may not be the one

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

1

that makes that product attractive in the marketplace,

2

but the presence of that patent would be relied upon to

3

make the presumption applicable.

4

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, does the patent

5

somehow spread to cover the larger product?

6

don't see how it works.

7

MR. PINCUS:

I -- I

Well, I think -- I think the

8

theory of the application of the presumption is, first

9

of all, obviously, if the whole product is patented,

10

then the presumption would be applicable.

11

there also is an argument that even if some component

12

is -- is patented, that component, because it's in that

13

product, gives that product market power because the

14

theory would go the patent would exclude the ability of

15

other competitors in the market to use that component.

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But I think

Well, I suppose -- I

17

suppose we could say -- I just hadn't thought of it.

18

-- I suppose we -- we could say that it's not a

19

separate product.

20

market for the -- for the small micro-component in the

21

TV.

I

I mean, no -- no -- there's no

You're selling a TV.

22

MR. PINCUS:

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But then I think the argument -It's an -- a very

24

interesting question, but it seems to me that we could

25

handle that by just saying, well, there's not a

5
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1
2

separate product.
MR. PINCUS:

Well, you could, but I think the

3

question -- the question would be whether that product

4

as a whole in the marketplace, which is -- part of it

5

is made up by this component.

6

if I'm a competitor, I can't duplicate that product

7

because that component is patented, and therefore, that

8

product that contains the patented component should get

9

the benefit of this market power presumption.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

The argument would be,

It's not a --

Well, why would the person

12

want if he thought that?

13

want a patent if, in fact, he didn't think that it gave

14

him the power to raise price above what the price would

15

be in its absence?

16

MR. PINCUS:

I mean, why would a person

Well, Your Honor, at the -- at

17

the time that -- that the inventions are patented, it's

18

not clear -- many inventors don't know what the market

19

value of their product will be.

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now, you see, you're talking

21

about the wide -- you -- you say there are a lot of

22

failed patents.

23

it would, but he shouldn't have because it actually

24

made no difference.

25

The person got it because he thought

MR. PINCUS:

JUSTICE BREYER:

There might be.

I don't

know.

3

MR. PINCUS:

Our system encourages -- there

4

-- it -- it certainly is possible there are many

5

patents that -- that are -- there are many inventions

6

that are patented that don't have value in the

7

marketplace.

8

this --

9
10

There are some that do.

JUSTICE BREYER:

The problem with

Well, there might be.

There's a set of valueless patents.

11

MR. PINCUS:

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, but the fact -And in respect to there

13

being a valueless patent, the owner would not be able

14

to raise the price over what it otherwise would be.

15

And why not then make that a defense, that a person

16

could say, I have a valueless patent, and he could

17

introduce evidence to prove it?

18

MR. PINCUS:

Well, Your Honor, I -- I think

19

there are -- there are two answers to that question.

20

First of all, there's no empirical showing and -- and

21

no logical evidence that there -- the set of valuable

22

patents is larger than the set of valueless ones.

23

in fact, it's probably the evidence is to the contrary,

24

that the set of valueless patents is quite

25

considerable.

And,

So by creating a presumption and

7
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

shifting the burden based on something that's

2

demonstrably not true doesn't have a logical basis.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

As I understand the

4

respondent's position, it's not the component.

5

not arguing that.

6

case that isn't presented here.

7

They're

So you're answering a hypothetical

And also, respondent says that we are talking

8

only about patents where there is a successful tie.

9

leave out all those cases where I have a patent and

10

it's never produced a penny, and somehow I can make

11

mileage out of that.

12

MR. PINCUS:

Yes, Your Honor.

So

I -- I think

13

respondent has moved away from -- from the Loew's

14

assertion that the mere existence of a patent shows

15

uniqueness sufficient to -- to satisfy the market power

16

test.

17

that they propose is that if the -- if the patent ties

18

successful in the marketplace that shows market power.

19

But that's inconsistent with this Court's recognition

20

in -- in a number of cases that ties can be successful

21

in the marketplace not because they're backed by market

22

power, but because they are attractive to consumers in

23

a competitive market.

And -- and one of the next level presumptions

24

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, let's go to --

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Pincus, you -- you had a

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

second point you were going -- in response to Justice

2

Breyer's question.

3

What was your second point?

MR. PINCUS:

Well, my second point, in

4

response to Justice Breyer, if I can recall it, was

5

that in the component situation, which was one of the

6

situations that we were talking about, that the problem

7

with the component test, the presumptions are supposed

8

to be easy to apply.

9

device has to be patented, then the next case is going

And if you say, well, the entire

10

to be a case where 85 percent of the key ingredients

11

are patented, 15 percent aren't, and the question will

12

be, does the presumption apply?

13

setting up a presumption which is designed to -- for

14

ease of application that will become extremely

15

difficult to apply.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So you're -- you're

Isn't the refutation of the

17

presumption really the same thing as a demonstration of

18

market power?

19

MR. PINCUS:

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes.

The -- the --

And -- and we usually leave

21

the demonstration of market power to the -- to the

22

plaintiff in the case.

23

MR. PINCUS:

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

Absolutely, Your Honor, and -So it -- it'd be rather

strange to -- to have in this one category of cases the

9
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

market power has to be -- or lack of market power has

2

to be demonstrated by the defendant.

3
4

MR. PINCUS:

It would be extremely strange

especially because there's the lack --

5

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Do you think there's a

6

distinction -- do you think there's a distinction

7

between components in cases where there's a one-on-one

8

relationship between the tied product and the tying

9

product and cases like this which involve metering?

Do

10

you think there's a different possible approach between

11

the two?

12
13

MR. PINCUS:

No, Your Honor, we don't because

the -- the economic literature --

14

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But your earlier point was

15

we know that a whole lot of patents are not all that

16

important.

17

patent can generate metering in this particular kind of

18

situation, that it -- that it's a likelihood that it

19

has more power than the average patent?

20

But is it not fair to assume that when a

MR. PINCUS:

No.

I -- I think, A, it's not

21

reasonable to assume that, Your Honor, and it's

22

certainly not reasonable to assume it has the level of

23

market power that Jefferson Parish required, which was

24

significant market power.

25

30 percent share of the relevant market was not enough.

The Court there held that a

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

3

So we're talking, in the tying context, of a very
considerable market power test.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

But if it's -- if it is

4

true, as your opponent says -- and I don't know if it

5

is or not -- that you're able to get twice the price

6

for the ink than you otherwise would get, does that --

7

is that any evidence of market power?

8
9
10
11
12

MR. PINCUS:
is not -- not true.

Well, first of all, that -- that

The record reflects that the --

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, if it were what the

record reflected.
MR. PINCUS:

Well, if it were what the record

13

reflected and there was a relevant market that was --

14

that was restricted to this ink, yes.

15

think that the existence of a patent, even in the

16

requirements context, fulfills that test for the reason

17

that the economic literature is quite clear that price

18

discrimination, which is what their theory -- their --

19

their theory is metering should be sufficient to give

20

rise to a presumption because price discrimination

21

supposedly signals market power.

22

our reply brief, there is a tremendous amount of

23

economic literature that says that is in fact not true,

24

that price discrimination occurs in very competitive

25

markets from airlines to restaurants to coupons.

But we don't

But as we discuss in

11
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But isn't it also true that

2

some -- some economists disagree?

3

wondering if there's disagreement among economists,

4

should we take one view over the other?

5

MR. PINCUS:

And I'm just

Well, I think the problem, Your

6

Honor, is that the presumption does take one view over

7

another based on -- based on something that was adopted

8

at the time there was no analysis.

9

says we're going to presume market power, and as

The presumption

10

Justice Scalia said, we're going to put the entire

11

burden of refuting market power, in this one context,

12

separate from all of antitrust analysis, on the

13

defendant.

14

We're not going to do it in exclusive -- vertical

15

exclusive dealing arrangements where the product is a

16

tie.

17

exactly the same, there's never been a assumption that

18

there should be a market power presumption when the

19

product that's the subject of the exclusive dealing

20

arrangement is patented.

21

There's never been an assertion that that's true.

22

And we're only going to do it in tying.

In that situation, which theoretically should be

Territorial arrangements.

This -- this is a relic really of the fact

23

that when the Court decided these patent tying cases,

24

there was a hostility to the expansion of -- of

25

intellectual property rights beyond the scope of the

12
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

patent.

2

doctrine, and then it was carried over to antitrust

3

doctrine without any analysis about whether the

4

assertion that the patent was unique, and therefore

5

there were anticompetitive effects, had anything to do

6

with the level of anticompetitive effect that the

7

Court required to show an illegal tie.

8
9

That first was reflected in patent misuse

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Mr. Pincus, let me go -- ask

you to follow up on that and, in effect, go back to --

10

to Justice Ginsburg's question.

11

patents as such do not give market power.

12

assume that there are many successful ties in which

13

that is also not true.

14

I will assume that
I will

What is -- is your kind of short answer to

15

the -- to the argument, which I think Justice Ginsburg

16

was getting to, that if it is, in fact, worth

17

litigating in an antitrust case, that is a pretty good

18

-- darned good reason to assume that there is market

19

power and that it is, of course, having a

20

discriminatory price effect?

21

to that?

22

MR. PINCUS:

What's the short answer

I think the short answer to

23

that, Your Honor, is that there are a lot of antitrust

24

cases that are filed that aren't successful, and

25

there's no reason to believe that just because a

13
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

plaintiff files a case, that it is going to be

2

successful.

3

filing of the case meets an element is -- is a bit of

4

an attractive nuisance.

And, in fact, establishing a rule that the

5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

6

MR. PINCUS:

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I was going to say I --

It's going to attract claims --- I would have thought the

8

answer was you could say that in any case in which an

9

antitrust case is -- is brought.

10

So essentially it --

it gets to be reductionist.

11

MR. PINCUS:

Well, and I think it's an

12

attractive nuisance.

13

satisfy the rule by filing a lawsuit, I'm certainly

14

encouraged to file a lawsuit regardless of whether

15

there's underlying really market power or not because I

16

-- no one will ever -- I won't have to worry about it.

17

If that's the rule, if I can

The burden will be shifted to my opponent.

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In other words, the fact -Do you think the

20

existence of the laws of -- of -- the existence of the

21

lawsuit -- of -- of the presumption is what drives a

22

lawsuit?

23

MR. PINCUS:

24

JUSTICE SOUTER:

25

Yes, exactly, Your Honor.
Well, does it drive the -- I

mean, it -- it drives the lawsuit with respect to one

14
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

element.

2

if we reaffirm the rule that you're challenging, it

3

will invite more lawsuits.

4

Supreme Court really means it with this presumption

5

now.

6

And -- and I -- I guess one argument is if --

They'll say, boy, the

Has that, in fact, been the case that the

7

presumption, at least as it has been understood up to

8

this point, has driven lawsuits and, in fact, has

9

driven lawsuits that ultimately were unsuccessful even

10

though the market power point was, of course,

11

satisfied?

12

MR. PINCUS:

Well, there certainly have been

13

lawsuits that are unsuccessful, but -- but, Your Honor,

14

one of the problems with our litigation system is many

15

cases are not tried to completion on the merits,

16

especially expensive antitrust cases.

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So if a case --

Yes, but this is -- this is

18

basically a practical question, and I -- I'm trying to

19

get a -- I guess because I'm not an antitrust lawyer,

20

I'm trying to get a handle on how the presumption is

21

actually working in the system, and I'm not sure that I

22

understand it.

23

MR. PINCUS:

Well, right now I would say the

24

presumption status is somewhat murky.

25

the Antitrust Division in the FTC came out with their

When the -- when

2

recognition of a presumption and the Sixth Circuit also

3

rejected the existence of the presumption, there was a

certainly amongst the district courts.

had the Federal regulators saying this presumption

doesn't make sense.

8

extent -- not completely, but to some extent -- what

9

would otherwise have been -- what would have happened

10

in the lower courts if there had been a full-throated

11

affirmance of the presumption.

And also, you

That, I think, chilled to a large

12

And I think the issue now is prognosticating

13

a bit what will happen if the Court were to affirm the

14

presumption.

15

a presumption that says if you file a lawsuit alleging

16

tying of a product that has a patent or is patented,

17

then the filing of the lawsuit plus the patent means

18

that the burden of market power has shifted, then if

19

I'm a competitor trying to put some cost on my

20

competitor in a market, that's a pretty low-cost thing

21

to do because all I do is file the lawsuit.

22

benefit of presumption.

23

to disprove market power.

And I think it is a fair assumption that

I get the

They've got to spend the money

24

And the market power element is peculiarly

25

important in the tying context because we're dealing

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

here with a per se rule, although a somewhat peculiar

per se rule because it has these four prerequisites.

But the market power one is the critical one and

certainly one that the Court identified --

JUSTICE BREYER:
that's the critical one.

point.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. HUNGAR

19

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

20

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

21
22
23

MR. HUNGAR:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
The presumption that patents confer market

24

power is counterfactual, inconsistent with this

25

Court's modern antitrust jurisprudence, out of step

20
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

1

with congressional action in the patent area, contrary

2

to the views of leading antitrust commentators and the

3

Federal antitrust enforcement agencies, and

4

unnecessarily harmful to intellectual property rights

5

and procompetitive conduct.

6

presumption should be rejected.

7

For all those reasons, the

There's no plausible economic basis for

8

inferring market power from the mere fact that a

9

defendant has a patent on a tying product.

As this

10

Court has recognized, many commercially viable products

11

are the subject of patents that do not confer market

12

power because there are reasonable substitutes.

13

does the combination of a tie in a patent provide a

14

valid basis for presuming market power.

15

be entirely incidental and tying is ubiquitous in fully

16

competitive markets.

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

MR. HUNGAR:

And do we have to decide that

Strictly speaking, it's not,

Your Honor, because of course, this is a patent case.

23

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

24

MR. HUNGAR:

25

Right.

And the only case in which this

Court has actually applied a presumption of economic

21
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

power is the Loew's case, which was a copyright case.

2

In fairness, however, Loew's based the presumption that

3

it recognized in the copyright context entirely on the

4

reasoning of the patent misuse cases.

5

holding that there is no presumption in the patent

6

context would eviscerate the underlying rationale for

7

Loew's.

8
9

So a -- a

Indeed, as we explain in our brief, Congress
in our view has already done that because, again,

10

Loew's expressly states that the rationale for the

11

presumption it adopts is that in the patent misuse

12

cases, the Court has -- at that time, had rejected any

13

attempt to extend the monopoly.

14

in the Patent Misuse Reform Act, overruled those cases

15

and held that there cannot be patent misuse in the

16

absence of an actual showing, based on all the

17

circumstances, of market power.

18

underpinnings of Loew's have been entirely repudiated,

19

which is one of the reasons why we think that this

20

Court ought to make it clear that there is no

21

presumption of market power in a tying case where

22

there --

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

But Congress, in 1988

you're defining.

was just a mistake.

11

MR. HUNGAR:

No, Your Honor.

Certainly many

patents are valueless, which is one of the reasons why

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

that, the existence of valueless patents?

16

But then are you relying on

MR. HUNGAR:

Well, that's -- that's part but

not all.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

19

which patents are you talking about?

20

MR. HUNGAR:

If you're going beyond that,

Patents can be valuable, but not

21

confer meaningful, significant market power.

22

Court said in Jefferson Parish is significant market

23

power.

24

which a competitor has the ability for some customers

25

in some circumstances to raise price to some extent,

What this

I mean, there can be lots of circumstances in

23
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

but we wouldn't consider that significant market power.

2

And patents can confer value in other ways.

3

For instance, in many high-tech industries in the

4

modern high-tech environment, a patent library is

5

necessary merely in order to get cross licenses from

6

your competitors that would allow each of you to

7

compete.

8

without a patent library, you can't get in the door.

9

And all the competitors have their patent libraries and

They're fully competitive markets, but

10

they agree to cross licenses to avoid the -- the

11

inconvenience and cost of patent infringement.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

13

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

No, I see.
Mr. Hungar, one of the

14

amicus briefs for the respondent was submitted by a

15

professor, I think, named Barry Nalebuff --

16

MR. HUNGAR:

17

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Yes, Your Honor.
-- which took the view

18

that the Court should, in any event, retain the

19

presumption where a patent is being used to impose a

20

variable or a requirements tie.

21

comment on that view?

22

MR. HUNGAR:

23

Do you have any

Yes, Your Honor.

We think

that's wrong for several reasons.

24

In the first place, the presumption

25

recognized in Loew's, of course, has nothing to do with

24
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

a requirements tie.

2

urging the Court to do is not to retain the Loew's

3

presumption but, rather, to create a new one.

4

there is certainly not the requisite evidentiary basis

5

or consensus among --

6

So, in effect, what that brief is

JUSTICE STEVENS:

7

one.

8

all those cases.

And

Well, it wouldn't be a new

It would be just following the old IBM case and

9

MR. HUNGAR:

Well, Your Honor, those -- those

10

cases don't state a presumption of market power.

11

Market power wasn't even relevant in those days.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

13

they're saying it would be following.

14

15

MR. HUNGAR:

No, but that's the example
It's not a brand

Well, it is a brand new idea in

16

the sense that they would -- they would ask the Court

17

to adopt a presumption of market power, which the Court

18

did not recognize in the IBM case or any of those cases

19

because market power was not a part of the analysis in

20

those cases.

21

in the -- even in the International Salt case where the

22

Court -- where the Court later made clear that the --

the ability to prove the absence of market power was

deemed irrelevant by the Court in International Salt.

recognized -JUSTICE STEVENS:

But your -- your answer to

3

Justice O'Connor is there should be no distinction even

4

if there is evidence that there's a long-term

5

relationship, a requirements relationship, and an

6

increase in price.

7

MR. HUNGAR:

Well, an increase in price is a

8

separate issue which might or might not, depending on

9

the circumstances, be probative of market power in the

10

-- in the tied product market or, again, depending on

11

the circumstances, it might be probative of market

12

power in the tying market and certainly a plaintiff

13

would be able to rely on such evidence if they could

14

establish it.

15

But the -- the fact of a requirements tie,

16

standing alone together with a patent, is not

17

meaningfully probative of market power.

18

thesis is that requirements tie is always used for

19

metering, and metering is evidence of price

20

discrimination, and price discrimination is evidence of

21

market power.

22

disagreement and, indeed, the majority view is that

price discrimination is not necessarily or even usually

24

evidence of market power.

25

discrimination is common in entirely competitive

MR. HUNGAR:

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

a broader approach to get rid of the tying issue

MR. HUNGAR:

address in this case.

That is, is it -- is it rational to

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And -- and what is

the Government's position on the latter question?
MR. HUNGAR:

Well, Justice O'Connor made

10

persuasive points in her concurring opinion in

11

Jefferson Parish in which she explained why, in the

12

view of those Justices, that the per se rule does not

13

make a whole lot of economic sense.

14

a position on that question in this case because, in

15

our view, it's not necessary to reach that in order to

16

reverse the judgment below which -- which rests

17

entirely on the presumption.

18

We have not taken

The Loew's presumption is also, in our view,

19

undermined by this Court's modern antitrust cases, such

20

as Jefferson Parish and Eastman Kodak, because the

21

presumption -- the fact that the Loew's presumption

22

recognizes is not market power in the modern sense of

23

the term, as it is understood and required under

24

Eastman Kodak and Jefferson Parish.

25

Loew's Court said is that uniqueness suffices to

said on page 45 of the decision that -- that ability to

5

fact that -- that is being presumed in Loew's than the

6

fact that is now required as part of the Court's modern

7

per se tying jurisprudence, which is actual,

8

significant market power.

9

The Court specifically

That's a different

So even if the Loew's presumption had any

10

continuing force, which we don't think it does, it

11

doesn't presume the relevant fact under this Court's

12

modern cases.

13

of the court of appeals is incorrect.

14

So for that reason as well, the judgment

As has been discussed, we think that the

15

presumption is not only wrong but has deleterious

16

consequences.

17

on the ownership of intellectual property and -- and --

18

It essentially imposes a litigation tax

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But isn't that also true

19

even if there's monopoly power?

20

really think it's a very interesting question as to

21

whether it makes any difference whether the monopolist

22

who happened to have a patent just charges high prices

23

for product A or decides to charge a little less for

24

product A and make hay out of product B.

25

MR. HUNGAR:

That's what -- I

-- we're going down a new road in this whole area.

7

just wondering how -- what our destination is.

MR. HUNGAR:

I'm

Well, I think, as I said, those

are completely separate and -- and really, I would say,

10

unrelated points because what we're talking about here

11

is not whether -- whether market power is relevant, but

12

rather, whether the plaintiff should be required to

13

prove an element of its case, which is the normal rule

14

that this Court and the lower courts apply in -- in the

15

whole array of contexts, including in antitrust cases

16

in every other context.

17

JUSTICE STEVENS:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KATHLEEN M. SULLIVAN

3

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

4
5

MS. SULLIVAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

6

Petitioners and the Government have fallen

7

far short of the -- meeting the burden that would be

8

required to overrule a presumption that has been in

9

force for nearly 60 years since the International Salt

10

decision, a presumption that, as Justice Stevens

11

acknowledged, reflected the Court's prior experience

12

dating back to the enactment of the Clayton Act in 1914

13

with the use of patents to enforce requirements ties

14

like the one at issue here, buy our printhead and you

15

have to buy our ink at whatever price we set for the

16

life of the product, even after the patent has expired.

17

It was precisely the Court's experience with

18

a series of patent cases in which such requirements

19

ties had been imposed that led it to set forth the

20

presumption in International Salt.

21

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

justification, in terms of sharing risk with a new

product, that would be one of the cases where you would

expect to find a tie.

very persuaded by the effort to draw a wedge between

16

requirements and other things.

And -- and so I'm not really

But what I do find very difficult about this

case is -- you can see from what I'm saying -- that at

justified.

Here.

Go

We don't know how much of that there is.
MS. SULLIVAN:

Well, in this case that isn't

16

so because the petitioner initiated the litigation.

17

Let us remember that this case began as a patent

18

infringement action in which Trident came after

19

Independent Ink for patent infringement claims, which

20

were dismissed with prejudice by the district court,

21

found to be unsustainable.

22

But, Mr. Chief Justice, just to go back to

23

the direct evidence point, you asked before isn't

24

market power doing all the heavy lifting.

25

can be shown through expert evidence, and that's what

Market power

the district court erroneously said that we had failed

2

to provide.

3

But it can also be shown, as this Court has

4

acknowledged in Kodak, as -- and in FTC v. Indiana

5

Dentists, market power can be shown directly.

6

there's direct evidence of anticompetitive effects in

7

the tied product market -- here, three times the price

one wants to pay for ink in order to use the patented

9

printhead for 20 years and thereafter -- if there's

If

10

evidence directly of anticompetitive effect in the

11

tying -- in the tied product market, then there's no

12

need for that expert evidence.

13

This happens to be the rare case in which the

14

petitioner was cooperative enough to have taken

15

customer surveys showing the -- the dissatisfaction its

16

customers had over a long period of years with having

17

to pay supracompetitive prices for ink.

be the general case.

19

But that won't

And in other cases, the patent rule is a

20

sensible rule of thumb -- the patent presumption, not a

21

rule, is a sensible rule of thumb for capturing the

22

wisdom that patents used to enforce requirements ties

23

are more likely than not to show market power.

24

what they're intended to do through barriers to entry,

Are you conceding

that the presumption makes no sense outside of the

rule should continue to be, as it has always been, that

when a patent is used to enforce a tie for a

enforce a tie, that's presumptive evidence of market

does the presumption make any sense at all outside of

JUSTICE BREYER:

Let me try this again, and

I'm thinking of a way of saying this more clearly.

9

This is my actual dilemma.

10

If I decide this case against you in my view

11

-- and suppose it came out that way -- I would be

12

concerned lest there be a lot of big companies in the

13

technology area that have real market power in tying

14

products and get people -- and they extend that power

15

through a tie into a second market and thereby insulate

16

themselves from attack.

17

really happening, and everything gets mixed up in a war

18

of experts in a technology area about do we have the

19

power, don't we have the power, and who knows.

20

I would be afraid of that

If I decide this case in your favor, I would

21

then be afraid that particularly in the patent area,

22

there will be lots of instances where new technology,

23

uncertain technology, uncertain new technology, does

24

not get off the ground because a very easy way to

25

finance the risk through a requirements contract, for

example, so that we make the money if the product

2

succeeds, because people buy the required product at a

3

higher price.

4

an area where new technology is particularly at risk.

That will never happen.

not certain what to do.

We're not even sure, are we,

Ms. Sullivan, that -- that you can extend, assuming

that there is market power in the patent -- we're not

really sure that you can extend it through tying.

even on that question.

11

MS. SULLIVAN:

Justice Scalia, the -- the

12

economic theories that focus on the relevant pool,

13

which is patents that have sufficiently high value to

14

be used to enforce a tie, is unanimously on our side

15

that there's no procompetitive value, that there are

16

anticompetitive effects.

JUSTICE BREYER:

It -And so I think most

13

economists -- in fact, everyone I've ever read agrees

14

with that.

15

MS. SULLIVAN:

Most -- the majority view is

16

that price discrimination does reflect market power,

17

that you can't discriminate without it, and that's

18

reflected in Judge Posner's recent decisions, for

19

example.

20

So if they're -- if they're using metering

21

here to price discriminate, all the more reason for you

22

to uphold the presumption here because the metering is

23

being used to price discriminate the very thing that

24

shows there's market power.

25

But if -- to go back to Justice Stevens'

point about whether metering can ever be a good way for

2

the monopolist to take his profit on the ink, rather

3

than on the printhead, there's very good reason to

4

think it's bad, inefficient, and certainly bad for

5

consumers for the monopolist to take his profit on the

6

ink rather than on the printhead because the consumer

7

can't make, as this Court pointed out in Eastman Kodak,

8

a good judgment at the beginning of how much ink he's

9

going to need for the life of the product and what it's

going to cost.

And in this case, petitioners did everything

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Of course, one of the

2

interesting aspects of this kind of discrimination is

3

the victim of the discrimination is the more powerful

4

buyer in these cases.

5

MS. SULLIVAN:

Well, we would argue that the

6

presumption makes sense no matter whether the patentee

7

is a big or a small company, and the reason is, to go

8

back to Justice Scalia's question, that the -- the

patentee will always have better information about the

12

13

For Independent Ink to try to show that there are no

14

reasonable substitutes for the printhead is a very

15

arduous burden to place on Independent Ink, whereas

16

it's a very sensible burden to place on the defendant

17

to say, show us that there are reasonable,

18

noninfringing substitutes for your printhead.

But, Justice Ginsburg, to return to your

2

point, if there's any doubt about whether metering can

3

ever be efficient, if there's any doubt about whether

4

there could be a procompetitive reason for a

5

requirements tie, evidence that has utterly been failed

6

to be presented here, where there's no economist brief

7

on their side and several economist briefs on our side

8

by very distinguished economists cited by the other

9

side, if there is any doubt about that kind of economic

10

wisdom, then indeed it should be decided by Congress.

11

It's a matter of economic policy to be decided by

12

Congress.

13

antitrust laws in 1988, when it looked at a bill that

14

the Senate had written and the House rejected it, it's

15

failed five times since then to reject this

presumption.

So there's nothing murky about the

17

presumption.

It's still the law.

18

Congress has not only failed to reform the

If petitioners really believe they can come

19

forward with an economic record they haven't come forward

20

with so far, Congress is open and able to correct it.

21

But when this Court has guided plaintiffs and defendants

22

for 60 years with a presumption that still makes good

23

economic sense -- and Justice Stevens, if there were

24

anything to the metering argument, why wouldn't Trident

an argument that the district court found to have been
