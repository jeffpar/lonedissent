CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES R. RADMORE

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

MR. RADMORE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

The Federal Tort Claims Act's postal-matter

11

exception bars any claim arising out of the failure of the

12

Postal Service to fulfill its duty to deliver mail to its

13

intended destination on time and in good condition, but

14

does not bar any claim arising out of ordinary negligence

15

that happens to occur while the tortfeasor is delivering

16

mail.

17

The Petitioner's construction shields the

18

Government from all claims arising out of loss or damage

19

or delay or destruction of the mail, while allowing claims

20

that do not stem from all -- do not stem from the

21

violation of the unique duty of the Postal Service to make

22

sure that the mail arrives on time and in good condition.

23

It is the construction most faithful with the text and

24

purpose of the Federal Tort Claims Act.

25

bars any claims, whether for personal injury or property

damage, that arise while the mail is -- if the mail is

2

lost, misdelivered, damaged, or delayed.

3

The Government argues for a much broader

4

construction that would bar all claims that arise from the

5

handling of mail.

6

on a definition of transmission of the mail, viewed in

7

isolation from the rest --

9

The Government's construction depends

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Mr. Radmore, what was the

purpose of the enactment of the waiver of Federal

10

sovereign immunity here?

Was it to allow recovery for

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, the -Was that basically the

purpose?
MR. RADMORE:

Justice O'Connor, this Court's

16

decision in Kosak tells us that one of the main purposes

17

in enacting the Federal Tort Claims Act was to allow

18

private persons to be able to make claims against the

19

Postal Service from motor vehicle --

the exception broadly?

8

MR. RADMORE:

9

Well, once you -I thought we did.

But once there's a broad waiver -For auto accidents.

Well -Now, why should we interpret

Well, the exception -- this Court

has told us, in both Smith and Kosak, that it is the --

10

the lower courts and this Court, when they're viewing an

11

exception to the Federal Tort Claims Act -- that they

12

shouldn't extend the waiver, nor should they view it more

13

narrowly, that they should look at the waiver -- they

14

should look at the exception and make a determination as

15

to what the meaning of the words are, and what the reason

16

for the exception was, and they should do no more, nor no

17

less, than that.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, I guess we've already

19

construed it broadly, haven't we, in -- or, excuse me --

20

yes, construed the waiver broadly.

21

States, we allowed a suit against the United States for

22

negligence of a mail truck in an automobile accident.

suppose the language could have covered that, couldn't it?

But an automobile accident is

the words are "negligent transmission."

"negligent transmission."

24
25

But the transmission of the letter is -Many people think

That act surely fits the word

MR. RADMORE:

Justice Ginsburg, in isolation, we

admit that the word "transmission" could have the broad

6
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

interpretation that the Government as -- is urging this

2

Court to follow.

3

"negligent transmission" in the context of the whole

4

exception.

5

given the broad interpretation that the Government urges

6

and the Third Circuit found, then the words "loss" and

7

"miscarriage" in the exception would be superfluous.

8

we also know that this Court, on prior occasions, has

9

indicated that the canon that "words are known by their

But you have to look at the term

10

11

Tort Claims Act.

12

you have words that are in a group, they should be given

13

like meaning.

14

only mail can be delivered to the wrong location.

15

a result, it's pretty clear that the term "negligent

16

transmission" deals with the mail, itself.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And in -- that canon tells us that when

And we know that only mail can be lost,
And, as

as well.

MR. RADMORE:

7
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

covered by negligent transmission?

2

the postal worker throws the package to the house and

3

there's something in it that gets broken, that's covered

4

by the exception?

5

MR. RADMORE:

I take it if the -- if

Any damage to the mail, itself,

6

would be covered to the exception -- by the exception.

7

For instance, if a -- if somebody had ordered their

8

medication over the -- you know, through the Medicare Act,

9

and they had ordered it from a warehouse somewhere in

10

Idaho, and the -- during the transmission of the mail, the

11

medication had been lost, well, if somebody was injured,

12

if they had a stroke or they had a heart attack because

13

they didn't get their mail on time --

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Right.

But if -- now,

15

if they throw the package onto the porch, and it lands in

16

a place where somebody's going to trip over it, you say

17

that's not covered by the exception.

18

MR. RADMORE:

That's not covered, because that's

19

an act of ordinary negligence.

20

would always be covered, but the act of creating a

21

hazardous condition would not be covered, because that's

22

an ordinary tort that would be -- subject private persons

23

to a liability between themselves.

24

purpose of the Federal Tort Claims Act is to allow the

25

Government to be held responsible for ordinary torts if

MR. RADMORE:

JUSTICE STEVENS:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- to the -It could cover, under your

13

theory, this very act, just dumping the stuff there on the

1

any damage to the actual contents of the package, itself.

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So, in -- it seems to me a

3

little strange that this same act is both within the

4

exception and not within the exception, the same act of

5

negligence.

6

MR. RADMORE:

Well, it's not really the same

7

act.

8

there was a consequence to the mail, but the creation of a

9

hazard or -- through some kind of careless act, whether it

It's the same act, in that they used the mail, and

10

be the postal employee or whether it be a person that

11

would raise 2680(c) from the customs exception, whether --

12

or an IRS agent or a private person --

13

JUSTICE STEVENS:

14

MR. RADMORE:

15
16

But it --

-- would all be responsible for

creating a hazardous condition on the porch.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

But isn't your response to

17

Justice Scalia -- you could make the same argument.

18

there's an accident, and the truck caught on fire, and the

19

mail was destroyed, you couldn't recover for the lost mail

20

in the truck, but you could -- but you could recover for

21

personal injury resulting from the accident.

22

precisely the same conduct.

MR. RADMORE:

MR. RADMORE:

Well, the -- "loss" doesn't cover

mail that would be delayed or damaged.

7
8

What does "negligent

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But I supposed

"miscarriage" does.

9

MR. RADMORE:

"Miscarriage" would be mail that

10

went to the wrong location.

11

that's what "miscarriage" would mean in this context.

12

If it was misdelivered,

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Or mis-carried, like

13

handled in a way that it's damaged, or put in a place

14

where it's going to be damaged.

15

I'm not sure what additional weight "negligent

16

transmission" covers if you have a reasonable reading of

17

"miscarriage."

18

MR. RADMORE:

It seems to me that --

Well, you could look at every term

19

in the exception, and, if you gave it the broadest

20

definition possible, you could say that all of the words

21

are superfluous, that "loss" would cover mail that was,

22

you know, lost and not delivered to the postal patron

23

within two weeks, and, for that period of time, the mail

24

was lost.

25

But if you look at the exception in -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, that doesn't work.

11
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

I mean, if you deliver it to the house next door, you

2

haven't lost it, you've misdelivered it or miscarried it.

3

I don't -- I don't think "miscarriage" is redundant.

4

you -- your construction of "negligent transmission" is so

5

narrow that I'm not sure it adds anything to

6

"miscarriage," which suggests it might --

7

MR. RADMORE:

But

Well, "miscarriage" doesn't mean

8

that the mail was damaged.

9

-- if the mail is delivered, Mr. Justice Roberts, to your

"Miscarriage," if I take the

10

next-door neighbor, it doesn't mean the mail is -- maybe

11

miscarriaged, but it's not delayed, and it's not damaged.

12
13

So -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What about "delay"?

14

Does "delay" -- your -- isn't that something that's

15

neither within "loss" or "miscarriage"?

16

MR. RADMORE:

17

either term.

18

mail that's lost.

No, "delayed" wouldn't be within

"Lost," I think, means exactly what it says,
"Lost" means lost.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Right.

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

So, if, in fact, they -- the

21

Post Office negligently delays the knowledge that would

22

come to me in the letter, that I have 15 days to claim my

23

billion-dollar inheritance --

24

[Laughter.]

25

MR. RADMORE:

3

they do is -- this is -- it seems to me this case is like

4

a first-year law school hypothetical.

5

suppose that the -- what they do is, he puts the mail on

6

the porch, my package, and he rips it open, negligently;

7

and there for everyone to see is the toupee that I

I have that same problem.

It -I mean, what I -- to sort of my

cards on the -- I was thinking, "Well, that comes close,"

18

but maybe it -- maybe it is within the -- within the --

19

within the exception.

I'm not sure.

And then --

have the automobile accident.

7

bops someone on the head with it.

8

MR. RADMORE:

I guess that's covered.

Well, obviously, a line has to be

drawn somewhere.

11
12

And I guess he comes along

And then, this case is somewhere in the middle.

9
10

But I'm just trying

JUSTICE BREYER:

But what's the principle

according to which we're drawing it?

13

MR. RADMORE:

Well, I think anything -- any

14

claim that would arise from the unique governmental duty

15

to deliver the mail on time and in good condition would be

16

barred.

Any --

moreover, somebody could, in fact, delay the transmission

See?

Somebody could go up to the

10

things could be ordinary torts.

11

MR. RADMORE:

And,

So, all those

But they don't have a duty.

The

12

difference is, in that case, if a -- if a private person

13

were to go and open up the package, or if a private person

14

were to take your letter that showed that you had an

15

inheritance, a private person doesn't have the duty.

16

the Government has a duty to deliver the mail on time and

17

in good condition.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

guess, ripping it open is, in fact, not in good condition,

position where somebody would trip over it, you might say

23

they didn't deliver it in good condition, because what

they're supposed to do is place it somewhere where you

Therefore, when they put it -- therefore, I

2

MR. RADMORE:

Well, it's not good condition for

3

purposes of ordinary torts.

4

against the Government for the contents of the package.

5

In your hypothetical, Justice Breyer, if the toupee were

6

damaged as a result of the package being opened, then you

7

could not make a claim, because that was the content of

8

the mail, but if you fell over the package, that's an

9

ordinary tort, that's a common duty between private

10
11

persons.

The exception bars a claim

So -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

5

MR. RADMORE:

With respect to ordinary torts.

13

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Mr. Radmore, I don't think

you're quite correct when you say, with regard to an

in the destroy -- destruction of a package, a private

MR. RADMORE:

that exclusion would not only apply to the terms of the

2

exception "negligent transmission," but, if it's an

3

exclusion, as the Government has argued for, though they

4

haven't explained why the exclusion wouldn't apply to loss

5

and miscarriage, the logical endpoint of their exclusion

6

is that if you have a tractor-trailer that has 10,000 IRS

7

refund checks on it, and that tractor-trailer is in a

8

accident, and all of the refund checks are destroyed,

9

well, any private person who didn't get their refund check

10

in time, and couldn't pay their mortgage, or they couldn't

11

pay for their credit-card bill or they couldn't do

12

something as a result of the loss of those refund checks,

13

would be able to make a claim against the Government, as

14

long as the loss occurred from a motor-vehicle accident.

15

They make no explanation as to why that would not be the

16

case.

the Government asks for, and that the Third Circuit

followed, was that "negligent transmission" covered

was dropped off at the Post Office until it arrived at a

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

MS. MILLETT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Justice O'Connor, when you mentioned that this

4

is a waiver of sovereign immunity and we have to construe

5

that with that in mind, it's, sort of, central to our

6

starting to our point for understanding this statute.

7

This claim falls squarely within the text of the

8

statutory exception, and there doesn't seem to be much

9

dispute about that.

10

And the question is whether --

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But isn't it true that it

11

falls squarely within the word "transmission," just

12

exactly as an automobile accident arising out of carrying

13

-- transmitting mail does?

14

MS. MILLETT:

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

16
17

It falls with -They are both equally within

the plain language.
MS. MILLETT:

It falls within the word

18

"transmission," but the relevant phrase is "negligent

19

transmission of mail or postal matter."

20
21
22

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And --

Which is happening in the --

in the truck when it has an accident.
MS. MILLETT:

But what you're suing over in that

23

case -- and this is exactly the line this Court drew in

24

Kosak -- your claim isn't -- it has to arise out of the

25

negligent transmission of mail.

Your claim, when the --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

when the delivery truck or the postal truck rear-ends you,

2

doesn't arise out of the handling of the mail; it arises

3

out of the handling of the vehicle.

4

activities going on at the same time, and you're suing

5

about the one, and not the other.

6

it's --

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

There's two

And I think it's a --

Well, suppose you have a big

8

crate that the postman uses, because you've been away for

9

a week and yet the mail -- and he leaves a crate there,

10

and you trip on the crate.

11

be liability, because the crate's like the -- the crate

12

isn't the mail.

13

MS. MILLETT:

Under your view, there would

I think, at that point, sort of,

14

the crate and the mail have become one thing, as if he

15

left it in a bag or he -- they put a plastic bag around it

16

to protect it from the rain, and technically you would

17

trip over the plastic bag, but it's the lump of mail that

18

you're tripping over.

19

sticking out, and all you tripped over was the bar and not

20

the mail, then that might be a different case.

21

think that we have to look carefully at whether it arises

22

out of the handling of the mail.

23

distinction that protects the activity that the Postal

24

Service is engaged in that Congress wanted to protect, the

25

handling of the mail.

I mean, if the crate had some bar

But I do

And that is a

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But the key word in the

statute is "transmission," not "the transmission of

The key words, I think, are the

JUSTICE STEVENS:

MS. MILLETT:

12

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But --

And just as if you're -But if that's true, why do you

13

need the words "miscarried" -- why do you need the word

14

"miscarriage" in the statute?

15

MS. MILLETT:

I think "miscarriage" captures

16

delivery to the wrong person, which doesn't harm the mail,

17

itself.

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But you -- but so would the

19

word "transmission" if you -- under your reading, you

20

don't need the word "miscarriage."

21

MS. MILLETT:

What -- "transmission" adds a lot

22

-- I think if you look, sort of, sequentially, the way

23

Congress was thinking -- and it may not have been at, sort

24

of, this level -- but "loss" is mail that doesn't go

25

anywhere, it doesn't get there.

"Miscarriage" gets to the

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

wrong person.

2

but something went wrong in the process.

3

look at it that way, yes, there's no doubt there's

4

overlap, but "transmission" captures a lot more than just

5

"miscarriage."

6
7

"Transmission" gets to the right person,
And so, if you

And there has to be some

The other thing it doesn't capture is

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

1

the very important decisions that post -- the Post Office

2

has to make about getting the mail to someone on time.

3

Part of that is how I get it there.

4

includes not just how I get the millions of packages every

5

day that don't fit in a mailbox or a mail slot to their

6

customers; it includes how, after a hurricane, we decide

7

to deliver mail outside the Superdome or to people whose

mailboxes have been blown off of their houses.

So, how does it hurt you, say,

How would the Government be hurt?
MS. MILLETT:

First of all, that -- if the -- if

5

the exception, as I understand it, is that of harms to or

6

from the content of the mail, that isn't going to --

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

What we'd look to is, you'd

8

look to the purpose of this.

9

basically, I gather from the history, as recounted in

The purpose of it was,

10

Kosak -- in what the Court said in Kosak -- the purpose of

11

this is to try to bring back into sovereign immunity, so

12

you're not sued all the time, the very kind of common suit

13

that a person could protect himself for the loss by

14

registering the package, by taking out this ordinary

15

transmission insurance, which is not that hard to do.

16

they said, if we start opening it up to misdelivery

17

claims, all that pack -- family of things, everybody'll

18

say, "Hey, you hurt my pet, you didn't give me the check."

19
20

So,

I mean, all kinds of things will be opened up.
But the Government's already liable for what I'd

21

call the "swinging the package around," leaving it --

22

slip-and-fall, trucks.

Now, how does that hurt you, the Government, if that's how

24

we'd come out?

were held -- you know, when you -- when you held someone

13

liable for driving too fast through town, that was held

14

not to be a stoppage of the mail, stoppage of the

15

transmission of the mail.

16

more fundamentally, how the Postal Service decided to do

17

its deliveries, and whom it would authorize to undertake

the delivery, that was held to interfere with the mails.

MS. MILLETT:

"Who put this mail here?

This is

-- this is -- mail shouldn't be here."

18

-- a simple way of looking at it is, you have two things

going on at the same time in the car, in the vehicle.

You've got the regular activity of driving, and you've got

the transmission of mail.

And isn't

It is in the same -- it has the

same character, vis-a-vis tripping, that a brick or a rock

11

or any other package might have.

12

So, if you're going to be consistent with

respect to the passage of the truck, the package that

drops out of the truck, and the piece -- and the package
