ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM W. LOCKYER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10

MR. LOCKYER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This Court has repeatedly communicated an

11

understanding of the appropriate deference owed to

12

State court fact finding in habeas review under 28

13

U.S.C., section 2254.

14

case of the Ninth Circuit applying the proper standard

15

of deference, but getting the wrong result.

16

problem is the Ninth Circuit doesn’t get the standard.

17
18

Here, we don’t have a simple

The

Although -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Just at the -- at the

19

outset -- and I’m -- I’m not sure you’re prepared for

20

this, but the joint appendix, volume 2, is under seal, right?

21

MR. LOCKYER:

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Yes.
In the course of the

23

argument, I think we’d be very interested in knowing

24

about the colloquy that the trial judge had with the

25

attorneys, and if it’s under seal, it’s a little bit

3
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

awkward to do that.

be kept under seal?

Is there any reason that it has to

MR. LOCKYER:
Kennedy.

None -- none at all, Justice

I believe we provided the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MR. LOCKYER:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I -- I take it --

-- appendix 2 --- I take it that the --

8

the names of the jurors we don’t know because they’re

9

given numbers.

10

MR. LOCKYER:

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That’s correct.
So far as you know, the

12

counsel for the respondent would also have no

13

objection?

14
15
16
17

MR. LOCKYER:

Neither of us have any

objection, and it’s been quoted extensively -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

extensively in the Ninth Circuit I thought.

18

MR. LOCKYER:

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

20

MR. LOCKYER:

21
22

Yes, it was then quoted

In -- in the briefs as well.
Thank you.

Thank you, Mr. Kennedy --

Justice Kennedy.
In this instance, the Ninth Circuit professes

23

fealty to AEDPA deference, but it seems simply too

24

easy, having sensed a constitutional injury, to become

25

willing to attribute error to the State court and to

4
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

substitute its own factual inferences for those of the

2

trial judge.

3

The way the Court decides this case can

4

provide further instruction to habeas courts to help

5

them avoid the Ninth Circuit error.

6

least four instructions that might be considered.

7

I’d suggest at

First, confirming that the objective

8

reasonableness test, that inquiry under (d)(2), is like

9

that currently under (d)(1).

That is, the factual

10

inquiry, like that under the legal inquiry, more

11

deferential than review for clear error.

12

Second, since it seems logical that State

13

fact finding should be entitled to equal, if not

14

greater, respect than that now accorded State court

15

resolution of legal issues under (d)(1), we’ve argued

16

for adoption of the Jackson v. Virginia kind of

17

standard as consistent with the letter and spirit of

18

AEDPA, meaning that witness credibility determinations

19

rarely may be overturned, and that all of the evidence

20

must be reviewed in the light most favorable to the

21

factfinder.

22

Third, although Miller-El v. Dretke

23

represented an extraordinarily egregious and I

24

personally think undeniable violation of Batson, some

25

might react to a whiff of a little smoke as a Miller-El

5
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

fire.

2

that Miller-El v. Dretke dealt with a outlier and that

3

the traditional line of this Court’s habeas cases,

4

restricting Federal courts from second-guessing a State

5

judge’s credibility calls, retain their vitality.

6

Proper resolution of this case can make it clear

Finally and specifically responding to Mr.

7

Collins’ argument that this case, it seems, is an

8

opportunity to confirm the well-established presumption

9

of correctness for State court fact finding under

10

section 2254(e)(1), that it remains available in all

11

habeas cases.

12

presumption now applies only in the rare case of

13

Federal evidentiary hearings would eviscerate the

14

traditional presumption.

15

Collins’ view that the traditional

In my office --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, it is -- it is

16

a little unusual to have under your view two different

17

sections, both addressed to the question of the

18

appropriate standard of review in a particular type of

19

proceeding.

20

They seem either redundant or overlapping.

The theory on the other side at least distinguishes

21

them and argues that they apply in different

22

circumstances.

23

MR. LOCKYER:

That’s true, Mr. Chief Justice.

24

Our view is that the (e)(1) test really focuses on

25

specific facts that have been found in State court.

6
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

The (d)(2) focus is on the decision, which presumably

2

would be a bundle of multiple facts, the decision of

3

the court and whether it was objectively unreasonable.

4

And to limit the (e)(1) presumption not only,

5

I think, being contrary to congressional intention when

6

AEDPA reforms were adopted, and your cases that have

7

applied both (e)(1) and (d)(2) as separate, independent

8

tests -- in my office, there are 320 attorneys that do

9

Federal habeas work, 120,000 hours of lawyering.

If

10

you take out the capital cases, the non-capital Federal

11

habeas claims, only 2 or 3 percent ever go to a Federal

12

evidentiary hearing.

13

(e)(1) without the presumption in the cold record case

14

means basically the State loses the presumption for

15

almost every habeas claim that we look at.

16

seem to not be also supported by the statute’s clear

17

terms.

18

it -- it’s -- doesn’t apply across the board to all

19

habeas claims.

So the result of reading that

So it would

There’s no limitation written into (e)(1) that

20

The --

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What about the

22

contention in the particular proceeding that the

23

district court -- or the State fact finder did not, in

24

fact, make a determination, but simply gave the benefit

25

of the doubt to the prosecutor?

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. LOCKYER:

Mr. Chief Justice, I -- I think

2

that reading the transcript will show that the judge,

3

hearing the Batson motion, asking counsel to explain

4

the reasons for her strikes, allowing defense counsel

5

to comment and explain, and then the ruling of the

6

judge seems to be a general one, both contemplating

7

both demeanor and youthfulness, and benefit of the

8

doubt may refer back to the fact that there’s a dispute

9

about the challenged juror and whether she turned

10

aside, rolled her eyes in a dismissive and

11

disrespectful way.

12

see that behavior, but I’ll give you the benefit of the

13

doubt.

14

subsumes both claims, youthfulness and demeanor.

But I think the ruling is a general one that

15
16

And the judge says, well, I didn’t

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, I thought youthfulness

--

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And I -- I noticed the

18

defense attorney, respondent here, did not comment in

19

any way on the -- the demeanor of the -- of witness 16,

20

which means either the -- he -- he saw it and said

21

nothing or he -- he didn’t see it at all.

22

know.

23
24
25

MR. LOCKYER:
correct.

We don’t

Justice Kennedy, that’s

There was no comment.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What -- what is the

8
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

obligation that we impose on the prosecution in this

2

case to give a coherent explanation of why there -- the

3

juror was excused?

4

that step in Batson where an explanation has to be

5

given.

6

and complete that explanation has to be?

That step has proceeded.

What -- what have we said about how coherent

7

MR. LOCKYER:

8

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

9
10

We’re at

Well -Here, it seems that the

prosecutor was somewhat caught off guard or -- or
certainly was not extremely clear.

11

MR. LOCKYER:

Well, we are in the middle of a

12

-- a trial, of course, and it happens quickly and, as

13

the Court has suggested, often peremptory --

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I’m not so sure

15

quickly.

They gave notice that there’d be a Batson

16

hearing.

She should have known what’s going on.

17

MR. LOCKYER:

Yes, sir.

However, it was just

18

a short time later in the day, Justice Kennedy.

19

was a break to dismiss the jury and then come back to

20

the Batson claim.

21

There

But the peremptories, as the Court has

22

frequently said, are intuitive, often inarticulable.

23

In this case, I think the --

24
25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But the point is once

there’s a Batson challenge, it has to be articulated.

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. LOCKYER:

Well, I think that happens.

2

That is, as soon as the prosecutor is asked to defend

3

her challenge, she does, and she talks about

4

youthfulness.

5

ties in the community, doesn’t have a stake in the

6

community, is unmarried, perhaps has a greater

7

tolerance for drug crime with a small amount.

8

a three-strikes case.

9

think, for a district attorney to think that a third

She says the young person doesn’t have

This is

It would be a natural worry, I

10

strike, even though one and two were armed robbery and

11

rape -- that a third strike that’s a possession of a

12

small amount of drugs, you might need to worry about a

13

juror’s tolerance or worrying about that severity of

14

sentence.

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But -- but isn’t -- isn’t

16

the difficulty with your analysis there, General, that,

17

yes, she started out by -- by talking about

18

youthfulness.

19

about youthfulness and the -- and the demeanor, the

20

rolling of the eyes.

As I understand it, she started out talking

21

MR. LOCKYER:

22

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yes.
Sort of at the second stage,

23

again she spoke of youthfulness.

24

stage, she said, well, it’s a combination of -- of age,

25

gender, and inexperience.

Then at a third

Then she realized she was in

10
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

trouble, and she said, well, I really didn’t mean

2

gender because I -- I’d be in constitutional hot water

3

there.

4

because there are other young people on the jury, and

5

I’m -- I’m not challenging them.

6

thing that was left was possibly that element of age

7

which refers to ties to the community.

Then she said, well, I really don’t mean age

8

So that the only

And at the end of this long colloquy, in

9

which she has gone back and forth and back and forth

10

and -- and jettisoned some of her reasons, the trial

11

judge says, well, I didn’t see the eye-rolling, and I

12

guess I’ll give the benefit of the doubt to counsel.

13

don’t know whether the judge is talking about the

14

benefit of the doubt on eye-rolling or the benefit of

15

the doubt on -- on ties to the community.

16

I

Assuming it’s ties to the community, that has

17

nothing to do, I suppose, with -- with the -- the fear

18

that a young person is going to be too sympathetic to a

19

defendant who’s up for the third time with a small

20

amount of drugs.

21

And at the end of the day, it seems to me we

22

have what Justice Kennedy’s question in the first place

23

suggested.

24

response to the judge which simply does not tell you

25

what the judge is ruling on or the basis for the

We simply have an incoherent colloquy and a

First, I’d point to the language that the

However, 16 was a youthful person, as

10

was 6, and then prepared to give the district attorney

11

the benefit of the doubt.

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yes, but the district

13

attorney has -- I mean, the -- the point here is we’re

14

judging the district attorney’s responses, not the

15

judge’s responses.

16

MR. LOCKYER:

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Right.
What we want to know is what

18

the judge found and ruled upon.

19

as I understand it, has withdrawn the general claim

20

that youthfulness is a problem, and the only claim that

21

might have been -- might -- probably was comprehended

22

under youth that -- that remains is the claim of no

23

community ties.

24

from the judge’s ruling whether the judge is saying,

community ties and that’s certainly a race-neutral

2

reason.

3

5

I don’t know what the judge was -- was -MR. LOCKYER:

If I may, Justice Souter.

The

DA never withdrew the youthful claim.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, didn’t the DA say,

6

look, youth alone doesn’t -- doesn’t explain my reasons

7

because there are other young people on the jury that

8

-- that we’re not challenging, and -- and I don’t want

9

to suggest that all young people should be

10

disqualified?

11

MR. LOCKYER:

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Right.
General, does -- does the

13

judge have to find what the reason for the strike was,

14

or does the judge have to find what the reason for the

15

strike wasn’t?

16
17
18

MR. LOCKYER:

The judge has to find that it

was not a racially discriminatory strike.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

And if there are several

19

allegations and -- and each of them is somewhat

20

doubtful but, on balance, he says, I give the benefit

21

of the -- of the doubt to the -- to the district

22

attorney, it’s his indication that, as a matter of

23

fact, he finds that the reason wasn’t race.

24

MR. LOCKYER:

25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Justice Scalia, your direct -May I ask this question,

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

General?

2

MR. LOCKYER:

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Yes.
There are really two kinds

4

of Batson problems as I see it.

5

where the prosecutor is -- just is deliberately keeping

6

African Americans off the jury, and there -- there’s no

7

question there’s a violation there.

8
9

There are some cases

But I’m wondering if there isn’t another
category where persons are unconscious of their own

10

subconscious bias and not realizing that they

11

themselves have an unconscious fear that perhaps an

12

African American might not be a sympathetic juror.

13

Would that kind of failure to really identify the

14

problem within the prosecutor’s own conception of the

15

case -- would that be a Batson violation in your view?

16

MR. LOCKYER:

Well, probably not, because the

17

requirement is that the strike be intentionally done.

18

That is, there’s an intentionality.

19

unconscious, as you suggest, Justice Stevens, I -- I

20

would think that wouldn’t qualify.

21

JUSTICE STEVENS:

If it’s

If, for example, the judge

22

saw that over a period of time, a particular prosecutor

23

had hunches about jurors over and over again and they

24

just happened to be black most of the time.

25

not justify a -- a Batson challenge.

That would

convinced of the good faith of the prosecutor.

not suggesting bad faith.

MR. LOCKYER:

But just realizes this

8

person has an unconscious bias that shows up in the --

in the pattern of challenges.

10

13

Would that be a

justified challenge?
MR. LOCKYER:

You might be able to deduce

intent from -- infer it from a variety of challenges.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

No.

You have to accept his

14

hypothetical as he gave it.

15

attorney, the district attorney, was in good faith.

the attorney did not think that he or she was striking

the juror because of the juror’s race.

would rely on the trial judge to make a determination

of the intention of the district attorney --

history of several trials and so forth, that this

prosecutor unconsciously had this hunch with respect to

black jurors but not others, that would be a sufficient

basis for a challenge.

MR. LOCKYER:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I’d be inclined to say yes.

Lockyer.

power to district -- to -- to the district judge,

this U.S. attorney really doesn’t honestly believe that

he’s biased, but I think, being the great psychologist

would say we rely on the trial judge who’s there --

from the record.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

She was certainly -- she

suspect category, and she seemed to be -- her notion

was that it was okay to aim for a jury that had an

equal number of men and women.

19

seemed to be thinking the same thing with regard to age

20

too.

21

-- the reasonable explanation was we don’t want too

Federal magistrate, and a Federal district judge have

8

agreed with the trial judge’s perspectives.

9

But it could be that she is quoting, as

10

you’ll see in the transcript, California law that had

11

talked about jury balances.

12

and old.

13

It’s good to have young

It’s good to have different races.
I agree.

You’re absolutely right.

J.E.B. v.

14

Alabama had occurred a couple of years before, and the

15

judge does say, I don’t see, Ms. Satriano, that you are

16

seeking to justify excusing people of one ethnicity

17

based on gender.

18

you started with youth.

19

youth, ties in the community, tolerance for drug use,

20

unmarried, which might be distinctions with other young

21

people -- those -- do you have anything else to say?

22

And I -- I suspect she felt like compelled to come up

23

with some further explanation.

24
25

So he seemed to at least be saying,
Everything you said about

MR. LOCKYER:

Okay.

Yes.

During the

judicial voir dire.

4
5

I can’t figure it out.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, I have that in front of

me.

6

MR. LOCKYER:

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

And -What was the statement that

8

the judge made in respect to which the juror is

9

supposed to have rolled her eyes?

10

MR. LOCKYER:

The district attorney simply

11

says with one of the questions to which you -- the

12

prospective --

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

14

MR. LOCKYER:

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

16

It’s unclear.
So the reason I can’t find

it out is none of us know.

17
18

Which question?

MR. LOCKYER:

No, you’re right.

I mean, it’s

one where -- it doesn’t say in the record eye-rolling.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

20

wasn’t a question.

21

I can’t figure it out.

22

MR. LOCKYER:

And it actually says it

It was a statement, and that’s why

It -- it seems to be where the

23

juror said yes in response to the voir dire, and then

24

--

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Which was a question you

All we know

We don’t know what the question was.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. LOCKYER:

I see.

made about this confusing transcript -- and of course,

I don’t know what the file looked like with respect to

Miller-El, but this is it.

13

appropriate inquiries, say that he accepts her non-

14

racial reasons.

15

He’s there and sees the

Counsel for respondent does a lot to compare

16

to Miller-El and so perhaps it’s worth just

17

distinguishing briefly.

There we have 10 of 11 African

18

American jurors struck.

We have the lawyers doing the

19

questioning, trick questions, loaded questions,

20

complicated questions.

21

of the Dallas manual recommending discriminatory

22

strikes.

We have the external evidence

We have the cards with race written on them.

23
24

Here, we have a very brief, quick proceeding.

25

The judge is asking the questions and really resisting

20
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

lawyers’ attempts to add to that, to get more

2

information so you can make a valid assessment of the

3

juror that’s before you.

4

obviously, relying on intuition, trial experience, she

5

exercises the two peremptory challenges, one of which

6

was withdrawn on appeal and not pursued, the other with

7

respect to the young person, the demeanor, and

8

youthfulness are the grounds given.

9

And so in this instance,

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I ask just a -- kind of

10

a background question?

11

after ruling that he was under -- he -- I can’t

12

remember if it was a he or a she, but was under an

13

obligation to report its reasons for granting Wheeler

14

motion to the State bar.

I noticed the judge pointed out

15

MR. LOCKYER:

16

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Yes.
Does that -- did that

17

requirement apply after the Ninth Circuit decision?

18

there a requirement that the -- the lawyer be

19

investigated for possible discipline?

20

MR. LOCKYER:

Is

We tried to research it,

21

Justice Stevens, and we believe that it was a -- a

22

State court rule adopted subsequent to Wheeler.

23

that -- of course, unlike the way in which it is

24

characterized in respondent’s briefs, it wasn’t a

25

warning to her, the district attorney, that is.

And

It was

1

a general statement.

obligated to report.

3

If there’s a Batson claim, I’m

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I -- I read it as

4

saying, and therefore I’m going to be careful about

5

finding that there’s been a Batson violation.

6

wonder if that’s consistent with what we want trial

7

judges to do when they’re hearing Batson challenges.

8
9

MR. LOCKYEAR:

And I

Justice Kennedy, I

frankly didn’t read it that way.

It just seemed to be

he was stating the fact, that it would be an obligation

13

lawyer’s reputation if the judge were to affirm the

14

motion.

15

his job and performing his duties correctly.

16

Clearly, it has some impact on how people

But I -- I would expect the judge was doing

JUSTICE BREYER:

If you have a minute, you

17

might -- I don’t know if you -- if this is very useful.

18

But I’ve taken this point of view that -- that there’s

19

no way to get to the bottom of the use of stereotypes

20

in cases like this, a perfect example.

21

the only thing to do, consistent with the Constitution,

22

is no peremptories.

MR. LOCKYER:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK R. DROZDOWSKI

8

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

9
10
11

MR. DROZDOWSKI:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
The Ninth Circuit properly held that the

12

State appellate court decision represented an

13

unreasonable determination of facts because the

14

prosecutor did not give a single persuasive reason for

15

striking juror 16.

16

The circuit also rightly held that the --

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

18

of the eyes a persuasive reason?

19
20

MR. DROZDOWSKI:

Why isn’t the rolling

Well, here the rolling of

the eyes, first, is uncorroborated by the trial judge.

21

He says, quite frankly, I did not see it.

22

ruling, he does not credit that rationale.

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And in his

Well, what -- what should

24

happen if the trial judge doesn’t see it and a counsel,

25

who’s observant, said, judge, I’ve got a problem with

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

1

this juror?

2

-- has to see it, if he believes the counsel.

3
4

I don’t know that the trial judge has to

MR. DROZDOWSKI:

That could be, but here the

trial court’s --

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

We’ve -- we’ve all been --

6

been in court and -- and noticed that sometimes

7

witnesses or jurors or parties or even attorneys will

8

make faces and so forth that’s not consistent with --

9

with proper demeanor in a courtroom.

10

MR. DROZDOWSKI:

That’s correct.

But what’s

11

significant here is that this was a judge-conducted

12

voir dire where juror 16 would have been facing the

13

judge when giving her answer.

14

been in the best position to see the --

So the judge would have

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

17
18

So you’re --

Maybe the judge is reading.

A judge doesn’t watch -- watch the witness 100 percent
of the time.

19

That’s not credible.

MR. DROZDOWSKI:

As the Court has previously

20

mentioned, what we also have here is there’s no --

21

there’s no corroboration in the transcript that juror

22

--

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

So what is the point?

The

24

judge says, I’ll give the prosecution the benefit of

25

the doubt.

Well, he -- he knows the prosecutor and he

that isn’t, given the present law, sufficient.

I -- I read that as

MR. DROZDOWSKI:

Well --

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

I mean, I -- it’s pretty

19

hard to read that as saying, I’ll give him the benefit

20

of the doubt in respect to the youth.

I’ll give him the benefit of the doubt in respect to

the reasons he gave for challenging her.

MR. DROZDOWSKI:

Okay.

And he says,

Even if the Court

or contradicted or unsupported by the record.

The demeanor rationale wasn’t the sole reason

this.

17

must give the real reason for the strike, not just any

18

rational basis the prosecutor can think up.

19

we look at the transcript of the Batson hearing here,

20

we see a prosecutor scrambling to think of anything she

--

22

Miller-El makes clear that the district attorney

Well, isn’t this just

23

another way of saying you don’t believe the proffered

justification?

25

made a credibility determination that that was the

reason, the person rolled her eyes, and you’re saying,

2

in light of the other explanations, you think the

3

prosecutor is just making that up.

4

MR. DROZDOWSKI:

I -- I think two things.

I

5

think, one, the reasonable conclusion is the prosecutor

6

is making it up, but even if the Court -- the Court

7

doesn’t need to accept that to still come to the

8

conclusion and say the demeanor rationale is still not

9

the reason for the strike.

10

here.

11

they’re all either --

She can’t say the reason

12

She comes up with six different reasons, but

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So you’re saying you

13

don’t believe it.

14

reason, and the rolling the eyes is not the real

15

reason.

16

judge believes that that’s the reason or a reason.

17

under the -- the statute, at least that -- that’s --

18

that either has to be shown to be unreasonable or,

19

under the State’s reason, that’s presumed to be

20

correct, and you have to show it by clear and

21

convincing evidence.

22

You think there’s a different

And we have a factual determination that the

MR. DROZDOWSKI:

And

And the Ninth Circuit

23

properly found that the conclusion was both

24

unreasonable and rebutted by clear and convincing

evidence, and it’s because none of these reasons, when

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

we look at the totality -- what I’m trying to say is --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What was the -- on the --

3

on the eye-roll, which I thought also the -- the

4

prosecutor said that she turned her head.

be that she was out of the vision of the -- the judge

even if he had been looking.

8

rebutted by clear and convincing evidence.

9

no evidence.

10

So it may

I don’t see that you have

You said, well, it was

There was no evidentiary hearing.

MR. DROZDOWSKI:

Well, we cited a case on

11

page 24 in our brief, a Third Circuit case, Riley, that

12

says a reviewing court’s suspicion may be raised by a

13

series of very weak explanations given for the strike.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

There -- there’s no doubt

15

that the court -- or at least in my mind, that -- that

16

the trial court could have come out the other way.

17

-- I -- you know, all of the things you say are quite

18

true.

19

come out the other way, whether it was just utterly

20

unreasonable for the trial court to come out the way it

did.

22

23

that, but I -- I find it difficult to see how -- how

24

you can establish that -- not only that -- that the

I

The question is whether the trial court had to

1

indeed, maybe in your judgment, maybe in my judgment,

2

should have come out the other way.

3

establish that it’s unreasonable not to come out the

4

other way.

5

you can do that when you have a transcript that relies,

6

in part, upon the -- you know, the rolling of the eyes

7

and the -- and the trial court says, I’m -- I’m willing

8

to give her the benefit of the doubt that that’s the

9

reason she did it.

10

But you have to

And -- and I find it hard to -- to see how

MR. DROZDOWSKI:

Well, Miller-El emphasizes

11

that we need to view the prosecutor’s behavior

12

cumulatively. And again, when we look at here the --

13

the prosecutor coming out with one reason after another

14

to try to justify her strikes, consecutive strikes, of

15

the only two black women on this jury, there’s just

16

simply no credibility left to give to the demeanor

17

rationale even if one views that it’s --

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought there was

another -- another.

22

Mr. -- trial counsel -- defense counsel, explained at

the hearing was a person of color but not African

So the record shows, I believe, we have one

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Now -- now, number 19 was

excused and was a black person.

3

MR. DROZDOWSKI:

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That’s correct.
And -- and a woman.

And if

5

that too had been suspicious and challenged, then you

6

might have had a pattern, a pattern of two people,

7

which could have overcome the demeanor testimony --

8

demeanor claim.

9

But I -- I think on this record that we have

10

to assume that there is nothing wrongful about excusing

11

juror 19 merely because respondent’s counsel here --

12

you did not pursue that.

13

as telling us that so far as juror 19 is concerned,

14

there was an adequate reason for excusing that juror.

15

At least respondent’s counsel -- you have not said that

16

there wasn’t.

17

MR. DROZDOWSKI:

I -- I read the record as --

Well, on the State appeal,

18

it’s true that Collins’ attorney dropped the claim

19

specifically as to juror 19.

20

prosecutor’s strike of juror 19 is relevant is at step

21

three of Batson, this Court has emphasized that the

duty of the trial judge to determine purposeful

discrimination requires an examination of all the

relevant circumstances.

with the problem if we hold against you.

MR. DROZDOWSKI:

How is this thing supposed to work?
MR. DROZDOWSKI:

Well, I -- I think if -- if

21

the Court allows to happen what -- what happened here,

22

then I think the message it could be saying to

23

prosecutors, is as long as you can just rifle off a

24

series of -- of reasons for your strike and then the

25

trial court latches onto one of them, taking it out of

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

the context of the plausibility of all the other

2

strikes, then we’re going to allow this type of behavior

3

to continue.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

This prosecutor presumably

5

appears before this judge on other occasions, and --

6

and don’t you think we -- we can give some weight to

7

the fact that the judge is there, sees the woman, sees

8

what she’s saying, and -- and can judge better than we

9

can whether she’s making this up or just -- just is --

10

is somewhat confused, especially since, as -- as I

11

think the General pointed out, we’re dealing with a

12

kind of determination that is usually instinctive on

13

the part of trial counsel.

14

about this, you know, and you move to strike.

15

sure it springs into your mind, at the time you -- you

16

move to strike, the precise reason.

Then somebody asks

17

you later, why was it?

There was just

18

something about that person I didn’t like.

19

wasn’t the race.

20

what was it?

21

-- a rational process that, in fact, never occurred.

22

It was an instinctive process more than a rational one.

23

So I’m -- I’m not particularly upset by -- by

There’s just something

Why was it?

I’m not

I know it

That had nothing to do with it.

Now,

And then -- then you have to recreate a

24

seeing counsel flounder about in -- in trying to come

25

up with what the right reason was.

I think it’s

32
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

probably pretty hard to figure out.

2

MR. DROZDOWSKI:

First of all, there’s

3

nothing in the record to indicate that this prosecutor

4

had appeared many times before this trial judge.

5

Another point is --

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, she might in the

7

future, if she’s got a job as a prosecutor in this

8

court.

9

her reputation, her integrity before the court.

10

So she’s certainly going to be concerned with

MR. DROZDOWSKI:

That’s right, but I guess

11

what I’m trying to say is it’s not that the judge said,

12

you know, Ms. Prosecutor, you’ve appeared before me

13

many times and I’m willing to give you the benefit of

14

the doubt because I know the way you are.

15

nothing like that here.

16

We have

Also, as far as it being instinctive, Batson

17

and Miller-El require the prosecutor to give the

18

reasons and stand and fall on the plausibility of those

19

reasons.

20

And -- and here -JUSTICE SCALIA:

I’m saying that it’s hard.

21

That’s all.

22

somebody would flop around because, at the time the

23

strike is made, I’m -- I’m not sure it’s always an

24

entirely rational rather than instinctive action.

25

And -- and that you can understand why

MR. DROZDOWSKI:

I understand, but what’s

33
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

significant here is when she is flopping around, the

2

reason she comes up with -- she says gender.

3

And she doesn’t strike

All right.

Let me -- let me

ask you as a -- as a response to -- to the kind of the

10

incoherent flopping around argument, let me ask you

11

what your position would be if the record were

12

different in the following respect.

13

Let’s assume the record is just what it is up

14

until that final paragraph or so in which the judge

15

rules.

16

the judge says the following two things.

17

number one, I didn’t see the eye-rolling, but I accept

18

counsel’s representation of fact that the eye-rolling

19

went on and I certainly understand the -- the

20

significance of that.

21

fact.

22

And instead of doing what he did in this case,
He says,

So I’m going to take that as a

Number two, even though counsel has withdrawn

23

the -- the sort of the general claim of youth and so

24

on, I understand counsel still to be saying this is a

25

person without any manifest ties to the community and

34
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

-- and that suggests a certain looseness of

2

responsibility.

3

And based upon the eye-rolling and based upon

4

the lack of ties to the community, I think counsel had

5

a race-neutral basis for the -- for the strike that was

6

made, and for that reason, I’m going to overrule the

7

Batson challenge with respect to number 16.

8

What would your position be?

9

MR. DROZDOWSKI:

Well, that -- that would be

10

a -- a tougher case for us because we would have an

11

explicit ruling --

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Right.

13

MR. DROZDOWSKI:

-- of what actually

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

What would your position be?

16

MR. DROZDOWSKI:

I still think that in this

14

happened.

17

case, given the entire context and all the other

18

reasons given, including the gender reason, that it

19

would still -- that those demeanor and youth reasons

20

would still not be persuasive looking at the context --

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So you would say that those

22

two conclusions on the part of the court were

23

unreasonable?

24
25

MR. DROZDOWSKI:

On -- on this record, yes,

given all the other reasons we have given by the

35
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

prosecutor.

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And you would say

3

you’ve established that by clear and convincing

4

evidence?

5

MR. DROZDOWSKI:

I would because when we go

6

through the comparative juror analysis and look at the

7

record of the whole, we see that the reasons given, for

8

example, on youth are not used for similarly situated

9

white jurors.

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but number 6 was a

11

young white -- young white male, I believe, and he was

12

excused on the ground of youth.

13

MR. DROZDOWSKI:

So it’s consistent.

6 was different in that he

14

was unemployed, in fact, had never been employed, and

15

also he had an uncle who was a recovered alcoholic, and

16

that made him quite different from juror 16.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What’s wrong with the

18

explanation, as far as youth is concerned, is that she

19

didn’t want to across-the-board strike young people,

20

but she just wanted to come up with a jury that had

21

dominantly older people.

So that wouldn’t mean that

22

she’s withdrawing youth.

It’s just that she’s saying

23

it isn’t an absolute with me.

24
25

MR. DROZDOWSKI:

Well, I think she’s also

admitting that youth wasn’t a reason because she’s

36
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

saying there are other young people on the jury, and

2

the significant question here --

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, what’s -- one -- one

4

point could be I don’t want too many young people, so

5

I’m going to exercise some peremptories to make sure

6

that the jury is dominantly older people.

7

with that?

8
9

MR. DROZDOWSKI:

What’s wrong

What’s wrong with that here

is the question is why is she using that rationale

10

against the young black juror and not the -- the young

11

white jurors on the panel?

12

achieve the balance by striking juror 16?

13

How come she’s seeking to

Well, she did.

15

MR. DROZDOWSKI:

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

17

there.

18

was certainly a factor in that case.

eyes.

22

the totality of the reasons, which include looking at

23

the way she treated juror 19, we have the lack of ties

24

in the community --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Juror 19 -- you just

said earlier the fact that the one juror’s uncle had an

2

alcohol problem was -- was a legitimate factor.

3

19’s daughter had a -- a cocaine problem and this was a

4

cocaine case.

5

for exercising a peremptory with respect to a juror?

6

Juror

Isn’t that a perfectly legitimate reason

MR. DROZDOWSKI:

The significance of the

7

treatment of juror 19 is, right out of the box, the

8

prosecutor is coming up with reasons that she says

9

apply to both 16 and 19, the only two black women on

10

the jury.

11

they’re different in age and occupation status, the

12

number of children they have, and people they -- who

13

are close to them who have substance abuse problems.

14

And right out of the box, the prosecutor is saying that

15

both of them are disqualified from jury service because

16

they’re both young, when juror 19, in fact, was a

17

retired grandmother.

18

And these are very disparate women, and

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But that -- that was so

19

obviously a slip, and Judge Hall pointed that out in

20

her dissent.

21

confused on the numbers.

22

prosecutor wasn’t trying to say a grandmother is going

23

to be excused -- is going to be struck because she’s

24

young.

25

Defense counsel too confused -- was

MR. DROZDOWSKI:

Obviously, it -- the -- the

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Would you say the same

14

thing about the defense counsel confusing jurors 16 and

15

19 on page 9?

16

discussing juror 19 at the top of page 10.

it’s a necessary reading.

what is the inference you try to draw from the

2

treatment of juror 19?

3

was striking people on the basis of their race or that

4

she had better reasons for 19 than 16?

5

That the prosecutor wants to --

MR. DROZDOWSKI:

No, no.

The conclusion is

6

that she was striking jurors on the basis of the race,

7

that she is using --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And then what do you

do with the fact that juror 19’s daughter had a cocaine

10

problem and this was a cocaine case?

11

to be -- that’s not a race-based reason.

12

to me to be a good reason.

That doesn’t seem
That’s seems

13

MR. DROZDOWSKI:

14

challenging the strike of 19 per se.

15

is that the prosecutor’s reasons she gave for 19 are

16

important in trying to determine whether she is

17

intentionally discriminating in striking juror 16.

18

the fact that she is lumping the two jurors together,

19

not treating them as individuals, but treating them, in

20

fact, stereotypically by saying that all -- that three

21

of these reasons apply to both of them, when the record

22

clearly shows that they don’t apply to juror 19, it

23

shows -- it shows the discriminatory behavior.

24
25

Right.

We’re not
What we’re saying

And

The -- the Attorney General said that this
case is unlike Miller-El, but I’d just like to

40
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

emphasize certainly here we have a petitioner who was

2

representing himself pro se and he did not present

3

extra-record evidence of a -- of a history of

4

discrimination.

5

But the case-specific evidence is similar to

6

Miller-El in important respects, and Miller-El requires

7

relief in this case.

8
9

First -- first of all, three of the reasons
given here for the strikes pertain just as well to non-

10

black jurors as to the black jurors, and that’s youth,

11

tolerance, and single.

12

Here, as in Miller-El, we have the district

13

attorney scrambling from rationale to rationale and,

14

when called on, one of the reasons shifting to another.

15

And here, the district attorney did not ask

16

questions on grounds later used to justify the strike.

17

Now, clearly here, it’s a judge-conducted voir dire,

18

but the attorneys were allowed to ask the judge to ask

19

different questions -- to ask that the judge ask

20

additional questions.

21

the voir dire of jurors 1 through 17, the -- the

22

prosecutor asked the judge to ask four additional

23

questions.

24

and one specifically about juror 8.

25

never asked that any additional questions be asked of

additional questions on the Batson claim.

of review, and courts have been construing AEDPA for

11

over 9 years now.

12

for the State’s argument.

13

That should be the end of the line

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What do you do with

14

the argument that your reading of the two sections

15

means that (e)(1) would only apply in a very small

16

number of cases, and it’s obvious that Congress was

17

trying to tighten the habeas review procedures?

18

MR. DROZDOWSKI:

Our argument is based on the

19

-- the structure and text of the statute and -- and the

20

fact that the clear and convincing requirement is tied

21

to the presumption of correctness.

22

I’d like to emphasize that the Ninth Circuit

23

in this case did apply both (d)(2) and (e)(1), as this

24

Court did in Miller-El, and found that Collins has

25

satisfied both standards.

So I just want to emphasize

42
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

for the Court, even if it does not agree with us on our

2

construction of (e)(1), that relief is still

3

appropriate in this case.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In -- in a sense, the

standards perhaps ought to be reversed.

10
11

When you hear

You should presume that it’s

So you could argue that they should be -MR. DROZDOWSKI:

Right.

I -- I think our

12

argument is based on the fact that we have the

13

presumption of correctness as part of (e), which is the

14

fact development procedure in Federal court.

15

The State’s Jackson argument, I’d just like

16

to highlight, is irreconcilable with what this Court

17

said in Miller-El I, and what it did in Miller-El II.

18

In Miller-El I, this Court stated that Federal courts

19

can disagree with State court credibility

20

determinations and, when guided by AEDPA, determine

21

that the conclusion is unreasonable or its factual

22

premise rebutted by clear and convincing evidence.

23

In Miller-El II, this Court disagreed with

24

the State court credibility determination and granted

25

habeas relief even though the significance of some of

43
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

the habeas petitioner’s evidence was open to judgment

2

calls.

3

By contrast, this Court stated in Schlup v.

4

Delo, that the assessment of credibility is generally

5

beyond the scope of review in Jackson.

6

And in the Crenshaw case cited by the State,

7

the Court explained that under Jackson, the test for

8

rejecting evidence as incredible is extraordinarily

9

stringent and is met, for example, only when the

10

testimony given is describing facts that are physically

11

impossible.

12

This Court couldn’t have granted relief in

13

Miller-El if it construed (d)(2) or (e)(1) as

14

containing the Jackson test, and the State’s approach

15

would effectively bar habeas relief whenever a habeas

16

petitioner challenged a credibility determination.

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Do you think that (d)(2) or

18

(e)(1) is the -- is the stricter requirement?

19

really not sure which of the two.

20

-- it might be possible to show, by clear and

21

convincing evidence, that the State court decision was

22

-- factual decision was wrong, but you, nonetheless, do

23

not show that it was unreasonable?

24

may well be that (d)(2) is -- is the more severe one.

MR. DROZDOWSKI:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

9

MR. DROZDOWSKI:

No, we don’t.
Thank you.
If I could briefly sum up.

10

In Powers v. Ohio, this Court said that the Fourteenth

11

Amendment mandate, that racial discrimination be

12

eliminated from all acts and proceedings of the State,

13

is most compelling in the judicial system.

14

Here, the district attorney struck two of

15

three African American jurors, including both black

16

women, where a black defendant was facing a sentence of

17

25 years to life in a three-strikes case for possessing

18

.1 grams of cocaine.

19

One of the reasons given by the district

20

attorney is patently unconstitutional:

21

all the other reasons are either contradicted or

23

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And

Do you, by any means -- you

24

don’t contend, though, the fact that she did rely, in

25

part, on an unconstitutional reason is a sufficient

reason.

that that would be a sufficient reason for setting

the best clear way to see what the Ninth Circuit did
