ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8
9

We'll hear argument

MR. PHILLIPS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

10

The fundamental question that's posed in this

11

particular case is whether or not the court of appeals

12

by adopting a rule that declares categorically that

13

three out of the four traditional factors for deciding

14

whether or not to grant permanent injunctive relief

15

will be irrebuttably presumed to be satisfied whenever

16

a jury has found that a patent is valid and has been

17

infringed.

18

The rule in the Federal Circuit for at least

19

20 years has been that if you have validity and

20

infringement decided by the jury, that then there is

21

irrebuttable finding of -- of irreparable injury, of

22

inadequate remedy at law, and that the balance of harms

23

decidedly favors the plaintiff, and that the only issue

24

that remains available to the defendant in that

25

circumstance is a heightened scrutiny on the standard

3
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

of whether or not the -- the public interest commands

2

that an injunction be denied in a particular case.

3

even in that context, the Federal Circuit's rule is

4

extraordinarily stringent because not just any public

5

interest can -- will satisfy, but instead, it has to be

6

a public interest that endangers the public health.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:
Bryson's decision?

And

Is that all in Judge

I certainly didn't see it there.

MR. PHILLIPS:

That -- that is precise -- I

10

think it's the only way to read Judge Bryson's

11

decision, Justice Ginsburg, where the court says, at

12

page 26a, that a permanent injunction will issue once

13

infringement and validity have been adjudged, and then

14

say, to be sure, it will not be so to protect the

15

public interest.

16

with respect to the grant of injunctive relief is that

17

it's a four-factor test.

18
19
20

And we all know the traditional rule

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I didn't see anything

about irrebuttable presumption.
MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, the point is that if an

21

injunction follows with a finding of -- of validity and

22

infringement, then that means that there has to be --

23

there has to be irreparable injury, inadequate remedy

24

at law, and that the balance of hardships has to tilt

25

in -- in favor of the plaintiff.

And then the only

4
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

issue that remains is whether or not the public

2

interest justifies not granting an injunction under the

3

circumstances of this case.

4

other way to read that.

5

It seems to me there's no

And if you read it in the context of the --

6

of the previous 20 years of decisions from the Federal

7

Circuit, it is absolutely clear.

8

opportunity to come back as a defendant in an

9

infringement action and say, Your Honor, in the

We don't have the

10

specific facts of this case, this is someone for whom

11

money damages is a completely adequate remedy.

12

And -- and it seems to me quite clear that

13

section 283 is designed to be exactly the opposite of

14

the way the Federal Circuit has interpreted this --

15

this scheme.

16

is at page 1 of the blue brief -- district courts,

17

quote, may -- not shall -- grant injunctions in

18

accordance with principles of equity.

19

of equity, as Justice Story said almost 200 years ago,

20

systematically reject the idea that you will act on a

21

categorical basis in deciding whether or not to grant

22

or withdraw the injunctive relief in -- in particular

23

circumstances.

24

at each specific issue.

25

Section 283 says explicitly -- and this

And principles

And to the contrary, you have to look

And in that regard --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Is -- is that so with --

2

with respect to someone else's use of -- of your

3

property?

4

someone takes your property, that the court wouldn't --

5

wouldn't give you the property back and -- and simply

6

say, you know -- I can think of a few extraordinary

7

examples.

8

gold, you know, the -- the old classic, I guess you'd

9

get the money back.

It seems to me very rare where -- where

If somebody makes a statue out of stolen

But ordinarily we're talking about

10

a property right here, and -- and the property right is

11

-- is explicitly the right to exclude others from --

12

from use of that.

13

And all he's asking for is give me my property back.

14

That's what the patent right is.

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

And -- and Congress

15

already made the -- the balance, Justice Scalia, with

16

respect to that because Congress obviously identified

17

the property right as the right to exclude.

18

Congress did not confer upon the district courts no

19

discretion to act in -- in a situation where the

20

property right has been violated.

21

expressly adopts in 283 a very broad grant of equitable

22

discretion.

23

you very well may have irreparable injury proved, but

24

the question is, do you -- do you eliminate any inquiry

25

and any specific facts of the case and instead not only

And then

Instead, Congress

To be sure, in the ordinary case, you --

6
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

presume it, which I think is a mistake, although the

2

district court did that and found that in this case the

3

presumption was rebutted, but to -- but to say

4

irrebuttably it's presumed that you have irreparable

5

injury, irrebuttably presumed that you don't have an

6

adequate remedy at law, and irrebuttably presume that

7

the balance of equities tilt in favor of the plaintiff.

8
9
10

And that, it seems to me, cannot be squared with the
language of the statute.
And, indeed, on that score, the United States

11

sort of magically ends up on our side of the -- of the

12

table because the United States says the same thing.

13

There is no way --

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

On Justice Scalia's

15

question, I was trying to think of some, and I was

16

trying to think the analogy might -- you might find

17

some analogy in the public utilities field, the -- or a

18

ferris wheel or something.

19

who uses his property not at all himself, but licensed

20

the public generally.

21

issue an injunction there?

22

I don't realize I don't know the answer.

23

What you want is a person

And now would a -- would a court

MR. PHILLIPS:

And as I think about that,

I don't know of any.

I mean,

24

I certainly wouldn't categorically declare that you

25

have to I guess is the way I would respond to that.

7
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, that's what -- I mean,

2

that -- that's what you're trying to analogize this

3

case to, I guess, is a person who licenses others to

4

use his property and never uses it himself.

5
6
7

9

MR. PHILLIPS:

That's precisely what this

case involves.
JUSTICE BREYER:

And there, I don't know how

courts do normally act in other areas of property law.
MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I don't know that there

10

are a whole lot of them like that, but the one thing

11

that -- I mean, there are two things to think about the

12

property concept in the statute.

13

First of all, Congress does not declare that

14

the property interest here is a real property interest,

15

which traditionally has been protected differently.

16

It's a personal property interest, which is

17

traditionally given -- accorded less protection under

18

this kind of a scheme.

19

again, Congress in any event struck the balance.

20

didn't say, as it could have, that there is presumed --

21

there's a presumption that we have an injunction.

22

didn't say, as it could have, that we shall have a --

23

shall have either a presumption or an injunction in any

24

particular case.

25

here, it seems to --

And so there -- and -- and
It

It

And so under the statutory scheme

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but -- but the

2

exercise of discretion is channeled over time, as -- as

3

judges apply it in -- in similar cases.

4

suggesting that in a typical run-of-the-mine patent

5

case, no special considerations, it would be wrong to

6

say that in those cases you typically would grant an

7

injunction?

8
9

MR. PHILLIPS:

You're not

I think in those cases, the

irreparable injury and the inadequacy of the remedy at

10

law will be -- will be easy to demonstrate, as they

11

have been for hundreds of years.

12

The -- the fundamental difference -- this is

13

important to have this in mind.

14

adopted this rule of law some 20 years ago.

15

before the high-tech boom, before the explosion in the

16

number of patents.

17

these issues on an individualized basis that might give

18

rise to some kinds of rules that you could, in fact,

19

apply to the generality of cases based on an experience

20

has never been there.

21

irrebuttable presumption for 20 years in a way that has

22

-- has completely stultified the ability to develop any

23

of those kinds of rules.

24
25

The Federal Circuit
That's

And so the opportunity to deal with

We have been dealing with an

And what we're asking this Court to do at
this point is to say, no, enough is enough.

We need to

9
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

go back to a time where the -- go back to the language

2

of the statute, confer the discretion on the district

3

courts.

4

And it's important not just for a case like

5

this one, but it -- but it distorts tremendously the

6

settlement value and the process and the relationship

7

between the patent holder and all of the potential

8

licensees because we're in a -- in a world -- and I

9

don't think the Court can ignore this because it's in

10

the amicus briefs.

11

holder files a lawsuit in Marshall, Texas, no patent

12

has ever been declared invalid in that jurisdiction,

13

and no patent has ever been found not to infringe.

14

And then you take that finding automatically and you

15

turn it into an injunction.

16

threatened under those circumstances and told that

17

we're going to face a lawsuit in Marshall, Texas is

18

going to have a very different negotiating posture than

19

in a situation where --

20

We're in a world where if a patent

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Any person who has been

You know, I mean, that's --

21

that's a problem with Marshall, Texas, not with the

22

patent law.

23

that problem.

I mean, maybe -- maybe we should remedy

24

MR. PHILLIPS:

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, I hope you do.
But I don't think we should

10
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

write -- write our patent law because we have some

2

renegade jurisdictions.

3

Why -- why isn't the -- the free market

4

normally adequate to solve any problems you're talking

5

about?

6

going to hold off giving the license beyond the point

7

where -- where it makes financial sense.

Everybody is in this for the money.

8

MR. PHILLIPS:

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10
11

Nobody is

Well -Why can't -- why can't we

let the market take care of the problem?
MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I think the -- the

12

market will take care of the problem.

13

under what standards are you going to apply.

14

going to say that there is no effective check on the

15

jury system, that it goes automatically from a jury's

16

finding to injunctive relief, or are you going to

17

implement it against the backdrop of what Congress

18

specifically provides, which is that the district

19

courts should exercise equitable discretion in deciding

20

how best to proceed.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The question is
Are you

One of the problems with

22

the district court exercising equitable discretion

23

without a close review by the Federal Circuit is just

24

the thing that the Federal Circuit was created to

25

handle, that is, you get a tremendous disparity among

11
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

district judges.

2

Marshall, Texas that you have a tilt in one direction

3

or in the other.

4

not to say that the district judges have no discretion,

5

but to try to rein it in somewhat so that you won't

6

have wide disparities, which you very well might have

7

if you just say discretion to the district judges and

8

very light review on appeal.

9

I don't know that it's only in

So the Federal Circuit is put there

MR. PHILLIPS:

But, Justice Ginsburg, the --

10

the problem with that is that that's not the scheme

11

that Congress created with respect to the remedial

12

aspects of -- of the patent laws.

13

the case that Congress meant, as -- as substantive

14

patent law is generally enforced and implemented, that

15

the Federal Circuit would play a significant role in

16

ensuring some kind of uniformity, but Congress didn't

17

then go the extra step and say, and when it comes time

18

to decide whether or not injunctive relief ought to be

19

granted, that it will -- that we will presume it or

20

that we will deal with it in a categorical way.

21

Congress granted that discretion to the district courts

22

and with good reason because district --

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I mean, it is surely

I think maybe you exaggerate

24

the -- the extent of equitable discretion.

25

wasn't as though it's just left up to the judge, seems

I mean, it

12
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

like a good idea or not a good idea.

2

of rules for when -- when you would give injunctive

3

relief and not.

4

you're going to get into the kind of wide-ranging

5

allowance that -- that you seem to be arguing for.

6

There are a lot

And -- and I -- you know, I'm not sure

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I don't know that I need

7

a wide-ranging allowance with respect to this.

8

need is elimination of the irrebuttable presumption

9

that doesn't allow any consideration of whether money

10

What I

damages are adequate in a particular case.

11

And -- and here, it's very important to

12

focus.

13

woke up this morning and I felt really good about the

14

defendant, and therefore, I'm not granting an

15

injunction.

16

specific findings of fact with regard to the adequacy

17

of money damages to deal --

18

The -- the district judge didn't just say, I

The district court here said, I'm making

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but he said

19

other things too, and one thing he said is, I don't

20

like business method patents very much, and so I'm not

21

going to give an injunction here.

22

MR. PHILLIPS:

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

24
25

Well, that's -Do you think that was

proper or improper?
MR. PHILLIPS:

That's -- that's not precisely

13
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

what he said, Mr. Chief Justice.

2

business method patents stand on a somewhat different

3

footing because they're subject --

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What he said was that

He said there's a

5

growing concern over the issuance of business method

6

patents.

7

MR. PHILLIPS:

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

9
10
11

Right.
Is that an

appropriate consideration to take into account in
determining whether to grant an injunction or not?
MR. PHILLIPS:

I think probably, at the end

12

of the day, it wouldn't be, but the bottom line is that

13

he did that in the context of analyzing the public

14

interest consideration and he said that didn't --

15
16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, then he went on

and he said --

17

MR. PHILLIPS:

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

-- tilt in favor.
-- another -- another

19

consideration is that this patentee does not practice

20

its patents.

21

you know, the -- the guy in the garage and he's an

22

inventor and the way he's going to market his

23

discoveries is by getting some firm that basically

24

speculates on patents.

25

But, I mean, isn't that just saying he's,

MR. PHILLIPS:

Sure.

And --

14
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And if he's denying

2

that inventor, you know, the -- what he'd give to Bell

3

Labs -- or whatever Bell Labs is these days -- that

4

does practice the inventions --

5
6

MR. PHILLIPS:
but --

7

(Laughter.)

8

MR. PHILLIPS:

9

I should know that actually,

But, Mr. Chief Justice, I -- I

think you can -- it's -- it's not fair to pick apart

10

each one of his findings and say does that finding good

11

enough or is that finding enough.

12

The truth is the district court made a series

13

of four findings that overlap, and one of which was,

14

obviously, he doesn't -- he doesn't practice this

15

patent.

16

willing to license his patent to eBay.

17

license this patent to anybody under these

18

circumstances.

He also doesn't effectively license.

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

20

MR. PHILLIPS:

He's

He's willing to

Well, but --

And candidly, most of the

21

licensing arrangements don't even exist, and they're --

22

I'm sorry, Justice Kennedy.

23

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I'm -- I interrupted

you.

rather substantial.

business process patent is -- is difficult to define

and could be very -- it can be very restrictive.

5

I -- I thought that was

The whole point is, is that a

MR. PHILLIPS:

I -- I think in -- in a proper

6

case -- and I don't think you do it under the --

7

under the public interest analysis.

8

probably end up doing it under the balance of the

9

hardships.

I think you'd

But in any event -- and -- and what you --

10

you know, obviously, this case is -- is more

11

complicated because --

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

My concern is if you take

13

that away, I don't know if you've got a lot left for

14

the -- saying no injunction in this case.

15
16
17

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I -- I mean, there's

plenty left because he doesn't practice this invention.
He has no intention of practicing this invention

beyond the receipt of money.

19

completely adequate remedy under these particular

20

circumstances, given -- given especially the fact that

21

if -- if the infringement continues -- and remember,

22

this is not a situation where he proposes to continue

to infringe.

24

infringement continues, we're then subject to enhanced

25

damages and all of the deterrent power that that has,

plus the possibility, obviously, down the road that the

2

district court could, on a rule 54 motion, now come

3

back and say, well, no, now I've decided that

4

injunctive relief is warranted under these

5

circumstances.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, isn't it a concern

7

that Congress didn't provide for compulsory licensing

8

which this seems to have a very strong resemblance to?

9

It says eBay wants to do this, so they're going to

10

have to pay for it, but the patentee can't stop them.

11

It just has -- in effect, has to license them to do it.

12

MR. PHILLIPS:

But -- but we're not asking

13

for a compulsory license because it is not our

14

intention, going forward, to infringe this patent.

15

We've made it very clear to the district court and the

16

district court recognizes that we not only intend to

17

but have, in fact, implemented a design-around or a

18

work-around to this particular patent.

19

we expect will happen.

20

right to continue to infringe and a willingness to

21

pay as we go.

22

And that's what

So we're not asking for the

very difficult to define the metes and bounds of this

4

particular patent, and we're going to have to fight

5

over that, so that the traditional reason for

6

injunctive relief, which is to bring peace, isn't

7

available in this case.

8

under these circumstances.

We're not going to have peace

9

And when you have that situation and you have

10

the kind of uncertainty, not because of business method

11

patents generally -- that's -- that's where I was I

12

think probably giving up too much immediately.

13

think the fact of a business method patent is per se a

14

problem, but I think analyzing the specific business

15

method patent and its uncertainty is a legitimate

16

consideration for the district court to take into

17

account in deciding whether or not, in a particular

18

circumstance, we are better off saying, pay the

19

plaintiff the money for the past injury, let's see how

20

the work-around develops, and take it into account, but

21

without the sort of --

2

what -- what they propose to do, and the judge says,

3

well, this is within it or it's without it.

4

it's much cheaper than a -- a new lawsuit.

5

You call the parties in and they indicate

MR. PHILLIPS:

It's --

Well, of course, the

6

consequences of the -- of the process are significantly

7

different because, obviously, the remedies for -- for

8

contempt are significantly more draconian than -- than

9

just a finding of a -- of a violation.

10

12

But more -- more important than that, Justice
Kennedy -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but this gives you

13

the advantage of coming in in advance saying, I want --

14

I -- I want a ruling in advance that I'm not going to

15

violate the injunction.

16

MR. PHILLIPS:

You've got a cheap lawsuit.
Well, and the reality is the

17

district court already looked at this and said that it

18

-- it is the district court's judgment that they're

19

going to require full infringement trials.

20

that was the finding it made with respect to the

21

balance of hardships. And -- and neither the court of

22

appeals nor the -- nor the Respondent in this case has

23

-- has challenged that particular finding.

24

reality is the district court has made the

25

determination that that's not -- that process is either

not available or not practical in the context of this

2

particular case, which of course, goes back to why it's

3

important to make sure that you look at each of these

4

cases on their individual facts rather than across the

5

board on a -- on these -- on an irrebuttable

6

presumption basis.

7

The -- the additional point that I think it's

8

important I at least spend a minute on, because the

9

Court asked for us to deal with Continental Paper Bag,

10

is that it does seem to me quite clear that, at least

11

at this stage, the parties are pretty much in sync,

12

that -- that the Court need not revisit Continental

13

Paper Bag.

14

a sort of quintessential situation where you have two

15

participants in the market, one of whom would like to

16

take advantage of a patent that will improve that

17

participant's ability to produce a product.

18

holder is not ready yet to develop that product using

19

that particular method and, therefore, sues to stop his

20

competitor from entering into that market.

21

that's the classic kind of situation where you have a

22

-- you know, where you -- where you've got the

23

potential infringer is looking at what's going on and

24

making a decision and copying it and then trying to

25

implement it.

The holding in that case is actually almost

The patent

I mean,

And the Court said, under those

20
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

circumstances, you get an injunction.

2

But here, of course, we're dealing with a

3

vastly different situation, as we -- as we point out

4

that -- in our brief, where the -- at page 9 where the

5

district court specifically found that not any of

6

eBay's success is attributable to anything in the

7

patents of the plaintiff in this case and that nothing

8

in the patents that were put forward by the plaintiff

9

in this case provide any basis on which anyone could

10

build a business model.

11

antithesis of the situation in Continental Paper Bag.

12

So this is, to my mind, the

But in any event, the holding there is

13

clearly not implicated here.

14

Congress. There's no basis for the Court to reconsider

15

it.

It's been codified by

16

To the extent that there is -- is dicta in

17

there that talks about the right to exclude, Justice

18

Scalia, I think, in general, the right to exclude is

19

one that you do, in fact, enforce with injunctive

20

relief in many cases, but the question here is whether

21

or not the Federal Circuit should have adopted a rule

22

that says you -- you enforce it in every case

23

irrebuttably as to three of the four factors, and as to

24

the fourth factor, you don't go any further than

25

requiring the plaintiff to show that there's a -- an

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

2

imminent public health crisis.
Under those circumstances, it seems to me the

3

Court should reverse the court of appeals.

4

indeed, if there were ever a case in which the Court

5

ought to uphold the district court on a -- under the

6

abuse of discretion standard, it is this case.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And,

Why should we -- if I

can get back to one of the factors.

a distinction between the -- the sole inventor who

11

and -- and somebody else?

the leverage of the normal injunction and have

13

substituted for that a duel of experts over what a

14

reasonable royalty should be?

15

MR. PHILLIPS:

Why -- why should he lose

Because the -- because

16

Congress didn't dictate that he gets that leverage in

17

every situation.

18

the -- there are going to be a lot of situations.

19

the Solicitor General's brief identifies four of them

20

in which an inventor, who doesn't plan to practice the

21

invention, engages in -- in various kinds of licensing

22

schemes that create all kinds of interrelationships

23

among the way the patent is going to be developed, and

24

I think all of those are perfectly legitimate and could

25

easily justify injunctive relief in precisely the kind

And -- and it's quite possible that

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Can I -- maybe I

don't understand what it means to practice the

invention.

that's -- you'd say that's not practicing the invention

Right.

But again, you've

licensed it and there are certain rights that,

12

obviously, arise out of the licensing.

13

factors is alone, I don't believe, sufficient to say

14

you don't get injunctive relief.

15

district court said, and I think that this is why the

16

Court ought to affirm the district court's under --

17

under an abuse of discretion standard, which never been

18

applied to this case -- what the Court should say is,

19

look, and where you have no practicing of the invention

20

by the inventor, where you have a complete willingness

21

to license not only to the world, but also to eBay

22

specifically, and where you've never sought preliminary

23

injunctive relief, under all of those -- and where --

24

and where there's serious question about the lines to

25

be drawn, there's no benefit to be had by -- in the way

1

of trying to eliminate the amount of litigation on an

2

ongoing basis, under all of those circumstances, all of

3

which the district court identified, then it's not

4

appropriate to grant injunctive relief. We'll allow

5

enhanced damages in the interim and even the potential

6

down the road, obviously, of -- of an injunction to

7

serve as enough of a deterrent to protect the right to

8

exclude that the plaintiff has under the statute.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

that -- that you're not practicing the invention make a

difference?

licensed it with a royalty based upon the number of

sales of engines?

21

-- why does one situation justify an injunction more

22

than the other?

23

I mean, they're both risking, you

Why

Yes, I think -- I think I

ought to modify it slightly because it's not just

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY P. MINEAR

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT

MR. MINEAR:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
The United States submits that the right to a

4

patent is an important matter, but it must be

5

considered in the context of the remedies as well.

6

And the United States further submits the

7

patentee's right to an injunction should be covered by

8

the familiar four-factor test this Court has applied in

9

cases such as Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo.

This

10

Court's express endorsement of the four-factor test

11

would provide disciplined guidance and a framework for

12

the lower courts to evaluate whether or not a patent

13

should issue in any particular case.

14

The court of appeals in this case did not

15

make express reference to the four-factor test.

16

Nevertheless, it did identify the difficulties with the

17

-- the district court's decisions.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You don't think Mr.

19

-- you don't think Judge Bryson forgot about the four-

20

factor test, do you?

21

MR. MINEAR:

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Absolutely not.
Sure.

And -- and he

was just reflecting the reality that in a typical case,

24

this is what happens.

25

to do is edit his opinion and stick in this formulaic

2

are.

3

MR. MINEAR:

Not exactly, Your Honor.

We

4

think that there is some legitimate confusion among the

5

patent bar and in the community about whether or not

6

this test issues nearly automatically or not.

7

Certainly there are many amicus briefs on both sides.

8

And we think it's useful for this Court to make clear

9

that this is an exercise of equitable discretion.

10

Now, Judge Bryson, I think, was aware of the

11

four-factor test.

12

four-factor test before the district court.

13

In fact, both parties cited the

He was also aware of the abuse of discretion

14

standard.

15

parties cited that standard to the Federal Circuit in

16

the course of briefing this case below.

17

That's a well-established standard and the

But what we think this Court can do is it can

18

provide guidance on how those factors are applied in

19

the patent context in this very important area.

We

think the court of appeals decision is correct.

The

21

judgment is correct.

22

benefit to this Court explaining why that is so, and

23

I'd like to --

25

But we think that there's some

one factor in particular?

Can I ask you about

What if by the time you get

an injunction?

It's not final.

MR. MINEAR:

Can the district

you're referring to the reexamination process

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

MR. MINEAR:

-- that, in fact, is ongoing in

10

this case.

11

Trademark Office's office action is not sufficient.

12

this case, if I can speak outside the record, there has

13

been what is called a first office action and a second

14

office action, but no final action by the PTO.

15

even if there was final action by the PTO, that would

16

still be subject to review by an administrative body,

17

the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences, and

18

there would be further judicial review.

But I would like to talk about the four

16

individual factors in this case because I think it

17

provides helpful guidance in the resolution of the

18

dispute before the Court.

19

As an initial matter, with regard to

20

irreparable injury, patent infringement normally will

21

result in irreparable injury because it denies the

22

patent holder its statutory right to exclude others

23

from practicing the invention.

24

that is susceptible to irreparable injury because --

25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It's the type of right

But it denies the right

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1

subject to being a damage remedy that's available.

2

MR. MINEAR:

That's correct, but the

3

difficulty here is the pragmatic question of whether

4

the district court can determine whether damages are

5

appropriate or not in a particular case.

6

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Is it always -- is it

7

always going to be irreparable injury if the patentee

8

always gets fairly compensated?

9

MR. MINEAR:

No.

There -- we certainly

10

recognize there can be cases where there would not be

11

irreparable --

12

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So if there are some cases

13

when he gets fairly compensated and some he does not,

14

why should you say it's always irreparable injury?

15

MR. MINEAR:

Well, my -- our position is not

16

that it's always, but that it normally is irreparable

17

injury.

18

circumstances we can envision where it would not be

19

irreparable injury.

20
21
22

It usually will be.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And there are certainly

Is that usually will be

because usually damages are not an adequate remedy?
MR. MINEAR:

Yes, that's correct.

And the

23

reason why damages are not an adequate remedy is

24

because, as Judge Easterbrook indicated, it's very

25

difficult for the district court, looking forward, to

31
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

determine what business opportunities are available to

2

the -- to the licensor or the practitioner in the face

3

of the prospect of continuing infringement.

4

is why, as Judge Easterbrook noted in the Catheter

5

case, the injunction harnesses the market to determine

6

what the market value of that patent is.

negotiation between the parties, as compared to the

court acting to try and develop a reasonable royalty

JUSTICE SCALIA:

When you say going forward,

11

I thought we were talking about damages for the past

12

violation, not damages for future violations which will

13

continue.

14
15
16

Are we talking about that too?
MR. MINEAR:

Yes, that's what we're talking

about.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

About the court effectively

17

saying, yes, here pay him and -- and go on and skip

18

away and continue violating it.

MR. MINEAR:

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, when a district court -In this case, they -- they

21

claim not to want to violate it in the future.

22

just talking about, you know, the -- the past actions

23

should -- should be compensable by damages and not --

24

they should not be subjected to a very threatening

MR. MINEAR:

Yes, but in this case the

2

district court has awarded the damages for the past --

3

past actions already, and the question is how will we

4

deal with the threat of continuing infringement.

5

the difficulty that the district court faces here is it

6

has to, if it takes no action, as it's done now, it

7

will at some later date have to go back and determine

8

what those damages would be.

MR. MINEAR:

We are suggesting what Justice

19

Kennedy suggested; namely, that the injunction

20

proceedings provide an opportunity to determine whether

21

or not the supposed work-around that eBay has will work

allow it or not, depending on whether or not it's

Is there a classic case

where the injunction should not be issued?
MR. MINEAR:

Yes.

There -- I think there --

this is a four-factor test, and there are questions of

balance of hardship and public interest.

11

equity should be cautious not to inflict unnecessary

12

hardship on parties.

13

infringer, for instance, that has made good faith

investments that might be set aside by the -- by an

safety, undermine core aspects of commerce --

Suppose -I'm curious about

of a particular patent by denying the injunction simply

because the people who infringed it weren't willful,

and I wonder why that makes sense.

10

MR. MINEAR:

You're devaluing the value

We're not suggesting that

automatically that there is withhold with relief

12

because of a nonwillful infringement.

13

drawing the -- the distinction between a case, such as

14

this, where there is willful infringement -- and, in

15

fact, the party has been found to have both had notice

16

of the patent and also have known that it did not --

17

did not have a reasonable basis for concluding it was

not infringing or the patent was invalid.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why is it your bottom line

2

then, send it back with your four-factor test, because

3

there seems to be some uncertainty whether that was

4

applied?

5

MR. MINEAR:

We don't think that's

6

appropriate because, first of all, the -- the court of

7

appeals did identify the factors the district court

8

relied on that weighed on -- it thought weighed on

9

eBay's side of the balance, and it properly rejected

10
11

each one of those.
But furthermore, we think that this Court's

12

enunciation of the tests and the application of the

13

tests, much as it did in the patent case of Pfaff v.

14

Wells Electronics 3 years ago, could provide very

15

useful guidance in terms of how this test applies in a

16

specific, concrete context.

17

But the factors that the court of appeals

18

relied on here and rejected, found insufficient were

19

really quite right.

20

an automatic distinction between a party that practices

21

the patent and one that licenses it.

22

First of all, there should not be

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

10

MR. WAXMAN:
please the Court:

11
12

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

I -- I can anticipate at least one question.
Let me just say at the outset --

13

(Laughter.)

14

MR. WAXMAN:

-- that long, perhaps centuries,

15

before Justice Story ever wrote his commentaries on

16

equity, it has been firmly, unequivocally established

17

that a final judgment, not -- we're not talking about

18

an interlocutory order, but a final judgment of patent

19

infringement yields an injunction in all but the very

20

rare case.

21

to traditional equitable principles.

22

application of those principles.

23

And that settled regime is not an exception
It's an

Equity, as this Court has reminded us over

24

and over again, including in the Weinberger and the

25

Amoco cases -- equity first takes account of the nature

37
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

of both the right at stake and the violation.

2

because the only right that a patent provides under

3

U.S. law is a limited-term right to exclude others from

4

practicing the invention, infringement produces an

5

injury that is both, A, irreparable by its nature and,

6

B, continuing in the nature of a continuing trespass to

7

chattels.

8

showing of either of those things, either irreparable

9

injury or a continuing harm, warrants an injunction in

That is the

evidence, that eBay had willfully infringed the '265

16

patent, that it knew about it, and it had no good faith

17

belief either that the patent was invalid or that it

18

was not infringing.

19

either of those things, it could not find willfulness,

20

and it found willfulness by clear and convincing

21

evidence.

22

The jury found, by clear and convincing

The jury was told that if it found

Washington, DC 20005

1

that is correct, Mr. Chief Justice, with the following

2

clarification, that the office action, as Mr. Minear

3

has indicated, represents a -- an initial judgment by a

4

staff member in the office.

5

And what -- what is quite -- and it is --

6

doesn't represent even the PTO's final judgment in the

7

case, but what is really revealing here is that

8

reexamination is a process that was invoked by eBay.

9

And as we point out in our brief, typically if a

10

competitor is concerned or doubts the validity of a

11

patent, it will invoke reexamination, ask the PTO to

12

reexamine it when it first learns about it.

MR. WAXMAN:

I think that -- the case that

2

the U.S. cites in its footnote is an example where

3

reexamination processes are underway when the case is

4

first filed or when it's pending in the district court,

5

and the district judge certainly has the discretion to

6

say, I don't want to get into a -- a fight here about

7

separation of powers and Hayburns case.

8

reexam proceed, and then we'll have a trial.

9

Let's let the

In this case, eBay waited not only until it

10

was sued and not only until it was found to have

11

willfully infringed this patent, but in the middle of

12

the appeals process.

13

rule that would allow a district judge now to give

14

notice of that in denying an injunction would basically

15

be a -- an open invitation for everybody to go ahead

16

and try and win at trial, go through the whole multi

17

year process, and if you don't, just put it into

18

reexam.

19

to be -- is required to proceed with, quote, special

20

dispatch under the statute, this reexamination of the

22

23

It then comes running in and a

This -- although the reexamination is required

So we think, in the circumstances of this

24

case, where the district judge had no reason to

25

consider reexam because eBay hadn't invoked reexam at

40
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

the time, it would be an abuse of discretion for the

2

court to either refuse an injunction or stay it in

3

light of the fact that it's now proceeding.

4

But that's not an issue for this Court.

5

wasn't an issue for the court of appeals because it

6

wasn't part of the district judge's analysis of the

7

requisite equitable factors.

8
9

And what -- if I can just get back to the
facts of this particular case and then talk about the

10

law.

11

disables eBay from invoking the relative balance of

12

harms.

13
14

It

The finding of eBay's willfulness in this case

We certainly agree -JUSTICE BREYER:

Why?

I mean, I think there

are so many factors that could enter into it.

15

MR. WAXMAN:

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well -What I was going to ask was

17

if you have a -- a patentee that does only license and,

18

moreover, licenses only to people who, by and large,

19

will not take that product and develop it further, then

20

it's fairly easy to calculate damages.

21

Now, couple that with a client or a patentee

22

who also waits for a long time, waits till the

23

invention is embedded in a series of other inventions

24

so that if, in fact, there's an injunction, what will

25

happen is that the patentee will be able to extract far

41

2

the infringer would have to give up the entire

invention.

And the common law and equitable principles

way back, that when you -- when you're talking about

-- I'm not talking about the public interest, but I

14

mean private harms, when you have an adjudicated,

The district court decision in this case is the first

case in the context of a permanent injunction.

I'll explain why preliminary injunctions that seek to

4

preserve the status quo are different.

5

first permanent injunction case I'm aware of that has

6

ever thought that exploiting the patent by licensing it

to others to make use of would in -- somehow be costly

10

This is the

Section -- section 284, which is the damages

provision, talks about remedies, remedies for

12

infringement that has already occurred.

13

And

The text of section 283 says -- the other

14

side keeps referring to may, may, may not, shall.

15

That's fine.

16

operative word in 283 is to prevent.

17

is an instance in which the patent has expired, the --

18

the infringer is out of business and can show that it

19

couldn't possibly infringe anymore, an injunction

21

But the purpose of it is to prevent.

JUSTICE BREYER:

On that very point, my

question there really was -- that was the heart of it

-- that I don't think there's a moral or even patent-

related value attached to whether you practice it

25

yourself or not.

It's just that when you license it,

Well -But it's easier to calculate

Now, at least in some subset of cases.

So if you have a case where, on the one hand,

6

it's easier to calculate the damage remedy, and at the

7

same time you fear that to issue an injunction will

8

produce a harm to the other side way out of proportion

9

to, in fact, the value that's being lost by infringing

10

on the patent, then those are two things you'd put in

11

the balance.

an injunction are appealable, and the Federal Circuit

requirements.

12

But in the -- in the context of this case, it

is so critical that the judgment be affirmed, not

will have to be changed because the court of appeals

invalidated the '176 patent, which the jury found had

Justice Stevens, with respect to the place in

whole thing, but it starts off with anything directly

or indirectly, and it goes on for three pages.

injunction.

That's the proposed

It is,

The -- I think it's important, after Mr.

8

Waxman's challenge to the conduct of eBay in this case,

9

to -- to recognize that willfulness in the patent

10

context has a meaning different from willfulness in any

11

other context.

12

about simply a failure to satisfy a duty to check out

13

and find a lawyer's opinion that a particular

14

infringement has not taken place or that the patent is

15

not valid.

the risk that you will also waive your attorney-client

17

privilege.

willfulness that we're talking about here.

And it is recognized that we're talking

And that's the

With respect to the notion of stealing this

20

patent, let's go back to what the district court

21

specifically held on page 68 of the appendix.

22

the defendants maintain that their success did not

23

arise from the use of anything contained in the

24

plaintiff's patents and the defendants argued that the

25

patents offered no business or engineering guidance

which the defendants could copy, and this court agrees

2

with that.

3

willfulness -- it's the reason why the court didn't

4

grant enhanced damages.

5

didn't grant attorney's fees in this particular case,

6

and it doesn't provide a reason for simply jettisoning

7

three out of the four factors that ought to be applied

8

in the traditional -- in the traditional test.

9

That's not the kind of bad faith or

It's the reason why the court

And, Justice Breyer, you asked the question,

10

what are you going to do with a situation where you

11

have the embedded patent and you have the case like

12

this one where we're going along with our process and

13

we've got our source code and we've done all of the

14

hard work, and they go along and come up with some sort

15

of more vague idea and show up at our doorstep and,

16

one, claim that we've got to stop doing what we're

17

doing, or, worse in other cases, we're going to find

situations where it's embedded in a manufacturing
