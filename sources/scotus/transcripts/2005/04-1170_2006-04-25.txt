ORAL ARGUMENT OF PHILL KLINE

7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

MR. KLINE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

This Court has never held that a specific

11

method of weighing aggravating and mitigating evidence

12

is required, yet in its individualized sentencing line

13

of cases this Court has consistently said that all the

14

Eighth Amendment requires is that a juror consider and

15

give effect to all relevant mitigating evidence.

16

pages 23 through 28 of your appendix, you will find

17

the Kansas jury instructions and Kansas law clearly,

18

on four occasions, instruct individual jurors that they

19

must individually consider all mitigating evidence that

20

they find.

21

five different methods in which they can give that

22

mitigating evidence the effect of a life sentence, and

23

only one manner in which, acting unanimously and after

24

the State has met the highest burden allowed by law in

25

three separate measurements, beyond a reasonable doubt

In

Furthermore, the jurors are instructed in

demonstrated that the death sentence is appropriate.

2

Specifically, instruction number 4, paragraph

3

2 on page 24 of the joint appendix, will show the

4

jurors are instructed that mercy, in and of itself, is

5

a mitigating piece of evidence, and later, in the

6

instruction that lays out the mitigating evidence

7

presented in this specific case, they are told, in

8

paragraph 18 on page 26 of your joint appendix, that

9

mercy, by itself, can be sufficient to warrant a

10

sentence other than death.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

12

instruction is that?

13

MR. KLINE:

I -- I'm sorry, what

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, you began by saying

that there's three different measures, I think -- I

think was the word you used.

me through that.

14

MR. KLINE:

Certainly.

First of all, the

jury unanimity, that the defendant is guilty of capital

-- phase 5.
-- capital murder includes,

in this case -MR. KLINE:

case, that the homicide involved more than one person

Involved more than one

Then, second?
MR. KLINE:

Then we go to the sentencing

5

phase, in which the State has to prove one of eight

6

statutorily defined aggravating factors beyond a

7

reasonable doubt with jury unanimity.

8

specific aggravating factors that were found by the

9

jury in this instance.

There were three

introduction is relevancy.

12

case, which has a functionally identical provision that

13

is at issue here, the State maintains the burden,

14

while, in Walton, the burden was provided to the

15

defendant to demonstrate that the mitigating factors

16

were so substantial to call for leniency.

17

But, unlike the Walton

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You had to prove, beyond a

18

reasonable doubt, the mitigating factors do not

19

outweigh the aggravating factors that have already been

20

established.

21

MR. KLINE:

22

found in instruction number 10.

23

this process, you see that the Kansas death-penalty law

24

has a default to life in virtually every stage of the

25

prosecution of the case.

That is correct.

And that is

And as we go through

And then, instruction number

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

10 is a determination by the legislature consistent

with this Court's precedent, because we have narrowed

consistent with Furman and the concern for guided

5

discretion.

in the transcript of the sentencing phase, on page 66,

jury in closing, "The practical fact is that each of

you will decide whether or not you believe death is the

15

appropriate sentence.

16

mitigators outweigh the aggravators."

And if you decide that death is

20

beyond a reasonable doubt that the mitigators do not

the jury on how they can give the --

of cut through -- is it a correct interpretation of the

2

instructions, as a whole, to say, in effect, "If you

3

find the aggravating and mitigating circumstances are

4

equally balanced, you shall impose the death sentence"?

5

MR. KLINE:

If a juror finds -- that is

6

correct, Justice Stevens -- if the juror's decided

7

conclusion and reasoned moral judgment is that the

8

mitigating factors and the aggravating factors are in

9

balance, and finds that beyond a reasonable doubt,

10

instruction number 10 clearly indicates that death is

11

the appropriate sentence.

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So, it -The difficulty I have is in

13

the phrase that you have mentioned in the course of

14

your argument a couple of times referring to the

15

"reasoned moral response."

16

in squaring "reasoned moral response" with the

17

construction that the Kansas Court and we all agree is

18

the proper construction of the -- of the -- of the

19

equipoise kind of provision, is this.

20

right, as I understand it, to define what it regards as

21

the aggravating circumstances, those that support a

22

death verdict.

23

saying that if a jury cannot find that the aggravators,

24

as we've defined them, outweigh the mitigators -- i.e.,

25

if the jury is in equipoise -- the result must be

And the difficulty I have

Kansas has a

2

moral response.

3

response would be: the death penalty should be imposed

4

because the aggravators do outweigh -- i.e., it's not

5

equipoise -- the aggravators are heavier.

6

Kansas is saying, "Even though they're not, death is

7

the result, anyway," it doesn't seem like a reasoned

8

moral response.

9

And that does not seem to be a reasoned
I'm assuming that a reasoned moral

What is your answer to that?

MR. KLINE:

Justice Souter, of course the

10

State believes that it is.

11

consistent with this Court's precedent as what is

12

required --

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

14

MR. KLINE:

It is, first of all,

Well, that's the issue.

And in the -- in the Walton case,

15

this Court found that a functionally identical

16

provision in Arizona, even though the burden remained

17

on the defendant, was appropriate after the State had

18

met the requirements of guided discretion, as well as

19

the individualized sentencing requirement, in setting

20

about a -- proving that, "This defendant is more

21

deserving of death than anybody else convicted of the

22

same crime."

23

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But here we have, it seems

24

to me, to be a stark finding that it has not been

25

proven.

That is what "equipoise" means.

If

We cannot make that conclusion.

5

reasoned moral response -- "We're on the fence, but

6

execute anyway" -- seems a total inconsistency.

We're right on the

MR. KLINE:

The State maintains, Justice

8

Souter, that the decision that the mitigating factors

9

do not outweigh the aggravating factors is a decision,

10

and it is a --

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But it's a decision that

12

says, "We don't know what should be done."

13

aggravators define the basis for execution, and

14

mitigators define the basis for life, the equipoise

15

verdict says, in so many words, "We don't know which is

16

more important."

17

back and says, "We don't know," that the result should

18

be death.

19

with the notion of a reasoned moral response.

20

If

And Kansas says, when the jury comes

And that is what seems to me inconsistent

MR. KLINE:

The distinction, Justice Souter,

21

that I believe, from your analogy, is that the Kansas

22

Legislature has said they do know, and that death is

23

appropriate once a defendant has been found guilty of

24

capital murder, in a very narrow definition.

It is a fact, in effect,

The fact that you know, here, is that

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Do we know that as a

fact?
MR. KLINE:

Justice Roberts, I believe that

11

there are a couple of things which might help

12

illuminate a little bit more what the jury faces in

13

this instance.

14

First of all, the statement --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Do we have a return

15

of a verdict saying, "We find these factors in

16

equipoise"?

17

MR. KLINE:

There is a verdict form that

18

requires the jury, with unanimity, if the sentence is

19

death, to indicate that the State has met the burden

20

beyond a reasonable doubt of demonstrating --

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So, what we have is a

22

situation where this is a theoretical possibility under

23

the statute.

24

MR. KLINE:

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Correct.
Not a situation where

12
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1

this is what the jury has said.

2

MR. KLINE:

3

fashion.

4
5

The jury does not find in that

JUSTICE SOUTER:

That's right.

We don't --

we don't know whether that was the case here or not.

6

MR. KLINE:

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

How -As I understand it, our

8

question is, if a jury could return the death verdict

9

in the equipoise situation, as the Kansas Supreme Court

10

has defined it, is that -- is that statute allowing for

11

that possibility constitutional?

12

MR. KLINE:

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

14

MR. KLINE:

15

Isn't that --

That is the issue, just -Yes.

-- as it was in Walton, which had

--

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

17

MR. KLINE:

Yes.

-- a functionally identical

18

provision that required that the defendant demonstrate

19

that there were mitigating factors substantial enough

20

to call for leniency, which --

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We're not talking,

22

just -- we're not talking about a numerical equipoise.

23

I -- there's three aggravators and three mitigators,

24

in equipoise.

25

jurors can give what weight they think is appropriate

And the -- presumably, the individual

13
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

1

to the mitigating factors.

2

aggravators met, and say, "Well, I still think, under

3

factor 18, that mercy ought to outweigh death."

4

MR. KLINE:

They can find all three

That is correct, Justice Roberts.

5

And, in fact, they are informed that it is not a

6

numerical equation.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But is it -- is it like in

8

a -- in a -- take a civil case where the judge gives

9

the standard charge about, "Imagine two plates and a

10

scale, and if they are in equipoise, then you find

11

against the party who has the burden of proof" -- if we

12

make that comparison, then it's pretty clear that the

13

burden of proof is on the defendant if the answer is --

14

to the equipoise question is, "Then you must come in

15

with a death verdict."

16

MR. KLINE:

Justice Ginsburg, unlike in

17

Arizona, there is a specific instruction to the jury

18

that they must decide beyond a reasonable doubt that

19

the mitigating factors do not outweigh the aggravating

20

factors before the death sentence is imposed.

21

is analogous to instructing the jury on how to give the

22

effect they desire to the mitigating and aggravating

23

factors that have been presented.

24

agree that we would have a constitutional issue if it

25

was similar to instructing a jury, "You either mark

And it

I would possibly

14
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

blue or red on the jury verdict form, and we will not

2

tell you the effect of that decision."

3

instruction clearly lets them know that a decision

4

beyond a reasonable doubt that the State has met its

5

burden, that the mitigators do not outweigh the

6

aggravating factors, that the effect is death.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

However, this

And --

Is there a difference in the

8

moral burden on the jurors, or the psychological burden

9

on the jurors, in the situation where they have to find

10

that the aggravators outweigh the mitigators, and,

11

therefore, make an affirmative finding that leads to

12

the sentence of death, as opposed to the situation

13

where they can say, "We can't decide, under the

14

applicable burden of proof, which side is weightier,"

15

and, therefore, they allow a default rule to dictate

16

what the sentence is going to be?

17

MR. KLINE:

Justice Alito, I do not believe

18

that that is what occurs, because, indecision, under

19

Kansas law, is clearly indicative of a life sentence.

20

In fact, if the jury does not, with unanimity, come

21

together and make an affirmative decision, and indicate

22

such on the verdict form within a reasonable time, they

23

are told and instructed, "the judge shall dismiss the

24

jury."

25

And the State's -JUSTICE ALITO:

No, but if they find -- if

15
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

they agree, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the

2

aggravators and the mitigators are in equipoise, then

3

they allow the default rule to dictate the sentence of

4

death.

5

Isn't that right?
MR. KLINE:

That is correct, at some point.

6

I wouldn't term it a "default rule" in every statutory

7

scheme involving the death penalty.

8

in time when the jury is informed that the result of

9

their deliberations is a death sentence.

There is a point

So, you can

10

call something a default rule in virtually any State.

11

And, in fact, relying on the Walton decision, many

12

States have functionally identical statutes to Kansas,

13

and courts have interpreted the Walton decision as

14

resolving this issue.

15

Circuit said that the issue of the potential, the

16

hypothetical, of equipoise was resolved in Walton.

17

Furthermore, the Idaho -- the Seventh Circuit, relating

18

to the Idaho scheme relating to the death penalty,

19

found that this Court resolved the issue in Walton, as

20

did the Illinois Court.

No, but if the law says,

that the death sentence will be warranted."

fellow.

16

Kansas law prescribes is that when they're in

finding of guilt to an aggravated murder is the preface

to a determination as to whether aggravators or

determination, there will be a decision as to whether

5

the sentence should be death or life.

MR. KLINE:

The first determination that a

proven, beyond a reasonable doubt, guilty of capital

should be life or death.

MR. KLINE:

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And --- what I'm -- what I'm --

3

what I'm getting at is, I don't -- I -- as I understand

4

the Kansas scheme, the determination of guilt, to

5

aggravated murder, does not create a presumption in

6

favor of the death penalty.

7

MR. KLINE:

JUSTICE SOUTER:

11

No, the -Okay.

-- that is correct.

That is

There are several steps.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

It depends on what you mean

12

by a "presumption."

13

that unless you find something that outweighs this, the

14

death penalty is the proper penalty.

It certainly -- it certainly says

15

MR. KLINE:

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Justice Scalia -The burden is on the jury to

17

find something to outweigh it.

18

a finding of something that outweighs it, when these

19

aggravators are found, the death penalty is the proper

20

penalty.

21

MR. KLINE:

And, in the absence of

Justice Scalia, that is correct.

22

Once the State has met the burden of proving that one

23

of the eight statutory aggravators is present --

24

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Right.

But the fact of --

let me -- I think we've got a terminological problem --

23
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

the fact that there has been a finding of guilt of

2

aggravated murder is not tantamount, as I understand

3

it, to a finding that aggravating factors to be

4

considered at the penalty phase have also been found.

5

Is that --

JUSTICE SOUTER:

MR. KLINE:

And as it

14

relates to the "give effect" language, the cases that

15

this Court has considered regarding that are

16

dramatically different.

17

Penry cases and other cases, the concern was, the jury

18

was affirmatively instructed that they could not use

19

evidence that was introduced and relevant in a manner

20

which would lead to mitigation, such as the defendant's

21

youthfulness.

22

said that they could only utilize that evidence to

23

determine whether there was a likelihood of re-offense.

And this Court reasoned that it is possible to look at

25

youthfulness as mitigating factor which diminishes the

that goes to your response to Justice Souter's last

question?

understanding is wrong, once they have found the

existence of those aggravating factors that justify the

15

death penalty, and then you move into the penalty phase

16

for them to decide whether, in fact, the death penalty

17

would be imposed, it's not up to them to -- they can't

eliminate one of those aggravating factors that has

been found.

aggravating factors that have been found.

right?

22

As I understand the scheme, maybe my

They have to take into account all of the

MR. KLINE:

Isn't that

That's correct, Justice Scalia.

23

I think the confusion is the use of the term

24

"aggravated murder," which would be not quite correct

25

under Kansas law.

There is a statutory requirement of

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

a finding of guilt of capital murder, and that is in

very narrow circumstances.

capital murder.

Kansas has one of the most

Once that is achieved, then the

jurors are instructed to give way to a consideration to

10

all aggravating factors that they find, with unanimity,

11

to exist, and to consider all mitigating evidence which

12

they find, individually, to exist, with the only burden

13

on the defendant being relevancy for introduction.

14

then, they are instructed to consider whether the State

15

has proven, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the

mitigating factors do not outweigh the aggravating

factors.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF REBECCA E. WOODMAN

24

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

25

And

MS. WOODMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

Alderson Reporting Company

2

please the Court:
Since the argument of the attorney general

3

was addressed exclusively to the question of the

4

constitutionality of the Kansas statute, I will devote

5

all of my argument to that subject, as well, although I

6

am sure that the Court, in deliberations, will be

7

considering the several jurisdictional issues which

8

were briefed and argued earlier in the term.

9

there are no questions on those jurisdictional issues,

10
11

And if

I will proceed to the merits.
To pick up on some of the things that were

12

said during Attorney General Kline's argument, the

13

Eighth Amendment requires reliability in the

14

determination that death is an appropriate sentence.

15

And at the selection stage, the question is whether the

16

jury has made a reliable, collective, responsible

17

decision based upon the unique circumstances of the

18

individual defendant that death is an appropriate

19

sentence and that this defendant is particularly

20

culpable in a way that distinguishes him from the mass

21

of death-eligible defendants.

22

equipoise provision here, which the State agrees can

23

occur under the Kansas statute, is that we don't know

24

from a death verdict pronounced by a jury in Kansas

25

whether the jury did decree death by equipoise or not.

And the problem with the

27
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Death sentences must be rationally reviewable.

2

when we look at the -- at a death sentence that's been

3

pronounced in Kansas, we can't determine whether the

4

jury decreed death by equipoise.

13

And we know --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MS. WOODMAN:

We know that.

Yes.

10

12

We are confident that the

jury found aggravating factors.

7

And

-- that they found them

Yes.

The jury did find an

aggravating factor beyond --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

17

MS. WOODMAN:

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And we know --

-- a reasonable --- we --

-- doubt.
-- and we know that they

19

found that the defendant had not shown that mitigating

20

factors outweighed those aggravating factors.

21

MS. WOODMAN:

That's right.

But the Kansas

22

Supreme Court, in the Kleypas case, examined the Kansas

23

statute -- which, by the way, is unique to Kansas; no

24

other State in the country has a statute like this, and

25

this will affect no State outside of Kansas -- they

28
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

examined this statute in great detail, and they --

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You disagree from your --

with your friend on the other side on that point.

4

MS. WOODMAN:

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Whether it's unique?
How can we check on that?

6

No, he said that a number of other State statutes would

7

be affected by our coming out the way you would like

8

us, on this.

9

MS. WOODMAN:

I don't see how, because --

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

11

MS. WOODMAN:

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Because he said --

-- Kansas --- he said it would change

13

Walton, and that would impair those other State

14

statutes.

15
16

MS. WOODMAN:

As we argue in our brief,

Walton simply did not speak to this --

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

18

MS. WOODMAN:

Yes.

-- issue.

And, in fact, the

19

Arizona Supreme Court, in Walton, interpreted the

20

Arizona statute to require that aggravators outweigh

21

mitigators.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't mean to

23

interrupt your argument, but presumably the attorney

24

general will tell us, in his rebuttal.

25

MS. WOODMAN:

Sure.

And the Montana statute,

29
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

which reads precisely the way Arizona's is, they've

2

decided the equipoise issue and said that the language

3

of that statute does not mandate death by equipoise.

4

So, those statutes are distinguishable, and there's

5

simply no other State that has a statute which mandates

6

death by equipoise.

7

In any event, the Kansas Supreme Court did

8

interpret the statute to contain a mandatory death-by

9

equipoise provision, which the State's question

10

presented assumes is the case.

11

with the way the statute has operated, and is likely to

12

operate it in Kansas, found that equipoise can happen,

13

and that it risks unreliability in capital sentencing

14

in a way that's forbidden by the Eighth Amendment.

15

I think one of the problems here is that the

16

terminology of "weighing" conveys a false impression of

17

predefined weights.

18

that that's not how juries consider the balancing of

19

aggravating and mitigating circumstances.

20

with that.

21

of a scale, or a football field, where you move it

beyond the 50-yardline, whatever visual metaphor you

want, and you weigh, you balance where the scales of

justice balances, it seems to me that that's a stronger

15

case than saying the jurors can establish their

aggravation, then they can take any mitigating factor

17

they want, for any reason, and apply it.

18

can't do that, because the defendant hasn't shown it.

argument than if you had this balancing mechanism that

was our controlling metaphor.

If you want to give us this visual metaphor

MS. WOODMAN:

that equipoise can happen under the Kansas statute --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

They've decided -And what they're deciding

is that there's no mitigating circumstances to outweigh

10

MS. WOODMAN:

What they've decided is that,

together, they can't determine, one way or the other,

whether aggravators outweigh mitigators or mitigators --

But how realistic is

17

that as a possibility when you're talking about

abstract concepts as mitigating factors, like how much

mercy should be shown?

there's any juror who's going to say, "All right, I'm

JUSTICE ALITO:

Would it be constitutional if

the Kansas statute said that, "The jury must find, by a

preponderance, that the aggravating factors outweigh

11

MS. WOODMAN:

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yes.
And wouldn't a defendant be

better off under the current Kansas statute than under

a statute like that, where, under the current statute,

15

the jury has to find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that

the aggravating factors and the mitigating factors are

at least in equipoise?

18

MS. WOODMAN:

Well, the jury does have to

find equipoise beyond a reasonable doubt.

remains that the jury is making that decision of

equipoise, which requires the death sentence, without

Absolutely not, because they're

not making the decision that's required at the

And to follow up on something that General

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And you think that a juror

15

who believes that this person shouldn't be -- shouldn't

be sent to death -- that is to say, who believes that

that in either of -- either of the two cases I've --

jurors are following their instructions, and, in either

of these situations, the defendant is being sentenced
