ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

10

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
Before Oregon became the first State to

11

authorize assisted suicide, the prescription of federally

12

controlled substances to facilitate suicide generally

13

violated State law and also violated Federal law.

14

Respondents contend that Oregon's decision to remove the

15

State-law consequences from that conduct also operated to

16

remove the Federal-law consequences.

17

JUSTICE STEVENS:

18
19

May I ask, what Federal law

does it violate?
GENERAL CLEMENT:

It violated the Controlled

20

Substances Act.

21

before Oregon acted, for example, that the fact that a

22

doctor prescribed controlled substances for purposes of a

23

suicide was a basis for revoking his license.

24
25

And the D.A. had taken the position,

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, now, would that be true

also for any doctor who provided the substances to furnish

an execution of a convicted death penalty convict?
GENERAL CLEMENT:

No, Justice O'Connor, the

3

death penalty situation, lethal injection, is different,

4

for a number of reasons.

5

taken a position of non-enforcement in that context, which

6

would be protected by this Court's decision in Heckler

7

against Cheney.

8
9
10

Of course, the D.A. has long

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

But, otherwise, it would be

the same reasoning -GENERAL CLEMENT:

I don't think it would,

11

Justice O'Connor, at least not since 1994, because in 1994

12

Congress passed a statute that I think is best read as

13

ratifying the practice of lethal injection.

14

U.S.C. 3596.

15

Government to use the method of execution in the State of

16

the sentencing court.

17

1994, the overwhelming majority -- something like 25 of

18

the 38 States -- had already used lethal injection.

19

would read that as --

This is 18

And that statute authorizes the Federal

And at the time that was passed, in

20

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

21

GENERAL CLEMENT:

22

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

So, I

But would it be open --- a ratification --- to the Attorney General to

23

pass a regulation like this one, and all of a sudden apply

24

it -- some new Attorney General, who had a very different

25

view of the death penalty?

4
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

GENERAL CLEMENT:

No, I don't think so, Justice

2

O'Connor, and I think the reason is, at a minimum, 18

3

U.S.C. 3596, because I think that would now stand as an

4

obstacle to that type of regulatory impression --

5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

6

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

7
8
9

Does the -Well, not if it just refers

back to the States, would it?
GENERAL CLEMENT:

No, but this is a provision

that dictates how the Federal Government shall do its

10

executions.

11

effectively ratified the practice of using lethal

12

injection.

13

And I think, at that time, in 1994, it

I --

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Does the statute -- does the

14

Federal statute specifically authorize doctors to do this?

15

Or does it simply say that convicts may be executed by

16

lethal injection?

17

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, the statute itself says

18

that the Federal Government shall use the method in the

19

State in which the sentencing court sits, the Federal

20

sentencing court.

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but the method may simply

22

be lethal injection.

23

O'Connor's question, it might still be the case that, on

24

the theory the Government is advancing this morning, it

25

would be unlawful for a doctor to engage in that, because

And, going back to Justice

5
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

that was, in fact, not within the limits of the practice

2

of medicine, the doctor was using a controlled substance

3

for something outside the practice of medicine, and hence,

4

it would be illegal.

5

GENERAL CLEMENT:

And again, Justice Souter, I

6

think the best reading is, that is now foreclosed -- that

7

interpretation would be foreclosed by Congress's action in

8

1994.

9

There are also some technical differences -JUSTICE SOUTER:

But I take it Congress did not

10

refer specifically to -- or did not include a specific

11

authorization of doctors, so that we'd have to do a little

12

construction to get to your point.

13

GENERAL CLEMENT:

I think we would have to do a

14

little construction, in fairness, but I do think -- I

15

mean, and there also are some differences, because, for

16

example, as I understand the practice in most States,

17

doctors actually aren't exactly involved in the specific

18

process of administering the lethal injection.

19

also a technical difference, which is, with respect to

20

lethal injection, it's not the federally controlled

21

substance which is the lethal agent.

22

there's a federally controlled substance that's used to

23

administer -- to relieve pain in conjunction with a

24

different injection that's not -- that does not involve a

25

federally controlled substance.

There's

It's just that

And that's actually the

6
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

lethal agent.

2

Here, of course, it's --

JUSTICE BREYER:

In your view, were it not for

3

the statute, the Federal statute, your view of the

4

Attorney General's authority is -- leaving that statute

5

aside, if it weren't there -- the Attorney General, should

6

we have an Attorney General who is opposed to the death

7

penalty, could, in fact, regulate or stop Federal -- State

8

death penalties, through this same mechanism, by saying

9

that no physician can be registered insofar as he engages

10
11

in that.
GENERAL CLEMENT:

Justice Breyer, I haven't

12

thoroughly considered the issue, precisely because I do

13

think the '94 statute stands as an obstacle.

14

that some of the differences in the way that the death

15

penalty is administered, the fact that doctors aren't

16

directly involved --

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

18

GENERAL CLEMENT:

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It may be

At most, it --- would allow for --- at most, it would allow him

20

to prosecute, or to move for the dis-certification of

21

doctors who engage in that practice.

22

chooses to do it without doctors, it would be okay.

23

GENERAL CLEMENT:

And if the State

I think that's right.

As I

24

say, I think some of the technical ways in which the

25

penalty is administered could make a difference.

7
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, what we're getting -- at

2

least what I'm getting at was this is, I would probably

3

have read the statute to say that the drug statute, which

4

is trying to stop drug addiction and heroin and -- has

5

nothing to do with the death penalty.

6

that the argument on the other side is that the statute

7

has nothing to do with assisted suicide.

8

think about the death penalty, and it didn't think about

9

assisted suicide.

10

except a fortiori.

11

And I would think

Congress didn't

It's rather like the tobacco case,
Now, what's your response to that?

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, several points, Justice

12

Breyer.

13

Congress did focus on suicide, if not physician-assisted

14

suicide, and I think that's an important distinction that

15

I'd like to come back to.

16

comparison to the tobacco case is quite instructive,

17

because there what you had is a statute in which something

18

seemed like it might come within the plain terms of the

19

FDCA, and yet if you took that literally, it would run

20

smack into another statutory scheme.

21

I think that, first of all, I would say that

But I actually think the

And here, there is no other statutory scheme.

22

To the contrary, the most natural reading of the

23

Controlled Substances Act, I would say -- and I'll address

24

it in a minute -- is that this falls within the authority

25

of the Attorney General.

And if you look to any

8
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

alternative congressional indication of intent on this

2

topic, the only thing you would find is the Assisted

3

Suicide Funding Restriction Act of 1997, which continues a

4

Federal policy against assisted suicide.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

6

GENERAL CLEMENT:

7

May I comment -So, in that sense, I think

it's very different than the Brown and Williamson case.

8

Now, taking, though --

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

10

GENERAL CLEMENT:

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

May I --- as to what Congress --- may I ask you about the

12

position this Court took in Glucksberg?

13

on the Court in that case seemed to assume that physician-

14

assisted suicide was a matter for the State, and the

15

Government, at that time, said, "State legislatures

16

undoubtedly have the authority to create the kind of

17

exception to assisted suicide fashioned by the court of

18

appeals.

19

legislatures will address the urgent issues involved in

20

this case in a fair and impartial way."

21

Government added that, "There is no indication that the

22

political processes are malfunctioning in this area."

23

That was a position presented to this Court in the

24

Glucksberg case by the Government.

25

That is, everyone

There is every reason to believe that State

And then the

Now, you are rejecting that position.

GENERAL CLEMENT:

With respect, Justice

2

Ginsburg, I don't think so.

3

Glucksberg.

4

Federal law that everybody was focused on -- and, in

5

fairness, the United States was focused on -- was the

6

Federal Constitution.

7

difference.

8
9

I -- we stand by the brief in

Now, obviously in the Glucksberg case, the

And so, that's one important

Another important difference -- and I think this
is an important point -- is that the Federal regulation

10

here, the interpretation of the Attorney General, does not

11

purport to foreclose the issue of assisted suicide --

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

13

GENERAL CLEMENT:

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, they say --- which is --- that, in practical terms,

15

that is exactly what it does, because the only way they

16

can administer their law sensibly is by using these kinds

17

of drugs, scheduled drugs.

18

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Souter, we don't

19

have a factual record on that question.

20

clear that that's the case, because, I mean, proponents of

21

physician-assisted suicide have identified alternative

22

methods.

23

physician-assisted suicide, Dr. Kevorkian, operated

24

without a federal controlled-substance license for the

25

last six years before his conviction --

I think it's not

Perhaps the most notorious proponent of

10
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, did he use --

2

GENERAL CLEMENT:

-- at the time --

3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

4
5

-- did he use a controlled

substance?
GENERAL CLEMENT:

He did not.

He did not, which

6

is why he could do that.

7

physician-assisted suicide and the use of federally

8

controlled substances for physician-assisted suicide are

9

not coextensive.

10

So, it just goes to prove that

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But we're told that the --

11

those methods are less gentle to the patient, the methods

12

that the State of Oregon has authorized its physicians to

13

prescribe.

14

that, from the patient's point of view, it's much less

15

upsetting.

16

We are told, at least in some of the briefs,

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Justice Ginsburg, we operate

17

without a factual record on that point.

18

outside reading, it seems that some of the other methods

19

are actually disapproved, not because they're less -- more

20

painful, but because it's more obvious that it's a

21

suicide, in certain cases, and the administration of

22

scheduled drugs sort of blurs that line.

In doing some

23

JUSTICE STEVENS:

General Clement --

24

GENERAL CLEMENT:

But I guess my point would be,

25

even if we take it as true that controlled substances are

11
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

the most efficient way to do this, I take it as a given

2

that if Oregon doctors decided that a schedule 1 substance

3

was the most effective way to administer a lethal overdose

4

--

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

6

GENERAL CLEMENT:

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

8

GENERAL CLEMENT:

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But Congress --- after this Court's --- Congress spoke --- decision in Raich --- Congress spoke about

10

section -- schedule 1 drugs, and that's what's lacking

11

here.

12

never; schedule 2: okay on a doctor's prescription.

Congress says schedule 1 drugs, those are: no,

13

GENERAL CLEMENT:

I agree there is that

14

difference between schedule 1 and schedule 2 substances.

15

Now, I think that brings us to the Attorney General's

16

regulation, which is a longstanding regulation.

17

JUSTICE STEVENS:

General Clement, before you go

18

there, I want to question you about your distinction

19

between Dr. Kevorkian and a doctor who uses controlled

20

substances.

21

Kevorkian's conduct as conduct that may threaten the

22

public health and safety, and seek his -- cancellation of

23

his license?

24
25

Why could not the Attorney General treat Dr.

GENERAL CLEMENT:
he could.

Justice Stevens, I don't think

First of all, I think it's clear that that

12
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

isn't the authority that's invoked here.

2

General in the --

And the Attorney

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, he --

4

GENERAL CLEMENT:

-- OLC opinion are patently --

5

JUSTICE STEVENS:

-- he can rely --

6

GENERAL CLEMENT:

-- clear on that.

7

JUSTICE STEVENS:

-- on things like prior

8

convictions, other things unrelated to a specific

9

transaction.

And if he thinks that assisted suicide is

10

contrary conduct that threatens the public interest,

11

health and safety, I don't know why that wouldn't apply to

12

Dr. Kevorkian, as well as somebody using controlled

13

substances.

14

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Stevens, the

15

reason I would say that it wouldn't is, I think you have

16

to read this regulation against a backdrop that for 90

17

years the Federal Government has been involved in the

18

regulation of controlled substance.

19

a lot of statements and a lot of court opinions during

20

that 90 years --

21

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Now, there have been

But the Attorney General's

22

directive, if I remember it, does not identify any

23

particular controlled substance.

24

particular kind of conduct by the doctor.

25

GENERAL CLEMENT:

It just identified a

The -- I'm not sure if you're

13
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

referring to the statute or the regulation.

2

it this way, which is to say --

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Neither one.

I would say

Neither one is

4

identifying which schedule 2 or schedule 3 substance may

5

not be used.

6

GENERAL CLEMENT:

I think that's fair, Justice

7

Stevens.

8

you're right to say that the statutory grant of authority

9

to the Attorney General is quite broad.

I don't take issue with that.

And I think

He's supposed to

10

make judgments in the public interest about public health

11

and safety.

12

The point I was trying to make is, I would read

13

all of that against the backdrop that for 90 years the

14

Federal Government has been involved in the regulation of

15

controlled substance.

16

to have an incidental effect on State regulation --

And we all know that that is going

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, for me --

18

GENERAL CLEMENT:

-- of medicine.

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

-- for me, the case turns on

20

the statute.

21

that your answer to Justice Stevens would be to say that

22

the Justice Department has found this practice to be an

23

abuse of the drug.

24

you had, in fact, given that answer, my question --

25

And it's a hard case.

And it seems to me

But then, my question -- and if -- if

[Laughter.]

14
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

-- my question would then be,

2

Isn't that an odd statutory scheme, where the Attorney

3

General can find it to be an abuse of the use of the drug

4

if the State of Oregon has specifically told its doctors,

5

under special procedures in defined circumstances, that

6

they can administer it?

7

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, I don't think that would

8

be an odd regime.

9

radically different judgment and said that in Oregon it

I think if, for example, Oregon made a

10

was going to be permissible to have treatment or

11

detoxification programs that involve the administration of

12

radically larger quantities of controlled substances than

13

had been recognized in any other State, I think, under the

14

authority of cases like Moore, the Attorney General can

15

make a judgment -- now, that's not a legitimate medical

16

purpose, that's --

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, that's --

18

GENERAL CLEMENT:

-- an abuse.

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

-- that's -- that's a -- the

20

slipper-slope argument that I wanted to explore a bit.

21

we do rule against you, and for the State of Oregon, on

22

the statute, you do think that there will be some other

23

serious consequence which will hinder the Department of

24

Justice in an orderly implementation of this statute,

25

particularly under the abuse formulation?

If

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

GENERAL CLEMENT:

I think there could be,

2

Justice Kennedy.

3

sense that -- one of the reasons you don't see that much

4

of a conflict between Federal and State law in the

5

regulation of controlled substances is because, in the

6

main, the States have adopted uniform controlled-

7

substances acts that mirror the Federal Act, and, in most

8

of the instances there, works in the way of cooperative

9

federalism in dealing with this problem.

I don't want to overstate it, in the

This Court tends

10

to see the cases -- Raich, in this case -- where there's a

11

conflict between the State regime and the Federal regime.

12

And I guess my point is the -- in a such a

13

comprehensive Federal regime, if this Court makes clear

14

that State law can overtake the Federal regime, I think it

15

at least creates the potential for there to be a lot of

16

holes in the regime and the possibility, if States take

17

the -- take you up on that invitation --

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But part --

19

GENERAL CLEMENT:

-- to really undermine the

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

-- part of the regime referred

20
21

regime.

22

to under the statute -- and it's 801(a) implementing the

23

convention on psychotropic drugs -- and there, the

24

implementation incorporates the treaty -- but it says

25

that, "This shall not displace the judgment of the medical

16
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

community, as determined by the Secretary."

2

to me that that cuts against you in this case.

3

GENERAL CLEMENT:

And it seems

Well, Justice Kennedy, it is

4

perfectly true that there are places in the statute where

5

medical or scientific decisions are expressly given to the

6

Secretary of Health and Human Services and not the

7

Attorney General, but it is equally true that there are

8

places in the Controlled Substances Act where medical

9

determinations or public-health determinations are given

10

expressly to the Attorney General and not the Secretary of

11

Health and Human Services.

12

course, that's true is Sections 823 and 824 of Title 1 --

13

Title 21 -- which, of course, are the provisions about the

14

registration and revocation of registrants.

15

--

16

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

And one of the places, of

And Congress

Well, certainly the practice

17

of medicine by physicians is an area traditionally

18

regulated by the States, is it not?

19

GENERAL CLEMENT:

20
21

It absolutely is, Justice

O'Connor, but -JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

And there is nothing express

22

in the statute suggesting that it's designed to put in the

10

Well, yes, but I think this

Yes.
-- failed legislative efforts.

And if --

11

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

12

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Yes.
-- the Attorney General had

13

not adopted this interpretation, it may be that this

14

Congress would have passed those initiatives --

15
16

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

And a prior Attorney General

had a different interpretation.

17

GENERAL CLEMENT:

And the prior administer of

18

the DEA before that had our position.

19

where I think, you know, there are different approaches to

20

this.

21

So, this is an area

What I wanted to make clear, though, is, you're

22

absolutely right that the regulation of medicine is --

23

this Court has observed -- is traditionally left to the

24

States.

25

for 90 years the Federal Government has had a prominent

But that has to be reconciled with the fact that

-- purposes, but they are

10

highly classified, highly controlled substances.

11

the -- the substances that are at issue here are the most

12

highly controlled lawful substances.

13

go back to the history of the Harrison Act, it's been

14

clear since the very first prosecutions under the Harrison

15

Narcotics Act of 1914 that the Federal Government's

16

ability to regulate medicine was going to have an

17

incidental effect on the State's ability to regulate

18

medicine.

19

attitude towards -- laissez-faire attitude towards the

20

opium trade, but that was really displaced by the --

They are

And I think if you

I mean, States had much more of a laissez

21

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

22

GENERAL CLEMENT:

23

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Yeah, but it's a --- Harrison Act.
-- it's a different thing to

24

regulate by saying, "No one can prescribe this substance.

25

It's so lethal, we won't let anyone prescribe it at all."

19
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

And it's quite different to say, "This -- if a -- if a

2

physician follows the Oregon law, it's a -- it's not a

3

legitimate practice of medicine."

4

approach.

5

GENERAL CLEMENT:

That's a very different

Justice O'Connor, I can't tell

6

you there isn't a difference between the treatment of

7

schedule 1 substances --

8

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

9

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Yeah.
-- that are just verboten for

10

all purposes and schedule 2 substances, but the regulation

11

of Federal controlled substances in the Harrison Act has

12

always focused on drugs that have some lawful medical uses

13

but are --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What --

-- also susceptible to abuse.
-- what is the closest

17

analog you have, outside of the present case, where the

18

Attorney General's enforcement activity has impinged upon

19

what the State has recognized as medical practice?

20

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, I think I would -- I

21

mean, I -- I guess I would do two answers to that, Mr.

22

Chief Justice.

23

the genesis of the Harrison Act, it really was displacing

24

State medical judgments about the opium trade.

25

point to two other examples, one under this statute and

I would

1

one other the -- under the FDCA.

2

The idea under the FDCA -- the example that

3

comes to mind is the FDA's treatment of Laetrile, that

4

this Court addressed in the Rutherford decision.

5

case, 17 States had made a judgment that Laetrile was --

6

could be available, for prescription use, to treat cancer.

7

And the FDA, by refusing to approve Laetrile --

8
9
10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

In that

Well, that's the FDA.

I'm talking about the Attorney General, under this
statute.

11

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, then I think I would --

12

I mean, I -- I'm not sure I can point to a decision by the

13

Attorney General, but I think it's -- in the structure of

14

this Act -- obviously the schedule 1 treatment of

15

marijuana that this Court had before it in the Raich case,

16

involved a situation where the Act clearly displaced the

17

medical judgments of California and nine other States --

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

19

GENERAL CLEMENT:

20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but --- who recognized --- that was a clear act of

Congress.

22

was unmistakable.

23

you have, with your reference back to the Harrison Act and

24

the 90 years of regulation, is that the 90 years of

25

regulation was regulation for the purpose of stopping drug

I mean, Congress had made that decision, and it
It seems to me that the problem that

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

pushing and drug abuse, in the conventional sense.

2

say that a statute -- or a statutory history taken into

3

consideration in determining the scope of this statute,

4

with that kind of a history, can support a view that

5

suddenly the Attorney General of the United States is

6

given, in effect, the sole authority to determine whether

7

any State may or may not authorize assisted suicide, and

8

may do so in a way that any other Attorney General can

9

flip back and forth -- as has happened in this case, if

And to

10

Attorney General Reno was wrong -- seems to me a kind of

11

argument from history that simply cuts against you,

12

because it leads to a sort of a bizarre result.

13

what is your response to that?

14

GENERAL CLEMENT:

I mean,

Well, Justice Souter, I think

15

you have to look at the regulation of drug abuse and ask,

16

To what end was Congress regulating these substances?

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, and I -- as I said, it

18

seems to me that your 91 years of history say that the end

19

that Congress had in mind was to stop drug pushing and

20

stop conventional drug abuse.

21

there's no indication that I know of that Congress had

22

assisted suicide in mind, any more than it had the

23

administration of the death penalty in mind.

24
25

GENERAL CLEMENT:

It didn't have any more --

Well, Justice Souter, what I

would say is, what Congress had in mind in enacting these

22
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

substances is, they were concerned about drug abuse, not

2

for its own sake, but for the debilitating effect it has

3

on people's lives, for its tendency to destroy lives.

4

I will grant you that Congress, in 1970, did not have

5

before it in its contemplation a State that would make

6

physician-assisted suicide lawful.

7

would have been unthinkable at that time.

8

Congress did have clearly in its contemplation is the fact

9

that a clear manifestation of a drug's potential for abuse

And

But that's because it
And what

10

was the fact that it could lead to suicide and overdoses.

11

And that's page 35 of the House report, for those that

12

look at legislative history.

--

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And I actually think that's

Suicide is a result of the kind

15

of dementia that comes from drug abuse.

18

GENERAL CLEMENT:

That is not

Well, Congress didn't specify,

19

one way or another.

20

to the House report, because I think it actually is

21

indicative, because when Congress is framing the issue,

22

they first look at the extent of the problem.

23

the ways they identify the problem as serious is, they

24

point to overdoses that are taking place among teenagers.

25

And then, in the next section of the report, they look at

And what I would -- I would point you

And one of

23
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

1

the question of the consequences of drug abuse.

2

do they point to as --

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And what

General, then may I just ask

4

this question?

5

authorized this action by the Attorney General.

6

the Raich case, which, of course, was a close case --

7

there were three dissents in the case -- the -- there was

8

great attention on the fact Congress had considered the

9

interstate market for the product involved, an impact on

We're focusing on whether congress really
And in

10

the market if it was allowed to be sold in -- or grown and

11

so forth in California.

12

that Congress thought that any of these -- schedule 2 or 3

13

substances that are used in assisted-suicide situations --

14

that Congress focused on the impact of that use on the

15

interstate market for those drugs?

16

But is there any evidence at all

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Stevens, I mean,

17

I -- first of all, I would say, as it compared to Raich, I

18

would almost think this is an a fortiori case, as it

19

affects commerce, because, unlike Raich, which, of course,

20

were untraditional noncommercial transactions, the

21

transactions at issue here are standard commercial

22

transactions that are --

23

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But are they --

24

GENERAL CLEMENT:

-- well within --

25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

-- are they transactions that

1

have any impact on any market, any commercial market, that

2

Congress ever mentioned?

3

GENERAL CLEMENT:

I think they do.

And I sure

4

hope they do, because this is a situation where Congress

5

and the Federal Government pervasively regulates the drug

6

transactions at issue here in a way that even respondents

7

don't object to.

8

out for the prescription, the fact that it has to be in

9

writing, the regulations specify whether it has to be in

The details of the form that you fill

10

pen or pencil -- I mean, there's such a pervasive

11

involvement of the Federal Government in the regulation of

12

these controlled substances that I don't think there's any

13

additional commerce clause extension by regulating the

14

purpose for which the prescription is being made.

15

what the DEA did in the context of Marinol, when it was

16

first moved from schedule 1 to schedule 2, that -- we

17

discuss that in detail on page 30 of our brief.

18

think that kind of regulation, although it's not a common

19

feature of the DEA in its administration of the Controlled

20

Substances Act, is an important one, is a legitimate one.

21

That's

And I

And I guess what I would say, with respect to

22

Congress's intent, is, it seems to me odd to think that a

23

Congress that was concerned about overdoses, concerned

24

about suicides, would be indifferent or agnostic on the

25

question of using federally controlled substances for the

25
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

express purpose of inducing a lethal overdose.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why were -- you were going to

3

say, at one point -- why was Congress concerned about

4

overdoses of narcotics and so forth?

5

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Why?

I think they were concerned

6

with it part and parcel of -- because, I mean, I think of

7

the things that Congress does when it regulates is, it

8

regulates to protect life, to protect health and safety --

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

But, I mean, there was a

10

reason, wasn't there, that they're worried about people

11

taking narcotics?

12

GENERAL CLEMENT:

JUSTICE BREYER:

What was the main --

And they're worried about the

impact -JUSTICE BREYER:

I would have thought it was

narcotics addiction.
GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, I think it is, but,

again, I think -JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

Well, if it is

narcotics addiction --

24

GENERAL CLEMENT:

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

But not solely.
-- and I would have thought

26
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

that was it --

2

GENERAL CLEMENT:

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, not solely.
All right.

All right.

Again,

4

because you know I'm going to say, What has this got to do

5

with that?

So, why not solely?

6

[Laughter.]

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

8
9

Not solely.

You go ahead.

What else?
GENERAL CLEMENT:

Not solely.

And, again, I

10

mean, I think, you know, addiction qua addiction was not

11

the concern so much as addiction because of its tendency

12

to debilitate lives --

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

14

GENERAL CLEMENT:

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

16
17
18

addiction.

Right.
-- to destroy lives -Yes.

Yes, but it's true

And this seems to --

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, no, I don't think that's

right, Justice Breyer.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

20

GENERAL CLEMENT:

No?
I think there are a number of

21

instances where the abuse that is being -- that Congress

22

is concerned with is not solely the addictive abuse.

23

mean, to take one example, Congress has recently, as part

24

of the controlled substances regime, regulated GHB, one of

25

these so-called "date-rape drugs."

I

And the concern for

27
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

abuse there is not its addictive quality, but the fact

2

that it can be used in a way that's not medical, that can

3

be very pernicious, and the like.

4

just another example of this concept of abuse being much

5

broader than a narrow focus on diversion or a narrow focus

6

on addiction.

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And so, I think that's

Yeah, but even in your example,

8

the concern of Congress is with the use of the drug to

9

hurt people who do not understand that they're going to be

10

hurt, and don't want to be hurt, and perhaps, in your

11

example, the use of the drug to facilitate the violation

12

of the law, that seems to me worlds away from what we're

13

talking about here.

14

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Souter, I would

15

simply say that the Controlled Substances Act, if you look

16

at it, is a very paternalistic piece of legislation.

17

not designed to let people make their own judgments about

18

the health risk.

It's

MR. ATKINSON:

That's certainly true, Your

2

Honor.

3

in Glucksberg and in the opinion -- excuse me -- and in

4

the text of the Controlled Substances Act, you will find

5

that this Court has recognized that this specific subject,

6

physician-assisted dying, is one that is for the States to

7

regulate.

8
9

And yet I think if you look both at your opinion

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, that begs the

question -- if you had said "this specific subject," the

10

regulation of controlled substances, your answer would

11

have come out the other way, which is kind of what the

12

case is about.

13

MR. ATKINSON:

I agree.

And let me talk, then,

14

about the -- why we believe the text of the statute

15

demonstrates that Congress intended to leave the decision

16

about what is, and is not, a legitimate medical practice

17

to the States, as it has always been.

18

question in this case, because the U.S. Attorney General

19

--

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

And that's the key

Yes, because, I mean, wouldn't

21

-- suppose that some State said that, "We think doctors

22

can prescribe, for people who want to take it, morphine

23

for recreational use."

24
25

MR. ATKINSON:

Your Honor, there are a number of

limits clear in the Controlled Substances Act.

1

the hypothetical you've offered, specifically, we think

2

that the answer would have to be that Congress intended to

3

leave the definition of what is a legitimate medical

4

practice to the States.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

No matter what?

I mean, they

6

have cases and so forth that say, "Of course a State could

And you're going to say your case turns or falls --

10

State could not stop a doctor from becoming, in effect, a

11

conduit to a group of drug dealers by saying, "I think

12

recreational use is part of my medical practice"?

13

would be up to the State?

14

MR. ATKINSON:
it, yes.

Certainly, the State could stop

But that --- but could the State allow

it?

21

MR. ATKINSON:

the Federal Government would have to allow the drugs to be

I would have thought that at

the time this legislation was enacted, it would have been

10

as unthinkable for a State to allow drugs to be used -- to

11

be prescribed by a doctor to kill a patient as it would be

12

for drugs to be subscribed by a doctor to make the patient

13

feel better.

MR. ATKINSON:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Your Honor, many drugs -I mean, I think that assisted

was enacted as prescribing cocaine just for recreational

use.

MR. ATKINSON:

We don't suggest that Congress

20

had physician-assisted dying specifically in mind at the

21

time that it enacted the Controlled Substances Act.

22

we do think that Congress had in mind was the 200-year

history of State regulation of medicine, of the practice

24

of medicine, and what were, and were not, legitimate

medical purposes.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you agree -- you -- in

2

answer to Justice Breyer's question, he mentioned a drug

3

that was a schedule 1 drug, morphine.

4

MR. ATKINSON:

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

6

MR. ATKINSON:

7

Or maybe --

I'm sorry --- perhaps it isn't --

-- I think it is a schedule 2

drug, Your Honor.

8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

9

MR. ATKINSON:

It's schedule 2 drug.

Yes.

We certainly don't suggest

10

that a State could authorize the use of a schedule 1 drug

11

for any purpose at all.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But are you saying that if

13

the doctor is using it, saying, "In my medical judgment,

14

this makes people happy; and, therefore, I'm going to

15

prescribe it," that a State could permit that?

16

the Moore case rule that out?

17

MR. ATKINSON:

Wouldn't

I don't think so, Your Honor.

18

There aren't -- there is no history of the U.S. Attorney

19

General prosecuting any doctor at any time in the -- in

20

the -- since before Moore --

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But I thought the idea of

22

Moore was, if you're using this, the doctor is prescribing

the drug as a pusher.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but let's -- but

2

the supposition is that the State legal judgment is that

that's the wrong characterization, that it's legitimate

medical practice to make patients feel better, and

5

morphine does that; and so, the State can allow them to

prescribe morphine to make people feel better.

understand your position to be that that would be

permissible?

And you say the Attorney

what do you say about this case?

3

MR. ATKINSON:

Well, first of all, we don't

4

think, Justice Breyer, that what the U.S. Attorney General

5

is attempting to do here is reasonable within the scope of

6

whatever authority he has.

7

the processes and procedures that are specified in the

8

Controlled Substances Act.

9

case is, he simply lacks the authority to do that.

10

Moreover, he has not followed

But our first position in this

The Controlled Substances Act reflects, first,

11

in Section 903, the anti-preemption provision, which is

12

found in the State's brief, at page 36, that Congress

13

intended not to intrude on State laws that would otherwise

14

be within the authority of the State.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What does that do to the

16

effectiveness of regulation under the Controlled

17

Substances Act?

18

doctors to prescribe morphine to make people feel better,

19

or to prescribe steroids for bodybuilding, doesn't that

20

undermine the uniformity of the Federal law and make

21

enforcement impossible?

22

MR. ATKINSON:

If one State can say it's legal for

I don't believe it does, Mr.

enforce the prohibition on that elsewhere?

MR. ATKINSON:

Well, there is no -- well, the

Congress can prescribe -- can enforce it in any State in

5

which it is not authorized by State law.

6

Attorney General wants to regulate it in a State where it

a clear statement of authority to do that.

to the Chief Justice's question, that, in fact, Congress,

21

Not at all, Justice Souter.

MR. ATKINSON:

We're sticking to the statutory

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Which comes down to an argument

38
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

that "accepted medical practice" means accepted medical

practice State by State --

MR. ATKINSON:

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's correct.
-- rather than on some uniform

5

basis.

6

enforcement of this Act, where the drug is allowed, or not

7

allowed, to be used on the basis of divergent views of

8

medical practice by divergent States?

9
10

Do you have any other area, regarding the

MR. ATKINSON:

There are any number of areas in

which --

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

12

MR. ATKINSON:

Such as?
-- States diverge.

Such as --

13

palliative care, I think, is the most obvious example.

14

These days, there is a great deal of divergence among the

15

States as to how --

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

In palliative care?

And you

17

think in some States you can -- you can prescribe these

18

drugs without violating the Act; whereas, in other States,

19

the same prescription would violate the Act.

20

MR. ATKINSON:

In some States, a prescription

21

would violate State law; and in other cases, in other

22

States, that same prescription would not.

23
24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Would it violate the Federal

law in those other States?
MR. ATKINSON:

It would if the -- if the

39
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

prescription violated the State law, the U.S. Attorney

2

General could take action against the physician.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Oh.

So you say that in -- with

4

respect to many aspects of this legislation, what's lawful

5

-- and what's lawful depends upon the accepted medical

6

practice within the State.

7
8
9

MR. ATKINSON:

That's exactly correct, Justice

-JUSTICE SCALIA:

Does this have to be reflected

10

in the State medical board determinations, or just in what

11

the -- what the doctors in that region tend to think is a

12

good idea?

13

MR. ATKINSON:

Your Honor, what we believe is

14

that what Congress did in enacting the Controlled

15

Substances Act was leave those decisions to the States to

16

enforce according to their traditional methods.

17

some cases, that may be by statute; in some cases, the

18

States may discipline doctors for -- through a State

19

medical board.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Now, in

Any cases that you can think of

21

where the same prescription has been held okay in one

22

State and not okay in another State?

23

MR. ATKINSON:

Your Honor, we're not aware of

24

any cases in which the U.S. Attorney General has ever

25

attempted to de-register or to prosecute a doctor who was

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

1

acting in accordance with State law.

2

that we're -- to -- at least since the Controlled

3

Substances Act, in 1970, where the U.S. Attorney General

4

has never attempted to suggest, as he does here, that

5

something that is permissible under State law is, in any

6

sense, a violation --

7

JUSTICE STEVENS:

8

MR. ATKINSON:

9

We have a history

Yes, but the --

Act.

10

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And some are

16

"such other conduct which may threaten the public health

and safety."

18

authority to go beyond State law.

19

MR. ATKINSON:

It seems to me that's a clear grant of

Justice Stevens, we think that

20

the best reading of the five factors is that they continue

21

to respect State laws.

22

legislative history, for those of you who would be willing

23

to look at it, of the 1984 amendments reflects.

24

was not concerned about how States were defining

25

legitimate medical practices.

Certainly, that's what the

Congress

Congress was concerned

41
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

about the failure to enforce existing State law.

that's clearly reflected in the legislative history, some

of which is set out in the State's brief, on page 36, in

4

note 16.

5

are addressed to is individual applicants -- that is,

6

individual doctors -- not to broad medical purposes.

7

And

But if you look at those five factors, what they

And what you're seeing here in the Attorney

8

General's claim of authority, for the first time, is rules

9

that are not addressed to controlled substances, per se,

10

but to medical practices, and that is something that the

11

Congress simply never contemplated giving you.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, what do you do

with regulation 1306, which -- the one that, of course,

14

talks about "legitimate medical purpose"?

15

17

has the authority to interpret that phrase.

18

That was

It wasn't directed to the Oregon

And yet it suggests that the Attorney General

MR. ATKINSON:

Well, we think there's -- there

19

are two answers to that, Chief -- Mr. Chief Justice.

20

first is that, in Harris versus Christensen, this Court

21

said that a Federal agent cannot promulgate a new

22

regulation in the guise of interpreting an old one.

23

in 1971, when that regulation to which you refer was

24

enacted, it was absolutely clear that the U.S. Attorney

25

General could not have de-registered an Oregon doctor who

The

Now,

42
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1

was acting in accordance with State law, because, as this

2

Court pointed out in United States versus Moore, the

3

registration was a matter -- was as a matter of right if

4

the -- if the physician was in good standing with State

5

medical authorities.

6

So, what he's attempting to do today, in the

7

guise of interpreting that rule, is to make it mean

8

something entirely different than what it meant when he

9

enacted it.

10

And I think Christensen versus Harris County

says that he simply cannot do that.

Mr. Atkinson, you've spent most

of your time talking about the statute and the

regulations.

The question here is -- first of

matters that belong to the police power of the States.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The statute gives the Attorney

2

General authority to promulgate regulations for the

dispensing of drug -- 821 -- and that seems to me to

4

describe precisely what the Attorney General has done

5

here.

6

MR. ATKINSON:

I can't disagree with that,

7

Justice Kennedy.

8

to tell a doctor in a particular State, not by reference

9

to a particular drug that he may not dispense this drug,

The question is, Does he have authority

10

but that he may not dispense a drug for a specific medical

11

purpose?

12

we've ever seen that happen.

13

it's inconsistent with the congressional design, which was

14

to leave the subject of what are, and are not, legitimate

15

medical purposes to the States and to -- and to have the

16

U.S. Attorney General promulgate rules that deal with

17

things like the -- like prescriptions, scheduling of those

18

drugs so that they are on schedule 2 or schedule 3 or

19

perhaps --

And, as I've suggested, this is the first time

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

21

MR. ATKINSON:

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And we think that's because

Well, it seems to me --

-- schedule 1.
-- very odd to have a

23

regulation on dispensing that takes no account of the

purpose for which the drug is being used.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

odder, frankly, Justice Kennedy, to suggest that Congress

to decide, in his sole and apparently un-reviewable

discretion, that this medical practice, of which he

disapproves, may not be --

gets to authorize regulations on dispensation -- to

require, for example, that there be prescriptions before

it be dispensed, that physicians shall follow certain

rules and regulations before they dispense, and those are

the kinds of things on which we agree he has the authority

States to distribute or dispense a controlled substance in

4

Am I wrong about that?

5

"In the course of professional practice, the prescription,

6

to be effective, must be a legitimate medical purpose by

7

an individual practitioner."

8

does it work?

And I thought this

I thought it was a reg that says,

MR. ATKINSON:

Now, I might be wrong.

How

No, I think that's absolutely

10

right.

11

question from the question of, Who gets to define, as a

12

matter of policy, what is a "legitimate medical practice"?

13

But the question -- that is a very different

JUSTICE BREYER:

On the matter of policy, I

14

would -- since -- if you -- if you've said basically what

15

you want to say in your argument, I would appreciate your

16

devoting a minute to an assumption which you don't want to

17

agree with.

18

not free, through the device of defining what's good

19

medical practice, to gut the Act -- that is, to really

20

make marijuana or something else, like morphine, legal --

21

because they disagree with Congress's basic judgment that

22

it should be illegal.

But suppose I were to assume that a State is

That could happen.

23

MR. ATKINSON:

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

It could.
Now, suppose I think that the

that, on that assumption, do I have to decide this case

against you?

All right?

Now, on that, do I have -- if I believe

MR. ATKINSON:

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. ATKINSON:

No.
And if not, why not?
There are at least two reasons

for that, Justice Breyer.

clause question, which we believe to be --

JUSTICE BREYER:

The first is the commerce-

Suppose, on the commerce-clause

10

question, I -- on assumption, I don't agree with you,

either -- then do I have to decide?

MR. ATKINSON:

14

I'm starting to be backed into a

corner.

15

[Laughter.]

16

MR. ATKINSON:

I think -- I think the third

17

answer then becomes the procedural answer, Justice Breyer,

18

and that is that what the U.S. Attorney General is doing

19

here violates the rule this Court stated in Christensen

20

versus Harris County, and he is attempting to do, by an

21

administrative rule, what he can only do by notice in

22

comment rulemaking.

23

I would --

in a State that doesn't seem to have much to do with the

purpose of the Act.

MR. ATKINSON:

disagree with that in --

[Laughter.]

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, I certainly would not

Yes, you would.

I think --

It seems to me -- it seems to

10

me that you -- that you cannot accept the premise that it

11

guts the Act, if you come in here with the proposition,

12

which you do, that what the Act says is: whatever is

13

accepted medical practice within the State is okay.

14

That's your principal point.

15

MR. ATKINSON:

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That is correct.
But the Act does not refer to

17

any overall Federal accepted medical practice.

you said there were procedural problems, no notice in

The Attorney General, on the one hand, and

MR. ATKINSON:

Justice Ginsburg, I can't answer

that question in specific respect to this case, because

there is no authority in the Controlled Substances Act for

anyone to do what has been done here -- that is, to focus

on the specific medical practice and say, "No controlled

that the Attorney General has never done this before, has

control is nationwide, no matter what the State medical

board thinks, right?

MR. ATKINSON:

Yes.

There is -- there are --

for example, in scheduling of drugs -- and the U.S.

it were.

Services, and must accept that advice and be bound by it.

that answers your question.

concerning the -- Justice Scalia's suggestion that you're

52
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

insisting the States would have the authority to act

2

independently of a congressional prohibition against the

3

use of a substance to make people happy and so forth.

4

Isn't your point in this case that Congress hasn't really

5

spoken to the issue to which the Attorney General has

6

spoken?

8

MR. ATKINSON:

That's exactly right, Justice

Stevens.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Which is the opposite of the

10

case that Justice Scalia point, where the Congress has

11

spoken to the issue.

12

MR. ATKINSON:

And there are circumstances in

13

which it has, and those in which it has not.

14

to respond to Justice Scalia's point, again I would invoke

15

the 200 years of responsible regulation of the practice of

16

medicine, which is the backdrop against which Congress

17

legislated in this case.

assume, nor should it, that States are going to -- are

going to simply legalize drugs to make people happy.

the practice of medicine evolves, that things change, that

today's -- acupuncture, the use of Botox, things that were

is whether Congress intended to enact a uniform medical

MR. ATKINSON:

I don't think that it would have

occurred to them either, Justice Scalia, but I do think

what occurred to them was that that was a matter that,

medical practice, the States could be trusted to act

9

responsibly.

10
11

That's what Oregon has done here.

That's

what this Court invited the States to do in Glucksberg.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

But I take it you would agree

12

that, in effect, all you need to win on the statutory

13

argument is for us to accept the premise that Congress may

14

very well have intended to interfere with the practice of

15

medicine and to authorize the Attorney General to do it,

16

insofar as the practice of medicine would have gutted the

17

statute -- e.g., doctors who prescribe recreational drugs,

18

doctors who, in effect, cater to pushers -- but that

19

Congress did not intend to go any further than that in

20

authorizing interference with the practice of medicine.

take it you agree that if we accepted that premise, that

would be sufficient for you in this case.

I think Respondents have embraced the logical

18

turning the Controlled Substances Act, the federal

19

Controlled Substances Act, into an odd patchwork.

20

is profoundly a-historical, because, at the time of the

21

Harrison Act of 1914 -- which the Controlled Substances

22

Act was intended to strengthen, not weaken, as this Court

23

pointed out in Moore -- at that time, the States had a

24

variety of different approaches to opium and heroin and

other -- and cocaine and other substances -- opium and

GENERAL CLEMENT:

It was, Mr. Chief Justice.

recognition that doctors were part and parcel of the

problem, that there were needs in States to more closely

regulate both the doctors and the pharmacies.

there's no question that the impact of the Federal program

was profound on the State's practice of medicine.

the tradition in this area.

May I ask you this question?

If the Attorney General determined that acupuncture was

conduct that threatened the public health and safety,

58
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

could he de-license, or revoke, the license of doctors who

engaged in acupuncture?

3

GENERAL CLEMENT:

I don't think so, Justice

4

Stevens.

5

is, I think you have to look at this regime, and read it

6

in light of the 90 years of Federal involvement in the

7

regulation of controlled substances and the lack of a

8

traditional Federal role in regulating medicine qua

9

medicine.

10
11

It's the same reason as my answer earlier, which

And I think this is on the -- on the side of

the line of regulating controlled substances.
With respect to the commerce-clause issue, I

12

would -- thought that one thing that came clear out of the

13

Raich decision is that the relevant factor to consider is

14

not the class of activities that a State decides to

15

decriminalize, but, rather, the class of activities that

16

Congress decides to regulate.

17

And with respect to schedule 2 substances, I

18

would think this case is a fortiori.

19

about substances that are homegrown and are never part of

20

a commercial transaction.

dissent in Raich, I think, would think that this was an

appropriate commerce-clause application.

2

I wanted to remark and focus for a minute on

3

what an odd statute Oregon has passed.

respondents point out it is a prescribing law only.

Oregon itself points out that what's allowed here is the

6

prescription, but not the administration, of these

substances.

Even what Oregon does, does not purport to be
medicine, as one traditionally understands it.

I can

10

think of no other medical substance where a doctor can

prescribe it, but not administer it.

12

look at that aspect of the statute, what becomes clear is

13

that Oregon is not regulating medicine, it's purporting to

14

basically take a Federal regulatory regime that allows

15

doctors the ability to get at schedule 2 substances.
