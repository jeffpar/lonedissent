ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

11

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
The Solomon Amendment conditions the Federal

12

funding of educational institutions on receiving

13

something that any donor would expect, the opportunity

14

to recruit students educated at the funded

15

institutions.

16

fair shot at recruiting the best and the brightest for

17

the military's critical and vital mission.

18

That opportunity allows the military a

The Federal Government does not insist on any

19

predetermined level of access; rather, it simply asks

20

what other employers receive.

21

schools remain free to criticize the military and its

22

policies, and, of course, they remain free to decline

23

Federal funds altogether.

24

circumstances, the Solomon Amendment comports with both

25

the Constitution and with common sense.

Likewise, the recipient

JUSTICE SCALIA:

When you say that it asks

2

what other employers receive, but these institutions, I

3

gather, would not allow other employers, who have the

4

same policy against the hiring of homosexuals, to

5

interview at their institutions.

6

what other employers in the same situation would

7

receive.

8
9

GENERAL CLEMENT:

So, you're receiving

Well, I think, Justice

Scalia, that you have to look at the -- I think, the

10

statute in two steps.

11

that it gives the military a right to gain access to

12

campus as a condition, that it has -- that they have to

13

gain access to campus in order to perform their

14

military recruitment.

15

One is, I think it's quite clear

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Yes, but it says -- I

16

thought it says that the military must have equal

17

access with any other employer.

18

employer is subject to the same policy, presumably, of

19

the law school.

20

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Now, every other

Well, with respect, Justice

21

O'Connor, I think there's several points to be made in

22

response to that.

23

Amendment itself is a recognition that the military is

24

not like any other employer for purposes of its policy

25

and its treatments of homosexuals.

First of all, I think the Solomon

And I think that,

4
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

unlike any other employer, the military's policy is a

2

result of a congressional mandate.

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And --

Well, that's fine, but you

4

were the one that made the argument that they want the

5

same access as other employers.

That's --

6

GENERAL CLEMENT:

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

8

GENERAL CLEMENT:

-- what I would say --

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

-- want to make sure what

10

And what --- when you -- I just --

the calculus is, at the outset.

11

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, and Justice Kennedy,

12

I think the point I would say is, in terms of gaining

13

access to campus, we want to gain access at a level,

14

and under

15

employer would be excluded.

16

gained, then the question arose under the prior version

17

of the statute, all right, if access is gained, what

18

level of access suffices?

19

question of what level of access suffices, then you

20

look to what is provided to any other employer.

21

so, that's why, when I say that we don't ask for any

22

predetermined level, we don't ask for seven meetings a

23

year, we don't ask for entrance into the public-address

24

system or the e-mail system.

25

let us on campus, just give us, and extend to us, an

circumstances, that perhaps some other
Well, once access is

And on that second-order

And

We simply say, "Once you

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1

opportunity to recruit on the same terms as others."

2

And that obviously reflects the commonsense judgment

3

that the military is competing for the same pool of

4

students that the other employers are competing for.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

The constitutional argument,

6

I guess, is, "Does the Constitution require access --

7

is -- does it permit a statute which says you have to

8

give access to the military, when you wouldn't give

9

access to any other employer?"

10
11

GENERAL CLEMENT:
Justice Breyer.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

13

GENERAL CLEMENT:

14

All right.

Now --

And, of course, we take the

--

15
16

That's exactly right,

JUSTICE BREYER:
it

So, then what you're saying,

--

17

GENERAL CLEMENT:

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- position that --- and then what's the

19

answer to that question, "Does the Constitution" -- how

20

does the -- what's the answer?

21

GENERAL CLEMENT:

I think there's -- I mean,

22

there's -- the Constitution is -- has no difficulty

23

with such a statute.

24

there's -- if you want to think about it being

25

preferential entry into campus, and then, at that

It is this statute.

As I say,

1

point, equal access on terms of the -- the terms that

2

are extended -- however you want to think about it,

3

though, there's no difficult constitutional question

4

here.

5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, your argument --

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, but it seems me you've

7

got us off galloping in the wrong direction.

8

statute doesn't require simply giving the same access

9

that you give to other employers.

The

It requires much

10

more than that.

11

or cuts off, funds if an institution either prohibits

12

or, in effect, prevents the Secretary of a military

13

department from gaining access to campuses for purposes

14

of military recruiting in a manner that is at least

15

equal in quality and scope to the access to campuses

16

and to students that is provided to any other employer.

17

So, it seems to me that the statute demands more than

18

simply you give the same access as all other employers.

19

If you allow any other employer, you have to give it

20
21

It requires that they -- it prohibits,

to the military in the same manner.

debate

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, but it is an important

3

question, because the -- there is an amicus brief that

4

says, "Go read the statute."

5

was not about homosexuals in the military, it was a

6

statute about universities in Vietnam not letting

7

military people on campus.

8

of the statute was a matter which was unique to the

9

military.

And, really, the statute

So, in the -- at the heart

Now, this is a matter that isn't unique to

10

the military.

11

way that the amicus brief suggests in order to avoid a

12

difficult constitutional question?

13

So, why not interpret the statute in the

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, a couple of points,

14

Justice Breyer.

15

constitutional question to be avoided here, and I'll

16

get back to that whenever I can.

17

I don't think there is a difficult

As to the statutory-interpretation question

18

itself, I think that in -- the proper frame of

19

reference here is probably not the original 1969

20

version of this, which conditioned only NASA's fund.

21

The original starting point is probably about 1996,

22

when the first version of the modern Solomon Amendment

23

was introduced.

24

iterations of it, but I think one important reference

25

point is the version that was in force at the start of

And there have been a couple of

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1

this litigation, and that's actually reproduced at page

2

88(a) of the petition appendix in the District Court

3

opinion.

4

petition appendix, there would be no question that what

5

is at stake here is access to the campus, and the

6

amicus argument that's being raised is not even

7

available; because the statute at that point is, I

8

think, in fairness, materially identical, except for

9

that last clause, which says "in a manner equal in

And if you look at that against 88(a) of the

10

scope to -- in character to that of any other

11

institution."

12

starts, there's no argument available to the amicus

13

that the statute effectively accomplishes nothing.

14

So, it's clear that when this litigation

Now, what happens under this version of the

15

statute is, a second-order question arises.

16

-- in order to comply with the Solomon Amendment,

17

universities have to give access, they have to allow

18

the military to gain entry and gain access to the

19

students in the terms of the then-extant statute.

GENERAL CLEMENT:

As a regulatory matter, the

2

military took the position that if they simply barred

access to --

JUSTICE STEVENS:

No --

GENERAL CLEMENT:

-- anybody --

6

JUSTICE STEVENS:

-- not the regulatory

7

The statute.

8

GENERAL CLEMENT:

I think you could read the

9

statute either way on that question, Justice Stevens.

10

They interpreted it to say that there was no equal --

11

there is no obligation to give entry if no employer was

12

on campus at that time.

13

The other thing they interpreted in the

14

statute as a regulatory matter, though, was this

15

second-order question of, "All right, if they get some

16

access, is unequal access enough?"

17

matter, they said, "No.

18

in character and scope to that provided to any other

19

employer."

20

of the statute that's at issue here, which is

21

reproduced starting at page 185(a) of the petition

22

appendix is they effectively codified and ratified that

23

regulatory interpretation by adding the phrase "in a

24

manner that is at least as equal in quality and scope

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

GENERAL CLEMENT:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

General -But I think --- Clement, do I

5

understand, with respect to that brief that offered a

6

statutory interpretation to avoid a constitutional

7

question, your answer is, that would be an unreasonable

8

interpretation of the statute that we now have?

9

we're talking about a predecessor statute in 1968, from

10

the Vietnam days, that -- this would have been a highly

11

academic question, because there weren't any such

12

policies in any law schools with respect to recruiting.

13

GENERAL CLEMENT:

And if

No, that's true, Justice

14

Ginsburg.

15

Breyer, that I think that the proper point to start to

16

focus on is the -- these -- is the 1994 Solomon

17

Amendment.

18

about this policy.

1

There's no question that what's at issue here

2

is more than just the Vietnam-era concerns about ROTC

3

presence on statute, because that's addressed in a

4

different subsection of the statute.

5

in 10 U.S.C. 983(a).

6

U.S.C. 983(b) is specifically addressed at the problem

7

of access to campuses for recruiting.

8

especially when you read the statute in light of the

9

relevant history of the prior administrative

That's addressed

So this provision, 10 90- -- 10

And, I think,

10

interpretation, and that being codified and ratified by

11

Congress, it's very clear that this phrase "in a manner

12

that is at least equal in quality and scope to the

13

access provided to any other employer," is just that,

14

it's a regulation of the manner of access, once access

15

is granted.

16

of, If you allow some entry and access onto campus,

17

what level of access is sufficient?

18

that --

19
20

And it addresses this difficult question

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And so, I think

What does Title X of the

United States Code deal with?

21

GENERAL CLEMENT:

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It deals with the military.
Why do you chose to defend

23

this principally on the basis of the Spending Clause,

24

and not on the basis of what it -- what it was, seemed

25

to me, enacted in order to achieve, and that is the

12
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

congressional power to raise and support armies.

2

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Scalia, I

3

think the statute is clearly supported under both

4

provisions, under the spending authority and the

5

Article I authority to raise and support armies.

6

think, in answering your question, we tended to focus

7

on the fact that it was a spending condition, because

8

we thought, under this Court's precedence, that made it

9

an even more straightforward case.

I

We certainly think

10

it would be constitutional, even if it were a direct

11

imposition, and we certainly think the fact that this

12

is an exercise of Congress's undoubted authority to

13

raise and support an army, is relevant to the

14

constitutional analysis.

15

And if I could move over to the

16

constitutional question and address that for a minute,

17

I think one of the arguments that's raised on the other

18

side is that there's an interference with associational

19

interests in this case, and I think there are other

20

statutes that, frankly, have much more of an

21

interference with a university's associational

22

interest.

23

who can be members of the university.

24

also because another provision in Title -- in terms of

25

this same area of the military, requires that there not

I mean, Title VII, for example, regulates

be discrimination against veterans in hiring and

2

employment.

3

could take their position to its logical conclusion and

4

say, "In order to show just how much we don't like the

5

military's policy, we're not only going to not let

6

military recruiters on campus, but we are going to not

7

hire former military people, veterans, and we're not

going to admit them to our classes."

does not fit --

17

So, I think that your example

Ginsburg, I'm not sure I understand why not.

same idea.

20

should be no discrimination against homosexuals, we're

21

going to exclude, (a), military recruiters, and, while

22

we're at it, the former military, as well, because they

23

voluntarily joined the forces knowing that they had a

24

discriminatory practice.

25

imagination to think that the principle that's being

It's the

It's no stretch of the

14
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

articulated by Respondents, would stretch well beyond

2

simply a direct antidiscrimination motive.

3

For example, NYU -- this is in the joint appendix,

4

at page 153 -- NYU, for 3 years, had a policy of

5

excluding recruiters from the State of Colorado, simply

6

because Colorado had passed Amendment II, which this

7

Court dealt with in the Romer case.

8

matter of saying that, "Well, you know, the only think

9

that's at issue here is excluding employers that are,

And so, it's not a

10

themselves, discriminatory."

11

that are articulated on the other side, would extend to

12

any basis for criticizing the military, whether it was

13

not liking the war in Iraq, the war in Afghanistan, or

14

the discriminatory hiring policies.

15

The free-speech interests

I also think, with respect to the issue of

16

discrimination, it's worth pointing out here that

17

there's more than one way to understand whether or not

18

the military's policy is discriminatory.

19

respondents are entitled to view it as being

20

discriminatory.

21

same policy towards homosexuals, I think, is equally

22

entitled to look at it and say, "No, there's no

23

discrimination going on here, because you have to take

24

into account the special role of the military."

25

Certainly

But the Congress that mandates this

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay, but even if you do

15
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

that, you're still left, it seems to me, with the

2

problem -- whether you characterize the problem as

3

discriminatory and antidiscriminatory university policy

4

or not, you're still left with a speech problem that

5

they raise, that, in effect, you are forcing them, in

6

effect, to underwrite your speech, up to a point, and

7

you are forcing them to change their own message.

8

You're forcing them into hypocrisy, in one alternative.

9

And those arguments don't depend upon the -- sort of,

10

the discriminatory character of what may be at stake.

11

GENERAL CLEMENT:

I think that's exactly

12

right Justice Souter, and I think those arguments would

13

be the same even if what was going on here was a

14

concern about the military's other policies.

15

still have a concern that the military is being forced

16

onto campus to make its own speech, and you would still

17

have the concern that that interferes with the message

18

--

So, discrimination --- the university --- or no discrimination,

you've got a speech issue that you're going to address.
GENERAL CLEMENT:

I agree.

I mean, I think,

24

ultimately, that cuts in our favor, because it shows

25

that the other side's position is not limited to this

16
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

narrow context, but is a much broader first-amendment

2

claim.

3

Now, turning to that first-amendment claim, I

4

think what's wrong with that claim is several things.

5

I think, with respect to what the military itself

6

wants, it simply does not want a -- primarily a speech

7

activity to take place, it wants access for recruiting,

8

which is a traditional commercial enterprise, it is an

9

activity that is something that is regulated by Title

10

VII in other Federal statutes.

11

incidental speech involved in that, but primarily it is

12

an instrumental activity designed to get --

GENERAL CLEMENT:

It does, indeed, Justice

Scalia, and I think, though -- I mean, there is this

17

sense in which we certainly concede that there maybe

18

some incidental speech involved; certainly,

19

military recruiters are engaged in speech.

20

we're not sure that's really the relevant speech.

21

even the university itself --

22

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I'm -But

No, but you're making a --

23

if I understand what you're saying, you are making a

kind of O'Brien argument that the -- that the burden on

that they are really disagreeing with what's going on

13

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Stevens, I

14

would say, to the -- I think, the main thrust of your

15

question, no, which is to say that if what you have in

16

mind is really forcing them to go to the undergraduate

17

campus, I think the military would take the position

18

that that's not equal in scope.

19

though --

20

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Now, if there's a way,

21

of the message it sends or because it denies the

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I think that that's an

13

extraordinary position you're taking.

14

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, but, Justice Kennedy,

15

I think you have to distinguish what the Constitution

16

would allow the Government to do and what this statute

17

does, which is to say -- I mean, what you have in mind

18

is a --

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

We're talking --

20

GENERAL CLEMENT:

-- race example --

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

-- about the practical

22

meaning of "equal access."

23

GENERAL CLEMENT:

24
25

Right, but in -- the

practical meaning has to turn on the statute at issue.
And Title VI, for example, in the race context,

27
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

some of the conduct that you have in mind may well

violate that statute.

different statute that provides more rights to the

5

military, we would be here defending it as valid first-

6

amendment legislation.

7

right to be free of any discrimination, but a right to

8

equal access.

9

that inquiry is say, "Access, yes, but be respectful of

10

And so,

And if Congress wants to write a

But this statute gives, not a

And we think that the right way to frame

speech."

11

And the last thing I would say, if I could

12

reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal, is simply

13

that it's worth remembering that the recruiting office

14

is not the heart of first-amendment activity on campus.

15

And if the recruiting office acts in a way that

16

ensures access, and the rest of the university engages

17

in speech, that's a common sense way to accommodate the

18

interest of the military recruiters and the first

19

amendment.

20

If I may reserve.

the first-amendment rights of those who want to enter

If this was not

10

And that's precisely what we have here.

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

defers to Congress, in matters of the military, when

there is a need of some kind to get the military in.

And what the Government in this statute asks you --

7

because I, personally, couldn't find anything in the

8

record that finds that student who thinks, by letting

9

the military person in, that that school, which

10

basically is completely against the military in this

area, suddenly becomes for it.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

GENERAL CLEMENT:

3

Justice.

4

rebuttal.

Thank you, Mr. Chief

I'd like to make just a few points in

5

First of all, in starting with the compelled-

6

speech problem, there are only two kinds of speech that

7

are at issue here.

8

speech of the military recruiters.

9

that that speech is being misattributed to the schools.

10

Even in the secondary-school context, in Mergens, this

First, there is the compelled
And no one thinks

11

Court understood that secondary students could

12

distinguish between the school's message and that of

13

school groups.

14

Now, the second piece of speech that's at

15

issue is that of the university, when they incidentally

16

send an e-mail around telling the students where the

17

military recruiters are going to be on a certain day.

18

And certainly in the context of recruiting, that kind

19

of incidental speech does not implicate any compelled-

20

speech doctrine.

21

example, if an employer says that there's a job

22

opening, and says that to a white applicant, it has to

23

say the same thing to an African-American applicant.

24

Nobody would think that that other -- saying that to

25

the African-American applicant, which is, of course,

In the Title VII context, for

61
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

compelled speech by Title VII, violates the

2

Constitution.

3

I would also say, just as the last point on

4

compelled speech, that it's something of a stranger in

5

a strange land in the context of this case, since we

6

are talking about a funding condition, not a

7

compulsion.

8

Second, let me move to the argument that the

9

Respondents have about trying to distinguish this case

10

from Justice Stevens' World War II hypothetical.

11

as I understand it, it boils down to the argument that

12

the way that the legislature was reacting here to this

13

problem and observing what it observed on campus

14

somehow implicates different constitutional issues,

15

different first-amendment issues.

16

O'Brien case stands as an obstacle to that argument.

17

In that case, if you look at it, the argument was

18

exactly the same.

19

required you to have your draft card with you.

20

Congress then passed a second statute that prohibited

21

burning your draft card.

22

And,

And I think the

There already was a prohibition that

Now, what did the Representatives say about

23

that?

24

this was an effort to get at "communist stooges and

25

beatniks."

Well, Representative Bray, of Indiana, said that

2

statute and upheld the statute as a reasonable statute.

3

It looked at the text of the

Let me also, then, move to what you could

4

call the "Bob Jones problem."

5

have be cautious about interpreting this statute in

6

applying a rule and having it come back in the context

7

of other statutes that even the law schools like, like

8

Title VI and Title IX.

9

simply say that race is going to be different.

And I think you have to

I don't think it's enough to
For one

10

thing, Federal statutes also prohibit, as a condition

11

on funding, universitywide discrimination on the basis

12

of disability and on the basis of age.

13

aren't things that trigger heightened scrutiny, and I

14

think one has to be worried about converting this rule

15

in this case to something that's going to threaten

16

those statutes.

17

Now, those

This Court, in Hishon, for example, made the

18

point that all discrimination can be recharacterized as

19

somebody simply saying -- exercising their

20

associational rights, "I don't want to associate with

21

you, because you're female," in Hishon.

22

leery of that kind of recharacterization.

23

You have to be

The last point I would make is that there's

24

simply no limit on Respondent's argument in this case.

25

I don't think their matter of conscious limitation is

63
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

going to be enforceable by the courts.

2

that, I think, even in this case, there is more at

3

issue here than just the military's policy on

4

homosexuals.

5

the American Association of Law Schools -- which is in

6

the joint appendix at 246 and 249

7

concerned, first and foremost, about the military's

8

policies on homosexuals, but also about the

9

discrimination in sex, on what kind of combat roles

13

schools would still be here protesting the military's

14

position on gender, or perhaps the war in Iraq, or

15

perhaps the war in Afghanistan.

16

So, even if Congress changed "don't ask,

And the last point in showing there is no

17

limits on their position is, as Justice Kennedy pointed

18

out, any conduct can be imbued with communicative force

19

just by saying, "We're opposed to this, and, therefore,

20

we're going to engage in this conduct."

21

not enough to generate a significant first-amendment

22

interest.
