ORAL ARGUMENT OF M. REED HOPPER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS IN NO. 04-1034

11

MR. HOPPER:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:
This is a case of agency overreaching.

In

12

this case, the Corps and EPA pushed the very limits of

13

congressional authority, contrary to the plain text of

14

the act and without any clear indication Congress

15

intended that result.

16

over the entire tributary system, from the smallest

17

trickle to the largest watershed, swapping in --

18

sweeping in remote, non-navigable wetlands 20 miles

19

from the traditional navigable water.

20

They claim 404(a) jurisdiction

This limitless claim of jurisdiction shifts

21

the Federal/State balance and raises significant

22

constitutional questions.

23

interpretation is inconsistent with this Court's

24

reading of the act in Solid Waste Agency.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

We believe this boundless

It goes somewhat beyond the

3
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

smallest trickle?

2

ditches that currently don't have any trickle if they

3

obtain a trickle during a rainstorm?

4

Doesn't it?

MR. HOPPER:

Doesn't it also include

Yes, Your Honor.

They actually

5

argued that it -- it makes no difference whether there

6

-- what the substantiality is or the directness of the

7

connection is.

8

determination.

9

It's irrelevant to the jurisdictional

And as I said, they -- the -- the agencies

10

assert jurisdiction over even the entire watershed.

11

For example, the Mississippi watershed, the largest in

12

the Nation, covers 1 million square acre -- 1 million

13

square miles and reaches from the Rockies to the

14

Appalachians and drains 41 percent of the 48 lower

15

States.

16
17
18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So where would you --

where would -- where would you put the line?
MR. HOPPER:

I'd put the line where Congress

19

put the line, Your Honor.

20

that it would prohibit the discharge of fill and

21

dredged material into the navigable waters.

22

these agencies can permit or prohibit any discharge, no

23

matter where it occurs, so long as it reaches a

24

navigable water.

25

Congress declared in 404(a)

So the --

That would be the --

case-by-case basis.

14

contrary to the regulation of -- of wetlands that are

15

inseparably bound up.

16

that Congress intended to regulate any tributaries, let

17

alone the entire tributary system.

18

The regulation of all tributaries

And there's no clear indication

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, is your position no

19

tributaries or some tributaries?

20

MR. HOPPER:

The -- the act, by its terms,

21

does not recognize the -- the regulation of any

22

tributary.

23

It does -JUSTICE ALITO:

Does it make sense to say

24

that any wetlands that it abuts a traditionally

25

navigable water is covered, but a tributary that leads

5
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

right into a traditionally navigable water is not

2

necessarily covered?

3

MR. HOPPER:

I think -- I think it's fair to

4

say that under this Court's determination in Solid

5

Waste Agency that the only wetlands that are covered

6

are those that are abutting and inseparably bound up.

7

It makes sense to do so because by regulating those

8

types of wetlands, the Government is essentially

9

declaring them the equivalent of the navigable

10

waterway.

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yes, but they're doing it

12

for a functional reason.

13

if you put the poison in the adjacent wetland, it's

14

going to get into the navigable water.

15

same argument can be made as you go further and further

16

up the tributaries, and it seems to me that once you

17

concede, as I think you have to, that there can be a

18

regulation that goes beyond literally navigable water

19

at the point at which the -- the pollutant is added,

20

then you have to follow the same logic right up through

21

the watershed to -- to any point at which a pollutant,

22

once added, will eventually get into the navigable

23

water.

24
25

MR. HOPPER:

The functional reason is that

Exactly the

The reason that logic does not

apply, Your Honor, is because the regulation of -- of

2

that are not implicated by the regulation of a wetland

3

inseparably --

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Then -- then you have to

5

accept the fact that -- that Congress cannot

6

effectively regulate the navigable -- the -- the

7

condition of the navigable water itself because if all

8

the -- the -- let's -- let's assume there's a class of

9

-- of evil polluters out there who just want to wreck

10

the -- the navigable waters of the United States.

11

they have to do is get far enough upstream and they can

12

dump anything they want to.

13

into the navigable water, and Congress can't do

14

anything about it on your theory.

15

MR. HOPPER:

It will eventually get

That's incorrect, Your Honor.

16

We acknowledge that under the -- the act, the

17

Government can regulate any discharge that actually

18

reaches the navigable water.

19

All

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So you're -- you're going to

20

-- you -- you then want to draw a distinction between

21

the dredge and fill addition and, let's say, a -- a

22

conventional synthetic poison.

23

MR. HOPPER:

No.

Either -- in either case,

24

if -- if the -- if the discharge of dredged material

25

actually enters into a navigable water, regardless of

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

JUSTICE SOUTER:

You mean on -- on -- in

every -- in every case then, I mean, Congress would

5

have to -- I'm sorry -- a scientist would have to

6

analyze the molecules and -- and trace them up, and so

7

long as they could -- could trace it to a specific

8

discharge, they could get at it, but otherwise they

9

couldn't?

I mean, that -- you know, you know what I'm

10

getting at.

thwart the regulation.

That obviously would -- would totally

The -- the -- certainly Congress

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Couldn't you simply assume

16

that anything that is discharged into a tributary

17

ultimately goes where the tributary goes?

18

be enough to prove the discharge?

19

MR. HOPPER:

Wouldn't it

Well, it certainly wasn't true

20

in this case, Your Honor.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The -So you don't think it would

22

be enough for the -- for the Government to prove the

23

discharge into a tributary in order to prove that the

24

act has been violated.

No, Your Honor, I do not.

MR. HOPPER:

Absolutely.

what the terms of the act require.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

How do you -- how do

you define a tributary?
MR. HOPPER:

Well, the -- that's one of the

8

problems here, Your Honor, is that -- is that the

9

agency has -- has established a moving target for --

for tributaries.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So what's your

definition?
MR. HOPPER:

Well, the -- the definitions

we're working with here, to which we object, is that --

15

is that it includes anything in the hydrological

16

connection.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I know what you

18

object to, and I know that you think your client isn't

19

covered. But I don't know what test you would have us

20

adopt for what constitutes a tributary.

MR. HOPPER:

Well, we're suggesting that --

that this Court need not define tributary because under

23

the act all tributaries are excluded.

to define significant nexus.

just to say, well, this case is too much, but then the

18

determined that the act was clear and should be read as

written to avoid the constitutional questions raised by

a broad interpretation of the act.

9

In -- in SWANCC, this Court

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

As written --

From everything -- from

10

everything you said, it sounds like you're -- you're

11

taking issue with Riverside Bayview because if a

12

wetland adjacent to the river counts, then why not a

13

stream that goes right into it?

14

distinction make?

15

MR. HOPPER:

What sense does that

It makes perfect sense, Your

16

Honor, because the regulation of those tributaries and

17

streams, all of them in the entire tributary system,

18

raise significant constitutional questions that are not

19

implicated by regulating wetlands that are inseparably

20

bound up with traditional navigable water.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

More than that, Mr. Hopper.

22

I thought and I had expected you to -- to respond to

23

Justice Souter's question this way, his question about

24

how come putting poison in -- in the wetlands is bad,

25

but it's okay to put it in the tributary.

But they --

11
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

as I understand it, the reason we held wetlands were

2

included within the waters of the United States was not

3

-- not that, that you could poison the waters by

4

poisoning the wetlands, but rather, it was that it's

5

very hard to tell where the navigable water ends and

6

the wetland begins.

7

we're not going to parse that.

8

adjacent to a navigable water and it's wet, we're going

9

to say it's part of a navigable water.

And -- and we said, you know,

10

MR. HOPPER:

12

If it's -- if it's

I thought that was our

basis.

Court.

The Court did frame the question
However, the Court's commentary

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

At any rate, they could

7

not have been making the distinction Justice Scalia

8

suggested if, at least in the Court's thinking, the

9

tributaries rolled right into the navigable body.

10

MR. HOPPER:

Well, as I said, the -- the

11

Court's commentary in Riverside Bayview is not good law

12

because the -- the Court was not addressing the -- a

13

tributary's question in that case, and it was not faced

14

with a Commerce Clause challenge as it is in this case.

15

And at that time, the agency did not interpret

16

tributaries to include every hydrological reach of the

17

-- of the tributary system.

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yes, but doesn't the

19

reference to tributary make it relatively plain that

20

what the Court was getting at was the impossibility of

21

drawing a functional distinction between wetlands and

22

tributaries on the one hand, navigable waters on the

23

other, when the purpose of the regulation is to protect

24

the purity of the ultimate navigable water?

25

the inclusion of the reference to tributaries an

indication that it said if we want to attain the

2

objective, which is clearly constitutional, then we

3

have got to recognize these means, i.e., regulation of

4

-- of pollution in wetlands and tributaries, in order

5

to reach that objective?

6

is apparent from what Justice Ginsburg just -- just

7

read to you?

8
9

MR. HOPPER:

Isn't that the reasoning that

I don't believe so, Your Honor.

The -- the problem that -- that the agencies have in

10

this case, which was underscored in Solid Waste Agency,

11

is that the Government cannot show any clear indication

12

that Congress intended to regulate the entire tributary

13

system.

14

recognize that because of congressional acquiescence,

15

Congress intended to regulate wetlands adjacent to

16

navigable waters, but as to other waters, this Court

17

could come to no conclusion because the Congress had

18

never defined other waters.

19

In Solid Waste Agency, this Court did

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, it's -- except for the

argument is -- is fine except for one problem.

22

that is, if we -- if we assume that Congress was being

caution, in effect, was -- was allowing an end run

13

in -- in 1251(a)(1), it says it will accomplish this by

14

eliminating the discharge of pollutants into the

15

navigable waters, showing that it knows how to

16

distinguish between all waters and navigable waters.

17

And then in 1251(b), Congress says we will respect and

defer to the States' primary responsibility to address

19

local water pollution and to manage local land and

water use.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS IN NO. 04-1384
MR. STOEPKER:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it

please the Court:
After years of review by the State of

18

Michigan and the Respondent, the record is very clear.

19

Petitioners' wetland is hydrologically isolated from

20

any navigable water of the United States.

21

Further, the State of Michigan, exercising

22

the power specifically and traditionally reserved to

23

it, undertook responsibility to regulate the waters at

24

issue and pollution and, in doing so, issued Petitioner

25

a wetland permit.

Referring to the appendix filed, the joint

inseparable, bound-up nature of those wetlands which

were immediately adjacent to the navigable water.

is that it -- it be a water of the United States.

Isn't that right?

The condition for requiring permits

It either is or it

If it is, you -- you need a permit; if it

isn't, you don't need a permit.

11

MR. STOEPKER:

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

That is correct.
And Justice Stevens'

13

question I think in -- in that framework is -- is this.

14

If it will result in discharge after the project, is

15
16
17
18

it a water of the United States now?
MR. STOEPKER:

Under the Court's definition

in SWANCC and Riverside, the answer again is no.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

Then -- then Congress has

19

passed a statute that says we'll lock the barn after

20

the horse is stolen.

21

it did, but that's -- that would be a very odd thing

22

for it to do, wouldn't it?

23

I mean, that -- maybe that's what

MR. STOEPKER:

It did not do so, Your Honor,

24

because specifically under section 1251(b), it reserved

25

to the States the primary responsibility of regulating

1-800-FOR-DEPO

2

responsibility.

3

designated to the Respondent in this case.

4

would -- in -- in that framework would shift the

5

primary responsibility to the Respondent and take that

6

primary responsibility away from the State.

7

The primary

That primary responsibility is not

JUSTICE SOUTER:

A shift

Well, it -- it would do so

8

in -- in cases of -- I guess, of the -- the sorts of --

9

of new proposed actions that require the -- the Corps

10

to get into it in the first place.

11

that it would leave lots of -- of water pollution

12

regulation to the States.

13

displace the States.

14
15
16

MR. STOEPKER:

But I also assume

I don't see that it would

In this case, it actually --

the decision of the Respondent did displace the State.
The State, after years of examination and

17

determination of impact, made a decision to issue a

18

wetland permit to this project and, in doing so, found

19

specifically that the issuance of the permit would be

20

better, effective method of dealing with pollution than

21

not issuing the permit.

22

made by the administrative law judge in that appendix,

23

and those findings are the first part of the appendix

24

in this case, detailed findings after a 2-week

25

administrative trial where witnesses were cross

That was the specific finding

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

1

examined and examined.

2

In this case, the Respondent has ignored

3

those State powers given to its traditional waters and

4

has said, we're going to ignore, number one, your claim

5

of jurisdiction, and number two, we're going to ignore

6

your finding of no impact and completely disregard

7

that.

8
9

So, in fact, the framework in this case did
shift.

The State did what it was supposed to do under

10

1251(b) and the -- the Respondent in this case usurped

11

that responsibility and those traditional powers

12

granted to it traditionally and both by this statute,

13

and then determined that what the State of Michigan did

14

had no relevance.

15

framework in this case did specifically change.

16

It was unwarranted.

So the

And in doing so, we get back to those same

17

factual findings they've made.

18

because they found that it is adjacent to a ditch which

19

they have said is not a waters of the United States.

20

So in this case, the --

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

We are here only today

And the only reason it's a

22

23

MR. STOEPKER:

That's correct, because

there's some puddles on the land occasionally.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So it -- it becomes waters

4

of the United States because there are puddles on it,

5

and you assert because those puddles have some

6

hydrological connection or if it is -- if it is water

7

of the United States, those puddles have some

8

hydrological connections with the navigable waters.

9

MR. STOEPKER:

To -- to be waters of the

United States, they would have to have a hydrological

11

connection as a minimum test to be a part of the waters

12

of the United States.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And -- and the -- the

14

statute only prohibits the discharge of dredged or fill

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

10

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

11
12

Thank you, counsel.

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

13

In United States against Riverside Bayview

14

Homes, this Court unanimously upheld the Corps'

15

jurisdiction over wetlands that were not themselves

16

navigable, but were adjacent to waters otherwise within

17

the Corps' jurisdiction.

18

The principal difference between the Rapanos

19

wetlands and the wetlands at issue in Riverside Bayview

20

are that the Rapanos wetlands are adjacent to a non

21

navigable tributary, while the wetlands at issue in

22

Riverside Bayview were adjacent to a navigable creek.

23
24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

How do you define

tributary?

say they're adjacent to a nonnavigable tributary.

3

That's a -- a culvert, a ditch.

GENERAL CLEMENT:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But in Rapanos'

case.

9

Well, not in all these cases,

Mr. Chief Justice.

Right?

GENERAL CLEMENT:
actually not true.

No, not -- not -- that's

There are three specific wetlands

10

that are at issue in the Rapanos case.

11

the Pine River site, as its name suggests, is adjacent

12

to the Pine River, which is a body of water that has

13

water flowing through it all year-round.

One of those,

It's a river.

14

I don't think anybody would look at that and say

15

that's not a tributary of the downstream navigable

16

rivers.

17
18
19
20
21

And I think that's why, in fairness -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What about -- what

about the other -- the other sites?
GENERAL CLEMENT:

The -- the other sites are --

are adjacent to man-made ditches that also drain in.
If I just -- can I just say, though, I think

22

the fact that the Pine River site is so obviously a

23

tributary under -- under any definition is one of the

24

reasons, along with the theory that you heard advanced

25

by Petitioners, that this case --

Alderson Reporting Company

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But your argument

2

assumes that the ditches that go to the other two sites

3

are also tributaries.

4

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Absolutely, Mr. Chief Justice.

5

I just want to make the point that this case, because

6

of the theory Petitioners have advanced, has not really

7

unearthed or focused on the definition of a tributary,

8

but let me get to it because the Corps has defined the

9

definition of a tributary.

And the definition of a

10

tributary is basically any channelized body of water

11

that takes water in a flow down to the traditional

12

navigable water --

13
14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Even when it's not a body of

water.

15

GENERAL CLEMENT:

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Even -A storm drain, even -- even

17

when it's not filled with water, is a tributary.

18

Right?

19

GENERAL CLEMENT:

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

21

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Justice Scalia, absolutely.
Okay.
The Corps has not drawn a

22

distinction between man-made channels or ditches and

23

natural channels or ditches.

24

be very absurd for the Corps to do that since the Erie

25

Canal is a ditch.

And, of course, it would

2

to call that waters of the United States.

6

GENERAL CLEMENT:

It's a

To call that

Well, let me say two things,

Justice Scalia.

litigated under the theory that the key difference is

9

whether it's man-made or natural, and that defines

First of all, this case has not been

10

somehow the scope of a tributary.

11

a good reason for that, which is the second point,

12

which is as the Corps experts -- from the experts of the

13

Corps will tell you, the process of making the natural

14

rivers navigable has all been about the process of

15

channelizing them and creating man-made, artificial

16

channels in them to the point where the difference

17

between that which is a man-made channel and that which

18

is a natural channel is both difficult to discern and

19

utterly beside the point for purposes of this

20

regulatory scheme.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And I think there's

What -- what percentage of

22

the -- of the territory of the United States do you

believe is -- is subjected to permits from the Corps of

GENERAL CLEMENT:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I mean, it's the whole

Well -All the water goes down to

7

the sea and there's some kind of a drain or -- or a bed

8

that takes the water down there.

9

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, I think the precise

10

answer to your question being none of the land mass --

11

none of the land itself would be regulated.

12

terms of -- you want to talk about the --

13
14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You're calling empty ditches

But in

Well, the -- the Corps doesn't.

I understand that.
And that's not the gravamen of

the complaint here.
But just to be responsive to your question, I

21

think it's important to understand that the Corps and

22

the EPA's view of wetlands would cover about 80 percent

23

of the wetlands in the country.

24

the impact of this Court's decision in SWANCC was real

25

and substantial because about 20 percent of the

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But -- but you -- that's

just because this statute happens to refer to wetlands.

But under your theory, the Corps of Engineers would

have jurisdiction over any land that is part of that

tributary system as well.

deposit of -- of some materials that could leach into

or -- or drain into the -- the tributary system, which

9

is to say any gutter, in theory, the -- the Federal

14

regard to whether those channels are seasonally dry in

15

some areas, and I think that's a rational judgment.

16

It's not been the gravamen of this case, though.

17

what's important is while the Corps and the Federal

18

Government regulate that channelized system of

tributaries, non-point source pollution is still

1

rivers or their tributaries are within the scope of

2

this program, as it did in 1899 in section 13 of the

3

Rivers and Harbors Act, we'd be here defending that as

4

a valid exercise of Congress' authority not just under

5

the Commerce Clause, but under the navigation power of

6

the --

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But in 1899, it just said

8

navigable rivers, not -- not every -- every tributary

9

defined to include even storm drains.

10

GENERAL CLEMENT:

No.

With respect, Justice

11

Scalia, in 1899 in section 13 of the Rivers and Harbors

12

Act, the so-called Refuse Act, Congress regulated the

13

navigable waters and their tributaries.

14

fairness, the focus there was this idea that they only

15

regulated the tributaries if they could show that it

16

flowed into the navigable waters themselves, but they

17

asserted right in the text of the statute in 1899 the

18

authority to regulate the tributaries and the banks.

19
20
21

Now, in

And that shows what I think is a very
important difference between this case and SWANCC.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But your -- your theory is

22

there is regulatory authority because there's an

23

interaction between the wetlands or the lands in

24

question and the navigable waters.

25

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Justice Kennedy, that's not

43
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

precisely accurate.

2

this.

3

The way it would describe it is

As to the first question you have to ask,

4

which is are the tributaries covered, we think an

5

important component of describing the reach of the

6

tributary system is whether there's a hydrological

7

connection.

8

of the regulatory definition that brings within the

9

scope of waters of the United States tributaries.

10

On the second -- and that's subsection (5)

Then you get to the second question which

11

actually implicates another subsection of the

12

definition, subsection (7), which is the adjacent

13

wetlands.

14

Carabell case illustrates, the definition does not turn

15

on hydrological connection for purposes of asserting

16

the Corps' jurisdiction.

17

And as to the adjacent wetlands, as the

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but -- but wasn't --

18

wasn't the reason for including the adjacent wetlands

19

because of -- of the likelihood of an interaction?

20

GENERAL CLEMENT:

I think they -- they were

21

included for the likelihood of an interaction both

22

hydrologically and otherwise.

23

I would say two important things, though.

24

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

25

Well, let -- well, please

finish.

44
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

GENERAL CLEMENT:

The two points I would make is,

2

first of all, I think the Corps' regulations, which for

3

30 years have ignored the premise -- the -- the

4

presence of a berm, are rational because in the vast,

5

vast majority of cases, that berm is not going to

6

prevent a hydrological connection, so to speak.

7

a test that focuses, first and foremost, on physical

8

proximity is a very rational jurisdictional test.

And so

9

The second thing I would say, though, is it's

10

simply not true that even in the rare case where a berm

11

or a dike prevents all hydrological connection, that an

12

adjacent wetland will not perform an important function

13

for the adjacent water body.

14

is the flood control possibility of the wetland.

15

And the most obvious one

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well -- well, as you

16

mention that, you cited subsection (7), and there's a

17

-- what struck me anyway as a very interesting

18

provision in there.

19

waters other than waters that are themselves wetlands.

It covers wetlands adjacent to

20

Now, everything that you've said today and in your

21

brief would lead me to think you would contend that

22

wetlands that are adjacent to wetlands ought to be

23

covered as well, and yet, the regulation leaves them

24

out.

25

regulation leaves those wetlands out.

And I want to know why do you think the

45
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

GENERAL CLEMENT:

I -- I think, Mr. Chief

2

Justice, my own view is the reason that that caveat is

3

in subsection (7) is actually a vestige of the pre-

4

SWANCC scope of the regulation.

5

you look at subsection (3) of the definition which is

6

the isolated waters provision that was at issue, I

7

think, through the Migratory Bird Rule in SWANCC, that

8

includes wetlands in the available isolated waters.

9

And I think --

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And specifically, if

To me it -- it

11

suggests that even the Corps recognized that at some

12

point you've got to say stop because logically any drop

13

of water anywhere is going to have some sort of

14

connection through drainage.

15

stopping there, and I wonder if we ought to take that

16

same instinct that -- that you see in subsection (7)

17

and apply it to your definition of tributary and say,

18

at some point, the definition of tributary has to have

19

an end.

20

far, beyond what Congress reasonably intended.

21

And they're -- they're

Otherwise, you're going to go and reach too

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, several thoughts on that,

22

Mr. Chief Justice.

23

approach is that the reason why it makes sense to

24

regulate that very first tributary that flows into the

25

Mississippi is the reason that it makes sense to

I think the problem with that

Alderson Reporting Company

regulate the entire tributary system.

2

water is going to flow down into the navigable waters,

3

and if there's going to be --

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

All of that

But that's true of

5

the wetland that is adjacent to the wetland that is

6

adjacent to the tributary, and yet, the Corps says

7

we're not going to reach the wetland that is adjacent

8

to another wetland.

9

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, with respect, Mr. Chief

10

Justice, the way that I would read that and the way I

11

understand the Corps reads that is that was really just

12

trying to exclude a wetland adjacent to a wetland that

13

was a water of the United States only because of the

14

application of subsection (3).

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Your assumption --

16

GENERAL CLEMENT:

And I think that's -- that's

17

supported by the --

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

-- but this -- this is

19

preliminary to my question.

20

has to be a significant nexus.

21

have to show that there's some significant relation

22

between the wetlands you're regulating or seeking to

23

regulate and the navigable water.

24
25

GENERAL CLEMENT:

In SWANCC, we said there
It seems to me that you

I agree with that, Justice

Kennedy.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

1

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And I -- and that's just,

2

it seemed to me, so far been missing from the

3

discussion.

4

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, and I -- I guess there

5

is two ways to look at this.

6

significant nexus test and see if it's met.

7

the way that the Corps would naturally proceed is to

8

start with their definitions, and they would say

9

section -- subsection (5) covers tributaries.

You can start with the
I guess

And you

10

can ask the question, is there a significant nexus

11

between the tributaries and the navigable waters in

12

which they flow into?

13

is yes.

14

And I think the answer to that

And then there's the secondary question, as

15

to subsection (7) of the regulatory definition.

16

there a significant nexus between wetlands that are

17

adjacent to waters otherwise within the Corps'

18

jurisdiction, be they the traditional navigable waters

19

or their tributaries?

20

answered that question and said, yes, there is a

21

significant nexus between adjacent wetlands and any

22

otherwise regulable water body to which they are

23

adjacent.

Is

And I think Riverside Bayview

24

So that's the way we would ultimately satisfy

25

what this Court required, which is a significant nexus.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

I wouldn't have understood this Court's

2

decision to transplant the significant nexus test and

3

say, that's what the Corps should administer, because

4

whatever ambiguity there is in waters of the United

5

States, I think significant nexus is precisely the kind

6

of test you'd want the Corps --

7
8

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What -- what about the

Chief Justice's question, wetlands next to wetlands?

9

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, I -- I think that -- as I

10

said, I think what -- what the definition meant to get

11

at was to exclude wetlands adjacent to isolated

12

wetlands under subsection (3).

13

I think if you ask the question more broadly,

14

what about wetlands next to wetlands, I guess it

15

depends on what you mean by that because the one thing

16

we know from Riverside Bayview is that it's not a

17

requirement that the parcel and its wetlands be

18

immediately adjacent.

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but we didn't

20

come up with the idea of wetlands next to wetlands.

21

The Corps of Engineers has it in their regulations.

22

GENERAL CLEMENT:

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

24
25

And -So what do they mean

by it?
GENERAL CLEMENT:

are isolated wetlands under subsection (3).

only application it has in -- in the regulatory

structure, as they understand it.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It's the

What -- what is an

6

example of an insignificant nexus under the SWANCC

7

test?

8
9
10

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, I think it's the waters at issue in SWANCC, and I
think it's --

11

Under insignificant nexus?

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No.

There's no nexus

there.

13

GENERAL CLEMENT:

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, no -They're isolated.

15

There's no nexus.

16

significant nexus suggests that there are some bodies

17

of water or puddles that are going to have a nexus, but

18

it's not going to be significant enough.

19

just say any nexus.

20

what are you leaving out to give meaning to the test

21

that we articulated in SWANCC?

22

The -- the notion in SWANCC of a

GENERAL CLEMENT:

So

I'm leaving out everything that

this Court excluded in SWANCC, and I wouldn't have

argument of the Government in those cases was obviously

were utterly isolated.

way I read SWANCC is that we can't make that --

And I think the

So if you have a

wetland, you would say a wetland with a hydrological

9

connection to a tributary of navigable waters through

10

one drop a year is a significant nexus to the waters of

11

the United States?

12

GENERAL CLEMENT:

What I would say, Mr. Chief

13

Justice, is that if the tributary flows in.

14

start with the tributary, and I'd say, now, there's

15

clearly a significant nexus between the tributary and

16

the navigable waters to which it flows.

look at the wetland, and I would say for purposes of

18

the regulation of adjacent wetlands --

One drop.

For purposes of the adjacent

21

wetlands, it doesn't look to hydrological connection

resolve it with reference to footnote 9 in this Court's

opinion in Riverside Bayview, and I would say, all

the fly in the ointment.

carry off rainwater.

No.

You're

Well, Justice Scalia, I think

19

if you had in mind a tributary, you'd probably have in

20

mind the Pine River which is at issue in one of these

21

sites.

22

Petitioners have presented this case.

23

And I think that's why that's not the way

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Only because I don't know

24

how a storm drain is a water of the United States.

25

That's all.

I mean, all of these terms that you're

throwing around somehow have to come within a

2

reasonable usage of the term, waters of the United

3

States, and I do not see how a storm drain under

4

anybody's concept is a water of the United States.

5

GENERAL CLEMENT:

With respect, Justice Scalia,

6

some things that you might classify as a storm drain

7

are actually very deep channels that have a continuous

8

flow of water that were --

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No.

I was referring to a

real storm drain.

11

(Laughter.)

12

GENERAL CLEMENT:

13

(Laughter.)

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well --

Okay?
But therein is the problem,

16

which is some things that are part of the storm water

17

drainage system of a city are actually things that were

18

previous navigable natural waters.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I mean, so --

And some aren't.

But -- but

20

you would sweep them all into the jurisdiction of the

21

Corps of Engineers.

22

GENERAL CLEMENT:

We would, Justice Scalia, but I

23

guess if we can start with the proposition that

24

tributaries are covered and then some things that the

25

Corps thinks are tributaries you disagree with, that

53
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

would be fine.

2

That hasn't been the theory that this case has been

3

presented.

4

But that would be a different case.

As I understand, these drains here are

5

actually, you know, substantial channels that do have

6

water in them.

7

meets the test that it sounds like you would have for a

8

tributary, and the difficulty I'm having is I'd be

9

happy to defend what the Corps did if this Court, in

I have no doubt that the Pine River

10

the -- in the litigation of this case, had focused the

11

court's and the Corps' attention on that issue.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Am I right that a

13

tributary is not a defined term in the regulations?

14

Right?

GENERAL CLEMENT:

That's right.

It's an

undefined term.

21

and many of these issues.

22

The Corps has interpreted it in the
The best place to find the Corps'

And I guess what I would say is I think that

23

for purposes of this case, I mean, you heard the

Petitioners' argument.

25

the legal position they've advanced, not focused this

They have obviously, based on

54
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Court or any other court's attention on subdividing

2

which tributaries count because their view is nothing

3

counts.

4

think in this case what I would urge you to do, if --

5

if you have some concern with, you know, the extent of

6

the definition of tributaries, is to not make that a

7

basis for invalidating this -- the judgment of the

8

Sixth Circuit here.

9

developed in other cases if -- if the parties want to

10
11

Even the first tributary doesn't count.

And I

And that's an issue that could be

really focus the attention on that.
I think I would be comfortable defending the

12

Corps' judgment, even in those more finely focused

13

challenges, because I get back to the point, which is

14

that the same logic that has you regulate that first

15

tributary also suggests that you want to regulate

16

anything that's a channel that brings large quantities

17

of water into the navigable waterways.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, but that -- but that

19

doesn't follow.

20

that so long as the object is -- is lawful and within

21

the power of the United States, all means to which even

22

that object are lawful.

23

There are various means of stopping that pollution, and

24

it may well be that one of the means, which intrudes

25

too deeply into the State's power to regulate land

I mean, it is not a principle of law

That is simply not true.

55
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1

within their jurisdiction, is not a permissible one.

2

That -- that's not an extraordinary proposition.

3

GENERAL CLEMENT:

I absolutely agree with you,

4

Justice Scalia, and that's why I'm not up here asking

5

for Federal regulation over non-point source pollution,

6

although that obviously contributes to the -- to the

7

problem.

8

What I'm up here asking for is a recognition

9

that the tributary system is something that Congress

10

can validly regulate and did regulate in its broader

11

definition of waters of the United States in the Clean

12

Water Act.

13

authority to regulate tributaries is something Congress

14

regulated starting in 1899 and, importantly, this Court

15

expressly upheld in 1941 in Oklahoma against Atkinson.

16

And I think that's something -- the

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't see how non-point

17

source pollution is -- is any more remote from what the

18

Federal Government should be able to do to achieve its

19

ends than is a point source pollution that -- that

20

consists of -- of dumping sand on land that has some

21

puddles on it.

22

I -- that seems to me just as remote.

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, I think one important

23

thing to focus on, Justice Scalia, is this case is not

24

just about the Corps' 404 program because the 404

25

program by its terms does not permit anything.

As --

56
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

as the permit word suggests, it's a -- it's a process

2

of granting permission.

3

section 301 of the statute which prohibits a discharge

4

into the navigable waters without a permit.

5

whatever this Court decides for purposes of the 404

6

jurisdiction, it's necessarily deciding for purposes of

7

the 402 jurisdiction of the EPA.

The relevant provision here is

And so

8

And so what you'd be suggesting is that if

9

some tributaries aren't covered, then it's perfectly

10

okay to dump toxins in those tributaries even though

11

you know that because they are a channelized system

12

that directly connects with the navigable water --

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, that's not

14

really fair.

15

concede the discharges that make their way into the

16

navigable waters would be covered.

17

The Petitioners, as I understand it, both

GENERAL CLEMENT:

That's right, Mr. Chief

18

Justice, but there's only two ways to do that.

19

of doing that and the one that I hear them advocating

20

would be this impossible sort of process of trying to

21

fingerprint or DNA test oil spills in a tributary to

22

figure out, yes, that's the guy that got it to the

23

navigable waters.

24

there were some efforts to try to regulate pollution

25

that way before 1972 and they were a dismal failure.

One way

And the one thing we know is that

57
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

The only other way to do it, as suggested by

2

one or two amici, is to treat the last -- treat the

3

tributary as if it were a point source.

4

hate to be the guy who owns the -- the land next to

5

that tributary that's dumping into the Mississippi

6

who's going to be responsible for the pollution of

7

everybody upstream.

8

1972 is that they had to regulate beyond traditional

9

navigable waters.

10

But I'd sure

And what Congress recognized in

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But the Congress in 1972

11

also, in its statement of policy, said it's a statement

12

of policy to reserve to the States the power and the

13

responsibility to plan land use and water resources.

14

And under your definition, I -- I just see that we're

15

giving no scope at all to that clear statement of a

16

congressional policy.

17

GENERAL CLEMENT:

With respect, Justice Kennedy,

18

the States still have plenary control over the non-

19

point source pollution.

20

cooperative role in -- in the overall program, as

21

you'll hear more about in the second case today.

22

would actually ask you to focus on one particular

23

provision that deals with the relationship between the

24

Federal Government and the States under 404 in

25

particular, and that's section 404, subsection (g) of

They still have an important

1

the statute.

2

1977.

3

And that was added to the statute in

Unless Congress is going to be construed to

4

have given the States a virtual empty set, that

5

provision makes crystal clear that the waters of the

6

United States, for purposes of the Clean Water Act,

7

extend beyond traditional navigable waters and their

8

adjacent wetlands.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Though not necessarily as

10

far as storm drains.

11

navigable -- you know, non-navigable tributaries that

12

are real -- real tributaries.

13

It would be enough to -- to say

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Absolutely, Justice Scalia.

14

concede that.

15

defining real tributaries, and that's neither been teed

16

up in this litigation, nor is it something that I

17

think, at the end of the day, you'd want to differ from

18

the Corps' judgment, which although you find it

19

striking that some things that are ditches are actually

20

included in the system, that is a product of the way

21

that the tributary systems have worked, the way that

22

certain cities have taken over a natural stream and

23

channelized it and make it look like a ditch, but it's

24

part of the system that carries water down from the

25

headwaters.

I

But then you get to the question of

And again, maybe that's an issue that we

59
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

can try to divine the limits to in a subsequent case.

2

But I think what's important, as -- as your

3

very comments suggest, is that trying to give meaning

4

to that textual indication that Congress had clearly

5

wanted to capture something beyond traditional

6

navigable waterways and their adjacent wetlands.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's a very vague

8

indication.

9

argument based on 404(g) is a strong one, but it -- it

I mean, I -- I agree with you that your

10

perhaps is weakened if you believe that in order to

11

stretch to the -- to the limit of Federal jurisdiction,

12

you need a clear statement.

13

consider 404(g) -- if -- if the act did not previously

14

include the kind of authority you're arguing for, I

15

would not -- I would not consider 404(g) a clear

16

statement of that -- of that new -- new authority.

17

GENERAL CLEMENT:

I certainly wouldn't

Well, I think even you would

18

concede it's a clear statement that something else must

19

be covered.

20

meaningless in the statute.

21

I grant you that it might not be a clear statement as

22

to the nth tributary, and maybe that's a case on which

23

we can litigate in the future.

24
25

Otherwise, other than is completely
And so -- and -- and I --

But I think what I would say is, for those of
your colleagues that want to look at the legislative

60
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

history, it provides some additional context for 404(g)

2

and makes it very clear that Congress, as this Court

3

found in both Riverside Bayview and in SWANCC, was

4

specifically focused on the coverage of adjacent

5

wetlands.

6

that whatever scope of jurisdiction was given to the

7

Corps, that it would bring along with it the adjacent

8

wetlands.

9

And it's very clear that they understood

And so there was this long debate.
As I say, the legislative history I think

10

makes quite clear that they were meant to include

11

the non-navigable tributaries and a substantial amount

12

of the non-navigable tributaries.

13

would invite others to look at that.

And so, I mean, I

14

I also think that, to get back to a point I

15

made earlier, one thing that's exceedingly clear from

16

that legislative history is nobody in 1977, including

17

those that were advocating restricting the scope of the

18

404(g) program, wanted to restrict the EPA's

19

jurisdiction under 402.

20

they proposed that eventually found form in 404(g),

21

they expressly decoupled the 404 permitting process and

22

its jurisdiction from the 402 process.

23

And so in the legislation that

Petitioners' argument, by contrast,

24

necessarily restricts the scope of both of those

25

programs because they are joined in the hip through

2

fill in these wetlands, then it is equally true that

3

they can dump toxic materials into those wetlands.

And so if they're right that they can dredge and

If I --

Could you just say a word

about the -- the ditch -- sorry -- the word about the

7

wetland next to a tributary that's separated by a man-

instances?

10

Are there many such

It sounds to me like a scientific question.

Are there many such instances where there is no

a purpose of the statute to regulate this.
GENERAL CLEMENT:

What I would say, Justice

18

Breyer -- I -- I think I can answer the whole question

19

-- is in the vast majority of cases, as I understand

20

it, a berm will not have the effect of actually

21

preventing all hydrological connection.

JUSTICE BREYER:

And where do I look to

verify that scientific matter?

I can't find any

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Oh, again, I didn't mean to

suggest a percentage.

6

me put it to you this way, and this is the argument we

7

obviously make in the brief.

8

that a man-made -- that a man-made berm or a natural

berm is unlikely to prevent all hydrological flow is

I just think that -- that -- let

The best reason to think

10

even those man-made structures that have as their

levees and dams, have seepage and leakage from them.

So --

JUSTICE BREYER:

therefore, the presence of water would be just a

coincidence.

with it.

2

Now, what's wrong with what I just said?

3

GENERAL CLEMENT:

What's wrong with what you

4

just said is that wetlands have unique characteristics

5

that are different just from low-lying areas.

6

this Court started to recognize that in the Riverside

7

Bayview case.

8

the image that wetlands actually act something like a

9

sponge, and because of that characteristic, they play

And I think

And the image I would leave you with is

10

two important roles in helping to regulate the flow of

11

the adjacent water body.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

13

Now, what specifically, since I think this is

Okay, I understand that.

14

scientific, do I look at to verify what you just said,

15

namely that a wet depression, even if there's no

16

interchange, has a lot to do with flood control that a

17

dry depression wouldn't have?

18

statement.

19

That's a scientific

Where do I verify it?

GENERAL CLEMENT:

And, again, I mean, I would

20

direct you to the amicus briefs that discuss in length

21

the benefits of wetlands, but I understand you won't

22

find those --

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

I read them, and I -- I just

24

perhaps wasn't reading them closely enough, but I just

25

can't find the verification directly there.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

GENERAL CLEMENT:

And -- and I sense that you

2

found them lacking in that sense.

3

say is there's certainly anecdotal evidence in those

4

amicus briefs that I think is quite striking.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, what am I supposed to

6

do with the case?

7

necessarily pick up everything.

8
9
10

I guess what I would

I read them quickly.

I don't

I'll read them again.

But if I don't find empirical verification for that
statement, what am I supposed to do with this case?
GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, not surprisingly, I would

11

suggest that you defer to the agency in its exercise of

12

expertise.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

Fine.

And where did the

14

agency, in its many, many proceedings over the course

15

of 35 years, say what you just said, namely that a

16

wetland acts as a sponge?

17

It's just that there may be a need to drop a citation

18

somewhere.

19

(Laughter.)

20

GENERAL CLEMENT:

It's very plausible to me.

Well, you -- and you could

21

cite to the proceedings in this very case in the joint

22

appendix because although they didn't use the sponge

23

word, there was a specific finding in this case that

24

these wetlands played an important role in flood

25

control and pollution control for the adjacent streams.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And if you wanted a

2

cite for the opposite proposition, you could cite subsection

3

(7) of the Corps' regulations where they have no

4

interest in wetlands that happen to be adjacent to

5

other wetlands that are adjacent to the waters of the

6

United States.

7

postulating, presumably they'd want to cover those

8

adjacent wetlands just as much as they want to cover

9

the wetlands that are next to the tributary, but they

10
11

If they act in the way that you've been

don't.
GENERAL CLEMENT:

With respect, I don't think

12

that follows because if you read subsection (7), as I

13

do, as only excluding those wetlands that are adjacent

14

to other isolated wetlands, then regulating those

15

wetlands --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It doesn't -- it

19

21

It says other than waters that are

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, and as I said, I think

22

you have to read that in the context not just of the

23

rest of the regulations but of this Court's decision in

24

Riverside Bayview.

25

Riverside Bayview is that it's not enough to simply say

The one thing we know from

66
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

that your parcel of wetlands is not adjacent to the

2

navigable waterway because in that case, as the Court

3

remarked, it -- the parcel ended before it got to the

4

adjacent navigable body of water and there was another

5

wetland.

6

There was a continuation of the same wetland.

Now, I don't know whether you'd call that two adjacent

wetlands.

be some different way of referring to that.

know that the one wetland was covered because that was

There might

the holding of this Court in Riverside Bayview.

11

So I don't think I would give undue weight to

12

that reading of it especially when, if you read it as I

13

do, it makes perfect sense because a wetland adjacent

14

to an otherwise isolated wetland is not going to have

15

the same role to play in flood control in terms of

16

monitoring the stream volume as a wetland adjacent to

17

an otherwise regulable water body as you have at issue

18

here.

19

that the Corps has made is one that's perfectly

20

defensible and makes sense.

21

And so I think that that regulatory decision

And I think that -- again, I think one other

22

point that I want to note that's kind of specific to

23

this case is part of the reason why it makes sense to

24

regulate a wetland adjacent to an otherwise regulable

25

water body, even if there is a berm present, is

67
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

1

illustrated by this case because, as was alluded to,

2

the specific development plan at issue here -- and this

3

is clear at joint appendix pages 95 and 160 -- would

4

sever the berm and create the hydrological link between

5

a smaller, deeper wetland and the adjacent navigable

The

it would largely be rainwater, that -- the fact that

Absolutely.

there is nothing but puddles that are isolated by a

tributaries, I can't conceive of -- of how you could

consider that that's -- you know, at least where it

leaks sometimes into the storm drain and went down to a

tributary, I think it's an exaggeration, but maybe you

11

could call it a water of the United States.

12

there's a berm that prevents any water from going even

how can you possibly consider that a water of the

It is not an independent basis.

It is part of the reason why, though, in the context

Part of the reason you can look at the record

Now, as the

It's not a

It's a very loose term and it's not a

10

term the Corps has ever used in regulating adjacent

11

wetlands.

12

It's important to stress that the regulation

13

for adjacent wetlands that is at issue here, subsection

14

(7), is exactly the same regulation that was at issue

15

in Riverside Bayview.

16

the Court, when it framed the question presented,

17

framed it in terms of whether or not the Corps could

18

rationally regulate wetlands that were adjacent to

19

navigable waters and their tributaries.

20

got to the holding, this Court approved the regulation

21

and approved the fact that it asserted jurisdiction

22

over wetlands adjacent to otherwise regulable waters.

23

So if the tributaries are otherwise regulable because

24

they are waters of the United States, it follows

directly from Riverside Bayview that the adjacent

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

is you don't need a hydrological connection because

What I would say, though, is that this case

that's because -- I mean, to put it more favorably to

the fact that their wetlands are adjacent to

or not those are tributaries.

7

that might be an appropriate focus for inquiry.

One of

And in

In a different case,

The last thing, I would say a couple of
points before I sit down.

I do think, first, that

10

section 404(g) of the statute is very important because

11

it is the clearest textual indication that Congress

12

intended to regulate something beyond traditional

13

navigable waterways and their adjacent wetlands.

14

as this Court itself remarked in SWANCC, the single

15

most likely candidate are the non-navigable

16

tributaries.

17

And

The second point to emphasize is that the

18

scope of the Corps' 404 jurisdiction is the same as the

19

EPA's 402 jurisdiction.

20

through the basic prohibition under section 301.

21

conclusion that somehow certain tributaries are excised

22

from the tributary system for purposes of 404 is

23

likewise excising those tributaries and creating a

24

situation where you can have a -- a free dump zone at

25

2

tributary system.

3

even the proponents of narrowing the Corps'

4

jurisdiction in 1977 could not countenance.

5

And I think that is something that

The last point I would make is that there are

6

going to be real-world consequences to contracting the

7

jurisdiction of the Corps and the EPA to pre-1972 or,

8

really, pre-1899 levels, especially for the downstream

9

States.

I think it's a bit much to ask a legislator in

10

Wisconsin or in Minnesota to stop local development in

11

order to protect the water quality and flood control

12

propensities of the Mississippi River in Mississippi.

13

That's why it was manifest in 1972 that there was a

14

need for a Federal solution to this problem.

15

Federal solution includes as two of its most important

16

components first getting at water pollution at its

17

source, at the point source, and secondly, covering the

18

tributary system without which the navigable waters

19

will continue to be polluted.

In -- in Solid

the meaning of navigable waters under 404(a) because

out that -- that in every formal rulemaking, the Corps
