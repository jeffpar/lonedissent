ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN S. FRANKLIN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

12

MR. FRANKLIN:

Justice Stevens, and may it

please the Court:
The patent claim at issue in this case was

13

held to be infringed whenever any doctor looks at a

14

homocysteine test result and reflexively thinks about a

15

basic natural correlation.

16

dollar damages and an injunction prohibiting a testing

17

company from conducting important homocysteine tests by any

18

method and for any reason whatsoever.

19

The result has been multimillion

As broadly construed by the Federal Circuit,

20

this claim is invalid as a matter of law for two closely

21

related reasons.

22

settled proscription against effectively patenting laws of

23

nature or natural phenomena as well as the requirement that

24

a patent must fully and clearly describe, disclose and

25

enable an actual invention and must not sweep so far as to

It contravenes both of this Court's

encompass more than what was actually invented.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:
that second point definiteness?

4
5

Is that second point -- is

MR. FRANKLIN:

The second point is

definiteness, it's enablement.

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Does definiteness describe

7

this second aspect that you've just --

8

MR. FRANKLIN:

9

It describes part of it, Your

Honor.

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

11

MR. FRANKLIN:

Just part of it.

There is definiteness, there is

12

enablement, there is written description.

13

those are contravened here.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

We think all of

Let's examine them.

What if

15

it definitely goes so far as to allow no other use of this

16

natural law that it's discovered?

17

far, isn't definiteness fully satisfied?

18
19

MR. FRANKLIN:

It definitely goes that

I think not, Your Honor,

because --

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

21

MR. FRANKLIN: -- definiteness would still

No?

22

require that you distinctly claim an invention here and

23

that's one of the things that's absent in this case.

24

even moving beyond that, Your Honor --

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But

It's indefinite because we

patent which requires looking at the clouds in the sky for

3

10 minutes.

4

definite.

5

Suppose there a

I mean, that's maybe absurd, but it's certainly

MR. FRANKLIN:

Well, Your Honor, if it is

6

definite, then it is certainly not enabling of an actual

7

invention.

8

our briefs, comes into play.

9

that Samuel Morse was entitled to patent his innovative

And here the Morse case, which we have cited in
In that case, the court held

10

telegraph but he couldn't go further to effectively patent

11

the law of nature or natural phenomenon associated with it

12

and thereby monopolize all manner of devices and processes

13

that he did not invent and did not enable or describe.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But wasn't the issue there

15

what is patentable?

16

17

what's patentable.

18

was presented as a definiteness case.

19

I mean this case in the district court
101 deals with

And it seems to me that you -- this case

MR. FRANKLIN:

But it was not just

20

definiteness, Your Honor.

21

get to the Morse case because as we have explained in our

22

reply brief and, in fact, in our opening brief, the Morse

23

case was in fact decided under what is now section 112.

24

Court cited and quoted the relevant statute which has not

25

changed in any material respect today.

It was section 112.

But let me

The

The Court made clear

5
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

that the problem in that case, at page 120 of the opinion,

2

was that Morse claims what he has not described in the

3

manner required by law.

4

And what we have here is the same situation.

5

We have these patentees who are indisputably entitled to

6

patent their innovative method for measuring homocysteine.

7

And LabCorp continues to use that method sometimes and we

8

pay royalties whenever we use that method.

9

couldn't do is what Samuel Morse tried to do and push the

But what they

10

envelope, and try to effectively patent the natural

11

phenomenon associated with all homocysteine tests and

12

thereby gain a monopoly over just not the one that they

13

invented, not just those that are in the prior art, which

14

itself would be impermissible, but even yet to be invented

15

assays.

16

And here is the nub of this case.

LabCorp has

17

sought to use but has been penalized for using and is

18

prevented from using a more efficient and cost-effective

19

method for assaying homocysteine than the one that these

20

patentees invented.

21

which is the Abbott method, reduces the processing time for

22

homocysteine tests down from what was up to 18 hours under

23

the patentee's method down to a manner of minutes.

24
25

The method that LabCorp seeks to use,

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is the Abbott test -- that's

patented and you're paying royalties for that?

MR. FRANKLIN:

Actually, I don't know, Your

2

Honor.

3

is certainly not covered by their claims 1 through 12, which

4

have never been -- well, the district court found that those

5

claims didn't apply here, and that's not an issue.

And, I just don't know whether it's patented but it

6

The Abbott method is different.

It's an

7

immunoassay.

8

gas chromatograph method that they have described.

9

much more efficient, it's much more cost-effective and the

It is not the same kind of mass spectometry
It's

10

reason obviously that LabCorp wants to use that method is to

11

more effectively serve patients and their doctors and to

12

meet the burgeoning demand for homocysteine tests.

13

because these patentees have effectively claimed the patent

14

on the natural correlation that's associated with all

15

homocysteine tests, they have prevented LabCorp from using

16

what the patent laws would seek to encourage, that is, a

17

more cost-effective, innovative, different method, the kind

18

of thing -- exactly the kind of thing that the Court was

19

concerned about in Morse.

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But

The opinion of the Court of

21

Appeals for the Federal Circuit in the appendix begins

22

24

is completely wrong?

1

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Yes.

You're asking us to

2

reverse this court of appeals decision and I'm looking, and

3

particularly with reference to claim 13, the one we're

4

talking about, I assume, and I'm looking through pages, say,

5

16 and 21 to find something that's absolutely wrong.

6

MR. FRANKLIN:

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

8

Well, I think what -You want me to tell the court

of appeals, well, you can't do this.

9

MR. FRANKLIN:

But where is it wrong?

I think where it's wrong, Your

10

Honor, is that it proceeds from an assumption that is wrong

11

in itself and that is --

12
13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So you can't point me to any

particular sentence that -- that's absolutely wrong?

14

MR. FRANKLIN:

I think that the argument in --

15

the Federal Circuit's decision is wrong in its enablement

16

discussion, it's wrong in its written description

17

discussion.

18

description posits that this is a valid written description

19

because the inventors, as the Federal Circuit says in its

20

opinion, possessed the correlating step.

21

wrong about that, Your Honor, is that nobody can possess the

22

correlation.

I mean, just to take one, the written

And that's the nub of this case.

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You see my point?

I'm not

sure what it is you want me to say went wrong, other than

5

the fact that this patent is, should never have been granted

6

to begin with but that wasn't raised.

7

MR. FRANKLIN:

Well, I think it was raised,

Your Honor.

court, it was raised on appeal.

The validity issue was raised in the district
The district court had

10

construed the patent as requiring -- and part of the

11

district court's claim construction addressed the issue as

12

to whether or not one could patent a law of nature or

effectively patent a scientific idea.

joint appendix page 60.

16

17

imposed on the patent.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But you're arguing now, as I

23

understand it, that the reason you win on definiteness is

24

that it sweeps in even as yet uninvented processes.

MR. FRANKLIN:

Yes.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And it does so by means, in

effect, of erecting this umbrella of a natural fact which is

intended to cover every process that might be relevant to

4

establishing that natural fact.

5

MR. FRANKLIN:

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yes.
So that you're saying we

cannot -- no court can decide definiteness in this situation

without hitting the patentable issue.

MR. FRANKLIN:

exactly what we're arguing.

12

Absolutely, Your Honor.

That's

And that's where the Federal

JUSTICE BREYER:

But you told the -- you said,

judge, if you in fact hold that this claim 13 satisfies

concise, if you hold that, then the claim would violate

So your complaint about the

paragraph on 17a is that it did not deal with that

argument.

10

MR. FRANKLIN:

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.
But I imagine they'll say that

12

simply mentioning it in an oral argument is not enough to

13

get us to think seriously about it.

14

MR. FRANKLIN:

Well, it was in the brief, Your

15

Honor, and I think that it was also in, with the premise of

16

everything that we argued, because the district court had

17

already -- and again, I point the Court to joint appendix

mean -- the patent had to mean something more than the

20

simple relationship, the simple existence of the

21

relationship between elevated homocysteine and vitamin

22

deficiencies.

23

argument and, in fact, to the arguments below was that we

24

don't know what that anything is, because the patent doesn't

25

tell you.

"The correlating step is a simple conclusion

7

And what that means is now, as a result of the

8

Federal Circuit's decision, unlike the district court's

9

decision, we now know that every homocysteine test

10

automatically infringes because every doctor will

11

reflexively look at it and think about the phenomenon

12

associated with it.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You set off the district

The Federal Circuit then abandoned what

verdict.

10

MR. FRANKLIN:

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes.
And I don't understand how

12

you're setting off the district court from the court of

13

appeals when the court of appeals, whatever it said, it

14

affirmed the judgment of the district court.

15

MR. FRANKLIN:

It did, but the claim

16

construction is the part of what I'm talking about.

17

60, I'll just read what the district court said.

18

"Correlating is a verb and must mean more than the simple

19

existence of a relationship between a high level

20

homocysteine and deficiency in cobalamin or folate."

21

At page

The Federal Circuit's opinion is contrary to

22

that, Your Honor, and that's where this whole issue gets put

23

front and center now.

24

Federal Circuit's extraordinarily broad construction is we

25

have nothing more than the reflexive mental recognition of a

interpretation would raise perhaps for the -- clearly raise

This issue was presented in the petition.

that the issue is easy to resolve given the Federal

Under that construction,

And as

10

we have said without contradiction in the opening brief, if

this patent is valid, then anyone can gain a patent over a

scientific correlation by doing this kind of artful

drafting.

not know about, I could run down to the Patent Office,

patent that correlation and the effect of that would be to

monopolize all blood typing, no matter whether it's done

argue that a holding in your favor would call into question

the number but I don't think it would call into question a

huge swath of patents.

It would call into question patents

JUSTICE ALITO:

No.

You would have to do an

exhaustive search.

12

of the ones that the Respondents cite, some of the claims --

13

and let's distinguish between patents and claims here,

because it might invalidate some claims in some patents,

envelope.

MR. FRANKLIN:

4

talking about is deciding this case on its facts and

5

obviously to the extent there are other patents that are

6

just like this one, and the court has addressed this in the

7

context of Flook and Diehr and has distinguished between

8

those patents which facially looked rather similar but the

9

court was able to draw the distinctions.

10

But again, what we're

The Federal

Circuit can draw the distinctions.

11

But if it is a patent that is simply like this

12

one, which claims nothing more than a natural correlation

preceded by the inherent step of ascertaining the input, no

14

court, to my knowledge, has ever upheld such a patent before

this case.

It's the

only claim that's being challenged.

Why shouldn't we do what the

Solicitor General proposed, that is, since we don't know for

9

scientist --

10

MR. FRANKLIN:

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Right.
-- whether in fact the section

112 determination, as made by the Federal court, excludes all

13

other possible use of this natural phenomenon.

14

Since I don't know that for sure, why shouldn't

15

I tell the Federal Circuit, you know, your definition of

16

correlate raises this issue and you should resolve whether

17

it is true that there is no other possible usefulness for

18

this, no substantial usefulness?

19

MR. FRANKLIN:

Quite simply, Your Honor, it's

20

because the Court doesn't need to reach that issue and

21

didn't need to reach it in any of its prior cases save one

22

and that's the Benson case where that issue came up really

23

in one sentence of the opinion.

That was actually one very small sliver

And the Court said, no, it doesn't matter.

So if the Court --

MR. FRANKLIN:

Okay.
-- so I don't think the Court

field of use is not going to save that patent from

invalidity.

MR. HUNGAR:

4

may it please the Court:

Thank you, Justice Stevens, and

understandable by a person of ordinary skill in the art and

The patent specification sets forth the

it enables such persons to practice the claimed invention.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So you agree or you submit

12

that you can have a definite description of something that's

13

unpatentable because it's too broad?

14

MR. HUNGAR:

Well, that obviously assumes the

15

conclusion, Your Honor.

16

definiteness requirement, the challenge seems to be that

17

because the first step of claim 13 is not limited to a

18

particular type of assay but instead claims all assays, that

19

that somehow renders it indefinite, and that argument is

20

simply incorrect as this Court has recognized for over a

21

hundred years.

22

But with respect to the

In the Cochrane against Deener case, for

23

example, the Court addressed that question where a process

24

claim was not limited to a particular method of performing a

25

particular step of the process, and the Court said quote, "A

form of the instrumentalities used", closed quote.

Court reiterated that principle in the Diehr case.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And the

But, but, but -- well, let's

5

assume that there is a claim that includes something that

6

should not be patentable, because it's too broad or it

7

involves the scientific phenomena, the mechanics of the

8

universe.

9

that sort of unpatentable claim?

10

Can a patent still be definite if it includes

MR. HUNGAR:

It can be.

It might or might not

11

be depending on the circumstances.

12

example where it was both indefinite and invalid because

13

trying to claim a principle of nature, in effect.

14

the same token you can easily have, and in fact you have

15

here, a claim where it's definite in that persons of

16

ordinary skill in the art understand the scope of the

17

claims.

18

the patent, which is, in this case, a question entirely

19

separate from the question whether, as construed by the

20

Court and as understood by the person of ordinary skill in

21

the art, it's valid, under section 101, that is, under the

22

scope of patentable subject matter.

23
24
25

The Morse case is an

But by

They know what is and is not within the scope of

What do you think about its

validity under 101?
MR. HUNGAR:

Your Honor, as we suggested in our

22
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

brief, we don't think that that question is properly before

2

the Court but that --

3
4
5

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I understand, but I didn't ask

you what you said in your brief.
MR. HUNGAR:

Yes, Your Honor.

But that if the

6

Court were to reach that question, we think that while it's

7

unclear because the issue wasn't litigated, there appears to

8

be prima facie evidence of invalidity under Benson, this

9

Court's decision in Benson, because, given what we currently

10

know, it appears that the claim as construed by the court of

11

appeals preempts all substantial practical applications of

12

the correlation.

13

below, if the Court were to reach it, it should remand --

14

But because that issue wasn't litigated

JUSTICE STEVENS:

To you read the the patent as --

15

talking about step 1, you can use any assay method you want.

16

It doesn't have to be patented.

17

that any time you ask a doctor to tell us what you think the

18

results of the test mean, that that's an infringement?

19

MR. HUNGAR:

But the correlation, step 2,

That's how the court of appeals

20

construed it, yes, Your Honor. I'm sorry.

21

JUSTICE STEVENS:

22

And is it possible that that

can be patentable, in your view?

23

MR. HUNGAR:

24

JUSTICE STEVENS:

25

Is that -

Well, again, Your Honor, we -If you just go to the doctor

and ask for advice and he says, yes, I've looked at the

is -

MR. HUNGAR:

JUSTICE STEVENS:

6

As we indicated -- he's committed

infringement under this patent as I understand it.
MR. HUNGAR:

As we indicated in our brief, we

7

think that raises a potentially serious pre-emption problem

8

and it also raises the anticipation problem, that is, the

9

section 102 argument which is not before the Court but if it

10
11

were litigated -JUSTICE STEVENS:

It would raise the -- just

do you think that that patent is valid?

13

trying to ask you.

14

MR. HUNGAR:

That's what I'm

problems under section 102 and also under the pre-emption,

16

-- potentially under the pre-emption doctrine.

17

addressed the other issues that Petitioner seeks to put

18

before the Court involving Diehr and Flook, both because --

19

20

We haven't

First of all, it wasn't pressed or passed upon

I'm trying to get to.

2

MR. HUNGAR:

Yes, Your Honor.

And as I've

3

said, we've identified two areas in which we think there are

4

potentially problems if they were in front of the Court.

5
6

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Do you think there is a 101

problem too?

7

MR. HUNGAR:

The preemption issue is a 101

8

problem, Your Honor.

9

have not taken a position on the broader section 101 issues

10

and we would urge the Court not to do so as well, in a case

11

in which it wasn't presented below, the Court doesn't have

12

the benefit of the lower court's assessment of that

13

question.

14

substantial reliance interests and --

We haven't addressed -- as I said, we

And given that that question implicates

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So we do have a fairly long

discussion by the lower court on the infringement issue.

17

order to find infringement, they had to construe

That sounds absolutely definite.

Anyone can

I thought the problem there was that although

6

anyone can understand it, you can't claim something as broad

7

as that.

8

insofar as it's narrower, it isn't precise.

9

it's broad, it's too broad, but definite.

10
11

You must intend to claim something narrower.

And

So insofar as
And insofar as

it's narrow, it's not there, but indefinite.

Okay?

Precisely the claim that they raised before the

12

Federal Circuit and precisely the claim -- with appropriate

13

citations, and precisely the claim in respect to which the

14

Federal Circuit said nothing.

15

MR. HUNGAR:

Your Honor, I may have misspoken

16

before but I think it's probably most accurate to read the

17

Morse case as dealing with a written specification problem,

18

that is, the specification in claim 8, the one Your Honor is

19

referring to, didn't tell anything about the method by which

20

the principle of nature, electromagnetism, would be used.

21

All it did is describe a result, and it purported to claim

22

any, any method involving any number of steps that any

23

inventor might ever invent in the future, even if those

24

steps had nothing to do with -- if there was not a single

25

overlapping step between that new process and Morse's

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.

And we here apply the

correlation to any homocysteine test, any one here, any one

in the future, any one that any mind might impend.

difference?

6

MR. HUNGAR:

What's the

Well, the difference is between

7

claiming a -- claiming all methods of achieving a particular

8

result and claiming one process for achieving that

9

particular result and then as one claiming any means of

10

doing one particular step of that process.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

I apply electricity to all

12

methods of putting down letters with electricity.

13

the correlation to all methods of creating a homocysteine

14

test.

15

MR. HUNGAR:

I apply

Well, again, Your Honor, if it is

16

true that all methods of employing the assay -- excuse me,

17

all methods of employing the correlation are preempted by

18

this patent claim, then it would be invalid under section

19

101.

20

beyond that issue, we submit Morse doesn't support it and

21

indeed this Court's decision's in --

22

But to the extent the argument is an attempt to go

JUSTICE BREYER:

Oh, no, I'm not talking about

23

going beyond it.

24

definiteness and 101, 112, 101 is not quite so clear as I

25

would have thought, because it sounds to me relying on the

1854 case of Samuel F. B. Morse, they're making the same

kind of argument and, indeed, you translated Morse as a

definiteness 112 argument, and yet it seemed to me that's

4

the kind of argument they're making.

5

MR. HUNGAR:

Yes, Your Honor.

And I think it

6

is more properly understood as a specification problem

7

because, as you say, anyone can understand the scope of that

8

claim.

9

because he was purporting to claim any process even if it

It's just that it was not sufficiently described

10

had nothing to do with the process he had invented, and

11

that's not what's happening here.

12

step, that is, do an assay, as opposed to some other method,

13

and they claim any method of doing that assay within step 1

14

of the overall claim but they aren't saying -- for instance

15

the analogy would be if they had claimed we've just

16

devised one particular method of determining whether someone

has a vitamin deficiency and we therefore claim all other

18

methods of determining whether someone has a vitamin

19

deficiency.

effect synonymous with any process that gets the relevant

2

data and you're using it in a more -- I think, in answering

3

Justice Breyer's question, you were using it in a narrower

4

sense.

5

MR. HUNGAR:

Well, I think that, as understood

by a person having ordinary skill in the art, we -- it may

7

be.

We don't know because the issue wasn't litigated.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But I thought that was the

point of your argument, that there are assays and then there
are other methods.

11

Did I misunderstand you?

MR. HUNGAR:

Well, no.

Certainly it's

12

conceivable that there are other methods and indeed the

13

patent claim -- the patent specification refers to -- or

suggests the possibility of assaying tissue as opposed to

ON BEHALF OF THE ON RESPONDENTS
MR. ESTRADA:

Thank you, Justice Stevens.

Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:
This was a hard fought jury trial in which the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

1

The first is LabCorp never asked the trial

judge or the Federal Circuit to declare this patent invalid

3

under section 101, which is an affirmative defense they had

4

to plead in the answer and prove by clear and convincing

5

evidence.

6
7

Second, they're simply wrong on the merits of
the 101 case under this Court's cases.

8
9

And third, you can search their brief in vain
for a workable test for patentable subject matter that would

10

invalidate this patent and not bring complete havoc to the

11

patent world by calling into question numerous diagnostic

12

tests in medicine and otherwise, pharmaceuticals and other

13

inventions.

anyone that if you tried to apply it to every test, it was

12

on the subject of engaging what our arguments have been all

13

along, we made clear in our brief, and nobody ever

responded, at page 38, that claim 13 is only infringed when

JUSTICE BREYER:

And this point was

You're onto something, to me,

10

that is absolutely fundamental.

11

doctors and scientists and computer people who are working

12

extremely hard to think of useful ideas and if you don't

give them an incentive, they may think of less.

MR. ESTRADA:

JUSTICE BREYER:

You have millions of

Correct.
And they're all useful.

At

16

the same time, if you patent all of their ideas, including

17

very useful mini-micro principle ideas, you will establish

18

monopolies throughout this country beyond belief and it will

19

be difficult for people, without paying vast amounts of

20

money, to use their useful ideas.

So what principle do we use to separate the

MR. ESTRADA:

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

Let me -

Would it make sense to send

3

this back and say, look, at least address their argument?

4

You can answer any part of that.

5

MR. ESTRADA:

Three answers.

Number one, under

6

the patent laws, everybody -- anybody who makes, uses or

7

sells the invention is potentially liable as an infringer.

8

Number two, Congress knows this and it knows that the people

9

who might be liable as infringers are doctors.

It passed in

10

1996 section 287(c) of the patent law that gives doctors a

11

defense to infringement for certain things they do in their

12

offices, not this one.

13

all of the policy issues being raised and has chosen to give

14

an answer only so far.

15

So Congress is perfectly aware of

The third is it is a fundamental misconception

16

to treat the case as though, even if the section 101 issue

17

is in front of the Court -- and it isn't -- whether the

18

issue is whether section 101 means that something is

19

actually patentable as opposed to what Diehr said, which is,

20

is it possibly patentable.

21

patentability.

22

the funnel, and all of the outlandish hypotheticals that we

23

have to deal about how this could be patented don't really

24

deal with the reality of the patent code, which is this is

25

the intake funnel.

This is subject matter

Is the mouth of the funnel, not the end of

We have doctrines of obviousness,

39
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

anticipation, 112, many other things, all of which were

2

raised at trial and the jury rejected in this case.

3

But the reason why there may be some

4

superficial appeal to the outlandish hypotheticals, Justice

5

Breyer, is because there is an effort to confuse the issue

6

that they're trying to smuggle belatedly into the case, 101,

7

as though it dealt with whether something is actually

8

patentable as opposed to potentially patentable.

9

latter question, whether something is potentially

And on the

10

patentable, we have the extremely broad language of section

11

101 coupled by this Court's cases, in Chakrabarty and Diehr,

12

which said that what Congress intended is for anything under

13

the sun made by man to be potentially patentable.

14

there is some more precise policy issue why a particular

15

invention ought not to be patentable, it is found in section

16

102, 103, 112, other parts of the patent code, on which they

17

lost in front of the jury.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

19

What was made by man here?

And if

What was made by man here?
I mean, if you're

20

talking about the type of assay that your client developed,

21

which was involved in other claims, not in 13, then I'd

22

say, yes, that was made by man.

23

is simply discovery of the natural principle that when one,

24

when there is the presence of one substance in a human

25

being, there is a deficiency of two other ones.

But here, what 13 involves

That's just

40
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

a natural principle.

2

What's made by man about that?

MR. ESTRADA:

Well, the -- we don't contend that

3

the second step of the correlation is independently

4

patentable even though the argument is framed as a --

5

argument.

6

by Diehr is the inventive spark of putting together the

7

discovery of the correlation with a way found elsewhere to

8

measure these important bodily chemicals to produce a

9

diagnostic test.

10

What we contend is patentable and what's allowed

JUSTICE SCALIA:

A way found elsewhere if

11

indeed the Federal Circuit had determined the second step,

12

you know, step 1, do the assay, step 2, correlate.

13

Federal Circuit had said, oh, that requires your using a

14

scale to see how much of one there is and how little of the

15

other, but this Federal Circuit says, all correlate means is

16

be aware of the fact that when one substance is high, the

17

other two are going to be low.

18

MR. ESTRADA:

If the

That's all it means.

Well, that's unfair to the Federal

19

Circuit on two points.

20

Federal Circuit, and in fact I think they said that, I can't

21

put my hand on the page, where they said, there is no issue

22

here about step number one.

23

about is the correlating step and what it means.

24
25

Number one, it was very clear to the

All that people are fighting

And the problem that LabCorp had in the Federal
Circuit with respect to the correlating step, which is a

41
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

question they tried to bring up and was cert denied, is that

2

they proposed in the district court the definition that was

3

used by the Federal Circuit, which is a mutual or reciprocal

4

relationship between an elevated level and the vitamin.

5

so having proposed that, it actually makes sense as a

6

diagnostic test, as the Federal Circuit pointed out with the

7

example of the pregnancy test.

8
9

And

Now, Justice Scalia, you asked a question
earlier --

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, please don't get off it --

11

because this is my biggest problem with the case.

12

that what you've said is simply a statement of the natural

13

phenomenon, that when the one substance is high, the other

14

two are low.

15

phenomenon is all that correlation consists of.

16

I agree

And simply to be aware of that natural

MR. ESTRADA:

Well, it is true but is not

17

necessarily the case that being aware of a natural

18

phenomenon or of a correlation leads you inevitably to an

19

inventive diagnostic test.

20

being tall and being -- you know, between height and weight.

21

If I tell you that somebody's coming to visit you who is 250

22

pounds, that person is probably not a five year-old.

23

gets me nowhere in terms of turning that into useful knowledge

24

that could be patentable.

25

There is a correlation between

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But that

But you do agree, do you

42
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

not, that step 2 by itself would not be patentable?

2
3

MR. ESTRADA:

I do agree with that, Justice

Stevens.

4

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Your point is that even

5

though step 2 is performed as the second step of step 1

6

which is also not patentable, you get together for the

7

patent?

8
9

MR. ESTRADA:

That's true.

And if you look at

the Diehr case, it's a perfect example because Diehr had

10

more steps but it was absolutely true in Diehr that every

11

single step, including the mathematical equation, was part

12

of the prior art.

13

patentable because you have found a way to put all these

14

disparate things together in a way that makes

15

them potentially useful.

16

And this Court said that's potentially

JUSTICE BREYER:

Does that fall within it?

17

I mean, I can't resist pointing, as one of these briefs

18

did, the phrase anything under the sun that is made by

19

man comes from a committee report that said something

20

different.

21

a manufacture, which may include anything under the sun that

22

is made by man.

It said a person may have invented a machine or

23

So referring to that doesn't help solve the

24

problem where we're not talking about a machine or a

25

manufacture.

Rather we are talking about what has to be

done in order to make an abstract idea fall within the

2

patent act.

3

connecting it with some physical things in the world and

4

sometimes you can't.

Now, sometimes you can make that happen by

5

MR. ESTRADA:

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

But Justice Breyer -And if you have a clear

7

statement other than Diehr, Flook, Morse, which draws that

8

line properly, let me know.

9

MR. ESTRADA:

I think the telephone cases, Bell

10

and Diehr, are cases that absolutely show that under this

11

Court's cases, this is patentable subject matter.

12

we're talking about the mouth of the funnel, not the end of

13

the funnel.

14

Again,

But let me point something else, Justice

15

Breyer, which is it came from a committee report but it's

16

already been incorporated in this Court's cases in

17

Chakrabarty and in Diehr as exemplary of Congress'

18

determination to have the mouth of the funnel be very wide.

19

And if there are problems with something being ultimately

20

patentable, they are because there is some other requirement

21

of the patent law that -- that -- that should be looked at.

22

One of the other points on the question that

23

Justice Scalia asked, because I think it is important on

24

whether this question is before the Court, is that the rules

25

of this Court, rule 14(1)(f) mandated the petition shall

44
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

1

2

verbatim.

3

there is an appendix which is at the very last page of the

4

petition, and you can look at it and it says, pertinent

5

statutory provisions.

6

and section 271.

7

the same with the back flap, and we have the fishes and the

8

loaves.

9

And you can pick up the cert petition and indeed

There are two statutes, section 112

You can pick up their blue brief and do

Now they have three statutes, 101, 112 and 271.

10

There is no way to construe their question 3 as having been

11

intended all along to encompass a very separate affirmative

12

defense that they never put in front of the trial court or

13

the Federal Circuit.

14
15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Would the case be different

if they quoted section 101 in their appendix?

16

MR. ESTRADA:

Yes, I think it would be

17

different, Justice Stevens, because then their argument that

18

this was encompassed within one of the questions in the

19

petition might have some surface plausibility.

20

doesn't.

21

But it

Let me just go back and link that point with

22

another aspect of our legal system, which is you see cases

23

of forfeiture and waiver all the time.

24

Unitherm and in Arbaugh, you have already said twice that

25

parties should be held responsible for their procedural

Alderson Reporting Company

1

defaults.

You do that in other areas of the law.

2

And the one that came to mind, to my mind as I

3

was thinking about this case, Justice Stevens, is going all

4

the way back to Wainwright versus Sykes, because you have

5

cases every year involving habeas corpus, where Wainwright

6

versus Sykes says we have to be careful about sandbagging,

7

and we're going to presume that an indigent defendant on

8

trial for his life in a rural county someplace with a lawyer

9

two years out of law school, who can't find the courthouse,

10

consciously chose to save the federal claims so that he

11

could assert later, have it in his back pocket:

12

to have a rule of forfeiture for sandbagging.

13

We're going

Empirically, one may well wonder whether that

14

is empirically likely to be true in a great number of cases.

15

But we don't have to wonder in this case because every well

16

advised corporate defendant, if I am their lawyer, I will

17

advise them to hold this in the back pocket and to have a

18

second trip to the trial court and the court of appeals

19

because in the rules in affirmative defense, rule 8 says you

20

have to plead it and the statute says you have to prove it.

21

And it went all the way up the ladder.

22

And if you tell them that they get to start all

23

over again, what you will have is every well advised

24

corporate defendant will be advised by counsel, like me and

25

by Mr. Franklin, that the way to do is to tire the inventor

Alderson Reporting Company

out, have a trial and then we can start all over again.

2

that's no way to run a legal system, especially when they're

3

coming with the most important questions of patent law to

4

this Court with incredibly far-reaching implications and the

5

best that they can say to the Court about why you shouldn't

6

worry about the consequences is, as they say in the closing

7

pages of the reply brief, rule for us and every other case

community who could swing billions of dollars on the basis

21

of an issue that was never litigated in the lower courts, I

frankly submit, Justice Scalia, that it would be

What the court of appeals said was any

Second, Morse was clearly a case decided under

8

what is now section 112.

9

The language of the case makes that clear.

I think Mr. Hungar admitted that.
It quotes the

10

relevant statute, and all of this is in our reply brief, and

11

it concludes that the patent in that case was overbroad

12

because it didn't, it contravened what is now section 112

13

and that is how we argued --

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Weren't 112 and 101 combined

at that time?

No, I don't.

explanation for not quoting section 101 in your papers?

MR. FRANKLIN:

I think the explanation is that

3

we cited all of the cases -- for example, Mackay Radio is a

case we cited that doesn't itself cite 101.

5

itself never cited 101 in these cases until 1972.

And there I think the analogy to Morse is quite

And what -- in Morse, the Court said that he

16

is to monopolize all homocysteine tests that are used to, as

17

they say, detect vitamin deficiencies through the natural

18

correlation that they recite.

because it wasn't limited to the one device that he actually

invented.

to the one homocysteine assay that they in fact invented,

that we use and that we pay royalties on every time we use.

Morse couldn't do that

Here they cannot do it because it's not limited
