CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN UNTEREINER

9

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

10
11

MR. UNTEREINER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

12

In 2003, this Court, to all appearances,

13

brought this case to an end by holding that all of

14

predicate RICO counts found by the jury must be reversed,

15

that the liability judgment must be reversed, and that the

16

injunction must be vacated.

17

of the Seventh Circuit found a way to keep this case

18

alive.

19

somehow survived this Court's decision, and it strongly

20

suggested that the Hobbs Act punishes acts or threats of

21

physical violence that have no connection to either

22

robbery or extortion.

23

On remand, however, a panel

It held that 4 of the 121 RICO predicates

Today, we are asking this Court to reverse the

24

erroneous decision below and remand with very explicit

25

instructions that judgment be entered in favor of

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Petitioners.

2

Reversal is warranted because of three separate

3

legal errors made by the Seventh Circuit.

4

lower court failed to obey the clear holdings and remand

5

instructions of this Court.

6

erroneously held, in conflict with two other Circuits,

7

that the Hobbs Act plausibly can be read to cover

8

freestanding acts or threats of physical violence.

9

third, the Seventh Circuit erred in its previous decision,

First, the

Second, the Seventh Circuit

10

in 2001, in holding that the racketeering law, RICO,

11

authorizes private injunctive relief.

12

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

And,

Counsel, if we were to agree

13

with you on any one of the three questions, would that end

14

the case?

15

MR. UNTEREINER:

That's correct, Justice

16

O'Connor.

17

that a new trial is not in the cards and the damages

18

verdict is gone and nothing more remains to be done except

19

for the two issues that it outlined, that's correct.

20

the Court rules in our favor on any issue, the case is

21

over.

22

Because of what the Seventh Circuit also said,

Let me turn to our first point.

If

The Seventh

23

Circuit's decision is inconsistent with this Court's

24

previous holdings.

25

doubt that, quote, "all," unquote, of the RICO predicates

must be reversed.

But --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes, but there was a theory

3

that was put to the jury -- and it's right there on the

4

special interrogatories -- one category was violent acts

5

that obstruct commerce with no connection at all to

6

extortion.

7

your characterization of what the Seventh Circuit did.

8

was puzzled.

9

are these four that don't involve extortion, and there's

That was there.

And I have a question about

It says, "Extortion, they all go."

But here

10

no ruling from the Court on those.

11

to assume that the Court made a question -- decided a

12

question of statutory interpretation by silence?

13

MR. UNTEREINER:

No.

It

Was the Court supposed

No, Justice Ginsburg, but

14

the argument was made in this Court, at the petition stage

15

the last time around, that those four counts were, in

16

fact, included in the petitions.

At that time, of course,

17

there was no contrary authority.

The Yankowski opinion of

18

the Ninth Circuit made clear, and I think the language of

19

the Hobbs Act makes clear, that freestanding acts or

20

threats of violence are not covered.

21

the petition stage, that those counts were covered.

22

then, at the merits stage, the Petitioners asked this

23

Court to reverse and remand for entry of judgment in our

24

favor on all claims and all counts.

25

that point, did not argue --

So, we argued, at

Is it conceivable

that we overlooked that point?
MR. UNTEREINER:

Well, we take the Court to mean

what it -- what it says.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

But if I just -- do you think

it's conceivable that we just didn't realize those four
points were at issue?
MR. UNTEREINER:

I think it's possible.

But if

12

the Court did overlook those, I think that would have been

13

something that should have been raised in a rehearing

14

petition in this Court.

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And do you think we resolved

16

the statutory construction issue that you're now arguing

17

very carefully at this time?

18

MR. UNTEREINER:

There's no indication, in the

19

court's opinion, that it resolved it.

20

that we were right, because we made the argument at the --

JUSTICE STEVENS:

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

correct, Justice Stevens.

2

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

If it's possible, at least,

3

that we just overlooked that aspect in the issuance of our

4

opinion, would it be more helpful to move on to the other

5

two questions at issue here, since they would be

6

determinative?

It's --

7

MR. UNTEREINER:

8

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

9

I'd be happy to --- it's disturbing to think

that some court below deliberately was trying to defy what

10

this Court said.

11

of that.

12

other acts were overlooked, and, therefore, they had some

13

right to deal with it.

14

on the other two legal issues here.

15

MR. UNTEREINER:

16
17

And I'm not sure there is any indication

It may have thought that those issues -- those

But I wonder if we shouldn't focus

I'd be happy to move on,

Justice O'Connor, to those two issues.
Our second argument is that the Hobbs Act does

18

not punish freestanding acts or threats of violence.

20

extortion.

21

By

And I think that's apparent from the language

So, there needs to

2

principal offenses under section 1951, robbery or

extortion.

And our position is that that refers back to the

4

Now, the Respondent's position is that the mere

5

act of obstructing commerce, or affecting commerce, or, I

6

suppose, even delaying commerce, is a violation of the

7

Hobbs Act.

8

statutory language that way.

9

is clearly foreclosed.

And I don't think it's possible to read the
So, we think that argument

Now, if there's any doubt about

10

that, based on the language of the Hobbs Act, as amended

11

in 1948, one need only look back to the 1946 version of

12

the Hobbs Act, as originally passed.

13

there's no debate that Congress intended to cover acts or

14

threats of physical violence only if undertaken in

15

furtherance of a plan or purpose to commit robbery or

16

extortion.

17

And there, it --

So, Respondent's position rises or falls on the

18

proposition that in 1948, when Congress recodified and

19

revised all of Title 18 of the U.S. Code, it dramatically

20

expanded the Hobbs Act.

21

and recodification statutes, applies special rules of

22

construction.

23

expression of intent to make a substantive change; and, if

24

there isn't one, it assumes that no substantive change was

25

intended.

This Court, in reviewing revision

It requires a clear statement -- or clear

1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

If you look at the revisor's notes to section

2

1951(a) in the 1948 revision, it's clear that there is no

3

intent to make any substantive change.

4

Court really doesn't need to go any further on that second

5

issue to rule in the Petitioner's favor.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So, I think the

The question is whether the

7

Court should rule on it, as in a matter of first decision.

8

We are a Court of review.

9

whether the Hobbs Act included such a category in the

11

addressing your position is that however strong it may be,

12

it wasn't resolved below, so why shouldn't we follow the

13

natural order that first the District Court speaks, and

14

then the Court of Appeals, and then it comes here?

15

So, the difficulty, the impediment to

MR. UNTEREINER:

Justice Ginsburg, I understand

the concern, but the Seventh Circuit did everything but

18

argument based on the rule of lenity.

argument based on the over-federalization of State crimes.

say it went as far as it possibly could.

saying that there are no predicate acts -- there are no

predicate acts that support this judgment?

Is this imprecision, this

8

MR. UNTEREINER:

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well -Do -- is there some prudential

10

argument for us not to reach this issue and just insist on

11

the wording of our earlier mandate?

12

MR. UNTEREINER:

The Court could certainly come

13

out that way on prudential grounds as a reason to avoid

14

deciding a Hobbs Act issue.

15

Act question is a fairly easy and straightforward one.

16

And the Seventh Circuit's opinion is going to create

17

mischief if left untouched.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But, in our view, the Hobbs

I'm concerned about your

That doesn't sound like

"Not beyond the realm of the possible."

7

everything it could to make it seem like a plausible

issue, as opposed to a very clear issue that should be

resolved in our favor.

10
11

It went out of its way to do that.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't understand how they --

how they could dispose of the case without resolving that.
That's my puzzlement.

13

MR. UNTEREINER:

Well --

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

How -- I mean, can we do that

in a case that comes up here, and just say, "There are

good arguments on both sides, it's quite plausible," and

17

remand the case without resolving the issue?

[Laughter.]

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

They asked the District Court

20

to resolve it.

resolve it in the first instance, and then they would

22

review it, presumably.

23

They said the District Court should

proceedings in the District Court is that it's plausible

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And I think the Court

Of course, the reason they

said it was plausible is that -- and you may well be

right, on the bottom line, and the Government agrees with

you, but there are -- there's a redundancy in the statute.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

It is the position of the United States that the

20

intended robbery or extortion, and that private parties,

21

under RICO, cannot obtain injunctive relief.

22

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Would you not -Would you tell us what --

is favorable to Petitioner's position, I guess that's the

2

end of the case.

3

MS. BLATT:

That's right.

We think what would

4

be appropriate is to recognize that the -- this Court's

5

decision last time around did contain a sweeping statement

6

at the end that all the predicate acts must be reversed.

7

At the same time, the issue of the physical-violence

8

clause was not briefed by the parties, it was not

9

discussed in this Court's opinion, it was not discussed in

10

the Seventh Circuit's opinion.

11

principles are discretionary, and this Court has the

12

discretion to reach the two other issues in the case.

law, because, under the plain language, the physical-

2

physical violence be in furtherance of a violation.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Even though two U.S.

4

attorneys, years back, did predicate cases on there being

5

a discrete crime of obstructing commerce through violent

6

means.

7

MS. BLATT:

That's correct.

And those

8

prosecutions were inconsistent with the written guidance

9

of the Department of Justice in a longstanding

10

interpretation of the Hobbs Act, at least since 1965, that

11

it required an intended robbery or extortion.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

4

of harms that the -- they would read the statute as

right for damages and injunctive relief for blocking

were -- they were denied the ability to do that.

disgorgement under (a).

concerned --

But as far as damages are

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

8

MS. BLATT:

9

Yes.

-- no.

This Court held, in the

Cooper case, which is an antitrust case that was talked

10

about in the Flamingo decision recently, the United States

11

is not a person who is able to sue under the antitrust

12

laws, because -- the general background principle that the

13

United States is not a person.

14

relevant that, after this Court repeatedly held that

15

private parties cannot get injunctive relief, that the

16

United States cannot get damages under the antitrust laws,

17

Congress, in the Clayton Act, passed two express

18

provisions: a Government damages action -- that was in

19

1955, and now it's a treble-damages action -- as well as

20

an express private injunctive action.

21

was this menu of remedies in the antitrust laws of express

22

Government equitable, express Government damages, express

23

private treble damages, and then Government damages.

24

Congress, in RICO, only picked up two of them.

25

up an express, a right for the attorney general to seek

And we think it's highly

injunctive relief and other equitable relief, and it

2

picked up an express right for private parties only to

3

seek treble damages.

4

In light of the holding after holding after

5

holding, we identified six cases that were

6

rendered before the passage of RICO, and the Cooper

7

decision, which said the Government cannot seek damages.

8

We think it's very clear that when Congress borrowed from

9

the antitrust laws, but did not pick up those two express

-- that were

10

rights, that the governing principle is that when Congress

11

borrows a statute that's been definitively construed,

12

Congress adopts that judicial construction along with the

13

statute.

14

two express provisions.

15

And it's particularly relevant because of those

action.

Good morning, Mr. Chief

in this case.

and asked the District Court to determine whether an

6

injunction could remain, based on the four counts of

7

physical violence and threats of violence.

9

applies to physical violence and threats of violence apart

11

court, in this long litigation, had yet discussed the

12

meaning of the Hobbs Act and whether it applies to

13

physical violence and threats of violence apart from

14

extortion and robbery.

15

This made great sense.

No

There's already been a good deal of discussion

16

about what this Court meant in its prior decision.

17

think you find clarification if you look at page 399 of

18

your prior decision, where the Court lists the predicate

19

acts that it was considering.

20

numbers, it adds to 117 predicate acts, but if you go to

21

the jury's verdict, the special interrogatories, they

ever speaking to the question --

20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

It's

Well, I think -- I think, you

21

know, your argument is fine, but the trouble is, if the

22

question is, "Did the Seventh Circuit honor the judgment

23

of this Court?" I think there's a pretty good argument

24

that it not -- that it did not, based upon the fact that

25

we, in effect, summed up everything we were purporting to

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

reversed.

3

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Except, Your Honor, this Court

4

has said that it doesn't decide issues that weren't

5

6

And if you look at page 397 --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You don't have to go into what the issues are

10

11

resolved in order to reverse the judgment, and that

12

weren't, it would seem to me that your remedy would not be

13

to say to the Court of Appeals, "Well, the Supreme Court

14

didn't mean what it said," or, "didn't know what it was

15

doing," but, rather, to move for reconsideration here.

16

And if there were issues that should have been

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

No, Your Honor.

Rehearing is

18

19

And so, it was completely appropriate for the Seventh

20

Circuit to say that this Court considered the issues, in

21

terms of what extortion was about, whether the injunction

22

is permissible under civil RICO.

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

16

there were two issues presented, what "extortion" means

17

under the Hobbs Act and whether injunctions are

permissible under civil RICO.

19

appropriate, then, for Respondents to say this Court

-- consistent with the

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

opinion.

13

this Court clearly said it was dealing with 117 of the

14

acts, and clearly did not mention the four counts of

15

violence and threats of violence under the Hobbs Act --

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, it also said, in

17

the last paragraph, "all of the predicate acts supporting

18

the jury's verdict."

19

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

That's right.

And the

20

question, of course, is, What does "all" refer to here?

21

And I would say, if you go back to page 399, it lists the

22

predicate acts that it's referring to and there --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

But, Your Honor -So, it's quite clear

what "all" was referring to.
MR. CHEMERINSKY:

But, Chief Justice Roberts,

6

then the assumption would have to be that this Court was

7

deciding the four counts, in terms of violence and threats

8

of violence, even though it wasn't presented in the cert

9

petition, even though it wasn't briefed, and even though

10

it was never discussed in this Court's opinion.

11

think it was quite logical for the Seventh Circuit to say

12

the appropriate thing to do is to let the District Court

13

decide whether any injunctive relief was appropriate,

14

based on those four counts; and, if so, what that

15

provision of the Hobbs Act means.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And I

Mr. Chemerinsky, if we turn

17

from what this Court did, or did not, think about last

find, in special interrogatory 4(e), that there was

hearing after the jury verdict, before issuing injunction.

And if, on the basis of the evidence that he heard during

the trial and that special hearing, he found four acts of

its most recent expression said, "It may well be that the

support certainly a nationwide injunction, but perhaps not

15

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

That's correct, Your Honor.

16

That's why it was appropriate for the Seventh Circuit to

remand the case to the District Court, because if the

court were to conclude that an injunction is not

appropriate, then anything that would be said about the

just be an advisory opinion.

The

them, first and then second.

13

As to the first point, you correctly quote the

14

1946 statute, but the 1948 revision was approved by

15

Congress, and it specifically says "robbery or extortion

16

or attempts so to do," comma, "or physical violence or

threats of violence."

United States versus Ron Pair, that commas have to be

like United States versus Wells, and State Farm versus

is that the plain language must be followed.

7

It is that which is

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

requires us to assume that Congress intended a substantive

change when it recodified the Hobbs Act.

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

That's right.

This -- my

11

argument is that the plain language makes clear that

12

Congress did enact a substantive change.

interpret the law as Petitioner suggests, would render the

accomplice.

But the subordinate enforcer

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Chemerinsky, the problem

8

that I have, and Justice Breyer expressed, is, we have the

9

reviser's notes that suggest, "I was just getting rid of

10

extra words.

11

there's not anything to indicate that Congress considered

12

any change in the substance of the Act.

13

I was making this a tighter provision."

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Your Honor, there is almost no

14

legislative history for the 1948 revision.

15

as you rightly say, is the reviser's notes.

16

Court has said that the reviser's notes are not

17

authoritative.

18

occasions, that --

19

And

All there is,
But this

And this Court has said, on so many

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But here's a -- the reviser

20

telling us, "I did this, and I did this to clean up the

21

Act, to make it less wordy."

22

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Yes.

But even if that's

23

regarded as authoritative, this Court has so often said

24

legislative history cannot justify ignoring plain meaning.

25

And, given the comma and the word "or" and the fact that,

43
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

otherwise, the words "by physical violence" would have no

JUSTICE SCALIA:

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well --

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- about the comma.

8
9

Let me --- that's the plain meaning.

I don't --

I don't -- I don't understand your argument on that point.
I mean, it says, "Whoever, in any way or degree,

10

obstructs, delays, or affects commerce or the movement or

11

any article or commodity in commerce by robbery or

12

extortion or attempts or conspires to do so," comma --

13

that's the comma you're talking about?

14

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes.
-- "or threatens physical

16

violence to any person or property," but it continues, "in

or attempt or conspiracy to robbery or extortion.

22

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Now, the only thing that this

No, Your Honor.

Two points

23

here.

24

it's a plan to obstruct, interfere, or affect commerce.

25

The others, Your Honor, you quickly skipped over --

First, it says "a plan."

It's clear, there is --

4

commerce, but obstructing it by robbery, extortion, or

5

attempt or conspiracy to robbery or extortion.

6

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

No, Your Honor.

I think that

7

does deprive the comma or the word "or" meaning.

8

fact, it deprives the title of meaning, because the title

9

here can be used when the title makes clear that it's

10

about violence to obstruct interstate commerce.

I'd also

But that's a jurisdictional

hook, isn't it?
JUSTICE BREYER:

When you see something in a

15

criminal statute that forbids "affecting commerce by,"

16

that means that Congress wants to prevent the conduct that

17

will follow the words "by," and it needs a jurisdictional

18

hook, so it puts in "affecting commerce."

Yes, Your Honor.

Here, what

23

it's saying is that Congress is prohibiting "plans to

obstruct commerce by robbery or extortion or physical

25

violence or threats of violence."

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

is, if somebody is injured in the course of a robbery,

this does -- this does something quite beyond that.

If they

23

at section 1951(b), where it defines "robbery" and

JUSTICE BREYER:

But isn't the reasonable

reading of that, "violence in the course of achieving --

5

opposed to, in effect, a "by-blow against a bystander"?

6

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

No, Your Honor, I don't think

7

so, since the statute defines "robbery" and "extortion,"

8

in 1951(b), specifically to include acts of violence, then

9

all the things we're talking about after the crime would

10

already be part of what's prohibited by the statute.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

12

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

JUSTICE BREYER:

Mr. -It could already be charged --- I want to give you a chance,

because you're quite right in thinking that I'm moved, in

language, but about the change in Federal criminal law.

17

And the change in Federal criminal law, if you're right,

18

way beyond this case, would transform virtually every

19

threat of violence made anywhere in the United States into

20

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Let me start labor law and

then go more generally.

3

Section 1951(c) has a specific provision that

4

makes clear that the Hobbs Act was not meant to change the

5

protection of labor unions.

6

the statutory references in 1951(c) is to a statute

7

protecting labor unions.

8

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

And, in fact, every one of

Enmons specifically says -What does it -- 1951(c) says

what?
MR. CHEMERINSKY:

It lists -- it says "nothing

11

in this statute is meant to alter the protections of," and

12

then it lists a whole number of statutes, and those are

13

all statutes that protect labor unions.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yeah, but I -- then perhaps I

15

-- that's an old statute, 1951(c), isn't it?

16

something brand new?

17

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

23

Is it

Well, this is the Hobbs Act.
Yeah.
Section 3 -All right.

What is it --

-- of the Hobbs Act.
Well, the case that interpreted

the Hobbs Act, which is Enmons --

24

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Right.
-- seems to rely, for the

labor-union exemption, on the fact that a threat of

2

violence in an effort to obtain legitimate wages is not

3

within the Act.

4

the Act, then I guess we would be left with "the threat of

5

violence."

6

But if we read "legitimate wages" out of

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

No, Your Honor.

And the

7

reason is, Enmons says there's a special legislative

8

history of the Hobbs Act specifically about labor.

9

Enmons concluded that if the violence is part of a strike

And

10

to pursue lawful union activities, it is not actionable

11

under the Hobbs Act.

12

here would change that specific protection of unions, one

13

that's codified in the statute.

14

Nothing that this Court would decide

As to your former question, nor would ruling in

15

favor of Respondents here change the criminal laws you

16

suggest.

threats of violence.

interpretation --

The statute would only apply to a plan to

Your Honor, this is an

JUSTICE BREYER:
wrong.

No, the -- it's not a -- that's

It says "affect commerce."

22

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

Right.
And, therefore, we have the

24

instance of any threat of violence that affects commerce

25

2

know, I believe almost everything affects commerce.

3

if I'm even close to being right, this is a major

4

incursion of Federal law, serious criminal Federal law,

5

into what could be fairly minor matters of State criminal

6

law.

7

And, of course, in today's world, as you

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

And

No, Your Honor, because of the

8

importance of the word "plan."

9

to Justice Scalia earlier.

And this goes to my answer

The fact that it has to be a

10

plan to obstruct or affect interstate commerce is an

11

important limitation here.

12

this is the position that the United States Government

13

took for at least 25 years -- from the Franks case, in

14

1974, to the Milton case, in the Fourth Circuit in 1998,

15

the Yankowski case, in 1999 -- and it hasn't had those

16

effects.

17

solution is for Congress to change the statute, but not

18

for this Court to ignore the plain meaning of the law.

19

And it's key to remember that

But if it does, Your Honor, then the appropriate

courts to have jurisdiction to issue injunctions.

22

the Sherman Act provision that only authorized the

Government to seek injunctive relief, section 1964(a)

25

This Court has said, in many instances, as Chief Justice

Roberts pointed out, such as Franklin versus Gwinnett

2

County, that when Federal courts have jurisdiction, they

3

retain equitable power unless Congress expressly stripped

4

that authority.

5

So --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, your friend's

6

answer was that that was an implied right-of-action case;

7

and, therefore, the remedies had not been spelled out; and

8

so, you assume the broader remedies.

9

that answer?

10

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

What's wrong with

No, Your Honor, because this

11

Court has said, in any instance, Federal courts have

equitable power unless Congress has expressly stripped it

13

of that power.

14

example where this Court said that, as well as the

15

language from Franklin versus Gwinnett County.

16

especially true here, where Congress, in the RICO statute,

17

specifically said that it should be broadly construed.

18

This Court, in Sedima versus Imrex, said especially as to

19

the remedial provision, section 1964, this should be broad

20

construction.

21

United States versus Umansky would be an

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And that's

As you read it, can a private

22

party get a preliminary injunction?

23

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

No, Your Honor, in terms of

24

the Government is specifically authorized by 1964(b) to get

25

a preliminary injunction.

And the reason for that is,

53
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

generally the Government can't get injunctions to stop

2

criminal activity.

3

say 1964(a), to go to your specific question, would

4

authorize anyone to be able to go to the Federal court to

5

use any of the Federal court's inherent powers.

6
7

1964(b) was added for that.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So, a private party could get

an -- not only permanent, but preliminary --

8

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

10

But I'd

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Yes, Your Honor.
-- injunction.
Yes.

1964(b) was added

11

because of the traditional common-law rule that the

12

Government generally can't get such injunctions.

13

Our position is simple.

We believe that the

14

Hobbs Act was changed precisely to deal with the

15

situations where there might be a radical animal-activist

16

group that might be blowing up restaurants that serve

17

meat, or clothing stores, or where there might be

18

situations where racists were blowing up businesses owned

19

by blacks or Jews.

20

the RICO statute provides, as Congress intended, a broad

21

remedial scheme.

22

That's what the Hobbs Act does.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And

Mr. Chemerinsky, I -- you said

23

earlier that our -- that we "reversed and remanded."

24

was not in our opinion, though, as it sometimes is,

25

"Therefore, you know, the case is remanded."

That

It doesn't

Our opinion here just says "reversed."
MR. CHEMERINSKY:

But, Your Honor, this

case --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

It just says --- obviously was sent back --- "reversed."

8

And the Seventh Circuit then had to interpret what this

Court decided.

10
11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

And they interpreted

Because this Court had not

"reversed" to mean "remanded."

12
13

And --

I see.
-- the four acts -I see.
-- of violence and threats of

violence.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So, that enabled them to say

20

that what we meant was not "reversed," but "reversed and

21

remanded."

22

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

What this -- what the Seventh

23

Circuit did was look at this Court's opinion and see that

24

the statement of the issues, on page 397 --

line of our opinion, which said "reversed."

2

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

But, Your Honor, that would

3

then assume that this Court decided an issue about the

4

meaning of the Hobbs Act that was never presented in the

5

cert petitions, never briefed, never addressed in the

6

opinion.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

They made the assumption that

8

this Court has an obligation to reason why, and there was

9

no reason why given as to those four counts.

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

That's right.

No discussion

whatsoever, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's a broad principle.

13

Whenever a Court of Appeals thinks that we haven't really

14

resolved all the issues in the case, they can ignore our

15

order that says "reversed."

16

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Of course not, Your Honor.

17

What the Seventh Circuit had to decide was, What about the

18

four counts of violence or threats of violence that were

19

found by the jury?

20

Court of Appeals did exactly the right thing, sent it back

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

And

MR. UNTEREINER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

I just want to make a few very quick points.
First, I heard Mr. Chemerinsky say that the

19

third clause was unnecessary in the Hobbs Act, because

20

robbery and extortion necessarily involve acts or threats

21

of violence.

22

Hobbs Act also covers official extortion, which does not

23

require acts or threats of violence.

I just would like to point out that the

Secondly, on the Enmons point that Justice

25

Breyer was asking about, you're quite right, Justice

conduct, so that's a red herring.

10

Enmons did not rely, in any

It

But those laws don't protect violent

And, number three, I'd just like to point out

11

that in this Court's last decision in this case, the Court

12

made clear that coercion is not covered by the Hobbs Act.

13
14

But under the Respondent's reading, some acts of coercion
would, in fact, be covered by the Hobbs Act.

15

Finally, we'd just like to reiterate our request

16

that, if the Court rules in our favor, it make very clear,

17

in remanding the case, that judgment should be entered in

favor of Petitioners.
