ORAL ARGUMENT OF KATHRYN GRILL GRAEFF

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

MS. GRAEFF:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

10

In Edwards versus Arizona, this Court held that a

11

suspect has a choice, after invocation of the right to counsel,

12

to change his mind and initiate further contact with the

13

police.

14

should be taken away, and a suspect's decision to speak

15

presumed involuntary, when a police officer first makes an

16

improper comment.

17

The question in this case is whether that choice

The answer should be no when the impropriety is

18

cured.

19

person in the suspect's position would understand that it was

20

the suspect's choice whether to speak or remain silent and that

21

the police would honor that choice and stop questioning, a

22

decision to speak should be deemed initiation, under Edwards.

23

When, under all of the circumstances, a reasonable

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Now, what has to be considered,

24

by way of evidence, in evaluating whether the suspect has

25

initiated the additional conversation?

Is it appropriate, in

this case, to consider the age of the person?
MS. GRAEFF:

Yes.

I think you would look at a

reasonable person in --

MS. GRAEFF:

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

And --

-- the suspect's --- and the fact that, on the

7

charges which he saw, it said he was subject to the death

8

penalty, but that was not correct?

9
10

MS. GRAEFF:

That would go to whether the statement

was voluntary, it would not go to --

11

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

12

MS. GRAEFF:

13

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

14

It would not --

-- the degree --- you would not consider it in

connection with the initiation --

15

MS. GRAEFF:

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

17

MS. GRAEFF:

No, the --- question?

No, the purpose of Edwards was to

18

prevent police badgering.

19

conveys, directly or indirectly, that the police are going to

20

continue questioning until they get a statement, despite the

21

invocation of the right to counsel.

To prevent police conduct that,

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I -Counsel --- I suppose that if they

knowingly put death on in order to get him off his balance,

that would be badgering, wouldn't it?

2

MS. GRAEFF:

The -- the purpose of Edwards was to

3

prevent police questioning.

4

conveys that, the police are not going to question any longer.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MS. GRAEFF:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So, when a curative measure

Well, but --

The --- the initial question Justice

8

O'Connor asked is, Do we consider these other factors?

9

then -- but you're talking now about curing.

10

MS. GRAEFF:

11

consider what -- the death sentence.

12

--

13

And

And my answer is no, that we do not

JUSTICE SOUTER:

There's two.

In Bradshaw

Then why consider age?

I mean, the

14

-- both of them go to the same point, and that is, What would a

15

reasonable person suppose the suspect's understanding was at

16

that point?

17

was, in fact, initiating conversation, rather than responding

18

to the police or doing something irrational?

19

why the -- in effect, the false statement about the death

20

penalty -- or true statement about the death penalty, for that

21

matter -- doesn't go to the same point, just as the suspect's

22

age goes to it.

23

And would it be fair to conclude that the suspect

MS. GRAEFF:

And I don't see

Because the critical inquiry is whether

24

the suspect understood that it was his choice and that the

25

police would stop questioning.

don't think you necessarily lose your case, but it seems to me

that at least these have to be considered in determining

something else, you look at whether there was a cure in the

4

sense that the suspect understood his rights --

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Ms. Graeff, is there any case which

6

says that an initiation is not voluntary, as opposed to a

7

confession being not voluntary, because the suspect has been

8

charged with a crime greater than what the police believe they

9

can prove, or if the police advise him that he's been charged

10

with a greater crime than what he's really been charged with?

11

Is there any case which says that the effect of that is to

12

cause his initiation of discussion to be involuntary?

13

MS. GRAEFF:

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Not that I'm aware of.
Do you take -May I –-- the position that initiation is

17

a purely formal inquiry, a matter of magic words?

the equivalent of, "I guess I'll talk to you," that's all you

look at?

-- you're avoiding my question.

I'm sorry.
My question is, Is the act of

8

initiation a purely formal act on your view, so that so long as

9

the suspect says the magic words, it doesn't matter what is in

10

his mind or what he understands?

11

MS. GRAEFF:

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

13

MS. GRAEFF:

Is it formal or not formal?

No.
It's not formal.

What you need to look at is whether an

that questioning was going to cease, and there was -- would be

no more questioning.

simply wonder if the fact that it's subjectively true, and

there is a finding that the defendant -- here, we have 30

19

minutes, and we have the fact that the other detective said,

"He said he can't talk to us.

We have that.

Is there anything else?

MS. GRAEFF:

We have that Detective Johns then

initiation was terminated.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.

-- then when Detective Johns came back,

28 minutes, he didn't say anything.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

6

MS. GRAEFF:

Yes.

He didn't ask any questions.

7

the police.

So --

May I ask --- we have a passage -May I ask you two rather

elementary questions?

14

MS. GRAEFF:

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Yes.
One of the issues is whether

--

16

when he spoke and said, "Can I talk now?" -- was that voluntary

17

or not?

18

voluntary, the State or the defendant, in your view?

19
20

Who has the burden on whether it was, or not,

MS. GRAEFF:

The state has the burden to show that

he initiated.

21

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And so, the State did have the

22

burden.

23

the judge who heard the evidence said they had not met the

24

burden?

25

And what is your view on the fact that the trial --

What kind of deference is owing to that finding?
MS. GRAEFF:

We think none, because the trial court

those voluntariness factors should be looked at, in terms of

initiation, although I just think the analysis would be exactly

the same as if you were asking whether he made a voluntary

Now, in the -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I'm not so sure, because a

voluntary waiver is measured against a Miranda warning.

17

by definition here, you don't have a Miranda warning, because

18

we're asking about "whether initiation."

19

there's a threshold inquiry of voluntariness to determine

20

whether or not there was a voluntary initiation, and that that

would have said, then, 24 hours doesn't make a difference.

there can never be a cure, if there's a violation because the

Well, assuming --

overreaching on the part of Officer Reese, my question is, Is

15

there any circumstance in which that overreaching can be cured?

And I thought your answer is that, yes, that with the
sufficient passage of time, it can be cured.
MR. RAVENELL:

No, with all due respect, Your Honor,

that was not my answer.

Your Honor that I will not change that position -- it should

a factor.

things this Court said earlier -- and I think is correct, from

to the factfinder?

not give the same deferential treatment to Judge North's

it was, kind of, a good-faith violation.

Appeals of Maryland said, "We're going to look at this in the

23

legal sense, not the dictionary sense."

24

MR. RAVENELL:

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Correct.
And that's what we're reviewing

MR. RAVENELL:

And I think that when we review that

3

in a mixed question of fact or law, giving all deference to the

4

trial court's finding, as this Court has in the past in the

5

cases I've cited, that, in fact, there is -- was a violation,

6

the violation was not cured, and that, even if this Court

7

establishes curative measures, those measures must be designed

8

to put the suspect back in the position that he was in prior to

9

the police violation of his rights.

We think that it is a

10

dangerous path to go down to allow the police to abuse a

11

suspect's rights, and then cure it.

12

One of the things I believe we learned from what

13

occurred in Elstad and then in Seibert is that -- and, in fact,

14

in the plurality opinion in Seibert, this Court pointed out

15

that after Elstad, some 20-something years, the police created

16

policies and strategies designed to violate what -- the first

17

question first.

18

out that not only did the police create that strategy, what the

19

police, in fact, started doing was omitting Miranda altogether.

20

And, in fact, the plurality opinion pointed

And this Court made reference to that in U.S. versus Harris,

21

that what the police will do, if you give them the opportunity,

22

they will abuse the rights and attempt to cure --

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, but if you're looking -- if

24

you're taking your standard seriously --

25

MR. RAVENELL:

Yes.

JUSTICE BREYER:

The reason that my -- I was able to

give my hypothetical before --

3

MR. RAVENELL:

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

Sure.
-- the reason that you'd have to

5

say, "You will not be better off -- you will not be worse off

6

in respect to the death penalty, by -- you know, we -- it

7

won't" --

8

MR. RAVENELL:

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

10

Right.
-- "make you any better off to talk

to the lawyer" --

11

Sorry.

12

The reason that the policeman, to cure, would have

Strike.

13

to say, "Look, it's not going to help you, in respect to the

14

death penalty, to talk without your lawyer," is because that

15

was the implication of his question, that was the implication -

MR. RAVENELL:

Exactly.
The implication was, "You're not

going to get death if you talk to us without a lawyer."

22

MR. RAVENELL:

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

Correct.
But if it had been some other

24

questions, some questions, for example, about the crime, all

25

you would have had to do was eliminate whatever negative

nothing.

MR. RAVENELL:

JUSTICE BREYER:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Correct.
So timely -But there is no finding to support

6

the suggestion that it was just the death penalty that

7

concerned him.

fact that his accomplice, Tolbert, had implicated him, and --

9

He was also concerned, I thought, about the

MR. RAVENELL:

Yes.

MR. RAVENELL:

MR. RAVENELL:

So is --

And the trial -There's just no finding that it

was simply the death penalty that --

17

MR. RAVENELL:

I agree.

And the trial court made

18

clear that she was considering everything.

19

important is that the trial court got a chance to hear Mr.

20

Blake testify.

But what's

The trial court --

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

22

MR. RAVENELL:

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And --

-- understood --- his concern with Tolbert was a

24

wholly legitimate reason for him to want to talk to the police

25

MR. RAVENELL:

We do not dispute that at all.

But

5

what is important is that the trial judge got a chance to

assess all of those factors, and the trial judge, even after

7

assessing those factors, concluded that what impacted -- that

there was still a great impact on him.

Government's burden --

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. RAVENELL:

And it is the

All right, so --- it was their burden --- maybe you should modify the

standard.

an improper line of questioning, after the warning, that the

15

police either have to negative the implication of those

16

questions, the relevant implication, or the State has to show

17

that some other series of independent events, such as Justice

18

Kennedy mentioned, made the difference.

That is, caused the

19

later request to talk without a lawyer.

the one or the other, then they lose.

I certainly believe that, from the

teachings of Seibert and from other cases, that this Court

clearly seemed to be leaning towards cure, that there can be

cures.

the fact that he thinks, and has been led to believe,

anything to do with the question that Edwards asks, which is

whether the police, or this individual, initiated the

conversation.

That is the issue in these cases -I think the problem --- whether the police initiated the

MR. RAVENELL:

And I think that all those things are

factors that the Court can consider in deciding whether Blake

7

voluntarily initiated the contact.

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, I don't think so.

I think they

9

go to whether the confession he gave was voluntary, but I don't

10

see how they have anything to do with whether he initiated the

11

conversation.

12

MR. RAVENELL:

Your Honor, with all due respect,

The trial court found, after hearing Blake testify, hearing

other witnesses, that Blake was merely -- and I'd say merely,

but very importantly -- responding to what Officer Reese said,

not initiating a new conversation, that it was a continuous

matter of only 28 minutes.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So, your position, I guess, is -- I

7

think it is, in your last answer -- that we really shouldn't be

phrasing the inquiry in terms of the voluntariness of the

suspect's statement, at this point.

We, rather, should be

10

focusing it on whether the statement was, in fact, a

spontaneous initiation on his part or a response to the

preceding police statement.
