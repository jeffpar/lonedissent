ORAL ARGUMENT OF JENNIFER G. PERKELL

7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

8
9

MS. PERKELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

The question presented in this case is whether,

11

in enacting the Prison Litigation Reform Act's exhaustion

12

requirement, Congress intended to require inmates to

13

comply with administrative grievance procedures or whether

14

Congress intended to permit inmates to ignore those

15

procedures.

16

Petitioners submit that Congress intended to

17

require inmates to comply with administrative grievance

18

procedures, for three principal reasons:

19

One, the established principle of exhaustion in

20

the administrative law context requires a grievance -- a

21

grievant to timely comply with administrative agency

22

proceedings.

23

Two, in enacting the Prison Litigation Reform

24

Act's exhaustion requirement, Congress was responding to

25

this Court's decision in McCarthy v. Madigan, in which

3
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

this Court presumed that an express or mandatory

2

exhaustion requirement for prisoners would necessitate

3

compliance with prison filing deadlines.

4

And, three, Congress's objectives in enacting

5

the Prison Litigation Reform Act's exhaustion requirement

6

are directly facilitated by a rule in which inmates must

7

comply with administrative grievance procedures, including

8

filing deadlines; whereas, those objectives are invariably

9

subverted when an inmate is permitted to ignore those

10
11

procedures.
In the administrative law context, the

12

established principle of exhaustion generally requires

13

that a grievant comply with administrative agency

14

proceedings in a proper and timely manner in order to be

15

able to proceed to Federal Court.

16

has, indeed, enacted an administrative exhaustion

17

requirement.

18

Congress was attempting to bring the exhaustion rule for

19

prisoners more into line with established administrative

20

exhaustion rules that apply in other contexts.

21

In this case, Congress

Even the court of appeals agreed that in so doing

JUSTICE SOUTER:

What do you say to the argument

22

that that really is an inapposite argument because the 1983

23

proceeding is de novo?

24

MS. PERKELL:

25

I would suggest -- I -- we concede

there's that distinction.

However, I would suggest it's

4
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

irrelevant for purposes of how Congress would have

2

understood the term "exhaust" in enacting the statute.

3

The definition of the "principle of exhaustion" in

4

administrative law is one in which there's an obligation

5

to comply with the agency's grievance proceedings.

6

so, that is the definition of exhaustion that Congress was

7

presumably -- I would suggest was presumably invoking in

8

this context.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And

But that's the -- a function

10

of -- you want the first-line decisionmaker -- you need

11

that decision, because, at the second rung, in -- at the

12

court level, deference is owed to it.

13

setting, there's no deference owed to it.

14

think that this kind of requirement, that you must file

15

someplace else first, a place that won't get deference, is

16

more like the EEOC example and the Age Discrimination Act.

17

MS. PERKELL:

But in the prison
So, I would

Well, Your Honor, in the first

instance -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'm sorry, Ms. Perkell,

could I ask you to speak up just a bit?

21

MS. PERKELL:

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

23

MS. PERKELL:

24

Again, we're submitting that Congress understood

25

Oh, sure.

I -Thanks.

-- I apologize.

the term "exhaust" in a particular way, given how it's

5
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

just generally used in the administrative context.

2

with respect to the EEOC context, we think that that is

3

inapposite, because primarily that -- the relevant

4

statutes in those contexts invoke the word "commence,"

5

which --

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

7

MS. PERKELL:

Invoke what?

The word "commence" instead of

8

"exhaust," which this Court has expressly, again,

9

distinguished from an exhaustion requirement.

10

And

Moreover, under those statutes Congress has

11

limited the meaning of "commencement" in such a way that

12

this Court has interpreted Congress to expressly preclude

13

the possibility of a procedural default by virtue of a

14

failure to comply with State filing provisions.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Are you -- are you saying,

16

then, that those two go together, they're inextricably

17

tied together?

18

embedded in it is always a procedural default rule?

19

If you've got an exhaustion rule, then

MS. PERKELL:

I'm suggesting in that -- in the

20

-- excuse me -- in the administrative law context, which

21

is the context in which Congress was legislating under

22

this statute, that that is, indeed, the established

23

conception of that term.

24
25

JUSTICE BREYER:
special here.

They're saying that it's

If you look at the language of the text,

13

that language, nobody thought that was a procedure default

14

rule; it just meant the judge, if there's a remedy

15

available, can say, "Prisoner, go do it," in an

16

appropriate case.

17

at the history, is, they changed the "may" to a "must."

And all the people that wrote in were writing in about

that.

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

MS. PERKELL:

Well, I would suggest that, in

2

part, the language of the CRIPA, which is -- I believe, is

3

-- that's how I pronounce it; I believe that's what Your

4

Honor is referring to -- in part, precluded the

5

possibility of a default -- procedural default bar largely

6

because it required a continuance of a case for 90 -- or I

7

believe it started out as 180 days, and then became 90

8

days.

9

inmate to go back and exhaust -- and under those

And -- in order to permit the judge to order the

10

circumstances, even if he had been untimely by virtue of

11

the continuance language, he was, nonetheless, permitted

12

to return to Federal Court.

13

language of the statute, it's at least possible that

14

Congress had a -- deliberately excluded that possibility.

So, I think by virtue of the

15

Moreover, I think that the statutory history and

16

the statutory purposes in this case support the conclusion

17

that Congress intended inmates to require with applicable

18

grievance proceedings.

19

And if I may refer to the statutory history, in

20

this Court -- excuse me, in Booth v. Churner, this Court

21

recognized that this Court's prior decision in McCarthy v.

22

Madigan constituted a substantial portion of the statutory

23

history from the PLRA's exhaustion requirement.

24

relevant part, for purposes of the question presented here,

25

that decision observed that -- or assumed that an exhaustion --

And, in

8
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

a mandatory exhaustion requirement for prisoners would

2

necessitate the compliance of administrative filing

3

deadlines.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But that was a comment made

5

when the decision itself held that there was no

6

exhaustion.

7

in Madigan was in favor of the Petitioner.

The -- wasn't that so?

8

MS. PERKELL:

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

10
11

MS. PERKELL:

That is so.

I mean, the holding

This Court --

I mean McCarthy.

This Court made that observation.

It was one of two grounds upon which this Court relied in

12

holding that this Court would not judicially impose a

13

mandatory exhaustion requirement for prisoners under that

14

decision.

15

the text of the former version of 1997(e), and, in the

16

second part of this decision, this Court said,

17

"Nonetheless, notwithstanding that the statute doesn't

18

expressly require exhaustion, we will not judicially

19

impose exhaustion in this case for the reason that such a

20

requirement would, indeed, represent a possibility of

21

forfeiture of a claim for an inmate's failure to comply

22

with deadlines."

23

So, the first part of the decision evaluated

And, again, as this Court recognized in Booth v.

24

Churner, that decision is a significant part of the

25

statutory history of this provision, and this Court

9
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

presumed that Congress was responding to that decision

2

when it revised 1997(e).

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, there was -- in

4

McCarthy, itself, the wording was something that -- of the

5

kind proposed.

6

referring to -- what was proposed was a rule that would

7

incorporate a procedural default motion.

8

just from the -- reading that opinion.

9

And so, it's not clear whether it's

MS. PERKELL:

It's not clear,

Your Honor, I would respectfully

10

dispute that, in that our reading of the opinion, as well

11

as the Government's brief in that case, seemed to propose

12

no unusual rule of exhaustion.

13

of exhaustion that was being discussed was an ordinary

14

rule of exhaustion.

15

anything unusual about the exhaustion concept that was at

16

issue in that case.

17
18
19

It appeared that the rule

So, I don't believe that there was

Finally, I would submit that Congress's purposes
in enacting -JUSTICE BREYER:

Before you get to the purposes,

20

you quote in your brief -- the only legislative history I

21

could find here -- you said that Congressman LoBiondo

22

referred to McCarthy, which you find relevant, because

23

McCarthy indicated that the word "exhaustion" would carry

24

along with it a procedural default rule.

25

Congressman say?

So, what did the

The significance of excerpting

17

MS. PERKELL:

Well --- in which case, what we have

Is that right?
Your Honor, I think there are two

18

relevant things about that statement.

19

significance of his referencing the McCarthy case and

20

demonstrating affirmatively that Congress was, indeed,

21

aware of that decision when it revised the statute.

22

moreover, it was another iteration of the purposes that

23

Congress sought to achieve through enactment of the

24

statute.

25

First is the

But,

So, speaking to the third point, which was

11
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

purposes of the statute, our position is that those

2

purposes are directly served by a rule in which inmates

3

are required to comply with administrative grievance

4

proceedings.

5

By contrast, those rules are subverted by a rule

6

in which an inmate is permitted to file an untimely

7

appeal, which is rejected on procedural grounds, and

8

which, therefore, receives the benefit of no prior

9

administrative review.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

11

MS. PERKELL:

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In thinking --

It's --- of what Congress might

13

have meant, one part of the picture is, we're not dealing

14

with statutes of limitations enacted by legislatures.

15

We're dealing with grievance procedures that vary from

16

State to State, and maybe even from prison to prison.

17

some of them have a very short span.

18

said some of them are 2, 3, 5 days.

19

MS. PERKELL:

And

I think the brief

That is correct.

Those were

20

proceedings that were noted on one of the briefs.

21

it's reasonable to presume that Congress was aware of the

22

variety of prison filing deadlines when it enacted this

23

statute.

24

that Congress intended for those -- for whatever grievance

25

procedure the State sets forth to be governing in this

I think

And I also think that it's reasonable to presume

12
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

instance.

2

of the statute, the CRIPA, Congress had required that

3

grievance proceedings comply with specified standards,

4

specified Federal standards.

5

the statute, Congress dispensed with those requirements.

6

And I think that the obvious conclusion to draw from that

7

change was that Congress was intending for -- whatever

8

prison procedures are established in any given situation

9

are those that are going to govern the inmate's appeal

10
11

And this is because, under the former version

And in the new version of

process.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

So, you would treat a State

12

with a 2-day statute of limitations just like your State,

13

with a 15-day statute.

14

MS. PERKELL:

I think the -- always, the

15

relevant inquiry, especially in light of the statute -- or

16

precisely because of the statutory language, the inquiry

17

is whether or not remedies are, indeed, available and

18

capable of use by the inmates.

19

facts, yes, I would treat a 2-day --

Yes, but the abuse was not

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

there's no judge that would decide that, which you said,

this is all for the internal procedure.

MS. PERKELL:

That is correct.

And, again, the

6

district court could be called upon to address that

7

question, as appears to be the case here, and the district

8

court would endeavor to apply the rules of the grievance

9

proceeding to the facts regarding exhaustion.

If, in the

10

event the grievance proceeding didn't, for instance,

11

sufficiently put the inmate on notice, didn't provide

12

clarity on whether or not -- on what he had to do under

13

circumstances where there's a continuing consequence to a

14

decision, perhaps in that instance it would be appropriate

15

for the district court to decide, yes, indeed, he had

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAN HIMMELFARB

3

FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

4

IN SUPPORT OF PETITIONERS

5
6
7

MR. HIMMELFARB:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The United States agrees with Petitioners'

8

submission that the Ninth Circuit's decision is

9

inconsistent with the text, history, and purposes of the

10

PLRA exhaustion requirement.

11

Circuit's decision has consequences that Congress could

12

not have intended.

13

We would add that the Ninth

To begin with, under the Ninth Circuit's

14

interpretation, a prisoner can wait years to file an

15

administrative claim, such that it is virtually certain

16

that the prison will reject the claim as untimely and not

17

decide the claim on the merits.

18

from not requiring an exhaustion requirement -- not

19

requiring exhaustion at all.

20

concedes -- this is on page 43 of his brief -- that, under

21

his interpretation, if the prison system does not give

22

prison decisionmakers any discretion to decide an untimely

23

claim, the prisoner would not have to file an

24

administrative claim at all.

25

wait for the filing deadline to pass.

That is hardly different

Indeed, Respondent candidly

All he would have to do is

20
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

In addition, if the Ninth Circuit's

2

interpretation is correct, the PLRA would be the only

3

context in the law in which a claimant who is required to

4

exhaust would be able to get into Federal Court by virtue

5

of untimely exhaustion; that is, without complying with

6

filing deadlines.

7

Congress intended to adopt such a uniquely forgiving

8

exhaustion rule as part of a statute whose very purpose

9

was to combat abusive litigation by prisoners.

It would be odd, to put it mildly, if

10

Respondent's submission is that the

11

administrative law principle, the established

12

administrative law principle, that exhaustion requires

13

compliance with the agency's procedural rules, is

14

inapplicable here, because what we're dealing with is what

15

he calls an original proceeding rather than a review

16

proceeding.

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is his best case, your

18

brother's best case, in your view -- and you probably --

19

may not think of it as a very persuasive case -- Fay and

Would Respondent tell us,

12

well, that at least in some administrative law schemes,

13

generally there is a requirement that the exhaustion

14

period must be reasonable?

15

MR. HIMMELFARB:

Well, the -- this Court has

16

made clear, in various cases, including in the very

17

context of the exhaustion provision at issue here, in the

18

Booth versus Churner decision, that there are no

19

exceptions to the exhaustion -- to an administrative

20

exhaustion requirement when Congress provides otherwise;

21

that is, in the context of statutory, as opposed to a

22

judge-made, exhaustion requirement.

23

what is required under the PLRA is exhaustion of available

24

administrative remedies.

25

hypotheticals that the Court was suggesting -- for

It is the case that

1

example, if there were a 6-hour filing deadline; and, as

2

far as I'm aware, there is no prison that has a 6-hour

3

filing deadline -- but, if there were, and in that

4

particular case, for some reason, the prisoner were unable

5

to comply with the deadline, because, for example, forms

6

were unavailable or he was in a hospital bed,

7

incapacitated, or he was in solitary confinement, I think

8

it would be appropriate for a Federal Court to conclude

9

that the remedy at issue was not available; and,

10

therefore, that he didn't have to pursue that remedy; he

11

would be able to get into Federal Court, assuming he had

12

otherwise complied with the prison's procedural

13

requirements.

13

Our only point, Justice Breyer,

is that it wouldn't be appropriate for a court to look at

17

there were, for example, a 24-hour filing deadline, our

submission is that it wouldn't be appropriate for a court

19

to look at that deadline and say, "We think that that's

20

just too short, and, therefore, unreasonable."

21

only be appropriate to say that the remedy wasn't

22

available if -- regardless of the length of the filing

deadline -- in a particular case, the facts were such that

The case on which Respondent places --

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Would that apply to a prisoner

5

who claimed he'd been raped by a guard or something, but

6

was afraid to bring the proceeding, for 2 or 3 weeks,

7

until the guard was transferred to another facility?

8

he alleged those facts, and then he was denied relief

9

because it was over 15 days.

10

MR. HIMMELFARB:

And

Would that be --

Justice Stevens, I think there

11

would be cases -- and that might be one of them -- that

there were explicit threats --

would have to be litigated in connection with a motion to

and could prove, for example, that he received explicit

That's right.

But there -- you

would -- you would often have factual issues in connection

5

-- maybe not "often" -- you would sometimes have factual

issues in connection with a motion to dismiss which might

transform it, in effect, into a motion for summary

9

prison.

And that might be an example -- I think that

10

would be a rare case, but that might be an example of

11

where that would happen.

12

I do want to respond to Respondent's reliance on

13

the Oscar Mayer case.

14

and this case is that that case did not involve an

The requirement was one of commencement.

complete his remedies.

with a limited opportunity to obtain relief in the State

3

The PLRA exhaustion provision was enacted to

4

give the prison a full and fair opportunity, not a limited

5

opportunity, to provide relief before a prisoner is

entitled to go into Federal Court.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why did they use the word

"until," instead of the word "unless"?
MR. HIMMELFARB:

There are lots of statutory

different types of language.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MEIR FEDER

21

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

22
23

25

MR. FEDER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
There are three basic reasons that a procedural
default rule should not be read into the PLRA.

The first

28
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

is, the text of section 1997(e) is most naturally read as

2

requiring simple exhaustion, which is satisfied once --

3

when there are no remedies available at the time the suit

4

is filed.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I would -- I would not describe

6

"exhaustion" that way.

7

failure to file within the prescribed time, not as an

8

exhaustion of remedies, but as a failure to exhaust

9

remedies.

10
11

I would -- I would describe a

I mean, I guess I'm having a terminological

problem in this case, as I did in the previous case.
MR. FEDER:

Well, Your Honor, I think -- I think

12

that in the habeas cases the Court has consistently read

13

"exhaustion" as referring simply to "no remedies presently

14

available."

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, well, we're talking about

16

administrative law, which is a field I used to know

17

something about, and I've never thought "exhaustion"

18

included "failure to exhaust," which --

19

MR. FEDER:

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

21

MR. FEDER:

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

23
24
25

Well --- which is --

-- first --- what happens when you simply

don't file within the prescribed period.
MR. FEDER:

Well, first of all, Your Honor, I

don't think we're -- that administrative law is the

29
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

appropriate analogy here.

2

why habeas provides a much closer source of meaning for

3

the word and concept of "exhaustion" here, both because of

4

the similarity of the language in the exhaustion provision

5

here, and the habeas exhaustion provision, because of the

6

fact that both are prisoner litigation.

7

overlap between habeas cases and section 1983 cases in

8

this context.

9

There are a number of reasons

There is an

And --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I'm not sure.

It seems

10

to me, as Justice Scalia's question indicates -- I was

11

surprised that we're talking about procedural default.

12

too, thought this was an administrative law case.

13

it's an administrative law case, because we want the input

14

of the administrative -- of the administrative body.

15

the habeas cases, we're simply giving deference as a

16

matter of comity and courtesy to the State Courts.

17

--

18

MR. FEDER:

I,

And

In

Is it

Well, actually, Your Honor, I don't

19

think there's any indication that Congress was focused on

20

input from the prison grievance system.

21

-- the way it works is that once the prison grievance

22

system addresses the claim that's of no effect in the

23

subsequent Federal suit, which starts over from square one

24

--

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In fact, the way

Well, not so much maybe input,

30
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

but so that they can -- they can resolve the program --

2

the problem within the institution, and not have to come

3

to the courts.

4

MR. FEDER:

Well, two things.

First, as I say,

5

there are a number of reasons why, in looking at the

6

language Congress was using, it's more reasonable to look

7

to the habeas statute.

8

context, this is dramatically different from most

9

administrative law circumstances, because in those

But even in the administrative law

10

situations you have an administrative decision that is in

11

some way being reviewed, the administrative agency record

12

may have some effect.

13

review, and the administrative context that is close to

14

this, if you're looking for an administrative analogy, is

15

the Title VII and Age Discrimination Act cases, because

16

those cases, similarly, provided for invocation of State

17

remedies that were designed to give the State an

18

opportunity to resolve the case voluntarily, if that would

19

satisfy the prospective plaintiff, but if the plaintiff

20

were not satisfied, he'd be able to move on.

21

Here, you don't have that aspect of

And I think that both opposing counsel have made

22

a point of saying that the Oscar Mayer case pointed out

23

that it was not an exhaustion requirement in Oscar Mayer,

24

but, rather, that it used the word "commence."

25

think it's important to look at what the Court said it

But I

31
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

meant by saying it wasn't an exhaustion requirement.

2

this is at 441 U.S. at 761, and the Court said, "section

3

14(b) does not stipulate an exhaustion requirement.

4

section is intended only to give State agencies a limited

5

opportunity to settle the grievances of ADEA claimants in

6

a voluntary, localized manner so that the grievants

7

thereafter have no need or desire for independent Federal

8

relief."

9

that's not an exhaustion requirement is basically saying

And

The

So, the sense in which the Court was saying that

10

that that scheme is like this one, where the PLRA does not

11

approach attempting to reduce the Federal prisoner claims

12

by kicking cases out of court indiscriminately or by

13

defaults; it aims to reduce it by raising the degree of

14

difficulty for the prisoner in getting to Federal Court in

15

various ways --

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But how does it do that?

I

17

mean, if there's any object that Congress had in mind,

18

surely it was to reduce the number of frivolous prisoner

19

claims that are coming into Federal district courts.

20

it hoped to do this by sending the -- making sure that

21

they went through the prison system first.

22

looked at what the prison system did or not, we hoped that

23

the prison system would get rid of a large -- a large

24

number of these frivolous claims.

25

And

Whether we

Now, can you tell me how that purpose is

JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- by saying, "Do nothing.

4

long as you don't even try to go through the prison

5

grievance system, you can come directly into court."

6

seems to me this --

MR. FEDER:

considerably on the number of frivolous claims?

19

MR. FEDER:

This is going to cut back

Your Honor, I think that -- there

20

are a few points to respond to there -- I think that the

provision does make sense that way.

worth noting that the PLRA was working very well before

procedural default even came into the picture.

-- why the provision wouldn't be meaningless without

12

it is still meaningful.

On the first thing, the prisoner is not affected

Yes it is.

Because the

whole -- one of the reasons you have reasonably short time

14

is that you get the witnesses there, they remember it.

15

If you have to file within 15 days with the

16

prison, the prisoner does that, the guard is there, "Do

17

you remember what happened?"

18

"Yes.

"Who else was there?"

20

"These people were there."

21

You wait 3 months, the prisoner files a

complaint, they ask the guard, "Do you remember?"

This, this, and this."

"Not really.

It was 3 months ago."

MR. FEDER:

I -- Your Honor, I don't -- I don't

think it really makes sense to say that, within this kind

of time periods that we're talking about, that that's

really going to help the inmate's claim, because -- I

mean, we're dealing here within --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, the point is that if

he complies with the time limit, it's going to hurt his

limit.

MR. FEDER:

everything here is within the framework of the section

theory that it's fresh enough -- reasonably fresh if it's

within whatever that period is in the particular State; 2

years, in many States.

20

that the guard is not going to be able to testify 6 months

later is, I think, you know, maybe at the margins.

not likely to affect this.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It's

Well, you were

suggesting that the prisoner had no incentive not to

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1

it seems to me that the reason you have the short

2

procedures are to maintain a fresh record that more

3

accurately reflects the truth, and, since Congress was

4

acting against the backdrop in which they thought there

5

were too many frivolous cases, they thought that might be

6

one way to limit those.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And the more frivolous the

8

case, the more likely it is that it won't be remembered by

9

a guard.

MR. FEDER:

Who's

Well, Your Honor, again, I think

13

that, at a minimum -- even if you grant that there may --

14

the prisoner may see some advantage in that, there is, at

15

a minimum, a substantially smaller incentive than you

16

would -- than you would have in, for example, a habeas

case.

to act on it and ameliorate that situation, and that's the

should state one more thing before leaving that.

10

I mean,

But the other very important point here is that

11

in considering the reasonableness of doing this with or

12

without a procedural default requirement, sure, with

13

procedural -- excuse me, a procedural default rule -- with

that, of course, you're going to make the provision

15

somewhat more effective, but there's a tradeoff.

16

tradeoff is, you're going to make it more effective by

17

kicking prisoners out of court on a nonmerits ground.

18

Congress -- the sponsors of the legislation made it clear

19

they were not meaning to kick out potentially meritorious

20

claims.

21

which is, with this procedural default rule, the prison

22

officials have the incentive to try to get rid of cases on

nonmerits grounds, because if they rule on a -- on a

procedural ground, then the prisoner can't file.

2

But I think -- the important point here is,

3

though, there's a real policy tradeoff.

4

indication anywhere in the language of the Act, or

5

anywhere in the legislative history, that this is a policy

6

tradeoff that Congress actually was willing to make.

7

I guess I didn't touch on the language, but there are

8

numerous textual indications, as we argue in detail in our

9

brief, even aside from getting to the word "exhausted,"

There is no

And

10

that Congress contemplated simple exhaustion, and there's

11

no sign of any contemplation of a procedural default rule.

12

The word "exhausted" itself, again, I think that habeas,

13

for a number of reasons, is a much closer analogy,

14

including the fact that this was passed practically

15

contemporaneous with AEDPA.

16

there were provisions in the same bill that -- one of

17

which was an exhaustion provision in AEDPA, and one of

18

which was the early version of this.

indication that exhaustion was used in different contexts

there.

22

There was -- at one point,

There's no

On the legislative history, if there was an

23

expectation that there would be this sort of procedural

24

default rule and prisoners would forfeit claims -- and, as

25

you can tell with 2- or 3-day filing deadlines some

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

places, and other technical requirements elsewhere --

2

there would be expected to be a number of forfeitures, no

3

indication in the legislative history that Congress

4

thought one of the ways the PLRA would reduce suits was by

5

causing forfeitures.

6

And, in addition, it's important to understand

7

that, although, as we concede, the provision will be --

8

it will not be as effective without a procedural default

9

rule, but it still does have some effect without the

10

procedural default rule, the problem with imposing a

11

procedural default rule is that the consequences of that

12

are very troubling, because what you'd be doing then is

13

essentially incorporating every State, and local jail

nobody wanted, really, to bring it up.

And that's, I thought, maybe why

I would like to think that, Your

Honor, but, actually, as opposing counsel has indicated,

10

Congress eliminated the language -- the pre-existing

11

language that placed some sort of requirement -- it

12

removed the "plain, speedy, and effective" language,

13

removed the "minimum standards" language.

14

was that they wouldn't be reviewed for the adequacy of the

15

standards.

20

He said it has to be "impossible" to comply

MR. FEDER:

I think -- I think that's right.

21

And I think that that's actually an indication that

22

Congress was not expecting it to have this sort of harsh

23

consequence, where you're taking whatever procedural rule

24

from whatever State.

25

Another thing about the PLRA, aside from

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

1

removing the old language, is that one of the goals of the

have exactly that kind of oversight saying, you know,

"Your procedure is adequate.

that's what -- that's what Congress removed.

The consequences also mean that if this

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's only binding --- they're procedural rules,

you have to be on time.

MR. FEDER:

Well, Your Honor, I think that if

6

the State were to say that you -- that, "This is

7

definitively rejected, and we're not going to let him

8

amend it," then, in that case, you would have satisfied

9

10

Otherwise -- well -- and I should just go back to the --

11

to the point I was making about a continuing violation.

For instance, let's say there is a failure-to-protect

The State has -- after that, can say, "You can't go to
Federal Court, because you haven't met our deadline."

18

In this case, here, there was a continuing

19

violation that was alleged, and the -- and the State

20

basically said, "Our rule is, even if it's continuing, you

21

have to file it within 30 days -- or 15 days of when it

first arose."

circumstances where this rule here would mean -- again,

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JENNIFER G. PERKELL

2

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

MS. PERKELL:

It's not so much that the Ninth Circuit's rule

Three quick points, Your Honors.

5

creates an incentive for an inmate to file untimely, it's

6

that it doesn't create the incentive to file timely.

7

Moreover, Respondent is relying on the habeas

8

corpus analogy, but, at the same time, he wants the

9

results under the PLRA to be different from under the

10

habeas corpus statute.

11

And, third, untimely -- the rule of untimely

12

exhaustion adopted by the Ninth Circuit undermines the

13

purposes of the statute, because, first, prisons will

14

usually enforce their deadlines, and grievances will not

15

receive any merits review before they reach Federal Court.

16

And, second, because grievances filed untimely, and

17

particularly months or years untimely, deprive prisons of

18

a genuine opportunity to investigate and respond to

19

prisoner -- or they do deprive prisons of a genuine

20

opportunity to investigate and respond to prisoner

21

grievances, because oftentimes witnesses, evidence, and,

22

in particular, recollections, are no longer available.
