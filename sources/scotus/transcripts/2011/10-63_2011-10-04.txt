ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. GARRE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

10

Two factors distinguish this case from those

11

in which the Court has found cause lacking to excuse a

12

default:

13

the extraordinary events leading up to the default in

14

this case; and, second, the actions of Maples's

15

attorneys, which rise to the level of abandonment, are

16

not attributable to Maples under agency law or other

17

principles that this Court has invoked in determining

18

when attorney conduct may be imputed to a client.

19

First, the State itself had a direct hand in

For either or both of those reasons, the

20

default at issue in this case is not fairly attributable

21

to Cory Maples, and the contrary decision of the

22

Eleventh Circuit should be reversed.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You talk about the

24

State's role.

I assume that you're talking about there

25

is the failure to take action after the return of the
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

notices.
MR. GARRE:

I think that's -- that's right,

3

Mr. Chief Justice.

4

the fact that the State initially set up a system for

5

the representation of indigent capital defendants that

6

relies extremely heavily on the good graces of

7

out-of-State counsel to represent indigent capital

8

defendants in Alabama.

9

I would couple that, though, with

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, put -- putting

10

that -- that to one side, what if only one of the three

11

notices had been returned?

12
13

MR. GARRE:

I think -- if only one from the

out-of-State pro bono counsel?

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

15

MR. GARRE:

Right.

I think that would be a

16

different case.

17

case is you have both out-of-State attorneys, the

18

notices come back marked "Return to Sender -- Left Firm"

19

in an envelope, and the clerk does nothing.

20

extraordinary about that, Mr. Chief Justice, is that the

21

system in this case relies on the out-of-State attorneys

22

to provide --

23

I think what's remarkable about this

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Who says so?

And what's

Who says so?

24

Who says that they rely on -- you have a local attorney,

25

and you have to have a local attorney for the case,

don't you?

And -- and you want us to believe that the

2

local attorney is -- has no responsibility for the case

3

at all?

4

requires?

5

obligation when he has the -- when he gets the notice.

6

He is one of the attorneys for your client.

7

the notice, right?

Is this really what the -- what the law
I -- I think there is a serious ethical

And he got

That one was not returned.

8

MR. GARRE:

That's correct, Justice Scalia.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

He failed to check with --

10

with the New York lawyers who were working with him.

11

Why is it -- why is the State responsible for that?

12

MR. GARRE:

We have three points on the

13

local counsel, Your Honor.

14

the notice is not attributable to Mr. Maples because Mr.

15

Butler had disclaimed any relationship apart from

16

facilitating the admission of his out-of-State

17

attorneys.

18

First, the record shows that

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Disclaimed to who?

To --

19

I mean, how could a clerk be expected to know that the

20

local counsel really isn't taking any part?

21

so was the disclaimer to the clerk?

22

MR. GARRE:

I mean --

I think a -- a couple things on

23

the clerk's perspective.

First, we do think that it was

24

well known in Alabama that, under this unique system,

25

out-of-State attorneys were doing all the work in these
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

cases, and local counsel were simply facilitating their

2

admission.

3

Second, one of the -JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, who says that, Mr.

4

Garre?

I mean, is there anything in the record on that

5

point, on the Alabama system generally?

6

MR. GARRE:

A couple of the things, Your

7

Honor.

First, we do have the amicus briefs, which

8

discuss that anecdotally.

9

Alabama in its brief in opposition to this Court a few

10

years back in the Barbour case specifically touted the

11

role of out-of-State attorneys under its system and, as

12

far as I could tell, didn't mention local counsel once.

13

So, I think it was fair to say that it's known that the

14

out-of-State attorneys here were doing all the work.

15

But even if the clerk --

16

I would say that the State of

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You're begging the

17

question, which is how is the clerk supposed to know

18

this?

19

sends out notices, receives back mail that's not

20

returned.

21

work.

This is a functionary in the clerk's office who

There has to be some local counsel that does

22

MR. GARRE:

Well --

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How is he supposed to

24

know the difference between those that do and those that

25

don't?
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. GARRE:

What -- what -- I think the

2

clerk would be imputed with knowledge, general knowledge

3

of the system.

But beyond that, what the clerk know --

4

knew was this:

He knew that two of the three notices

5

that went out were returned, both to the out-of-State

6

attorneys, which ought to be an extraordinary event in

7

the life of any clerk's office.

8
9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But, you know, even if

local counsel is as you -- as you describe it, and

10

nothing in the record establishes it, even if he is a

11

functionary, surely the function would include when he

12

gets a notice, that he makes sure that the -- the people

13

who do the real work know about the notice.

14

MR. GARRE:

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

16

Of course.

But the point is --

He didn't perform that

function.

17

MR. GARRE:

In this case, the local counsel

18

didn't perform as a mail drop, and that was

19

intentionally so.

20

And I think what's important is the State itself must

21

not have viewed him as a meaningful player.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

counsel appeared and did exactly what was done here,

MR. GARRE:

I think Mr. Butler -- just

facilitate your out-of-State attorneys to represent you,

but that's my role.

after that.

He had, quote, unquote, "no role"

JUSTICE SCALIA:

He can't define his role as

23

a lawyer.

Once he appears before a court and says, I am

25

It's not up to him to say what his responsibilities are.

Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. GARRE:

Well, clearly that's right.

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And if they don't extend

3

even to forwarding notice, even to making sure that the

4

people who were doing the legwork in the case know that

5

-- that the clock is running, my goodness, I can't

6

imagine what his responsibility is.

7

to define it.

8
9

MR. GARRE:

It's not up to him

That's exactly our point,

Justice Scalia, which is that he forswore any

10

responsibility.

The lawyer in the Holland case just had

11

those responsibilities, too.

12

This -- what Mr. Butler here did here was inexcusable.

He abandoned his client.

13

But there's another factor at play here, and

14

that's the confusion that the court itself affirmatively

15

created when it sent an order that, by its term,

16

directed that all counsel of record receive it.

17

that's what the order said; it's on page 225 of the

18

joint appendix.

What we know,

2

though, is when the default occurred, it took the

3

extraordinary step of faxing a letter directly to Mr.

4

Maples in prison, which would have been unethical if it

5

believed he was represented by counsel.

6

or more particularly --

22

Of course, we think the Court

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

In that regard, there is

23

one part of Holland that you don't really address, which

24

is that Holland contrasted a statute of limitations

25

issue with respect to access to a Federal court with a
24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

procedural bar and said that the State's procedural bar

2

had interest of federalism, that we had to be cautious

3

of ignoring a State procedural bar because of

4

federalism.

5

want, how do we justify ignoring federalism in that

6

situation?

7
8

If we were to extend Holland in the way you

MR. GARRE:

That's right.

There are those

distinctions.

9

Our point is that Holland recognizes that

10

attorney conduct that amounts to abandonment is external

11

to the client under agency and other principles.

12

Coleman itself recognizes that external conduct is not

13

attributable to the client and can't be a basis for

14

cause.

15

So, the Federal -- federalism interests are

16

simply not implicated in a case where you find that the

17

attorney's actions are external.

18

look at the principles you looked at in Holland, agency

19

law going back to Justice Story's time, the principles

20

of professional standards of care, you would find that

21

an abandonment -- of course, that must be external to

22

the client.

23

opinion that where someone is not acting as an agent in

24

any meaningful sense, it would be grossly inequitable

8

Mr. Maples never agreed to have anyone else represent

him in a way that could bind him.

The Alabama court

10

specifically found not only that they weren't counsel of

record, but they were not authorized to practice in

12

Alabama.

This is on page 223 of the petition appendix.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

to you to produce the facts that would justify our

problem is that both the district court and the court of

for the Court to send it back and say, no, Coleman v.

appeals addressed that and rejected it erroneously under

21

Coleman.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

established cause; that does not mean abandonment to me.

within the rule of Yee v. Escondido, where -- where the

party makes the claim below -- which they made the claim

here that the attorneys' actions established cause --

4

you can make new arguments, different arguments.

5

And I think, particularly given that

6

Sullivan & Cromwell had been involved early in this case

7

and the possibility of conflicts of interest would make

8

it appropriate for this Court to consider our

abandonment issue, which was raised in the petition for

25

First, Maples is asking this Court to hold that due

of record, John Butler, but in fact something more than

that.

case, Mr. Maples had been abandoned by all of his

lawyers, it was known to the prosecution, and,

therefore, the failure to file the notice should not

6

So they weren't anticipating that he

MR. NEIMAN:

7

They certainly were preparing for an evidentiary

8

hearing, and, in fact, contrary to my friend's

9

statements about what we know about Mr. De Leeuw's

10

involvement in this case, on page 228 of the J.A.,

11

Maples expressly alleged that De Leeuw and others at

12

Sullivan & Cromwell were preparing for the evidentiary

13

hearing.

14

But -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But as far as -- as far

15

the record shows, De Leeuw is not on the record at all.

16

There were three counsel of record.

17

well, let's go back to this -- this -- the first issue.

18

The State by its own conduct showed it didn't regard

19

Butler as any kind of representative, because it didn't

20

even send its Rule 32 response to Butler; isn't that so?

21

MR. NEIMAN:

Two of them --

No, Your Honor, I respectfully

22

disagree with that assessment of how we can read the

23

service of the Rule 32 answer.

25

MR. NEIMAN:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What about --

-- Ms. Ingen-Housz.
What about the notice

7

that he's -- he had lost in the Alabama court and he'd

8

better, if he wants to go to the Federal court, do

9

something about it?

10

That notice went only to Maples,

right?

11

MR. NEIMAN:

That's correct, Your Honor.

12

The -- the State's attorney in that -- in that instance

13

decided to send a letter only to Mr. Maples.

point that if Maples were represented, that that would

that Maples had been abandoned by his lawyers because he

20

didn't notify any of them.

remedies?

7

Your Honor, I agree with my

friend that we don't have statistics on that front.

I

11

going to appeal.

longer want to invoke the process of the courts, and

19

6

I guess the notice could come

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

7

that they didn't get their -- get the mail, get the

8

letter, because it's sent back.

9
10

MR. NEIMAN:

That's correct, Your Honor.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

One other thing while I'm

11

talking with you, and it's a tangential point, perhaps.

12

Could the State of Alabama under your laws waive what

13

you allege to be the procedural default?

14

there was substantial merit to the underlying claims,

15

even though you take the position that they ultimately

16

should be rejected, could you have simply waived the

17

procedural default and allowed the appeal to proceed?

18

MR. NEIMAN:

If you thought

I don't think the law makes

19

that crystal clear, Your Honor.

But I certainly know of

20

no law that suggests that the Attorney General of

21

Alabama necessarily has to assert every single potential

22

defense within his or her arsenal.

Counsel, could we go

assume the two letters went to Sullivan & Cromwell and

to Butler came back "deceased."

MR. NEIMAN:

The -- the cause argument in

that case, Your Honor, would be substantially stronger,

as I've said before, in part because death, of course,

19

is an external factor.

20

So --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So, you accept -- I

21

don't mean to interfere with the question, but -- so,

22

you accept the idea that there is a distinction between

23

malfeasance and abandonment.

24
25

MR. NEIMAN:

Your Honor, I think we would be

prepared to recognize that, in certain cases, an

1

abandonment of a client by an attorney would terminate

2

the agency relationship with -- between the attorney and

3

client.

And --

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Okay.

So, then the

5

only thing -- the only thing we're talking about is

6

whether, on these particular facts, there has been

7

abandonment or not.

Right?

8

MR. NEIMAN:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

10
11

That's correct, Your Honor.
From your

perspective.
MR. NEIMAN:

Yes, Your Honor.

But one thing

12

I do want to stress is that my friend has suggested that

13

an evidentiary hearing or further evidentiary

14

proceedings are necessary on this particular question

15

because we don't know what role the other attorneys at

7

I disagree with that

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, the argument is that

substantial likelihood that he's not particularly

off this letter and you get it back from the principal

attorneys, and you ask yourself:

JUSTICE ALITO:

You can see from these

questions that the arguments that you're making in this

capital case, which is sui generis, are pushing the

Court to consider rules that would have far-reaching

19

effect, such as a rule that places upon a clerk of the

court a constitutional obligation to serve counsel with

21

important documents in the case similar to the

22

constitutional obligation to serve initial process in

whether this -- the -- whether you as the Solicitor

25

General or the Attorney General of Alabama have an

obligation to push this matter in this way.

This is a

2

case where -- as I said, it's a capital case, as we all

3

recognize.

4

through no fault of his own, through a series of very

5

unusual and unfortunate circumstances.

Mr. Maples has lost his right to appeal

that?

on that?

Why push this -- this technical argument?

11

MR. NEIMAN:

There are several responses,

12

Your Honor.

First, at least at the Rule 32 stage, the

13

-- the notice of appeal deadline was a jurisdictional

14

one.

15

for an out-of-time appeal, but there wasn't much the

16

State could have done even if it had consented --

And you're right, the State did oppose the motion

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

MR. NEIMAN:

JUSTICE ALITO:

There's no --

-- on that front.
There's no possibility under

20

Alabama rules for an out-of-time appeal in this

21

circumstance?

22

No extension?

MR. NEIMAN:

The holding of the Alabama

23

courts here, as recognized by the Eleventh Circuit, was

24

that this would not be an appropriate circumstance for

25

an out-of-time appeal.

Now, as to the question about -42

Alderson Reporting Company

1

JUSTICE ALITO:

But is that a discretionary

2

matter or is that a flat rule, once you've passed a

certain time deadline, you're out of -- you're out of

luck; there's no opportunity where there's good cause

5

for an extension?

6

MR. NEIMAN:

There is opportunity where

7

there's good cause for an extension.

But the -- what

8

the court held here, what the Alabama court held here,

9

was that this circumstance in which the person had

oppose the out-of-time appeal, and the State pressed the

procedural bar in Federal court in this case.

Alderson Reporting Company

So, under your

view of the case, Coleman was not necessarily

controlling.

3

MR. NEIMAN:

Your Honor, if I have suggested

4

that abandonment itself is an exception to the AISG

5

doctrine, let me correct my earlier answer.

6

My suggestion is that abandonment can

7

sometimes allow a court to determine that a particular

8

lawyer has become external to a client, that the agency

9

relationship has been terminated.

Of course, merely

10

becoming external to the client doesn't mean that the

11

abandonment itself will constitute cause.

12

abandonment also -- or the lawyer's ending of the

13

relationship would also have to impede the ability of

14

the remaining members of the defense team or the

15

defendant himself to comply with State rules.

The

16

And here, even if there is some argument

17

that Ingen-Housz and Munanka abandoned their client,

18

which I don't think there is on this record in light of

19

the way they left the case with Butler, Mr. De Leeuw,

20

and others at Sullivan & Cromwell, even if there were

21

some argument on that front, Butler -- it's not clear

22

that the actions of Ingen-Housz and Munanka actually

impeded the ability of the remaining members of the team

Maples himself has alleged, that Ingen-Housz and Munanka

15

and the record makes clear that Mr. De Leeuw was

involved in this case in representing Maples even before

the default occurred and even before Ingen-Housz and

appeal had been missed, had calculated how much time Mr.

6

Maples had to file his 2254 petition and, based on his

that the State court proceedings were over, the most

for a number of reasons.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

3

MR. NEIMAN:

Because?

One is that Rule 7 of the rules

clear that the role of local counsel was not simply --

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

Irrespective of what the

rules were, you'd have to show -- he would have to show

8

that, in fact, in the State it is a practice such that

9

the local counsel doesn't do much of anything except

10

facilitate, because this is a state of mind as to

11

whether the State -- and the State knows that.

12

If he shows both of those things and shows

13

that the letter came back and shows this was abandonment

14

or close thereto, then the State ought to know that this

15

individual has no idea about filing a piece of paper and

16

thinks somebody else is doing it.

17

say this is not adequate State ground that would block

Federal habeas.

19

what?

20

And that's enough to

Now, your argument against that is

there's certainly a lot in the briefs that seemed to say

that.

3

5

here is that he had the burden as the petitioner in this

6

habeas proceeding to make the requisite factual

7

allegations that he believed would establish cause.

But one problem Mr. Maples faces

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Neiman, am I correct

that under the Alabama rules when an attorney is

11

not have to go to all of them?

12

MR. NEIMAN:

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

It can only go to one,

15

knew, he was the only one to receive notice of this

thing, right?

Is it correct or

21

does the notice -- most of the notices I see list the

5

MR. NEIMAN:

Well, the -- the cc line in

State interference for any number of reasons.

8

is that -- I suppose it could only be held to establish

assume that the cc line communicated a message that it

there are at least three reasons why that would not be a

reasonable reading of the cc line.

15

And

The first is that the cc line doesn't

communicate that Ingen-Housz and Munanka, who were the

17

people listed on the cc line, will in fact receive the

18

order.

19

Ingen-Housz and Munanka.

that Ingen-Housz and Munanka would receive the -- the

Yes, well -What's the difference

between "I don't care" and abandonment?

14

MR. NEIMAN:

I -- Your Honor, I guess I

15

should just make -- just make a couple points in

16

response to that.

17

the question posed about the cc line, that is all about

18

not abandonment, but whether the clerk -- the clerk's

19

actions can be blamed for -- or the default can be

20

blamed on the clerk.

21

The first is that, as I understood

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

We're not talking about

22

the notice issue; we are talking about the abandonment

23

question.

24
25

MR. NEIMAN:

On the abandonment question, if

it really were -- if it really is true that Butler had
54
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

decided he was going to do nothing in this case and not

2

represent his client and not be an attorney for the

3

client, then there might be a viable argument that

4

Butler was not -- was not -- had abandoned the client in

5

some way, but that is not the -- a reasonable reading of

6

the record in this case.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

8

MR. NEIMAN:

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

If we find --

Butler -If we find that these

10

lawyers did abandon their client, will there be some

11

sanction imposed upon them by the bar?

12

just as when we find that there's been inadequate

13

assistance of counsel in a capital case, does -- does

14

anything happen to the counsel who have been inadequate

15

in a capital case?

16
17

MR. NEIMAN:

I often wonder,

Your Honor, I suppose it would

depend on exactly what the allegations are --

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

19

anything happening to them?

20

another capital case?

21

(Laughter.)

22

MR. NEIMAN:

Have you ever heard of
Other than they're getting

Your Honor, I have not.

23

Certainly the rules would provide that a breach of the

24

rules of professional responsibility would be

25

sanctionable by the State bar, both against the Alabama

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You said a few

3

moments ago that Butler did more than your friend

4

suggested.

5

What more did he do?
MR. NEIMAN:

Well, of course, we discussed

6

in the briefs the very -- the undisputable fact that

7

Butler filed numerous things, and after the default

8

occurred in this case.

9
10

But even --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
default, sure.

11

Well, after the

But what did he do before?

MR. NEIMAN:

Butler's affidavit certainly --

12

that was filed in the State court proceedings certainly

13

doesn't say:

14

people in or move for their admission and nothing else.

I'm -- I was in this only to swear these

15

What Butler says --

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

17
18

What did he do more

than that?
MR. NEIMAN:

Butler said -- says, on page

19

255a of the petition appendix, that he agreed to serve

20

as local counsel.

21

meaning under Alabama law.

22

"Local counsel" has a specified

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, you made a

23

fairly serious suggestion that your friend had not

24

accurately represented what Butler did.

haven't told me one thing he did more than move the

2

MR. NEIMAN:

Well, let me withdraw any

3

suggestion that I am saying that Butler had in fact done

4

something that's -- that's clear on the record.

5

And my time is up.

May I finish?

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

7

MR. NEIMAN:

Sure.

The -- my point was that Butler

8

did not simply agree just to move these people -- move

9

these people's admission.

Butler said he would be local

10

counsel.

And local -- the role of local counsel is

11

defined by Rule 7.

It includes an obligation to attend

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY GREGORY G. GARRE
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

18

MR. GARRE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

19

We agree that this is a sui generis case.

20

The facts are extraordinary, the facts are shocking, and

21

our position is simply that under this Court's

22

precedents and the extraordinary facts here, Mr. Maples

23

has established cause to excuse the default.

24
25

With respect to local counsel, apart from
the fact that the State communicated directly with Mr.
57
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Maples, an extraordinary step after the default, maybe

2

the other telling thing is that in 2006, Alabama itself

3

eliminated the local counsel requirement for pro bono

4

proceedings, recognizing that it could only create

5

problems; it didn't add anything.

6

With respect to abandonment, I understood at

7

times my counsel -- my friend, to acknowledge that

8

abandonment may establish an external event with respect

9

to the client.

If that's so, then I think it's clear

10

that we're at a minimum entitled to a remand.

11

were statements about what was clear from the record.

12

think, at a minimum, the record is not clear on a number

13

of things that this Court would have to get into if it

were going to consider adopting the State's position

15

that Mr. Maples was not abandoned.

I

Official

1

Alabama Rules of Criminal Procedure.

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

What is troubling to me

3

about the abandonment argument is that -- is the fear

4

that if the Court says that abandonment is cause, there

5

will be many, many cases in which the allegation is:

6

attorney wasn't just ineffective and negligent; the

7

attorney was so bad that the attorney in effect

8

abandoned me.

9
10
11

My

And that will substantially change existing
law.

Now, how can that be prevented?
MR. GARRE:

Working through agency

12

principles that go back to Justice Story's time, working

13

through the principles established in this Court's

14

decision in Holland and that will be applied in Holland.

15

The lower court in Holland issued its decision on remand

16

and found that Mr. Collins had abandoned Mr. Holland,

17

using this Court's precedent as a guide.

18

So, I think Holland already recognizes that

19

attorney abandonment can be external.

We're just asking

20

the Court to apply the same principles and recognize

21

that what's external in one context cannot be not

22

external in the other context.

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, do you know how

24

often Holland relief has been granted -- since it's very

25

recent, but how -- how frequently Holland relief has
59
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

been granted by the courts below?

2

MR. GARRE:

I don't know the answer to that

3

question.

I'm not aware of any flood of relief in such

4

cases.

5

think the facts here are about as extreme as you can

6

get.

I expect that this would be very extreme.

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I

Mr. Garre, how do we

8

distinguish between abandonment and simply a botched, a

9

very botched, transfer of responsibility within a law

10

firm?

11

MR. GARRE:

Well, where you have counsels of

12

record leaving without obtaining the approval that

13

they're required or telling the Court, I think that is

14

abandonment pure and simple.

15

look to agency principles, whether there's a breach of

16

loyalty.

17

to get into the facts, although I think it is a very

18

high bar.

19

a high bar.

20

but it's something that the courts will work out

21

applying agency principles, applying the Court's

22

decision in Holland.

23

Beyond that, you would

This is going to be a fact -- you would want

I think the Holland decision makes clear it's
I think this case clearly passes that bar,

Recognizing what Holland said in this case

24

isn't going to create any new rule; it's simply going to

25

extend logically the recognition that attorney
60
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

abandonment is external to the client as it always has

2

been under agency principles.

3

With respect to notice, this Court doesn't

4

have to find a constitutional violation on the State's

5

part.

6

the State's actions are external.

7

inquiry is what Justice Kagan recognized, which is you

8

look to what a person who is actually desirous of

9

providing notice would do.

It's enough for cause that the Court finds that
And I think the key

In this situation, the clerk

10

got two notices back, "Left Firm."

11

would have seen this is an order in a capital case, and

12

it did nothing.

13

desired to provide notice of an inmate with his life on

14

the line would do nothing, reasonably, in that

15

situation.

16

It opened it up; it

I don't think anyone who actually

Mr. Maples is not asking to be released from

17

prison.

18

serious constitutional claims of ineffective assistance

19

of counsel to a Federal habeas court on the merits.

20

He's asking for an opportunity to present

If the claims are as meritless as the State

21

suggests, that clearly will have little burden on it.

22

But simply allowing those claims to be adjudicated on

23

the merits in Federal court will go a long way to

24

preserving the legitimacy of the system of criminal

25

justice in a case in which a man's life is at stake.
