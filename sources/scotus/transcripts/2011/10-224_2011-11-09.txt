ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN J. WELLS

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. WELLS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

Congress has unmistakably ordained that one

12

set of rules govern animal handling and treatment,

13

inspection, and determinations of meat quality for sale

14

at federally inspected slaughterhouses from California

15

to Maine, and those rules kick in at the slaughterhouse

16

gate, and they continue through the sale of the meat by

17

the slaughterhouse.

18

of rules regarding nonambulatory animals, rules which

19

were intended to be and are different than and in

20

addition to the Federal rules regarding the handling of

21

nonambulatory animals.

22

California has enacted its own set

Where Federal law sets requirements for

23

receipt and allows for receipt if the -- if those rules

24

are followed, California law bans receipt of the animals

25

altogether.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What about purchase?

2

about -- what about the contract to purchase?

3

California law addresses that.

4

that that is pre-empted as well?

5

MR. WELLS:

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

7

MR. WELLS:

What

The

Do you -- do you contend

We do, Your Honor.

And --

How so?

Justice Scalia, the reason

8

that -- the reason that we do is because, to the extent

9

that purchase is -- is even relevant with respect to a

10

federally inspected slaughterhouse, I think all the

11

parties agree that it occurs on or after the receipt;

12

so, it's part of the operational process.

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

What if it weren't?

14

it took place at an auction site apart from the

15

slaughterhouse?

16

MR. WELLS:

What if

Well, Justice Kagan, I --

17

because the scope of the FMIA starts at the gate of the

18

slaughterhouse and ends with sale, California, I think,

19

could regulate and not -- not have its regulation be

20

expressly pre-empted if it attempted to prevent purchase

21

before the purchase occurred.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Or contract of purchase.

I

23

mean, if the contract of purchase is made apart from the

24

slaughterhouse itself, they could make it unlawful for

25

the -- the person who raises the animals to sell them
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

when they're nonambulatory and unlawful for the

2

slaughterhouse to contract to buy them, right, so long

3

as the contract is off the premises?

4

MR. WELLS:

So long as the -- so long as the

5

contract -- so long as title didn't pass, Your Honor, or

6

the -- it didn't interfere with what happens on the

7

premises from the gate through sale, then I believe that

8

would not be expressly pre-empted by --

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:
MR. WELLS:

10

Okay.

-- by Federal law.

There could

11

be implied pre-emption issues, however, in that

12

circumstance --

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So, your -- your

14

position is if the contract for purchase is consummated

15

in some way on premises, that's pre-empted?

16

your answer to Justice Kagan and Justice Scalia is that

17

if the purchase contract occurs before the animals

18

arrive at the gate of the slaughterhouse, that that

19

would not be pre-empted?
MR. WELLS:

20

And so,

Not be expressly pre-empted.

21

Again, there may be implied pre-emption issues, but if

22

the law -- I think, Your Honor, if the law is intended

23

to target --

24
25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, your whole

argument is on express pre-emption.

MR. WELLS:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You've given up any

argument on implied.

6

Absolutely

right.

3
4

Yes, Your Honor.

MR. WELLS:

Before -- we've not raised that

argument before this Court.

7

That's correct.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Please tell me why you

8

think the sale of the meat is expressly pre-empted.

9

Solicitor General says it's a closer question on sale of

10

the meat because the slaughterhouse processes -- the law

11

is involved only with the operations and -- of the

12

premises and manner of slaughtering and has nothing to

13

do with sales.

14

pre-empted?

15

The

So, why is the sale of the meat

MR. WELLS:

Your Honor, sale is a -- it is a

16

practical step.

17

678, I think all the parties agree it encompasses all

18

the practical steps of the slaughterhouse.

19

is the last practical step, to which all other practical

20

steps are directed.

21

would be news to the slaughterhouses that sales is not a

22

part of their operations.

23

And the word "operations" as used in

Sale clearly

So, it is an operational step.

It

That's --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So, how about there's a

24

law that says you can't slaughter cats, dogs, or horses,

25

or you can't sell cats, dogs, or horses for slaughter?
6
Alderson Reporting Company

MR. WELLS:

And, Your Honor, it would have

to be --

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

4

MR. WELLS:

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

6

MR. WELLS:

Or for consumption.

I'd have to put -Is that pre-empted?

It -- it would be.

Well, with

7

respect to cats and dogs, the answer would be no,

8

because those are not amenable species that are subject

9

to inspection at a federally inspected slaughterhouse.

10

So, that's outside the scope of the FMIA.

11
12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Is there a Federal

regulation to that effect?

13

MR. WELLS:

No -- yes.

Only amenable

14

species can be slaughtered.

Amenable species are

15

defined at U.S.C. -- 21 U.S.C. section 601 subsection

16

(w).

And cats and dogs are not amenable species.

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

18

MR. WELLS:

So --

And what's that definition?

Well, the definition is -- it's

19

kind of a roundabout definition, Your Honor.

Amenable

20

species is -- mentions -- I mean, frankly, it mentions

21

catfish and -- and other species, and then all of the

22

animals which were amenable species prior to the

23

amendment of the Act in 2005.

24

footnote 11 of our -- our brief, but it clearly includes

25

swine, and it includes -- it includes horses.

We set that forth in

7
Alderson Reporting Company

It

Official

1

includes cattle, obviously.

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

So, the Seventh Circuit

3

and -- and I forget what the other circuit was -- were

4

incorrect in saying that the -- that the State could

5

prohibit the slaughter of horses?

6

MR. WELLS:

Yes, Your Honor.

I believe they

7

were incorrect, although I would say that, even under

8

the rationale that the Fifth and Seventh Circuits used,

9

their rationale would not save this State law.

And the

10

reason that it wouldn't is, even if you were to decide

11

that those -- those cases were decided correctly, the

12

rationale that the court used was we can interpret those

13

States' laws in a way that the -- the laws never have to

14

affect the operations of the slaughterhouse because we

15

can interpret those laws to keep the animals off the

16

slaughterhouse -- off premises.

17

It's easy to identify what's a horse and

18

keep it off the premises.

19

nonambulatory animals.

20

with the symptom of nonambulatory-ness on the premises

21

or on the trucks that are waiting to arrive on the

22

premises.

23

be interpreted in a way not to operate on premises.

24
25

That's not true with

Nonambulatory animals present

So, there is no way that this State law could

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, doesn't it seem

strange to hold that the Federal Meat Inspection Act
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

speaks to an issue like that?

2

anything -- whether or not horses should be slaughtered

3

and sold and their meat should be sold doesn't have

4

anything to do with food safety, does it?

5

doesn't have anything to do with humane treatment,

6

assuming the same methods of slaughter are used?

7

MR. WELLS:

This doesn't have

And it

Well, I would disagree, Your

8

Honor.

It clearly has to do -- this issue clearly has

9

to do with both of those issues.

As the State has

10

admitted on page 6 of its brief, this law was intended

11

to address both -- both humane handling of animals,

12

which is covered directly in section 603(b) of the -- of

13

the Federal --

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

No, I wasn't speaking of the

15

California law.

I was speaking of the law that

16

prohibits the -- the slaughter of horses --

17

MR. WELLS:

Well--

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

That's based just on a

19

judgment, a societal judgment, that this is an animal

20

that should not be slaughtered and sold for food.

21

does that have to do with any of the purposes of the

22

Federal Meat Inspection Act?

23

MR. WELLS:

What

Well, because Congress has made

24

a different -- a different judgment, Justice Alito; and

25

what Congress has said is we have identified -- we,
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Congress, have made a moral judgment that the following

2

species are amenable and may be inspected on

3

slaughterhouse premises.

4

State is making a different moral judgment --

5
6

And to the extent that the

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Congress excluded cats and dogs?

7

MR. WELLS:

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That -- Congress -- correct.
So, Lassie -- Lassie and

Kitty are no good?
MR. WELLS:

10
11

And that presumably is why

Congress made a moral judgment

MR. WELLS:

But Dobbin is all right.

I believe that's right, Your

14

Honor.

15

Congress as to which animals are going to be amenable

16

for slaughter and which ones aren't.

17

It's a moral -- it is a moral judgment by

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Young, you suggested

that even if the Seventh Circuit was correct, there

would still be a difference because of ease of

23

swine?

24

swine usually become nonambulatory in transit or at the

25

slaughterhouse, or could you identify such swine

6

the gates are thrown open, and the animals are

They may become nonambulatory on the

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

State could make it unlawful for a rancher or -- what

13

are the people that ship the animals to you called?

14

Could it --

15

MR. WELLS:

Could be a rancher or a farmer.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

A rancher or farmer could

17

make it unlawful for them to ship a nonambulatory swine,

18

could they not?

19

MR. WELLS:

Your Honor, Congress actually

20

has enacted regulations that don't -- they don't apply

21

to slaughterhouses because, again, the scope with

22

respect to slaughterhouses started at the slaughterhouse

23

gate.

24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, but as far as this

statute is concerned, it would not preclude a State law
11
Alderson Reporting Company

1

that forbids a -- a rancher to -- to ship a

2

nonambulatory swine, right?

3

MR. WELLS:

That's correct.

There are

Federal -- I should point out, there are Federal

5

regulations that govern the transportation of dead,

6

dying, and diseased animals.

7

slaughterhouses.

8

Your Honor is contemplating.

9

They don't apply to

They may apply in the situation that

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I would have thought

10

that your argument on sales would apply at the front end

13

on at the slaughterhouse.

14

apply at the front end?

You say sales can't be regulated because it's

MR. WELLS:

15

Wouldn't that concern also

Well, Your Honor, our argument

16

about sale is slightly different, and it's a little

17

different than the argument that's being made by the

18

Government.

19

are requirements specifically regulating sale.

20

found in 21 U.S.C. section 610(c).

21

essentially, meat may not be sold if it is adulterated,

or, to put it another way, you may sell the meat if it's

unadulterated.

That's

That says,

So, that's a requirement.

It's within

And it is different than and in addition to

2

the State regulation because what the State -- the State

3

adds another condition.

4

5

the other way, you may sell the meat as long as it's not

6

from a nonambulatory animal.

7

They say you may not sell the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, that -- isn't

8

that logically not -- doesn't that logically not follow?

9

You may not sell meat if it's been adulterated doesn't

10

mean that you can sell meat so long as it's not been

11

adulterated; right?

MR. WELLS:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I think -One is a limitation,

MR. WELLS:

for the sale of meat.

another requirement for the sale of meat.

California has established

Under Federal law, one requirement for the

sale of meat is that it not be adulterated, that it pass

through inspection, that it be stamped "USDA approved,"

23

24

State, though, has set forth a different condition, and

that is you may not sell that meat unless it comes from

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, isn't it the case that

3

most nonambulatory animals become nonambulatory because

4

of the method of transportation that's used?

5

dispute the statistics in the brief of the non-State

6

Respondent that -- Respondents that, nationwide,

7

approximately 220,000 swine die during transport,

8

another 440,000 become nonambulatory during the

9

transportation process?
MR. WELLS:

10

Do you

I don't -- Your Honor, the short

11

answer is I don't know where those statistics come from,

12

and to my knowledge they are not accurate.

13

have additional statistics to --

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

But I don't

Do you dispute the fact that

15

the reason -- that ranchers generally do not ship

16

animals that are nonambulatory at the time when the trip

17

begins, but that most of these nonambulatory animals

18

become nonambulatory during the transportation process?

19

MR. WELLS:

I think that is a fair

20

assumption, Your Honor, with respect to pigs that

21

present being nonambulatory when -- when the doors to

22

the -- to the truck are opened.

23

correct.

24

nonambulatory animals if you know beforehand that they

25

are nonambulatory.

I think that that's

JUSTICE ALITO:

And you think it's difficult

2

to identify which animals are nonambulatory?

3

difference between horses -- between prohibiting the

4

slaughter of horses, because you can tell whether it's a

5

horse or a pig, but you can't tell whether a pig can

6

walk?

7

MR. WELLS:

No.

That's the

It isn't the only

8

difference, Your Honor.

Really, it -- the -- what I'm

9

really saying is the -- the condition of being

10

nonambulatory presents on the slaughterhouse premises.

11

And so, there is no way for a law to -- no way for us to

12

say the California law can be interpreted in a way that

13

will not tell a Federal slaughterhouse what to do and --

14

and how to do it with respect to nonambulatory animals.

15

That's not true in the horse case.

16

you can say keep the horses out.

horses.

If I understand your question,

4

Your Honor, if the -- if, let's say just for the

5

shorthand, if title passes on the premises, if that's

6

how it's understood in the industry and that's what it

7

is, that would be pre-empted.

8

effect --

9

But if the law took

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What a -- what a

10

fascinating area of immunity.

11

auction houses and everyone else is don't pass title

12

until you get to the slaughterhouse.

13

MR. WELLS:

Now what we're saying to

Well, Your Honor, it's just -- I

14

mean, I think the -- the real question is what has the

15

Federal Government said about nonambulatory animals in

16

general, and are those amenable species and may they

17

be -- may they be slaughtered and turned into food?

18

the Federal regulations deal directly with that

19

situation.

20

the animal is on the Federal premises, there are a whole

21

series of Federal regulations that tell the

22

slaughterhouse worker exactly what the worker is

23

supposed to do with that animal.

24
25

And

So, whether title passes before or after, if

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Does that mean that a State

could actually pass a law and create a facility, let's
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

say, that says -- the law says the trucks have to stop

2

at the State facility before it gets to the

3

slaughterhouse, and at the State facility, we'll check

4

to see whether there are nonambulatory animals and make

5

sure that those animals don't go on to the

6

slaughterhouse?

7

do that?

8
9

Would a State be within its rights to

MR. WELLS:

Your Honor, the language of

section 603(a) says that the inspection is to occur

10

before they enter the slaughterhouse.

11

been interpreted by the Secretary to essentially mean

12

immediately before; so -- so, trucks in line.

13

Now, that has

So, I think, under -- on Your Honor's

14

hypothetical, if the State had set up their own

15

inspection program right immediately outside of a -- of

16

a federally inspected slaughterhouse, that currently

17

would be within the scope of the FMIA, because that's

18

how the Secretary has defined it.

19

it goes, though, the -- the less likely it is to be

20

expressly pre-empted.

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

The further upstream

Well, if they do it at the

22

weigh station that a truck has to stop at when it enters

23

the State, that would be okay?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN J. HORWICH

7

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

8

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. HORWICH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I haven't heard any quarrel this morning

12

with the proposition that if an animal goes down, say,

13

as it's entering the abattoir to be slaughtered, that

14

the State cannot at that point tell the slaughterhouse

15

how it is to handle that animal.

16

But that is not any different, of course,

17

than the situation where a pig goes down as it's coming

18

off the truck, or it presents as nonambulatory when the

19

gates of the truck are opened, because it's still an

20

operational consideration; the same humane handling

21

requirements still apply; it's still a State

22

requirement; and it's not -- it's still different from

23

the Federal requirements.

24
25

So, the Court's questions this morning, I
think, have gone to kind of the situations at the
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

margins, at the extreme.

2

address some of those questions.

3

So, let me try to -- try to

The -- the question about whether -- the

4

question about the purchase of the nonambulatory animal

5

and the regulation, the regulation there, the first

6

thing is, as a practical matter, I think you have to

7

think about it in a concrete situation, which is that

8

there is a nonambulatory animal that's on the

9

slaughterhouse premises.

That's the hypothetical that

10

we're in.

11

12

State law says, well, you can't buy it, you can't hold

13

it, you can't receive it, you can't turn it into meat,

14

and you have to immediately euthanize it.

15

And the question is, what is the

point, the animal has to be transported.

law regulate for humane purposes the transportation of

18

animals to slaughterhouses?

19

MR. HORWICH:

Does Federal

There are Federal laws

20

regarding transportation.

The Federal Meat Inspection

21

Act has not been interpreted by the Secretary to apply

22

specifically to trucks that are in transit, although I

23

should say that the Secretary has, for example,

24

interpreted the FMIA -- and this is in part 309.1(b) --

25

to apply, at least to the extent of humane handling, to
19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

pens at stockyards that are committed exclusively to a

2

slaughterhouse.

3

And I think if there were a situation such

4

as I think, Justice Kagan, your hypothetical envisioned,

5

where a State determined that it wanted to essentially

6

assert an inspection jurisdiction over animals that were

7

in transit to a slaughterhouse -- so, essentially

8

between the pen and the slaughterhouse -- the Secretary

9

might well recognize that -- that his authority needs to

10

extend -- needs to extend to those, because the purpose

11

of the Act, after all, is to set a Federal inspection

12

standard for animals to determine if they're suitable to

13

be turned into meat.

14

And in your --

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, if the Federal -- if

15

Congress has not chosen to regulate the transportation

16

of animals to prevent inhumane treatment in transit, why

17

should a State law that aims at that objective be

18

pre-empted?

19

MR. HORWICH:

Well, if you -- if you

20

disagree with -- if you disagree with me about the scope

21

of the FMIA in that regard, the State law with respect

22

to the handling of the animals while they're in transit

23

wouldn't be pre-empted.

24

that I understand Petitioners to be seeking is not one

25

that goes to State regulation of trucks but, rather, to

But, of course, the injunction

20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

State regulation of animals that are on the

2

slaughterhouse premises.

3

unmistakably clear that the scope of the FMIA is at

4

least as large as the official slaughter establishment's

5

premises.

6

And the Secretary has made

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, if the State could

7

inspect the trucks at a weigh station before they get to

8

the slaughterhouse, why can't they do the same thing

9

when they get to the slaughterhouse, where it's more

10
11

practical to do that?
MR. HORWICH:

Well, accepting the premise of

12

your hypothetical that the State could do the inspection

13

on the truck --

14
15
16

JUSTICE ALITO:

Do you dispute -- you

dispute that?
MR. HORWICH:

I dispute that, but I'll

17

accept that premise.

18

question here is different because the Secretary has

19

drawn a line that says the scope of the FMIA -- and

20

that's -- the question is the scope of Federal law here.

21

That's in section 678.

22

clear that the scope of the FMIA extends to -- to all

23

animals that are on the premises of the establishment.

24

That's -- you can look at appendix --

25

Even if I accept that premise, the

The Secretary has made very

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So, is there anything

21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

saved to the State?

2

Once you get to the entrance to the slaughterhouse, is

3

there any room for any State regulation?

4

I mean, there is a savings clause.

MR. HORWICH:

Absolutely, Justice Ginsburg.

5

I mean, State laws of general applicability would, to

6

the extent they don't in some particular application

7

intrude into the scope of the FMIA, they would apply.

8

And I also want to be very clear, so that

9

there's no mistaking the Government's position:

State

10

prosecutions for animal cruelty are not pre-empted to

11

the extent they are prosecuting conduct that is unlawful

12

under Federal law, because that is -- that is an example

13

of a State that is not applying a different or an

14

additional standard of conduct but simply adding --

15

applying its own sanction for conduct that Federal law

16

would similarly sanction.

17

for State -- the application of State law on the

18

premises of the slaughterhouse.

19

So, there's absolutely room

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In that respect, do State

20

inspectors routinely go on the premises of

21

slaughterhouse to ensure that their coextensive laws are

22

properly enforced?

23

of judgment, that a Federal inspector says, no, this is

24

okay under Federal law, and the State official says, no,

25

this is not okay under the State law, even though they

And if that's so, are there problems

2

MR. HORWICH:

I'm -- I am not aware that in

3

general State inspectors or other State officials would

4

go to a federally inspected premises as a general

5

matter.

6

they were, and then your question -- excuse me --

7

presents the question about these sort of differences in

8

judgment that might be made.

9

generally provide that the disposition made by

But let's assume for the sake of argument that

The Federal regulations

11

conclusive judgment of the Secretary as to the fitness

12

of the animal for turning into meat.

13

situation, the State official would not be able to reach

14

a different judgment on that question.

15

I think that would resolve any situation where State

16

officials were there.

17

And so, in that

And so, I -- so,

Of course, the situation where State

18

officials do inspections is the one that the Act itself

19

envisions and that California has not taken the

20

opportunity to implement, which is for intrastate-only

21

plants, States can enact their own inspection

22

regulations and have their own inspectors there as long

23

as they're following Federal standards at a minimum.

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

What am I supposed to do --

I have a quick procedural question, which I think is
23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

similar to Justice Ginsburg's.

Suppose this is three

2

sections, the State law, and some of them have three

3

parts.

5

don't have much to do with operations.

6

they do.

7

thought you were right about all the rest of it.

8

am I supposed to do?

Suppose I thought, well, the word "buy" -- I

Maybe sometimes

Suppose I ended up thinking that, but I

9

MR. HORWICH:

Well, I would like to have an

10

opportunity to take issue with your premise.

11

answer your question --

12
13

What

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, no, no.

But the

I'm just doing

that hypothetically.

14

MR. HORWICH:

Yes.

Yes.

The answer to your

15

question is this case comes here on preliminary

16

injunction; so, I think the Court could appropriately

17

articulate its answer and its understanding of the

18

different provisions, and that probably would then lead

19

to the lower courts working out the particulars of the

20

injunction.

21

But let me actually make a point in that

22

regard about what the injunction might or might not look

23

like with respect to the buying provision, which is that

24

I don't understand the State to have some free-floating

25

interest in when title does or doesn't pass.
24
Alderson Reporting Company

The State

Official

1

is interested in regulating what animals can be

2

purchased because of a background principle of State law

3

that I assume exists, that slaughterhouses can't

4

slaughter things they don't own.

5

And if you put those two pieces together,

6

the ban on buying is nothing -- is nothing but doing in

7

two steps what the State clearly can't do in one step,

8

which is tell slaughterhouses how they are to deal with

9

an animal that is on their premises.

At least, they

10

can't -- States can't tell slaughterhouses how to do

11

that when there is a Federal regulation on the subject.

that if the Court were to find -- to have some concern
25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

with some specific aspect of the injunction -- and I

2

guess I would let Petitioner's counsel speak to this --

3

there would be some concern that vacating the injunction

5

Petitioner in a spot where it wouldn't have protection

6

from the vast majority of provisions --

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

8

there are at least 11 different provisions in this, and

9

I have exactly Justice Scalia's question.

MR. HORWICH:

The right way to get out of

21

the work would be to understand that -- that California

22

has made every effort here to implement a provision

23

that -- to implement one underlying requirement, which

24

is that it wants to tell slaughterhouses:

25

these animals into food; immediately euthanize them

about that.

23

within the scope because California is not regulating

animals that are going to be turned into meat.

And the

legislative history of the Act, show that the scope of

the Act is concerned with animals that are going to

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, is that true, Ms.

Smith?

6

these animals could become meat, that under the Federal

program, you take a nonambulatory animal and you say,

It has to do with humane treatment of the

24

that California is regulating, the nonambulatory animals

And the animals

1

slaughtered, will not be turned into meat.

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Wait.

Even the --

I don't -- you mean

3

the Federal requirements of humane treatment do not

4

apply once the slaughterhouse decides that this animal

5

will not be slaughtered for meat; then the

6

slaughterhouse can do whatever it wants with the poor

7

animal?

8
9

That can't be right.
MS. SMITH:

Well, the language of the

regulations -- of the Federal regulations dealing with

10

U.S. condemned animals, for instance, say that U.S.

11

condemned animals shall be killed and shall not be

12

slaughtered and dressed in the same facility with

13

animals that will be turned into meat.

will be slaughtered for meat and that will be edible and

ones that are -- are condemned and will be killed.

And, therefore, it seems to

me the pre-emption clause applies to the humane

11

MS. SMITH:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And you say with your -- with respect

But here, as I understand the Petitioner's

2

and the Government's position, it is that nonambulatory

3

animals can be turned into meat for consumption.

4

you don't know whether it fits under the definition of

5

the State law until you've violated it.

6

MS. SMITH:

No, because when an animal

becomes nonambulatory, it is readily apparent.

That's a

And in -- at

10

nonambulatory, the requirement would be to immediately

euthanize the animal because it's not part of the meat

12

supply system.

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But that's exactly where the

14

California system diverges from the Federal system

15

because under the Federal system you separate the animal

16

out, and then you take a look at it, and then you decide

17

whether that animal can continue to go through the

18

process and eventually become meat, or whether you

19

euthanize it.

20

action that the Federal system say may be necessary but

21

may not be.

22

So, the California system commands an

MS. SMITH:

It commands an action, but it's

different from the Federal requirements governing the

And, therefore, your law seems an additional

34
Alderson Reporting Company

Now, that

Official

1

have been making, and I would like to know your obvious,

2

simple answer.

3

MS. SMITH:

Certainly, Your Honor.

The

4

euthanization is an operation of the slaughterhouse.

5

But it's -- but this -- California's provision is not

6

within the scope.

7

pre-empted, it has to be within the scope and with

8

respect to operations.

9

And pursuant to 678, to be expressly

So, with respect to that provision, the

10

euthanization provision, we concede that it is -- it is

11

part of the operations.

12

because we're dealing with an animal that California has

13

deemed as not part -- as -- excuse me --

14

But it is not within the scope

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I understood that the

15

Federal regulation -- you can correct me if I'm

16

misunderstanding -- is that if there is a suspect animal

17

of any kind, that it requires a slaughterhouse to wait

18

until the Federal inspector comes and finds out whether

19

it's just suspect or it's something that can't be sold.

20

And the reason why the inspection occurs, as

21

I understand it, is that there are some diseases that

22

are so contagious that if the inspector decides that

23

that animal is carrying that disease, that the whole lot

24

will be quarantined or otherwise destroyed.

25

fighting with -- that that's what the purpose of
35
Alderson Reporting Company

So, are you

Official

1

pre-inspection under the Federal system is for?

2

MS. SMITH:

The distinction I would make,

3

Your Honor, is that the purpose of the ante-mortem

4

inspection is to determine if the -- if the animal's

5

meat will be wholesome and unadulterated.

6

that the pre-inspection or the inspection also finds

7

diseases that can be passed on to other animals or -- or

8

to the rest of the herd, that's -- that's certainly a

9

benefit, but it's not part of the purpose of the Federal

10

Meat Inspection Act.

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm having a hard time

12

drawing that distinction.

13

to the pre-mortem inspection -- and I can't see how you

14

can argue otherwise -- that there may be some diseases

15

that are so contagious that the entire lot, ambulatory

16

or nonambulatory swine, are affected, then I don't see

17

how you can argue that you aren't trenching on the scope

18

of the statute.

19

ensure that meat is unadulterated and if there is the

20

risk of contagion, that has to be within the scope.

21

If there is a valid purpose

If the scope of the statute is to

MS. SMITH:

Two points.

One, the diseases

22

that were referenced by the amicus dealing with this are

23

diseases that will be passed to the animals, not to

humans.

25

And the second point is that the -- the

8

it's not going into the meat supply system.

So, I suppose what you're

saying, Ms. Smith, is that California or any State is

entitled to take certain categories of animals outside

19

of the whole process, to exclude certain categories of

20

animals from the whole process and so to exclude them,

21

if you will, from of the scope of this chapter.

22

much as the Seventh Circuit said a State can simply

23

exclude horses from the scope of this statute, you're

24

saying a State can exclude nonambulatory swine from the

25

scope of this statute.

But then you have to, you know, ask yourself

2

the question:

6

that the Federal statute is supposed to be doing.

MS. SMITH:

Why couldn't the State then
And then

Your Honor, if your question is,

8

would that be pre-empted if California excluded pursuant

9

to other diseases, it would not be expressly pre-empted.

10

So, California can make decisions on categories of

11

animals, here nonambulatory swine, and the -- it would

12

not be expressly pre-empted.

13

about conflict pre-emption, but in this particular case,

14

conflict pre-emption was litigated in the Ninth Circuit,

pre-emption.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's express pre-emption.

20

Federal regulations say that these diseases disqualify

the animal from being slaughtered and sold as meat, and

You keep saying "not within

me -- what you're saying then with respect to animals

1

difference is that the State law says you can't sell

2

that as meat while the Federal law says you can.

In other words, you're saying, well, just because the

can't say you can't.

8

isn't the exact flip side of saying you can sell it is

rule from the States that says you can't.

MS. SMITH:

So, if we don't

If one looks at the authority

15

given to the Secretary as well in 621, the authority is

16

specified as dealing with -- or making sure that no

adulterated meat or any carcass, part of carcass, meat

19

in 621 on the Secretary's authority is on making sure

it's not simply the -- the purpose of the Act at 602 but

also the scope of the authority given to the Secretary.

assuming that in effecting its obligations that only

scope.

The Government has basically said:

We've got to

2

figure out if it is, and this is how we're going to do

3

it:

4

the swine through its sale, and we're going to have

5

inspections all through the process, whether or not the

meat will ultimately be sold or not; our scope is what

happens in that slaughterhouse.

MS. SMITH:

That --

Correct.

But the -- the focus

9

of the Secretary's authority, as well as the specified

10

purpose of the Act, is focused on not all animals, but

11

animals that will eventually become meat and making a

12

determination, by inspections or examinations, whether

13

or not -- whether or not those swine or those meat will

14

be wholesome and not adulterated.

JUSTICE BREYER:

16

argument, and now I see it.

17

where you're going.

I -- I didn't see your
Okay.

So, I understand

18

But then if I look at section 610 of the

19

Act, it has a whole bunch of prohibitions, including

20

prohibitions and references to how you slaughter

21

animals, and including how you slaughter animals

22

humanely.

23

which talks about euthanizing an animal that you look

24

around and it's lying down -- how is that not within the

25

scope of the Act?

So, there, how do you say that this provision

I'm not saying that they have that
44

1

particular thing, but the subject matter, slaughtering

2

animals, indeed humanely, is something the Act

3

absolutely deals with.

4

MS. SMITH:

it's certainly part of the operations.

6

is --

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

Euthanization

No, I didn't say that.

I

8

said yes, it's part of the operations, but also it's the

subject matter with which the Act deals.

The Act deals

10

with the humane slaughter of animals and other forms of

11

slaughter of animals.

12

my question.

13

So, how -- how is -- so, I repeat

MS. SMITH:

It deals with animals in

14

connection with slaughter and that will be slaughtered.

15

And so, to the extent that that -- that slaughter is

16

seen as an animal that is going towards the meat supply

17

system, as opposed to one that's condemned and being

18

killed and not -- not --

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

I see.

That's what

you said before -JUSTICE SCALIA:

23

in the statute has two provisions.

Requirements

Now, the second pre-emption provision reads:

"marking, labeling, packaging, or ingredient

made under this chapter."

9

between those two being, under number two it has to be

under number one, it just has to be different from

difference between requirements within the scope and, in

I think that's what Congress meant by the

requirements.

does the ban on buying and selling have, other than to

animal cruelty.

11

One, general public health,

buying, selling, or the sale of meat -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

12

to be, the answer, that, no, it doesn't have anything

13

else to do because the animal cruelty that you're

14

concerned about takes place on the premises as a result

15

of the operations.

16

selling of an animal that wasn't treated the way you

think it should be treated, to give effect to your views

on how it should or should not be treated, which seems

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN J. WELLS

25

MR. WELLS:

Thank you.
52

Alderson Reporting Company

I just have a couple

Official

1

of quick points to make.

2

interpreted the -- section 602 and section 603 and

3

section 604 to require that all animals be handled --

4

all animals on the premises be handled humanely and that

5

all animals be subject to the regulations under the

6

chapter.

7

also set forth in the Secretary's directives.

8

directive 6100 at appendix at 47.

9

One is that the Secretary has

That's set forth in 9 C.F.R. 302.3, and it's
It's

So, the Secretary does not make a

10

distinction in implementing section 602 through 604

11

between animals that the State may choose to try to

12

categorically remove.

13

that is critical because a State -- a slaughterhouse

14

worker who is on the premises needs to have one set of

15

rules that -- that the worker follows so that the worker

16

knows that if he follows the advice of a Federal

17

inspector and, for example, puts a nonambulatory

18

animal -- separates the animal, puts it in a covered

19

pen, and lets it go through the ante-mortem inspection

20

that it's required to have under Federal law, that the

21

slaughterhouse worker won't go to jail.

22

It applies to all animals, and

And that's why it's critical that -- to

23

Congress -- that was critical to Congress that we had

24

this uniformity, and I think it's critical that this

25

Court find pre-emption in this case because otherwise
53
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Federal law will appear and disappear, apparently, based

2

on when the State believes that it's removing animals

3

from -- in connection with slaughter, whenever that

4

would occur.

5

Just one other point, and that is it is also

6

crystal clear that the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act

7

of 1978 incorporated the standards of humane treatment

8

that were included in the Humane Methods of Slaughter

9

Act of 1958, and it isn't just the preamble to that

10

public law that indicates that.

11

Those requirements are found now in 21

12

U.S.C. section 603(b), and they are backed up by

13

prohibitions which are backed up by criminal penalties

14

in section -- in 21 U.S.C. section 610 -- yes, 610(b).
