ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A. LONG

8

AS THE COURT-APPOINTED AMICUS CURIAE

9
10

MR. LONG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

The Anti-Injunction Act imposes a "pay

12

first, litigate later" rule that is central to Federal

13

tax assessment and collection.

14

essentially every tax penalty in the Internal Revenue

15

Code.

16

special exception for the penalty imposed by section

17

5000A.

18

conclude that the Anti-Injunction Act applies here.

19

The Act applies to

There is no reason to think that Congress made a

On the contrary, there are three reasons to

First, Congress directed that the section

20

5000A penalty shall be assessed and collected in the

21

same manner as taxes.

22

penalties are included in taxes for assessment purposes.

23

And, third, the section 5000A penalty bears the key

24

indicia of a tax.

25

Second, Congress provided that

Congress directed that the section 5000A

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

penalty shall be assessed and collected in the same

2

manner as taxes.

3

Anti-Injunction Act, which provides that "no suit for

4

the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection

5

of any tax may be maintained in any court by any

6

person."

7

That directive triggers the

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, that depends, as --

8

as the Government points out, on whether that directive

9

is a directive to the Secretary of the Treasury as to

10

how he goes about getting this penalty, or rather a

11

directive to him and to the courts.

12

directives there seem to me to be addressed to the

13

Secretary.

14

courts?

15

about doing it in the same manner, but the courts simply

16

accept that -- that manner of proceeding but nonetheless

17

adjudicate the cases.

18

MR. LONG:

All of the other

Why should this one be directed to the

When you say "in the same manner," he goes

Well, I think I have a three-part

19

answer to that, Justice Scalia.

20

not say that the Secretary shall assess and collect

21

taxes in the same manner; it just says that it shall be

22

assessed in the same manner as a tax, without addressing

23

any party particularly.

24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

First, the text does

Well, he's assessing and

collecting it in the same manner as a tax.

MR. LONG:

Well, the assessment -- the other

2

two parts of the answer are, as a practical matter, I

3

don't think there's any dispute in this case that if the

4

Anti-Injunction Act does not apply, this penalty, the

5

section 5000A penalty, will as a practical matter be

6

assessed and collected in a very different manner from

7

other taxes and other tax penalties.

8
9

There are three main differences.

First,

when the Anti-Injunction Act applies, you have to pay

10

the tax or the penalty first and then litigate later to

11

get it back with interest.

12

administrative remedies.

13

you can't immediately go to court.

14

the Secretary and give the Secretary at least 6 months

15

to see if the matter can be resolved administratively.

16

And, third, even in the very carefully defined

17

situations in which Congress has permitted a challenge

18

to a tax or a penalty before it's paid, the Secretary

19

has to make the first move.

20

allowed to rush into court before the tax -- before the

21

Secretary sends a notice of deficiency to start the

22

process.

23

Second, you have to exhaust

of the limitations that apply in terms of you have to

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The taxpayer

Why will the

7

administrative remedies rule not be applicable,

8

exhaustion rule not be applicable?

9

MR. LONG:

Well, because if the

10

Anti-Injunction Act doesn't apply, there's no

11

prohibition on courts restraining the assessment or

12

collection of this penalty, and you can simply --

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but courts apply the

14

exhaustion rule.

15

I'm just not following it.

16

well, you haven't exhausted your remedies; no

17

injunction?

18

I mean, I know you've studied this.

MR. LONG:

Why couldn't the court say,

Well, in -- you could do that, I

19

think, as a matter of -- of common law or a judicially

20

imposed doctrine, but in the code itself, which is

21

all -- I mean, the Anti-Injunction Act is an absolutely

22

central statute to litigation --

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

24

MR. LONG:

25

Yes.

Yes.

-- about taxes.

And the code

says -- first it says you must pay the tax first and
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

then litigate.

2

addition, it says you must -- I mean, it's not common

3

law; it's in the code -- you must apply for a refund,

4

you must wait at least 6 months.

5

of these provisions are extremely specific, with very

6

specific time limits.

7

So, that's the baseline.

And then, in

I mean, that's -- many

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But they would apply

8

even if the rule is not jurisdictional.

9

difference would be that the court could enforce it or

10

not enforce it in particular cases, which brings me to

11

the Davis case, which I think is your biggest hurdle.

12

It's a case quite similar to this in which the

13

constitutionality of the Social Security Act was at

14

issue, and the government waived its right to insist

15

upon the application of this Act.

16

Of course, if it's jurisdictional, you can't

17

waive it.

18

case?

19

The only

So, are you asking us to overrule the Davis

MR. LONG:

Well, Helvering v. Davis was

20

decided during a period when this Court interpreted the

21

Anti-Injunction Act as simply codifying the

22

pre-statutory equitable principles that usually, but not

23

always, prohibited a court from enjoining the assessment

24

or collection of taxes.

25

is what was the basis for the Helvering v. Davis

So, that understanding, which

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

decision, was rejected by the Court in Williams Packing

2

and a series of subsequent cases -- Bob Jones.

3

I would say, effectively, the Davis case has been

4

overruled by subsequent decisions of this Court.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And so,

Mr. Long, why don't we

6

simply follow the statutory language?

I know that

7

you've argued that the Davis case has been overtaken by

8

later cases, but the language of the Anti-Injunction Act

9

is "no suit shall be maintained."

It's remarkably

10

similar to the language in -- that was at issue in Reed

11

Elsevier:

12

be instituted."

13

maintained," contrasts with the Tax Injunction Act.

14

says the district court shall not enjoin.

15

Injunction Act is the same pattern as 2283, which says

16

"courts of the United States may not stay a proceeding

17

in State court."

18

and the no injunction against proceedings at State

19

court, are directed to "court."

20

Act, like the statute at issue in Reed Elsevier, says

21

"no suit shall be maintained."

22

that that is suitor-directed in contrast to

23

court-directed.

2

the language is different; but we submit that the

3

Anti-Injunction Act itself, by saying that "no suit

4

shall be maintained," is addressed to courts as well as

5

litigants.

6

beginning to end without the active cooperation of the

7

court.

I mean, after all, a case cannot go from

8
9

You're quite right,

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But how is that different

from "no civil action for infringement shall be

10

instituted" -- "maintained" and "instituted"?

11

turn on that?

12

MR. LONG:

Anything

Well, it's -- I mean -- perhaps a

13

party could initiate an action without the active

14

cooperation of the court, but to maintain it from

15

beginning to end, again, requires the court's

16

cooperation.

17

And even if -- I mean, if the Court were

18

inclined to say as an initial matter, if this statute

19

were coming before us for the first time today, given

20

all of your recent decisions on jurisdiction, that you

21

might be inclined to say this is not a jurisdictional

22

statute, a lot of water has gone over the dam here.

23

Court has said multiple times that this is a

24

jurisdictional statute.

25

those decisions.

Congress has not disturbed

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

JUSTICE ALITO:

Counsel --

Well, the Court said that

3

many times, but is there any case in which the result

4

would have been different if the Anti-Injunction Act

5

were not viewed as jurisdictional but instead were

6

viewed as a mandatory claims-processing --

7

MR. LONG:

There's --

8

JUSTICE ALITO:

9

MR. LONG:

-- rule?

There's certainly a number of

10

cases where the Court dismissed saying it is

11

jurisdictional.

12

As I read the cases, I don't think any of

13

them would necessarily have come out differently,

14

because I don't think we had a case where the argument

15

was, well, you know, the government has waived this, so,

16

you know, even -- if it's not jurisdictional, it --

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, the clearest -- the

18

clearest way of distinguishing between the

19

jurisdictional provision and a mandatory

20

claims-processing rule is whether it can be waived and

21

whether the court feels that it has an obligation to

22

raise the issue sua sponte.

23

Now, if there are a lot of cases that call

24

it jurisdictional, but none of them would have come out

25

differently if the Anti-Injunction Act were simply a
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

mandatory claims-processing rule -- you have that on one

2

side.

3

And on the other side, you have Davis, where

4

the Court accepted a waiver by the Solicitor General;

5

the Sunshine Anthracite coal case, where there also was

6

a waiver; and there's the Williams Packing case, which

7

is somewhat hard to understand as viewing the

8

Anti-Injunction Act as a jurisdictional provision.

9

The Court said that there could be a suit if

10

there's no way the government could win and the

11

plaintiff would suffer irreparable harm.

12

that sound like an equitable exception to the

13

Anti-Injunction Act?

14

MR. LONG:

Now, doesn't

No, I think the -- I think the

15

best interpretation of the Court's cases is that it was

16

interpreting a jurisdictional statute.

17

Williams Packing, the Court said it was a jurisdictional

18

statute.

19

And, indeed, in

But, again, even if you had doubt about

20

simply the cases, there's more than that because

21

Congress has not only not disturbed this Court's

22

decisions stating that the statute is jurisdictional;

23

they've passed numerous amendments to this

24

Anti-Injunction Act.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Well, it seems --

Official

1

you can't separate those two points.

2

Congress has acquiesced in what we have said only helps

3

you if what we have said is fairly consistent.

4

yourself, point out in the brief that we've kind of gone

5

back and forth on whether this is a jurisdictional

6

provision or not.

7

it, I'm not sure what they acquiesced in.

8
9

The idea that

And you,

So, even if Congress acquiesced in

MR. LONG:

Well, what you have said,

Mr. Chief Justice, has been absolutely consistent for

10

50 years, since the Williams Packing case.

11

of inconsistency was after -- the first 50 years, since

12

the statute was enacted in 1867, and there was a period,

13

as I said, when the Court was allowing extraordinary

14

circumstances exceptions and equitable exceptions, but

15

then, very quickly, it cut back on that.

16

and since Williams Packing, you've been utterly

17

consistent --

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

The period

And since --

Well, even since

19

Williams Packing, there was South Carolina v. Regan.

20

And that case can also be understood as a kind of

21

equitable exception to the rule, which would be

22

inconsistent with thinking that the rule is

23

jurisdictional.

24
25

MR. LONG:

Well, again, I mean, I think the

best understanding of South Carolina v. Regan is not
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that it's an equitable exception, but it's the Court

2

interpreting a jurisdictional statute as it would

3

interpret any statute in light of its purpose, and

4

deciding in that very special case, it's a very narrow

5

exception --

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Long, in Bowles, the

7

Court looked to the long history of appellate issues as

8

being jurisdictional in its traditional sense, not as a

9

claim-processing rule, but as a pure jurisdiction rule,

10
11

the power of the court to hear a case.
From all the questions here, I count at

12

least four cases in the Court's history where the Court

13

has accepted a waiver by the Solicitor General and

14

reached a tax issue.

15

of them just mentioned by Justice Kagan, where

16

exceptions to that rule were read in.

17

I have at least three cases, one

Given that history, regardless of how we

18

define jurisdictional statutes versus claim-processing

19

statutes in recent times, isn't the fairer statement

20

that Congress has accepted that in the extraordinary

21

case, we will hear the case?

22

MR. LONG:

No.

No, Justice Sotomayor,

23

because in many of these amendments which have come in

24

the '70s and the '90s and the 2000s, the Congress has

25

actually framed the limited exceptions to the
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Anti-Injunction Act in jurisdictional terms.

2

written many of the express exceptions by saying

3

notwithstanding section 7421 --

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And it has

But doesn't that just

5

prove that it knows that the court will impose a

6

claim-processing rule in many circumstances, and so, in

7

those in which it specifically doesn't want the court

8

to, it has to be clearer?

9

MR. LONG:

Well, but Congress says,

10

notwithstanding 7421, the court "shall have

11

jurisdiction" to restrain the assessment and collection

12

of taxes in very limited --

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could you go back to the

14

question that Justice Alito asked?

15

that this is not jurisdictional, what's the parade of

16

horribles that you see occurring if we call this a

17

mandatory claim-processing rule?

18

you imagine that courts will reach?

19

MR. LONG:

Right.

Assuming we find

What kinds of cases do

Well, first of all, I

20

think you'd be saying that for the refund statute as

21

24

court then reach the question, despite --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Long, I don't think

Alderson Reporting Company

1

you're going to come up with any, but I think your

2

response is you could say that about any jurisdictional

3

rule.

4

happen is you're going to have an intelligent Federal

5

court deciding whether you're going to make an

6

exception, and there will be no parade of horribles

because all Federal courts are intelligent.

think there should be.

22

much -- I'm probably leaning in your favor on

23

jurisdiction, but where I see the problem is in the

24

second part, because the second part says "restraining

25

the assessment or collection of any tax."

And I accept pretty

16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Now, here, Congress has nowhere used the

2

word "tax."

What it says is "penalty."

3

is not in the Internal Revenue Code but for purposes of

4

collection.

5

And so, why is this a tax?

Moreover, this

And I know you

6

point to certain sentences that talk about taxes within

7

the code --

8

MR. LONG:

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

10

to a tax.

Right.

It is attached to a health care requirement.

11

MR. LONG:

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

13

-- and this is not attached

Right.
So, why does it fall within

that word?

14

MR. LONG:

Well, I mean, the first point

15

is our -- our initial submission is you don't have to

16

determine that this is a tax in order to find that the

17

Anti-Injunction Act applies, because Congress very

18

specifically said that it shall be assessed and

19

collected in the same manner as a tax, even if it's a

20

tax penalty and not a tax.

21

So, that's one argument --

JUSTICE BREYER:

But that doesn't mean the

22

AIA applies.

23

exceptions, but it doesn't mean the AIA applies.

24
25

I mean -- and then they provide some

It says "in the same manner as."

It is then

attached to chapter 68, when that -- it references that
17
Alderson Reporting Company

as being "the manner of."

2

or if it's being collected in the same manner as a tax

3

doesn't automatically make it a tax, particularly since

4

the reasons for the AIA are to prevent interference with

5

revenue sources.

6

does not interfere with the collection of revenues.

7

Well, that it's being applied

And here, an advance attack on this

I mean, that's -- you've read the arguments,

8

as have I.

But I'd like to know what you say succinctly

9

in response to those arguments.
MR. LONG:

10

So, specifically on the argument

11

that it is actually a tax, even setting aside the point

12

that it should be assessed and collected in the same

13

manner as a tax, the Anti-Injunction Act uses the term

14

"tax"; it doesn't define it.

15

"tax" is not defined anywhere in the Internal Revenue

16

Code.

17

Anti-Injunction Act, "tax" had a very broad definition.

18

It's broad enough to include this exaction, which is

19

codified in the Internal Revenue Code.

2

ousters of jurisdiction are narrowly construed; that,

3

unless it's clear, courts are not deprived of

jurisdiction.

5

clear.

6

it's not clear.

And I find it hard to think that this is

7

Whatever else it is, it's easy to think that

MR. LONG:

Well, I mean, the Anti-Injunction

8

Act applies not only to every tax in the code but, as

9

far as I can tell, to every tax penalty in the code.

10

And --

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Long, you said

right, and that's obviously why -- if it were called a

tax, there would be absolutely no question that the

Absolutely.

seems to me that they all fall into the categories of

matters that were called by the court taxes; or, three,

taxes.

Now, what we have here is something that's

8

in a different statute that doesn't use the word "tax"

9

once, except for a collection device and, in fact, in

10

addition, the underlying AIA reason, which is to say to

11

the Solicitor General:

12

we, in Congress, don't want you in court where the

13

revenue of a State -- Tax Injunction Act -- or the

14

revenue of the Federal Government is at stake, and,

15

therefore, you can't waive it.

16

We don't care what you think;

Now, I got that.

Here it's not at stake,

17

and here there are all the differences I just mentioned.

18

So, I ask that because I want to hear your response.

19

MR. LONG:

Well, I mean, there are penalties

20

in the Internal Revenue Code that you really couldn't

21

say are related in any -- in any close way to some other

22

tax provision.

It's easier to talk about

that brings the jurisdictional question and

Justice Breyer's question together.

18

In a sense,

It seems to me -- maybe you could just

19

comment on that language.

Is that sort of language

20

usually contained in a jurisdictional provision?

an old statute.

5

essentially unchanged since 1867, and it -- you know, I

6

think that's part of the explanation for it.

7

again, it's, you know, become the center of a series of

8

provisions that very carefully control the circumstances

9

in which litigation about Federal taxes can take place.

10

I mean, this -- the core language is

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And,

Mr. Long, there's another

11

argument that has been made that I would like you to

12

address, and that is all this talk about tax penalty --

13

it's all beside the point because this suit is not

14

challenging the penalty.

15

challenging the must-buy provision, and the argument is

16

made that, if, indeed, "must-buy" is constitutional,

17

then these complainants will not resist the penalty.

This is a suit that is

18

So, what they're seeking is a determination

19

that the "must-buy" requirement, stated separately from

20

the penalty, that the "must-buy" is unconstitutional.

21

And, if that's so, that's the end of the case; if it's

22

not so, they're not resisting the penalty.

23

MR. LONG:

Well, I think that argument

24

doesn't work for two reasons.

I mean, first, if you

25

look at the plaintiffs' own complaint, they clearly
24
Alderson Reporting Company

challenge both the minimum coverage requirement and the

2

penalty.

challenge the requirement that the individuals obtain

health care coverage or pay a penalty.

At page 122 of the Joint Appendix, they

Well, why is that?
If that's -- if that's

7

the problem, it's easy to amend a complaint.

10

They can

think that's a serious problem.

13

14

this case, I don't think you can separate the minimum

15

coverage requirement from the penalty, because the

16

penalty is the sole means of enforcing the minimum

17

coverage requirement.

18

But even if they had

So, first, I mean, I think these plaintiffs

19

would not be satisfied if the Court were to render a

20

judgment saying the minimum coverage requirement is

invalidated; the penalty, however, remains standing.

5

argument puts them in the position of having to disobey

6

the law in order to obtain review of their claim.

7

what is your answer to that?

8

MR. LONG:

And

Well, I mean, first of all, I

9

can't find that in the record, in their declarations.

10

don't see a statement that they will, you know, never

11

incur a penalty under any circumstances.

12

even if that were so, what this Court has said in

13

Americans United is the Anti-Injunction Act bars any

14

suit, not just to enjoin the collection of your own

15

taxes, but to enjoin the collection of anyone's taxes.

But -- but

And so, even if it were really true that

17

these plaintiffs were not interested in the penalty and

18

would never pay the penalty, if they were to succeed in

this case in striking down the minimum coverage

requirement, the inevitable result would be that the

penalty would fall as well, because the government

Alderson Reporting Company

1

reads, that it should instead be a regulatory command

2

and a penalty attached to that command.

3

MR. LONG:

Well, I would not argue that this

4

statute is a perfect model of clarity, but I do think

5

the most reasonable way to read the entire statute is

6

that it does impose a single obligation to pay a penalty

7

if you are an applicable individual and you're not

8

subject to an exemption.

9

And the reason I say that, if you look at

10

the exemptions from the penalty, I mean, the very first

11

one is you're exempt from the penalty because you can't

12

afford to purchase insurance.

13

reasonable to me to interpret the statute as Congress

14

having said, well, you know, this person is exempt from

15

paying a penalty because we find they can't afford to

16

buy insurance; however, they still have a legal

17

obligation to buy insurance.

reasonable.

And it just doesn't seem

That just doesn't seem

So, I do think, although it's -- I certainly

wouldn't argue it's clear, that that's the best way to

understand the statute as a whole.

not essential to the question we're discussing now, of

whether the Anti-Injunction Act applies.

Well, I mean, I think the

Solicitor General's reading would probably create the

14

fewest problems, as I understand it.

15

main objection to the Solicitor General's reading is I

probably three penalties for alcohol- and

tobacco-related offenses at 5114(c), 5684, and 5761 that

And I would, if I could, follow up on a

16

question, Justice Ginsburg, that you asked Mr. Long in

terms of the language of the Anti-Injunction Act,

18

7421(a), which can be found at page 16a of the appendix

19

to our brief.

20

I'd ask the Court to compare that to the

21

language of the very next provision in the code, which

22

is on the next page of our statutory appendix, 17a,

23

which is the refund statute, which we've talked about a

24

little bit so far this morning, 7422(a).

25

The refund statute this Court held in Dolan

was jurisdictional, and the Court in both Dolan and

2

Brockamp held that the statute of limitations that

GENERAL VERRILLI:

That's -- that is not our

GENERAL VERRILLI:

That's true,

Mr. Chief Justice.

2

Several points about that, though.

We do agree with Mr. Long's analysis that

3

Davis occurred in -- during a time in -- in which under

4

the Standard Nut case, the Court had interpreted the

5

Anti-Injunction Act as doing no more than codifying the

6

traditional equitable principles which allowed courts

7

discretion to conclude that in certain circumstances, a

8

case could go forward.

9

Williams Packing repudiated that analysis,

10

and Bob Jones v. Simon again repudiated that analysis

11

and said, no, we're no longer abiding by that.

12

true that the Davis case has not formally been

13

overruled, but we do think it's fundamentally

14

inconsistent with the Court's understanding now of -JUSTICE BREYER:

7

think the best answer to that is that there are no magic

words, and that history and context matter, as the Court

that 7422 and 7421 function together to protect an

exceedingly strong interest that the Court has held with

this is to look at the history.

So, I do think that, to the extent this

doesn't need to be before the Court because of the

24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

On your statutory

construction argument, is there any other exaction

Alderson Reporting Company

1

imposed under the Internal Revenue Code that would not

2

qualify as a tax for Anti-Injunction Act purposes, or is

3

5000A just out there all by itself?

4

GENERAL VERRILLI:

It's -- it's not quite

5

out there all by itself.

There are other provisions

6

that fall outside of subchapter B of chapter 68 and,

7

therefore, wouldn't be governed by the instruction in

8

section 6671(a), which answers the question about the

9

applicability of the Act for most penalties.
The ones that we've identified -- I may be

10
11

overlapping a little bit with Mr. Long here -- one is 26

12

U.S.C. 857, which imposes certain penalties in

13

connection with the administration of real estate

14

investment trusts.
There are provisions that Mr. Long

15
16

identified in his brief, sections 6038(a) through (c) of

17

the code, which impose certain penalties with respect to

18

reporting requirements for foreign corporations.

19

We have, in addition, in footnote 22 at page

21

Long also identified about -- about alcohol and tobacco.

8
9

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Yes.

If they don't buy

That is not a

correct reading of the statute, Justice Sotomayor.

The

10

only consequence that ensues is the tax penalty.

11

the -- we have made a representation, and it was a

12

carefully made representation, in our brief that it is

13

the interpretation of the agencies charged with

14

interpreting this statute, the Treasury Department and

15

the Department of Health and Human Services, that there

16

is no other consequence apart from the tax penalty.

17

And

And I do think, if I could talk for a couple

18

of minutes about the argument that was discussed as to

19

whether this can be conceived of as a suit just

20

challenging the requirement, which is entirely

21

stand-alone based on inferences drawn from the

22

exemptions, I really don't think that's right.

23

could spend a minute on it, I think it's important.

And if I

3

only as a practical matter, but I think there's a

textual indication and even as a legal matter,

5

they are -- they both function as exceptions to the

6

requirement.

7

But the -- but I think, not

First, as a practical matter, one of those

8

exemptions is a hardship exemption.

will just bear with me for one minute here, it's at page

10

11a of the appendix to our brief.

11

person can go to the Secretary of HHS and obtain a

12

hardship exemption for -- which would, as a formal

13

matter here, excuse compliance with the penalty.

14

It provides that a

It seems to me to make very little sense to

15

say that someone who has gone to an official of the

16

United States and obtained an exemption would,

17

nonetheless, be in the position of being a law breaker.

18

We think another way in which you can get to

19

the same conclusion slightly differently is by

20

considering the provision on the prior page, 10a, which

21

is 5000A -- 5000A(e)(3), members of Indian tribes.

22

Members of Indian tribes are exempt only from the

23

penalty as a formal matter under the structure of the

24

statute here, but the reason for that is because members

25

of Indian tribes obtain their health care through the
46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Indian Health Service, which is a clinic-based system

2

that doesn't involve insurance at all, and it's an

3

entirely different system.

4

They were taken out of this statute because

5

they get their health care through a different system.

6

And it doesn't make any sense to think that persons

7

getting their health care through the Indian Health

8

Service are violating the law because -- because exempt

9

only from the penalty but still under a legal obligation

10

to have insurance, when the whole point of this is that

11

they're supposed to be in a clinic-based system.

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Is your whole point that

13

this was inartful drafting by Congress, that, to the

14

extent that there is an exemption under the penalty,

15

it's an exemption from the legal obligation?

16

GENERAL VERRILLI:

I guess what I would say

17

about it, Your Honor, is that the way in which this

18

statute is drafted doesn't permit the inference that my

19

friends from the NFIB are trying to draw from it.
And there is an additional textual

20
21

indication of that, which one can find at page 13 of our

22

reply brief.

23

section 18022(e).

24

a certification that certain individuals can get.

25

this is the paragraph starting with the words "Other

This is a provision that is 42 U.S.C.A.

And it says, "an individual with a

3

'certification' ... that the individual is exempt from

4

the requirement under Section 5000A ... by reason of

5

section 5000A(e)(1) of such Code," is entitled to a

6

certificate that allows for enrollment in a particular

7

program for this category of people.

8
9

But you can see here, Congress is saying an
exemption under 5000A(e)(1), which is the exemption from

10

the penalty, and not the underlying requirement, is, as

11

Congress says, an exemption from the requirement of

12

section 5000A.

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

General --

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

5000A says, directly, "an

15

applicable individual shall ensure that the individual

16

has the minimum essential coverage."

17

it doesn't really mean that, that if you're not subject

18

to the penalty, you're not under an obligation to

19

maintain the minimum essential coverage.

20

GENERAL VERRILLI:

And you're saying

That's correct.

And we

21

think that's what Congress is saying, both in the

provision I just pointed to, Your Honor, and by virtue

23

of the fact -- by virtue of the way the exemptions work.

18

that's the case -- and I think that would be true of

20

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Yes.

We don't -- we've

why isn't this case subject to the same bars that -55

dismissal for failure to exhaust?

GENERAL VERRILLI:

The Tax Court, at least so

We don't -- because the

exhaustion would go to the individual amount owed, we

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So, how do you deal with

5

this case and our Gonzalez -- our recent Gonzalez case,

6

where we talked about --

7

MR. KATSAS:

8

Right.
-- the language of the

COA statute, that no appeal will be heard absent the
issuance of?

11

MR. KATSAS:

Gonzalez -- Gonzalez v. Thaler

12

rests on a special rule that applies with respect to

13

appeals from one Article III court to another.

14

That's -- that explains Gonzalez, and it explains Bowles

15

before it.

16

You have five unanimous opinions in the last

17

decade in which you have strongly gone the other

18

direction on what counts as jurisdictional.

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

There is an argument

20

that we should just simply say that Bowles applies only

21

to appeals, but we haven't said that.

22

MR. KATSAS:

Though, you came very close.

23

In Henderson, Justice Sotomayor, you said that Bowles,

24

which is akin to Thaler, is explained by the special

25

rules and understandings governing appeals from one
59
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

Article III court to another.

2

that it does not apply to situations involving a party

3

seeking initial judicial review of agency action, which

4

is what we have here.

5

And you specifically said

So, while you're right, the texts in Bowles

6

and Thaler are not terribly different, those cases are

7

explained by that principle.

Under Henderson, it

MR. KATSAS:

3

jurisdictional language at all, and not a single one of

4

them uses the word "jurisdiction" to describe the

5

ability of the court to restrain the assessment and

6

collection of taxes, which is what one would have

7

expected --

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

It basically, basically the

difference -- of language is relevant.

There are a lot

10

of relevant things.

But one thing that's relevant in my

11

mind is that taxes are, for better or for worse, the

12

life's blood of government.

13

MR. KATSAS:

Yes.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

And so, what Congress is

15

trying to do is to say there is a procedure here that

16

you go through.

17

through the Tax Court, but don't do this in advance for

18

the reason that we don't want 500 Federal judge --

5

MR. KATSAS:

Except --

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

The language -- you're -- I

7

see the similarity of language.

I've got that.

But

8

it's the reasoning, the sort of underlying reason for

9

not wanting a waiver here that is -- has a significant

10

role in my mind of finding that it is jurisdictional.

11

Plus the fact that we've said it nonstop since that

12

Northrop or whatever that other case is.

13

MR. KATSAS:

Justice Breyer, as to

14

reasoning, you -- you give an argument -- you give an

15

argument why, as a policy matter, it might make sense to

16

have a non-jurisdictional statute.

17

Court's recent cases time and again say Congress has to

18

clearly rank the statute as non-jurisdictional in its

19

text and structure.

20

statutory policies doesn't speak with sufficient

21

clarity --

But of course, this

It seems to me a general appeal to

they're affirmatively pursuing an argument on the other

side.

18

And not only are they not pursuing it here;

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Katsas, is your basic

19

position that when we're talking about the jurisdiction

20

of the district courts, a statute has to say it's

21

jurisdictional to be jurisdictional?

22

MR. KATSAS:

I wouldn't go quite that far.

23

I think at a minimum, it has -- it has to either say

24

that or at least be directed to the courts, which is a

25

formulation you've used in your cases and which is the
64
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

formulation that Congress used in the Tax Injunction Act

2

but did not use in this statute.

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, how is -- I mean, I

4

suppose one could try to make a distinction between this

5

case and Reed Elsevier by focusing on the difference

6

between instituting something and maintaining something.

7

I'm suggesting that instituting is more what a litigant

8

does, and maintaining, as opposed to dismissing, is more

9

what a judge does.
MR. KATSAS:

10

I don't think so, Justice

11

Kagan, because we have an adversarial system, not an

12

inquisitorial one.

13

I think, is the more natural way of thinking of it.

14
15

The parties maintain their lawsuits,

If I could turn -- if I could turn to the
merits question on the AIA before my time runs out.

16

The purpose of this lawsuit is to challenge

17

a requirement -- a Federal requirement to buy health

18

insurance.

19

for that reason alone, we think the Anti-Injunction Act

20

doesn't apply.

21

That requirement itself is not a tax.

And

What the amicus effectively seeks to do is

22

extend the Anti-Injunction Act, not just to taxes which

23

is how the statute is written, but to free-standing,

24

nontax legal duties.

25

And it's just --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
65
Alderson Reporting Company

The whole point --

Official

1

the whole point of the suit is to prevent the collection

2

of penalties.

3

MR. KATSAS:

Of taxes, Mr. Chief Justice.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, prevent the

5

collection of taxes.

6

something separate from whether you want to call it a

7

penalty or tax just doesn't seem to make much sense.

8
9
10
11

But the idea that the mandate is

MR. KATSAS:

It's entirely separate, and let

me explain to you why.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It's a command.

A

mandate is a command.

12

MR. KATSAS:

Right.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Now, if there's

14

nothing behind the command -- it's sort of, well, what

15

happens if you don't follow the mandate, and the answer

16

is nothing -- it seems very artificial to separate the

17

punishment from the crime.

18

MR. KATSAS:

I'm not sure the answer is

19

nothing, but even assuming it were nothing, it seems to

20

me there is a difference between what the law requires

21

and what enforcement consequences happen to you.

22

statute was very deliberately written to separate

23

mandate from penalty in several different ways.

24
25

They are put in separate sections.

This

The

mandate is described as a "legal requirement" no fewer
66
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

than 20 times, 3 times in the operative text and 17

2

times in the findings.

It's imposed through use of a

3

mandatory verb "shall."

The requirement is very well

4

defined in the statute, so it can't be sloughed off as a

5

general exhortation, and it's backed up by a penalty.

6

Congress then separated out mandate

7

exceptions from penalty exceptions.

It defined one

8

category of people not subject to the mandate.

9

would think those are the category of people as to whom

One

10

Congress is saying you need not follow this law.

11

then defined a separate category of people not subject

12

to the penalty, but subject to the mandate.

13

know what that could mean other than --

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I don't

Well, why would you

15

have a requirement that is completely toothless?

16

you know, buy insurance or else.

17

nothing.

18

MR. KATSAS:

It

Or else what?

Pay -Or else

Because Congress reasonably

19

could think that at least some people will follow the

20

law precisely because it is the law.

21

you an example of one category of person that might be:

22

The very poor, who are exempt from the penalty but

23

subject to the mandate.

24
25

And let me give

Mr. Long says this must be a mandate
exemption because it would be wholly harsh and
67
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

unreasonable for Congress to expect people who are very

2

poor to comply with a requirement to obtain health

3

insurance when they have no means of doing so.

4

That gets things exactly backwards.

The

5

very poor are the people Congress would be most

6

concerned about with respect to the mandate to the

7

extent one of the justifications for the mandate is to

8

prevent emergency room cost shifting when people receive

9

uncompensated care.

So, they would have had very good

10

reason to make the very poor subject to the mandate, and

11

then they didn't do it in a draconian way; they gave the

12

very poor a means of complying with the insurance

13

mandate, and that is through the Medicaid system.

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Katsas, do you think a

15

person who is subject to the mandate but not subject to

16

the penalty would have standing?

17

MR. KATSAS:

Yes, I think that person would,

18

because that person is injured by compliance with the

19

mandate.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

20
21

like?

22

was?

23

And what would that look

What would the argument be as to what the injury

MR. KATSAS:

The injury -- when that person

24

is subject to the mandate, that person is required to

25

purchase health insurance.

That's a forced acquisition
68

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

of an unwanted good.

It's a classic pocketbook injury.

But even if I'm wrong about that question,

3

Justice Kagan, the question of who has standing to bring

4

the challenge that we seek to bring seems to me very

5

different -- your hypothetical plaintiff is very

6

different from the actual plaintiffs.

7

individuals who are planning for compliance in order to

8

avoid a penalty, which is what their affidavits say.

9

And we have the States, who will be subject no doubt to

We have

10

all sorts of adverse ramifications if they refuse to

11

enroll in Medicaid the people who are forced into

12

Medicaid by virtue of the mandate.

13
14
15

So, we don't have the problem of no adverse
consequences in the case.
And then, we have the separate distinction

16

between the question of who has Article III standing in

17

order to maintain a suit and the question of who is

18

subject to a legal obligation.

19

cases that even if there may be no one who has standing

20

to challenge a legal obligation like the incompatibility

21

clause or something, that doesn't somehow convert the

22

legal obligation into a legal nullity.

23

And you've said in your

Finally, with respect to the States, even if

Katsas, when the States say that they're injured, are

people who will become newly eligible?

suggest that the State is being injured because people

16

there's a challenge to the individual mandate.

17

MR. KATSAS:

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

There --

Yes.
All right?

What does

19

the fact that the State is challenging Medicaid -- how

20

does it give the State standing to challenge an

21

obligation that is not imposed on the State in any way?

22

MR. KATSAS:

The principal theory for State

23

standing is that States are challenging the mandate

24

because the mandate injures them when people are forced

25

to enroll in Medicaid.

Now, it is true they are not directly

subject to the mandate, but --

Let me -- let me try

Okay.

to --

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

7

MR. KATSAS:

8

That's what I'm --

-- a little confused by.

Let me try it this way -- may I

finish the thought?

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
MR. KATSAS:

10

Yes.

In South Carolina v. Regan, the

11

State was not subject to the tax at issue.

12

was harmed as the issuer of the bonds, and the bond

13

holders were the ones subject to the tax.

14

is injured not because it is the direct object of the

15

Federal tax, but because of its relationship to the

16

regulated party as issuer/bond holder.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So, the State

Thank you,

Mr. Katsas.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A. LONG

23

AS THE COURT-APPOINTED AMICUS CURIAE

24
25

MR. LONG:

Everyone agrees that the section

5000A penalty shall be assessed and collected in the
73
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

same manner as taxes.

2

argument why that does not make the Anti-Injunction Act

3

applicable is that, well, that simply goes to the

4

Secretary's activities.

5

And the parties' principal

And I would simply ask, if you look at

6

chapters 63 and 64 of the Internal Revenue Code, which

7

are the chapters on assessment and collection, they are

8

not just addressed to the Secretary.

9

provisions in there that are addressed to courts and

10

indeed talk about this interaction, the very limited

11

situations in which courts are permitted to restrain the

12

assessment and collection of taxes.

13

There are many

There was a statement made that there

14

aren't -- and many of the exceptions to the

15

Anti-Injunction Act are in the assessment and collection

16

provisions -- there was a statement made that none of

17

these directly confer jurisdiction to restrain the

18

assessment and collection of taxes.

19

In footnote 11 of our opening brief, we cite several.

That's not true.

I'll simply mention section 6213 as an

20
21

example.

That says -- I quote:

"Notwithstanding the

22

provisions of section 7421(a), the making of such

23

assessment or the beginning of such proceeding or levy

24

during the time such prohibition is in force may be

25

enjoined by a proceeding in the proper court, including
74
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the Tax Court.

2

to enjoin any action or proceeding or order any refund

3

under this subsection unless a timely petition for

4

redetermination of the deficiency has been filed and

5

then only in respect of the deficiency that is the

6

subject of such petition."

7

The Tax Court shall have no jurisdiction

JUSTICE BREYER:

All that's going to really

8

what I'd think Congress's intent was meant to be in

9

sticking the collection thing into chapter 68, and --

10

and it's certainly an argument in your favor.

11

The over-arching thing in my mind is it's up

12

to Congress, within leeway.

And they did not use that

13

word "tax," and they did have a couple of exceptions.

14

And it is true that all this language that you quote --

15

you know, the first two sentences and so forth, it talks

16

about the use of "tax" in the IRC.

17

penalties and liabilities provided by this subchapter.

18

And we look over here, and it's a penalty and liability

19

provided by a different law, which says collect it

20

through the subchapter.

21

the IRC.

It talks about the

And it has nothing to do with

See?

22

So, we've got it in a separate place.

We

23

can see pretty clearly what they're trying to do.

24

couldn't really care very much about interfering with

25

collecting this one.

They

That's all the statutory argument.
75

1

Are you following me?

2

MR. LONG:

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, I -You see?

I'm trying to get

4

you to focus on that kind of argument that I'm just

5

making.

6

MR. LONG:

I mean, I think I'm following

7

you, but the fact that it's not in the particular

8

subchapter for assessable penalties in my view makes no

9

difference, because they said it's still clearly -- it's

10

assessed and collected in the same manner --

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

12

MR. LONG:

Yes, it is.

-- as a penalty in that

13

subchapter, and those penalties are collected in the

14

same manner as taxes.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

16

MR. LONG:

Yes, yes.

And so, that's -- I think it's

17

rather detailed, but I think it's a rather clear

18

indication that the Anti-Injunction Act applies.

19

The -- the refund statute that does

20

specifically refer to penalties -- that has nothing to

21

do with this argument that it's assessed and collected

22

in the same manner as a tax.

23

the point that, well, you can't just call it a tax,

24

because they've referred to it as a penalty.

25

That would simply go to

And, finally, on jurisdiction, you know, I
76
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

think the key point is we have a long line of this

2

Court's decisions that's really been ratified by

3

Congress, with all these exceptions in jurisdictional

4

terms.

5

As I read Bowles and John R. Sand & Gravel,

6

the gist of those decisions was not any sort of special

7

rule about appeals, It's that when we have that

8

situation, which I would submit applies as much to the

9

collection of Federal taxes as it does to appeals from

10

Federal district courts when we have this degree of --

11

of precedent, including precedent from Congress in the

12

form of amendments to this Anti-Injunction Act, that

13

should be -- the presumption should be that this is

14

jurisdictional.

15

If there are no further questions.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Mr. Long, you were

17

invited by this Court to defend the proposition that the

18

Anti-Injunction Act barred this litigation.

19

ably carried out that responsibility, for which the

20

Court is grateful.

21

MR. LONG:

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

23
24
25

You have

Thank you.
We will continue

argument in this case tomorrow.
