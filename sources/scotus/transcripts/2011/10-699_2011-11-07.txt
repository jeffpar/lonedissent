ORAL ARGUMENT OF NATHAN LEWIN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. LEWIN:

Mr. -- Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

11

In its recent decisions in Medellin v. Texas

12

and in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, this Court approved and

13

applied the familiar tripartite scheme that Justice

14

Jackson articulated in the Steel Seizure case.

15

President takes measures incompatible with the expressed

16

or implied will of Congress, his power is at its lowest

17

ebb.

18

to a power at once so conclusive and preclusive must be

19

scrutinized with caution to preserve the equilibrium

20

established by our constitutional system.

21
22
23

When the

In that instance, said Justice Jackson, his claim

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, Mr. Lewin, what power

is Congress exercising here?
MR. LEWIN:

Justice Kagan, Congress has

24

exercised its power over passport -- the issuance of

25

passports under the immigration, naturalization, and
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

foreign commerce powers that Congress has.

2

enacted passport legislation back in 1856, in 1926.

3

can control what the contents of a passport ought to be,

4

what its duration may be, how the application is to be

5

made.

JUSTICE ALITO:

MR. LEWIN:

JUSTICE ALITO:

It has

But do you think -­

-- portion of the passport.
Do you think it's relevant

that the title of section 214 is "United States Policy
With Respect to Jerusalem as the Capital of Israel"?

11

MR. LEWIN:

Well, we think -- and we've

12

cited I guess in footnote 2 of our brief a number of

13

recent cases of this Court that have said that you take

14

each statutory provision independently and determine its

15

constitutionality.

16

with regard to the policy of Jerusalem being part of

17

Israel than the executive branch has had since 1948.

18

However, that purpose is not determinative of what the

19

constitutionality is of subsection (d).

20

True, Congress has a broader view

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Moreover -­

But you say, Mr. Lewin,

21

that -- you're not claiming exclusivity in Congress.

22

You say foreign relations is a shared power.

23

is a shared power, why does Congress trump the

24

executive?

25

MR. LEWIN:

So, if it

under the standard of the Steel Seizure case and this

tripartite scheme, if Congress determines that what the

President has done -- and this is a statute which is

really very narrow and deals with past conduct by the

5

executive branch, as it were.

President in terms of future foreign policy.

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It does not hobble the

Well, under your -- under

8

your theory -- and this is just following on Justice

9

Ginsburg's question, I think.

Under your theory, what

10

foreign relations determinations are for the President

11

alone to make?

12
13

MR. LEWIN:

Foreign relations determinations

are not left to the President alone.

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Are there any foreign

15

relations determinations that are for the President

16

alone to make under your theory of the case?

17

MR. LEWIN:

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MR. LEWIN:

25

Yes, Justice Kennedy.
And those are?

Those are diplomatic

In other, it's the President who

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In other words, who gets

the telegram or something?
MR. LEWIN:

Well, who issues the

communication to the foreign government, who
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

determines -- there are certain things that the

2

President alone does because he's the one who implements

3

foreign policy.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is there any treatise

5

writer or decision of this Court that supports such a

6

narrow, crabbed interpretation of the President's

7

foreign affairs power?

8

MR. LEWIN:

9

Well, with all respect,

Justice Kennedy, we don't think it's crabbed.

We think

10

that that is exactly what Justice Jackson was referring

11

to, and that's what this Court has said in the Medellin

12

case and -- and in Hamdan as well, that if -­

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MR. LEWIN:

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Of course -­

Congress does not authorize -­

17

think assumes the validity of the congressional statute

19

question.

20

MR. LEWIN:

And here that's the whole

I don't know whether it's

21

limited to the assumption with regard to the

22

congressional statute.

23

this case, we disapprove of the State Department's view

24

that passports should not contain the -- the

25

identification of Israel for people who were born in

If Congress says, as it did in

6
Alderson Reporting Company

1

Jerusalem, that is Congress disapproving of what the

2

State Department and past State Department policy has

3

been.

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Lewin, you were cut

5

off earlier when you were saying this reading doesn't

6

hobble the President in the future.

7

It says anybody born in -- in Jerusalem can

8

have Israel listed, correct?

What happens if there's a

9

peace accord tomorrow, and Israel gives up any claim to

10

sovereignty over Jerusalem?

Is the President free to

11

stop listing Israel on the passport?

for Congress to change the law?
MR. LEWIN:

I think he does have to wait for

Congress to change the law.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So, you are hobbling the

18

President with respect to situations that occur

19

frequently -­

20

MR. LEWIN:

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

22
23

Well -­
-- as happened in Egypt,

sometimes overnight.
MR. LEWIN:

No, but it may in some way, in a

24

very remote possible way -- I mean, I think under those

25

circumstances, if there were a peace treaty and if
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Jerusalem were handed over to a Palestinian state, I

2

think Congress would repeal the statute.

3

That's the point.

Congress has the power,

4

has the authority under the Constitution to enact laws,

5

and it is Congress that makes the decision even with

6

regard to foreign policy issues.

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The Constitution

8

requires ambassadors to be appointed with the consent of

9

the Senate.

It gives Congress the power of the purse.

10

So, why don't -- why isn't the better view that we let

11

Congress express its approval and disapproval in the

12

mechanism set up by the Constitution to do so?

13

if the President recognizes a country that Congress

14

doesn't want it to recognize, it can withhold approval

15

of an ambassador.

16

It could do many other things.

17

Meaning,

It could refuse to fund the embassy.

But what entitles Congress to trench on a

18

presidential power that has been exercised virtually

19

since the beginning of the country?

20

MR. LEWIN:

With all respect, Justice

21

Sotomayor, I think history demonstrates that that's

22

simply not true, that in fact Congress has had equal,

23

quote, "recognition power," if in fact that's a power

24

rather than a ceremonial duty.

25

brief gone through the fact that from Presidents Monroe,

We have in our reply

8
Alderson Reporting Company

Jackson, Taylor, Lincoln, and even at the time of

2

President McKinley, Congress said:

3

authority to be recognized -- to recognize.

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

We have the

Mr. Lewin, this gets back to

5

the question of exactly what congressional power you're

6

basing your argument on.

7

basing it on Congress's passport power, which is a

8

function of its control over immigration issues.

9

you're saying Congress has a co-equal recognition power.

10

You started by saying you were

Now

Which is it, or is it both?

11

MR. LEWIN:

No.

It's in the alternative,

12

Justice Kagan; it is both.

13

is no exclusive recognition power in the President, if

14

there is a recognition power, and we spell that out.

15

We submit first of all there

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Does that go the full

16

length of saying if Congress passed a law that says the

17

United States recognizes Jerusalem as the capital of

18

Israel and Jerusalem must be designated as the capital

19

of Israel in all official documents -- suppose that were

20

the law.

21

position would be, yes, Congress has that authority.

22

I take it, from everything you've argued, your

MR. LEWIN:

We say Congress has that

23

authority, but I have to add, Justice Ginsburg, that

24

Congress has been very careful in the past and we

25

believe it will be in the future to give the President
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

broad authority.

2

that, Congress has consistently said that the President

3

can waive the moving of the embassy to Jerusalem,

4

because Congress recognizes -- this is one of these very

5

rare situations where Congress has said what the

6

President has done and what the Department of State has

7

done is simply wrong.

8
9

To the extent Congress has tried to do

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Lewin, you're -- it

seems to me you're not arguing for a co-equal

10

congressional power; you're arguing for a superior

11

congressional power.

says, the President has to comply with.

13

quite different from saying that they both have

14

authority in the field.

15

in the field and they're exercising it in different

16

fashions, I frankly would not be inclined to intervene.

17

I would let -- I would let them conduct the usual

18

inter-branch hand wrestling that goes on all the time,

19

which probably means that if Congress cares enough,

20

Congress will win because, as you say, it has an

21

innumerable number of clubs with which to beat the

22

executive.

23

You're saying whatever Congress

But if -- if the power is a co-equal power

25

MR. LEWIN:

That seems

But what -- again, what Justice
11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Jackson said was that when there -- the two are

2

incompatible, then you look, the Court looks and

3

scrutinizes, "subjects to scrutiny" -- those words are

4

in Justice Jackson's standard -- scrutinizes what the

5

President has done.

6

And we submit in this case, if the Court

7

were to look at the answers to the interrogatories in

8

this case, what is the basis for the President's policy,

9

if one scrutinizes it, we say in our brief, it's -- we

10

call it trivial because what happens is the Department

11

of State has said -- and, again, this is important in

12

terms of this statute.

13

statute is that 50,000 American citizens have the same

14

passport as 100,000 other American citizens who were

15

born in Tel Aviv or Haifa.

16

doesn't say "Jerusalem, Israel"; it just says "Israel."

17

And the State Department says that's justified because

18

Arab countries or Palestinians may be upset if they

19

misperceive -­

20

All that happens with this

It just says "Israel"; it

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What -- so, you're

21

suggesting that the outcome of this of case would be

22

different, from your perspective, if Congress said you

23

have to say "Jerusalem, Israel."

24
25

MR. LEWIN:
yes, absolutely.

I say it's a different case,

In this case, what -- the important
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

thing about this case and this statute is that it gives

2

the individual passport holder a choice.

3
4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Why is it -- why is

it a different case?

5

MR. LEWIN:

It's a different case because if

6

it were to say "Jerusalem, Israel," there would be more

7

of an argument.

8

acknowledging that that's impermissible.

9

would be more of an argument that it appears to be some

10

Again, I'm not saying I would be here
But there

official approval of Jerusalem being in Israel.

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So, would there be

12

-- there would be a greater concern -- the concern on

13

the part of the executive that there would be adverse

14

political reaction would have a greater degree of

15

credibility?

16
17
18

MR. LEWIN:

Somewhat greater degree.

Again -­
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And so, we're

19

supposed to decide whether or not the executive is

20

correct in saying that it's a significant problem.

21

he says, well, he says that, but we know foreign policy

22

better; we don't think it's going to be a big deal.

23

MR. LEWIN:

And

No, I don't think the Court is

24

being asked to decide a question of foreign policy.

25

Congress has decided that saying "Israel" alone does not
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

present a foreign policy issue.

2

that, with moving the embassy, there might be a foreign

3

policy issue.

4

waive that.

5

Congress recognized

So, they said that the President can

With regard to this provision, Congress has

6

said, no, there's not likely to be any foreign policy

7

harm.

8

it's being asked to enforce the congressional

9

conclusion, which is, we submit, exactly what the third

And all that the Court is being asked to do is

10

level under Justice Jackson's test is:

11

fact, Congress decides that what the President has

12

concluded or the executive branch has concluded is

13

wrong, it may -- and it has the constitutional power to

14

say -- with regard to foreign policy, we can exercise

15

our determination.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That if, in

I don't see Justice

17

Jackson's analysis -- what he's saying -- and I guess I

18

don't think it's as controlling as others might.

19

saying when there's a conflict, it's a harder case.

20

MR. LEWIN:

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yes.
When there's -- when

22

they agree, it's an easy case.

23

it's sort of a middle case.

24

helpful in resolving the dispute before us.

MR. LEWIN:

He's

I don't see how that's very

Well, because he says that when

it's in the third category, the Court has an obligation,

2

under those circumstances if it's going to keep the

3

equilibrium of the balance of powers, to look at what

4

the President's justification is.

5

The word "scrutiny" is in there.

That's not

6

simply a phrase that Justice Jackson has taken out of

7

the air.

8

if you scrutinize it in this case, there's nothing other

9

than the possibility that there would be a misperception

MR. LEWIN:

What -- what were we

15

case, the Court was scrutinizing whether -­

16

notwithstanding the fact that Congress did not give the

17

President the power to seize steel mills, nonetheless

18

whether there could be some justification that, even in

19

-- contrary to Congress's wishes, the President would be

20

able to exercise that power.

13

that wasn't a case in which the Congress had said you

15

So,

Well, but that's -- that's an a

fortiori situation, Justice Kennedy.

It -- it is if you assume

that the statute is valid.

statute that seems to have nothing to do with the

13

immigration functions that passport statutes usually

14

serve.

Congress's declaration of a foreign policy, as opposed

16

to Congress's exercise of power relating to immigration

17

control.

18
19

It seems to have everything to do with

So, convince me that I am wrong on that.
MR. LEWIN:

I think you are wrong on that,

Justice, and let me explain why.

20

(Laughter.)

21

MR. LEWIN:

Let me explain why.

Because it

22

is clear from the history of this line on the passport

23

that it is purely an identification of the individual;

24

it is not an exercise of any foreign policy.

25

the passport statute itself says that a passport is "any
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Indeed,

Official

1

travel document issued by competent authority showing

2

the bearer's origin, identity, and nationality."

3

this case, the history of this line on the passport

4

demonstrates, I think conclusively, and the State

5

Department has acknowledged it, that it is purely a

6

means of identification.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

8

MR. LEWIN:

9

Are you suggesting -­

And what Congress has said is,

with regard to these citizens, we will permit them to

10

identify themselves, like Congress permitted the

11

Taiwanese to identify themselves.

12

And in

JUSTICE ALITO:

But are you suggesting

13

Congress enacted this because they thought that if these

14

individuals' passports simply said "Jerusalem," there

15

would be an identification problem?

16

MR. LEWIN:

Not be -- Justice Alito, it's

17

not because there would be an identification problem.

18

But there was -- Congress recognized that with regard to

19

the 50,000 people who have a passport that says

20

"Jerusalem," they are being denied a certain sense of

21

self-respect that they feel they should be able to have

22

in terms of their own identification.

23

This is not a statute that's designed to

24

create some political brouhaha or -- or make a foreign

25

policy statement.

It's a statute that, frankly, fits in
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

with what the State Department does in accommodating to

2

individual passport holders.

3

if you're a Palestinian or an Arab and you were born in

4

Haifa and you don't like seeing "Israel" on your

5

passport, we'll allow you to eliminate "Israel" from

6

your passport.

7

The State Department says

And all that Congress has said is -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

That might be true, Mr.

8

Lewin.

I think you would have a better argument if this

9

statute said if you were born in Jerusalem, you can pick

10

anything you want in your passport; you can pick

11

Jerusalem, you can pick Israel, or you can pick

12

Palestine.

13

It says you can pick Israel.

14

But the statute in fact doesn't say that.

So, why isn't that a statement of foreign

15

policy as to recognition that Jerusalem is the capital

16

of Israel, as opposed to what you're characterizing it

17

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

4

The executive has determined that the

5

passports it issues should not identify Israel as the

6

place of birth for persons born in Jerusalem.

7

Petitioner seeks relief under section 214(d) that would

8

countermand that executive judgment.

9

Constitution, that is an exercise of the executive's

exclusive recognition power.

19

acted as if they had co-equal authority.

20

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Mr. Chief Justice, if I

21

might spend a minute or two on that history, because I

22

don't think it shows what my friend suggests that it

23

does.

24
25

Before getting to the starting point of that
story, which I think is the Monroe administration, I
24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

would like to point out that in the Washington

2

administration, the President confronted the question

3

with respect to whether to recognize the revolutionary

4

government of France.

5

consulted with his cabinet, and, of course, his cabinet

6

included Jefferson and Madison and Hamilton and Jay.

7

And they decided that this was a power that was

8

exclusive to the President to such an extent that they

9

didn't even need to send a message to the Congress that

And President Washington

10

they were going to recognize the new revolutionary

11

government in France.

12

Now, the second fact that I think is

13

critical as a matter of history is that there is not a

14

single piece of legislation that has passed both houses

15

of Congress and come to the President purporting to

16

recognize a foreign nation or a territorial boundary of

17

a foreign nation.

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

Has there ever been an

19

instance in which the President has recognized a foreign

20

government over Congress's sustained objection?

21

GENERAL VERRILLI:

I don't -- I can't think of

22

an instance of Congress's sustained objection.

23

probably the closest we would come is the revolutionary

24

government of Mexico, which President Wilson first

25

recognized on a de facto basis in 1915 and a de jure

25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

basis in 1917.

Congress indicated displeasure with

2

that.

3

saying that this is an exclusive executive function.

4

Congress backed down.

President Wilson sent his message to Congress

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

What are then the reasons

6

that -- because your friend says that this is an a

7

fortiori case from everything, because all of these

8

words -- every time the word "exclusive power" has

supporting authority from Congress.

been a case or a suggestion that the President can act

13

where Congress has legislated to the contrary.

14

16

argument.

JUSTICE BREYER:

20

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Uh-huh.
It is true that the Court

21

has never before, with respect to the recognition power,

22

confronted the question of whether the President is free

23

to act in a manner different than a congressional

24

command because Congress has never purported to issue a

25

command.

That does not mean, however, that my friend is
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

correct that this is a situation in which Congress has

2

the authority to countermand or direct the decision of

3

the President.

4

This is, we submit -- even if one thinks

5

about this as a Youngstown category three case, this is

6

a Youngstown category three case of the kind that

7

Justice Jackson identified in footnote 4, where he cited

8

Myers v. The United States.

9

judgment can prevail even over a contrary judgment of

question, Justice Breyer, if I could return to the Chief

4

Justice's question about history.

5

initial recognition by Washington that this is an

6

exclusive power, which I think is quite significant,

7

when we get to the Monroe administration, there is a

8

fight between Clay and Monroe about whether the

9

President has exclusive authority to recognize the new

10

Moving beyond that

South American republics.

11

Now, a couple of points there.

I think the

12

-- what -- the only thing that one could point to as an

13

action by the Congress that even implicates the

14

recognition power is one house of Congress passed an

15

appropriations measure for an ambassador.

16

the history treatise, the Goebel treatise that my friend

17

cites, says on page 133, the very page that he cites in

18

his reply brief, is that Clay's effort to contest the

19

President's exclusive authority came to a, quote,

20

"inglorious end," unquote.

21

What the -­

He then goes on to say -- my friend goes on

22

to say, well, but a year later when President Monroe

23

sought to actually recognize these South American

24

republics, he asked -- he asked the Congress to join him

25

in it.

What he asked Congress for was an appropriation
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

for an ambassador.

2

ambassador to the Republic of Colombia that was the

3

recognition.

4

ambassador from Colombia that constituted the

5

recognition, and that was an exclusive act that he

undertook without any consultation with Congress.

So, if the -- Congress thought it had

example that my friend's identified.

20

it's an exclusive executive power.

21

But even there, I

President Jackson, in his first letter in

22

1836 to the Congress, says essentially:

I hear you; you

23

think we should recognize Texas.

24

It's an open question as far as I am concerned whether

25

there's exclusive authority or not.

And then he says:

29
Alderson Reporting Company

It's not been

Official

1

something that the legislature has ever studied, but as

2

a matter of expediency, he says, we don't need to

3

resolve that question, because I want to work with you.

4

He then goes on to caution the Congress to not move too

5

quickly for fear of precipitating war with Mexico, which

6

I think, Justice Breyer, I'll try to return to a

7

functional analysis later, and that's, I think, an

8

important point.

9

What -- then -- but I think what's

10

important, Justice Ginsburg, is that what Congress did

11

next was to pass two appropriations measures, one in the

12

House, one in the Senate.

13

appropriates funds for an emissary to the Republic of

14

Texas, but each includes language that says:

15

time that the President determines that it's appropriate

16

to do so.

17

Each of those measures

At such

If one looks at the page in the

18

Congressional Globe that my friend cites, one will see

19

that that language was added because, as originally

20

introduced, the appropriations riders were objected to

21

by members of Congress on the ground that they infringed

22

on the President's exclusive recognition authority.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, if I could

stop you and just have you address the political

25

question doctrine.
30
Alderson Reporting Company

1

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Sure.

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You say this is

3

exclusively committed to the President, and, therefore,

4

it is a non-justiciable political question.

5

different from saying it's our job to decide cases, it

6

is justiciable, and then you can argue that the answer

7

of that analysis is that it's exclusively committed to

8

the President?

9

political question advances the analysis much.

10

How is that

I don't understand why labeling it a

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Well, I think we agree,

11

Mr. Chief Justice, that there isn't a very great deal

12

of difference.

13

political question analysis, that it is for the Court to

14

decide whether there's a textual commitment to the

15

executive; it is for the Court to decide the scope.

16

think that's what Nixon v. United States says; it's what

17

Powell v. McCormack says; and that in answering those

18

questions, we think that the Court will have gone a very

19

long way to determining the question of the -­

textual commitment is a factor that the Court has

indicated is one that can lead to the conclusion that

it's a political question.

I do think that the Court has to go through
the analysis.

not be very much of a difference -- ­

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, doesn't it depend on

recognition of a foreign country, that might be one

thing.

18

In order to decide whether it's a

But what if the question is whether the

Now, if that's the question, is that
committed exclusively to the President?
GENERAL VERRILLI:

No, Justice Alito, we

don't -- we think Powell v. McCormack and Nixon say
32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that the question of -- not just the question of

2

commitment, but also the question of scope, are questions

3

for the Court to decide.

4

And we do think, with respect to the

5

question here, that even though it's for the Court to

6

decide, it's for the Court to decide with a very

7

significant measure of deference, because when -- the

8

decision by the executive with respect to how it's going

9

to handle the status of Jerusalem in passports is a very

10

sensitive and delicate matter.

11

arrived at after very careful thought, and it is

12

enforced very carefully.

13

come the lesson that this -- and the reason is because

14

the executive believes that the statement on the

15

passport has to be understood as a manifestation of the

16

President's exercise of the recognition power.

17

This position was

And I think from that should

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, suppose this, General

18

Verrilli:

Suppose that this statute -- there was the

19

section that's there now, and then there was another

20

section, and the section said:

21

as a place of birth on a passport shall not constitute

22

recognition of Israel's sovereignty over Jerusalem.

The recording of Israel

23

Would that be constitutional?

24

GENERAL VERRILLI:

25

would change the analysis, Justice Kagan.

I -- I don't think it

33
Alderson Reporting Company

I -- I think

Official

1

-- of course, that is not this statute, which has a title

2

which says "United States Policy With Respect to

3

Jerusalem as the Capital of Israel."

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But -­

No, my statute has a title

5

which says "Identification of Persons Born in

6

Jerusalem."

7

GENERAL VERRILLI:

I still -- I still think

8

that would be within the scope of the executive's power

9

to decide because the content of the passport, insofar

10

as the Executive believes that it constitutes an

11

expression of -- of an incident of recognition, is a

12

judgment that the executive makes.

13

Now, the Court can review that, but the

14

Court's review of it should be done with a significant

15

measure of deference as the Court suggested in Regan v.

16

Wald.

two quite different things.

2

It is the position of the executive, though,

3

that there could be circumstances in which Congress

4

could try to exercise its appropriations authority in a

5

way that would preclude the executive from exercising

6

its -- its recognition power, and that -- the executive

would in some circumstances believe that it had the

authority to move ahead despite those actions by

Congress.

Let me begin my rebuttal by echoing really

what Justice Alito said during my colleague's argument.

The question is whether anything that the President

15

is -- again, if one looks at the statute, if one even

looks at the Foreign Affairs Manual, a passport is not

18

identification of a person in order to enable him to

19

travel abroad.

The question is, what goes on
This

Now, again, let me also echo what the Chief

21

Justice and Justice Kagan asked during my colleague's

22

argument.

23

Jerusalem is part of Israel, but you can identify

24

yourself as being in Israel, my -- we submit that result

25

can very easily be achieved and was achieved in the case

People

3

who were born in Jerusalem can have their passport say

4

either "Jerusalem" or "Israel."

5

Congress hasn't said it has to say "Israel."

6

the Department of State can issue, as it did in the case

7

of Taiwan, a public statement saying this is not

8

official American policy.

9

That's their choice.
And then

Nobody's asking this Court to decide what is

10

official American policy.

12

there were no congressional statute.

If my client had decided he wanted to have
