ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

10
11

Mr. Chief Justice, may it

please the Court:
We ask this Court to hold that a jail may

12
13

strip search an arrestee in cases of reasonable

14

suspicion.

15

almost the entire country in the three decades after

16

Bell v. Wolfish, without either administrative

17

difficulty or any apparent increase in smuggling.

18

here today, of course, because both the Burlington Jail

19

and the Essex County Jail require every arrestee to

20

stand 2 feet in front of a correctional officer and

21

strip naked.

22

That is the rule that was applied throughout

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

We're

Do you apply the

23

reasonable suspicion rule to all arrestees?

24

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

We do apply it to all

2

arrestees.

I think they do that because they think that people who

5

commit more serious crimes might be inclined to greater

criminality.

offenders because this class definition is only people

who were arrested for minor offenses.

Yes, and, in fact -­

Well, then you are going

on a case-by-case basis based on the offense.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

The category -- there is a

21

categorical rule, and that is -- that was adopted by

22

these Respondents, by the Bureau of Prisons, and four

23

court of appeals, that says if you were arrested for a

24

more serious offense, categorically there exists

25

reasonable suspicion.

Yes.

JUSTICE ALITO:

-- to everybody, and I'm

21

asking you whether the mere fact that someone has been

22

arrested for a violent offense would in your judgment be

23

sufficient to provide reasonable suspicion.

24
25

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

If the jail made that

judgment, we would think that a court would not overturn
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that judgment.

2

contrast to when someone is arrested for not paying a

3

fine, that there is no justification whatsoever, because

4

the logic of their own policy is that this is a person

5

who's inclined to violence -­

6

We think that illustrates that, by

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But I take it -- I take it

7

what we're trying to do is to protect the individual

8

dignity of the detainee.

9

risk compromising that individual dignity if you say we

10

have reasonable suspicion as to you, but not as to you.

11

You're just setting us up, and you're setting the

12

detainee up for a classification that may be questioned

13

at the time and will be seen as an affront based on the

14

person's race, based on what he said or she said to the

15

officers coming in.

But it seems to me that you

16

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Right.
And so, it seems to me

18

that your rule imperils individual dignity in a way that

19

the blanket rule does not.

20

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Well, a couple of points,

21

Justice Kennedy.

I think it's an incredibly important

22

issue.

23

Respondents apply a reasonable suspicion standard.

24

do strip everyone naked, but if they're going to look

25

for contraband -- that is, look at the person's mouth,

They don't have a blanket rule.

6
Alderson Reporting Company

Remember, the
They

1

look at their anus -- they apply a reasonable suspicion

2

standard.

3

Now, to your very serious concern that maybe

4

we are inviting discrimination or at least an appearance

5

of discrimination, remember that their rule is going to

6

produce more of that problem than ours, because their

7

rule is not that they have to strip search -- they have

8

to strip search everyone for contraband, but their rule

9

is they can.

They can make a choice.

reasonable suspicion standard, which is the rule that

19

was applied almost everywhere in the wake of

Showering in the presence of

officers is not something that requires reasonable

suspicion.

7

privacy.

permitted.

1

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Yes, what is permitted is

2

anything -- what is not subject to a reasonable

3

suspicion standard is anything other than looking at -­

4

a close inspection of the person at arm's length.

5

the courts of appeals have uniformly recognized, in the

6

lower Federal courts, what the literature recognizes and

7

really what I think concerned this Court in the Safford

8

case is that when you are standing so close to the

9

person inspecting their genitals, looking directly at

10

their most private parts of their bodies, that is a

11

direct intrusion on their individual privacy -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry.

--are you suggesting three different levels?

15

What

Are you

It's okay to stand 5 feet away, but not 2?
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

I don't think that the

16

courts have had to confront 5 feet versus 2 feet.

17

they have confronted is they acknowledge that jails are

18

places that require security.

19

observing a shower room, that does not implicate a

20

reasonable expectation of privacy.

watch you shower naked.

14

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

intrusion is that you're standing 2 as opposed to 5 feet

line, that doesn't make much sense to me.

The second is I think

Yes.
Can you make an argument

that that's different than just a visual search?
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

You can.

So, let me just

10

say -- let me just try and close off my answer to the

11

question of the 5 versus 10 feet and then turn

12

immediately to this visual body cavity search.

13

Remember, this is -- the Court will recall

14

that this is a reprise of the argument in the Safford

15

case, where the schools there argued that, well, there's

16

an observation of these students in gym class, they

17

shower together naked, they undress naked.

18

Court said it's quite different when you're standing

19

right there looking over the student.

20

said that's what implicates a Fourth Amendment right of

21

privacy, and the distinction did make sense.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Goldstein, what -- what

13

you propose is reasonable enough, I suppose, and some

14

States could adopt that kind of a protocol instead of

15

what they have.

16

Fourth Amendment prohibits them from adopting it, and

17

the obstacle I see is that at the time the Fourth

18

Amendment was adopted, this -- this was standard

19

practice, to strip search people who were admitted to

20

prisons.

time and nobody thought it was unconstitutional?

But what you're asserting is that the

So, how could it be deemed an unreasonable

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

We don't believe that the

premise is correct.

If you read history differently

25

than me, I'm not going to be able to persuade you.
12
Alderson Reporting Company

But

Official

1

our understanding of the history is that the closest

2

they can come to is two things:

3

strip searched upon arrest, and that's certainly not the

4

rule under the Fourth Amendment; and that in certain

5

jails at the time of the founding, other inmates in a

6

process of ablution, what is almost kind of a ritual

7

cleansing, would strip search new inmates.

nothing to do with the jail officials themselves or

trying to intercept contraband.

nearly -- the nearly uniform practice that I think your

question assumes.

fish entirely, that -- we don't believe, obviously, that

that historical lesson obtains today, that the prisoners

21

can strip search new inmates as they -- new arrestees as

22

they come in.

And it's just a different kettle of

I do agree with the basic premise of your

12

significant reason that this -- not just in the nature

conclusion of the jail about reasonable suspicion is

3

is that that is voluntary.

4

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I have two explanations.
That you don't have to have

6

visitors.

7

visitors on your waiver of your Fourth Amendment rights?

Can you really condition your -- your having

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Yes.

20
21
22

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Yes, I believe that

that's -- I think that's a fair statement of the law.
I do have a second point, though, and that

23

is that the principal reason underlying

24

Bell v. Wolfish's holding that those searches were

25

reasonable is that it was essential to deter smuggling,
22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

and that deterrence rationale has much more of an

2

attenuated relationship to this case.

3

Remember that the inmate in that case was

4

having a planned meeting with someone, and the

5

representation of the government is that our problem is

6

if you plan to have somebody come visit you and you're

7

going to have a contact visit, you can plan for them to

8

try and sneak something to you.

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

This Court has set -­

Mr. Goldstein, there, of

10

course, were guards there who were watching the visits.

11

And, as I understand that case, there was really no

12

empirical evidence that smuggling came about as a result

13

of these visits.

14

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Well, can I just read to you

15

what the Court said about that?

16

did have a slightly different take, I think.

17

is from page 559 of the Court's opinion:

18

has been only one instance where an MCC inmate was

19

discovered attempting to smuggle contraband into the

20

institution on his person may be more a testament to the

21

effectiveness of the search technique as a deterrent

22

than to any lack of interest on the part of the inmate

23

to secrete and import such items when the opportunity

24

arises."

great question for them, because that's their rule.

They have a rule that says for minor offenders that you

have to have reasonable suspicion to search for

contraband.

state the constitutional rule, and you keep talking

everyone, the felon as well as the minor offenders.

minor offenders; so, let's limit it to that.

JUSTICE BREYER:

How do you want us to write

follow it and know exactly what they're supposed to do.

6

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

For three decades the rule

7

that was articulated by the Federal courts and applied

8

without difficulty is one that says for minor offenses.

9

When that was applied in practice it was basically done

10

at a felony versus misdemeanor line.

11

that if you are -- the courts accepted that if you are

12

suspected of a more serious offense, then for

13

administrative reasons and because we just think you

14

might be engaged in more criminality, then you don't

15

have to have any individualized inquiry whatsoever.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The court accepted

I can understand that -- I

17

can understand that for cavity searches, but -- but why

for the search to see that -- if the person has any

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

If that's what they're

15

doing, I think that that is okay.

16

that that is not itself a -- because of the prospect of

handling that problem with shampoo, which is what these

18

jails do, that that's not a sufficient -- a sufficient

19

justification to require the person to strip naked.

20

The courts have said

The only other point that I did want to make

21

is that this is the rule, not just at Burlington and

22

Essex, but also of the U.S. Marshals Service, which has

23

the intake of 220,000 inmates every year, and also of

24

the Bureau of Immigration Customs Enforcement, which

25

intakes 384,000 a year.

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

That's not correct.

That is

5

only the policy of the U.S. Bureau of Prisons, which has

6

an intake of minor offenders of only a few thousand

7

people a year.

8

you or do you not have an objection to the superseding

18

because they still have to stand naked directly in front

19

of the correctional officer under the superseding

Burlington's policy throughout this, is that they will

not search the person for contraband, which is their

What the superseding policy is, which is

MR. PHILLIPS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

4

I actually appreciate the clarification that

5

your questions brought to this case, because I think

6

there's a bit of confusion that I'd like to try to clear

7

up, although my -- my colleague's movement in terms of

8

answering some of the questions left me a little bit

9

perplexed as to exactly what the nature of their claims

10

are.

11

The -- the first question that it seems to

12

me the Court should focus on is what policy is at issue

13

here.

14

deals with one set of issues and the plaintiff's claims

15

deal with another set of issues, I think you have to be

16

careful.

17

And, obviously, since the class certification

I think you have to focus on the policies

18

that existed in 2005.

That was the basis on which he

19

was in fact searched under these circumstances.

20

policy in Burlington was that -- was primarily aimed,

21

frankly, at health and tattoos, and the policy at Essex

22

was aimed primarily at contraband and then secondarily

23

at tattoos and health.

And the

24

And the policy at Burlington was largely

25

a -- you come into prison, you give up your clothes,
33
Alderson Reporting Company

they look through your clothes, you take a shower, they

2

examine you fairly cursorily, but look at you, and then

-- then give you prison garb and move along your way.

I'm sorry.

Is the

5

shower and look at you cursorily -- are those separate

6

things?

Or is it during the shower?

7

MR. PHILLIPS:

places a lot of significance on how close -­

examination?

-- the examination

So, under that policy, how close was the

14

MR. PHILLIPS:

It almost certainly would

15

have been about an arm's length, because at that -- I

16

mean, the problem is if you're exchanging clothes with

17

somebody, you're handing them clothes to change into,

18

it's sort of hard to be longer than arm's length and

19

actually get the clothes into his hand.

20

21

MR. PHILLIPS:

And that's actually

8

what they do in Essex.

In Essex, they do it that way.

9

The difference between Essex is that Essex, in fact,

10

does have -- I mean, part of the problem is

11

terminological, all right?

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

13

MR. PHILLIPS:

Yes.

You know, Burlington is

14

basically a body visual observation, and the district

15

court said that's unconstitutional, that just observing

16

at all is unconstitutional.

17

To some extent, it seems to me my -- my

18

friend here has given up that part of the district

19

court's decision, which -- then clearly the court of

20

appeals, to the extent it reversed that part, ought to

21

be affirmed on that ground alone.

22
23
24
25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Visual observation from

more than 2 feet, or less than 2 feet?
MR. PHILLIPS:

was not the district court's theory.

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, it depends on whose

version of it.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

8

MR. PHILLIPS:

9

We don't know.
You have to remember, the

district court granted summary judgment to the plaintiff

10

in this case.

11

to interpret -- you'd have to give us the benefit of the

12

interpretation, which was that it was more than 2 feet.

13

So, you would have to -- you would have

But the court of appeals reversed, of

14

course, without regard to that, because the court of

15

appeals said, look, if you -- if you apply this Court's

16

decision in Bell v. Wolfish, it doesn't matter, because

17

you can engage in a much more intrusive true body cavity

18

search, which frankly is more intrusive than even what

19

Essex County asks -- has -- does in this case, because

20

he wasn't asked to bend over and to -- and to have a

21

that will cause the contraband then to fall out, and you

individuals that have minor offenses."

that's their expert's characterization, that minor

offenders bring in more contraband than major offenders.

When you get beyond that point and start to

cavity search but simply an anal-focused and

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Can we go back to

Justice Alito's question?

9

we look at under the Fourth Amendment reasonableness?

And should we be thinking about the fact that many of

11

these people who are now being arrested are being put

12

into general populations or into jails, sometimes not

13

just overnight but for longer periods of time, like this

14

gentleman, for 6 days before he sees a magistrate?

15

Should we be considering a rule that basically says your

16

right to search someone depends on whether that

17

individual has in fact been arrested for a crime that's

18

going to lead to jail time or not, whether that person's

19

been presented to a magistrate to see whether there is

are people who self-report who've obviously got an

opportunity to bring in contraband, and there are a lot

of people who just get arrested and happen to have drugs
