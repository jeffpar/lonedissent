ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL S. FRIED

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. FRIED:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

Our brief lists six categories of

12

authorities demonstrating that the work of an

13

interpreter under 28 U.S.C. section 1920(6) is limited

14

to spoken communication.

15

Court Interpreters Act itself, whose central provisions

16

afford simultaneous or consecutive spoken interpreter

17

services.

18

Primary among these is the

When the -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could I make sure that I

19

understand the extent of your argument?

20

that it's interpretation, oral interpretation, just in

21

the courtroom?

22

MR. FRIED:

Are you saying

Well, Your -- Justice Sotomayor,

23

I think that it's a -- that there is a textual ambiguity

24

in the statute about the extent of covered spoken

25

interpreter services.

One could argue it either way,

and we don't -- I am happy to proceed under either

2

assumption.

3

extends within the area of spoken interpretation,

4

document translation is --

5

But what's clear is that, however far it

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I -- I have to say that

6

if you read it the way you do, then what you're

7

suggesting is that for appointed experts, they only get

8

recompensed for the time they're testifying, because

9

that's the only time they spend in court.
MR. FRIED:

10
11

Court-appointed experts, Your

Honor?

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

13

MR. FRIED:

Yes.

I think the -- the legislative

14

history of that seems to indicate that that provision

15

was actually inserted into 1920(6) for a separate

16

housekeeping reason, because it paralleled Rule 706 of

17

the Federal Rules of Evidence, which was a pre-existing

18

rule addressing court-appointed experts, and simply put

19

it into the enumeration.

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But court experts get

21

a -- get paid for their prep work.

22

MR. FRIED:

Yes, Your Honor.

23

that -- that that may well be the case.

24

think that the --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I -- I think

question.

2

MR. FRIED:

Of course.

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I take all your

4

arguments, but I read the common dictionary and there's

5

no question that the primary meaning of "interpreter" is

6

interpretation of oral languages.

7

broad enough to include translation work as well.

8
9

But the dictionary is

Given that the courts for 70 years have been
awarding -- most of the them except for I think the

10

Seventh here.

Virtually every court over a 70-year

11

period has been awarding translation fees as -- as

12

authorized.

Why shouldn't that be enough for us?

13

MR. FRIED:

Well, I --

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Meaning, if the

15

dictionary term is broad enough and that's what the

16

courts have been doing and the world hasn't crashed

17

despite one case where a large amount was given -- your

18

adversary points to the fact that most of the

19

translation fees tend to be fairly reasonable.

20

should we muck with what works?

21
22
23

MR. FRIED:

Why

Well, Your Honor, I think

that -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I think I'm drawing --

I'm drawing from ways that my colleague next to me

25

usually asks a question.

1

(Laughter.)

2

MR. FRIED:

Your Honor, I think that the

3

primary reason why the Court should -- should not adopt

4

that is because it's -- it's inconsistent with the text.

5
6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's wrong is your answer,

right?

7

MR. FRIED:

8

(Laughter.)

9

MR. FRIED:

Yes, Your Honor.

And -- and it's also worth

10

noting that the courts -- none of the courts of appeals

11

who have adopted this construction of 1920(6) have

12

considered or addressed our primary arguments in this

13

case.

14

professional literature addressing this -- this topic,

15

the dictionaries in their aggregate, the Administrative

16

Office's interpretation of this statute, the consistent

17

congressional distinction between written translation

18

and spoken -- spoken interpretation that runs throughout

19

the code.

20

They haven't addressed the -- the uniform

And -JUSTICE KAGAN:

So, just out of curiosity,

21

why do you think that all these courts just took for

22

granted the opposite reading?

23

MR. FRIED:

Well, Your Honor, I'm -- I'm not

24

sure that I have a -- a good answer to that.

25

perhaps that they weren't presented with some of
6

these -- these arguments and didn't have the opportunity

2

to consider them.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Perhaps it was

4

Dr. Johnson's answer when a lady pointed out an error in

5

his dictionary, and his answer was:

6

sheer stupidity."

7

(Laughter.)

8

MR. FRIED:

11

"Stupidity, madam,

I think -- I think, Your Honor,

that -- that Kan Pacific disputes very little of -- of
our central argument.

Their discussion of --

JUSTICE BREYER:

There are -- there are lots

12

of regions of the country -- Puerto Rico, for example --

14

15

19

it paid by the winner.

That's

That's been the common practice.

I don't

21

think that's a foolish approach.

22

language in this, which is to go back -- go back to

23

Justice Sotomayor.

24
25

MR. FRIED:

And you can find

Well, Your Honor, I think

that -- again, the best reason to reject that view is
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

because it doesn't make a coherent whole of the statute.

2

These provisions operate together in a uniform set of --

3

as a uniform set of policies for addressing a common

4

subject.

5

And the way they -- these provisions

6

interact in broad strokes that make perfect sense on our

7

reading is that in the -- in the primary class of cases

8

that motivated the passage of this statute, namely cases

9

brought by the government where there were significant

10

constitutional Confrontation Clause concerns about

11

criminal defendants not understanding the spoken

12

proceedings, in those core class of cases the Congress

13

elected to pay for spoken interpreter services directly

14

in the first instance.

15

Now, in the non-core class of cases, private

16

civil litigation, the Congress elected not to pay for

17

these services but in 1920(6) to facilitate them in the

18

lesser manner of providing that a party that incurred

19

these expenses could recover them at the end of the

20

case if it wins.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

What do you think of the --

22

I mean, the First Circuit went into this, which deals a

23

lot with Puerto Rico, and it felt that this fell within

24

the idea of fees for exemplification, which is

25

certifying a document.

And, in fact, to certify a
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

document that comes into the Federal court in San Juan,

2

you have to have it translated very often.

3

translation cost is at least consistent with the idea

4

there of trying to -- well, you may -- you don't have

5

to -- you may impose the cost on the loser.

6

MR. FRIED:

And so, the

Well, Justice Breyer, there was

7

actually a specific provision in this bill -- in a prior

8

version of this bill that addressed the context of

9

Puerto Rico.

And the significance of that provision is

10

that when the Congress was addressing written

11

translation, which was part of the -- part of that

12

provision, it specifically used the word "translation"

13

to refer to that.

14

And this just, again, confirms that the --

15

that the usual congressional practice of differentiating

16

between these terms in -- in statutes generally was

17

fully applicable here, that the Congress knew the

18

difference between these terms, used them appropriately.

19

And the fact that having removed that -- that provision

20

from the statute, the statute as passed contains only

21

the words "interpreter" and "interpretation," and no

22

forms of "translate," just again reaffirms that -- that

23

the ordinary meaning of these terms should apply.

24

And --

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What of the document

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that's -- that's read out in open court and it's a

2

document, a contract, in another language, and the

3

interpreter -- the witness presents the document, and

4

the interpreter interprets it?

5

MR. FRIED:

Your Honor, the professional

6

literature addresses this as sight interpretation or

7

sight translation, and it's uniformly recognized to be a

8

species of interpretation.

9

interpreter speaks aloud in the presence of the audience

It occurs -- the -- the

10

being communicated to in the course of a spoken

11

proceeding.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, what if the -- if

13

the interpreter, being diligent, said I'm going to

14

have to translate this document in open court, I'd like

15

to have it in advance so I can be sure that my

16

translation is going to be accurate?

17

the interpreter looks at the document and, in -- in

18

preparation for the trial, translates it.

19

MR. FRIED:

So that in fact

Well, Your Honor, I think that

20

the -- the preparatory work that occurred outside of

21

court would not be compensable interpretation work.

22

when the -- when the interpreter returned to court and

23

gave the oral interpretation of that document, that

24

would constitute interpretation.

25

But

But --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Well, that -- but

1

she's not interpreting it.

5

MR. FRIED:

She's already got the thing
But,

That's true, Mr. Chief Justice,

6

but the key reason why that would constitute

7

interpretation is because the -- the interpreter is

speaking aloud, communicating in the course of a spoken

conversation to an audience who -- who doesn't speak

English or who --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I thought it was a

situation where you've got a -- a document in -- in,

it -- I don't want to prejudge the issue -- and -- and

point, is it?

22

MR. FRIED:

That's not interpretation at any

Well, Your Honor, I think that

25

interpretation.

I mean, any sight interpretation occurs as a

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, is it true that as a

5

matter of common usage, when we are talking about oral

6

testimony in court, we often use "interpretation" and

7

"translation" or "interpreter" and "translator" somewhat

8

interchangeably, but when we're talking about rendering

9

a document into -- into a different language, we

10

generally talk about that as "translation"?

MR. FRIED:

This is a

Do you think that's correct?
If I understand Your Honor

correctly, yes.

"translate" applies to the context of -- of the

communication of information in written documents.

it's discrete from "interpretation," which -- which is

17

limited to the spoken --

point.

22

MR. FRIED:

I'm sorry.

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

My point was that I think

24

we say -- in fact, in a Supreme Court case, we've said

25

in the Hernandez case, when we're talking about oral
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

testimony in court, we tend to use "translator" or

2

"translate" and "interpreter" or "interpret" somewhat

3

interchangeably.

4

Is that correct?

MR. FRIED:

Oh, I apologize, Your Honor.

5

Yes, there -- you can use the word "translate"

6

generically.

7

and I think out of court as well, that some people can

8

use the word "translate" in a manner that doesn't

9

differentiate between modes.

There's no question.

Frequently in court,

Our point is that that --

10

that double meaning doesn't apply to "interpreter,"

11

which has a single narrow meaning limited to spoken

12

communication.

13

And Kan Pacific's discussion of the

14

dictionaries is limited to a single dictionary,

15

Webster's Third.

16

categorically exclude document translation from the

17

scope of --

18

The majority of dictionaries

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Webster's Third, as I

19

recall, is the dictionary that defines "imply" to mean

20

"infer" --

21

MR. FRIED:

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- and "infer" to mean

"imply."

It's not a very good dictionary.

2

MR. FRIED:

Well, the Court in the MCI -- in

the MCI v. AT&T case did indicate that.

3

But in any event, the -- on its terms, that

4

definition supports our reading over Kan Pacific's

5

because it does indicate, even as to that dictionary

6

definition, that the -- that the most common meaning of

7

the term is the meaning referring to spoken

communication.

And this Court frequently looks to the

10

interpretation, as it did in Mallard in construing the

11

word "request," and in Ramsey in construing the word

12

"envelope."

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could we get back to the

14

issue?

15

there any indication that Congress explicitly rejected

16

translation work from its coverage?

Those are the other

provisions that they passed with respect to --

MR. FRIED:

Well, specifically with respect

7

to costs, the Congress -- the House Report alludes to

8

Rule 43(f), which is now 43(d), as a relevant

9

pre-existing rule.

And, of course, it's undisputed that

10

Rule 43(d)'s cost provision is -- is limited to spoken

11

communication of interpreters.

history as well.

So, there is that in the

14

the -- under the text of the statute, subsection (k),

15

the modes subsection, which appears at page 5a of the

16

red brief appendix, as it was initially passed,

17

expressly says that the interpretation under -- under

18

this section must be done using methods that all

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAN HIMMELFARB

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

MR. HIMMELFARB:

Thank you,

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
The word "interpreter" has two possible

meanings that are relevant here, a broader one and a

narrower one.

Does it ever say "John Smith," comma, "Int.," period?

22

MR. HIMMELFARB:

It's used in the narrower

23

sense in that context, I think, Justice Scalia.

24

narrower meaning of "interpreter" is member of a

25

profession that specializes in oral translation; and in

1

that narrower sense, an interpreter is distinct from a

2

translator, which is the sense you've just identified,

3

which is a person who specializes in written

4

translation.

5

Our submission is that, as the great

6

majority of courts who've expressed a view on this

7

question have recognized, the broader definition makes

8

more -- more sense in the particular context at issue

9

here.

And we say that for a number of reasons.
The first is that the basic purpose of

10
11

translation in the litigation context is to make

12

evidence intelligible to the parties and the court.

13

Section 1920 reflects a congressional judgment that the

14

cost of making evidence intelligible to the parties and

15

the court can be borne by the losing party.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, it doesn't.

reflects that judgment only if you're right that

6

concerned, as distinct from attorney's fees, the

7

background principle actually goes the other way.

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, the background -- costs get

taxed, but costs are very narrow.

They are a very small

10

part of the expenses of a party litigating a case.

11

Isn't that -- isn't that true?

12

I

MR. HIMMELFARB:

I think ordinarily that's

13

true, but I don't think that it follows -- it follows in

14

any way that there is some sort of tie-breaking

15

interpretive canon that says when you're interpreting

16

the costs statute, some version of which has been in

effect since the middle of the 19th century, if you're

of narrowness rather than breadth.

people as an authoritative dictionary of English

broad definition that we advocate here.

MR. HIMMELFARB:

Well, typically the

15

criteria for -- I should add that the criteria for

16

taxing costs of every sort, not just interpreter costs

17

and not just document translation costs, are essentially

18

thought to be necessity and reasonableness.

19

connection with document translation costs, the Fifth

20

Circuit has suggested that the way to tax them, the

21

appropriate way to tax them, might be just to tax the

22

cost of translating headings of foreign language

23

documents, which should be sufficient to let the lawyer

24

know whether this is a relevant document that might bear

25

further translation, and then only the documents that

exercised.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So,

Mr. Himmelfarb, in

6

section 1920, there are two provisions that specify

7

costs necessarily obtained for use in the case.

8

interpreter provision doesn't have that qualification,

9

doesn't say "necessarily obtained for use in the case."

That's -- that's true.

For -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You are asking to read

13

"interpreter" to mean "translator" as well and to import

14

into sub (6) "necessary for use in the case."

15

MR. HIMMELFARB:

The necessity limitation in

16

subsection (6), as with other subsections that don't

17

specifically use the word "necessarily," come not from

18

that term, but rather from the word "may" in the first

19

sentence of the provision, which in tandem with Rule 54

20

of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, essentially

21

make this a discretionary call for the district court.

22

Necessity has long been recognized as one of the

23

components of that discretionary determination.

24
25

The reason we say it doesn't make sense to
have the narrower definition of "interpreter" be the one

that Congress enacted is that written document

JUSTICE BREYER:

What do you think on the --

6

I guess nobody wants to defend this argument, including

7

you, but the First Circuit and several others did look

8

to the provision which permits the taxing of costs for

9

the making of -- it says exemplifications or official

10

documents, for the costs of making copies of any

11

materials obtained for use in the case.

Now, if you're going to make a copy for use

Before 1978, some of the courts that taxed document

22

translation costs, I believe, also relied on their

inherent authority, which at the time was thought to be

a permissible ground for taxing costs.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It seems to us that in

So, in every other case in

8

which the U.S. Code uses the word, "interpreters" means

9

only oral translators, and that's the obvious way to use

10

the word, but in this case, we're supposed to reach a

11

different conclusion.

12

MR. HIMMELFARB:

Justice Kagan, I would say

13

this:

In every other provision of the United States

14

Code in which the "interpreter" -- the word

15

"interpreter" is used, either it's not clear whether it

16

includes document translation or the context is such

17

that it strongly indicates that it's limited to oral

18

translation.

19

here, in our view.

"interpreter" means "translator"?

MR. HIMMELFARB:

There -- there is none

where it is clear that it covers document translation.

7

There are -- there are State statutes which we've cited

8

which use the term "interpreter" to -- to clearly cover

9

document translation, and we cite them in our brief.

10

JUSTICE ALITO:

Suppose somebody did a

11

computer search in a database of, let's say, newspaper

12

articles, magazine articles for use of the term

13

"interpreter" in relationship to a foreign language.

14

And let's say you look at a thousand hits.

15

How many of those do you think would use the

16

term "interpreter" to refer to rendering a written

17

document from one language to another?

18

MR. HIMMELFARB:

I think it -- I would not

19

be at all surprised if it was more than 50 percent of

20

the hits that used it in its narrower sense.

Alito to go do this now.

see any basis in the statute or, frankly, in the

practice of translators or interpreters for drawing that

line in that particular place.

16

And as far as the question where Taniguchi

That, it seems to us, is a very good reason

for adopting the broader interpretation.

unlikely that Congress would want courts to get into

these extremely complicated and, frankly, unprincipled

line-drawing exercises.

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It seems very

I don't know,

7

Mr. Himmelfarb.

8

different from any case in which we draw a line and we

9

find that the result of drawing a line is that we've

10

I mean, why is this any -- any

created some close cases, cases that are near the line.

11

So, you know, just to give you an obvious

example, the fact that there are some few minutes in

cases.

And that seems to me

Yes, you can think up some

MR. HIMMELFARB:

Well, I think -- I think

20

line drawing is sometimes a necessary exercise because

21

the text of the statute compels you to do it.

22

submission is that the text of this statute doesn't

compel it, because you've got a readily available

alternative interpretation which doesn't require any

narrowing of the word "interpreter."

JUSTICE BREYER:

But as far as I'm

I accept -- I accept the

15

following, that there was a history basically giving --

16

doing what you want before the statute, but the

17

statute -- nobody thought what it was going to do that

18

history.

19

but it isn't the most natural thing.

20

That statute is capable of being translated,

21

with the smaller capability, saying leave -- leave well

22

enough alone, or do we say, gee, that's just too hard to

23

translate it that -- to interpret the statute that way?

24
25

Have you got any other example in the law?
I mean, can you think of an example in the law which
44
Alderson Reporting Company

1

I've been trying to think of where there was a history

2

of doing something?

3

a little tougher for the judges to do it, and then the

4

5

sleeping dogs lie.

6

A statute comes along that makes it

MR. HIMMELFARB:

Well, I think -- I mean, I

7

think it's an important point.

And this goes to the

8

question of, you know, whether it's difficult for

9

district courts to make a determination of whether a

10

particular document translation should be taxed, which

11

is one of the arguments on the other side.

12

history of this is strong evidence that it's not

13

difficult.

14

I think the

Courts have been doing this, certainly,

15

since 1978 when this provision was added and even before

16

then.

17

deciding whether to tax documents in its document

18

translation, and if so, how much.

19

the history certainly bears on the case in that respect.

And they haven't had any evident difficulty in

20

A word --

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So, I think the --

Justice Breyer is

22

asking, can you think of an example where words are not

23

on their face plain, and the Court has looked to the

24

practices that have been imbued into that word and said

25

-- and we've decided that they will be accepted in the
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

way that practice has given them meaning?

2

MR. HIMMELFARB:

I can't think of any case

3

off the top of my head, and I think it's true that this

4

case is a little bit different because, insofar as

5

courts were taxing document translation costs before

6

1978, they were relying on something other than the word

7

"interpreter."

8

Congress chose to use the word "interpreter," it was

9

necessarily incorporating what courts had previously

10

So, it may be a stretch to say that when

done.

11

But I don't think it's entirely irrelevant

12

that this has been done for a long time, and I think

13

it's not unfair to presume that Congress would have been

14

aware of that.
The Court Interpreters Act has two main

15
16

provisions as relevant here.

There's section 2, which

17

is really the more -- the main provision, and then

18

section 7, which became 1920(6) in Title 28, which is

19

the provision at issue here.
An important part of Taniguchi's submission

20
21

is that section 2 is limited to oral translators, and,

22

therefore, it should follow that section 7, the

23

provision at issue here, is likewise limited to oral

24

translators.

25

And our main submission on that -- on that
46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

question is that Congress actually used different

2

language in section 2 and section 7.

3

two provisions to Title 28:

4

1828, which are titled, and which address, respectively,

5

"Interpreters in courts of the United States" and

6

"Special interpretation services."

7

Section 2 added

section 1827 and section

In section 7, which added subsection (6) to

8

1920, Congress does not use those two phrases.

9

it uses the phrase "interpreters" simply, not

Instead,

10

"interpreters in courts of the United States," and then

11

"special interpretation services."

12

So, to the extent that there is any

13

appropriate canon about the use of similar or different

14

language in different provisions of a statute, it seems

15

to us that the appropriate canon is that one should

16

presume that when Congress uses different language, it

17

intends different meanings.

18

I do want to respond to Mr. Fried's point

19

about the number of times the word "interpreter" is used

20

in section 2.

21

it's that it's much more frequently used by itself than

22

it is with the -- with the words "in courts of the

23

United States."

24
25

And as I understand his point, is that --

What the statute actually does is add -- say
that it's adding section 1827, which it calls
47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

"Interpreters in courts of the United States."

2

has a subsection that says that the Administrative

3

Office of the United States Courts has to establish a

4

program to facilitate the use of interpreters in courts

5

of the United States.

MR. HIMMELFARB:

I'm sorry.

This is the red

brief, 1a of the appendix, which is the very beginning

10

of the Court Interpreters Act.

11

subsection (c), flipping over to the next page -- I'm

12

sorry -- subsection (b), which says that the director

13

has to certify interpreters in courts of the United

14

States.

15

And then there's

So, what it does at the beginning of the

16

statute is establish this thing called a certified

17

interpreter in courts of the United States.

18

thereafter speaks of "interpreter" simply, that's just a

19

shorthand for a certified interpreter in courts of the

20

United States.

21

Court Interpreters Act is concerned, even if it's true

22

that section 2 uses the term in the narrower sense, it

23

doesn't necessarily follow that it's used in the

24

narrower sense in section 7.

25

When it

So, it seems to us that as far as the

And the only point I would add about that,
48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

as we set -- point out in our brief, it's really not

2

clear that section 2 is limited to oral translators.

3

Soon after the Court Interpreters Act was

4

enacted and for approximately 16 years thereafter, the

5

Administrative Office would publish these notices in the

6

Federal Register notifying the public that there were

7

going to be certification exams for interpreters under

8

section 2 of the Court Interpreters Act.

9

pretty streamlined notices, not long at all.

10

These were

And one of the main aspects, the main

11

sections, of the notice, was a list of what the director

12

of the Administrative Office said were the -- were the

13

duties of interpreters in courts of the United States.

14

And to be sure, it listed simultaneous and consecutive

15

interpreting, but it -- it listed sight translation, and

16

it listed document translation.

17

So, at a minimum, section 2 is not

18

sufficiently clearly limited to oral translators, that

19

the director of the Administrative Office couldn't issue

20

these notices saying otherwise.

21

I guess the -- the last point I would -- I

22

want to make about other statutes, some of which use the

23

term "interpreter" and "translator" together, I've

24

already addressed that in part by saying that in many of

25

those statutes, it really is pretty clearly used in the
49
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

narrower sense because you're talking about members of a

2

profession.

3

The -- the only other thing I would say

4

about that is that the premise of Taniguchi's reliance

5

on those statutes seems to be that it would be strangely

6

redundant for Congress to speak in other statutes about

7

interpreters and translators together, if, in fact, the

8

two terms could be used interchangeably, and that

9

redundancy should be avoided.
But subsection (6) of 1920 itself has a

10
11

redundancy in it because it covers both interpreters and

12

special interpretation services.

13

anybody could dispute that anyone who carries out a

14

special interpretation service is an interpreter.
So, it's not at all odd to have redundancy

15
16

And I don't think

when Congress is addressing the subject of translation.

MR. FRIED:

Very briefly, Your Honor, three

points.
In the first place, Justice Breyer, I just

24

wanted to let you know that the first decision -- the

25

first appellate decision construing 1920(6) to encompass
50
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

document translation was the D.C. Circuit's decision in

2

Quy in 1981.

3

Second, Mr. Himmelfarb noted that Black's

4

Law Dictionary takes a definition that arguably could

5

encompass document translation, but he didn't mention

6

that the -- that the operative version of Black's in

7

1978 when this statute was passed did not -- was a

8

different definition that excluded document translation.

9

And this change in the definition occurred

10

in 1999, in the seventh edition, after a number of these

11

judicial decisions construing 1920(6) had already come

12

down, which supports Your Honor's observation that it

13

could very well merely reflect a recognition of these

14

decisions, rather than independent support for them.
Finally, Your Honors, Mr. Himmelfarb cited

15
16

certain notices issued by the Administrative Office from

17

many years ago.

18

documents that simply announced a forthcoming

19

examination.
