ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK C. FLEMING

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FLEMING:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In Hernandez-Casillas, the Attorney General

11

confirmed that a lawful permanent resident subject to

12

deportation, quote, "must have the same opportunity to

13

seek discretionary relief as an alien who has

14

temporarily left this country and upon reentry been

15

subject to exclusion."

16

Two months later in its published decision

17

in Matter of Meza, the BIA again confirmed that an

18

immigrant deportable for an aggravated felony could seek

19

relief because his conviction could also form the basis

20

for excludability.

21

indistinguishable from Mr. Judulang's applied for and

22

received relief under this rule.

4

MR. FLEMING:

What would

Obviously, Justice Kagan, we

5

don't think that is the proper way to understand Blake.

6

But to answer the question, for purposes of the

7

retroactivity analysis, the Court uses what the Court in

8

St. Cyr called "considerations of fair notice,

9

reasonable reliance, and settled expectations."

And we

10

would submit that reliance was more than reasonable and

11

expectations more than settled as to how the board was

12

addressing crime of violence aggravated felony

13

convictions prior to Blake, as is shown by the evidence

14

that I cited a minute ago, namely the position that the

15

government itself was taking in these cases and the way

16

that immigrants would have been advised by both criminal

17

defense counsel and immigration counsel, including, for

18

that matter, INS trial counsel.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, reliance on confused

20

law is certainly not reasonable reliance.

21

you accept the -- the premise that Justice Kagan

22

operates from, how can you say that -- that you're

That's a different point.

But even if -- even if there

5

was some lack of clarity in the law, and we don't think

6

there was, I think the record in this -- before the

7

Court is very clear, that people were advised by

8

competent counsel and that the government itself took

9

the same position in front of the immigration courts and

10

the courts of appeals that someone with a crime of

11

violence aggravated felony conviction could seek relief

12

because that conviction would make him or her

excludable.

deportation proceedings is meant to be the same as it

would be in exclusion proceedings.

an excludable offense, one that would be waivable in

you can -- that you can get at it.

20

But, certainly, you can

But that is not this category of people.

21

The category of people at issue here are people who pled

22

before 1996 to aggravated felony crimes of violence,

23

almost all of which, if not all of which, are going to

24

be crimes involving moral turpitude that are excludable

they have the right to ask the Attorney General to

The remaining question for purposes of the

agency's interest in applying the rule retroactively.

14

I'd submit that that interest here is no stronger than

15

it is in the ordinary mine run of cases, and in fact it

is weaker, because all that we are talking about is the

23

MR. FLEMING:

I think, Justice Kennedy,

25

indicated its understanding of the -- of the way that
18

this is a -- a question for the Government, because the

3

agency has never suggested that there was any basis for

4

retreating from that position at this late date.

5

And, honestly, I think

Unless the Court has further questions on

6

retroactivity, I would move quickly to our substantive

7

position, which is that even without regard to

8

retroactivity, the Blake rule is arbitrary and

9

capricious.

And there are two basic reasons for that:

10

First, that it rests on improper factors; and, second,

11

that it leads to results that the BIA itself has

12

disavowed.

13

First of all, Congress has never suggested

14

that the words that it chooses in deportation provisions

15

are somehow a key to eligibility for section 212(c)

relief.

That's true.

But when the Court -- when the

I agree that if there's a perfect linguistic
match, then you might not need to go to look at the

conviction, because someone who falls under one will

11

necessarily fall under the other.

12

Congress uses different words in the deportation

13

subsection that's asserted against a particular alien

doesn't mean that the analysis stops there, because the

15

conviction might well make the person excludable such

MR. GANNON:

That's true.

It's also true in

the firearms offense cases and the visa fraud offense

14

depending on the circumstance of the offense and

Pardon?
These categories.

No, there -- there are no cases

that address that principle in the context where there
38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

is no comparable ground.

2

one point about this claim of Petitioner's in his reply

3

brief, that he could have been subject to a charge of

4

deportability on the basis of a crime involving moral

5

turpitude, I would caution the Court against relying on

6

that for two reasons, one factual and one legal.

7

And if -- if I could just make

One is that there's no factual basis in the

8

administrative record to -- to talk about this 1987 trip

9

to the Philippines.

We do have evidence from outside

10

the record that makes us believe that it occurred, but

11

the statute that provides for judicial review here of

12

the order of removability in 8 U.S.C. 1252(b)(4)(A)

13

specifically says that the determination needs to be

14

made on the basis of the administrative record.

15

only evidence in the record about that trip is actually

16

a statement from Petitioner's mother that says that it

17

occurred in 1989, the year after the crime.

18

And the

But even assuming that -- that the trip

19

happened, in light -- as I said, we do believe on the

20

basis of evidence outside the record that it did occur

21

-- there's a legal reason why I would caution the Court

22

against assuming that that means the Petitioner could

23

have been deportable for a crime involving moral

24

turpitude, and that's the so-called Fleuti doctrine.

25

Under this Court's 1963 decision in Rosenberg v. Fleuti,

which is actually relevant to a case on which you

2

granted certiorari a couple of weeks ago, this Court

3

concluded that if an LPR takes a brief, casual, and

4

innocent trip outside the country and returns to the

5

United States, that will not trigger an entry upon his

6

return to the United States.

7

And so, I think it's very likely that under

8

Ninth Circuit precedent, in 1989 when Petitioner was

9

pleading guilty to his voluntary manslaughter charge, he

10

wouldn't have had any reason to think that he was doing

11

so within 5 years of when he committed -- when he

entered the country for purposes of the statute.

I see your point,

12

Justice Breyer, and if you look at all of the cases that

13

predate the era that we're talking about here, they all

14

-- almost all involve two categories of offenses, drug

15

trafficking or controlled substance offenses and crimes

16

involving moral turpitude, things that were actually

17

charged under the ground of deportation for crimes

18

involving moral turpitude.

19

And here, Congress added aggravated felonies

20

to the deportation side of the ledger but didn't add it

21

to the exclusion side of the ledger.

22

repeatedly expanded the definition of "aggravated

23

felony" between 1988 and 1996 in ways that made these

24

offenses treatable in different ways for purposes of

deportation than they were for exclusion.

you're looking at.

MR. GANNON:
Sotomayor.

That's -- I disagree, Justice

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

If it qualifies as an

aggravated violent felon, it cannot be a crime of moral

11

turpitude.

MR. GANNON:

I disagree with that -- the

fact that that's the category we're looking at.
We're looking inside the definition of

15

aggravated felony, to the particular ground which is

16

crimes of violence.

17

the analysis needs to be done at a categorical level.

18

And the board has said that you cannot get a 212(c)

19

waiver from a ground of deportability unless that ground

20

of deportability is substantially equivalent to a

21

waivable ground of exclusion.

22

And then what we are saying is that

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Let's go back to a

23

concrete example following Justice Ginsburg's example.

24

Someone is charged with a crime of violence, voluntary

25

manslaughter.

12

MR. GANNON:

13

And -- and -­
And so, really the issue

14

that we have at the moment is whether your decision to

15

effect what has happened now in the past, to do what

16

Congress has done moving forward, and to avoid St. Cyr,

17

is just to say, if it's an aggravated crime of violence,

18

it just doesn't qualify anymore.

19
20
21

That's what you are doing.

You're not

giving 212(c) to anybody anymore.
MR. GANNON:

22

like this, aliens who -- who have older convictions,

if they're aggravated -- if they've committed an

anymore.

MR. GANNON:

goes away once all the St. Cyr people have.

And I -- but -- but

12

I do want to stress that this -- I think Justice Kagan

13

was correct to point out that this was clarifying a

14

previous state of the law.

very clear principles in the cases that are cited on

looks at the decisions in the appendix to the petition

17

for certiorari, specifically at page 11a, it's clear

18

that his conviction is asserted not only as an

19

aggravated felony crime of violence, but also as a crime

20

involving moral turpitude, and the immigration judge

21

found that he was in fact deportable with that

22

conviction forming a crime involving moral turpitude.

23

In fact, he was.

On

1

deportability at the time of the plea, Mr. Gannon is

2

correct; there's nothing in the administrative record

3

that says that, and that is why this Court typically

4

does not countenance arguments based on the facts by the

5

respondents that are raised only in the brief on the

6

merits.

7

on which a factual record needed to be developed, we

8

could have done it; it would not have been hard.

If anyone had suggested that this was an issue

9

I also want to comment on one point that Mr.

10

Gannon made, which is that the thing that -- that is

11

waived under 212(c) is a ground of deportation.

12

not correct.

is how the regulations and the decisions have always

sense.

That is the

2

subsection based on that same conviction.

3

I thought it was telling, Justice Breyer, in

4

reaction to your question which -- which was seeking an

5

explanation of how this scheme is reasonable, the answer

6

that counsel for the Government gave was that the BIA

7

has been consistent with firearms and visa fraud cases,

8

but there was no explanation as to how the Blake rule as

9

it is now drawn is in any way a reasonable application

10

of the law.

11

Honor pointed out, which is that we have a number of -­

12

whether one calls them convictions or whether one calls

13

them categories of crimes -- voluntary manslaughter,

14

aggravated burglary -- recall that we're talking about

15

aggravated felony crimes of violence.

16

I would submit for the reasons that Your

I recognize that if we talk about

17

third-degree burglary, which could be charged on the

18

basis of someone opening an unlocked door and walking

19

across the threshold, maybe that's not a crime involving

20

moral turpitude, but it is probably not an aggravated

21

felony crime of violence either, certainly not in this

22

Court's decision in Leocal.

23

So, I would submit that the Government has

24

not identified a crime that would be both an aggravated

25

felony crime of violence and yet not a crime involving
56
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

moral turpitude.

The overlap is, I would submit, total.

2

And even if it's not total, that is not the end of our

3

argument because the board itself has said you, don't

4

need a perfect match; you just need substantial overlap.

5

And the overlap is at the very least substantial, if not

6

complete.

7

The crime that was charged in Brieva-Perez

8

itself, unauthorized use of a vehicle under Texas law,

9

has subsequently been held by the Fifth Circuit not to

10

be an aggravated felony at all.

11

own terms is no longer good law, as we point out in our

12

reply brief.

13

So, Brieva-Perez on its

The interest that Mr. Gannon asserted at one

14

point about getting immigrants to put themselves into

15

exclusion proceedings -- this is a very important point.

16

The agency has never suggested that that is the way that

17

it runs the railroad.

18

said the opposite.

On the contrary, it has expressly

19

It does not matter whether the 212(c)

20

application is filed in exclusion proceedings, in

21

deportation proceedings, or outside of proceedings

22

entirely by sending a letter to the district director

23

saying:

24

travel abroad.

25

Please give me an advance waiver before I

The regulations make very clear and the
57
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

decisions make very clear -- I quoted Matter of A-A- in

2

my opening argument -- that an application is identical

3

and the relief that is given is identical, regardless of

4

the proceedings.

5

For Mr. Gannon to stand up and say that the

6

agency is now creating a sharp distinction, saying that

7

applications filed in exclusion are omnipotent, and

8

applications filed in deportation proceedings are

9

meaningless is a clear change in the law, and it is

10

unfair to apply it against immigrants like Mr. Judulang

11

and others who relied on the availability of section

12

212(c) as protection from removal, whether exclusion or

13

deportation in the future, when they pled guilty.

14

Justice Sotomayor, your question about how

15

many people are involved here, it is difficult to

16

identify specific numbers because very often these cases

17

are decided at the immigration judge level that are not

18

reported.

19

certiorari, we identified over 160 people who have been

subject -- who have suffered under the Blake rule since

21

Blake was decided in 2005.

In the appendix to our petition for

And part of the problem is that we are

23

talking about a group of people who have been in the

24

who are law-abiding, who are reformed, and may only come

and there might be other forms of relief, as Mr. Gannon

10

mentioned.

11

number of the people here who have been harmed by the

12

Blake rule are people who are the most deserving

13

candidates for relief.

14

sets that out I think quite convincingly.

15

But -- that's certainly right.

Now -­

And the NIJC brief, I think,

We would submit that the only reasonable

16

approach here is the one that the agency took for years

17

under Meza and under the eight decisions that Justice

18

Breyer referenced, where the immigration judges knew the

19

rule, they applied it, they looked to the conviction,

20

they figured out whether the conviction would trigger

21

excludability; if it did, then the alien was entitled to

22

apply on the same basis and with the same effect as if

23

he had found himself in exclusion proceedings.
