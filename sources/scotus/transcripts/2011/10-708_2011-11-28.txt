ORAL ARGUMENT OF AARON M. PANNER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. PANNER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

Article III requires a private plaintiff to

12

show injury-in-fact, which means at a minimum that the

13

alleged illegal conduct made her worse off.

14

injury does not automatically follow from violation of a

15

statutory duty owed to the plaintiff, and Ms. Edwards

16

has not alleged the type of harm alleged by plaintiffs

17

in the common law cases that she invokes:

18

misappropriation of her property, no loss of desired

19

opportunity or benefit, no injury to reputation.

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

Factual

MR. PANNER:

Yes, Your Honor.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

And anyone who gets such a

3

phone call gets $500 in damages automatically if they

4

sue in court if they receive such a call.

5

The harm was getting the call.

So, my

6

grandmother, who is always complaining no one ever calls

7

her, loved the telephone call.

8

thing happened to her in a month.

9
10

She loved it.

Best

Okay?

Now, can she sue?
MR. PANNER:

No, Your Honor.

If she does

11

not have actual injury, the fact of the statutory

12

violation would not give rise to standing in that case.

13

Now, it's -- I think it would be quite unlikely that a

14

plaintiff would come before the court and say:

15

Actually, the statutory violation delighted me; I

16

nevertheless would like my $500.

17

But if the injury-in-fact requirement means

18

anything, it means that a plaintiff who comes before the

19

court must have a harm in fact.

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

So, in other words, if the

21

FDA bans a substance on the ground that 98 percent of

22

the people it hurts, and there's some kind of automatic

23

recovery, $500, anybody who bought the substance because

exposed to a substance that has -- that is illegal, they

exposure ended up not being harmful, would that be a

MR. PANNER:

I don't think so, Your Honor.

back what the defendant should not have received.
MR. PANNER:

Your Honor, with respect to

12

unjust enrichment cases, those cases reflect

13

circumstances where there's a benefit received at the

14

expense of the plaintiff.

15

sorts of cases -- unjust enrichment, of course, is an

16

invention as a category that's relatively recent.

17

the unjust enrichment cases reflect quasi-contract

18

circumstances where a benefit was conferred that in

19

justice should have been compensated; so, the plaintiff

20

is made worse off in not receiving the benefit -- or the

21

compensation for the benefit; or a circumstance of

22

constructive trust where there was property or other

23

right of the plaintiff that was misappropriated and used

24

without the permission of the plaintiff; so, an

25

opportunity or a property was taken away.

And in -- in the traditional

6
Alderson Reporting Company

But

Official

1

This is not a case like that, and there's no

2

allegation that there is anything lacking in the

3

insurance that was issued.

4

which Congress may believe that a certain practice as a

5

general matter can tend to bring out -- bring about

6

bad -- bad outcomes and can therefore make it unlawful.

7

But the question here is whether this plaintiff has a

8

harm --

9

This is a circumstance in

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, are you taking

10

the very broad position that this is an unusual State,

11

as appears to be in three or four others where the

12

States mandate that title insurance be at a fixed price?

13

But in those States in which there is no such mandate,

14

you seem to be arguing that Congress can't ever presume

15

damages or injury, that even in those cases, the

16

plaintiff has to come in and prove that they would have

17

paid less.

18

Is that the position you're taking?

19

MR. PANNER:

I -- no, Your Honor.

The type

20

of injury that is incurred doesn't necessarily have to

21

be a financial one, and there could be circumstances

22

where a plaintiff would allege an injury.

23

important to --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- what does the

4

plaintiff have to do other than to say I -- they didn't

5

disclose to me that there was a kickback, and I want the

6

amount I paid for the service?

7

Do they have to show something more?

8

MR. PANNER:

9

If the -- I want to -- I'm not

sure I understand Your Honor's question, but if the

10

question is there were various rates available and the

11

plaintiff alleges an overcharge, that they purchased

12

a -- a policy and there was a cheaper policy available,

13

and as a result of the violation --

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So, you are in fact

15

arguing very broadly that there is no presumption of --

16

of injury in these cases, that the plaintiff still has

17

to come in and prove --

18

MR. PANNER:

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

20
21

Your Honor --- that in fact they

would have gotten a cheaper -- a cheaper policy?

damages and statutory damages?

3

MR. PANNER:

You're -- you're taking

I don't think so, Your Honor,

4

because, again, the question for purposes of standing,

5

the question for purposes of the ability of a plaintiff

6

to come into court, is to show that they have some

7

injury-in-fact, that there is some harm, some way in

8

which they were made worse off.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

This plaintiff --

That's not so

10

extraordinary.

11

Sherman Act cases, right?

12

in -- in restraint of trade are unlawful; but in order

13

to recover under the Sherman Act, you have to show not

14

only that it was unlawful, but that you were harmed by

15

it.

18

It's what has to be shown in -- in

MR. PANNER:

Contracts and combinations

That's true.

That's certainly

the norm in all sort of tort -- tort cases.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I was going to ask you,

19

along that line, are there antitrust cases that -- that

20

Respondents or the Government could cite in which a

21

party can go into court alleging that the market has

22

been distorted, even though that person has no damage?

23

Anything like that in the antitrust -- what would be

24

their closest case?

25

MR. PANNER:

Well, Your Honor, I'm not

sure -- I did not see any of the cases that they cited

2

involving the trust -- the trust circumstance --

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MR. PANNER:

Yes.

-- where there was that sort of

5

vague allegation.

The trust cases I think actually are

6

a good illustration of the type of injury that's

7

required.

We're talking about trust, not antitrust now.

8

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

9

MR. PANNER:

Right.

But the trust cases involve a

10

circumstance, the -- I think that the plaintiff here

1

the --

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

4

Well, but -But, Mr. Panner, I

thought --

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- let's assume that a

6

trustee acts on its own interest and sells property, but

7

let's assume that he gets top dollar for that property,

8

so that the beneficiary hasn't really been deprived of

9

anything.

10

What's the injury to the beneficiary?
MR. PANNER:

Well, the injury to the

11

beneficiary in that circumstance, Your Honor, is that

12

the trustee would have misappropriated an opportunity

13

that belonged to the beneficiary.

14

that are -- in the ordinary case, then, the beneficiary

15

has the option to say I'd like to unwind that or get the

16

benefit that the trustee got, if there was self-dealing.

17

But in a circumstance where a trustee sells, for

18

example, a piece of property and the -- and the claim is

19

one for restitution to try to unwind the transaction

20

that was done, it's the option of the beneficiary to

21

say:

22

would be better off if I could undo that transaction.

23

So, it's a very conventional kind of harm

24

where someone believes that their property was -- was

taken away from them and used in a way to their

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So, what more does this

3

plaintiff have to allege other than, if I had been told

4

that this was a prearranged, tied product between the

5

mortgage and the title company but that I had a right to

6

get an untied product even at the same price, and I

16

17

for a very particular purpose, which was that in order

18

to maintain this case as a class action, the basis of

19

harm could not be anything personal or individual to

20

this plaintiff.

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The point is that this

So, you go back to your

22

position that Congress has no power to give a cause of

don't the title companies charge other fees, title

14

search fees and so forth, other fees in addition to the

price of the insurance?

arguably -- I know she didn't allege any damage -- but

those other fees arguably are too high because of this

MR. PANNER:

You do, Your Honor.

That is to

23

say that in the case of any of the examples that the

24

plaintiff has cited there is an underlying interest, an

25

antecedent interest, a concrete interest in property or

agent, and it is that concrete interest which is invaded

by the -- by the alleged violation of the -- of the

But, of course, here you don't even have

that relationship of trust.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But this Court has frequently reflected the

And the point that I'm making -- and it should be the
21

same answer with respect to your question and

2

Justice Scalia's -- is if -- the mere fact of the

3

violation of a duty does not create injury per se, and

4

none of the cases reflect that.

5

proposition that plaintiff relies on here, precisely

6

because of what she alleged and what she is

7

attempting -- the type of case that she is attempting to

8

bring.

9

And that is the

She's attempting to bring a case in which

10

the statutory violation is the injury.

11

is required.

12

not matter if there's any economic harm, it does not

matter if there is any consequential effect on me at

But the key point is that there's a distinction between

what Congress -- the statutory duties that Congress can

have those enforced -- well --

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Suppose she -- suppose

6

she appended to her complaint an affidavit by a

7

well-respected economist that says Congress was right;

8

these kind of arrangements will have an adverse effect

9

on the people who are purchasing title insurance.

10

11

Would that be adequate then?

12

MR. PANNER:

And

Well, at the pleading stage, it

might be, Your Honor.

14

question were whether there was an allegation, certainly

15

it's possible that there could be a sufficiently

16

concrete allegation in a complaint that there was that

17

sort of an impact, but -- and this is critical -- not

18

only was that not alleged here, but the mere fact that

19

there's a statutory duty does not reflect that's the

20

judgment or, you know, the fact that there's been any

21

sort of systemic effect.

22

That is to say that if -- if the

Congress has broadly prohibited practices

Counsel, I'm still

Ginsburg's hypothetical, suppose the Congress works with

economists and concludes there is a reasonable

probability that if there were no kickbacks, there would

14

be a more competitive market, there would be lower

15

prices for some of the escrow fees, some of the

16

collateral fees in addition to the title insurance, and

17

the plaintiff then alleges that there is this reasonable

18

probability that there would be a more efficient market,

19

resulting in cost savings.

it's in all likelihood a generic allegation that there

had been -- that there was some sort of systemic effect

16

MR. LAMKEN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
For at least 280 years, the law has been

17

clear that when someone breaches a duty of loyalty owed

18

to you by taking a kickback or otherwise introducing a

19

conflict into a transaction, you can sue on the basis of

20

that alone, without showing a further harm in terms of

MR. LAMKEN:

a particular conflict of interest, and that is the

25

kickbacks that undermine their incentive to serve your

best interest, that undermine their incentive to choose

2

the insurer that provides the best quality and the best

3

service.

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, this is where I have

5

problems with your argument, because this doesn't seem

6

to me to be a fiduciary relationship, and I don't see

7

where the -- where the duty of loyalty comes from.

8

to say that Congress can just impose some attributes of

9

a fiduciary relationship wherever it wants seems rather

should I go to another place and have it fixed?

Congress is entitled to elevate your interest in

13

accepting it or expecting it in the first instance.

14

They can take that relationship and make it confidential

15

and make it an honest one, even if you hadn't expected

16

that in the first place.

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, the issue isn't

certainly can.

20

Now, which are

One, two or three?
MR. LAMKEN:

MR. LAMKEN:

But it also has --

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Can I -- I'm sorry

to interrupt you, and I want to pause on that question.

21

You said violation of a statute is injury-in-fact.

22

would have thought that would be called injury-in-law.

23

And when we say, as all our standing cases have, is that

24

what is required is injury-in-fact, I understand that to

be in contradistinction to injury-in-law.
32
Alderson Reporting Company

I

And when you

Official

1

tell me all that you've got or all that you want to

plead is violation of the statute, that doesn't sound

like injury-in-fact.

4

MR. LAMKEN:

It's injury-in-fact in the

5

following two senses, Judge -- Mr. Chief Justice:

6

First, all you have to do -- getting a conflict-free

7

referral is itself substantively more valuable than

8

getting one laden by conflict.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Okay.

Now, that

10

goes back to the first proposition.

11

that there is injury-in-fact here.

12

that -- I don't mean this in a pejorative sense, but it

13

seems to me that you slide back and forth between one,

14

two, and three, which makes it hard for us to get a

15

decision.

16

MR. LAMKEN:

That's an argument
So, it seems to me

I think the answer is, so long

17

as Congress has entitled you to something of potential

18

value that isn't being denied to every other member of

19

the public in an undifferentiated way, that is

20

sufficient to be injury-in-fact.

21

-- and there's another way in

which it's injury-in-fact.

So, if you tell me

19

what this case is about is whether or not you've shown

20

injury-in-fact, it's not a significant -- significant

case, and your client has to prove that at trial.

getting something that's potentially -- not getting

won't you, that the idea that it's certainly possible or

Would I have a cause of

It's unclear.

Let me -- let me

18

try to figure out the hypothetical a little bit further.

19

If Congress -- for instance, if the machine part was a

20

safety harness in your car and you purchased a car with

21

a safety harness but you happen simply, you know, to not

22

use the safety harness, Congress might well be able to

23

say -- provide for a protection for all purchasers of

24

this particular vehicle or any kind of vehicle must --

25

that those types of vehicles must have that safety
51

it.

3

And in that instance, Congress could well

4

provide for a statutory damage provision to protect such

5

an individual generally.

installed my own safety harness, which I always do when

protected interest.

19

At common law, if you simply step across a boundary

defined in law that are associated with that line, if

you simply step across this and step back, that is a

JUSTICE BREYER:

Justice Scalia has a point,

5

because, I mean, as I heard him, he was -- he was

reiterating what used to be called a prudential rule of

not, there's lack of prudential standing.

protect the plaintiff there, but this case would fall

14

within it.

between legal harm, though -- I mean, isn't that -- I

do you understand that to be different than any other

Injury-in-fact -- how

kind of injury?

MR. YANG:

Well, an injury-in-fact is not

12

simply a legal injury in the sense of any violation of

13

the law.

interest with respect to this particular individual, the

15

particular plaintiff.

16

It is an invasion of a legally protected

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

There are two

17

elements.

That's the particularized requirement, and I

18

understand that.

19

injury-in-fact simply means particularized?

But you're saying there's --

20

MR. YANG:

No.

No, no, no, no.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

22

MR. YANG:

Okay.

It includes several concepts.

23

injury-in-fact is an invasion of a legally protected

24

interest.

25

it has to be concrete and particularized.

An

It either has to be actual or imminent, and

55
Alderson Reporting Company

Now, again --

so, there's several concepts within the umbrella of

2

injury-in-fact.

3

But I'd like to go back to the examples that

4

we would find, at the time of the framing, of many types

5

of injuries where you don't have to have anything other

6

than an invasion of your legally protected right.

7

instance, a right to an agreement.

8

that has no impact whatsoever, you would be able to get

9

in and sue.

10

For

If there's a breach

Now, there's a question of the

11

quantification of damage, but that's separate.

12

not whether you have an injury-in-fact.

13

the measure of damages, and the measure of damages at

14

common law would be nominal damages.

15

That's

It is how --

Similarly, an invasion -- a trespass

Now -But if the right's threatened --- you want to say -- you

6

want to say that Congress can say that you have a right

7

to buy a conflict-free title insurance policy.

8

I'm not sure that the two equate.

9

MR. YANG:

I'm --

Well, going back to your

10

hypothetical, the reason you have that interest, the

11

reason you have the right to exclude this space, is

12

solely by operation of the law.

Like the Justice Breyer telephone

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You can -- the

2

trespass cases, it seems to me, are different because

3

you are talking about a property right, and you can sell

a property right.

5

the right to keep people off of this piece of property.

6

Do you want to buy it?

7

if -- that's only a property right to the extent you can

8

keep people off of it.

9

You can go to somebody and say I have

Here's how much it's worth.

But

Here, no one's going to buy this right from

10

the -- the plaintiff, because everybody's got it anyway.

You don't -- you don't pay her, because she doesn't have

12

a tangible concrete right.

13

person obviously does, because he can sell it.

The trespass case, the

Well, anything can be monetized.

that's my point.

everybody's already got it.

You can answer.

MR. YANG:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

21

No, this one --

This cannot be monetized because

Well -It's not really a

question, but you can answer.

22

(Laughter.)

23

MR. YANG:

Well, it is -- it's kind of a

24

statement, although you know in this -- this is a

25

specific financial transaction.

It's a transaction

58
Alderson Reporting Company

involving the plaintiff.

She paid money for a service

2

that she got, and it was unlawfully tainted by a

kickback, and that's the type of thing we think

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF AARON M. PANNER

10

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

MR. PANNER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

12

It seems to me that there are two positions

13

that have been articulated before the Court, and both

14

are inconsistent with the Court's prior decisions.

15

first is --

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

17

(Laughter.)

18

MR. PANNER:

Not yours and his?

That of the -- that of the

19

plaintiff and that of the Government, Your Honor.

20

should have been more particularized.

21

(Laughter.)

22

MR. PANNER:

The

I

The violation of a duty owed to

23

us, that is what plaintiff claims is the injury here.

24

The violation of a duty is a violation of a duty; it is

25

not injury.

And similarly the Government says that what
59
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

is required is a sufficient connection to the conduct.

2

But what is required is not a connection to the conduct;

3

what is required is an injury-in-fact, a harm to the

4

plaintiff who is seeking to obtain redress from the

5

courts.

6

the courts is critical to the liberty of the people who

7

come before the courts and who are subject to the power

8

of the courts.

9

And that fundamental limitation on the role of

It is absolutely appropriate for someone who

10

has been harmed through the violation of a statutory or

11

common law duty owed to that person to come before the

12

court seeking redress, but what is not possible is for

13

the courts to be open to a plaintiff who has not alleged

14

that the statutory duty -- the statutory violation that

15

has been alleged has caused any adverse impact.

16

Now, of course, there are broadly -- there

17

are -- there's illegal conduct that may have caused harm

18

to a broad section of the population.

19

engages in price fixing and then sells those price-fixed

20

goods, it may be very easy to show that, as a result of

21

that, many people suffered harm and can come into court

22

to sue for it.

23

that are the basis for standing in many, many cases:

24

for example, defamation, harm to reputation,

25

discrimination where somebody is subject to a -- an

If somebody

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What about a -- I'm sorry

3

to interrupt your -- your concluding remarks, but I am

4

troubled by the dollar nominal damages for breach of

5

contract.

6

What do you say about that?
MR. PANNER:

Well, Your Honor, in -- in a

7

circumstance in which there is a bargain for

8

performance, and it may well be that there is a

9

recognition that there is value that was assigned to

10

that performance that may be hard to measure, and

11

therefore there is a concrete injury that's hard to

12

measure, and, therefore, nominal damages is awarded.

13

Now, it's -- the cases are not uniform on

14

whether nominal damages are available.

There's -- it's

15

actually split and that there's -- we are not aware of a

16

case in this Court that would say that in a circumstance

17

in which there was a harmless breach, that -- that a

18

suit for nominal damages would establish Article III

19

standing.

20

what the correct answer would be.

So, with respect to that, I'm -- I'm not sure

21

Unless the Court has further questions?
