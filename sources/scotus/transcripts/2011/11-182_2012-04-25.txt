ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. CLEMENT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

The State of Arizona bears a

12

disproportionate share of the costs of illegal

13

immigration.

14

borrowed the Federal standards as its own and attempted

15

to enlist state resources in the enforcement of the

16

uniform Federal immigration laws.

17

In addressing those costs, Arizona

Notwithstanding that, the United States took

18

the extraordinary step of seeking a preliminary

19

injunction to enjoin the statute as impliedly preempted

20

on its face before it took effect.

21

agreed with respect to four provisions, but only by

22

inverting fundamental principles of federalism.

23

The Ninth Circuit

The Ninth Circuit, essentially, demanded

24

that Arizona point to specific authorization in Federal

25

statute for its approach.

But that gets matters
3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

backwards.

2

A state does not need to point to Federal

3

authorization for its enforcement efforts.

4

burden is on the parties seeking to preempt a duly

5

enacted state law to point to some provision in

6

statutory law that does the preempting.

7

States can't really do that here, and the reason is

8

obvious.

9

Rather, the

Now, the United

There are multiple provisions of the Federal

10

immigration law that go out of their way to try to

11

facilitate state and local efforts to communicate with

12

Federal immigration officials, in order to ascertain the

13

immigration status of individuals.

14

So, for example, 1373(c) specifically

15

requires that Federal immigration officials shall

16

respond to inquiries from state and local officials

17

about somebody's immigration status.

further.

19

20

of state and local officers to communicate with Federal

21

immigration officers to ascertain somebody's immigration

22

status.

1373(a) goes even

That provision says that no Federal agency or

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- could I interrupt?

2

And turning to 2(B), could you tell me what the state's

3

view is -- the Government proposes that it should be

4

read on its face one way, and I think the state is

5

arguing that there's a narrower way to read it.

6

I to understand that, under the state's position in this

7

action, the only time that the inquiry about the status

8

of an individual rises is after they've had probable

9

cause to arrest that individual for some other crime?
MR. CLEMENT:

10

But am

That's exactly right, Justice

11

Sotomayor.

So this only operates when somebody's been,

12

essentially, stopped for some other infraction.

13

then, at that point, if there's reasonable suspicion to

14

try to identify immigration status, then that can

15

happen.

Of course, one of the things that --

Sure.

there just one moment?
That's what I thought.

20

So, presumably, I

21

think your argument is that, under any circumstance, a

22

police officer would have the discretion to make that

23

call.

24

you make the call or not, although the government is

arguing that it might be, but on how long you detain the

2

individuals are arrested and held for other crimes,

3

often, there's an immigration check that most states do

6

to remove that individual, they put in a warrant of

9

This process is different.

MR. CLEMENT:

How is it

Well, it's different in one

10

important respect, Justice Sotomayor, and that's why I

11

don't think that the issue that divides the parties is

12

only the issue of how long you can detain somebody

13

because I think the Federal government takes the rather

14

unusual position that, even though these stops and these

15

inquiries, if done on an ad hoc basis, become preempted

16

if they're done on a systematic basis --

3

MR. CLEMENT:

And -- and, with respect, I

4

don't think Section 2(B) really speaks to that, which is

5

to say I don't think Section 2(B) says that the

6

systematic inquiry has to take any longer than the

7

ad hoc inquiry.

8
9

And, indeed, Section 2 -- in one of its
provisions -- specifically says that it has to be

10

implemented in a way that's consistent with Federal,

11

both immigration law and civil rights law.

12

No, we

What does the law say -- the Arizona law
say, with respect to releasing that individual?
MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I don't know that it

20

speaks to it in specific terms, but here's what I

21

believe would happen, which is to say, at that point,

22

then, the officer would ask themselves whether there's

23

any reason to continue to detain the person for state

24

law purposes.

25

I mean, it could be that the original
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

offense that the person was pulled over needs to be

2

dealt with or something like that.

3
4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm putting all of this

outside of -- of -- the --

5

MR. CLEMENT:

But -- but, if what we're

6

talking about is simply what happens then, for purposes

7

of the Federal immigration consequences, the answer is

8

nothing.

9

The individual, at that point, is released.
And that, I think, can be very well

10

illustrated by Section 6 -- I don't want to change the

11

subject unnecessarily, but there is arrest authority for

12

somebody who has committed a public offense, which means

13

that it's a crime in another state and in Arizona, but

14

the person can't be arrested for that offense,

15

presumably, because they have already served their

16

sentence for the offense; and then there is new arrest

17

authority given to the officer to hold that person if

18

they are deportable for that offense.

19

Now, I think, in that circumstance, it's

20

very clear what would happen, is an inquiry would be

21

made to the Federal officials that would say, do you

22

want us to transfer this person to your custody or hold

23

this person until you can take custody?

24

answer is no, then that's the end of it.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But how would the state

4

officer know if the person is removable?

5

sometimes a complex inquiry.

6

MR. CLEMENT:

I mean, that's

Well, Justice Ginsburg, I

7

think there's two answers to that.

One is -- you're

8

right, sometimes, it's a complex inquiry.

9

it's a straightforward inquiry.

Sometimes,

It could be murder.

It

10

could be a drug crime.

But I think the practical answer

11

to the question is, by hypothesis, there is going to be

12

inquiry made to the Federal immigration authorities,

13

either the Law Enforcement Support Center or a 287 --

14

287(g) officer.
And, presumably, as a part of that inquiry,

15
16

they can figure out whether or not this is a removable

17

offense or at least a substantially likely removable

18

offense.

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Suppose it takes two weeks

20

to make that determination, can the alien be held by the

21

state for that whole period of time --

22

MR. CLEMENT:

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

24

MR. CLEMENT:

25

Oh, I don't --- just under Section 6?

I don't think so, Your Honor,

and I think that -- you know, what -- in all of these
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

provisions, you have the Fourth Amendment backing up the

2

limits, and I think so --

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What -- what would be the

4

standard?

You're -- you're the attorney for the -- the

5

alien, he -- they are going to hold him for two weeks

offense.

reasonable inquiry.

circumstances, what we know from the record here is

13

that, generally, the immigration status inquiry is

14

something that takes 10 or 11 minutes, I mean, so it's

15

not -- we're not talking about something -- or no more

16

than 10, if it's a 287(g) officer, and, roughly, 11

17

minutes on average if it's the Law Enforcement Support

18

Center.

the same question, but -- but I'm trying to think of

there certainly are situations where state authorities

21

will arrest somebody and then release them relatively

rapidly, they generally don't release somebody until

basis for striking down a statute on its face.

JUSTICE BREYER:

And it's neither an

That's a

different argument --

18

MR. CLEMENT:

But I do want to -- but I do

19

want to be responsive and make the point that I think

20

the factual premise that this is going to -- 2(B) is

21

going to lead to the elongation of a lot of arrests is

22

not true.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

Can I make the

24

following statement in the opinion -- and you will say

25

that's okay.

Imagine -- this is imaginary.
13
Alderson Reporting Company

"We

Official

1

interpret" -- imagine -- "we interpret Section 2(B) as

2

not authorizing or requiring the detention of any

3

individual under 2(B), either at the stop or in prison,

4

for a significantly longer period of time than that

5

person would have been detained in the absence of 2(B)."

6

Can I make that statement in an opinion, and

7

you'll say, that's right?

8
9

MR. CLEMENT:

I think what you could say is

that --

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

11

MR. CLEMENT:

12

But can I say that?

I don't think you can say just

that.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

14

MR. CLEMENT:

No.

I think you can say something

15

similar, though.

16

look, this is a facial challenge.

17

gone into effect.

18

would elongate, in a significant number of cases, the

19

detention or the arrest.

20

I think you probably could say that,
The statute's never

We don't anticipate that Section 2(B)

I think you could say that.

And the reason is, as I indicated, it's

21

something that happens even without this law that, when

22

you arrest somebody -- and there are some offenses that

23

are -- you can arrest and release under state law, but

24

before you release the individual, you generally want to

25

ascertain that that individual is going to show up at
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the hearing, and that's what really distinguishes those

2

cases, where there's arrest and release, from those

3

cases where there's arrest and you book somebody.

4

Now, here's the other reason why I don't

5

think, factually, this is going to elongate things

6

because, already, in a significant number of booking

7

facilities in Arizona, you already have the process that

8

people are systematically run through immigration checks

9

when they are booked as part of the booking process.

10

That's reflected in the record here in the Maricopa

11

County system, that that's done by a 287(g) officer as a

12

matter of routine.

13

The Federal government doesn't like this

14

statute, but they are very proud of their Secure

15

Communities program.

16

program also makes clear that everybody's that's booked

17

at participating facilities is -- eventually has their

18

immigration status checked.

19

And their Secure Communities

And so I don't think that this immigration

20

status check is likely to lead to a substantial

21

elongation of the stops or the detentions.

22

obviously --

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Now,

I want to make sure that

24

I have a clear representation from you.

to the Federal agency, the agency says, we don't want to
15
Alderson Reporting Company

If, at a call

2

unless it's under 6, is what you're telling me.

3

Or under 6, 3, or some -- one other of Arizona's

4

immigration crimes.

5

MR. CLEMENT:

Exactly.

Obviously, if this

6

is somebody who was going -- you know, 60 miles an hour

7

in a 20-mile-an-hour school zone or something, they may

8

decide, wholly apart from the immigration issues, that

9

this is somebody they want to bring back to the station.
But, for the purposes of once they make the

10
11

contact with Federal immigration officials, if the

12

Federal immigration officials say, look, we have no

13

interest in removing this person, we have no interest in

14

prosecuting this person under the Federal criminal

15

provisions, then that's the end of the Federal case of

16

the --

17
18
19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

Then tell

me -JUSTICE SCALIA:

So, you'll concede that the

20

4

MR. CLEMENT:

8
9

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, here, Justice Scalia,

here's my response, which is all of this discussion, at

10

least as I've understood it, has been about 2(B) and, to

11

a lesser extent, 6.

12

Now, Section 3 of the statute does provide

13

an authority, under state law, to penalize somebody who

14

has violated, essentially, the Federal registration

15

requirement.

16

there would be a state authority, even under these

17

hypotheticals, to take action with respect to the

9

than it does with respect to the inquiry and arrest

10

I think the reason my answer is no has more to

authority provisions, 2(B) and 6.

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, before you move on to

12

the registration requirement, could I take you back to

13

an example that's similar to the one that Justice Breyer

14

was referring to?
Let's someone -- let's say someone who is a

15
16

citizen and a resident of New Mexico, has a New Mexico

17

driver's license, drives across the border, is stopped

18

for speeding, not 60 miles an hour in a 20-mile zone,

19

but 10 miles over the speed limit on an interstate.

20

the officer, for some reason, thinks that this person

21

may be an illegal alien.

22

And

How would that work out?

If you do the records check, you're not

23

going to get anything back, right, because the person is

24

a citizen?

25

from there?

So what -- where would the officer take it

18
Alderson Reporting Company

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, if I can just kind of

2

work back for a second?

3

pretty unusual circumstance, where somebody produces an

4

out-of-state driver's license, and that doesn't dispel

5

reasonable suspicion for the officer.

6

hypo --

7

I mean, obviously, it's a

JUSTICE ALITO:

But I'll take the

Why would it dispel

8

reasonable suspicion if it's -- if the officer knows

9

it's a state that issues driver's licenses to aliens who

10

are not lawfully in that instance --

11

MR. CLEMENT:

And that might be a situation

12

where that's the case, and then -- then it wouldn't

13

dispel the reasonable suspicion.

average case, I think it would.

But, say, in the

They would then go further.

And then they

16

would then make the inquiry to the Federal officials.

18

would happen is, at some point, you'd get to the end of

Now, it might not be the end of the matter

to do anything that the official couldn't do on an

the officer can arrest -- the state officer can arrest a

14

person on -- simply on the ground that the person is

removable, which is what the Office of Legal Counsel

Now, as we read Section 6, because there's a

But I don't -- I don't take any issue with

I do think, though, it's important

It does do one thing that's very important,

difficult the government's preemption argument is here

MR. CLEMENT:

They are

They are removable.

I don't

9

think they would have committed a public offense --

10

absent a very unusual situation, I don't think they

11

would have committed a public offense under Arizona law.

12

So I don't think there actually would be arrest

13

authority in that circumstance, as Justice Alito's

14

question has -- has -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

15

of public offense?

17

MR. CLEMENT:

A public offense definition --

18

it's actually -- it's a petition appendix -- well, I'm

19

sorry.

20

The definition is, basically, that it's

21

something that is a crime in another jurisdiction and

22

also a crime in Arizona.

23

anomalous is, normally, if something is a crime in

24

Arizona, there's arrest authority for that directly.

25

And so what makes this kind of

So what this really captures is people who

have committed a crime are no longer arrestable for the

2

crime because they have served their sentence or some

3

other peculiarity, but they are, nonetheless, removable

4

because of the crime.

5

And so --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, maybe it's

6

a good time to talk about some of the other sections, in

7

particular Section 5(C).

8
9

Now, that does seem to expand beyond the
Federal government's determination about the types of

10

sanctions that should govern the employment

11

relationship.

12

You talk about supply and demand.

The

13

Federal government, of course, prohibits the employment,

14

but it also imposes sanctions with respect to

15

application for work.

16

case, is imposing some significantly greater sanctions.

17

And the state of Arizona, in this

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, it's certainly imposing

18

different sanctions.

19

little bit -- kind of hard to weigh the difference

20

between removability, which is obviously a pretty

21

significant sanction for an alien, and the relatively

22

modest penalties imposed by Section 5(C).

23

I mean -- you know, it's -- it's a

But I take the premise that 5(C) does

24

something that there is no direct analog in Federal law.

25

But I -- but that -- that's not enough to get you to
23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

preemption, obviously.

2

And one of the things that makes 5(C), it

3

seems to us, a weak case for preemption is that it only

4

targets employment that is expressly forbidden by

5

Federal law.

6

essentially, the government is reduced to arguing that

7

because, in 1986, when Congress passed IRCA, it only

8

focused on the employer's side of the equation and

9

didn't, generally speaking, impose restrictions on

10

employees, that, somehow, they are going to draw a

11

preemptive inference from that.

And so, then we look at -- you know,

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Counsel -Would you agree

14

that -- would you accept, as a working hypothesis, that

15

we can begin with the general principle that the Hines

ask our principal -- our primary function is to

18

determine whether, under the circumstances of this

19

20

the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes

21

and objectives of Congress?

22
23

Is -- is that an acceptable test from your
standpoint?

24
25

MR. CLEMENT:
test.

I think it's an acceptable

I mean, Justice Kennedy -- you know, there
24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

obviously have been subsequent cases, including DeCanas

2

that -- and Whiting, that give additional shape and

3

color to that test, and -- but I don't have any -- I

4

don't have any real quarrel with that test.

5

And here's why I don't think that --

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But -- but then the

7

government on this section is going to come and say,

8

well, there may be -- this must be -- this -- the

9

enforcement of this statute, as Arizona describes it,

10

will be in considerable tension with our -- with our

11

basic approach; isn't that what I'm going to hear from

12

the government?

13

MR. CLEMENT:

It may be what you're going to

14

hear, Justice Kennedy, but I don't think you just take

15

the Federal government for its word on these things.

16

You know, it's interesting, in DeCanas

17

itself, the SG said that that California statute was

18

preempted.

19

well, you know, we've got this language from Hines, and

20

we have the SG telling us it's preempted, that's good

21

enough for us.

22

hard.

23

And, in DeCanas, this Court didn't say,

They went beyond that, and they looked

And what they did is they established that

24

this is an area where the presumption against preemption

25

applies.

So that seems one strike in our favor.
25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

We have here a situation where there is an

2

express preemption provision, and it -- it only

3

addresses the employer's side of the ledger.

4

express preemption provision clearly doesn't apply here.

5

So the only thing they have is this inference --

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So the

Well, for those of us

7

for whom legislative history has some importance, there

8

seems to be quite a bit of legislative history that

9

the -- that the idea of punishing employees was raised,

10

discussed, and explicitly rejected.

11

MR. CLEMENT:

Sure.

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And -The preemption language

13

would be geared to what was decided to be punished.

14

It seems odd to think that the Federal government is

15

deciding on employment sanctions and has unconsciously

16

decided not to punish employees.

17

MR. CLEMENT:

But -- but, Justice Sotomayor,

18

there's a big difference between Congress deciding not

19

as a matter of Federal law to address employees with an

20

additional criminal prohibition and saying that that

21

decision itself has preemptive effect.

22

remarkable additional step.

23

That's a rather

And here's why I think, if you consider the

24

legislative history, for those who do, it really

25

supports us because here's what Congress confronted.

I

1

mean, they started thinking about this problem in 1971.

2

They passed IRCA in 1986.

3

At that point, here's the state of the

4

world:

It's already unlawful, as a matter of Federal

5

law, for the employee to get -- to have this unlawful

6

work; and, if they seek this unlawful work, they are

7

subject to removal for doing it.

8
9

In addition, Congress was told that most of
the aliens who get this unlawful work are already

10

here -- they illegally entered, so they are already

11

subject to an independent criminal offense.

12

So, at that point, Congress is facing a

13

world where the employee is already subject to multiple

14

prohibitions.

15

matter of Federal law.

16

they address the employer's side of the equation.

17

have an express preemption provision that says nothing

18

about any intent of preempting the employee's side of

19

the ledger.

20

The employer is completely scot-free as a

with the -- the Federal -- it's not just that the person

That leaves the

But there is regulation, and the

3

So we have the -- what you call the supply

4

side is -- is regulated, but you want to regulate it

5

more.

6
7

MR. CLEMENT:

I'd like to save time for rebuttal, Justice Ginsburg.

8
9

Two quick responses, and then

The first is that, if you look at what they
regulate on the employee's side, it's really things that

10

actually assist in regulating the employer's side

11

because what they are worried about is a fraudulent

12

document that then is used, essentially, to trick the

13

employer to employing somebody who shouldn't be

14

employed.

15

The second thing is the more that you view

16

IRCA as actually regulating part of the employee's side,

17

then I think the more persuasive it is that the express

18

preemption provision doesn't reach the employee's side

19

of the equation.

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll give you

21

plenty of rebuttal time, but I'd like to hear what you

22

have to say about Section 3 before you sit down.

23

MR. CLEMENT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

24

I appreciate the opportunity to do that.

25

to Section 3, the question is really -- it's -- it's a
28
Alderson Reporting Company

I do think, as

Official

1

provision that is parallel to the Federal requirements

2

and imposes the same punishments as the Federal

3

requirement.

4

So it's, generally, not a fertile ground for

5

preemption.

6

preemption even in those analogous circumstances.

7

are the cases that the government is forced to rely on,

8

cases like Buckman, cases like --

9

But, of course, there are cases that find

They

prosecutions be -- suppose that an alien were prosecuted

11

under Federal law for violating, basically, the terms of

12

Could the states then prosecute him as well?

13

MR. CLEMENT:

I think they could under

14

general double jeopardy principles and the dual

15

sovereignty doctrine.

16

particular concern to you, that might be the basis for

17

an as-applied challenge, if somebody was already

18

prosecuted under Federal law.

19

Obviously, if that was a

But, of course, this Court has confronted

20

exactly that argument, in California against Zook, where

21

24

2

there.

3

And this Court rejected that argument

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Clement, it

4

seems that the -- I would think the largest hurdle for

5

you is Hines, which said the registration scheme --

6

Congress enacted a complete registration scheme which

7

the states cannot complement or impose even auxiliary

8

regulations.

9

So I don't see the alien registration as a

10

question of obstacle preemption, but appeal preemption

11

that alien -- we don't want a competing registration

12

scheme.

13

Federal.

14

We want the registration scheme to be wholly

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, I

15

think that's part of the reason why I accepted Justice

16

Kennedy's characterization of the relevant language in

17

Hines because, although there is some general discussion

18

there of field preemption, when the Court actually

19

states what its holding is, it does state it in terms of

20

obstacle preemption.

21

And here's where I think there is a critical

22

difference between what the Court had before it in Hines

23

and what you have before you here.

24
25

In Hines, Pennsylvania passed its statute
before Congress passed the alien registration statute.

weren't soothsayers in Pennsylvania.

predict the future.

a conflict between the provisions of the Pennsylvania

5

registration law and the Federal registration law.

6

this Court struck it down on that preemption basis.

7

Here it's quite different.

They couldn't

So, when it got up here, there was

And

Arizona had

8

before it the Federal statute.

It looked at this

9

precise provision in the Federal statute.

It adopted

10

those standards as its own, and then it imposed parallel

11

penalties for the violation of the state equivalent.

12

And so I -- I think the right analysis is

13

really the analysis that this Court laid out in its

14

Whiting decision, which says that, in these kinds of

15

cases, what you look for is whether or not the state

16

scheme directly interferes with the operation of the

17

Federal scheme.

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Can I ask you something?

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, in that -Justice Alito.

In that regard, we are told

22

that there are some important categories of aliens who

23

can't obtain registration -- cannot obtain Federal

24

registration; and, yet, there are people that nobody

25

would think should be removed.

I think someone with a

31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

pending asylum application would fall into that

2

category.

3

How would Section 3 apply there?

4

MR. CLEMENT:

I think it probably wouldn't

5

apply.

There's two provisions that might make it

6

inapplicable.

7

that individual in that category would be subject to

8

prosecution under 1304 and 1306.

9

understand -- you know, the Government's position, there

The first question you'd ask is whether

And, if I

10

are certain people where -- you know, they can't really

11

get the registration document because of the narrow

12

class that they are in.

13

And, as I understand it, it is not a

14

violation of either 1304 or 1306 to not get a

independent violation.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Do you have any example

10

where -- where enforcement discretion has the effect of

11

preempting state action?

12

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Well, I think we should

13

think about Section 3 of the law, Your Honor.

14

it will help illustrate the point --

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I think

I'm talking about another

16

-- another case of ours where we've said that,

17

essentially, the preemption of state law can occur, not

18

by virtue of the Congress preempting, but because the

19

executive doesn't want this law enforced so -- so

20

rigorously, and that preempts the state from enforcing

21

it vigorously.

22

Do we have any case that says that?

23

GENERAL VERRILLI:

I think the preemption

24

here -- focusing for a moment on Section 3 -- the

25

preemption here flows from judgments of Congress, from
38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the registration system that Congress set up in Sections

2

1301 through 1306, from the decision of Congress in

3

Section 1103 in the law to vest the Secretary of DHS and

4

the Attorney General with the authority to make the

5

judgments about how this law is going to be enforced --

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, they do that with

7

all -- with all Federal criminal statutes.

8

acknowledge that, as a general matter, states can

9

enforce Federal criminal law, which is always entrusted

10
11

And you

to the Attorney General.
GENERAL VERRILLI:

They -- they can make --

12

they can engage in detention, in support of the

13

enforcement of Federal law.

14

15

under Federal law and make their own decisions.

16

a far different matter.

17
18
19

That's what the OLC opinion

It does not say that they can prosecute
That's

And it really goes to the heart, I think, of
what's wrong with Section 3 of this Act, in that -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but you say

20

that the Federal government has to have control over who

21

to prosecute, but I don't see how Section 2(B) says

22

anything about that at all.

23

Federal government, here's someone who is here

25

All it does is notify the

The

1

rests entirely with the Attorney General.

2

GENERAL VERRILLI:

That's correct, but, with

3

respect to -- and I will -- let me address something

4

fundamental about Section 2.

5

think it doesn't get at the heart of the problem here.

6

The -- Section 1 of this statute says that

That is true, but I -- I

7

Sections 2 and 3 and 5 are supposed to work together to

8

achieve this policy of attrition through enforcement.

9

And so what Section 2 does is identify a population that

10

the state of Arizona is going to prosecute under Section

11

3 and Section 5 --

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Right.

So, apart

13

from Section 3 and Section 5, take those off the table,

14

you have no objection to Section 2?
GENERAL VERRILLI:

15

We do, Your Honor.

But,

16

before I take 3 and 5 off the table, if I could make one

17

more point about 3 and 5, please?

18

because I think it's important to understand the dilemma

19

that this puts the Federal government in.

The -- I think --

Arizona has got this population, and

20
21

they've -- and they're, by law, committed to maximum

22

enforcement.

23

decide, are we going to take our resources, which we

24

deploy for removal, and are we going to use them to deal

25

with this population, even if it is to the detriment of

And so the Federal government's got to

our priorities --

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Exactly.

You -- the

3

Federal government has to decide where it's going to use

4

its resources.

5

And what the state is saying, here are

6

people who are here in violation of Federal law, you

7

make the decision.

8

want to prosecute those people, fine, that's entirely up

9

to you.

10
11

And if your decision is you don't

That's why I don't see the problem with Section

2(B).
GENERAL VERRILLI:

Here's the other

12

half -- here's the other half of the equation, Mr. Chief

13

Justice, which is that they say, if you're not going to

14

remove them, we are going to prosecute them.

15

means that the -- and I think this does get at the heart

16

of why this needs to be an exclusive national power --

17
18
19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And that

Only under Section 3

and Section 5.
GENERAL VERRILLI:

Yes, but those are -- but

20

what you're talking about is taking somebody whose --

21

whose only offense is being unlawfully present in the

22

country and putting them in jail for up to 6 months, or

23

somebody who --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

6 months for employment.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Right.

Right.

5

For the notification, what could possibly be

6

wrong, if Arizona arrests someone, let's say for drunk

7

driving, and their policy is you're going to stay in

8

jail overnight, no matter what, okay?

9

during that period, by having the Arizona arresting

What's wrong,

10

officer say, I'm going to call the Federal agency and

11

find out if this person is here illegally because the

12

Federal law says the Federal agency has to answer my

13

question.

14

It seems an odd argument to say the Federal

15

agency has to answer the state's question, but the state

16

can't ask it.

17

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Well, we're not saying

18

the state can't ask it in any individual case.

19

recognize that section --

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We -- we

You think there are

21

individual cases in which the state can call the Federal

22

government and say, is this person here illegally?

23

25

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Yes, certainly, but that

doesn't make -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
42

Okay.

So doesn't

1

that defeat the facial challenge to the Act?

2

GENERAL VERRILLI:

No.

I don't think so,

3

Mr. Chief Justice, because the -- I think the problem

4

here is in that -- is in every circumstance, as a result

5

of Section 2(B) of the law, backed by the penalties of

6

section 2(H), the state official must pursue the

7

priorities that the state has set, irrespective of

8

whether they are helpful to or in conflict with the

9

Federal priorities.

And so --

JUSTICE ALITO:

10

Suppose that

11

every -- suppose every law enforcement officer in

12

Arizona saw things exactly the same way as the Arizona

13

legislature.

14

legislature, they all took it upon themselves to make

15

these inquiries every time they stopped somebody or

16

arrested somebody.

And so, without any direction from the

17

Would that be a violation of Federal law?

18

GENERAL VERRILLI:

No, it wouldn't be,

19

Your Honor, because, in that situation, they would be

20

free to be responsive to Federal priorities, if the

21

Federal officials came back to them and said, look, we

22

need to focus on gangs, we need to focus on this drug

23

problem at the border --

24
25

JUSTICE ALITO:

But what if they said, well,

we don't care what your priorities are; we -- we have
43
Alderson Reporting Company

1

our priorities, and our priority is maximum enforcement,

2

and we're going to call you in every case?

Well -- yes, well --

Well, if there's a -- if

8

there's a state policy locked into law by statute,

9

locked into law by regulation, then we have a problem.

10

If it's not --

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

General, I am having --

12

GENERAL VERRILLI:

-- the line is mandatory

13
14

versus discretionary -JUSTICE ALITO:

That's what I can't

15

understand because your argument -- you seem to be

16

saying that what's wrong with the Arizona law is that

17

the Arizona legislature is trying to control what its

18

employees are doing, and they have to be free to

19

disregard the desires of the Arizona legislature, for

20

whom they work, and follow the priorities of the Federal

21

government, for whom they don't work.

22

GENERAL VERRILLI:

But they -- but, with

23

respect to immigration enforcement, and to the extent

24

all they're doing is bringing people to the Federal

25

Government's attention, they are cooperating in the
44

enforcement of Federal law --

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But the hypothetical is

3

that that's all the legislature is doing.

4

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Well, except I think,

5

Justice Kennedy, the problem is that it's not

6

cooperation if, in every instance, the officers in the

7

state must respond to the priorities set by the state

8

government and are not free to respond to the priorities

9

of the Federal officials who are trying to enforce the

10

law in the most effective manner possible.

see it.

19

Mr. Clement says the statute means -- the officer has to

pick up the phone and call -- and call the agency to

21

find out if it's an illegal alien or not.

22

Every person that's suspected of being an alien

He tells me that, unless there's another

23

reason to arrest the person -- and that's 3 and 6, or

24

any of the other provisions -- but putting those aside,

25

we're going to stay just in 2(B), if the government
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

says, we don't want to detain the person, they have to

2

be released for being simply an illegal alien, what's

3

wrong with that?

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Taking out the other

6

provisions, taking out any independent state-created

7

basis of liability for being an -- an illegal alien?

8
9
10

GENERAL VERRILLI:

I think there are three.

The first is the -- the Hines problem of harassment.
Now, we are not making an allegation of

11

racial profiling; nevertheless, there are already tens

12

of thousands of stops that result in inquiries in

13

Arizona, even in the absence of SB 1070.

14

reason that -- that the legislature thought that that

15

wasn't sufficient and there needed to be more.

It stands to

And it -- given that you have a population

17

in Arizona of 2 million Latinos, of whom only 400,000,

18

at most, are there unlawfully, there --

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

20
21

Sounds like racial

profiling to me.
GENERAL VERRILLI:

And they're -- and given

that what we're talking about is the status of being

unlawfully present, which --

many -- and what the -- percentage of calls before the

3

GENERAL VERRILLI:

There is some evidence in

It's the -- the Palmatier

5

declaration, which is in the Joint Appendix, was the --

6

he was the fellow who used the run the Law Enforcement

7

Support Center, which answers the inquiries.

8

that declaration indicates that, in fiscal year 2009,

9

there were 80,000 inquiries and -JUSTICE SCALIA:

That --

What does this have to do

11

with Federal immigration law?

12

with -- with racial harassment, but I thought you

13

weren't relying on that.

14

GENERAL VERRILLI:

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I mean, it may have to do

The -Are you objecting to

about harassing them.

20

illegal immigrants or not.

Is that -- surely, you're -- you're not concerned

They have been stopped anyway,

So you must be talking about other people

22

who have nothing to do with -- with our immigration

23

laws.

Hines is --- which is -- which is

what you're asserting preempts all of this activity.

7

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Hines identified this

8

problem as harassment as -- as a central feature of

9

preemption under the immigration laws because of the

10

concern that the way this nation treats citizens of

11

other countries is fundamental to our foreign relations.

12

And this is a --

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, let's -- let me just

14

go back because I think -- I'm trying to get focused the

15

question, I think, others are asking.

17
18

And one way to

Think of 2(B), the first sentence.

All

right?

19

Now, I can think -- I'm not saying they are

20

right -- but, if that means you're going to hold an

21

individual longer than you would have otherwise, I can

22

think of some arguments that it is preempted and some

23

replies.

24
25

So keep that out of it.
Suppose that we were to say, that sentence,

as we understand it, does not raise a constitutional
48
Alderson Reporting Company

1

problem as long as it is interpreted to mean that the

2

policeman, irrespective of what answer he gets from ICE,

3

cannot detain the person for longer than he would have

4

done in the absence of this provision.

5

Now, in your view, is there any preemption

6

exemption -- argument against -- any preemption argument

7

against that sentence as I have just interpreted it?

8

don't know what your answer is, and that's why I'm

asking.

Yes.

I

I -- we would

think it would ameliorate -JUSTICE BREYER:

it's -- oh, he's illegal.

Okay.

Okay?

Thanks.

I stopped

Good-bye.

8

I mean, why -- it is still your decision.

9

And, if you don't want to know who is in this country

10

illegally, you don't have to.

11

GENERAL VERRILLI:

That's correct.

But the

12

process of -- the process of cooperating to enforce the

13

Federal immigration law starts earlier.

14

with the process of making the decisions about who to --

15

who to stop, who to apprehend, who to check on.

16

problem -- the structural problem we have is that those

17

decisions -- in the making of those decisions, Arizona

18

And one thing that's instructive in that

8

regard, Mr. Chief Justice, are the declarations put into

the record by the police chiefs from Phoenix and Tucson,

10

both of whom I think explain effectively why SB -- the

6

priorities is people who have previously been removed,

that they have committed a serious crime, and they --

backed by this civil fine, that you've got to make the

inquiry in every case.

analogy, if you ask one of your law clerks to bring you

8

the most important preemption cases from the last 10

9

years, and they rolled in the last -- the last hundred

22

as they're -- they obtain adequate training, and they

23

are subject to the direction and control of the Attorney

24

General in carrying out immigration functions.

nothing that we've said so far should be read to -- to

preclude informal cooperation, communication or other

informal cooperation in the apprehension, detention, and

5

focus on cooperation.

6

And I think you have to -- so I don't think

7

you can read into 1373 the -- the conclusion that what

8

Congress was intending to do was to shift from the

9

Federal government to the states the authority to set

enforcement priorities because I think the cooperation

addition, we do think that there is a structural

accountability problem, in that they are enforcing

Federal law, but not answerable to the Federal

11

officials.

12

And, third, we do think there are practical

13

impediments, in that the -- the result of this is to

14

deliver to the Federal system a volume of inquiries that

15

makes it harder and not easier to identify who the

16

priority persons are for removal.

17

So those are the three reasons.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

General, you have

19

been trying valiantly to get us to focus on Section 3,

20

so maybe we should let you do that now.

21
22
23

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice.
The -- I do think the key thing about

24

Section 3 is that we -- is that Section 3 is purporting

25

to enforce a Federal registration requirement.
57
Alderson Reporting Company

That's a

Official

1

relationship between the alien and the United States

2

government that's exclusively a Federal relationship.

3

It's governed by the terms of 1301 through 1306.

4

And the way in which those terms are

5

enforced does have very significant Federal interest at

6

its heart.

7

in that Federal registration relationship.

8
9

And there is no state police power interest

And I do think -- I think it's very
important -- Justice Alito raised the question of these

10

categories of people.

11

important to get clarity on that.

12

I think it's -- it is quite

The -- if you are -- if you have come into

13

the country unlawfully, but you have a pending

14

application for asylum, a pending application for

15

temporary protective status, because you -- you would

16

have to be removed to a country to which you can't be

17

removed, because of the conditions in the country, if

18

you have a valid claim for relief under the Violence

19

Against Women Act based on your treatment, if you have a

20

valid claim for relief because you are a victim of human

21

trafficking, if you have a valid claim for relief

22

because you are the victim of a crime or a witness to a

23

crime, all of those persons are in technical violation

24

of 1306(a).

25

And -- and it seems to me.
58
Alderson Reporting Company

They -- they are

Official

1

in violation of 1306(a), so my friend, Mr. Clement, just

2

is not correct in saying that those are people who

3

aren't in violation of 1306(a) and, therefore, aren't in

4

violation of -- of Section 3.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

They are in violation.
Well, maybe 1306(a) ought

6

to be amended, then.

I mean, we have statutes out there

7

that there a lot of people in violation of it and --

8

well, the Attorney General will take care of it.

9

that how we write our criminal laws?
GENERAL VERRILLI:

10

Is

But -- but it's a

11

situation in which no reasonable person would think that

12

the individual ought to be prosecuted.

13

often, the states aren't even going to know, in fact,

14

about asylum status.

15

regulations that require that to be kept private, to

16

avoid retaliation against the person making the

17

application.

18

And, yet, very

They can't know because there are

And so, this -- so this is -- this is, I

19

think, a very strong illustration of why the enforcement

20

discretion over Section 3 needs to be vested exclusively

21

in the Federal government.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Again, I ask you, do you

23

have any other case in which the basis for preemption

24

has been you are interfering with -- with the Attorney

25

General's enforcement discretion?
59
Alderson Reporting Company

1

GENERAL VERRILLI:

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, this is -I think that's an

3

extraordinary basis for saying that the state is

4

preempted.

5

GENERAL VERRILLI:

I think what is

6

extraordinary about this, actually, Justice Scalia, is

7

the state's decision to enact a statute purporting to

8

criminalize the violation of a Federal registration

9

obligation.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's not criminalizing

anything that isn't criminal under Federal law.

13

GENERAL VERRILLI:

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

But -- but what -It's -- it's the bank.

It's the Federal bank example --

Well.
-- a state law, which

criminalizes the same thing that the Federal law does.

19
20

And

they are doing it for a reason --

11
12

And I think that's the problem here.

GENERAL VERRILLI:

I think it's quite

different.
What they are doing here is using 1306(a) to

22

get at the status of unlawful presence.

The only people

23

who can be prosecuted under Section 3 are people who are

24

unlawfully present in the country.

25

statute says.

That's what the

And they are using it to get at that
60
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

category of people, to, essentially, use their state

2

criminal law to perform an immigration function.

3

And the immigration function is to try to --

4

to prosecute these people.

5

prosecute somebody, they can be put in jail for 30 days

6

here.

7

a continuing offense.

But, under Federal law, a violation of 1306(a) is

8

And, by the way, you can

So the day they get out of jail for that 30
days, they can be arrested again.

And this can happen

10

to drive unlawfully present people out of the state of

Arizona.

And the point of this provision is

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

simply don't have the money or the resources to enforce

is that the state of Arizona has -- has a massive

emergency with social disruption, economic disruption,

immigrants.

Let's just assume those two things.

3

Does that give the state of Arizona any

powers or authority or legitimate concerns that any

5

other state wouldn't have?

Of course, they have

legitimate concerns in that situation.

10

legislature and say, we're concerned about this, and ask

the legislature to enact laws to correct this problem?

GENERAL VERRILLI:

They -- they certainly

13

can enact laws of general application.

14

the laws of general application that are on the books.

15

They already -- as a result of 8 U.S.C. 1621, it's clear

that they are under no obligation to provide any state

Well -- well, what I

19

think they are going to do in Arizona is something quite

20

extraordinary, that has significant real and practical

21

foreign relations effects.

22

it's the reason why this power needs to be vested

23

exclusively in the Federal government.

24
25

And that's the problem, and

They -- what they are going to do is engage,
effectively, in mass incarceration because the

2

to enforce Section 2 to the fullest possible extent at

I had a little --

wasn't sure about your answer to Justice Kennedy.
Is the reason that the government is not
focused on people who are here illegally, as opposed to
67
Alderson Reporting Company

1

the other categories you were talking about, because of

2

prioritization or because of lack of resources?

3

You suggested that if the -- every illegal

alien that you identify is either removed or prosecuted,

that that would cause tensions with other governments.

GENERAL VERRILLI:

10

Well, it's a little more

complicated than that.

this:

13

present, there are some who are going to fall in our

priority categories.

17

categories.

18

I think the -- the point is

That with respect to persons who are unlawfully

There are those who have committed

Because we have resource constraints and

19

there are only so many beds in the detention centers and

20

only so many immigration judges, we want to focus on

21

those priority categories, find them, remove them.

22

There is a second category, and that is,

23

individuals who are here in violation, technically, of

24

1306(a), but who have a valid asylum application or

25

application for temporary protected status or other -68

and, with respect to those persons that we think

would -- it's affirmatively harmful to think that they

4

And then there is an additional category of

5

people who are not in the second category and not

priorities, and the form and we think there, the idea

7

that an individual state will engage in a process of

8

mass incarceration of that population, which we do think

is what Section 2(H) commits Arizona to do under Section

10

that?
GENERAL VERRILLI:

20

Well, a couple of things.

21

First is I don't think it's realistic to assume that the

22

aggressive enforcement of Sections 3 and 5 in Arizona is

23

going to lead to a mass migration back to countries of

24

origin.

25

be migration to other states.

It seems a far more likely outcome is going to
And that's a significant

69
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

problem.

That's part of the reason why this problem

2

needs to be managed on a national basis.

3

Beyond that, I do think, you know, the --

4

it's worth bearing in mind here that the country of

5

Mexico is in a central role in this situation.

6

Between 60 and 70 percent of the people that

7

we remove every year, we remove to Mexico.

And, in

8

addition, we have to have the cooperation of the

9

Mexicans.

And I think, as the Court knows from other

10

cases, the cooperation of the country to whom we are --

11

to which we are removing people who are unlawfully

12

present is vital to be able to make removal work.

13

In addition, we have very significant issues

14

on the border with Mexico.

15

very issues that Arizona is complaining about, in

16

that --

17

And, in fact, they are the

And that's why the -- the power needs

And your concern is

7

the problems that would arise in bilateral relations if

8

you remove all of these people -- or a significant

9

percentage or a greater percentage than you are now.

10

Nothing in the law requires you to do that.

11

12

an illegal alien has been arrested, and you can decide,

13

we are not going to initiate removal proceedings against

more person than you would like to remove under your

Right, but the problem

18

I'm focused on -- we're focused on, Mr. Chief Justice,

is not our removal decisions, but Arizona's decision to

20

incarcerate, and the foreign relations problem that that

21

raises.

arises under 3 and 5?

don't want to tax the Court's patience, but if I could

8

spend a minute on Section 5?

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
GENERAL VERRILLI:

10

And I

Section 5.

The -- I do think the

11

fundamental point about Section 5 here is that, in 1986,

12

Congress fundamentally changed the landscape.

13

made a decision in 1986 to make the employment of aliens

14

a central concern of national immigration policy.

15

this Court has described the 1986 law as a comprehensive

16

regime.

17

Congress

And

Now, what my friend, Mr. Clement, says, is

18

that it may be a comprehensive regime for employers;

19

it's not a comprehensive regime for employees.

20

therefore, it's -- there ought not be any inference here

21

that the states are precluded from criminalizing efforts

22

to seek or obtain employment in Arizona.

23

And,

But I really think that's not right.

24

The -- employment is one problem.

And Congress tackled

25

the problem of employment and made a decision -- a
72
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

comprehensive decision, about this -- the sanctions it

2

thought were appropriate to govern.

3

as Justice Ginsburg suggested, make judgments with

4

respect to the circumstances under which employees could

5

be held criminally liable, as well as the circumstances

6

under which employers could be held liable.

7

And Congress did,

And I think it is useful, in thinking about

8

the judgments Congress actually made --

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

-- think field preemption;

is that your argument with respect to this section?

11

GENERAL VERRILLI:

It's -- it's both.

I

12

think we're making both a field and a conflict

13

preemption argument here, Justice Scalia.

14

and the -- I think it's worth examining the specific

15

judgments Congress made in 1986.

And the --

16

On the employer's side -- and, after all,

17

this is a situation in which the concern here is that

18

the employer is in a position of being the exploiter and

19

the -- the alien of being the exploited -- on the

20

employer's side, Congress said that states may not

21

impose criminal sanctions, and even -- and the Federal

22

government will not impose criminal sanctions for the

23

hiring of employees, unless there's a pattern or

24

practice.

25

It seems quite incongruous to think that
73
Alderson Reporting Company

1

Congress, having made that judgment and imposed those

2

restrictions on the employer's side, would have left

3

states free to impose criminal liability on employees

4

merely for seeking work, for doing what you, I think,

5

would expect most otherwise law-abiding people to do,

6

which is to find a job, so they can feed their families.

7

So I think that's -- that's a significant problem.

8
9

The -- in addition, Congress made clear in
the law that the I-9 form could not be used for any

10

other purpose than prosecutions for violation of the

11

Federal antifraud requirements.

12

to leave states free to impose criminal sanctions on

13

employees for seeking work, they wouldn't have done

14

that, it seems to me.

15

And, if Congress wanted

So there, I think there are strong

16

indicators in the text that Congress did make a

17

judgment, and the judgment was this far and no farther.

18

And it's reasonable that Congress would have done so,

19

for the same kinds of foreign relations concerns that I

20

was discussing with -- with respect to Section 3.

would be an extraordinary thing to put someone in jail

Now, of course, there is an express

1

provision, as this Court has said many times, does not

2

operate to the exclusion of implied preemption, field or

3

conflict.

So we do think those principles apply here.

4

We think there's a reason why the express

5

preemption provision was limited to the employer's side,

6

which is that, after DeCanas, laws had been enacted on

7

the employer's side, and with -- Congress was making

8

clear that those were preemptive, there were no laws on

9

the employee's side at the time and, therefore, no

10

reason for preemption.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

17

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

18
19

MR. CLEMENT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

20

I'd like to start, briefly, with the

21

enforcement issues and then talk about the other

22

provisions.

23

enforcement provision, since I do think that the

24

Government's rather unusual theory that something that's

25

okay when done ad hoc becomes preempted when it's

The last thing I'll say about the

75
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

systematic.

I think that theory largely refutes itself.
But I will say one thing, which is to just

3

echo that there is no interference with enforcement

4

priorities by simply giving the Federal government

5

information on which to bring their enforcement

6

priorities to bear.

7

point this Court made in its Florence decision earlier

8

this month, which is that, sometimes, you pull somebody

9

over for the most innocuous of infractions, and they

10
11

And this is really illustrated by a

turn out to be the most serious of offenders.
And so if you preclude officers, as happened

12

in Phoenix, from communicating with the Federal

13

government, the Federal government will not be able to

14

identify the worst of the worst.

15

example of this, look at the declaration of Officer

16

Brett Glidewell at Joint Appendix 183 to 186.

17

somebody over in a routine traffic stop and was shot by

18

the individual.

19

And if you want an

He pulled

Now, the individual, it turns out, was

20

21

23

24

25

He

Now, if it had been, he certainly
In at least two of the

1

the city policy, city of Phoenix.

2

Now, if the state, I submit, can do

3

anything, it can, at the state level, override those

4

kind of local policies and say, that's not what we want.

5

Community policing is all well and good, but we want to

6

maximize communication with the Federal authorities.

7

I think the enforcement policy and priorities argument

8

simply doesn't work.

9

So

As to Section 3, two points about that, one

10

is, I respectfully disagree with the Solicitor General

11

as to whether the various things that he led off -- read

12

off, the litany of situations where somebody is --

13

technically doesn't have registration would be a

14

violation of 1306(a).
And the reason I take that position is that

15
16

provision says a willful failure to register.

17

maybe the prosecutors take the view that there is

18

willfulness in those circumstances, but I don't think

19

many judges would.

20

you've been told by the Federal government that you're

21

perfectly fine here and you don't need to register, that

22

that would be good enough to defeat a finding of

23

willfulness.

24
25

Now,

I think they would say that, if

So I don't think 1306(a) covers this case.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But you're inviting --

you're inviting the very sort of conflict that he's
77
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

talking about because what's going to happen, now, is

2

that, if there is no statement by the Federal agency of

3

legality, the person is arrested, and, now, we're going

4

to have Federal resources spent on trying to figure out

5

whether they have an asylum application, whether they

6

have this, whether they have that, whether they are

7

exempted under this reason, whether the failure to carry

8

was accidental or not -- I mean, you are involving the

9

Federal government in your prosecution.

10

MR. CLEMENT:

Well --

11

14

person wasn't registered?
MR. CLEMENT:

15

That we

No, we're going to say that we

16

communicated with the Federal immigration officials, and

17

they told us this is somebody who's perfectly fine and

18

doesn't have to register.

With relying on a call to a Federal agency and

MR. CLEMENT:

My supposition, Justice
78

I do want to be clear about --

MR. CLEMENT:

And they bring a prosecution

16

There might be a challenge in that case.

19

I -Who do they get it from?

I mean -- you

I'm not going to try

What I would like to say is two things.

20

One, if there is some sloppiness in the way the Federal

21

government keeps its records, so that there's lots of

22

people that really should be registered, but aren't, I

23

can't imagine that sloppiness has a preemptive effect.

24

The second thing I would say is that I do

25

think, in thinking about Section 3 in particular, the
79
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

analogy is not the fraud on the FDA claim in Buckman.

2

It's really the state tort law that says that it's a

3

violation of state tort law to not even seek the

4

approval that's needed under the FDA for a device.

5

Now, states impose tort law for people that

6

market a device without getting the necessary approval.

7

And nobody thinks that's preempted because it serves the

8

Federal interest.

9

information.

It doesn't have a deluge of

It forces people to get FDA approval.
And in the same way, this state law will

10
11

force people to register, which is what the Federal

12

government is supposed to want in the first place, so

13

there is no preemption there.

14
15

As to the employment provision, I do think
it's important to recognize that --

16
17

There is no conflict.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
