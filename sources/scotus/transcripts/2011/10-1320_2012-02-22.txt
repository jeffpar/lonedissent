Mr. Sloan.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CLIFFORD M. SLOAN

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

We'll hear argument

MR. SLOAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

The question in this case is whether the

11

jury foreperson's announcement that the jury had voted

12

unanimously that Petitioner was not guilty of capital

13

murder and first-degree murder has double jeopardy

14

consequences.

15

two reasons.

We respectfully submit that it does, for

16

First, the foreperson's announcement on this

17

record establishes an acquittal; and, second, even if it

18

is not viewed as an acquittal, under this Court's

19

well-established standard, there was not manifest

20

necessity for a second trial on the same murder charges.

21

Now, with regard to the acquittal, the

22

reasons why the foreperson's announcement was an

23

acquittal are twofold:

24

announcement was clear and explicit that the jury had

25

voted unanimously against guilt; and, second --

First, the foreperson's

Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is that -- is that

2

altogether clear, because she first said -- didn't she

3

first say that the jury cannot agree on any one charge?

4

MR. SLOAN:

Yes, Your Honor.

And then the

5

court specifically asked what is the count on capital

6

murder?

7

the count on first-degree murder?

8

that.

9

Arkansas Supreme Court here observed that the foreperson

And she said unanimous against that.

What is

Unanimous against

And both the Arkansas trial court and the

10

has been explicit that the jury had voted unanimously

been announced.

time.

Unless that

She just said how we voted the last

MR. SLOAN:

With regard to finality, Your

19

Honor, I think that -- that the jury could have changed

20

its mind, but I want to emphasize the reason I say that

21

because I think it highlights something very important

22

that is conspicuously absent here; and three brief

23

points on that, Your Honor.

24
25

First, when the foreperson announced that
the jury had voted unanimously against guilt on the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

5
1

murder charges, she was announcing a jury decision.

2

There was nothing equivocal or qualified about that.

3

Second, Your Honor --

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Excuse me.

Excuse me.

5

When you say she was announcing a decision, then you

6

mean they can't go back on it?

7
8
9
10

MR. SLOAN:

No, that was -- well, that's

my second -JUSTICE SCALIA:
MR. SLOAN:

Yes.

She was announcing a vote.
She was announcing the

11

decision that they had made at that point.

12

reason -- my second point, Your Honor, the reason why I

13

say that they could have gone back is the historic

14

traditional principle that a jury can correct or revise

15

a verdict while it continues to be sitting.

16

But the

Now, in this Court's opinion, in Smith v.

17

Massachusetts, this Court talked about that traditional

18

and historic principle, cited an English case from 1824,

19

the Parkin case, where the jury had done that, had gone

20

back after announcing a verdict.

21

play out here, if the jury came back and they said, you

22

know, we were unanimous before, but now one juror says

23

that he doesn't really agree with that, then, of course,

24

a court could take that into account.

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

And how that would

I think you've conceded away

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

6
1

your case when you say that.

2

a verdict that seems perfectly clear to me is that it is

3

final.

4

The one characteristic of

The jury can't render a verdict and be

5

discharged and then come back the next day and say, you

6

know what, some of us -- one of us has changed his mind

7

or her mind.

8

the critical question here whether what the -- what the

9

foreperson said was this is our final vote, we're not

It's the final vote.

And so, why isn't

10

going to go back, this is it; or this is the way we

11

voted now, and it's -- one or more of us may have wanted

12

to -- wanted to retain the right, reserve the right, to

13

go back and -- and vote again.

14

MR. SLOAN:

Because the -- the reason why I

15

think the announcement was an acquittal here is twofold:

16

First, there was the explicit statement of -- of what

17

the vote was at that time; but, second, there is nothing

18

on the record in this case that contradicts that

19

statement.

20

the time the trial ended, the jury had said nothing that

21

contradicted that earlier statement.

22

At the time the jury was discharged and at

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Suppose the -- suppose the

23

court said, after this colloquy, I want you to go back

24

and think about this whole case again.

25

then have revisited the first count?

6

Well --

Yes.
And the judge said I want

you to deliberate more about this entire case.

(A) was

10

he permitted to do that under Arkansas law, I guess is

11

one of my real questions.

12

MR. SLOAN:

Oh.

Well, in terms -- in terms

13

of Arkansas law and the particular transition

14

instructions here, no, we don't think that the

15

transition instructions operate that way, Your Honor.

16

There's nothing in the instructions that say that --

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Nothing -- nothing --

18

Arkansas law doesn't permit the jury to -- before it's

19

delivered its final formal verdict, to think about the

20

case again and vote on it again?

21

MR. SLOAN:

No.

It -- it does, Your Honor,

22

and that's why I'm trying to draw a distinction between

23

how the transition instructions here operate, the sort

24

of acquittal-first instructions, and the general

25

principle that a jury can correct or revise its verdict.

Alderson Reporting Company

I mean, in a sense, one way to think about --

Well -It's mid-deliberation, as

19

and they went out again.

20

recognized that the jury could have then said we'll go

21

back to square one, we'll consider capital murder,

22

first-degree murder.

23

And I think you have

So, they -- I think you recognize that after

24

the judge gives them a charge of this kind, they can

25

begin all over again.

And here, when they came in and

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

9
1

said we -- we can't agree, defense counsel didn't ask to

2

have the jury polled.

3

MR. SLOAN:

The -- the defense counsel asked

4

for verdict forms to be sent into the jury room that

5

would allow them to record their verdicts on the murder

6

charges.

7

Honor, because it was the State that prevented any

8

additional elucidation about what the jury thought on

9

the murder charges.

10

And that's a very important point here, Your

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But that -- so long as it's

11

still tentative thoughts, it doesn't matter.

12

could have -- suppose the jury went back after this

13

announcement -- you know, we -- you know, we've decided

14

on a -- on the greater charge, or we voted on the

15

greater charge for the defendant.

16

and one of the people who wants to convict on the lesser

17

charge, as to which they are deadlocked, finally says,

18

well, look it, if you won't come along to convict him on

19

the lesser charge, by God, I'm not -- I'm not going to

20

acquit on the greater charge.

21
22

Suppose they go back

Isn't that the kind of stuff that goes on in
jury rooms all the time?

23

MR. SLOAN:

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

The jury

Yes, it does, Your Honor.
So, there is no certainty

whatever that -- that what was the vote at that time

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

10
1
2

would be the vote when they finally got done.
MR. SLOAN:

Well, but, Your Honor, on the

3

record as the case comes to this Court, what you have is

4

this very clear and explicit statement against guilt on

5

the murder charges and then nothing in what the jury

6

says when it comes back that contradicts that --

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9

Well, I guess one -Counsel, I thought that

part of your argument was that, given the instructions

10

in this case, which the jury appears to have followed to

11

the T, they can't get to a lesser count unless they've

12

acquitted on the preceding count.

13

MR. SLOAN:

Yes.

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

When the judge asks

15

them, did you reach criminal negligence, they say we

16

were told not to.

17

Now, the judge, whether he was right or

18

wrong under Hughes as to whether they followed the

19

instructions or he misunderstood them, I don't know.

20

But it's very clear in context from the government's

21

arguments to the jury, to the defense argument to the

22

jury, you don't reach the split count or even talk about

23

it unless you've been acquitted.

24

So, given that the jury responds at the end

25

we haven't reached a verdict, and the jury said earlier

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

11
1

that they hadn't reached a verdict on the one issue,

2

isn't the -- the only assumption is that they didn't go

3

back?

4

MR. SLOAN:

Yes, I think that's exactly

5

right, Your Honor, because the jury instructions very

6

explicitly said that you don't go to a lesser offense

7

unless you have a reasonable doubt on the greater

8

offense.

9

The State -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, it's --

10

MR. SLOAN: -- over and over --

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

12

I'm sorry.

Go

ahead.

13

MR. SLOAN:

I was just going to say the

14

State over and over again in its closing argument said

15

to the jury you cannot reach a lesser offense unless you

16

unanimously find the defendant not guilty on the greater

17

offense.

18

Court in the Hughes case has said that the law in

19

Arkansas is that you don't get to a lesser offense

20

unless -- the jury doesn't get to a lesser offense

21

unless it in essence acquits on the greater offense.

22

And as you point out, the Arkansas Supreme

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Right, but that's

23

the final say.

You don't know what the jury did as a

24

preliminary matter.

25

this perfectly reasonable for the jury to say:

I would think it in a case like

Alderson Reporting Company

Let's

Official

12
1

take a preliminary vote; we'll go down; and if -- if we

2

all agree on something right away, that's what we'll do.

3

Does everybody agree on capital murder?

4

some don't.

5

everybody agree on manslaughter?

6

know that manslaughter, he's at least guilty.

7

go back and talk about the more serious offense, and

8

some of us will try to persuade the holdouts.

9

Does everybody agree on murder?
Yes.

No.

Does

Okay, we all
Now let's

And yet, you would say as soon as they

10

reached the point of saying, yes, he's guilty on

11

manslaughter, they can't go back.

12

No,

MR. SLOAN:

Well, the instructions don't

13

provide for them to -- for them to go back.

14

which had never made that argument until this Court in

15

this litigation, that they can go back, doesn't point to

16

any case that --

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The State,

Well, but then I'm not

18

sure it's just a matter of State law then, we're --

19

what we're doing here is talking about the

20

constitutional minimum.

21

hypothetical, you can have a more -- even a more

22

principled juror than that.

23

we're thinking about manslaughter, it is true that thus

24

and so happened; maybe we were wrong on the first --

25

first-degree count.

And I -- Justice Scalia gave a

He says, you know, now that

I mean, that's perfectly plausible.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

13
1

MR. SLOAN:

Well, let me say, whatever one

2

thinks about finality -- and I do think there was

3

sufficient finality here for the reasons we have been

4

discussing, but whatever one thinks about finality,

5

let's consider this in the context of manifest necessity

6

because whatever one thinks of finality, I submit that

7

it is clear that when a jury foreperson stands up in

8

front of the jury, in front of the defendant, lawyers

9

for both sides, and says we have voted unanimously that

10

he is not guilty of these murder charges, that is

11

something at the very core of the Double Jeopardy

12

Clause --

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

14

MR. SLOAN:

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

Are you saying --

-- at the heartland of it.
Are you saying that there

16

was no manifest necessity to declare a mistrial as to

17

any count, in which case there could be no retrial

18

whatsoever, or no manifest necessity to declare a

19

mistrial on capital murder?

20

latter, then what would you have us do with the decision

21

by the Arkansas Supreme Court that Arkansas law does not

22

allow a partial verdict?

23

MR. SLOAN:

And if you're saying the

Okay.

Your Honor, so, first I'm

24

saying only that there was no manifest necessity as to

25

capital murder and first-degree murder, which were the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

14
1

two charges on which they were unanimous.

2

can be retried on manslaughter and negligent homicide.

3

We agree he

Now, as to the Arkansas Supreme Court

4

decision on that -- and that brings up a very important

5

point because the State's position essentially is it

6

could never be final enough, as Your Honor suggests,

7

because it simply is impermissible under Arkansas law to

8

have an acquittal on a greater offense as long as you're

9

deadlocked on a lesser offense.

10

And as to that, this Court's opinions are

11

clear that if you have a State law that prevents giving

12

effect to what is in substance an acquittal, it must

13

yield to the Federal constitutional command of the

14

Double Jeopardy Clause.

15

And Hudson v. Louisiana is very instructive

16

on this point because, in Hudson, Louisiana had a law

17

that after a conviction, a judge could not enter an

18

acquittal order; he could only enter a new trial order.

19

And after the conviction on murder in Hudson, the judge

20

entered a new trial order and explained that it was

21

because of insufficient evidence.

22

And this Court unanimously said that that

23

substantively was an acquittal; it has full double

24

jeopardy consequences, notwithstanding the fact that

25

Louisiana law does not allow a judge to enter an

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

15
1

acquittal order --

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

What's bothering me is I

3

can't figure this out very well.

4

State, and what the State says to the jury:

5

have three choices.

6

person of everything.

7

something.

8
9

We have an imaginary
Jury, you

Choice one is you acquit this
Choice two is you convict him of

Choice three is you say you're hung.

Okay?

I don't see anything in the Constitution
that prevents a State from doing that.

So, if that --

10

if no -- what is it?

11

that, there was no acquittal on those early charges.

12

That wasn't a permissible verdict.

13

structure your argument any way you want, but that

14

the State has -- I would think, within the limits of due

15

process, it can structure the jury's arguments as it

16

wishes.

17

And, of course, if you follow

And now you

But -- so, what's wrong with that?

And if

18

that -- if there's nothing wrong with that, then how do

19

you win?

20

MR. SLOAN:

Okay, Your Honor.

Two points:

21

One that focuses on the jury foreperson's announcement

22

here --

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, you could say, well,

24

you could -- well, that's one route.

25

nothing wrong with that.

What you say is

But if the judge is foolish

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

16
1

enough to get the jury -- to get the foreperson to say

2

what the state of the deliberation is in detail, then

3

the Double Jeopardy Clause kicks in.

4

argument.

5

MR. SLOAN:

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, that's an

Well, Your Honor -So, they make a mistake and

7

now suddenly it’s jeopardy where it wasn't before,

8

or -- this seems like a minor matter compared to the

9

issues of jeopardy, whether the jury honestly said what

10

was going on in the room, particularly if it's

11

changeable.

12

MR. SLOAN:

With respect, Your Honor, I

13

disagree that it's a minor matter when a foreperson

14

stands up, with the jury present, and says we have voted

15

not guilty.

16

example, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court

17

decision in the Roth case, which is in the briefs, is

18

instructive because in that case the Massachusetts court

19

said very emphatically you should not ask a jury that

20

kind of question, but --

21
22

And as to that, with an announcement -- for

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

So, let's -- go

ahead.

23

MR. SLOAN:

But -- may I just finish --

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

MR. SLOAN:

Please.

-- the sentence, Your Honor?

Alderson Reporting Company

17
1

But in that case, the trial court had asked

2

the jury, and the foreperson had said that they had

3

voted against guilt on the greater offenses.

4

the Massachusetts court said, if the -- essentially,

5

these are my words -- but if the Double Jeopardy Clause

6

means anything, it means that when you have an

7

announcement like that, it has to matter.

8
9

And so,

And the other point, Your Honor, is that
this Court's opinions such as Fong Foo and Sanabria say

10

that it doesn't matter if an acquittal is on an

11

erroneous basis.

12

jeopardy consequence to it.

13

the judge shouldn't have asked the question and it would

14

have been permissible not to ask the question, once he

15

did and once that's on the record, that is of

considerable constitutional --

Only if -Why should there -Only if -- and I think this

20

is the premise of your argument.

Only if there is a

21

constitutional necessity to -- to sever the various

22

charges, there is a constitutional necessity to let the

23

jury come in on one charge without coming in on the

24

other.

25

argument.

It seems to me that's the premise of your
And I don't know where that constitutional

Alderson Reporting Company

18
1

necessity comes from.

2

MR. SLOAN:

Well, Your Honor, first, on the

3

manifest necessity point, when there is an

4

announcement like this, because --

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Your manifest necessity

6

depends upon the necessity of severing, yes.

7

sever, then there is no manifest necessity of

8

resubmitting the greater charge.

9

assumes a severing, and I don't know where the severing

10
11

If you

But it assumes -- it

comes from.
MR. SLOAN:

The -- the manifest necessity

12

argument is that when there is an announcement like this

13

that goes right to the core of double jeopardy -- and,

14

you know, we know that with greater and lesser included

15

offenses, if there is a basis for an acquittal, then

16

that has to be given effect on the separate charges.

17

That's Green and Price.

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But that's -- but that's

19

after a verdict.

Why is it that the purposes of the

20

Double Jeopardy Clause are implicated when a jury,

21

before it delivers a final verdict, says where -- where

22

it is mid -- mid-deliberations?

23

course, is terribly disappointed if they go back and

for the jury to come to a different verdict, but he

doesn't have to prepare the defense again; he doesn't

3

have to go to trial again.

4

It's all one trial.

I don't see why there's a double jeopardy

5

interest in the Massachusetts case that you point out.

6

I don't see where the double jeopardy interest was in

7

saying that you can't go back.

8

MR. SLOAN:

Well, because --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I've -- if I read what those States are

saying, including the Massachusetts State that you point

14

to, it's a very simple rule.

15

past it or around it or -- I think what they say is,

once the jury announces an acquittal, then that's the

substance; the person's been acquitted once they've made

matter if it's entered properly, if the jury is polled,

15

if anything happens.

17

As far back as 1896, Ball said the

18

MR. SLOAN:

Yes.

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Yes, Your Honor.
And I thought I heard

20

you arguing that here the lack of manifest necessity was

21

that the judge had heard they reached that verdict.

22

MR. SLOAN:

Well --

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Renico v. Lett in 2010, have emphasized the judge has to

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DUSTIN MCDANIEL

MR. MCDANIEL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

There are three key reasons why jeopardy has

resumed its deliberations.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

10

First, the jury was free

Thus -Where does it say that in

the jury charge?

11

MR. MCDANIEL:

I think that there's a

12

critical misunderstanding by Petitioner of Arkansas's

13

jury instructions, and there's a lot of use of -- of

14

titles, such as "acquittal first" or "hard transition"

15

or "soft transition."

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, as I understand what

17

the Arkansas instructions said, what the instructions in

18

this case said, is that the jury unanimously had to have

19

a reasonable doubt on an offense before it could go down

20

to the next offense.

21

unanimously had to find what is -- what leads to an

22

acquittal.

23

the greater offense before it could go down to the next.

up?

11

MR. MCDANIEL:

Well, there are three primary

reasons.

One, in States that are acquittal-first

States, States that truly require a resolution of each

charge before the transition to subsequent charges, they

15

use words like "unanimous."

But there is no requirement of a

In fact, Justice Breyer's example of a given

State is exactly what Arkansas does, as compared to a --

a true acquittal-first State, where there are multiple

jeopardy or terminating jeopardy at that point.

the charge of murder in the first degree.

16

If you have a reasonable doubt of the defendant's

juror is going to think they can go to the next count.

court has said has to happen.

I'm a little confused,

says you can't move on to the next one unless it's

Did you?

21

Did you reach acquittal?

MR. MCDANIEL:

Did you reach a

Well, there are a couple of

22

reasons.

One, I think it's fair to say that the State

23

recognizes it was improper for the judge to inquire in

24

the way that he did.

25

he recognized that it was improper, as he didn't do it

I think that it's fair to say that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

34

on their first announcement of deadlock and he didn't do

2

it on their final announcement of deadlock.

3

It's important to note that, although

4

defense counsel at trial did ask for revised verdict

5

forms, that was not her initial reaction.

6

reaction was to say, judge, I think that the jury needs

7

to go back and keep deliberating, and I would ask that

8

9

reaction that anyone would have if they had just heard

Her initial

That's not the

an acquittal of their client.

This was, in fact, a

11

mid-deliberation report, probably wrongfully elicited by

12

the trial judge, but it was just that, a snapshot in

13

time with no intent by the jury to make an announcement.

14

So, when they returned, the real question, I

15

think, hinges -- as this Court analyzed in Smith v.

16

Massachusetts, is, is it possible for there to be

17

revision?

18

to be the entirety of the jury completely pivoting in

19

their decisions.

20

we recognize that, even after they have announced

21

unanimously, signed a verdict form, offered their

22

assent, if they're polled in the box and one person

23

changes their vote, then that bears the effect of

24

changing the verdict.

25

And it doesn't, in fact, Justice Kagan, have

All it would have to be is one.

So, is it possible?

Is that right?

That is correct, Justice

That is correct.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

I guess, General McDaniel,

one question about what Arkansas law does is -- it seems

10

a little bit as if it's trying to get the sweet of an

11

acquittal for a State without the bitter.

12

is an acquittal-first system, where you force a jury to

13

reach agreement on one thing before it goes to the next

14

thing, makes compromised jury verdicts harder, and

15

that's why a State might say we want an acquittal-first

16

system.

So, the sweet

17

The bitter that most States take with that

18

is that they say, well, if we're forcing them to agree

19

on these things and they agree on a verdict of not

20

guilty, we're stuck with that.

21

Now, what Arkansas seems to want is a system

22

in which it forces juries to agree on the -- the greater

23

charges before going to the less, but won't take the

24

consequence of that, which is that sometimes they agree

25

that on the greater charges, they're not guilty.

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. MCDANIEL:

No, Justice Kagan.

The --

the majority of the States and circuits recognize there

3

is a difference between a hard-transition instruction

4

and an acquittal-first instruction.

5

difference between a partial verdict and a general

6

verdict on charges that include lesser and includeds.

7

And what we require is one verdict on a charge:

They recognize the

We know when jeopardy attaches.

as this Court noted in Smith, it's the availability;

it's the incorporation within a State's procedure for

that finality to be undone.

MR. MCDANIEL:

I think what Arkansas law

actually says is how we should be judged, but at the

to answer questions about the status of their

that they were in fact giving the judge some

instructions on how the instructions should work.

In Green and Price, the

defendants were tried once on the greater offense, and

jeopardy terminated without a finding of manifest

necessity regarding the termination of jeopardy.

that is the sound basis for those decisions.

to agree with what Justice Kagan said.

moment whatsoever.

21

Now, there is no opinion of this Court that

22

were to say that in an opinion, it would open the door

4

so, it just says we're not going to accept that.

5

And something that's a very real and

A

6

practical danger here, which this Court has emphasized

over and over again in opinions, is giving the State the

8

opportunity to refine and hone its case based on what it
