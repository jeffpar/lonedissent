ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

8

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

9
10

MR. CLEMENT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

The judicial maps drawn here are truly

12

remarkable.

13

court below lost sight of first principles.

14

repeatedly invoked the principle that these were only

15

interim maps and not remedial maps, but that obscures

16

the reality that a court has the authority to draw an

17

election map, surely one of the most powerful judicial

18

tools in the judicial arsenal, only if it is identifying

19

specific statutory or constitutional violations or a

20

substantial likelihood thereof.

21

They reflect the reality that the district

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The court

Mr. Clement, section 5

22

says you can't draw new maps unless they've been

23

precleared.

You can't put them into effect.

24

MR. CLEMENT:

But --

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So, the only thing that

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

exists is old maps until you get the preclearance.

2

I don't see how we can give deference to an

3

enacted new map, if section 5 says don't give it effect

4

until it's been precleared.

5

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Sotomayor,

6

obviously, section 5 is clear that the new map drawn by

7

the Texas legislature, the new maps drawn by the Texas

8

legislature, cannot take effect of their own force.

9

that doesn't answer the question of whether a judge,

But

10

when having to impose a remedial map to address what all

11

concede is a one-person, one-vote problem with the

12

benchmark maps, can look to the new maps which also

13

remedy that same one-person, one-vote problem, for

14

guidance.

And this Court in its -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

15

But you're asking for

16

more than for guidance.

17

You're saying they have to start with the new map even

18

though that map hasn't been approved.

19

MR. CLEMENT:

20

You're asking for deference.

That's right, Your Honor.

think they --

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Instead of starting, as

22

the court below did, with the old map which had been

23

approved.

24
25

We

MR. CLEMENT:

Right.

We are -- in fairness,

we're asking for it to be used as the starting point for

drawing the new map, but that's because --

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

3

Doesn't that turn

section 5 on its head?

4

MR. CLEMENT:

No, I don't think so, Your

5

Honor, for a number of reasons.

One is that the

6

obligation to go to the preclearance court or to go to

7

the Attorney General remains fully in place.

8

only question is, what is going to inform the district

9

court in Texas's exercise of remedial authority to

So, the

10

remedy the one-person, one-vote problem with the

11

remedial plans -- with the benchmark plans, rather?

12

Now, this Court from the very beginning of

13

its reapportionment cases has emphasized the need to

14

look for legislative guidance in order to inform the

15

judicial exercise of solving that reapportionment

16

problem.

17

is most acute, of course, with the congressional maps

18

because the benchmark is -- is a fine map, but it's a

19

map for 32 seats.

20

of Texas has spoken as to how it would like to divide

21

the new 36-seat allocation up.

22

odd that the court would simply ignore that judgment

23

when it could look to that as the starting point.

24

And the need to look to the new maps I think

25

And Congress here -- the legislature

JUSTICE GINSBURG:
ignore it.

And it seems to be quite

It didn't -- it didn't

4

suppose we accept your position.

5

this proceeding.

6

court says this -- this plan -- these plans do not meet

7

the section 5 requirement; we deny preclearance.

8

happens if we use the Texas plan that has not been

9

precleared as the interim plan?

10

My -- Mr. Clement, suppose the D.C. court that

And suppose -You prevail in -- in

And then the three-judge district

MR. CLEMENT:

What

Well, Justice Ginsburg, as a

11

practical matter, I suppose at that point Appellees

12

would go to the court in Texas and say you need to

13

revise your interim maps once again.

14

Now, I think, since the premise for the

15

court drawing its interim maps is that time is of the

16

essence, it can't wait any longer, the Texas court may

17

deny that motion or it may grant that motion.

18

don't -- I don't really have a crystal ball to take that

19

into account.

20

I mean, I

But what I do think is particularly

21

anomalous is let's suppose that the D.C. court does deny

22

preclearance.

23

the plan, the legislatively enacted plan, even though

24

it's denied preclearance, would be something that the

25

Texas court would have to defer to.

At that point, it's common ground that

The Attorney General said the rest of it was okay.

8

the entire plan -- the plans are -- are opposed.

9

That was a plan -- there were two
There was a problem with them.

MR. CLEMENT:

Here

Well, Justice Ginsburg, I mean

10

it's true that the Justice Department does raise a

11

purpose objection to the plans as a whole, but of course

12

even that takes its force from the way particular

13

districts are being drawn.

14

that -- you know, obviously, our position is that the

15

D.C. court is most likely to grant preclearance.

16

they were to deny it, it seems quite likely that they

17

would deny it as to particular districts.

18

Upham would make clear that you would give -- that the

19

Texas court would give deference to the legislative

20

plan.

21

It seems to me quite likely

But if

And then

And the anomaly of the other side's position

22

is you give less deference to a plan when preclearance

23

is pending than you do when preclearance is denied.

24
25

JUSTICE ALITO:
about timing?

Can I ask you a question

Let's suppose that the district court in
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Washington moves expeditiously and issues a decision in

2

mid-February.

3

postponing the Texas primary so that the plan that is to

4

be used can -- doesn't have to be formulated until after

5

the district court in Washington has ruled?

6

Texas has a very early primary.

7

have them for congressional races in -- in the fall, and

8

the latest presidential primary I think is at the end of

9

June.

Are there insuperable problems with

Some States

So, why can't this all be pushed back, and

10

wouldn't that eliminate a lot of the problems that we

11

are grappling with in this case?

12

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Alito, two --

13

two answers:

14

affected, you know, entities in Texas have gotten

15

together, and they've agreed on the ability to move the

16

primary back to April, given -- on the assumption that a

17

map could be in place by February 1st.

18

One is, as a practical matter, all of the

Now, you know, the primary has been moved

19

from March to April already.

So, I can't tell you that

20

it's impossible to move it again, but it's also quite,

21

you know, in a sense -- I mean, the question becomes --

22

I mean, Texas has made its own determination that it

23

wants to have a relatively early primary.

24

something it cocked up for this set of elections.

25

had that in place since at least 1988.
9
Alderson Reporting Company

That's not

And so, the

It's

Official

1

question is how much do you want to interfere with that

2

judgment?

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, if we have a binary

4

choice, if it's either the plan enacted by the Texas

5

legislature or the plan that's already been drawn up by

6

the court, yes, that could be presumably resolved rather

quickly.

But what if neither of those is fully
Then is it -- is it practicable to have the
And if not,

10

then wouldn't -- would you just prefer to limit us to

11

those two possibilities or would Texas entertain the

12

possibility of moving the primary back?

13

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, look, Texas wants the

14

Court to have the opportunity to get this right.

15

think the decision below is profoundly wrong.

16

it's important for this Court to send a clear signal to

17

the courts that would provide relief not just in this

18

case but to future situations where this arose.

6

decisions work?

7

Does it -- in other
How do these

That's what I'm asking.

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I don't think there's a

8

road map for the extent to which they give a road map.

9

I think there are two things that are crystal clear.

10

One is that when the D.C. authority, be it the Attorney

11

General or the court, denies preclearance, it denies

12

preclearance.

13

such thing as preclearance in part or partial

14

preclearance.

15

doesn't work like a line item veto.

16

The plan is not precleared.

There's no

As the Justice Department puts it, it

Now, that's not to say -- and here's the second

17

point.

That's not to say that the court doesn't provide

18

reasoning for its decision, or the Attorney General.

19

And that's why in Upham, for example, that the Court --

20

this Court knew that the objections were to two

21

particular districts, even though the effect in Upham

22

was to not preclear the whole plan.

23

the mistake of the district court is it effectively

24

treats the un-precleared plan as a nullity.

25

the exact word that Judge Johnson used in the lower
11
Alderson Reporting Company

And it seems to me

And that's

Official

1

court opinion in Upham.

2

And this Court reversed because it said no,

3

you don't ignore that, but on the other hand, what you

4

do is you take into account the judgment of the Attorney

5

General in that case; but other than that, you take the

6

plan into account notwithstanding the fact that it

7

hasn't been precleared.

8
9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But we've said over and

over, Mr. Clement, that it's the Attorney General and

10

the district court in D.C. that have exclusive

11

jurisdiction over this set of questions and that we

12

don't want courts in other part of the country to try to

13

mimic what those -- what that court and the Attorney

14

General are supposed to do.
And you're essentially asking for the

15
16

district court in the State of Texas to try to predict

17

what they're going to do and to mimic what they're going

18

to do.

19

look, if we've said that only the district court in D.C.

20

and the Attorney General should do this, let's wait

21

until they do it and go from there.

22

And that's why Justice Alito suggests, well,

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Kagan, here's

23

why we're -- we're not asking the regional court to

24

mimic the D.C. court's function.

25

perform correctly the one -- one of the roles that this

We're asking it to

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Court has always made clear the regional court retains.

2

And that's to provide temporary relief.

3

If you look at this Court's decisions that

4

essentially warn off a regional court from arrogating to

5

itself the final preclearance decision -- I'm thinking,

6

for example, of Connor v. Waller -- those same decisions

7

say:

8

provide temporary relief.

But this is not with prejudice to your ability to

9

Now, our position is quite simple.

If we're

10

in a situation where the regional court has to provide

11

temporary relief, then it should apply the same

12

standards that always apply everywhere to courts issuing

13

temporary relief.

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But you're not taking into

15

account the fact that, as Justice Sotomayor said,

16

section 5 itself operates as an injunction.

17

injunction against the use of an un-precleared plan.

18

MR. CLEMENT:

And it's an

Justice Kagan, I think we are

19

taking that into account.

I mean -- and I think that's

20

at the heart of what's going on here.

21

yourself the question:

22

Texas court in this case was trying -- what is the

23

violation, rather, that the Texas court was trying to

24

25

proceeds on the assumption as if the violation is a

section 5 violation.

But that's not what motivated the

2

court's opinion, and you can -- I mean, look at page 96

3

of the Joint Appendix, where the court specifically

4

says:

5

6

times in the house plan, the State house plan, and

14

16

things like:

But the oddity of their position is their

first premise, which is the one thing we can't do in

un-precleared map.

7

that premise was right, why would it be even a good

8

thing that they were pointing to the other map.

There's no explanation for why -- if

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

district, a head and two unconnected antlers on top,

13

nothing tying them together.

I don't understand what principle, what

23

You're saying they should have given deference to an

24

oddly shaped district that changed a prior benchmark

25

that's been challenged as having been created

All of the challenges that relate to El Paso

5

principle they violated, other than the deference

6

principle that you're relying upon?

7

The district court has already

MR. CLEMENT:

Tell me what legal

The basic principle they

8

violated is they drew an interim order that they thought

9

wasn't a remedial order without it being based on any

10

finding of substantial likelihood of a violation.

MR. CLEMENT:

16

That's your second --

You may be right.

You may be

But if the district court had said, you

17

know, there's a problem with this because the two - the

18

two antler -- the deer with two antlers, that violates

19

-- that's a substantial likelihood of violating the

20

Constitution.

21

what they did, this would be a very different case.

22

We're going to remedy that.

If that's

Now, I do want to talk about the deer with

23

two antlers, because what that ignores is that in the

24

benchmark plan, the deer had one antler and an antenna.

25

And so, the district court -- the map the district court
20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

drew doesn't look anything like the benchmark, and

2

actually the map that the legislature drew looks very

3

much like the benchmark.

4

And so, I think that just shows that what

5

was going on here by the district court was something

6

very different from either remedying a one-person,

7

one-vote problem with the benchmark or from correcting

8

specific identified problems with the legislative map.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I had thought, Mr. Clement,

10

that -- that one of your objections was that in deciding

11

whether they're using the benchmark or the -- the

12

legislature's proposed new plan, whichever one they're

13

using, they -- in drawing up their own plan, they

14

assumed the validity of all of the challenges.

15

Is -- is that not the case?

16

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, that is the case, Your

17

Honor, and that is one of the many problems with the way

18

that the court proceeded here.

19

sight of the fact that, look, we only have remedial

20

authority if we're remedying substantial likelihood of

21

violations that are identifiable and particular, well,

22

then what are you going to do?

23

Because once you lose

What this district court did, after he

24

started where Justice Breyer suggested, is that the

25

district court judges then said, look, we want to avoid
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the challenges that are brought by the plaintiffs.

2

what they mean by "avoid" is they basically take all the

3

allegations at face value and then redraw the district

4

to avoid this.

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

At face value.

And

But you

6

don't have any problem -- if I'm a district judge and I

7

think there is a substantial likelihood that a

8

particular challenge will succeed, you don't have any

9

problem with my drawing an interim plan to avoid that

10

likelihood.

11
12

MR. CLEMENT:

Absolutely no problem at

all --

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

14

MR. CLEMENT:

Thank you.

-- Justice Kennedy.

And the

15

great thing about that is that gives the district court

16

a familiar role to play applying familiar standards, and

17

it gives this Court something to review.

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But the district court in

19

that -- in that scenario is projecting what the D.C.

20

court that has exclusive authority is going to do.

21

that's why I find your -- your position troublesome.

22

You're asking one court to make its best guess at what

23

another court is likely to do, and that other court has

24

exclusive jurisdiction.

MR. CLEMENT:

Can I -- can I respond to

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But haven't we also said

that, with respect to section 2 and constitutional

13

violations, that those allegations would be unripe in

14

the -- prior to the district court or the Attorney

15

General clearing a plan?

16

MR. CLEMENT:

Absolutely, Justice Kagan.

17

But I think it's important to understand that to the

18

extent that the district court in this remedial phase

19

should take section 5 into account, it's just in

20

considering whether or not the remedial plan is

21

consistent with section 5 principles.

22

the judges did in this case with respect to their own

23

plan.

24

section 5 that they otherwise wouldn't do.

25

And that's what

So, we're not asking them to do something with

And, again, I think if you come back to the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

particular question of what are they trying to remedy --

2

I mean, they're trying to remedy the one person, one

3

vote problem.

4

remedy, why wouldn't they take into account the

5

legislative policy judgments reflected in the

6

un-precleared plan if that's -- if that's the state

7

we're in, if that's the snapshot we're in.

8
9
10

So, if that's what they're trying to

I mean, keep in mind, this Court has
throughout -JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, just because section 5

11

says that there's no presumption of regularity attached

12

to that plan and, indeed, that it's unlawful to put that

13

plan into effect without the proper approvals.

14

MR. CLEMENT:

Two things, Justice Kagan:

15

One, I would beg to differ that what section 5 says is

16

that there's no presumption of regularity.

17

that's -- it's not just a quibble because I think if

18

what section 5 says is that there's no presumption of

19

regularity or no presumption of good faith, then section

20

5 I think is closer to the constitutional edge than this

21

Court said in Northwest Austin.

22
23
24
25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And I think

I think all it says --

Section 5 says somebody has

to clear it before it can go into effect.
MR. CLEMENT:

Absolutely.

But I don't think

that means that the assumption is that the legislature
24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

didn't act in good faith in enacting the provision.

2

that brings me to my second point --

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And

Nobody said the opposite.

4

The question just is, does somebody have to clear it?

5

Here, it wasn't cleared.

6

MR. CLEMENT:

Okay.

I agree, but then the

7

question is, if there's not a presumption of bad faith,

8

then why wouldn't the court take that legislative

9

judgment into account in drawing its remedy for the one

10

person, one vote violation in the remedial district?

11

If I could add my second point, which is the

12

other thing to keep in mind is the preclearance

13

obligation is not driven by congressional judgment that

14

these covered jurisdictions are particularly bad at

15

remedying one person, one vote problems.

16

Obviously, section 5 is driven by concerns

17

about racial discrimination.

18

particularly odd, given that what's at issue here is a

19

remedy for a one person, one vote problem, that you

20

would assume that you're not going to take into account

21

the legislature's judgment as reflected in an

22

un-precleared plan.

23
24
25

No, I don't think that

In other words, it can't draw its

So, how do we decide between those two -you have two wrong choices.

14

MR. CLEMENT:

How do we end up?

Well, I think you try to split

15

the difference by trying to apply the preliminary

16

injunction standards.

17

what you're going to do is that you're going to ensure

18

that the remedy that the district court draws for -- as

19

an interim matter for the one person, one vote problem,

20

which is not the same thing as preclearance, that remedy

21

is both consistent with the legislative policy judgments

22

but also with section 2, with the Equal Protection

23

Clause.

24
25

And I think if you do that, then

And I suppose if this Court wants to, it can
say that for purposes of interim temporary relief, the
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Court can look at section 5 directly.

I would think the

2

better answer is, no, you just focus it on section 2,

3

the Equal Protection Clause, and then you ensure that

4

the judicial plan is consistent with section 5

5

principles, because that's the test that the Court's

6

going to apply in any event.

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Can you -- can you tell me

8

with reference to the two districts, other than the

9

senate district, congressional and State house

10

districts, did Judge Smith defer or use the -- the Texas

11

legislature's 2011 plan as a benchmark to some extent?

MR. CLEMENT:

I -- I don't think Judge

Smith -- if I can answer your question, I think this

does:

15

we think he should or focused on the benchmark.

16

look at the congressional plan, what he did is he just

basically picked one of the proposals that was a

I don't think Judge Smith did this the way that

4

That doesn't seem quite right.

I mean, if

5

the State really does have persuasive responses, that

6

ought to be enough to not redraw the district.

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So, you would fault his

8

solution for giving insufficient deference to the State

9

of Texas 2011 plan?
MR. CLEMENT:

10

That's right, but it's -- it's

certainly a fair improvement over what the district

SUPPORTING AFFIRMANCE IN PART AND VACATUR IN PART
MR. SRINIVASAN:

Thank you,

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
The fundamental flaw with Texas's approach

23

is that it directly inverts the burden established by

24

section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.

25

the burden on a covered jurisdiction to show that a

Section 5 places

proposed voting change is nondiscriminatory in purpose

and effect, and the change can't go into effect unless

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Let me ask you this:

5

Suppose that this -- all the facts are the same except

6

that this is in a State that is not subject to section

7

5.

8

Would there be a problem in your view with

9

what the district -- with what the district court did,

10

with Judge Smith -- with what Judge Smith did?

11

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, with Judge -- with

12

what Judge Smith did, I guess in that context,

13

Justice Kennedy, there wouldn't be a section 5 issue at

14

all.

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

16

MR. SRINIVASAN:

17

Right.
And all you'd be dealing

with is section 2 or the Equal Protection Clause.

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And then we could -- then

there would be no problem with using Texas as a

benchmark, the Texas 2011 as benchmark, as a starting

21

point?

22

MR. SRINIVASAN:

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

24

MR. SRINIVASAN:

25

Well, I -As a starting point?
Yes.

Well, I guess what I

would say is this, that in the malapportionment context
29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

what this Court typically has said the district court

2

should do is to start with a plan that's already in

3

effect and then modify it according to neutral

4

districting principles to remove the malapportionment

5

issue.

And that's --

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, what are neutral

7

districting principles?

Anybody who draws a map faces

8

at the outset certain legal constraints, constitutional

9

constraints, restrictions that are imposed by the Voting

10

Rights Act, maybe some State law restrictions to the

11

extent they're not inconsistent with Federal law.

12

you've gotten beyond that point, all you have left is

13

districting policy.

14

Once

They're policy choices, and there are many

15

factors that can be taken into account in drawing a map:

16

how compact you want the districts to be, to what extent

17

are you going to respect zones of common economic

18

interests, to what extent are you going to try to

19

preserve old districts, what about incumbents, what

20

about party registration?

21

balance or are you going to try to favor one party or

22

the other?

23

policy.

24
25

Are you going to try to have

That's all -- those are all questions of

And the question is, whose -- who makes
those policy decisions?

Are they going to be the policy
30

decisions that were made by the legislature, or are they

2

going to be the policy decisions made by the district

court?

4

districting principles is a subterfuge.

5

such thing.

6

And to say they're going to apply neutral

MR. SRINIVASAN:

There is no

Well, I guess I would

7

disagree with you, Justice Alito.

8

preliminary observations on what a district court is

9

supposed to do in this regard, and then I'll try to walk

10
11

I want to make two

through the principles that should guide this inquiry.
The first preliminary observation is what a

12

district court is not supposed to do, and what a

13

district court is not supposed to do is to take the

14

un-precleared plan as a given, because section 5

15

forecloses it.

16

Now, what's a district court supposed to do?

17

It's not at sea, contrary to the underpinning of some of

18

the arguments made today, because the district court

19

starts with the last legally enforceable plan, which

20

after all is the last manifestation of State policies

21

and priorities.

22

And then it has to modify that plan, of course, to deal

23

with malapportionment issues and to comply with section

24

2 and section 5 --

25

So, you have that as a starting point.

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I don't want to
31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

interrupt you too much, but even if you do that, even if

2

you start with the old plan and then you modify it to

3

the extent necessary to comply with the Constitution and

4

statutes, there are still -- I'm sure our computer could

5

shoot out dozens and dozens of possible maps, and

6

somebody has to choose among them.

7

does a district judge -- does a district court use in

8

making that choice?

9

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Now, what criteria

There is discretion in the

10

inquiry, Justice Alito.

I'm not going to -- I'm not

going to disagree with that.

districting criteria that had been applied by this

jurisdiction in the past.

25

Now, that's not

But we're not in that situation here,
33
Alderson Reporting Company

1

because what you have is interim maps that have been

2

developed.

3

that you're positing.

4

We're not in the kind of emergency situation

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You acknowledge that there

5

are some situations in which you can use the very plan

6

that the Texas legislature adopted, even though it's not

7

been precleared?

8
9

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Only if there's no time for

a district court to adopt a different plan.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

But --

So, it's no longer an

11

absolute rule.

12

another reasonable exception to a non-absolute rule.

13

So, the question is whether this is

MR. SRINIVASAN:

There is an emergency

14

exception, as there is with all sorts of legal rules.

15

But that's so far as we would go.

16

Now, I would like to address the proposition

17

that what the Court would be doing here under Texas's

18

view is just a standard application of substantial

19

likelihood of success principles, because it's not.

20

It's decidedly different from standard operation of

21

substantial likelihood of success principles in three

22

fundamental respects.

23

The first goes to the burden,

24

Justice Kennedy, and I think you alluded to this in your

25

question.

The burden in a preliminary injunction
34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

context stays with the same party at the preliminary

2

injunction stage as at the merits stage.

3

in a preliminary injunction context the court is asking

4

has there been a substantial likelihood of success on

5

the merits, the same party has to make that showing as

6

has to make that showing at the merits stage.

7

And so, when

Here Texas would turn that upside down,

8

because at the merits stage, which is the preclearance

9

proceeding -JUSTICE KAGAN:

10
11

Well, would it be okay if we

just said, well, Texas has to make the showing?

12

MR. SRINIVASAN:

That would certainly be

13

better.

14

But that's not what Texas -- the approach that Texas

15

proposes today.

16

I think that would improve things quite a bit.

But it's different in two other respects

17

from a standard preliminary injunction context as well.

18

And one is what Justice Ginsburg alluded to, which is

19

here you don't have a situation in which the same court

20

that's going to forecast its ultimate adjudication of

21

the merits is also deciding what it's going to do at the

22

preliminary injunction stage.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, that's exactly

24

right, but you see it only on one side of the problem.

25

You say, well, you can't treat it as if it's been
35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

precleared --

2

MR. SRINIVASAN:

That's right.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

-- because that

4

would be prejudging what the court in D.C. is going to

5

do.

6

assuming that there are going to be these section 5

7

violations and drawing additional majority-minority

8

districts, which is just assuming on the other -- the

9

other way what the court here in D.C. is going to do.

But you have no trouble with them saying --

10

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well --

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I don't know how you

12

-- you lean one way and say, well, it's horrible, you

13

can't use it because it hasn't been precleared; but it's

14

all right in drawing the interim plan to treat it as

15

there -- as if preclearance has been denied.

16

MR. SRINIVASAN:

No, I don't -- I don't know

17

about that, because I think what a district court is

18

supposed to do when preclearance is pending is not

19

accept all the challenges.

20

to apply traditional districting criteria to the

21

benchmark.

22

What it's supposed to do is

So, I guess -JUSTICE KAGAN:

So, do you contest the view

23

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, of course, Your

Honor, Texas is in a different position precisely

14

because it's a covered jurisdiction.

precedence in some respects, precisely because a

12

with drawing maps.

MR. GARZA:

Mr. Chief Judge, and may it

please the Court:
There seems to be general consensus on at

23

least three points that we've talked about today.

24

First, that the un-precleared plan cannot take effect.

25

The second, that the district court is foreclosed from

that your friend suggests.

I think we're dealing with a

matter of semantics, Your Honor, because the question

13

is, did the court give the -- the State's plan

deference?

determination either way, and it didn't, because in

those districts, it didn't adopt the plans that were put

forward by the plaintiffs or the challengers in

starting point.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But could it -- could it

2

look at the district and say, well, it respects county

3

lines; it follows a river; it's got urban and rural.

4

Could it look at it for that reason?

MR. GARZA:

What it --

7

legislative judgment as making a sound judgment that the

8

river runs through here, and the county line is there

and so forth?

11

That's -- that's what seems to me the

difficulty with saying, oh, you can't look at the plan.
MR. GARZA:

I think the problem with that,

12

Your Honor, is that then it would be assuming that the

13

State is correct, that it doesn't violate section 5.

14

That is -- that is an inquiry that's reserved to the

15

district court in the District of Columbia.

16

And that's right,

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Aren't you

inquiry that belongs to the district court in D.C.
MR. GARZA:

No, because what the court did

is it didn't accept as a remedy what the plaintiffs

25

proposed there.

It reverted to State policy, which is
47
Alderson Reporting Company

2

back to State policy, and it looked at the benchmark

3

plan, and it started with the benchmark plan.

4

5

districts, and there is no comparable district in the

benchmark, it looked to the legislatively enacted plan

7

to determine where it would place those districts.

The benchmark plan is gone.

to.

manner in which it did review the plans.

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

And the way you sort of walk

Well, let's say -- let's say

5

a legislature says we have a new policy, and that is

6

that once we've satisfied our constitutional obligations

7

and our obligations under the Voting Rights Act, the

8

only thing we're going to do is try to draw the

9

districts that are the most compact possible,

11

compactness over everything else.
They draw up a plan that embodies that

12

policy, and it's challenged under section 5.

13

the district court just say, well, that's -- the State's

14

policy is compactness over everything else, but we don't

15

agree with that, because we have other neutral

16

principles that advance the interest of the collective

12

It said that district 33 was drawn as a minority

13

coalition opportunity district.

14

that it is appropriate or even permissible to draw a

15

district where you're putting in together two

16

minorities, two different minority groups.

17

to me that that raises all sorts of different concerns.

18

They don't say a minority

It's one thing under the Voting Rights Act

discriminated against in its ability to elect

say that two different minority groups are put together

I think -- I think that the

statement that the court made is a correct statement.

this one as a minority coalition opportunity district.

MR. GARZA:

Of course, it can be read

I

22

differently than Your Honor's interpretation of this,

the court saw maintaining voting precincts as important.

One is because that is what it's been directed by this

14

The second reason is that this court didn't

and proposals from the parties.

17

It was very cautious, and it was very open.

that Judge Smith in Texas used, in a manner of speaking,

the preliminary injunction standard that's being

that the plan was an extreme gerrymander, ruled that

3

reasonable approach than the one offered by the State,

is, that in the State's argument, you really turn

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

21

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

22

MR. CLEMENT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

23

Just a few points in rebuttal.

As one of

24

Justice Alito's questions highlighted, one of the things

25

that makes remedying a one person, one vote problem
64
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

particularly unique is there's literally an infinite

2

number of ways to solve the problem.

3

reason, this Court has always looked wherever it could

4

to legislative guidance, so much so that in White v.

5

Weiser, this Court looked for legislative guidance to a

6

plan that had been declared unconstitutional for failing

7

to accommodate one person, one vote problems, but yet

8

this Court still said that the district court erred in

9

not taking that into account to the extent that it

10
11

And for that

could.
As to the hard choice, if it comes to that,

12

of using either the legislative plan that reflects the

13

legislative will or the judicial plan that even the

14

United States concedes is flawed, I think this Court has

15

faced even more difficult choices in the past:

16

v. Weiser and in Whitcomb.

17

this Court chose between an adjudicatedly

18

unconstitutional State plan and a judicial remedy that

19

it determined was flawed.

20

the election to take place under the flawed

21

constitutionally adjudicated imperfect plan.

22

Bullock

And in both of those cases,

And in both cases, it ordered

Compared to that, simply saying that an

23

election should go forward under a plan that hasn't been

24

precleared is a far less serious step.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why -- why shouldn't it be

inverted the way your friend suggests?

10

saying that that's -- that's better than the -- than the

11

worst alternative I face, which is to say it's better

12

than the district court's opinion.

13

But here's why it shouldn't:

That actually

14

further intrudes on the D.C. court because the question

15

that the remedial court should not be asking is, geez,

17

the D.C. court is going to preclear?

18

that question at all.

19

are before it.

20

there an equal protection violation?

21

those and I use the State's plan, does that create a

22

section 5 violation?

23

It shouldn't ask

It should ask the questions that

Is there a section 2 violation?

Is

If there aren't

That's different from the preclearance

question.

And on that section 5 question, the burden is

25

not logically on the State.

And that's the same section

66
Alderson Reporting Company

1

5 question that the court considered on its own motion,

2

because it understands that even when it takes a plan,

3

it has to be consistent with section 5 principles.

Now, Justice Kennedy, you've asked the

5

question, what if we take section 5 out of this, what
