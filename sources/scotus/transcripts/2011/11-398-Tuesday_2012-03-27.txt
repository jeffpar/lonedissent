GENERAL VERRILLI:

They can address it

directly, Justice Scalia, and they are addressing it

14

directly through this -- through this Act by regulating

15

the means by which health care -- by which health care

16

is purchased.

17

That is the way this Act works.

Under the Commerce Clause, what Congress has

18

done is to enact reforms of the insurance market,

19

directed at the individual insurance market, that

20

preclude -- that preclude discrimination based on

21

pre-existing conditions, that require guaranteed issue

on here, Justice Kennedy, and we're not seeking to

to regulation.

That's not our

position at all, Justice Scalia.

market -- the health care market is characterized by the

16

fact that aside from the few groups that Congress chose

17

to exempt from the minimum coverage requirement -- those

18

who for religious reasons don't participate, those who

19

are incarcerated, Indian tribes -- virtually everybody

20

else is either in that market or will be in that market,

21

and a distinguishing feature of that is that they

cannot -- people cannot generally control when they

GENERAL VERRILLI:

I think the fundamental

difference, Mr. Chief Justice, is that that's not an

going to shift the cost to somebody else.

3

Isn't that a very artificial way of talking

4

about what somebody is doing?

5

GENERAL VERRILLI:

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

No --

And if that's true, why

7

isn't it equally artificial to say that somebody who is

8

doing absolutely nothing about health care is financing

9

health care services?

10

GENERAL VERRILLI:

It's -- I think it's

11

completely different.

12

burial example is not -- the difference is here you are

13

regulating the method by which you are paying for

14

something else -- health care -- and the insurance

GENERAL VERRILLI:

That's a difference, and

15

it's a significant difference, that this -- in this

16

situation, one of the economic effects Congress is

17

addressing is that the -- there -- the many billions of

18

dollars of uncompensated costs are transferred directly

19

to other market participants.

20

to other market participants because health care

21

providers charge higher rates in order to cover the cost

22

of uncompensated care, and insurance companies reflect

23

those higher rates in higher premiums, which Congress

24

found translates to a thousand dollars per family in

25

additional health insurance costs.

It's transferred directly

JUSTICE ALITO:

But isn't that really a

2

small part of what the mandate is doing?

3

correct me if these figures are wrong, but it appears to

4

me that the CBO has estimated that the average premium

5

for a single insurance policy in the non-group market

6

will be roughly $5,800 in -- in 2016.

7

You can

Respondents -- the economists who have

8

supported the Respondents estimate that a young, healthy

9

individual targeted by the mandate on average consumes

10

about $854 in health services each year.

11

mandate is forcing these people to provide a huge

12

subsidy to the insurance companies for other purposes

13

that the Act wishes to serve, but isn't -- if those

14

figures are right, isn't it the case that what this

15

mandate is really doing is not requiring the people who

16

are subject to it to pay for the services that they are

17

going to consume?

18

services that will be received by somebody else.

So, the

GENERAL VERRILLI:

(A) it is how insurance

Alderson Reporting Company

works, but (b) the problem that they -- that they're

2

identifying is not that problem.

3

and community-rating reforms do not have the effect of

4

forcing insurance companies to take on lots of

5

additional people who they then can't afford to cover

6

because they're -- they tend to be the sick, and that

7

is -- in fact, the exact opposite is what happens here.

The guaranteed-issue

8

The -- when you enact guaranteed-issue and

9

community-rating reforms, and you do so in the absence

10

of a minimum coverage provision, it's not that insurance

11

companies take on more and more people and then need a

12

subsidy to cover it; it's that fewer and fewer people

13

end up with insurance because the rates are not

14

regulated.

1

I understand that we must presume laws are

2

constitutional, but, even so, when you are changing the

3

relation of the individual to the government in this,

4

what we can stipulate is, I think, a unique way, do you

5

not have a heavy burden of justification to show

6

authorization under the Constitution?

7

GENERAL VERRILLI:

So, two things about

8

that, Justice Kennedy.

First, we think this is

9

regulation of people's participation in the health care

10

market, and all it -- all this minimum coverage

11

provision does is say that, instead of requiring

12

insurance at the point of sale, that Congress has the

13

authority under the commerce power and the necessary and

14

proper power to ensure that people have insurance in

15

advance of the point of sale because of the unique

16

nature of this market, because this is a market in

17

which -- in which you -- although most of the population

18

is in the market most of the time -- 83 percent visit a

19

physician every year; 96 percent over a 5-year period --

20

so, virtually everybody in society is in this market.

21

And you've got to pay for the health care

22

you get, the predominant way in which it's -- in which

23

it's paid for is insurance, and -- and the Respondents

24

agree that Congress could require that you have

25

insurance in order to get health care or forbid health

care from being provided --

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why do you -- why do you

3

define the market that broadly?

4

well be that everybody needs health care sooner or

5

later, but not everybody needs a heart transplant.

6

everybody needs a liver transplant.

7

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Health care.

It may

Not

Why -- I mean --

That's correct, Justice

8

Scalia, but you never know whether you're going to be

9

that person.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Could you define the

11

market -- everybody has to buy food sooner or later.

12

So, you define the market as food; therefore,

13

everybody's in the market; therefore, you can make

14

people buy broccoli.

15

GENERAL VERRILLI:

No, that is quite

16

different.

17

while it shares that trait that everybody's in it, it is

18

not a market in which your participation is often

19

unpredictable and often involuntary.

20

in which you often don't know before you go in what you

21

need, and it is not a market in which, if you go in

22

and -- and seek to obtain a product or service, you will

23

get it even if you can't pay for it.

24
25

It is quite different.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The food market,

It is not a market

It doesn't have --

Well, is that a principled

basis for distinguishing this from other situations?

mean, you know, you could also say, well, the person

subject to this has blue eyes.

3

distinguish it from other situations.

4

GENERAL VERRILLI:

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That would indeed

It is a -Is it a principled basis?

6

I mean, it's -- it's a basis that explains why the

7

government is doing this, but is it -- is it a basis

8

which shows that this is not going beyond what -- what

9

the system of enumerated powers allows the government to

10

do.

11

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Yes, for two reasons.

12

First, this -- the test, as this Court has articulated

13

it, is:

14

substantial effect on interstate commerce?

Is Congress regulating economic activity with a

15

The way in which this statute satisfies the

16

test is on the basis of the factors that I have

17

identified.

18

It -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Verrilli, I thought

19

that your main point is that, unlike food or any other

20

market, when you made the choice not to buy insurance,

21

even though you have every intent in the world to

22

self-insure, to save for it, when disaster strikes, you

23

may not have the money.

24

is -- we were told -- there was one brief that Maryland

25

hospital care bills 7 percent more because of these

And the tangible result of it

14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

uncompensated costs, that families pay a thousand

2

dollars more than they would if there were no

3

uncompensated costs.

4

I thought what was unique about this is it's

5

not my choice whether I want to buy a product to keep me

6

healthy, but the cost that I am foisting on other people

7

if I don't buy the product sooner rather than later.

8
9
10
11
12

GENERAL VERRILLI:

That is -- and that is

definitely a difference that distinguished this market
and justifies this as a regulation -JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

So, if that is

your difference --

13

GENERAL VERRILLI:

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- of common activity.
If that is your difference,

15

I'm somewhat uncertain about your answers to -- for

16

example, Justice Kennedy asked, can you, under the

17

Commerce Clause, Congress, create commerce where

18

previously none existed?

19

GENERAL VERRILLI:

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well -Yes, I thought the answer

21

to that was, since McCulloch v.

Maryland, when the

22

Court said Congress could create the Bank of the United

23

States which did not previously exist, which job was to

24

create commerce that did not previously exist, since

25

that time the answer has been "yes."
15
Alderson Reporting Company

I would have

Official

1

thought that your answer to, can the government, in

2

fact, require you to buy cell phones or buy burials,

3

that if we propose comparable situations, if we have,

4

for example, a uniform United States system of paying

5

for every burial such as Medicare Burial, Medicaid

6

Burial, CHIP Burial, ERISA Burial, and emergency burial

7

beside the side of the road, and Congress wanted to

8

rationalize that system, wouldn't the answer be, yes, of

9

course, they could?

10

GENERAL VERRILLI:

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

So -And the same with the

12

computers or the same with the -- the cell phones, if

13

you're driving by the side of the highway and there is a

14

Federal emergency service.

15

buy certain mufflers for your car that don't hurt the

16

environment, you could -- I mean, you see, doesn't it

17

depend on the situation?

18
19

GENERAL VERRILLI:

question -- fine.
16
Alderson Reporting Company

So, then the

Official

1

GENERAL VERRILLI:

-- and I would defend

2

them on a rationale like that, but I do think that we

3

are advancing a narrower rationale.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, then the question

5

is whether or not there are any limits on the Commerce

6

Clause.

7

Commerce Clause?

8

Can you identify for us some limits on the

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Yes.

The -- the

9

rationale purely under the Commerce Clause that we're

10

advocating here would not justify forced purchases of

11

commodities for the purpose of stimulating demand.

12

We -- the -- it would not justify purchases of insurance

13

for the purposes -- in situations in which insurance

14

doesn't serve as the method of payment for a service --

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

16

GENERAL VERRILLI:

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But why not?

If --

-- Congress can regulate.
If Congress says that

18

interstate commerce is affected, isn't, according to

19

your view, that the end of the analysis?

20

GENERAL VERRILLI:

No.

The -- we think that

21

in a -- when -- the difference between those situations

22

and this situation is that in those situations, Your

23

Honor, Congress would be moving to create commerce.

24

Here Congress is regulating existing commerce, economic

25

activity that is already going on, people's
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

participation in the health care market, and is

2

regulating to deal with existing effects of existing

3

commerce.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That, it seems to

5

me, is -- and it's a passage in your reply brief that I

6

didn't quite grasp.

7

"Health insurance is not purchased for its own sake like

8

a car or broccoli; it is a means of financing

9

health-care consumption and covering universal risks."

10

It's the same point.

You say,

Well, a car or broccoli aren't purchased for

11

their own sake, either.

They're purchased for the sake

12

of transportation or, in broccoli, covering the need for

13

food.

14

GENERAL VERRILLI:

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

16

No -I don't understand

that distinction.
GENERAL VERRILLI:

17

The difference, Mr. Chief

18

Justice, is that health insurance is the means of

19

payment for health care, and broccoli is -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

20
21

significant -- I'm sorry.
GENERAL VERRILLI:

22

And broccoli is not the

23

means of payment for anything else.

24

is not --

25

Well, now that's a

It's the means of

satisfying a basic human need --

2

GENERAL VERRILLI:

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

4

But --- just as your

insurance is the means of satisfying --

5

GENERAL VERRILLI:

But I do think that's the

6

difference between existing commerce, activity in the

7

market already occurring -- the people in the health

8

care market purchasing, obtaining health care

9

services -- and the creation of commerce.

And the

10

principle that we're advocating here under the Commerce

11

Clause does not take the step of justifying the creation

12

of commerce.

of your argument was that the people who don't

participate in this market are making it much more

get -- a goodly number of them will get services that

embedded social norm.

GENERAL VERRILLI:

This is a -- this is a law that

regulates the method of paying for a service that the

16

class of people to whom it applies are either

17

consuming --

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

19

GENERAL VERRILLI:

20
21

General --- or inevitably will

consume.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

General, I see or have

22

seen three strands of arguments in your briefs, and one

23

of them is echoed today.

24

seen is that Congress can pass any necessary laws to

25

effect those powers within its rights, i.e., because it

The first strand that I've

21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

made a decision that to effect -- to effect mandatory

2

issuance of insurance, that it could also obligate the

3

mandatory purchase of it.
The second strand I see is self-insurance

4
5

affects the market; and so, the government can regulate

6

those who self-insure.
And the third argument -- and I see all of

7
8

them as different -- is that what the government is

9

doing -- and I think it's the argument you're making

10

today -- that what the -- what the government is saying

11

is if you pay for health -- if you use health services,

12

you have to pay with insurance, because only insurance will

13

guarantee that whatever need for health care that you

14

have will be covered, because virtually no one, perhaps

15

with the exception of 1 percent of the population, can

16

afford the massive cost if the unexpected happens.
This third argument seems to be saying what

17
18

we're regulating is health care, and when you go for

19

health services, you have to pay for insurance, and

20

since insurance won't issue at the moment that you

21

consume the product, we can reasonably, necessarily tell

22

you to buy it ahead of time, because you can't buy it at

23

the moment that you need it.
Is that -- which of these three is your

24
25

argument?

Are all of them your argument?

GENERAL VERRILLI:

23

1

that's the first part of our argument.

2

The second part of our argument is that the

3

means here that Congress has chosen, the minimum

4

coverage provision, is a means that regulates the --

5

that regulates economic activity, namely your

6

transaction in the health care market, with substantial

7

effects on interstate commerce; and it is the

8

conjunction of those two that we think provides the

9

particularly secure foundation for this statute under

10

the commerce power.

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

General, you've talked on --

12

a couple of times about other alternatives that Congress

13

might have had, other alternatives that the Respondents

14

suggest to deal with this problem, in particular, the

15

alternative of mandating insurance at the point at which

16

somebody goes to a hospital or an emergency room and

17

asks for care.

18

Did Congress consider those alternatives?

19

Why did it reject them?

20

question of alternative ways of dealing with these

21

problems?

22

How should we think about the

GENERAL VERRILLI:

I do think, Justice

23

Kagan, that the point of difference between my friends

24

on the other side and the United States is about one of

25

timing.

They've agreed that Congress has Article I
24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

authority to impose an insurance requirement or other --

2

or other penalty at the point of sale, and they have

3

agreed that Congress has the authority to do that to

4

achieve the same objectives that the minimum coverage

5

provision in the Affordable Care Act is designed to

6

achieve.

7

This is a situation in which we are talking

8

about means.

Congress gets substantial deference in

9

the choice of means, and if one thinks about the

10

difference between the means they say Congress should

11

have chosen and the means Congress did choose, I think

12

you can see why it was eminently more sensible for

13

Congress to choose the means that it chose.

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I'm not sure which way it

15

cuts, if the Congress has alternate means.

Let's assume

16

that it could use the tax power to raise revenue and to

17

just have a national health service, single payer.

18

does that factor into our analysis?

19

can be argued if this is what the government is doing,

20

it ought to be honest about the power that it's using

21

and use the correct power.

How

In one sense, it

22

On the other hand, it means that since the

23

Court can do it any way -- Congress can do it any way,

24

Let me try to answer that

2

question, Justice Kennedy, and get back to the question

3

you asked me earlier.

4

striking feature of the argument here that this is a

5

novel exercise of power is that what Congress chose to

6

do was to rely on market mechanisms and efficiency and a

7

method that has more choice than would the traditional

8

Medicare or Medicaid type model.

9

little ironic to suggest that that counts against it.

But beyond that, in the sense that it's

novel, this provision is novel in the same way, or

unprecedented in the same way, that the Sherman Act was

14

2

that was reasonably adapted was not proper, because it

3

violated the sovereignty of the States, which was

4

implicit in the constitutional structure.

5

And we've held in two cases that something

The argument here is that this also is -- may be

necessary, but it's not proper, because it violates an

equally evident principle in the Constitution, which is

that the Federal Government is not supposed to be a

The key in Lochner

is that we were talking about regulation of the States,

right, and the States are not limited to enumerated

GENERAL VERRILLI:

I agree, except,

12

Mr. Chief Justice, that what the Court has said, as I

read the Court's cases, is that the way in which you

critical how you define the market.

and newborn care, pediatric services, and substance use

treatment.

substance use treatment or pediatric services; and yet,

It seems to me that you cannot say that

1

that is part of what you require them to purchase.

2

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Well, it's part of what

3

the statute requires the insurers to offer.

4

the reason is because it's trying to define minimum

5

essential coverage because the problem --

6

Yes, but your theory

7

is that there is a market in which everyone participates

the cost of an insurance policy to cover the services

Lochner if we were put in a position of saying, no,

care market.

it, and we're going to look at a particular serious

problem, which is how people pay for it.

they can decide everybody's in this market; we're going

we're going to regulate it.

That's the something else.

No.

First, with

5

respect to the comprehensive scheme.

6

regulating -- is enacting a comprehensive scheme that it

7

has the authority to enact, that the Necessary and

8

Proper Clause gives it the authority to include

9

regulation, including a regulation of this kind, if it

12

that would undercut the scheme.

much like Wickard in that respect.

in that respect.

15

It's like -- it's very
Very much like Raich

With respect to the -- with respect to

16

the -- considering the Commerce Clause alone and not

17

embedded in the comprehensive scheme, our position is

18

that Congress can regulate the method of payment by

19

imposing an insurance requirement in advance of the time

20

in which the -- the service is consumed when the class

21

to which that requirement applies either is, or virtually

22

most certain to be, in that market, when the timing of

23

one's entry into that market and what you will need when

24

you enter that market is uncertain, and when -- when you

25

will get the care in that market, whether you can afford
45

to pay for it or not and shift costs to other market

2

participants.

3

So, those -- those are our views as to --

4

those are the principles we're advocating for, and it's,

5

in fact, the conjunction of the two of them here that

6

makes this, we think, a strong case under the Commerce

7

Clause.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I have looked for a case

that involves the issue of whether something denominated

14

tax, except in those situations where the code itself or

15

the statute itself said treat the penalty as a tax.

16
17
18

Do you know of any case where we've done
that?
GENERAL VERRILLI:

Well, I think I would

19

point the Court to the license tax case, where it was --

20

was denominated a fee, a nontax, and the Court upheld it

21

as an exercise of the taxing power, in a situation in

22

which the structure of the law was very much like the

23

structure of this law, in that there was a separate

24

stand-alone provision that set the predicate and then a

25

separate provision imposing the fee.

whether that is an exercise of the tax power or not.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS FLORIDA, ET AL.

MR. CLEMENT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The mandate represents an unprecedented

7

effort by Congress to compel individuals to enter

8

commerce in order to better regulate commerce.

9

Commerce Clause gives Congress the power to regulate

The

10

existing commerce.

It does not give Congress the far

11

greater power to compel people to enter commerce, to

12

create commerce essentially in the first place.

13

Now, Congress when it passed the statute did

14

make findings about why it thought it could regulate the

15

commerce here, and it justified the mandate as a

16

That is a theory without

Do you accept here the

General's position that you have conceded that Congress

21

could say, if you're going to consume health services,

22

you have to pay by way of insurance?

23

MR. CLEMENT:

That's right,

24

Justice Sotomayor.

We say, consistent with 220 years of

25

this Court's jurisprudence, that if you regulate the
55

1

point of sale, you regulate commerce, that's within

2

Congress's commerce power.

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

So, what do

4

you do with the impossibility of buying insurance at the

5

point of consumption?

6

companies to sell it to you?

7

Virtually, you force insurance

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, Justice, I think there's

8

two points to make on that.

One is a lot of the

9

discussion this morning so far has proceeded on the

10

assumption that the only thing that's at issue here is

11

emergency room visits, and the only thing that's being

12

imposed is catastrophic care coverage.

13

Chief Justice indicated earlier, a lot of the insurance

14

that's being covered is for ordinary preventive care,

15

ordinary office visits, and those are the kind of things

16

that one can predict.

17

But, as the

So, there's a big part of the market that's

18

regulated here that wouldn't pose the problem that

19

you're suggesting; but, even as to emergency room

20

visits, it certainly would be possible to regulate at

21

that point.

22

mandate on the insurance companies, you have to provide

23

people that come in -- this will be a high-risk pool,

24

and maybe you'll have to share it amongst yourself or

25

something, but people simply have to sign up at that

You could simply say, through some sort of

56
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

point, and that would be regulating at the point of

2

sale.

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, Mr. Clement, now it

4

seems as though you're just talking about a matter of

5

timing, that Congress can regulate the transaction.

6

the question is when does it make best sense to regulate

7

that transaction?

8
9

And Congress surely has it within its
authority to decide, rather than at the point of sale,

10

given an insurance-based mechanism, it makes sense to

11

regulate it earlier.

12

And

It's just a matter of timing.

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Kagan, we don't

13

think it's a matter of timing alone, and we think it has

14

very significant substantive effects, because if

15

Congress tried to regulate at the point of sale, the one

16

group that it wouldn't capture at all are the people who

17

don't want to purchase health insurance and also have no

18

plans of using health care services in the near term.

19

And Congress very much wanted to capture those people.

20

I mean, those people are essentially the golden geese

21

that pay for the entire lowering of the premium --

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is the government's

23

argument this -- and maybe I won't state it accurately.

24

It is true that the noninsured young adult is, in fact,

25

an actuarial reality insofar as our allocation of health

services, insofar as the way health insurance companies

2

figure risk.

3

or her living room doing nothing is an actuarial reality

4

that can and must be measured for health service

5

purposes; is that their argument?

6

That person who is sitting at home in his

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I don't know,

7

Justice Kennedy, but, if it is, I think there's at least

8

two problems with it.

9

One is, as Justice Alito's question

10

suggested earlier -- I mean, somebody who is not in the

11

insurance market is sort of irrelevant as an actuarial

12

risk.

13

insurance market, and what we'd find is that they're

14

relatively young, relatively healthy, and they would

15

have a certain pool of actuarial risks that would

16

actually lead to lower premiums.

17

I mean, we could look at the people not in the

The people that would be captured by

18

guaranteed rating and community issue -- guaranteed

19

issue and community rating would presumably have a

20

higher risk profile, and there would be higher premiums.

21

And one of the things, one of the things,

22

Congress sought to accomplish here was to force

23

individuals into the insurance market to subsidize those

24

that are already in it to lower the rates.

25

just not my speculation, that's Finding (I) at 43a of
58
Alderson Reporting Company

And that's

Official

1

the Government's brief that -- it has the statute.

2

that's one of the clear findings.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And

Mr. Clement, doesn't that

4

work -- that work the way Social Security does?

5

Let me put it this way:

Congress, in the

6

'30s, saw a real problem of people needing to have old

7

age and survivor's insurance.

8

through a tax, but they said everybody has got to be in

9

it because if we don't have the healthy in it, there's

And, yes, they did it

10

not going to be the money to pay for the ones who become

11

old or disabled or widowed.

12

to contribute.

13

So, they required everyone

There was a big fuss about that in the

14

beginning because a lot of people said -- maybe some

15

people still do today -- I could do much better if the

16

government left me alone.

17

market, I'd buy an annuity, I'd make a great investment,

18

and they're forcing me to pay for this Social

19

Security that I don't want.

20

I'd go into the private

But that's constitutional.

So, if Congress

21

could see this as a problem where we need to have a

22

group that will subsidize the ones who are going to get

23

the benefits, it seems to me you're saying the only way

24

that could be done is if the government does it itself;

25

it can't involve the private market, it can't involve

12

13

generally through everybody to raise the revenue to pay

14

for that subsidy.

15

16

And once we calculate the amount of

That's the way we pay for most

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

exemption?

19

the government; but anybody who has an insurance policy

is exempt from that tax?

22

MR. CLEMENT:

Could the government do that?
The government might be able

23

to do that.

I think it might raise some issues about

taxing power.

MR. CLEMENT:

Why couldn't we get a tax

Well, I think it would depend

10

a little bit on how it was formulated, but my concern

11

would be -- the constitutional concern would be that it

12

would just be a disguised impermissible direct tax.

13

I do think -- you know, I mean, I don't want to suggest

14

we get to the taxing power too soon, but I do think it's

15

worth realizing that the taxing power is limited in the

16

ability to impose direct taxes.

And

17

And the one thing I think the Framers would

18

have clearly identified as a direct tax is a tax on not

19

having something.

20

divided over whether a tax on carriages was a direct tax

21

or not.

22

Madison thought it was a direct tax.

23

doubt that both of them would have agreed that a tax on

24

not having a carriage would have clearly been a direct

25

tax.

I mean, the framing generation was

of all those things is different, and that is you're

faster than 45 -- 40 miles an hour on a road?

Didn't

8

they make that man growing his own wheat go out into the

market and buy other wheat for his -- for his cows?

10

Didn't they make Mrs. -- if she married somebody who had

11

McCulloch was not a commerce power case.

It was not -- no, the bank was not

18

justified and the corporation was not justified as an

19

exercise of commerce power.

20

says that it's okay to conjure up the bank as an

21

exercise of the commerce power.

22

So that is not a case that

And what, of course, the Court didn't say,

23

and I think the Court would have had a very different

24

reaction to, is, you know, we're not just going to have

25

the bank, because that would be necessary and proper;

64
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

we're going to force the citizenry to put all of their

2

money in the bank, because, if we do that, then we know

3

the Bank of the United States will be secure.

4

I think the Framers would have identified

the difference between those two scenarios, and I don't

think that the great Chief Justice would have said that

7

forcing people to put their deposits in the Bank of the

that's a particular market in which the farmer had been

it very different than the market for cars or the other

problems with this because, I mean, we take as a

given is that virtually everyone, absent some

intervention from above, meaning that someone's life

will not use, say, emergency care?

Of course not, Justice Breyer,

sorts of latitude to make the right judgments about

actuarial predictions, which actuarial to rely on, which

2

5

time ever in our history, Congress also has the power to

compel people into commerce, because, it turns out, that

would be a very efficient thing for purposes of

8

Congress's optimal regulation of that market.

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And I --

But, Mr. Clement, this goes

10

back to the Chief Justice's question.

11

the theory behind, not just the Government's case, but

12

the theory behind this law is that people are in this

13

market right now, and they're in this market because

14

people do get sick, and because when people get sick, we

15

provide them with care without making them pay.

16

But, of course,

And it would be different, you know, if you

17

were up here saying, I represent a class of Christian

18

Scientists, then you might be able to say, look, you

19

know, why are they bothering me?

20

you're in this market.

21

But absent that,

You're an economic actor.

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Kagan, once

22

again, it depends on which market we're talking about.

23

If we're talking about the health care insurance

24

market --

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, we're talking about

70
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the health insurance market, which is designed to access

2

the health care market.

3

MR. CLEMENT:

And with respect to the health

4

insurance market that's designed to have payment in the

5

health care market, everybody's not in the market.

6

that's the premise of the statute, and that's the

7

problem Congress is trying to solve.

8
9

And

And if it tried to solve it through
incentives, we wouldn't be here; but it's trying to

10

solve it in a way that nobody has ever tried to solve an

11

economic problem before, which is saying, you know, it

12

would be so much more efficient if you were just in this

13

-- the market.

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But they're in the market

15

in the sense that they're creating a risk that the

market must account for.

19

distinguishes this from any other context.

10

know here, and we don't like to admit it, that because

to leave here with the impression that anything turns on

that.

they've come up with a great -- somebody -- some private

Justice Kagan, again, with all

My unwillingness to buy an electric car is forcing up

the price of an electric car.

If only more people

JUSTICE KAGAN:

No, this is very different,

And that gets at the idea that there's two

other policy areas -- holders.

13

bigger cost shifting going on here, and that's the cost

shifting that goes on when you force healthy people into

an insurance market precisely because they're healthy,

precisely because they're not likely to go to the

I would like hear you

address Justice Breyer's other two principles.

6

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, the other two principles

7

are Lopez -- and this case really is not -- I mean, you

8

know, Lopez is a limit on the affirmative exercise of

9

people who are already in commerce.

The question is, is

10

there any other limit to people who aren't in commerce?

11

And so, I think this is the case that really asks that

12

question.

13

And then the first point, which was -- I

14

take it to be the Solicitor General's point, is, with

15

all due respect, simply a description of the insurance

16

market.

17

justification for why this is a valid regulation of

18

commerce is in no way limited to this market.

19

says these are economic decisions; they have effect on

20

other people; my failure to purchase in this market has

21

a direct effect on others who are already in the market.

22

That's true of virtually every other market under the

23

sun.

It's not a limiting principle, because the

1

MR. CLEMENT:

I'd be delighted to, which is

2

-- I mean, I -- you're absolutely right.

Once you're in

3

the commerce power, there -- this Court is not going to

4

police that subject maybe to the Lopez limit.

5

that's exactly why I think it's very important for this

6

Court to think seriously about taking an unprecedented

7

step of saying that the commerce power not only includes

8

the power to regulate, prescribe the rule by which

9

commerce is governed, the rule of Gibbons v. Ogden; but

And

10

to go further and say it's not just prescribing the rule

11

for commerce that exists, but it is the power to compel

12

people to enter into commerce in the first place.

13

I'd like to say two very brief things about

14

the taxing power, if I could.

15

why this isn't a tax.

16

It's not structured as a tax.

17

though, it is a direct tax.

18

clause 4 -- the Framers would have had no doubt that a

19

tax on not having something is not an excise tax but a

20

forbidden direct tax.

21

is not proper legislation, because it -- it violates

22

that.

23

There are lots of reasons

It wasn't denominated a tax.
If it's any tax at all,
Article I, section 9,

That's one more reason why this

The second thing is I would urge you to read

24

the license tax case, which the Solicitor General says

25

is his best case for why you ignore the fact that a tax

2

case where the argument was that because the Federal

3

Government had passed a license, not a tax, that somehow

4

that allowed people to take actions that would have been

5

unlawful under State law, that this was some special

Federal license to do something that was forbidden by

State law.

to preserve federalism there.

have to resist your premise, because I didn't answer,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL A. CARVIN
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS NFIB, ET AL.
MR. CARVIN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

May it please the Court:
I'd like to begin with the Solicitor

12

General's main premise, which is that they can compel

13

the purchase of health insurance in order to promote

14

commerce in the health market because it will reduce

15

uncompensated care.

16

have to fundamentally alter the text of the Constitution

17

and give Congress plenary power.

If you accept that argument, you

It simply doesn't matter whether or not this

19

regulation will promote health care commerce by reducing

20

uncompensated care.

21

activity actually being regulated by the Act negatively

affects commerce or negatively affects commerce

commerce, then they have the power to regulate

And if they have the power to promote

83
Alderson Reporting Company

1

everything, right?

2

Because --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I don't -- I don't

3

think you're addressing their main point, which is that

4

they're not creating commerce in -- in health care.

5

It's already there, and we're all going to need some

6

kind of health care; most of us will at some point.

7

MR. CARVIN:

I'd -- I'd like to address that

8

in two ways, if I could, Mr. Chief Justice.

In the

9

first place, they keep playing mix and match with the

10

statistics.

11

care market, okay?

12

statistic, even as the Government frames the issue.

13

one in Congress or the Solicitor General is arguing that

14

going to the doctor and fully paying him creates a

15

problem.

16

say the uncompensated care arises if you have some kind

17

of catastrophe -- hit by a bus, have some prolonged

18

illness.

19

that have those sorts of catastrophes?

We know it has

20

got to be a relatively small fraction.

So, in other

21

words, the relevant --

22
23
24
25

They say 95 percent of us are in the health
But that's not the relevant
No

The problem is uncompensated care, and they

Well, what is the percentage of the uninsured

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yet, we don't know

who they are.
MR. CARVIN:

We don't, no, and we don't know

in advance, and -- but that doesn't change the basic
84
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

principle, that you are nonetheless forcing people for

2

paternalistic reasons to go into the insurance market to

3

insure against risks that they have made the voluntary

4

decision that they are not -- have decided not to.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

6

MR. CARVIN:

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But the problem is --

But even if -The problem is that they

8

are making the rest of us pay for it, because as much as

9

they say, well, we're not in the market, we don't know

10

when they -- the timing when they will be.

11

MR. CARVIN:

With --

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And the -- the figures of

13

how much more families are paying for insurance because

14

people get sick, they may have intended to self-insure,

15

they haven't been able to meet the bills for -- for

16

cancer, and the rest of us end up paying because the --

17

people are getting cost-free health care.

18

way to prevent that is to have them pay sooner rather

19

than later, pay up front.

20

MR. CARVIN:

And the only

Yes, but my point is this:

21

That, with respect, Justice Ginsburg, conflates the

22

people who do result in uncompensated care, the free

riders.

care payments.

people, an entirely different activity than being

2

So, the question is whether or not you can

3

regulate activity because it has a statistical

4

connection to an activity that harms commerce.

5

basic point to you is this:

6

Congress the power to regulate things that negatively

7

affect commerce or commerce regulation.

them the power to regulate things that are statistically

23

5

it can't do that.

MR. CARVIN:

There's something very odd

But if the

Well, I don't think the test of

7

a law's constitutionality is whether it more adheres to

8

the libertarian principles of the Cato Institute or the

9

statist principles of someone else.

I think the test of

10

the law is -- constitutionally is not those policy

11

questions; it's whether or not the law is regulating

12

things that negatively affect commerce or don't.

13

And since obviously the failure to purchase

14

an item doesn't create the kind of effects on supply and

15

demand that the market participants in Wickard and Raich

16

did and doesn't in any way interfere with regulation of

17

the insurance companies, I don't think it can pass the

basic --

of the consequences of regulating local market

4

participants is it'll affect the supply and the demand

5

for the product.

6

because those local market participants have the same

7

effect on the interstate market that a black market has

8

on a legal market.

9

And the -- yes, one

That's why you can regulate them,

But none of that is true -- in other words,

10

you can regulate local bootleggers, but that doesn't

11

suggest you can regulate teetotalers, people who stay

12

out of the liquor market, because they don't have any

13

negative effect on the existing market participants or

14

on regulation of those market participants.

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well that's why I suggested, Mr.

16

Carvin, that it might be different if you were raising

17

an as-applied challenge and presenting a class of people

18

whom you could say clearly would not be in the health

19

care market.

20

we can't really know which of the -- which of the many,

21

many people that this law addresses in fact will not

22

participate in the health care market and in fact will

23

not impose costs on all the rest of us.

But you're raising a facial challenge, and

24

So, the question is, can Congress respond to

25

those facts, that we have no crystal ball, that we can't

the rest of us and that's a problem that we can deal

5

with on a class-wide basis?

6

MR. CARVIN:

No again.

The people who

7

impose the costs on the rest of us are people who engage

8

in a different activity at a different time, which is

9

defaulting on their health care payments.

It's not the

10

uninsured.

to buy private mortgage insurance on everybody before

impose all sorts of restrictions on you, and they can

16

impose, for example, all kinds of restrictions on States

17

after they've enacted laws.

18

They can condition them.

They can wipe out the laws.

But what can't they do?

They can't compel

They can't compel States to carry

6

percent of the population to the unhealthy 5 percent.

reason they do that is because they need this massive

18

exactly the problem you would create if you bought the

19

government's bogus limiting principles.

20

draw distinctions between the insurance industry and the

21

car industry and all of that, returning to the Commerce

22

Clause jurisprudence that bedeviled the Court before the

23

1930s, where they were drawing all these kinds of

24

distinctions among industries; whereas our test is

25

really very simple.

You'd have to

Are you buying the product, or is

Congress compelling you to buy the product?

2

think of a brighter line.

3

I can't

And, again, if Congress has the power to

4

compel you to buy this product, then obviously they've

5

got the power to provide you -- to compel you to buy any

6

product, because any purchase is going to benefit

7

commerce.

8

Congress's policy judgments on how important it is, this

9

product versus that product.

10

And this Court is never going to second-guess

JUSTICE ALITO:

Do you think that drawing a

11

line between commerce and everything else that is not

12

commerce is drawing an artificial line, like drawing a

13

line between commerce and manufacturing?

14

MR. CARVIN:

The words "inactivity" and

15

"activity" are not in the Constitution.

16

"commerce" and "non-commerce" are.

17

distinction that comes, Justice Kagan, directly from the

18

text of the Constitution.

19

The words

And, again, it's a

The Framers consciously gave Congress the

20

ability to regulate commerce, because that's not a

21

particularly threatening activity that deprives you of

22

individual freedom.

23

If you were required -- if you were

24

authorized to require A to transfer property to B, you

25

have, as the early cases put it, a monster in
109
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

legislation which is against all reason and justice,

2

because everyone intuitively understands that regulating

3

people who voluntarily enter into contracts in setting

4

terms and conditions does not create the possibility of

5

Congress compelling wealth transfers among the

6

citizenry.

7

them the power to compel commerce and precisely why they

8

didn't give them plenary power.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
GENERAL VERRILLI:

Thank you,

Mr. Chief Justice.
Congress confronted a grave problem when it

18

enacted the Affordable Care Act:

19

Americans who can't get health insurance and suffered

20

often very terrible consequences.

21

think, everyone arguing this case agrees, that Congress

22

could remedy that problem by imposing an insurance

23

requirement at the point of sale.

24
25

That won't work.

the 40 million

Now, we agree, I

The reason it won't work

is because people will still show up at the hospital or
110
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

at their physician's office seeking care without

2

insurance, causing the cost-shifting problem.

3

Mr. Clement's suggestion that they can be signed up for

4

a high risk pool at that point is utterly unrealistic.

5

And

Think about how much it would cost to get

6

the insurance when you are at the hospital or at the

7

doctor.

8

That will never work.

9

chose the means that will work, the means that it saw

It would be -- it would be unfathomably high.
Congress understood that.

It

10

worked in the States and -- in the State of

11

Massachusetts, and that -- and that it had every reason

12

to think would work on a national basis.

13

That is the kind of choice of means that

14

McCulloch says that the Constitution leaves to the

15

democratically accountable branches of government.

16

There is no temporal limitation in the

17

Commerce Clause.

Everyone subject to this regulation is

18

in or will be in the health care market.

19

being regulated in advance.

20

thing that ought to be left to the judgment of Congress

21

and the democratically accountable branches of

22

government.

They are just

That's exactly the kind of

23

And I think this is actually a paradigm

24

example of the kind of situation that Chief Justice

25

Marshall envisioned in McCulloch itself, that the
111
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

provisions of the Constitution needed to be interpreted

2

in a manner that would allow them to be effective in

3

addressing the great crises of human affairs that the

4

Framers could not even envision.

5

But if there's any doubt about that under

6

the Commerce Clause, then I urge this Court to uphold

7

the -- the minimum coverage provision as an exercise of

8

the taxing power.

9

Under New York v. United States, this is

10

precisely a parallel situation.

If the Court thinks

11

there's any doubt about the ability of Congress to

12

impose the requirement in 5000A(a), it can be treated as

13

simply the predicate to which the tax incentive of

14

5000A(b) seeks accomplishment.
And the Court, as the Court said in New

15
16

York, has a solemn obligation to respect the judgments

17

of the democratically accountable branches of

18

government, and because this statute can be construed in

19

a manner that allows it to be upheld in that way, I

20

respectfully submit that it is this Court's duty to do

21

so.

22

Thank you.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

24

Counsel, we'll see you tomorrow.
