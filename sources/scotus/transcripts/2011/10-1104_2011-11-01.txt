Mr. Franklin.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN S. FRANKLIN

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8
9

MR. FRANKLIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Over the last three decades, the Court has

10
11

made clear that Bivens remedies are disfavored and will

12

only be authorized in narrow situations where there are

13

no adequate alternative means for redressing a

14

plaintiff's injuries and no other factor counsels

15

hesitation.

16

He has not shown that he lacked a traditional tort

17

remedy for the injuries of which he complains, and

18

Petitioners' status as employees of a private

19

contractor, rather than the government, at a minimum

20

gives rise to factors counseling hesitation.

21

Respondent has satisfied neither criterion.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

We go back to what you

22

said initially; that is, if there's no alternative

23

remedy, Bivens fills the gap.

24
25

Suppose we had a case just like Carlson,
only the State law allows survivor actions.
3
Alderson Reporting Company

In Carlson,

Official

1

I thought the rule emerging from Carlson is that prison

2

personnel in Federal prisons are subject to Bivens

3

liability, and we don't look in each case to see whether

4

there could have been a State tort.

5

MR. FRANKLIN:

Well, the rule --

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

7

MR. FRANKLIN:

Is that so?

In -- the rule -- the Carlson

8

rule still applies, Your Honor, because that involved

9

actual Federal Government employees.

And since Carlson,

10

Congress has pre-empted all tort claims against them.

11

So, whether Indiana law now -- which has been amended,

12

but whether Indiana law provides a remedy or doesn't is

13

immaterial, because Congress has pre-empted all tort

14

claims against actual employees of the government.

15

But these -- this case involves -- the

16

Petitioners are not employees of the government.

17

are employees of a private contractor.

18

Westfall Act, what Congress did was pre-empt all claims

19

against actual government officials while preserving

20

Bivens remedies.

21

They

And under the

But it did the opposite for employees of

22

private contractors.

For them, there are adequate

23

alternative tort remedies.

24

undisputed in this case that there was such a remedy

25

here.

And it's virtually

And they are deliberately -- Congress expressly
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

excluded them from the category of employees against

2

whom it preserved Bivens remedies.

3

So, yes, in the Carlson situation, there is

4

still a Bivens claim because Congress has expressly

5

preserved that.

6

congressional policy that we are, in effect, asking the

7

Court to embrace here.

8
9

But here we have a different

What Congress did in the Westfall Act is it
said what in effect we are asking this Court to

10

recognize and what we believe the Court has recognized

11

in cases like Malesko, and that is, where there are

12

adequate alternative tort -- excuse me -- where there

13

are no adequate --

17

a State where the law was very different from what

18

California's law appears to be, where there was no

19

special duty recognized for jailors and, indeed, where

20

the basic negligence tort was unavailable to inmates

21

because there was a finding of -- a holding of the State

22

supreme court that there was no duty on the part of

23

jailors to inmates.

24
25

I mean, I think you have a good
But suppose we were in

What would happen then?

MR. FRANKLIN:

In that hypothetical instance

-- and we do think it's hypothetical -- we think that
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

would be a different case, and the Court could in that

2

circumstance say there are no adequate alternative

3

remedies.

4

hypothetical is there has nothing been shown in the

5

briefing of this Court, and as the Ninth Circuit

6

dissenters made clear, that any State doesn't afford the

7

bedrock cause of negligence.

8

Court held in Malesko quite expressly, is not only

9

adequate to redress any actions that would violate the

And that cause, as the

Eighth Amendment, but it's actually superior.

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But is your answer --

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Franklin, there were

13

some references to Mississippi law that seem to be

14

inconsistent with the notion that all States would

15

provide an adequate remedy.

16

MR. FRANKLIN:

I believe that reference, if

17

I'm correct, comes from an amicus brief, and that law

18

does not -- would not on its face prohibit an action

against a private managed prison holding Federal

It might hold -- some

private facilities will take State prisoners as well as

7

Federal prisoners.

MR. FRANKLIN:

There has been some

representation, that we don't disagree with, that there

10

might be some facilities that have State prisoners

11

and --

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And if they do have State

13

prisoners, the State prisoner would have recourse to,

14

not Bivens, but 1983.
MR. FRANKLIN:

15
16

Most likely, Your Honor, yes,

if it's under --

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So, you have two

18

prisoners, identical mistreatment, and one gets a

19

Federal remedy and the other doesn't.

20

MR. FRANKLIN:

The other actually gets what

21

the Court in Malesko described as a superior remedy.

22

The prisoner -- the Federal prisoner has, in that sense,

23

a remedy that's beyond the Eighth Amendment, that

24

goes --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MR. FRANKLIN:

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

3

It makes a --- (a) duplicative or (b)

arguably narrow, more narrow?

4

MR. FRANKLIN:

Well, two points.

I'd like

5

to first say that the Court in Malesko adopted the

6

principle that if there is an alternative remedy, that's

7

not a reason for piling on a Federal remedy; that's a

8

reason not to.

9

But in a practical sense --

make?

MR. FRANKLIN:

Let me give you --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MR. FRANKLIN: -- a practical difference that

Who cares?

16

does matter for individuals in my clients' situation.

17

If a State tort claim is brought, there is respondeat

18

superior liability under a State court claim.

19

many if not most cases, the plaintiff will choose,

20

voluntarily choose, to sue the corporation and leave the

21

individual out of the case.

22

And in

Now, the deterrent effect that Bivens is

23

concerned with still exists because the case can be

24

25

Bivens claim, that has to be brought against the

However, if there's a

2

superior.

3

practical matter you're going to see more and more

4

individuals being dragged through these cases without,

5

by the way, the recognized qualified immunity defense --

So, if there is a Bivens claim, as a

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

7

MR. FRANKLIN:

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

9

Mr. Franklin -Yes.
-- do you have a theory

about why these are brought as Bivens claims?

It seems

10

mysterious to me.

If you bring it as a negligence

11

claim, you get a lower standard of liability, negligence

12

versus deliberate indifference.

13

MR. FRANKLIN:

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Right.
You get vicarious liability.

15

So, I've been trying to puzzle out, why aren't these

16

brought as negligence claims rather than as Bivens

17

claims?

18

MR. FRANKLIN:

I can't answer that question.

19

What I can say -- well, I can try to answer it, but I

20

can say that if the Court rules as we ask it to in this

21

case, we think that there will not be Bivens claims,

22

that people will bring them under the tort law.

23

It could be that there are forms in some of

24

these prisons that are given out that have section 1983

25

written on them, that Bivens is there.
10
Alderson Reporting Company

It could be that

Official

1

prisoners are not quite aware that the Westfall Act

2

doesn't cover private contractors.

3

But we would think that if the Court rules

4

as we -- as we suggest it should, that there -- that the

5

prisoners who are relatively savvy, even on a pro se

6

basis, about their rights would then understand that

7

they have these rights and will exercise them and that

8

the Bivens remedy would not have to be employed

9

willy-nilly as it was in this case.

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But I --

To go back to what I asked

11

before when I hypothesized a State that didn't have

12

adequate remedies, and you said -- well, just to pin

13

down what you said, if there were no adequate remedies,

14

there would be a Bivens action available?

15

MR. FRANKLIN:

There might be, Your Honor.

16

There still is the factors counseling hesitation, which

17

is the second step of the Bivens analysis.

18

wouldn't want to give up that there might be factors in

19

those cases counseling hesitation.

20

position is not that in a circumstance, if that arose --

21

and, again, we think it's hypothetical because there's

22

no indication either that it has arisen or that it will

23

arise -- but if it were to, our position wouldn't rule

24

out the possibility of a Bivens claim in those

25

circumstances.
11
Alderson Reporting Company

And I

But certainly our

Official

1

JUSTICE ALITO:

To get back to the question

2

that Justice Ginsburg asked, is it -- is that consistent

3

with Carlson?

4

that there's a Bivens action because in this particular

5

State there isn't a viable State action, but it might be

6

different in another State where there is a viable State

7

claim.

It did it on basically a categorical ground.

8
9

Because the Court in Carlson didn't say

MR. FRANKLIN:

Well, it -- as the case came

to the Court in Carlson, it was undisputed that there

10

was no adequate State law remedy, the lower courts had

11

held.

12

Court then went ahead and decided the case on.

So, that was sort of the basic premise that the

13

Since Carlson, we've had cases, notably

14

Malesko, also Wilkie, which have made clear that the

15

adequacy of remedies, including State law remedies, is a

16

factor in the Bivens analysis and is in fact the

17

dispositive factor in Malesko, and as in this case as

18

well.

19

We don't think that there is really any

20

serious dispute in this case that there were adequate

21

alternative remedies.

22

indifference standard is much, much more hard -- much

23

harder to meet than a traditional negligence standard.

24

California law is, further, more protective of

25

prisoners.

Again, the deliberate

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

As we understand the Respondents' position,

2

the Court -- they would urge the Court, notwithstanding

3

the availability of alternative remedies in this case

4

and as far as we can tell in every foreseeable case, to

5

create what they refer to as a categorical cause of

6

action, one that would apply regardless of whether the

7

remedies are adequate or not.

8
9

And in our view, that would turn the Bivens
jurisprudence effectively on its head.

The Court has

10

said Bivens is a narrow -- I think Justice Ginsburg at

11

least paraphrased our argument as saying it's a

12

gap-filling mechanism, which is what our argument is,

13

that would apply only in those circumstances when it's

14

necessary.

15

deferred the matter to Congress.

16

think it ought to lie in this case.

17

Other than that, the Court has consistently

JUSTICE ALITO:

And that's where we

Does a prisoner in a State

18

that requires the filing of a certificate of merit in a

19

medical malpractice case have a -- have an

20

alternative -- a viable alternative State claim --

21

MR. FRANKLIN:

Yes, again, that's --

22

JUSTICE ALITO: -- for malpractice?

23

MR. FRANKLIN:

We say yes.

That issue is

24

not in this case.

The Eleventh Circuit in Alba

25

expressly addressed that issue under that State's law,
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

and said, yes, that is adequate.

It's simply a

2

procedural requirement that applies to all plaintiffs.

3

And I would add, by the way, that --

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, how is a prisoner

5

supposed to satisfy that requirement?

6

MR. FRANKLIN:

The same way any other

7

plaintiff is supposed to -- but what I was going to add

8

is that when you're alleging an Eighth Amendment

9

violation, you're talking about a claim that's by its

10

nature very severe.

11

indifference to serious medical needs that constitutes

12

the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain.

13

You're talking about deliberate

In those circumstances, we would suggest

14

that it might even be easier to procure that kind of a

15

declaration, but that issue was decided in Alba.

16

that -- that was decided.

17

case, it can be decided there.

18

would render the -- if it's -- if it's an adequate

19

remedy for everyone else in that State and most States

20

that have these things, then it's an adequate remedy for

21

Bivens.

22

So,

If it comes up in another

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

We don't think that that

Did any of those courts

23

address the problem of how the pro se prisoner is going

24

to get an affidavit?

25

MR. FRANKLIN:

Well, Alba -- the Alba court
14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

is the only court that I'm aware of on the circuit level

2

that considered it, and I believe they did address that

3

issue and simply said that it is -- puts them on an

4

equal footing with other plaintiffs and that that would

5

be an adequate remedy.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I don't -- I don't

7

understand your answer to Justice Kagan.

If I heard you

8

right, you were saying, well, they're going to be able

9

to get a certificate because it's an Eighth Amendment

10

violation, and everything is very severe.

11

is they're going to bring a negligence action, not an

12

Eighth Amendment action.

13

MR. FRANKLIN:

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

15

MR. FRANKLIN:

But the point

Right.
So --

I'm talking about if the

16

conduct -- we're comparing here between conduct that

17

would violate the Eighth Amendment and conduct that's

18

negligent.

19

level of an Eighth Amendment violation, which is what

20

we're talking about in terms of the adequacy, then it

21

would be easier, one would presume.

22
23

And I'm saying if the conduct rises to the

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But I think the question,

Mr. Franklin, is really just a practical one --

24

MR. FRANKLIN:

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Sure.
-- which is how a pro se
15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

person sitting in prison is supposed to have access to a

2

doctor who will provide this certificate.

3

maybe there would be means, but I guess I'm asking

4

whether there would be.

5

MR. FRANKLIN:

And, I mean,

I would think there would,

6

but I don't want to say -- I don't want to argue someone

7

else's case on that.

8

an issue that was resolved, at least in the Eleventh

9

Circuit in Alba.

I mean, I do think that that was

It's not an issue that applies in this

10

case because there's no such certificate here in

11

California.

12

I do think it would be adequate.

I mean,

13

Bush v. Lucas, which is a Federal remedies case, said

14

there were what they called "meaningful remedies."

15

long as there's a meaningful remedy, it's sufficient.

16

And if Congress wants to think that there's a problem,

17

for example, if Congress thinks there's a problem with

18

these certificates of merit in the case of privately run

19

facilities, then it certainly can establish a cause of

20

action as it did in section 1983.

21

As

But the Bivens doctrine is really a narrow,

22

as we say, gap-filling doctrine.

And the Court has

always used it very sparingly.

has done that is because there is no authority for it in

counterparts, are subject to well-established theories

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

immunity defense.

2

which I submit reflect the heartland of cases alleging

3

Eighth Amendment violations for deliberate indifference

4

to serious medical needs, recognition of the Bivens

5

remedy is neither necessary nor appropriate.

6

Under the circumstances present here,

8

qualified immunity.

But they do have -- courts have

practice, how different is that, whether they have

qualified immunity or whether they have a good faith

13

defense?

14
15

MR. SHAH:

So, in

A couple of responses, Your

Honor.

defense.

point is, is that these prisoners have alternative

7

The government employee is subject to the

fact that there has been no suggestion that any State

possibility that there may be a case which may or may

question is -- yes, when you talk about an overlap of

2

remedies, we have said that it doesn't need to be a

4

of meaningful overlap, don't you?

5

MR. SHAH:

Honor.

I would agree with that, Your

I think -- I think -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So, how -- define how

much or how do we describe the adequacy of that overlap?
MR. SHAH:

I think it would be difficult to

10

come up with a precise formulation.

11

formulation that we use in our brief is that as long as

12

it redressed the gravamen of the prisoner's injuries.

13

So, I think as long as it provides some meaningful

14

relief for the injuries and in turn that would provide

15

some deterrence to the individual employees' actions --

16

I think as long as those two elements are present, I

17

think we would think that there is an adequate

18

alternative remedy.

19

I think the

Or, alternatively, if you wanted to use the

20

words -- the word that this Court used in Bivens, you

21

could approach it from the flip side and say there would

22

not be an adequate alternative remedy where the State

23

law is either inconsistent with or hostile to the

24

corresponding constitutional interest.

25

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It is -- a Bivens

5

action is unusual in the first place, but it's also

6

unusual to say that you don't have a Federal cause of

7

action because of something a State gives you.

8
9

Do you have any other example of something
like that, where the availability of Federal relief

10

turns on the availability of alternative relief under

11

State law?

12

MR. SHAH:

Your Honor, it may not be an

13

exact analogue, but I think Federal due process cases

14

often will look at if someone's claims of deprivation of

15

property, an unlawful deprivation of property, in

16

violation of process -- the Federal court may often look

17

at what are the available State law procedures to

18

provide redress for that claim before it would impose or

19

find a violation of Federal due process.

20

So, I think there are analogues where

21

Federal courts do look at the availability of State law

22

remedies and look at their adequacy before determining

23

whether a Federal law remedy is necessary.

24

Court has done that.

25

think is the best example in the Bivens context of where

And this

that, hey, look, the availability of these other

remedies counsel against the imposition of a Bivens

remedy.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

What is the theory behind

6

that, Mr. Shah?

I mean it's an obvious theory when

7

Congress has provided an alternative remedial system,

8

which is a separation of powers theory.

9

theory about looking to State law for these kinds of

10

alternative remedies?

11

MR. SHAH:

But what's the

Two responses, Your Honor.

While

12

I agree the separation of powers problem is much more

13

heightened when Congress acts, I think there is still a

14

separation of powers issue even when Congress has not

15

acted.

16

before implying a judicial -- a cause of action for

17

damages under the Constitution, given that it's

18

typically been Congress's province to do so.

That is, the Court should be hesitant before --

19

But, beyond that, the rationales -- there

20

have been two rationales that have been given by this

21

Court in its -- in its Bivens jurisprudence for implying

22

such a remedy.

23

meaningful relief.

24

alternative State remedy, that rationale has been

25

satisfied.

One is the need to provide some

The other rationale this Court has offered

2

is provide some deterrence to the actions of an

3

individual employee or officer.

4

when there is a State tort damages remedy available,

5

that rationale too will be accomplished.

6

We also submit that

The three cases in which this Court has

7

recognized a Bivens remedy, Bivens itself, Davis, and

8

Carlson, those two factors were not present.

9

10

Carlson, no alternative remedy against the individual

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

What would you propose that

13

the Court say about the degree of adequate State remedy

14

that is necessary?

15

California is enough and not go any further or --

16

Just -- what we have here in

MR. SHAH:

I think the Court should start

17

with that.

18

dispute that there would be -- any real serious dispute

19

that there would be an adequate alternative remedy.

20

think the Court could also say that, as long as the

21

adequate alternative remedy addresses the gravamen of

22

the prisoner's injuries, that should be sufficient.

23

I think it could give content to that by looking at the

24

two rationales this Court has offered for Bivens.

25

Certainly, here there hasn't been any

MR. PREIS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

The question before the Court today is

20

whether a Federal prisoner's access to constitutional

21

remedies should turn on the mere happenstance of where

22

the prisoner is detained.

have remedies under State law.

Your Honor, with regard to the
