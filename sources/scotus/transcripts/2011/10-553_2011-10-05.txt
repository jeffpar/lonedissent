ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS LAYCOCK

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. LAYCOCK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The churches do not set the criteria for

13

selecting or removing the officers of government, and

14

government does not set the criteria for selecting or

15

removing officers of the church.

16

principle, and these Respondents would repudiate it.

17

They no longer seriously argue that Cheryl Perich was

18

not a minister.

19

who are indisputably ministers can sue their churches on

20

claims that turn on their qualifications, their job

21

performance, and the rules of ministry.

22

That's a bedrock

Instead, they argue that even people

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

They would --

Mr. Laycock, would you

23

clarify one point?

You say the church decides who's

24

qualified to be a minister, but, as I understand the

25

facts here, she was never decommissioned as a minister,
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

and, beyond that, she was even recommended by the

2

officials to other parishes to be a commissioned

3

minister.

4

interferences with who is qualified to be a minister,

5

because the church was holding her out as being

6

qualified.

7

So, it's -- it's odd to say there's any

MR. LAYCOCK:

Well, she was removed from her

8

ministry at Hosanna-Tabor.

They do not have to indulge

9

in a vendetta against her and file charges with the

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, most of the

But

they've, in one form or another, created a pretext

reporting?

The reason for that is the situation that

7

How about a teacher who reports sexual

Now, we know from the news recently that

8

there was a church whose religious beliefs centered

9

around sexually exploiting women and, I believe,

10

children.

Regardless of whether it's a religious belief

11

or not, doesn't society have a right at some point to

12

say certain conduct is unacceptable, even if religious

13

-- smoking peyote?

14

can and why shouldn't we protect the people who are

15

doing what the law requires, i.e., reporting it?

16

And once we say that's unacceptable,

So, how do we deal with that situation under

your theory?

19

Under your theory, nothing survives if the

MR. LAYCOCK:

I think if you look at the

20

court of appeals cases, they have not indulged in

21

pretext inquiries for ministers.

22

is obviously a difficult case, and I would say two

23

things:

24

government could do many things to force reporting, to

25

penalize people who don't report, but a discharge claim

The case you present

We think the appropriate rule should be the

Official

1

by a minister presents the question why she was

2

discharged, and the court should stay out of that.

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The problem with that is

4

that it doesn't take account of the societal interest in

5

encouraging the reporting.

6

define the ministerial exception in the way you want, we

7

take away the incentive for reporting; we actually do

8

the opposite of what society needs.

9

MR. LAYCOCK:

And, in fact, if we -- if we

I understand that concern, and

10

that was my second point, that if you want to carve out

11

an exception for cases like child abuse where the

12

government's interest is in protecting the child, not an

13

interest in protecting the minister, when you get such a

14

case, we think you could carve out that exception.

15
16
17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How?

Give me a

theoretical framework for this.
MR. LAYCOCK:

The -- first you have to

18

identify the government's interest in regulation.

19

the government's interest is in protecting ministers

20

from discrimination, we are squarely within the heart of

21

the ministerial exception.

22

If

If the government's interest is something

23

quite different from that, like protecting the children,

24

then you can assess whether that government interest is

25

sufficiently compelling to justify interfering with the
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

relationship between the church and its ministers.

2

the government's interest is at its nadir when the claim

3

is:

4

want to tell the churches what criteria they should

5

apply for -- for selecting and removing ministers.

We want to protect these ministers as such.

But

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

We

Mr. Laycock, the ministerial

7

exception is not something new.

It has been widely

8

recognized, as Justice Sotomayor mentioned, by the

9

courts of appeals going back 40 years.

So, we can see

10

how the recognition of this exception within -- with

11

certain contours has worked out.

12

out over those past 40 years?

13

many cases, a significant number of cases, involving the

14

kinds of things that Justice Sotomayor is certainly

15

rightly concerned about, instances in which ministers

16

have been fired for reporting criminal violations and

17

that sort of thing?

MR. LAYCOCK:

And how has it worked

21

22

23

and that case ended.

25

The one case I am aware of cuts the

15

16

the tests, but this can't even be -- be litigated

17

because she is discharged.

18

there's a retaliation for even asking for a hearing

19

where these tests could -- could be applied.

So, we can look at the various tests that are

The allegation is that

it's -- it's none of the business of the government to

decide what the substantial interest of the church is.

14

MR. LAYCOCK:

That's one of my points, maybe

15

the most important of my points.

16

decisions are committed to the churches by separation of

17

church and state, but -- but beyond that, once the --

issues in this case and we won't get to other issues in

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, different

churches have different ideas about who's a minister.

14

doing, and if he's not performing any of the functions

that -- you know, not every church is hierarchical in

MR. LAYCOCK:

I understand that.

And

And lay

22

people in many churches are expected to be witnesses,

right.

So --

24

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MR. LAYCOCK:

Lay people in many --

Lay people have to be

Alderson Reporting Company

1

witnesses.

The fact that you're expected to witness to

2

the faith when the occasion arises doesn't make you --

doesn't make you a minister.

Justice indicates, many churches don't have -- some

churches don't have what we think of as professional or

And as the Chief

They're all ministers.

11

MR. LAYCOCK:

Right.

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And you said, well, that

13

-- that can be litigated, that can be investigated.

14

I suppose when we do that we say, how many secular

15

functions do you perform?

16

But you don't -- you don't even want that issue to be

17

tried.

18

And

And that's what this case is.

You say that issue can't even be explored.
MR. LAYCOCK:

How -- you know, how many

19

religious functions you perform can be explored.

20

issue that can be explored is whether she's a minister.

21

We think she clearly is.

deference to the church's understanding of whether

7

MR. LAYCOCK:

We think there should be

8

10

fraudulently declare that everyone is a minister when

11

it's not true.

12

ago.

13

You decided the Tony Alamo case 20 years

We're not defending that.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

What makes it not true?

14

What is the legal definition of "minister"?

15

That you have to lead the congregation in their

16

religious services or what?

17

MR. LAYCOCK:

What is it?

What is it?

We think -- we think you -- if

18

you teach the doctrines of the faith, if that is part of

19

your job responsibilities, to teach the doctrines of the

20

faith, we think you're a minister.

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, does that mean that

22

any religious teacher is a minister under your theory?

23

So, you know, there may be teachers in religious schools

24

who teach religious subjects, not mathematics, but are

25

not ordained or commissioned in any way as ministers.
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

2

Are they ministers?
MR. LAYCOCK:

If you're ordained or

3

commissioned, that makes it very easy.

If you teach the

4

religion class, you teach an entire class on religion,

5

we think you ought to be within this rule.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought that it was

7

part of -- it was agreed that there was no fact dispute

8

that what she did, her duties at the school, did not

9

change from when she was a contract teacher, and

10

therefore not a minister, and then she takes courses and

11

is qualified to become a minister, but what she's doing

12

at the school is the very same thing.

13

that was the basis for the -- the decision that we're

14

reviewing, that there was no difference at all in what

15

she did before she was commissioned and after she was

16

commissioned.

17

MR. LAYCOCK:

And I thought

That -- that's what the Sixth

18

Circuit said.

What they -- what -- you know, I don't

19

think that changes the nature of the functions that were

20

being performed.

21

neglected was these noncommissioned -- these teachers

22

who were not commissioned ministers, the lay and

23

contract teachers, were fill-ins only when no called

24

teacher was available, and Perich identifies only one

25

person for 1 year.

But what's relevant to that, that they

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you're isolating one

2

parish, but there was something in one of these briefs

3

that said the majority of the teachers in the Lutheran

4

schools -- let's see where it was.

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I think it was --

While Justice Ginsburg is

6

looking, I had -- I had the same impression, that

7

whether you're commissioned or not commissioned doesn't

8

necessarily mean you can't teach a religious class.

9

MR. LAYCOCK:

Well, it doesn't --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

10

And again, that's

11

something that -- that can be heard.

12

want to hear it.

13

MR. LAYCOCK:

You don't even

That's -- it is not uncommon,

14

even with ordained ministers, it's not uncommon among

15

Protestants, to recognize an ordination from a different

16

denomination that has similar teachings.

17

when they can't find a called minister to cover a class

18

and they hire another Christian from another

19

conservative Protestant denomination, they say:

20

you teach here, you're required to teach Lutheran

21

doctrine.

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So, when --

I'm sorry.

While

Going back

23

to the question Justice Kagan asked you, if one of these

24

Protestant teachers that's not Lutheran led the

25

cafeteria prayer, as they are required to, you're now
17

MS. KRUGER:

Well, Justice Scalia, if I may,

14

I don't understand Petitioner from the first half of his

15

argument to have disputed this basic point, which is

16

that the contours of the First Amendment doctrine at

issue here will depend on a balancing of interests.

That is the only way, I think, that Petitioner can

19

differentiate a generally neutrally applicable

20

application of anti-discrimination law with respect to a

21

church's choice of those who would govern it and a

22

church's retaliation against a teacher who would report

Well, Justice Scalia -That's certainly not what

the Petitioner is saying.
MS. KRUGER:

Here is where I think what the

8

core of the insight of the ministerial exception as it

9

was originally conceived is, which is that there are

10

certain relationships within a religious community that

11

are so fundamental, so private and ecclesiastical in

12

nature, that it will take an extraordinarily compelling

13

governmental interest to justify interference.

14

with health or safety, for example.

discrimination in the workplace will not be sufficient

to justify the burden.

like -- I think there are two responses that are

21

relevant to how this Court will resolve that question in

22

this case.

23

First of all, if the Court were to accept

24

the rule that Petitioner would ask it to adopt, we would

reason for firing an employee that's rooted in religious

doctrine.

4

teachers and with respect to priests is categorically

5

off limits.

6

insufficiently attentive to the relative public and

7

private interests at stake, interests that this Court

8

has repeatedly recognized are important in

9

determining freedom of association claims.

Their submission is that the hiring and

And we think that that is a rule that is

JUSTICE BREYER:

10

So that, in fact, if they

11

want to choose to the priest, you could go to the

12

Catholic Church and say they have to be women.

13

you couldn't say that.

14

distinguishing this?

That's obvious.

MS. KRUGER:

15

Right.

I mean,

So, how are you

We think that the --

16

both the private and public interests are very different

17

in the two scenarios.

18

in eradicating discrimination in the workplace is simply

19

not sufficient to justify changing the way that the

20

Catholic Church chooses its priests based on gender

21

roles that are rooted in religious doctrine.

22

The government's general interest

But the interests in this case are quite

23

different.

The government has a compelling and indeed

24

overriding interest in ensuring that individuals are not

25

prevented from coming to the government with information
32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

about illegal conduct.

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

When you say that, are you

3

not implicitly making a judgment about the relative

4

importance of the Catholic doctrine that only males can

5

be ordained as priests and the Lutheran doctrine that a

6

Lutheran should not sue the church in civil courts?

7

don't see any distinction between -- I can't reconcile

8

your position on those two issues without coming to the

9

conclusion that you think that the Catholic doctrine is

I

10

older, stronger, and entitled to more respect than the

11

Lutheran doctrine.

12

MS. KRUGER:

No, we're not -- we're not

13

drawing distinctions between the importance of a

14

particular religious tenet in a system of religious

15

belief.

matter of preserving the integrity of the rule of law,

21

fundamental interest than a woman obtaining the job that

22

the rule of law.

Ms. Kruger, if I could just

10

clarify for a second there, because you're now sounding

11

as though you want to draw a sharp line between

12

retaliation claims and substantive discrimination

13

claims, and I didn't get that from your brief.

14

that, in fact, what you're saying?

important distinction to be made between the

discrimination from the workplace and the government's

the government's interest in this case is not in

dictating to the church-operated school who it may

balance of relative public and private interests is

17

different in each case.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Do you believe, Ms. Kruger,

19

that a church has a right that's grounded in the Free

20

Exercise Clause and/or the Establishment Clause to

21

institutional autonomy with respect to its employees?

22

MS. KRUGER:

We don't see that line of

23

church autonomy principles in the Religion Clause

24

jurisprudence as such.

25

freedom of association.

We see it as a question of
We think that this case is
37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

perhaps one of the cases --

2

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So, this is to go back to

3

Justice Scalia's question, because I too find that

4

amazing, that you think that the Free -- neither the

5

Free Exercise Clause nor the Establishment Clause has

6

anything to say about a church's relationship with its

7

own employees.

8
9

MS. KRUGER:

We think that this is one of

the cases that Employment Division v. Smith may have

10

been referring to when it referred to free association

11

claims that are reinforced by free exercise concerns.

12

It's certainly true that the association's claim to

13

autonomy in this case is one that is deeply rooted.

14

concerns about how it exercises its religion -- those

15

two things merge in some ways in that respect.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And

But --

I don't think they merge at

17

all.

Smith didn't involve employment by a church.

It

18

had nothing to do with who the church could employ.

19

don't -- I don't see how that has any relevance to this.

I

I would -- I didn't understand your answer

20
21

to the Chief Justice's question.

You -- you say that

22

there were different institutional values or government

23

values involved with respect to a -- to a Catholic

24

priest than there is with respect to this Lutheran

25

minister.

Let's assume that a Catholic priest is -- is
38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

removed from his duties because he married, okay?

2

And -- and he claims:

3

the real reason is because I threatened to sue the

4

church.

Okay?

5

No, that's not the real reason;

So, that reason is just pretextual.

Would you -- would you allow the government

6

to go -- go into the -- into the dismissal of the

7

Catholic priest to see whether indeed it -- it was

8

pretextual?

9
10

MS. KRUGER:

I think the answer is no,

Justice Scalia --

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

12

MS. KRUGER:

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

from the Lutheran minister?

15

MS. KRUGER:

Why?

-- but that is the -Why is that any different

I would begin with looking at

16

the burdens on association under the balancing test.

17

think that the core of the understanding of the

18

ministerial exception, as it was elaborated in the lower

19

courts, is that there is a fundamental difference

20

between governmental regulation that operates to

21

interfere with the relationship between a church and

22

those who would govern it, those who would preach the

23

word to the congregations, those who would administer

24

its sacraments, on the one hand, and the more public

25

relationship between a church and a school teacher and
39
Alderson Reporting Company

I

Official

1

others that provide services to the public at large.

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I think that's saying

3

nothing different than what the Chief Justice suggests,

4

that you think the one is more -- is more important to

5

-- to Catholics than the other is to Lutherans.

6

MS. KRUGER:

I don't think it's a question

7

of the importance of either function to the -- the

8

religious association.

9

of permissible governmental regulation.

It's a question of the realm

JUSTICE BREYER:

10

Yes, but then you have to

11

say that it's more important to let people go to court

12

to sue about sex discrimination than it is for a woman

13

to get a job.

14

So -- so, I'm stuck.

I can't say that one way or the other.

And since I'm really -- this is tough and

15
16

I'm stuck on this, I don't see how you can avoid going

17

into religion to some degree.

18

this is really a minister, for example, and what kind of

19

minister.

20

not going to do that, you're going to go look to see

21

what are their religious tenets?

22

right involved.

23

You have to decide if

That gets you right involved.

Or if you're

And that gets you

I just can't see a way of getting out of

24

something -- of getting out of the whole thing.

see how to do it.

I don't

So, suppose you said in case of doubt
40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

like that, we'll try what Congress suggested.

2

we have here a borderline case of ministry, not the

3

heartland case.

4

a borderline case the constitutional issue goes away,

5

and what Congress said is okay.

6

to prove is you have to prove that -- the church has to

7

show that the applicant was disciplined, or whatever,

8

because she didn't conform to the religious tenets.

9

right?

10

And now

So, you say, all right, where you have

So, now what you have

All

That's what they have to show.
And I'm sorry; they maybe only make a prima

11

facie case, but they got to show it, and if they don't

12

show that there was at least some evidence to that

13

effect and that somebody knew about the religious tenet

14

and there was something like that -- maybe it's in the

15

air, as is obvious with Justice Alito's question, but

16

where it isn't in the air, you'd have to make a showing.

Now -- now, I see that's an interference,

but I don't see how you avoid an interference someplace

or the other.

21

Otherwise, you're going to get into who

So, what's the answer to this dilemma?

At

22

the moment I'm making an argument for following what

23

Congress said, go back and try it that way, and if they

24

can show in this case and she shows in this case nobody

25

ever thought of the religious tenet, nobody told me,
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

they didn't read it, then she's going to win.

2

they come in and show that they really did this because

3

of their religious tenet, they'll win.

4

MS. KRUGER:

And if

What about that?

Justice Breyer, I think that

5

that is a perfectly appropriate way to come at this

6

case, although it skips over sort of the initial

7

inquiry, which is into whether or not the application of

8

the regulation to the particular employment relationship

9

results in an unwarranted interference.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, it does have the

11

virtue of deciding a statutory question before a tough

12

constitutional question.

13

sometimes do, that seems bizarre, but I thought that was

14

the basic rule.

15

MS. KRUGER:

And I agree, with what we

I think that that's absolutely

16

right, Justice Breyer.

And I think the next question

17

becomes, with respect to adjudicating a particular case,

18

whether deciding the case would require the court to

19

decide disputed matters of religious doctrine or to

20

second-guess essentially subjective --

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, if -- if the plaintiff

22

proceeded that way, would she be entitled to -- I assume

23

she would -- introduce testimony by experts on

24

Lutheranism, theologians, professors of religion about

25

how the -- about this -- this tenet, and it isn't
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

really -- they might say, well, it's really not that

2

strong, and it once was, but it's faded, and it's not --

3

it's not widely enforced.

4

And then you'd have experts on the other

5

side, and you'd have a court and a lay jury deciding how

6

important this really is to Lutherans.

7

would play out?

8
9

MS. KRUGER:

12

No, it's not how it would play

out.
JUSTICE ALITO:

10
11

Is that how that

that?

How are you going to avoid

I just don't see it.
MS. KRUGER:

Any inquiry into the validity

13

of a particular religious doctrine is simply irrelevant

14

to the adjudication of the dispute, which is designed to

15

find out just one thing, which is whether the --

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

No, it's not irrelevant.

17

I've seen dozens and dozens and dozens of pretext cases,

18

and in practically every pretext case that I've seen,

19

one of the central issues is whether the reason that was

20

proffered by the employer is the real reason, is an

21

important reason for that, for that employer, and

22

whether they really think it's important and whether

23

they apply it across the board.

24

big part of the case.

25

That's almost always a

And once you get into that, you're going to
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

get into questions of -- of religious doctrine.

2

don't see it.

3

I just

Let me give you an example of a real case.

4

A nun wanted to be -- wanted a tenured position teaching

5

canon law at Catholic University, and she claimed that

6

she was denied tenure because of her -- because of her

7

gender.

8
9

Now, there the university might argue, no,
she was -- and did argue -- she's denied tenure because

10

of the quality of her -- of her scholarship.

11

now, if you try that pretext issue, the issue is going

12

to be what is the real quality of her canon law

13

scholarship?

14

jury decide whether the particular writings on canon law

15

are -- make a contribution to canon law scholarship.

16

How can something like that be tried, without getting

17

into religious issues?

18

And, okay,

And you're going to have the judge and the

MS. KRUGER:

If the only way that the

19

plaintiff has to show that that may not have been the

20

employer's real reason was a subjective judgment about

21

the quality of canon law scholarship, then judgment has

22

to be entered for the employer, because the plaintiff

23

has no viable way, consistent with the Establishment

24

Clause, of demonstrating that wasn't the employer's real

25

reason.
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

If, on the other hand, the plaintiff has

2

evidence that no one ever raised any objections to the

3

quality of her scholarship, but they raised objections

4

to women serving in certain roles in the school, and

5

those roles were not ones that were required to be

6

filled by persons of a particular gender, consistent

7

with religious beliefs, then that's a case in which a

8

judge can instruct a jury that it's job is not to

9

inquire into the validity of the subjective judgment,

10

just as juries are often instructed that their job is

11

not to determine whether an employer's business judgment

12

was fair or correct, but only whether the employer was

13

motivated by discrimination or retaliation.

does not count as a minister?

12

MR. DELLINGER:

I believe that there is an

13

exemption grounded in the Religion Clauses.

14

that religious organizations will win -- will prevail in

15

many cases in which a comparable civil organization

16

would not prevail.

I'm just asking you to

exception and to tell me who you think counts as a

21

minister, and why the woman in this case does not.

22

MR. DELLINGER:

Well, in our view, if that

23

was the test, then we would say that the court of

24

appeals was correct in holding that she was not a

minister, and the reason -- the principal reason is she

The

Those are important.

So, he is not a minister?
MR. DELLINGER:

Chief Justice Roberts, I do

11

not want to suggest that it's a very good approach to

12

try to decide who's a minister and who's not a minister.

13

That's what's wrong with Professor Laycock's categorical

14

approach, because it's -- it's both over- and

15

under-inclusive.

16

fact, no religious reason offered --

17

It sweeps in cases where there is, in

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's only a bad approach if

18

we adopt your test.

Why isn't it a perfectly reasonable

19

test whether the person -- although the person may have

20

a lot of secular duties, whether the person has

21

substantial religious responsibilities?

22

MR. DELLINGER:

And the reason that is not a

23

satisfactory test is that it fails to take account of

24

the important governmental interests -- for example, in

25

this case -- in having everyone have access to the -- to
47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the courts.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, but that isn't -- but

3

that isn't the problem.

4

I don't know how substantial these interests are

5

religiously.

6

itself considers what they do from a religious

7

perspective.

8
9

The problem, it seems to me, is

I don't know how substantial the religion

So, let's go back to Justice Alito's
problem.

And now on the ministerial issue, we call the

10

synods, we call the how certain was it, how central is

11

it to the heart of the religion, what they're actually

12

doing, and we replicate exactly what he said, in respect

13

to the problem of religious tenet, now in respect to the

14

problem of religious minister.
And maybe you can tell me we don't have to

15
16

go into the one or the other, but I've had enough of

17

these cases in the lower court to know they are really

18

hard.

19

no way to avoid going into one or the other, and,

20

therefore, I think, rather than try this constitutional

21

matter, let's go to the one Congress suggested.

People believe really different things, and I see

22

MR. DELLINGER:

Well -Now, what do you --

that's -MR. DELLINGER:

Alderson Reporting Company

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's the state of the

argument that you're walking into, I think.

3

MR. DELLINGER:

If we go to Congress,

4

Congress made it quite clear how this case should be

5

resolved, because Congress expressly did not apply the

6

religious exemptions of the ADA to retaliation.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

No.

I don't agree with

8

that.

I think -- I think what it says is a religious

9

organization may require that all applicants and

10

employees conform to the religious tenets.

It put that

11

in the section defining defenses.

12

of the right, and when it forbids retaliation, it says

13

forbids retaliation against an individual for the

14

exercise of any right granted.

The defenses are part

And, therefore, I don't believe that a

15
16

person who has failed to violate the substantive section

17

could be held up normally.

18

I mean, I don't --

19

MR. DELLINGER:

20
21

Well, we differ on that,

but -JUSTICE BREYER:

I can think it's pretty

22

easy to read that exception, even though it's in a

23

different subchapter, into the retaliation exception.

24

And assume for me that that's so.

25

MR. DELLINGER:

It is still the case that it
49

Alderson Reporting Company

is a constitutional matter.

2

allowing citizens to have access to its courts and to

3

its agencies is paramount in cases like child abuse,

reporting of school safety problems, and others.

7

Would you -- take the firing of the Catholic priest

reason is --

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. DELLINGER:

Why not?
-- that there is -- and that

13

points out, Justice Scalia, that there are ample

14

doctrines to protect church autonomy.

position.

MR. DELLINGER:

I think, in that case, that

2

that is very likely to fail because you're going to run

3

into (a) issues of religious doctrine or evaluations of

4

distinctly religious matters, like EEOC v. Catholic

5

University.

6

Those doctrines still stand.
The problem with the -- this categorical

7

exception is it sweeps in cases like this one, where the

8

well-pleaded complaint in this case simply says, I was

9

dismissed from my employment because I said I was going

10

to make a report to the EEOC.

11

reinstatement.

12

There's no need --

13

And she's not seeking

She just wants the economic loss.

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, if I could just come

14

back to the example of the canon law professor, because

15

I still don't see how the -- the approach that the

16

Solicitor General is recognizing -- is recommending

17

could -- can eliminate the problems involved in pretext.

18

So, the -- as I understood her -- her answer, it was

19

that you couldn't look into the question of whether the

20

professor's canon law scholarship was really good canon

21

law scholarship, but you could try the issue of sex

22

discrimination based on other evidence.

23

there's some stray remarks here and there about a woman

24

teaching canon law.

25

So, maybe

Now, a response to that might be that wasn't
51
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the real reason, and if you just look at the scholarship

2

and you see how miserable it is and how inconsistent it

3

is with church doctrine, you can see that that's the

4

real reason.

5
6

So, you just cannot get away from evaluating
religious issues.

7

MR. DELLINGER:

This is not a problem that

8

is unique to ministerial employees, which is why this is

9

both over- and under-inclusive.

When you -- this is a

10

circumstance in which an organization is going into the

11

public arena providing a public service, and in that

12

situation, it ought to be governed by the same rules --

13

Justice Scalia, you said this case is not like

14

Employment Division v. Smith, but under Employment

15

Division v. Smith, we know that the State could forbid a

16

school from -- a religious school from using peyote in

17

its ceremonies, but under Petitioner's submission, they

18

could fire any employee who reported that use of peyote

19

to civil authorities, and that employee would have no

20

recourse.

21

We know that under U.S. v. Lee, an Amish

22

employer has to comply with the Social Security laws,

23

but under their submission, the employer could fire

24

without recourse any employee who called noncompliance

25

to the attention of the EEOC.

We believe that -- that

52
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

you can trust to Congress on these hard areas where

2

there needs to be additional accommodations; Congress

3

could make them, just as Justice Scalia suggested.

4

ministerial exemption has a long history, Justice Alito,

5

but in almost every circuit, it did not apply to

6

teachers.

7

So, I mean -JUSTICE ALITO:

It antedated -- did it not

8

antedate the enactment of the Americans with

9

Disabilities Act?

10
11
12

The

MR. DELLINGER:

That is correct.

When that

was enacted -JUSTICE ALITO:

So, wouldn't -- shouldn't we

13

assume that Congress -- that Congress assumed that it

14

would continue to apply to the ADA, just as it applied

15

to Title VII.

16

MR. DELLINGER:

It -- in the lower courts

17

did not apply it as sweepingly as to teachers.

18

I think we have this debate with Justice Breyer about

19

whether -- whether you can say that Congress

20

specifically excluded retaliation -- retaliation cases.

21

And I --

But remember that that doctrine emerged at a

22

time when this Court had a position that religious

23

organizations could not participate in getting public

24

funding, even when they were providing remedial services

25

to low-income students.

We repudiated that doctrine in
53

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Agostini v. Felton and where the Court said that you're

2

entitled to participate in providing public services on

3

the same basis as all other organizations.

4

that you should comply, in some instances, with the same

5

rules, when you leave the cloister and go into the

6

public arena and provide public services.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

public funds the same way public schools do?

Mr. Laycock, I'm not

any kind, genuine or not, for firing someone that's

associated with it, whether minister or not, that that

invokes the exception.

right?

Am I hearing your argument

6

MR. LAYCOCK:

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

8

No.
All right.

So, why is

there a difference?

9

MR. LAYCOCK:

The position of minister is

10

categorically special because that is committed to the

11

church in the system of separation of church and state.

12

You may have religious questions when they dismiss the

13

janitor, but the level of sensitivity is not remotely

14

the same.

And -- and -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So, you're limiting your

test to whether that person is a minister.

"minister" for me again.

MR. LAYCOCK:

So, define

A minister is a person who

23

holds ecclesiastical office in the church or who

24

exercises important religious functions, most obviously

25

including teaching of the faith.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Laycock, Mr.

Dellinger

2

has some -- some points here about the way in which the

3

ministerial exception relates or doesn't relate to

4

Employment Division v. Smith.

5

in order to make an argument for the ministerial

6

exception, you in some sense have to say that

7

institutional autonomy is different from individual

8

conscience, that we've said in Smith that state

9

interests can trump individual conscience.

And it seems to me that

And you want

10

us to say that they can't trump institutional autonomy.

11

So, why is that?

12

MR. LAYCOCK:

It's not that institutions are

13

different from individuals.

14

institutional governance of the church is at a prior

15

step.

16

religious teachings after they're formulated.

17

selection of ministers is about the process by which

18

those religious teachings will be formulated.

19

Smith distinguishes those cases --

It is that the
