ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER LANDAU

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. LANDAU:

Justice Scalia, and may it

please the Court:

11

In section 16(b) of the 1934 Exchange Act,

12

Congress created a cause of action to allow securities

13

issuers to recover short-swing profits from certain

14

covered persons, but specified that a lawsuit must be

15

brought 2 years after the date the short-swing profit

16

was realized.

17

date the defendants filed a section 16(a) report, as the

18

Ninth Circuit and Respondents would like to have it.

19

Nor does the statute say 2 years after the date the

20

plaintiff discovers the short-swing transaction, as the

21

Government would like to rewrite it.

22

The statute doesn't say 2 years after the

I'd like to make two basic points here

23

today:

First, as this Court recognized in Lampf, the

24

2-year time limit in section 16(b) is best read as a

25

period of repose that can't be extended at all; and,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

4
1

second, even if section 16(b)'s 2-year time limit could

2

be extended, the doctrine of equitable tolling wouldn't

3

apply to extend the time limit here, where the plaintiff

4

didn't act diligently to bring a claim and didn't prove

5

that any extraordinary circumstances precluded her from

6

filing.

7

Court should reverse the Ninth Circuit's decision and

8

remand the case with directions to dismiss the complaint

9

as untimely.

The upshot of these two points is that this

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

On your first -Counsel, would -On your first point, you

13

cite Lampf, but Lampf had two limits.

14

what was it, 1 year from whatever, from discovery.

15

then it set an outer limit at 3 years, and it was the

16

same thing in Merck.

17

what seems to me a plain vanilla statute of limitations

18

that is traditionally subject to waiver, equitable

19

tolling.

20

that gives you one limit and then sets a further limit

21

that will be the outer limit.

22

So, it said -And

Here we just say -- it just has

We don't have that special kind of statute

MR. LANDAU:

Your Honor, with respect, it's

23

certainly true that a two-pronged time limit underscores

24

that the outer prong is a period of repose, but there's

25

certainly no magic words that Congress has to use.

Alderson Reporting Company

It

doesn't have to use a two-pronged time limit to

2

establish the outer limit as a period of repose.

3

fact, that's really the lesson of this Court's decision

4

in TRW and in Beggerly and Brockamp, that the -- the

equitable tolling applies, isn't some kind -- is just

19

MR. LANDAU:

The key point, Your Honor, is

20

that this Congress in the 1934 Exchange Act was

21

carefully attuned to the issue of time limits.

22

Congress -- there was -- there was a lot of discussion

23

of this.

24

established a liability and just didn't focus on this

25

issue, as often happens, and left it to background

This is a not a situation where Congress

Congress thought long and hard about this.
With respect to the two-prong provisions,

4

those are the fraud provisions that were set at an outer

5

limit of 3 years.

7

wait the whole 3 years; if they've discovered the facts

8

underlying their claim, we want them to bring it within

9

a year.

10
11

And then they actually created a

So, they used discovery to shorten the time,

not to extend it.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Right.

But I guess I'm

12

still not understanding why, if you look at this

13

provision, you would think of this as anything other

14

than an ordinary statute of limitations.

15

about this provision -- or, I don't mean to -- to -- I

16

mean, you can -- you can make structural arguments.

17

-- but, you know, what factors do you think in this

18

provision makes it a statute of repose?

19

MR. LANDAU:

What is it

Two things, Your Honor.

But

First,

20

I'd like to just finish on the structural point; and we

21

also have a textual argument.

22

With respect to the structure, this, let's

23

not forget, was enacted at the same time and as part of

24

the same statute as these other provisions that did use

25

discovery provisions to shorten the time limit.

statute, but it didn't do it with respect to these kinds

of violations.

4

to call it, reads very differently from the two-pronged

5

positions that we've interpreted in the past.

6

This statute of limitations, I'm going

MR. LANDAU:

Again, Your Honor, I think one

7

point, just to respond to that and as well to Justice

8

Ginsburg's question, the -- the typical textual hook for

9

a statute of repose is that it's keyed off of the

10

defendant's conduct -- 2 years after the defendant does

11

X, Y, or Z.

12

Dictionary for this proposition in our brief.

13

Seventh Circuit, Justice Posner, had an opinion just

14

last week underscoring this point, the Hy-Vee case, that

15

said the typical statute of limitations actually says 2

16

years after the cause of action accrued or after the

17

plaintiff discovered, but when you're -- when -- again,

18

we don't think -- in this case, we are not relying

19

solely on the textual thing, but in terms of numbers of

20

guideposts, this is not your classic statute of

21

limitation.

22

lot of them key off of accrual.

23

That is -- as we quoted Black's Law
The

If you actually start looking at them, a

JUSTICE ALITO:

Is that -- is that true?

24

we were to look at all the statutes of limitations in

25

Alderson Reporting Company

If

9
1

generally or exclusively drafted like section 1658, the

2

general statute of limitations provisions, and are

3

geared to or are triggered by the accrual of the action

4

rather than some event?

5

MR. LANDAU:

Your Honor, I think we can't

6

say that there is a bright-line rule.

7

again, I think the most we can say is that the classic

8

formulation of a statute of repose is to key a time

9

limit off of the defendant's conduct as opposed to the

10

accrual.

11

Congress --

And, again -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, the problem is

12

that the injury here is the defendant's conduct, meaning

13

if the nature of the claim, as is here, that someone has

14

received a profit they're not entitled to, then the

15

injury is the same.

16

shareholders or the corporation, not to the insider.

17

So --

The profit belonged to the

18

MR. LANDAU:

Clearly to the -- yes.

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- textually the nature

20

of the claim here is the very injury, plaintiff's

21

injury.

22

MR. LANDAU:

Well, Your Honor, again, one of

23

the things about this statute that's kind of odd, it's a

24

prophylactic statute that doesn't even require any

25

injury.

I mean, it just says there has got to be

Alderson Reporting Company

10

disgorgement to the corporation.

2

different --

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It's a little bit

Well, disgorgement is

4

injury, meaning that it's something that -- that you're

5

taking away from someone else.

6

MR. LANDAU:

But it's taking it away from

7

the defendant.

It doesn't actually mean that actually

8

somebody else would have earned that money.

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Tell me what logic there

10

is in reading this as a statute of repose, other than

11

your argument about finality and its importance.

12

MR. LANDAU:

I think --

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

If we take your

14

adversary's position that this statute of limitations

15

was geared under an understanding that an insider would

16

in fact make the requirements -- would file the

17

statements required by 16(a), then it makes absolute

18

sense to think of it as a statute of repose.

19

Congress understood that some wouldn't do the statutory

20

requirement and file in a timely manner, why wouldn't

21

equitable tolling be a more appropriate way to look at

22

this?

23

MR. LANDAU:

But if

I think the key point, Your

24

Honor, is to look at the 1934 Exchange Act as a whole,

25

which includes not only this provision but also

Alderson Reporting Company

11

out-and-out-fraud provisions that are for intentional,

2

real hard-core insider trading.

5

That would be sections

There is no question that Congress

And then that raises the question that

6

Justice Ginsburg started with, which is, do you have to

7

have a two-prong limit?

8

you don't -- there's no magic words, as TRW, Beggerly,

9

and Brockamp show us.

And the answer to that is no,

You just have to try to make

sense of the statute as a whole.

11

have wanted to give repose to intentional fraudsters but

12

not give repose to a defendant in a purely prophylactic

15

And Congress would not

I think that's the fundamental

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, it's -- it's not

17

that 16(a) expresses; that is, Congress wanted these

18

trades to be reported and to have the form filed, Form 4

19

filed.

20

provision, 16(a) is.

21

it to operate to immunize a defendant who has not made

22

that filing and who has concealed what was supposed to

23

be reported in 16 -- under 16(a)?

24
25

I mean, there's an objective

So, it's a -- it's a disclosure-forcing

2

3

somebody who would be liable under 18(c) or 9(e), has

4

done kind of to conceal it.

5

believed, because it was creating this vast new

6

liability --

7

Again, Congress was creating
A fraudster by definition, as

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yet, Congress still

Judge Posner, Mr. Landau,

8

has a theory for why it is that fraud is treated

9

differently from the 16(b) offenses, and it's that it's

10

much more important to prevent strategic behavior

11

involving timing in fraud suits -- the stock price goes

12

up, the stock price goes down -- whereas, in these

13

suits, damages are fixed.

14

where you bring them.

15

to set a clear limit.

16

It doesn't really matter

MR. LANDAU:

So, it's not nearly as important

Well, like many of Judge

17

Posner's theories, it's -- it's a very clever theory,

18

but in a sense, it misses the fundamental truth that

19

when Congress is granting repose, it is trying to allow

20

people to turn the page on something in their past.

21

idea that Congress would grant repose to more culpable

22

people but not to less culpable people --

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

The

Well, you have one theory,

24

which -- which deals with culpability; and he has

25

another theory, which deals with strategic behavior.

Alderson Reporting Company

And I don't know how to pick between those two theories,

2

to tell you the truth.

3

one Congress was thinking about.

4

and let's look at this provision, and this provision

5

looks like an ordinary vanilla statute of limitations.

6

MR. LANDAU:

The text doesn't suggest which
And that puts me back,

Well, again, the only thing

7

I'll say on repose before -- and I'd like to turn

8

then -- because we certainly don't need repose to win

9

this case, and -- and while we think it is best

10

characterized, this Court in Lampf had occasion to look

11

at all of the various time limits and see how they all

12

worked together.

13

16(b) as a statute of repose.

14

And this Court characterized section

To be sure, that was dicta because Lampf,

15

itself was not a 16(b) case.

16

was a statement or it was a recognition that came after

17

looking at all of these, and it would be strange now to

18

say that, in fact, the 16(b) time period is

19

potentially -- the Court said it was more restrictive,

20

and both the majority and Justice Kennedy in dissent

21

agreed that it was a statute of repose.

2

MR. LANDAU:

Lampf stands as a landmark.

3

But -- but let me make clear, Your Honor.

4

here today doesn't depend on this being a statute of

5

repose, because even if this 2-year time limit --

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

Our position

Before you turn away from

7

the statute of repose, could I just ask you one more

8

question --

9

MR. LANDAU:

10

Absolutely.

JUSTICE ALITO:

-- on -- on that?

If -- if

11

16(a) reports are not filed, how likely is it that a

12

potential 16(b) plaintiff will find out within the

13

2-year period that there were these trades?

14

MR. LANDAU:

Your Honor, they can find out

15

in many ways, the same ways that any other securities

16

plaintiff, including a fraud securities plaintiff, can

17

find out.

18

can be examined.

19

investigations.

20

come up in an estate discovery -- estate or divorce

21

proceedings.

22

informers, brokers, counterparts -- counterparties.

23

There are corporate books and records that
There are other SEC filings and SEC
There's other litigation.

This could

There are whistle blowers, confidential

Again, if Congress had wanted the section

24

16(a) disclosure to be the trigger under section 16(b),

25

it could have done so.

And, in fact, as we noted in our

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

15
1

brief, there was an early draft in the House that

2

created a two-prong provision and established for -- you

3

know, it's an outer limit of 3 years and an inner limit

4

of 6 months after the 16(a) disclosure.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

other filings that might disclose this?

7

MR. LANDAU:

What would -- what are the

4

But, again, I think the point here is that,

5

regardless of whether this is repose, even if you say

6

that this can be extended, it certainly can't be

7

extended in the way that the Ninth Circuit extended it.

8

And we and the SEC, the Government, agree on this:

9

the Ninth Circuit adopted this absolute black-letter

rule that says it is tolled -- it doesn't even start to

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How about the Second

Circuit rule?
MR. LANDAU:

The Second Circuit rule is more

15

of a notice approach that says that it -- but, again,

16

Your Honor, the problem with the Second Circuit's

17

approach is that it doesn't reflect traditional

18

background norms of equitable tolling.

19

it's not a statute of repose, then what do you do just

20

to figure out what Congress would have wanted?

21

Congress legislates against the -- the -- the backdrop

22

of these kind of equitable doctrines.

23

what equitable tolling consists of.

24
25

Then, if you say

You say

So, let's look at

This Court in many cases over the years -it's been dealing with equitable tolling since almost

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

18
1

the first days of the Court, well into the 19th century.

2

In the most recent cases, the Court has made clear, in

3

the Holland case, for instance, just two terms ago, that

4

equitable tolling traditionally has two minimum

5

requirements.

6

First, there has to be diligence on the part

7

of the plaintiff.

8

reasonable -- did the plaintiff know or would a

9

reasonably diligent shareholder have reason to know of

10
11

And in this context that means does a

the claim; and, second, extraordinary circumstances.
And so, with respect to the Second Circuit's

12

decision in Litzler, Your Honor, that you mentioned, I

13

think it departs from traditional equitable tolling

14

in -- in a couple of ways.

15

it to actual knowledge.

16

have known," which again is the background rule, as we

22

of culpability on the defendant's part.

23

Jacobs, in footnote 5 of Litzler, dropped a footnote

would give rise potentially to equitable tolling, and he

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Landau, if we were to

8

agree with you on one or both of those two things,

9

wouldn't the normal course be to remand?

10
11

And what's

your best argument for why we should decide it?
MR. LANDAU:

Our best argument, Your Honor,

12

is that the district court in this case already decided

13

the very issue here.

14

undisputed, just on the pleadings, that -- that they

15

knew or should have known.

16

The district court said it is

This case is probably the most egregious

17

kind of case that you can see for this proposition

18

because everything here is a replay of the IPO

19

litigation and even the Billing case that came all the

20

way to this Court.

21

months after this Court decided Billing.

22

particular -- they have now -- the Respondents have come

23

and said, well, what we didn't know here was group, and

24

we didn't know that the -- the underwriters were in a

25

conspiracy with the issuer insiders, and that was the

This case was filed just a few

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And --

We have to accept the

3

plaintiffs' allegations as true.

4

that they really knew or they should have known.

5

at this stage, we can't make that judgment because we

6

have to accept the plaintiffs' allegations as true.

7

MR. LANDAU:

You may well be right
But,

Correct, Your Honor, but you

8

are entitled, in deciding that, to look at their own

9

pleadings.

10

And there's two important things from their

own pleadings.

11

First, if you look at their complaint,

12

it's -- it alleges lock-up as its theory of group.

13

says that the plaintiffs and the -- the underwriters and

14

the issuer insiders formed a 16(a) group because they

15

had these lock-up agreements.

16

agreements were publicly known as early as the

17

prospectus of these IPOs.

18

agreement was no secret.

19

It

Well, those lock-up

So, the -- the lock-up

Second, they say, well, we -- even though,

20

like, lock-up might have been out there, we didn't know

21

there was this underpricing-based conspiracy.

22

assuming they could try and slice and dice it like that

23

according to the -- the legal theory, the fact is in

24

their motion to dismiss in the district court, they

25

cited -- this is docket 58 in the district court, pages

2

literature regarding a conspiracy between underwriters

3

and issuer insiders that they say gives legitimacy to

4

their substantive claim.

5

articles, including a 2004 article -- again, 2005 would

6

be 2 years before they filed.

But that includes lots of

So, they are relying in their opposition to

our motion to dismiss on an article -- there's a lengthy

this particular theory.

11

unnecessary because the -- the pleaded facts by the

12

plaintiff themselves show this is untimely as a matter

13

of law.

So, basically, a remand is

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY B. WALL

18

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE

19
20
21

MR. WALL:

Justice Scalia, and may it please

the Court:
I'd like to start where Justices Ginsburg

22

and Kagan did, because if you picked up this statute, it

23

would look for all intents and purposes like an ordinary

24

statute of limitations.

25

has Congress rebutted that presumption of equitable

And the question then is, how

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

22
1

tolling either as a matter of text, context, or

2

structure?

3

And as I understand it, Petitioners have two

4

basic arguments, both of which are incorrect.

The first

5

is textual.

6

the complained-of event.

7

too much weight on that, Justice Alito, is because if

8

they looked through the statutes and the Court's cases,

9

they would come across cases like Exploration Company or

They say, well, it runs from the time of
But the reason they can't put

10

Delaware State College, where the statute ran from the

11

time of the complained-of event, and this Court treated

12

it as an ordinary statute of limitations subject to

13

equitable tolling; and they'd come across Beggerly,

14

which ran from accrual.

15

of repose not subject to equitable tolling.

16

And yet, the Court said statute

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, if you were drafting a

17

statute of repose, how would you phrase it other than

18

the way this is phrased?

19

MR. WALL:

I think normally what Congress

20

does is it says there should be no jurisdiction after a

21

particular time, because it's not trying to

22

differentiate among the application of different

23

equitable background principles.

24

But there are statutes --

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Gee, but we've -- we've

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

23
1

said that, under our recent jurisprudence anyway, we

2

would -- we would treat that as a statute of

3

limitations.

4

statute of limitations subject to tolling.

And I assume we'd treat it like a normal

5

MR. WALL:

Justice --

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You think whenever --

7

whenever we encounter a -- a statute of limitations that

8

is -- is phrased in jurisdictional term, there can be no

9

tolling?

10

MR. WALL:

I think, Justice Scalia, that

11

where you have statutes that say there shall be no

12

jurisdiction after a particular time, this Court has

13

read them to cut off equitable tolling after that time.

14

But Congress could have written the statute to say the

15

time limit shall not be tolled.

16

like that.

17

be no tolling except in particular circumstances,

18

because Congress has considered it more finely.

19

they could make the prohibition absolute.

20

And there are statutes

Now, most of those statutes say there shall

But

And the second argument that I understand

21

Petitioners to have is basically structural.

22

well, look, they borrowed the language from the outer

23

prong of the two-prong limit.

24
25

JUSTICE ALITO:

They say,

Before you get to that, do

you have an example of a -- a classic statute of repose

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

24
1

that I could look at to see how they should be phrased,

2

and not one that says that there shall be tolling --

3

there shall not be tolling except in some circumstances,

4

one that just says this is it; no tolling whatsoever?

5
6

MR. WALL:

You mean other than statutes as

in Merck and Lampf where there were tiered structures?

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

8

MR. WALL:

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

10

Right.

Right.

There --

MR. WALL:

A stand-alone provision.

I think that the statute in

11

Beggerly was an example where the Court said, even

12

though it runs from accrual, it incorporates a discovery

13

rule and it sets a 12-year limit.

14

contextually -- I mean, I don't think there is any

15

classic formulation.

16

can't point you to anything, because the courts always

17

look to all the indicia of statutory meaning:

18

context, and structure.

19

create a statute of limitations or repose.

20

And so, textually and

I think that's why Petitioners

text,

So, the same language can

So, in Lampf and Merck, if those statutes

21

hadn't had a two-tiered structure, just the language of

22

the outer prong as the statute alone, I think the Court

23

would have treated it as a statute of limitations.

24

Court didn't say in Lampf that language creates a

25

statute of repose, full stop.

It drew a structural

Alderson Reporting Company

The

Official

25
1

inference by looking at both of the prongs and comparing

2

them to each other.

3

So, when Petitioners say, whoa, but they

4

borrowed the language of the outer limit and we know

5

that's repose, well, we only know it's repose in the

6

two-prong provisions because of their structure.

7

this provision doesn't have that structure.

8
9

And

So, I don't think I can point you to any
classic formulation because the same words can be either

10

a limitation or repose, depending on what else Congress

11

does in that statute.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't -- I think you

13

understate the -- the strength of Petitioners' argument

14

in this regard.

15

3 years unless the plaintiff knows sooner than that, and

16

then you say 2 years unless the plaintiff knows earlier

17

than that, and then you say 2 years -- it seems to me

18

that the implication is 2 years, period.

19

plaintiff knows earlier, later, doesn't matter.

20

It seems to me where you say, you know,

MR. WALL:

Whether the

Justice Scalia, I don't know what

21

else to say except that that would overrule Exploration

22

Company and Delaware State College.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's what we said in

24

Merck.

I mean, wasn't Merck just like that?

25

cause of action can be or whatever -- may not be

Alderson Reporting Company

It says a

Official

26
1

brought -- may be brought not later than the earlier of

2

2 years after the discovery of the facts or 5 years

3

after the violation.

4
5

I take it that means 5 years after the
violation.

6

Forget about the discovery of the facts.
MR. WALL:

Well, that's right, but the --

7

the reason that that language created a period of

8

repose --

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

10

MR. WALL:

Because they were both --

-- was because of the structural

11

inference.

12

if the statute just said no suit shall be brought more

13

than X years after the violation.

14

I took Justice Scalia's hypothetical to be

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, but what if those

15

three provisions had been -- you know, followed each

16

other immediately?

17

know -- with a cutoff that would make it shorter, and

18

2 years with a cutoff that would make it shorter, and

19

then a third one just says 2 years.

20

would be no implication that the 2 years means 2 years,

21

period?

22

You know, 3 years unless, you

MR. WALL:

You think there

I think the implication would be

23

that, in the others, Congress created a period of repose

It could have said no suit

And Congress has done that in other

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If you extinguish the

It just says you can't get a remedy if you

11

no claim after X time, and that would certainly be a

12

repose.

13
14

But there are statutes that say you have

You have no right anymore after that.
MR. WALL:

No question.

That's certainly

If the Court -JUSTICE SCALIA:

point because I want to know whether you differ from the

18

20

the same result if indeed the violation had been

21

nonintentional.

22

I think you'd better go to the other

As I understand the

Now, do you take that position as well?

MR. WALL:

No, Justice Scalia.

I think that

23

is the one place in everything Mr. Landau said where

24

there is daylight between the Petitioners' position and

25

ours.

In the Government's view, the traditional

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

28
1

equitable rule is the statute is tolled until the

2

plaintiff has actual or constructive notice of the facts

3

underlying her claim.

4

concealment of those facts by the defendant that gives

5

rise to --

6

It doesn't matter whether the

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But is that right, Mr. Wall?

7

I mean, don't we usually look when we're thinking about

8

equitable doctrines as whether the defendant has clean

9

hands?

You know, whether the defendant is culpable or

10

not seems to matter a good deal when we're thinking

11

about considerations of equity.

12

MR. WALL:

Absolutely.

And I think in many

13

fraud and concealment cases, where you are not talking

14

about a duty of disclosure, either common law or

15

statutorily, you do have affirmative misconduct.

16

it's a different question when Congress has come in and

17

told the defendants by law what they have to do.

18

the defendant then to breach that statutory duty -- I

19

think Congress has already told them what they have to

20

do in this context.

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But

For

But I think Mr. Landau's

22

point -- it was a strong part of his brief, I think --

23

was that there was no reason why his clients would have

24

thought that they had a disclosure obligation in the

25

first place.

So, it wasn't like they were looking at

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

29
1

this disclosure obligation and saying we don't feel like

2

it.

They were saying we're not covered by it.

3

MR. WALL:

That just goes to Justice

4

Ginsburg's point, I think, which is that where a

5

plaintiff can sufficiently plead a section 16(b) case at

6

the motion to dismiss stage to survive dismissal under

7

Iqbal and Twombly, everyone agrees that if you've got a

8

16(b) potential violation, you've got a reporting duty

9

under 16(a).

10

You can't have liability for a trade under

(b) that you weren't required to report under (a).

11

So, if the plaintiff can sufficiently plead

12

a case at the motion to dismiss stage under 16(b), by

13

definition the plaintiff has sufficiently pleaded that

14

the defendant violated a reporting obligation under (a).

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, no.

Why is that true?

16

Somebody could be a -- an insider without knowing that

17

the person was an insider.

18

MR. WALL:

That's right.

But section 16(a),

19

except for the criminal sanctions, is a strict liability

20

provision.

21

you've violated 16(a).

24

necessarily have a violation of (a).

JUSTICE ALITO:

whether there is the kind of concealment that would

invoke equitable tolling when the concealment is not

6

done knowingly, when it is not done in -- in knowing

7

breach of a disclosure obligation.

8
9

MR. WALL:

I think the -- the breach of a

duty, a statutory or a common law duty, especially where

that duty is designed to aid in the enforcement of a

private right of action, is and has been considered by

12

courts to be concealment.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY I. TILDEN

5

MR. TILDEN:

Justice Scalia, and may it

please the Court:
The underwriters' argument, and the

6

Government's for that matter, are founded on the notion

7

that Congress wanted someone who violated 16(a) to

8

receive the benefit of the statute of limitations or

9

repose in 16(b).

16(b) is unique in the securities law and

To answer that question, we must go to the

13

To know that, we must go to 16(a), which is a

If there's any one theme that runs through

14

looks to actual knowledge.

15

questioning brought out, there is no background rule

16

that distinguishes between actual knowledge and

17

constructive knowledge for purposes of equitable

18

tolling.

19

And I think, as some of the

Again, I think as some of the questions

20

brought out, equitable tolling, because it's an

21

equitable doctrine, looks to has the defendant behaved

22

equitably and has the plaintiff behaved equitably?

23

And we agree with the Government that

24

diligence -- in other words, would a reasonable

25

Alderson Reporting Company

2

critical part of the inquiry that's missing in -- in the

3

Ninth Circuit's analysis.

4

Where we disagree with the Government is

5

with respect to their -- their view of fraudulent

6

concealment to involve any violation -- any alleged

7

violation of a statutory 16(a) duty.

8

Government's view, it would be considered fraudulent

15

things to light, but the -- the defendant in that
