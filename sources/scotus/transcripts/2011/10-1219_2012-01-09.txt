ORAL ARGUMENT OF GINGER D. ANDERS

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MS. ANDERS:

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
Section 145 of the Patent Act permits a

10
11

person who has sought a patent from the PTO and believes

12

that the agency has wrongly denied his application to

13

seek judicial review of that decision in district court.

14

The Federal Circuit in this case held that the plaintiff

15

in a section 145 action may obtain a more favorable

16

standard of review, de novo review, by flouting the

17

PTO's rules during the examination process.

18

Under the court's approach, a plaintiff may

19

present to the court material new evidence that he

20

refused or failed without cause to present to the PTO.

21

And as his reward, he is given de novo review of the

22

PTO's expert determinations on all of the relevant

23

issues.

24
25

For three reasons, that unprecedented regime
should not be allowed to stand:

First, principles of

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

administrative deference and exhaustion require that the

2

PTO be given the opportunity to apply its expert

3

judgment to all of the reasonably available evidence.

4

For that reason, section 145 should be interpreted as a

5

safety valve proceeding that permits applicants to

6

introduce evidence to the court that they reasonably

7

could not have presented to the PTO.

8
9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Can you only get a 145

proceeding when you have new evidence?

MS. ANDERS:

No.

25

evidence in that case, and the Court held that this was

That was an action
There was no new

1

a proceeding in the nature of a suit to set aside a

judgment, the judgment of the expert agency which had

3

made this determination, and that, therefore, because

4

this was administrative review, a deferential standard

5

of review should apply.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MS. ANDERS:

8

So, it's quite clear that

when --

10

Yes.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

How close a predecessor is

MS. ANDERS:

All of the material language is

13

difference for purposes of this case.

14

There's -- there's no material

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But the Morgan case

15

involved -- it wasn't a contest between the PTO and the

16

would-be patent holder; it was an interference

17

proceeding, wasn't it?

18

MS. ANDERS:

That's correct, Justice

19

Ginsburg.

It was an interference proceeding, and that's

20

because, at the time, section 145's predecessor applied

21

equally to interferences and to ex parte patent denials.

22

But the Court's reasoning, its discussion of -- of the

23

predecessor statute, did not distinguish based on the

24

fact that this was an interference.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I thought that -- it's

2

interesting that the language of Morgan and one of its

3

companion cases, not companion in the sense of being

4

heard at the same time, but on the same issue -- Radio

5

City case -- both of them don't talk in the language of

6

today.

7

talk about substantial evidence.

8

whether the PTO has expertise, and presumptions that

9

their factfindings based on their expertise have to be

10

They don't talk about deference.

They don't

They talk about

overcome with some convincing evidence.

11

So, they're talking in different language,

12

but the concept they're talking about is one where the

13

court does accept findings of the PTO on the matters

14

that involve their expertise and give them weight,

15

substantial weight, essentially, and only overturn it if

16

the court is, in the words of Morgan and Radio City,

17

"thoroughly convinced" that they were wrong.

18

So, what's wrong with that standard?

19

Everybody likes the deference language of today, but

20

they were very clear in what they were saying:

21

PTO made a finding, you decide whether that finding was

22

based on its expertise, and if it was, you don't change

23

it, court, unless you're thoroughly convinced they were

24

wrong.

25

Is there anything wrong with that?
6
Alderson Reporting Company

If the

With

Official

1

that articulation of what the standard should be in all

2

situations, whether there's new evidence or no new

3

evidence?

4

MS. ANDERS:

Well, I think here we are

5

suggesting that in -- in 145 actions, when there is new

6

evidence, the -- Morgan's "thorough conviction" standard

7

should apply.

8

needs to look at the new evidence, but because the PTO

9

has made an expert determination, as the Court said in

And that reflects the fact that the court

10

Morgan, that determination should not be overturned

11

unless there's a high degree of certainty.

12

And I would note that that is essentially

13

what this Court did just last term in Microsoft v. i4i.

14

There the Court said that when a third party is

15

challenging the validity of a granted patent, that the

16

third party should have to show invalidity based on a

17

heightened burden of proof, clear and convincing

18

evidence.

19

that underlies --

And that reflects the same wisdom that --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

20

All right.

Let me tell

21

you what my problem is with this case.

It is the issue

22

that Verizon raised and the lack of connection between

23

the district court's holding and the circuit court's

24

holding.

25

the proposed arguments on the basis of them being new

The district court excluded the affidavit for

says:

what's new evidence in this affidavit and what's new

6

argument.

7

The circuit court described the
And the Verizon amicus brief

Court, be careful, because it's not really clear

And that question troubles me, for the

8

following reason:

Verizon posits that the issue of

9

whether a description is specific enough is a legal

10

question to which the PTO is not entitled to deference.

11

Why, other than Federal Circuit and Patent Board

12

precedent, is that right?

13

affidavit that was rejected is in fact new evidence and

14

not merely new argument?

And can you explain why this

15

MS. ANDERS:

Certainly, Justice Sotomayor.

16

I think the district court did characterize

17

this as new evidence, and the reason it did that was

18

because Mr. Hyatt made a concerted strategic decision

19

here to present his affidavit as new evidence.

20

this is -- this is factual evidence.

21

declaration containing proffered testimony that Mr.

22

Hyatt would offer if there were a trial.

23

form factual evidence, and in order to take advantage of

24

the possibility of introducing new evidence in the

25

section 145 action, Mr. Hyatt argued that this was

This is a

So, it is in

1

new factual evidence that should --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could you tell me what

3

-- other than that it's in the form of an affidavit,

4

tell me what in the content was new evidence?

5

get away from the labels, and I want to get to the

6

substance because I've looked at all of these

7

submissions, and it sounds like what I read in briefs

8

every day.

9

MS. ANDERS:

Certainly.

I want to

I think whether or

10

not the -- the ultimate question of whether the written

11

description is sufficient is a question of law.

12

would be one that rests on several subsidiary

13

factfindings, including what the ordinary skill in the

14

art is, what a person of ordinary skill in the art would

15

understand when he reads the specification, and where in

16

the specification there is support, there is description

17

support, for the claims that shows that Mr. Hyatt

18

possessed the invention that he claimed.

19

It

And so, I think when you look at what

20

happened at the PTO, the examiner said:

Despite my

21

expertise, I can't tell where in the specification your

22

claims are supported.

23

specification reprinted in the joint appendix.

24

over 100 pages of diagrams, source code, and 117 claims.

25

And so, the PTO asked for this information; Mr. Hyatt

This is at 258 -- it's a 250-page

9
Alderson Reporting Company

It has

Official

1

refused to present it or he didn't present it, and then,

2

on rehearing, the Board said that he had not had any

3

cause not to present this new -- this new argument.

4

so, at that point, Mr. Hyatt went into the 145

5

proceeding, and he was -- he characterized this as

6

factual evidence in order to get around, presumably, or

7

it would be reasonable to try to get around, the Board's

8

ruling that he couldn't present new evidence.

9

And

Now, you certainly could characterize this

10

as legal argument.

We believe that we would win on that

11

ground as well, even if this were new argument, because

12

certainly the PTO is entitled to enforce its rules here,

13

and both the district court and the panel found that the

14

PTO did not abuse its discretion in -- in holding that

15

Mr. Hyatt had forfeited his right to raise this

16

argument.

17

question presented that we -- that we added here because

18

it's a very case-specific question.

19

But that's not -- that's not an additional

But at any rate, the -- the entire case has

20

now been litigated on the basis of this being factual

21

evidence --

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

23

isn't new facts, right?

24

MS. ANDERS:

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Your case is stronger if it

That's what you'd say.
I'm sorry?
Your case is stronger if in

1

fact it's only new argument and not new fact.

2

MS. ANDERS:

Certainly.

I think it should

3

be very clear that we would win on that ground.

4

banc court here characterized this as new factual

5

evidence and applied a rule that will -- will govern, if

6

it's left to stand, in all 145 actions, which would

7

permit applicants to withhold evidence from the PTO.

8
9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The en

Ms. Anders, one of the

problems with, I think, your position, is it sounds very

10

strange to have two proceedings, one where you go

11

directly to the Federal Circuit under 101 -- 141; and

12

then this other one where you go to the district court,

13

where if that's not, as Judge Newman said, a whole new

14

-- whole new game, then why would Congress create two

15

judicial review routes, one in the district court

16

reviewable in the Federal Circuit, the other directly in

17

the Federal Circuit, if there's no difference?

18

if in both of them, it's not de novo review; it is

19

reviewing what the -- what the agency did under the

20

ordinary standard for reviewing agency action.

21
22
23

That is,

What's different about the -- the 145
proceeding?
MS. ANDERS:

Well, in the 145 proceeding,

24

the applicant has the ability to introduce new evidence

25

that couldn't be presented to the PTO.
11
Alderson Reporting Company

And I think --

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But what kind of evidence is

that, Ms. Anders?

3

MS. ANDERS:

Well, I think there are two

4

primary categories, both of which can be very important

5

in the examination proceedings.

6

testimony.

7

is routine in the examination procedures for --

8
9

The first is oral

The PTO doesn't hear oral testimony, but it

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So, in the 145, an applicant

can take all his written affidavits and say:

I want to

10

present oral testimony, on these exact matters, but

11

live.

12

MS. ANDERS:

He could -- he could certainly

13

bring that to the district court, yes.

14

district court always, under general evidentiary rules,

15

can say:

16

not going to hear it.

17

Now, the

I believe this evidence is cumulative; so, I'm

But to the extent that the district court

18

believes it would be helpful to hear oral testimony, for

19

instance, if the PTO's determinations involve

20

credibility decisions, then certainly the district court

21

could hear that testimony, and that's often how these

22

proceedings have been used.

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But to the extent the

24

substance of that testimony was something that he could

25

have brought to the PTO, that testimony, in your view,
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

would be out of bounds.

2

MS. ANDERS:

There would have to be a

reasonable justification for not having presented it --

Alderson Reporting Company

1

MS. ANDERS:

Well, the standard we're

2

proposing is that the district court has discretion to

3

determine whether there was reasonable cause not to

4

present the evidence to the PTO.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

And if it says there isn't,

6

then it can't hear it?

I mean, imagine you're sitting

7

there as a district judge, you think:

8

should have presented it, but this is the key matter

9

forever.

Oh, my God, they

Do I really pay no attention to it at all?
MS. ANDERS:

10

Well, I think it's no different

11

from exhaustion or forfeiture rules in any other

12

context --

13
14

JUSTICE BREYER:

Except you have a history

here.

15

MS. ANDERS:

The Board applicant has the --

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

You have the history of the

17

pre-APA section 145 where they apparently did take the

18

evidence in.

19

MS. ANDERS:

Well, certainly in the early

20

cases, they took new evidence in.

But by 1952, which is

21

when Congress re-enacted this provision, you have the

22

lower courts applying the Morgan standard and saying:

23

Based on Morgan's reasoning, because we know that the

24

PTO is the primary factfinder, because we know their

25

decision is so important, we will apply limitations on
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

new evidence because we don't think that that

2

evidence --

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But then you really do go

4

back to Justice Ginsburg's question because your

5

understanding of what they wouldn't have a reasonable

6

opportunity to present -- I mean, it's very, very

7

narrow.

8

nobody would want to present and no judge would want to

9

hear.

It's a bunch of cumulative testimony that

And other than that, you're basically saying in

10

all circumstances, well, they could have done that in

11

the PTO.

12

which is these are two channels that are exactly the

13

same.

14

So, then you have Justice Ginsburg's problem,

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And you were beginning to

15

answer that by saying, well, you can't have oral

16

testimony before the PTO.

17

what would be -- what's different about 141 and 145 on

18

your view.

19

What else?

20

But what else?

I asked you

And you said one thing is oral testimony.

MS. ANDERS:

Well, the other primary

21

category of evidence that could come in would be

22

evidence that has a temporal component.

23

lot of evidence that could be relevant to patentability

24

that develops only slowly or that might arise very late

25

in the process.

If there's a

So, for instance, obviousness is a -15

2

that can be relevant to obviousness is if the invention,

3

once disclosed, has commercial success.

4

of sales evidence can -- can develop very late in --

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But one thing

So, this type

But I thought that your

6

brief suggested that even with respect to that kind of

7

evidence, a person can go back to the PTO.

8

right?

9

MS. ANDERS:

Is that

For the most part, the record

10

closes once the -- once the applicant files his brief on

11

appeal to the Board.

12

before the Board issues its decision.

13

And then it can be months or years

Now, there are -- there are a couple of

14

avenues through which an applicant could still introduce

15

new evidence even when the Board is considering the

16

appeal.

17

that's the request for continuing examination and the

18

continuation application.

19

down sides that require the applicant to abandon his

20

appeal or give up some of his patent -- the patent term

21

that he would presumably get.

22

But both of those, as the process goes --

Both of those have increasing

So --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What if -- what if

23

the new evidence is in reaction to the PTO's ruling?

Alderson Reporting Company

1

know, the valve in the back of the thing or whatever

2

was -- was novel, and we think that's important.

3

and the applicant goes to, under 145, to the district

4

court and said:

5

because I didn't have any idea that that was going to be

6

a significant issue, and I'm -- you know, I'm sorry,

7

but, you know, I have a good basis for not thinking of

8

that, and here it is.

9
10

So --

Well, I didn't submit that evidence

Is that the type of new evidence that could
be admitted?

11

MS. ANDERS:

Well, in the first instance,

12

the PTO's procedures actually provide -- they actually

13

provide for this situation, and that's when the Board or

14

the examiner enters a new ground of rejection.

15

that point, the applicant has the right to reopen

16

prosecution that -- introduce new evidence --

it's concerned with streamlining the proceeding and

13

having more efficiency in -- in patent appeals.

14

So, Congress separated this in

So, it would be reasonable to conclude that

15

there would be some number of applicants who -- probably

16

the majority of applicants, who wouldn't have new

evidence, who could go to 141 and simply get a final

18

decision from a court after one court proceeding in the

Number one, am I reading or am I summarizing

isn't that a sensible way to interpret the statute so,

as Justice Ginsburg is suggesting, you give some meaning

to 145?

18

not.

19

And, number two, why

It's -- it performs a function that 141 does

MS. ANDERS:

Well, I think you're correct,

20

Justice Kennedy, that -- that the en banc court believed

21

that administrative deference principles didn't weigh

22

against its conclusions because the district court could

23

give more weight to the new evidence.

Morgan has

very little to say about what types of evidence ought to

3

do is to separate out these two things and say, you

know, we think that there's a basis for one, for, let's

5

say, giving the government a fairly deferential standard

6

of review -- call it clear and convincing, call it

against you, on the evidentiary point, which Morgan says

9

nothing about.
MS. ANDERS:

10

And one thing we could

Well, I think Morgan did not

11

directly address this -- the admissibility of new

12

evidence, but by saying that the PTO is the primary

13

decisionmaker and that the court should not lightly set

14

aside what the PTO does, it invoked administrative

15

deference principles, which in turn show why all of the

16

reasonably available evidence needs to be presented to

17

the agency.

18

And -- I do think that it -- it wouldn't

make sense to have a de novo standard of review for

patent denials any time new evidence comes in, largely

21

based on this Court's decision in Microsoft.

I think that's what Judge Newman

22

MS. ANDERS:

Well, I think that the

presumption of validity and the need to give deference

to the PTO's determinations are essentially two ways

25

of -- of saying the same thing.

The first is -- and I know that it may

11

the legislative history is replete with the commissioner

for Congress to change it, and it didn't, arguing that

15

are plenty of courts, including the Second Circuit, and

21

So, how do you deal with a record that

MS. ANDERS:

I think the record does support

our argument, Justice Sotomayor, because what you see in

the early 20th century after Morgan had construed this

6

as administrative review -- you referred to the 1927

hearings.

8

phrase "de novo" in a very loose way that probably was a

9

result of its dating before the APA.

said that the thorough conviction standard should apply

administrative.

17

much weight on the use of the term "de novo."

18

And that's the same thing you

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

The language of section 145, the structure

of the judicial review provisions in the Patent Act, the

11

long history of the provision, and this Court's

12

constructions of its predecessors all make clear that

the Government's argument that a plaintiff is barred

from introducing new evidence in an action under section

15

145, except in the unusual if not extraordinary

circumstance where the applicant had no opportunity to

17

introduce the substance of that evidence, is incorrect.

Section 145 does not follow the modern norm

19

of on-the-record review.

sections 141 to 144.

MR. PANNER:

Well, Your Honor, to be clear

19

about what is permitted under section 145, it is correct

that new evidence can be permitted to go to issues that

21

have been properly ruled on by the PTO in the course of

22

ruling on the ex parte application.

23

The reason that appeals to the -- to the

MR. PANNER:

Well, Your Honor, if you had

11

evidence that you wanted to present, and the remedies at

12

the PTO were inadequate for one reason or another.

13

in thinking about the practical implications of the

14

procedural option that section 145 affords, it's

15

important to recognize that this procedure has been in

16

place for generations, and it has been understood by the

17

patent bar as reflected in decisions of the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

that people don't often use 145, right?

MR. PANNER:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, Ms. --

13

Ms. Anders told us that there's a procedure before the

PTO that lets you deal with these -- that sort of

15

something came up that you didn't think about, and you

16

can address that.

MR. PANNER:

Your Honor, what -- what

Ms. Anders was referring to, I believe, is the

possibility to reopen where there are new grounds for a

rejection.

to what element was missing, why the -- why the feature

was not supported in the specification.

tried to respond, and the Board refused to -- to accept

it.

where there's ambiguity -- I mean, you're going to win

if there's no ambiguity.

that time, every agency went its own way, and you had

dozens of specialized methods of review.

try to create uniformity across agencies in a vast

But if there's ambiguity, I

And now, what was obviously worrying me in

22

the first case and this case, too --

23

MR. PANNER:

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

away at that, and that will be very hard for lawyers and

for ordinary people to understand if we suddenly go back

admissibility of the evidence -- on standard of review,

facts under (2)(F).

trial de novo even if you introduce some new evidence.

20

MR. PANNER:

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, I think that -It is a -- it is an old

22

trial with some new evidence, and there will be a

23

thousand different variations on that theme.

24
25

MR. PANNER:

I

I think that goes to Justice

Sotomayor's point really, which is that there is a trial
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

de novo, and clearly at a minimum what the courts are

2

talking about when they refer to this, not 5 times, not

3

10 times, but dozens of times, this Court several times,

4

lower courts pervasively, when they are talking about a

5

de novo proceeding, they're talking about the fact that

the agency.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

part -- I get that.

11

MR. PANNER:

Okay.

And then the question

12

becomes, what is the appropriate standard of review when

13

there is new evidence going to this question?

14

answer here goes I think to -- section (2)(F) says that

shifting.

And as a practical matter, as the Federal Circuit

4

indicated, the district judge will weigh the evidence

before it, including the new evidence and the findings

by the agency, in making its determination as to whether

7

the applicant has carried -- carried his burden to show

that he's entitled to the patent.

9

So, at a minimum, there has been a

And the applicant would then bear the burden.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If the judge does that,

10

what -- how does he articulate the weight that he gives

11

to what the PTO find?

12

this?

13

discussed -- page 9 of your brief, you summarized what

14

This was all

Yes, Your Honor.
And in that connection, on

17

this same line, do you -- do you agree with that

18

summary?

19

MR. PANNER:

I do, Your Honor.

That is to

20

say that what the Federal circuit recognized is that in

21

determining the weight to give to new evidence and

22

determining what weight to give to the determined --

23

prior determination of the agency, it's appropriate for

24

the district court to look at the circumstances of the

25

new evidence.

And one of the things that's -- this is
33

And, of

the Board decide, what was the basis for that, how

11

strongly supported is it, versus how -- how -- to what

12

extent is this new evidence something that really

13

requires me to look at this anew.

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, in line with

15

Justice Breyer's question, can you give us an example of

16

some other agency review proceeding that is somewhat

17

like this, or is this just unique?

18

MR. PANNER:

I don't think it's entirely

19

unique at all, Your Honor.

That is to say, for example,

20

in proceedings where there's orders to pay money by the

21

FCC, the findings of the agency are given prima facie

22

weight in an action -- in an enforcement action.

23

so, new evidence is permitted, and the district judge

24

would make a determination based on the record and the

25

new evidence.

And

But the party or the agency seeking to
34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

enforce the prior order would be able to rely on those

2

factual findings to -- as prima facie evidence where, if

3

there was no contrary evidence, it would actually

4

establish those facts.

5

There are other administrative review

6

schemes that do afford trial de novo in which the -- you

7

know, there may be more or less deference to whatever

8

the agency did depending on -- on what the record may

9

reflect about the considered judgment of the agency.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Are there limits on the

11

new evidence that can be produced?

12

limits, in your view?

13

MR. PANNER:

Are there any

Well, Your Honor, I think that

14

the principle of estoppel that was recognized in Barrett

15

is not one that we're -- we're challenging.

16

say, in a circumstance in which an applicant -- and, of

17

course, that was an interference proceeding, and it's

18

perhaps easier to foresee this happening in an

19

interference context, but in that case, the plaintiff

20

had actually suppressed, had directed witnesses not to

21

answer questions that went into a particular factual

22

area and then, when -- after appeal and when the

23

district court action was brought, attempted to

24

introduce the very evidence that he had -- that the

25

applicant had deliberately suppressed.
35
Alderson Reporting Company

That is to

And the district

Official

1

court said, look, that -- that is -- gives rise to an

2

estoppel, which seems to me a generally applicable

3

principle that --

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

Well, if you're

5

willing to accept that, then what about broadening that

6

to prevent people from running around the PTO, and

7

simply saying unless the -- unless the person, the

8

potential patentee, unless he wants to -- unless he has

9

shown he can show that he's innocent, that is to say it

10

wasn't deliberate, it wasn't negligent, it wasn't a part

11

of a trial -- of a strategy, unless he shows he was

12

totally without sin in some form of words in not

13

introducing the evidence the first time, he can't

14

introduce it now?

15

MR. PANNER:

I think the difficulty with

16

that, Your Honor, is not only is it inconsistent with

17

the practice of the courts, which have always recognized

18

that, but it also ignores the fact that there needs to

19

be decisions that an applicant makes about what evidence

20

to present to the PTO.

21

not presenting evidence in the PTO that becomes quite

22

relevant once --

23

And there may be good cause for

7

That's why principles of estoppel, which are

MR. PANNER:

And I think that looking at the

14

the furthest that any court went was the decision in

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

3

MR. PANNER:

Yes, I agree.

-- was from Barrett, and that

4

was a case that involved, again, directing a witness not

5

to answer, the suppression of inquiry into a particular

6

factual area where the applicant then -- changing his

7

story and claiming a different date for reduction of

8

practice and a different basis for reduction to practice

9

than had been argued before the PTO -- attempted to

10
11

introduce the evidence that he had suppressed.
So, that's a very different circumstance.

12

And the courts -- the decisions are actually at pains to

13

say that Barrett should not be over-read.

14

Circuit in the Carborundum case said that; the Nichols

15

case, which we've we cited in our brief, said that; and

16

of course, as you pointed out, Judge Hand observed that

17

in the -- in the Dowling case.

18

So, even the cases that the Government itself relied on

19

were -- accepted evidence, despite the arguments that

20

were made by the defendants in those cases that this was

21

evidence that should have been excluded because it could

22

have been presented, and -- and did consider it.

23

The Third

Globe-Union said that.

And that brings us, I think -- there has

24

been a lot of discussion about Morgan and the standard

25

of review and what Morgan has to say about that.
39
Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official

1

the critical point that this Court recognized in

2

Microsoft was that Morgan is one of the early cases and

3

then -- and Radio Corporation is another that depend on

4

an idea of the presumption of validity, which of course

5

was then adopted by Congress in section 282 as a

6

statutory presumption, that was given that common law

7

meaning that required clear and convincing evidence.

8

But the clear and convincing evidence is to overcome the

9

grant of a property right to the defendant in those

10

cases.

11

What's critical in Morgan is the fact that

12

the -- the Patent Office had granted a patent to the

13

defendant, and it was a challenge to the validity of

14

that patent that the plaintiff's case relied on.

15

it's -- and that's absolutely clear because the Court

16

cites to Johnson v. Towsley, which is a case involving a

17

land grant.

18

is that when the executive has the power to give

19

property rights, we don't get to review it.

And

And what the Court says is our presumption

Now, in this case, we see a limited

20
21

exception because there's a statute that actually tells

22

us we have to do it, but that exception is going to be

23

limited.

24

Morgan is not relying on agency expertise; it's relying

25

on agency authority, which is a different matter.

But if you look at what Morgan relies on,

40
Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official

1

so -- and the authority that the agency had to grant a

2

property right.

3

the court of 1893 and the administrative law that

4

existed in 1893, the fact that there was no property

5

right being challenged in an action where there was an

6

effort to overcome a rejection means that this idea

7

about the presumption of the validity of the rights that

8

had been granted by an executive department doesn't come

9

into play.

In the -- in the conception of a -- of

There had been no rights granted by the

10

executive department, and there's a new proceeding in

12

had "the whole case."

the language that Congress chose.

14

And that's really reflected in

Now, of course, that -- the differences

questions.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

5

MR. PANNER:

As section -- as I say, the

6

language of Morgan deals with the circumstance in which

7

there's a challenge to the validity of an issued patent.

8

The action that was at issue, the action as to which the

9

validity was being challenged, was not the denial of the

10

patent to the applicant; it was the fact that the PTO

11

had issued a patent to the defendant in that case.

12

so, there was a collateral attack, effectively a

13

collateral challenge to the validity of that issued

14

patent.

cites Morgan, and that's how, you know, it's relevant to

20

That's what usually

One of the things that I think is important

21

to take into account with respect to the context of this

22

case is there were a vast number of rejections.

23

24

enablement grounds, but there were rejections for double

25

patentings; there were rejections for anticipation;

there were rejections for obviousness.

And every single

2

one -- every single one -- of those grounds for

rejection was overcome in the appeal before the Board.

And many of the written-description rejections were

5

overcome in the appeal before the Board.
