ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY FISHER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10

MR. FISHER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

Unlike the previous case, this case does not

12

involve the need to formulate Federal common law or to

13

survey customary international law.

14

expressly created the cause of action at issue in a

15

statute.

16

tort statute that Congress has ever enacted, it has

17

provided for organizational liability.

18

Justice Kennedy, I think you put it earlier, it's a

19

simple concept in our country.

And we know that in every single other Federal

Honor.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

2

(Laughter.)

3

MR. FISHER:

Thank you.

Well, then go ahead.

But, of course, the

4

question arises in this case why did Congress use the

5

word "individual"?

6

the Tel-Oren case, which is the case, of course, from

7

the D.C. Circuit that gave rise to the TVPA.

8

that case, Judge Edwards wrote a lengthy concurrence

9

where he again and again used the word "individual

And we think the answer comes from

And in

10

liability" and "individual" to describe the PLO, which

11

was the very defendant in that case, against the

12

backdrop of international law, which uses the term

13

"individual" to differentiate anyone from the state.

14

After Nuremberg, starting with the

15

discussions were recited most prominently in our reply

16

brief at pages 6 to 8, Professor Jessup and many others

17

discussed whether international law applies simply

18

against states or whether it applies to, quote,

19

"individuals."

20

and again to mean anyone but the state.

21

Professor Jessup and many others said, it includes

22

organizations and juridical persons.

23

And the word "individual" was used again
And as

And this is the usage that Judge Edwards

24

used in his opinion in Tel-Oren.

He uses the word

25

"individual" 43 times in that opinion.

Alderson Reporting Company

And if you look

Official

5
1

at nothing else --

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought Justice --

3

Judge Edwards' opinion was about politically motivated

4

terrorists not coming within the Alien Tort Statute.

5

MR. FISHER:

No.

What Judge Edwards

6

concluded, Justice Ginsburg, was that, as he understood

7

the Alien Tort Statute at the time against the backdrop

8

of international law, that any private actor acting

9

under color of law could be held liable.

And what Judge

10

Edwards decided in that particular case is that the PLO

11

as it then existed was not a state actor.

12

that Judge Edwards prescribed -- and this is at page

13

793, I believe, of his concurrence -- was that

14

individuals acting under color of law should be held

15

liable.

But the rule

That's the precise language that the TVPA uses.

16

So, if you want to know where Congress got

17

the word "individual" and what it probably thought it

18

meant, the best place to look is Judge Edwards' opinion.

19

Now, what --

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why isnâ€™t the place --

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Really?

6

and again in the hearings.

7

It's cited throughout the legislative

And this Court -- I think in Skilling, a

8

couple terms ago, this Court said we have a statute

9

before us dealing with honest services.

And what did

10

Congress mean when it used particular language?

11

it probably meant what lower court judges had used that

12

language to mean, that it was --

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That is a strange phrase,

14

"honest services," as -- you know, as a crime,

15

deprivation of honest services.

16

"individual" is not a strange --

17

MR. FISHER:

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

19

Well,

But the word

Well, it's a strange --- word at all.

It's used

all the time.

20

MR. FISHER:

No, Justice Scalia --

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

22

MR. FISHER:

It means an individual.

I think it's a strange -- it's

23

a very strange phrase in the context of a tort statute

24

because we know that Congress always provides for

25

organizational liability, and it has never used, to our

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

7
1

knowledge, the word "individual" in a tort statute.

2

it is odd that it appears here.

3
4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So,

Is that -- is that better

for you or worse for you?

5

MR. FISHER:

Well, I think it's better for

6

us in that it shows that Congress -- something is amiss.

7

And I think Judge Edwards' opinion explains what is

8

going on.

9

Now, what my opponents want this Court to do

10

is to look at other places in the U.S. Code where the

11

word "individual" is used outside of international law,

12

outside of tort regimes.

And we concede --

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

14

MR. FISHER:

15
16

The problem --

-- often the word

"individual" -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The problem is I don't

17

even look there.

I look to the TVPA, section 2(a)(2),

18

which uses the word "person."

19

writing the statute Congress forgot the word "person."

20

MR. FISHER:

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So, it wasn't as if in

No, it didn't.
They appear to be

22

using "person" in the organizational way that "person"

23

is defined in the Dictionary Act and elsewhere.

24

isn't that a textual clue that they were using the word

25

"individual" in a different sense?

Alderson Reporting Company

So,

Official

8
1

MR. FISHER:

No, Justice Sotomayor, for two

2

reasons:

One is because, for reasons I'll explain, the

3

word "person" as it appears in the TVPA actually only

4

applies to natural persons.

5

that.

6

word --

Well, let me start with

The argument the other side has is that the

I'm not quite sure.

10

Legal representative is often -- can be a person but can

11

often also be a -- a corporate entity.

12

MR. FISHER:

Well, I think the -- I think

13

the argument is that the word "person" somehow contrasts

14

with "individual."

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

16

MR. FISHER:

Yes.

And, as we've shown in our

17

brief, only natural people can bring wrongful death

18

actions.

19

argued that an estate could.

20

brief and this Court has squarely held, only natural

21

people acting as administrator or executor of a -- of an

22

estate can bring an action.

They -- they claim -- in the D.C. Circuit

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

24

MR. FISHER:

25

As we've shown in our

Mr. Fisher --

So, the word "person" refers to

natural person.

1

JUSTICE KAGAN:

You know, it's obvious that

2

"individual" doesn't usually mean what you want it to

3

mean.

4

Judge Edwards, and they came in and used "individual."

5

But it seems actually that we know where "individual"

6

came from in this statute.

7

saying "person," and then there was this moment where

8

one Congressman said I don't want this to apply to

9

corporations, and the staff member said I have a great

Now, you have a theory that they all just read

The statute started out by

10

idea to make sure it doesn't apply to corporations;

11

let's change the word "person" to "individual."

12

that's the way "individual" got into the statute, and it

13

got in specifically to address this question.

14

MR. FISHER:

So,

We don't disagree with that's

15

how the word gets into the statute, but the question, as

16

this Court has always looked to legislative history, is

17

what does that -- what light does that shed on

18

Congress's understanding of the law it ultimately

19

passed?

20

Congress passed the statute with the word "individual."

21

And the problem with that --

22

So, two Congresses later, 4 years later,

23
24
25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And "individual" means what

it means.
MR. FISHER:

And the problem with that

theory, Justice Kagan, is it squarely is contradicted by

Alderson Reporting Company

10
1

the committee reports contemporaneous with the statute

2

that say we're using the word "individual" to make

3

crystal clear that foreign states and their entities

4

cannot be sued.

5

And that's the reason --

JUSTICE BREYER:

So, what else should I look

6

at?

7

know I have to go through legislative history.

8

said it's meaningful, and so I do it.

11

Because I've looked at the -- I did really -- I
I've

JUSTICE BREYER:

And, so far -- so far, I

think I have to say that you're on a weak wicket.

12

(Laughter.)

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

The -- the word "persons"

14

-- when was there -- I found lots and lots of instances

15

and by people in the civil -- international civil rights

16

community who are testifying, where I look at what they

17

say, and over and over they say a limited statute, the

18

person won't often be in the United States.

20

won't be in the United States very often.

21

sometimes he may come over here; it's important to take

a -- make a symbolic step.

when they're talking even about the word "person," that

24

suggested they meant even the PLO at that time.

Well, the

2

MR. FISHER:

Yes.

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

I mean, that's the tenor of

4

what I seem to have found so far.

5

because you will point out to me the things that I have

6

accidentally skipped.

7

(Laughter.)

8

MR. FISHER:

9

So, I mention that

Yes, pages 46 through 49 of our

blue brief, Justice Breyer.

There are numerous

10

references to the word "organization," "group."

11

a word used.

12

"It" is

And, I think, Justice Kagan, this is also

13

responsive to your question.

14

you described was made, there was a hearing held before

15

the Senate Judiciary Committee where both bills were

being considered.

17

the word "individual" and the word -- and the Senate

18

bill which used the word "person."

19

Two years after the change

And one would expect that if people thought

20

the word "individual" meant something different and

21

limited the class of defendants, that that would have

22

come up or somebody would have expressed some awareness

23

of it.

24
25

But to the contrary -JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, suppose I'm a member

against a statute.

5

whatever sayings by members of the committee or by

6

experts testifying before the committee occurred?

7

was out of my hearing.

And I -- I see the word "individual" in this

Why should I be saddled with

It

I voted for "individual."

8

And "individual" -- well -- if Congress

9

wanted "individual" to mean what you say it doesn't

10

mean, what word would they have used instead?

11

if "individual" is a code word for person, what's the

12

code word for individual?

13

(Laughter.)

14

MR. FISHER:

I mean,

Natural person, Justice Scalia.

15

And -- and we've cited many statutes in our blue brief

16

that use the word "natural person" in the U.S. Code.

17

And this goes to the question -- I think

18

this is also responsive to Justice Sotomayor:

19

they use the word "individual," instead of "person"?

20

Why did they say in the committee reports that the word

21

"individual" made it crystal clear that states and their

22

entities could not be sued?

23

Why did

And the reason why is because "person" would

24

have left some residual ambiguity as to whether

25

something like a foreign city or a foreign county --

Alderson Reporting Company

think of a foreign county jail that tortured somebody.

Under section 1983 law, which uses the word "person,"

3

counties and cities are liable.

international law sovereign immunities principles,

they're not.

However, under the

The word "individual" --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

They chose that word

to avoid any residual ambiguity.

was no ambiguity at all as to whether the term

13

"individual" meant natural persons or organizational

14

entities?

15

MR. FISHER:

But they thought there

submit they didn't think about that question, which is

17

why I'm standing here today.

concerned with was avoiding sweeping in foreign states

19

and their -- and their -- and their entities.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

21

MR. FISHER:

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What they were really

But there were --

And they just didn't think.
There were witnesses who

23

testified, were there not, Mr. Fisher, that the TVPA

24

would take care of a Filartiga type case, that when the

25

torturer shows up physically -- those were the words

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

14
1

that were used -- the torturer comes into the state,

2

into the United States, is physically present in the

3

United States.

4

witnesses had in mind, and some of them were quite

5

distinguished witnesses.

6

That was the model that at least those

MR. FISHER:

There are statements to that

7

effect.

And, of course, the TVPA does cover natural

8

persons if they happen to be in the United States.

9

the comment that Justice Kagan pointed out is the only

10

comment that the other side can find anywhere in the

11

legislative history.

But

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But let's suppose that is

13

true, Mr. Fisher.

14

Congressman Leach, nobody thought about this question.

15

But we know what the normal meaning of "individual" is,

16

and you're suggesting -- let's suppose that they just --

17

the -- the question of individual versus corporate

18

liability was not on their mind, but they chose a word

19

that means something.

20

should resort to background norms that -- you know, what

21

Congress generally does when it imposes liability,

22

rather than the words in the statute that they passed.

23

And why should we do that?

24
25

Let's suppose that aside from

And you're suggesting that we

MR. FISHER:

Well, if the word "individual"

could only mean natural person, I agree.

Alderson Reporting Company

The case would

Official

15
1

be over.

But we've cited many dictionary definitions,

2

many usages in the U.S. Code, and many holdings from

3

this Court and others that have actually found that a

4

secondary meaning of the term is singularity.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

the "individual" to include organizations.

9

MR. FISHER:

But you found no tort --

A single unit or entity.
-- no tort statute uses

Right.

No tort statute uses it

10

one way or the other, Justice Ginsburg, which we think,

11

if anything, gets you back to the background norms and

12

the secondary meaning.

13

about --

14

And let me say two things

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But you have the --

15

you have the additional problem, though, that your

16

reading gives a different meaning to "individual" in two

17

sentences that are right -- actually it's in the same

18

sentence:

19

subjects an "individual" to torture.

an "individual" who does the torturing,

20

Now, I understand your argument that you can

21

Have an organization doing the -- the subject thing, but

22

how do you subject an organization to torture?

23

MR. FISHER:

You don't.

24

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

25

MR. FISHER:

And I --

Alderson Reporting Company

You don't.

Official

16
1

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So, "individual" in

2

the one clause you say means "organization";

3

"individual" in the other necessarily does not.

4

MR. FISHER:

I don't think it's that they

5

have different meanings, but you're certainly correct

6

that they refer to different things.

7

different than numerous other statutes we cite at page

8

28 and 29 of our brief that use the word "person" to

9

mean a plaintiff when it can be just -- be a natural

But that's no

10

person and a defendant when it can be an entity.

11

indeed, I think, if I don't get ahead of my --

12
13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And,

In the same sentence?

In the same sentence?

14

MR. FISHER:

Yes.

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

16

MR. FISHER:

Yes.

Yes.
Those statutes you -Go to page 28 and 29 of

17

the blue brief.

18

and, Justice Kagan, this goes back to your point.

19

whole argument is when the word "person" was used

20

throughout the statute, then it -- then it changed

21

meanings in the same way, that it covered organizational

22

entities, but -- so, if the word "person" can do the

23

same work, the word "individual" can certainly do the

24

same work.

25

And, indeed, their whole argument --

So, the question is why -- I think the

Alderson Reporting Company

Their

Official

17
1

question that you end up with is, given that

2

"individual" does have this secondary meaning, does have

3

this customary usage that Congress may well have been

4

aware of, at least that as this Court often says that if

5

there's a customary usage of a term, we'll assume

6

Congress was aware of it, why would Congress have done

7

what it did and limit this act, unlike any other Federal

8

tort statute in the U.S. Code, to natural persons?

9

we submit there is no good reason.

10

And

Justice Ginsburg, you talked about

11

statements in legislative history to the effect that

12

individual people who are torturers may be found in the

13

United States, and that's true.

14

statute.

15

laws and criminal laws that refuse safe haven to such

16

people.

17

But the TVPA is a tort

Congress already had on the books immigration

The only purpose of the TVPA is to provide

18

compensation.

And in every tort regime of which we are

19

aware in Federal law -- and they haven't even pointed to

20

anything to the contrary in State law or in

21

international law -- the way that you get compensation

22

in tort regimes is you hold agents liable and you hold

23

corporations liable for the acts of their agents.

24

absolutely understood.

25

you think of the three things that a tort statute is

It's

And there's no good reason -- if

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

18
1

supposed to accomplish -- compensation, deterrence, and

2

accountability -- on all three of those stands, the TVPA

3

utterly falls flat if it cannot reach organizations, and

4

this is the perfect case that shows you how that is.

5

Just to start with remedies --

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Maybe organizations opposed

Is that

Well -And is Congress ever

clue that that's -- that that's what Congress was

incorporate that usage.

It's about the second or
And this

It has a specialized usage that accumulated

And so, there is case after case where this

Court has said -- the Morissette principle as a backdrop

against common law, where this Court has said that you

do look to usage in prior opinions, prior case law,

meaning.

that I posed, which is why would Congress have done this

described, then what Meyer and other cases say is you

assume if Congress didn't think about it, but they

wanted ordinary tort and agency principles, in the --

10

the -- in Title VII and many other cases, this Court has

said, of course, Congress doesn't think about all these

12

things; and when they don't, and absent evidence to the

13

contrary --

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

Maybe they did.

You see, I

15

might as well be honest with you, page 26 of the

16

Government's brief did have an impact on my thinking.

17

It's Father Drinan, and Father Drinan says in the

groups."

quote, remember, that hearing was held before the Oslo

14

Accords, before the PLO became in our view a state

actor.

16

in context, Justice Breyer, is that the TVPA shouldn't

14

created for a policy of torturing people abroad,

There's no good reason under deterrence

statute was created.

killing American citizens; and the idea that Congress

would have passed a statute that these organizations can

5

that our statute in the U.S. Code would -- would somehow

6

only get their agent, and not the organization or entity

itself, we submit it just doesn't make any sense.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

8
9

Well, the TVPA is an

extraordinary step in terms of exposing liability, and

10

it doesn't seem to me to be an odd idea that Congress

11

would want to proceed carefully before establishing a

12

situation where the use of the American tribunal is as

13

broad as it is under this situation.
MR. FISHER:

14

Well, I don't -- I don't

15

disagree that it's an unusual statute.

of; just that we've cited in our briefs many other U.S.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Fisher, one case that

13

you seem to have on your side -- you don't have very

many, but you have this one -- is Clinton, which --

15

which does read "individual" in the way that you say and

does it in order to avoid an absurd result, what the

Court thought of as an absurd result.

your indulgence for one moment, I don't think I need to

had in mind in enacting the TVPA was adjusting the norm

against state-sponsored torture and extrajudicial

killing, where the agent is -- is almost invariably

acting on behalf of the state; and yet, it didn't create

11

It was concerned with this Filartiga
scenario, where the U.S. wanted to take a position:
will not give torturers a safe haven in our country.

What about the

12

point that the immigration law takes care of that?

13

wouldn't be able to get into the country.

14

We

MS. FERGUSON:

They

The immigration laws were not

16

know that the TVPA is premised on the fact that the

torturer is, in fact, found in the United States

because, otherwise, the United States couldn't assert

Congress had foremost in mind was the state.

This is

state-sponsored torture, state-sponsored extrajudicial

torture and extrajudicial killing was one of states.

wrong of a torturer avoiding accountability to their

out individuals who subject others to torture, but

question is whether there was a plausible reason why

Congress would have taken this incremental approach and

focused first on those personally responsible versus

20

extending liability more broadly under secondary

21

liability theories.

22

on its face because "individual" carries its ordinary

meaning and the surrounding statutory text confirm that

reason I say that is because if you want to elaborate on

said, have an impact was Father Drinan is asked,

rights supporters who were strong advocates of getting

12

incremental approach, that where there was some

13

certainty within international law within this area of

official torture carried out by public officials under

color of state law, and it provided a cause of action

for this Filartiga scenario, and even the human rights

cautiously and incrementally.

14

the sponsor of the bill that was ultimately enacted.

15

So, he was certainly aware that "individual" was

16

selected for this reason of excluding corporations.

17

But, more importantly, "individual" almost

18

invariably carries the meaning of "natural person."

If

19

Congress had wanted the statute to reach nonsovereign

"person," as section 1983 does.

22

they couldn't use "person" because it would encompass

can use them interchangeably without being confusing.

21

about organizations.

22

So, in -- so, in the same sentence of the

23

statute, to use "individual" to mean -- oh, let's assume

24

we know it normally means corporations, and then

immediately just switch and -- and use it to refer to

human beings would be very confusing.

2

And yet, we see Congress very deliberately

and carefully then switch to the broader term "person"

4

when it wanted to sweep in a broader class of potential

5

plaintiffs.

6

as broadly as possible to allow persons who have

7

wrongful death claims to be able to bring a suit where

8

the victim has died.

They wanted to make sure they were sweeping

So, they use the term "person."

And Petitioners' interpretation gives no

10

separate meaning to "individual" and "person," but we

11

assume that when Congress uses those terms distinctly,

12

they intend to give them different meanings.

13

I would just return to the plain text of the

14

statute.

It's very clear.

The only situation in which

15

the Court has found that "individual" should be

interpreted inconsistent with its ordinary meaning is

upon a showing of absurd results.

MR. GANNON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

8
9

Thank you, counsel.

By using the term "individual" when
describing who shall be liable for damages under the

10

Torture Victim Protection Act, Congress chose to limit

11

the statute's scope to natural persons.

12

ordinary meaning of the term "individual," especially in

13

legal usage.

14

this statute uses the term "person" in addition to the

15

term "individual."

16

That's the

And, as Justice Sotomayor pointed out,

JUSTICE ALITO:

Mr. Gannon, suppose two

17

people are tortured, and one is an alien who has never

18

been within 10,000 miles of the United States, and the

19

other is a U.S. citizen.

20
21
22

The position of the United States is that
the alien can sue, but the U.S. citizen can't?
MR. GANNON:

The position of the United

23

States is that the alien may be able to sue.

And I

24

think that that's going to depend ultimately on this

25

Court's construction of the ATS.

There are always going

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

42
1

to be differences in application between the ATS and the

2

TVPA so long as the ATS is still on the books and has

3

any vitality.

4

That, of course, wasn't clear to Congress

5

when it enacted the TVPA in 1992.

It wasn't sure

6

whether the ATS was going to be a going concern in light

7

of Judge Bork's opinion in Tel-Oren.

8

amend the ATS, Congress in the TVPA decided to create a

9

separate statute which provided an express right of

But rather than

10

action both to aliens and to U.S. citizens for two

11

specific norms.

12

It's broader than the ATS in several ways,

13

but it's narrower that the ATS in several ways.

14

your hypothetical involved piracy, two victims of

15

piracy, then it's quite clear after this Court's

16

decision in Sosa --

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

So, if

No, but two victims of

18

torture -- you don't find that to be an incongruous

19

result?

20

MR. GANNON:

Well, I think that is

21

ultimately going to depend upon what happens under this

22

Court's ATS jurisprudence.

23

the Court --

JUSTICE ALITO:

And so, it does seem that

I'm asking about your

position, the position of the United States; not how --

Alderson Reporting Company

43

MR. GANNON:

The position of the United

2

States in the other case today is that the ATS does not

3

include a categorical bar on corporate liability and

4

that that -- that has no regard for the theory of

5

liability, the locus of the acts, the citizenship of the

6

parties, and the character of the international law norm

7

at issue.

9

JUSTICE ALITO:
naturalized.

10

Suppose Mr. Rahim had never been

I guess that was a mistake.
MR. GANNON:

Well, in -- in this instance

11

then -- then that would present a different question

12

that this Court has not yet been presented with under

13

the ATS; and, ultimately, maybe an alien will be able to

14

bring a suit under the ATS that he can't bring -- that a

15

U.S. citizen could not bring under the TVPA, but that is

16

a product of the fact that there are still two different

17

statutes.

18

The Alien Tort Statute will always give more

19

rights to aliens than to U.S. citizens because by

20

definition it is only available to aliens.

2

MR. GANNON:

Well, I think that there are

3

several reasons that Congress could have had in mind,

although I think that if you read the legislative

5

record, that Justice Kagan is probably correct, that

6

most members of the Congress weren't thinking precisely

7

about this question.

Representative Leach appears to

I think that in the other passage cited on

10

Drinan that Justice Breyer was looking at before,

11

there's an earlier passage that we cite where Father

12

Drinan seems to indicate that there may be a distinction

13

between the two bills that are pending before the Senate

refers to individuals.

why they ended up with this result, the chief of which

is that all of the cases that they were thinking about

7

Here Congress did define a class of

JUSTICE BREYER:

The

That's why they're thinking

of it.

His argument the other way, which I see now, is

9

that -- is that, look, Father Drinan and the others are

10

not talking about individual versus person; they're

11

talking about whether, say, the PLO falls under color of

12

law of a foreign state.

13

that question.

MR. GANNON:

It's true --

it does fall under color of law there, they don't care

They've never

Well, but the -In fact, the only one who

thought about it was Congressman Leach, and that was

23

MR. GANNON:

No, but the reason that they're

24

not thinking about it is because the paradigm that they

25

were thinking about was the -- the torturer who is found

There's an individual moral accountability

To the extent that the legislative history

They basically are references to things

15

They -- the case that Petitioners

And so, I think as a -- as a practical

18

matter, although it is natural for us to think that if

19

an individual is liable, then so too is the -- is the

20

organization that it may have been acting -- he may have

21

been acting on behalf of; but it is not natural to think

22

that these type of clandestine shadowy organizations

23

that would claim responsibility for such acts, such

24

heinous acts, overseas would have a jurisdictional

25

presence in the United States.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

47
1

And I think if you -- as Respondents'

2

counsel already noted, because the TVPA requires state

3

action, the organizational entity here is usually going

4

to be the state, but Petitioners acknowledge that no

5

state entity is going to be liable here.

6

And, indeed, the result here is not that

7

dissimilar to some of this Court's 1983 jurisprudence.

8

Petitioners mentioned the question of whether Congress

9

was concerned that the term "person" might pull in

10

something like municipalities because it could be read

11

to bring in sovereigns, but in -- in the context of

12

municipalities, under Monell this Court has concluded

13

that there's no respondeat superior liability and that

14

superiors or supervisors are not liable for the torts of

15

their agents; they're only liable for their own

16

individual wrongs.

17

And so, I do think that there are policy

18

reasons why Congress could have said something different

19

here, but -- and they may well be encouraged to do that

20

by 20 years of ATS precedent that has now, for the first

21

time since the TVPA was enacted, started to raise the

22

question of whether corporations should be held liable

23

under the other statute.

24
25

If Congress wants to disagree with the types
of policy concerns that were behind this Court's Monell

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

48
1

decision, Congress could reach a different result, but

2

we don't -- we don't think that that's a decision that

3

ought to be reached through statutory construction.

4

Here, Congress used the term "individual."

5

It spoke about an individual who subjects an individual

6

to torture or extrajudicial killing.

7

referred to "person."

8

-- of the statute actually gets the relationship between

9

person and individual, which is quite clear as an

It separately

And Petitioners' reading of the

10

ordinary question of Federal statutory construction in

11

the Dictionary Act, precisely backwards because under

12

their reading, "individual" means any nonsovereign

13

natural or artificial person, but "person" can mean only

14

natural person.

15

And so, we think that that is -- is a

16

particularly odd reading of the statute in light of the

17

Dictionary Act and the statutory structure.

19

If there are no further questions, I'd urge
the Court to affirm.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY FISHER

24

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

25

MR. FISHER:

I can make four points, if I

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

49
1

may, Your Honor.

2

First, when asked again and again why

3

Congress would have done this, I think all I heard was

4

that Congress wanted to adopt an incremental approach.

5

And then Mr. Gannon said, well, maybe we also wanted to

6

have moral accountability.

7

Well, an incremental approach doesn't make

8

any sense.

Yes, Congress did so in the context of

9

requiring exhaustion and a limitations period.

And so,

10

it treaded softly there.

But there are numerous Federal

11

statutes -- RICO, the Sherman Act, the Antiterrorism

12

Act, which is quite similar to this act in many ways --

13

that apply to events abroad.

14

organizations.

15

there's no reason to think it wouldn't have wanted to do

16

it.

And they all apply to

So, if Congress was going to do this,

17

Ms. Ferguson pointed to the Dorelien case as

18

the one example she could point of where a TVPA judgment

19

was able to be enforced.

20

was able to be enforced is because that guy happened to

21

win the Florida lottery.

22

assets abroad and won the Florida lottery.

23

And the only reason why that

He had hidden all of his other

And is that the statute that Congress meant

24

to pass?

We don't think so.

Moral accountability was

25

already taken care of in the U.S. Criminal Code.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

50
1

There's an express provision of the U.S. Criminal Code

2

that holds torturers liable for torturing abroad.

3

we've cited that in our briefs.

4

And

I know some of you are going to look at the

5

legislative history.

6

about the legislative history.

7

So, let me say two quick things

First, Justice Kagan, with respect to

8

Representative Leach's comment, if anyone after that

9

hearing wanted to know what that committee thought the

10

change it had made meant and what the bill meant, it

11

would have looked at its report.

12

we've cited the committee reports from the Foreign

13

Relations Committee, and it says the TVPA allows

14

liability for any person that commits torture.

15

the word "person" utterly interchangeably with the word

16

"individual."

17

happened 4 years before the enactment was long since

18

lost.

19

And if we've cited --

It uses

So, that -- whatever -- whatever moment

And the reason it used ultimately the word

20

"individual" and not "person," as I've described before,

21

was to steer clear, I think, of any possibility of state

22

entities.

23

Mr. Gannon points to Monell, but Monell

24

favors us.

25

liable.

Monell holds that organizations can be

Now, there's a separate question that you

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

51
1

talked about in the earlier argument, too, as to what

2

the mens rea would be, whether it would have to be

3

according to a policy or practice or whether it would be

4

pure respondeat superior.

5

this case, and we've alleged a policy in our complaint

6

in this case.

7

But Monell is on our side in

Thirdly, in the U.S. Code, where the word

8

"individual" is used, it obviously means natural persons

9

lots of times.

But when it does, it almost always uses

10

the -- contrasts it in that very sentence with an entity

11

or organization.

12

And so, in discourse, when you say

13

"individuals" or "corporations," yes, you mean a natural

14

person.

15

3 of its own brief, the word "individual" when it's used

16

alone is a less favored usage that actually gives rise

17

to ambiguity because of the secondary meaning I've

18

described before.

19

But as the United States points out in footnote

And then, finally, let me say -- the

20

questions were asked about the relationship between this

21

case and the Kiobel case.

22

clear -- and this goes again to one of Justice Kagan's

23

questions on absurdity -- if this Court holds that the

24

Alien Tort Statute would have let a torturer right by

25

Mr. Rahim, someone who is tortured, that is, bring a

And I think it's absolutely

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

52
1

cause of action, I think it would indeed be absurd to

2

imagine Congress stepping in and passing a statute

3

saying if you're an American citizen, I'm sorry, you're

4

out of luck; but if you happen to be lucky enough to be

5

an alien and never having tried to be a citizen in this

6

country, go ahead and bring a case in our courts.

7

think that would be absurd.

We

8

So, with those points, if the Court has any

9

further questions around the submissions I've made -- I

10

guess the last thing I would say is, at the end of Mr.

11

Gannon's argument, he referred to the interplay between

12

the word "individual" and "person" in the briefs, and I

13

can assure you from have having worked on this during

14

the case, it is an incredible sideshow as to whether or

15

not estates are people and all the ways that that works.

16

But it's laid out in our brief, and we think that it's

17

quite clear, that there is no disjoint between the word

18

"individual" and "person."

19

will explain why.
