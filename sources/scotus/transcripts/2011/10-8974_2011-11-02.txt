ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD GUERRIERO

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

We'll hear argument

MR. GUERRIERO:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
An eyewitness identification made under a

10
11

suggestive influence presents a unique danger of

12

misidentification and a miscarriage of justice.

13

that danger of misidentification which implicates due

14

process and requires an evaluation of the reliability of

15

the identification.

16
17

It is

The constitutional --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counselor, does your

position depend on police involvement at all?

18

MR. GUERRIERO:

No, Your Honor.

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm -- if a private

20

investigator shows a picture or -- that has no

21

connection to the police, a company's investigator --

22
23

25

MR. GUERRIERO:

What I would suggest is

that -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- or the news media

publishes a picture of someone that it thinks -3

1

MR. GUERRIERO:

I have a two-part answer to

2

that.

3

influence is how it affects reliability.

4

time that influence, the defense will allege, is from

5

some police activity and rightly so because they're

6

mostly involved and rightly so because police suspicion

7

is the kind of influence that would direct the witness's

8

attention and say that's the man.

9

The -- the significance of the suggestive
Most of the

But it's not necessarily required, and in

10

fact in -- one of the Federal court of appeal cases,

11

Dunnigan v. Keane, involved exactly that, a private

12

investigator, where a private investigator from a bank

13

showed surveillance photos to the witness and then later

14

the witnesses made an ID.

I mean --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

Mr. Guerriero, if it's

16

not -- if it's not limited to suggestive circumstances

17

created by the police, why is unreliable eyewitness

18

identification any different from unreliable anything

19

else?

20

evidence introduced in criminal cases to see if it was

21

reliable or not?

22

So, shouldn't we look at every instance of

MR. GUERRIERO:

No, Your Honor.

I suggest

23

that eyewitness identification evidence is unique, and I

24

think that this Court recognized that in Wade and in the

25

subsequent cases, in fact described it at that time as
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

probably the leading cause of miscarriages of justice.

2

And in fact experience with the DNA exonerations that

3

we've seen recently in the last 10 or 15 years have

4

shown that.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So, at least for all

6

eyewitness testimony, there would have to be some

7

pretesting for reliability; is that -- is that your

8

contention?

9

MR. GUERRIERO:

No, Your Honor, and I don't

10

think that's exactly what the Court said in Wade and the

11

subsequent cases.

12

identification testimony plus the suggestive influence

13

which makes -- which brings it to sort of the height of

14

suspicion and creates the greatest risk.

It's the combination of eyewitness

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

15

And in this case, in

16

which category do you place the eyewitness testimony?

17

Is it police suggestion, or is it suggestive but not

18

through any manipulation on the police's part?

19

MR. GUERRIERO:

In our case, we do not

20

allege any manipulation or intentional orchestration by

21

the police.

22

witness, to Ms. Blandon, that Mr. Perry was in fact a

23

suspect, and she looked down, and there was that

24

suspicion.

25

But our position is that it appeared to the

Now, if we would have been able to have our
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

due process claim heard, the judge may or may not have

2

agreed that that was suggestive and created a risk.

3

But --

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Do you think that our cases

5

which exclude or -- or require reversal when there's

6

eyewitness testimony impaired by the police -- you think

7

that's really limited to eyewitness testimony?

8

the police created suggestiveness in another category of

9

evidence.

Suppose

Let's say -- let's say voice evidence, that

10

the killer had left a message on the -- on the phone.

11

And the police in some manner create suggestiveness that

12

causes a witness to identify that as the voice of the

13

killer.

14

is not eyewitness testimony; eyewitness testimony

15

creates a special risk?

16

say, whenever the police render evidence unreliable, it

17

-- it should be excluded?

You really think that we would say, well, this

18

Don't you think that we would

I think that may be a

19

separate due process claim.

But that -- that

argument for eyewitness, we should similarly accept it

There's nothing special about

1

MR. GUERRIERO:

I -- I disagree, Your Honor.

2

I think that what the Court has said is that there is

3

something special about eyewitness identification

testimony.

5
6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, I'm saying we don't

mean it.

7

(Laughter.)

8

MR. GUERRIERO:

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well -I'm saying that it's

10

unbelievable that if the -- if the police created

11

testimony, not eyewitness testimony, but testimony that

12

was unreliable because of police suggestiveness, I think

13

we would throw that out as well.

14

MR. GUERRIERO:

Don't you think so?

I -- well, I think that in

15

any case -- and I think the Court has said this in other

16

circumstances, that in any case a defendant could raise

17

a due process claim and say, either because of the way

18

the prosecution handled the evidence or because of the

19

-- the combination of rulings on evidence, that there

20

was a due process violation that implicated fundamental

21

fairness.

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In this case, suppose that

23

the police talked to this -- to the lady that was in the

24

-- in the apartment and saw the thing out the window and

25

said:

I don't know what you want the police to do in
It seems to me it would have been (a)

10

improper police conduct not to ask the woman, is this

11

the man?

12

MR. GUERRIERO:

I disagree, Your Honor.

If

13

the police wanted to ask her to make an identification,

14

they could have done a line-up procedure or a photo

15

line-up procedure fairly promptly that would be distinct

16

from and much more fair than the show-up at the scene.

17

And there was no emergency or exigency here that would

18

require a show-up.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What about -- what about

20

unreliable eyewitness testimony in favor of the

21

defendant?

22

causes you to exclude it when it's been introduced by

23

the prosecution, but here it's being introduced by the

24

defendant to show that it was somebody else, okay?

MR. GUERRIERO:

If you say it's

The Due Process Clause -All of the evidence that --

MR. GUERRIERO:

Well, the defendant is

obviously not trying to deprive the State of its liberty

13

in the same way that the State is trying to deprive the

14

defendant of his liberty at trial.

that there wouldn't be evidentiary grounds for the State

17

to raise that objection.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So, the Due Process
That's not to say

No, but you see, when --

19

when it's the State that causes the unreliability, I can

20

see why it is a -- a ground that can be invoked only by

21

the defendant.

22

it doesn't matter whether the State was the cause or

23

not, I don't know why it wouldn't work both ways, that

the evidence is inherently unreliable, and it ought to

even go further.
JUSTICE ALITO:

Something more is needed;

suggestiveness is needed.

That's right.

JUSTICE ALITO:

Can you just define what you

mean by "suggestiveness"?
MR. GUERRIERO:

Well, I think the Court has

14

given examples.

15

show-up -- the example in Foster involved a couple of

16

different kinds of suggestiveness.

17

police did a line-up where the defendant was the only

18

common person.

If it's effectively a show-up or a

JUSTICE ALITO:

One was where the

Yes, but those are all

20

situations where the police is involved -- the police

21

are involved.

22

MR. GUERRIERO:

Right.

The nonpolice

23

examples of suggestiveness that rise to the due process

24

level are mostly going to be show-ups.

ground that studies have shown that those may be less

reliable?

7

MR. GUERRIERO:

Would that qualify on the

That may be a separate

8

ground to move for a jury instruction or for an expert.

9

I'm not sure that -- we certainly don't argue here and

10

it wasn't argued below that that's a separate due

11

process ground.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:
Why not?

Why not?

I mean, that's

13

the point.

What about an eyewitness

14

identification from 200 yards?

15

leave it to the jury, and the jury would say that's very

16

unlikely.

17

excluded, and if it's not, you retry the person.

18

is magic about suggestiveness as opposed to all of the

19

other matters that could cause eyewitness identification

20

to be wrong?

You know, normally you'd

21

But you want to say it's -- it has to be

MR. GUERRIERO:

What

Well, two answers to that,

22

Your Honor.

First, it's not that these things are --

23

are always excluded, and in fact the Court has set a

24

very high bar.

25

excluded only if it's very substantially likely to lead

I mean, the standard is this evidence is

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

to a misidentification.

2

So --

JUSTICE ALITO:

I understand that, but I

3

need to know what you mean by "suggestiveness."

4

does that mean?

5

it?

6

What

Can you just give me a definition of

MR. GUERRIERO:

It is conduct or

7

circumstances that point -- that tell the witness that's

And, most commonly, it would be showing a

10

or it appearing, as in this case, that the -- the

11

defendant was a suspect.

12

Court has defined it, as conduct that says that's the

13

man.

14

And that's essentially how the

So, there may be some things that the

15

defense argues that are suggestive, and the trial court

16

looks at it and says, you know, that's a very slight

17

suggestion.

with a mustache.

19

further.

20

That doesn't qualify as saying that's the man.

21

You say he is the only guy in the line-up
I don't even -- I'm not going any

I don't think that's sufficient suggestion.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But just to repeat Justice

22

Scalia's question, once you're not talking about police

23

suggestiveness, once you're talking about suggestiveness

24

that arises from non-State conduct, why should we be

25

focused on suggestiveness as opposed to any other cause
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

of unreliability?

2

MR. GUERRIERO:

Well, because that's what --

3

my first reason is that that's what the Court focused on

4

in Wade as -- as the main danger.

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, the Court was focusing

6

on police suggestiveness.

7

cases.

8

problem, and the bigger problem is the unreliability of

9

identifications generally, but that doesn't relate to

10

That's the context of all our

Now, you might say, well, look, there's a bigger

suggestiveness per se.

11

MR. GUERRIERO:

Well, I think our position

12

is in between there.

We're not saying that there's a

13

due process right to have eyewitness evidence excluded

14

generally without some suggestiveness.

15

saying is that if the suggestion comes from a nonpolice

16

source or if it, as in this case, involved the police

17

but their involvement was unintentional, it's just

18

accidental, that that suggestiveness should still be

19

considered because --

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What we are

What does that mean?
Do you distinguish the --

22

do you distinguish the husband's situation?

He was an

eyewitness too, but there was a motion to suppress her

testimony.

eyewitness testimony but no suggestiveness?

Is that an example where there's an

5

motion to suppress his testimony as well.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I don't have a good

So, you'd put them both

in the same category?

8

MR. GUERRIERO:

I would have.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Why isn't it -- this

10

may be -- just, again, following up on Justice Alito's

11

question, but there's always a degree of suggestiveness.

12

It's not like the person is, you know, picked randomly

13

off the street and saying, you know, do you know this

14

person?

15

person has some contact with it.

16

some suggestiveness that, well, this person might have

17

something to do with what went on.

18

It's in the context of an investigation.

MR. GUERRIERO:

The

So, there's always

That's right.

And if there

19

-- if it rises to the level of what the Court has given

20

as examples of a show-up or the same defendant appearing

21

in a line-up or something else that says that's the man,

22

then that raises a red flag.

23

And it's not a --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But whenever --

24

whenever the witness is asked, at least there's a

25

suggestion that this might be the man.
15
Alderson Reporting Company

And I don't know

Official

1

why you would think that's any greater than this is the

2

man.

3

the person that we think did it; is that who you saw?

4

They say, did you see this guy?

5

The police don't come up usually and say, this is

MR. GUERRIERO:

Actually, I disagree with

6

that aspect of your question, Your Honor.

And in fact I

7

think the proper police procedure in certainly the

8

police departments that I'm familiar with will instruct

9

the witness that -- do not assume that anyone that we

10

think is a suspect is in this line-up.

11

the standard witness instructions, and they may even do

12

multiple line-ups where they say, okay, we're going to

13

show you three sets of eight, and the suspect -- or

14

there may or may not be a suspect in any of them.

15

just want you to look at this set and see if anyone --

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And that's in

We

Well, what about a

17

situation like the one we had here, where you're not

18

talking about a line-up?

19

MR. GUERRIERO:

That's right.

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But you're talking

21

about the scene of a crime, and the police says, do you

22

know this person, did you see this person, or anything

23

else?

24

course of an investigation, I think you would have to

25

say is suggestive, because the person is not picked up

That in itself, any type of identification in the

16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

randomly.

2

MR. GUERRIERO:

It is, but the key is that

3

it's not the suggestion that results in exclusion.

4

the suggestion that raises the red flag that allows the

5

defendant to say, would the trial court please evaluate

6

this according to the standards?

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It's

So, this is --

8

again, this is just following up, I guess.

But I

9

remember in law school one of the things in criminal

10

law, the professor says, all right, everybody be quiet.

11

And then a certain amount of time goes by, and then he

12

starts asking people, well, how much time went by?

13

people -- some people say 4 minutes, some people say,

14

you know, 1 minute.

15

remembering correctly, to be a lot shorter than most

16

people think.

17

And

And it turns out, if I'm

So, that's at least, the point was trying to

18

be made anyway, at least as unreliable as eyewitness

19

testimony.

20

wouldn't it?

So, your argument would have to cover that,

21

MR. GUERRIERO:

I --

3

MR. GUERRIERO:

I think it's important to

4

look back at what the Court said in Wade and in fact how

5

what the Court said in Wade has been borne out.

6

course, there's aspects of unreliability to any kind of

7

evidence.

8

9

evidence.

Of

Somebody could come and claim that there's

I think last term somebody made a claim --

10

tried to assert a claim regarding DNA evidence that was

11

akin to an eyewitness identification claim.

12

But the point is that this kind of evidence

13

was singled out by the Court and recognized as having

14

particular dangers, and it's been borne out by the

15

studies, not psychological --

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

17

the context of procedures that the police had

18

instituted.

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And your -- and your

rationale goes much beyond it.

23

And he said:

Has it ever happened to you that

7

(Laughter.)

8

MR. GUERRIERO:

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Right.
And there was good light.

So, you teach the jury this way.

10

And

And you're

11

just -- you're just usurping the province of the jury,

12

it seems.

13

MR. GUERRIERO:

I don't think so, Your

14

Honor.

I mean, we're -- what -- I think what this Court

15

has said is that this is a special category of evidence

16

that has to be red-flagged by or can be red-flagged by

17

the defense for the trial judge to look at it and say --

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

19

MR. GUERRIERO:

20

What is --- on a case by -- I'm

sorry.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

Go ahead.

You were saying

22

on a case that all you want to do is red-flag it for the

23

judge.

24
25

MR. GUERRIERO:

And then the trial judge

would look at it and in the rare case where he says it's
19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

very substantially likely, which we agree is a high

2

standard --

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

Now, how does

4

that differ from what exists in I think every State and

5

certainly in the Federal Rules in Rule 403?

6

may exclude evidence if its relevance is outweighed by

7

its prejudice or misleading the jury.

8

instance where you think that this statement about to

9

come in is unreliable for various reasons, you say:

The judge

So, why, in any

10

Judge, will you please look please look at Rule 403?

11

have some experts over here and whatever else you want

12

that would show that this is misleading to the jury.

13

For all the reasons you have said in your brief, right?

14

All right.

I

So -- so, since that is already

15

the law and it does apply to every piece of evidence,

16

including all the things we've been talking about, what

17

is it that you want to change?

18

MR. GUERRIERO:

Well, to answer the first

19

part of your question, what's different about this

20

evidence is that --

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

I didn't say what's

22

different about it.

I'm not looking for a difference.

23

I'm looking -- I'm saying they're all the same.

24

indeed, we do what you want right now.

25

403 in the Federal system.

And,

It's called Rule

What I'm asking you is what
20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

is it you want done, since all you want is the judge to

2

look at it carefully, that is not done at this moment?

3

MR. GUERRIERO:

The analysis under 403,

4

which New Hampshire of course has as well, will accord a

5

certain weight and value to the opportunity of counsel

6

to cross-examine the witness and to make arguments to

7

the jury.

8

Court has said, precious though it is, the right of

9

cross-examination does not always --

And unlike any other kind of evidence, this

JUSTICE BREYER:

10

No, but, judges don't, I'm

11

sure -- I'm not 100 percent sure; you'd have to ask a

12

trial judge.

13

judges say under Rule 403:

14

and it is prejudicial and it can't be made up for;

15

therefore, I exclude it.

16

But I am sure there are instances where

All right?

I conclude it is misleading

That happens.

Now, since that's

17

what you want the judge to do, I repeat my question:

18

What is the difference between what you're asking for

19

and what already exists in the law?

20

MR. GUERRIERO:

The --

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

22

MR. GUERRIERO:

23

The difference is that under a normal 403

Unless -- well, go ahead.
I'm sorry.

24

analysis, when I told the judge, when I said she never

25

could describe his face, she couldn't even say what
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

clothes he was wearing, the judge will respond to me and

2

say, that's fine; that's all great fodder for

3

cross-examination.

4

evidence is that it's not just ---

5

But the difference with this kind of

JUSTICE BREYER:

Whoa, wait.

Let me stop

6

you there, because now what you seem to be saying is it

7

isn't the case that you simply want the judge to look at

8

this with care; rather, you want the judge to change her

9

result.

You want sometimes this to be excluded where

10

under 403 it is sometimes not excluded.

11

Now, I asked, if that's what you want, that's a

12

different matter.

13

so, you're proposing a different substantive standard,

14

and I want to know what it is.

That's a substantive standard.

MR. GUERRIERO:

15

All right.

And

It's -- it's the standard

16

that this Court has established:

17

reasonably likely or substantially likely to lead to a

18

risk of misidentification at trial.

19

likely.
JUSTICE ALITO:

20

If it's reasonably --

Very substantially

But that would be really a

21

great change from the way trials are now conducted,

22

wouldn't it?

23

raped, and the victim doesn't really have a very good

24

opportunity to see the perpetrator.

25

person has a mask and so forth.

Let me give you this example:

A victim is

It's dark, the

A couple of weeks go

22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

by, and the victim reads on article in the paper that

2

says so-and-so has been arrested for a rape in another

3

part of the city.

4

the paper.

5

who raped me.

There's a picture of that person in

6

And the victim says that's the person who --

Now, you want to make it possible for the

7

judge to say to the -- that victim may not testify and

8

identify the person -- that that person -- that the

9

victim says was the perpetrator of the rape, on the

10

ground that the newspaper picture was suggestive, even

11

though there wasn't any police involvement, and when you

12

look at all the circumstances, the identification is

13

unreliable.

14

Now, maybe that's a good system, but that is

15

a drastic change, is it not, from the way criminal

16

trials are now conducted?

17

MR. GUERRIERO:

Well, it's certainly not the

18

change from what the law is in the Federal circuits that

19

we cited.

20

the --

21

And I would also point out that in one of

JUSTICE ALITO:

Do you know of cases like

22

that in which the judge has said that eyewitness

23

identification cannot come in?

24
25

MR. GUERRIERO:

In Thigpen v. Cory, which is

a Sixth Circuit case, the court said -- in fact, they
23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

specifically used the phrase "police machinations" --

2

that this did not arise from police machinations.

3

was basically happenstance in that case that the witness

4

was -- the witness identified the defendant, and that

5

was excluded as unreliable.

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It

But we've said in our

7

case, Neil v. Biggers -- that was a rape case, and we

8

allowed it.

9

We allowed the eyewitness.
MR. GUERRIERO:

Well -- and I think the

10

Court said in all its cases, and in particular in

11

Simmons, that each case --

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And, in fact, we said that

13

it was unnecessarily suggestive but that it was still

14

reliable.

15

MR. GUERRIERO:

And it may be.

I mean, it

16

may -- you could have an extremely -- you could have a

17

-- the police could do a show-up intending to produce an

18

ID, but if the witness got a very good look at the

19

person, was calm, was maybe a police officer like in

20

Brathwaite, and the court said, we don't care how

21

deliberate this -- and even if there's manipulation, we

22

don't care how much of that there is, we find it's

23

reliable here.

24
25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Suppose that there were some

other category of testimony which proved even more
24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

unreliable than the category that you're talking about.

2

Let's say that it turned out, study after study after

3

study, that jailhouse informants lie.

4

testimony of jailhouse informants is likely to be just

5

completely unreliable, to, you know, double as much as

6

eyewitness testimony.

7

And so, the

Same rule for that?

MR. GUERRIERO:

I think it would be a very

8

high burden for the defense to meet there, but if the

9

finding was that there are times that a witness, that --

10

like in the eyewitness situation, where the witness

11

truly believes that they're identifying the right

12

person, but they are actually not and it could result in

13

a miscarriage of justice, then I do believe fundamental

14

fairness requires the Court to say due process doesn't

15

allow that evidence.

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Okay.

Well, now we're

17

talking about -- now we are setting up a standard that

18

applies outside eyewitness testimony.

19

testimony that we find to be -- categories of testimony

20

that we find to be extremely unreliable will be subject

21

to this new due process red flag.

22

MR. GUERRIERO:

It's just

Is that right?

Well, I don't think so, Your

23

Honor, but more for a factual reason in that the Court

24

said in 1967 that this is the leading cause of

25

miscarriage of justice.

The studies and -- not just
25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

studies, but the transcripts and records of actual

2

trials.

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

No, I understand you have

4

very good empirical evidence which should lead us all to

5

wonder about the reliability of eyewitness testimony.

6

I'm just suggesting that eyewitness testimony is not the

7

only kind of testimony which people can do studies on

8

and find that it's more unreliable than you would think.

9

MR. GUERRIERO:

Well, it may -- if somebody

10

else came along and said we've done a study and we find

11

this kind of evidence, that in 75 percent of the

12

wrongful convictions, this evidence contributed to the

13

miscarriage of justice, then I would think the Court

14

should take a look at that.

15

evidence matches that.

16

But I don't think any other

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What about all the -- all

17

the other safeguards that you have?

18

the judge to tell the jury be careful; eyewitness

19

testimony is often unreliable.

20

in cross-examination --

21

MR. GUERRIERO:

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I mean, you can ask

You can point that out

Yes.
-- ask all those

23

questions.

You can say something about it in your

24

summation to the jury.

25

up, you have the evidence rule that says if the

And, as Justice Breyer brought

26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

prejudicial value outweighs probative value, that the

2

judge can say, I'm not going to let it in.

3

Why aren't all those safeguards enough?

4

MR. GUERRIERO:

If all of those safeguards

5

were enough, even when the police made --

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

7

Well, leaving aside the

police --

8

MR. GUERRIERO:

Okay.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

-- because, there,

10

there's an interest in deterrence, in deterring the

11

police from manipulating evidence.

12

MR. GUERRIERO:

I don't think deterrence is

13

the primary basis of the Court's cases, Your Honor,

14

because the Court has said that if it proves to be

15

reliable, no matter how manipulative the police were,

16

this evidence comes in.

17

not primarily deterrence; it's the risk of an unfair

18

trial and the risk of a miscarriage of justice.

19
20

So, the basis of the rule is

JUSTICE GINSBURG:
between --

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

23

It is a difference

Well, it seems to me --- suggestive and

suggested by the police.

24

MR. GUERRIERO:

I'm sorry, Your Honor, I --

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The -- if the suggestion

27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

comes from the police, then the evidence will be

2

excluded.

3

unless we change the rules --

4
5

If the suggestion comes from some place else,

MR. GUERRIERO:

Well, I think that that's

a --

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

7

MR. GUERRIERO:

-- it would be admitted.

I mean, I think that that's

8

a -- that's a tricky issue to consider, because

9

suggestion coming from the police is different from

10

manipulation.

And if -- if the rule is unintended

11

suggestion from the police implicates due process, then

12

Perry was entitled to a due process analysis, because

13

the unintended suggestion here was apparent police

14

suspicion as he stood there.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL A. DELANEY

19

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

20
21
22

MR. DELANEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
An eyewitness identification implicates due

23

process concerns only when the police arrange a

24

confrontation to elicit a witness's identification of a

25

suspect and use unnecessarily suggestive techniques that
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

skew the fact-finding process.

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The central concern -Now we've changed the

3

language of Wade when it talks about intentional or

4

unintentional.

5

manipulation always has to be intentionally suggestive?

And you're suggesting that police

6

MR. DELANEY:

I'm not --

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Even if the policeman

8

tells you he wasn't really thinking or focusing on a

9

distinguishing characteristic in the line-up?

10

MR. DELANEY:

That may play a role, Justice

11

Sotomayor, but only in a limited sense, and not in the

12

way the Petitioner is suggesting we look at

13

unintentional conduct.

14

inquiry to trigger, there must be an arranged

15

confrontation of a suspect and a witness by the police.

16

First, for the due process

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could you tell me what

17

you think would have happened here?

18

the police asked this defendant to stay put.

19

didn't want him to leave the scene, correct?

20

MR. DELANEY:

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

There was a reason
They

That -- that's correct.
In your judgment -- I

22

think Justice Kennedy hit the nail on the head.

23

suspicion is that at some point they would have asked

24

the witnesses in the building and engaged in a show-up.

25

What's so different between intentionally doing the
29
Alderson Reporting Company

My

Official

1

show-up and holding the defendant in the back yard

2

standing there next to a police officer, so that anyone

3

who wants to -- like this woman, who wants to find the

4

guy, can just point to that one?

5

MR. DELANEY:

What's the difference?

The difference in this case is

6

the role that the police played in bringing about

7

potential suggestion under your hypothetical.

8

Due Process Clause is concerned about is the role of the

9

police in essentially stacking the deck, putting their

What the

10

thumb on the scale and skewing the fact-finding process.

11

It goes to the integrity of the process --

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No.

I mean, the way not

13

to skew it was to put him in the police car and just let

14

him sit there in the dark.

15

him wait at the scene of the crime.

16

So, they intentionally made

I'm not talking about whether this was

17

necessary or unnecessary, because I think that a

18

perfectly good argument could be made that the police

19

acted reasonably and necessarily.

20

no sense to move a defendant that far from the scene of

21

a crime if you're not sure he's the one who committed

22

the crime, he or she.

All right?

It makes

23

But I'm going to the question of how do we

24

define, if we write this opinion, manipulation without

25

getting into a mens rea type analysis and adding yet
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

another layer to Biggers?

2

MR. DELANEY:

Well, first, I don't think you

3

need to go there in this case.

4

based on the factual findings of the State court, the

5

police did not induce any type of show-up --

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You can simply say that,

But that's not -- we face

7

that problem anyway, even if we -- whether or not we

8

decide in this case that it doesn't matter that the

9

police manipulated it, we're always going to have the

10

problem of when has there been police manipulation;

11

right?

12

MR. DELANEY:

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

That's correct.
I mean, that -- that's not

a creation of this -- of this case.

15

MR. DELANEY:

That's correct.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And I -- I would guess that

17

in the case you're talking about, just telling the

18

person to stay where he is, is not -- now, it would be

19

different if -- if the defendant was -- was caught two

20

blocks away and the police bring him back to the scene

21

of the crime and make him stand there so that the woman

22

can see him from the window.

23

MR. DELANEY:

That's quite different.

It is quite different.

And

24

Stovall tells us that the test is an objective one.

25

look at the totality of the circumstances to determine
31
Alderson Reporting Company

We

Official

1

whether there has been suggestive conduct.

2

Now, in that regard --

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

When you say

4

that's -- when you say that's different, you're not --

5

you're not suggesting that that would be suggestive, are

6

you?

7

MR. DELANEY:

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

9

No, I'm not.
Because presumably,

that's the same argument -- that's for the jury and the

10

counsel.

11

was two blocks away, you know, and wasn't it only

12

because the police brought him back that you -- you

13

know, all of that.

14

in terms of whether you have a suppression hearing

15

before the trial.

16

They can say during cross-examination the guy

I don't see what difference it makes

MR. DELANEY:

That's correct, Mr. Chief

17

Justice.

18

And on the facts of this case, we do have clear factual

19

findings that this police officer in no way -- in no way

20

induced this witness to move towards the window and

21

identify a suspect who just happened to be standing next

22

to a police officer.

23

It would not make a difference in that regard.

If the concern under due process in this

24

area has been a deterrence rationale, which this Court

25

has stated in both Neil v. Biggers and in Manson v.
32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Brathwaite, that must be the guiding principle.

2

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, it's both, right,

3

General Delaney?

I mean, the Court has certainly talked

4

about deterrence, but the Court also has very

5

substantial discussions in all of these opinions about

6

reliability.

7

view, it doesn't really much matter whether the

8

unreliability is caused by police conduct or by

9

something else.

And from the criminal defendant's point of

So -- so, tell me a little bit why you think

10
11

the police conduct here -- you know, that has to be

12

there in every case?

13

MR. DELANEY:

That is true, Justice Kagan,

14

that -- that the opinions have discussed both issues.

15

And I would offer two considerations.

16

extent that the courts have talked about reliability as

17

the linchpin or the likelihood of misidentification

18

playing a role, they have only done that read in context

19

within and only after an unnecessarily suggestive

20

circumstance has been applied.

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

First, to the

I think that that's not

22

right.

I mean, the reason we want to deter this conduct

23

is because the conduct results in misidentifications, in

24

unreliable testimony.

25

is an important goal, is because this conduct leads to

That's the reason that deterrence

33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

2

unreliable testimony.
MR. DELANEY:

That is correct, and if we

3

expand that out and we apply that rationale to the

4

circumstances of a case not involving police activity,

5

we lose that deterrence rationale.

6

deterrence involved in a suggestive circumstance that

7

does not involve the police.

8

be repeat players in this system.

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

There is no

Civilians are not going to

And what you're -- what

10

you're saying, I take it, in the answer to Justice

11

Kagan, was that there's really a two-part step.

12

was the police procedure unnecessarily suggestive?

13

then if it was, are there other reliability -- was

14

reliability impaired?

First,

15

So, you go -- you ask both questions.

16

MR. DELANEY:

And

And that is the Biggers test.

17

And if we looked at reliability further as sort of the

18

touchstone of our due process inquiry, we would need to

19

misplace completely the role of examining whether the

20

suggestive circumstances are unnecessary.

21

inquiry into necessity only makes sense in the context

22

of a police investigation or police work.

23

look at Stovall, certainly there's an example of a case

24

that was a show-up, where this Court said that, despite

25

the clearly suggestive circumstances, that show-up was
34
Alderson Reporting Company

An -- an

And if we

imperative and necessary because the witness may have

2

been about to die.

3

The Court did not conduct a reliability

4

analysis.

5

the Stovall holding in question, and really Stovall

6

would be undermined.

7

So, if reliability is the linchpin, it puts

JUSTICE ALITO:

What you seem to -- what

8

you're saying -- what you're saying seems to suggest

9

that the rule we're talking about here is really not an

10

aspect of due process per se, but, like the Fourth

11

Amendment exclusionary rule, it's a special due process

12

exclusionary rule that is meant to deter conduct that

13

could result in a constitutional violation.

14

Is that right?

15

MR. DELANEY:

I -- I think that's correct,

16

Justice Alito.

And the analogy I would use would be to

17

your perjury cases.

18

due process standard that prevents police or prosecutors

19

from knowingly using false evidence.

20

there is how the police will skew the fact-finding

21

process.

22

similar to that.

In Mooney, you have clearly set a

And the concern

Stovall and the identification cases are very

23

Our concern, in essence, is that the police

24

through unnecessary suggestion in that circumstance are

25

going to skew the fact-finding process and, in this
35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

instance, in essence, create a false or altered memory.

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

If -- if the exclusionary

3

aspect of this is not part of due process itself, then

4

doesn't it follow that what due process requires is

5

reliability?

6

Petitioner's argument is correct, the due process

7

standard is simply reliability, not suggestiveness?

8
9

So, doesn't that mean that -- that the

MR. DELANEY:

It's -- the standard is not

reliability, Justice Alito.

The standard for due

10

process in this area is the use of orchestrated police

11

suggestion.

In -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What -- what about cases

13

with inflammatory evidence, too many lurid photos or

14

testimony that ignites prejudice in the community?

15

That's -- that's a -- that's reliability.

16

MR. DELANEY:

That is, and we have both

17

constitutional and non-constitutional tools and

18

procedures right now to address that.

19

require prosecutors, under Jackson v. Virginia, to have

20

And to the extent we did have

These facts are very different from

JUSTICE KAGAN:

should be this difference between these two cases.

12

you might want to say that where police conduct is

involved, the chances of an unreliable identification

are greater.

But the question is:

16

why are those two cases any different?

Now,

Or you may want to say something else.
If we're focused on reliability,

MR. DELANEY:

Well, if we do look back, to

18

determine whether the circumstances involving the police

19

are any more -- of more serious concern, if we look back

20

to Wade, this Court did talk about the unique role of

21

police suggestion in this context of confrontations, and

22

it specifically focused on the manner and the degree of

23

suggestion in which the manner that police or

suspect, what impact that can have.

1

That unique aspect of police suggestibility,

2

the fact that a police officer when it brings someone

forward is going to influence a witness to a high

degree, does play a role and is the grounds upon which

5

the Stovall cases have been built.

So, what has surprised me about this

case is in some ways the way the State court wrote this,

because if the State court had simply said something

25

like there was no unnecessary show-up here, they were

happened, there was no suggestiveness by the police

5

something else now because you're trying to define a

6

level of intent on the part of the police to create

7

unreliability that I think just complicates the inquiry.

MR.

DELANEY:

The argument has become

Sotomayor, I'm not trying to create that complication.

And, in fact, I would -- I would reference the State

court decision a little bit differently.

sort of suggestive techniques at play here and no

inducement.

15

said it disagrees with the show-up characterization,

16

that the witness had pointed out the Petitioner without

any inducement from the police officer; the officer did

not direct the witness's attention to the window, and

the officer did not ask whether a man in the parking lot

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT

2
3

MS. SAHARSKY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

4

A due process inquiry is required only when

5

there's a police-arranged confrontation in order to

6

obtain an identification and then the police

7

unnecessarily suggest that a certain suspect is guilty.

8

And that's because, as the State has said, the Court's

9

central concern in these cases is the State putting a

10

thumb on the scales, gaining an unfair advantage.

11

as, as Justice Scalia said, the State can't create a

12

false document and introduce it at trial, it can't

13

manipulate someone's memory and then use that evidence

14

to prove guilt at trial.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

15

Just

So, do you mean to say, Ms.

16

Saharsky, that there can never be a due process

17

violation from the admission of unreliable evidence?

18

Assuming that the State has not created that evidence,

19

has not produced that evidence, but the State knows that

20

the evidence is unreliable or has a very substantial

21

chance of being so, that that can never be a due process

22

violation?

23

MS. SAHARSKY:

I'm saying that's where the

24

Court's cases are now.

The State can't knowingly

25

introduce perjured testimony, but you're not talking
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

about perjured, knowingly perjured, testimony.

2

If the question is just unreliable, the

3

Court has said on numerous occasions -- it's rejected

4

claims like that and said the Constitution doesn't

5

protect to ensure all evidence is reliable.

6

a process by which the court can test reliability

7

through cross-examination, confrontation, et cetera.

8

The Court has -- and that was in Crawford.

9

It provides

The Court has also said -- and if I could

10

just add one more thing -- in the due process context,

11

that where the check comes in is in Jackson v. Virginia,

12

that the verdict has to have enough evidence to be

13

supported, each element of the crime, beyond a

14

reasonable doubt that a rational jury could find it.

15

So, that is a due process check.

16

But where the Court's cases stand today, the

17

Court has not found, so far as we can tell, a case where

18

it said that the mere introduction of unreliable

19

evidence would violate the Due Process Clause.

20

every time it's been confronted with a claim like that,

21

in Dowling, for example, in Colorado v. Connelly, the

22

Court has rejected such a claim.

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And

I'll give you an extreme

24

example.

The extreme example is where an identification

25

has been produced by torture, but the torture has been
43
Alderson Reporting Company

1

by a non-State actor.

2

Same answer?

MS. SAHARSKY:

That is an extreme example.

3

There are many reasons why (a) the prosecution would

4

never introduce that kind of evidence to begin with and

5

(b) that there would be other checks on the process in

6

addition to the confrontation and cross-examination

7

types of things that we talked about.

8
9

There would be a check on the process
through Brady and Giglio, for example, that if the

10

government knew that those were the circumstances of the

11

identification, they would have to turn that evidence

12

over to the other side.

13

terms of the trial process if the government actually

14

put on evidence like that.

15

unlikely that such a thing would happen.

There would also be checks in

23

MS. SAHARSKY:

Do you

Well, I mean you would need

24

to meet the standard of Rule 403, which is that the --

25

the probative value of the witness would be

2

it is unlikely that evidence would -- of an eyewitness,

which the Court has said, particularly in cases like

Biggers and Manson, is fairly probative, important

5

evidence; the Court wanted to let it in, even in the

6

circumstances of where you know, the police played a

7

role in manipulation.

8

wouldn't -- wouldn't take the evidence --

9

I think

So, probably, no, the Court

JUSTICE ALITO:

But you think in theory that

10

could be done?

11

in the case and this witness has made a hundred

12

inconsistent statements previously and has been

13

convicted of perjury, that the judge could just say you

14

can't put that witness on because that person is -- is a

15

liar, and I'm not going to have the witness testify in

17

So, if you put on a cooperating witness

Well, I mean, Rule 403 isn't

identification testimony.

5

special jury instructions that most States use, and New

6

Hampshire used special jury instructions here.

7

there's something that's really notable about these

8

instructions, which is that what Petitioner wants is,

9

when the jury has made a determination here, looking at

For example, there are

And

10

factors like how far was the witness away from the

person, how long was it before -- between the crime and

Petitioner wants is for a trial court -- this Court,

But this is very

It doesn't mean that the

17

I would just point the Court to the decision

18

in Dowling, which was about a prior conviction for which

19

the person had been acquitted; and then that evidence

20

was let in at his trial, and he said that's a problem.

21

That evidence is too unreliable and too prejudicial, and

22

the Court said that's not for the Due Process Clause.

23

The Constitution gives you the process to test evidence.

24

It doesn't ensure that all of the evidence that's going

be introduced be reliable.
