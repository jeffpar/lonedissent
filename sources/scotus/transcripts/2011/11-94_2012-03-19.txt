ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. PHILLIPS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
In its landmark decision in Apprendi, this

12

Court announced as a fundamental principle of Fifth and

13

Sixth Amendment jurisprudence that every fact necessary

14

to increase the punishment beyond that which is

15

otherwise maximally provided for must be presented to

16

the jury and must be decided by the jury beyond a

17

reasonable doubt.

18

In this particular case, the defendant was

19

fined a total of an $18 million penalty in the context

20

of a jury finding that there was a single day of

21

violation under the RCRA provision.

22

explicit that the maximum fine for a single day's

23

violation is $50,000.

24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Congress is quite

Was that jury trial

constitutionally required?

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. PHILLIPS:

Yes, I believe the jury trial

2

was constitutionally required, Justice Scalia.

The

3

cutoff between what's a petty offense not subject to

4

jury trial and what's beyond that -- I think you could

5

-- you could get there two ways.

6

Congress attaches a 5-year penalty to if it's against an

7

individual, which suggests that it is a very serious

8

crime.

9

interpretation of this would have been $38 million, even

This is a crime that

And the maximum fine under the district judge's

10

though the judge chose only to impose an $18 million

11

penalty under these circumstances.

12

seems to me clearly a serious offense.

13
14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So, either way, it

What have we said is the

standard for fines?

15

MR. PHILLIPS:

I'm sorry.

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What have we said with

17

reference to a jury trial when fines are involved?

18

it have to be a substantial fine or do we have a word

19

that we use?

20

MR. PHILLIPS:

Does

Well, you haven't used a word

21

-- I mean, the distinction is between a serious offense

22

and a petty offense, and the places where the -- you

23

know, you've drawn the line to conclude that a fine was

24

too small to be worried about was -- was $10,000 in the

25

Muniz case.

You recognized in Bagwell that 52 million

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

5
1

was way beyond what would be appropriate under those

2

circumstances.

3

But I think the Court benefits most if it

4

just focuses on the potential penalties that Congress

5

has adopted and use that as the guidepost, because if

6

Congress has said that this is something for which

7

someone could be punished --

8
9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, you have to do that

because you have to know whether -- whether to impanel a

10

jury before the -- before the jury comes in or before

11

the jury comes in with a penalty, right?

12

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right, absolutely.

13

asserted our right to a jury trial.

14

didn't contest our right to a jury trial.

15

actually read their brief --

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

And we

The government
And I don't

Do we assume for purposes of

17

this case that your client, a corporation, has a Sixth

18

Amendment right to a jury trial?

19

MR. PHILLIPS:

I think the language of the

20

Sixth Amendment couldn't be clearer, that it says in all

21

criminal prosecutions, the -- the accused is entitled to

22

a jury trial, and all -- and you know, Article III,

23

section 2, says in all jury trial -- in all criminal

24

prosecutions, there's a jury trial.

25

effort whatsoever to limit the -- the individual, or in

Alderson Reporting Company

So, there is no

Official

6
1

any way to -- the person or persons or entities that are

2

entitled to those rights.

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

What are the peers of the

4

Southern Union Company that would sit on the jury?

5

Other railroads?

6

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, that would have been --

7

we'd probably have had a different outcome if that had

8

been the case.

9

in that context is -- is derived from the citizenry in

But, no, Your Honor, obviously "peers"

10

the State or the district in which the prosecution is

11

brought.

12

peers in that sense, but -- but no one has ever doubted

13

that an ordinary jury would be a suitable jury of peers

14

for corporations, and, candidly, corporations are tried

15

all of the time, and no one has doubted it.

16

think it -- you know, first of all, it seems clear,

17

under the language of the Sixth Amendment and Article

18

III, that corporations are entitled to a jury and that

19

no one is -- in anything that's a serious offense, and

20

that clearly is what we have here.

I mean, obviously, we don't get corporate

And I don't

21

And so, what we've got is a decision by the

22

jury that there was at a -- at a single point in time a

23

violation of RCRA.

24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But it's not -- the jury

didn't say that the defendant was in violation only 1

2

many months, and it didn't say how many days.

3

4

just didn't focus on the number of days.

5

find they were in violation only 1 day, which is what

6

your opening statement was.

7

It said it was in violation within this span of

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

It didn't
It

But it didn't

But what the -- what

8

the First Circuit said, Justice Ginsburg, is that the --

9

the most you could read the jury to have found, because

10

it was not asked the question, the most you could read

11

out of it, was that there was a single day of a

12

violation, and that that then sets the maximum.

13
14

JUSTICE SCALIA:
must read out of it.

15
16

The most -- the most you

MR. PHILLIPS:

The most you must read out of

it.

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes.

You could -- you

18

could say it could have meant -- they could have thought

19

that they violated every day.

20

MR. PHILLIPS:

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Right.

You can't say that for

22

sure.

23

found that it violated it 1 day.

24
25

They could have.

But one thing you can say for sure is that they

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

That's correct,

Justice Scalia, and that, therefore, if you apply the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

8
1

core Apprendi doctrine in a principled way, as

2

Justice Kennedy suggested in a separate concurrence, if

3

you applied it in a principled way, you determine what

4

-- what facts are supported by the jury's findings and

5

how far does the penalty take it, and it goes to

6

$50,000, and anything beyond the $50,000, if it's found

7

by the judge, doesn't satisfy the Sixth or Fifth

8

Amendment under those circumstances.

9

That should be in my judgment the end of the

10

inquiry.

The First Circuit rejected that argument by

11

turning to Oregon v. Ice and suggesting that there was a

12

fundamental shift in how the Court applies the Apprendi

13

doctrine.

14

although you're clearly better positioned to determine

15

what you thought you meant by Ice than I am, my

16

interpretation of Ice is that it deals with the very

17

different situation of multiple offenses and the very

18

different problem of trying to extend the Apprendi

19

doctrine to the context of multiple convictions and then

20

adopted a methodology for applying it in those

21

circumstances that focus significantly on a particular

22

history of consecutive versus concurrent sentences --

And I -- I would suggest to you that,

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

24

MR. PHILLIPS:

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

I didn't think --- in that context.
I mean, I was -- I tend to

Alderson Reporting Company

be in dissent in these cases; so, I don't have the

2

authoritative view.

But the --

MR. PHILLIPS:

More so than I do, Your

Honor.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

6

MR. PHILLIPS:

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

What?
More so than I do.
Well, but no.

But the

8

impression I have is that -- that I had thought there

9

were what I'd call the elements of the offense, and then

10

there were sentencing facts.

11

been traditionally facts found by the judge when

12

imposing a sentence.

13

And sentencing facts have

Now, the majority of the Court in Apprendi

14

went back into the history and said there is no

15

significant old tradition, old enough, of -- of

16

sentencing facts.

17

sentence, that's like an element, and you should have a

18

jury trial.

19

So, really, when you raise the

Now, the argument here, one of them, that the

20

government stresses -- and Ice is the same -- is that

21

there is no -- the tradition's different where fines and

22

where multiple and concurrent sentences were at issue.

23

If you go back to the 18th century or

24

earlier, what you'll discover is that the judge has

25

always had a much greater role in deciding what the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

10
1

amount of a fine should be.

2

that amount rested upon some view of the facts as to the

3

manner in which the crime occurred -- and it always

4

does -- it was the judge who traditionally found it, not

5

the jury.

6

crime.

7

And, therefore, insofar as

So, those facts are not like elements of the

That's what I thought was essentially the

8

argument.

9

and Apprendi is on the other.

10

Ice and fines are on one side of that line,

MR. PHILLIPS:

I think the -- the problem

11

with that analysis, Justice Breyer, is I don't think the

12

history, first of all, is anywhere near as clear in this

13

context as it was, for instance, in Ice in terms of who

14

decided what.

15

suggests that judges had the authority to impose fines

16

beyond whatever the maximum statutory limit that was

17

provided for by the legislature involved.

18

and if you go through --

19

It is -- there is no history that

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, no.

And if you --

They're not doing

20

that here.

21

sentencing is how often this crime was committed.

22

one can go against the statutory limit, but rather it --

23

it allows a higher sentence when certain facts occur.

24
25

What they're deciding is a fact of
No

Now, I thought in Apprendi that the history
is just what I'm saying it was in -- in the fine case,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

11
1

but the majority says to the contrary.

2

seems, even if I was wrong in Apprendi, that at least

3

there's enough discretion here to say, look, this is

4

traditionally up to the judge.

5

that isn't so?

6

MR. PHILLIPS:

And so, here it

Now, why do you think

Because it never was

7

traditionally up to the judge to go beyond whatever the

8

maximum sentence provided was.

9

concurrence in Apprendi spends a significant amount of

Justice Thomas's

10

time with that history.

11

jury -- I mean fines and jury determinations and

12

consistently finds that the same rule applies in the

13

fine context as applies in the -- in the incarceration

14

context.

15

He several times references

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Phillips, do you think

16

that you could say that there was no going above the

17

statutory maximum here?

18

the judge had said, well, it's $500 a day, I'm going to

19

find some facts and fine you $600 a day, that would be

20

going above a statutory maximum.

21

In other words, you know, if

But I'm wondering whether this is different

22

because here the judge was sticking to the $500 a day

23

that was set out in the statute, and then the question

24

is more, you know, of an -- is it an element or is it a

25

-- is it a sentencing fact as to how many days the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

12
1

violation occurred?

2

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, Justice Kagan, I would

3

have thought, if anything, our case would be a much

4

easier one, because what you -- what you basically are

5

saying is that the district judge on the basis of a

6

non-reasonable doubt standard and without a jury is

7

making a determination that there have been 761

8

violations of Federal law and, on that basis, imposing a

9

sentence.

10

It would seem to me that, whatever else you

11

might want to say Apprendi should limit, it would be the

12

whole idea that the judge gets to determine every aspect

13

of all elements of the crime and the punishment that

14

attaches to it.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Was there an objection at

16

trial to the charge on the ground that it didn't

17

instruct the jury to find the number of days of

18

violation?

19

MR. PHILLIPS:

The United States didn't

20

object to that.

21

object to it either, and it wasn't an instruction that

22

was offered by either of the parties.

23

actually was the one who divined the instruction with

24

respect to a single --

25

No, Your Honor.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Actually, we didn't

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But this was in the

3

context where the entire defense of the corporation was

4

consistent with what the indictment said.

6

very strange under this evidence to think that it was

7

8

back.

9
10

It was

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, Justice Kennedy --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I think there's -- that's

11

just more a sense of background.

13

as if there were no evidence.

14

MR. PHILLIPS:

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I do think we have to

Right.
But I -- like Justice

16

Ginsburg, I was very surprised the government didn't

17

allege -- didn't stress waiver here.

18

an instruction?

19

MR. PHILLIPS:

You didn't submit

Well, the -- yes, we didn't

20

submit an instruction.

On the other hand, neither side

21

submitted the particular instruction that the judge

22

adopted in this particular case.

23

important is to put it in the context of the -- of the

24

evidence at trial and the way it was analyzed by the

25

First Circuit under the -- on the harmless error

But what I think is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

14
1

standard.

Remember that the issue here is not that they

2

simply have mercury in a particular location without a

3

permit.

4

it with an intent to recycle it at some point and to

5

make it a usable product?

The question was, did they -- were they holding

6

And there were three different points in

7

time when evidence clearly demonstrated an intent to

8

obtain an RFP to handle the product in precisely that

9

way, even up to the summer of 2004, and the indictment

10

only runs to October of 2004.

11

So, the notion that it could be a -- a

12

significantly shorter period, maybe not -- maybe not

13

just a day, ultimately, but clearly you can't -- we just

14

don't know because no one asked under those

15

circumstances.

16

viewed as harmless error, and I think that's not

17

challenged by the United States at this stage in the

18

litigation.

19

The First Circuit said this could not be

And so, it seems to me, as you say,

20

Justice Kennedy, you have to evaluate the pure issue

21

of -- you have 1 day of violation, that's the

22

determination, and when -- and to take the Apprendi

23

doctrine.

24
25

As it -- as it's stated, it's quite plain.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Phillips, can you

deal with one policy argument that your adversary raised

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

15
1

that gives me some pause?

And that is, the number of

2

days is certainly something that the jury here could --

3

relatively easily decided upon.

4

the evidence and figured that out --

5

MR. PHILLIPS:

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It could have looked at

Right.
-- okay?

But in fraud

7

cases, in securities cases, sometimes the identity of

8

victims is not determined for months, till months after

9

the conviction, and the amount of fine and/or

10

restitution is set at sentencing.

11
12

What's going to happen to all of those
statutes --

13

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well --

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- because -- or all of

15

those procedures that have been set up by Congress to

16

sort of set the amount of loss and repayment?

17

of those subject to the Apprendi rule?

18

MR. PHILLIPS:

Are all

I dont -- I don't think so.

19

I mean, the lower courts have been pretty consistent on

20

the question of restitution, that restitution is, one,

21

not a punishment within the meaning of Apprendi; and,

22

two, it's indeterminate.

23

the jury doesn't have to make that determination.

24
25

And as a consequence of that,

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, isn't -- aren't

fines indeterminate here by definition, going back to

Alderson Reporting Company

Justice Kagan's question?

2

much the fine could be here.

3

limit is set by the number of days, but why is it

4

different?

There's no upper limit to how

MR. PHILLIPS:

It's set -- the upper

Well, because it is set by

the --

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

8

MR. PHILLIPS:

9

Why is restitution --

Because it is set by the

number of days --

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

11

MR. PHILLIPS:

12

finding of how many days.

13

Well, so -- so --

-- which requires a predicate

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So, how about when a

14

fine is set by the value of the loss?

15

MR. PHILLIPS:

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

17
18

Well -That's no different than

restitution.
MR. PHILLIPS:

And the government will have

19

to figure out what it -- what it -- its best take as to

20

the value of the loss, and it's going to have to prove

21

that if that's going to be the basis on which to fine.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

My goodness, I think

23

there's lots of statutes that say something like this:

24

That within limits, if there's a particular --

25

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, if it's within limits,

Alderson Reporting Company

17

that's fundamentally different.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

3

because we assume -- right.

4

MR. PHILLIPS:

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, leave that out

Right.
It says, the fine, the

6

maximum fine is going to be "not more than the greater

7

of twice the gross gain or twice the gross loss."

8

MR. PHILLIPS:

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

Right.
Now, you're going to send

10

that to the jury.

11

phrase:

12

subsection would unduly complicate or prolong the

13

sentencing process."

14

Let me read you the next phase --

"unless imposition of a fine under this

I point to that next phrase to show you that

15

Congress understands, in an antitrust case, in a RICO

16

case, in a corruption case of different kinds, in an

17

environmental case, it is so complicated figuring out

18

that kinds of things that they excuse even the judge

19

who's experienced in this from dealing with that.

20

under your theory, as you just point out, if Apprendi

21

applies here, we're suddenly telling juries to -- they

22

have to under the Constitution administer that section

23

18 U.S.C. 3571, which I just read to you.

24
25

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

And

Well, Justice Breyer,

I mean, my first line of defense would be the comment by

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

18
1

this Court consistently that the jury trial right

2

doesn't necessarily make for the most efficient criminal

3

proceeding.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, I understand you could

5

say that's what the Constitution provides, and if you

6

jury can't handle it, well, too bad.

7

we're still in the business of trying to decide whether

8

the Constitution does provide that in the case of fines.

9

MR. PHILLIPS:

Okay.

But I think

Right, but I -- I would hope

10

that the Court wouldn't -- wouldn't let the tail wag the

11

dog in that particular context.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

Is that a tail?

Is that a

13

tail that the jury proceeding is itself so

14

unadministrable that even Congress says we recognize

15

even a judge couldn't do it?

16

MR. PHILLIPS:

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

18

MR. PHILLIPS:

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right?

My -Now, is that -Well, recognizing -Is that an irrelevant

20

consideration when you are trying to figure out whether

21

an ambiguous history requires the jury trial?

22

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, the ambiguous -- the

23

part of the history that is unambiguous is the

24

importance of the jury as a bulwark against the Federal

25

Government and against the judge.

So, they did both --

-- with respect to

fines and -MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

They had both, but

22

the one thing they didn't have is a situation where,

23

whatever the statutory maximum was, the judge was

24

permitted to go beyond the maximum based on findings

25

that the judge offered up on his part without the

benefit of a --

JUSTICE ALITO:

So, if the judge can -- if

3

it's totally up to the discretion of the judge, that's

4

fine; but if Congress enacts a statute that structures

5

the fine -- and says, if this is the case, then so much;

6

if that's the case, then so much more -- then you have

7

to have a jury trial?

8

MR. PHILLIPS:

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

Absolutely.

MR. PHILLIPS:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What sense does that make?

Apprendi said?

If --

Because you can take -Isn't that precisely what

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, that was the easy

answer.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. PHILLIPS:

Yes.

But, more fundamentally, and

18

it's -- and it's demonstrated in a case just like this

19

one --

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

That may be what Apprendi

21

said, but is it consistent with the original meaning of

22

the jury trial right in the Sixth Amendment?

23

statutes give me pause on that score.

24

MR. PHILLIPS:

25

These

Well, because -- but these

statutes don't speak to what Apprendi was talking about,

None of the statutes that
All -- and

Once you

And let me say it in this context.

Here's a

10

situation where the government proves up its case in the

11

context of a $50,000 fine; and that's what the jury is

12

asked to decide, and it decides that; and then the judge

13

gets to say:

14

If that's not the tail wagging the dog within the

15

meaning of even the cases that preceded Apprendi, it

16

seems to me there's a fundamental flaw in that

17

particular scheme.

18

Okay, $38 million is now the right number.

The history between fines and incarceration

19

are essentially the same.

20

Apprendi should be followed exactly under these

21

circumstances.

22

recognition that multiple offenses are fundamentally

23

different from a single offense.

judgment of the court of appeals should be reversed.

What the Court said in

What do you make of this

old case that the Government cites, U.S. v. Tyler?

2

it was the question of -- the penalty was four times the

3

value of the goods, and this Court said the judge, not

4

the jury, is responsible for imposing the fine and,

5

therefore, also for determining the value of the goods.

6

MR. PHILLIPS:

Yes.

And

Tyler is in -- in many

7

ways kind of imponderable.

The one thing that's clear,

8

it's not a Sixth Amendment decision.

9

argued.

It wasn't actually

All it says is that under this law -- and the

10

problem, obviously, in this case was they found -- you

11

know, it was -- the pounds weren't -- weren't the

12

problem.

13

one substance in the indictment, and the jury found

14

another substance in its verdict; and so, there was the

15

disconnect there, and the Court basically said we're not

16

going to worry about that trifling under these

17

circumstances.

18

The problem was obviously they had identified

What it doesn't say remotely is that the

19

Sixth -- is that -- you know, that the Sixth Amendment

20

would permit the judge to make that finding under those

circumstances.

Could the government do it by the indictment?

But that's not before

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right, Your Honor.

That's

correct, Your Honor.

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

How, in general -- I mean,

21

in the individual case, very often a trial doesn't come

22

up because 90 percent or more of the time it's just a

23

question of a plea bargain; and, therefore, the

24

defendant doesn't -- this is an added weapon for him,

25

Apprendi.

But in your -- with your clients and the others,

Alderson Reporting Company

24
1

there might be quite a lot of trials.

2

So, how in a trial does your client or

3

others in that position defend on the ground of we

4

didn't do this at all; but by the way, in case you

5

decide to the contrary, jury, we want to tell you we

only did it Monday, Wednesday, and Friday?

JUSTICE BREYER:

work?

How is that supposed to

Do you have two juries?

10

MR. PHILLIPS:

No.

Well, I mean, look, if

11

we think we're going to be prejudiced as a consequence

12

of trying this in a particular way, it will be our call

13

whether or not to waive the jury trial right under those

14

circumstances.

15

this particular case, obviously our position was we

16

didn't form the intent at any point in time and -- but,

17

you know, if ultimately the -- the jury had found that

18

there was some other point in time, then, you know,

19

we'll deal with that issue as we deal with it.

20

But, more fundamentally, at least in

But it wouldn't have been -- I don't think

21

the trial in this case would have been significantly

22

different.

23

different is that the jury would have been properly

24

instructed and our jury trial right would have been

25

preserved.

The only thing that would have been

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

9
10

MR. DREEBEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

This case, like Oregon v. Ice, involves the

12

kind of finding that the common law never entrusted to

13

the jury.

14

encroachment on the jury function by assigning the

15

function of determining the days of violation to the

16

court for the purpose of determining the criminal fine.

17
18
19

There is, therefore, no erosion or

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You agree, don't

you, that the statement in Oregon v. Ice was pure dicta?
MR. DREEBEN:

The Court's statement in Ice

20

-- that if a purely algebraic application of Apprendi

21

were followed, it would sweep in things such as fines

22

and restitution -- was not necessary to the judgment,

23

Mr. Chief Justice, but it was part of the Court's

24

rationale in adopting a different take on the meaning of

25

the Apprendi line of cases than had previously been

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

26
1

espoused.

2

Up until -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Dreeben, I think the

3

reference -- it was a fleeting reference to fines, and

4

it could have meant that the judge has discretion to set

5

the fine up to the maximum in the statute.

6

possible meaning.

7

MR. DREEBEN:

That's one

That is true, Justice

8

Ginsburg.

9

Ice was citing to an amicus brief filed by States, which

10

supplied illustrations of fine statutes that it believed

11

would be imperiled by a purely programmatic rule-based

12

application of Apprendi.

13

But I think that the author of the opinion in

And two of the State statutes that were

14

cited in that amicus brief, that of New Jersey and

15

Alaska, involved the kind of gain or loss statute that

16

has been discussed this morning, in which the judge,

17

following the rendition of a guilty verdict, determined

18

the amount of gain or loss and then applied either a

19

double or triple amount as the maximum fine.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

This was -- you're not

21

arguing that this rule will apply only to fines against

22

corporations?

23

right?

It would also apply to individuals,

24

MR. DREEBEN:

Correct, Justice Scalia.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's up to the judge to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

27
1

decide how many days or what the value was and so forth.

2

Right?

3

MR. DREEBEN:

Yes, Justice Scalia.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So, the right to trial by

5

jury to have that very important fact found does not

6

exist, even for individuals?

7

MR. DREEBEN:

Justice Scalia, the tradition

8

with respect to monetary fines is different than the

9

tradition that the Court analyzed in Apprendi.

With

10

respect to fines, restitution, and forfeiture, the jury

11

was never given a substantive role at common law.

12

the law today is with respect to forfeiture --

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And

I'm not sure how you can

14

fully make that argument, because I thought the history

15

was set forth fairly clearly in Apprendi that the early

16

history was that nothing was given to the jury with

17

respect to imprisonment or fines because most if not all

18

sentences were indeterminate.

19

began, and the Federal government, to experiment with

20

determinate sentences that the Apprendi issue then

21

became live.

22

MR. DREEBEN:

It's only when States

Justice Sotomayor, I think

23

what Apprendi relied on primarily was the linkage

24

between charge and penalty in English law, which was,

25

for felonies, death.

The Court distinguished in a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

28
1

footnote the tradition with respect to misdemeanors,

2

which it acknowledged was judicial discretion with

3

respect to fines and whippings, and it did not rely on

4

that history in fashioning the Apprendi rule.

5

What it relied on were two things:

First,

6

the traditional linkage between charge and authorized

7

penalty in English common law; and, second, the

8

tradition in America that when the legislature had put a

9

cap on the amount of the penalty, the judge had

10

discretion within it not to go above it.

11

But neither of those aspects of Apprendi

12

addressed the issue that's before the Court today, which

13

is whether it would be an expansion beyond the domain

14

that was covered in Apprendi to apply it to monetary

15

penalties in --

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So, explain to me, other

17

than your reliance on Ice, some sort of tradition,

18

which, you know, we can debate whether you can draw any

19

conclusion from tradition in any of these areas, whether

20

it's imprisonment or fines.

21

Tell me on the logic of Apprendi, not using

22

Ice, why fines are different, without relying on

23

history, which to me is -- I view it as ambiguous.

24

Okay?

25

MR. DREEBEN:

It's difficult to do that,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

29
1

Justice Sotomayor, because the Court fashioned the

2

Apprendi rule from history, and it limited it based on

3

history in Ice.

4

simply applies automatic --

5

It doesn't operate as an algorithm that

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I thought it was a fairly

6

simple algorithm.

7

if a judge's factfinding can increase the statutory

8

penalty, then that's a violation of the Sixth Amendment.

9

A jury has to find any fact that increases the statutory

10
11

It says if the statutory penalty --

maximum.
MR. DREEBEN:

Yes, and that -- that was the

12

argument of the Ice dissenters, that Apprendi states a

13

rule that knows no exceptions for history or the impact

14

on the States.

15

shows where the high-water mark of Apprendi was.

16

high-water mark was with respect to the penalty of

17

imprisonment.

18

And Ice does represent I think a --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The

So, outside of a -- a --

19

imprisonment, there is no other penalty that Congress

20

could fashion because it has no history that wouldn't be

21

within the purview of the judge?

22

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, of course, the death

23

penalty in Ring v. Arizona.

The Court held that facts

24

that expose a defendant to the death penalty must be

25

found by the jury.

So, the Court has extended Apprendi

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

30
1

to those core liberty areas.

2

the implications for the length of imprisonment, the

3

quantum of punishment that a defendant faces when he's

4

convicted of multiple offenses, this Court in Ice looked

5

to history and the impact on the administration of

6

justice before being willing to extend Apprendi outside

7

of its core domain.

8
9

But even with respect to

And I think it's highly relevant --

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But, Mr. Dreeben, wasn't the

core domain defined by whether it related to a specific

10

statutory offense?

11

legislative attempt to remove from the province of the

12

jury the determination of facts that warrant a

13

punishment for a specific statutory offense."

14

that not relevant precisely in this context?

15
16

MR. DREEBEN:

How is

Well, it is, of course,

relevant, Justice Kagan, but --

17
18

So, Ice says the core concern is "a

JUSTICE KAGAN:
this context?

19

How does it not determine

I mean, those --

MR. DREEBEN:

Because the Court went on

20

several paragraphs later in its opinion to describe what

21

it would mean to adopt a formulaic application of

22

Apprendi, treating it just as a rule divorced from

23

history.

24

considered was the impact it would have on sentencing

25

accoutrements, two of which are directly related to this

And one of the consequences that the Court

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

31
1

case because they are financial penalties, fines and

2

restitution.

3

Now, I've talked about how the amicus brief

4

that prompted that paragraph, the concern about the

5

implications of expanding Apprendi, referred to fine

6

statutes that operate on a gain or loss basis, which

7

necessarily requires judicial factfinding after the

8

guilty verdict comes in.

9

But if the Court isn't satisfied with those,

10

restitution which is explicitly mentioned in Apprendi --

11

excuse me -- in Ice, classically operates based on

12

findings about victim loss that occur after the guilty

13

verdict has come in.

14

oftentimes courts have to postpone sentencing in order

15

to allow the victim to gather evidence and to present

16

it.

17

This Court is well familiar that

Now, the Court could, I suppose, do as the

18

lower courts have done and say restitution is different

19

because it's designed simply to compensate for loss;

20

and, therefore, it's in one sense remedial.

21

will have to deal with the fact that in cases like

22

Pasquantino v. United States and Pennsylvania v.

23

Davenport, the Court has described restitution as a

24

criminal penalty.

25

But that

Now, the other way in which lower courts

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

32
1

have said that restitution isn't swept up by Apprendi is

2

to say it's a rule that has no maximum.

3

amount of harm to the victim is, that can be compensated

4

through restitution.

5

Whatever the

But, again, if one is applying an algebraic

6

understanding of the relevant statutory maximum from the

7

Blakely decision, restitution would be hard to justify

8

because the jury verdict does not contain findings about

9

harm to victims.

The jury verdict finds guilt.

10

Afterwards, the judge finds an additional fact, namely

11

the amount of harm, and imposes restitution.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And --

It's kind of odd,

13

though, isn't it?

I mean, to some extent, this is a

14

little easier case for you, because it does involve a

15

corporation.

16

imprisonment and the amount of a fine can both increase

17

based on a particular fact.

But there are statutes where the amount of

18

MR. DREEBEN:

Yes.

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And under your

20

submission, if you have -- you know, say a defendant who

21

is subject to 1 year, and that if a particular fact is

22

found, he's subject to 2 years, a fine of 20 but then

23

40, the judge would be constitutionally prohibited from

24

increasing the prison sentence but would be perfectly

25

free to increase the fine --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

33
1

MR. DREEBEN:

Probably --

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

-- including in a

3

situation where the fine might be a lot more serious

4

than the -- the time in prison.

5

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, probably,

6

Mr. Chief Justice, such a statute would be construed to

7

make that fact one for the jury, since it dictates

8

imprisonment increases as well as fine increases.

9

so, the constitutional question is unlikely to arise.

10

Congress would have been deemed to have intended that

11

that kind of a fact go to the jury.

And

12

That's not what -- the case in this statute.

13

This statute provides a 5-year maximum penalty, and then

14

it provides a fine amount that's graduated to the days

15

of the violation.

The violation in this case was one

16

single violation.

The judge did not find that there

17

were multiple violations; the judge simply looked at the

18

record, and his task is to decide how long did that

19

violation --

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Sure, he operated --

21

he operated in a reasonable way.

But we give juries the

22

discretion to be unreasonable.

23

often compromise.

24

verdict told the jury you can find the defendant, you

25

know, guilty for 1 day or whatever it is -- the 30

It would not -- juries

So, if the instructions and the

million; 50,000 or 30 million -- it would not be at all

2

unusual for the jury to debate and say, well, let's find

3

him guilty for 10 million.

4

MR. DREEBEN:

We do presume --

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And return that

6

verdict.

7

that the jury is not, and that's sort of -- that's part

8

of the protection the Sixth Amendment provided.

9

The judge is constrained by reason in a way

MR. DREEBEN:

This Court has never

10

recognized jury nullification as a constitutionally

11

protected right.

12

presume that if the jury is confronted with the evidence

13

and the law as given to it by the court, it will apply

14

that law in a rational manner.

15

whether that is something that the jury is

16

constitutionally entitled to do.

17

We presume a rational jury.

We

And the question here is

Now, coming back to the historical

18

foundations of the Apprendi rule and the extension

19

that's requested here, with all due respect to

20

Petitioner, I think United States v. Tyler is much more

21

significant than Petitioner gives it credit for.

22

This is a case decided in 1812 on a Court

23

that had on it Chief Justice Marshall and Justice Story.

24

These were people who were well steeped in common law

25

traditions and well familiar with how judges would find

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

35

facts at the time of the founding.

2

was a charge that the defendant had unlawfully exported,

3

in violation of an embargo law, an amount of pearl ashes

4

that were worth $600.

5

verdict that said we find that the defendant unlawfully

6

exported pot ashes worth $280.

7

Could a verdict be imposed on this, and could the judge

8

set the fine?

9

And in Tyler, there

And the jury came back with a

And the question is:

The two judges on the circuit court

10

disagreed, and so it was certified to the Supreme Court.

11

And this Court held unanimously that finding a valuation

12

was a judge function, not a jury function.

13

was necessary in order for the court to impose the

14

proper fine.

15

No valuation

And it's difficult to understand how this

16

Court could have said that, if there were such a

17

well-settled constitutionally protected entitlement to a

18

jury verdict on facts that dictated a fine, if indeed

19

this statute assigned the role to the judge and the

20

Court was fully comfortable with that role being carried

21

out.

22

And Tyler is a decision of this Court.

23

There is no decision of this Court with respect to

24

imprisonment that is anything like Tyler.

25

traditions with respect to imprisonment would surely be

The

fines.

3

forfeiture as a package of possible financial penalties

4

and asks the question, did the Framers envision that

5

these matters would be within the jury's domain as

6

opposed to the judge's in imposing the appropriate

7

sentence after a jury verdict, I think that the answer

8

is they would not have viewed it as a matter protected

9

by the Sixth Amendment, because there was no factual

And when one looks at fines, restitution, and

10

predicate in the common Law that would have led them to

11

believe the jury's function would be eroded if those

12

matters were not.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

A very -- very

14

simple matter for the government to ask for jury

15

findings on the questions at issue in this case, right?

16

MR. DREEBEN:

We could have done it here,

17

Mr. Chief Justice.

The broader concern is cases that

18

involve gain or loss, in which the question of how much

19

loss may have been suffered by hundreds or even

20

thousands of victims of fraud is typically not

21

undertaken -- the process of quantifying them isn't done

22

until the guilty verdict is in because it's an

23

enormously difficult and complicated task.

24

Justice Breyer pointed out, the judge isn't even

25

required to do it at sentencing if it proves to be too

Alderson Reporting Company

As

Official

37
1

complicated.

2

And for jury trials to do it, there may well

3

be a need for bifurcation.

4

Oregon v. Ice declined to impose on the States the need

5

to bifurcate trials to determine whether a sentence

6

should be run consecutively or concurrently, because

7

that would intrude upon a valuable reform that was

8

designed to provide some restraints on judicial

9

discretion.

10

And this Court in

The same kind of thing would operate here if

11

this Court adopts an across-the-board rule that fines

12

have to be proved to a jury.

13

restitution and to forfeiture, that would involve

14

overruling the Court's decision in Libretti v. United

15

States, which held that forfeiture is a sentencing

16

function.

17

mathematically, geometrically accurate application of

18

the rule stated in Apprendi, it's difficult to see why

19

forfeiture is not something that has to be --

But upon a strict application of Apprendi, a

MR. DREEBEN:

Quite so.

And this is in our brief.

And

12

he -- he interpreted Tyler and said the court would not

13

have given the direction that it did, that a judgment

14

could be entered based on the fine amount, unless they

15

were satisfied that an indictment lay and that the fine

16

was to be imposed by the court and not found by the jury

Did it -- as a matter of

statutory construction, right?

12

Well, the -- again, I would

Amendment does not appear --

Tyler, but it's difficult for me to understand that a

20

common law operated would have adopted an interpretation

21

of a statute that was facially unconstitutional.

3

MR. DREEBEN:

No.

I -- they didn't have the

4

benefit of having read Apprendi in order to render their

5

decision.

6

was certified up to them.

They -- they were deciding the question that

7

My submission is that they wouldn't have

8

decided the case that way if they thought, based on

9

their familiarity with the common law, that fines were

10

the kind of thing that had to go to a jury.

11
12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Might have helped if they

had argument, right?

13

MR. DREEBEN:

I think they felt they did not

14

need it, because the matter was sufficiently obvious

15

that all members of the Court could agree on it.

What about all of the

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Was it an argued case, at

least?

7

MR. DREEBEN:

Justice Scalia, I'd have to go

MR. DREEBEN:

And I don't disagree with you

on that point, Justice Sotomayor; but I think that there

is one fact that truly stands out about fines, and that

4

is they were historically at common law products of

5

judicial discretion.

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

7

MR. DREEBEN:

But so was imprisonment.

Imprisonment was rare.

8

Imprisonment was hardly ever imposed in the early

9

colonies and in England, because --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, how many statutes

had anything but indeterminate fine structures?

12

MR. DREEBEN:

I -- I'm sorry.

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How many statutes in the

14

early common law had anything but indeterminate fine

statutes?

MR. DREEBEN:

A few did.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. DREEBEN:

Unless compelled to do --

Well, none of those statutes

assigned the role of finding fines to juries.

There may

10

be an example or two that one could find if you dig

11

through the mass of colonial records, but the dominant

12

trend, and it was acknowledged by Blackstone, was that

13

the common law never assigned the responsibility of

14

fines to the jury, and statutes did so rarely.

15

Imprisonment simply doesn't help very much in this area,

16

because the resources required to imprison just didn't

17

exist, and imprisonment really is a product that

18

developed in the late --

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well,

it's getting stronger.

11

MR. DREEBEN:

Yes.

We have Hope -- Hope in

12

1845, which cites back to Smith and relied on it, and

13

then there is an -- an arson case called Ritchey from

14

Indiana in which the court did seem to think that in

15

order to sustain a proper prosecution where the fine

16

amount varied based on the destruction of the property,

17

the jury had to find the amount of the property

18

valuation.

19

But this is 1845.

It's not something that

20

would have been present to the mind of the Framers.

It

21

doesn't indicate clearly what the source of law is,

22

whether it's a common law tradition, whether it's

23

following something like Smith.

24

also best understood as a larceny case, and there was

25

more of an established tradition that in larceny cases,

Smith itself I think is

Alderson Reporting Company

45

the value of the property taken was relevant to the

2

jury's findings because it made the difference between a

3

capital offense -- a capital offense that could be given

4

with benefit of clergy, which was basically a way for

5

the English judges to mitigate a death-eligible crime to

6

a non-death penalty, or petty larceny, which was

7

punished by fines and whipping.

8

offense in a way that, for example, the fine penalty at

9

issue in this case does not.

10

So, it graded the

Petitioner is guilty of a felony by virtue

11

of the jury verdict.

That imposes the stigma of being a

12

felon on Petitioner.

The judge's role is then to decide

13

what was charged in the indictment and what was the

14

length of that violation, not to find Petitioner guilty

15

of numerous additional violations.

What if the judge disagreed

MR. DREEBEN:

The jury's acquittal would end

the criminal case.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, no, no, no.

The jury

21

finds a violation, but the judge thinks the jury got it

wrong.

MR. DREEBEN:

pick the -- the number of days?

MR. DREEBEN:

that the evidence is insufficient under Jackson v.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, he finds, you know,

Then I think that he would be

another provision of Federal law, 3573(c), which

10

provides in the case of an organization that a felony

there would be other limits applicable in Federal law

MR. DREEBEN:

It's only a problem,

11

Justice Scalia, if the Sixth Amendment protects a

12

defendant's right to it.

13

as framed in Ice, is whether the legislative innovation,

14

the reform aimed to structure the discretion of a court

15

which at the Founding era might have been impose

16

whatever fine you like with no limits whatsoever, except

17

the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment --

18

Congress has come along, as have the State legislatures,

19

and sought to structure the deliberations with respect

20

to financial penalties.

21

And the question that was --

Fines, restitution, and forfeiture are now

22

structured in a way that basically sends the decision to

preponderance in the case of forfeiture amounts that --

With respect to jury trials, a petty offense which is

MR. PHILLIPS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

Hopefully, I'll be able to give you back a
couple of those minutes.
I'd like to -- I'd like to start with what

6

seems to me ultimately the fundamental notion of the

7

United States' position, which is that there is a vast

8

gulf somehow between fines and imprisonment.

9

seems to me very difficult within the constitutional

And it

10

structure to embrace that approach when, obviously,

11

property interests are protected in the Fifth Amendment;

12

they're protected in the Eighth Amendment.

13

go back to Blackstone, where he talks about inflicting

14

corporal punishment or a stated imprisonment of a term,

15

which is better than an excessive fine, for that amounts

16

to imprisonment for life, there's the recognition

17

historically that fines have an enormous impact on

18

individuals and, of course, are entitled to fundamental

19

constitutional protections.

20

table and it's completely open season on defendants

under those circumstances is unjustifiable.

think -- I read Justice Thomas's concurrence and the
