CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

this morning in Case 11-161, Armour v. City of

5

Indianapolis.

Mr. Stancil.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK T. STANCIL

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

MR. STANCIL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The city chose a method for abandoning its

12

sewer funding mechanism that left Petitioners paying 30

13

times more than their next-door neighbors to connect to

14

their neighborhood sewer project simply because

15

Petitioners had paid their tax bills in full.

16

Mere timing of payment does not render

17

similarly situated taxpayers into separate groups.

18

that is particularly true here where the taxpayers are a

19

discretely defined group of homeowners sharing equally

20

in a common specific benefit and State law explicitly

21

defines them as similarly situated.

22

And

The city's principal contention is that

23

jettisoning the Barrett Law, the way they funded the

24

initial taxation, was itself an end for this

25

justification and itself justified the gross disparity
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

imposed on Petitioner -- on Petitioners.

2

The fact that an arbitrary classification may yield a

3

desirable result does not render it any less arbitrary.

4

The city must have a reason for drawing the distinction,

5

but paying one's taxes in good faith does not eliminate

6

a taxpayer's right to equal treatment.

7

That does not.

Indeed, State law here makes clear that

8

delaying payment by choosing an installment plan does

9

not put a taxpayer on special footing.

For example, the

10

Barrett Law declares that installment payments, quote,

11

"shall be collected in the same manner as other taxes."

12

And installment payments are automatically secured by a

13

lien against the property.

14

Taxpayers who select the installment plan,

15

which they may do for any reason or no reason

16

whatsoever -- and, in fact, if they make no choice, they

17

default into the installment plan.

18

if the city asks as it did here, to sign an agreement,

19

agreeing to pay the installments in full with interest

20

and not to contest the validity of the underlying

21

assessment.

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

They are required,

Counsel, I understand

23

your arguments.

Your adversary raises a point that

24

concerns me, which is what happens to all other amnesty

25

programs like parking ticket amnesties?
4
Alderson Reporting Company

And if you take

Official

1

your logic to an extreme, how about something that

2

doesn't involve money but immigration status amnesty,

3

illegal aliens who can apply for citizenship and be

4

forgiven their illegal entry?

5

Doesn't the logic of your theory basically

6

mean that there are no circumstances in which the

7

government could treat people differently?

No, Your Honor, for several

10

and rational basis cases in particular make clear that

11

context is key.

13

parking ticket is a qualitatively different judgment

14

than forgiving the underlying tax liability of a broad

swath of -­

So, forgiving a penalty imposed on a

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

officer stops me for a traffic violation, I get angry

18

when he lets somebody else go.

19

that there is a difference between that and this case

20

where the government is basically saying you owe me

21

something and I'm going to forgive you what you owe me?

22

MR. STANCIL:

So, you're suggesting

Yes, Your Honor.

The Chief

23

Justice's opinion in Engquist took that specific example

24

on, not with you in mind presumably, but took that

25

example on specifically, and it said:

of action itself that is inherently a subjective

individualized determination.

4

that's the nature of -- of the enforcement action.

5

is qualitatively different from a tax imposed on 181

6

homeowners who live next door to each other, and then

7

12 months later saying, you know, 31 of you are going to

8

pay 30 times as much in reality as the other 150, even

14

to refund all the money, everybody who, in fact, ever

15

paid a Barrett Law assessment?

17

MR. STANCIL:

No, Your Honor, and State law

on this is quite clear.

I don't care what the State

is; I'm saying a matter of constitutional law.

Well, constitutional law looks

the people to whom you're guaranteed -- with whom you're

this law.

It isn't that you're

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why can the State, when

they have, let's say, 10,000 people who have already

paid their assessments -- well, why doesn't it have to

give them back their money, on your theory?

That's my

Because they're not similarly

Because -­
JUSTICE BREYER:
MR. STANCIL:

Why aren't they?
Because your -- the States

16

have flexibility to define at the outset who is

17

similarly situated.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

Fine.

They define

19

here who is similarly situated, and the people who

20

aren't are the ones who are on the installment plan.

21
22
23

MR. STANCIL:

No, Your Honor, but they still

have to have a basis for saying that.
JUSTICE BREYER:

They do.

They don't -­
They do.

The

24

reason is because they think it's unfair to give the

25

people -- they think it's -- they don't want to bother

collecting it from these people who haven't paid yet.

2

Okay?

3

so, if we're going to free them, we don't want to go

4

back into history and then suddenly give back all the

5

people who've ever paid their assessment.

That's why.

Which is the line you want to draw.

My point is that what's less rational

4

to decide in this case -- and this is brought as an

as-applied challenge by -- by these homeowners -- is:

Are these people who are promised you will pay the very

and there's a judgment -- there was a judgment in the

14

court of first instance and the appellate court for a

the same way.

18

How -- how do you separate a gross disparity from a

non-gross disparity?

MR. STANCIL:

Well, start with this case,

21

which is easy.

It's 10 to 1 and 30 to 1.

number as in Allegheny Pittsburgh.

4 to 1 or 5 to 1 as a line, as the Court has done, say,

limits, that -- I think those are easy lines to draw and

I don't think so, Your Honor.

6

I think triggering -- the gross disparity triggers the

7

violation.

8

for a violation?

9

for saying we're going to -- it would be the very

14

they would have to give us that -- that figure.

15

And, Your Honor, if I could, I'd like to get

16

back, Justice Ginsburg, to your question about how these

17

other projects -- there's a suggestion by Respondents

18

that there's a terrible line-drawing problem in how do

19

we calculate these benefits.

20

We have this Federal class action in the Cox case, which

21

is every other Barrett Law project that's active except

22

ours.

23

It's simply not the case.

We opted out.
The damages question was before that court,

24

because -- because the court ruled in favor of the

25

position that this is an equal protection violation.

What's your answer?

MR. STANCIL:

Two reasons.

What is your

One, you were

23

not promised equal treatment under State law to those

other projects; you were promised equal treatment with

25

the people you live next door.

Two, you use a different

These pipes cost different amounts of money to

Your Honor's hypothetical -- actually, if I

could tweak it a little bit, it -- the question is not

5

who comes in for somebody -- who comes in from a project

So, it's

You see, the problem

16

that I have is that you're trying to lop off half of the

17

project, which is what was the Barrett project, without

18

looking at what the new project is.

19

what Justice Breyer's point was.

20

old project and every new project is going to pay more

21

money than they did under the Barrett Law because I

22

think, if I understand correctly, the city is raising

23

a -- essentially not a flat fee, but a fee, assessing a

24

flat fee across all taxpayers so that these sewer lines

25

can be built.

And that goes to

Moving forward, every

13
Alderson Reporting Company

1

Am I correct about that?

2

MR. STANCIL:

No, Your Honor.

For future

3

sewer projects that they start, each person who connects

4

to that new pipe pays a $2,500 flat fee.

5

citywide who uses the municipal sewer -- new, old, or

6

whatever -- pays an extra about $10 a month under the

7

new system.

8

program, the Barrett Law, is politically very unpopular;

9

we would like to get rid of it.

So, what they did is they decided this

10

chose a way to do it.

11

completely ignorant of -- of the effects.

And so, why can't they

21

You're treating me differently.

MR. STANCIL:

There's -- there's nobody who

fees that now every Indiana resident pays.

In the

payment is a qualitatively different -- to borrow from

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

16

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

17
18

MR. CLEMENT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

19

In 2005, the City of -- the City of

20

Indianapolis decided that it wanted to abandon its

21

reliance on the Barrett Law, a program that had proved

22

unpopular for financing public improvements.

23

so, they decided to make a clean break and forgive the

24

outstanding balances that were due under the Barrett Law

25

program.

In doing

The alternative of maintaining those accounts
29
Alderson Reporting Company

and maintaining the tax liens associated with those

2

accounts for nearly three decades was particularly

3

unattractive.

4

Now, the -­

JUSTICE ALITO:

I think you've put your

5

finger on the reason for this, which is that the city

6

calculated that what it did would be more politically

7

acceptable than treating the people who paid up front

8

equally on an economic basis with the people who paid in

9

installment plans.

10

Now, if that's the reason for this,

is that rational?

11

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Alito, it -- it

12

might well be rational.

13

make policy sense that the public likes also make good

14

government sense.

15

to do is they wanted to get out of the Barrett Law

16

business.

17
18

I mean, sometimes things that

And in this context, what they wanted

That's the exact words -­
JUSTICE ALITO:

But what does that mean,

they wanted to get out of the Barrett Law business?

19

MR. CLEMENT:

Can I put it very concretely?

20

I mean, before this -- you know, when they used to have

21

the Barrett Law and used it on an ongoing basis, within

22

the controller's office, they had a Barrett Law office.

23

They wanted to get rid of the Barrett Law office.

24

How do you get rid of the Barrett Law

25

office?

You get of the obligation to continue to
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

collect these payments for 30 years; you get rid of the

2

obligations to keep all these files together and see

3

whether you're in a position to enforce a tax lien.

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

That really doesn't seem

5

very complicated, to collect payments that people have

6

agreed to pay.

7

anymore, I bet they could have contracted that out for a

8

very modest fee to any number of private entities that

9

would have done it for them.

10

And if they didn't want to do it

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Alito, of

11

course, they could have continued to collect.

12

that's common ground here, which I think ultimately

13

shows why this is a very curious equal protection

14

theory, because if the city would have continued to

15

collect these, you know, for 30 years, then they agree,

16

there's no Equal Protection Clause problem at all.

17

I think

Now, I think as Justice Kagan was

18

suggesting, if you now create a rule that says when they

19

do forgive, they actually have to provide refunds and

20

face Equal Protection Clause violations, then in the

21

future, nobody is going to ever forgive.

22

going to do in the future is, even though they're trying

23

to move away from this policy, even though they're

24

trying to get out of the Barrett Law business, they're

25

going to be stuck.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

prevail in this opinion, we should say the principle we

3

are adopting in this case is:

4

government.

5

MR. CLEMENT:

Don't trust the

No, Justice Kennedy, I don't

6

think that's right.

But the fact that that's your

7

reaction I think shows that this is not really an equal

8

protection claim, and it's not really like Allegheny

9

Pittsburgh because, as your colloquy with Mr. Stancil

10

suggested, they would admit that if the government said,

11

as part of the Barrett Law, look, you know, we reserve

12

the right to abandon the Barrett Law, and if we do so,

13

we -- you know, we may forgive installment payments -­

14

if they said that, the equal protection claim would go

15

away in their view.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, that's simply

17

because, as we said in Allegheny Pittsburgh, the basis

18

for considering the equal protection claim is the rights

19

that you're given under State law.

20

Pittsburgh, it says you have the right to be treated

21

equally with respect to assessments.

In Allegheny

And you weren't.

22

Here the law says you have the right to be

23

treated equally, or whatever it is, the apportionment,

24

and they weren't.

25

State law gets to set the base.

All that you're saying there is that
And if the State law

32
Alderson Reporting Company

1

says we don't treat people the same in extending sewer

2

hook-ups, then that takes away your Equal Protection

3

Clause.

But it just sets the base.

MR. CLEMENT:

Two differences,

5

Mr. Chief Justice.

6

no -- there's no real analogue to Allegheny Pittsburgh

the law of West Virginia, that it couldn't do so.

would eliminate all litigation on Equal Protection

That's -- the classic case is -- is the sex

The

But there's an

Then you're saying that the

13

difference between the two classes is that if you

14

continue to have the tax apply to the people who haven't

15

paid it yet, there is a large administrative expense.

16

And if you -- as an expense that does not exist in

respect to the class that has already paid it.

18

So, the question, I would have thought, in

19

our Court is whether that's a rational distinction.

20

I think contrary to what was suggested, administrative

21

expenses, of course, make a difference where the Equal

22

Protection Clause is concerned because they

23

differentiate between the two classes.

avoid an administrative expense is a rational reason,

Carmichael v. Southern Coal where, you know, this Court

we're not going to tax employers -- employers who are

11

smaller than eight, because, you know, the game is not

worth the candle.

provision that says you shall collect.

take a look at an old Indiana case called Allendorf, 176

When they transport Allegheny Pittsburgh from the

don't think there's a demographic difference.

8

the one concrete difference that really is a difference

is, from the city's perspective, they're looking at two

groups, all of whom are going to have to pay a new

higher monthly fee.

decision that says, look, you know, one of these groups

has to make two monthly payments to the city for sewer

and water.

16

we -- what we'll do is we'll just make everybody in the
