ORAL ARGUMENT OF MOSES LASKY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. LASKY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The issue in this case can be stated quite quickly
and quite succinctly.
tion»

It's a question of statutory construc­

It can be stated this ways

Does a court of appeals

have jurisdiction/ under the Interlocutory Appeals Act of
1958, to entertain an interlocutory appeal in a government
civil antitrust cast, or has that appeal been precluded by
the much earlier expediting Act of 1903?
Now, the Act of 1958 was, of course, a revolutionary
act, because it was the customary and traditional animosity
of the law to interlocutory appeals that had existed from
time immemorial, first broken through in the Evarfcs Act of
3.891, to permit interlocutory appeals on injunctive orders;
in 1958, as a result of the experience of the judges, the
Administrative Office of the Courts, the interlocutory appeals
Act was enacted, because it was believed that there were
situations where interlocutory appeal could be very helpful

4
in speeding along the law* in a situation where both the
district judge certified the case as an appropriate one, and
the court of appeals felt the same.
QUESTIONS Well, perhaps you put your finger on the

essence of the case.
about it.

Oh, y.%*.

MR. LASKYs

did not pass upon that.

And our Court of Appeals here

It simply said-it had.no jurisdiction

even to consider the matter.
QUESTION? Then just probably they didn’t feel the
same way about it*

For different reasons.

MR, LASKY:

They didn’t -- they didn’t consider the

matter on its merits.
QUESTIONS
ME. LASKY %

All right.
Now, in this case, the present case

would# if the Court of Appeals had jurisdiction, have been
/

the perfect textbook example of an appropriate case for an
interlocutory appeal.
Now, the question on which the interlocutory appeal
was certified by the District Court was a sharp, simple, and
controlling question of law.

This suit had been filed in 196G#

to enjoin acquisition by Phillips Petroleum Company of
certain of th© assets in the western Tidewater Oil Company,
charging that it would violate the Clayton Act, Section ?.
After extensive hearings, taking of evidence, the

5
District Court, had denied a restraining order# denied a
preliminary injunction, and that parties# although the closing
date had come# did not consummate the case but deferred doing
anything at ail until the District Court had denied the
restraint and the injunction# and then the transaction was
consummated.

The sale was made.

Petitioner proceeded through the next five years
<•
•then as on© for a divestiture against Phillips Petroleum,
and the seller, my client, Tidewater, remained in the case
passively, except to respond fco all discovery? then when
discovery was completed and the government announced it was
ready to go to trial. Tidewater moved to dismiss the action
as against it, on the simple legal preposition that Section
7 was not aimed at the sailer but is directed solely at the
buyer.
That was a cleancut proposition.

If we were

correct, that would negata the case as to Tidewater, and, as
the trial judge said, the case would be a different case*
The District Judge, this time a different District
Judge, denied the motion, our motion to dismiss.

But being

doubtful of -the correctness of his decision, he volunteered —
volunteered — to certify for interlocutory appeal or, in the
alternative, suggested that we mandamus them*

That mandamus,

of course, is not an open remedy, because the court had
jurisdiction to decide what the law meant,

tt

had jurisdiction

6
to misconstrue the law? so mandamus was not open.
Now, we did therefore petition the Ninth Circuit
within the time, allowed by the Act, for an interlocutory
appeal.

That Court held that it lacked jurisdiction.

Ar.Cl

it held that the Expediting Act of 1903 precluded it fro:,
having jurisdiction*

It did so, however, solely upon the

foasi3 of authorities having to do with the jurisdiction of a
court of appeals to entertain an appeal from orders granting
or denying interlocutory injunctions.
different history.

And that has a wholly

And I'll suggest and indicate.

Now, the case, is here before this Court because of a
conflict.

The Ninth and the District of Columbia Circuits

both in the same quick decision have held the court of
*

appeals lacks jurisdiction under the interlocutory appeals
Act? the Seventh Circuit, in a vary careful opinion, has
held that courts of appeals do possess jurisdiction*

And

thereupon, this Court having denied my petition for
certiorari granted it upon a petition for rehearing*
Now, the place to start analysis, I would assume,
must be in the text of the two statutas.

If it isn't the

place to end analysis, it certainly is the place to start
analysis»
The Interlocutory Appeals Act of 1958 states, in
the plainest possible language, that in a civil action an
interlocutory appeal to a court of appeals may be taken if

the District Court makes a certain certification and the
court of appeals, in its discretion, permits.
How, the words "in a civil action" are all.comprehensive.

They’re unlimited as to type of suit? they’re

unlimited as to litigants.
On the other hand, the Expediting Act, which was
enacted, of course, 55 years earlier, says nothing at all
about interlocutory appeals.
the subject.

There's not a word in it about

It simply says, quote, "that an appeal from the

•final judgment”, end quote, in a government civil antitrust
suit will lie only to this Court.
Now, as the Seventh Circuit very cogently observed,
if these two Acts had been enacted by Congress simultaneously,
the language of each could have been given effect without
limiting the scope of the other? and it is, of course, the
fundamental principle of statutory construction that, where
there are two Acts, effect should be given to each, if
possible.
Now, as the Seventh Circuit commented, there is
entirely different language with respect to interlocutory
appeals from injunctive orders.
Act of 1891.

That goes back to the Evarts

And what the Evarta Act said was that an

interlocutory appeal on injunctive orders can be taken to a
court of appeals if that court has the jurisdiction to hoar
an appeal from the final judgment.

That was in that.

8
So thatp when in 1903 the Expediting Act was passed,
which said that appeals from final judgments — and that’s
its language — in government civil antitrust cases lie to
this Court alone, that class of cases ceased to be the class
of cases that the Evarfcs Act had to do with, by its express
language.
Now, over the years, there have been revisions in
the language of the Evarts Act, revisions, amendments,
codifications, finally getting into the Judicial Code in 1948;
and, as a result, there has been debate whether the court of
appeals can entertain an appeal from an interlocutory
injunctive order as of right.

And again this conflict,

the Ninth Circuit and one of the other circuits holds "no",
and the First Circuit held "yes".

And that question has

never reached this Court because it was never to anybody’s
interest to bring it here.
Now, I’m not debating that line of decisions here,
it's not the problem we’re dealing with.

We’re dealing here

with a right to an interlocutory appeal, not as a right but
discretionary under the Act of 1958.
NOW, ~QUESTION?

You’re speaking of discretionary to the

Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in this?
ME. LASKY:

Oh, yes.

And that, if the Court

please, is why 1 do not ask this Court to determine whether

9
our appeal should be allowedr I merely ask this Court to tell
the Ninth Circuit that it has jurisdiction to con
question* and to-remand this case to the Ninth Circuit to
exercise its discretion and to determine whether we should
have an appeal.

It's well-established, X think, that if a

lower court denies that it has jurisdiction and therefore
refuses to exercise it, this Court can tell its

You do have

jurisdiction? now exercise it.
What the Ninth Circuit might do to my petition for
leave to appeal when we get back is an open question? but it’s
not a question X can present to this Court.
Now, the government's argument here has been that
die Expediting Act is a special Act, and that the 1959
Interlocutory Appeals Act is a general Act, and that a later
general Act does not repeal an earlier special Act unless it's
very specific.
But the error in that argument is that both Acts are
special Acts, and that the Act of 1958 repeals nothing.
I say that they are both special Acts in this sense?

the

Expediting Act of 1903 is a special Act dealing with the
problem of appeal from a final judgment in a specific kind of
case, government civil antitrust.
The Interlocutory Appeals Act of 1958 is a special
Act dealing with th© right to take interlocutory appeals in
all kinds of legislation.

No repeal of the Expediting Act is

involved here? because? as 1 have already suggested to the
Court? the Expediting hot says nothing about interl<
appeals.
Now? the reason — the reason why? before 1958?
there was no right to an interlocutory appeal in a government
antitrust case was not that the Expediting Act prohibited it
but because there was no Act of Congress which authorized it.
Prior to 189.1 there was no Act which authorized any
interlocutory appeal.

Then we had an Act that authorized

interlocutory appeals in injunctive orders to a court that
had jurisdiction over the final appeal.
But not until 1958 did any kind of law or statute
authorise an interlocutory appeal of a different character.
So the Act of 1958 repealed nothing? it added something
brand new to the law, something which the courts had felt
would be useful.
And I’ve cited in my brief a statement from the
Harvard Jounral on Legislation? that the judgment, of Congress
that the interlocutory appeals Act would expedite litigation
had proved to be sound from experience.
How? we come then to this questions

The government

has relied primarily on dictum? language of Justice Brandeis
in United States vs. California Canneries? the famous language
and, I will read those two sentences? because this is what
the case has been made to turn on by the court below.

11
Said the Court? referring to the provisions concerning
appeal prior to the Expediting Act:
‘’These provisions governing appeals in general were
amended by the Expediting Act so that in suits in equity under
the Anti-Trust Act ’in which the United States is complainant*(
the appeal should be direct to this Court from the final
decree in the trial court.

Thus, Congress limited the right

of review to an appeal from the decree which disposed of all
matters; and it precluded the possibility of an appeal to
either court from an interlocutory decree*18
That's the language my adversary seeks to fasten
upon us as somehow disposing of this case,
I have two observations I wish to make about that
language, and I believe both of them are very trenchant*
First ( the Court was not then laying down any rule
of constitutional law.

St says there cannot b© interlocutory

appeals and that everything must be decided on a final appeal*
It was laying down no law of nature ? some — to use an
expression of Mr. Justice Holmes — some brooding omnipresence
in the sky.

It was saying nothing about some immutable

perpetual restriction.

It was speaking about a clear

legislative policy on ‘the state of the statutes in 1925.
And it was entirely correct in what it said? because since
Congress had made ho provision for an interlocutory appeal?
and it provided that only a final appeal went to this Court?

12
it was correct? there was no wav to get an interlocutory
appeal»
Now, the in te rlocato ary appeals Act was enacted 55
years after the Expediting Act, about 40 years after the
California Canneries case, it was a sharp break with former
attitui.es about desirability of interlocutory appeals»

As I

have already suggested# it was a new departure# manifesting
a radically different attit
from a former antipathy# and in the Gann.
was, at most, expressing a judgment on what Congress had done,
not on what Congress could do or what it might be doing
thirty years later»
QUESTION? The difficulty, of course, is that this
language 'was lator quoted in Brown Shoe, —MR. LASKY3

Yes# it was.

QUESTION?

»— after the enactment of the new law

in 1958»
•V. .

•

MR. LASKYs

Now# the point about Brown Shoe was that

it was purely dictum.

The question was not — that was not

the question in Brown Shoe, the question in Brown Shoe was
whether a decision by the trial court that an acquisition
had violated the law before it created a remedy was
sufficiently final to permit appeal at all.
*

T *’ ;

And the court held that if was*
Then in a footnote it had this statement

Now, as

13
to that, of course, it*s well settled that not only the
dictum is not binding, but statements made in a context in
which the matter is not even before the Court should not be
given broad and exaggerated value.
Just the other day, 1 said the other day, in May of
this year, in gastergard vs. United STates, which is reported
in 406 United States, this Court observed that broad language
was particularly in dictunb and in the context of ancillary
points, no essential to the decision of the Court, has no
weight.
How, not only was Brown Shoe dictum, but the Court
wasn't dealing with the question, wasn’t presented to it for
its consideration; but what was said in the Canneries case
on the subject was also dictura.
Also dictum, for this reasons

There, what was

being appealed from was an order denying a motion for leave
to intervene after a final decree in United States vs. Swift
& Company, and it’s settled law, that a post-judgment order,
on appeal from a post-judgment order is- not an interlocutory
appeal, in itself is an appeal from a final order, which
this Court

has held, in the Si Paso case, one of the El Paso

Natural Gas cases, well-settled at the time.

And most of

Justice Brandeis*s opinion was pointing that out, that that
was a final order? therefore an appeal lay only to that Court.
QUESTIONs

Mr. Lasky, let me get back to —

14
MR. IiASKY:
QUESTIONS

Yes, sir.
—- with you, if you will.

If the

District Judge was correct that there was an issue of law
which might dispose of the whole indication, and your
position is that the court of appeals then should have resolved
..

that issue, that — would that be open to a petition for
certiorari?
MR. LASKYs
QUESTION!

Oh, definitly.
Now, then, suppose it was decided and

accepted, that would be final disposition of the case —*
MR. LASKY:
QUESTION 2

Yes, Your Honor.
~~ there would be no petition for

certiorari.
Isn’t that somewhat incompatible, at least, with the
concept of this statute that appeals were to be directly to
this Court?
MR. LASKY:

Well, I can answer that —

QUESTION:

The final disposition of a case was to

be here as a matter of right.
MR. LASKY: The Expediting Act was enacted under
certain suppositions, that this was a way to expedite
litigation? and experience has shown that it was not.
Secondly, that it was better to get the case into the hands
of this Court and bypass the courts of appeals? and, as the
i

Seventh Circuit remarked, much more has been read into the

15
Expediting Act than it actually contained.
Now, we're coring now to questions of policy, and
as to this I think my adversaries* when I present these
questions of policy* ar-.j holding the sword by its blade.
This Court h;|3 frequently obs
appreciates and can make good use of the sci
the courts of appeals.

It's useful.

ng function of

This Court, or

Justices of this Court, have more than once, in the last few
years* observed that the Expediting Act is not as desirable,
to put it mildly, as it once was.
Now we have an Act here, and my adversaries say
they can conceive of legislation to handle the problem much
better than this, and I don't dispute that Congress might think
of legislation better than this, but I say here is an Act that
exists and what aicl the Congress has given to this Court
should not be spurned* even if better may be found.
Mow, let me address myself to the question of
whether

two things:

whether this is an anomalous procedure,

and whether it would (impose a burden on this Court instead of
alleviating a burden* which, I submit* is the case*
It is not anomalous.

Congress has a right to

experiment on appellate procedure.

It could well have deter"

mined that interlocutory appeals are helpful.
determine.

It did so

Experience has shown it was right*
At the same time it could very well say that:

Let's

not burden the Supreme Court with interlocutory appeals, let's
carry it through the Court of Appeals, then this Court,
through certiorari jurisdiction,- having the benefit of that
screening, the benefit of that judgment, can" lock at it upon
a petition for certiorari and determine whether it deserves
further review»
QUESTION:

Mr» Lasky, supposing that the Ninth

Circuit had held otherwise as to its jurisdiction, or
entertained your appeal and moved with you, would the result
have been then that the case gees back to the District Court
for a dismissal, and then doesn’t the government have a right
'to appeal under the Expediting Act to this Court?
MR, LASKY:

It would have a right to appeal under

the Expediting Act to this Court at the end of the whole case,
or immediately if the Court made a proper order —* 1 think it*
under Rule 54» I don't have the exact rule number *— but it
could have specified no reason for delay on that appeal»

That

is true.
QUESTION:

it could — at any rata, the propriety

of the decision of the court of appeals could have been
reviewed under the Expediting Act by this Court at some
future stage of litigation?
MR, Xi&SKYs

Oh, yes.

In other words, this Court

remains the final word in government antitrust casas, but it
also remains the final word in every other case.

And in

17
every other case it determines that question* whether it
should intervene* after it has had the benefit of the view
t lie court of appeals,
The procedure that I say

submit that

the

interlocutory appeals Act offers is that it can do the same
here.

And I would submit that it would be extraordinarily

useful if the courts below made greater use of this kind of
procedure.
Now* there are other arguments that have been
presented by my adversaries, and X approach the matter from a
standpoint of responding to adversaries* argument, because it
seems to me, and as it seamed to the Seventh Circuit, if you
take the language of the statute cn its face* it is plainly
in favor of the interlocutory appeal.

The only way

adversaries read the language to eliminate that is to bring to
bear upon it an erroneous history, which is the history of
interlocutory appeals from injunctive orders.
Now, one other argument has been presented by the
Solicitor General*s office, which is that interlocutory
appeals from injunctive orders deserve, or are meritorious,
should be allowed more than interlocutory appeals of a
/

discretionary type that the 1958 Act deals.*with? of course
that's a value judgment.

They start with that premise.

And they say that no interlocutory appeal

from an

injunctive order in a government antitrust suit, and it would

be vary anomalous. than, to permit it to lie from another
type of order.
This is one of the major arguments made in the
,Solicitor General’s brief, and it has several flaws about it.
In the first place, it is by no means clear that
injunction — an appeal does not lie from an interlocutory
injunctive order in a government antitrust suit under 28 U.S»
Code 1292(a).
Mow, 1292(a) is the Evarts Act brought up to date.
1292(b)

is the Interlocutory Appeals Act of 1958.

There is

a difference.
Where you have an appeal under 1292(a), it is as of
right» an injactive order, receiverships.

To have an appeal

under 1292(b), it is a matter of joint discretion of the
two lower courts.
Now, it is not at all settled that there is no
appeal as of right from an injunctive order, because, as I
said, there is a conflict between the circuits on that, and
this Court has never resolved it.
But, assuming that you cannot have an appeal from
an injunctive order as of right under 1292(a), then you do have
that right under 1292(b), because 1292(b) says, and here's its
1 anguagei
'’When a district judge, in making in a civil action
an order not otherwise appealable under this section" -- that's

19
1292 — then the 1958 procedure applies.
So that the argument doesn't bear it up.
1 submit the matter in this ways

The Interlocutory

Appeals Act of 1S58 was the culmination of a going feeling
over the years that the old# hard rule against interlocutory
appeals was Injurious to the administration of justice.
it opened it up.

And

The Interlocutory Appeals Act repealed

nothing, it added something to the law. On the face of the
statute, legally it allows an interlocutory appeal in any
kind of civil case to a court of appeals if the two lower
courts believe it is an appropriate case.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Lasky, if you're right in your last

contention, that 1292(b) did repeal something, didn't it repeal
1292(a}’s limition on right to appeal injunctive decrees to
the court that had jurisdiction?
MR. LASKYs

In this, it not really repealed, add to,

because 1292(a) is a right to appeal as a right.
QUESTION? Right.
>

v '
MR. LASKYs

It doesn’t call for any certification

by the district court, it calls for a permission by the
: court of appeal®.

And in order to come in under 1292(b), on®

would have to show that there is involved a controlling
question of law upon which there is good grounds for dispute.
I think that’s »— and that the decision would expedite the
litigation.

Those were the tests that have to be made under

20

1292(b) that do not have to be made under 1292(a).
Now, in how many injunctions, preliminary injunction
cases — matters that yon could meet those tests, I don't
know.

1 think you might often be able to do so, because an

interlocutory injunction, as was observed, 1 think, by Mr,
Justice Fertas in one of the cases in this Court, granted in a
Section 7 case often has the effect of terminating the
transaction, and terminating the litigation.
So that, I submit that the statute on its face allows
interlocutory appeal? I submit that the statute so interpreted,
so applied, would go a long way to alleviate the burden of
this Court, would give the Court the benefit of the screening
action of the courts of appeals, and I do not dispute that
Congress might well look at it again and determine what other
relief would be in order? but that is no reason to spurn the
relief which Congress has presently given.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Thank you, Mr. Lasky.
Mr. Randolph.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF h. RAYMOND RANDOLPH, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT, UNITED STATES
MR. RANDOLPHS

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the. Courts
Mr. Lasky is quite right in characterising the issue
here as one of statutory interpretation.

It's somewhat

21
complicated because here we have two statutes to interpret,
the Expediting Act of 1903 and the Interlocutory Appeals Act,
amendment of 1958, which is Section 1292(b).
Since we believe that the Expediting Act controls
the decision in this case, and that the decision below should .
therefore be affirmed, I’ll begin with that statute.
Section 2 of the Expediting Act provides, and 1
quote, "that in a government civil antitrust cases an appeal
from the final judgment of the District Court will lie only
to' the Supreme Court."
This Act, passed in 1903, had two basic purposes2
One, to eliminate the delays of intermediate appeals
and, two, to insure that this Court and only this Court would
decide that the questions in the cases presented are in these
cases because of their importance, and in order to insure
nationwide uniformity in their interpretation of the antitrust
laws.
Now, Congress accomplished both of these objectives
in the Act.

As is obvious from its terms, it included a

direct path from the district court to this Court in the
final judgments,for review of final judgments.
.

But it also precluded interlocutory appeals to the

courts of appeals.

And it did this because at the time it

was passed, the Evarts Act, as Mr. Lasky pointed out, said
that the courts of appeals had jurisdiction to review inter-

22
locutory appeals only in cases where they had jurisdiction
to review the final judgment»
QUESTIONs

Well, then, it was the Evarts Act and

not the Expiting Act that precluded interlocutory appeals,
wasn't it?
ME. RANDOLPH:

Well, I think that question can be

cleared up when I discuss the cases that have interpreted the
Expediting Act.
If Congress wanted to do — if Congress had the
purpose of precluding intermediate appeals in the Expediting
Act -- and we think it did — it would have been just simply
superfluous for it to say:

And also we do not. want any

interlocutory appeals to take place*
It didn't have to say that because, under the
provisions of the Evarts Act, there would be no interlocutory
appeals ones the .Expediting Act was passed.
That is why Congress, when it gave this Court
jurisdiction over final judgments, precluded interlocutory
appeals.
Now, over the years, there's been a consistent
interpretation of the Expediting Act, to mean exactly what
Congress intended it to mean.
In 1929, Mr. Justice Brandeis stated for the Court
that the Expediting Act had ©mealed the provisions of the
Evarts Act, and he said:

In th^ Expediting Act — and Mr.

Congress, quote , “limited the right

Lasky quoted this also

of review to an appeal fromthe decree which disposed of all
matters and precluded the possibility of an appeal either to
this Court or to the Court of Appeals from an interlocutory
decree..n
And Mr» Lasky tells us that was dictum.

Mr* Justice

Brandeis, who was noted for his sensitivity to jurisdiction#
in pronouncing that statement, was not the holding of the
Court.
And he tells us this because ha says that in that
case what we really had was a final judgment.
Well# if this Court examines the opinion in
California Canneries# they’ll notice that Mr. Justice Brandeis
never did resolve whether the order being appealed from in
that case was a final judgment or a final decrees'or an
interlocutory decree.

What he said was:

it doesn’t matter,

which it is# because the courts of appeals have jurisdiction
over neighbor.
_

Fifteen years later# after the opinion in the

California Canneries case,

the Court decided a case

entitled Allen Calculators# which we’ve cited# 1 believe on
page 23 of our brief.
In that case the Court also relying on California
Canneries# again stated# quote# "jurisdiction to review District
Court decrees was not vested in the Circuit Courts of Appeals

24
but solely in this Court, and the Expediting Act —* the
Expediting Act limited the right of appeal to final decrees

n

Hot the Evarts Act, the Expediting Act.
Then# shortly thereafter# in two other cases# in
Alkali Exporters# and in the DeBeers case# both of which
involved review of interlocutory orders in government civil
antitrust cases by the common law writ of certiorari under
the all writs Act# the Court said that sole appellate
jurisdiction in these kinds of casas lies in this Court*

of appeals from interlocutory decrees.
Mr* Lssky points out that 1292(b) was not involved
in Brown Shea.

That's true.

But what was involved in Brown

Shoe was the question whether the decree in that case was a
final judgment, and one of the factors that motivated the
Court to hold that'it was a final judgment was simply that if

it was not » it was not appealable at all.
QUESTION?

Mr. Randolph, I read the footnote in

Brown Shoe, and I don’t get any impression from the footnote
that the Court was even aware that 1292<b) had been passed
several years earlier.

Do you think I’m wrong?

MR, RANDOLPHS

Well» I don't know whether the Court

was aware of it or not» but I think -~
QUESTION*

There’s certainly no indication in the

footnote there» is there?
MR. RANDOLPHt Well» I think it’s significant that
the Court» in making that statement, as the Court has said
since 1929 in all of the caries I’ve just discussed, this said
that the statute that governs appeals in government civil
antitrust cases, since 1903» is the Expediting Act.
QUESTIONS But if they weren’t aware of the statute
passed in 1958, certainly that footnote isn’t addressed to be
taken to construe a statutory

be considered holding.

Oh, I'm not arguing that that should
Not at all.

But I think it’s also significant that in his
concurring opinion Mr, Justice Clark, who, incidentally,was
no friend of the Expediting Act»- stated, and I quote again,
that the Act declares that appeals in civil antitrust cases.
in which the United States is complainant, lie only to this
Court.

It thus deprives the parties of an intermediate appeal

26
And Mr. Justice Harlan, in his separate opinion,
said, and I quote again, the Congress has seen fit to make
this Court the sole appellate tribunal for civil antitrust
eases instituted by the United ST&tosy in doing so it has
chosen to limit this Court’s reviewing power to rinal judgments.
Mr. Justice ~~
QUESTION;

Did any of those separate opinions

mention 1292(b).
MR. RANDOLPHS

Not (b), but Mr. Justice Harlan said

— did mention the Interlocutory Appeals Act, and he said that
if this were other than a government civil antitrust case,
the decree could have been appealed to the courts of appeals
under 1252(a).

That's on page 365? 370 U.S. 365.

QUESTION; Well, all of that is generally just a
true statement of the general rule and the general facts of
the matter.

There was none of those opinions that addressed

themselves to the problem that we have here today, really,
at all.
MR. RANDOLPH;

Well; I think they did, in the sense

that I'm now about to propose to the Court.
*

QUESTION;

1 was here then, and I read the opinions

before they were published, and ~~
MR. RANDOLPH s
in any of these cases.

1292(b) certainly was not involved
I agree with that»

But the important point is that we find, from every

27
Justice that has ever spoken about the matter, saying that
the purpose of Congress in passing the Expediting Act was to
preclude interlocutory appeals to the courts of appeals.
And that Congress did just that.
QUESTION: But Congress changes purposes in new
Acts o
MR. RANDOLPH:

And I think that's one of the

questions that I'm going to discuss.
Since that's what we have, a consistent interpreta­
tion of the Expediting Act for — since 1929, from 1929 to
1962 at least? then I might add that in opinions we cited
in our brief by Mr. Justice Goldberg in chambers„ he repeated
\

the same thing.
And it's against this background, this is the back­
ground against which Tidewater argues that it may appeal
from an interlocutory decree in this case, and it relies
upon 1292(b), which says that when a district judge in making
in a civil action an order not otherwise appealable under this
section certifies that it involves a controlling question of.
law about which there is substantial difference of opinion
that, and it may as resolution on appeal may advance termina­
tion of the litigation, then the court of appeals has
discretion whether to hear the appeal.
Tidewater's position amounts to this:

that although

the courts of appeals have no jurisdiction to review final

judgment in this case, they may, nevertheless, cite
controlling questions of law in government civil antitrust
cases by reviewing interlocutory orders.
In other words, they nuiy speak about and decide
controlling questions of law in cases where they have no
authority to speak with finality.
QUESTION? Except for injunctions.
MR. RANDOLPHs

I'm sorry, 1 don't under the question,

sir.
QUESTION:

Well, is it their position they can review

injunctive orders, too?
MR. RANDOLPH:

Interlocutory injunctive orders.
Is it Tidewater's position?

In their reply .brief they come very close to taking
that position.

They say that

QUESTION:

Then you think 1292(a) is clear, that

courts of appeals may not review interlocutory injunctive
orders?
MR. RANDOLPH: That's right.

The Justice

Department, I might add, had argued otherwise, for a number
of years? had attempted to argue otherwise.
QUESTION:

And

You say this approach that Mr. Lasky

fancies would defeat the objective of having this Court and
only this Court be the final arbiter?
MR. RANDOLPH:

Yes.

I think so.

But I think, as far as the question of statutory

29
interpretation involved in here , what it means is that given
the consistent interpretation of the Expediting Act of 1903,.
and I’ve said, what it stands for and what this Court has said
it stands for, the question if whether anything changed in
19S3 by the passage of this general provision that applies
fco appeals in general.
And if Congress were about to change the Expediting
Act, emd it's been trying to do that now, I might add, with
bills before it since 1963, at least, one would expect at
least a reference to the Expediting Act in the provision that,
supposedly repeals part of it.
QUESTION: But the Expediting Act doesn't, by its
terms, deal with interlocutory appeals, does it?
MR. RANDOLPH:
QUESTION:

This Court has said —

Does the Expediting Act, by its terms,

deal with interlocutory appeal?
MR. RANDOLPHs

Not on its face, but I think you have

to forget about fifty years of history and the legislative
history behind, it, to say that the Expediting Act, as its
purpose, did not preclude interlocutory appeals.

That was

one of the reasons —*
QUESTION: Well, doesn't it say final judgment?
MR. RANDOLPH:

It says only final judgment on the

face, right.
QUESTION: Well then, it does deal with interlocutory

30
appeals in a sense that interlocutory appeals may not be
brought here?
MR. RANDOLPH:

Well, this — that’s right.

The --

what it does not say is
QUESTION:

And, arguably, it means that no inter­

locutory appeals should be taken anywhere.
MR. RANDOLPH:

That’s what this Court has said

for — since 1929..
QUESTION:

So it does deal with interlocutory

appeals, doesn't it?
MR. RANDOLPH:

Mr. Justice Relinquish asked me

whether one can see that on its face? it doesn't say inter­
locutory appeal, and that was what I was trying to show.
QUESTION:

It deals with it by explicit exclusion.

MR. RANDOLPH:

That's right.

And that was not

inadvertence, that was one of the very reasons it was passed,

to prevent it.
QUESTION:

Does the legislative history give us any

aid there?
MR. RANDOLPH:

Of the interlocutory appeals Act?

It would foe ‘die Expediting Act, Mr. Justice —
QUESTION:

Well, either.

MR. RANDOLPH:

Well, I think so, and I’m about to

discuss that question.
It would seem .reasonable to expect, that since what

we're talking about is revision of the policy, the procedural
policy that’s been followed for fifty years, that d
is about to revise that they would at least mention, the
Expediting Act or discuss it thoroughly, or say, this is the
way the Expediting Act should be revised.
But one will search in vain in the three years of
committee reports, this bill for 1292(b), passed in 1958,
came about as a result of a draft by the Judicial Conference
of the United States*

In three years of reports, which we

cite in our brief, there's not one word of the Expediting
Act —- about the Expediting Act or any indication they
intended to revise that.

There’s not one word about

government civil antitrust cases.
One can look through the congressional hearings
on this bill, the House Report, the Senate Report, remarks
on the Floor in Congress, again not one word about the
Expediting Act.
Hot one word about government civil antitrust
cases, and yet Tidewater tells us that the very purpose of
this bill was to repeal the Expediting Act insofar as it
precluded interlocutory appeals.
Now, there is some mention of antitrust cases.

We

have to remember that all the Expediting Act deals with is
government civil antitrust cases.

And we think it's

perfectly clear that when Congress was talking about antitrust

32
cases in the legislative history of 1292(b), they were
referring only to private treble-damage actions.
Thus, on page 11 of our brief — that's wrong.
1 apologize, it's page 2S of our brief.

On page 11 in

Tidewater's brief this is quoted.
But the Senate Report says:

“Disposition of anti­

trust cases may take considerable time, yet upon appeal
following final disposition of such cases, the court of
appeals may well determine that the

statute of limitations had

run® and so on and so forth.
Well, it's obvious that

what they're talking about

there is a private treble-damage action, because the final
disposition of that kind of antitrust case would go to the
court of appeals, whereas in a government case it will come
to this Court, and no one has disputed that.
There's another reason why that — which is not
mentioned in our brief? which, occurred to me — why that
quotation cannot apply to government civil antitrust cases.
It's simply this, that when the United States brings an
action for an injunction under the Sherman Act or the Clayton
Act there's no statute of limitations.
I think that the examples in the Senate Report and
in the House Report that deal with antitrust cases were
taken from Chief Judge Parker's testimony in the hearings on
1292(b).

hs the Court refers to that, they'll notice that

Chief Judge Parker, in testifying about it* did say that he

QUESTION s But none when the government is in it?
MR. RANDOLPH: That's right.
QUESTION; what was that «— what would you suggest
was the reason for 1292(b)?
MR. RANDOLPH;

I think the reason is the same as

the reason for allowing any interlocutory appeals* which is
simply that

it saves the litigants and the trial courts a

great deal of effort.
QUESTION;

I suppose the reasons — the reasons for

1292 (Ip) would apply equally to the kind of suit we have in
t his case?
MR. RANDOLPH;

Yes.

QUESTION; And there would foe no reason that you
could think of to exclude this kind of a case from 1292(b),

if you were approaching it rationallyr I don5t suppose.
MR. RANDOLPHS Well, let me —
QUESTION?

You’d either have interlocutory appeal —

MR. RANDOLPHS Well * yes, I can think of a reason for
this.
QUESTIONS

You’d either have an interlocutory appeal

somewhere, anyway.
MR. RANDOLPH:

Yes.

Let me just say this.

Now,

since 1983, Congress has been considering bills to revise the
Expediting Act. And as we pointed out in our brief, they
came very close in the la3t Congress to giving a thorough
revision to the Expediting Act.

And what they were about to

do there was make it the basic rule that all these appeals
will go to the courts of appeals.

The Justice Department

supported -this legislation.
But then there would be an exception, that after
the final judgment of the District Court, if the attorney
general of the District Court certified that the case was of
general public importance, then there would be a direct appeal
to this Court, but this Court vsould have discretion to re
the appeal and remand the case to the court of appeals.
The one provision that's been contained in every
bill before Congress since 1963, and these are cited in our
brief, is dealing with interlocutory appeals.
this?

And it says

that appeals shall be allowed under 1292(a) but not

35
otherwise.

And that’s the bill that passed both Houses of

Congress last year.

And the reason for' it is that in the

Committee Reports

I haven't cited this in our brief? but

in the Committee Reports on the bill that was in the last
House of Congress, that Congress thought it would be anomalous
t o have the courts of appeals deciding controlling questions
of law in a case where the direct appeal might go to the
Supreme Court of the United States.
QUESTION:

Is that — are those reasons expressed

in the —
MR. RANDOLPH:
QUESTION:

In the Committee Report?

Yes.

MR, RANDOLPH:

Yes, they are.

Well, I can read directly from it, if I can find it.
But I can assure you that is the reason that’s expressed there.
I can give you the citation, it's —
QUESTION:

So you think there is some reason —

some sensible reason for saying that the policy of 1292
shouldn't reach cases like this?
MR. RANDOLPH:

Yes.

X think also — the question

that remains in this case, that constantly remains in this
case/ is why would

if Congress wanted to revise the

Expediting Act, why would they have done it this way?

.

And we're given an explanation —* wall, first of all, they
didn’t even mention the Expediting Act in .any of the history,

36
and what we have is a clear policy that the Expediting
Act includes interlocutory appeals, and unless Congress even
deals with that question, that a general statute can’t repeal
that Expediting Act provision.
Tidewater gives is:

But the rationalisation that

Well, what Congress wanted to do is save

•this Court a lot of time, wanted to reduce this Court's
workload, because of the direct appeals under the Expediting
Act.
Well, the strange thing is that that’s not mentioned
at all in any of the committee reports, the hearings or
anything else.

But the interesting thing about it is 1 fail

to see how appeals under the interlocutory appeals provision
is going to reduce this Court's trorkload one iota.
Because the point is that no matter what the court
of appeals decides on the interlocutory appeal, the number of
cases where direct appeal would lie remains the same.
In fact,
QUESTION: Do you agree that if the court of appeals
had allowed this interlocutory appeal and had decided for
Tidewater that that would have *-*- that the matter would have
gone back to the District Court and that issue would have keen
appealable here?
MR. RANDOLPH:

It would depend, first of all,

there could be a petition for certiorari from the court of
appeals' judgment.

That would be one avenue.

The court

37

would get the case, have■to consider —
QUESTIONS Well, but that means that —
MR. RMDOIjPHs
QUESTION:

If it goes back •—

That' means that you don’t have an appeal

as it's raised.
MR. RANDOLPHS

Well, if it goes back, this is a

question that’s never been decided by the Court.

But it’s

possible, when you have multiple parties, in a case, under
Rule 54(b) of the Rules of Civil Procedure, a district judge
may enter an order as to one party.
QUESTION: This is a final judgment.
MR. RANDOLPH: A final judgment order.

And then we

may appeal just simply that part of the case, under the
Expediting Act.
QUESTION:

Under the final judgment.

MR, RANDOLPH:

The judge that has the final judgment,

yes.
Buts anyway, take, for example, a case that arises
under Section 7 of the Clayton Act, and the question in the
case is that there's a motion to dismiss by the defendant,
h® claims Section 7 doesn't cover conglomerate mergers.
And the district court denies the motion to dismiss.
Now, suppose you can have an interlocutory appeal*
Well, the defendant then takes his — certainly a controlling
question of law, certainly important, 'there may be a

substantial difference of opinion about it.

The defendant

takes his appeal to the courts of appeals. The court of
appeals affirms? let us suppose? and says that Section 7 may
in fact cover conglomerate mergers. ' Then what happens?
Weil? of course? since it’s such an important question
he petitions for — the defendant petitions for certiorari,
tod then what does this Court do?
Well? it looks at it? it’s certainly kmportant.
I mean? if that’s the test for

granting certiorari? it’s

certainly significant.
Suppose -the Court grants certiorari? and then
decides that issue — somewhat in the abstract? I might add*
And then what happens?
Wall? then the case goes back to the district court?
and suppose the Court says Section ? dees cover conglomerate
mergers? the case goes back, you have a full trial? after
which there could be another direct appeal? because the claim
»

would be then that the evidence doesn’t support the judgment
of the District Court.
The court will look at the case twice.

Suppose —

QUESTION? Well? that wouldn’t be the only basis
on which the appeal could be taken*

It might be on the

basis that the district court was wrong as a matter of law?
would it not?
MR. RANDOLPHS

Yes.

It could bo on any number of

things.
QUESTION ; For following the court of appeals?
MR. RANDOLPH;

Hight*

But suppose that the — suppose there were no
interlocutory appeals allowed.
have to look at the case?

Once.

How many times would the court
One time.

Of course, the litigants, you know, if the Court
finally decides that Section 7 does not cover conglomerate
mergers, it puts the litigants to a great deal of effort, it
put the trial court to a great deal of effort that might other
wise have been avoided.
But the point is that Congress made that judgment
with respect to government civil antitrust cases.
that we have a choice;

It decided

one is to allow interlocutory appeals

and save the litigants some time in district courts? the
other is to get expeditious review on appeal.

Congress made

the choice an 1903, it hasn’t changed it yet, it vary well may
in the future.

It’s been considering that.

But that judgment as to government civil antitrust
eases has already been made, and we don’t think it’s been
revised.
QUESTION;

Mr. Randolph, supposing that 1292(b) did

apply to this sort of a situation, don’t you think that since
the certification by the district judge is discretionary,
and the entertainment of the appeal by the court of appeals

40
is also discretionary, that both the lower federal courts
could be trusted to be pretty sparing with this type of —
allowing this type of appeal?
MR. RANDOLPH: Well, I just have no basis on which
to make that, judgment.
I might say this, though, that in these government
civil antitrust cases, 1 would — if I were a district judge,
perhaps my inclination would be that if there ware any way to
get it off my back, I’d do that. And one of the ways nay

very

well be to keep certifying interlocutory appeals.
QUESTION: Well, district judges don't traditionally
act that way very often, Mr. Randolph.
MR. RANDOLPHS

Thankfully not,

I made the

hypothetical myself.
But anway, the possibility is real.

I think that s

something that Congress has to consider, the possibility of
too many certifications, and therefore slowing down the
disposition of these cases.
Well, time is important. The cases do drag out over
a number of years.
cases.

But I think time is important in *ui©se

Particularly when you have injunctions in effect.

Or an injunction to deny, which- is the usual type situation*
And so 1 -think, in summary, what it comes down to
is this:

that the system of appellate review of Expediting

Act cases, that Tidewater envisages, with circuit courts of

41
appeals that have no jurisdiction to review final judgments,
passing on controlling questions of law, is an anomaly in
the federal appellate system.

There’s no other area of federal

appeallate law where that exists.
Now, maybe Congress experimented, but .it seems
strange that Congress did not even mention this, mention
the possibility of this kind of system arising, if it was
attempting to experiment, it didn’t know what ingredients it
was pouring into the brew.
I think that in itself casts substantial doubt on
the correctness of Tidewater's position.
We add to this the fact that there’s no indication
whatsoever that Congress considered the Expediting Hot, or
even considered, in the revision of 1292(b), the burdens on
this .Court, and that it’s doubtful, at best, that Tidewater’s
proposed scheme would ©van save this Court any trouble.
And that in the long aeries of cases from the Canneries case
to Brown Shoe, every Justice that’s spoken on the matter said
..that the Expediting Act forbids interlocutory appeals»
When you put all this together, we believe that
there’s no doubt that the Court below correctly held that it
didn't have jurisdiction over the Tidewater appeal, and we
think, therefore, the decision should be affirmed.
Thank you.
