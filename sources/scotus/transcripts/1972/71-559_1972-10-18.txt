MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next In Mo. 71-559, United States against Fuller.
Mr. Saehse.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF HARRY R. SACHSE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SACHSE:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

The issue presented

by the case is as follows:.
Wien the government condemns land for a public
project, must It pay for the value added to the land by a
permit to graze cattle on adjacent public lands?

And I

can refine that one step futher, when that permit is
admittedly a revocable permit that the government can revoke
without payment of compensation.
The factual situation in which the case arose is
the following:
The government determined that it was necessary to
build a dam as a flood-control project on the Bill Williams
River in Arizona, an area that was subject to flash floods.
Mr. Fuller owned three tracts of land in the
•

vicinity of this project.
acres.

i ,

0, ,

It was a total of about-1,280 .

It was necessary for the goi'ernment to take two of

4
those tracts that totalled 920 aci-es.

It was not necessary

for the government to take the third tract and the third
tract was not taken.
In connection

with this land, Mr. Fuller for a

number of years had been using 30,000 acres of federal
grazing land to graze his cattle on.

He used that land under

a permit issued under Section V of the Taylor Grazing Act,
1934 and a Section V permit — and I'll talk about this in a
little more detail later —* is the revocable permit that
by statute does not create any right, title or interest in the
public land.
Q

Mr, Sachse, does it have a term stated,

however, even though it is revocable?
MR. SACHSE:

The term is not stated in.the statute

except that it cannot exceed ten years.

As an administrative

regulation and practice, the permits are issued year by year.
The permit has to be reissued each year.

They are customarily

issued to the same person .who had them the year before, but the
permit is for one year.
Q

There is not any formal procedure for

termination — or is there?
}. V

MR. SACHSE:

I think there is a formal procedure
• ’

for termination..to this extent, that if a man applies for
the permit for a second year and the government determines
not to grant the permit the second year, the government will

5
allow him to — will state its .reasons why the permit is not
being

granted and will allow him to state his reasons why

he thinks the permit should be granted.

It*s not — the

government won't deny a permit just out of hand but the
permits are

revocable and, often, when the property is

needed for another purpose or the property has not been
properly used, are

revoked.

Now, there is a peculiarity of this case that needs
to be kept in mind.

The government did not revoke Mr. Puller's

grasing permit when it took these two tracts of land.

The

reason it did not do so is that it did not take his third
tract of land and he was free to continue to use this
permit in. connection /with the third tract., ■In Arizona, the basis for having

- - ■

a grazing permit

is having sufficient water for the cattle that will roam on
federal land to use on the private land and he had sufficient
water, apparently, on his third tract of land arid so far as
we know, Mr. Puller is still using this permit. •
Q

And it is your contention, I take It, that

the Department of — what is it, Agriculture or Interior?
MR. SACHSE:
Q

It is Interior.

The Department of Interior will not take a

jaundiced view of the renewal of his permit because he has
less fee-land now than he did before?
MR, SACHSH:

That is correct.

It has not done so,

6
as far as I understand.

Actually, part of what brings this

case here is that the Department of the Interior has been
very generous with the use of this land because if the
Department of the Interior had revoked this use of the

30,000 acres of public land before it took the land in
question, at least, according to the jurisprudence in the
courts of appeal up to this point, there would have been
no question at all that he would have had no right to ask
the jury to evaluate his use of the public land along with
his use of his private land and it is our contention that
it is just nonsense to say that this revocable permit,
creating less than a property right in the public land that
could have been revoked, gives him a right to additional
compensation because the government chose not to revoke it.

If the government now took his next piece of land,
the third piece of land, under the ruling of the Ninth Circuit
the government would have to pay again for the same permit.

heavily on the number of cows that could be graaed on his

The majority

I should say that more accurately.

He had a

have added to that any special value provided by the use of
the public land.
The court was at pains to distinguish this

Court's

decision in United States versus Rands which, in a rather
similar situation, had held exactly to the contrary, that if
a man had private land along a river and he had a special
value added to that land by Its possible uses of port site,
that the government, in taking the land, would not have to
pay the special port site value that was added.'
The dissenting judge found that the decision in
Rands was controlling in this case.
Q

Well, Rands — has Rands been overruled by

the Congress or at least in the narrow facts of Rands, it has
been pretty well run over, hasn't it?
MR. SACH3E:

Well, I don't think so at all,

your

8
Honor.
Q

You don't?

MR. SACHSE:

Mr. Birch argues that, but I think

it points out a very essential distinction.

In Rands, this

Court held that as a constitutional matter, the Fifth
Amendment of the Constitution of the United States provides
the just compensation for the taking of private property for
public use does not include the value of any special use in
public property and the fact situation there was the public
property was the use of a waterway for a port site and the
use of property — of riparian property for a port site
and the court relied on the government's navigational
servitude, saying that the government decides whether someone
can or cannot use navigable waters for a port site.
Now, Congress, after that case, passed an act that
said that where riparian land is taken in one situation —
well, let's really back up — that where the entirety of a
riparian property is taken for harbor improvements or river
improvements, that any special value that it has as a port
site can be included in the evaluation of the land.
I have two points to make here.

One, it is not at

all unusual for this Court to say what the constitutional
requirement is for just compensation and for Congress then
to provide more if it thinks in a particular situation that
it should do so

9
And., secondly, the Congressional Act doesn't go
nearly as far as the Rands case went.

The Rands case

created a broad principle that would apply to any riparian
taken.

The Congressional Act applied only if the entirety

of a man's land was taken which, by the way, was not the
case here.
Q

Now, it's just a statutory decision without

capability of overruling the constitutional decision.
MR. SACHSE:

It is a statutory act,Without capability

r

of overruling the constitutional decision.
Q

Well, nonetheless, Congress gets its way

in this case because, as you say, Congress can grant more
than the Fifth Amendment because —
MR. SACHSE:

And Congress could get its way in this

case if Congress did something that it has'not done and that
is to declare that a Taylor Grazing Act, a permit —- a permit
from Section III of the Taylor Grazing Act — creates a
vested right of property Interest in land.

Since Congress

not only has not done that, it has resisted suggestions that
it should do so and it particularly chose not to.do so
when it had both possibilities in mind.
And I would like to elaborate on that a little bit.
In the 1890’s, ranchers in the west used public land
absolutely as if it were their own and it led to a bad
situation of range warfares and to the destruction of the

10

rangeland through overgrazing.
In 1891> Congress for the first time tried to do
something about it and it passed the Forest Service Act and
included some range land in the Forest Service Act but the
government under the Forest Service Act — that was the
Secretary of Agriculture — would not permit grazing on the
public land except by permits that he would issue for a
limited period of time revocable if the land were needed for
other purposes or if the land were abused.
Now, the ranchers in the west strenuously objected
to this as talcing away their vested right to. use the range
as they saw fit and they brought a case all the way to this
Court, Light versus the United States3 or the United States
versus Light — I think it is 220U.S.

It is cited in our

In Light, this Court strongly upheld the right of

Q

X remember —

MR. SACHSE:
Q

Sir?

— in the western part of the country there

are some places

some land borders a wilderness area and

the wilderness area is one under the Act that cannot be
developed or used or owned by the
recreational purposes.

Federal Government for

Now, the location of that land,

looking out over a wilderness, gives it a very enhanced
market value.

Would you say that that should be not taken

into consideration?
MR. SACHSE:

No, I think that that should be

taken into consideration, that any general environmental
value ought to be taken into consideration but what should
not be taken into —
Q

Well, that would take into consideration,then,

the value of what the government is providing in a wilderness
area?
MR. SACHSE:

That is right and I do not want to

argue — I don’t think it would be right to establish a
broad principle that says that any conceivable value that
the government has added to property is not a subject of
compensation.

What I am arguing is that when Congress has

12
acted and said that a single individual can use a specific
part of the public land, but that he shall have less than a
vested right in that land and, this, which I meant to get to
and I will get to now — and that his vested right, or lessthan-vested right, that permits is a considerable subsidy to
this individual.

It is a right for him to use that land at

less than its value.

If he wanted to rent grazing land from a

private owner, he would have to pay a great deal more than
he does when he pays the government.
Q

But we do

know that the Taylor Grazing rights

are usually available only to contiguous owners.

MR..-'SACHSE:

That is correct.

That is- correct.

They are usually available to contiguous owners., or, I think,
owners in the vicinity or owners with adequate water sources
or such as that.
But our main point here is that Mr. Puller has been
subsidized in a large way through the use of les3 than a
vested right, less than a property right, of public land and
he continues to have that use, in fact.

And'when his land

is taken, to then say the government,.which has paid him a
benefit over the years by letting him use this land is going
to pay him again —
.

Q

*

M

Has he paid anything for the permit?
h

MR. SACHSE:

. *

Ves, sir, he pays something

for the

permit, but the value is generally considered very much less

13
than the true value of the use of the land.
Q

Is It just some nominal sum?

MR. SACHSE:
the Court.

I — well, I wouldn't want to mislead

I think the sums is $8 or $9 a head and I think

that is about a third of the commercial rate, or a fourth
of the commercial rate or something like that.
Q

Going back to this other situation, I suppose

that if a man has a home overlooking Rock Creek Park here in
WAshington or up the Potomac on the Palisades area, the view
that he has is —- contributes to and enhances the value of
the real estate."
MR. SACHSE:

That is correct.

But that does not give him any absolute right

No, it doesn't.

right, I assume, to recover for spoiling hi$view,
MR. SACHSE:
Q

That is correct.

Of course, Mr. Sachs©, in response.to

Justice Douglas' question, you stated that this is a type of
right that the government ordinarily accords only to
contiguous owners and I take it it is also a right that is
a property right that vests in this Individual himself Just
as opposed to the general public's right to go on other parts

public lands is by Congress.
less than a property right?

Is a Congressional enactment
He has a permit to use the

federal lands.
Q

Well, what do you mean when you say "less than

a property right?"
MR. SACHSE:

What I mean is this, that when

Congress set up the Grazing Act, it allov/ed leases of land
to some people and that is clearly a property right.

But as

to the land we are talking about, the Section 3 land, it
provided in the statute — this creates, these permits shall
create "no right, title, or interest in the public domain,"
arid it is clear that in setting up that statute, Congress was
faced with the possibility, if we take these rights away,
should we have to pay for them?

And Congress wanted to say

Q

Some of our big ranches — many of our big

ranches out west have a little nucleus, maybe, of 200 acres
owned in fee by the owners and 50,000 or more acres of
Taylor Grazing Land around it that may sell into the millions
of dollars on the market price.
MR. SACHSE:

That is correct, and I suppose the

second part of that statement would be that if Mr, Puller
is paid less than the market price, he is not getting just
compensation.

When the government takes that land, the

government is taking back land that was its land and the
government should not ha\7e to pay that value and,
Mr. Justice Douglas, in a case of yours some time ago —
this may not be fair to cite — the case was actually
slightly different —
q

Well, If you sit here long enough, you can

always find something to quote against.
MR. SACHSE:

There was a case where the government

took some tugboats — iri Cors versus the United States
Government — took some tugboats during World War II and the
statue under which it took those tugboats said that it
should not pay any value over the value that the — any value

actually, at the time of the taking, were selling

for quite a lot because the government was buying them up and

16
this Court held that a value which the government had itself
created is a value which, in fairness, the government should
not be required to pay.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will'picK"up

after lunch at that point.
(Whereupon, at 12:00 o’clock noon, a recess
v;as taken for luncheon until 1:00 o’clock p.m., the
same day.)

17
AFTERNOON SESSION
MR-. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

1:00 p.m.
Mr. Sachse, you may

continue.
MR. SACHSE:

I just want to make "one or* two points

and then reserve the rest of the time for rebuttal.
Firsts £ want to reemphasize that v/hat we are
dealing with here is a subsidy that Mr. Fuller has already
received in having this grazing permitted at less than its
true value and then an attempt by Mr. Fuller to obtain What
we consider a second subsidization when his base land was
taken.
I want to emphasize also -that the courts of appeal
up to this point have held that if the grazing land is
f i"*’ *

taken first, no compensation needs to be paid and if the
base land is then taken, the the value that the grazing land
might have added is not to be considered.
Q

Well, when you say that the grazing land is

taken first, you are not using that phrase as a word of art,
constitutional "taking,” are you?
You mean if they terminate first?
MR. SACHSE:

If it had been terminated.

If it

liad been terminated.
Q

Or if they let it expire and refused to renew

it.
MR. SACHSE:

That is correct.

18
Q

Rather than take the fee under the conventional

taking process.
MR. SACHSE:

That is correct.

You are proper to

correct me on that because there is no right title or
interest in this* in the grazing land, there is nothing to
take, in the constitutional sense.
Q

I say there is nothing to take.

That is

your argument?
MR. SACHSE:

That is correct.

So it becomes a

very anomalous situation, we think, that when the grazing
land has not yet been taken, when it can still be used in
connection with land that Mr. Puller has;when he still to
some extent is enjoying his subsidy, to then give him this
second subsidization when his own land is taken.
Q

You say he was holding.

In Jaramillo3 it was

dicta, wasn’t it?
MR. SACHSE:

Well, in Cox versus the United States

is the case that I am talking about.

Cox was — it seerns

to me — was the major case that the Tenth Circuit decided
and Cox has clearly said that the value of the grazing land
could not be considered even though after you get to the
real facts in Cox the grazing land had not been taken there,
either, but the Court found that it would be lost as a
result of the taking of the base land.
The Court held there no right to include the

19
special value of the grazing land and Jaramillo, as the
companion ease

wa3 decided immediately after it in the

Court.
Q

Mr. Sachse?

MR. SACHSE:
Q

Sir?

Suppose the Federal Government could improve

the land now being taken, say, with an expensive irrigation
system or something and now the United States wants to take
the land,

would you be. making the argument you are as to the

enhancement of a value?
MR. SACHSE:

I don't know whether 1 would.

I

think that the case before the Court now is a much stronger
case from the United States’ standpoint because here there
was a use of public land Involved.
Now, the case you present would be that the public
improves a man’s private land whether the public then should
have to pay for that improved value and I don't know, I had
rather not try to decide that , one now.
Q

Kow would you distinguish them?

MR. SACHSE:

I would distinguish them that in one

the value added is by a use of public land that is still in
the public domain and that in the other, the value added is
a benefit somehow that the government has made to this man’s
private land.
that more

I would want to look into the details of

20

Q

Most often, such an improvement — if you

could call it that, was one which is shared in common by a
great many people, perhaps people at different but if a new
lake is created, for example, by backing up water with a dam,
it enhances the value, creates lalceshore property out of
what once was a pasture so that is something that is shared
in

common with a great many people, isn’t it?
MR, SACHSE:
Q

That would be so.

Well, what I was thinking of, Mr. Saehse, it

used to be true, 1 don’t know whether it still is; the rural
county in which I lived in New Jersey, the United States
Government used to finance the digging of ponds and irrigation
that way on the local farms in the county, nothing like these
monster farms in the western states, they were smaller farms.
They certainly•added a good deal to the value of that farm.
MR. SACHSE:

Well, X would say thi3„ your Honor,

if that case came up, and say the difference is this, that in
that case the government would move on to private property,
do some work and then leave and the government interest
would be over at that time.

But in this case we are talking about a“ continuing
use of government property and I think that is the fundamental
difference, the right of the government to not have to

I think it is a kind of

21
holding that this Court has already made in the United States
versus Rands and even a whole series of cases dating back
into the 19th century on which Rands was supported.
Q

The mere fact that you have in the past, in

other words, acquired property or part of the property by
gift from the government would not be relevant when at some
later time the government tried to condemn the property.

It

is now your property.
MR. SACHSE:
Q

Correct.

That is the pond case.

MR. SACHSE:
Q

Correct.

And another point is the gift port.

MR. SACHSE:
in this case.

We are not speaking of broad rulings

We are seeking a ruling based upon what

Congress has done in the Taylor Grazing Act, the kind of
interest that Congress gave under the statute,
Q

On the kind of interest, suppose the state

owned this land and had the exact same•agreement with
Mr. Puller?

Would you recognize that?

MR. SACHSE:

If the state owned the land we would

argue that Mr. Puller has less than a compensable interest
in the state land which he held under a tenure that was less
than a lease, In that we would not have to pay for it but —
Q

Why not ?

MR SACHSE:

Because under what I hope are

22
established principles of just compensations the government
only pays for established property rights that a. person
holds 3 not the rights that are less than a type —
Q

Your point is, in fact, that the Federal

Government gave you this gift, as if anybody gave it to him.
Is that your position?

You don’t have to go that far.

.

v * ’•

•

and what I was about to say is that I think our case is much
stronger than the case would be as to state lands because
here the government itself ha3 conferred a special privilege
in a revocable fashion and when the government takes this
land, it seems particularly unfair and not a question of
Just compensation to make the government pay again for the
favor that it did before.
And cattlemen in the west have received, it seems
to me, quite adequate subsidies from the government without
the court creating — malting a single subsidy larger.
I’d like to save the rest of my time for rebuttal.

ORAL ARGUMENT OP PRANK HAZE BURCH, ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. BURCH:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
Counsel has indicated to the Court, I think
erroneously, that — and perhaps inadvertently in response
to the question,that Fuller remained in business and he
de hors
was still operating the ranch. These are statements of yours
4

in the record.

They are not accurate and it simply points

up the danger of applying the Rands analogy to this kind of
case, as I hope I can persuade the Court in ray statement
to you.
Q

Does it really make any difference one way

or the other whether he is still there or whether he is gone?
MR. BURCH:

Only that I think that the possibilities

of less than adequate compensation are present and the
indication would be what Counsel was saying to you, that
the ranch i3 still in existence and operating.

It is not a

fact.
The mere fact of the matter was that the
compensation that was received was not enough to cover the
existing debts.

So it is a thing the Court I don’t think

should consider in any event that it was there and the
statement was inaccurate when it was made for the Court.

remarked on to the Court in oral presentation and which is
briefed is directly a point with Fuller as we understand it
and I think it stands for the propositions not as Counsel
has stated that one must be paid or subsidised* but that it
simply means you can take into consideration in determining
the market value of a ranch* the availability and accessibility
of permit lands and that is really all that the court
instructed.
Judge Craig in the District Court was extremely
careful not to distinguish Rands — which he did not know
about at the time — but to follow Jaramlllo which we consider
to be the law and certainly a vrell-reasoned conclusion.
He did tell the jury* as we pointed out to you*
that they

must recognize the possibility of government

revocation of the permits and the leases and, incidentally*
there is a question I believe Justice — one of the Justices
remarked on — there was state land involved in this.

There

was 30,000 acres of federal lease land, 12,000 acres of state
land which the applicant owned and approximately 1,200 acres
of fee land.

Also, there was some Indication that the reason

BLM did not revoke these leases was the remainder of the fee
land — the fact of the matter is that had nothing to do
with the case at all, it was isolated across the river and
could not be made accessible under any set of circumstances.
Q

Mr. Burch, how was the state land treated in

25
the judge’s charge to the jury, if it was treated at all?
MR. BURCH:

The judge specifically told them that

they could not consider the value of those permits either,
although they were ten-year leases, as I recall.
But I believe X have the full instructions set out
in our brief, Mr. Justice Rehnquist and the court did, in
fact, specifically state that the jury was not to consider

any value given to state or federal permits as the case may
be, whether they were Taylor Grazing Act3, Section 5 leases,
or State of Arizona land leases for agricultural purposes or
grazing purposes.
Q

Well, were those ten-year leases terminable

by the state?
MR. BURCH:

Yes.

So that put3 them in the same posture as an

occupancy sufferance.
MR. BURCH: Somewhat different, Mr. Chief Justice,

that I am unaware of as to whether or not it holds over in
Taylor, but in Arizona, if the state needed that land for
any purpose for a length of time and then put it .back on the

market, the preference would go to that person who had been
the prior lessee or permitee.
r.% '

But nonetheless, X think the court properly
’

f

t

instructed and the jury was properly aware that these values.

26
if there was any value in the permits, must not be
considered and the testimony in the case was quite clear
that those who testified as to value distinguished the permit
land and reduced the total value of the fee land by whatever
they felt wa3 the value of the permit land.
Yes, 1 have a note here that the Court in its
instructions said, "Give to the fee lands such value as the
availability and accessibility of the permit fee land might
create in conjunction with the fee,”
Mow,' the government says —
Q

State and federal.permit lands were treated

alike, then for purposes of fixing dompensation.

MR. BURCH:

Yes, sir.

Coincidentally, the state

was in there to get the value of it3 land in the proceeding,
also, and that was a separate matter which was settled out
of court, ultimately.
We agree with the government that permits for
grazing are not compensable property right but we do not
agree that a jury must take a legal fiction and say they
are not accessible, they are not available, they do not
vexist when, in fact, you have an actual, operating, cow-calf
operation and the government is going to take that operation
' and leave you with the permits,

Now, it does not, then, make a fair compensation

the Improvements that that existing cow-calf operation had.
And

I say it is a cow-calf operation because it

is a distinguishing factor.

This was not some lease of a

large amount of federal acreage where someone ran a steer
operation on the permit lands* bought cows-or calves and

fed them during early spring and they were sold in early
summer.

As the record revealed and as the Court of Appeals

understood;, the fee land was the important reason for the
existence of this ranch.
Q

It wouldn't make any difference to your

argument if that — if the permit land had been used that
way* would it?
•

MR. BURCH:

Ho.

'

<y

‘

As a matter of fact, most of our

appraisers, in their testimony, simply said that the permit
land we put to one side.

The fee land can support somev/here

between 800 and 1,000 cow units per year by reason of Its
•

\,r‘

accessibility of water, its fertileness, its Bermuda grass
pastures, its alfalfa crops and we can suppost X number of
cows.

If you allowed us to consider the permit land, it

would be worth this much more and that is how the testimony

went and that Is how the verdict was arrived at.

, •‘

They did not

consider the permit land as having any value except that it

and grow more feed.
•

Q

...

You are saying the $350,000 award has nothing

28

in it for the enhancement because of permit land?
MR. BURCH:
Q

Precisely.

What about the stipulation on that subject?

MR. BURCH:

The — I say this — and perhaps I

don’t follow the Justice —
Q

No., I thought what you just said whs that

there was a lot of testimony —
MR. BURCH:
Q

Yes, sir.

— and that without laying the permit claims

aside because of the water and -—
'.•4

MR. BURCH:
Q

Yes.

.

— number of head and everything else and I

was wondering if you were implying, in saying that, that the
$350,000 verdict was arrived at without reference to the
value of the permit land.
MR. BURCH:

I think it must have been for the simple

reason that all of our experts testified that the property
had a considerably larger value than that, just the fee land.
Q

Well, you had the instructions to the Jury

that a lot of the jury knew that.
MR. BURCH:

Yes, they were told to consider the

availability of the land, its accessibility, but to give it
no value in coming to their conclusion.
Q

Well, was there some testimony that — aa to

what the value would have been if you didn’t consider the

29
availability and accessibility?
MR, BURGH:
Q

Oh, yes.

Yes> indeed*

And what was that figure?

MR. BURCH:
government’s brief.

It is

cited, I believe, In the

One man, a Mr. Perry, who was an

appraiser, testified that it would be, I think, worth about
$1,150,000 with the permits and approximately $1,000,000
without them.

He gave the permits — the permit on that

land very little value, about $150,000, as I recall.
Q

Mr, Burch, would you say that he

Instructed

the jury to consider the accessibility and availability
but to give it no value?
MR. BURCH:

In the sense that there is no award to

be made for the permit land.

Q

Am I mistaken that there was a stipulation

on this subject somewhere?
Q

On the values?

MR. BURCH:
Q

Oh, no.

No, sir.

Perhaps that —

MR, BURCH:

In fact, the matter of value was quite

bitterly fought.
Q

That is in the subsequent case that they had

a stipulation on alternative values.
MR. BURCH:

Yes, yes.

No, in our case there was

a great hiatus between the appraisers for the owner, Puller,
and the government.
Q

Mr. Burch, I take it the giving of this

instruction by Judge Craig was quite closely contested, the
government objecting —
MR. BURCH:
Q

Yes.

~ to it.

Why did you Insist on having that

instruction if, in fact, your appraisers did not need it?

Or ara I wrong in thinking you are saying your appraisers
didn't need it?
MR. BURCH:

Well,' we wanted to make sure that our

appraisers, Mr, Justice Relinquish, could testify as to
what, in fact, a cow-calf operation was and we wanted to
get before the court and the jury as much information as
possible about the vary nature of the operation.

If it was

31
completely distinguishable — as I have indicated to you —
from a steer operation we felt that any appraiser that got
in and simply said, T,I looked at 1,000 acres of land without
understanding what it was," couldn’t come up with an
intelligent evaluation and we felt that that kind of
testimony in the light of Jaram.illo was absolutely a
necessity, otherwise they would have simply been saying we
have 1,200 acres or whatever the place may be, which we will
pretend is not a cow-calf operation, which is it3 highest
and best use,

I might, at this point, digress for a moment and
remark on Hands and its ultimate effect, I think, upon
ranches and people with riparian fast land holdings.

As I

read the government’s case and as I understand their
position in this matter, their position basically is that
if you are adjacent — in the case of Rands — to a navigable
stream or body of water and you own fee land and it is
condemned by the government, then you cannot consider any
.

.

-

.

. ;.vty.

use that that land might have relating to accessibility to

• f

'■ •

the water — to the navigable stream or body of vlater and
•

.5

•

Counsel says they want a very limited interpretation of
this ease and that its application, peyhaps, by assumption,
then, would be limited.

But in all the western states, in

fact, all of the states in the country bordering on big
rivers, Arison a particularly where I come from, has the

32
Colorado9 a whole city has been built on the Colorado* on
fee land

secured from the State of Arizona and they call it

"Havasu City,"

They built the "London Bridge" there.

That

use is specifically because the Colorado River is there.
If I follow the government’s reasoning in the
application of Rands, what they

are saying is, if it is

•necessary for the Federal Government to go to Havasu City,
take the bridge, the houses, the resorts, the restaurants,
the recreation areas on fee land immediately adjacent to
that river but solely related to the presence of that river,
.they don’t have to pay the fair market value of that land,
they have the legal fiction that because it 13 adjacent to a
navigable stream, it has value only without the application —
Q

Do you think that is what Rands stands for?

MR. BURCH:

Yes, sir.

That is hovj Rands can be

extended, as I read it.
Q

Not since the 1970 legislation.

MR. BURCH:
Q

No, only at that — at adjacent areas.,

Well, let’s get back to Rands itself.

MR. BURGH:
Q

Now,

Yes, sir.
is

this river that you speak about in

Arizona a man-made river?
. MR. BURCH:
Q

No, sir*- *"'""

All right.

Suppose you had a man-made river,
.

’

"

'V ?

a dam and tho usual back-up of water as many of these projects,
and you had great enhancement of the value of land, cities
grew up, resorts, and then for some reason or other, the
United States Government decides that for environmental
i.

•'*.

reasons or others, they are going to terminate the dam?
MR. BURCH:
•

Q

Then they pay full market value, sir.
^

.

.

-;?v

Terminate the dam because the water goes

away?
MR. BURCH:
Q

X beg your pardon.

I don11 follov; you.

I am talking about the water going

away.

The government put it there and now the government is taking
it away.
MR. BURCH:

Xn that inatanoe, Rands would not apply

in any event because it is net a navigable stream, as you
u

understand.

That wouldn’t be the case.

r.s

There, if they

simply took the dam down and went away, the property owner
stands there in the same position he was in before.

He has

received nothing and he has lost nothing because that has
occurred.
Q

Well, whatever he got, he got for nothing and

34
whatever Is taken away is no loss.
MR. BURCH:

Our situation here, of course, is they

came and took the land.

It was not a matter of taking away

the facility.
Q

But do you concede that if the government

had refused to renew the permit at the terminal point a
few months before that the situation would be different?
MR. BURCH:

Only slightly different.

We would

then be talking about a cow-calf operation with 12,000
state acres.
As the case was, we were talking about a cow-calf
operation with 12,000 state acres and 32,000 federal acres
immediately adjaoent.
matter of degree.

So it would only have been a small

As our witness testified, some years

1 on that land that the government states is a Valuable
subsidy, you are lucky if you can run a cow on a section.
That is 640 acres.

Sometimes maybe you get a cow to 1,000

acres*
The answer, if the government feels it: is being
undone by this subsidy is simply to raise the rental, which
I' '

r;

they have every right to do.
We have made comment in our brief to the Court that
there is another point

to be considered in this matter and

that is simply the proposition that, while Rands may control
compensation under a takings — or did control, until the

35
amendment which reduced Its effectiveness, and I think
indicates a congressional change in the onerous rule of
Rands

that , while Rands may control as to riparian fast landss

that Is a situation where the government has exercised its
full authority in the law under the commerce laws of the
Fifth Amendment that in Taylor Grazing Act land» the
government has done something less than making this a full
exercise of its power.
It has said to ranchers9 "If you will go out and
build and develop a ranch"— and that is what occurred In
this Instance — "and you make improvements, we will rent
to you adjacent lands for your use," and in this Instance, I
think the analogy of the Monongahela case — which we cite —
r

,■

said, I believe, as I

recall it though it Is held sometimes
If
basically in the area of estoppel — th&fc/you come In at the
implied or express invitation of the government arid make an
improvement, then you should be compensated for it.

That is

an exception to the fast land cases.
The Twin City case, which we cited to the Court In
our brief specifically holding against, in that instance;
the landowner still stood for the proposition that if there
is this implied consent — if there is this invitation to
come in and use land then the government

must take you as it
.’

,, '• .*

c

finds you when it determines compensation for a taking.
Wa feel that the cases cited to support tho

36
government's position deal basically with loss of possible
future opportunities or

frustrated business opportunities

or a destruction of a business as opposed to a taking of
land, or possibly the loss of a renewal expectancy, when we
are basically talking, in Puller, about the taking of a
thousand acres and the very heart of a cow-calf operation
which could not be restored after the taking and that this
operation had — incidental to its use, of course, it was
a leased land, it wa3 there and existed — the government
leases and the state leases.
We think that the instruction of the District
Court judge i*as a fair one and that it was calculated to
make sure that the owner got just compensation, not a
subsidy, but simply whatever the value of that land was in
the light of his then-existing use and in the light of the
adjacent land to it.
Q

The government is not —

What would you say if the government said that

if it were clear that because of the condemnation within a
year the leases — the permits would be cancelled, there
would be no more permits on that land, in that area?
MR. BURCH:

Well, as I remarked to the Chief

Justice —
Q

Ostensibly except for the condemnation, though,

the land would have sold in the open market, if

things had

gone along as they had, it would have sold at a higher price.

37
MR. BURCH:

If, In fact, the government had just

simply said that to us, BLM says, "No more lease after such
a year," the ranch would have continued in operation.

It

was designed to stay there.and it would have continued until
it became valuable for something else or its highest and
best use became apparent, if there should have been any
change.

The testimony —
Q

But do you agree that if the government had
■

v

cancelled these permits before the condemnation that the
outcome would be different?
MR. BURCH:

I am not certain of that, that monetarily

the outcome would have been any different.

I don’t believe

it would have been.
Q

...

But legally, there would not have been the
: •" •

:f '•

necessity for this
MR. BURCH:

instruction?
I think not, in this respect.

The

court would then undoubtedly have instructed, "We have the
Puller fee land and we have the State of Arizona lease land
and you, jury, are entitled to consider the use of the
■’
f >>

Puller ranch with the state land but you must not give it
any value."

Basically the same instruction that was given.

Now,, under those circumstances* we would

Q

As Justice Marshall put it to you, how can

38
you consider this element if you don't take it into account
and give some value on it?

What is the meanings the real

meaning of that Instruction in the minds of the jurors who
hear it?

Isn't it really a contradictory thing in the light

of what you a^e saying?

Doesn't it tell the jury you can

waive the value of that Taylor Grazing land?
MR. BURCH:

Yes* hut I think it also tells the

jury that if you feel it has no value or that it is
detrimental and reduces the value of this property by the
hazard involved in cancellation, you can take that into
consideration, too.
Q

It cuts both T?ays.

Did the judge tell them about the hazard of

cancellation?
MR. BURCH:

Oh, and the government did too, at

great length.
Q

In arguments?

MR. BURCH:

Yes.

Yes, Indeed.

And there was a

considerable argument as to whether or not this land had
X value, sir, by reason of the fact of these leases and
their intransigence,
Q

so to speak...

.

But isn't it — Isn't the solution to the

problem rather simple for the government If you are right
by having the government pay careful attention to its
Taylor Grazing permits and terminate them all well in advance
of any contemplated taking?

39
MR, BURCH:

Precisely, and it seems to me chat they

would have no trouble doing that, except that —
Q

Then you would be out.

MR. BURCH:

We would be out as far as any fight from

the government was concerned at all.

Then the land would be

paid for on whatever basis the jury determined was adequate and
real.
Q

So the consequence

of that position really is,

isn’t it, that because the government allows the ranchers and
farmers to use the land right up to the time of the actual
taking, the government is penalized for its policy?
MR. BURCH:

I don’t see that the government is

penalised if what it pays is fair market value.

The government

would be penalised if it paid more than the land was worth.
Q

Well, I take it that you agree that you would

not have gotten any such award as you received here if the
government had cancelled or refused to renew the .Taylor

value of the second situation V7as less than the first, even
though they are just valuing the fee lands?

MR. BURCH:

I really don't know what they would

41
would say because each of the four men, I believe, we called,
came to his valuation on

a

diffent basis.

One was a

professional appraiser, one was the owner, one was a rancher*
one was a man skilled in buying and selling ranches.

Each

came up, but each stated to the court and jury that they, in
coming to the final value that they put on the land, did not
consider the permit land because they were instructed not to
and they deducted it from any value’ that they put on the
total property.
Now, there were various figures in the trial of
the issue that they gave to the permits.
Q

What was the government's testimony on the

value of the land without the Taylor Grazing permits?
MR. BURCH:

A government appraiser came to a figure,

I believe, of $136,000 based, not on a cow-calf operation,
however, but based, I think, upon a potential resort
treatment for some area.

He remarked that when the lake was

there it might have attractive possibilities but, actually,
the truth of the matter is that the ground taken was all
going to be under water as the lake arose and subsided, but
that was his determination.

Q

Mr. Buroh, if Mr. Puller had sold his fee

land to another rancher, would the permit

have passed

automatically or would it have been necessary for a new
permit to' be issued?
MR. BURCH:

As a matter of custom, the transfer

would have been approved.

I recall no time when it has not

been, and the large ranch holdings in the west are consistently
sold, small fees, 50, 100, 200 acres along with 20,000 or
30,000 acres of permit land, both state and federal and the
transfer,as a matter of administrative practice, v for many,
many years has been approved,

because that is what the

sale is based on.
Q

But lawyers for buyers rather pedlarly

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MR. HARRY R. SACHSE, ESQ.,

MR. SACHSE;
straighten out.

I just have two things -I want to

First, on the instructions to the jury:

The

judge said, "You may take these permits into consideration in
arriving at your value of the subject land, keeping in mind the
possibility that they may be withdrawn without compensation.*'
So the jury was instructed that they could take
them Into consideration.
Q

Would that be there or only If some appraiser

had an attack, Indicated he had done so or if counsel
argued in the material.

;
t

MR. SACHSE:

I am about to get to that.

A

Q

Okay.

MR. SACHSE:

In the Appendix we submitted,
'v?

we discussed a very small part of the record.

There are

44
four volumes of the record.

We have picked out a few places

wber e references were made to the permit land but it is
all throughout this record that maybe Mr. Burch did pick
the wrong strategy for the

case, but the strategy he

picked was to evaluate the fee land and permit land together
and try to get the value of the permit land.
We would not have had any objection if he said
*

this is a beautiful piece of fee land with water and thus
and thus and thus and so and had left out the business about
the U3e of 30*000 acres of federal land.
Now* here* page 25 of the Appendix* is Mr. Puller
himself

testifying and he is describing his land.

says* ”Well* 'ii>'*had, of course*

He

the fine water and the very-

fine climate for growing the kind of crops that we have to
have.

Then* we

have the soil which is not: quite so

important but still is necessary.”

He says;* "Then we have

te availability of federal land'as well as state land."
*

Q

Mr. Sachse, if an appraiser had got on the
•i *

stand and testified about the value of this, just this fee
land and it sounded rather large, I would expect that you, on
cross-examination, vrould ask him if he took into account the
enhancement from permit lands, wouldn’t you?
MR, SACHSE:

I don’t know.

I f we had gotten

instruction from —
Q

Well, you would.

You would.

X would think you

45
would,

if that appraiser testified to a value far in excess

of what the government’s testimony was.
MR. SAGHSE:

Well, I think there is such testimony

in the record of this case, where the lands were treated
together and the government, on cross-examination, tried to
