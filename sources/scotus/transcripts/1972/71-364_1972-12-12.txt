MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Hr. Attorney General, you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW P. MILLER, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. MILLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
As Attorney General of the Commonwealth, I am here
today representing its State Board of Elections in these
cases.

I think it. might be helpful if at the outsat I sketch

very briefly the factual background involved here due to the
complexities of that background.
Under the revised Virginia Constitution, Article II,
Section 6, reapportionment, unlike many States, was required
in 1971.

Under schedule of that Constitution, Section 5, the

Virginia General Assembly was required -to convene in session
on January 6, 1971, for the purpose of reapportionment.
As a result, two Acts were adopted;

The first,

Section 24.1-12.1, establishing 52 districts for the Virginia
House of Delegates.

There are 100 members of that body.

plan consisted of single member districts, multi-member
districts, and floater districts.

This

4
Also, Section 24.1-14.1 establishing 40 single­
member districts for the 40-member Senate of Virginia.
As soon as these Acts were approved on March 1,
1971, they were forwarded to the Attorney General of the
United States pursuant to the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
There were three suits brought,, ana I will touch
on them to the extent they are relevant here.
First, on March 8 by Hr. DuVal alleging failure to
provide equal representation, and also objecting to multi­
member districts as such.
By Mr. Parris who is not hare today alleging failure
to provide equal representation and seeking the creation of
a single multi-member district in Fairfax County rather than
the two multi-member districts consisting of 5 delegates each
which were created by the General Assembly.

That case was

filed on March 22.
On March 2, Lieutenant Governor Howell who is here
this day also filed a suit, again alleging failure of equal
representation.

But that suit was limited to the Fifth,

Sixth, and Seventh Senate Districts.

Those districts are

located in Norfolk and a portion of Virginia Beach.

As I

said earlier, they are single member districts and cut. across
jurisdictional lines.
In addition, the cities of Virginia Beach and Norfolk
intervened.

Mr. Frazier is here representing the city of

5

Virginia Beach this morning.

The city of Norfolk is not.

represented by counsel.
And there were a group of plaintiff intervenors
taking the position that multi-member districts were
inappropriate because of the fact that they constituted a
dilution of the Negro vote.

Mr. Howell in his case took the

opposing position, that in fact the creation of single member
districts represented in the Norfolk-virginia Beach area a
dilution of the Negro vote.
I want to emphasize the contrast that we have her©
because it shows how peculiarly these considerations are ones
which a legislature such as the General Assembly of Virginia
has a great difficulty in solving.

There are different points

of view with respect to multi-member and single member
districts.

There are different points of view as to what the

effects of the creation of these districts are.
So the General Assembly was faced

with an exceedingly

difficult task.
The lower court found that variations existed in
the plans which exceeded what the court considered permissible
limits on the basis of numbers only.

As to the House of

Delegates, the court proceeded to draw its o\m plan rather
than allowing the General Assembly to proceed once the
constitutional guidelines had been established to the court.
And the same thing occurred with respect to the Senate.

6

The court’s House of Delegates plan fragmented
various governmental entities within the Commonwealth,
shifted one delegate from the Tidewater area to Northern
Virginia, denied Mr. DuVal's prayer for single member districts,
denied 14r. Parris' prayer for a large multi-member district
in Fairfax County.

The plan itself resulted in a variation

from norm,of some 10.27 percent.

This is the court plan.

i

As for the Senate, the Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh
.

'. *

Districts which I referred to, the court found that the
population of those districts were almost at the norm, but
because of a housing sample relating to some 36,000 sailors
who were counted by the census in Norfolk, because of the
fact that the ships they are on are home ported at Norfolk,
this census showing that some 21,000 of these individuals
had addresses outside of the Fifth Senatorial District in
which the naval base is located established a multi-member
district consisting of the Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Senatorial
Districts.

In other words, those districts were combined

into a single district which, of course, represented an
anomaly as far as the Senate plan is concerned because otherwise
it was completely a single district plan as desired by the
General Assembly.
I want to mention before I proceed further certain
dates because I think they will set the background for what
I will be addressing myself fco\

7
On May 7 — I already mentioned that the plans x^ere
forwarded to the Attorney General of the

United States —

the Attorney General filed with the State objections under
the Voting Rights Act in two respectss

One, the division

line between Senate Districts 5 and 6 I have just referred to
and also to the five multi-member districts in the House,
that objection being based on the lover court decision in
the case of Chavis v, Whitcomb.
On May 10, the General Assembly reconvened, but.
this Court had not decided the Chavis case, the lower court
had not acted, and consequently the General Assembly recessed
to await the Chavis decision and to give it time for the
court to act with respect to the suits which were pending
before it.
On May 24, the court entered an order on first
hearing which said in essence that on or before June 15, 1971,
Virginia was to adopt and submit to the Attorney General of
the

United States curative legislation with respect to the

two objections I have just mentioned.

If that were not done

by that date, then the court would proceed to trial.
On June 3 the General Assembly came back into
session.

Senate Bill 125 was introduced to cure the Attorney

General's objections to the Senate plan which constituted the
drawing of a single plan between the Fifth and Sixth Districts.
And then the General Assembly recessed until June 7 to await

8

this Court's decision in Chavis v. Whitcomb.
On June 7, Chavis v. Whit corah was decided.

The

Attorney General of the United States withdrew his objections
to the House plan.

The General Assembly passed Senate Bill 125

curing the objection with respect to the Senate line in
Districts 5 and 6.

Consequently the court's order, which X

referred to, on May 24 was fully complied with.

So the General

Assembly recessed until August 16, subject, of course, to
being reconvened earlier for the court to decide the issues
before it.
On June 16 there was such a

hearing.

On July 2 the court in its order found the plans
constitutionally defective, but instead of permitting the
General Assembly to come back into session and to act on the
guidelines established in the court's opinion as to what in
fact would be a constitutionally appropriate reapportionment
plan, proceeded to mandate one itself.
On July 8 the General Assembly reconvened, directed
the Attorney General of the Commonwealth to appeal the case
to the Supreme Court of the United States, and adjourned since
there was nothing further which the General Assembly of
Virginia could do under those circumstances.
Just today we start a second round or second decade
of reapportionment litigation with the hope that guidelines
may be established in order that States throughout the

9
country will not be faced with subsequent rounds of litigation
as to what in fact is constitutionally permitted in terms of
the drawing of legislative district, lines.
I want to address myself for a few minutes to the
House plan, then to the Senate plan, and then I will cease at
that point and Mr. Frazier will deliver his argument.
With respect to the House, the lower court's
decision was based on numbers and numbers alone when it struck
down the validity of the Virginia House of Delegates plan.
The lower court, relying on this Court’s previous decisions in
Kirkpatrick and Wells, both of course being congressional
redistricting cases, not state legislative cases, found
variations exceeding those which were struck down in those
two cases.
How, if numbers must be the sole criteria of the
Virginia plan, we submit that the Court should not have looked
only at the maximum variation of plus 9.6 percent and minus
6.8 percent, depending on the calculation of the floater
district concept.

It should have considered that of 52 House

districts, 35 were within 4 percent of the norm, that of 52
. *

House districts only two exceeded S percent, that of 52 House
districts the average deviation from the norm was only 3.8
percent, that of the 52 House districts the majority of the
delegates elected by or in those districts would be elected
by 49.3 percent of the population of the State.

10

We further submit that numbers and numbers alone
viewed in the manner in which the lower court viewed them on
the overall aspect as I have just presented them to you
cannot be what this court meant in Reynolds v. Sims when it
stated that one man one vote means an individual is entitled
to fair and effective representation.

That is the constitutional

criteria \diich we submit must be met.

It cannot be

numerically measured alone for purposes of state legislative
reapportionment.

But it can bs, we submit, measured by a

two-pronged test.
One, is the apportionment, of the House in question
based on the permissible standard?
Two, does the plan approach population

equality

as closely as possible in consistency with that rationale?
The rationale of the Virginia plan is very simple.
It is one suggested by this Court that a State can accord
political subdivisions some independent representation in at
least one body of the state legislature as long as the basic
standard of equality of population among districts is maintained.
That was the rationale adopted in Virginia, and
today it is more important than ever before under the newly
adopted Virginia Constitution, because under this Constitution
which went into effect in 1971, counties of which we have 95
in the State, as well as cities, are given the opportunity
to have enacted for them numerous local or special legislation

11
applicable to specific problems which that jurisdiction as
a jurisdiction may be confronted with.
Now, the second test that we suggest was also met.
The lower court specifically found that disparities in the
Virginia plan cannot be reduced at all if the integrity of
political subdivisions are mandated.

No plan has been

presented which keeping intact local political subdivision
boundaries for one house of a bicameral legislature achieves
closer population equality.
How, then, can the lower court's decision as to the
House plan be upheld?

only in two ways, neither of which are

sustainable in tills instance.
First, if the court finds that the rationale of
the Virginia plan is one that is not permissible or is one
t

that was not rationally applied.

According political subdivisions

independent representation is, we submit, permissible.

The

policy of Virginia in this regard was rationally applied.
ing

Apply­

DuVal*s argument that there is no provision in the

Virginia Constitution allowing independent representation
ignores a basic constitutional principle, and that is that a
state constitution is a document of limitations.

Nothing in

Virginia's Constitution prohibits according political subdivi­
sions independent representation.
Virginia has not abandoned her policy, a traditional
policy of according political subdivisions independent

12

representation.

She did change this policy as far as the

Senate is concerned, but clearly in line with this Court.'s
language in the opinion in Reynolds v. Sims, this does not
mandate abandonment of this policy in the House also.

In

fact, the design of Virginia's reapportionment was to balance
the two houses of her General Assembly in this respect.
The only other manner in which the decision of the
lower court can be sustained is that this Court new decides
that the principles of congressional redistricting are also
applicable to legislative redistricting.
not.

For if

it

We submit they are

were numbers and numbers alone which we

are concerned with, there would be no need to determine
whether various rationales suggested by this Court, in
previous opinions could be applied, because the only rationale
would be numbers.

There would be no need to determine whether

one house of a bicameral legislature balances inequities in
another house.
For this Court to make applicable to legislative
redistricting the congressional redistricting decisions would
repudiate its past, enunciation that numbers and numbers alone
though most important are not the sole criteria, that a
balancing concept of a bicameral legislature is constitutionally
acceptable, and that the maintenance of political subdivisions
is a permissible rationale.
Congressional rodistricting allocating representatives

13
to Congress is entirely different from allocating Stete
Delegates for each State's legislative processes.

The relation­

ship of congressional districts to the Federal Government
simply cannot be compared with that of legislative districts
to a state government

for reasons I have previously assigned.

There is on© other way in which the court's
decision below may be sustained, and that is for this Court
to agree with everything that has been stated here today
but then to state that nonetheless percentage variation is
impermissible, that the percentage is too much.

But for this

Court to say that would be saying it on the basis of numbers
and numbers alone.

For we have already demonstrated that

Virginia has applied a permissible rationale in a consistent
manner and we have com© as close to population equality as
possible in conformity with that rationale.
The last aspect of the lower court's decision which
affected the House of Delegates plan.jvas the removal of the
Delegate from the Tidewater area to Northern Virginia.

This

was done essentially on the basis of projected population
growth.

The Virginia General Assembly did not use population

projections, and this non-use, we submit, is permissible.
In any event

you apply the population projections only in

one part of the State rather than utilize them consistently
and rationally throughout the State clearly is contrary to
the ad hoc application which this Court discouraged in

14
Kirkpatrick.

I do not have to stand here and argue why the

General Assembly did not use population projection as
seen in the appendix at page 66.• The projection is on the
basis of fertility assumptions, industrial development, present
and planned highways, and many other considerations, all cf
which the General Assembly felt too speculative for proper
utilization.
As far as the Senate is concerned, there is one
simple issue.

Hay apportionment tbe based on the decennial

census, or must it be based on a sample housing survey
conducted by a review of zip' codes?
Virginia adopted two policies with respect to the
Senate.

The first policy was that the entire Senate would

consist of single member districts.

One does not have to

read many cases to coma to the conclusion that this is a
matter peculiarly within the expertise of various State
legislatures.
And the second choice that Virginia made was the
adoption of a total population apportionment base.

Obviously

there are various bases which a State might adopt.

But in

Virginia the intent

as demonstrated in the debates of the

Virginia constitutional revision as quoted in our reply brief
on page 8 was for redistricting to include every human being
living and counted by the decennial census of the United
States Government

15
That means that the lower court, was faced with what,
we submit were two valid constitutional policies.
both.

It ignored

It found that the apportionment, base was not proper

simply because a sample zip code housing survey showed that,
of the 36,000 sailors enumerated aboard vessels, approximately
50 percent had addresses outside the Fifth Senatorial District.
If the court had bothered to consistently apply the
sample housing survey, it would have seen that the survey
at. least purported to show that not only 18,000 had addresses
outside the Fifth Senatorial District, but that approximately
half of these addresses, in other words, 9,000 or 9,500 were
outside of the Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Senatorial District
because they lived in other jurisdictions in the Hampton Roads
area, the cities of Portsmouth and Chesapeake, the cities
of Newport News and Hampton.

I think it is well settled that

a State has great latitude in choosing its own apportionment
bass.

I submit that the base chosen by Virginia is

constitutionally permissible and consequently should be
approved by this Court.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Frazier.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HARRY FRAZIER, III, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. FRAZIER:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

16

The city of Virginia Beach stands shoulder by
shoulder with the Commonwealth of Virginia in upholding the
General Assembly's House redistricting plan and in urging the
reversal of the District Court decision in this case.

The

city of Virginia Beach is not involved in the Senate side of
the controversy.
Our position here this morning is that a state
r©apportionment plan should be judged not solely on mathematical comparisons, but it should be judged also on the
quality of the representation it affords the people.
Wow, it seems to us that this Court cannot uphold
the District Court below without overruling a great deal of
what this Court said in Reynolds v. Sims.

The District Court,

plan itself contains significant deviations from population
equality without any policy justification whatsoever.
District Court said in its opinion thiss

The

"While we have

endeavored to reach a perfect mathematical division, we have
been unable to do so because of the multiplicity of delegates,
geography of the State, and the diversity of population
concentration."
So if you look at numbers and that’s all the District
Court did, its own plan comes up with a variation of 10 percent.
But no basis for that was given, no effort. wa3 made to
justify that kind of variation at all.

As the Attorney

General has pointed out, the greater variation in the Virginia

17
plan was the result of a rational basis, a desire to preserve
the integrity of political subdivisions and to give them an
effective voice in one house of the General Assembly.
Wow, if the. District Court was serious in what it
said and was going to abide by the numbers alone, it could
have done a whole lot better job than it did.

So without

being able to do better than it did and without affording
any basis whatsoever for its position, we think its plan must
fall.
QUESTION:

Mr. Frazier, wouldn’t there be some

question as to the propriety of the District Court being a
source of policy judgments as to xvhat. factors are to be
considered other than numbers?
MR. FRAZIER:

Very definitely.

We feel that this

Court has leaned over backwards on occasion after occasion
to say that policy decision is one for the legislature, not
for the District Court at all.

And we propose to emphasize

this in several ways before we are through today.

But we feel

and one of our arguments is that is a fundamental violation
of due process when the Distxict Court arbitrarily took the
bit in its teeth and said, "This is your plan."

This, we

think, is a second but very important, phase of the problem
before the Court today.
Now, returning to the basic problem of state
reapportionment, we think that a fundamental principle here is

18
that Reynolds rejects mathematica1 precision as a constitutional
requirement and recognizes the validity of representation of
political subdivisions as such.
QUESTION:

As I understand your position, Mr.

Frazier, it is that there is a substantial difference between
what is constitutionally required under Article I, Section 2,
with respect to congressional apportionment or districting
from what is required under the Fourteenth Amendment of the
Constitution and specifically the equal protection clause with
respect to reapportionmant of state legislatures, and that
this Court has consistently recognized that difference.

Is

that your position?
MR. FRAZIER:
QUESTION:

That is our position.

And that Wasberry v, Sanders, which was

based on Article I, Section 2, illustrates that, and
particularly when one reads Mr, Justice Clark's opinion
differing from the Court saying that in Wesberry v, Sanders
he would apply the different test of the equal protection
clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
MR. FRA2IER:

And as that is brought down to date in

Kirkpatrick, the phrase "as nearly as practicable" appears
whereas in Reynolds construing the equal protection clause it
is "substantial equality."
What we are faced with today, I believe, is the
first, opportunity the Court has had to decide the question:

What way are we headed in the decade of the 1970's?

Do they

mean the same thing, these phrases, or do they not?

We, of

coarse, submit that they do not.
Wow, we find that there is no place, no valid place,
in the Congress of the United Statas for representation of
political subdivisions as such, because in Congress we are
concerned with the formulation of national policy, and the
interests of the States are being represented, yes, but cities
counties, we do not see that there is any basis that we can
argue here for saying that they need to be separately heard.
And X think this is evidenced by the historical fact that
for the first 50 years of our country you had at large repre­
sentations in many congressional districts.
But there is a place in the State for this type of
representation, and we think this Court specifically so stated
in Reynolds, "Local government entities are frequently charged
with various responsibilities incident to the operation of
state government.

In many States much of the legislature’s

activity involves the enactment of so-called local legislation
directed only to the concerns of political subdivisions." We
see no reason why that is not as valid today as it was in
1964.
And when we look at the Commonwealth of Virginia
and the session of its General Assembly most recently held,
104 of 133 local bills were introduced in the House of

20

Delegates.

This is where the localities find their primary

voice and their primary source of representation.

So that,

we think, has a rational basis to support it.
We feel that, there are numbers of phrases, points,
in the Reynolds decision that must be overlooked, swept under
the rug, if the decision of the lower court is to be upheld.
Now, what is the result of affirming that decision
of the lower court?

First, reapportionment will then be

reduced to a mathematical exercise.

If this Court is to say

today Kirkpatrick governs congressional and state reapportionment, then all we have got to do is become a slave to numbers,
maybe even to computers, and little judgment, will be exercised,
as Mr. Justice Rahnquist pointed out policy decisions will no
longer be permitted, and how you structure at least, one-half
of the legislature, either half of the legislature, you do it
by the numbers.
Then we will be concerned only with the extremes of
the variations in the numbers.
Court did here.

And that’s what the District.

It took the most overrepresented and the

most, underrepresented and added up the percentages and said,
"That’s bad, we can't have it.

You do it our way, and this

«, •

is our plan."
But what happens here?

You have no equality of

representation, no consideration of who the people in a given

21

jurisdiction can vota for.

bicameral legislatures.

Political subdivisions will be
This smacks of rendering obsolete

What will be the difference between

the Senate and the House of Delegates in the Commonwealth of
Virginia or any other of the States?

The differences would

merely be how long members are elected for and how many
people they represent, the size of the districts.
The only validity that I can see for affirming the
District Court would be to achieve the uniformity in congres­
sional and State reapportionment mechanics.

Possibly this

would cut down on the amount of litigation.

I'm not a bit

sure that it would.
doing this?
tion.

But what is the price that, you pay for

We think there is a loss of equality of representa­

We think the fallacy of the District Court numbers

game is demonstrated very clearly in the case of the City of
Virginia Beach.

What happened in Virair*» Bea^h?

The General Assembly's plan though it was not
perfect — according to Mr. DuVal’s theory of valuing floater
delegates, Virginia Beach was underrepresented by 7.3 percent.
The District Court reduced that underrepresentation to
approximately 2.5 percent.

But it took 29,000 Virginia Beach

citizens, put them over into Norfolk's multi-member district
where they now vote with 307,000 people in a 7-momber district.
if

So what has happened to the equality of the representation for
those 2&000 people?

They are not a part of Virginia Beach,

22
they must vote for Norfolk.

And how will the delegates in

the General Assembly from Norfolk feel if a matter comes
before the General Assembly that pits the interests of
Norfolk against that of Virginia Baach?
not going to go with the 29,000.

Obviously, they are

They are going to go with

the 307,000.
The District Court has sacrificed the community
interests of Virginia Beach.
Now, tiiis i3 done, too, in the Senate, because
40,000 of Virginia Baach people in the Senate district are
combined with 75,000 Norfolk citizens in the multi-member
district — I'm sorry, in what started out as a single
member district.

It is now a multi-member district, 40,000

Virginia Beach citizens and 307,000 Norfolk citizens, the same
sort, of thing.
Now, we could live

with this in the Senate.

We

find it hard to live with in both houses where the discrimina­
tion against Virginia Beach is so pointed.

One way to have

solved this, if the Court is the final arbiter of these
political decisions, is not to take 29,000 from Virginia
Beach and put them over in Norfolk's multi-member district,
it would have been to move one seat to Virginia Beach and
take 13,000 Norfolkians and put them into the Virginia Beach
thing to reverse the flow, if you will, to balance some
equities.

But the court didn't do that.

23

This comes back to the question of remedies, to the
question of policy on which the city of Virginia Beach had
no say.
But coming back to the subject of community interest,
to making effective representation in the General Assembly
for political subdivisions, Norfolk and Virginia Beach sit
side by side.

They are different types of cities, they have

different problems.

The city of Norfolk in its brief has

painted this picture very clearly, much more clearly, I am
afraid, than I could have done.
It is pointed out that the interests of

budding

political subdivisions can bs adverse, and then it lists
areas in which they are adverse.

In the question of water

supply or the regulation of water rates and services,
has got all the water, Virginia Beach has none.

Norfolk

Virginia

Beach has to rely on Norfolk for water services, and in
matters of this area legislative policy is involved, their
interests are different.
The piggy-back income tax is something that Norfolk
would desperately like to have, as would any core city,
Virginia Beach, of a different nature, would not like to have.
So community interests are sacrificed not only in
Virginia Beach, the case that I am concerned with, but they
are sacrificed everywhere that the District Court has moved
lines around to disregard the integrity purposefully accorded

24
political subdivisions by the General Assembly.
Nothing has been given in return for getting
mathematical equality,

there are at least 9 countie55 and

2 cities in the State that, have suffered by having bunches
9

of their people arbitrarily put here or there by the District
Court plan.
So Virginia Beach is a prime example of what happens
when the political subdivisions are ignored in this instance.
Now, coming to the remedies in the case, there are
many remedies that, were available here if the District Court
had found the General Assembly's plan to have been invalid.
QUESTION:

Before you wind this up, I read the

brief of the city of Norfolk, an appellee in this case.

As

I under stand it, the city is not. going to be represented hare
on oral argument today, or is it?
MR. FRAZIER;

I understand that it is not being

It is an appellee rather than amicus,

but it's not going to be represented on oral argument today.

.

You referred to that brief and to it.s dramatic presentation
of the basic differences between Virginia Beach and Norfolk.
Do you understand that brief?

Do you understand

what they are asking the Court to do?
MR. FRAZIER:

I think they have sort of turned

around and joined our team.

25

QUESTION:

It's hard for me to tell in an appellee's

brief just what position they have taken.

Is someone going

to explain that to us?
MR. FRAZIER:

Well, I think the reason they are not

being represented orally is the limitation on the number of
counsel permitted to argue.
QUESTION:

I would trust somebody would — maybe

other people understand this brief, but I didn't.
MR. FRAZIER:

Well, I interpreted it to mean this:

Certainly Norfolk is not going to concede our point that
it should suffer any loss of representation for the gain of
Virginia Beach.
QUESTION:

That's quite understandable, of course.

MR. FRAZIER;

Quite understandable.

They also

recognise the importance that we lay stress on for representa­
tion of local government in one house of the legislative body,
and they are pointing out in an effective way the particulars
in their case where interests of Virginia Beach and Norfolk
are so different.
QUESTION:

That is my understanding of —
And what is their position as to what

they think the Court ought to do?
MR. FRAZIER:

I think their position is that the

General Assembly’s plan was acceptable and should have been
upheld, and this is a justification in terms of their
particular circumstances for upholding the General Assembly’s

26

plan and reversing the District Court.
Now, my time is approximately up.

What I wanted to

get back to is the matter of remedies which in the importance
of the substantive area can so easily be overlooked.

What we

are saying here is that the General Assembly should have been

was needed.

The General Assembly was standing by willing to

It could act quickly.

It was not accorded that, time.

At the

worst the court could have said, "All right, hold your 1971
elections under this plan, but fix it the next time."

And

that is what it specifically approved in the Arizona case,
Ely v. Klahr, where three successive reapportionment plans
had been declared unconstitutional and the District Court
still said, "O.K., hold it under this invalid plan, fix it
for next time."
How, even if the District Court should be so bold
as to write its own plan, the basic concepts of due process
required that you at least give the parties an opportunity to
be heard.

Here there was no indication as to what the court

would do on this case.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HENRY E. POWELL, JR., ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. HOWELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and Justices:

I represent the plaintiffs in the suit that was
filed on March 3 challenging the validity of a certain portion
of the Senate reapportionment by counselor Peter Babalas of
Norfolk.

Our case was separate but we have'come up here on

a unitary opinion that dealt with two separate cases.
At the outset, if your Honors please, it is awfully
important to know that the Constitution of Virginia was
changed since the day that I had the privilege of sharing the
side with the distinguished attorney Mr. Edmund Campbell and
argue Mann v. Davis.
When we argued Mann v. Davis that rule that governs
reapportionment of Congress that the "districts shall be
contiguous, compact, and contain as nearly as practicable the
same number of inhabitants," was contained in one section of

28

our Constitution, and that language was not. invited in
another section which merely says we should reapportion the
state legislature every ten years.

But when the people went

to the polls in 1970 to amend the Constitution, they dictated
that the same test for congressional reapportionmant govern
state legislative raapportionment.
So if this distinguished tribunal has taken the
Virginia case to hand down a ruling that there should be more
give in tbs joints when it comes to cutting the legislative
pie into a hundred slices than there should be in the slicing
of the congressional pie into 10 slices, it's the wrong case.
We cited in our brief •—
QUESTION:

We're not dealing here with the Virginia

We are dealing with the Federal Constitution.

HR. HOWELL:

So any case is the right case when we

are talking about if that issue is presented under the
Federal Constitution.

Bryan pointed out that the Fourteenth Amendment, mandate in
Virginia had been underscored so that in our Constitution we

QUESTION:

We are concerned here with the Federal

constitutional validity of what your legislature did, isn’t

29

that correct?
MR. HOWELL;

If your Honor please, I arn submitting

that when our Constitution says that "The House of Representa­
tives of the United States and the members of the Senate and
the House of Delegates shall be elected from districts
established and every district shall be composed of contiguous,
compact territories and shall be so constituted as to give
as nearly as practicable representation in proportion to the
population of the district," that in that State there can
be no constitutional difference in what measures up to the
test of "nearly as practicable."
QUESTION;

(

Am X wrong in understanding that the issue

here is the Federal constitutional validity of what your Virginia
legislature did.

Now, maybe your legislature violated your

own State Constitution, but that’s no concern to us here.
MR. HOWELL;

Right.

We will not chase that rabbit,

if your Honor please, because it is not necessary.
In the Senate case we have a plan at war with the
Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States
in every reapportionment opinion that has ever been handed
down by this Court.
And at that point, if your Honor please, X would
ask the Court to pull out of the appendix a map of the city
of Norfolk because we are a distinctive city.

There may be

a few other cities that can brag about being the largest

That could be —

Excuse me, Mr. Chief Justice.

The middle district was District 6.

And then

the remainder is District 7.
Now, we are focusing attention on the unconatitutionality of District. 5.

Behind a fence that has to be there

for security purposes, the United States Census delegated to
the Navy Department the task of enumerating sailors.

Well,

the Navy has enough trouble of its own without undertaking the
100 years of experience the Department of Commerce has
acquired through the Census Department.

So you will find in

the exhibits, if your Honor please, a typical military approach
to taking the census.
signed

They summoned all aboard the ships,

a certificate as to how many crew members

were

assigned to vessels home ported in this example at Norfolk,
Virginia, on the day we take the census, count them as if they
lived aboard the ship and had no family homes in the Norfolk
area.
And in that mandate — and I do not blame the Depart­
ment of the Navy.

If I criticize anybody, I would criticize

31
the Census Department for delegating to the Navy a very
sophisticated task, and that is of counting the total number
of inhabitants within the United States of America.
But having seen that we have 50,000 people behind
that fence, if we were to just take this arbitrary census
tract, Census Tract 000999 consists of these little white
lines projecting out into the Elizabeth River known as the
piers of the naval base.

And we have as an exhibit the total

number of vessels that were home ported at the pier.

And

there were 38,000 people that were considered as being
residents along these piers, when in fact — we are not just
relying upon the testimony of Professor Reed who had some 30
years experience as a census enumerator and whose documents
are well established in the transcript, but we had uncontra­
dicted testimony of Admiral Cobb who was the Commandant of
the Fifth Naval District and Mr. Bernard Michel, the
Assistant Administrator for Management to the Fifth Naval
District, and both of them testified without contradiction
that at least 50 percent of the people that were counted in
0009 along those piers actually lived with their families,
their wives and children, in other sections of the general
area.
So if your Honor please, unless we are going to
'i

•>

subscribe to a phantom population as being in compliance
with what I think is a magnificent principle that restored

32

representative government throughout this nation in State
legislative bodies and in Congress, too, if we go for phantom
populations, we have destroyed the vitality of "one person one vote" and then you will see all kinds of phantom schemes
for artificially complying with having "as nearly as
practicable

the same number of inhabitants."

QUESTION:
Howell?

How far would you like us to go, Mr.

Your claim here is that it was unconstitutional to

accept census figures for the reason that you have explained
that the census figures with respect to a certain district
in Norfolk ware invalid and unsound and inaccurate because
the census with respect to that district delegated the job
to the Navy which did it by counting the number of men on the
ships.
I understand your claim as to why the census figures
were invalid.

And you therefore say that it was unconstitu­

tional to accept census figures.

Now, does that mean that

in every case it's up to the courts or the legislature to go
behind the census figures and if they find that for some reason
or another they think they are inaccurate, that they are not
allowed to follow them?
MR. HOWELL:

If your Honor please, the enumeration

of the total number of inhabitants was sufficient for the
purpose of the census.

The census was first taken in 1790

for the sole purpose of reapportioning Congress.

And the

33

uncontradicted testimony of Conrad Taeuber is that there is no
factor considered in the taking of the census that is relevant
to state legislative reapportionment.
And so I say to you that the enumeration of the total
number of inhabitants within the Second Congressional District
was entirely accurate because all they had to do was be
spread through that total area.

And these people were there,

either on ships or living in apartments and houses with their
wives and children like every other American who has a job on
land.
What I say is that, when you have a substantial
impact of people who might fall in the category of sailors
and the State doesn't want to take the time to find where they
actually live, whether they live aboard ship or live with
their wives and children, you diffuse it by at large
elections.
QUESTION:
where it. leads.

I understand your argument, but I wonder

You say a State is not constitutionally

permitted to use the figures of the United States Census.
MR. HOWELL:
QUESTION:

Not when they are artificial.
Can anybody come in and say these census

figures are artificial or inaccurate and require a court to
make its own census or a state legislature to make its own
census?
MR. HOWELL:

Not any —

34
QUESTION:
MR. HOWELL:

What ±3 the U. S. Department of Census for?
•— Justice Stewart, but any case where we

establish -- the opinion of Judge Albert Bryan which I don’t
ii'

believe can be blinked away said that, if your Honor please,
"the remainder with their families reside for the most part
in othsr sections of the city of Norfolk."

He stated that it

was factually without dispute that only 8,100 of the 30,693
were within the Fifth Senatorial District.

So we have an

undisputed fact of the eminent three-judge court.

And I say

that this Court is not going to start throwing factual findings
of a lower court to the four winds.

And we come here in the.

rare position of having Judge Albert Bryan saying it. was an
undisputed fact that the people just weren’t there.

The

ridicularity of going for this artificial population count,
a count that was adopted by Senate Privileges and Elections
as a matter of convenience would be if you would have single
member House districts in Norfolk, you would have 50,000
military people behind a fence entitled to a Delegate.
you would elect Admiral Cobb, I assume
men would elect Admiral Cobb.

So

most of the enlisted

And then when we called the

session of the General Assembly, he would be out in the South
Pacific responding to a breakout in the Far East if everything
doesn’t go all right.

And this would be absolutely ridiculous.

How, the House of Delegates recognised that and
went for at large district®. In a military area like Norfolk

35
you have to count these people because they are just as much
interested in their children living in Rhode Island Park or
Commodore Park in Norfolk, they are just as much interested
in them having good schools.

They want good roads to travel

on in Norfolk and Virginia until they get inside the naval
base, and then Uncle Sam has good roads.

They are not worried

about what’s inside the fence, they are worried about, what's
on the outside of the fence.
QUESTION:

Mr. Howell, do you agree that this

constituted a collateral attack on the census figures?
MR. HOWELL;

No, sir.

The census figures were not

put together to assist in state legislative reapportionment.
If Congress wants to give a mandate to the census and give
them the money and the people, Mr. Conrad Taeuber and whoever
may be the Secretary of Commerce — it was Mr. Stans at the
time of this particular taking — they will ba happy to
compute, get figures for legislative reapportionment.
I am saying that these figures are 100 percent
correct for allocating the 10 Congressmen in Virginia, because
you are slicing the pie in such large pieces that you diffuse
the military population whether they be hanging on the end
of the convoy escort pier or living in a townhouse over in
the Seventh District.
QUESTION:

So you are in this case doing exactly,

aren't you, what the Chief Justice’s question suggests.

You

36

are saying that: the Constitution requires that we do not
accept the census figures for purposes of this case.
that your point?

Isn’t,

Ara I wrong?

MR. HOWELL:
QUESTION:
MR. HOWELL:

Absolutely not.

You’re entirely wrong.

Mow, tell me why.
It's jxist as if you were to walk out

here to get a little breath of air following this hectic day
here in this distinguished tribunal and you saw a black round
sphere laying in a field, and wanting to play a little touch
football with Justice Byron White, you picked it up and threw
it to him and when he caught it it exploded.

It was good as

a bomb, but it was poor as a football.
QUESTION:

Well, that really doesn’t answer the

question.
MR. HOWELL:

All right.

on point, if your Honor please.

Now, let me get that right
The Congress has not told

the Department of Commerce to have the census taken so that
you could slice Virginia up into 100 Delegate seats and 40
Senate seats.

All they have told them to do is to take the

census so we can slice it up into 10 congressional seats.
And they have enumerated so that we can slice it up in 10
congressional seats

because Norfolk and Virginia Beach con­

stitute the Second Congressional District, and we diffuse
this military personnel.
QUESTION:

If the Virginia legislature had done the

37
congressional districting so that the line between the Second
District and the adjoining district were the same as between
the Fifth and Sixth State District that you are talking about,
the saiae fallacy would have been true for congressional
apportionment, wouldn't it?
MR. HOWELLs

Wall, that couldn't happen because, you

know, it takes 46,000 — ten into 4 point — it. takes 465,000
people to get a Congressman.
QUESTION:

But it's up to the legislature as to

where they draw the line between the districts, and conceivably
if they had drawn the congressional line at the place that
they drew the state district line here, you could have the
same problem.
MR. HOVJELL:

It's humanly impossible to do so.

You

can’t get 465,000 people, you know, into District 5 or
District 6 or District 7.

I mean, whan you are getting a

slice of pie that big, you don't need to worry about precise­
ness.
QUESTION:

How many of your navy people, Mr. Howell,

actually resided outside the Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh
Districts?
MR. HOWELL:
please.

Just a scintilla, if your Honor

It was not 50 percent.

There is no evidence as to

what small percentage lived in Chesapeake, commuted to
Suffolk, Virginia, but it was just a scintilla.

38
QUESTION:

To the extent that this variation does

exist, then the court’s own plan is not in line with its
own theory, so far as the census figures are concerned.
MR. HOWELL:

I suggest if the record is read with

the care which characterizes this Court/ you will find that
there is no evidence to show that any recognizable number of
people live outside 5, 6 and 7.
We showed that 98 percent of them were within 5, 6
and 7.

We couldn’t go looking for that one person as appellants.,
I would like to adlress myself —
QUESTION:

Mr. Howell, I take it you are saying

that you don’t attack the census figures at all, they were
quite accurate for what they showed.

The only thing is they

didn’t show where people lived and that the census figures
were permissibly used, but they were used in the wrong way
in the sense that the census figures didn't purport to show
where people lived, only where their home port is.
MR. HOWELL:
QUESTION:
MR.HOWELL:

Insofar as military were concerned.
Yes.

Yes.

They counted the wife of this sailor

in her home in District 6, but they counted the sailor, he
was the only person that was enumerated where he worked rather
than where he lived.

Senator Babalas and his wife were

counted where the Senator lived with his wife even though he
may spend half of his time in Richmond.

But the sailor was

39

counted on board a ship.

So there was discrimination in the

basic approach, the only person who was enumerated by occupation i
rather than residence.

And this was wrong.

j

I
QUESTION:

Why wouldn’t it have been sensible for

the District Court to have allocated between the three districts
a certain proportion of the sailors who

were said not to

live where the census put them?
MR. HOWELL:

Because, if your Honor please, we did

not. have sufficiently precise enumeration on a house-by-house
basis.

The Navy could have put a line, an additional line

on the sampler, "Do you live with your wife within the
Second Naval District?
could have done it.

If so, put your address."

And then;we

But. the Navy didn't put that line.

They

were in a hurry to fight a war and they regretted the fact
that somebody told them to participate in the census.

They got

rid of it as quick as they could.

Would you have objected if the court had

said, "We are going to split these.military equally between the
three districts?"

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. DuVal.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CLIVE L. DuVAL, II,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEE DuVAL
MR. DuVAL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
I'm appearing as counsel

pro se.

I was the lead

plaintiff in the lower court action in which we challenged
the Virginia General Assembly’s House of Delegates plan, and
as a result of which the lower court threw out the Assembly's

43

plan and adopted its own reapportionment plan for the House of
Delegates.
I am interested in only the House of Delegates plan.
We did not. challenge the Senate plan in any respect.
At the beginning of my argument, I would like to
make plain to the Court that I diametrically disagree with
the Attorney General and counsel for Virginia Beach who
apparently believe that this Court can affirm the lower
court only on the Kirkpatrick v. Preisler basis of mathematical
exactness.

This is certainly not the case, in ray opinion,

and I would urge upon the Court that there is ample authority
by which it could affirm the lower court's decision on the
basis of the basic cases in state reapportionment matters.
That is Reynolds v. Sims, Roman v. Sincock, and Swann v. Adams.
I was just saying, Mr. Justice Stewart, that I
believe the Court has ample authority to affirm the lower
court's decision on the basis of the long-standing cases
such as Reynolds, Roman v. Sincock, and Swann v. Adams.
QUESTION:
MR. DuVAL:

The basic stata reapportionment.
The basic state reapportionment cases.

I am well aware of the Kirkpatrick holding.
matter is under discussion in the Court here.

I know that this
I am not

interested in the outcome in this case‘because I rely
••>. -k

basically on the Swann case

written by Mr. Justice White in

which case the Court held that the issue in evaluating the

44
constitutional validity of a state legislative apportionment
scheme is whether *— and I am quoting — "there has been a
faithful adherence to a plan of population-based representa­
tion with such minor deviations only as may occur in recogniz ng
certain factors that are free from any taint of arbitrariness
or discrimination."
Now, the position that I am taking here is that the
Assembly House of Delegates plan flunked the test set down
in the statement I have just read you.

First of all because

it discriminated against Northern Virginia as a region in
the House of Delegates plan and thus was arbitrary and
discriminatory within the data that I just mentioned.
This Court in 1971 specifically condemned a plan that
has such a taint of arbitrariness or discrimination in
Abate v. l-lundt in which Justice Marshall wrote, and I quote,
"We have underscored the danger of apportionment structures
that contain a built-in bias tending to favor particular
geographic areas or political interests, or which necesssarily
will tend to favor, for example, less populous districts
over their more highly populated neighbors," citing Hadley v.
Junior College District.
Now, the facts, we believe, clearly show discrimina­
tion against the number of districts and seats represented
in the Northern Virginia area.

Thus, all 19 seats in Northern

Virginia, Delegate seats, were underrepresented by an average

45
of 4„3 percent.

In terms of population Northern Virginia

was underrepresented by 38,100 persons.
QUESTION:

What dees the court plan do for you,

Mr. DuVal?
MR. DuVAL:

The court plan reduces by about half —
r '

we got a Delegate, another Delegate was given to us to even
it out.

Our underrepresentation is corrected and spread out

across the State.
QUESTION:

You aren't overrepresented under the

court's plan?
MR. DuVAL:

We were underrepresented by a small

amount as of the 1970 census, but because of our very rapidly
growing population, our population as of August 1 actually
would have entitled us to 21 Delegates, not just 20 or 19,
but 21 under the 46,485 ideal population.
Now, under the Assembly-passed reapportionment,
redistriefcing plan, in the Congressional redistricting plan
Northern Virginia was entitled by its population to 20 percent
of the Congressional seats and it got them.

In the Senate

plan it got 20 percent of the Senate seats.

But in the House

plan it was given only 19 percent.
brought us into court.

And of course that's what

We felt that this discrimination

against us was particularly unfair because of the population
growth trends.

Northern Virginia for the last decade and

now is growing much more rapidly than the rest of the State.

46

In the last decade its growth rate,average annual grown rate,
was three times that of the rest of the State.

And this Court

has held in a number of decisions, the first Virginia case
that came bevore you on reapportionmanfc, Davis v. Mann, and
Kilgarlin v. Hill, and in Kirkpatrick, that it is proper for
the legislature and for reapportioning court to consider the
matter of growth in population.

In Kilgarlin in effect, the

Court approved an overrepresentation of one particular area
because the District Court showed that, that was a very rapidly
growing district.
Now, we say that the Assembly plan not only is
discriminatory against Northern Virginia, but the other side
of it was that there was substantial overrepresentation or
bias in favor of the Tidewater area, and thus as to 11
Tidewater Delegate seats, there was an overrepresentation by
an average of 7 percent per seat.

Yes, under state legislation.
And that is the principal reason for

your suggesting that these be treated as a group for a
comparison with other areas?
MR. DuVAL:

Yes, it was a convenient way of

considering Northern Virginia as a district already regularized
by state law.

In the same way most of the Tidewater juris­

dictions are lumped in a particular planning district down
there.

When I speak of Tidewater, I am again speaking of a

planning district identified as in effect the Tidewater
communities.
As I say 11 Tidewater Delegate seats were over­
represented by 7 percent apiece.

The population in the

Tidewater represented an overrepresentation of 36,650 persons.
On the basis of these facts that I have reported
to you, the lower court, we say, found that there was dis­
crimination, a built-in bias against Northern Virginia and
in favor of Tidewater.

Not in those exact words, but the

lower court found pervasive underrepresentation in districts
in Northern Virginia and overrepresentation in Tidewater, as
a result of which one delegate seat was removed from Tidewater
and transferred to Northern Virginia to eliminate this built-in
bias.

48

QUESTION:

Following up my brother Rehnquist's

question, does Tidewater have a specific kind of a definitional
meets and bounds identity just as Northern Virginia does?
MR. DuVAL:

Yes, sir, there is a planning — at

least there was a planning district, under state law set forth
in my brief, page 4 here, "As used herein, Tidewater area
means the Counties of Isle of Wight, Mansemond and Southampton
and the Cities of Chesapeake, Franklin, Norfolk, Portsmouth,
Suffolk and Virginia Beach.

For certain State purposes,

these jurisdictions are grouped in State Planning District.
Twenty."
Now, my second point is that, of course, there were
objectionable population deviations in this plan that do not
meet the Swann test, of minor variations.

I emphasize this

only really as these deviations reflect the bias and dis­
crimination that we believe was present in the House of
Delegates plan enacted by the legislature.

Percentagewise,

including all the districts, and there were four floaters here,
the overall variation from population equality between the
smallest and biggest district, was 23.6 percent.

The total

population difference between the biggest and smallest,
districts was 10,973 persons.

And I call your attention to

the fact that in Abate Justice Marshall said that there the
11.9 percent was the total deviation which the Court upheld
because of various factors.

Justice Marshall said, "And

49

nothing we say today should be taken to imply that even
these factors" — those that were considered to uphold the
11.9 percent degree of deviation — "could justify substantially
greater deviations from population equality."
I might also note in passing that the 23.6 total
deviation in the legislature's plan is almost, double the
10 or 15 percent variation between the largest and smallest
districts which Justice White said in his dissent, in Kirk­
patrick as a personal rule of thumb wouldn’t bother him too
much <
My third point is that the justification which the
State and Virginia Beach relies on presents for these varia­
tions, even though we say they can’t be justified because they
weren't minor, but the one the State relies on and the only
one simply doesn't hold water in that the State has not
consistently applied a respect for the integrity of boundary
lines in drawing its raapportionmont plans, and that includes
the House of Delegates plan.
As Lieutenant Governor Howell pointed out, our 1970
Constitution requires that every electoral district without
any distinction between House of Delegates districts, Senate
districts or Congressional districts comply with the equal
population principle.
Also, all of the reapportionment and reaistricting
plans adopted by the Virginia General Assembly disregard

50

subdivision laws in one degree or another,

the Congressioxial

and Senate plans in many respects,the House of Delegates
r©apportionment plan in the case of one county.
But beyond that, the House of Delegates plan has
broad provision in it which opens the door to frequent
violations of the integrity of subdivision lines.

That is,

that Act says that"the description of all legislative
districts are final on the effective date of enactment,
March 1, 1971, notwithstanding future boundary changes by
annexation, merger, consolidation or voiding of boundary
changes."
Now, there are at the present time half a dozen
cases pending in Virginia in the federal or state courts in
which either counties are seeking to repeal annexation of part
of their land for various reasons having been annexed before
March 1, 1971, by an adjacent city, or cities are trying to
bite up chunks of neighboring counties.

In any or all of

these cases the result could be a disregard of subdivision
lines, because if in effect a city were compelled to disgorge
part of a county annexed prior to March 1, 1971, then, of
course, the line would pick up a part of the county, the
existing legislative district,

or if a city prevails annexing

part of a county in the future, and there are three such cases
now pending, then a legislative district would cut part of a
city.

51
My fourth point is directed to appellants’ main
thrust here that the lower court should not have formulated
its own plan but. rather should have sent the plan back to the
General Assembly for action.

Now, it's obvious that in most

cases courts should leave reapportionrnent to the legislature.
The point is that in this case there simply wasn't time to do
it or havoc would have been created with the elective
processes of Virginia.
The primary election set by lav/ for June 8 had
already once been postponed in this case.

Candidates for the

General Assembly running in those primaries were to file for
revised districts within two weeks after the court handed
down its plan.

And it seems perfectly clear that the lower

court could not as a practical matter have given guidelines
to the Assembly, sent the matter back to the Assembly,
received back whatever plan they developed, reviewed it,
modified it, held hearings, ordered into effect without
great disruption to Virginia's elective procedures.
For example, it would have obviously compressed to
the very end the filing dates for candidates.
would certainly probably

The primary

have had to have been postponed a

second time from September 14.

Campaigns would have been

compressed and perhaps the general election would have had
to have been postponed.
I submit to your Honors that what the lov/er court did

52

was entirely proper in accordance with the holding and opinion
in Reynolds v. Sims where the Court stated that lower courts
would have wide latitude in developing "remedial techniques"
and that these techniques "will probably often differ depending
on local conditions."

The Court there further stated, and

I think it's particularly pertinent to tills case, that, "In
awarding or withholding immediate relief, a court is entitled
to and should consider the proximity of a forthcoming election
and the mechanics and complexities of state election laws
and should act and rely upon general equitable principles."
?

Of course, as this Court has pointed out in Beans
"the discretion of a reapportioning court is not unlimited but
it is certainly broad."
I contend the court, proceeded properly and in
accordance with equitable principles*

First of all, and most

important to us, it abolished the discrimination complained
of and gave us the additional delegate we were entitled to.
Also, acting reasonably, I believe, because it took
the Assembly's House of Delegates plan and simply modified it
as necessary to reduce the population deviations by about
one-half, the result being that the court's plan — in
Virginia we have 134 counties and cities — the court's plan
found it necessary to cross boundary lines in the case of
only 12 of these counties and cities.
So I believe and submit to you that the court's plan

53
was entirely reasonable and proper.
And, finally, your Honors, as a practical matter I
submit that it is unnecessary for the Supreme Court to further
consider this case at this stage.

First of all, X want to

remind you that the appeal here is from an interlocutory
order below.

Also, the Virginia General Assembly will meet

next month at a regular session and under the clear holding
in Connor v. Williams it could, of course, at that time
enact or re-enact any reapportionment legislation it saw fit.
subject only, of course, to proper constitutional considera­
tions.
Now, if it does so at the coming General Assembly,
that plan presumably would be referred back to the lower
court for consideration and modification perhaps.

If then

further appeals are taken to this Court, the situation deemed
desirable by the Court in Connor v. Williams will then occur.
The Court will then have, which it does not now have, a
final order before it on appeal covering the entire State.
As I say it is only an interlocutory order before you now.
If, on the other hand, the General Assembly, as is
much more likely, fails to enact a new plan of reapportionment,
its continued inaction will illustrate very clearly, I submit
to your Honors, that the Assembly now has no objection
whatsoever to the District Court's plan.

And this as a

matter of practicality, I believe, is the actual situation.

54
Here are the facts:

In 1971 the Attorney General

of Virginia, my good friend Mr. Miller, was asked to take this
appeal by the 1971 Assembly elected under the old law.

Since

then a new General Asserobly has been elected and is sitting
and acting, acted at the Assembly session earlier this year
and passed laws for the government of Virginia.
QUESTION:

Mr. DuVal, couldn’t we count on that new

General Assembly if it decided that it no longer wanted to
prosecute this appeal to so advise the Attorney General?
MR. DuVAL:

I think it might well do so.

a perfectly good contingency, I believe.

That is

And at the past

1972 session, your Honors, the House of Delegates did not even
consider, much less enact as it could have done under Connor v.
Williams any new reapportionraent legislation, the clear
implication being that the last thing the House of Delegates,
the present House of Delegates, wants is a reversal of the
reapportionment plan under which they were elected.
I submit to your Honors that under the circumstances
here present with a legislative body elected and acting under
a District Court plan, the reversal of the lower court's plan
would be confusing to the voters, difficult for candidates,
and certainly not, in my judgment, in the best interest of
the people

of Virginia.

For these reasons, your Honors, I submit that the
Attorney General of Virginia and the counsel for Virginia

Beach may well be the only persons in the Commonwealth who
are desirous of seeing this appeal, their appeal, succeed,
QUESTION:

Mr. DuVal, if you assume the Court

thought that the particular variations in this case were
justified by a respect, for county lines or something like
that, was there some pLan put forward in this case that would
have cured that and still have respected the state interests?
MR. DuVAL:

No, your Honor.

In the Assembly during

the discussion of the plan there, we in Northern Virginia did
submit plans we felt would prevent any discrimination against
us, but they were rejected.

When we came before the lower

court, of course, our principal interest, was in the Northern
Virginia region and not in the state as a whole.
did not propose

We therefore

a statewide plan.

QUESTION:

But did you propose a different arrange­

ment on multi-member districts in Northern Virginia?
MR. DuVAL:

We proposed single member districts in

the Assembly, and that's what wa desired.

But wa gave up

that contention after Chavis v. Whitcomb.
QUESTION:
MR. DuVAL:
QUESTION:

That issue is not here then.
That issue is not here.
But did you propose that if there were

going to be multi-member districts there ought to be only one
or two?
MR. DuVAL:

In Northern Virginia?

In my case we

56

felt that a division of Northern Virginia to two districts
of 5 and 6 delegates was infinitely preferable to one of 11
districts.
QUESTION:
MR. DuVAL:

Is that issue hare?
That issue is not here.

Those issues

were all dropped at the lower level.
In conclusion, your Honor, the Attorney General who
launched his bark on these appellant seas in 1971 with a
crew of many supporters, whom I might say, as you have
perceived, is a very fine attorney and a close friend of
mine, now finds himself in a situation reminiscent, I say,
of Coleridge's Ancient Mariner, "Alone, alone, all, all alone.
A3.one on a wide, wide sea.”
The fact is that the Attorney General's 1971 crew
has left him and the new crew is sitting back in port in
Richmond hopeful that his vessel, this epp©al* will sink
without trace.
I ask the Court to affirm the lower court's order
or alternativesly to dismiss the appeals herein without
prejudice.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Mr. Attorney General.

Thank you.

57
REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW P. MILLER
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS
MR. MILLERs

May it pleas© the Court:

What you have just hoard sounds to ma as if it is
an instant replay of certain political arguments with which
this Court should not necessarily be concerned.
But with respect to the constitutional issue before
us at this time, I would like to draw your attention to
Plaintiff's Exhibit 29 because in response to Mr. Rehnquist's
point, there is a Second Congressional District which
QUESTION:

In this document?

MR. MILLER:

Yes, sir, which I believe you have in

your right hand.
— a Second Congressional District consisting of
the city of Norfolk and most, but not all, of Virginia Beach.
Now, we have three Senate Districts here, 5, 6,
and 7, which cover all of Norfolk and a portion of Virginia
Beach.

In other words, with one more Senate District, one

would have had the Congressional District which you refer to,
Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

And consequently your point is very

well taken.
A

I was amazed at Mr. Cowell's suggestion that in fact
there are not a significant number of people who are enumerated
as home ported in Census Tract 999 who do not live outside
of the Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Senatorial Districts.

The

53
facts are exactly to the contrary.
If your Honors will turn to Appendix 140, you will
see a listing of zip codes.

Those zip codas show that a

significant number of the individuals involved live in
Chesapeake which is a city at the bofctoia of the map here, live
in Portsmouth

which is a city just off the map to my left,

and in Hampton and Newport Mews which are in fact across
Hampton Roads, and the only way you can get there is by
crossing a bridge tunnel.
In terms of evidence which relates to tills point,
I would like to refer your Honors to Appendix 200 and read
the following colloquy which took place in the deposition.
This is Mr. Reed's deposition —
QUESTION:

(Inaudible.)

MR. MILLER:

Yes, sir, it's part of the case and is

in the Appendix at page 200, the portion I am reading, sir.
It says, "Now you have testified, and also aupplied
an affidavit that 59 percent of that 36,693 or approximately
21,600 do not live in the Fifth Senatorial District, is that
correct?"
"That's correct."
Then, going down, "Have you got it?”
Answer:

"5,050 in Senate District 6,

7,100 in the

Norfolk portion of District 7 and 9,500 live outside the city
limits of Norfolk."

59

"They live in Virginia Beach and some live in
Chesapeake?"
"Right."
"And some live in Portsmouth?"
"Right."
"Some live in Newport News?"
"Right."
"Some live in Hampton?"
And then there's a colloquy and in the end ha admits
that some in fact do live in Hampton as shown by the zip codes
set forth on Appendix 140.
So I think that lays that particular issue to rest.
QUESTION:

You don't know how many of the 9,500

live outside of 5, 6, and 7?
MR. MILLER:

No, sir, we don't.

We do know that

clearly it is a significant number.
QUESTION:
MR. MILLER:

There are some.
Well, your Honor, no part of the city

of Chesapeake is in 5, 6, or 7.

No part of the city of

Portsmouth —
QUESTION:
MR. MILLER:
QUESTION:
MR. MILLER:

Some live in Chesapeake.

That's right.

And Hampton and Newport News.
Some.

Yes.

Yes, sir.

Well, he suggests that

9,500 live outside the boundaries of the city of Norfolk, so

60

the only portion of Senate Districts 5, 6, and 7 which the
District Court, consolidated outside the city of Norfolk was
40(.000 out of 170,000 total population of Virginia Beach.
So I would readily concede, your Honor, that maybe 1,000 to
2,000 of those 9,500 may live in the 40,000 which are a part
of Virginia Beach that was put in with Norfolk.

But clearly,

you are talking about a very significant number, 40 percent
on the basis of zip codes at the minimum which live in other
cities and outside the Senatorial Districts in question.
QUESTION:

Based on these zip codes would there have
. *• i •

been some basis for the court allocating to the specific
districts those sailors who didn’t live in the census tract
where they were placed by the census?
MR. MILLER:

No, sir.

done as a practical matter.

I don't think it could be

And if I may address myself to

that for just a moment, I submit, that the only way which the
lover court's decision can be upheld is for this Court to
determine it was arbitrary for the Commonwealth to utilize
the census.
QUESTION:

Yes, but let's assume we won't uphold

that, but could the District court have maintained single
member Senate Districts and still allocated —
MR. MILLER:

Your Honor, I was getting to that.

The point is that one would simply open up Pandora's box if
one took that route.

And let me explain why.

Because on® is

61

not only talking about naval personnel here.
about all members of the military.
college students.

We are talking

We are talking about

We are talking about, inmates of mental

institutions and penitentiaries, individuals who work in on©
location, live there during the week, and go elsewhere for the
weekend.
Consequently what Mr. Howell is suggesting in this
case,that goes completely behind the census and on® would have
constant litigation as to where in fact the individuals in
th© categories I have just mentioned, and that list is not
exclusive, should in fact be located.
I see my time is up, your Honor.

Let me conclude

by saying in response to Mr. Justice Stewart's observation,
that we are faced her® with a rational plan, unlike the
situation in Swann, that there was a balancing in Northern
Virginia between the House of Delegates and the Senate, one
being over-represented, the other being under-represented,
and that the General Assembly will again be in session in
January.

If th© Court finds that there's any constitutional

defect in the plan it adopted, it will be in a position to
act in that session in accordance with whatever guidelines
this Court lays down.
However, I urge the Court to sustain the plan as
adopted by th© General Assembly as being fully in accord
with the guidelines handed down by this Court in its decision
