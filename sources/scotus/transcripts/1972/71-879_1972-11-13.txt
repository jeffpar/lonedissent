MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 71-879, Heublein against South Carolina Tax Commission.
Mr. Riga, you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN M. PIGA, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. PIGA:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
I would like to introduce co-counsel, Croft Jennings,
from Columbia, South Carolina, and my associate counsel, Paul
?
Rumeo from New York City.
This case is here on appeal from the Supreme Court
of Soutii Carolina.

The decision in that Court unanimously

reversed the Trial Court and upheld the position of the State
Tax Commission.

Justice Lewis wrote the opinion in that

case.
There are five principal parties involved directly
orindirectly in this proceeding.

Heublein, Inc., is a

Connecticut corporation engaged in the business of manufactur­
ing and distributing alcoholic beverages and other products
throughout the United States.
The appellee is the South Carolina Tax Commission,
a branch of the South Carolina State.
The Distilled Spirits Institute, a trade association
of the produccsrs of alcoholic beverages in the United States,

4
filed an amicus brief in the preliminary proceeding before
this Court.»
The Multistate Tax Commission and the Solicitor
General of the United States have filed amicus briefs in
support of South Carolina's position.
This case involves the application of the Interstate
Income Tax law, Public Law 86-272, to the Corporate Income
Tax laws of South Carolina.

The text of the Federal statute

is set forth on page 30 of the jurisdictional statement„

If

I may, I would like to read the principal provisions of this
statute.

Section 381(a), and I quote with soma omissions:
"No State...shall have power to impose...a net

income tax on the income derived within such State by any
person from interstate commerce if the only business activities
within such State by ...such person ...are:
"the solicitation of orders by such person, or his
representative, in such State for sales of tangible personal
property, which orders are sent outside the State for approval
or rejection, and, if approved, are filled by shipment or
delivery from a point outside the State."
The statute seems fairly clear.
It is Heublein's position that activities in South
Carolina were protected by the statute, thereby rendering
Hsublein immune from South Carolina income tax.
The lower court proceedings involved two important

5

questions.

The Court of Common Pleas decided, first, that the

so-called voluntary activities of Heublein in South Carolina
which consisted of its usual business solicitation and promotional activities did not violate, did not exceed the minimum
activities permitted by the Federal statute.

The lower court

also held — this was after trial and testimony -- that the
activities of Heublein in South Carolina which were mandated
by the South Carolina Alcoholic Beverage Control laws did not
exceed the minimum permitted by the Federal statute.
The Supreme Court of South Carolina did not disturb
the trial Court’s findings on voluntary activities.

It left

standing the conclusion that Heublein9s voluntary activities
in South Carolina did not exceed the minimum permitted by the
Federal statute.

However, the Supreme Court of South Carolina

held that the activities of Heublein which were mandated by
South Carolina's ABC laws ware sufficient to localise its
business in South Carolina and thereby rendered the application
of ilhe Federal statute to it no longer effective.
Thus the sole issue before this Court is whether
Heublein9 s compliance with the ABC laws of South Carolina is
a sufficient basis to deprive Heublein of the protection of
the Federal statute.
QUESTION:

You say that the Supreme Court of South

Carolina let stand the lower court's findings favorable to
your client.

Did the Supreme Court pass on that or treat it

6
in any way or did it just, ignore it?
MR. PIGA:
the opinion.

There was no discussion of it at all in

But this was a factual determination, I believe,

on the trial court's record after testimony had been taken sc
that this factual conclusion of the trial court not being
discussed, passed upon, or changed by the Supreme Court of
South Carolina was left standing.
QUESTION:

Well, you say that, but isn't the ordinary

rule that when a judgment comes here from a State court all
presumptions are in favor of the validity of the judgment of
the highest court of the State?
MR. PIGA;

I would think, sir, that the primary purpcs

of this particular proceeding is to consider the Federal
question and the substantial Federal question involved in the
mandated activities required by the ABC laws of South Carolina,
and that the factual conclusion of whether Heublein's
representative carrying promotional material from this retail
account to another retail account would not be the substantial
Federal question that should concern this Court.
QUESTIdw:

You don't have to rely, then, on the

lowor court's findings that were favorable.
MR. PIGA:

I think it is important in the overall

picture of this particular case, although we will get into
and we will discuss exactly what the local activities of
Heublei.n were that consisted of the so-called voluntary

7
activities.

That, would all be a part of the record of this

case and it. will be discussed today.

How, I will go into

that, right now, if I may.
Heublein is a Connecticut corporation.

It produces

alcoholic beverages in Hartford and elsewhere and distributes
its products throughout the U.S. and in South Carolina.
best “known product is £mir.noff Vodka.

Heublein is not

qualified to do business in South Carolina.
there.

It has no warehouse there.

in South Carolina.

Its contact

Its

It has no office

It has no stock of goods

with South

Carolina is

through a local representative, a so-called missionary man,
who calls on retail accounts, liquor stores, clubs, hotels,
in the promotion of Heublein products.

Heublein is not

permitted to sell directly to retail accounts in South Carolina
by reason of the application of South Carolina's ABC laws.
Thus, Heublein!s local representative is not considered to be
a salesman of alcoholic products in South Carolina.

However,

he did on occasion brief the distributor’s salesmen, the
distributor being the sole outlet of Heublein in South Carolina
for the distribution of its goods.

All orders for Heublein1s

products came from a distributor, primarily one distributor.
These were sent by the distributor to Heublein's office, in
Hartford for acceptance or rejection there.

All orders ware

filled by shipments by common carrier from goods maintained in
inventory outside of the State of South Carolina.

8
These are really the limits of the so-called voluntary
activities of Heublain in South Carolina.
We believe that these activities are clearly protected
by the Federal statute and that th© trial court so held after
hearing testimony, not only of the local representative, but
of the South Carolina witnesses.

This holding, as I said

before, has not been disturbed by the Supreme Court of South
Carolina,

But I think it’s important to this Court to under­

stand the whole factual picture.
Now, we com© to the activities of Heublein which were
mandated by the ABC lav/s of South Carolina and which would apply
to any non-South Carolinian distiller whether he had any contact
in South Carolina or no contact within South Carolina.

These

requirements are set forth in Section 4-131 to 4-150 of the ABC
laws of South Carolina v/hich appear in the jurisdictional
statement beginning at page 32.

If I may, it's not necessary

today for the Court to read 8 pages of ABC lav/s, but I think
I can summarise the important points fairly quickly.
First, the producer must register with the State
Tax Commission.

The producer must also register a local

representative, a producer’s representative with the State Tax
Commission.

This local representative must, ba a citisen and

resident of South Carolina.
The producer must also register its brands with the
State Tax Commission.

9
All snipmsnts of liquor from out of State must be
consigned in the name of the local producer's representative»
A copy of each invoice and bill of lading must be sent to th©
State Tax Commission at the tiraa of each out-of“State shipment» ‘
When the goods arrive in South Carolina, the producer's
representative must deliver to the State Tax Commission another
copy of the bill of lading and the invoice.

He obtains then

a certificate of transfer from the State Tax Commission and it’s
only after these steps are taken and completed may the
producer's representative in South Carolina complete the
delivery and transfer of the shipping documents and title
papers to the wholesaler, to the purchaser in this particular
transaction, even though in many cases the liquor itself is
already on the premises of the wholesaler-distributor.

These

are the mandated activities.
According to the Supreme Court of South Carolina,
these are the activities which resulted in converting inter­
state sales into intrastate sales.

These are the requirements fry

which th© highest court of South Carolina, I quote, "preclude
the sale of alcoholic beverages in South Carolina through
interstate sales."

These are the mandated activities which

prevent the application of the Federal statute to Heublein
in the view of th© South Carolina Tax Commission and its highest
court.
How, we concede here that Heublein complied with the

10
ABC laws of South Carolina.

We concede that the ABC laws of

South Carolina require the producer to retain the technical
ownership and technical title of its products until it complies
in South Carolina with the ABC laws.

We also concede that

the technical passage of title to its products occurs in
South Carolina when th© shipping papers are endorsed over to
the purchaser, the wholesaler distributor in South Carolina.
*

But now again we should take another look at the
Federal statute.

Th© Federal statute which I quote says,

"No State shall impose a net income tax on income derived from
interstate commerce if the only business activities are the
t'

solicitation of orders sent outside th© State for approval and,
if approved, ar© filled by shipment or delivery from a point
outside the State.”
Under th© circumstances in this case, the Federal
statute expressly applies if Heublein's income is derived from
interstate commerce and if the shipments or deliveries are made
from a point outside the State.

It is difficult to conceive

of a state of facts which is closer to th© protection of th©
Federal statutes than this case.

Heublein accepts these orders

in Hartford, th© inventory of Heublein is maintained outside
of South Carolina, generally in Hartford, the goods are shipped
from Connecticut in most cases directly to South Carolina,
they are earmarked for a particular purchase order which has
been approved and confirmed by the producer in Hartford.

These

11
transactions are clearly in interstate commerce.

However, the

appellee, South Carolina, claims with the affirmation of its
highest court, that the transfer of legal ownership, that is,
of technical title in South Carolina, as required by its own
ABC laws is sufficient to change these interstate transactions
into intrastate transactions.

The basis for this conclusion

is that there is no shipment or delivery from out of State
because the goods are still owned by the producer when they
arrive in the State.
It would hardly seem necessary to go beyond the
plain meaning of the Federal statute to reject this argument.
However, if.there is any ambiguity in the Federal statute,
it seems clearly to have been put to rest by the Senate
committee report.

The Senate committee report rejected any

State-imposed, point of sale test in the application of the
Federal statute.
helpful.

If I nay again quote, I think it would be

This is Senate Committee Report No. 658 from the

36th Congress, 1st Sessions
"The Committee understands that the formulascurrently
in use are complex, that even within the formulas, the meaning
of the basic words are inexact and that, for example, many of
the 35 income tax States used a different definition to cover
the term 'sale.1

It understands that a 'sale' may be

considered to have taken place according to these definitions
in any of these locations;' In the place where the buyer and

12
seller met; in the place where the goods were manufactured!
in the place where the goods were stored; in the place where
*

the transaction v?as finally approved; in the place where the
selling company was domiciled; or in the place where the goods
were shipped.
V

'‘This lack of uniformity creates the possibility that,
each of a number of different States may regard the same sale
as having occurred in it, depending upon the particular
definition of ‘sale* under its own tax laws.

If each of

several different States treat the same sale as attributable
to it because of its own definition of ’sale', it is apparent
that income from the same sale may be attributed to each of
the States under whose law the same sale is to be attributed."
In other words, this is a clear rejection by Congress
of any place of sal© test, particularly where the place of
sale is determined by the particular State or the courts of
that State.
QUESTION;

Mr. Piga, even if you are right as to th©

broad sweep of the Federal statute in matters not dealing with
liquor, doesn't the Twenty-First Amendment at least arguably
put some limitations on th© power of Congress to sweep that
broadly when they are dealing with liquor?
MR. PIGA;

There have been conflicts raised in the

past between the Twenty-First Amendment, ABC laws generated by
th© Twenty-First Amendment, and other Federal statutes.

If you

13
recognise here that there is a potential conflict now between
the Federal statute we are talking about, the Interstate Income
Tax Act, and the ABC laws which are regulations based on the
Twenty-First Amendment, then I think all of the precedent
that, has come before the courts has decided clearly that the
Federal statute or Federal lav/ prevails.
QUESTIONi

Mr. Piga, I gather that it is the fact,

isn't it, that the orders are filled from stocks maintained
within the State?

I know you say this is only a technicality,

but such orders as are finally filled are filled from stocks
maintained within the StateP aren't they?
MR. PIGA:

No, it's not exactly correct, sir.

At

the time the goods are appropriated to the order, the goods
are located outside.

QUESTION:

And it's from wherever he keeps them that

they are finally filled.

You mentioned that they cure already

actually or: the warehouse platforms»
MR. PIGA;

Actually, in practice, the trucks are

14
unloaded outside of the wholesaler's warehouse.

They are

unloaded into the warehouse of the wholesaler.

There may be

separate bins, but I think that is immaterial.

You are right,

at that time, at the time of delivery in South Carolina, the
goods still belong to the producer.

And in that limited sense

you can say that the producer maintains a stock of goods.
QUESTION:

Didn’t the Senate report expressly and

rather carefully say that the interpretation of this statuta
would be such that in a fact situation like this immunity
would not apply?
MR. PIGA:

No, I think that, the Senate — well, the

statute itself is talking about, shipment or delivery from
out of State to in State.

We claim that wa clearly have that.

We claim, too, that the requirement here that the goods come
to rest for an instant in South Carolina is merely in essence
a checking point, a
QUESTION:

point at which —
if we don’t agree with that, if we think

it falls within the literal language of the statute, that's
the end of the case, isn't it?

interpret delivery or shipment in the terras that the Court of
South Carolina has interpreted it.

The goods are —

I gather you don't challenge the authority

of the State under the Twenty-First Amendment to require —

That's correct.

But. if there is in fact a conflict here between
the Federal statute and the Twenty-First Amendment or any
statutes, State statutes based on the Twenty-First Amendment,

that the Federal Alcohol Administration Act prevails

Doesn’t that go to a different issue?

This is the power of the State under the Twenty-First

i

MR. PIGA:

But it’s_using the authority of.the Twenty-

First Amendment, with respect to a State statute, or the TwentyFirst Amendment itself in challenge to a Federal statute.

Now,

the most recent case on this particular point is the
Idlewild Liquor case in New York.

There the ABC laws of New

York-”again based on the Twenty-First Amendment, it was sought
to overturn the application of the Federal Tariff Act of 1930.
And in 1963 this Court upheld the Federal Tariff Act, notwith­
standing that type of a challenge.

‘

So I don’t think there’s any doubt that if there
is a Federal policy embodied in a Federal statute and if in

16
fact you find that, there's a conflict between a State law,
whether it be based on the Twenty-First- Amendment or any other
regulatory power,that the Federal statute clearly is supreme
and takes precedence over this.

your case?

17
(Laughter.)
But the holding, I believe, is helpful to us„
Before conclusion, I would like to note that alcoholic
beverages are now sold in all 50 States probably under more
regulation than that of any other product.

In 1970 there were

about 230 million gallons of distilled spirits consumed in the
United States with over 5 million gallons in South Carolina
alone.

The industry itself generated in 1970 about. $7.68 billion

of revenues for the Federal, State and local governments,
including about $48 million in South Carolina alone.
These points are used to illustrate that the alcoholic
beverage industry is a very important part of the commercial
picture of the United States, and we believe should no longer
be singled out for discretionary tax treatment based upon
local ABC laws, particularly in this case where all they really
do is establish check points for the purposes of the State
Tax Commission.

It seems to us that it should be inconceivable

that that type of a lav/ should be used to overturn a national
tax policy.
QUESTION:

Mr. Piga, supposing that South Carolina

instead of just as you contend requiring check point had
required HeubXein to establish a warehouse in South Carolina?
MR. PIGA:

Sir, we've thought about that, and have

been greatly concerned about it.

For example, if Hsublein

was required to build a distillery in South Carolina in order

to sail its products in South. Carolina, ws have doubts as to
the practicalities, the constitutionality, and the political
aspect of that type of a requirement in view of, particularly
in view of, the amount of revenue we are talking about which
is already generated by the liquor business in South Carolina,
We don't know what the answer to that would be.

It's a

difficult question, but I don't think it’s before this Court
until it becomes politically and legally and practically a
matter that has happened in South Carolina,
Thank you, gentlemen.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, Mr. Piga.

Mr. Argoe.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF G. LEWIS ARGOE, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR. ARGOE;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court;
The major issue in this case is whether or not the
activities of Heublein in South Carolina exceed the minimum
standards of Public Law 86-272.

Now, counsel for Heublein has

very ably stated the requirements and the restrictions in
Public Law 86-272, therefore, I will not comment further on
that..
But I disagree with hi3 argument on the facts because
I think that they are contrary to the facts as is set. out in
the record taken before the Court of Common Pleas in South

19

Carolina.
Briefly, if I may comment, all of the activities of
Heublein in South Carolina are voluntary activities; otherwise
they wouldn’t be there.

So I think that to assume that some

of the activities are involuntary and others are voluntary
would b® a point that bears no — that does not have any
bottom to it, it's just a faaetious argument, in ray opinion.
There are, however, certain requirements relating
to the shipment and delivery of alcoholic liquors into South
Carolina, and the pertinent or the most important provision
of the ABC laws in regard to this case is Section 4-134 of the
Code of Lav/s which states that "no alcoholic liquor shall be
shipped into South Carolina except by a registered producer/*
and a registered producer is defined by statute to be one
who is involved in the manufacture of alcoholic liquor or
one who has a license to import liquors into the United States
from foreign countries.
I therefore think that the first premise that this
case stands on is the fact that importation in interstate
commerce is precluded.

Therefore, we are not concerned with.

Public Lav; 35-272 as defined in the introductory paragraph of
that section that net income from business in interstate
commerce shall be protected where the minimum activities meet
the requirement set out in that statute.

So the framers of

Public Law 36—272 frrst supposed that interstate commerce

20

would be protected and not intrastate commerce.
What we have in this case is purely a case of intrastate sales of liquor by Heublein.
The shipment of alcoholic liquors must be made in
accordance with statutes which are set out and which require
that prior to a shipment into the State, th© registered
producer who is registered and licensed to ship into the State
must file with the State an invoice and a bill of lading
setting out in detail the specific quantities, type, sizes,
brands, and so forth, liquors which are to be shipped into the
State.

Now, these requirements are all regulatory insofar as

controlling the flow of liquor or the movement of liquor across
the State boundaries.

And if you read in th© particular

statutes, you will see that that was specifically provided because
when

it comes from a point without the geographical boundaries

to a point within the geographical boundaries, shipment shall
be controlled.
The shipment, further, must be to a producer
representative of the registered producer who shall take the
delivery, or accept the delivery within South Carolina, and
upon acceptance he is required to submit to the State an
invoice upon which he endorses the delivery showing in detail
the quantities, the type, and so forth liquors which have been
received within the State.

Therefore, from the time the

shipment by the importer commences, it must be controlled, and

21
'the movement, is controlled until it ends in Soyfeh Carolina.
Now, this is probably an interstate shipment, but
here again this must come to rest at some point in South Carolina
Now, bearing on the point for a moment that —
QUESTION:

Mr. Argoe, I take it your argument does

concede that what Heublein was required to do here is mandated
by the State?
MR. ARGOE:
QUESTION:

I concede —
To the point where in your argument, if

I understand it correctly, the interstate commerce aspect has
come to an end.
MR. ARGO J:

I do make that point, your Honor, I

make the point that the
QUESTION;

So the net effect of it is the Twenty-

First Amendment then overrides in the liquor area the Federal
statuto.
MR. ARGOE:

The Twenty-First Amendment gives the

States exclusive right to control, to regulate the traffic
into the State.

And to that extant, I would say that the

Twenty-First Amendment would override the commerce clause, yes.
QUESTION:

This has to be your argument.

Would you tell me, then, what is the interest of the
State that, is protected by these additional requirements other
than the natural one of controlling the liquor traffic?
MR. ARGOE:

The interest of the State in these

22
regulations is to provide that all shipments shall be by
one party, that party being subject to the exclusive control of
the State, wherefore this control can provide an accounting
for tee liquor at. all stages of its movement from the
commencement of shipment from without the State until its
arrival within tee State.
QUESTION:

It couldn’t do this with respect to

groceries?
HR. ARGOE:

I do not think this would apply, teat

the State of South Carolina or any State has tee right to
control tee shipment of groceries, because they are not specif!
cally protected, or the State is not specifically given tee
authority under the Twenty-First to regulata the sale of
groceries, or any other ordinary articles of commerce, by the
way.
Now, getting back to the point that I wanted to make,
by the time that tee liquor reaches South Carolina and is
owned and possessed by Heublein, the State should have complete
control and notice that it is in South Carolina.

Thereafter,

prior to any further transfer of this liquor, the State must
b© notified teat tee sales to the liquor has been solicited
and teat permission is being sought for the transfer of this
liquor to the prospective buyer in this case.
I might emphasize at this point that if it would
appear to the Court teat these liquor regulations and the

23
control of this liquor might appear to have been taken lightly
in this particular case, it is because the sole distributor
for the major portion of the years involved in this case was
a distributor situated within 10 blocks of the Alcoholic
Beverage Control Commission and that it had been a very
reliable distributor and it was therefore not necessary for
them to be subjected to the close scrutiny that some
distributors would be subjected to.

that the liquor actually be delivered physically to the
producer representative?
MR. ARGOE: The law states that it shall be the local
producer representative — now the term "physically" is not
used here.
QUESTION:

I know, but it does not break the law

if the liquor is physically delivered to the distributor8s
warehouse rather than to the producer representative himself?
MR. ARGOE: There is no provision in the statute that
would preclude a producer representative from accepting

the

shipment on the platform or the loading dock of the —
QUESTION:

Well, how does the common carrier know

where to deliver it?
MR. ARGOE:

*s ret3uired on his documents, the

shipping documents state that the consignment is to the
producer representative —
QUESTION:

I know that, but how does he know where to

take it?
MR. ARGOE; At. the location of the wholesaler's
warehouse.

26
QUESTION;

So the common carrier is told what

warehouse to deliver it to»
MR. ARGOE: What warehouse to deliver it.
QUESTION:

He would have to know that.

That just

happens to be the distributor’s warehouse.
MR. ARGOS: That just happens to be the distributor’s
warehouse.

And they are delivered there.
QUESTION:

I suppose if John Jone3 is the producer

representative, it’s John Jones and the address is the
distributor’s warehouse.
MR. ARGOE: The distributor's warehouse, that is
correct.
QUESTIO^:

Then what does he do?

On the phone he's

told they are here by toe distributor?
MR. ARGOE: Under the facts in this case, it reads
in the record toe producer representative, has office space
at the distributor's warehouse, at'which point —

That's one of his addresses?

QUESTION:

What does h© do, now, when they get there,

27
he knows they've arrived, and so he takes the papers and does
what with them?

Endorsesthem over or —

HR. ARGOE: He takes the papers and he seeks the
permission of the State to make a transfer.
properly

Those papers must be

endorsed, showing the time, the quantity, and

everything in that, shipment and the time that they arrived
and the shipment was accepted.
QUESTION:

Then what does he do?

MR. ARGOEs Thereafter, he applies for a certificate
of transfer which would give him permission to transfer the
legal ownership and title and to effect the sale and delivery
of this liquor.
QUESTION:

Where dpes he get the certificate?

MR. ARGQE:

The certificate is a form which is

supplied to him and it's a form which he would have to fill
out —
QUESTION:

Are they supplied in advance to him?

MR. ARGGE:

That certificate is supplied, and all he

QUESTION:

Supplied in advance to him or not?

MR. ARGOS:

Yes, it is.

QUESTION:

It's signed already and he fills it in?

has to —

MR. ’ARGOE: This certificate is a certificate that
he fills out.

The form is not filled out by the State.

QUESTION:

I know, and it isn't signed by the State

28

afterwards, it's already signed in advance?
MR. ARGOS; No, it. is not signed in —
QUESTION;

All right, then what happens?

Ha fills

out the form and then takes it. somewhere?
MR. ARGOE; He fills out the form, carries it to the
Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission and requests that they
approve it for the transfer be granted.
QUESTION;

Right.

MR. ARGOS; It is at that time that the State
decides whether or not they can grant the approval for the
transfer.

And T. think the record in1 this case is silent on

the point as to whether or not a shipment has ever been refused.
But it is at that point that the decision is mads whether or
not the wholesaler is entitled to purchase this liquor.
QUESTION;

That what you just said suggests that

you know of no instances where the approval has been withheld?
MR. iVRGOE; I know of none of this particular wholesaler.
QUESTION;

I suppose if the particular wholesaler

had violated some statute, some section of the statute relating
to the

control of alcoholic beverages, the Board might refuse

in that instance to approve the transfer, is that true?
MR. &ROGE: For any violation a license may be
revoked, and that being the license of the registered producer
authorised to ship or the license of the wholesaler seeking to

29

buy this liquor.

And for a violation, it depends upon the

nature of the violation, I assume, as to whether or not they
would revoke the license or refuse to allow them to obtain
or to purchase liquor.
QUESTION:

It could be —•

Either you or Mr. Piga made reference to,

I thought, some sort of separate storage or bin within the
warehouse, or am I mistaken in thinking that?
MR. ARGOE:

Any storage by Heublein in South Carolina

must be made in a bonded warehouse or its own warehouse, to foe
a legal storage.
QUESTION:

Well, in this case was it shipped to the

wholesaler's warehouse?
MR. ARGOE:
warehouse.

It was shipped to the wholesaler's

I thinK you will find that the record is silent

as to how long that liquor may have rested on this loading dock
before it was actually reported to the State that it had
arrived.

So legally, I don’t assume, and I don't suppose that

any liquor could arrive in the State of South Carolina that,
could legally be accepted by anyone except the producer
representative, and the common carrier may be at fault for
leaving it with someone else.
We are confronted with the question of acceptance or
rejection of an order.

The statute, Public Law 86-272, to be

applicable/ the activities must show that any orders listed in
South Carolina were sent outside the State where they are

30
accepted or rejected.

And along the lines of the questions

previously asked by the Court, I would suggest that no
acceptance could be made of an order prior to the liquor
reaching South Carolina and being received by the producer
representative in South Carolina.

Therefor®, any order would

be subject to the approval of the State before it could be
accepted.

In South Carolina, and I think generally in all

States,for a sale to be consummated there must be a passing of
title and there must be a delivery granting the parson
acquiring any purchased property, granting the person purchasing
property the right to receive such property.

There is no

right until that permission is granted ir. this case.

Therefore,

for that reason, Public Law 86-272 is unapplicable.
So summarizing, I would —

Your Honor, 1 can't agree with you in

The liquor business is different, yas.

With respect to liquor (inaudible^*

MR. ARGOE:

It would be very questionable.

And I

think under the Court's holding in the case of the South Carolina

Highway Department v, Monrrtal the Court would take jurisdiction
and determine whether or not the State had exceeded its
authority —
QUESTION:

With respect to other property, you would

say the commerce clause would prevent South Carolina from
requiring title to pass inside the State.
MR. ARGOE:

If. I follow your question, I don.’t think

title passage is the point that you would look to in —
QUESTION:
MR. ARGOE:

What are you looking for then, here?
We are looking to determine if we have,

first, an interstate sale.

And I state that we need go no

further and that's in line with the decision that the South
Carolina Supreme Court issued, that we had a sale in intra­
state commerce, a local sale.

MR. ARGOE:

MR. ARGOE:

Because title passed in South Carolina?
Title?
Because title passed in South Carolina?
Because title passed in South Carolina.

Because title could not have passed without South Carolina.
Second, because the shipment could not be accepted without
South Carolina.
QUESTION;

With any other product, then, you would

say South Carolina couldn't impose those requirements of making

32

title pass in South Carolina or prohibiting acceptance except
in South. Carolina.
MR. ARGOE:

Title passage will not, in my opinion,

control the applicability of Public Law 86~272.

Or the

The commerce clause speaks, notwithstanding

State law, title passage, and it. would protect any shipment
in which the transfer is from without the State to within the
State.
QUESTION:

All of which gets you back to the concessior

you made before, that you have to hang on the Twenty-First
Amendment,
MR. ARGOE:

This regulation is not under attack.

The case would depend upon the authority granted to the state
under the Twenty-First. Amendment, yes, your Honor.
QUESTION:

Could South Carolina require that oranges

from Florida, or cheese from Minnesota, be shipped by common
carrier as you do with liquor?
MR. ARGOE:

The State of South Carolina, in my

opinion, would not have the authority under the commerce clause
to regulat® the shipment into the State from without the
State of any articles in ordinary commerce.
QUESTION:

That brings you back to the Twenty-First

Amendment.
MR. ARGOF.:

We are back to the Twenty-First

Amendment, which states that the State is granted exclusive

33

control over liquors which are brought, into it for use or
delivery therein,
QUESTION:

Well,, just to make sure I understand you,

if in connection with meat the producer ships in to his
representative in the State

and

exactly the same procedure

is gone through here in connection with meat as happens here
in connection with liquor, you would say that the Federal
tax statute would control there, even though title passed in
the State?
MR, ARGOE:
QUESTION:
MR. ARGOE:

I'd say that the State has no —
That's not what I am —
— authority.

The State has no

authority to erect a trade barrier.
QUESTION:

I'm not suggesting the State erected any.

I'm saying the producer happened to run his business that way.
He just ships it in to his representative, but the only thing
he does is ship it in to the representative and the
representative immediately delivers it to the distributor.
Would he then be subject to South Carolina tax?
MR. ARGOE:

This Court has upheld in the Northwestern

States case ~
QUESTION:
MR. ARGOEs

Yes, but that's not ray question.
—the right of the State to tax such a

transaction.
QUESTION:

So you say, yes, South Carolina could tax

34
such a transaction»
HR. ARCOE:

Or it could tax the income produced

because of such transaction.
QUESTION;

Just because he shipped it to his

representative rather than directly to the distributor.
MR. ARGOE:

Well, I'm not sure that I understand

your question, Mr. Justice White.

I state that if the sale is

an intrastate sale, if it's shipped to his representative, then
it becomes an intrastate sale

any subsequent sale made by

the producer representative or by a producer’s employee.
But if the transaction is on© in interstate commerce, this
Court has recognized the right of

a

State to tax the net

income resulting from that transaction, provided that that
tax is an apportioned tax which bears a reasonable relationship
to the activities within the State.
QUESTION:

You mean they can tax — say, they send

the papers to a bank instead of to the producer representative
in order to facilitate credit transactions.
MR. ARGOE:

The technicalities of the paper are not

the important point that. I would like to emphasize in this case.
It is the fact that the title, the right, the ownership, and
the possession of the goods are retained by the producer so
long as they are in South Carolina.
QUESTION:

Mr. Argoe, isn't the State’s contention

here basically the Twenty-First Amendment gives it the

35

authority to regulate the way liquor distributors and sellers
organise their business within the State, and as a result of
those regulations, the way that Heublein conducted its
business here is in fact outside the scopa of the Federal
Commerce Tax Act.
MR. ARGOE:

Your Honor, that is correct.

It's the

actual activities of Heublein in the State which bear out the
right of the State to impose its tax on that income produced
in ’the State.

We are not concerned with —

QUESTION:

Is there another way of saying that that

the Twenty-First Amendment gives authority to South Carolina
so

to require the liquor producer

to localize its operations

within South Carolina as to avoid the application of the
Federal statute?
MR. ARGOE:
QUESTION:

Your Honor, I agree with that statement.
And that's what you say South Carolina

has done her©.
MR. ARGOE:

I say we have — the statutes, yes,

have required the activities to become so localized as to
exceed the minimum standards for protection set out in Public
Law 36-272.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Argo©.

Do you have anything further, Mr. Piga?
