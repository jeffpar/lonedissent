CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

Mr. Volk.
ORl\L ARGUMBNT OF CHARLES R. VOLK, ESQ . ,
ON
MR. VOLi(:

nmIALF

OF THE PETITIONER

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The Pittsburgh Press Company has, as most newspapers
in the country did have, a system -- and still do, I might add
a system of classifying its llelp Hanted advertisements
under either Male or Female.
Sometime after the passage of the Civil Rights Act
and after EEOC Guidelines, which indicated that male and
female, as such, might be proscribed, and after the EEOC
promulgated some Alternative Guidelines, which have since
been overturned again by the EEOC in one of their changes
of guidelines, The Pittsburgh Press went to a system of
Male Interest and Female Interest and a third column heading,
Male-Female.
Appropriately and prominently displayed in this
in the wantads themselves, at the heads of the columns,
were a rather large disclaimer box, entitled "Notice to Job
Seekers", which pointed out that the classification was for

4

reader interest only and should not be construed as being a
limitation, since most laws were laws in most jurisdictions,
which proscribe discrimination on the basis of sex.
QUESTION:

Who made the decision, just as a matter

of fact, as to which column each ad went in?
MR. VOLK1 1\s to which column each ad went in?
record is fairly complete on that, Mr. Justice White.

The
The

system is that the advertisement calls up and in essence says
where he wants it.

If he does not express a preference for

placement of the ad, the newspaper will help him, where most
ads of this type, Secretaries-Female, would appear.
QUl:STION:

So in this case there are instances, I

suppose we• re talking ads, part of which the ne\lspaper made
the decision a& to which column it went in?
MR. VOLK:
QUESTIOUs

Yes, the newspaper will help.
Will help -- where it's the one that

makes the decision as to which column to put it in.
MR. VOLKs

It makes the final -- it reserves for

itself the final determination; but I would be fatuous and
untrue if I told this Court that that's the way it happens in
actual practice.

In actual practice, the advertiser who is

seeking an employee calls in -QUESTION1

Invariably, then, the advertiser is the

one who finally says to the newspaper, "11ell, now that I've
talked to you, I suggest it go into this column"?

5

MR. VOLK:

Yes.

Yes, sir, that ' s essentially the

way it works.
1\nd now we have Male Interest and Female Interest.
The City of Pittsburgh passed an ordinance -QUESTION: So this isn't an independent judgment of
the newspaper as to which -- it isn't its judgment as to
whether this job is more attractive to males or females?
MR. VOLK:

case, no.

It isn't its judgment in any specific

I would be fatuous if I said that.
However, we do contend that the newspaper gets into

the act by making an editorial decision that there are jobs
-- there is a large body of differing interests between males
and females as they relate to the job market.

And it is the

decision of the newspaper to run column headings appealing
to this read interest and permitting advertisers to place
jobs, in that column.
QUESTION:

Yes, but if the advertiser said -- if in

each case the advertiser said to put it in the other colUil1Jl,
the newspaper would put it in the other column?
MR . VOLK:

Yes, it would.

In this particular

case -QUESTION:

But it's not its judgment in any case as

as to whether the job is more fitting for males

to which
or females?

MR. VOL.I<:

Not on the record.

There could be, of

6

course, occasions where the newspaper would nudge it into one,
or refuse to carry it1 refuse to carry, perhaps, a go-go
dancer in the Male section.

But we can search throughout the

record and not find any reference to that, I don't believe,
sir.

I've re-read the record very carefully prior to this
hearing.
QUESTION:

But is there -- again, as a matter of

fact, is there any question but what the decision to set up
the classified ads, the Help Wanted ads, under this format was
exclusively the decision of your client, the newspaper?
MR, VOLK:

Absolutely, sir.

That's why we're here.

QUESTION, That's what I thought.
MR, VOLK,

It is the very strongly held opinion of

Scripps-Jloward Hewspapers, who have the controlling interest
in the Pittsburgh Press, and in the Pittsburgh Press that this
does serve a legitimate reader and advertiser function in
providing a, well, similar to playing Twenty Questions; the
first question is always, "Is it animal, vegetable, or
mineral?"

1\nd this makes. a gross categorbiation from which you

take off.
We feel that the cultural patterns -- or biological;
we won't get into that debate, I trust -- for some reason
men and women in this country prefer different types of jobs
and it is a legitimate newspaper function to cater to these

7

differences by putting the ads in -- well, by providing
differing colUllllls wherein advertisers can place these ads.
QUESTION: And the proof is that advertisers utilize
them?
MR, VOLK:

Yes.

If one reads the record and the

allegations of the original complainants in this case, one
would assume that these are placed there solely for the purposes of invidious discrimination that everybody who places
an ad for a secretary is seeking to discriminate against male
secretaries.
On the contrary, I think we could take judicial
notice of the fact that the average advertiser is merely
seeking an employee, and the idea of discrimination, one way
or another, doesn't come into his mind.
employee.

tie's looking for an

If he advertises for a truck driver, the odds of

him getting a female truck driver are relatively limited,
no matter where he puts the ad.
Therefore, it is, even for the reader, a service
which permits maximum -- for the advertiser, I'm sorry, for
the advertiser it is a service which permits maximum reader
response.
The complainants in this case and the City have made
much that this is a service for the advertisers.

It is a

service for the advertiser, it is a service for the reader.
It is an intention, a device to get maximum response to an ad.

8

QUESTION:
for llelp Wanted.
Wanted?

!low about the -- now, these were all ads

How about ads for Positions Wanted, Jobs

That is job seekers advertising.
MR. VOLK:

Job seekers are neutered.

There aren't

very many of them in regard to number, and they are merely
placed in a Ilelp Wanted, or Situations Wanted ad.
QUESTION: All just neutered, indiscriminately?
l~R. VOLK:

Yes, sir.

Now, -QUESTION;

Would you reject an ad if it said,

"Middle-aged woman wants housekeeping job"?
MR. VOLK:

Yes, they do that. They don't feel,

necessarily, that they're compelled to; but the press does,
in cooperation with the Pittsburgh Human Relations Commission,
engage in a voluntary screening process on these ads.
It's part of our contention here that the First
Amendment does not require them to do soi that's also the
contention in the Hunter case, which is pending before this
Court.
QUESTION:

If it is a middle-aged woman who wants a

job, isn't she -- and she wants to say she is a middle-aged
woman who wants a job, you wouldn't reject her ad because of
that, because she didn't say she was a man, would you?
MR, VOLK:

I believe the City would attempt to get

her -- to dissuade her from placing it --

9

Qt.mSTION1 Really?
MR. VOLK1

-- because of their agreement with the

Human Relations Commission.
Of course we reject all kinds of ads.

I just got

involved in massage parlors recently
QUESTION1 That' s true, -MR. VOLK:
QUESTION:
MR.

VOLK:

-- in rejecting ads for --- that's a different subject.
We do censor ad content voluntarily,

based on the editorial judgment of the newspaper,
QUESTION: Dut you see no First 1\Jl\endment problem
in either rejecting or trying to control an ad, "Middle-aged
woman wants housekeeping job"?
MR.

VOLKr

Yes, sir, I see a First l\mendment problem

in forcing a newspaper to do it.

I thin!: they ' ve got the

right to censor it if they wish.
But I see a First Amendment problem if the newspaper
wished to resist, which is precisely the case in the Hunter
case, which of course is sort of a companion to this one,
in which petition for rehearing on certiorari is pending
before this Court.
That was precisely the issue there.
QUESTION :

1\nd --

Mr, Volk, sometime in the last two or

three weeks I remember seeing some sort of a statement f r om
some paper that it was going to start publishing wantads for

10

nothing, without charging people for them.

l\nd that led me

to wonder whether want-ads,from the newspaper's point of view,
are an inducement to buy the paper to the readers as well as
a way of raising revenue, so far as the newspaper is concerned.

MR. VOLK:

Yes.

It's part of our contention --

I will have it later in my argument -- that a newspaper, Mr.
Justice nehnquist, is a forWll, a country marketplace, if you
will, a noman forum of the flow of information and ideas.
And a very significant part of this is the want-ad
columns.

They are used by the Department of Labor, for

example, as one of their indicators of economic health, the
number of lines appearing in the accumulated want-ads throughout the country.
They are an interchange of people who have a right
to a job, seeking a job, and people who wish to hire people,
trying to find these people who are seeking jobs,

It provides

a very major community service.
Now, I'm not prepared to answer whether the company
makes money on them or not.

I suspect it does.

They charge

for want-ads, and they do make a lot of their revenue in the
newspaper through advertising, of course; and I suspect it is
profitable.

The Pittsburgh Press has a massive organization,

accepting, editing and setting up classified want-ads.
But it is, and we are hotly contending that it is a
major community service, and we further contend -- that's why

11

we're here -- that the complainants find this to be a major
throat through which job applications flow, the job seeker
seeking employers; and if they can control the discrimination,
what they feel to be a discriminatory aspect of this, at that
throat, then they can take a big step fozward in eliminating
discrimination without the difficulty of proving any
individual act of discrimination or any individual intent
to discriminate.

They can get what they culturally seek, which is
broader job opportunities of broader job opportunities for
women, something which we don't not neces sarily disagree with
editorially; but we feel that the place ~o battle this is
not in the want-ad pages of the newspaper, particularly as it
relates to the judgment of the newspaper as to how they're
going to run those ads .
I hope that convolute an answer adequately addressed
itself to your question, sir.
The Pittsburgh Press was, after Commission hearings,
eventually found to be violative of the Pittsburgh City
Ordinance in the way they place these ads.

They were found

specifically guilty of Section 8(j), which is aiding an
employer in the act of discrimination.
It is important to note that no -- in the findings
of fact of the Commission

no act of discrimination on the

part of any employer was found as a fact .

There was minimal

l2

testimony presented at the hearing, on the basis of one
potential discriminatee, but no proof was ever addressed that
this particular job situation was covered by the Ordinance.
The Ordinance has several exceptions.

There can be a basic

occupational qualification -- a bona fide occupational
qualification exemption.

It applies to only employers of

five or more , and it is limited to the City of Pittsburgh
itself, and does not apply to domestic help,
So there was no indication in the one bit of
evidence presented that it met any of these tests, and the
Commission did not so find that it was discriminato.r:y.
When we appealed the case through Common Pleas
and through the Commonwealth Court, we were arguing (a) no
discrimination was found, and (b) it was a violation of the
freedom of the press to impinge on this judgment of the
newspaper as to how it was going to arrange its classified
editorial pages.
In both cases we were, if I may use colloquial words,
sloughed off, simply saying that it is the law of the land
that commercial advertising is not subject to First 1\mendment
rights.
These, of course, are all contained in the opinions
in the record.
The case usually cited was Valentine vs. Chrestensen,
and we are here today to ask this Court to extend its concepts

13

of what constitutes First J\rnendment rights in a commercial
context.

1\s

Mr. Justice Douglas said in 1:he concurring opinion

in Cammarano vs. United States, in speaking of Valentine vs.
Chrestensen, "The ruling was casual, almor;t offhand.

J\nd it

has not survived reflection."
lie also said the press in its historic connotation
comprehends every sort of publication which affords a vehicle
of information and opinion, which is precisely what we're
talking a!Jout in this free flow of informiltion here.
And I think very well put was a comment in the
Harvard Law neview article on Oeceptive 1\clvertising, in 80
Harvard Law neview, where the col1\Jnentator said:

Yet no court

talking about Valentine vs. Chrestensen -- Yet no court has
undertaken to explain why commercial advertisinq doe~ not
deserve the title "speech" which enables and protects social
and religious advocacy; and it went on to call it the stepchild of the First 1\mendrnent.
!Jow, we hold that in a developinq line of cases in
this Court, that the Valentine decision, which ~:ct., referred
to in the circuit court in the Hunter case, as being an
unbroken line of authority from Valentine on.

On the contrary,

it may be unbroken, but it is a hazy and indistinct line at
best; and in my reading of the cases, occasionally, if not
broken, it certainly disappears like a road line on a snowy
day. 1\nd we feel that the concepts developing in this Court,

I

14

as enunciated in llew York Times vs. Sullivan and in the
dissents in nread vs. Alexandria, and in all of the newspaper
cases, from Grosjean on, indicate that the Valentine case was
simplistic, that the words and phrases of the circuit court,
which s~id absolute prohibition of expression in the market
place is illegal and is not to be saved by any commercial
taint attached to the expression, requires very serious
redefinition by this Court.
We are asking you to do so, Honorable ,Tustices.
QUESTIOlf I

nut you' re not -- does your case hang

on that?

rm. VOLJ<s noes our case hang on that? our case
hangs on two points:

one is the freedom of the press

argument; and the -QUESTION:

Well, I know, but let's assume Valentine

survives -- is to survive.
MR. vnti,:

Then do you lose?

If Valentine survives, in some of its

grosser language, its simplistic language, if no distinctions
can be drawn, we may very well lose.
QUP.STION1 Because I would assun? you wouldn't -- if
there is any way around Valentine, that's reasonable, you
would suqqes we do that first rather than overrule?
MR. VOLK:

Yes.

Valentine, as I am sure you know,

Mr, Justice l'lhite, is a two-page opinion.

The circuit court,

I believe, is two pages, it could be three; it's very short.

15

The circuit court opinion was a long and very
closely reasoned opinion, and Valentine, just as ltr. Justice
Douglas said, the opinion appears casual, almost offhand.
And yet everybody has cited it for authority, that commercial
speech deserves no protection, has no Pirst 1\11\endment rights.
This has been repeated so often in the authorities,
citing Valentine, that we find that it's an inverted pyramid,
it's a
(lUJ:STION1 Well, I thought a major part of your
argument perhaps was that even if commercial speech isn't
protected, there's more to this speech here than commerce,
MR. VOLK:

Oh, there certainly is.

There is an

editorial -QUESTION:

Well, forget about that part of it, if --

I suppose you say that we could decide the case in your favor
without overruling Valentine at all?
MR. VOLK1

Yes, you could, by deciding -- unless

you take an extremely simplistic view of Valentine, which is
to say if it's commercial it has no protection.

I think you've

already said in New York Times vs. Sullivan that merely
because a matter is commercial, newspapers are bought and sold,
wages are paid, money changes hands, --

QUBSTIONt

Hell, the advertisement in Times was

distinguished from Valentine, wasn't it?
MR. VOLK1

Yes, it was.

lG

QUEf.TION1

That was an advertisement in new York Times

v. Sullivan.

Mn. VOLi: 1

Yes, it was a political --

QUEf.TION:

It was an advertisement.

Qt:Jr.STIOU:

It was paid.

1m. VOLK:

/\n

QUCf.TION:

1\nd it was said that it was --

•

advertisement.

rm. VOLi{: 1\nd in Valentine -(lllr.STIOU:

Valentine v. Chrestensen had nothing to

do with the rirst J\mendJTient questions raised by that advertisement.

That's what Times v. Sullivan held, wasn't it?
MR. VOLK:

Yes.

Valentine, of course, --

QUESTION: 1\nd are you suggesting you may make the
same arg\Jl!lent, perhaps for different reasons, as to this, as
to these argwoonts?
MR. VOLK1

Yes,

Yes.

I'm contending that as we

begin to balance the various interests here, we can't simply
say that just because it's commercial it has full First
Amendment rights, just because -- I'm sorry, sir.
QtITTSTION:

I just wonder, then, if the question

Justice Nhite put to you is one you ought to address yourself
to1 namely, asslll1ling that ~ t i n e v. Chrestensen is not to
be overruled --

MR. VOLK:

Yes.

QtmSTION1

-- like the advertisement in the New York

17

Times v. Sullivan, ought not we agree that these, too, should
be distinguished?
rm.• VOLK:

ne certainly think that you should, sir.

QIJI:STION: Why?

rm. VOLK:

We feel that the help wanted arrangement,

we have two points on that, both of which can be distinguished
from Valentine unless, as you did in Sullivan, as I said,
unless you would take an extremely rigid view of Valentine,
that help wanted ads is editorial comment.

It is a statel'lll!nt,

-- the way we arrange them -- is a statement of the editor's
opinion as to how best to service the readers and best appeal
to the readers, just the way he arranges his paper vis-a-vis
placing of television -- the television section, vis-a-vis
the placing of the sports pages, and vis-a•vis where the
editorial paqe is versus the front page ~-here the average
reader wouldn't be too enthused by it, to buy the paper, he
puts it in the Middle,
One May make a social conmientacy that maybe it
should be on tho front page.

We say how he arranges his

newspaper is an editorial judgment, and that this is not
commercial.
1\nd secondly, if it is, it is a mixed editorial
and commercial policy,
Now, want-ads, as I pointed out in answer to a
question, are a basic community service, they are like a

18

conanunity billboard.

l'lnd we feel that this is a forU111 that

should be intruded upon only with great caution, as in new
York Times vs . Sullivan.
I think it falls into Dr. IICJiklejohn's theory of

governing importance, as we know, that theory is an extremely
broad one, governing importance is merely not politics .

/'Is

quoted in !larvard Law Review, in that article on Oecepti ve
Advertising, ~le;;Jclejohn' s concept of governing interest is
very broad indeed, including those forms of thought and
expression within the range of human collll'lunication from which
the voter deriyes the knowledge, intelligence, sensitivity to
human values, required to sanely and objectively judge the
power and duty of self-government.
OUJ-:ST~ON:

There's a great difference between

somebody using its expertise and its political thought and
its editorial policy as to Vietnam and as to somebody getting
a job as a plumber.
MR. VOLK:

That argument has been made and has

attractive merit, until we realize that we are in a law
explosion, that we are -- those of us who labor in this
vineyard out there see that every passage of every new Act of
Congress, we have new guidelines, new regulations, and new
rules that are imposed upon business.

And we find that the

newspaper business -our.sTION:

Well, business is not protected by the

19

First 1\11\endmcnt.
MR. VOLK:

Well, I'd like to think that business has

some protections under the First J\mendment, Mr. Justice
Marshall.

I think a newspaper -QUESTIOH1 Well, I don't think the pll.U'!lbing business

has any protection under the First J\mendroent,
MR, VOLK;

Well, I think the plumbing business, if

he places a commercial advertisement in a newspaper, has
certain First hr,endment riqhts to express his -- to put his
ad in.

I think that's what our case is, to some degree, all

about, that the commercial context is not totally devoid of
First Amendment protection.
hnd just because somebody buys it or sells it or
offers a cotnMercial product does not leave them to the tender
mercies of the due process aspect of the Fifth 1\rnendment
alone, but does come under some First 1\mendment protection,
and that it is the duty of the courts, I think, to balance
the hazard involved, the harm to be remedied with the right
to be expressed.

J\nd one of these is the right of a newspaper -a newspaper, when you know how -- I shouldn't phrase 1 i; that
way, of course you know,

The First Amendment doesn't make it

all freedom of speech, it mentions the press separately;
it says freedom of the speech and of the press.

The press

has been a peculiar institution in this country since the days

20

of the Framers of the Constitution, with Jan Pieter Zinger,
in his trial.

The press is a major complex business, which

provides a basic interflow of communications and ideas, and
one of them is want-ads.
One of the aspects here is the placement of want-ads.
And it may be a small chip, as we say in our brief, I like to
refer to it as the Lilliputians tying doun Gulliver.

He's a

big giant, and every little rope that they put across him is
no bigger than a sewing thread, eventually tied him with girth.
And that's what we have with the newspapers, as these
guidelines proliferate and the newspapers become the enforcement arm of agencies seeking to produce neritorious -- or
not meritorious, we don't pass judgment on that here.
not trying to redraft the ordinance.

I'm

But as these agencies

attempt to use the newspapers of the country as enforcement
arms, as they have here, and as they did in Hunter, making
them a screening agency, this impinges on the freedom of that
newspaper to control its pages -QUESTION1

Does the newapaper retain the right to

take what they like of it?
MR. VOLK:

I'm sorry, sir, I missed the first part

of your question.
QUESTION: The newspaper retains the right to take
whatever regulations they like and reject those they don't
like, as witness the fact that you said the middle-aged woman

21

couldn't put the ad in -MR. VOLK1

In the Pittsburgh Press.

QUESTION:

Yes.

So you take what regulations you

like and you discard what you don't like.
MR. VOLK:

Well, --

QUESTION1

Is that your position?

Mn.

VOLK1

-- the -- Our position is that those

regulations -- well, yes, on that't>ne1 that was a voluntary
act.

Merely by cominitting a voluntary cooperation with the

Human Relations Col'lmission, I don't think obligates us to
take the whole law, if it impinges on us some way we wish to
challenge in court,
The Pittsburgh Press Company decided that it had a
commitment to civil rights and to certain social change, and
did indeed work with the city's Human Relations Commission
and with the State Cominission on the content of ads,

But it

did not do so under compulsion of law, were they were forced
to do something which they, in their best judgment, did not

think was proper, they fought, and here

WE-

are,

Now, I say that we can't pick and choose those
regulations which we find meritorious, but most certainly,
sir, we have the right to challenge those regulations which,
in our opinion, impinge on the freedom to run that newspaper
in an efficient manner in conducting the interflow of
information in the way we see fit.

22
In that Hunter case, the circuit court said that
the newspaper has no problem divining the intent of the ads
that it publishes.

r.nd even though the

nuo guidelines, under

which they are working in the Civil Rights Act of 1968, say
that the use of catch words, locations, which might indicate
a discriminatory intent in housing are proscribed.

J\nd the

newspaper is a co-defendant in these cases.
Yet the circuit court says the newspaper has the
duty to divine the intent of those ads that it prints.
Here we have exceptions to this ordinance.

The

Coll\l1\0nwealth Court has found that the City of Pittsburgh cannot
regulate the want-ad advertising of advertisers outside the
city, merely because the paper is printed there.

We have the

under-five employment exemption; we have the domestic employment exemption.

J\nd yet we have to guess, or find out,

whether the employer who is seeking an cinployee fits under
one of these exemptions.
('ltm!';TION:

J\nd we do so at our peril,

Mr, Volk, some communities have an

ordinance, for example, that prohibits a restaurant from
employing waitresses between the hours of 2:00 A.M, and 6100
11.. M,

MR, VOLK:

QUESTION:

Yes.
Do you have such a one in Pittsburgh,

do you know?

MR, VOLK1

No, sir; not to

ffl'/

knowledge,

We used

23

to have a barmaid law in Pennsylvania, but that's been
repealed.
QUESTION,

Well, if you did, and a restaurant

operator wanted help for the graveyard shift, what would be
the attitude -l~R. VOLKs

Well, our attitude, we could take the ad

any way we wanted it; the city's attitude is he's got to go

and get a bona fide occupational exemption certificate from
the city, and then when they present us the certificate we
can print it.
Incidentally, you did print a disclaimer

QUESTION:
in your newspaper -MR. VOLK:

Yes.

QUESTION,
MR. VOLK:

Are you placing much emphasis on this?
Well, I wrote it.

[Laughter. J
MR. VOLK1

Disclaimers have been challenged, of

course, in civil rights cases for a long time.

But I think

where you have a record like this one and a legitimate body
of desire for jobs, I think you can legitimately rely, to some
degree, on a disclaimer.

It's merely not a guise.

tie say, too, that in publications of ljmited interest,
such as Sports magazine, the magazine MS, the black newspapers
that we have in most of our urban centers.

If they take an

ad, it is, in essence, an expression of a preference for the

24

limited readers, the limited group of readers that they
represent.

1\nd that if our newspaper can't take a job

put

an ad under a Female Interest colUl'llll, then it probably couldn't
put it under the society page, and we seriously doubt, if
you extend that, that putting it in a special-interest
publication constitutes expression of a preference, we wonder
what will happen to the LFCC regulations and affirmative

action programs that forces government contractors to apply
to advertise for jobs in black newspapers, Spanish-speaking
newspapers in appropriate areas, and others.

Because those

are definitely an expression of a prefere~ce.
Are those newspapers to be placed on their peril
to be sure that the advertiser also advertise soma place
else, to get a wide range or body of response to the ad?
Judge Crumlish of the Commonwealth Court addressed
himoelf to that very point, he mentioned, I believe, MS
magazine and Ebony, when he discussed1

are we to really get

in and censor, and by making them aiders, which is what we
were accused of and found guilty of here , being an aider in
discrimination merely because the Ku Klux Klan Journal
runs a - - if they have such a thing -- runs a want- ad section.
1\nd I think we can take judicial notice of the
fact that if an employer placed a want-ad for an employee
in the Ku Klux 1aan Journal, he is not likely to get too
many employees who were not white 1\nglo-Saxon Protestants , and

25

probably Southern.
I think we find that the newspapers are being
impinged on with some significant degree, and as one court
said, this may be an idea whose time has come; but we ask
that it should be let come through the free interchange of
ideas and through the interchange of advertisers and readers,
and through cultural change, if it will.

Let it not come

through government fiat and the cultural predilections of
local speoial-interest groups or government officials.
Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EUGENE D, STRI\SSBURC-,ER III, ESQ.,
ON DP.Rl\LF OF TUR nESPONPENTS

,m.

STRASSBURGER1

Hr. Chief ;rustice, and may it

please the Courts
I represent the City of Pittsburgh and its Human
Relations Comr.tission.
The Commission, like the EEOC and similar co111111issions
in other States, many of which are represented by ainicus
briefs here today, was created in an attempt to eliminate
discrimination, including employment discrimination.
A 1969 amendment to the Human Relations Ordinance
of the City of Pittsburgh added a prohibition on the basis of
sex to the other prohibitions on race, religion , national
origin grounds.

26

The relevant section of the ordinance for our
purposes is Section 8, Section 8(e) makes it an unlawful
employment practice to publish or cause to be published an
advertisement indicating any discrimination on the basis of
sex.
Section 8(j) prohibits any person, which is defined
so as to include a newspaper, from aiding or participating in
the doing of an unlawful employment practice,
The national Organization for Women filed a complaint
alleging that the press had violated Section 8(j) in permitting
advertisers to advertise in these sex-segregated columns.
Tho Commission, after a hearing, and then the
common Pleas Court and the Commonwealth courts of Pennsylvania,
held that there were violations of the ordinance and that no
constitutional rights of petitioner had been abridged.
Thero are two constitutional questions raised here.
The First 1\mendment question, which I will deal with, and the
due process question, which counsel for the National Organization for l~omen will discuss.
Respondents believe that there is no First J\mendment
violation in this case.

This court has continually held that

constitutionally protected speech is less than absolute, and
the courts have pointed out several ways.

Justice Harlan,

in the Koni9sberg case, mentioned two.
First he said that speech in certain contexts did

27

not have First 1\11\endment protection; and secondly, he said
that general regulatory statutes, not intended to control the
content of speech but incidentally limiting its unfettered
exercise, were permissible so long as the laws were justified
by an important governMent interest.
I think that to these two limitations we can add a
third, which rnay just be a sub-category of the second: and
that is that conduct, even where there is some idea associated
with it, does not have the First .l\mcndrnent protection that
pure speech has.
The petitioner's activity in this case, we believe,
fails to qualify for First Amendment protection on not just
one of these bases, but on all three.
First of all, it's commercial speech, and this is
one of the contexts where this Court has held that the First
Amendment does not apply.

It beqan in the unanimous decision

of this Court in Valentine v. Chrestensen, in 316 U.S., where
the Court said that while freedom of communicating information
of course enjoys a hiqh degree of protection, the Constitution
imposes no such restraint on government as respects purely
commercial advertising.
We believe that Valentine is good law today, it's
been cited with approval by this Court in many cases, which
we point out in our brief1 and it's been cited with approval
in New York Times v. Sullivan, which we find very surprising

28

that the petitioner relies on.
advertisement in that case.

That was a political

It recited grievances, it

protested claimed abuses, it expressed opinion, and the Court
was very careful to distinguish that political advertisement
fr01.11 the commercial advertisement in Valentine v. Chrestensen.
And I think that New York Tirnes, the political
advertisement there can be distinguished from the advertisements
involved in this case on the same basis.

This non-protection

of commercial speech, we believe makes a great deal of
sense.

Professor Emerson has rationalized it as applying

as co111111ercial speech applying to a separate sector of
economic activity, an area that involves economic interests
rather than the interests of free expression, the production
of goods and services.
In the terms that this Court used in Chaplinsk~ v.
New Hampshire,

we're not deaUng with any essential part of

exposition of ideas.

I again find it surprising that

petitioner would rely on the Meiklejohn view of First
Amendment applying to governing speech, because we feel that
that's a situation where

his theory says that public

affairs, speech that has to do with public affairs is protected.

And I think that this Court indicated in New York Times that
it was endorsing the Meiklejohn theory when it distinguished
between public libel and private libel.
rt would seem to me fairly obvious that this case

29

falls on the private side of the public-private dichotomy.
The petitioner's answer to this is, Well, the
advertisements themselves may not be ideas, but the column
headings are ideas.

They're different.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

t-le will take up there

after lunch, counsel,

[Whereupon, at 12100 noon, the Court was recessed,

to reconvene at 1100 p.m., the same day.]

hPTE!UIOON SESSION
[1:00 p.m.J

rm. CHIEF JUSTICE DURC:ER:

You may resume, Mr.

Strassburger.
OnAL hRC:UMENT OP EUGr:tlE B. STRASSBURGER III, ESQ.,
ON BE!ll\LF OF Tiffi RESPONDENTS -- Resumed

rm. STR!\SSBURGERs nr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Courts
Defore the luncheon break, I was indicating that
these commercial advertisements are non-ideas, and the
petitioner's response to this is to say that the ads themselves
may not be ideas but that the colW'11l headings are different,
that they are abbreviated editorial comment that certain jobs
are of r.iore interest to men than to women.

However, this arqument corresponds neither to the
facts nor the law.
In answer to the question that Justice White asked,
the paper does not give the slightest thought to whether the
advertised job interests men or woMCn, it goes wherever the
advertiser wants the ad to go, reqardless of whether the
newspaper might have thought that this is a female type job
or a male type job.
QUBSTION1

Dut the newspaper has, in setting up this

setup on its help wanted pages, given advance thought to the
proposition that

&Ollie

jobs may bo of more interest to women,

31

and other jobs of more interest to men.

It has given thought

to the basic idea, and has conceptualized that idea in the
setup of its classified advertising, hasn't it?

And that was

the newspaper's decision, at least that'3 what counsel answered
to me.
MR. STru\SSBURGER I

Your Honor, I don't think that

this is any rnore an idea than, say, that a violator of the
antitrust laws says that, well, his violation of the antitrust
laws shows his idea that monopoly is beneficial to society.
QUESTION: Well, but that doesn't involve -- perhaps
you're quite right.
But you're not contending here that it's the
advertisers who have forced the newspaper to do this, or have
persuaded the newspapers to do this, or that it's the
advertiser' s idea for the newspaper to set it up this way,
are you?

Because I understood the facts were otherwise.
MR. STJU\SSBURGBR:

No.

The newspaper sets up the

framework, but the advertiser, by placing an advertisement in
this sex-segregated column, is discriminating,

I think Mrs.

Matson will get into this in more detail, but the ordinance
defines discrimination as any difference on the basis of sex.
OtmSTION I

Yes.

MR. STRl\SSBURC,ER: And by placing an ad in this sexsegregated column, the advertiser is discriminating and the
newspaper is aiding that.

32

QUESTIONc

What about the hypothetical situation I

put to your friend, about the woman who is middle-aged and
has no skill except she knows how to taice care of a house,
putting an ad in the papers

"rtiddle-aqed woman wishes

housekeeping job, living in."
MR. STMSSBURGERs

No problem with that?
I completely disagree with the

answer that Mr. Volk gave.
QtmSTIOU: What would yours be?
MR. STMSSBURGER: Well, first of all, it's not
covered by the ordinance.
not jobs wanted.

We' re talkinq about help wanted,

The ordinance speaks of an employer, an

employment aqency or a labor union placin<J an ad indicating
discrimination.
QUESTIONS
other way now.

J\ll right.

Then turn it around the

Now we have a man who has a wife who is a

semi-invalid and two small, at least adolescent, children,
and he wants a housekeeper who is a woman, and he'd like some
stable, middle-aged woman.

Can he specify all of that in the

ad?
MR. STMSSBURGERs

He can do that because, No. 1,

he's not covered by the ordinance either, because the ordinance
excludes situations of five or fewer employees,
QURSTIONs All right.

Let's move over.

Now it's

an employment agency doing this.

MR, STRASSBURGERa

If the job is certified as a

33

bona fide -- as having a bona fide occupational qualification,
then either an eriployer or an employment agency can place this
type of ad.
This is why this screening argument that the
petitioner makes is a complete red herring in this case.
There is no screening argument.

Even if this were a

situation where the speech allegedly being chilled, aa in
Smith v. California, were protected speech, there wouldn't be
any screening argument because it's perfectly clear to the
newspaper whether this job has a bona fide occupation
qualification.

It doesn't have to guess whether there is a

BFOQ for this job.

Section 7(d) of our ordinance, as well as

a parallel provision in the State ordinance, provides that
if there is a -- if the employer wants a bona fide occupation
exemption, it can apply to the Commission and get that
exemption.
so there is no problem in your hypothetical.
QUESTION

nut the Commission isn't required to

give that exemption, isn't that some judrment left with the
Commission as to whether or not it will give such an exemption?

rm. STM.'lSDtJRGF.R: Well, certainly there is a
judgment involved, there's a judgment involved in all of
these Commissions as to whether a job cannot be performed
by a male, or cannot be performed by a woman, and perhaps the
exemption is somewhat broader than that, for instance, a man

34

probably could be a lingerie salesman, but probably it
would qualify for a bona fide occupational qualification under
our present situation.
This type of job has been granted a

nroo, even

though there is some testimony in the record that that
shouldn't qualify.

I don't know what the Co!llr.lission would necessarily
do with that sort of case, but as far as the Pittsburgh Press
is concerned, it doesn't have any problem as far as
screening these advertisements.

It knows, because there

either is an exemption or there isn't.
QUESTION: Who has to get the exemption, the employer
or -- the employment agency or the newspaper?
Mn. STMS::lBURCmn:

The advertiser, whomever that

may be.
tlow, in addition to the fact that the paper doesn't
consider whether this is a job that interests men or women,
even if this setup were created so as to cater to the reader
preference, that would not excuse this violation of the hct ,
and the circuit courts have so held.

In the Diaz case in the

Fifth Circuit, involving a stewardess, the employer arguedt
Well, my customers prefer women as performing this job on
airplanes.
And the court said that doesn ' t excuse discrimination, what your customers prefer.

Md even if --

35

QUESTION: Pid that case involve a newspaper?
MR. STRJ\SSBURGER:

No, Your Honor, it didn't.

QUI:STIOH: Well, that's the big difference here.
I mean that's at least one of the two issues here is the
First 1\Irlendrnent, and the First 1\Jnendment doesn't protect
airline companies.
MR. STRASSBURGER:

l7ell, Your l,onor, the first

contention is that this -QUESTION:

Unless they want to speak.

MR. STIU\SSBURGER1

-- that these are non-ideas,

and these headings can't raise non-ideas to the level of ideas.
And I'd like to point out that this statute, this ordinance
that we're dealing with here, is not an unusual statute.
There are, I think a holding in this case that the First
All1endJ'l1ent was violated would inferentially overturn many,
many other statutes, all of which have been sustained by the
courts on First 1\J\\endment grounds.
For instance, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which
was held by the Fifth Circuit, in the Hailes case, to prohibit
an einployer from placing a want-ad in a sex•segregated
column.
QUESTION:
QUESTION,

Well, it's one -- excuse me,
Have those holdings been predicated on

Valentine v. Chrestensen?
MR. STRASSBURGER1

Most of them have, Your Honor.

36

QUESTION:

It's one thing, it would occur to me,

to prohibit an employer from discriminating in his hiring
policies as among races or sexes or anything else, and also
to prohibit him from advertising that would indicate any

discrimination.

But that's quite another thing from

government putting a restriction on the newspaper as to what
it can print.
MR. STIU\SSBURGER: WE:11, Your Honor, -QUESTION:

In advance .

MR. STRASSBURGP.R: t7ell, as far as the in advance
argument is concerned, this Court and other courts have held
that the prior restraint argument does not apply where this
speech is not fully protected.

For instance in the Lorain

Journal case -QUESTION:

That all gets us back to Valentine v.

Chrestensen, doesn't it?
MR. STRASSBORGER:

No, Your Honor, it doesn't

necessarily.
First of all, we feel that this falls directly
within Valentine v. Chrestensen, the case is interpreting the
'64 Civil Rights hct, the '68 Civil Rights Act, and various
other statutes involving cigarettes, lotteries, corporate
press releases, this sort of thing, have all held that
commercial speech is not protected.
But in addition to this, even if we were to assume

37

that we are dealing with speech that in some circumstances
might have been protected, this Court has also held that
general regulatory statutes

which incidentally affect

speech can -- are permissible if there's a valid societal
interest involved.
For instance, just last term, in Branzburg v. Hayes,
which I'm sure you're familiar with, with all the publicity
recently, eight of the nine Justices here said that we have
to balance the First J\mendment interest of newspaper reporters
against the governmental interest in forced testimony.
You didn't all agree as to where that balance should
be drawn, but you all said it had to be balanced.
QUESTIONt

Yes, but that case didn't, either, involve

the government telling a newspaper what it could and could
not put in its newspaper.
MR. STRASSBURGER:

Well, there have been cases which

have so held in this Court -- it's our feeling that what the
petitioner says here is that we're entitled to special
protection, because we're a newspaper.
But in this economic area, it's not entitled to
more protection just because it has editorial fWtctions than
the art in Valentine was entitled to protection because it was
appended to the back of a political protest.
This Court, in the cases involving the National
Labor Relations Act, the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Sherman

38

Antitrust hct, has held that newspapers are subject to those
Acts, and in the Lorain Journal case, that was a case where
the newspaper was refusing certain advertisements because -it refused advertisements whenever the advertiser advertised
in a cor,petitor, competing radio station.

hnd this court

said it was peI'l11issible to tell that newspaper that you have to
accept advertisements from those advertisers.
QUF.STION:

Or at least you can't refuse them on that

ground, wasn't it more narrowly than that?
HR. STRASSDUR<mn:

l think that's probably true.

I know this r..ourt has before it cases now as to whether
various media have to accept certain advertisements, as to
whether they have the full freedom of contract there or not.
I don't think that's involved in this case,
O.UF.STION1 But you seem to separate the First
hmendment completely from the economic aspect, but could a
newspaper survive if it just sold the newspapers to readers
without any advertising?
HR. STRASSBURGF!R1

Your Honor, we' re not saying that

the newspaper can't have this advertising,

hll they have to

do is put it in a single column.
hccording to their argument, they're losing money
by putting it in separate columns.

I don't know whether

that's true or not, but it's clear from this record that there
is not much difference one way or the other as far as money

39

is concerned in this case.
This isn't a situation like the Grosjean case,
where there was an advertisement -- excuse me, a statute aimed
directly at a newspaper.

And here it's a situation where

there's a general anti-discrimination statute, a statute
premised on an important qovernmental interest here.
it's an overwhelming reason here.

I think

The vast amount of

discrimination aqainst women, the statistics are in the record
here, and Mrs. Matson will go into this.
1\nn in addition to the overwhelming reason for this,
the burden on the press is absolutely minimal,

If the press,

if the newspaper is expressing any kind of idea here -QtmSTION1

Mr, Strassburger, supposing that your

Commission applied the regulations and ordinance that it now
has and felt it just wasn't getting far enough in eliminating
employment discrimination, because there were still nuances
in the want-ads that it just couldn't seem to eliminate, and
suppose the City of Pittsburgh then decided that there will be
no help wanted ads permitted in the newspapers, we're going
to funnel them all through public employment agencies, where
we can make sure that these nuances are eliminated.
Now, would you think that was constitutional?
MR, STRASSBURGER:

Then you have the situation like

the Grosjean case, where the newspaper is really being deprived
of its life•blood, and I would think that that would be an

40

entirely different situation than we have here.
I would just like to say one other thing with regard
to the fact that this Court, even the absolutists on this
Court, with regard to free speech, have said that conduct can
be regulated.

1\nd that's what we have here.

isn't prohibited xrorn expressing its idea,

The newspaper
If all it were

doing was expressing an idea, it would be satisfied to
express it in an editorial or a news col~rnn.
But it says, t7ell, we have to do it in the want-ad
headings.
QUESTIOM1

What is the conduct?

MR. STRASSBURGER: The conduct is participating in
this discriminatory scheme.

And again and again, just in

the last few months ago in California v. LaRue, Justice
Rehnquist said that conduct does not have the protection that
pure speech has.
QUESTION1

Mr. Strassburger, in connection with the

distinction you are now drawing between editorial and
commercial advertising, may I put this hypothetical:
Suppose an employer, who profoundly disagreed with
the social utility of the ordinance in question, went to the
newspaper and said, I want to buy a full-page ad in which to
express ll1Y disapproval of the ordinance and include in it
a statement to the effect that I want to engage women only
for whatever his business may be, and I want to state the

41

reasons why I think they should be exempt from this law or
that the law is invalid.
Would that be something that, in your view, the
newspaper would be prohibited from publishing?
MR. STRASSBURC-.IlR:

Your Honor, if we' re dealing with

just the editorial type advertising, if they're not actually
hiring people, then I think it's a New York Times v. Sullivan
situation, and this is protected speech Wlder the First
Amendment.
'l'hey could have this editorial advertisement.
If, on the other hand, this is just a subterfuge
like Valentine v. Chrestensen, with protected speech on one
side and unprotected speech on the other, then I feel that
there's no protection for this, and they' i:e governed by the
ordinance, that they are violating the ordinance.
I want to conclude by saying that both the press in
its amicus, the Newspapers Publishers' Association, seem much
more concerned about future cases than this case. And it
seems to us that so long as this Court sits, it can prevent
the intrusions on the First Amendment, which petitioner fears
and which we desire no more than they.
Thank you,
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE DURGERa

Hrs. Matson, Hr,

Strassburger, your colleague, has used up some of your time,
but in view of these arguments we will give you your full ten

42

minutes.
Oru\L ARGUMENT OF MRS. MARJORIE II. MATSON,
ON BE!lll\LF OF TIIE INTERVENI?JG RESPONDENT

Thank you, Chief Justice Burger,

MRS. 111\TSON:

members of the Court:
I

a111

representing in this proceeding the National

Organization for Women.
The national Organization for Women, as I am sure
you must have heard or read in the newspapers, if nowhere
else, is an organization which is committed to the advancement of the rights of women, to the elimination of discrimination based upon sex.

It has been in existence for a number

of years, and in this case the original complaint was filed
by a male member of NOW, C',erald Gardner, the treasurer of the

organization and an active member in the group.
The organization participated in offering testimony
at the Commission, and was instrumental in bringing in the
federal officials who testified in support of the policy which
was adopted by the city ordinance, and which was being, we
contended, violated in terms of the want-ad classifications
used in the Pittsburgh Press, and the only other metropolitan
newspaper, the Post-Gazette.
The Commission found in our favor and made specific
findings of fact, which were then, when affirmed by the
highest state court to review this, our Commonwealth Court,

43

should be fairly conclusive of the issues involved here.
Particularly in terms of the limitations which this court has
observed in recent years as to the reviewal of substantive
due process questions.
Now, of course, the real thrust of this case is
the attempt by women to abolish a very important, albeit it
may seem subtle, attempt to keep women in the place that they
have traditionally been.

And in fact the argument for

petitioner suggests this, they talk about women being
secretaries, and apparently this is the basis for their whole
classification system.
That is, that there are certain kinds of jobs which
women have had traditionally, and therefore they should ought

to go on having in the future.
Now, this is the kind of thing that is involved
in this case, the feeling on the part of, no doubt, some of
the employers who advertise in the paper and certainly by their
own admission on the part of the newspaper, that women should
be kept in their place.
And this is the issue involved here, as to whether
they may in fact do that in view of the Equal Protection
Clause, the Pue Process Clause, the other aspects of the
Federal Constitution which have served to bring black people
out of bondage, and which now we are calling up to serve as a
way of meeting the economic problems of women.

44

1\t the hearings before the Commission, and we have
given you some statistics in our brief as well, and other of
the amicus briefs contain economic data here which is of
great significance in this case, because it does establish
that women have been discriminated against jobwise.
That they have been deterred from applying for jobs,
because they believe that they were not welcome. J\nd it is
at this point in the process the deterrence from even applying
for a job that the Pittsburgh Press comes into the picture.
These classification headings, as you by now are
very well aware, were set up by the press, but the place where
the ad is to go, whether it is to go under Female Interest or
Male Interest is determined, according to the testi1110ny of
the press employees who appeared, as being the decision of
the employer himself.
Now, the covered employer who comes to advertise
and who wants to discriminate ag~inst women, but knows that
it's against the law, and that he can't put in an ad saying
Males only, or can't put it under a Males Only heading, can
turn from this euphonism which is now being used by the
paper, the same headings that were used before -- the headings
that were used before were Jobs, Male Jobs, Female Jobs ,

Help wanted for Male or Female, now they have changed that
only slightly, only to say Male Interest, Female Interest.
so that the seamstress will look under Female Interest jobs,

45

and the tailor who makes much more will look under the Male
Interest jobs.
And this is such a -QUESTION: Well, why wouldn't it be enough for the
State to move against the employer and forbid the employe from
indicating

to

the paper any preference whatsoever, unless he

had a certificate?
MRS. MATSONs Well, Your Honor, the ordinance itself
provides for people to get a cer.tificate if they want a - if there is a bonda fide occupational qualification.
QUESTIONS

=understand

that.

MRS. MATSON: But we are trying to break down the
classification system.
QUESTION, Do you think the press would continue
this if the employer was forbidden , when the paper asked him
to specify_a column?

Let's for the moment assume that no

employer would ever break the law if it was forbidden

to

indicate a preference, and that whenever they were asked,
they'd say:
Do

Awfully sorry, we just couldn't care less.
you think the press itself would then go on with

this scheme?
MR.q. MATSON I Well, that question , I guess, woul d
have to be addressed

to

the press.

QUllSTIONs Well, don ' t you have to answer that
question in terms - - before you can justify p utting a prohibition

46

on the press itself?
MRS. 11ATSON1 Well, Your Honor, the thing is that

we

could knock off one employment agency after another and
go through all of those that's the clearetit cut case here,
I suppose get each of them enjoined from carrying the -QUESTION:
resources.

All right.

So it's a conservation of

There's only one newspaper.
MRS. MATSON:

It's a way -- well, there are two,

but they are published together, so it's the same
difference.
QUESTION: That's what I mean.
HRS. MATSON1 nut what we're trying to do is to get
at the advertising, which is the thing which

the advertising

headings which are the message which is being conveyed to
woman that they should stay aw;ry from applying for a
particular job.
1\nd as the Solicitor (",eneral said in the amicus
brief filed in this case, the only message meaningfully
communicated by the headings is that employers advertising
thereunder will discriminate in their hiring, and that thus
it does serve as a deterrence, you see, to women applying.
It's not anything that is said in the ad itself,
rather, it is the headings under which the ads appear which
deters women from applying for jobs for which they may very
well be qualified.

47

QUP.STION1 Well, I take it that you concede, don't
you, that if you could get an injunction against the press
you _could also get an injunction against the employer
frOlll communicating with the press as to what column to put it
in?
MRS. MATSON1 Well, then, you see, you would
QUESTION I Well, could you or couldn't you?
MRS. MATSON:

I don't knou that you could, as a

communication of that kind, I shouldn't think that we could
reach that very readil.y, Your Honor.
OUF!STION: l-!ell., not readily but legally, could you?
MRS. MI\TSON I

It seems to me that you would have to

enjoin the individual employment agency or employer from
advertising under a riale llelp Wanted column, or a Pernale, as
the case may be.
And in that case, I suppose that those employers
could resort to the Male-Female heading which is available and
which is practically not used at all, in terms of the column
inches of spaces, only 100 in an average issue of a Sunday
paper, as oompared with 1600 column inches of Male ads and
400 for Female ads.

so that you would have an immensely difficult
problem of reaching each of the employers, and it is a job
which really is not forced upon us when we have the ordinance
which says that anyone who aids in discrimination, and we say

48

that these headings are an aid, can be reached directly.
And this is what we are trying to do in this case, Your Honors.
MR. CIIIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.

Hr. Volk, you have about four minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES R. VOLK, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
I don't think I'll need that, Mr. Chief

MR, VOLK1
Justice.

May it please the Courts
Mr. strassburger said something I think needs to be
corrected.

When he pointed out that the press is not called

to do any screening.
This is an error which was pic{ed up
Appellate Division Courts of New York

by

the

in the National

Organization for Women vs. the State's Division of Human
Rights,

which was just reported in the CCH Employment Practices

Decision Service, wherein they distinguished the Pittsburgh
Press case in one of their own, where they did not permit a
court to bar the -- in other words, they ruled our way in
this particular given-fact situation.

They permitted the

sex-segregated want-ads to continue.
They distinguished the Pittsburgh Press case in
that the Pittsburgh Press had a ready screening device with
this certificate.

But that only applies to the one e~--emption,

the bona fida occupational qualification exemption.

The

49

ordinance also excludes domestics and it excludes who do not
live in the City of Pittsburgh, by Commonwealth Court order,
and it excludes employers of less than five.
So that the press would still have thrust upon it
the burden of screening out these other criteria.
QUESTION:

Mr. Volk, if Equal Rights Amendment is

ratified, is your First Jlrnendment argument in any difficulty?
MR. VOLK:

No, I don't think so.

Pennsylvania has

an Equal nights l\mendment to its own Con~titution, and I
•
apprehend
the Constitution as it reads today to provide

equal protection to women.

I don't hold myself out as a major

constitutional scholar, but I have personal difficulty in
seeing any rights that will be granted to won,en by the
Equal Rights AnlElndment that they don't already have by our
own glorious docUlllent, that has served us so well for so

many years.

I think they have all the rights that anybody else
has.
The only other point I wanted to point out is that
Mrs. Matson indicates that tho Pittsburgh Press is in
essence acting as a discourager of women.

Actually this is

not the case, the Pittsburgh Press is not attempting to keep
women in its place, whatever that may be, and I think that's
a racial epithet calculated to cause certain emotional
reaction in the Justices.

The Pittsburgh Press is not engaged

50

in any such an action at all.
The I>ittsburgh P.ress just simply wants to reflect
in its want-ads the status as it exists in job preferences,
and whether the National Organization fo.r Women likes it or
not, they do not wish to be conscripted as unwilling
hanissaries in the fight for social change, as the National
Organization for Women foreoee it.
Thank you, gentlemen.
MR. C!IIEJ' JUS'rICE BURGER1

Thank you, Mr. Volk.

Thank you.
The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 1:30 o'clock, p.m., the case was
submitted.)
