MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

We will hear arguments

next in No. 71-6042, Wardius against Oregon.
Mr. Kuhn, you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. MARVIN KUHN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. KUHN:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
Petitioner in the instant case was convicted

for

the sale of narcotics and sentenced to 18 months
imprisonment.

During the trial of his case, he was not

permitted to present alibi testimony through an alibi
witness and his own testimony, because he failed to comply
with the requirements of QRS 135.875, Oregon's notice of
alibi statute.
Pursuant to the requirements of this statute, the
defendant,not less than five days prior to trial, must file
a written intent of notice to rely on alibi evidence.

The

notice must include within it the place or places the accused
claimed to have been at the time the crime v?as alleged to
have been committed, plus the names and addresses of the
witnesses he intends to call.
The sanctions levied upon a defendant for failure
to comply, that the witness or witnesses are not allowed to
testify as to an alibi defense and under the construction of

the Oregon Court of Appeals the defendant himself is not
permitted to take the stand and give testimony as to his
whereabouts at the time the crime was alleged to have been
committed„
In the instant case,, both the defendant's prospec­
tive witnesses' testimony and his own were stricken.
Petitioner believes that this Oregon statute and as
construed by the Oregon Court of Appeals is unconstitutional
in that it denies him due process of law, because it fails,
one, to provide any reciprocity on the part of the state in
that it gives no discovery rights to the defendant.
Q

If it had, would you be here?

MR. KUHN:

If it had, I believe we would have been

hare, Your Honor, perhaps not on that issue but on the others.

I believe we would have been.
Q

But not on the attack on the alibi statute?

MR. KUHN:
grounds.

On the alibi statute, yes, on the other

However, on the reciprocity probably not on that

particular issue, no, sir.
Q

What would be left

if this provided

reciprocity?
MR. KUHN:

I believe that what would be left in

this particular case, Your Honor, is the fact that the
Oregon statute applies to the defendant's testimony and that
the requirement that he file a written notice as to his

5
whereabouts prior to trial as a condition of his taking the
stand would get us here.
Q

Did you ask for any disclosure that you did

not get?
MR. KUHN:

I was not the trial attorney, but from

the record there was no request.
Q

Did not the Oregon Court of Appeals say that

they just had no occasion to pass on the extent to which
reciprocity would be required, since the record did not.
raise the issue?
MR. KUHN:

Yes, Your Honor, the Court of Appeals

held that they would not reach this issue because the state
did not offer any rebuttal evidence.

However, the petitioner

does not feel that that is valid in this case because the
state was not required to offer any rebuttal evidence
because the defendant's alibi testimony was stricken from the
record.

So, there would be no reason for the state to

offer rebuttal evidence.

That was the reason given by the

Oregon court.
Petitioner also believes that the statute denies
him due process in that it prevents the defendant from
testifying in his own behalf if he fails to give notice as
required by the Oregon statute.

Also that it denies him his

Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate himself because of
the written notice required as a condition precedent to his

6

taking the stand and giving alibi testimony, and that it
denies him right to

Sixth Amendment rights of compulsory

process.
This Court in Williams v, Florida did uphold the
alibi statute from the State of Florida.

However, one of

the main bases, as petitioner reads the case, was that
Florida did provide for a liberal reciprocity in their
statute that the Oregon statute does not.

Under the terras of

the Florida statute, both the defendant and the state were
required to submit the names of their proposed alibi witnesses
the defendant for his alibi, the state for any prospective
rebuttal witnesses they may wish to call.
If either party under the Florida statute failed
to give the required notice, that party, including the
state, would not be allowed to call their alibi witnesses.
The Florida statute was therefore equal in placing the duty,
responsibility, as well as the sanction equally among the
pa.rties for failure to comply with it.

The Oregon statute

places the entire obligation on the part of the defendant
and requires nothing on the part of the state.

The state has

no duty to disclose any rebuttal witnesses, nor is there any
sanction applied against the state for failure to do so.
Q

Just from a reading from this one section of

the Oregon statute, is it not possible to read the Oregon
Court of Appeals opinion here as saying that had a request

7
been made to apply this same rule to the date, that very
likely as a matter of its interpretive authority it might
have applied that rule to the state?
MR. KUHN:

it may have, Your Honor.

However, I

could not answer that.
A recent case has come down.
further interpreted.

The statute has been

It is cited in the state’s supplemental

brief, State v. Yeisaw.

In that case the Oregon Court of

Appeals has recently held that a defendant does not have to
require with the Oregon alibi statute now unless and until
the state supply him with the specific time and place that
the crime was alleged to have been committed.

If the state

fails to do this, either by way of indictment or information
relayed to the defendant's attorney by the district attorney,
the defendant doss not have to comply with the statute.
However, I believe that although that may alleviate
the problem somewhat in Oregon, I do not believe it is going
to solve it. because once the state has given this information
to the defendant, the defendant then is in the same boat that
the petitioner here is in that he must then comply with the
statute.

If he does not comply with it, he is not permitted

to testify nor any of his witnesses permitted to testify.
Q

The omission of any reciprocity provision, is

this an argument on the basis of that?
MR. KUHN %

Yes, Your Honor-„

8

Q

The Court of Appeals refused to reach the

question since there had been no demand for reciprocity by
trial counsel? is that right?
MR. KUHN:

Hot because there was no demand,

although that may have been included in it.

They said

specifically because the state had not offered any rebuttal
testimony in the instant case.
Q

Were you in the Court of Appeals?

MR. KUHN:
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

Did you make the argument on the face of the

statute?
MR. KUHN;
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

I do not quite understand the basis upon

which your Court of Appeals refused to consider it.
MR. KUHN:

Neither do I, Your Honor.

I do not

understand either.
Q

You are telling us you did, in the Court of

Appeals, make the argument on the face of the statute?
MR. KUHN:

Yes, Your Honor, that the statute was

unconstitutional because there was reciprocity on the face of
the statute, unlike the Florida statute in Williams v. Florida.
Q

Mr. Kuhn, do you contend that if reciprocity

is to be accorded by Oregon law it has to be in the same
section of the statute as the one in which this requirement is
imposed on the defendant?

9
MR, KUHN:

Mo, Your Honor, I do not believe it has

to be in the same section.

However, Oregon has no discovery

at all,
Q

But it could be by judicial decision—

MR. KUIIN:
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

—and accord your client the right he claims,

could it not?
MR. KUIIN:
judicial decision.

Yes, Your Honor, it could be by
We have taken one small step towards that

by the reeexit decision in State v, Ke 1 saw.

However, I do not

feel it has gone quite far enough as yet.
As I indicated, as of now the defendant does not
have to comply with the statute if the state gives him
specific time and place of the date the crime was alleged to
have been committed.
Q

That is this Kelsav case?

MR. KUHN:
Q

However, the Oregon law—

Yes, Your Honor.

In the respondent’s supplemental brief filed

today or filed this week?
MR. KUHN:
Q

Yes-, Your Honor.

Is that available,502 Specific 2nd? what is

that, in the advance sheets?
MR. KUIIN:
Q
Q

That is Specific Report.

Right, thank you.
In Oregon, without that statute, do you not

10
have a right fco find that out by a bill of particulars?
MR. KUHN:
Q

No, Your Honor.

You do not have a bill of particulars in

Oregon?
MR. KUHN:

No, we do not.

There are practically no discovery procedures
available in Oregon on the part of the defendant.
Q

Mould not the indictment?

What does that

tell?
MR. KUHN:

The indictment, up until the KgIsaw

decision, gives the date and the county in which the crime
was committed.
Q

And what more not-??

MR. KUHN:

The state now must tell them the specific

time the crime was alleged fco have been committed.
Q

The hour of fcha day?

MR. KUIIN:

Approximately the date.

The date, I

believe, is probably the way it is going fco be construed as
well as the specific place, such as an address.

In this

case, they would probably have alleged or given to the
defendant the specific house number and location of where the
sale is made.
Q

.And then the state will have the burden .of

proving that date and that place?
MR. KUHN:

The law in Oregon is and under KgIsaw

11
remains to be that the state is not bound by the elate alleged
in the indictment and that a defendant, by filing a notice of
alibi or by claiming alibi cannot make time material.
Q

I do not frankly understand what you say is the

small step that the Supreme Court of Oregon has taken in the
direction of discovery.
MR. KUHN:
Q

That is it, Your Honor.

That does net sound to me as if it is anything.

the way you have stated it.
MR. KUHN:

I do not feel that it ales the

defendant or assists in this problem very much at all,
because it is easy for the state to give this information to
the defendant.

The defendant is then right back under the

terms of this statute.
Q

Mr. Kuhn, 1 share this confusion.

Would you

repeat for my benefit precisely what the holding in the
Kelsaw case is now?
MR. KUHN:

The Kelsaw case held that a defendant

in Oregon does not have to comply with the terms of the
Oregon alibi statute if the district attorney supplies to the
defendant the specific time and place where the alleged crime
was committed, and that is the holding.
Q

The defendant has to comply only if, and he

does not have to comply unless, the prosecutor does furnish
that information?

12
MR. KUHN:
Q

Correct, Your Honor.

-t do not follow it, though.

complete reciprocity?

Why is that not

As I understand it, what you are now

telling us is that defendant does not have to provide
anything the statute calls for unless the prosecutor gives
him what the state claims to be time and place of the offense.
MR* KUHN:
Q

Yes, Your Honor, that is correct.

If they give him the time and place of the

offense, what more is he entitled to even if there is an
express reciprocity provision?
MR. KUHN:

Without the reciprocity provision, which

there still would not be under the terms of the Kelsaw
decision—
Q

What more, if there were a reciprocity

provision, would he foe entitled to, the names of the state's
witnesses?
MR. KUHN:

Yes, Your Honor.

Specifically the names

and addresses of the. state’s witnesses.
Q

Anything else?

MR. KUHN:

That is what we believe the Florida

statute indicated was fair.
Q

Since the whole focus of your case is on the

alibi statute and the Kelsaw case now fakes care of
disclosure with respect to that subject, why are these other
matters relevant in the abstract?

MR. KUHN:

Because if

as I read the Kelsaw case,

it. only gives the time and place, is it.

Once the state has

furnished that, we have the alibi statute coining into full
play again where the defendant, should he wish to call a.irbi.--Q

As to name the witness, the state doss not..'.’

MR. KUHN:
q

Yes, Your Honor, correct.

But if Kelsaw went on to say also that the

state must in addition give the names of the state's witnesses
in support of those allegations in the indictment, then what
would your situation be?
MR. KUHN:

Then I would not have a case on the

reciprocity issue.
Q

But only on that issue?

MR. KUHN:

Yes, Your Honor, on the reciprocity

issue.
Petitioner also feels that under the terras of this
Oregon Specific Statute and as interpreted by the Oregon
Court, of Appeals, that he has been

denied due process in

that he has not been allowed to take the stand and testify in
his own behalf because he has failed to give the state the
required notice specifically saying where he was at the time
tha crime was alleged to have been committed.

This is made

a condition precedent to taking the stand and giving' alibi
testimony.
Q

You say that is an unconstitutional condition?

14
MR. KUHN;
Q

X believe that is an unconstitutional—

Under what provision of the Constitution?

MR. KUHN:

—condition.

1 believe that under a

very general due process clause,, Fourteenth Amendment, I
believe that it is a denial of a due process.
I realize that this Court has not held that the
defendant has an unfettered constitutional right to take
the stand and testify in his own behalf.

However, petitioner

believes that this should be a right of a defendant any time
he is charged with crime.
o

Is that completely consistent with williams

against Florida, the argument you are making now?
MR. KUHN:

I believe so, with the theory of it,?

perhaps as to Williams, I believe that Williams, the
defendant, actually as a matter of fact, did testify.
....

Q

Is my recollection faulty about Wi Hi ants

against Florida; is not the defendant exempt from the
requirement-—
MR. KUHN:

Yes, Your Honor, the defendant in

Florida is exempt specifically under the terms of the
Florida statutes and that the failure to file notice under
a Florida statute does not affect his right to take the
stand and give testimony.

Oregon does not have that prevision.

And I believe that this Court in Specht v. Patterson has
indicated that the defendant in a criminal case has a right

to be heard , has a right to be confronted with the witnesses
against him,

right to cross-examine, the right to offer

evidence of his own.

Petitioner believes that the right to

be heard and to offer evidence of his own must necessarily
include the right of the defendant himself to take the stand
so that he may tell his side of the story.

X think that any

time a person is charged with a crime he should have this
right.
And that the Oregon statute unconstitutionally
abridges this right, because if requires the defendant, prior
to trial, to tell the state what his trial testimony is going
to ba as a condition precedent of his getting up on the
stand end testifying.

X believe that this is an unconsti­

tutional abridgment of his right to testify.

Both New York

and Iowa have held that the notice of alibi statutes in
those states do not apply to the defendant's testimony of his,
unlike Oregon.

Petitioner feels that the sanction under the

Oregon alibi statute is simply not justified because the
defendant is denied the right to testify on. a material issue
that goes to the very heart of his case and as in the
determination as to whether or not he is going to be deprived
of his loss of liberty.
X believe that the defendant’s right against selfincrimination is violated by this statute fox" precisely the
same grounds again, in that since the statute does apply to

16

a defendant's testimony and not just witnesses1 testimony,
he must tell the state prior to trial what his alibi
testimony is going to be as a condition precedent to his
talcing the stand and giving that testimony.

And if it

applied only to the witnesses, perhaps there would be no
denial of the right against self-incrimination, as this
Court held in Williams v,. florida.
However, X do. believe that this is a distinguishing
feature of the Oregon statute, in this case, vis-a-vis the
Williams decision in that the defendant in Williams was
specifically excluded from the terms of that statute.
he is not.

Here

He must reveal his testimony prior t.o the time of

trial, whereas the police would have no right to that
testimony under decisions cf this Court unless the defendant
voluntarily wished to waive his right against silence and-Q

Under Oregon procedure, does the giving of

that sort of notice by the defendant commit him in any way to
take -tire stand, or is the statement that he makes there
independently usable by the state if he does not take the
stand?
MR. KUHN:

He does not have to take the stand,

Your Honor, and the issue has not come up.

However, I am

certain under Oregon law this could ba classified^as an
admission and could be introduced into evidence against him.
Q

But you have no law to that effect?

17

MR. KUHN: . There is no law.

The issue has never

arisen, to my knowledge, in Oregon.
We just do not believe that the legislature should
be able to force a defendant to reveal his testimony, alibi
testimony, prior to trial when the police would have no right
to that testimony themselves, unless the defendant
voluntarily wished to waive hiss Fifth Amendment rights.
Finally, petitioner believes that he was denied
his rights to compulsory process in this case under the terms
of this Court’s decision in Washington v. Texas, where the
Court held that the right to compulsory process was, in
plain terms, the right to present a defense and was a
fundamental element of due process of law.

Petitioner

believes that here, because his witness was in court, was
physically able to testify, had knowledge of a material fact
that for the Court to strike the testimony was a denial of
the Sixth Amendment right to compulsory process.
Q

The statute talks about good cause—

MR. KUHN:
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

—excusing it from the requirement.

Are

there many .cases deciding what good cause is?
MR. KUHN:

There has been only one, and that is the

Kelsaw decision—
Q

That is all?

MR. KUHN:

—and they ruled there that there was

18
not good cause.
Q

in this case, of course, they ruled there was

not good cause.
MR * KUHN:

Yes , Your Honor.

However, that was not

an issue as to whether there was good cause shown.

The

issue in the Court of Appeals was the constitutionality of
the statute.
Q

But your state court put it in terms of

whether or not there was good cause.
MR. KUIINs

Yes, Your Honor, the court did indicate

on that basis that there was not good cause.
Q

But except for KeIsaw in this case, there is

no case law on what is or is not good cause?
MR. KUIIN:
cases in Oregon.

No, Your Honor, those are the only two

In State v„ Blake, however, it does not

indicate any—it adds nothing new.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Gillette.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF W. MICHAEL GILLETTE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. GILLETTE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Questions have arisen this morning with respect to
Oregon procedure, and I should like for a moment, if I may,
to attempt to clarify a little further for Justice Brennan
✓
the present status of Oregon law with respect to discovery.

19

First of all, there is no general discovery
statute in Oregon with respect to the rights of criminal
defendants,

And included in that, there is no right to a

bill of particulars as the law now stands.

I believe that

after the legislature has concluded its work at the present
time, there will be one.

But there is not at the moment.

The Kelsaw case represents really the first major
step by any Oregon Court of Appeals, whether the Supreme
Court or the Court of Appeals, to establish any right of
discovery on the part of criminal defendants,

And that case

only goes as far as it does, 1 believe, because that is all it
was called to do in that, particular case.
It establishes the right of ei defendant to refuse
to comply with the alibi statutes unless that defendant is in
possession at the time the compliance is called for—is in
the possession of information supplied by the state which
tells hirn the time, the date in which the crime is alleged
to have occurred, and the place where it is alleged to have
occurred.

And this ruling is made on the basis of a theory of

fundamental fairness to the effect that a defendant cannot
be held responsible for disclosing that he was at place X
until he knows that he is charged with having been at place Y,
The CGurfc of Appeals 'went no further because there
was no need in the Kelsaw case to go any further.
Q

There was disclosed in Kelsaw the names of

20
witnesses?

MR. KUHN:

No , £>.\r ? there was ncca

Hut i Vv-*uid

submit to the Court that in an appropriate case where a
defendant applied at the time he gave the notice-—applied
for an order from the court requiring the stato to ••.L*„sclcn>e
to the defendant the names of any witnesses it proposed to
call in rebuttal to his alibi testimony, their names and
addresses and so on, that he would be granted that, and I
think that would be called for on the basis of this Court s
decision in Williams v. Florida.
The point is

the Oregon courts have not yet had

a chance to deal with this question and when they are given
the chance to deal with this question, 1 believe they will
deal with it in the same way they dealt with the Kelsaw
problem.

They will analyze it.

They will take this

Court's decision in Williams, and they will apply it.

And

one of the points that I want to urge upon the Court this
morning is that state courts in general and the Oregon courts
in particular are capable of taking constitutional decisions
of this Court and applying them to their own statutes—
Q

Has there been any request for a bill of

particulars in any case before the Oregon Supreme Court as of
now?
MR. GILLETTE:
Q

Yes, there has.

And they turned it down?

21
MR. GILLETTE:
Q

Yes, they have.

So, how do we get all these great hopes about

what that court will do?
MR. GILLETTE:

Those cases were decided prior to

Williams, and I am speaking only with respect to what is
going to happen under notice of alibi case.

I am not trying

to suggest that in general defendants are going to be granted
broad discovery powers.
Q

Do you think that Oregon could pass a statute

requiring the defendant to advise the state of what his
defense will be?
MR. GILLETTE:
C

No.

What is the difference between that statute

and this one?
MR. GILLETTE:

The rationale of alibi statutes, as

I understand them and as I believe they are explained in the
Williams case is that the alibi defense is a peculiar kind
of defense.

It offers opportunities for surprise, but a

general defense does not.

And the state has a special

interest in avoiding the kind of surprise that an alibi
defense represents.
Q

\

Assuming that applies to other witnesses, that

does not apply to the defendant, does it?
MR. GILLETTE:

An alibi is just as surprising when

the defendant raises it by himself as when he calls other

22
witnesses to establish it.
Q

What could the state do to counteract it?

MR. GILLETTE;

Call witnesses to show that either

the defendant was somewhere else or call witnesses who were
at the place where the defendant claims to have been to shew
that he was not there.
Q

This is almost unbelievable.

I can understand

why you want to examine the other witnesses, but the
defendant himself I thought had a right to do one o£ three
thing's, not testify, testify, and to take any position he
wants to take at that moment, which could be directly
contrary to the position he wanted to take before the trial.
Am I right or wrong?
MR. GILLETTE:
Q

I think you are right.

But this is one instance where he cannot?

MR. GILLETTE:

No, sir.

No, sir, this statute

does not interfere with the defendant’s ability to take any
position at trial.

There is no authorisation in this

statute—
Q

You mean ha can testify as to an alibi,

defendant can?
MR. GILLETTE:
stand your question.

No, I ara sorry.

Perhaps I misunder~

As I understand what you are saying,

you are suggesting that his disclosure of his intention to
offer evidence of alibi binds him to that defense, and it

23
does not,,
Q

Ho, I did not jay that.

I said that unless

he made it, he could not do it.
MR. GILLETTE:
Q

Yes, sir, that is right.

When he went to trial, he might have said,

“I am not going to take the witness stand," which he has a
right to do.

And during the trial he changes his mind and

says, “I want to take the stand and I want to put my alibi
in."

He is prevented from doing that.
Do you not agree that that interferes with

his right to testify?
MR. GILLETTE:

I do not think it interferes with

his right to testify if, during the time limit provided by
the statute, prior to trial, he was aware and he had informed
his counsel of the fact that he had alibi testimony to offer.
If he kept that information to himself and did not tell his
counsel until the case had actually proceeded and he finallyand this happens, I ant told, by colleagues who are in the
defense business—-if he finally after the trial has proceeded
first turns to his counsel and says, "Look, I will now tell
you what I was doing, I was with a girlfriend somewhere and
I did not want to bring her name up but the case is going
badly .and I have obviously got to,"-if that occurred, I think
that would constitute good cause for the waiver of the
alibi notice.

24
Q

But there is no law to that effect?

MR. GILLETTEs

No, there is not, not one way or the

other at this point.
Q

Are you dealing with a constitutionally

protected right to testify or not testify?
MR. GILLETTE:

If you are saying ‘

with an absolute right to testify,
Court has said that.

then I do not think this

I think that is the issue before

Is the right absolute or can it be qualified by

a reasonable requirement of disclosure.
Q

You do not believe that the defendant has an

absolute right to testify to save his neck?

Q

X think that you would not be here arguing if

you agreed, that there was an absolute right to testify.
MR. GILLETTE:
Q

That is right, we would not.

Did not the Williams holding settle some of

these questions, Mr. Gillette?
MR. GILLETTE:

I think the Williams holding

settled the question of whether ox- not the notice of alibi is
constitutional.
Q

I thought that was settled.
As against a Fifth Amendment claim.

MR. GILLETTE:

MR. GILLETTE:

Neither the. issue as to the

defendant himself nor the issue of the exclusion of the
testimony was before the Court at that time.
Q

This settled whether or not giving notice of

the alibi violated the defendant's Fifth Amendment right
against self-incrimination.
MR. GILLETTE:

That is the way I understood the

case, yes, sir.
Q

7. would like to make one more point with

respect to Oregon procedure, if I can return to that for
the moment.

A question arose from one of the justices, I

believe it was Mr. Justice Rehnquist, with respect to
rebuttal testimony.

Perhaps I have already finished that,

statement, but the question of whether or not the defendant
is entitled to that information, information which the
Florida statute called for with respect to the names,
addresses, nature of the testimony from the rebuttal witness©
the question of whether the defendant is entitled to that is
not settled, but it seems to me that the conclusion the
Oregon courts would have to reach is pretty well dictated by
the language of Williams.

And I would have thought that at

the very least it would be of value for the Oregon courts

26
to be given an opportunity to settle that question on their
own, based upon an appropriate motion by the defense.

Q

Do you, agree with your brother that the

question of the constitutionality of the statute on its face
was raised before your Court of Appeals?
MR. GILLETTE:

No, sir, I really do not.

I feel

the entire, contort of that argument which Mr. Kuhn and I made
was the question whether the statute was constitutional as
applied in that case,,and there was no real issue of
unconstitutionality on the face of the statute.
Q

Then do you suggest that question is not

before us in consequence?
MR. GILLETTE:

I really do not think it is.

I

really think the Court is faced here with the question of
whether the statute is constitutional as applied.
Q

Could you just tell me what the state3s

interest is in having this alibi statute?
MR. GILLETTE:

Yes.

It is the same interest that

is referred to in the Williams case.

The alibi defense is

one which involves—usually involves—surprise to the state,
because it develops the testimony in an entirely new line.
The testimony for the prosecution gees to whether the
defendant was at a certain place, where he performed certain
acts-.

The alibi testimony gives a right turn to the entire

proceeding.

It is surprising by definition.

And the

27
interest that is referred to in Williams is the interest of
full and fair disclosure of all the issues which go to the
guilt or innocence of the accused.
Q

What interest of Florida is lost if at the

time an alibi witness is offered that has not previously bean
disclosed, the trial is adjourned so that the state may
accomplish its aims of investigation and avoidance of
surprise and of fraud and perjury?
MR. GILLETTE:

1 think the concern there shifts.

The concern then becomes concluding the business of that
particular trial, particularly in jurisdictions with crowded
dockets, without being faced an arbitrary and really a
surprising delay due to the fact that the defendant did not
make a disclosure at

a

time when he was aware that he could

have made it.
Let rna put it this way.

Let us suppose that a

matter is being tried before a jury.

This case was not.

But L think it is fair to say that whatever the Court decides
today, it will apply to both trials to juries and trials to
the court.
If a case is being tried to a jury end the jury
spent about two weeks hearing testimony in a relatively
complicated criminal matter, and the defense, for the first
time at the end of those two weeks discloses that they intend
to offer evidence of alibi, and they make available the names

28
of four or five witnesses and the state is then granted a
continuance,

you are asking a jury which could be used under

other circumstances to hear other cases—and the panel
frequently is .limited in jurisdictions, such as the one I
come from in Portland—you are asking that jury to sit on
its hands until the state has concluded its investigation.
They cannot be assigned to any other case, because they may
not be available to reconvene the trial.
the judge be made available.

You are asking that

You are asking that those

things occur, those delays occur, which could have bean
avoided by supplying the information ahead of time.

You are

asking that the judicial system, the system of trying to
take care of crowded dockets, be interrupted for that
period of time.
It is easier with a judge than with a jury.

It is

much more complicated with a jury, because they ought to be
available to do other things.
Q

What do you suppose a state will do if we

disagree with you and sustain the position of your colleague?
I suppose there will be adjournments, will there not?
MR. GILLETTE:

Yes, sir, they will do what they

are told.
Q

There will be adjournments.

Nobody would tell

them to adjourn;if they did not want to avoid surprise, they
do not need to avoid surprise.

But do you suppose they

29
would actually start adjourning trials?
MR. GILLETTE;

Yes, 7 think that is what, would he

done.
Q

How long as a practical matter can you adjourn

a criminal trial?
MR. GILLETTE:

The Ellsberg case on which this

Court heard preliminary hearings adjourned a long time,
Q

They had to pick a new jury then.

MR. GILLETTE:
Q

That is true.

They had to.

They tried it and it did not work.

MR. GILLETTE:

I can only suggest to the Court,

based upon my own limited experience, that it is impractical
to adjourn matters like that for any extended length of time.
Q

Like what, ten days?

MR. GILLETTE:
the period of fime.

I think it is impossible to identify

I think ten days is too long, but I have

no idea what the period of time would be.
Q

When does the defendant have to give notice of

alibi under the—
MR. GILLETTE:
Q

Five days prior to trial.

That is all the state really needs, is five

days?
MR. GILLETTE:

That is what the statute apparently

theorises.
Q

They would not need any more than that during

30
trial would they?
MR. GILLETTE:

No, unless they find witnesses they

have to give notice to the defendant to, in which case I
assume he is entitled to longer.
0

In Oregon, do you know, is it customary to

adjourn a criminal trial more than 24 to 48 hours?
MR. GILLETTE:
Q

Ho, it is not.

Of course, most states do not have an alibi

statute.
MR. GILLETTE:
Q

Sixteen states have them.

Thirty-four get along without it and take their

risk on adjournment.
MR. GILLETTE:
0
statute.

Yes, sir.

Sixteen states have some kind of an alibi

How many prevent the defendant himself from

testifying without prior notice?
MR. GILLETTE:

I am not sure of the exact number.

I think five or six.
Q

Most of them, or at least soma of them, a

large percentage of them, only prevent third party witnesses
from testifying? is that correct?
MR. GILLETTE:

That is right.

Sorae of them have a

specific exemption with respect to the defendant.
Q

Himself.

MR. GILLETTE s

Some of them do not provide for

31
exclusion in any case,
Q

What sanction do they impose?

MR, GILLETTE;

Sometimes a continuance»

In fact,

I think a continuance is usually the sanction imposed,

The

statutes are a classic example of various states experimenting
with procedure,

And, in fact, the Oregon statute, as I

recall, is the most recent of the statutes,
Q

When was this one enacted?

MR, GILLETTE;

It was enacted in 1969.

It makes

it far more recent than the majority of them, which were
enacted during the thirties.
Q

Did you have anything akin to this before 1969?

MR, GILLETTE:
Q

Nothing.

MR. GILLETTE:
Q

Mo, we did not.

No.

Mr. Gillette, I go back again to this question

of whether the constitutionality of the statute or* its face
is before us.

What is the argument procedure by which you

raise a question in the appellate court?

Is this by a point

raised in the brief, or do you have some assignment of errors
or something?
MR. GILLETTE;

Oregon law- requires that the issue

of the constitutionality of the statute, either on its face
or as applied, be raised in the trial court and that a
record be made of that.

And it becomes one of the designated

32
matters on appeal.
Q

And are. you

raised in trial court on its face when it is applied?
MR. GILLETTE:

The manner in which this whole

question came up is set out at length in the appendix, ana
I think it is of some significance.

What occurred was, this

trial happened about two or three months after this Court's
decision in Williams v„ Florida, and I think it is evident
from the transcript, if you examined it, in the appendix that
the trial court was aware neither of the alibi statute nor
of this Court's decision in Williams, so that both of those
things carae as a surprise to the trial court.
On the other hand, the defendant was aware of both
of them because, as the transcript shot-;s, the defense counsel
gave a copy of the Williams decision to the prosecutor
during a noon recess and he carae in in the afternoon and pro­
ceeded to put on his alibi testimony, which was really the
only testimony offered by the defense.

And the first time

that the court was aware there was an alibi statute or that
there was a problem with an alibi statute was when the
prosecution entered an objection.
So, what occurred after that is not particularly
clear.

The defendant 'was given an opportunity to make a

showing of good cause why the requirements of the statute
should be waived, and his offering was to the effect that at

33
first he thought that the date on the indictment was wrong
and he was prepared to offer alibi witnesses on a different
date»

But, of course, he had not offered notice of those

either»

And than secondly he also said that he was not aware

of the name of his alibi witness, and again the transcript
shows that even if he was not aware of it, his defendant was.
He dated the girl for a number of years.

So, neither of those

showings was particularly clear.
q

1 think you told me earlier your Court of

Appeals did determine a question of the constitutionality of
the statute as applied; is that not right?
MR. GILLETTE :

It is difficult for rae to ascribe

any particular posture to that opinion, quite frankly.
Q

You mean you cannot say whether the Court of

Appeals decided any constitutional question addressed to the
statute?
MR. GILLETTEs

They decided that with respect to

the Fifth Amendment issue, with respect to whether
requiring disclosure was constitutional, that that was
proper under this Court's decision in Williams.
Q

But the trial court did consider the

constitutional points and did consider Williams, right?
MR. GILLETTE;
Q
it on page 15?

It had Williams before it, yes.

Did it not consider it and did it not write on
And he says he admits that the defendant

34
raised the point that it denies him the effective benefit of
his right to compulsory process to obtain witnesses in his
own behalf, abridges his right to testify,

And then in the

next paragraph he said,. ”We will consider these contentious
in order."

And the first line is Williams against Florida.

How do von

interpret that?
MR. GILLETTE:
Q

Is that a Court of Appeals?

MR. GILLETTE:
Q

That is a Court of Appeals decision.

Yes, sir.

So, they did consider it, did they not?

MR. GILLETTE:

They considered the Fifth Amendment

issue, yes, but with respect to the other issues we are
talking about, this is the point X am trying to make, they
were not even clearly raised in the trial court.

The issue,

for instance, ’with respect to the sanction to be imposed,
is really not raised in the trial court.

There is no

discussion—
Q

Your position is that he was banking on the

point that this change in date excused him from complying
with the statute, and that was his only complaint; is that
what you are saying?
MR. GILLETTE:
in that transcript.

Ho, because he says one other thing

He says essentially the statute is not

constitutional because of Williams v. Florida„

He simply

offered the court the decision that here is the statute and

35
you can lay one beside the other and that is the end of it,
and I suppose in that sense you could say that the issue of
the constitutionality of the statute on its face was more
properly raised before the trial court than on appeal,
Q

He was really trying to gat under the good

cause point,
MR. GILLETTE:

No, I do not think so.

trying to get out. of complying with the statute,

He was
never mind

what the reason was, whether ha had good causa or not.

He

was just saying the statute was inapplicable, period.
Q

Inapplicable or unconstitutional?

MR. GILLETTE:
Q

Unconstitutional.

I misspoke.

Right.

The state at least is not here telling us there

is not any constitutional question before us?
MR. GILLETTE:
Q

No, sir; no, sir.

What would you suppose the interest of the

defendant would be in not notifying of an alibi if he was
reasonably confident that if he did not notify and neverthe­
less offered alibi witnesses during the trial, the trial
would be adjourned?

If he anticipated an adjournment, if he

offered unannounced witnesses, what would be his interest in
not notifying before trial?
MR. GILLETTE:

I think the adjournment procedure

makes available to a defendant at the close of a state's
case a period of time in which he can figure out what to do.

If he serves a notice of alibi by which he is not bound, he
simply gets himself a five-day recess or whatever the period
of time is, in which he can sit down, perhaps even .get full
transcripts of all the testimony and go over all the
testimony and plan what it is he is going to do.

It is a

kind of built-in five-day delay in the trial process.
Q

If he plans to offer alibi.

MR. GILLETTE:

But he does not have to.

He can

conclude after the five-day recess that he chooses not to
offer tlie alibi testimony.

He is not bound by that in any

sense.
Q

X know, but if he gave notice ahead of time

before trial, in compliance with the statute, there would not
be any adjournraent during the trial?
MR. GILLETTE:
Q

No, there would not.

But if he does not give notice, he is going

to have to offer some alibi witnesses then before there is
going to be any adjournment.

He is going to have to decide

to offer soma alibi witnesses, and when he offers them, then
the state would ask for an adjournment.

Let us assume that

the defendant knew that if the state requested an adjournment
it would be granted.

What interest would he have in not

complying with the statute?
MR. GILLETTE:

X think the answer is the same.

fact that he has called a witness—-and, in fact, I do not

The

37
think he would have to do that.

I think he would simply have

to advise the Court, '"At this time we wish to serve notice of
alibi.”

I do not think the sterile process of calling the

witness and asking the first question and receiving the
objection and having the jury sent out
notice—
Q

He is not just going to have to give notice.

He is going to have to say who his witnesses are.
MR. GILLETTE*.
Q

And name the witnesses.

MR. GILLETTE:
q

That is right.

That is right.

Under Oregon law could the

prosecutor properly

argue the belated disclosure of alibi?
MR. GILLETTE:
Q

Yes.

MR. GILLETTE:
Q

To the jury?

Oh, I think not.

And do you 'think that would be precluded by

Oregon law or by some provision of the
MR. GILLETTE:
Oregon law.

I think not.

Federal Constitution?

I think it would be precluded by

The courts in Oregon, of course, have been

rather severe about comments to the jury ort anything that is
not directly in evidence, and that would constitute testifying
if the matter is not in evidence.
Q

It is something the jury—“they do see the alibi

witness ultimately.

And your point is that it would be

38
testimonial to develop the fact that that -fas a late tactic.
MR. GILLETTEs
Q

Yes, I think so.'

Then I take :• t too that if the prosecutor got

up and objected on the grounds that it was a belated tender
that he would be in the same trouble.
MR. GILLETTE:
difficulty.

He would be running the same

I think it might well serve as grounds for

mistrial at that point, if he did it in the presence of the
jury.
Q

If I may, Your Honor, I would like to finally

refer to the question of compulsory process which counsel
has referred to when he specifically cited fcho Washington
?. Texas case, and I would submit that the difference between
this case and the difference between the problem posed by
this case and the line of cases represented by Washington v.
Texas, Pointer v, Tessas, Ferguson v. Georgia,, and the like,
is that in those cases witnesses were incompetent, period.
The statute made them unavailable to the defendant no matter
what he did.

He simply could not qualify them as witnesses.

Washington, you may recall, involved a situation where a
defendant could not call an accomplice to testify, a co­
principal, to testify at all.

He was deemed incompetent by

a Texas statute,
In this case, the only step that the defendant needs
to take to make the witness competent is to serve -the notice.

39
The power to make the witness competent lies within his own
hands, and 1 would submit that that makes this statute, as
applied, significantly different than the entire line of
cases represented by Washington, v. Texas.
Unless the Court has further questions, that
concludes my remarks.

Thank you, Your Honor.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGEE;

Thank you, Mr. Gillette.

do you have anything further, Mr. Kuhn'?
MR. KUHN:
Q

No, Your Honor.

Could I ask you, Mr. Kuhn—

MR. KUHN:

Yes, Your Honor.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF J. MARVIN KUHN, ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
Q

You are representing a defendant?

MR. KUHN:
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

Do you know ahead of trial that if you offer

a surprise alibi witness, the state is going to have an
opportunity to investigate the named witnesses'?
MR. KUHN;
Q

Yes, that is correct.

And you know that that is going to happen if

you do not comply with the statute and rather than comply
offer the witness unannounced.

What would bo your choice,

to comply with the statute or to wait?
MR. KUHN;

I think that I would probably tell the

district attorney that I was going to have an alibi.

40
Q

And why would you do that?

You do not see

any particular advantage in waiting than if you are going to
have to be subject to an adjournment anyway?
MR. KUHN:

No, Your Honor.

However, whether there

would be an adjournment or not, a lot of that depends.
Q

X know, but assume there would be.

MR. KUHN:

If there would foe—although 1 would

probably offer no more than the fact there would be an
alibi defense and not comply with the remaining terms of the
statute, assuiaing we had this statute.
Q

Oh, you would not give the names of the

witnesses?
MR. KUHN:
Q

No, Your Honor.

But you would have to call them sooner or

later if you were going to call them?
MR. KUHN:
0

Yes.

And as soon as you call them the state would

ask for and would get an adjournment?
MR. KUHN:

Yes.

In that case I would see no reason

not to give the names and addresses of the witnesses.
Q

Ahead of time?

MR. KUHN:

If I could obtain an agreement to get
