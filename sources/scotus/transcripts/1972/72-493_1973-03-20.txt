ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. HILL, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. IIILLs

Thank you, Your Honor.

Mr« Chief Justice, may it please the Courts
The named appellant in this case is John Viandis,
who is the Director of Admissions at the University of
Connecticut.
The appellees were both students at the time of the
bringing of this action, and what they seek to question is
the constitutionality of a Connecticut general statute setting
an out-of-State differential in tuition for students, and
they particularly single-in on a line of the statute which
states that once the out-of-State status has been determined,
the student shall maintain the status for the balance of his
or her attendance at the institution of higher education.
I would point out that although the word "permanent"
is used throughout ihe briefs, and in the record below, the
statute is not permanent in the complete sense, in that a
student originally out-of-State may still come in to Connecticut
before applying for admission? and at that time
state status

.gain in­

4
So I think what we've really got here is something
more than permanent, I think what is really being argued is a
durational test for tuition differentials.

Now, this is the

point that is specifically brought up on the amicus briefs
that were filed by the University of Washington and also by the
Civil Liberties Union of Ohio.
I think that is the real question that is here
before the Court# namely, what durational test can a State
place in making this discrimination as to in-State or out-ofState?
It's a question of considerable importance.

One

analyst estimates that some 300 to 400 million dollars may be
at stake for State-supported institutions of higher education.
I think my particular problem, that I have to
persuade the Court as to, is whether or not the Court's
decision in Dunn v, Blumstein should be expanded to cover an
out-of-State tuition situation rather than voting rights.
And it's this I'm going to address myself to, because I think
this is the particular question that I have to meet.
QUESTIONS

Well, in Dunn v, Blumstein, if he's there

over the period of time, he's then eligible to vote.
MR. HILLs That is correct, Your Honor.

This is

according to —
QUESTION:

But here, if he — how long can you stay

in college in Connecticut?

Does it run up to a Ph„D0?

5

MR. HILL:

Yes, Your Honor.

Yes.

A Ph.D. is

QUESTION:

So if a person enrolls in the university

offered.

and the next day becomes a citizen and the next year votes,
he's still a non-resident for seven years, so far as the
university is concerned; isn't that correct?
MR. HILL: Well, Your Honor, that isn't the way it's
been interpreted.

Actually it's been interpreted that there

could be a break after the award of a degree.
principle is correct, Your Honor.

But your

That once he is established,

say, he comes to the University of Connecticut, he's a
freshman, if he's classified out-of-State to begin with,
he's going to remain out-of-State«
QUESTION: And if he gets elected Mayor of the town
of New Haven, he's still a nonresident?
MR. HILL: That is correct, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Then, how in the world do you justify

MR. HILL:

Your Honor, I justify it on this basis:

that?

Dunn v. Blumstein set up a formula that applied to voting
rights, it was almost a mechanistic formula, it said:

any

durational resident's requirement triggered this consuming
State interest standard.

A standard which — I have to agree

with the Chief Justice's words in that case — is almost an
insurmountable obstacle for the State to meet.

6

But I think it's fair for the State — for this
Court to limit the judgment in Dunn v, Blumstein to a voting
situation or, as it did in Shapiro, to a welfare situation.
I think we're talking about something different when we're
talking about a tuition differential.
We're not trying to say in this case that the
person cannot establish residency for voting purposes.

We're

not saying he can't establish it for purposes of receiving
welfare, as Shapiro was based.

What we are saying is that

the Court ought to look to the nature of the right that is
affected.
In this case it's the right to receive a subsidised
education on the part of the State.
QUESTION? Well, you've just told us what you're not
saying, and that's helpful; but, on the other hand, unless
I'm mistaken, your brothers on the other side are not saying,
either, that a State university may not charge a differential,
a higher tuition of nonresidents than it does of residents.
It's attacking only the definition.
MR. HILLs
that, Your Honor.

Isn't that fair?

Well, I think it's a little more than
I think what they're saying is that the

State can't classify them for that four-year period.

And I'm

saying that really what we've got here is a durational
requirement; because the person can establish residency, as
long as they're not attending the institution.

7
QUESTION? Well, a nonmarried student would have
to live for a solid year in Connecticut before applying, —
MR» HILLs

That is correct, Your Honor»

QUESTION?

— as I understand your definitions?

and a married student would have to be in Connecticut at the
time he or she applied»
MR0 HILL:

That’s correct» And I don’t think that

presents any particular hardship.
QUESTION:

What that means —

Well, that’s your argument, I know.

But

just so that I can understand the issue, because it's not
all that clear to me, I had thought that your opponents did
not say, did not question the right of the Connecticut State
Universities to charge a higher tuition of bona fide non­
residents than they do of residents.
MR. HILL: They do not.
QUESTION: But they do attack the presumption that
once a nonresident always a nonresident.
MR, HILLs

They do.

QUESTION:

And the inability of anybody to prove he

actually is a bona fide resident of Connecticut, —
MR, HILLs That’s right, sir.
QUESTION:

— at some stage in the game,

MR. HILL:

They claim that they should have the

opportunity to show changed circumstances„
QUESTION:

Yes

MR. HILL;

And what I am arguing is that under the

rational basis test this, what amounts to a one-year waiting
period, is a rational approach for the State to take to help
finance the system of higher education.

Because we’re not

talking about even the out-of-State person deferring the entire
cost of his education, this is still heavily subsidized by the
State? and I think this is true in every State.
But what I am arguing is that this is a reasonable
judgment for the Legislature to make, this is a reasonable
way to approach the problem.

And I think it’s the same

principle that —
QUESTION s

How is it conceivable to say that the

Mayor of New Haven is not a resident?
MR. HILL:

He’s not a resident for tuition

purposes, Mr. Justice.

We're not saying that he’s not a

resident, that he can’t have all the other privileges of
citizenship.
QUESTION: Well, assume that my hypothetical Mayor
of New Haven is also a multimillionaire and is paying his
taxes regularly,
MR. HILL: Well, I think the argument there, Mr.
Chief Justice, -*• Mr, Justice, is that —
QUESTION:

Well, you say this is rational? I want

to see how rational it is,
MR, HILL:

All right.

If ~

9

QUESTION:

How can it be rational that a man can

never change his resident status?

What’s rational about that?

MR. HILL: What's rational is that the State is
seeking to support higher education, and it in effect divides
the students into two classes:

out-of-State and in-State

and it does say —
QUESTION:

I respectfully disagree.

It draws a

line between people who are outside of the State and people
who are inside of the State.

I'm talking about the one who

becomes a resident the day after he is — matriculates.
MR, HILL:

Yes, sir, that is correct.

And if that

person wants —
QUESTION:

Do you discriminate between the person

who has matriculated as resident for one day — is that right?
MR. HILL?

That — well, of course, you're taking

the example —
QUESTION:

Against those who have been a resident

for a year.
MR, HILL: That is correct,
QUESTION: And what rationalization is there for that?
MR, HILL:
line.

Because the Legislature wanted to draw a

The line it chose to draw was this one-year residence

duration,
Now, this is not as —
QUESTION:

Well, could that be rational for one

10

year’s tuition or rational for seven years’ tuition?
MR. HILL;

My point is, Your Honor, any time this

person wants to — any time your

Mayor of New Haven wants to

establish residency for tuition purposes, all he has to do is
withdraw from the university, and that indicates that he is
not in the State purely for purposes of getting State education
he then puts in his year, while he's not a student, and than
he can qualify and have all the privileges of education that
the State offers.
This is a way to make a differentiation between
people who are out-of-*State and in-State .
QUESTION;

But your rationalization after the year,

whether he's in the State or out of the State, is not a
rationalization that I can understand»
MR. HILL; Well, let me try it a different way,
QUESTION;

I can understand that for the one year,

he's a nonresident student for that one year.
MR. HILL; Well, the presumption — what the statute
really operates on, if I can read the legislative intent
correctly, is that there is a presumption that the person
who comes in to the State and attends an institution of
higher education is here not to become a bona fide resident
of the State, but to secure the advantages of public education.
QUESTION;

Don't you think the State of Connecticut

thinks that that's such a wonderful State, everybody will want

11
to stay there?
MR. HILLs Well, Your Honor, I would hope they would
think that.

But I think — what I'm arguing here is what I

think was the intent of the Legislature in passing this Act.
And I think that was the design of it.
Not to necessarily discourage people from coming in,
but saying they will not be subsidized.

Recently arrived

students — this is the important thing — recently arrived
students will not receive the same subsidy as those who have
been in the State for a longer period of time.
QUESTION;

And —

I think a really constitutional analysis

of this might be promoted if we forget about residents and
nonresidents and just — the question is, whether or not the
State can create the categories that you've just described;
that a person, when he applies and is admitted to a State
university in Connecticut, is a nonresident, can Connecticut
say that no matter whether or not he later becomes a bona fide
resident for every other purpose, nonetheless for this purpose
we categorize him as a person who has to pay a higher
tuition,
MR. HILLs That is the issue, Your Honor,
QUESTIONS

That's really it, isn't it?

MR. HILLs

Yes, Your Honor, that is the issue.

QUESTION;

I think maybe when we talk about residents

for other purposes, we cloud the analysis a little bit.

12
MR. HILL:

Very well. Then I won't talk about

residents for other purposes.
QUESTION: Well, I’m just suggesting that, and for
me, at least, it helps.
MR. HILL: All right, then I will zone-in on the
particular question that we have here, and that is for
educational purposes only.
This statute does not affect any other rights of
citizenship, it does not affect voting, it does not affect the
welfare? it is tied into a modest differential in tuition for
out-of-State students.

And this is the argument that I would

make today, that State-supported education does not fall in
the same category.
I think there has been a whole line of cases, that
I’ve cited in my brief, that recognizes this.
And I would urge that the Court, in analyzing this
factual situation, judge it by the rational basis test.

And

I think this is an example — there are a whole number of
statutes across the country on this basis? amicus brief is
one of them, from the State of Washington.
It allows each State to meet its own educational
situation in its own way.

It lets each State be free to

experiment with this type of statute.

Many of them say you

can’t because —■ that once an out-of-State always an out-ofState, as long as you are taking less than, say, six or nine —

13

more than six or nine credits at the institution.
Again, it’s an attempt to differentiate between those
who are coming in for educational purposes and those who are
really exercising their right to travel.

And it is admittedly

an imperfect method of discrimination in the statute. Almost
any type of classification has its imperfections.
I would argue that this statute is not so imperfect
as to fail to satisfy the rational basis test.

I have cited

in the brief the expenses of education, the number of out-ofState students that are in Connecticut, the effect that this
will have on the burgeoning State budget in education.

And I

would urge the Court to consider it in that context, because
that's really the context we're talking abouts

How are the

States going to finance their systems of higher education?
I would submit that the method adopted by
Connecticut, which in effect is a year's durational require­
ment, is a reasonable approach to that very serious problem.
QUESTION:

How much —• do you have any idea how

much of the cost of education in Connecticut public institu­
tions of higher learning is financed by the Federal
Government?
MR. HILL:

No, I don’t, Your Honor.

I know it has

QUESTION:

Ten percent, twenty percent?

MR. HILL:

It varies.

a —

At the University of

14
Connecticut it would be higher.
QUESTION;
MR. HILL;

Be twenty-five percent?
It could well be twenty-five percent.

That is correct.
QUESTION: Well, what about the justification of
foreclosing the Federal subsidy to out-of-Staters?

I mean

you are —
They would have the benefit of that

MR. HILL:

subsidy at the institution —* at where they qualify.
QUESTION s

Yes, but they're paying more for it.

MR. HILL:

I'm afraid I don't understand your

question, Mr. Justice.
QUESTIONS

Well, let's assume that all of the

subsidy that you say is — just assume that all of the subsidy
you say students get at the University of Connecticut were
furnished by the Federal Government? assume that it all was.
MR. HILL:

That it all was?

Oh, then I’d have a

very difficult argument.
QUESTION:

You certainly would, wouldn't you?

MR. HILL:

But that is not the case.

QUESTION: Well, let's assume half of it is.
MR. HILL:

I think I have figures here in my brief,

where I cite that even the out-of-State student is subsidized
more than half of the cost of his education, even though the
government —

15
QUESTION:

Yes, that's what I thought»

Half of that

half is perhaps government money?
MR» HILL:

Some of it may well be Federal Government

money in the form of all sorts of grants; that is correct»
But —
QUESTION:

Mr* Hill, didn't I understand one of

your, or what I thought your response to Justice White's
first question to be that, say, if a student from Colorado
goes to Connecticut, the Connecticut rule may deny him the
benefit of the federally subsidized Connecticut education,
but presumably the State education in Colorado is also
subsidized by the Federal Government, so that he would be
entitled to -MR. HILL:

Really that was the answer — yes, that

was the answer I was trying to make.

I don't mean to be

facetious, but everybody has to be somewhere, and if the
student — as in this case, Mrs. Kline made her application,
she had a choice at that time whether she could be a resident
of either Arizona or California or Connecticut.
Now, if she chose to go to Connecticut, I say she
gets that out-of-State status.

But she could have moved into

Connecticut and applied, because she was married and she
would not be faced with this present situation.
This means the student himself has to make a choice
before his application of what institution he's going to

16

attend»

If he's going to attend Colorado and he wants

in-State status, — and Colorado's is fairly similar to ours
-- he would have to move to Colorado, establish that status,
and then he would receive the benefits of it.

If he lived

in Colorado to begin with and he wanted to go to Connecticut,
he would have to pay the differential»
It means the student at the time of his application
has status in one particular State and is unable to change it»
Except by moving.

The mere fact of admission and signing up

to vote in the new State would not do it.
QUESTIONs

Suppose the student went to Connecticut

and enrolled in a private college, attended that college for
one year, maintaining his residence there, of course, then he'd
meet the eligibility standard of the Connecticut statute to
move to a State university the next year.
MR. HILL:

He certainly would, Mr. Chief Justice.

That's exactly my point.

This is not an absolute bar to a

person that's obtaining in-State status.

It's a durational

type thing, it's an effort by the State to make a reasonable
classification between in- and out-of-State.
QUESTION:

Well, in that hypothetical case, then

the person might or might not»

If he were the son of parents

living in Chicago, who were paying all his expenses, and if
he were driving a car with Chicago license plates, and went
back for every vacation and spent the summers back home in

17
Illinois, he wouldn't have become a resident.
MR. HILL %

Of course not, and he shouldn't.

QUESTION: Well, isn't that more or less a typical
student, at least -MR. IIILLs

Oh, I don't think so today, Your Honor.

I think more often you would find —
QUESTION: Well, most of them have living parents,
and who go home for vacations, and who retain their ~
MR. HILL: Well, a good number of them don't, Mr.
Justice.
QUESTION: Well, maybe a number of them don't, but
isn't it therefore a question of fact in each case, whether
a person has actually become a resident of the place where
he's going to college?
MR. HILL:

Under the example that the Chief Justice

gave, that would be a question of fact.

If this were a

student who, say, went to Trinity College in Hartford, and
spent every summer and every vacation ~
QUESTION: And went home for Christmas.
MR. HILL:
QUESTION:

Right.

— he would not have —

And that home was, say, back in Chicago,

he wouldn't be a resident of Connecticut.
MR. HILL:

Right.

He would not have established

the bona fides necessary? that's correct,
QUESTION:

Your response to my hypothetical, then,

13
included the proposition that in attending Yale or some other
private school in Connecticut, he had also taken all the other
steps to establish legal residence —
MR. IIILL;

Yes, sir; that's correct, Mr. Chief

QUESTION;

—• and then probably, I suppose it would

Justice.

be fair to say that most of the students who come to a
university like Yale do not establish a residence for other
purposes.
MR. HILL;

Most of the undergraduates do not.

of the graduate students do, interestingly enough.

Most

Most of

them do establish a year-round residence and many of them that
come to Connecticut come to establish a residence ahead of
time, so that they can have the benefit of this in-State
tuition.
But you're — as far as undergraduates go, that is
correct, most do not, most go home for the summer.
In conclusion, I would only urge the Court to
consider that the fundamental legal proposition behind this,
that this really I think is a case for a rational basis
approach, rather than the compelling State interest.

I am

willing to acknowledge again that the compelling State
interest gives me an obstacle which I don't think can be over­
come.
On the rational basis —*

19

QUESTION;

Has it ever been overcome on that basis,

that you know of, or —MR, HILL;

Not to my knowledge, Mr. Justice.

QUESTION; — where the court begins by saying that
we must find a compelling State interest, has the State ever
won a case?
MR, HILL;

Not that I know of, and that's why I

didn't pursue that argument, I wouldn't take up the Court's
time with it.
Thank you,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, Mr, Hill,

Mr. Dziamba.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN A. DZIAMBA, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR, DZIAMBA;

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I'd like to begin by responding to Mr, Justice
Stewart’s question and the Chief Justice's hypothetical as
to the student going to Yale.

Under Mr. Hill's answer, he

said the student would not qualify under the present
Connecticut statute unless he cloaked himself with other
indicia of bona fide residence.

However, I don't think that

that’s an accurate response, because under the present
statute there is nothing he would have to do.

He would not

have to cloak himself with any indicia of residence: he would

just merely have to show that he lived in Connecticut for one
year before he applied to a State university.

He would be

accepted, and he would be accepted as an in-State studento
QUESTION;
legal address.

Well, the statute talks in terms of

Legal address.

Now, that doesn't say domicile or residence.
MR. DZIAMBAs
QUESTION;

Well, I think —

Maybe the student's legal address was at

some number in Yale station, and maybe it was on some street
out in Chicago, Illinois —
MR. DZIAMBA;

Yes, but there would not, under the

statute, Mr. Justice Stewart, there would not be a factual
inquiry.

The student would assert his legal address as being

Eox 22 at Yale or Trinity, or even if he were living in an
apartment as Chapel Street in New Haven? that would be accepted,
there would be no individual examination of other than —
QUESTION;

But the test is legal address, whatever

that may mean.
MR. DZIAMBA;

Whatever that may mean.

And I assume

that iinder the statute whatever is asserted would be accepted.
The troubling part about this case is that — I'd
like to put it into perspective.

First of all, that we're not

dealing with college students as college students? we're
dealing with individuals who happen to be in the particular
stage in their life afflicted with the status of being college

21

students.
What I'm trying to say is that I don't think that
this Court need evolve any particular and unique constitutional
test for the bona fide of residence of individuals just
because they happen to be students? that rational criteria
exist and are easily applied in any factual situation to
establish the bona fidea of residency.
For instance, —
QUESTION?

But Connecticut says, We're not

interested in the test —- in the ordinary conventional,
traditional legal test of domicile or residence? instead of
that we're going to make different categories.

Whether or

not a person later becomes a resident, we don't care.

We're

just going to say we're not dealing with individuals, we're
dealing with many large groups, and for administrative
convenience we're just going to say that a person who, when
he applies to our State university, applies from outside of
Connecticut, we're going to charge a higher tuition to that
person so long as he attends our State university, whether or
not he ever becomes a resident or doesn't,
MR. DZIAMBA:
QUESTION?

I don't think —

Now, that's the question in this case:

whether Connecticut can do that.
MR. DZIAMBA:
QUESTION:

I think that —

Quite apart from any normal, traditional

22

concepts of common-law residence or domicile.
MR. DZIAMBA: Well ~
QUESTION;

Isn't that the question?

MR. DZIAMBAs
QUESTION:

No, I really don't think so? Mr. —

Well, why not?

MR. DZIAMBAs

— Justice Stewart.

QUESTIONS Reading the statute, that's what it says.
MR. DZIAMBA:

Because in the proper justifications

by the State for adopting that statute they cite two reasons;
they say the statute has to be this way because it gives us
an administratively easy way of establishing the student's
domiciliary intent.

That's why they say they have to have it.

Secondly, they say that it allows cost equalization
between those people who are contributing to the tax basis
of the State of Connecticut and those that aren't.
QUESTION:

Well, they make a presumption that an

applicant from out-of-State probably has not been contributing
to the tax basis of Connecticut until he — before that time.
Now, that may be a presumption in an individual case that's
contrary to the fact.

But the question is, can they

constitutionally make such a presumption?
MR. DZIAMBA:
QUESTION:

Well, that is the question.

MR. DZIAMBA:
QUESTION:

I don't think so, because as a result

— as a result of that presumption -—

Isn't that the question?

23

MR. DZIAMBAt Well# I still don't think that's the
question.

But if I may answer —*
QUESTION: All right.
MR. DZIAMBA:

As a result of that presumption, a

student is not allowed, an individual is not allowed to show
that he is contributing to the tax basis of the State.
QUESTION: Well, you're answering the question, but
what I am asking is:

what is the question in this case?

It's not —
MR. DZIAMBA:

The question is —

QUESTION:

a matter of residence or nonresidence,

is it, it’s a matter of ~
MR, DZIAMBA:

Well, I think it is, as framed --

QUESTION:

it's a matter of:

can Connecticut

have this particular law, constitutionally?
Now, isn't that it, to put it very simply?
MR. DZIAMBA: Yes, I think that may be the issue,
but I think that the reasons the State says it needs this law,
and what it is trying to accomplish by having this law, have
to be taken into consideration.

What they say is that the

law allows us to determine the student's domiciliary intent
and allows cost equalization.
If I may cite an example:

cost equalization is not

a — contributing to the State tax basis is not am insurance
type program.

For instance, in Connecticut there are 2,000

24

out-of-State students in the University of Connecticut, and
there are 16,000 total students»

The total budget of the

University of Connecticut is between 45 and 47 million dollars
a year.
The sales tax and use tax, which are the primary
sources of income in the State of Connecticut, produce an
annual revenue of $325 million a year.

The gasoline tax

produces an annual revenue of $60 million a year.

cigarette tax ~ I'm sorry, the cigarette tax produces an
annual revenue of $60 million a year.

—• that in the total operating budget,

and in the amount of money that it would cost the University,
one of the arguments proffered by the State, and also in
terms of cost equalization, anyone who is in Connecticut,
who is either driving a car or buying merchandise is in fact

25

contributing to the cost,, to the tax basis of the State.
QUESTION?

Mr. Dziamba, do you attack the basic

constitutional right of the State of Connecticut’s
universities and colleges to charge a higher tuition to
bona fide nonresidents than they do to bona fide residents?
MR. DZIAMBA?

No, Mr. Justice Stewart.

QUESTION? Well, then, what’s all this about?
Because a bona fide nonresident, certainly while he’s in the
State, uses the roads and pays the gasoline taxes and so on.
But I didn't think you were making that attack.
MR. DZIAMBA?
the attack is this?

No, we’re not.

But I think that —

Mrs. Kline, for instance, who is the

named appellee in the case, did not come into the State
primarily for education.

It was incidental.

And as a result

of that incidental, she's being penalized to the extent that
she has to pay for the rest of her remainder at the univer­
sity, she must pay twice the tuition.
What we're attacking is that the State has the right
to adopt the differential between those who are bona fide
residents and those who are not.

It's the freezing in that

status that we say violates very fundamental constitutional
rights.
QUESTION?

Mr. Dziamba, would you concede that a —

that the State of Connecticut could restrict its State-supported
institutions to residents of the State?

26

MR, DZIAMBAs

Are you indicating citizen's bona fide

residence?
QUESTION?

No, not necessarily? residents of the

State,
MR, DZIAMBAs

I think that's a very difficult ques­

tion, and one that is, first of all, not presented by the
facts of this case.

And I think that it would have to be

analyzed in terms of the standards already set down by this
Court, and that is, the State may have a special public
interest it wants to protect.

But as the amicus points out

in his table 1, a lot of that money comes from Federal funds.
That there would have to be a clear showing, I think, in the
record, first of all, as to what evil the State is trying to
protect itself against by limiting a State benefit only to
residents of that State,
QUESTION?

It need not be to protect itself against

any evil, but just what purpose is the State trying to
accomplish? and that would be very obvious, it's trying to
give a higher education to its residents, being a sovereign
State,
MR, DZIAMBAs

But it's the determination of who

is a resident, which is the issue in the case,
QUESTION? Well, that's quite a different question.
That's a wholly different question from the one Justice
Blackmun asked you.

27
QUESTIONS

Mr. Dsiamba, --

MR. DZIAMBAs
QUESTION?

Yes, sir.

— isn't this kind of a classical case of

the Legislature sayings

from the existence of Pact A the

existence of Fact B will be conclusively presumed.

And when

you're discussing the constitutionality of that, you don't
discuss necessarily Pact B, or the relation between Fact B
and Fact A, you discuss whether or not the Legislature can
properly require the existence of Fact A.

Because it says

that one follows from the other.
I mean, that's more or less, I think, what Justice
Stewart is saying.
MR. DZIAMBAs Well, I think that a legislative
presumption that has no basis in fact is one that would not
be allowed.
QUESTIONx

No, but you meet that by saying what the

Legislature has in fact required is unconstitutional.

That

the particular law in Connecticut that is drawn here is
unconstitutional, and it doesn't necessarily -— wouldn't
necessarily turn, I would think, on other notions of
residency.
MR. DZIAMBAs

Well, I again come back to responding

to Mr. Justice Stewart's question; but I think that that is
the point.

I think that the statute has to be analyzed,

not only in what it says, but in the proffered purposes.

28

QUESTIONs Well, getting back to whether or not they
have to admit — whether they could exclude nonresidents.
Suppose Connecticut said the universities are open only to
residents of the State of Connecticut, and I’m a resident of
the State of Hawaii, and they refuse me admittance.

Now,

what constitutional right xrould I assert?
MR. DZIAMBA: Well, I think, first of all, Mr. Justice
Marshall, those are not the facts presented in this case.
But the question then would be, first of all, how do you
establish residency?

Hoy? can

QUESTIONS

Well, I want to knov? what constitutional

points you're talking about.

What right do I, as a nonresident,

have to go to the University of Connecticut?
MR. DZIAMBA: As a nonresident?
QUESTIONS

Yes, sir.

What constitutional •—
MR. DZIAMBA:

I think, Your Honor, that that is a

different legislative judgment than the one made here.

The

legislative judgment made here is that you do have a right.
Connecticut has not excluded — you do have a right, but you5
must pay more.

That, I think, is the issue.

Connecticut has not gone that far, and I would not
attempt to assess definitively the constitutional opinions
of going that far.
QUESTION: Well, then you agree that maybe Connecticut

29

could do that?
MR. DZIAMBAs

I would not say ~ I'd say you'd

have to look at the circumstances, at the amount, the degree
of discrimination against whom they were trying to keep out,
why?

The Federal Government has recognized that education is

a large problem shared by all of the States»

I think these

are all considerations that this Court has used in other
types of situations, and I think that they would be employed
to assess the constitutionality of this»
QUESTION?
unreasonable?

Well, do you say that this regulation is

What is your point?

The present regulation

MR. DZIAMBAs The present regulation is unreasonable
in that it does not allow a change in status.
QUESTIONS But if Connecticut could exclude all
people except its own residents, then would it not follow
that it can allow nonresidents to come in on any terms that
Connecticut wants to establish?
MR. DZIAMBAs
QUESTION;

I think, Mr. Chief Justice, that -—

You don’t seriously question that

Connecticut could exclude all nonresidents from attendance
on any terms, do you?
MR. DZIAMBAs
question iss

I think, Mr. Chief Justice, the

How do you determine residence?

determination —

Well, that's a factual question.

learning only for the people who live here.
MR. DZIAMBAs

MR. DZIAMBAs

No# I don’t.

I say that that has

QUESTION?

I see.

MR. DZIAMBAs

— on the particular basis in the

record that Connecticut would put forth why they need that
particular exclusion# just as
QUESTIONS

Well# what provision of the Constitution

would prohibit Connecticut from excluding all nonresidents?
MR. DZIAMBAs

I think that the privileges and

immunities clause would prohibit them from excluding all non­
residents# unless they showed — unless they could show a
particular reason why and substantiate it in the basis and
fact on the record.

I think the issue in this case iss

how do you establish residency?

How do you define residency?

And is that a rational definition of residency?
how do you establish that residency?

And then#

31

I think that what happened in this case since the
invalidation of the statute by the lower court is very
instructive, and that is that Connecticut has adopted adequate
criteria and, as they say, that each case ~ they say that
each case is a question of domicile.

The present standard

that they have now. And that each case must be decided on its
own particular facts, and that in reviewing the claim for
reclassification —
QUESTION:

That's the standard, the new standard?

MR. DZIAMBA: The new standard.
QUESTION:

Since the decision —

MR. DZIAMBA:
QUESTION:

Since the decision,

— of the District Court?

MR. DZIAMBA:

Of the District Court.

QUESTION: Right.

That's the Attorney General's

opinion?
MR. DZIAMBA: The Attorney General's opinion, yes.
QUESTION: Right.
MR. DZIAMBA:

And that relevant criteria for

determining that status, in-State or out-of-State, resident
or nonresident, A or B, include year-round residence, voter
registration, place of filing tax returns, property ownership,
driver’s license, Connecticut registration, marital status,
vacation employment.

And that under the present system a

student comes in and fills out an affidavit, and they ask him:

32
What is your parents' address?
your parents are separated?
address?

Who has custody of you, if

What is your age?

What is your marital status?

colleges that you've attended, with their addresses.
service, periods of service.

Military

Voter registration; driver's

license; automobile registration.
And provides that falsification of this will be
grounds for expulsion.
I think, Mr. Justice Stewart, in all candor, that
this is the objective of the State.

It’s not to say "only

for State residents" or "only for Connecticut residents", but
it’s to determine who is a bona fide resident of the State.
And I think this point is borne out by the
appellant's own brief, by stating again that the reason that
this particular irrebuttable presumption is adopted is to
allow the State to have facility in determining the student's
domiciliary intent and to effect some type of cost equaliza­
tion between those people who are contributing to the tax
basis and those that are not.
Our position is that there is no reason for such a
drastic irrebuttable presumption; that adequate criteria
exist, as this Court has well recognized, and not limited
merely to the issues of voting or welfare, but that if this is
the cfojective of the State, we must take the State at its word;
and if this is the objective of the State, that it must pursue

33

rational criteria to do that.
QUESTION: But when you have an irrebuttable
presumption, you're no longer dealing with a method of proving
something else, you're dealing with something that is itself
a substantive requirement, aren't you?
MR. DZIAMBAs Well ~
QUESTION:

I mean Connecticut hasn't said that

what we're really interested in here is residence; but we're
going to require it to be proved in a certain way.

As Justice

Stewart has indicated, it has said that whatever residence
may mean for other things, the requirement to get into
Connecticut universities, and pay in-State tuition, are A, B,
and C.

And those are themselves substantive requirements.
MR. DZIAMBA:

Yes, and I think that those require­

ments are unconstitutional, then, in that they effect a
penalty on the right to travel.
I think that that's a proper analysis.
QUESTION:

May I ask a question in that connection?

Your brief, in terms of constitutional analysis,
is based, as your last statement indicates, on a restriction
on the right to travel.

You have agreed that a State may

charge a higher fee for a person entering the State for the
first time to attend its universities than to a person who
has lived there, say, all his life.
MR. DZIAMBAs

If that person ~ excuse me, if that

34

person does not intend to become a resident of the State.
QUESTION:

Oh, —

MR. DZIAMBA:

Bona fide nonresident, yes.

QUESTION: Well, let's assume for the moment a bona
fide nonresident.

But the day he arrives, he’s confronted by

a very wide differential in fee, say five times as high. The
day he arrives, he says, I want to become a student of
Connecticut from now on.
MR. DZIAMBA:

A resident, you mean?

QUESTION: A resident, yes.
So far as his right to travel is concerned, would
that not be restricted, perhaps not as great as you suggest
in this case, but, nevertheless, it would be a substantial
restriction on his right to travel.
MR. DZIAMBA:

In terms of —

QUESTION: Even though he said, I do want to become
a citizen as of today and from now on.
MR. DZIAMBA:

Yes.

Yes. Then I think that the

individual inquiry is the one that's going to bring out his
reason.
QUESTION: But you come back basically to whether or
not there is a restriction on the right to travel; that's your
constitutional basis?
MR. DZIAMBA:

Yes.

I think that there is a restric­

tion on the right to travel for thbse citizens who also find

35

themselves students, those bona fide residents of the State of
Connecticut»

I think that a student who comes in to

Connecticut and says, I don't care about your State, I don't
care about remaining in the State, I want the benefit of the
tuition, and therefore I declare myself a Connecticut
resident.

I think that presents a vastly different — I

think the right to travel is one which has always been —
recently I would say -— connected with establishing bona fide
domicile? a new start? a new life? a life with one's husband.
As Mrs. Kline did in this case.

Her husband was a lifelong

resident of the State of Connecticut.
QUESTIONS

But Connecticut says he can do everything,

including becoming the Mayor of Hartford.
interfere with any of that*
MR. DZIAMBA:
QUESTION?

They don't

That's Connecticut's story.

Well, I think that ~

You can become a resident and you get a

right to vote and a right to run for public office and,
incidentally, a right to pay taxes? you get all those rights.
MR. DZIAMBAs

Sure,

And you don't get any reduction

in that obligation, either.
QUESTIONS But I don't see where your argument covers
that.

He gets all of the rights except this one.
MR. DZIAMBAs Well, he's also bearing all of the

burdens.

And that is that he doesn't get a reduction in his

sales and use tax —

36

QUESTION;

Well, Connecticut interferes with my

right to travel at least twice a year, I have to pay gasoline
tax when I got through? but I mean that's —
MR. DZIAMBA: Well, that's going through, that's not
staying there to live.
QUESTION;

Well, I stay there sometimes.

MR. DZIAMBA: But you don't consider Connecticut your
home.
QUESTION:

I'm wondering about your putting all of

your eggs into the right-to-travel basket.

That's what I'm

worried about.
MR. DZIAMBA:

Well, I think that the statute is

inform, i.e«, under the rational basis test, given the
proffer of purposes by the State.
QUESTION:

Well, are you going to get to the

unreasonable and irrational point any time in your argument?
MR. DZIAMBA:

I thought I covered that, Mr. Justice

Marshall, by saying that the State has put forth the reasons
why it needs this particular restriction.
QUESTION;

Well, that's the State interest points

What's the unreasonable point?
MR. DZIAMBA: The unreasonable point, I think, is that
there is no way of establishing residency for that particular
purpose.

And I think that that's unreasonable.

s
That if you are a bona fide resident of the State of

37
Connecticut for any and all purposes, and you're paying all
the benefits ~ you're paying all the burdens of taxation,
why that particular benefit, why not exclude you from the
hospitals?

Why not exclude you from the State highways?

Why not exclude you from the public libraries?
I think the State has to show a rational reason why
they want to exclude a bona fide, new bona fide resident
from that particular State benefit.

And I don't think the

State has sustained that burden here.
Thank you, Mr, Chief Justice.

anything further?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G„ HILL, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. HILLs

I would just make one brief comment,

Your Honor.
And it really — I'm not rearguing the legal points
in thisj I think some of the questions pointed up some of the
t

seriousness of this problem, and the effects of it.
If States are not allowed some latitude, I fear what
might very well happen is that each State might adopt such
stringent prohibitions or restrictions on admission of out-ofState students that they may very well lose the heterogeny
of a university, which it really requires.

And I think this

is just a policy issue that I would bring to the Court's

38

attention»

a one-year limitation.

QUESTION;

I suppose your answer, in part, is that

difficult situations.
