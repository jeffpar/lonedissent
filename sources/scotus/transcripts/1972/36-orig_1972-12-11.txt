Mr. McDaniel, you may proceed, whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF S. D. MCDANIEL, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF
MR. McDANIELs

Thank you, Your Honor.

Mr. Chief

Justice, may it please the Court:
Former Governor and Senator Daniel asked me to
express to you his regrets that he could not appear and
argue this case.

He has been appointed to the Supreme Court

of Texas, and our canons of judicial ethics prevent him from
appearing as an advocate.

He did handle the case before the

Special Master, however.
The maps which are behind me, one, you have an
individual map which I have had furnished to the Court.

The

large map is furnished by Mr. Stockwell, the counsel to
Louisiana.

I apologize to the Court that only three of the

copies which should be in Justice Marshall, the Chief Justice,
and Justice Blackmun's hands, so that all of you could see
for reference purposes, were all the color copies that the
Geological Survey Office here in Washington had of the map.
The others are reproductions made here.

I will refer to that

map some in the latter part of my argument.

As I understand the procedure that is to be followed
in. this case,,

there will be no rebuttal, even if I wanted to

save time for

it, so I ask the Court to please ask any

questions that you may have of me concerning any arguments
that Mr. Stcckwe.ll has raised in his briefs in order that I
may have the opportunity to respond to them ; and I also—
unless the Court has some question about it—will pass over
the question of jurisdiction of course and also the question
of whether ornot the United States is a

necessary party.

Where does the idea come from that you would

not have, rebuttal if you wanted to save a few minutes?
MR. MCDANIELs

That was the arrangement that we

were told by the Clerk, Your Honor.
Q

You mean in the arguments hers today?

MR. MCDANIEL:
Q

Yes.

There is some misunderstanding.

your argument as you wish.

You arrange

If you wish to save five minutes

rebuttal, that is the conventional pattern.
MR. McDAMXEls:

All right, thank you, Your Honor.

J. am glad to have that clear.
Q

I do not mean to limit you to five minutes.

MR. McDANXELs
Q

No, I understand.

Thank you.

We expect, however, that you make your

argument in chief in your-—
MR. McDANIEL:

Yes, by all means.

Let me commend Judge Van Pelt, the Special Master,
not only because I believe—
Q

You have got to keep your rebuttal within

your 30 minutes.
ME. McDANIELs

Yes, I understand.

Lee me command Judge Van Pelt for his report which,
in the great part, I speak in support of.
exception that we took to his report.

We have one

Really it is more of

a quibble than an exception, almost, under the facts of the
case.

I shall cover that last in my argument.
I particularly commend Judge Van Pelt and commend

to your use the appendix of the evidence which he has put in
the report, which is in great detail discussing the various
individual exhibits that he considers to support his findings.
Thxs is a boundary case, as you know, and it is over the TexasLouisiana boundary below the 32nd degree of north latitude,
which is the boundary in the Sabine River.
Q

One reason that you might have been told you

have no rebuttal is that you are the equivalent of the-—not
of the appellant or the petitioner here but basically of the
respondent, are you not?
MR. McDANIEL:
Q

That is correct.

You were the plaintiff below, but the Master

did what you wanted him to do, with one minor exception.
MR, McDANIEL:

With one minor exception.

6
Q

And so this case is reversed from its

ordinary posture, the ordinary posture of an appellate case
before our Court.
MR, McDANIEL:
Q

That is correct.

Mr, McDaniel, what was the significance of

the 32 degree point?
MR, McDANIEL:

The 32nd degree of north latitude

is the point at which the Sabine River ceased to be the
boundary between Texas and Louisiana,'
I will discuss the specific language of the boundary
in a moment and its significance to the case,
Texas claims by grant from the United States made
by act of Congress on July 5, 1348 and also claims title by
prescription and acquiescence.

Now, it should be pointed

out here I think, because this does bear on the point of
whether or not the United States should conceivably be a
party in this lawsuit.

The area which is involved in this

lawsuit was never a part of the Republic of Texas and it is
not a part of Texas' historic claim.

We claim purely as a

grantee of the United States.
Louisiana claims by theory of agency or osmosis
or something to have had prior title in 1848 as a result of
the treaty of 1819 with Spain settling the territorial
boundaries of the United States and Spain.
no mention Whatsoever of Louisiana.

This treaty makes

To Texas, the basic

question in the lawsuit is as between the United States and
Louisiana on July 5, 1840, who had title to the western half,
of the Sabine River, including Sabine Lake and Sabine Pass„
Q

The question is who had title as between the

United States and the State of Louisiana, is it not?
MR. McDAHIELs
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

There are no other possibilities?

MR. McDANIELs

That is correct.

At least certainly

none insofar as the lawsuit shows, the record indication.
Q

As far as either one of you on either side

of this.
MR. MCDANIEL:

Yes, that is correct.

We contend that Congress never granted the area
in dispute to Louisiana and that Louisiana's theory of the
case in addition to being wrong because the instruments just
do not grant it to Louisiana is constitutionally wrong
because Article 4, Section 3, gives to Congress the
exclusive power to dispose of the territory of the United
States.

And the first sentence of the Constitution defines

the Congress as consisting of the Senate and a House of
Representatives.

And a treaty which acquired property to the

United States is an executive action ratified by the Senate
and it cannot dispose of property to one of the states of the
union.
The history of the thing starts with the 1803

8

purchase of Louisiana at a time when the westward claim of
the Louisiana Purchase was completely unsettled.

Jefferson

and many other prominent people thought that the claim
extended clear to the Rio Grande,
In 1811, the Congress authorized the formation of
the State of Louisiana from the Orleans Territory.

Part of

the description relative to the case is in the Special
Master’s report on page 41.

What I am reading is from the

statutes at large, which has a little more in it than the
Master quoted.

It reads that 5!The inhabitants of all that

part of the territory are country ceded under the name of
Louisiana," and then talks about the cession from Prance
"contained within the following limits.

That is to say,

beginning at the mouth of the River Sabine, thence by line
to be drawn along the middle of said river, including all
islands to the 32nd degree of latitude."
The Louisiana Constitution of 18.12 is in virtually
identical language, except it inserts the word "its15 between
"all" and "islands."

And the 1812 Act of Admission by the

Congress is, I believe, in precisely the same language,

The

"its” is not in it.
The 1812 act admitting Louisiana as a state is also
pertinent, it seems to us, in another regard, because
Section 3 of that act reads this way, that "The said state" —
speaking of Louisiana—"together with the residue of that

9

portion of country which was comprehended with the Territory
of Orleans, as constituted by the act entitling an act
directing Louisiana into two territories and providing for
temporary governments thereof, shall be one district and be
called the Louisiana District , and there shall be established
in the said district a district court to consist of one
judge."
And in the 1850 publication of the statute at
large, which is the ones we have down in Texas, there is one
of these little marginal

squibs here that says the

inhabitants of Louisiana within directed limits to be
authorised to form a constitution and state.
We contend that the Congress of course knew
exactly what they were doing and were acting within what was
the normal procedure of erecting state boundary in the
middle of a stream when they defined Louisiana's eastern
boundary up to the 32nd degree of latitude here as being in
the middle of the Sabine River.
It becomes a lawsuit and a controversy because of
the 1819 treaty 'with Spain.

Wien that treaty was executed

after a considerable period of negotiation, the treaty called
for the boundary between the two countries to be the
western bank of the Sabine, starting at the westward mouth
of the Sabine and then up the westward bank.

This treaty

was ratified by Mexico in 1828; by the Republic of Texas in

10
1838o

The boundary was actually surveyed in 1840-41 by a

joint commission of the Republic of Texas and the United
States and was marked on the ground.

That was the extent of

Texas’s historic claim.
In 1345, of course,, we had the annexation, of Texas
into the union, or as President Polk referred to it in his
inaugural address, the reannexation of Texas into the union.
We do not think that there was anything at all out of the
ordinary about the

fact that the people who were the

leaders of this country in the early part of the last
century fully expected that there would be more states
organized to the westward of Louisiana.

Certainly President

Jackson and others never ceased their efforts to get Texas,
and ultimately they did.
The next act of significance in this controversy
is important enough that if the Court will indulge me, I will
read it with you.
report.

It is on page 42 of the Special Master's

It is a resolution not by some petty functionary of

the government of Louisiana but a solemn declaration of the
Louisiana Legislature, passed in 1848.

It reads as follows:

"Whereas the Constitution and the Laws of the State
of Louisiana, nor those of any other State or Territory
extend over the -waters of the Sabine River, from the middle of
said stream to the western bank thereof; and that it is of
importance to the citizens living contiguous thereto, and to

11
the people in general, that the jurisdiction of some State
should be extended over said territory, in order that crimes
and offenses committed thereupon should be punished, and
wrongs and damages inflicted should be redressed in a speedy
and convenient manners
"Therefore, be it resolved by the Senate and House
of Representatives of the State of Louisiana, in General
hssembly convened;

1st, That the constitution and the

jurisdiction of the State of Louisiana shall be extended over
part of the United States, embraced in the following limits
(whenever the consent of the Congress of the United States
can be procured thereto), viz.:

Between the middle of the

Sabine river and the western banks thereof, to begin at the
mouth of said river, where it empties into the Gulf of
Mexico, and thence to continue along the said western bank to
the place where it intersects the thirty-second degree of
north latitude, it being the boundary line between the

said

State of Louisiana and ftie State of Texas."
Counsel for Louisiana argued that this is an
assertion of Louisiana's boundary to the west bank.

We

argue the exact contrary, that it is an admission by the
Louisiana Legislature that they did not own the west bank in
a petition to Congress to allow them to extend their
boundaries too on it.
Texas passed a similar resolution in the same

month of 1848 and sent it to Congress.

Congress denied

Louisiana’s petition and granted Texas5s petition, and on
July 5, 1848, passed the act consenting for Texas to extend
her boundary over the eastern half of the Sabine River.

I

would like to read that particular language because it is
relevant to an argument I will make a little further on.
"Be it enacted"—and so forth--"that the Congress consents
that the Legislature of the State of Texas may extend her
eastern boundary so as to include within her limits one
half of Sabine Pass, one half of Sabine Lake, and also one
half of the Sabine River from its mouth as far north as the
32nd degree of north latitutde."
The Congress apparently realised full well that
Louisiana did not own this area and that the United States
did because on page 43 of the Master's Report is quoted the
report of the senate committee on this bill.

And in the

last paragraph appearing on the page, it says, "Mr. Butler
asked for the immediate consideration of the bill and
briefly explained its character.

The boundary of the United

States, it was known, embraced the Sabine River and lake to
its western shore.

The boundary of the State of Louisiana

extended to the middle of the Sabine; so that the half of the
river and lake, to the western shore, belonged to the United
States, and was not included in the State of Louisiana? there­
fore,_the boundary of the State and that of the United States,

13

was not identical.

The bill before the Senate gives the

half of the river beyond the boundary of the State of
Louisiana to the State of Texas, for the purpose of enabling
the latter to extend her criminal jurisdiction to the
Louisiana boundary."
Louisiana has also argued that all the bill does
is allot? Texas to extend its criminal jurisdiction.

But, of

course, it does more; it allows them to extend their boundary.
That is the way they allowed them to extend their criminal
jurisdiction.
And then it concludes:

"Mr. Johnson, of La., and

Mr. Dovmes in behalf of the State of Louisiana, expressed
their acquiescence in the arrangement,”

which, of course,

were their two senators at that time.
Contrary to the statement in the Master's Report
on page 9, which I think is an inadvertence, the statement
of the second question, "Does the doctrine of acquiescence
and prescription apply to the claims of either State and if
so, what is its application to the facts of this case?"
Louisiana has never pled nor claimed title by acquiescence
and prescription in this lawsuit.

And we contend that on the

law, Texas is entitled to judgment confirming her title in
the western half of the Sabine River.
Turning to—
Q

You are going to talk about the islands

14
then?
MR. MCDANIELs I am going to talk about them a
little later.

I would be happy to answer any specific

questions you have at this time,, but I am going to talk
about it.
Q

Is there any claim to the islands by

prescription?
MR. McDANIEL:

Texas claims the ones in the

western half by prescription.

Louisiana does not claim any

islands by prescription.
Q

They claim it as by grant, by the original

instrument?
MR. McDANIEL:

Yes, that is their claim for the

islands.
Q

But. not any of them by prescription?

MR. McDANIEL:

That is correct.

Only Texas makes

that claim.
Q

Are there any islands that straddle the

raid-line anywhere?
MR. McDANIEL:

Yes, I suppose in a broad sense they

are, and we concede that a line drawn along the middle of the
river when it intersects the line would have to go in the
western channel so that it would leave that island on
Louisiana's side.

But we do not concede that an island

completely on the western side of the river over in the

IS
western half of the river would be Louisiana’s island.
Q

Even if it were formed at the time of the

18.12 or whatever—
MR. McDANIEL:
existence in 1812.

That is correct, even if it were in

As a practical matter, and this is the

reason I said our exception was more a quibble, there are
few, if any, islands presently in the river that were there
in 1812.

There are very few islands in the river at all now.

Sven most of the ones that are shown on some of these maps
are not there.

And -we feel confident that the ones we are

interested in, at least, we could prove title to by
acquiescence and prescription, because Texas has used them
and made use of them for many years.
Q

Incidentally, I take it. there has never been

any question of the right of Texas or Louisiana for that
matter to free access?
MR. McDANIEL:

No, the statute admitting

Louisiana into the union in 1812 provides for free right of
navigation to the citizens of the State of Louisiana and all
other states, and the treaty of 1819 with Spain, if that is
of any benefit to Texas-—-and there is some question as to
whether it would be in this context or not-—also provides for
free navigation of the Sabine, even though the boundary is
placed by that treaty on the west bank.
The Special Master on the issue of prescription

16

and acquiescence has detailed a great deal of evidence, and
even what he details is not all of it.

What I am going to

briefly summarize is not all of what he details either0
On maps that he discusses as supportive of his
finding in favor of Texas, he discusses 12 maps by Texas,
18 by the Federal Government, and 31 by Louisiana, all cf
which recognize the mid-boundary.
maps.

This is typical of the

You will notice down here in the center on the

bottom it says, "For Sale by the U. S. Geological Survey in
Denver and Washington and by the State of Louisiana,
Department of Public Works, Baton Rouge."
and the Federal Government’s map.
Q

This is their map

It is not Texas’s map.

Do you not have to know something about how

a map like that v/a3 prepared and who actually made the
decision as to where this line should go?

It may have been

a surveyor hired a couple years ago that was riot vested with
any decisional authority on the part of—
MR. McDANIEL:
Honor.

We do not say it is conclusive, Your

We just say that it is modus to them in their own

instrument, that there is a claim here to the middle of the
Sabine River that has existed for many, many years and that
they have done nothing about.
Q

You do not treat it as an admission against

interest on their part, then?
MR. McDANIEL:

I do not think that when you are

17
talking about acquiescence and prescription you are talking
about the same thing as an admission against interest in the
normal sense.
Q

You treat it as evidence of-—

MR. McDANIEL:

In other words, what I era saying is,

I agree with you that whoever drew the map could not make an
admission against interest that would be binding against the
State of Louisiana.

It is only an evidentiary matter.

As to leases, there are 32 Texas sand and gravel
and shell leases that go to the middle of the river.

The

Master refers to a x^hole list of Texas oil and gas leases
and some pipeline easements. There are 30 Louisiana mineral
leases to the middle of the river and five Louisiana pipeline
easements to the middle of the river.

Both states have closed

parts of their respective half of Sabine Lake to oyster
dredging because of pollution.
The federal rivers and harbors appropriations made
to Texas over the years for use in the Sabine have been
numerous, which Special Master found to be a federal
recognition of Texas title.
were 61 such appropriations.

The period 1852 to 1913 there
In the period 1914 to 1969

there were 40 such appropriations.

Texas has participated

with the State of Louisiana in the erection of eight bridges
across the Sabine River which ware built to and maintained to
and policed to the middle by both states.

18
Taxes are assessed by both states on pipelines and
railroad bridges across the Sabine River on the basis of a
division line in the middle of the river, and this arrangement
has been worked out particularly by Kansas City Southern
Railway Company, which owns more than one of the bridges
across the river, with the officials of both states.
Police jurisdiction—both states through their
highway patrols and their wildlife officers patrol to the
middle line.
On the map you will note a long sliver of land
right off of Port Arthur.

This is Pleasure Island, which you

probably recall from the Special Master's Report.

It is an

area of 3,000 acres which has been reclaimed from the
western half of the Sabine River.

That reclamation work

started in 1911, and Louisiana has never made one peep about
Texas doing it.

Pleasure Island contains a golf course, it

contains a pleasure pier and marina, it contains the Reserve
Army and Marine Training Station, and it contains a carnival
and amusement area in addition to just having land out there.
It also is reached by a very high span bridge under which
large freighters and tankers can sale with sufficient
clearance.

Port Arthur is the 12th port in the united States,

12tn seaport, in terms of tonnage.

And Beaumont, which also

uses this channel, which is right up the Neches River here,
out of Lake Sabine, is the 3th largest port in the United

States»

Together, I believe their combined tonnage

makes

them the 4th largest port behind New York, New Orleans, and
Houston.
The evidence of prescription, voluminous as it is
in all of these little acts, it is not nearly as strong as
four things which I will now detail to the Court which seem
to me to be very strong on this point»

First, of course, is

the solemn declaration of the Louisiana Legislature, which
we read a few moments ago, expressly admitting that they do
not own the western half of the Sabine River-

That was

followed by another legislative act which the Master's Report
mentions on page 106 in the form of an appropriation by the
Louisiana Legislature in 1857, $15,000 for improvement of
the navigation of the Sabine River, conditioned upon Texas
making a like appropriation for a like purpose.
In 1901 we have a judgment of the Supreme Court of
Louisiana which has been affinned three or four times since,
holding that Louisiana did not hold the western half of the
Sabine River and could not exercise criminal jurisdiction
therein.

The facts of the case are somewhat amusing and are

pertinent, I think. De Soto, a parish in Louisiana, and Shelby
County, Texas, both border on the river.

Apparently gambling

was illegal in Shelby County, Texas, and the retail sale of
alcoholic beverages was against the lav; in De Soto Parish,
Louisiana.

So, Mr. Burton hit upon the solution of anchoring

20

his gambling estab3.ishment in Louisiana’s half of the river
and his whiskey establishment in the western half o£ the
river and rigging up a. system of pulley ropes between them
so that you could step on a dinghy and just pull yourself
down the rope over to the bar, if you wanted to, and get a
drink and then come back to the gambling establishment.

The

Louisiana officials prosecuted him for selling alcoholic
beverages at retail in De Soto Parish without a license and
the Louisiana Supreme Court said that although this was
manifestly an attempt to subvert the law, nevertheless
Louisiana could not extend its jurisdiction over Texas
territory by means of a rope.

The next time he got caught,

a year later, he miscalculated the middle of the river and
they put him in jail.
In 1938 we have several leases—these are discussed
on page 68 and 69 of the Master's Report---signed by the
Governor of Louisiana, which not only call for the middle of
the Sabine River but call for the boundary as set by the Act
of Congress of July 5, 1848.
Also in 1938 we have an opinion issued by the
Louisiana Attorney General’s office advising a man in
Monroe, Louisiana, a Mr. Igoe—I-g-o-e I believe it is—this
is at 69 and 70 of the Special Master's Report—that the
Louisiana boundary was set by Act of Congress of April 6,
1812—that is the act of admission defining the middle of the

21

river—and the Texas boundary by Act of Congress of July 5,
1848c

The man had written in and apparently he had gotten a

lease which purported to give him all of the river bottom, and
he wanted to know whether he got all or half, and the
Louisiana Attorney General said he got only half»
So, we have a declaration by all three of the
departments of government in Louisiana, the legislature in
1848; the supreme court in 1901 and subsequently, and the
governor and the attorney general in 1938, all clearly
recognizing that Texas owned the western half of the Sabine
River c
In her answer to all this, Louisiana alleges that
three parishes purported to extend their boundary to the west
bank»

I would point out to this that all three of those

attempts were before the Act of Congress of July 5, 1848,
and from the date of the Act of Congress on July 5, 1848
until the inception of the current controversy with the
beginning of oil and gas activity in the area about 1940 or
Ml there was no question of title.
The Special Master refers to the desirability of
having settled these cases years ago and quotes the first
Justice Harlan’s comment to that effect in United States v.
Texas in 1895 or '96.

The simple truth is a hundred years

ago there was simply no controversy about this matter.
Louisiana also argues that the Thalweg should be

22

applied.

We say that it is not applicable in this case for

four reasons.

Number one, there is no reason for it where

navigational rights are not at issue, and we cite Georgia v.
South Carolina for that proposition.

Secondly, we say that

prescription and acquiescence establish a line to the
geographic center of the Sabine River and that prescription
and acquiescence would overcome the Thalweg doctrine in any
event.

Thirdly, and this is not mentioned by the Master,

there is considerable evidence in the record that there is
no Thalweg in Sabine Lake.

The maps show a reasonably

uniform depth throughout the lake; there is even one in the
record made in 1777 that has uniform soundings throughout the
lake.

And, fourthly—and the Master emphasised this--the

Act or Congress of July 5, 1848 indicated that it was the
view of Congress that Texas was to get one half, one half,
one half, not merely to the middle of the river.
As to the islands—
Q

Is this a river that shifts the way the

Mississippi River has or used to?
MR. McDANIEL:

It shifts to some extent but not

nearly like the Mississippi, Your Honor.
Q

Would there be any difficulty—I am thinking

about contrasting the Thalweg with the geographical center
of the river; which would be the easiest to apply as a practical
matter?

23
MR. McDAHIEL;

As a practical matter, the geographic-

center would he far easier to apply.

In Sabine Lake, for

example, you would have to go out there and I suppose take
specific soundings all through the lake to try to find a
channel through it, which we do not believe would be found.
Q

You say it is at least arguable that it is

almost of equal depth throughout most of it?
MR. McDANIEL:

Yes.

On the island question, we think that the Special
Master only was interpreting the phrase "including all
is landsS1 to refer to the whole river rather than the area of
the river defined by the call for a line to be drawn along
the middle of said river.
Q

Which are the islands on this map?

MR. McDANIEL:
Q

On this map, Your Honor—

Give them to us by name.

MR. McDANIEL:

Sabine Island up here, which we

recognize is Louisiana’s.

there, West and Middle Pe\ss, Sydney Island; those are spoil
banks and are not islands.
at all.

Stute's Island is not an island

It is an area cut off by the intercoastal canal

off the mainland.

The little area there that is called

Dunes Island, there is some controversy as to whether or not
it was in the Sabine in 1312 or not.

It is not there now, so

it probably does not make too much difference unless the

24
Court should decide that Louisiana’s line is entitled to be
swung to the west of the furtherest island»

Then it might

become pertinent»
Q

What did you say about the Sabine?

Sydney Island is a spoil bank. Your

behind it.

It is spoil fromthe intercoastal canal.

controversy is not too significant to the lawsuit is because,

there are any islands there that were there in 1812»

Port Arthur and Beaumont, I take it, uses the Port Arthur
Canal rather than coming into Sabine Lake; is that right?
MR. McDANIEL:

That is correct, Your Honor.

The

channel here is shown to be 12 feet deep, which is the normal
channel of the intercoastal canal.

In fact, I feel certain—

and I do not think there would be any dispute about this—the
ship channel which comes up by Port Arthur and then goes on
up the Neches to Beaumont is considerably deeper than that,
because it uses full size tankers and freighters all the time
and they draw more than 12 feet,

But they do use that area and

25
not Sabine Lake»
Q

Are there any islands upriver to the 32nd

degree from this map?
MR. McDAN.IEL:

There is only one that I know of at

a place called the Marrows, and that was decided by the
Department of the Interior in, I believe, 1910, to belong to
Louisiana, that it should be measured from the xv-estern
channel.
Q

Why

is Texas objecting to that provision of

the Master's Report if there are no islands here to worry
about?
MR. McDANIEL%

Well, I say it is more of a quibble

really than an exception about the thing.

The only thing

that scares us a little bit about the island issue is that
if the Court should determine, as Louisiana contends, that
the boundaries should come over here if they can prove, say,
that Dunes Island existed in 1812, and fix a boundary on the
west side of Dunes Island because Dunes Island actually is
an alluvion island in the mouth of the Neches River.
Q

What, if anything, does this controversy

have to do with the boundary between Louisiana and Texas
seaward of the coast out to the three leagues for Texas and
three miles for Louisiana?
MR. McDANIEL:
Q

It has nothing whatsoever to do.

It certainly has something to do wxth the

26

starting point* does it not* of such a line?
MR* McDANIEL:

That gets us back to whether or not

the United States has an interest in it or not* and my answer
to that is this, Your Honor»
starting point* yes*

It does have an interest in the

as to the boundary between Louisiana

and Texas, whether it is the mouth of the Sabine or the West
bank.
Q

Whether it is the middle of the mouth or the

west bank»
MR» McDANIEL:

That is correct.

This does not

affect the United States, I do not think, because as to the
United Statas, the three-league limit only comes as far as
our historic boundary, and Congress has not consented for us
to extend it here any more than they have consented for us
to extend up here north of the 32nd degree of latitude»

So,

we have no controversy with that.
Q
boundary

But as between Texas and Louisiana, that

that is seaward of the shoreline, is affected by

this controversy?
MR. McDANIEL:

It is affected, and both states have

stipulated that that issue is to be excluded from this
lawsuit.

It will determine it obviously, but this lav/suit

will not determine what tangent that line sho\zld take,
whether it should be perpendicular from the coast or whether
it should follow some other line.

Thank you.

MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Stockwell.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF OLIVER P. STOCKWELL, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE DEFENDANT
MR. STOCKWELL;

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court;
I think that it is very important from Louisiana's
standpoint to have the Court appreciate the early history of
this particular area.

As Mr. McDaniel mentioned, when

Louisiana was purchased from France in 1803 there was a
dispute over what its western boundary was going to be. So,
in 1804 they created the Territory of Orleans, which extended
to the 32nd degree north latitude, which is the north boundary
of Louisiana.

So, in 1806-—and X think this is very

important, neither the Special Master nor Texas have reallycovered this issue-~in 1806 the United States and Spain
entered into an agreement creating what was known as a mutual
tone.

This mutual sons extended from the Mermentau River up

to the Red River.
watershed.

The Red River is part of the Mississippi

The big issue was, Louisiana was only to cover

the Louisiana watershed.

And the Louisiana watershed fell

somewhere between the Atchafalaya and the Mermenfcau.

So,

Spain had brought troops into this area and the United States
had brought troops in there, and they were getting ready to
have a confrontation.

So, they entered into this agreement in

1806 and provided that neither the United States nor Spain

28
would occupy this area.

They were to assert no jurisdiction

over it, and it really became a no-man's land.

And when

Louisiana was admitted as a state in 1812, it was admitted
subject to this outstanding agreement.
take possession of this area of land.
there and enforce any laws at all.

Louisiana could not
They could not go in

Of course, this was not

settled until the treaty of 1819.
In other words, Spain and the United States
negotiated a treaty to settle the western boundary of -the
Louisiana Purchase and also the Florida parishes.

Of

course, the boundary was not confined just to Louisiana.
went on up to the Red River and out to the Pacific.

It

But when

they settled that boundary, they settled it on the west
bank of the Sabine up to the 32nd degree north latitude and
then north to the 33rd, which is the northwest corner of
Louisiana.
So, no patents were issued in this area by the
United States.

When Louisiana was admitted as a state, the

Federal Government retained all unappropriated land.
when it was admitted as a state, retained its land.

Texas,
So, all

of the titles to Louisiana lands emanate from the Federal
Government except that of the streams.

So, during this

period, there was no title issued in here at all.
Q

That was known as the Free state of Sabine.

MR. STOCKWELL:

Yes, sir..

29
Q

I read that story about Mr» Murrell.

MR. STOCKWELL:

In ray brief I took the liberty of

putting a chapter out of this book of Murrell, who was a
freebooter in this particular area.

As a matter of fact, I

live in Lake Charles which is in this particular area.

It

is about 70 miles from the Sabine across to the Mermenfcau, so
you can see that there was quite a question when Louisiana
was admitted into the union up till they settled this dispute
in 1819, and finally they did not issue patents there yet
till about 1824.

They started issuing some patents.

And

even when they surveyed this line in 1844-41, Mr. Overton,
who represented the United States, pointed out the
lawlessness in this area.

Even when Texas was admitted as

a state in 1845, they still had this problem.
Texas did have settlements along the Sabine on
the west bank.

But Louisiana had no settlements.

All this

was marshland and it is marsh today, and way up the river
it is marsh.
bank.

The only settlements were along the western

I think that is important because, as the Court will

note in my appendix, I mentioned a letter from the Secretary
of State of the Republic of Texas to the Representative of
the United States concerning an interpretation of the word
"use" in the treaty of 1819.

Both the Special Master and

Texas have avoided a discussion of this particular phrase,
which I think is a main issue in the case.

The Representative

30
of the Republic of Texas said the word "use” meant the
exercise of jurisdiction over this water»
Vou see, in the treaty both the inhabitants of
Texas and the inhabitants of Louisiana had equal use in
navigation of the water, which gave them a use throughout
the whole river, and this use -was not limited to navigation.
That was something separate»

And Texas in this letter, which

is in the appendix, defines what they consider this use to
be.

They had forts here and ships were coming in and

smuggling, and they wanted to have the right to go out there
and exercise jurisdiction to stop this smuggling, which they
said they had a right to do.
This discussion was going on~~this was just prior
to 1845 when Texas was admitted.

So, it was not unusual for

Louisiana in 1848 to say that there was some question as to
whether or not they had full jurisdiction over the Sabine
even though their boundary was on the west bank, because the
Constipation said, "Commencing at the mouth of the Sabine,
thence along the middle to the 33rd degree north latitude
and then north to the 33rd.”
So, in this resolution that was ready by
Mr. McDaniel accurately, they said they were talking about
extending jurisdiction.

Here was both Louisiana and Texas

that had equal jurisdiction over this body of water by virtue
of the use.

And so it was a question of either Louisiana

31
having the full jurisdiction or like Congress decided to do,
they gave half of the jurisdiction to Texas so that they
could enforce the criminal lax";.
Even Texas—I think it is real important because
Texas talks about the fact ox Louisiana being able to
acquire this territory without a specific act of Congress.

In

one of Texas5 briefs—it is -the Plaintiff’s Reply Brief
before the Special Master--on page 6 they admit that—in
other words, they say? "Louisiana obtained title to the unsold
federal lands adjacent to the Texas eastern, land boundary
line by grants from the United States Government under the
Swamp and Overflow .Lands Act.

After its jurisdiction over

tile area had been recognized and acquiesced in by the United
States Government’s resurvey of such line as the west line
in 1846»"
What happened was, before Texas was admitted to
the union and before they made this joint survey, the United
States had gone in and surveyed a lot of this land, and they
have surveyed as part of the land that they considered
Louisiana that extended west of this line.

So, when they

made this survey in 1840-41, they had to readjust these
townships, and some of the people that had purchased land
from the United States Government in Louisiana received
indemnity for it and so that meant that Louisiana had to give
up some land out in this area.

And lines were readjusted,

as Texas admits, in 1846 to conform to this boundary agreement
in 1819,
Texas, in bringing this suit, they limited it to
this water boundary.

But Louisiana feels that the only way

the Court can appreciate this boundary dispute is that it must
consider the total boundary of Louisiana.

Texas3 view that

Louisiana’s boundary from the 33rd to the 32nd degree
north latitude would have to be recognised as a treaty bound­
ary.

They are saying that we are not entitled to the treaty

boundary from the 32nd degree to the Gulf of Mexico by virtue
of the language in the constitution of 1812 of Louisiana
which is the same constitution that covered the northern
boundary, which said that we are entitled to it.
So, we say that when the Court considers this case
in the light of the historical facts, that this act that they
rely on, this resolution, shows that Louisiana considered
that this was their west boundary.

They were only asking to

give them the jurisdiction, and the Congress gave the
jurisdiction to Texas.
If it is intended by this act that they transfer
this title to Texas, then under this Court9s case of
Mississippi v. Louisiana, Congress could not deprive
Louisiana of title to its land.

So, we say that is one of the

reasons why you find all of these maps and things with this
line in them.

33
In other words, there has been no question about
the question of jurisdiction, of fishing, hunting, and
various other activities on these navigable bodies of water,
because the citizens of both states had equal rights, unless
you consider that the jurisdiction was going to be
exercised in limited areas by either one or the other.
This particular body of water here is of recent
origin.

As a matter of fact, this was brought about by a

compact between Texas and Louisiana in 1954, creating the
Toledo Send Dam.

In this compact it was specifically stated

that this would not attempt to settle a boundary.
In other words, Texas knows there has been a real
dispute over this boundary for many years, and they have not
been misled.

As a matter of fact, Governor Jones in 1941

wrote a letter to the Governor of Texas stating that
Louisiana owned the west bank of the Sabine under the treaty
of 1819.

As a matter of fact, Mr. Giles, who was then

land commissioner of Texas, he claimed that Texas owned a
150-foot strip from this point on the Sabine 32nd to the
33rd.

In other words, at that time, they were trying to

claim that they owned over to Louisiana’s boundary under what
they said the wording of the constitution.

Now they admit

that Louisiana owns that.
So, it all goes to show that Texas really has never
had any firm—had any doubt that Louisiana has this claim.

34
Now they bring in a picture like this, which shows, you know,
on this fill-in here»

Actually all this fill was done by

the Corps of Engineers in digging these channels.
not done by Teras.

This was

The fact that Texas’s use of them--and,

of course, the United States has a navigation easement over
this whole body of water.

So, we say that Louisiana by

virtue of the fact that—
Q

Who built the Port Arthur pleasure pier?

MR. STOCKWELL:

The Port Arthur people built it on

this hill, Your Honor.
Q

But the United States Government did not

build that?
MR. STOCKWELL;

No, 1 am not trying to say—1 said

the fill was built by the Corps of Engineers.

They built on

that, but most of that was built after 1941 when they were
put on notice by Governor Jones that Louisiana claimed to the
west bank.
Q

Would you repeat that answer to Mr. Justice

Marshall?
MR. STOCKWELL:

In ansv;er to Justice Marshall, he

asked me who built the pleasure pier and all these works on
this island, and I said Port Arthur did.

The fill was made

by the Federal Government, but most of this work was done
after Texas had been put on notice by the Governor of
Louisiana in 1941.

In other words, it was not done where they

35
were not put on notice that Louisiana was claiming—
Q

In other words, your position is the fact that

Louisiana tried to do nothing about that has no relevance at
all to the question of time?
MR. STOCKWELLs

We are saying , Mr. Justice, that

actually as far as I can understand and as far as the record
showed—and I was not in this in the beginning, so I certainly
would not have any personal knowledge—the world war took
place in "41, which we all know about that,

And then soon

after that, Texas and Louisiana got involved in the tideland
litigation.

And from all the information we have—as a

matter of fact, when I argued the matter before Judge Van
Pelt, I mentioned that fact and it was not disputed, that
there was a kind of gentlemen*s understanding that neither
side would do anything pending the settlement of this tideland
litigation.
Texas settled that and immediately filed this suit.
And we say that there has been no evidence to refute it,
although in the brief they say they now deny that.
Q

This is an argument that Texas cannot make

anything out of the fact that Pleasure Island was built on
this fill.
MR. STOCKWELL;

That is exactly what we argue,

Your Honor, because of the fact that we had put them on
notice and decided not to do anything pending this tideland.

36

As a matter of facts, following this very suit,
Texas asked us not to bring in the tidalands issue on it,
which, like Justice Stewart said, we are going to have to
settle soma day.

Where the line is going to start and what

direction it is going to take into the Gulf.
Q

You are not trying to convince me that Texas

made this contribution to Louisiana, this pier?
MR. STOCKWELL:
Q

Wo, sir, 1 am not.

It is a big state, but I did not know they

were that generous.
MR. STOCKWELLt
make this.

I do not think they intended to

But, of course, Mr. Justice Marshall, actually

many things are built on fills and navigable streams without
affecting the title to the subsoil.

In other words, if, say,

the Federal Corps of Engineers gave Port Arthur the right to
put these works up, that does not mean they would have title
to the subsoil on which this fill has been made.

And that is

one of the arguments that we make in here.
Q

Who had title to the bridges over the Sabine

River?
MR. STOCKWELL;

Me take the position, Justice

Marshall, that it was in the interest of both parties—this
was a navigable stream, both parties wanted to have commerce
across it.

The testimony would show that these bridges were

not owned to one point in the river.

They ware owned half

37
and half all the way across.
Q

In other words,—

Is that the same for the police jurisdiction,

half and half all the way across?
MR. STOCKWELL;

No, sir, but some of our people

testified they did arrest all the way across.

I would say

that most of them recognized a division line.

I mean to ha

perfectly candid to the Court.
Q

The division line was in the middle?

MR. STOCKWELL?
there.

I think that this—

Well, it was along somewhere in

They were thinking about a criminal jurisdiction.

But I think as far as the bridges were concerned, they were
built maybe on a fifty-fifty basis, and they owned the whole
bridge together, and I think you will see from the testimony
there was not any line picked out in any part of the river.
Q

Mr. Stockwall, as I understand the common law,

anyway, if you were to occupy property which I claim and
possess it, a mere letter from me to you saying, s'I claim
it as mins/’which did not change your possession, would not
stop the prescriptive period from running.

I would have to

commence a lawsuit to evict you from the property rather than
simply send you a letter.

Would you not agree, at least

generally, that that same doctrine—
MR. STOCKWELLs

I would agree generally with that

premia©, Your Honor, but I feel if the parties mutually
understand that they have got another matter to settle and

38
they are not going to litigate over it, then I think that is
another matter„
Q

1 would agree with that.

But so far as

Governor Jones' letter is concerned, it seems to me that if
Texas was exercising possession prior to that and continued
to exercise it afterwards, 1 don't think that the letter would
be terribly relevant.
MR. STOCKWELL:

i think it would have a bearing

because states really act a little different from individuals.
I mean, X think that it is harder to get them to get into
lawsuits with each other, particularly friendly states.

1

mean, I think that is a matter that certainly X do not think
if you—but xv"e say that beyond that, that they agreed that
they would not litigate this, pending this tideland
litigation, which is evident in this very case, because we
are not litigating the part that extends into the Gulf.
Your Honor, we feel that the question of—
Q

Do you make any contention that prescription

does not run against a sovereign state?
MR, STOCKWELL:

We do not make that in reference to-

one state to another state.

We would not make it as to

individuals.
Q

But you think the same, the ordinary rule

would apply between states?
MR. STOCKWELL:

X think this Court has said that

39
you could acquire title by acquiescence and prescription—I
mean settle a boundary.
said on it.

So, I would accept what, this Court

That as far as between the states, in other words,

v;e cot’Id not say prescription would run against Louisiana in
favor of Texas or vice versa.

So, 1 would think if it was

an individual, it would be a different problem.
As a matter of fact, Texas had this very same
problem in the Mexican Boundary.

In the case of Figuerosa

they had a treaty in 1905 in which they settled some banco,
as they call it, which is made by the Rio Grande River.
Part of these bancos were taken from Mexico and given to the
United States and part of them went to Mexico.

The question

came up in this case, is whether or not a party acquired a
title to one of these bancos by limitation.

And the only

way he could acquire that title was that Texas got title to
this banco by virtue of the treaty and not by virtue of some
acts that were passed in 1923. and the court held that when
the United States and Mexico settled this boundary, that those
lands immediately became part of Texas and they did not need
any further action.

They said Texas had given up some land

and they acquired seme land, and that is the same thing as
Louisiana has done here.
¥our Honor, on the question of the Thalweg, we say
that certainly Louisiana is in this position—this is an
alternative plea if the Court feels that we are not entitled

40
to it.

This Court held in the case of State of Louisiana v.

Mississippi that the Thalweg applied to the east boundary
of Louisiana in the Pearl River and extending all down into
the Gulf, interpreting the same language in the constitution
that is involved in this case, the middle of the Sabine to
the middle of the Pearl.

They both had a right of navigation.

And, of course, we feel that certainly this Court in making
other cases dealing with navigable streams where you have
equal rights of navigation have always held that the Thalweg
applied.
The case of Georgia v. North Carolina is kind of
an unusual case, and we do not believe that that v/as more or
less—the parties more or less committed themselves in that
kind of a position, but we feel that the majority of the
jurisprudents in particular interpreted their ovm constitution.
This Court has held that the Thalweg rule would apply if you
feel that we are not entitled to the west bank boundary.
As far as islands, I v/ant to make a quick reference
to that.
Q

Have you any idea vzhat difference that would

make?
MR. STOCKWELL:

Your Honor, it makes a good deal of

difference as to how they come out of the Sabine Pass.

As a

matter of fact, you see, they have got a lot of channel work
in here.

The question is, When are we entitled to the

41
middle of the river?

Are we entitled in 1848?

You seef

there was about four or five islands up here, and the channel
came out-—in other words, when they made the survey in 1840-41
they made it on the west bank of the furtherest island.

So,

we say that it would make a lot of difference in coming out
of hare.

In that survey, they also found what they called

Dunes Island right off of the Meehes.
survey and referred to it.
of all of these surveys.

That was in the

In other words, they made notes
So, they referred to them.

If you

follow the case of South Carolina v. Georgia, then the Court,
if the language of that case would be accepted, would take
the channel west of these islands.

That is what they did in

that case.
And then there are other islands up the river
further too.

As a matter of fact, it is kind of unusual,

Your Honors, because Texas in their motion for judgment and
memorandum with respect to the motion on page 9, they admitted
this.

They say that Congress permitted Louisiana to include

within its state boundary all of the eastern half of the
Sabine, including all islands within the

stream.

So, we say that they only changed their position
later in this case.

As a matter of fact, v/e have a letter

from Mr. Giles that urged this same thing.

In other words,

he urged that they were entitled to the west half, exclusion
of all islands.

So, Texas in its own brief in the early

42

stages of this case, admitted Louisiana was entitled to all
the islands in the Sabine.

So, we say this is important to
