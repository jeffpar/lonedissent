Mr» Stone.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD B. STONE, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. STONEs

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
This is a

criminal tax case which comes here o:u

writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals.for
the Ninth Circuit.
The respondent in this case was indicted in the
Eastern District of California on the charge of wilfully
filing income tax returns which he did not believe to be

true as to every

material matter, an offense punishable as

a felony under Section 7206(1) of the Internal Revenue Cod®.
The elements of the offense defined in Section 7206(1}
are

that

the

defendant wilfully makes and subscribes

document, that the document be verified under the penalty
of perjury, and that the defendant does not believe the
document to be true and correct as to every material matter.
The evidence introduced at respondent’s trial showed
that respondent was & practicing attorney who owned a walnut
ranch which was managed by his step-mother.

During the three

years in issue, 1963 to 1965 inclusive, respondent sent his

4
step-mother weekly checks which she deposited in a bank
account for purposes of covering the operating expenses of
respondent's ranch.

Though there was evidence of several

different types of improper deductions claimed by respondent
on his tax return, the crux of the offense charged against
respondent was that he took deductions twice for these
operating expenses of the ranch.
What he did was, he deducted both the amounts which
he sent to his step-mother and in addition the amounts paid
by her out of those very same funds to cover the ranch's
expenses„
Respondent’s defense at trial, and the only matter
essentially in dispute in the transcript of

his case focused

primarily on his claim that he had no knowledge that the
deductions were false and consequently that he did not have the
requisite intent, whatever that is and we shall discuss that
at great length, necessary to support a conviction under
7206(1), which, as I indicated, requires that the defendant
commit the prohibited act wilfully.
In addition, however, respondent requested that
the jury be instructed that it could find him innocent of the
felony set forth in 7206 (1) but guilty of what, respondent
argued was the lesser included offense of delivering to the
revenue service a document known to be fraudulent, which is
punishable as a misdemeanor under Section 7207 of the Codec.

3
which respondent argued requires a lesser degree of wilfuXlness
than does the felony charge.
The trial judge refused respondent’s requested
charge to the effect that '

the jury could find him guilty

of the lesser included misdemeanor and respondent was indeed
found guilty as charged of the felony.
The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed
and held that respondent was entitled to the lesser included
offense- charge, for which reason it did not reach other
issues raised on appeal by respondent, and it is from this
determination of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit, requiring a retrial with a lesser included offense
charge that the Government has sought certiorari in this
case.
Q

Mr. Stone, just as a matter of curiosity, how

do you explain the heavier penalty under 72061, the felonycharge, for mere absence of belief in the truth as comparied
with the penalty for actual knowledge of falsity under 7207,
a mere misdemeanor?
MR. STONEs

I think that is a very important question

in this case, Mr. Justice Blackmun, to which X think the
answer is quite simple.

There certainly is, an anomaly at

first glance with respect to that.

The answer I think is that

7206, the felony, covers only documents which are signed by
the taxpayer, by the defendant, under penalty of perjury.

6

Whereas, the misdemeanor offense refers simply to any
document, including, for example, a worksheet handed to a
revenue agent in the course of an audit or—
Q

Or a state income tax return that he said here

it is-—■
MR. STONE:

An income tax return,, if properly filed,

is signed under penalty of perjury.

There is ah overlap

between the two offenses insofar as the misdemeanor also
applies to documents signed under penalty of perjury.

But

I think it is quite clear that the distinction with respect
to severity of penalty is attirubtable to the fact that one
section refers exclusively to documents signed under penalty
of perjury, and that is a reflection of a historical concept
that a document so signed represents a more serious
representation and probably in itself a greater consciousness
of effect of the filing of the document than does simply
hand, for example, a worksheet to a revenue agant.
Q

It has been that way a long time.

MR. STONE:
Q

Yes.

Although I gather the prosecution could be only

for a misdemeanor case of a signed document.
MR. STONE:
be.

That is right.

That is right, it could

There is an overlapping element which I think we are

forced to conclude leaves a certain amount of prosecutorial
discretion.

7
Q

Do you have any information about what the

practice is?
MR» STONE:

Yes, the practice is ordinarily, I am

told, with respect to income tax returns to prosecute for* the
felony»

But there is a discretion exercised and what you would

expect to be the factors playing into such a discretion are
used.
Q
individual

Would the discretion be exercised by the
U. S, attorney?

MR. STONE:

By -the individual U. S. attorney,

presumably in consultation with the fraud section of the
Tax Division and tine Internal Revenue Service.
Let me point out that the prosecutorial discretion
involved

in this overlap of offenses is not quite as great

as it seems to be because there is no minimum penalty set
forth in the felony provision and there is, of course, a
somewhat higher maximum penalty both with respect to
imprisonment and to fine.

But there is no minimum penalty,

so that the sentencing judge really is left with the great
bulk of the discretion to determine what punishment to
impose.

And in this case, for example, at least the prison

sentence was well below the maximum for a misdemeanor.
Q

I gather there are other consequences—

MR. STONEs
q

There are other consequences.

—of felony and misdemeanor besides a prison

0
sentence.
MR. STONEi

Yes, that is right.

To return to the matter of lesser included offense,
Rule 31(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides
that the defendant may be found guilty of an offense
"necessarily included in the offense charged,55
Either the prosecution or the defendant mayrequest that a charge of lesser included offense be given.
The prosecution may want the lesser included offense charge
for the rather obvious reason that it may think that the
jury could find the evidence insufficient to support the
greater offense charged, but sufficient to support a lesser
included offense.
The defendant's reasons for wanting the charge are
somewhat more subtle and complex, although 1 think as a
t

practical matter readily apparent.

One might think that the

defendant would reason that if the jury were to find him
innocent of the greatest offense, if would be to his, the
defendant’s, advantage not to leave the jury with a lesser
alternative ground for conviction.

But in practice it appears

that in many cases defendants feel that it works to their
advantage, for the Court to give the jury a range of offenses
varying in severity, of which the defendant may be convicted.
And I suppose, quite frankly, the underlying assumption cf
that is that the. jury may, for reasons not entirely related

8
to a factual determination that it is supposed to make in the
case conclude that it would prefer to see the defendant
punished with a lesser offense, which is not really properly
within the jury domain»
Let me state at the outset it is not really
entirely analytically what the function of the jury is
supposed to be to determine*-Q

Not analytically, but there has been a good

deal of comment over the years that that is precisely the
function of a jury, or at least this is a precise aspect of
the basic function of a jury»
MR. STONEs

There may be opinion to that effect,

Mr» Justice Stewart, but 1 think all the law on lesser
included offense and with this I think respondent does not
anywhere disagree nor did the court below disagree—-the
lesser included offense doctrine is very precisely designed
to avoid presenting the jury with a situation in which it
makes a choice on a non-factual determination.
Let ras state at the outset that though it is not
entirely clear whether the Government and respondent are in
complete agreement as to every aspect of the general contours
of the lesser included offense doctrine---and 1 shall refer to
a possible difference of opinion later on—with respect to the
key issue which this case presents, I think it is quite fair
to say that the Government and respondent are indeed in

10
agreement as to the general contours of the lesser Included
offense doctrine and disagree only as to the applicability
of that doctrine to the specific felony and misdemeanor
offenses set forth in Section 7206 and 7207.

Both parties

agree that if on the basis of the undisputed facts in this
case the jury could not find the defendant guilty of the
lesser offense without also finding him guilty of the
greater offense.

The lesser included offense doctrine is

inapplicable =
In other words, the doctrine does not apply for the
purpose of giving the jury which in fact finds the defendant
guilty of both offenses, discretion to enter a verdict only

on the misdemeanor.

That is not what the lesser included

offense doctrine is about, regardless of what may be argued
should toe the jury’s function in other contexts.
Where -the lesser included offense doctrine does
apply, howeverf is where the jury on the basis of the evidence
might reasonably find the defendant not guilty of the
greater offense but guilty of the lesser offense.

Consequently

in this case there must be a disputed factual matter which, if
resolved by the jury in a certain way, could render the
defendant innocent of the Section 7206 felony but guilty of
the Section 7207 misdemeanor.
If is undisputed here that the allegedly fraudulent
documents were made and subscribed by the defendant under

11
penalty of perjury.

So that that basic distinction in these

two statutes is not part of the underlying factual dispute of
this case.
What respondent does argue, and this is the key
problem in the case, is that Section 7206 uses the word
"'wilfully” in a sense different from the way that word is
used in Section 7207, that the standard of wilfullness
necessary to support conviction of a felony is greater than
that necessary to support conviction of the misdemeanor and
consequently that the jury could reasonably find that the
defendant was innocent of the felony but guilty of the
misdemeanor on a lower standard of wilfuliness.

So that his

position depends essentially upon reading the word
"wilfully” in Section 7206 to imply a higher standard of
culpability? if you will, a more evil motive than that same
word implies in the next section, 7207,
And in spite of the usual presumption,- the same
word would not be used differently in two consecutive sections
of the Coda defining very closely related offenses in a
different manner.

There is some superficial appeal to this

argument, as I stated earlier, for indeed it may appear
strange at first glance that these two sections punish closely
related offenses in a different manner unless there is a higher
degree

of

culpability in some way necessary to support the

more severely punished offense, that is, the felony.

12
And, as I have said, X think it is perfectly clear
that what that distinction is based upon is an historical
distinction with some validity, X think, in terms of reality
between fraudulent submission of a document signed under
penalty of perjury and simply a document which is not signed,
which is handed over to an official of the Government in
administrative capacity„
Having dealt with the reason why this immediate
anomaly is really only superficial, let me turn to what I
suggest is really the overwhelming reason and the overwhelming
way in which respondent's argument that wilfully in Section
7207 means something less than it does in Section 7206»

It

is patently contradicted by the language of these two
statutory provisions„
Section 7206, the felony statute, requires that the
defendant wilfully file a document which “he does not believe
to be true and correct as to every material matter»“
Section 7207, the misdemeanor statute, requires
that the defendant wilfully file a document "known by him to
be fraudulent or false as to any material matter."
Xt is difficult to understand on what basis the
court below could have concluded and respondents can argue here
in this Court that a statute which hinges liability on a
finding merely that the defendant did not believe the
documents to be true could imply a greater degree of

13
wilfulness than does a statute which hinges liability on a
finding that the defendant knew in fact that the documents
were false and fraudulent.

Indeed, if either of these

sections implies a higher standard of wilfulness or evil
motive, it must be the misdemeanor statute, which requires
knowledge that the documents at issue are false.
Respondent argues in his brief, without explaining
the basis of this argument, that these two formulations of
the defendant's state of mind are basically the same thing,
i. e., that not believing the documents to be true and
knowing them to be false are really not meant to imply a
meaningful distinction.

And I think there is a rather

significant irony to his arguing this, because he contends on
the one hand that two very differently worded phrases
implying to the average reader quite a different meaning,
and I think meaningful in many criminal statutory contexts
that these two very differently worded phrases used in
connection with closely related offenses in' consecutive
statutory sections are intended to mean the same thing; while
on the other hand he argues that the word "wilfully" also
used in an identical manner, the same word used identically
in these tv?o provisions, means something different in each of
these two provisions, and I think that that is a rather
strange version of statutory interpretation.
Q

He has the Court of Appeals going for him.

14
MR. STONE;

He has the Court of Appeals going for

him, Mr. Justice Stewart, on what I think is just an
inexplicable ground, which is essentially that misdemeanors
per se—
Q

Wilfully and misdemeanors—

MR. STONE;

Wilfully and misdemeanors means

something different from wilfully in the context of felonies.
And 1 think that the decisions of this Court make it
perfectly clear that the word "wilfully" may mean different
things in the contexts of different factual criminal—
0

Misdemeanor or felony,

MR. STONE;

That difference is certainly not based

on some arbitrary distinction between felonies and
misdemeanors.

And as X read the opinion of the Ninth

Circuit, that is virtually all that it says and quite
conclusively in support of its holding.
Furthermore, apart from the fact that if there, is
any distinction at all between the uses of the word
"wilfully" in these two sections, the higher standard is
really in the misdemeanor which requires knowledge of falsity;
let us look at what respondent says is the substantive
meaning of wilfully in the misdemeanor charge.

He claims

that tine standard of wilfulness necessary to support a
conviction of the misdemeanor is satisfied by a finding that
the defendant acted capriciously or with careless disregard?

15
.and that it is not necessary "that the defendant form the
specific evil purpose of misleading the Government»"

This

is the language of his requested charge and language
basically adopted by the Court of Appeals»
It is» I suppose, somewhat paradoxical for the
Government to be- in the position of arguing for a higher
standard of culpability than does the defendant, even with
respect to a charge that has not been brought against this
particular defendant.

But frankly we simply cannot square a

standard of careless or capricious behavior and a lack of
purpose to mislead the Government with the requirement in
Section 7207 that the defendant wilfully submit documents
which he knows to be false.
Q

Mr. Stone, I understand that the respondent

contends that another paradox is that the Government on other
occasions has urged much the same construction of the
misdemeanor statute as the respondent now urges.
MR. STONE?

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, it is not clear

that the Government has ever urged in any tax misdemeanor
statute a standard of mere carelessness or capriclousness,
and we deal with that in the reply brief in some detail, in
the reply brief to his opposition to our petition.

But in

}

any event, the only statute which he even claims! that we have
ever applied a standard of carelessness or capriciousness to,
the only misdemeanor

tax statute, is Section 7203 which

16

deals with wilfull failure 'bo file required documents, and
a wilful! omission of a required act may involve a different
and lower standard, of evil intent or wilfulness than does
submission of a known fraudulent document.

So that really

we are not trying to apply across the board in any context
a universal standard of what the word "wilfully” means.
That depends in each instance upon an analysis of
the factual background that the statute is directed towards.
Indeed, this Court has specifically rejected the argument that
the misdemeanor set forth in Section 7207 can be committed
merely by carelessness and without conscious knowledge of the
wrongfulness of the defendant’s act.
In the San3one case at 380 U„S. p the defendant was
tried for the felony charge of wilfully attempting to evade
taxes, which is defined in Section 7201; and he requested
there, as here, a lesser included offense charge to the effect
that he could be convicted if it were found that he did not
have the requisite intent for the felony of wilfully
attempting to evade taxes.
Q

He could still—

He had to meet with two felony statutes„ right?

MR. STONE;

One felony and two misdemeanors, I

think, Mr. Justice Marshall.
Q

But it was.two felonies, I know, was it not?

MR. STONE;
7201,

I think the only felony involved was

There were two misdemeanors.

I think 7203, the failure

17
to file was also involved.

But I think what he asked for

in Sansone was a charge that instead of the felony, he could
be charged with either of the two misdemeanors.

But, in any

event, I do not think that is important for our purposes here
because the key issue in Sansone

is that the Court denied

him a lesser included offense charge and stated quite
specifically that at least with respect to the standard of
wilfulness that the standard of wilfulness in both felony
7201 and the very misdemeanor at issue here required some
sort of wilfull knowledge and evil intent.

And the Court

quite specifically rejected there any notion that Section
7207 can be satisfied by a mere showing of careless or
capriciousness.
Furthermore, I think the Sansone opinion, which was
really not dealt with by the Ninth Circuit in any meaningful
way, precludes the Ninth Circuit across-the-board holding that
the standard of wilfulness in tax misdemeanors is necessarily
less than it is for tax.felony, because Sansone said that the
standard of wilfulness with respect to that tax misdemeanor,
the one at issue here, and the tax felony at issue there,
were indeed exactly the same.
Finally, we make an alternative argument that is
related in several respects to our contention that the
misdemeanor in Section 7207 does not import a lesser degree
of wilfulness than does the offense set forth in 7206 but

18

which focuses on the applicability generally of the lesser
included offense doctrine itself,

This is a slightly

different argument * though based upon many of the same
underlying reasons,
At common law, as we point out in our brief, the
lesser included offense doctrine was restricted to situations
in which the misdemeanor was entirely included in the statute,
that is, in which there was no element necessary to sustain
a conviction of a lesser offensa which was not necessary in
addition to sustain conviction of a greater offense.

This

strict version of the lesser included offense doctrine
appears to have been incorporated in the federal rules of
criminal procedure,for Rule 31(c) requires that the
defendant may be found guilty of an offense necessarily
included in the offense charge.
Some jurisdictions have allowed slight deviation
from that rule, and respondent implies in his brief that he
feels that some of the circuit courts have implied by way of
dicta that there may be situations in which the federal courts
could allow a lesser included offense charge even though
there could conceivably be circumstances in which the
defendant could be found guilty of the later offence without
being guilty of the lesser offense.

And I do not think we

have to get into the precise contours of the lesser included
offense doctrine

19
I-think whatever justification there may ba for
a slightly more liberal application of this doctrine, it
should not be applicable here,

For even if contrary to our

contention the Court were to find that the word "wilfully"
in Section 7206 means something more than it does in
Section 7207, the misdemeanor under Section 7207 would still
not be a lesser included offense within the felony under
Section 7206, because knowledge of falsity is a key element
of the misdemeanor but is not an element of the felony.
Even if wilfulness has no relationship by some
strange quirk to the states of mind that are defined in these
very statutes, it cannot be denied on the language of the
state that there is an element, a key element, in the
misdemeanor, an element which was in actual dispute in this
case, since respondent’s defense rested almost entirely upon
his assertion with respect to his state of mind.
There is a key element of the misdemeanor which is
not necessary to support the felony.

And, consequently,

under even a slightly more liberal reading than is
traditional and than is implied by the federal rules of the
lesser included offense doctrine, this offense, this mis­
demeanor, is not a lesser included offense t-d-thin the
broader scope of this felony because there is a key element,
to wit, knowledge of falsity that is not necessary to support
the felony.

Q

Are you going to rely on the Berra case?

but he was charged under the felony and in an opinion by
Justice Harlan the court was not required to charge in the

MR. STONE:
point.

Well„ Mr. -Justice Stewart* that is the

That is tha point here.
There was a rather strong dissenting opinion in that

case-Q

Yes* I know* by two justices.

MR.STONEs

Justices Black and Douglas* I believe*

dissented in that case on the ground that they feel that a
statute ought not to be interpreted* if possible* to render
the prosecution with any degree of discretion to choose
between which offense when tha underlying commissions are
identical.
Q

I suppose boiled down and analysed this

simply upheld prosecutorial discretion* did it not?
MR. STONE:
Q

It did*

Though it is not put in quite those terms.

21

MR. STONEs

That is right.

that the dissent put it on.

But that was the ground

1 do not think that the holding

in that case, in the majority opinion, in any way
contradicts our-—
Q

It helps you.

MR. STONE:

It helps us, yes.

And it certainly

does not contradict our assertion that—and really I do not
think this is in contention.

I do not think respondent bases

his argument at all upon a general attack of the lesser
included offense doctrine.
If it is obvious that the two offenses have to be
identically determined, then it is perfectly clear that the
lesser included offense doctrine is not applicable.

And what

Justices Black and Douglas resented in that casa I think in
their dissent was that statutes are not to be interpreted to
overlap to too great an extent, because it is improper for
the prosecutor to have accepted discretion that is ordinarily
the domain of the judge.
Q

In Sansone"did not the opinion of Justice

Goldberg indicate that there was an important judicial
policy not to give the jury too much choice on the selection
of the crime and therefore of the penalty?
MR. STONE;

That is right. What the Sansone case

specifically said was that the domain of the jury was only to
choose between offenses on the basis of determining the

22
factual background that would support one offense or the
other and not to find that the defendant was guilty of both
offenses and then to go ahead and choose which one to find
him guilty of.
Q

That is precisely what Sansone said,
That would permit the jury to be picking the

sentence,
MR. STOKE:

That is right.

That would permit the

jury to invade the domain that everyone agrees is proper for
the judge and that in some circumstances is proper within
limited bounds for the prosecution,
I would like, Mr, Chief Justice„ to reserve the
small amount of time 1 have left for rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF' JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Johnston.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF J» RICHARD JOHNSTON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. JOHNSTON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
I would like to refer first to the matter of the
Berra case which was just mentioned.

That case was one which

held in fact that Section 3616(a), which is the predecessor
section to the misdemeanor section that we are concerned with
here, namely 7207, was in fact co-eKtensive with a felony
section.
But in the following year, 1957, this Court decided

23
the Achilli case in which it then held that, 3616(a) was not
applicable to income tax returns at all»

And it was not

until the Code was revised in 1954 and the substance of
3616(a) then came back into the income tax sections in the
form of 720? , with which we are concerned today, that that
section again became applicable to income tax returns«,

And

part of the holding in the Sansone case is that 7207 does
apply to income tax returns.
What X should like to do, with the Court’s permission,
is to deal first and rather briefly with two of the points
that counsel has made and then address myself to what X really
consider to be the heart of the problem that is presented
here.
Both in the Government's brief and in the argument
today the Government has argued that the instructions that
we requested and which were not given by the trial court were
improper because they stated a standard of wilfulness in
connection with 7207, misdemeanor offense, that really amounts
to nothing more than negligence.
Our answer to that is really in two parts, 1 suppose.
The first is that 1 want to make it quite clear that I do not
argue to this

Court that that is a proper standard of

wilfulness under 7207 or under any criminal statute.

It is

the standard that had been adopted by the Ninth Circuit in
which our trial took place.

And in framing proposed

instructions for the trial judge my aim necessarily was to
propose instructions that would meet the law as it has been
held in the Ninth Circuit«,

And 1 was successful , at least

to that extent.
Our position is,, however, that the question that is
raised at this stage of the proceeding is not whether the
instructions that we requested correctly stated the law but
whether the instructions that were actually given by the trial
judge correctly stated the law®

And we argue in our brief

that under the rules and under the decided cases, we are not
required to propose instructions to the tri.al court.
Our position is taken, if we make timely objection
to the instructions that are given or to the omission of the
instructions that we think should be given, if we fairly and
correctly state the grounds for the objection, our success or
failure later on should not depend on whether the instructions
that we then drafted and proposed to the trial judge meet the
test that this Court may finally determine to foa correct.
This we think is true under Rule 30 of the Rules of
Criminal Procedure •.

We cited in our brief also the case of

United States v. English and an excerpt from Volume 8 of
Moore's Federal Practice.
So that my position here today is not that the
standard of negligence

or something that approaches

negligence as it has been formulated and applied in the Ninth

25

Circuit is necessarily a correct standard of wilfulness under
this misdemeanor section or under any misdemeanor section»
Our position is simply that the word "wilfully" as used in
the two sections with which we are concerned in this cases,
namely 7206 and 7207, has a different meaning in those two
sections.

And our argument is that it means something less

in 7207, the misdemeanor section, than it means in 7206, the
felony section.
In capsule form our argument is that if wa are
correct in that contention, then we were entitled to the
lesser included offense instruction, and it was error on the
part of the trial court not to give such an instruction.
Q

The argument that the- same word might have

different meanings has a lot of force in statutes that are
either unrelated or separated either in subject matter or by
the number of pages and the time of the enactment«

But when

■they are in two successive paragraphs , is that not a little
more difficult burden'?
MR. JOHNSTON:

Perhaps so, Mr, Chief Justice, but

this—
Q

These are both subjects at the same- time, are

they not, when the draftsman are working on it?
MR. JOHNSTON:

They are not necessarily thinking, X

believe, that the word has identical meaning in the two
sections.

And 1 would suggest that this Court in the Spies

2S
case» however it is pronounced» in 1943 spoke at some length
referring hack to the older case of Murdock in which the Court
in its opinion had a long paragraph to the effect that the
word "wilfully'' is a word of many meanings » and it has listed
a variety of meanings that may be given to that word.
are both tax cases»

These

These are both criminal tax prosecutions „

And in the Spies case» as a matter of fact» the Court
suggested that the word might have differant meanings with
respect to two portions of the very same section»

That

section at that time was 145(a) under the 1939 Code.
the present 1954 Code that becomes 7203«

Under

And the Court said

it would assume that perhaps the word meant something more
when connected with a wilful1 failure to pay than when used
in connection with only a wilfull failure to file a returnSo that I think in a general sense» at least» there
is a good deal of authority in the decisions of this Court
for the proposition first that the word "wilfully" dees have
different meanings» that it doss not invariably mean the same
thing, and that it may indeed have different meanings when
used in different sections relating to criminal tax offenses.
Q

What is inconsistent with Congress having said

that where you wilfully file a paper which you do not swear
to it is a misdemeanor, and when you wilfully file a paper
which you swear to, that is a felony?
MR. JOHNSTONs

I do not say that is necessarily

27
inconsistent, Mr. Justice.
Q

1 did not think so.

What do you think

"wilfully” means in the misdemeanor statute?
MR. JOHNSTONs
Q

You are not using the negligence now, are you?

MR. JOHNSTON?
Q

My own position—

No.

1 agree—

Ones you get rid of negligence, what do you

have?
MR. JOHNSTON;

I agree with the Government that the

word "wilfully" when used in any criminal section should
mean at least intentionally and deliberately.

This, I think,

is a kind of minimum meaning for the word "wilfully."
Let me suggest, which we have said in our brief,
that there are three rather commonly or frequently accepted
meanings of the word and perhaps four.

The lowest level of

culpability would be the Ninth Circuit definition of wilfully
in misdemeanor cases, the definition that is given in the
Ninth Circuit opinion in this case, where they say it may mean
no more than without reasonable cause or capriciously or with
careless disregard of one’s obligations or whether one. has the
right so to act.

That is a very low level of culpability.

The next level up the scale, I should think, would
be the level which would include at least intentional and
deliberate action.

And, as I have pointed out previously, I

make no argument for the Ninth Circuit level, but X think that

the word might very well foe held to mean intentionally or
deliberately under 7207,, and then under the felony section,
7206, the Court might hold as many courts have held, many
circuit courts, that there is an added requirement in the
felony section»

Not only must the act ha done intentionally

and deliberately, but it must foe done with a bad purpose or
an evil motive, some additional state of mind, seme additione,
intent that is superimposed»
Q

Like taking an oath?

MR» JOHNSTON:
Q

Well, perhaps, Mr. Justice.

Is that not the difference between, the two

statutes?
MR. JOHNSTON:

The fact is that in our factual

situation where we are talking about income tax returns and
in any case where we are talking about

tax returns, the

other portions of the law and regulations require that the
returns ha made under penalty of perjury»

The declaration

is stated right on the return»
Q

But is that not the difference between the two

sections?
MR. JOHNSTON:

But in the case where we are

talking about—
G

Where you wilfully file, is my first question,

was the difference between wilfully file a piece of paper
that does not purport to foe an oath and wilfully filing a

29

piece of paper which is an oath.

Wilfully would mean the

same in both statutes and yet Congress could make a
distinction between the two.
MR. JOHNSTONs

Mr. Justice? X think it could be

•the same? but ray argument to the Court is that it should not
foe construed, by this Court to mean the same.
Q

You do not think Congress did make that

distinction?
MR. JOHNSTONi

1 think the Court now has the job of

deciding what Congress’s intent was.

And if I may quote from

the Court's statement in the Achilli casa? which 1 think is
most appropriate here? this Court said in the Achilli in
1957:

"Our duty is to give coherence to what Congress has

done within the bounds imposed by a fair reading of
legislation."
So, here we have a group of sections that fall in
the same portion of the Internal Revenue Code.

The sections

that we are concerned with today are two of those sections.
There are others that precede and follow.

My argument to the

Court is that in connection with the filing of any kind of a
tax return, which is required by other provisions of law to be
filed are to be made tinder penalties of perjury so that that
distinction does not apply when we are talking about any tax
return.

It doss not make much sense and it does not result

in a rational construction and interrelation of these sections

.30

to conclude that wa have two sections then which at least
with respect to tax returns prohibit precisely the same
offense and yet—
Q

I understood that the second; the misdemeanor

one, was not limited to tax returns? it was any tax informa­
tion you might give*
MR. JOHNSTONs

That is correct.

That is correct;

Mr. Justice.
Q

That does not require an oath.

MR» JOHNSTONs

No, sir.

But the case that we are

concerned with involve® tax returns, and tax returns are
required to b© made under penalty of perjury.

And this Court

has held that 720? applies to the filing of income tax
returns.

So that my argument to the Court is that we do not

achieve -the kind of coherence that the Court seeks to give to
acts of Congress if we arrive at a conclusion that we have
two sections which, at. least with respect to income tax
returns, prohibit precisely the same act and in the one case
the act is punishable as a felony by imprisonment for not
more than three years and a fine of not more than $5000, and
in the other case punishable only as a misdemeanor with a
maximum punishment of one year or $1000.
If those two sections are to be given any kind of
rational coherence as part of a total system of sanctions,
of which this Court has spoken in the past, then it seems to

31
me it is very reasonable to argue that the difference must
he that the requirement of wilfulness in the misdemeanor
section is something less than what is required in the
felony section.

And if this Court arrives at that

conclusion» regardless of how the term is to be defined for
the two purposes » if it means something less in the
misdemeanor section

than it means in the felony section, then

say argument is that Mr. Bishop was entitled to a jury
instruction on the subject of lesser included offense.
Q

Mr. Johnston» just as a matter of English

usage» 1 take it "wilfully" is an adverb.

What does it

modify under your construction of the two statutes other than
the verbs "deliver" or "disclose" in 7207 or "make" and
"subscribe" in 72GS?
MR. JOHNSTON:

I think»

Mr. Justice» those are the

verbs that, it modifies or describes.

In 7206 it is in terms

of any person who wilfully makes and subscribes any return
and so forth.

Wilfully modifies, I take it» making and

subscribing.
Q

So# the variations in the definition of

wilfully that you adverted to go to the state of mind with
which one performs this act?
MR. JOHNSTONs

Precisely.

I think when we talk

about wilfulness, we are talking about only a state of mind.
We are talking about intent.

We are talking about some degree

32
of specific intent: , as distinguished from lesser kind of
intento

And that is the whole question, I think, how this

word "wilfully" is to be defined as a desdripfeion of someone's
state of mind at the time he performed an act.
q

In the Ninth Circuit's construction, a person

who carelessly or inadvertently delivered a return would be
guilty, which really does not make much sense at all if he
did not actually intend to deliver the thing.
MR. JOHNSTONS

1 hope I have made it clear I have

some difficulty with that position also, Mr. Justice.

But 1

would point out that 7207, the misdemeanor section, by its
language applies only to returns, documents, and so on, known
by him to be fraudulent or false, so that there is a
requirement of knowledge that the document is false, which is.
part of that section.

And the word "wilfully" then, I take it,

describes the state of mind or the additional state of mind,
perhaps, of the taxpayer when he files

his return.

The

requirement of knowledge is in that section regardless of the
meaning of the word "wilfully."
Q

Then does not "wilfully" almost boil down to

whether or not the act of delivery is required to be
intentional or not?
MR. .JOHNSTONs

Well, I think that is the question.

And my suggestion is that perhaps a definition in terms of
intentional action is a proper definition of the term in this

33

misdemeanor section.
There is another word which might be suggested
which X think the courts have not used particularly.

One

might define the term somehow in terms of recklessness,
recklessly doing something.
Q

Reckless means not actually intending but

grossly heedless of the consequences or something like that,
does it not?
MR. JOHNSTONs
negligence.

Q

Perhaps it is only a kind of gross

We get degrees of meaning.

x

can see how you can describe someone

driving recklessly.

But I have great difficulty in seeing

how you can describe somebody as recklessly delivering or
disclosing something to the secretary, knowing it to be
false.
MR. JOHNSTONs

Let me suggest a possible factual

situation which might indeed have been the situation here.
A person prepares a tax return
that someone else has worked up.

using in part information
That was the situation here.

Mr. Bishop used lists of itemised expenditures, and then the
total of that list was put into the return as a deduction foxfarm expense.
Conceptually his state of mind may have been that
although he did not check through the list—and he testified
that he did not and he did not go through and identify each

34
item that was in the list—-he might well have had some
reason to suspect that there were items in that list that
were not properly deductible.

And yet without checking it

out, without determining whether the list contained only
deductible items, he nevertheless put the total amount into
the return and took the deduction.
Q

But that would go to his knowledge of falsity,

not to the intentional character of his actual filing of the
document, would it not?
MR. JOHNSTONs

Mr. Justice, when I use the term

"recklessly/* I mean perhaps he proceeded without taking some
further steps to satisfy himself of the accuracy or
inaccuracy of the return, which perhaps he should have taken*
To me that is a kind of recklessness.
good .word.

Maybe it is not a very

But I suggest it as a possible one, at least.
Reference has been made to the Sansone case. I have

difficulty with some of these casess

I am never quite sure

how these gentlemen pronounce their own names.

The Sansone

case is one which of course the Court must consider.

And

obviously it poses some problems for us.
San8one was a case v?here in the first place the
taxpayer was charged under 7201, which is a felony section,
the section that used to be used mostly, 1 think, for attempted
evasion, a wilfull attempt to evade or defeat tax or the
payment thereof.

That is not the section that

we are

35

concerned with hers# so that there is at least that basis
of distinction.

The felony section that we are dealing with

is 7206.

In that case, the taxpayer requested instructions
to the jury that they «night find him guilty of a lesser
included offense under either 7203, on the basis of a failure
to file, a wilful! failure to file, which is a misdemeanor,
or 7207, which is the misdemeanor section that we are
concerned with here, namely, filing a false return.
Let me state another fact.

Prior to the trial

apparently, when the taxpayer was being examined by the
agents, he had explained that he had capital gain on some
sales of land, that he knew he had to gain and that he
deliberately did not include the gain in his returns becauseX am going to start again.
At the trial—this was his explanation—that he had
the gain, that he deliberately omitted it from, the return
because he thought that he did not have the money to pay the
tax, and he intended at a later date to report the gain and
pay the tax.

That was one explanation.

Another explanation he had mad© was that he
anticipated some expenses in connection with a creek that
abutted the property he had sold, and it was his thought that
those expenses might very well offset the gain on the sale,
so that he would wind up without any gain.

36
And the precise holding of the Sansone case, as I
understand it, is simply that the explanation that he intended
to report the gain and pay the tax at a future data would
not vitiate wilfulness, and this is the Court*© term, under
any of the three sections»

The Court said that is not a

defense, that does not negative wilfulness under any of the
three, 7201, 7203, or 7207»
The Court in fin opinion written by Mr» Justice
Goldberg, went on to make a statement which 1 think is
strictly dictum but which quite frankly gives us soa®
difficulty, in which Mr» Goldberg apparently assumed that the
meaning of wilfulness was the sama in each of these three
sections, and also that the meaning of wilfulness was to be
equated simply with knowledge»

This is done without any

discussion of the argument, the kind of argument, or the
issue that we raise in this case»

There is nothing in the

Opinion to suggest that this issue that we now raise was
ever briefed or fully considered by the Court in the Sanson®
case»

And beyond what is in the opinion, I do not know for

a fact what happened»
But that language is troublesome and 1 think at
least the apparent assumption that the word ‘'wilfully" meant
simply knowledge is contrary to a great deal of other law in
this area where -the word "wilfully," at least in the felony
sections, has been held to involve not only knowledge or

37

deliberate action, intentional, action, but also this
additional state of mind which involves a bad purpose or an
evil motive,
I think that it is quite apparent that the law on
this point badly needs to be clarified,
Q

Do you think it can foe clarified much beyond

what was said in that case several years ago, Spies?

Like

you, I do not know how these people pronounce their own
names,
MR, JOHNSTONs

I think it badly needs to foe

clarified, Mr, Justice,
Q

The point is wilfulness may mean a variety of

different tilings, depending on its context, and that is about
all you can,say, is it not?
MR. JOHNSTON:

Here, Mr, Justice, we have the

precise question, as to what it means in these two particular
sections, and I think at least it has to foe clarified to that
extent.
We feel that the Spies case helps us because in
Spies the Court held that it would not reasonably conclude
that the commission of a misdemeanor of failure to file,
plus the misdemeanor of failure to pay, together without
anything more, constituted a felony of wilfu31 attempt to
evade or defeat.

And the Court went on then to speak not in

terms of the meaning of wilful1 but in terms of the meaning of

38
a wilful! attempt, and I emphasize the word “attempt/’
because the real holding of the Spies case is that in
addition to a wilfull failure to file and a wilfull failure
to pay, both of which are misdemeanors, there must be some
further act, some affirmative act, which meets the Court's
definition of a wilfull attempt»
In most of the cases that we have, that wilfull
attempt consists in filing a false tax return.

That is the

act,
Q

Sometimes wilfull can just mean purposeful

or not, accidental, and other times it imports mens rea»

It

always depends on the context, does it not?
MR. JOHNSTON;

I think that is correct, Mr, Justice.

And, of course, our argument to the Court is that if means
different things in the misdemeanor from what it means in the
felony section*, and that only by giving it a different meaning
can the Court really rationalise these sections.
Q

How about Berra?

There was a misdemeanor

statute end a felony statute that everybody seemed to agree
covered exactly the same thing.
MR» JOHNSTON:
Q

That was the Court's holding.

That is right.

MR. JOHNSTON:

For that reason the Court said in

that case the taxpayer was not entitled to a lesser included
offense instruction.

But then the next year in Achilli,

39
this Court held that the misdemeanor section that was involved
there» 3616(a) under the 1939 Cod©» actually did not apply
to income tax violations» and that holding was explained in
Sans one on -the ground in part that this Court would not
presume that Congress would enact two sections covering the
same area» one of which is a felony and one of which is a
misdemeanor.
And it was subsequent to Achilli# then# that that
section 'was re-enacted as 7207 in the 1954 Code.

And# although

one might have suspected at that point that it was a sort of
forgotten section# that somehow Congress was not really
focusing on it# it is important to know# I think# that the
section was subsequently amended by Congress in 1963.

7207

was amended by adding the entire second half of what now ■
appears in that section»

It was subsequently amended still

further by a further amendment to that portion of the
section.
So# it is definitely there.

It is definitely part

of some kind of a total system of sanctions—
Q

That was the section involved in Achilli?

MR. JOHNSTON:
involved, in Achilli»

It is the successor to the section,

It was changed by removing the language

about attempts to evade or defeat, which had originally
appeared in 3616(a).

So# that was taken out and then the

section was moved into the income tax sections where it now

is 1b the Code.

And in Sangone this Court held that it

•applied to income tax cases.
its applicability»

So, there is no question about

And the only question then is if both of

these sections prohibit the filing of false returns and make
criminal offenses of the filing of false returns, does the
word "wilfully" have an identical meaning in both sections?
And if it does not, if it means something less in the
misdemeanor than it does in the felony, then we say we were
entitled to have the instruction and the Ninth Circuit should
be affirmed regardless of whether this Court agrees with the
particular definition that the Ninth Circuit has given to the
word generally in tax misdemeanor sections•
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERi

I assume you have a- few

minutes left, Mr. Stone?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD B. STONE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. STONE?

Thank you, Mr, Chief Justice.

I have

nothing especially stew t© say except, that to sum up it seems
to me if there is, if 1 have perceived in the course of
respondent's counsel’s argument an underlying dissatisfaction
with the material involved in this case, is that which 1
anticipated, and it centers on the rather unsatisfactory and
illusory meaning of the word "wilfull" in the context of all
of these criminal tax statutes.
And it becomes especially difficult to pinpoint

41
precisely what Congress meant by the word 'VilfiilX" when we
deal like we do her® with two statutory provisions that define
the basic state of mind required to commit the offense
entirely apart from the use of the word "wilfully."
One of these statutes defines the basic state of
mind involved in the commission of the offense in terms of
lack of belief that the knowledge contained in the document
is true.

The other defines that state of mind in terms of a

knowledge of falsity of the underlying information.
I think that the likelihood is that the word
"wilfully" is probably close to superfluous in both of these
statutes since the underlying state of mind is defined.

But

the Court need not reach the metaphysical possibilities of
what wilfully can mean precisely in each of these contents,
it is sufficient for purposes of this argument to observe that
the basic • state of mind necessary to support the misdemeanor
is a more serious culpable standard, knowledge of falsity,
than is the stats of mind necessary to support the felony.
And 1 have yet to perceive either from respondent’s
presentation or from the Court of Appeals any possible way of
holding that lack of belief can be a greater culpable
standard in itself and imply a greater degree of wilfulness
than can knowledge of falsity.
I perceive in Mr. Justice Rehnquist's questions,
if Z am not mistaken« some possible attempt to focus the word

42
'’wilfully” not on that state of mind as described in the
statute but on the very act of delivery or act of making and
subscribing itself, and I cannot understand what might foe
involved in a distinction of that nature®

1 suppose it is

perfectly clear, with or without the word ’’wilfully," that
these statutes do not apply unless the defendant signed the
document consciously, voluntarily, and without coercion, or
that he submitted and filed the documents with a similar
voluntary state; but X would submit the basic state of mind
and intent reflected in these statutes is in the lack of
belief of truth required by the felony offense and the
knowledge of falsity required by the misdemeanor offense,
and that it cannot be said that the felony in that ca.se
requires a greater degree of wilfulness than the misdemeanor.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Thank you, gentlemen,

the ease is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 2:59 o'clock p.ra. the case was
submitted.]
