HR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

o»-J>

We will hear arguments

now in Number 71-858, Ricci against the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange and others.
Mr. Torshen.
ORAL ARGUMENT OP JEROME II. TORSHEN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. TORSHEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case involves the issue of primary; jurisdiction.

Specifically the issue is v?hether a complaint

alleging a group boycott to exclude a competitor from the
marketplace,

per se a violation of the Sherman Act,

brought against a commodity exchange, certain-of its officers,
a member and another individual must first be refez’red to the
Commodity Exchange Commission or to the Secretary of
Agriculture for decision or it may be referred to the
District Court, the Anti-Trust Court.
•Very briefly encapsulated, the facts are that
Petitioner purchased a membership on the Exchange, another
member claimed to be the owner of it.

It is alleged that

the other — the claimant induced the officers of the Exchange
to transfer the membership to a third party and as a result,
Petitioner was deprived of his trading privileges and
excluded from the marketplace willfully, knowingly and

maliciously as a result of the conspiracy between these
parties.
The history of the case} too* must be stated so
that we can get to the issues and clear away some of the
underbrush that appears in the brief.

In the District Court

this case arose on the pleadings and was resolved on motions
to dismiss for lack of jurisdictions specifically lack of
jurisdiction over the subject matter for the reason that the
anti-trust lav/s did not apply.
In the Court of Appeals* the court found unanimous!
that the complaint did allege a per se violation of the
Sherman Act and hence* on the pleadingss reversed the
District Court,

However., the court so responded without the

issue having been argued* briefed or raised at any time
during the proceedings

in a two to one opinion in both the

Doctrine of Primary Jurisdiction and directed that the case
be remanded to the District Court with directions that the
District Court state proceedings pending reference of the
matter to either the Commodity Exchange Commission and/or*
in the terms of the court* the Secretary of Agriculture.
■I mention those facts because we do have here a
case on the pleadings although depositions had been taken by
one side and are quoted in the briefs here by Respondent.
The deposition testimony is not properly a part of
the record and v/as rejected by the court below.

5
We think, your Honors, that the extension of the
Doctrine of Primary Jurisdiction in this case involving
commodities markets is particularly inappropriate, especially
with regard to this claim brought under the anti-trust laws
and particularly with regard to the policy in support of
private enforcement of anti-trust laws.
It may be well, in determining what the primary
jurisdiction — or jurisdiction, if you will, of the Secretary
of Agriculture is to determine what his powers are under the
Commodities Exchange Act.

First, the Act gives no exemption

from the anti-trust laws.

Secondly —

Q

Let’s assume a rule of the Exchange that it was

authorised to issue and which was not disapproved by the
Secretary.

Let us assume that one of those rules, in anybody’s

parlance, would be a violation of the anti-trust laws.
MR. TORSHEN:

Well, I think :lf a rule would be a

violation of the anti-trust laws, I suppose that could be
attacked.

Here, of course, ^^e are not —
Q

You would not say that Congress intended that

any rule that the Secretary didn’t disprove should be immune
from anti-trust attack?
MR. TORSHEN;
Q

Absolutely not.

I think you should be clear about that.

MR. TORSHEN:

The mere disapproval should not

the mere failure to disapprove should not render —

—

6
Q

But that is the scheme under this act.

They

submit the rules and if the Secretary does not disapprove
them, the rules are enforced, isn't it?
MR. TORSHEN:
and terms and
Q

With regard to trading requirements

conditions of contracts, this is the case.
Well, let’s just assume one of the rules

about trading requirements otherwise would violate the
anti-trust lav/s.

Would that rule be vulnerable?

MR. TORSHEN:
Q

Yes.

Okay.

MR. TORSHEN:

We would think that it is.

Yes,

your Honor.
Here we are not attacking any rule of the
exchange.

The allegations are that the actions of the

exchange in concert with the member — and, again, we are
not talking about the generalised action of the exchange
as a concert of Its memberships but the action of the exchange
and a member in specific violation of the rule constituted a
violation of the anti-trust laws and If we examine the
statutory scheme to see what the Secretary of Agriculture
can do in addition to thi3 ability if he so sees fit to
disapprove, certain rules pertaining to trading or terms and
conditions of contract, he can conduct investigations, make
reports, obtain registrations, approve certain rules
relating to minimum financial requirements, hold hearings

7
with regard to manipulations of future prices, false
statements and CEA violations.

He can suspend from trading

and he can report for criminal prosecution violations of the
act, although it is specifically provided that he need not
report what he considers to be minor violations of the act.,
Certainly, here, what we have on the part of the
regulatory officer is a generalized supervisory power to
guard against certain trading abuses, not the power to set
up or to establish any overall scheme or plan or even to
enforce or protect against violations of those rules which
are set up.

It is a very generalised type of system and there

is nothing in the character and objectives of the act which
is incompatible with the maintenance of a private anti-trust
action or those sorts of violations that are alleged in this
particular complaint.
There is nothing in the regulatory scheme which
might enable the Secretary of Agriculture or the Commodities
Exchange Commission, which is sort of ah ephemeral body
composed of the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of
Agriculture and the Attorney General or their representatives
with power which in any way gives them power to enforce or
to consider anti-trust objectives or anti-trust claims.
The court over the years has developed a number of
standards or tests relating to the Doctrine of Primary
Jurisdiction.

Granted, it is a flex.ible concept and no

8
particular rule can be applied in any given case but there
are standards which the cases have developed,

There is a

requirement of a pervasive regulatory scheme and I think here
we do not have such a pervasive regulatory scheme and the
court has been very careful to delineate an exemption from
the anti-trust lav/ either specifically stated in the
regulatory statute or implied therein and we have no such
exemption stated in this statute nor in.this general
supervisory scheme to perhaps protect somewhat; against
cornering and' manipulation do we have an Implied examption
and it is interesting to note in this regard what reference
can be made to the legislative history.

The Commodities

Exchange Act and its predecessors were both drafted by
Congresses which were well aware of anti-trust laws and
anti-trust implications.

The predecessors came about during

the debates on the Capper-Volstead Act in

whioKithere were

specific anti-trust exemptions and the present Commodities
•

:

-«’

Exchange Act was enacted by the Congress and debated contemporaneously with the Robinson-Patman 'Act-.'

So certainlys

here, we are dealing with statutes which were well aware of
the anti-trust laws and the.se statutes give neither to the
Secretary of Agriculture or to any ether body the power to
ehgrant an immunity from the anti-trust law or to enforce
that immunity nor do they give a mechanism to redress a
violation or to determine issues vzhich might be brought under

the anti-trust laws.
In fact, it is interesting to note that under the
act, if Petitioner felt himself aggrieved, he could bring a
complaint before the Secretary of Agriculture but he would
not have standing unless he was given the right -to intervene
to appear in support of that complaint.
Moreover, vie have no conduct such as we find in
some of the other cases dealing with primary jurisdiction
which is of at least deb ate able legality which, can be
justified with reference to some broad plans set down by the
agency or by agency action .or by the need within the
•

«*.. ■

particular industry for some sort of non-competitive action
imposed upon the members of the industry by the agency.

We

just don’t have it here.
Moreover, action in this ad hoc situation by the
district court acting as an anti-trust court .cannot in any
way disrupt the administration of the Commodities Exchange
Act or impinge upon the regulation of this contract market.
We have here an ad hoc decision which we ask to
be made in connection with particular facts relating to this
i:

mile.

There Is no question of uniformity of agency

We are dealing with a past violation.
Incidentally, it is Interesting to note that with

regard to the powers of the agency in this case to give
redress for wrongs to individuals, there are none.

The

10
agency can issue a cease and desist order.
from trading.

It can suspend

It can apply various similar sanctions or it

can refer to the Attorney General for prosecution of a crime.
But it cannot give the particular remedy of damages which
might redress a private wrong and in this particular case
when we are dealing with the resolution of-a fact controversy
in the application of the anti-trust laws, there is nothing
in the history or in the records or in common, sense which
might give to the agency a greater expertise than the anti­
trust court in deciding these issues and it is ironic to
note, I think here, as we stand before this

Court, that

even though people do not like to make work for themselves,
agencies are generally jealous of their prerogatives and
their powers and we don't see the Secretary of Agriculture
here and the only member of the trlumverate-that we do see
here that is a member of the Commodities Exchange Commission
is the

Attorney General, who has filed his brief in support

of Petitioner’s claim, as an Amicus.
Again, we are not making an attack on the rules.
We think the rules have been violated and they have been
violated by the Exchange acting with one of

members, not

just because of generalised conduct of the Exchange.
We think, your Honors, that there Is no good
policy reason that might protect this sort of anti­
competitive behavior or to be used to permit the exchange

machinery to be used to suppress competition on the exchange.
We think we have nothing more here than a garden
variety conspiracy to exclude a member from the market.

Agains

referring to Silver- and the footnote in the dissent by
Mr. Justice Stewart, we are dealing with a specific act of a
member of the exchange9 setting up an independent.violation
of the anti-trust laws as distinguished from the generalised
conduct.
We think this Court, over the years, has
considered the policy of private anti-trust enforcement to
be an important one.

Certainly here it would not surprise

me if the Secretary of Agriculture were to say that this
conduct with regard to Petitioner was a minor violation of
the exchange.

I don’t think that it rests upon.the
• *

government or governmental bodies to seek redress for every
anti-trust wrong,

I think that is why it has been left to

private parties and here we have a case in Which there is a
good example of the private party seeking redress and
seeking enforcement of the anti-trust laws in an area where
.

only he can seek redress.

We think the action of the court jbelowy of the
Court of-Appeals9 in limiting, in seeking to limit treble
damage action, or to delay that action over a period of time
really does not accomplish the purposes of the anti-trust
laws.

It certainly does not advance the cause of justice in

12
this case and in all due conscience and propriety we think
that the Doctrine of Primary Jurisdiction, the Doctrine of
Judicial Modesty, should not be applied in this case.
Thank you.

This was expressed in

Bank and in Carnation Milk and in Silver, a

decision to which I will more fully refer.
The important point in this Instance is that we
don't seek exemption from the antitrust laws.

We seek, and

the Seventh Cirucit did order., a judicial abstention until
the administrative agencies had an opportunity to determine

13
whether or not there was compliance with this particular
Exchange, with its rules and with the regulatory system
established.
Q

Do' you agree with your friend that.,, the agency

cannot give any monetary redress or not?
MR. FREEMAN:

Number one, the Exchange, if I may

answer your question obliquely, the Exchange itself has a
great many self-regulatory rules which involve penalties •
and monetary redress.

The agency, the administrative agency,

does not have the power to award damages but as this Court
• ... V ; V

said in PanAmerican, if the regulatory system is sufficiently
comprehensive and if it deals with the issues that are
■

j

involved, the fact of an absence of remedy or full remedy
in that instance did not violate the need for a primary
jurisdiction resort and, in that case, Justice Douglas did
so hold and there have been several decisions since then.
But let me just briefly, if I may, indicate the
scope and character of the commodity futures regulatory
system.

It involves an important segment of our economy.

It becomes the

hour, from minute to minute are the prices at which the
farmers 3ell their product in the country.

The processors

and exporters pay for their product and the consumers also

pay

for it.

The principal feature of this regulatory

system is self-regulation by the Exchange, mandated by
Congress.
This is an important difference from every other
regulatory system that this Court has considered in
determining primary jurisdiction, except the Silver case
where, also, a self-regulatory system was mandated by
Congress with respect to the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
Q

What v;a3 there that the Commodity Exchange

Commission could decide would in any way help this antitrust
bid?
MR. FREEMAN:

Thank you, Justice Marshall, I v/as

going to answer Justice White's Inquiry.
The Commodities Exchange Authority has delegated to
the agency and to the Exchange

almost complete authority

to deal with all of the antitrust problems that might be

competition or even a per se, what would normally be a per se
antitrust violation, it would be justified and it would be
immunised.

Q

Where Is your primary jurisdiction if it

MR. FREEMAN:

Well, your Honor, the systera that has

been established here — and 1 might say that I want to
answer your question directly — Silver, you see, found that
the Securities and Exchange Commission did not have the
statutory power to review particular instances of enforce­
ment of

Exchange rules.
In 1968, Congress amended the Commodities Exchange

Act.

The Commodities Exchange Act, incidentally, was

enacted in 1922.
Exchange Act.

It was the forerunner of the Securities and

It was the pioneer of marketing devices that

were introduced then and were ultimately adopted by the
Securities Exchange Act and the Commission and in 1968 in
view of Silver, which had been announced severa], years prior,
the statute was amended, number one, to

specifically stand

for Secretary and the administrative agency, the power to
disapprove rules that were adopted and promulgated by the
agency — by the Exchange.
Secondly, and most Important, to impose a duty upon
the Exchange to enforce those rules.
And, thirdly, to require, with you, of the enforce­
ment of those rules by the administrative agency and In the
event of failure of the enforcement, to
action,

provoke disciplinary

This disciplinary action could take the form of a

17
cease and desist order, suspension as a designated contract
market on which futures trading only can be legally performed,
or revocation.
Q

Now, the primary jurisdiction —
Or damages?

MR. FREEMAN:

No damages.

But you see, in the

Silver case, the Court recognized that there was not this
agency review.

The Court as a matter of fact spoke

specifically about seeking an antitrust function to be
performed either by the administrative agency in review of
the Exchange's functions or by the Court.

Falling to find

administrative review, the Court then turned to the antitrust
laws but was quick to say that s. different case would occur
if agency review was found and also said, your?Honor, that in
the event the agency review occurred, the Court would find
that under the aegis of the rule of reason the Exchange would
have sufficient breathing spell or breathing space to function
as a self-regulatory agency in a very Important field and
avoid the implications of antitrust claims.
The functions that the Commodities Exchange Authority

r-r-

if

•Exchange — performed are very, very Important and, as I was
pointing out, they do have the functions of avoiding pricefixing, of avoiding restraints of trade» of avoiding
monopolization because of this obligation to avoid corners
of the market.

There are specific provisions in the act

3.8

providing for the prevention and prohibition of- unfair methods
of competition and of predatory practices.

There are specific

provisions in the act permitting the Exchange to 'pass rules
that limit competition.

For example, the Exchange and the

agency causes a cessation of futures trading for a period of
time

in the contract month to permit delivery of the cash

commodity.
This is an imposition, a restraint on competition.
Secondly, as I pointed out, there is this provision
that the Exchange has always had, a hundred years of limiting
the fluctuation of prices on a daily basis.

This, in the

parlance of antitrust, is a per ae violation but completely
justified.

The Exchange does provide for hours of trade,

time of trade, manner of trading in futures contracts, and all
to assure that a free acution market Is maintained where the
quoted prices truly reflect the competing, contending,
conflicting opinions of traders based upon informed judgment
on economic factors that are reasonably presented in a very
complex, a very complex and dynamic marketing situation.
Q

Now to help me out, would you relate —

are all of these Exchange provisions.

And then if the

Exchange decides wrongly, there is the administrative review

20
and. the Commission and there is judicial review from the
Commission.
There is a system established and the system has
worked very well for these 50 to 100 years and the antitrust
issues that have been inherent in the system; for example,
you must decide that the Exchange has the power to pass a
rule which, in the orthodox sense, might be restrictive of
competition, because if you don’t, then you are completely
rejecting the Congressional mandate that this should be a
free and an open auction market which will-avoid- sudden and
violent fluctuations in prices where you are dealing with
traders on a daily and almost-momentary basis and let me
tell you about the regulation that —
Q

Well,

you don’t want us to go any farther

than Silver, do you?
MR. FREEMAN:

No, X want you to apply Silver here.

Silver — the dictates of Silver — of course, the primary
jurisdiction issue was not reached in Silver and it was not
reached in Silver because —
Q

Yes, but Silver said that to the extent some

rules are necessary to carry out the objectives of the act,
that should be a decent answer to an antitrust case.
MR. FREEMAN:

Of course, and that is all I would

suggest and, as a matter of fact, I am — I feel that
Justice Stewart, in his dissenting opinion in Silver, which

21
was referred to by my colleague — Justice Stewart quite
properly points out that there must be a delicate balance,
that the Court is anxious for this mandated self-regulatory
agency, the balance between fulfilling, the responsibility of
self-regulation x^rhich is an onerous and daily duty unhindered
by the harassment of antitrust claims at every step of the
way, subject, however, to redress if it is derelict in its
duties and the rule being that if it acts in a good faith
or bona fide manner in fulfillment of its

self-regulatory

duties, it should have come — it should have immunity from
the antitrust laws.

There is — you should apply the rule of

reason.
For instance. Justice Brandeis, in a case about 50
years ago, Board of Trade versus United States, found that
an exchange that had imposed a restriction on buying
or selling at above a certain price after the market closed,
lie found that that was

a reasonable regulation of

competition vihich actually promoted competition in the sense
of maintaining an open acution market.
With respect to Silver, I again emphasize that in
Silver, first the Court — for the first time, had before it
a self-regulating, markefcixig system.

The Securities and

Exchange Act which is quite parallel to the Commodities
Exchange Act and, as I say, the Commodities Exchange
was the forerunner of it and was copied.

Act

In Silver, the

22
Court recognized that if there was a case for agency review,
that this would dispense with the necessity of antitrust
courts involvement subject always to the fact that If there
was some area that went beyond merely the concerted action
of the Exchange within the bona fide and good faith operation
of

its self-regulatory duties, if there was some charge or

some action beyond that, sure, it is subject to the antitrust
laws and if there was a remedy

~~ the damages issue that

your Honors have raised —• if there was a remedy that the
agency could not grant after the agency had determined that
there were violations here, that there wera violations of
the rules or violations of antitrust principles that were not
covered by a good faith compliance with self-regulatory
duties, then the case should go back to the court — to the
antitrust court — for the administration of that remedy.
And the Seventh Circuit, I think, very closely
followed the Silver dictates by providing for a stay of the
District Court’s proceedings until the agency had completed
its determination and the agency hare is in daily contact
with the Exchange.

We have two or three investigators on

our floor every day,, all the time.

We are constantly subject

to reporting and investigating process.

And the Exchange

has a whole staff, which we call the ’’Department of
Investigation and Audits” which is constantly involved in
the marketing process.

23

It ia a delicate process.

It is a

subtle process.

It is not necessary to secure a price quote that does truly
reflect the competing opinions on economic supply and demand
factors rather than some arbitrary factor.

And arbitrary

factors have a way of entering into the marketplace from
time to time and all of this function is performed through
7

our members and therefore, the Ricci problem,
is not that important.

The agency is always subject; to

Hi

Let me just point to the dilemma that faces the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange right now-

In the last several

years, two or three years, we have been subjected to possibly

some for antitrust violations.

Seventh Circuit I think highlight v/hat I would'like to
emphasise.
In one case, the Exchange’s investigative staff
v/atchad the trading in a particular commodity and at the
end of the contract month instituted proceedings —

24
disciplinary proceedings — made charges of manipulation of
the market and violation of its rules against a series of
members.

There were six weeks of hearings before the full

12-man board of governors that we have and everyone attended
for six weeks.

Wien we got through, we imposed the severest

penalties in the history of regulation of the Exchanges*
Yet, we are subject to a lav; suit in the District
Court for having violated our rules on the antitrust laws.
Take the other side of the coin, another case
pending in the Seventh Circuit.

In this particular instance,

another commodity and another time, in the midst of trading,
we found a very large concentration of position growing up
which would have distorted price quotations which have
prevented this market (from) operating properly.
So the board entered an order requiring liquidation
of position, a divestiture of interest, in the antitrust
terms, liquidation of position.

It was a proper move, we

It did result in the market orderly liquidation.

Ho violent price fluctuations occurred.

But'we-ape subject

to an antitrust suit there, both cases pending in the
Seventh Circuit and we refer to them in our brief,
Nov;, the Commodities Exchange Authority and the
Secretary of Agriculture and the Commission are on our backs
all the time with respect to all of these operations.

They

are constantly urging us to deal promptly, vigorously, with

25
any Instance of market disturbance but when we do, we are
damned and when wa don’t we are damned and this is the
dilemma that faces us if we are subject to constantly
harassing antitrust cases.
Now, this Court has an opportunity of providing us
with a principle that will permit us vigorous

self-

regulatory powers and duties and functions and yet subject
us to whatever penalties are necessary because of any
Exchange dereliction.

We don’t profess to be perfect and the

system is not perfect, but it has worked and it has worked
well and these — now, injections of antitrust attack and
in this instance with a complaint that is demonstrably false
on the basis of depositions that were taken by both sides,
not one side; depositions that were taken by both sides and
presented to the District Court by both sides in their briefs
which demonstrate that there was notice to this-, individual,
that there was an attempt to arbitrate and there -was no
denial.
Q

It has been my understanding that the District

Court disregarded those depositions and that, therefore, the
Court of Appeals also did and took the allegation of the
complaint as though true.
MH. FREEMAN:

Your Honor, I am forced to say that

this particular District Court, you would have great difficul
ty understanding what the judge was doing, but I cited to a

26
transcript which indicates that he did take it into effect.
The important point is that the briefs that were filed on
the motion to dismiss — and they were motions to dismiss,
not summary judgments — the briefs that were filed did, both
briefs, made mention of the depositions and he did dispose of
it and he asked us to file findings of fact, which we did,
which would have been under a motion for summary judgment,
then decided that he would just make an oral judgment on it.
Q

So I am not mistaken, then, in my under­

standing that the Court of Appeals, at least, understood
that he did not take into consideration the depositions?
I«!R. FREEMAN:

The Court of Appeals read the same

transcript and said that they didn't belie\»-e — they found
that he did not take into account anything beyond a motion
to dismiss.
.

Q

.

V

And it was a motion to dismiss, so therefore —

MR. FREEMAN:

And it was a motion to dismiss and

we haven't attacked the Court of Appeals7 decision.
• i
>
Q
— and therefore, even though you may be quite
right that this is a frivolous and wrong-headed lawsuit
with no merit to it, nonetheless, in the posture of the case
here, we have to take the allegations of the complaint as
though true, don’t we?
MR. FREEMAN:

And if you take the allegations of

the complaint as true , you will find that there is an

27

indication that notice of the exchange action did occur but
there is also the weasel expression that they didn’t get
notice of the transfer to John Reich.

Well* John Reich is

somebody nobody knows and maybe they didn’t get notice of
the transfer to him but they were notified that the transfer
issue was before the board and that is why they came up with
an attempt to revoke that authorisation.
Q

Well, let me put it this way.

Do you deny

that the allegations of the complaint, just reading them,
state a colorable cause of action under the antitrust laws?
MR. FREEMAN;

Yes, I do deny it because I feel that

the allegations of the complaint are merely conclusory
allegations in an attempt to get to a federal court instead
of a state court where there may have.been a commercial
dispute between these two parties which could have been
answered in a state court but, instead, they added a few
words of willful conspiracy and so on and my colleague here,
in presenting his case quite properly pointed out, all it was
is a dispute between his client and the otherfclient and we
in
Cf
decided it, and/every decision that the Exchange makes, there
has got to be a losing party who can contend that we were
conspiring with the other side in violation of the antitrust
laws.
Q

Well, as I understand it,

you think the Court

of Appeals was wrong in holding that the complaint

did

28
allege a cause of action under the antlturst laws and that —
MR. FREEMAN:
Q

I think —

—- and that the District Court was — the

Court of Appeals should simply have affirmed the dismissal
by the District Court.
MR. FREEMAN:

I think the Court of Appeals was

wrong, first, in finding that the complaint stated the proper
course of action and, secondly, in not finding that the
matter was handled by the District

Court as a motion for

summary judgment,
Q

Yes, but Mr. Freeman, let us assume that we

disagree with you on that.

Do you think you have lost your

case?
MR. FREEMAN:
Q

No.

No.

1 — I —

I would suppose that if you take the complaint

as true it also states that the rules of the Exchange vjere
violated.
MR. FREEMAN:
Q

The — the —

Because if the rules of the Exchange were

violated, there is an agency to present a complaint to,
isn't there?
,

MR. FREEMAN:

Yes, your Honor.

i

Q

Which is different than Silver.

There was no

place you could go in Silver.
MR. FREEMAN:

No place in Silver, a place here and

29
I -- 3: would — I mean,, I think that the issue of primary
jurisdiction should be decided by this Court rather than to
throw this matter out as a frivolous complaint.

I think the

issue is presented and we must assume that the Court of
Appeals •— because that issue has not been disputed here
that the Court of Appeals has decided that the complaint does
state an antitrust violation and you must come to grips with
the problem of whether or not the agency should review to
determine that the Exchange was acting in good —

Wellj, the Court of Appeals said It stated a

good cause of action and it also said it stated a violation

Thank you, Mr. Freeman.

Mr-, Tdrshen, do you have anything further?
MR. TORSHEN:

I don't think that a reply is

Thank you, gentlemen.
