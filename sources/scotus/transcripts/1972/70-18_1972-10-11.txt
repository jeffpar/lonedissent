MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear argument

Mrs. Weddington, you may proceed whenever you’re

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. SARAH R. WEDDINGTONf
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MRS. WEDDINGTON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
We are once again before this Court to ask relief
against the continued enforcement of the Texas abortion
statute.

And I ask that you affirm the ruling of the three-

judge below which held our statute unconstitutional for two
reasons:

The first that it was vague, and the second that it

interfered with the Ninth Amendment rights of a woman to
determine xtfhether or not she would continue or terminate a
pregnancy.
As you will recall, there are three plaintiffs and
*•

•

•..

\ y.

one intervener involved here.

The first plaintiff was Jane

Ro^, an unmarried, pregnant girl, who had sought an abortion
in the State of Texas and was denied it because of the Texas
abortion statute, which provides an abortion is lawful only
*
*
for the purpose of saving the life of the woman.
In the original action she was joined by a married
couple, John and Mary Doe.

Mrs. Doe had a medical condition.

her doctor had recommended, first, that she not get pregnant?
and, second, that she not take the pill.
After this cause was instituted, and after, in fact,
the three-judge court had been granted, those three plaintiffs
were joined by an intervenor, Dr.Hallford, who was, at the
time he intervened,

under a pending State criminal prosecution

under the statute.
He did not ask that his prosecution be stopped by
the court, but rather joined in the original request for a
declaratory judgment and injunctive relief against future
prosecution.
As a matter of fact, he fc*s not, his prosecution
has not been continued.

But the district attorney, against

whom we filed the suit, has taken a position that because
there was no injunction, he is still free to institute
prosecutions,
There is a letter from his office in the Appendis:
stating that he will continue prosecution, and in fact there
have been a very limited number of prosecutions in the State
of Tessas since the three-judge court entered its declaratory
judgment,
QUESTION*

Prosecutions of doctors, you’re speaking

of?
MRS. WBDDINGT023;

Prosecutions of doctors, yes, sir,

Th© problem that we face in Texas is that even

s
though we were granted a declaratory judgment, ruling the
law unconstitutional, even though we've been before this
Court once in the past, in Texas women still are not able to
receive abortions from licensed doctors, because doctors still
fear that they will be prosecuted under the statute.
So if the declaratory judgment x*as any relief at
all, it was an almost meaningful relief, because the women of
Tanas still zirast either travel to other States, if they are
that sophisticated and can afford it, or they must resort to
some other less ~ some other very undesirable alternatives,
QUESTIONi

You said "meaningful", you meant

"meaningless", didn’t you?
MRS. WEDDXNGTON:

Yes, it's just —.

In fact, we pointed out in our supplemental brief
filed here that there have been something like 1600 Texas
women who have gone to New York City alone for abortions
in the first nine months of 1971.
In addition, I think the Court would recognize
there are many other women going to other parts of the
country.
One of the objections that our opponents have
raised, the same in this Court, is moot, because, of course,
the woman is no longer pregnant.

It's been almost three

years since we instituted the original action.
And yet we can certainly show that it is a

6

continuing problem to Texas women.
pregnancies.

There still are unwanted

There are still women who, for various reasons,

do not wish to continue the pregnancy, whether because of
personal health considerations, whether because of their
family situation, whether because of financial situations,
education, working situations, some of the many things we
discussed at the last hearing.
Since the last hearing before this Court there
have been a few cases decided that we wanted to draw the
Court's attention to, and are covered in our supplemental
brief.
In addition, there is a supplemental brief filed
by an amicus party, Harriet Pilpel, on behalf of Planned
Parenthood of New York, that seeks to point out to the Court,
at pages 6 and 7 and subsequent pages, some of the changing
medical statistics available regarding the procedure of
abortion.
For example, that brief points out that the over-all
material death rate from legal abortion in New York dropped to
3.7 per 100,000 abortions in the last half of 1971.

And that

that, in fact, is less than half the death rate associated
with live delivery for women.
That, in fact, the maternal mortality rate has
decreased by about two-thirds to a record low in New York
in 1971.

That now, in 1971, New York recorded the lowest

infant mortality rate ever in that State.

That during the

first 18 months of — wall, from July 1st*, 1970, to December
31st, 1971, out-of“wedlock pregnancies have dropped by 14
parcent.
We now have other statistics coming from California
and other States that show that not only has the over-all birth
rate declined, but the welfare birth rate has also declined
accordingly.
As to the women, this is their only forum.

They

are in a very unique situation, for several reasons:

First,

because of the very nature of the interest involved.

Their

primary interest being the interest associated with the
question of whether or not they will be forced by the State
to continue an unwanted pregnancy.
In our original brief we alleged a number of
constitutional grounds.

The man on© that we are relying on

before this Court are the Fifth, the Ninth, and the
Fourteenth Amendments.
There is a great body of precedents.

Certainly

we cannot say that there is in the Constitution, so stated,
the right to an abortion.

Neither is there stated the right

to travel, or some of the other very basic rights that this
Court has held are under the United States Constitution*
The Court has in the past, for example, held that
it is the right of the parents and of the individual to

/

8
determine whether or not they will send their child to
private school, whether or not their children will be taught
foreign languages, whether or not they will have offspring, the
Skinner case, whether — the right to determine for themselves
whom they will marry, the Loving case, and even in Boddie vs.
Connecticut, the choice of saying that marriage itself is so
important that the State cannot interfere with termination
of a marriage, just because the woman is unable to pay the
cost.
Griswold, of course, is the primary case,holding
that the State could not interfere in the question of whether
or not a married couple would use birth control; and since
then this Court, of course, has held that the individual
has the right to determine whether they are married or single,
whether they will use birth control.
So there is a great body of cases decided in the
past by this Court in the areas of marriage, sex, contraception,
propriation, child-bearing/ and education of children.

Which

says that there are certain things that are so much a part of
the individual concern that they should be left to the
determination of the individual.
One of the cases decided since our last argument
September 13th was the second Connecticut case, Abele vs.
Markle, which Judge —
QUESTION: Newman

9

MRS. WEDDINGTOH:
QUESTION:

Excuse me?

Newman» X think.

MRS. WEDDIMGTQNs

— Newman wrote the opinion, yes.

Thank you.
And Judge Lombard concurred.
In that case that three-judge court held the
Connecticut statute, a slightly revised statute, for the
second time to be unconstitutional.
In part of the language of that Case, it pointed
•y

.

..

out that no decision — and I'm quoting — of the Supreme
Court has ever permitted anyone's constitutional right to foe
directly abridged to protect a State interest which is subject
to such a variety of personal judgments.

And certainly the

amicus briefs before the Court show the variety of personal
judgments..that come to bear on this particular situation.
To uphold such a statute, the Court said, would be
* I.

to permit the State to impose its view of the nature of a fetus
upon those who had the constitutional right to base an
P•

• '

V: K

-

i ,?*

important decision in their personal lives upon a different
view.
Again, this is a very special type case for the
women, because of the very nature of the injury involved.
It is an irreparable injury.

Once pregnancy has started,

certainly this is not the kind of injury that can be later
adjudicated, it is not the kind of injury that can later be

10
compensated by some sort of monetary reward.
These women who have now gone through pregnancy and
the women who continue to be forced through pregnancy have
certainly gone through something that is irreparable, that
can never be changed for them.

It is certainly great and it

is certainly immediate.
There is no other forum available to them, as we
talked last time, they are not subject in Texas to any kind
of criminal prosecution, whether fch© woman performs selfabortion, whether she goes to a doctor, finds someone who v;ill
perform it on haz, she is guilty of no crime whatsoever.
.&nd yet the State tries to allege that its purpose in this
statute was to protect the fetus.
If that’s true, the fact that the woman is guilty
of no crime is not a seasonable kind of — it does not
reasonably follow.
The women are not able to have any kind of
declaratory judgment in Texas, because of our special
declaratory judgment statutes in our concurring criminal and
civil courts, the two different lines of cases that we have.
So the federal court was the only court to which the women
had

any

kind of access, and it was to the federal courts they

came, and it’s the federal court, in my judgment, that should
determine this case.
It's a very unique kind of harm, certainly, that was

11
done to 'them»

Even though there are many cases# some very

recent# from this Court# talking about the problem of when a
State may interfere# or the federal judiciary may interfere
when there is a pending State criminal prosecution.
This case does come under the exceptions in that
there is great, immediate# irreparable injury, where there is
no other form# it is something that# as far as these women
are concerned, can never be adjudicated in a criminal
prosecution# much less in a single criminal prosecution.
It certainly is an instance of a situation that is
capable of repetition# yet evading review.

The judiciary

simply does* not move fast enough for the case to be decided
within the period of gestation# much less within the period
within which an abortion would be medically safe for these
women.
The State has alleged# and its only alleged interest
in this statute is the interest in protecting the life of
the unborn.

However# the State has not been able to point

to any authority# of any nature whatsoever, that would
demonstrate that this statute was in fact adopted for that
purpose.
We have some indication that other State statutes
were adopted for the purpose of protecting the health of the
woman.

We have an 1880 case in Texas# shortly after the 1334

statute was adopted# that states that the women is the victim

12
of the crime, and is the only victim that the court talks
about.
We have all the contradictions in the statute, and
the way so many things that just don’t make sense.

If the

statute was adopted for that purpose, for example, why is
the woman guilty of no crime?

If the statute was adopted for

that purpose, why is it that the penalty for abortion is
determined by whether or not you have the woman's consent?
QUESTION:

Regardless of the purpose for which the

statute t*as originally enacted , or the purpose which keeps it
on the books in Texas today,, you would agree, I suppose, that
one of the important factors that has to be considered in
this case is what rights, if any, does the unborn fetus have?
MRS. WEDDXNGTON:

That’s correct.

There have been two cases decided sine© the
September 13th argument that expressly hold that a fetus
has no constitutional right, one being Byrn vs. New York,
the other being the Magee-Women*s Hospital case.

In both

situations persons sought to bring that very question to the
court:

does a fetus — in the one instance, Byrn was a

challenge to the New York Revised Statutes? the other was a
situation where a person sought to prevent Magee-Women's
Hospital from allowing further abortions to be done in that
hospital.

And in both cases it was held that the fetus had

13
no constitutional rights»
Several of the briefs before this Court would also
argue that this Court? in deciding the Vuitch case? which
has allowed abortions to continue in the District of
Columbia? certainly the Court would net have made that kind
of decision if it felt there were any ingrained rights of
the fetus within the Constitution»
There is also? of course? —
QUESTION;

Well? is it critical to your case that

the fetus not be a person under the due process clause?
MRS. WEDDINGTON:

It seems to me that it is critical?

first? that we prove this is a fundamental interest on behalf
of the woman? that it is a constitutional right.
QUESTION;

And second —

Well? yes? but hoi? about the fetus?

MRS. WEDDINGTON;

Okay.

And second? that the State

has no compelling State interest.
And the State is alleging a compelling State interest
in *—
QUESTION:
federal Constitution.

Yes? but I'm just asking you? under the
Is the fetus a person for the protection

of due process?
MRS. WEDDINGTON:

All of the cases, the prior

history of this statute? the common law history would indicate
that it ie not.

The State has shown no —

QUESTIONs

Well? what about — would you lose your

14

case if the fetus was a person?
MRS« WEDDINGTON :

Then you would have a balancing

of interest.
QUESTIONS Well, you say you have, anyway, don't you?
MRS. WEDDINGTON*
QUESTIONS

Excuse me?

Yon have, anyway, don't you?

You're

going to be balancing the rights of the mother against the
rights of the fetus.
MRS. WEDDINGTONs

It seems to me that you do not

balance constitutional rights of one person against mere
statutory rights of another.
QUESTIONs

You think a State interest, if it's only

a statutory interest or a constitutional interest, under the
State law, can never outweigh a constitutional right?
MRS. WEDDINGTONs

I think —- it would seem to me

th&t —
QUESTION!

So all th© talk of compelling Stats

interest is beside the point.

It can never be compelling

enough.
MRS. WEDDINGTON:

If the State could show that th©

fetus was a person under the Fourteenth Amendment, or under
\

some other Amendment, or part of the Constitution, then
you would have the situation of trying ~~ you would have a
State compelling interest which, in some instances, can
outweigh a fundamental right.

This is not the case in this

15
particular situation.
QUESTION:

Do you make any distinction between the

first month and ninth month of gestation?
MRS. WEDDINGTONs
QUESTIONs Do you?

Our statute does not.
In your position in this case.

MRS. WEDDIMGTON: We are asking in this case that
the Court declare the statute unconstitutional, th© State
having proved no compelling interest at all.
There are some STates that now have adopted time
limits.

Those have not yet been challenged, and perhaps

that question will be before this Court.
Even those statutes, though, allow exceptions —
well, New York, for example, says an abortion is lav/ful up
to 24 weeks.

But even after the 24 weeks it is still

lawful, where there’s rape or incest, where the mother’s
mental or physical health is involved.

In other words, even

after that period it’s not a hard-and-fast cutoff.
QUESTION:

Then it's the weighing process that Mr.

Justice White was referring to, is that your position?
MRS. WEDDXNGTON:

The Legislature in that situation

engaged in the weighing process, and it seems to me that it
has not yet been determined whether the State has the
compelling interest to uphold even that kind of relation,
but that’s really not before the Court in this particular
case

16
We have no time limit, there is no indication in
Texas that any would be applied at any future date.

You know,

we just don’t know that. But —
QUESTION;

Mrs. Weddington, you're attacking the

statute on two grounds, are you not, vagueness—
MRS. WEDDINGTON:
QUESTION;

That's correct.

— and the Ninth Amendment.

Do you base

any weight on one argument as against the other?
MRS. WEDDINGTON:

Our Texas Court of Criminal Appeals,

in Thompson vs» State, •—
QUESTION: That's a recent case?
MRS. WEDDINGTON:

Yes.

In November of last year.

QUESTION: Again on vagueness.
MRS. WEDDINGTON:

Yes.

That particular case held

that the Texas statute was not vague, citing Vuitch»
It's my opinion that that reliance was misplaced.

That in

Vuitch, this Court had before it the D. C. statute which
allowed abortion for the purpose of saving the life or the
health,, and this Court adopted the interpretation that health
meant both mental and physical health.
And it seemed to me the Court's language in that
case talked a great deal about the fact that the doctor's
judgment goes to saving the health of the woman, that that's
the kind of judgment he is used to making.
In Texas that's not the judgment he’s forced to make.

17
The judgment in Texas is, is this necessary for the purpose
of preserving the life of the woman.
statute has never been interpreted.

And the language of that
That's not the kind of

judgment that a doctor is accustomed or perhaps even able to
make.
QUESTION; Well, I go back to ray question;
MRS. WEDDINGTON:

Are you -

I still continue the argument

that the Texas case is vague.
QUESTION;

So you're relying on both?

MRS. WEDDINGTON;
QUESTION;

Yes, we are. Your Honor.

Now, you referred a little bit to

history, and let me ask you a question —
MRS. WEDDINGTON:
QUESTION:

Okay.

— based on history.

You’re familiar

with the Hippocratic oath?
MRS. WEDDINGTON;
QUESTION:

I am.

I think — I may have missed it, but X

find no reference to it in this — in your brief or in thfe
voluminous briefs that we're overwhelmed with here.

Do

you have any comment about the Hippocratic oath?
...

MRS. WEDDINGTON:
said.
change.

.

i

1 think two things could be

The first would be that situations and understandings
In this,case, for example, we have before the Court

a medical amicus brief that was joined by all the deans of
the public medical schools in Texas.

It was joined by

IS
numerous other professors of medicine.

It was joined by

the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,,
QUESTION:

Of course there are other briefs on the

other side joined by equally outstanding physicians.
MRS. WEDDXNGTQN:
QUESTION:

None of them has —

Tell me why you didn’t discuss the

Hippocratic oath.
MRS. WEDDXNGTON:

Okay.

I guess it was — okay — in part because the
Hippocratic oath, we discussed basically the constitutional
protection we felt the woman to have.

The Hippocratic

oath does not pertain to that.
Second, w© discuss the fact that the State had not
established a compelling State interest.
oath would not really pertain to that.

The Hippocratic
And then we discuss

the vagueness jurisdiction.
It seemed to us that the fact that the medical
profession at one time had adopted the Hippocratic oath does
not weigh upon the fundamental constitutional rights involved.
It is a guide for physicians, but the outstanding
organizations of the medical profession have in fact adopted
a position that says the doctor and the patient should be
able to make the decision for themselves in this kind of
situation.
QUESTION:

Of course it’s the only definitive

19
statement of ethics of the medical profession.

I take it

from what you said that you didn't even footnote it because
it’s old.

That’s about, really, what you’re saying.
MBS. WEDDINGTONs

Well, 1 guess it is old, and not

that it’s out of date, but that it seemed to us that it was
not pertinent to the argument we were making.
QUESTIONS

Let me ask another question, then.

Last June 2Sth. this Court decided the capital punishment
cases o
MRS. WEDDINGTON:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION: Do you feel that there is any inconsistency
in the Court's decision in those cases outlawing the death
penalty with respect to convicted murderers and rapists at
one end of life’s span, and your position in this case at the
other end of life's span?
MRS. WEDDINGTON:

I think, had there been established

that the fetus was a person under the Fourteenth Amendment or
under constitutional protection, then there might be a
differentiation.

In this case there has never been established

that the fetus is a person or that it's entitled to the
Fourteenth Amendment rights or the protection of the
Constitution.

It would be inconsistent to decide that after

birth various classifications of persons would be subject to
the death penalty or not.
But here we have a person, the woman, entitled to

20

fundamental constitutional rights as opposed to the fetus
prior to birth, where there is no establishment of any kind
of federal constitutional rights,
QUESTION; Well, do I get from this, than, that your
case depends primarily on the proposition that the fetus has
no constitutional rights?
MRS. WEDDINGTON:

It depends on saying that the

woman has a fundamental constitutional right and that the
Stats has not proved any compelling interest for regulation
in the area.
Even if the Court at some point determined the
fetus to be entitled to constitutional protection, you would
still got back into the weighing of one life against
another.
QUESTIONS That’s what’s involved in this case?
Weighing one life against another?
MRS. WEDDSKGTONs

No, Your Honor.

I say that would

bo what would be involved if the facts were different, and
the State could prove that there was a person, for the
constitutional right.
QUESTION:

Well, if — if — it were established

that an unborn fetus is a person within the protection
of the Fourteenth Amendment, you would have almost an
impossible case here, would you not?
MRS. WEDDINGTON:

I would have a very difficult

21
case.
QUESTION:

I'm sure you would.

So if you had the

same kind of thing, you'd have to say that this would be the
equivalent after the child was born if the mother thought it
bothered her health any having the child around, she could
have it killed.

Isn’t that correct?

MRS. «EDDINGTON: That's correct.
QUESTION:

That

Could Texas constitutionally — did you

want to respond further to Justice Stewart?
Did you want to respond further to him?
MRS. WEDDINGTON:
QUESTION:

No, Your Honor.

Could Texas constitutionally, in your

view, declare that, by statute, that the fetus is a person for
all constitutional purposes after the third month of
gestation?
MSS. WEDDINGTONs

I do not believe that the State

Legislature can determine the meaning of the federal
Constitution,

xt is up to this Court to make that determina­

tion .
QUESTION:

The States have to deal with statutes.

don’t they?
.

WEDDINGTON: The State could obviousiy adopt that

Kxnd or statute, and then the question would hwe to be
adjuorcatsd as to whether tor all purposes that statute is
c onstitutional.

22

We are not alleging that there cannot be some kind
of protection.

For example, the property rights, which, again,

are contingent upon being born alive.

It can be retroactive

to the period prior to birth.
But in this particular situation we are alleging
that this statute is unconstitutional.
QUESTION :

But that has been recognised in the

period before birth for purposes of injury claims, and you
put that, I take it, in the property category?
MRS. WEDDINGTON:
born alive.

In Texas it is only when they are

And the fact that there is a — yon know, the

wrongful conduct of another is not the same as in this
situation.

As for property rights, for example, there are

even property rights that relate back to prior to conception?
children that are not yet conceived, who later inherit.

But

that did not prevent this Court in Griswold from holding
people had the right to birth control»
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERS

Hr,Flowers.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT C. FLOWERS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR. FLOWERS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The lower court in Dallas held the Texas abortion
law unconstitutional primarily on the two grounds that have

23
just been discussed? on the vagueness question and the rights
of the mother under the Ninth Amendment,
The thrust of the whole argument of the State of
Texas is against the rights of the mother under the Ninth
Amendment, that it certainly is a balancing effect.

There

must be or, on the other side of the coin, Texas has no
State.
It is impossible for me to trace, within my
allocated time, the development of the fetus from the date
of conception to the date of its birth.

But it is the position

of the State of Texas that upon conception we have a human
being, a person within the concept of the Constitution of
the United States and that of Texas, also.
QUESTIONS

Now, how should that question be decided,

is it a legal question, a constitutional question, a medical
question, a philosophical question, or a religious question,
or what is it?
MR. FLOWERS:

Your Honor, we feel that it could be

best decided by a Legislature in view of the fact that they
can bring before it the medical testimony, the actual people
who do the research.
QUESTION:

But we do have —
So then it’s basically a medical

question?
MR. FLOWERS:
no, sir.

i

From a constitutional standpoint,

I think it’s fairly and squarely before this Court.

24
We don't envy the Court for having to make this decision.
QUESTION: Do you know of any case anywhere that's
held that an unborn fetus is a person within the meaning of
the Fourteenth Amendment?
MR. FLOWERS:

No, sir, we can only go back to what

the framers of our Constitution had in mind.
QUESTION: Well, these weren’t the framers that
wrote the Fourteenth Amendment.
MR. FLOWERS:

No, sir.

It came along much later.
I understand.

Fifth Amendment, under the Fifth Amendment:

But the

no one shall be

deprived of the right to life, liberty, and property without
the due process of law.
QUESTION:

Yes, but then the Fourteenth Amendment

defines ’'person58 as somebody who’s born, doesn’t it?
MR. FLOWERS:

I’m not sure about that, sir.

I —

QUESTION: All right.
Any person born or naturalised in the United States.
MR. FLOWERS:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

It doesn’t — that’s not the definition of

a "person" but that’s the definition of a "citizen".
MR. FLOWERS:

Your Honor, it’s our position that

the definition of a person is so basic, it’s so fundamental
that the framers of the Constitution had not even set out to
define.

We can only go to what the teachings at the time

the Constitution was framed.

2S
We have numerous listings in the brief by Mr.
Jos Witherspoon , a professor at the University of Tessas, that
tries to trace back what was in their mind when they had the
"person55 concept when they drew up the Constitution.
He quoted Blackstone here in 1765, and he observed,
in his commentaries, that2

"Life.

This right is inherent by

nature in every individual, and exists even before the child
is born."
I submit to you that the Declaration of Independence,
"We hold these" —
QUESTION:

Mr. Flowers, when you quote Blackstone,

is it not true that in Blackstone’s time abortion was not a
felony?
MR. FLOWERSs

That's true, Your Honor.

But my

point there was to see the thinking of the framers of the
Constitution, from the people they learned from, and the
general attitudes of the times.
QUESTIONS

Well, I think — I'm juat wondering if

there isn't basic inconsistency there, and let me go back to
something else that you said.

Is it not true, or is it

true that the medical profession itself is not in agreement
as to whan life begins?
MR. FLOWERS s

I think that's true* sir.

But from

a layman's standpoint, medically speaking, we would say that
at the moment of conception from the chromosomes, every

potential that anybody in this room has is present, from
the moment of conception»
QUESTIONS

But then you're speaking of potential

of right.
MS. FLOWERS:
QUESTIONS

Yes, sir.
With which everyone can agree.

MR. FLOWERS?

On the seventh day, 1 think that the

heart, in some form, starts beating. On the twentieth day,
practically all the facilities are there that you and I have,
Your Honor.
I think that —
QUESTION:

Well, if you’re correct that the fetus

is a person, then 1' don’t suppose you'd have — the State
would have great trouble permitting an abortion, would it?
MR. FLOWERSs
QUESTION:

Ye3, sir.

In any circumstance?

MR. FLOWERS:
QUESTIONS

It would, yes, sir.

To save the life of a mother or her

health or anything else?
MR. FLOWERS: Well, there would be the balancing of
the two lives, and I think that —
QUESTION: Well, what would you choose?

Would you

choose to kill the innocent one, or what?
MR. FLOWERS:

Well, in our statute the State did

choose that way, Your Honor.

27
QUESTION: Well, —
J4R. FLOWERS: The protection of the mother.
QUESTION: Well, did the State of Tesas say that if it
is for the benefit of the health of the wife to kill the
husband?
{Laughter.3
MR. FLOWERS:

I’m sorry, I didn’t understand your

question.
QUESTION:

Could Texas say if it confronts the

situation for the benefit of the health of the wife, that the
husband has to die? could they kill him?
MR. FLOWERS:
QUESTION:

I wouldn't think so, sir.

Is there any statute in Texas that

prohibits the doctor from performing any operation other than
an abortion?
MR. FLOWERS*

I don’t — I don't think so, sir, and

there is another thrust of our argument.

If we declare, as

the appellees in this case have asked this Court to declare,
that an embryo or a fetus is a mass of protoplasm similar to
a tumor, then, of course, the State has no compelling interest
whatsoever.
QUESTION:

But there is no — the only operation

that a doctor can possibly commit that will bring on a
criminal penalty is an abortion?
MR. FLOWERSs

Yes, sir.

/

28
QUESTION: Why?
MR. FLOWERS:
QUESTION:

As far as *—
Well? why don't you limit some other

operations?
MR. FLOWERS :

Because this is the only type of

operation that would take another human life.
QUESTION: Well, a brain operation could»
MR. FLOWERS3

Well, there again, that would be —

I think that in every feat that a doctor performs that he
is constantly making this judgment.
QUESTION:

Well, if a doctor performs a brain

operation and does it improperly, he could be guilty of
manslaughter, couldn't he?
MR. FLOWERS:
QUESTION:

I would think so, if he was negligent.
Well, why couldn’t you charge him with

manslaughter if he commits an abortion?
MR. FLOWERS:

In effect, Your Honor, we did.

In

the statute 1195, that has been very carefully avoided all
throughout these proceeding, it’s not attacked as unconstitu­
tional, for some reason.
If you will permit me to —
QUESTION:

But is it in issue here?

MR. FLOWERS:

No, sir.

You asked the question about

whether we had mad© manslaughter — or an .Abortion manslaughter.
QUESTION:

Maybe the reason is:

why have two

29
statutes?
MR. FLOWERS; Well, this was in context with

this

is 1195, they are attacking 1191 through 1196, but omitted
1195.
Here's what 1195 says — provides;

Whoever shall,

during the parturition of the mother, destroy the vitality
or life in a child in a state of being born, before actual
birth — and before actual birth, which child would have
otherwise been born alive, which -- shall be confined to
the penitentiary for life or not less than five years.
QUESTION:

What does that statute mean?

MR. FLOWERS: Sir?
QUESTION t What does it mean?
MR. FLOWERS:
QUESTIONs

I would think that —

That it is an offense to a kill a

child in the process of childbirth.
MR. FLOWERS;

Yes, sir.

It would be immediately

before childbirth or right in the proximity of the child
being born.
QUESTION: Which is not an abortion.
MR. FLOWERS: Which is not — would not be an
abortion.

Yes, sir, you're correct, sir.

It would foe

homicide.
Gentlemen, we feel that the concept of a fetus
being within the concept of a person, within the framework

30

of the United Spates Constitution and the Texas Constitution,

is an extremely fundamental thing.
QUESTION:

Of course, if you’re right about that,

you can sit down, you’ve won your case.
MR. FLOWERS:
QUESTION s

Your Honor, —
Except insofar as maybe the Texas

abortion lav; presently goes too far in allowing abortions.
MR. FLOWERS:

Yes, sir.

That's exactly right.

We feel that this is the only question, really, that
this Court has to answer.
We have a —
QUESTION:

Do you think the case is over for you?

You've lost your case, then, if the fetus or the embryo is
not a person, is that it?
MR. FLOWERS:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, I would say so.

You mean the State has no interest of

its own that it can assert, and —
MR* FLOWERS:

Oh, we have interests, Your Honor,

preventing promiscuity, say, maybe that's —
QUESTION:

Mr. Flowers, your Legislature apparently,

or you're asserting that your State law wants to protect the
life of the fetus.
MR. FLOWERS:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION: And under State law there is some right —
that are some rights given to the fetus.

31
MR. FLOWERS:
QUESTION s

Yes, sir.

And you ar© asserting those rights

against the right of the mother.
MR. FLOWERS 2

Balancing against the Ninth Amendment

rights of the mother within the framework —
QUESTION:

But that's wholly aside from whether the

fetus is a person under the federal Constitution.

You can

still assert those rights, whether the fetus is a person or
not.
MR. FLOWERS:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION: Does Texas have judicial statutes on
mutilation, making it a criminal act?
MR. FLOWERS?

Yes, sir.

QUESTION: So that there are other assertions —
MR. FLOWERS?
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

— or procedures which could be

criminal?
MR. FLOWERS: That's right.
QUESTION:

If a man walked into a doctor's office

and said, "I want you to cut off my right arm" —
MR. FLOWERS:

That's right, mutilation, castration.

Yes, sir, I had forgotten about those, Your Honor.
QUESTION;
MR. FLOWERSs
would —

Those statutes apply to doctors?
I would assume so, or anyone that

32

QUESTIONs Do you have any case that says so?
MR. FLOWERSs

No, sir.

I would say that there would have to be a culpability
of proof in there as in most criminal cases.
Your Honor, I'd like to call the attention of the
Court, that the unborn child — that this Court has not been
blind to the rights of the unborn child in the past.

In the

Memorial case, vs. Anderson, a New Jersey Supreme Court case,
the Court — this was the case whore the pregnant woman had
refused, on religious grounds, to undergo a blood transfusion
in order to save the child»
The Court held that the right of the child to live
and to be born was paramount over this pregnant woman's
right of religion.
I think that here is exactly what we’re facing in
this casos

is the life of this unborn fetus paramount over
*¥ 'r j

the woman's right to determine whether or not she shall bear
a child?
In Gleitman vs. Cosgrove, it’s a New Jersey Supreme
Court case, it's a tort action instituted against the doctor
a

as a result of his failure to warn the mother that she was
suffering from German measles, in order that she could terminate
her pregnancy.
The Court recognized the life of the embryo, and
stated that it would have been easier for the mother, and less

33

expensive for the father? this alleged detriment cannot
stand against the preciousness of one single life.
In Jones vs. State — excuse »aaf Jones vs. Jones,
New York Supreme Court held that the unborn child was a
patient of the mother’s obstetrician as vrell as the mother
herself.
In Jackson vs. Indiana,, this Court zealously
guardeid the rights of a retarded child.
Wow, if we're going to extend the right of a child
who has reached its potential, it cannot go on and grow, it
cannot go on and grow mentally and achieve, then how much
more right should we afford to a child who is — has all
of the potential of achieving?
The Prince vs. Commonwealth of Massachusetts case,
this Court was faced with the contention that the State
statute precluding labor by a child in tender years in
distributing religious tracks was protected, that the child’s
right to grow up and to become educated and fully develop
was paramount to these parents' religious belief.
This Court has been diligent in protecting the
/

rights of the minority.

And, gentlemen, we say that this is

a minority, a silent minority, the true silent minority.
Who is speaking for these children?

Where is the counsel

for these unborn children, whose life is being taken?
Where is the safeguard of the right to trial by jury?

34
Are we to place this power in the hands of a
mother and a doctor?

Ail of the constitutional rights, if

this person has the person concept.

What would keep a

Legislature under this ground from deciding who else might
or might not be a human being, or might not be a person?
QUESTIONi

Well, generally speaking, I think you

agree that up unti,l now the test has been whether or not
somebody has been born or not, and that's the word used
in the Fourteenth Amendment.
MS, FLOWERS2
QUESTION2

Yes, sir.
That's what would keep the Legislature,

I suppose, from classifying people that have been bora as
not parsons.
MR. FLOWERSs

Your Honor, it seems to me that the

physical act of being born — I'm not playing it down, I
know it's
[Laughter.]
— a very momentous incident.

But what changes?

Is it a non-human and changing, by the act of birth, into a
human?

Or would —
QUESTION *

Well, that's bean the theory up until

now on the lawbooks.
[Laughter.3
MR. FLOWERSs

Wall, in other words, it has been

the theory that we have, deriving from non“human material, a

35
human being, after conception»
Well, Your Honor, —
QUESTION?

You see, that's the reason I asked you

at the beginning, ’within what framework should this question
be decided?

Should it be a theological one, —

MR. FLOWERS:
QUESTIONS

Yes, sir.

— a philosophical one, or a medical one,

or — that we could find here dealing with —
MR. FLOWERS:
QUESTION?

I think, Your Honor, that the Court —

-** the judicial meaning of it.

MR. FLOWERS:

I wish I could answer that.

I

believe that the Court must take these, the medical research,
and apply it to our Constitution the beat they can.

X said

I'm without envy of the burden that the Court has.
I think that possibly we have an opportunity to make
on© ©f the worst mistakes here that we’ve ever made, from the
— I5m sorry.
QUESTION: But there’s no medical testimony that
backs up your statement that it goes from inception, is there?
MR. FLOWERS s
QUESTION*

Only that —

Medical.

MR. FLOWERS:

Sir, in this case you're talking

about?
QUESTION:

No, ia there any medical testimony of

any kind that says that a fetus is a person at the time of

36
inception?
MR* FLOWERS;

Your Honor, I would like to call the

Court's attention, in answering that question, to what I
feel to believe one of the better culminations of the medical
research, and that was Senior Judge Campbell's dissenting
opinion in the Doe vs. Scott, which is very similar to the
case we have before us.
He goes in chronological order of what the medical
research has determined, from the chromosome structure at the
time of conception, what the potential is, down through each
day of life, until it’s bom.
QUESTIONS

But I understood you to say that the

State of Texas says it extends from the date of inception
■*

until the child is born.
MR. FLOWERS; The date of conception until the
day of — yes, sir.
QUESTION; And that’s it?
MR. FLOWERS:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Now, you're now quoting the judge, I

want you to give me a medical, recognizable medical writing
of any kind that says that at the time of conception the
fetus is a person.
MR. FLOWERS:

I do not believe that I could give

that to you, without researching through the briefs that have
been filed in this case, Your Honor.

I’m not sure that I

37
could give it to you after research.
QUESTION:

Mr. Flowers, —

MRo FLOWERS:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir a

— did Judge Campbell rely on medical

authorities in that statement you’re summarising?
MR. FLOWERS:

Yes, sir, he did.

This case was —

the Court held there that really the problem could be
answered on an extension of the Griswold case.

And here’s

what my dissenting judge had to say about that, which we
adopt, Your Honor.
He said:

In citing Griswold, the majority concludes

we could not distinguish'the interest asserted by the
plaintiff in this case from those asserted in Griswold.
In other word3, in their views there is no
distinction that can be made between prohibiting the use of
contraceptives and prohibiting the destruction of fetal
life, which, as explained above, may be construed to be a
human life.
I find this assertion incredible.

Contraceptive

prevents the creation of new life; abortion destroys the
existing life.

Contraceptives and abortion are as distin­

guishable as thoughts and dreams are distinguishable from a
reality.
QUESTION:

Well, where are the medical authorities

you told Mr. Justice Rehnquist he cited?

Are they there?

V

MR, FLOWERS;

Yes , sir»

day, just prior to thi3 time, sir.
QUESTION:

He lists them day by
But it's quite lengthy.

Where is that you’re reading from?

MR. FLOWERS:

It’s 321 Fed Supp. on page 394, sir.

Or 392 it begins, Your Honor.
And I refer you to this medical condensation,
because I have read most of the comments that he has to make
through the — throughout these many, many briefs that we
have had submitted in this case and other cases.
For instance, he starts offs

We did -— let’s see —

as Illinois Legislature would have before us the following
undisputed facts relating to fetal life, seven weeks after
conception the fertilised egg develops into a wellproportioned, small-scale baby? and then goes from there on.
Now, I know he doesn't address himself, Your Honor,
to the moment of conception.
QUESTION!

I didn't think so.

MR. FLOWERS:

You're entirely right there? but I

find no way that I know that any court or any legislature
or any doctor anywhere can say that here is the dividing
line.

Here is not a life, and here is a life, after concep­

tion .
Perhaps it would be better left to that legislature.
There they have the facilities to have some type of medical
testimony brought before them, and the opinion of the people

39
who are being governed by it.
QUESTION: Weil» if you’re right that an unbora fetus
is a person, then you can’t leave it to the Legislature to
play fast and loose dealing with that person.

In other words,

if you’re correct in your basic submission that an unborn
fetus is a person, then abortion laws such as that which
New York has are grossly unconstitutional, isn’t it?
MR. FLOWERS:
QUESTION:

Allowing the kilXing of people.

MR. FLOWERS?
QUESTION :

That's right, yes.

Yes, sir.

A person.

MR. FLOWERS:

Your Honor, in Massachusetts, I

might point out —
QUESTION;

Definitely it isn't up to the

Legislature; it's a constitutional problem, isn't it?
MR. FLOWERS:

Well, if there would be any exceptions

within this —
QUESTION: The basic constitutional question,
initially, is whether or not an unborn fetus is a person,
isn't it?
MR. FLOWERS:

Yes, sir.

And entitled to the

constitutional protection.
QUESTION:

And that's critical to this case, is

it not?
MR. FLOWERS:

Yes, sir, it is.

40
And we feel that the treatment that the courts have
given unborn children in dissent in distribution of property
rights, tort laws, have all pointed out that they have, in the
past have given credence to this concept.
QUESTION:

Mr. Flowers, doesn't the fact that so

many of the State abortion statutes do provide for exceptional
situations in which an abortion may be performed, and
presumably these date back a great number of years, following
Mr. Justice Stewart's comment, suggest that the absolute
proposition that a fetus from the time of conception is a
person just is at least against the weight of historical
legal approach to the question?
MR. FLOWERS:

Yes, sir, I would think possibly

that that would indicate that.

However, Your Honor, in this

whole field of abortion her®, we have, on the one hand,
great clamoring for this liberalisation of it.
is good.

Population explosion.

Perhaps this

W© have just so many things

that are arriving on the scene in the past few years, that
might have soma effect on producing this type of legislation,
rather than facing the facts squarely.
I don't think anyone has faced the fact, in making
a decision, whether this is a life, in a person concept.
Thank you, Your Honors.
QUESTION:

Mr. Flowers, when was the first

abortion statute adopted in your State?

41
MR. FLOWERS%
QUESTION:

Your Honor, in 1354.

Prior to 1854, what was the situation

in Texas?
MR. FLOWERS:
Your Honor.

I do not think it was an offense,

I think it was silent, the State was silent.

QUESTION: So, on your theory, destruction of the
person in the form of a fetus was legal?
MR. FLOWERS:

Yes, sir — well, at least, the

Legislature hadn’t spoken on it, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Then it was legal.

MR. FLOWERS:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Mr. Flowers, did Tessas have an abortion

statute on the books at the time, at least in the eyes of
the north, when it was readmitted to the Union after the
Civil War?
MR. FLOWERS:

No, sir, the State vzas admitted to

the Union in 1845, Your Honor, and —
QUESTION: Well, at the time that it was — passed
muster with the —
MR. FLOWERS: When it was a Republic?
QUESTION: Well, my historical impression is that
following the Civil War Congress went through the procedure,
at any rate, of readmitting the States which had seceded, and
passing on their constitutional provisions and that sort of
thing.

Did Texas have an abortion statute at that time?

42
MR* FLOWERS:

Yas, sir.

It was passed in 1&54, Your

Honor,
QUESTION %

Do you know as a matter of historical

fact when most of these abortion statutes cam® on the books?
MR. FLOWERS?

I think it was„ most of them were in

the mid-ISOG's, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

In fact, the latter half of the

Nineteenth Century?
MR, FLOWERS:

Yas, sir.

QUESTION: Do you know why they all cam® on at that
time?
MR. FLOWERS:
QUESTION:

No, sir, I surely don’t.
So that the materials indicate that,

during that period, they were enacted to protect the health
and lives of pregnant women, because of the danger of
operative procedures generally around that time?
MR. FLOWERS:

I'm sure that was a great factor,

!

Your Honor.
QUESTION: Well, isn’t it historically pretty well
accepted as a fact th&t in the early period of the history
of this country there:was general reliance upon religious
disciplines to preclude this kind of activity, abortions,
and when that didn't seem to cover it, then the States began
to enact the statutes?
MR. FLOWERS:

Yes, sir.

43
QUESTION:

As had been done in England.

MR. FLOWERS:

Also in the exploration and the

Indian days# if you wish, frontier days# I don’t imagine
that too many abortions# intentional abortions were created

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. SARAH R. WEDDINGTON#
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MRS. WEDDINGTON:

Thank you, Your Honor.

I think Mr. Flowers well made the point when he said
that no one can say, Here is the dividing line; Here is where
life begins — life is here and life is not over here.
In a situation where no one can prove where life
begins, where no one can show that the Constitution was
adopted, that it was meant to protect fetal life, in those
situations where it is shown that that kind of decision is
so fundamentally a part of individual life of the family, of
such fundamental impact on the person.
QUESTION: Well# I gather your argument is that a
State may not protect the life of the fetus or prevent an
abortion even at any time during pregnancy?
MRS. WEDDINGTON:

At this —

44
QUESTION s

Right up until the moment of birth.

MRS. WEDDINGTON:

At this time my point is that

this particular statute is unconstitutional.
QUESTION?

I understand that, hut your argument»

the way you state it, is that it wouldn’t make any
difference when in the pregnancy that the State attempts to
prevent the abortion?

It would still be unconstitutional.

MRS. WEDDINGTON*

At this time there is no

indication to show that the Constitution would give any
protection prior to birth.

That is not before the Court»

and that is the question that —
QUESTION* Well» I don’t know whether it is or it
isn’t.

If the statute — you’re claiming that the statute

is void on it3 face.
MRS. WEDDINGTON;
QUESTION*

That’s correct.

Now» isn’t it possible» if the statute -

before you can declare the statute void on its face that you
have to say that it's void no matter when in the pregnancy
the abortion takes place?
MRS. WEDDINGTON*

It seems to me in this situation

the Court is —- excuse me» I must — would you ask the
question again?
QUESTION:

Well, is the statute void — would the

statute be void on its face if the State could prevent
abortions at any time after six months?

MRS. WEDDINGTON:

You mean if the State in fact did

that?
QUESTION:

Well# let's assume it wets constitutional

for the State to prevent abortions after six months.
MRS. WEDDINGTONi

It would still be void on its

face in this situation because it's overly broad.

It inter­

feres at a time when a State has no
QUESTIONs Well# this isn't a free speech caEe.
The statute might be perfectly valid in part and invalid in
part.

You're saying'it's invalid on its face# totally

Invalid# that it may not apply to — the statute may not
prevent an abortion# no matter xtfhen the abortion takes
place.
MRS. WEDDINGTON:

My argument would first be that

it’s void on its face# and second, if the Court finds it's
not void on its face, it certainly is void because it
infringes upon the fundamental right at a time when the
State can show no compelling interest early in pregnancy.
QUESTIONS What did this Court say about voidness
in the Vuifcch case?

What did we say there?

MRS. WEDDINGTONs There you said the particular D. C.
statute was not void for vagueness.

It’s a different

statute.

There was an interpretation of the meaning of the

statute.

And the Court there said the doctor could work

within that context, and could tell what the statute meant.

46
QUESTION;

Well, then, isn"t the only difference

betxtfeen the Texas statute and the D. C. statute that the
Texas statute does not have the health factor?
MRS. WEDDINGTON: That's correct, which makes it
much more difficult for the doctor to tell when it is
— whan he can —
QUESTION;

But in Vuitch, unless the Court is

prepared to overrule it, not a fact, the Texas statute would
be valid if it was construed to include abortions for the
protection of health, treating life as broad enough to do that.
MRS. WEDDINGTON:

Including mental and physical.

But then the question is raised as to the right of privacy,
which was not before the Court in the Vuitch case, and is
before the Court in this particular situation.
As to the Hippocratic oath, it seems to rae that
that oath was adopted at a time when abortion was extremely
dangerous to the health of the woman? and, second, that the
oath is to protect life, and here the auestion is:

what does

life mean in this particular context?
It’s the sort o£ same vagueness, It seems to me,
that you're — well, okay, life there could be slightly
different because of the constitutional implications here.
It seems to me that —
1

QUESTION;

Well, the Hippocratic oath went directly

and;specifically to providing procedures.

47
MRS. WEDDINGTOM;
QUESTIONs

To providing a —

However life was defined.

MRS. WEDDINGTON: That's correct.
As to mutilation, there, it seems to me, that the
purpose of those statutes was to prevent the citizen from
becoming a dependent or ward of the State, and also to insure
that its citizens would be available for service in the
military.
In this particular instance, the rationale works
just the opposite.

Here a woman, because of her pregnancy,

is often not a productive member of society.

She cannot work,

she cannot hold a job, she's not eligible for welfare, she
cannot gat unemployment compensation.

And furthermore, in fact

the pregnancy may produce a child who will become a ward of
the State.
W® do not object to the cases, such as the trans­
fusion case, where there is a decision already made by the
woman that she desires to carry the pregnancy to term? and,
when that decision is made, that the child should be given
every opportunity to come into life a healthy person.
We do not believe that that necessitates the con­
clusion that therefore, under the Constitution, prior to birth,
a person under the Fourteenth Amendment would exist.
In this case, this Court is faced with a situation
where there have been fourteen three-judge courts that have

\

48
ruled on the constitutionality of abortion statutes.

Nine

courts have favored the woman, five have gone against her.
Twenty-five judges have favored the ivoman, seventeen have gone
against her.

Nine Circuit Judges have favored the woman,

five have gone against her.

Sixteen District Court judges

have favored the woman, ten have goine against her.
No one is more keenly aware of the gravity of the
issues or the moral implications of this case, that it is a
case that must be decided on the Constitution. We do not
disagree that there is a progression of fetal development.
It is the conclusion to be drawn from that upon which we
disagree.
We are not here to advocate abortion.

We do not

ask this Court to rule that abortion is good or desirable in
any particular situation.
We are here to advocate that the decision as to
xtfhethar or not a particular woman will continue to carry or
will terminate a pregnancy is a decision that should be made
by that individual, that in fact she has a constitutional
right to make that decision for herself, and that the State
has shown no interest in interfering with that decision.
Our supplemental brief, on page 14, points out that
the brief of the opposition can’t quite decide when life does
begin.

At one point they suggest it's when there’s implanta­
A few pages later they suggest it's with conception.

QUESTIONS

But any doctor, I suppose, you would

say, may refuse her?
MBS. WEDDINGTON;

Certainly, Your Honor.

He may

refuse any kind of medical procedure whatsoever.
QUESTION! But the State may not; yes.
MRS. WEDDINGTON;

Here it’s the question of whether

or not the State, by the statute, will force the woman to
continue.

The woman should be given that freedom, just as

the doctor has the freedom to decide what procedures he will
carry out and what he vzill refuse to his patients.
QUESTION;

To be sure that I get your arqument

in focus, I take it from your recent remarks that you are
urging upon us abortion on demand of the woman alone, not
in conjunction with her physician?
MRS. WEDDINGTONs

I am urging that in this particular

context this statute is unconstitutional.

That in the Bjgird

vs. Eisenstadt case this Court said, "If the right of privacy
is to mean anything, it is the right of the individual,
whether married or single, to make determinations for them­
selves . **
It seems to me that you cannot say this is a woman
of this particular doctor, and this particular woman.

It is,

it seems to me, —
QUESTION: Wall, doesn't it follow from that, then,
that a woman can come into a doctor's office and say, "I want

50
an abortion”.
MBS. WEDDINGTON: And he can sayf "I'm sorry, I
don't perform them,”
QUESTION? And then what does she do?
MRS. WEDDINGTONs She goes elsewhere, if she so
chooses.

If she stays with that — you know, that's an

impossible question.

Certainly, I don't think the State could

say the first doctor a woman goes to shall make that
determination and she cannot go elsewhere.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Your time is up now,

Mrs. Weddington.
MRS. WEDDINGTON: Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Thank you, Mrs. Weddington.
Thank you, Mr. Flowers.
The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 11:09 o’clock, a.ra., the case was
submitted.3
