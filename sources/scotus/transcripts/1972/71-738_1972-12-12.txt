CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 71-733, The Mescalero Apache Tribe against. Jones.
'Mr. Fettinger,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE E. PETTINGER
OK BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR» PETTINGER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and raay it please

the Court:
The question presented by this case to this Court
is can the State of New Mexico, acting under State law, impose
its compensating tax on the use of tangible personal property
owned by the Mescalero Apache Tribe and utilized on its
private enterprise principally located outside of the
boundaries of the Mescalero reservation, and can the State
of New Mexico, acting under State law, validly impose its
gross receipts tax under the same circumstances?
The essential facts of the case are that the
Mescalero Apache Tribe is a treaty tribe.

It's present

reservation boundaries were established by Executive Order.
In 1936 the Tribe adopted its first constitution under
25 U.S.C. 476, which constitution was amended in 1965.

Both

of these constitutions were duly approved by the Secretary of
the Interior.
The Tribe is the exclusive owner and the operator
of sierra Blanca Ski Resort, which is located in Otero and

4
Lincoln Counties in the State of New Mexico.

The ski resort

is primarily on lands belonging to the United States Forest
Servies and leased to the Tribe for a period of 30 years.
QUESTION:

But not entirely so?

MR. FETTINGER:

Not entirely so, sir, some of the

ski runs and ski trails are , in fact, on the reservation.
QUESTION:

Do you think the case is basically any

different from what it would be if the Tribe was running a
taxicab company in San Francisco?
MR. FETTINGER:

Yes, sir; I think we can draw many

distinctions for that purpose.
QUESTION:

I wish I could do it now.

The ski trails would be one of the

factors?
MR. FETTINGER:
more.

A minor one, sir.

I think there are

If you wish m© to take up the question now, I will.
QUESTION:

No, just take it up on your own time.

MR. FETTINGER:

The ski resort in fact is bordered

on the south by the reservation itself, and the Ski Enterprise,
including the lease with the United States Forest Service,
was entered into by the Tribe pursuant to Article XI of the
Constitution which Constitution was approved by the Secretary
of the Interior.
A feasibility study was prepared and paid for by
the United States Government, and the purpose of the operation
of the ski resort by the Mescalero Apache Tribe is to raise

5
revenue in lieu of taxing tribal members, and also the
proceeds are used for the educational and social and economic
welfare of the Mesc&iero Apache people.
The ski resort provides job training for the members
of the Tribe, and there are 20 to 30 members of the Tribe who
are in fact in such a training capacity.
QUESTION;
is given to them?

Could you tell us what kind of training
Are there other people who work there

without training?
MR. FETTINGER:

Yes, sir.

The ski run is operated

as a business intending to train members of the Tribe to
operate ski lifts.

They may be brought into the economic

community in a sense of training for leasing ski boots.
may be maintenance personnel.

They

They may be in the soil

conservation area, grooming the ski trails, maybe slash
removal, maybe timbering.

Each of these jobs is in a training

•»

capacity for the individual attempting to upgrade the
individual Indians.
QUESTION;

Then who runs the ski resort?

MR. FETTINGER:

The ski resort is run under a plan

of operation that has been adopted by the Tribal Council
subject to the approval of the Secretary of the Interior.

It

is run under that plan by a Board of Directors that includes
Indians on that Board.

Mr. Chino is a member of the Board.

They run that enterprise subject to the restrictions set forth

6

in that plan of operation.
QUESTION:

Do I understand from what you have just

said that it is not run exclusively by Indians?
MR. PETTINGERs

It is run exclusively by Indians

in that the plan of operation for the ski run was adopted
by the Tribal Council.

But under the Constitution of the

Tribe, even that plan of operation after adoption by the
Tribal Council is subject to approval of the Secretary of
the Interior.
QUESTION:

What I am trying to get at is, are there

non-Indians operating the ski resort?
MR. FETTINGERs
the operation, yes, sir.

There are non-Indians involved in
The manager, for example, is not

an Indian.
QUESTION:

It is set up so that the Indians that ar©

present there are only in training?
MR. FETTINGER:

Fundamentally, sir.

Some of them

actually hold down jobs.
QUESTION:

This is what I get from your briefs, that

the Indians there are only in training, and other people are
there running it.

Is this correct?

MR. FETTINGER:
facts, your Honor.

This case is here on stipulated

At the time this controversy arose, that

was in fact the case.

Since that time, sir, circumstances

have changed so that there are employees involved xvho have

7
bean longer term employees, but training is still a significant
part of the operation of the ski run.
The original purchase of this ski run, both the
interest in the land, the improvements and the naw construc­
tion on tlia ski run was completely financed by loan to the
Mescalsro Apache Tribe under 25 U.S.C. Section 470.

At the

ski resort, the United Statas Government must approve the
budget for the fiscal year, the leasing of equipment and
other

property used by the Tribe, the leasing of facilities

at the ski resort to various concessionaires, the plan -and
design of any additional facilities or improvements to be
constructed at -the ski resort, the disposal of any property
other than expendable items, the form and the content of
monthly reports, the form and the content of the annual
report and the certified public accountant that in fact,
prepares such annual report.
The Bureau of Revenue of the State of New Mexico
conducted an audit in the year 1968 and as a result assessed
compensating tax, which is essentially an excise tax, in the
amount of approximately $5,800 plus penalty and interest.
QUESTION:

Is that tax in the nature of a use tax,

some that was bought out-of-state basically?
MR. FETTINGER:

Yes, sir, the compensating tax in

New Mexico applies to out-of-state purchases brought, into the
State and in fact used there.

In that sense it can be termed

a use tax, generally referred to as an excise.
QUESTIONS

What if the Indian organization had not

had to go out of State and found a dealer down in Alamogordo
that would be able to supply it?

I take it they would have

gone down and he would have charged them presumably a State
sales tax.

Would you claim that that was beyond the power of

the State to exact under thos© circumstances?
MR. FETTINGER:

If the purchase was made by the Tribe

for tribal purposes, we would contend that, purchased inside
or

outside of the State of New Mexico, it would be exempt,

from such a gross receipts or compensating tax.

In this case

it was purchased outside the State or it would not be under
the compensating tax.
QUESTION:

Do you claim if it were purchased under

the same circumstances it was in this case from a dealer in
Alamogordo and he said, "It's a thousand dollars price plus
$40 for the Governor," that he could not add that to the bill
he was giving to the Tribe?
MR. FETTINGERs

Yes, 3ir.

If I may, the statute

since this case has been amended in fact at this time, but
under the State statute if the tangible personal property were to
be used on the reservation, the State statute presently would
permit the Tribe to issue what is termed a non-taxable
transaction certificate and thereby avoid the tax if purchased
in Alamogordo in this case.

It would hinge on whether it was

9
used "on the reservation."
QUESTIONS

Was the ski lift in this case, the material

it was used for, on or off the reservation?
MR. FETTINGER:

It is physically located beyond

present boundaries of the reservation.

the

It is immediately

adjacent to, but off the reservation.
QUESTION?

It's not on Indian property.

MR. FETTINGER:

We would contend that the interest

in real estate upon which this ski run is located —
QUESTION:

The lease.

MR. FETTINGER:

Yes, the lease from the Forest

Service and as such is an interest in real estate and is
effectively subject to -the statute which provides that it's
not subject to tax.
At the time that the compensating tax was assessed
against the Tribe, as a matter of fact, the improvements had
been completed and were in fact permanently attached to the
real estate,

All of the materials against which the

compensating tax was assessed were purchased with money which
was borrowed from the United States Government, and all of
such purchases were approved by the Bureau of Indian Affairs
or the Secretary of the Interior.
Beginning as of the first day of October 1963 and con­
tinuing until the end of December of 1966, the Mescalero
Apache Tribe has paid the State of Mew Mexico something in

10

excess of $26,000 in gross receipts taxes by reason of its
operation of the ski resort.

We filed a claim for refund.

That protest and a claim for refund was heard by the
Commissioner of the Bureau of Revenue.

We were turned down.

We went to the Court of Appeals for the State, we exhausted
our remedy.

We are presently before this Court on a motion

of certiori.
The Court of Appeals of the State of Hew Mexico
held that the Enabling Act of the State of New Mexico,
principally Section 2, constituted a specific grant of power
to the State of New Mexico to tax"as other lands and other
property are taxed any lands and other property outside of
an Indian reservation owned or held by any Indian."
It is our contention that the Enabling Act of the
State of New Mexico, Section 2, while the quotation is correct,
it simply does not apply to an Indian tribe.
is not the same thing as an Indian tribe.

"Any Indian"

And merely reading

Section 2 of our Enabling Act would carry this forward with
relative strength.

The first section of Section 2 refers to

an ordinary disclaimer and refers specifically to interest
in real estate within its boundaries held by any Indian or
Indian tribe that shall have been acquired through the United
States, and with the mention of the Indian tribe in the same
section, it is very clear that it was not inadvertently left
out of the section that is cited by the State of New Mexico

11
in its efforts to tax the Mescalero Apache Tribe under these
particular circumstances.
We would respectfully suggest that since the
Attorney General of the State of New Mexico in May ox this
year citing Mescalero v. Jones as authority
cases

clearly establish

stated that these

that Indians on Indian lands

can lawfully be subject, to taxation by State authorities
without necessarily interfering with any right, of selfgovernment or impairment of any rights granted or reserved
to them by the Federal Government, it makes this case even
more important to the Indians, perhaps not only in New
Mexico but throughout the whole of the United States.
’ President Nixon in his Message to Congress in
July of 1970 acknowledged that the Federal Government must
support and encourage Indian development. He recited at that
time facts such as unemployment on reservations which runs as
high a 80 percent, that 80 percent of the reservation Indians
are below the poverty level, that the average annual income
is $1500 on reservations, and suggested that rather than
oscillating between a policy of termination on the one hand
and paternalism on the other, that the Federal Government
should play a complementary role with Indian communities in
meeting the clear needs of the Indians in the United States.
QUESTION:

The President was addressing those

observations to the Congress, was he not?

12
MR. FETTIWGER:

Yas, sir, and I think they are

significant from the point of view that the Commissioner of
Indian Affairs is presumed by case law to speak for the
President whan exercising a policy towards Indians under
25 U.S.C. 2.

Hopefully that policy is as expressed by the

President, sir.
Now, interestingly enough, in.the case of Mason v.
United States, which is a Court of Claims case decided
earlier this year, Judge Davis recited that the judicial
climate had changed in the last 15 years in the United States
and that the Indian tax immunity was no longer directly
compared to and correlated with other governmental immunities
P

>

•

and that at this time the courts were looking to the particular
social goals that Congress had sought to reach through
restrictions on Indian properties.
It is suggested to this Court that the instrumentality
doctrine that has often been used by this Court and by others
in ruling upon taxability of Indian interests when viewed
in the light of profitability which in -Federal Land Bank v.
Board of County Commissioners decided in 1961 was determined
to be a worthwhile Federal purpose.

When the profitability

of the enterprise is considered to b© part of the purpose and
goal, that any tax that burdens that profitability is
inappropriate when assessed by a State
authority to do so

absent specific

13
I would suggest to this Court that the transactions
herein taxed by the State of New Mexico, both are purchases
by the Tribe and sales by the Mescalero Apache Tribe and
are clearly with commerce with the Indians.

The treaty with

the Mescalero Apache Tribe has subjected the Tribe to all of .he
regulations and laws of the State of New Mexico, and unlike
Kake v. Egan, the treaty also provided that the Tribe was
lawfully and exclusively under the laws and jurisdiction bf
the Government of the United States.
I believe that the termination policy that existed
at one time expressed by Congress has been repudiated by the
various sections of the Indian Reorganization Act and that in
fact Section 25 U.S.C. 476 under which this Tribe is organised
specifically provides that in addition to the other powers
vested in the Tribe by virtue of the Constitution, there shall
be vested the right to prevent the sale or encumbrance of
tribal lands or other tribal assets without the consent of the
Tribe.

The Mescalero Constitution carries forward this

language giving the Tribe the right to veto such encumbrances.
If we draw a parallel to the situation where
individual Indians were to receive their patent free of any
charge or emcumbrance, that a direct parallel exists in this
situation without even any congressional intent to terminate
and that if we use the word “encumbrance" in the statute,
25 U.S.C. 476, and the Mescalero Apache Constitution in the

14
same light that tills Court in the past has used the phrase
"charge or encurobrance" from the General Allotment Act and
related Acts, that we arrive at the conclusion that this land
also should not be taxed by the State of New Mexico.
The Tribe is a peculiar entity.

It is created by

Congress under the specific statutes we have cited.

It is

supervised in all matters by the executive department acting
through the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, and the present
Indian policy of self-determination without termination
necessarily carries with it the intentional withholding of
direct control.

I do not believe that the test should

reasonably include the absence of some element of control over
the Mescalero Apache Tribe, because the purpose as expressed
by Congress and the executive department is to develop
independence on the part of the American Indian.

Whether or

not termination ultimately takes place is a political matter
that should be decided by Congress.
In the Tribal Constitution which is a part of the
appendix in this matter, the Tribal Council’s powers, all of
them, are subject to the regulations of the Secretary of
the Interior.

Article XI under which this Tribe exercised

its purchase of these assets, the plans of operation as
adopted, are subject to review of the Secretary of the
Interior.

Under Article XIII of the Tribal Constitution,

and perhaps most important, the Tribal budget is subject to

15
"such review and approval as the Secretary requires, and no
expenditures may be made except, in conformity with that
budget."

Control of the budget in this case constitutes

essentially absolute control over the activities of the
Mascaler© Apache Tribe on or off of the reservation and to
whatever extent the Secretary of the Interior desires to
exercise such control.
Certainly the Tribe is more closely controlled than
any Indian trader or individual Indian allottee and certainly
under the Indian Reorganization Act, the revolving loan fund,
and other statutes, profitability of the Indian venture is
certainly one of the purposes and one of the goals that is
foremost in the minds of the Congress.
We have heard a good deal in the briefs about
abusing the State of New Mexico in its right to tax.

I would

like to respectfully suggest to this Court that most States
also have benefits flowing to them by reason of the fact
that Indians were there before and are still there.
QUESTION:

Would you carry this argument to the point

of denying New Mexico's right to tax the income of Indians
who are earning money working at the ski rim, at the ski
resort?
MR. FETTINGER:
this casa.
think -

That is really beyond the scope of

I do not want to intrude upon McClanahan, but I

16

QUESTION;

I think it's relevant to your case.

HR. FETTINGER:

To income earned on the ski run,

a whole new avenue open.

If the income were earned on the

reservation, the contention in HcClanahan would be that it
was not.

If these are Indian lands, the statute we refer to

is 470 — excuse me, 465 — which provides that such interests
in real estate acquired in this manner are not subject to the
tax.

So we are looking to the statute —
QUESTION:

You’re looking to the real estate.

MR. FETTINGER:
QUESTION:

— and the real estate.

Well, this is taxing simply income, not

real estate.
MR. FETTINGER:

Yes, sir, but in the past this

Court has generally held that when you do not permit the
direct tax, you do not permit the indirect tax.
QUESTION:

So, again, what you say, no tax on the

individual income?
MR. FETTINGER:

I think it should be treated the

same way as income on the reservation proper, sir.

I think

reservations as such are somewhat archaic and would respectfully
suggest that the history

of the development of the reservation

in this case, if this Court were to take judicial notice of
the Executive Orders, you would find that this reservation has
been changed many times.

In fact, the land that is presently

the subject of this controversy, under stipulated fact No. 18

17
of the appendix, we stipulated that the book The Mescalero
Apaches was proper subject for judicial notice*

If you were

so inclined, on page 211 and 212 are recited the facts and
circumstances under which this land was removed from the
reservation and placed in the public domain back about 1882*
QUESTION;

You were talking about Section 465*

Do you see any difference between the possibility of applying
the exemption in that section to the use tax on the one hand
or applying it to the privilege tax in Mew Mexico on the
other?
MR. FETTINGER:

I think in regard to the compensating

tax where it’s directly equivalent to interstate commerce
the arguments might be stronger that it should not apply*

In

regard to the gross receipts tax, we say the argument is
squally as strong.
QUESTION;

I fail to —
Then you see no difference?

MR. FETTINGER:
QUESTION;

Except interstate commerce —

The Attorney General does in his approach,

does see a difference.
MR. FETTINGER;

If the Triba 'is to be taxed, i do

not think the Court's rulings in the past have established
an atmosphere that we play a game to see if the Court can
guess some way that has not been prohibited

from taxing as

opposed to a general prohibition against tax unless specific
authority is given by Congress.

Certainly the preferable view

18

should be that unless authority has been given by Congress
to the State to tax* especially with an Indian tribe where
exclusive jurisdiction has been granted to the Federal
Government and not to the State government by the original
treaty.
QUESTION:

What's your authority for saying that

this Court, has held that income from exempt lands is not
taxable?
MR. FETTINGER:

Income from exempt lands?

Well* sir*

the holding was that the income from reinvested monies was
taxable by this Court.

The income from exempt lands such as

Squire v. Capoeman* for example —
QUESTION:

That was a Federal income tax law.

MR. FETTINGER:
QUESTION:

Yes, but I think in this case ~

It doesn't, have anything to do with

Indian exemption* it just had to do with the construction of
a taxing statute.
MR. FETTINGER:

Well* for example*

the Revenue

Ruling of 1967 provides that the income of tribes generally
is not subject to the Federal income tax* for example.
QUESTION:

That's just again a construction of a

taxing statute.
MR. FETTINGER:
QUESTION:
to reach this income.

Yes* sir, it says —

It says there New Mexico hadn't intended

19

MR. FETTINGER:

Well, thay are excluded from it

because they are not of the nature that is taxed, I think is
the basis of the ruling.

They are not a "person” under that

statute.

And as such they are acknowledged to be something

unusual.

And 1 think all Indian tribes fall in that category.

Fundamentally, I believe we still have to go back to the basic
treaty that recites that it’s

subject to the exclusive

jurisdiction of the Federal Government.
We do not have the Kake argument here.
think Kake applies to this.
QUESTION:

I do not

v

Would it apply if they organized a bus

line to carry passengers from nearby cities where they have
airports to this ski resort?

Would you say the bus line would

be subject to or exempt from taxes?
MR. FETTINGER:

Sir, I would suggest to you that the

protections that are already built into the system which controls
the Indian tribe is very appropriately discussed at this point.
First of all^ any activity of the tribe in so doing would .
obviously need the direct approval of the Secretary of the
Interior.
QUESTION:

Let's assume they got it.

MR. FETTINGER:

If

it had

the authority vested

in it from the Secretary —
QUESTION:
this enterprise

The same authority they got for entering

20

HR. FETTINGER:

Yes, sir.

If the Secretary of the

Interior had given its approval, the executive department
having approved it, if Congress had provided the wherewithal
as they have done hare with a loan, I would suggest that that
is a political decision that generally this Court has left to
the Congress of the United States rather than exercising
itself, and toe protection should be —
QUESTION;

Well, it's a political decision whether

they should be taxed by the State?
MR. FETTINGER:

Yes, sir, if toe purpose of toe

loan is to permit the economic development of the tribe —
QUESTION;

I'm just talking about a bus line now,

not a loan, just a commercial bus line like any other bus
line.
MR. FETTINGER;

Yes, sir, I would suggest that that

would perhaps be an abuse if you are going beyond the
reasonable boundaries
establish-.

that, for example, this Court might

In the first instance, that boundary should be

established by the Congress of the United States or by the
Secretary of the Interior procedurally.

If he authorizes the

Tribe to spend money in doing that, then you have that tacit
approval within the scope of the Congressional authority to
do such act. As I said, this seems to be the political decision
and effectively when do you limit the activities of an Indian
tribe?

21
If I may, I would, like to reserve my last three
minutes for —
QUESTION:
in the last case.

Let me ask you a question that was asked
What does New Mexico provide reservation

Indians by way of services?
MR. FETTINGER:

By contract with the Secretary of

the Interior, certain welfare services are provided.

The

school system in which the Indians participate is conducted
by the State of Mew Mexico through the local school district..
However, on the other side of the coin, Johnson-0'Halley
funds are provided to the State of New Mexico to assist in the
expense of educating these Indian children.

There are other —

Title 815 for the construction of school buildings, Federal
impact money does flow to the State in exchange for providing
these services to the Indians who in fact live on reservations.
If I have any time left, I would like to reserve
three minutes.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Cook.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN C. COOK, ESQ.
FOR THE RESPONDENTS
MR. COOK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
The respondent, considers this case to present two
questions:

Can the State of New Mexico impose its compensating

22

tax on the use of tangible personal property which is owned
by an Indian tribe and which is used by that tribe outside
the boundaries of the tribe's reservation?
The second question presented is whether the state
of New Mexico can impose its gross receipts tax upon the
receipts of an Indian tribe from the operation of a ski
resort exclusively owned by the tribe and located almost
entirely outside the boundaries of the tribe’s reservation.
The taxes at issue here are not taxes on real or
tangible personal property.

The gross receipts tax is

a privilege tax and the compensating tax is an excise tax.
These taxes are measured by the value of the property, the
property being a tribe's gross receipts from its off-reservation
business activity and the value of the material which the
tribe acquired outside of Mexico and used to construct two
ofPreservation ski lifts.
The incidence of the taxes at issue here are not
on real property or tangible personal property.

The compensat­

ing tax on the use of property is not a tax on the property
itself.

I think that principle was established in United

States v. City of Detroit.

The incidence of the gross

receipts tax at issue here is not on real property or tangible
personal property, but rather it is on the tribe’s sal© of
services at the ski resort.

Although the gross receipts tax

is imposed on the seller tribe, it is ordinarily passed on

23

to buyers.
The Enabling Act for Hew Mexico provides in part
that"nothing herein shall preclude the state from taxing as
other lands and other property are taxed any lands or other
property outside an Indian reservation owned or held by any
Indian."

This language indicates an intention or purpose on

the part of Congress to allow the State to tax activities
such as those engaged in by the Mescalero Apache Tribe in
this case.
The Solicitor General in the brief for the United
States as amicus curia® has argued that the use of the phrase
"by any Indian" in exclusionary language of the New Mexico
Enabling Act indicates that this language should be restricted
4

so as not to include an Indian tribe such as petitioner.
Respondents contend that if the language of the
second subparagraph of Section 2 of the Enabling Act is
read as a whole, the implication is clear that the phrase
"by any Indian" refers to an Indian tribe as well as individual
Indians or groups of Indians.

However, even if the argument

of the United States and petitioner is accepted, the jurisdiction
taken by the United States over the Indian tribes under the
New Mexico Enabling Act does not extend to the off-reservation
activities of the petitioner Mescalero Apache Tribe.
QUESTION:

Am I correct, the resort is jammed up

against the reservation?

24
MR. COOK:

Yes, Justice Marshall,it's right beside

the reservation.
QUESTION:
MR. COOK:

On some United States property?
It's on land leased from the United

States Forest Service.
QUESTION:

Well, it's United States property, isn't

MR. COOK:

It's United States property which is

it?

leased to the Indian tribe.
QUESTION:

Could the United States have made that

a part of the reservation?
MR. COOK:
could have or not.

I don't know, your Honor, whether they
They did not.

QUESTION:

Do you knovr any reason they couldn't?

MR. COOK:

I don't know why they could not. have,

but I know that in the facts of this case, they did not.
QUESTION:

But if they had, you agree you wouldn't

have any case?
MR. COOK:

Your Honor, that would be a different

case, and I'm not agreeing that we would not have a case if
this —
QUESTION:

On what basis would you have a case?

MR. COOK:

We say that what's being taxed here is

QUESTION:

Can you put this tax within the reservation?

not —

25
MR. COOK:

Well, we say that that issue isn't

before the Court in our case.
QUESTION:

All right.

MR. COOK:

I'm not speaking for the State of New

Mexico, but I would say if the enterprise was located within
the boundaries of the reservation, the tax could still apply,
but that issue is not presented by this case.
Furthermore, the United States Congress has not
immunized or exempted the Tribe from the taxes at issue here
by reason of 25 United States Code, Section 465.
paragraph of Section 465 states in part:

The last

"Title to any lands

or rights acquired pursuant to," and then it cites certain
reference sections, "shall be taken in the name of the
United States in

trust for the Indian tribe or individual

Indians for which the land is acquired, and such lands or
f’

right shall be exempt from State and local taxation."
This section does not have any application to this
case for two reasons:

First, lands or rights in lands are

not being taxed.
Second, the United States Forest Service lands which
were leased to the petitioner tribe were not acquired by the
United States in trust for the tribe.

The lands belonged

to the United States and wore then leased to the tribe.

The

lands were not acquired in the name of the United states in
trust for the Indian tribe as is required for the exemption

26

under 25 United States Code, Section 465.
The congressional debate on Section 465 indicated
that the purpose of the section was to allow for consolidation
of badly checkerboarded reservations and supplementation of
Indian's stock in grazing in,

forest lands.

25 United States Code, Section 470 established a
$20 million revolving fund and authorized loans to Indian
charter corporations for the purpose of promoting economic
development of tribes and members of tribes.

The clear

implication from the stipulated facts in this case is that
petitioner tribe was organized as an Indian charter corporation.
The tribe acquired a loan under 25 United States Code,
Section 470,and loans under that section were to be made to
Indian charter corporations.
The respondents contend that it is therefore clear
that the petitioner tribe was organized as an Indian charter
corporation.
The intent of Congress in separating its appropriations
for land acquisitions and its appropriation for loans is clear.
Tribal organization and the consolidation of reservations
further the Federal policy of preserving Indian customs and
management of their affairs.

Corporate organization and the

loan fund further the Federal policy of integrating the
Indians into American economic life.

If the purpose of the

Federal policy with regard to the loan fund was to integrate

27
the Indians into the American economic life, entry into that
economic life should be and was intended to be on a footing
of equal competition.
The Mew Mexico Bureau of Revenue recognises that
if the imposition of the taxes at issue here interferes with
the tribe's right to reservation self-government, the tax
must fail.

We think this test is clear from the cases of

Williams v, Lee and Organized Village of Kaka v. Egan. * There
are no facts present in the instant case to show that there
was any interSerene® with the Mescalero Apache Tribe's right
to reservation self-government.

Du® to the absence of such

facts, there is no showing that there is any real current
or even future danger that the tribe's right to reservation
self-government would be interfered with by the imposition of
the taxes at issue here.

Many businesses in the State of

Mew Mexico thrive and still pay the taxes at issue here.

There

is nothing in the record to indicate that the ski resort
operation of the Mescalero Apache Tribe would suffer any
adverse economic consequences as a result of the taxes imposed
here.

Even if this were the case, such an adverse economic

effect does

not without more indicate an interference with

the tribe's right to reservation self-government.

The operation

of the ski resort is not a governmental function, we contend.
It is clearly a proprietary function.
separate and distinct.

The two functions are

If there was any interference, it would

28

be only with the proprietary function of the tribe.
Lastly, the Bureau of Revenue contends that the
Mescalero Apache Tribe is not an instrumentality of the
United States.

Arguments that the tribe is a Federal

instrumentality seem to be premised on the assumption that the
tribe is acting as a virtual ward of the United States
Government in engaging in its off-reservation business
activities.
If the tribe is a virtual ward of the United Statas
Government,then what is the tribal sovereignty and selfgovernment which the petitioner argues are being interfered
with?

The New Mexico Bureau of Revenue contends that the

petitioner cannot be and is not both a sovereign and a
Federal instrumentality.
instrumentality.

Petitioner simply is not a Federal

If the tribe was operating as an Indian

charter corporation, that corporation was not only for the
convenience of the United States.

It was for the benefit of

the members of the Mescalero Apache Tribe.

The corporation

was not organised solely to carry out governmental objectives
of the United States.

The objectives of the tribe and the

tribe acting as a corporation in the operation of the ski resort
would benefit the Mescalero Apache people.

A ski resort

certainly is not essential to the performance of governmental
functions.
The Government of the United States and the government

29
of the Mescalero Apache Tribe will continue to function
regardless of tha existence of the tribe's ski resort.

The

ski resort cannot be regarded as virtually an arm of the
Government.

Therefore, under the test set forth in the

dissenting opinion in Agricultural National Bank v. Tax
Tax Commission and in Department of Employment v. United
United States, the tribe is not a Federal instrumentality.
That concludes my argument.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Cook.

Do you have anything further, Mr. Fettinger?
REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE E. FETTINGER
■f '

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FETTINGER:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In response to the assumption that the tribe is
acting in its charter capacity, I would suggest that Section 25
U.S.C. 482 which authorises the revolving loan funds to be
loaned to constitutional entities should answer that question.
I would like to cite to the Court page 16 of the
Solicitor General's brief wherein it is stated that, "Early
cases considered both the tribes and their lessees exempt
from state taxation of Indian land or income produced from
such land," citing Indian Oil v. Oklahoma, 257 U.S. 501.
And further that, "The immunity from taxation of lessees
of the government was overruled in Helvering v. Mountain

30

Producers Corp., 303 U.S. 376, but the immunity of the
government itself, or of an organised Indian tribe, was not
overruled."
I would like to respectfully suggest that in this
case the income from this ski run, ski resort, goes directly
to the tribe.

It is controlled in its acquisition, it is

controlled in its expenditure far more than anything we have
said here today indicates.

The Code of Federal Regulations

controlling the budget, provisions of the Tribal Constitution
clearly indicate that those controls are absolute.
QUESTION;

Does the Tribe collect State sales tax

at the ski resort?
MR. EETTINGER:

I honestly don't know, sir.

recollection is there is a flat rate.

anything for the tickets that the traffic will bear in a
sense, but even the prices charged are subject to the control

of the Department of Agriculture under 36 C.F.R. 251.2, I
think.
QUESTION;

How about sales tax, State sales tax?

MR. FETTINGER:

I don't believe it is collected.

believe there's sort of an even dollar ticket.

I simply do

not know.
QUESTION;

They must sell food there.

MR. FETTINGER:
they do or don't.

Yes, sir.

I simply don't know if

31
I would respectfully suggest that, the treaty refers
to the nationwide nature of the agreement between the United
?

States Government and the Apaches at that time.

Kagema

carries with it the idea that the Indians are not geographically
limited, or the United States is not geographically limited
in regard to its dealings with the Indians.
And we respectfully suggest to the Court, that the
absolute control over this Indian tribe in this particular
operation is within the scopa and meaning of the statutes of
the Indian Reorganization Act and should by reason of the
fact, that the purpose of this is economic development of the
Indians, and profitability of this venture is significant,
and under the cases decided by this Court, in that line, therefore
should be exempt from State taxes of this sort or generally
from State taxes,period.
QUESTION:

How about Federal taxes?

MR. FETTINGER:

Federal income taxes are covered

by a specific regulation with a case citation, Choate —
I've forgotten what it is right now, sir.

And the tribal

income is not taxable to the tribe, I believe the concept
being that when it passes on, if it was taxable to the tribe
and goes on to the members at some later time, it would be
taxable to the members.

But that doctrine is accepted here

with the low income of the Indians, quite obviously you can
pass along an awful lot of money before you are going to pay

32
any taxes,
This excise tax and gross receipts tax is more
odious than an income tax would be because it goes on gross
income regardless of profitability.

And that, is directly

contrary to the policy expressed —
QUESTION:

The income of the tribe from this ski

resort is not subject to Federal income tax?
MR. FETTINGER;

That would be our contention under

Revenue Ruling 67-285, I think it is sir.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 2:33 o’clock p.xu,, the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.]
