MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next In 72-141, United States Department of Agriculture against
Murry.
Hr. Jones.
•ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEITH A. JONES, ESQ.,
Oli BEHALF OF APPELLANTS
MR. JONES:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
In this ease, like the one which has just: been
argued, the Government is appealing from a judgment of the
District Court in the District of Columbia enjoining enforce­
ment of a provision of the Food Stamp Act on constitutional
grounds.
The provision in question is another 1971 amendment
to the Act.

This one is commonly referred to as the "tax

dependent” amendment.
Generally speaking,

the amendment provides the

household of the young adult who is claimed by his parents
as a tax dependent is not eligible to participate in the Food
Stamp program if his parents,themselves, do not qualify for
food stamp assistance.
I might add, at this point, that in order to take a
child as a dependent for tax purposes, the parent must provide
over one-half of the child’s support.

4
The eight individual appellees here brought this
suit as a class action, alleging that the}? had been excluded
from participation in the food stamp program solely by virtue
of the operation of the tax dependent amendment.
Appellees raise no question of statutory interpreta»
fcion in this case, and they did not contest the applicability
of the statute to their individual cases.
They sought declaratory and injunctive relief solely
on constitutional grounds.
The three-judge court held the provision unconstitu­
tional.
Without closely analysing the language of the statute,
the court assumed that it necessarily acted to deny food stamps
on the basis of invalid taxpayer dependency claims.
The court considered this result to b© so grossly
unfair, in the court’s terms, as to constitute both the denial
of due process and of equal protection.
The court, therefore, enjoined further enforcement
and implementation of the tax dependent amendment.
As we have discussed at some length in our reply
brief, this case presents a threshold question, whether adjudication of appellees5 ■constitutional claims is appropriate
at this time.
It now appears that each, named appellee, may have beer?
denied food stamps solely as a consequence of errors in the

5
administrative interpretation of the tax dependent amendment.
We have set forth our analysis of the statutory
issues in our reply brief, and 1 will not discuss them at
length here.
Stated very briefly, five of the appellees in this
case were denied food stamp assistance on the basis, solely,
of invalid taxpayer dependency claims.
Q

Mr. Jones, is there an administrative remedy provided

for an improper income tax dependency claim?
M&o JOh’-lS:

Wo, there isn't, and it has been the

administrative interpretation of this Act that it does deny
food stamps if the claim of exemption is made, and there is
no inquiry into whether it is valid or invalid.
And that has been the administrative interpretation.
As we point out in our reply briefs, the statute
certainly may, but it doesn't have to be

interpreted in that

way.
The other three appellees —
Q

That being the case, then, the applicants are

helpless, aren’t they, in the face of an invalidly asserted
dependency claim?
MR-. JOWHSj

If the statute is construed as denying

focd stamps on the basis of an invalid claim, then there is no
way for the applicant to establish that their claim is fact,
that the taxpayer claim was, in fact, invalid and that they

o

should receive food stamps.
That is correct.
The statutory language talks merely in terns of
”is claimed” and whether that imports a requirement of validity
is an open question, I would think, at this time.
Q

Well, doesn't that concern you at all?
MR. jo&ES*

Well, it concerns me In the sense that

we have pointed out to the Court that this Court has frequently
interpreted statutes so as to avoid constitutional questions.
If that were the opinion of the Court that the
statute would be invalid, as so construed

construed as

denying food stamps on the basis of invalid claims

then it

would be appropriate for the Court to interpret it as not
denying food stamps in such a case.
And I think such an interpretation would, generally,
accord with the statutory language and would not do it violence.
On the other hand, we have argued that even if it
is construed as denying food stamps on the basis of invalid
claims, the statute is nevertheless constitutional.
We would advance two reasons for this.

In the first

place, Congress could assume that such invalid claims are going
to be comparatively rare.
Wow, there are civil and criminal penalties for
false filing of tax returns, and sureLy in almost all cases
these will deter false dependency claims.

Furthermore, one of tins purposes of the tax dependent
amendment was — the underlying rationale for the tax dependent
amendment was ~~ that through the granting of a tax dependency
dedication, Congress is already providing support, is already
making, in a sense, a payment toward the support of the tax
dependent.
And that payment is made whether or not the claim
is invalid.
So that, for example, if food stamps were issued
to a dependent, or to an applicant, and then those food stamps
were stolen, the Government, presumably, would not be required
to reissue stamps on the basis of private theft of that nature.
And, similarly, we would feel that equal protection
would not require the Government to step in and take care of

dependents who are falsely claimed.
The other three appellees in the case, as we say,
were denied food stamps after they had moved out of their
parents’ households and established their own households.
And, as we have set forth in our reply brief, it
is not our understanding that food stamps should be denied in
such a situation.
We have discussed the statutory interpretation,

We

believe that these three appellees apparently were erroneously
denied food stamps.
Q

The logical end of that argument is that to that

8
extent the case is moot here.
MR. JONES;
Q

That's correct, Mr. Justice White.

X haven’t -- could! the Government take such steps

as would make the case moot, or not?
MR» JOKES:
Q

By issuing —

By other than coming here and telling us that somebody

made a mistake?
MR* JOKES:

Well, these applicants are scattered

throughout the country.
Q

You started to say by issuing food stamps to them

now.
MR. dONESi
Q

That's right.

Well, why don't you do it?
MR. JOKESf

1 suppose if they would come in to

apply for food stamps, we could do that, except for one fact,
Mr. Justice Brennan.
Q

It would sure save us a little time.
MR. JOKES!

Well, we have not conceded, however, that

the statute denies food -«or grants food stamps when the
taxpayer dependency claim is invalid.

We would not issue food

stamps in such a case.
However, as I point out, in order to save the statute,
if it were necessary to do so, the Court could construe the
statute otherwise.
But, in short, as we point out, these appellees may

'«ell be entitled to relief on purely statutory grounds.
In which cases it would not be necessary for this Court to
reach the constitutional claims.
Q

It is like the argument in the previous case.
MR, JCM2S:

Well, they are related cases which this

Court took, together,
I turn now from these threshold matters to a
discussion of the constitutional issues in this case.
The appellees' principal challenge to the statute is
on grounds of equal protection.
The standard of reviewing equal protection cases,
or cases involving challenges to welfare classifications, is
by now well established.
A welfare classification, such ae the one involved
here, must be upheld if it furthers any reasonable purpose
which may be attributed to the legislature.
As this Court reiterated last month in Ortwein v.
Schwab and last term in Richardson v. Belcher and Jefferson
v. Hackney, a legislative allocation of welfare benefits may
be — must be — sustained, if it is shown that the allocation
has a reasonable basis.
And we believe that this tax dependent amendment
does have ouch a reasonable basis.
This amendment

was added to the stood Stamp Act only

after Congress had acquired several years-experience with the

10
administration of the food stamp program.
And during those years, it had become apparent that
although the program generally operated in a satisfactory
manner, it teas subject to some abuses.
And by 1970, many Congressmen feared that unless
these abuses could somehow be

eliminated, the whole program

might be terminated as a result of rising political opposition.
One of the most significant abuses, at least in the
minds of many Congressmen, was the attaining and use of food
stamps by the college age children of higher income families,
and the tax dependent amendment represents the Congressional
response to this general, problem.
The underlying premises of this amendment are that
the food stamp program was not intended to provide welfare
assistance to college students and other young adults who are
being supported by parents who are financially better off.
And also, that when these parenta receive a tax
benefit for supporting their children, they have assumed the
primary responsibility for making certain that that support
is adequate.
In short, through the tax deduction, the Government
has already, in essence, paid for the support of these young
people.

It needn’t provide food stamps as well.

So that the effect of the amendment is to restrict
the coverage of the food stamp program to low income households

11
which have no apparent access to substantial parental support,
and with respect to which no higher income family is obtaining
a tax benefit.
And we submit that Congress had the right to choose
to go this far and no further in the provision of food stamp
assistance.
Appellees' equal protection argument apparently is
based on the general claim that even if this statute was
generally effective in eliminating the abuses with which
Congress was concerned, it's nevertheless unconstitutional
insofar as it denies food stamps to certain needy households.
We concede that some needy households may be denied
food stamps, but we don't invest that fact with constitutional
significance.
First, I think it is appropriate to point out that
the appellees seem to have exaggerated the effect of this
amendment.
They have propounded a variety oiv hypothetical

;

cases, but they have failed to show that the amendment will,
in fact, bar assistance to significant numbers of needy house»
holds.

To the contrary, Congress could reasonably assume
that very few truly poor households contain a young adult who,
in fact, is receiving more than half of his support from a
parent who is not himself poor.

12
Congress could determine that parents who receive
the tax benefits of a dependency exemption have assumed and
are fulfilling their responsibility to support their children.
Secondly, a welfare classification,such as this one,
is not unconstitutional simply because it doesn't reach all
persons who would benefit from welfare assistance.
As this Court has often noted, a welfare classificati?
need not be made with mathematical precision.
Thus, in this case, if the food stamp program fails
to reach all needy households which have no access to parental
support, it is not for that reason alone unconstitutional.
Finally, Congress can limit the coverage of a welfare
program by the use of non-need eligibility criteria.

It needn'fc

restrict itself to the use of need as a sole eligibility
criteria.
Given the many necessary fiscal restraints on
welfare expenditures, Congress could reasonably determine that
if children of higher income parents, when the parents them­
selves are enjoying tax benefits from supporting their
children, are needy, that*s primarily the responsibility of
the parents, and perhaps also of the children if they axe
voluntarily unemployed.
But it is not necessarily — it is not constitutionali
the responsibility of the Government.
Congress has paid for the support of these children,

13
In a sense, through the tax reductions.

It doesn’t have to

provide food stamps, as yell.
Appellees* claim, in essence, is that the Government
should be required to pay twice for their support, once,
through the tax deduction, and then a second time through
food s tamps.
We see no reason — tax exemption, that's correct,
Q

As a practical matter, how, again, does this work?

Does every member of an applicant household have to fill out
a form and swear to it that he has not been claimed as a
dependent by a parent?
MR. JGMS:

I think the head of the household fills

out the form,and the form requests Informstion about whether
a parent of any of the IS and older people in the household
Is providing support, and, if so, if they are taking the
young person as a tax exemption.
If the applicant answers, "We don't know whether
they are taking us as an exemption, they are providing
support," this is a hypothetical

then the administration,

Food and nutrition Service or the State agency administering
the plan sends to the parent a form which the parent must
fill out.

And the parent must state whether or not he is

providing support and whether or not he is now claiming the
child as a tax dependent.
Q

You don't mean "now claiming."

This is something

that's done once a year.

By most people, dn of before April

15th.
MR. JOKES:

Well, that's when they file their tax

return.
0

,
Well, that's when you make the claim, too.

That's

when you get the exemption.
MR. JOKES;

Well, that's not the way it has been

administered and I think, rightly so.
You can make a claim of tax dependency simply by
filling out the W-4 form, which asks, "Do you have any
dependents?"

"Are you taking any dependents?"

And, for

withholding purposes, therefore, you've made the claim.
Furthermore, I think that when the parent fills out
the form that's sent to him from the State agency, that he
is, in fact

making a claim there for purposes of the food

stamp program.
Q

Well, — but that's not.

MR. JOKES:

The statute talks about

The statute talks in terms of "is

claimed," and we contend that "is claimed" refers to any claim
that the taxpayer makes, whether it is on the withholding
statement or in the form provided to the food stamp adminis­
trator.
So that it is a contemporaneous claim which enables
the food stamp program to oe administered on a current basis.

15
The appellees argue fco the contrary, that, in fact,
it is never done this way, hut that is the common method of
a drain is tra t icttt.
Q

It is the -MR. JOKES:

Common method of administration.

At the time of the application you send out the
parents a request which they respond to.
Q

And that's only if —
MR. JOKES:

That7s only if the information provided

by the applicant suggests the possibility that there is a tax
dependent.
Q

If he: says no, is that accepted?
MR. JOKES:

Generally, I think it is accepted,

although there is some evidence, I think, in the Appendix,
that in cases where it looks suspicious they will nevertheless
request that the parents5 address be provided and the Food
Service does make an inquiry in those cases as well.
9

1 would suspect that in the majority of cases an
answer of no is accepted.
Q

And if he says yes, of course, that Is accepted

because that makes them ineligible.
MR, JOKES:
Q

Iliat5s right.

And, if he says, 8'I don't know.

My father and I

haven't been on speaking terms for the last three years,*'
then, and only then, or under such circumstances, the agency

16
communicates with the parents, does it?
MR. JOKES:

Well, it is ray understanding that even

if the applicant responds, "yes," that there is a form sent to
the dependent's parents.
I really can't speak on that with certainty.
Q

I suppose you could have a case in which the

father is separated from the household and is paying $30 or
$50 a month for the support of the child, and yet not take
the deduction.
MR. JOKES:
Q

That's correct.

So that the answer of the mother that, "Yes, he is

paying support," that's the basis —
MR. JOKES:

Well, no, on that basis, they

would not

be denied food stamps.
Then a further question is asked, "To your knowledge,"
is the ta:rpayer taking the child as a dependent.
Q

And the mother says, "Ho," then what happens?
MR. JOKES:

I suspect.

Well, it depends upon the administrator,

The administrator could simply accept that answer,

or he could make a further inquiry of the father.
Q

Because it's got to appear that the father, in fact,

is taking the deduction.
MR. JOKES:
Q

That's correct.

Before the food stamps are denied, isn't it?
MR. JOKES:

That would certainly be my understanding

17
of how the statute should operate.
How, one of the appellees claims that she was
denied food stamps, even though the taxpayer was -*- just
couldn’t be found, but we are not here to support every
sivigle act of the administrators in the separate States.
And I think, in some cases, since this is a new
program, there obviously are problems which have to be worked
out.
Q

Mr. Jones, is there any indication, in this record,

as to whether the claims for exemption that were concededly
invalid were ever uncovered by a tax auditing processor
before or after the suit was brought?
MR. JOKES:

Nothing in the record suggests that,

Mr. Justice Rehopu1st.
I would point out that under Section 6103 of the
Internal Revenue Code, tax returns could be obtained by the
Secretary for spot check purpose.

I think that it was

represented in tie court below that that bad not been done
as of that time, and I don’t know whether it has been put into
effect, whether the Department of Agriculture has instituted
such a spot check program, but it could be done.
Q

So far as this record shows, then, the people who

filed erroneous claims of exemption have obtained the
benefits of those claims in the tax area, is that right?

MR.

JOKES:

That’s correct.

It
To summarise our position on the question of equal
protection, we feel that there is a distinction between tax
dependent households and other households.
Tax dependent households have a higher income parent
who receives a tax benefit for assuming the responsibility of
supporting his child, in the tax dependent household.
Other households have no such advantage.
Congress could reasonably discriminate between these
households, as it has done in this amendment.
Appellees raise one other constitutional claim,
which they phrase in terms of procedural due process.

They

contend that the amendment amounts to an abritrary presumption
that they are not

needy.

And they would like to have a

hearing to show that they are needy.
But the statutory criteria do not include need,
as such.

For example, the statute makes no pretense of

providing, or attempting to provide, all the needy persons with
nutritional assistance.
For example, most households without cooking facili­
ties are denied any assistance under the act, no matter how
needy they may be.
Congress was not concerned with need in enacting this
amendment.

It was concerned with the problem of the double

benefit involved with tax dependents.
Therefore, we feel that this purported procedural

19
due process question is really just a broad claim that
Congress may not establish eligibility criteria, based on
any considerations other than need alone, that such a claim
has nothing to do with due process.
If anything, it would be a suustantive due process
claim of the Congress this Court has long since rejected.
But insofar as it could oe viewed as an equal
protection claim, then it is clearly erroneous.

Because,

as this Court settled in Dandridge v. Williams, the equal
protection clause does not prohibit the use of welfare
eligibility criteria based on factors other than need.
He ask that the judgment below be reversed.
I'd like to reserve ray time for rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Jones.

Mr. Pollack.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD R. POLLACK, ESQ.,
ON BEHAIS OF APPELLEES
MR. POLLACK:

Your Honor, I would like to concen­

trate at the outset bn the/appellant's novel claim, and that is
the question that there is no standing by any of the
appellees in this case.
Appellees would like to seek to avert a decision on
the constitutionality of the statute because they say that
the statute was improperly administered rather than the
statute itself violates equal protection.

20
In order to do this» they raise two new interpre­
tations of' the statute, interpretations of the statute that
differ from the way they interpreted the statute in the
District Court, In fact, an interpretation that is different
from the way they interpret the Act currently.
They say that a fraudulent tax claim may not
necessarily disqualify people in a dependent household.
Well, Your Honor, it is absolutely clear that the
statute, itself, disqualifies a household containing a
dependent even if that dependent was claimed fraudulently.
If you look at the statute, the statute says very
clearly any household which includes a member who has reached
his eighteenth birthday and who is claimed as a dependent
child for Federal Income Tax purposes by a taxpayer who is
not a member of an eligible household, shall be ineligible to
participate in any food stamp program established pursuant to
this chapter,during the tax period such dependency is claimed
and for a period of one year after expiration of such period.
Appellants admit that their reading of the statute
is that a fraudulently claimed dependency household is
eliminated from the food stamp program.
In fact, that's the way they currently administer
the program.

If this case was reversed, this is precisely

the way the program would continue to operate.
Appellants forget that the Court should give

21
deference to an administrating agency's interpretation of the
statute,
And this is precisely the way the Department of
Agriculture interprets the statute.

Their regulations

eliminate fraudulently claimed dependent households.

Their

instructions eliminate fraudulently claimed dependent households.
.In fact, the Acting Administrator of the Food and
Nutrition Service, Mr. Howard Davis, in his affidavit, and
you will find that on page 83 of the Appendix, he says there
are no factual issues to be presented or challenged other than
the issue of whether or not a member of the household has
been claimed as a dependent child.
In fact, appellant's argument,in the District
Court, was that it is illegal to check into the tax returns.
They said that disclosure to the dependent or to the food
stamp office as to whether the claim was proper or improper
is impermissible under the tax statutes.
You will find that statement in Appendix B to our
brief, pages 22-B through 24-B.
However, even if this Court wanted to fictionalize
the interpretation of the statute and change the way this
agency, the Department of Agriculture, has interpreted this
provision from the outset, there would still be five appellees,
at the very least, who would still be harmed by the operation

22

He is supporting them on a small

She receives all her income from this ex-

husband and her ex-husband, appropriately, has claimed her
as a tax dependent.

Consequently, she has standing.

Mow, appellant has said that the food stamp
benefits she gets, that those food stamp benefits should be
included in the determination of whether the household
receives more than 50% of its income from the claimant.
q

If I may just interrupt you, excuse me.

I thought

that this statute only had to do with dependents who were
children, not ex-spouses.

It says, "claimed as a dependent

by a parent or guardian."
Now, an ex-spouse is certainly not a parent isnd I
would suppose not a guardian either.
MR. POLLACK:

Yes, however, everyone in the house­

hold is denied food stamps.
In other words, as a result of the fact that there
is a person over 16 years of age in Mrs. Murry's household
who is claimed ao a tax dependent.

23

Q

Who is fcha t person ?
ME. POLLACK:

of age

There is a young child,, eighteen years

X think bis name is Jordan Murry -- and that child

has been claimed -Q

It is not the mother?
MR. POLLACK:

Q

That’s correct.

The mother gets the income from the husband, from

her ex-husband.
MR. POLLACK:

But everyone in the household is

denied food stamps,
Q

Because the child is claimed?
MR. POLLACK:

Q

X see.

I misunderstood you.

MR. POLLACK:
Q

That’s correct.

Now, appellants in this State —

You are making no point of the claim of the grand­

child in that case as a dependent.
MR. POLLACK:

That's correct.

The statute operates only because one of the
children was claimed as a tax dependent, not because one of
the grandchildren was claimed as a tax dependent.
The appellants would have us believe that because
Mrs. Murry has received some food stamps that those food
stamp benefits should be included in determining whether the
taxpayer who made the claim has given b0% of the income.
However, if you look at the statute, the statute is

24

very clear on this Issue,
Look at Section 2016(c) of Title 7.

It says,

"The value of the coupon allotment provided to any eligible
household which is in excess of the amount charged such
households, that such allotment shall not be considered to
be income or resources for any purposes under Federal or
State laws, including, but not limited to, laws relating to
taxation, welfare and public assistance programs."
The only provision that the appellants cite to the
contrary is a tax ruling, which they cite at page 3, Note 1.
That ruling, however, has absolutely no application
to that case -- to this case.

That ruling merely refers to,

and I quote, "State benefit payments measured solely by
recipient's needs.”
These are not State welfare benefits.
Federal benefits.

These are

All of the benefits are subsidised by the

Federal Government.
At the very least, Your Honors, there are five
appellees who are not harmed because of the wrongful adminis“
tration of this statute.

They are harmed because of the

statute itself.
Appellants

-- under new statutory interpretation ~«

is that they say for the provision to operate, you do not
have to have been outside the taxpayer claimant's house during
part of the,tax year.

25
They say if you were outside of the household
during the carryover year, the year a£ter the period for which
the tax dependency was claimed, but you were not outside the
household during the period for the tax dependency claim,
then you should not have been denied food stamps.
However, even if this new statutory interpretation
was accepted by the Court, every single one of the appellees
in this cane would still be harmed by the operation of the
statute.
It is clear that this case is not moot.

It is a

very live controversy.
Turning to the merits of this case, it is clear that
this provision was designed to eliminate non-needy households
from the food stamp program.
However, the tax dependency provision is not reason­
ably related to that purpose at all.
As District Judge Hart said — .

He said elirainating

the voluntary poor from the program, or those people who have
access to nutritional adequacy, that operation really requires
the utilisation of a surgeon's scalpel.
And what was done with this statute was Congress
wound up using a meat cleaver and started eliminating the
needy people from the program, not the unneedy from the
program.
The statute completely missed in its statutory

26
objective,
The tax dependency provision is wholly unrelated
to an assessment of a household's current need.

Although the

entire food stamp program operates on the basis of current
circumstances, the provision is not at all related to what
one's current circumstances actually are.
But the program works on the oasis of current
circumstances -Q

When did Judge Hart say that?
1®. POLLACK:

You will find that, Your Honor, at

page 50 of my brief.
It is in the footnote and in the text.

There are

two different statements that he made.
Q

Is that: part of the opinion?
MR. POLLACK:

Ho, that's not part of the opinion.

That was part of the oral argument in the District Court,
and I have provided in Appendix B the transcript of that
oral argument, and I quoted therefrom.
This program operates on the basis of current need,
it is clear.
Certification periods are very short.

Certification

periods are essentially three months under this program, and
the purpose of that is to make sure that there is an assessment of what the current circumstances of a household are.
If you are eligible on the basis of current income,

27

or if you have current resources that make you needy, then you
are eligible for the food stamp program.
Similarly, even if you refused to qualify under the
work requirement previously, if you are now willing to comply
with the work requirement, you are eligible for food stamps.
Clearly, the program operates on the basis of current
circumstances.
Well, this provision is not at all related to an
assessment of an individual's current need.

In fact, contrary

to what the appellants have indicated, this provision operates
on the basis of a tax dependency claim that is made in April
or March of the tax year.
In fact, they so indicated — you will find that
in tiie Appendix at page 81 — when they gave an example of
how the provision operates.
way

And you will also see that's the

they claimed the way the provision operates.

And that's

in our Appendix to the brief, Appendix 17-B.
What happens is you are denied food stamps on the
basis of a tax dependency claim that is made in April or
March, subsequent to the period of the tax year for which you
are making the claim.
Consequently, when the claim is made,the tax year is
already over.

The period is an entire nullity with regard

to the tax year for which the dependency claim is made.
You have received food stamps during that year.

21
In other words, the provision only operates during
the subsequent year, the so-called carryover year.

And the

provision rigidly denies you food stamps during the year
after the period for which the dependency claim is made.
In fact, all of the appellees in this case were
denied assistance during the carryover year, not the year
for which the dependency claim was made, but during the
carryover year.
In fact, everyone is essentially affected exclus­
ively during the carryover year.

And the tax dependency claim

has absolutely no relationship to what Is occurring in that
carryover year.

At best, it has some relationship to what

happened during the preceding year for which the tax dependency
claim was made.
But, Your Honors, I think what is even more impor­
tant is that a tax dependency claim has absolutely no coroiation to a household's actual availability of income.
And that's because under the tax dependency pro­
vision, there is no minimum support that need be provided.
You only need to provide over 50% of your income.
In other words, if a household has absolutely no
income at all, and a taxpayer gave one dollar to that house­
hold, then the taxpayer has a right to make a tax dependency
claim for that year.
Despite the fact that that household has only one

29

s dollar of Income for that entire year, they are denied food
stamps because they were taken as a tax dependent and, in fact,
properly so, because they gave over 50% of the income.
If that household has absolutely no access to
nutritional adequacy, for non-students, this provision is
entirely arbitrary.
In order to be declared a tax dependent, a non­
student must have income under $750.

If a non-student has

incorae over $750, you cannot claim them as a tax dependent.
Consequently, if you gave more than $750, you can
declare a non-student as a tax dependent.
And, you can see, if you accumulate

the student's

income, or the non-student's income, and the amount provided
by the taxpayer, it still provides you far short of the standard
•ft f*

>

of need
.

that are established by the appellants in this case.
Take as an example the

8i'x-person eligibility

standard under the food stamp program.

For a six-person

household to be eligible for food stamps, you must have an
annual income of under $6,084.
Clearly, a non-student -- there is a very sub­
stantial likelihood -- in fact, there is a probability that
a non-student who is claimed as a dependent is still needy
under the appellant's own standards.
Nevertheless -~

Once you are over 19, it does.

You can never demonstrate, throughout the entire
administrative process, that you have absolutely no access

Obviously, she cannot purchase a nutritionally

She cannot live without receiving some kind

of assistance.

She needs the food stamp program.

she had been receiving food stamps before.

Indeed,

She had been

31
receiving $128 in benefits, and she was paying for that only
$11.

That was what permitted her to survive.

But, because

of the fact that her ex-husband has claimed one of their
children as a tax dependent, everyone in the household is
denied food stamps.
It is presumed, in essence, that that family has
access to adequate income to purchase a nutritionally adequate
diet.
Take, as an example, Appellee Schults.
Schulta lias absolutely no income whatsoever,
a single penny income.

Appellee

She doesn't have

In fact, she had been in a hospital

for four months suffering from malnutrition, because all she
was living on was wild sweet potatoes and water.

And she

has been in a hospital and very sick because she did not
have access to nutritional adequacy.
Nevertheless, because she was taken as a tax
dependent in the previous year, and despite the fact that
she receives no assistance during the current year, she is
denied food stamps during this current year, so-called carry­
over year.
Your Honor, the one year carryover period is also
extremely rigid.

Even if one can convincingly demonstrate that

the taxpayer cannot provide any support whatsoever during this
carryover year, one is still denied food stamps, by virtue
of the tax dependency claim of the previous year.

32

Even if one can convincingly demonstrate that one
is not going to be taken as a tax dependency claim for this
year., one is denied food stamps during the carryover year.
In fact, even if one swore that — taxpayer swore
that a dependency claim is not going to be made in the carry­
over year, people are denied food stamps during that carryover year.
It’s a very rigid provision.

You are denied food

stamps during that carryover year.
Take aa an example, Appellee Joe Ben Valdez.

His

father took him as a tax dependent in the previous year.
m

It is a five-person household that his father is the head
of.

They have $450 of income, of which they have $497 of

expenses because they have very substantial debt.
Mr. Valdez has diabetes and an ulcerous condition
and he cannot provide any support for the tax dependent house
hold.

Nevertheless, appellee's household was denied food

stamps. Even though they can convincingly demonstrate that
no tax dependency claim will be made this year, even though
they can convincingly demonstrate that no support at all is
being provided this year, they are denied food stamps.
Q

I guess, then, if somebody takes the tax dependency

andlitnd out that it is false and he goes to jail, the family
would still be penalized?
MR. POLLACK:

That’s correct.

33
There * g no remedy whatsoever.

And what makes that

even clearer, Your Honor, If yon take a look at our Appendix

So that in the situation that you raise, Mr. Justice
Marshall, even, let us say, there is a fraudulent tax claim,
the father is in jail, it is clear that he made a fraudulent
tax claim, it is clear that the household is denied food
stamps solely because of his fault.

There is just nothing that

can be done to help the tax dependent household.

MR. POLLACK:

Excuse me?

Granting all of that, that’s not grounds for knocking

the statute out, is it?
MR. POLLACK:

Ho.

What I am saying, however, is

it is not reasonably related to any purpose.

Q

However, -~

Have the statutes never been saved by that process?
MR, POLLACK:

Well, Your Honor, what in essence

you are doing, is you are saying the provision is so
irrational that, therefore, we are going to try and legislate
it and make it rational.
The whole equal protection argument that we are
making is that -~
Q

That doesn’t answer my question.
i

My question was: have statutes never been saved by
that precise process?
MR. POLLACK:

I don’t know of an instance, Your

Honor, where both parties agree on what the statute says,
and the court wound up coming up with a new interpretation
of the statute just to save the statute*
Q

Take a look at Tilton v. Richardson sometime when

you have a free moment, decided last year.
MR* POLLACK:

Okay.

Your Honor, even if you read into the provision
that a fraudulent tax claim does not deny food stamps, that
that isn't a proper administration of the statute, I would
still say that the statute is arbitrary.

There is no

35
implication, whatsoever, that because a tax dependency claim
was made that the tax dependent’s household has access to
nutritional adequacy.

As
at all.

I indicated before, if a household has no income

whatsoever.

She has no income

If her parents gave her merely $1 then they could

properly claim Kristi as a tax dependent.

And, as a result of

merely $1 per year, she would be denied food stamps.
Even if she can show during the carryover year that
she is not going to be claimed as a tax dependent, she

is

going to be denied food stamps.
Your Honor, it seems to me that this carryover
provision, this one year carryover, even when one can show
that one will not be taken as a tax dependent during that
carryover year, is essentially the same kind of blunderbuss
one year ineligibility system that was scored in Shapiro v.
Thompson.
Shapiro v. Thompson you also indicated that that
provision, the one year durational residence requirement,
would have been invalid in the traditional equal protection
standard.
Under the traditional equal protection standard,
I would submit that this case is stronger than the one in
Shapiro, for the reason that in Shapiro the one year inelig~
ibility at least served a purpose.

It served the purpose of

36
deterring fraud.
Here, the one year carryover provision serves no
purpose whatsoever.

The one year carryover provision is

rationalised by the appellants with only one reason.

They

claim that it is the only practical means to determine whether
tax dependency claim will be taken for the carryover year.
But, in fact, tho provision does not operate as such.
By the end of the carryover year, December 31, the
income tax for that year has not been filed.
filed three months subsequently.

They will be

So that, even at the end

of the carryover year, you cannot determine whether a tax
dependency claim will be made in that carryover year.
Q

You can in some cases, can’t you, lir. Pollack, xdhere

the statement has been filed at the beginning of the year
for the deduction purposes?
MR. POLLACK:

For withholding purposes.

For withholding purposes, that does

not require you to take a dependency claim.

Quite the

contrary.
Q

Doesn’t require it, but permits it, does it not?
MR, POLLACK:

Honor.

It may be an indication, yes, Your

But, certainly, if you felt that was an indication,

why should one rigidly deny food staaips during the carryover
year when one has indicated in onefs withholding statement
that you are not making a tax dependency claim during the
carryover year?

37
And yet, even if you indicate, in your withholding
statement, that you are not going to take a tax dependency
claim during the carryover year, you are still denied food
stamps during, that .carryover year.
It seems to me you operate one way or another.
Either you indicate that their withholding statement is a
true indication of a dependency claim or it is not.

If it

is, then there is no reason to deny food stamps during the
carryover year when an indication has clearly been made that
you are not going to make a dependency claim during that
carryover year.
Q

Could the statute be saved there, again, by

invalidating of that provision on the carryover year?
HR. POLLACK;

Your Honor, if you wish, to strip all

the arbitrary features of the statute, that would be fine,
because then we wouldn't have a harmful statute.
However, the statute is clearly irrational for
numerous reasons, not the least of which is that the tax
dependency claim assumes no income whatsoever.

It doesn't

assume any minimum amount at ail.
As I have indicated —
Q

Generally, a person wouldn't claim a dependency

unless he had to file an income tax return, and he wouldn't
have to file an income tax return if he didn't have income.
Wouldn't that be true?

31
ME. POLLACK:
Q

That’s correct.

So it does assume -- presuppose -- income on the

part of the parent or guardian.
ME. POLLACK: Yes, that’s right.
Q

Then I misunderstood you, I guess.
MR. POLLACK:

he does have income.

Ho, the parent — it is assumed that
It is also assumed that the person has

some income because he is not eligible for food stamps if
his income may be slightly above the income eligibility
criteria, as with Appellee Valdez.
Q

Well, is your argument that any Federal statute

that you think — that the Court would find irrational is
unconstitutional?
MR. POLLACK:

q

Your Honor, I think the inquiry that -**

I mean your argument here has just been irrationality
MR. POLLACK:

Well, what I am trying to make clear,

I think, is that this statute has no reasonable relationship
to any legitimate governmental purpose.

There is only one

legitimate governmental purpose, that the government Is here
— that the government here is hypothesizing, and that is
that it eliminates from the program those people who have
access to adequate income.
What I am indicating, Your Honor, is that this
provision does not have this reasonable relationship to it.
Q

So this is a straight due process argument that any

39
statute that doesn’t implement a legitimate aim is ~~
MR. POLLACK:

That is not reasonably related.

And this provision is not reasonably related,
Q

This isn’t the Federal brand of equal protection

argument that you are talking?
1®. POLLACK:

Your Honor, yes, except

it falls

under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.
Q

I understand that.

I

said a Federal brand.

Who

are the two classes then?
MR. POLLACK:

Well, one class of individuals here

is a group of people living in a household where no one has
been claimed as a tax dependent.

q

Right.
MR, POLLACK:

The other one is where there is some

one who has been claimed as a tax dependent where that
dependent is over IB years of age.
And the one group is disqualified, the other group
is not disqualified.
Q

Can you imagine any situation in which the applica

tion of that rule would be justified?

Aa applied in a

particular case that you can imagine?
MR. POLLACK:

It would have to oe purely by

coincidence, Your Honor.
Q

X just asked you if you could imagine one.
MR. POLLACK:

If, by coincidence, someone did have

40
adequate income, access to adequate income, then if 1 could
imagine -Q

Well, what if Congress thought that that situation

happened often?

MR.
Q

POLLACK:

Well, that

Would you strike it down and just say that this

provision is invalid, because many cases the person doesn't
have access to adequate income?
MR, POLLACK:

Your Honor, I'm not saying that the

purpose is impermissible.

I am saying the purpose is fine,

I am just saying that this provision is not reasonably
related to that purpose.
Q

Well, you said that in some instances it would be

perfectly related if there -MR. POLLACK:

Right.

If we said, as an example,

that all people who are left-handed should be denied food
stamps because Congress, for some reason thought that lefthanded people have access to adequate nutrition, X could
imagine some circumstances where a household containing a
left-handed person -Q

And Congress decided to use this,that left-handed

people so often had access to adequate income that we are
going to say just left-handed people aren't qualified under
the food stamp program.
And you would say that would be unconstitutional.

41
MR. POLLACK:
Q

That's correct.

What if Congress had had a report here in which they

said fcheir studies and searches indicated that a very large
number of people for whom a deduction was taken actually
receive an average of $1,000 a year support from the person
taking the deduction for them?

Would the statute then serve

a valid purpose?
MR, POLLACK:

Well, Your Honor, even under your

hypothetical, the tax dependent is still needy under

the

appellant's standards.
Q

Well, does it serve a valid purpose if that's the

finding of Congress?
What is the deduction now, $750?
MR. POLLACK:
Q

$750.

For every $750, their study showed in some way that

$1,000 was actual3.y given by way of support by the person
claiming the deduction, and representing more than half of
the income?
MR, POLLACK:

Your Honor, it would seem to me that

since the entire basis of this provision assumes that those
people who have been taken as a tax dependent have access to
adequate income, it would seem to me we would at least have
to make some reasonable search to determine whether, in fact,
that's true.
Q

In each case?

42
Ml. POLLACK:

Mot in each case, but: I think it is

so clear as to how this provision operates.

The provision

clearly operates even if no support is provided, even if
$1 is provided.
You just take a look at the appellees themselves,
and 1 think you can show that there is a very substantial
likelihood, even more than a substantial likelihood, that
persons who have been taken as a tax dependent have no
access to nutritional adequacy, while those people who have
not been taken as a tax dependent, let's say children of
a millionaire parent, are still allowed to participate in
the food stamp program.
In short, I believe that this provision violates
equal protection.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Pollack.

Mr. Jones, do you have anything further?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KEITH A. JONES, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS
MR. JGMES;

Yes, X do, Mr. Chief Justice.

The appellees have focused on the need of the
applicant household, and it is understandable why they would
do that.

Those are their clients.
Congress, however, is concerned about the cost

of the welfare program.
As I have pointed out, Congress has already made a

payment in order to provide for the support of tax dependent
households.

Xt lias made it through the tax system, as a

tax deduction,
Q

Exemption.
MR. JOKES:

Exemption,

Yes. Mr. Justice Stewart.

Therefore, those households are different from
households for which no tax exemption is provided.
Congress was concerned about the problem of double
benefit.
Appellees pay no attention to this problem and
insist that the statute has no rational basis because some
needy people are eliminated.
But the rational basis is the problem of double
benefit which Congress,understandably, wanted to limit or
eliminate.
Furthermore, X would point out that appellees,
in their briefs and here have simply and flatly misstated
the application of the program.
A tax dependent's household is denied food stamps
during the year of the tax dependency claim, and not just for
the following year.

There is a carryover provision.

Congress

believed that the filing of the tax return would certainly be
corroborative evidence that could be used in furthering the
purposes of this provision.
They could presume that parental support, under most

44
circumstances, would lie continued.

But the primary denial

of benefits is daring the year a£ the dependency claim.
Q

How do they catch up with that fellow?
JONES:

How do they catch up with that fellow?

If a claim is made in a later year?
MR. JONES:

If, for example, the parent says,

during the year in which the applicant first comes to the
administration, that no, I am not claiming my son as a
dependent and then he files a tax return In the following year
claiming the son as a dependent, then it is unlikely, quite
frankly, that he will be caught unless there is a spot cheek
or a thorough check of the returns of such parents.
Enforcement system, obviously, would not be
perfect, but there would be a mechanism which would b©
