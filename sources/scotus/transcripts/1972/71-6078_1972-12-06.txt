MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

Mr. Turley, you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WXNDLE TURLEY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. TURLEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court;
My name is Windle Tux-ley,

I represent, the appellant

in this case, Linda Shell, individually and on behalf of her
minor child and on behalf of the class of unwed mothers and
illegitimate children in the State of Texas

which she

represents.
The nat'tire of this case is similar to the one just
presented to the Court except it does have a couple of
variations.

It, like the. case just heard, involved what we

contend is an unreasonable discrimination and exclusion of
Texas child support lav^s.
Involved in this instance, however, your Honor, is
the question of the Penal Code Article 602 of the Texas Penal
Code and whether the appellant, has standing to challenge the
District Attorney's exclusion of her rights under that
Penal Code,
The facts which have given rise to this particular
case are basically these;

He refused to do either.
The mother, then, faced with the situation in the

State of Texas where no rights were provided for her under
the common law for support for her child, under the Penal
Code for the support of her child, or under the Civil Family
Code, then requested that a 3-judge court be convened in the
Northern District of Texas, which it was, to hear her
contention that the exclusion of her rights to child support,
for her illegitimate child discriminated against her and that
child in that they had unequal protection of the laws under
the Federal Constitution.
The 3-judge court was in fact convened and did hear
the case.

The court made three findings, your Honor.
One was that they had no jurisdiction to consider

the appellant's contention that the civil statute in Texas
was unconstitutional.
Second, they did find that they were properly
convened, however, to examine the Penal Code in the State
of Texas and her challenges under Article 602 of that Code.
Finally, however, in a divided opinion, Judge Hughes
dissenting, the court found that the appellant had no standing

5

to challenge the unconstitutional — what she contended to
be unconstitutional
Texas Penal Code.

application of Article 602 of the
And,, your Honor, it is from that divided

opinion of the 3-judge court below that we have presented
this direct appeal to the Court.
Thus, there are two issues, I believe, involved
in this case for submission to this Court;
One, with respect to standing, whether the
appellants have standing to challenge on a constitutional
ground the refusal of the Dallas County District Attorney to
entertain her complaint against the father of tills child,
which refusal was apparently based solely upon the fact that
the child was illegitimate.

MR. TURLEY:
QUESTION:

With respect to the — they made no -~
They were not charged with the enforcing

of a penal statute against Mr. Richard D.
MR. TURLEY:

Yes, your Honor, there was some

discussion about that.

And that gets us into exactly what

the standing problem is.
The 3-judge court, the majority opinion

felt that

the standing in this case, the challenge to the penal Code,
should only be brought by the father of a legitimate child
who is prosecuted under Texas law and that he might have a
right to contend that there is an unequal protection of the

7
laws because the lav/ does not apply to the father of an
illegitimate child.
We contend to the Court, however, your Honor, with
%

respect to the standing issue that about. 50 years ago when
the Texas legislature enacted the Article 602 of the Penal
Code, they specifically intended, we believe, at that time
to include all children.

Specifically in the language in its

briefest form, they provided that any parent, any parent, who
shall wilfully refuse to provide the support of his children
shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.
Yes, your Honor?
QUESTION:

How does that contention avail you when

we have the case of Beaver v. State where the Supreme Court
of Texas has put its own interpretation on what the Texas
legislature meant?

Aren’t we bound by that so far as what

the statute means?
MR. TURLEY;

I don’t believe we are, your Honor.

And that's exactly what did happen, however, just a few years
after the legislature enacted that statute, then the Texas
highest court did in fact say in Beaver v. State thaf'children"
used in that Penal Code intended to apply only to legitimate
children.

And thus they excluded the rights of illegitimate

children to recover child support benefits from their fathers.
QUESTION;

No matter what we might think the

statute would mean, we are bound by the construction of that

8

statute, by the highest court of your State.
MR. TURLEY:

I agree, your Honor, that, the common

law interpretation of the courts of the State of Texas, the
Penal Code as interpreted and the civil statute, all exclude
child support benefits for the right of the children.

And I

think it boils down to a matter that the courts and the
legislature in the State of Texas have consistently but
systematically over the many years continued to exclude
illegitimate children from rights of support, the same support
rights that they extend to —
MR.

JUSTICE BURGER:

MR. TURLEY:

I am sorry.

AFTERMOON SESSION
{1:00 p.m.)

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You may proceed, Mr.

Turley.
MR. TURLEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Before the noon recess, we had just examined the
fact that the two basic issues involved in this case deal
with the standing of the appellant to question the action of
the District Attorney in connection with her wrongful
exclusion, what we contend to be wrongful exclusion, from the
child support laws and the Penal Code in Texas, and, second,
the equal protection point.
We had discussed the standing issue to the extent,
your Honor, that we had considered that Texas has enacted a
statute which requires the father of children to support, these
children, and failing to do so, they are subject to a penalty
under the law.

And we have also seen that in Beaver v. State

the Texas Supreme Court interpreted the word "children" to mean
only legitimate children and thereby, by that Court decision,
the judicial ruling excluded from the benefits of the Texas
law the rights of illegitimate children.
I submit to the Court that when Linda Shell, the
mother of the illegitimate child in this case,went to the
Dallas County District Attorney and asked him to please

10
prosecute the father of this child for his wrongful failure
to support the child, and when he refused to do so solely
upon the grounds that, the child involved was illegitimate,
that there occurred an unconstitutional application of what
might have otherwise been a constitutional law passed by the
Texas legislature.
question:

MR.. TURLEY:
QUESTION:

Mr. Turley.
Yes, your Honor.
Focusing just on the merits rather than

standing for the moment,, what you are really asking us to do
is to say that as a matter of constitutional law, a Texas
criminal statute should be applied to embrace a category of
potential defendants whom the Supreme Court, of Texas has said
it doesn't, embrace.
MR. TURLEY:
right.

Isn't that right?
That's correct, your Honor.

That's

Arid failing to do so, there is a violation of the

equal protection of the Federal Constitution.
Advancing then to the standing issue, when viewed
in the light of this Court's decisions in the past 10

years

with respect to standing to raise a constitutional issue,
and summarising five of those decisions very briefly, I think
it is apparent and manifest that there is standing in this
case for this mother to challenge the action of the District
Attorney.
In 1362 in Baker v. Carr this Court considered that

11
a sufficient stake was necessary in the outcome of the litiga­
tion so as to assure concrete adverseness.

And certainly

there is a sufficient stake because the child involved here
is pleading with the District Attorney to have her provided
with a part of economic support for her well-being.

And she's

totally adverse to the position assumed by the District
Attorney in this case.
Second, in Hardin v, Kentucky Utilities in 1968,
the Court considered that the utilities company in teat
instance who was questioning a statutory regulation as it
applied to a competitor was a person within the class to be
protected.
in that

And those, I think, your Honor, are the key words

particular decision.

And as they apply in this

instance, it is abundantly clear that a minor child in the
State of Texas was intended to be protected by the application
of Article 602.
And then, Flasfe v. Cohen in 1969, this Court focused
upon an additional criteria, I believe, v?hen this Court said
that we must look at the individual as he or she might relate
to the litigation and not the issue itself.

Granted, there

is a constitutional issue involved, but how does the person
as a parson relate to that issue?

And when we apply this

child to the issue, to the controversy in this case, we find
that she is personally involved in any controversy with the
District Attorney's office.

And she doesn't participate in

12

that controversy as an ancillary issue or as a mere
interested citizen.

She is intimately involved in any action

she might take,, and thus we meet the criteria of standing
as established in 1969 in Flast v. Cohen.
And then later in Data Processing case arid the
other competitor* cases against Camp which this Court
considered,, there was a discussion of whether the litigant
was within the zone of interest to b© protected.

And I think

it is apparent that we are within the zone of interest that
the legislature intended to protact hare.
And finally, this past year when this Court
considered the Sierra Club v, Morton decision, at which time
it was the feeling of this Court that although the Sierra Club
did not show standing in that instance, there was, on page
733 of that decision, the words of this Court when you said
that an economic injury is a recognized basis for standing.
And it's unquestioned that the denial to this illegitimate
child of the economic benefit of her father constitutes an
economic injury.
Thus, standing in this case, your Honor, is
consistent with prior enunciations of this Court.

But for

a more important reason I submit we should recognize
standing here, and that's because it is right.

It is right

.in consideration of the reasons behind those opinions of
the Court.

It was right in Baker v. Carr that the litigant

13
has standing when that litigant challenged his disproportionate
representation in the legislature.
there with his voting rights.

And you were concerned

It was right when the taxpayer

even, a Federal taxpayer, in Flast y. Cohen said that part
of the. money he is paying in Federal income taxes may be
going for an unconstitutional purpose, and the Court
recognized that he had standing.

And it was right when the

Court said that competitors in the Data Processing case and
the travel agency case and the Investment Company case, all
versus Camp, had a right to challenge and question the.
Comptroller's action in regulating competing banks.
I think it is manifestly right in this instance,
your Honor, that 'the child here who is the sol© recipient of
the economic benefits to be gained by an application of the
Texas Penal Code Article 602 to her father certainly stands
as an injured party sufficient to have standing before this
Court in this case.
Yes, your Honor.
QUESTION:

Actually, Mr. Turley, aren't you really

trying to get at Section 4*02 of the Civil Cede, the inadequacy
of that provision?
MR. TURLEY:

That relates to it, your Honor, and I

think we cannot divorce all of the three — the common law,
the Civil Cod©, and the Penal Code.
the illegitimate.

They all three exclude

And if Article 4.02 provided for support, of

14
the illegitimate, then perhaps there would not be what the
Court has called the insurmountable barrier, and there might
be a possibility of some other alternative, and she would not
be totally discriminated and excluded.

But because Article

4.02 does exclude her., as well as 602, then I think we have
to address ourselves to all three.
QUESTION:

Yet you can't challenge Article 4.02

in this appeal, can you?
MR. TURLEY:
Honor.

I'm not directly challenging it, your

I would submit to the Court, however, that the same

reasons that make the.application of Article 4„02 a violation
of this child's equal protection rights are the sarnie reasons
that make Article 602 of the Penal Code a violation of those
rights.
QUESTION:

But the 3-judge court held that you

couldn't maintain that before the 3-judge court because you
weren't seeking to enjoin any State officer.
MR. TURLEY:

That is absolutely correct, your Honor.

And in that respect we do

there was only 4.02

Could you sensibly bring a

suit to force Texas to have a criminal statute that would

QUESTION:

That’s precisely what you arc trying to

do here, isn't it?
MR. TURLEY:

I ara not specifically complaining

I

QUESTION:

You're saying Texas should make it a crime

to fail to support your children, your illegitimate children.
There just isn't any crime like that in Texas.
MR. TURLEY:

Not exactly.

I am saying that Texas

doss not have to enter into this area at all.

I know of no

reason why Texas -— well, perhaps they should as a matter of
good social policy, provide for the support of all children.
I know of no reason that they have to.
QUESTION:
enjoined?

Do you want the enforcement of 602

I didn't know that's what you wanted.
MR. TURLEY:

No, your Honor, I want the District

Attorney in Dallas County instructed to cease his discrimina­
tory application of Article 602.

QUESTIONS

But they can't apply it to fathers

of illegitimate children unless the legislature makes the
nonsupport by a father of an illegitimate child a crime, can
they?
MR. TURLEY:

Yes, I think they can, your Honor.

I

think this Court
QUESTION:

I thought your Supreme Court had already

construed, contrary to your reading of 602, that statute is
applicable only to the fathers of legitimate children.

Am I

wrong?
MR. TURLEY:

You are absolutely correct, your

Honor, that is what the State Supreme Court said in Beaver v,
State.
QUESTION:

Isn't that interpretation of 602

conclusive upon the 3-judge court just, as conclusive upon, us?
MR. TURLEY:

I don't believe it is, your Honor.

I think that any time, fo© ife a court or governmental agency
or anybody else acting under the cover of law within a State,
discriminates against an’individual to the extent that they
deny them the equal protection of the law, then an issue is

17
raised for this Court's consideration.
QUESTION:

I know what you want.

The prayer that

you asked was they stop the discriminatory application of
602, and you state the Supreme Court has said that 602 can
apply only to the fathers of legitimate children.
MR. TURLEY:

a discriminatory application limited to the fathers of
legitimate children?

be a slight rational basis.

This is a significant proportion of the minor children

Let’s assume for the moment that we

But

MR. TURLEY:
QUESTION:

That’s exactly right.

What i.f w© thought the 3-judge court

was wrong on denying standing with respect to the
constitutionality of 602?

Then we would just say there was

standing and send it. bade, wouldn't we?
I1R. TURLEY:

The Court could do that.

1 would think

the Court, could also dispose of the case, and there is
authority for this, dispose of the case on its merits after
having heard it and had the briefs and everything.
Considering now, if we can, your Honor, with the
test to be applied, not only are we concerned with magnitude in
numbers, but we are. concerned also with the consequence to
the illegitimate children involved in this particular depriva­
tion of economic support.

Obviously, the economic support of

a father affects the child in many ways, and I will not. take
the Court"s time to enumerate them because I think they are
obvious.
But we go a step further.

In a recent article, an

outstanding psychologist, has summarized the problem facing
the illegitimate child perhaps in an even greater way than
the economic problem when he said that to be fatherless is
bad enough in this society, but to be fatherless with the
stigma of illegitimacy can be a psychological catastrophe for
that child.
QUESTION:

Isn’t this argument to be made to a

legislature and not to a court?
MR. TURLEY:
QUESTION:

It can be made to a court, your Honor.
Isn’t that where your real relief lias?

You say you have legislation pending down there.

Your Honor, this argument., the psychological affect.
the social problems involved, was in fact, an argument, that
was made in Brown v. School Board in 1954 and was one of the
points that that, court looked at in reaching its decision in
that case»

So it wouldn't be the first time that a court

has taken into consideration the results or the consequences
of being denied a civil liberty.
But more important, 03: equally important, is the
effect on the coimtiunity as a whole, ycur Honor, of these
particular problems.

We. have to take an analysis of the

problem of illegitimacy and the kind of social life out of
which he comes in order to understand it.

We find that the

lowest economic and education levels within tha community are
those who have the lowest rata of abortions, the lowest rate
of postpregnancy marriages, and the lowest, rate of adoptions
of illegitimate children.

Such that in final analysis the

net additional load of illegitimate children falls heaviest
upon that group in the community who are least able to
accommodate it.

And I think this is one of the reasons that

one-third of the children in the State of Texas

receiving

aid to dependent children are in fact illegitimate children.
The State contends that the paternity laws would be
coercive and hard to apply.

Yet 48 States have paternity

QUESTION:

What happened to the 50th State?

All

counsel this rooming have spoken of Texas and 48 States.

What's

the 50th one?
MR. TURLEY:

I believe that's Idaho, your Honor, and

I can't, tell you why they are the way they are.
Counsel this morning failed to take into considera­
tion the effectiveness of modern blood grouping tests which
almost totally eliminate a good deal of the controversy
surrounding paternity.

With respect, to whether a paternity

exclusion of illegitimate children promotes morality in a
community, that's the old argument that was applied. I would
submit to the Court that the converse is true, that, it in
fact does not promote morality, but. promotes irresponsibility,
such. that, we are faced now with a situation in the State of
Texas where, because of the District Attorney's refusal to
aPPly Article 502, the wrongdoer, the father, goes free and
the innocent victim of the crime, the child, is punished' for
it by not receiving any support.
In consideration of Levy v. Louisiana, Glona v.
American Guaranty, Stanley v. Illinois, and Weber v. Aetna,
all considered opinions of tills Court —
I’m sorry, your Honor.
QUESTION:

No.

I am just wondering.

How can you

blame the District Attorney of Dallas when your State
Supreme Court has said the statute which he has to enforce

26

is of limited application, namely, to the fathers of
legitimate children?
MR. TURLEY:

So far as I know, no District. Attorney

in the State of Texas has taken one of these cases since 1923
If he did take a case and did prosecute it, we could have a
new ruling from the Supreme Court.
QUESTION:

I know, but I just wonder how can you

fault him if the Supreme Court of Texas has told him, "You
may apply this statute only to fathers of legitimate children
Doesn't he have to —MR. TURLEY:

Only to the extent that he is the

enforcer of that law, your Honor, only to that extent.
QUESTION:
bring them?

Wouldn’t it be futile on his part to

He would be dismissed out of hand, wouldn't he,

is long as the Supreme Court of Texas maintains this position
and the Texas legislature stands on that statute?
MR. TURLEY:
from this Court

I think in the absence of a statement

that this kind of discrimination is

invidious discrimination, that it might be futile to bring
that kind of case, and he probably could expect the same
result from the Supreme Court and from the State legislature.
QUESTION:

If we accept your alternative view, he

isn’t going to have to do anything, he doesn't pursue anyone,
legitimate or illegitimate, until your legislature acts.
MR. TURLEY;

There is a qualification on. my

27
alternative which I never have made, and X want to before I
sit. down.

That is that if this Court should strike down the

Texas child support laws, I think that it. should be accompanied
by a mandate that the order would not be effective until the
legislature has had an opportunity to act, and it will convene
in January through May of this next year.
QUESTION;

You

say * declare this statute unconstitu­

tional, but we tell them keep it alive as though constitutional
long enough for you to act?
MR. TURLEY;

That's what a 3-judge' court has done

in San Angelo or San Antonio, I believe.
QUESTION;
MR. TURLEY;

Has this Court ever used that, mechanism?
Not that I am aware of, your Honor,

but I think it could be an effective process.
QUESTION;

You could have had this case dismissed,

you know.
MR. TURLEY;
QUESTION;

What, your Honor?
You could have had this case dismissed.

You still — would you prefer to have 602 declared unconstitu­
tional as of now or not?
MR. TURLEY;
QUESTION;

My first preference is that —
Yes, but let's assume that you don't get

your first preference, then what?

Then say the only alterna­

tive was having 602 declared unconstitutional as of now.
MR. TURLEY;

I think, your Honor, you should do it

28
for the reason that it is unfair and unjust to deny a
significant minority group their rights in order to protect
the rights of

a

majority group.

We have finally come to

a point where we have to do that.
QUESTION:

Do you know of any case in this Court, or

in any Federal court, that has ever held that a State criminal
law was unconstitutional because it did not. go far enough?
MR. TURLEY:
QUESTION:
MR. TURLEY:
Honor.

Because it did not. go far enough?
That’s what, your claim is in this case.
I think the law goes far enough, your '

I'm saying that the interpretation placed upon it by

the court —

Perhaps my question wasn’t clear.

I will

MR. TURLEY:

No.

not found one# your Honor.

I have looked for that and have
And what wa are saying is — what.

I am saying is that this is the infirmity of the position.
Generally, a State official is restrained by injunction from
prosecuting an unconstitutional law.

In this case I am saying

he should be restrained from refusing to prosecute a law
which would grant then the equal rights to citizens —
QUESTION;

Could a bank bring a 3~judge court case

against a State Attorney General because the State had a law

29

that made larseny a. crime but didn’t make embezzlement a
crime?
MR. TURLEY;

I think if a bank found themselves in

a situations your Honor, where the Attorney General was
prosecuting the State law against all the neighboring banks
but refusing to prosecute it against them because their assets
were too high or too low or some other discriminatory basis,
I think they could bring an action.

Yes, I do.

QUESTION:

Well, it wasn't my question, of course.

QUESTION:

Mr. Turley, looking at page 29 of the

appendix which contains your complaint to -the relief requested
when you filed your original action in the District Court, in
paragraph 2, you ask that® declaratory judgment be issued
holding the Texas child support laws unconstitutional in
thair exclusion of unwed parents.

And then you go on in

paragraph 3 and pray that a permanent mandatory injunction
issue, requiring the state of Texas and its state officers
to caase their discriminatory application of child support
laws and that tha defendant be required to pay a reasonable
amount of money.
I don't, at least on the face of your prayer for
relief, see that that really asks that Statute 602 be stricken
down in its entirety.

Would you disagree with ms?

MR. TURLEY:

No, I wouldn't, your Honor.

As I said,

I have contended in the 3-judge court below and throughout

30

these proceedings that, there is no necessity for any court to
go that far, that you have ready available machinery to
simply say to the State, "Cease your invidious discrimination."
And I think if that's all that this Court said, that x^ould
put a stop and bring the proper remedy that we need.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Turley.

Mr. Gauss.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT W. GAUSS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. GAUSS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
I think that it might be well for me at the outset
to talk about this case a little bit from the standpoint of
its present posture and how it got here, what has happened.
This case was originally brought by the plaintiff
and both Article 602 of the Penal Code and Article 4.02 of
the Family Code which was under discussion before noon today
were under challenge, and the constitutionality of those two
statutes was being attacked.
Of course, they relate to the same general problem,
the support of legitimate as distinguished from illegitimate
children.
Nov/, in that case which was brought in Federal court,
a 3-judge court was requested, and the 3-judge court
,

determined

4

at that time that, first, Article 4.02, the civil

31

statute, did not present a question for the 3”judge court
and it was remanded back to Judge Sarah Hughes for her
sole decision.

They then went on to decide that the penal

statute was a proper — the request for a 3-judge court, was
properly exercized as to the penal statute and decided,
however, that there was no standing of these people to attack
that statute.

In other words, the subject matter of the

statute did present a constitutional question, but the parties
who brought the suit, had no standing.
Now, Judge Hughes in her opinion, which is in the
appendix — excuse me, it's in the brief of Mr. Bailey ~~
denied the relief which was requested under 4.02.
As far as I know, we have been made known of no
appeal from that decision of the one-judge court.

So, of

course, as has been pointed out, the only thing before this
Court at tills time is the decision of the 3-judge court that
these people, these plaintiffs, did not have standing to bring
the lawsuit and attack it in the manner in which it was being
attacked.
In answer to a question posed by, I believe it was
Mr. Chief Justice, I'm not sure, on© of the Justices, it
certainly is my opinion that all this Court can do &s far as
the posture of this case is concerned at this time, if they
should decide that fch© 3-judge court incorrectly decided the
standing question, is to send it back and let them go ahead

32

and pass on the case on the merits, because that’s all that's
before this Court.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Gauss, I am not sure I agree with you.

My understanding was that we review judgments below, not
necessarily for the reasons given by the 3-judge court to
dismiss this action.

And if we were to conclude -that it should

be dismissed for different reasons, we might not send it
back.
MR. GAUSSs

I concur with that, your Honor.

possibly didn’t go far enough.

I

I agree, if this Courtvfails

that it should be dismissed, even for different, reasons, ‘there
would be no cause for remand.

But I am saying that if —

what I am trying to say is that if this Court determines that,
the decision of that court based on the question of standing
alone was an erroneous decision, then that is the only tiling
that is before this Court as far as remand is concerned.
If I understand you correctly, your Honor, for
example, if this Court decided that the 3-judge court was
incorrect in their reasoning, but. this Court doos find another
reason for dismissal, certainly it would not warrant a
remand.
QUESTION s
reached?

Including a ground which that, court never

We don’t ordinarily do that, do we?
MR. GAUSS:
QUESTION:

Well, of course —
Perhaps it's all academic because if we

33

found that there wa3 standing, it wouldn't make much
difference whether we remanded it. or not because they could
start all over again.
MR. GAUSS:
it is academic.

I agree with you, your Honor, I think

But the point I tried to retake here is that

the merits of this case are not before this Court at this
time.
QUESTION:

By that you mean the merits of the attack

on Section 602, the constitutional attack.
MR. GAUSS;

This is correct, the constitutionality

of Article 602.
Now, I —*
QUESTION:

They were certainly addressed at very

great length and in detail by the dissenting judge, Judge
Hughes, were they not, General?
MR. GAUSS:

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir, she wrote a very

vigorous dissent.
QUESTION:

She dissented first on standing and

expressed her view there was standing and therefore she
moved to the merits and discussed them fairly and in detail
and expressed her view that this criminal statute was
unconstitutional and further expressed the view that she
would therefore issue a permanent injunction enjoining the
state officials to apply Article 602 in such a way as to
require parents of illegitimate children to provide support.

34

So to that extent, the matter was certainly not ignored in
the 3“judge court.
MR. GAUSS: I agree, your Honor, it was not ignored,
but it is not before this Court in the decision of the 3-judge
court.

The simple decision there was that there was no

standing.
QUESTION:
MR. GAUSS:

Therefore, they didn't reach the merits.
Correct.

Of course, just parenthetically I would disagree
with Judge Hughes in her dissenting opinion.

Actually, I

think what w© need to look at. is really what are they asking
for.

Mow, this is a criminal statute which is under attack,

and they are asking this Court to order a state official to
prosecute a criminal case.

Mow, if it were confined only to

this case, the Court must take notice that the prosecution of
criminal matters is entirely within the discretion of the
District Attorney or th© prosecuting attorney.

He must

investigate, and for any myxiad of reasons, he may determine
that this is not a prosecutable case.
QUESTION:
MR. GAUSS:
QUESTION:

But in this case, he gave a reason.
I am sorry, your Honor.
In this case he gave a reason.

the statute didn't allow him to.
MR. GAUSS:
Marshall

He said

Am I right?

Well, this would

assuming, Mr. Justice

QUESTION:
MR. GAUSS:

What was his reply?
I don't know, your Honor.

He did

decline to prosecute.
QUESTION:

And didn't he give, a reason?

I understood

from what Mr. Turley said, he gave a reason that the statute
didn't allow him to.
MR. GAUSS:
of record.

If so, your Honor, it does not appear

I was not the attorney of record at that stage of

the proceedings.

The record does not reflect, as I recall,

that there was any reason given.

It simply was a domination

on his part to prosecute a criminal matter.
QUESTION:

Where did Judge Hughes get this idea

that he should b© made to prosecute regardless of what the
statute said?
MR. GAUSS:

Well, I think the record will reflect

in that regard, your Honor, that actually this request to the
District Attorney to prosecute this man was in fact made
after the case had been submitted to the 3-judge court, and
it was allowed that they amend their pleadings even at this
stage of the proceedings.
But at the time that the matter was considered by
the 3-judge court, it is my understanding that no request
had even been made, and I don’t know, your Honor, as I say,
I see nothing of record which would indicate what his reasons
ware

36
But, of cou
of reasons.

he could have, as I say, any number

Now, I think it's patent from the record in this

case that the reason why in this case he refused to instigate
criminal proceedings is because the Texas law exempted this
particular man from criminal prosecution by virtue of Beaver
which had been decided way bade in 1923.
QUESTION;
MR. GAUSS;
QUESTION:

1923?
1923, I believe, your Honor.
I know Judge Hughes carried it away back

to 1887.
MR. GAUSS:

Well, I believe Beaver was decided in

1923.
QUESTION:

Yes.

But on the point, she just said

that the Texas courts since 1887 have held that the present
statute does not apply to illegitimate children.
MR. GAUSS:

Well, I think, as far as I have been

able to determine in ray research, the first judicial decision
under Article 602 of the Penal Code as such was the Beaver
case in 1923.

In that particular case, a criminal prosecution

was brought against the father of an illegitimate child and
a conviction was had, and this was reversed by the Court of
Criminal Appeals — this is a technical matter.

The highest

court in Texas in criminal matters is the Court of Criminal
Appeals as distinguished from the Supreme Court, but it was
the highest court in criminal matters.

The Court of Criminal

37
Appeals reversed it simply saying that, this statute when the
word "children" is used, it means legitimate children and it
grafted the word "legitimate" on there.

This is the law of

Texas.
QUESTION:

Has any father of a legitimate child

prosecuted under tills statute ever challenged its application
to him because of this exclusion of fathers of illegitimate
children?
MR. GAUSS:

Mot as far as I know, Mr. Justice

Brennan.
QUESTION:

You would think he would have standing,

wouldn't you?
MR. GAUSS:

I would think that he would.

And this,

of course, I think the 3-judge court felt, that the proper
way to bring this thing into focus is by this person who
stands to bring the prosecution.
QUESTION:

Have there been any prosecutions that

you are aware of since that opinion of the 3-judge court
under this statute against the father of legitimate children?
MR. GAUSS:
QUESTION:

I am not aware of any, your Honor.
I would suppose we are going to get a

challenge to it the very first prosecution that is brought
under- it

now.
MR. GAUSS:

I am sure he ' would.

I am sure he would.

Actually, from my knowledge of the situation, the

38

criminal statute is not very widely utilized as far as
enforcing child support.

And that, gets to another matter.

Counsel assumes, and maybe it is a correct as sin-apt ion, that
the enforcement of this criminal statute would

or I will

put it this way, that failure to prosecute fathers of
illegitimate children deprives this child of a right of some
sort.
QUESTION:

You think enforcement of it gives a

legitimate child a right?
MR. GAUSS:

It certainly would be indirect at best,

your Honor, because -—
QUESTION:

What's the purpose of the criminal law?

It's to influence conduct, isn't it?
MR. GAUSS:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
Your idea is that if you make it a crime

to fail to support your child, maybe people will support, their
children.
MR. GAUSS;

Well, I agree.

I agree that

philosophically that indirectly it i^ouXd have that effect.
QUESTION:

Well, indirectly, then, failing to

enforce it deprives somebody of a right.

I mean, if the

authorities fail to enforce the statute as it is written,
legitimate children perhaps aren't getting what they would if
it was enforced.
MR. GAUSS:

This would be correct, your Honor.

39

QUESTION:

And hence, illegitimate children aren't

getting it either,
MR, GAUSS:

This is correct.

And I might say this,

that as to the argument of counsel, and as far as the social
problems and that sort of thing are concerned, that I
personally would be the first in line to urge the legislature
to change the law.

But this is, I feel, a legislative problem.

It's something — I think that the standing question is very
fundamental.

In Flast this Court said the fundamental aspect

of standing is that it focuses on the party seeking to get
his complaint before a Federal court and not to the issues
he wishes to be adjudicated.
Now, the parties to this case, on the one hand,
are a mother and a child.

On the other hand, the only order

which could be issued to anybody in this case would be to the
District Attorney of Dallas County, I suppose.

And this

certainly would not accomplish the purposes which I submit
that counsel seeks to obtain in this case.

They go on in

Flast and say the question of standing is related only to
whether the dispute sought to be adjudicated will be presented
in an adversary context and in a form historically viewed
as capable of judicial resolution.
QUESTION:

Mr. Gauss, can you help me?

It looks to

me like I don't see any defendant here representing the State
of Texas in these pleadings.

40

MR. GAUSS;

Your Honor, as far as I know, the —

QUESTION;

It says in Section IV of the complaint,

"The Defendant, Richard D."

Well, he is the putative father,

isn't he?
MR. GAUSS;
QUESTION:
Texas.

Yes, sir.
And implied is the Defendant, State of

That’s implied because certain laws and actions of

the State infringe on Federal rights.

So it’s the State of

Texas that’s a party.
MR. GAUSS:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir, but the question —-

Can tills many people — that way you

can make the whole State a party.
MR. GAUSS:

Well, I am locking, your Honor, to the

relief which is sought in this case.
QUESTION:
MR. GAUSS:

That’s right.
And to whom, if counsel is seeking an

order from this Court to the State of Texas that you cease
and desist in the future from refusing to prosecute these
people, I suppose that this would, of course, in Texas the
District Attorney of each judicial district is the prosecuting
attorney.

I’ll take it back.

It would be the County Attorney

because I believe 602 has been changed to a misdemeanor.
QUESTION:

Well, General, under the law of Texas,

can the Attorney General or any State official make a
prosecutor prosecute?

41
MR* GAUSS:

If it3s ever been don®, your Honor, I

don!t know.
QUESTION s
MR. GAUSS:

I mean, does the law allow it?
Not that I know of, your Honor.

The

District Attorney —
QUESTION;

Suppose we issue an order saying that

the State of Texas must prosecute these people, how would it
be enforced?
MR. GAUSS;
your Honor.

I don't know.

This is my question,

I don’t know how it could possibly ba enforced.

The prosecuting attorneys in Texas, the local prosecuting
attorneys, are autonomous.

The Attorney .General of Texas has

no criminal jurisdiction whatsoever, and the District Attorney,
of course, has jurisdiction to prosecute felonies, and the
county attorney misdemeanors.

They are not subservient to

the Attorney General, or as far as I know, any official of the
State any more than they would be just to counsel here who
has brought this action.

I think that he has as much standing

as the Attorney General would have.
QUESTION:
correct?

I am looking at page 39.

Would this be

Apparently, it says on page 39 — this is the colloquy

between Mr. Bailey -- who is he?
MR. GAUSS:

Mr. Bailey was the Assistant Attorney

General who —
QUESTION:

Well, this is between him and the Court.

42

And he states, “The initial claim...was filed against solely
the State of TExas."
Then in the next paragraph he says, "After the
filing of our trial Brief...the Plaintiffs amended their
Complaint to bring in certain other parties; namely, the
District Attorney, Dallas County, the Chief Justice of the
Texas Supreme Court, and the Attorney General of the State of
Texas.“
And then he says, "I would at the conclusion of this
like to move to dismiss the Chief Justice."

Is the Chief

Justice still a party?
MR. GAUSS;
QUESTION;
I see.

No.

The next sentence, your Honor.

Oh, I see. "We grant that right now."

But he did not move to dismiss the District Attorney

or the Attorney General, I gather.
MR. GAUSS;
QUESTION;
MR. GAUSS:

This is correct.
So they ar© still parties.
Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

There is no Eleventh Amendment problem,

MR. GAUSS:

Not at this point, because the court

themselves.
QUESTION;

MR. GAUSS:

I think this is correct, too - your Honor.

I don’t tliink the Governor was served, I don’t think the
Attorney General was served.
QUESTION:

Are they parties then?

QUESTION:

That was my question.

.MR. GAUSS:
QUESTION:

It would be highly questionable.
It names the defendants, but until they

are served they are not parties.
QUESTIONs

Doesn’t an appearance by the Assistant.

Attorney General to have moved to dismiss on merits amount
to an appearance on behalf of the state officials?
MR. GAUSS:

Well, certainly we haven’t raised it at

this point, your Honor.

We assume we are in the case.

Certainly the State statute is under attack, and we are here
representing the state of Texas.
QUESTION:
wasn’t served.

You don’t say that the Attorney General

Because under the 3-judge rules, you have to

serve the Attorney General.
MR. GAUSS:
QUESTION:

Am I correct on that?

Yes.
You have to serve them.

So can’t v/e

assume that he was served?
QUESTION:

You have to serve him with notice even

if he is not a defendant.
MR. GAUSS:

I think that's probably right.

I think

44
that’s probably right.
QUESTIONS

Just to complicate this brew, over at

page 41, Mr. Bailey says, "Well, in this connection, may it
please the Court, we have not. been served

granted I have

been in court representing the State of Texas."
And Judge Thornberrv says, "Well, what I want to
make clear is — our Order of Dismissal is confined to the
Chief Justice."
Mr. Bailey then says, "All right, sir."
QUESTIONS

Absent special appearance, you are in the

case, aren't you?
MR. GAUSS;

Yes, sir, I think we are in the case.

Well, the State of Texas can't consent

QUESTION:
MR. GAUSS:

What about the Eleventh Amendment?
Well, your Honors, I must confess

ignorance as to what actually transpired regarding the service
and notice to participants.
QUESTION:

Well, this much we do know, apparently.

45
That is, that Mr. Bailey, after the amendment which added the
Attorney General and the District Attorney, he appeared and
apparently all he says is, "I have been in court representing
the State of Texas."

Does that mean he is also representing

the others?
MR. GAUSS:
QUESTION:

I am sorry, your Honor —Does that mean he is also representing

the officials, does it?
MR. GAUSS:

I think so.

I think he certainly took

that position at the time, and I would assume that proper
notice and service was had upon the officials to properly get
the State of Texas into the case.
QUESTION:
MR. GAUSS:

Well, you are here representing your boss.
Yes, sir.

But again, the cases cited by counsel, I think they
make no departure from Flast as to the standing question.
The cases

involved certainly not criminal matters.

And I

have com© across, no case other than the one case cited by
Judge Hughes which does involve a criminal statute.

This

was the Oregon statute, and I believe she cites it on page 65,
this Pierce v. Society of Sisters.

That case involved a

situation where the State of Oregon passed a statute which
made it a crime not to send — for a parent not to send their
children to public school.

The plaintiffs in the case were

private schools, and they took the position that they had

46
long-term contracts with parents and the enforcement of this
criminal statute against these parents would certainly work
a great, very direct detriment upon them financially
property right, a contract right.

and a

And they held in that case

But that is, I submit, a far cry

from a situation where it's being asked that the State of
Texas or state officials — and in effect that's all it
amounts to, that, "Texas, you start prosecuting these people.”
And I don’t know how this Court could possibly couch an
order that would be enforceable, because there are too many
things that are involved.
I suppose an order could be couched in terms that
you will not refrain from prosecuting illegitimate fathers
based solely on the fact that the child is illegitimate.
again, I don't think that's before the Court.

And I submit, your Honors, that this is all that

the Court is called upon to decide in this case.

The other

matters may be reached in the companion case which was argued
this morning, but certainly i think that the merits of the
constitutionality or the wisdom of the Texas legislature and
the Texas courts as to their treatment of responsibilities of
fathers of illegitimate children is not before the Court, in
