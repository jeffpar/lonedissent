MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER; We will hear arguments
next in 71-1136, Tillman against Wheaton-Haven.
Mr. Brown, you may proceed whenever you’re ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLISON W. BROWN, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. BROWN;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court s
This case is virtually indistinguishable from a case
which this Court had before it three years ago, called
Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park.
The issue here, as it was there, is whether a
community recreation association may discriminate on grounds
of race with respect to persons who are otherwise eligible to
use its facilities,
Wheaton-Haven Recreation Association, the
organization at issue here, is virtually a carbon copy of
Little Hunting Park, the association which was at issue in
the Sullivan case.
The principal characteristic of Wheaton-Haven
Recreation Association is set by its bylaws, which state very
unequivocally that membership shall be open to bona fide
residents, whether or not homeowners of the area within a
three-quarter mile radius of the pool.
The facility involved, which is the principal

4
function of Wheaton-Haven, is the swimming pool which it
operates-

The swimming pool is similar to those that are

characteristic of many suburban areas in the United States,
and most particularly in the Washington area, where in the
Washington suburbs are some 100 to 150 of them that have been
built by neighbors and people in the neighborhood on a
cooperative basis.
They are principally predominant in areas where,
of course, there are no public swimming facilities.
Wheaton-Haven has an initiation fee of $375, and,
in addition, annual dues of $50 to $60 a year.

I regret to

say that on page 4 of the petitioner’s brief there is a
typographical error, where it says that the annual dues are
$150 to $160 a year? it should be $50 to $60 a year.
QUESTION: What page was that, again?
MR„ BROWN:

That’s page 4 of the petitioner's brief.

The annual dues are $50 to $60, not $150 to $160.
That’s the blue brief.
The by lav/s provide that members can be taken from
outside of the three-quarter-mile radius of the pool, provided
that such members do not exceed 30 percent of the membership
of the association.
Members who are brought into the association, who
pay their dues, are subject to the approval of the board of
directors or the membership of the association.

5

One of the features of membership in the pool is
that a member may, upon selling his house, may transfer a
first option to his vendee.

Now, he does this by selling his

membership back to the association and that vendee then has a
first option to buy that, and that gives him a preference over
any persons who are on a waiting list.

Their maximum number

of members being permitted in the pool being 325 families.
Wheaton-Haven was constructed in 1958 under the terms
of a special ordinance adopted by the Montgomery County,
Maryland, Council, which was adopted and designed to facilitate
the construction of these community swimming pools.

The

Montgomery County Council stated that it wished to promote
the buildixig and construction of these pools because it
served an important community function by providing
recreation facilities which were not otherwise available in
the area.
As a condition of getting zoning approval, the
Wheaton-Haven was required by the zoning authority to show,
demonstrate that 60 percent of its construction costs were
subscribed.

That is, in other words, that it was in fact

meeting a need of the community.
As a means of creating its initial membership, the
association conducted a door-to-door solicitation campaign
in the area.

It distributed an advertising circular, and

charter memberships were made available on the payment of a

6

$20 pledge.

Its original organizational meeting was a

public meeting held — or I should say its original promotional
meeting was a public meeting held in the auditorium of the
Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission, a
government agency which has a public auditorium.
Wheaton-Haven has always had a sign posted on its
premises, which is visible from the street in front, which
states the name and telephone number of the membership chair­
man.

In more recent years, since this litigation has trans­

pired, that sign has — the name of the chairman and the
telephone number has been removed.
At the hearing before the zoning authority in 1958,
when Wheaton-Haven sought permission to build its facility,
its swimming pool, its representatives testified that the
pool would serve the needs of the community as a whole, and
that it was needed as a deterrent to juvenile delinquency in
the neighborhood.
And it was specified that the pool would not be
used for private, social functions.
The construction of the pool was performed by a
contractor from outside the State of Maryland, and the pool
utilizes pumps and filters and other mechanical devices which
originate from outside the State.
Now, in the spring of 1968, to get down to the facts
of the discrimination here. Dr. and Mrs. Harry Press sought

7
membership in the pool.

They are a black family 'who live

in the neighborhood, within a three-quarter-mile radius of the
pool.
The membership, they were told, was unavailable to
them because of their race or color.
Similarly in 1968, in July of that year, Mr. and Mrs
Murray Tillman, white members of the association, brought a
black guest, Mrs. Grace Rosner, to the pool and, although she
was admitted on the first occasion, she was later denied
admission under the guise of a new rule which the pool adopted
after her first entry, stating that henceforth only relatives
of members would be admitted.
It is undisputed on the record that the pool has and
enforces a discriminatory policy with respect to memberships
and guests.
The suit in here, in this case, was initiated in
Federal District Court in Baltimore on the basis of the Civil
Rights Act of 1866 and the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
The district court held against the plaintiffs, and,
upon appeal, the Court of Appeals held against the plaintiffs.
The basis for their decisions in both instances was that this
case was distinguishable from Sullivan vs. Little Hunting Park
It is the petitioners1 position that both courts
violated the principle of stare decisis.

This case is on

all-four with Sullivan vs. Little Hunting Park.

There are

8

seldom two cases with facts more similar.
The Court of Appeals — or both courts constructed
grounds for distinguishing the two cases.

I will deal

principally, of course, with the Court of Appeals decision.
The Court of Appeals committed two basic errors.
First of all, it misconstrued the Civil Fights Act of 1866,
which had been the basis for this Court's holding in
Sullivan vs. Little Hunting Park.
Secondly, the Court of Appeals relied on insubstantial
and, indeed, in some instances, wholly false grounds for
distinguishing this case from Sullivan vs. Little Hunting Park,
and concluded that Wheaton-Haven Recreation Association was a
private club and, hence, exempt from both the Civil Fights
Acts of 1866 and of 1964.
I will get to the question of whether or not
Wheaton-Haven is a private club in a moment, since that bears
on whether or not it is, indeed, covered by the 1866 law and
the 1964 Act.
But I would like to first point out the manner in
which we believe the court basically misconstrued the Civil
Rights Act of 1866,
That Act, the Court will recall, was the basis of
this Court's decision, first, in Jones vs. Mayer Company.
In Jones vs. Mayer Company, the Court held that the Thirteenth
Amendment and the Civil Rights Act of 1866 applied to private

9

discrimination, and that the Act of 1866 was intended to
abolish all badges and incidents of slavery, and that the
Act was to be broadly construed.
The 1866 Act has since been incorporated in — that
is, since its adoption — has been incorporated in and is now
part of 42 USC 1981 and 42 USC 1982.

1981 guarantees black

persons the same right as white persons, to make and enforce
contracts.

And 1982 provides that black persons shall have

the same right as white persons, quote, "to inherit, purchase,
3-ease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property."
In Jones v. Mayer, and indeed in Sullivan vs.
Little Hunting Park, there were some members of this Court who
dissented and in effect doubted the wisdom of applying the
1866 law to private discrimination in housing and, in the case
of the Sullivan case, to a membership in a swimming pool
association, because they felt that more emphasis should be
given to the court — or more significance should be given by
the court, should be placed by the court upon the more recent
enactment by Congress of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the
Fair Housing Act, or the Fair Housing Provisions of the Civil
Rights Act of 1968.
In other words, the dissenting members in those
cases felt that those laws, the more recent laws, should be
given — should be made applicable? and they questioned the
wisdom of resurrecting the old 1866 law.

10

However,, since that time, since the Jones decision
and since the Sullivan decision, numerous court decisions have
now cipplied both 42 USC 1981 and 1982 to a variety of kinds of
racial discrimination„

These provisions have been applied in

cases of employment discrimination, in cases of housing
discrimination, in cases of discrimination with respect to
public accommodations, schools, cemetery plots, and so forth.
And most recently a significant development occurred
which, unfortunately, we failed to be aware of in time to
cover in our brief, and that is that Congress has now, in
effect, ratified this Court’s decision in Jones v„ Mayer.
On February 8 and 9 of this year, during the debates
on the Equal Employment Opportunity law, and the question of
whether enforcement powers should be given to the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission, an amendment was introduced
by Senator Hruska which would have withdrawn any right of an
individual to seek relief in the federal courts on the basis
of 42 USC 1981,

It would have limited one’s right of

redress to the ■— to Title 7 of the 1964 Civil Rights Act,
namely the Fair Employment Provisions of that Act,
The provision — the Hruska amendment was debated,
it was criticised by the floor leaders for the bill, the
legislation that was under consideration, Senator Williams of
New Jersey and Senator Javits of New York.

Those Senators

hailed this Court's decision in Jones v. Mayer, and

11

specifically expressed approval of the construction, the
judicial gloss which has accrued, which, in effect, holds that
Title 7 of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the Act of 1866
provided alternative means to redress individual's grievances.
The result was that the Hruska amendment was
defeated.
So, therefore, it seems apparent that there was no
longer any basis for holding back, shall we say, on the
meaning or the construction to be given to the 1866 law.
It applies here to this case, and the Court of Appeals and,
indeed, the district court, it seems to me, engaged in a very
serious error by failing to follow this Court's admonition that
the plain words of the 1866 law should be broadly construed and
complied with.
Mow, the plaintiffs base their suit, as I indicated,
on both the 1866 law and the 1964 law.

Essentially, under the

1866 law, they claim that there were contract and property
interests of theirs which had been impaired by the
discrimination committed by the association.

The plaintiffs,

the Presses, who had sought to purchase a swimming pool
membership, claimed, asserted in the complaint that their
contract and property interests had been denied them, denied
them on — which were otherwise — interests which would
have been availabe to them had they been of the Caucasian race.
The Tillman plaintiffs, the white plaintiffs, had

12

contract and property interests involved in the swimming
pool membership.

Their allegation,, their position in this

case was similar to that of the plaintiff Sullivan in t?ie case
of Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park.

Wot only were their own

interests being impinged or impaired by -— on the basis of
racial considerations, but, in addition, they were in the
position of asserting the rights of the Negro quest that they
*

had brought to the pool, Mrs. Rosner»
Mrs. Rosner's interests arose from the fact that as
a guest of the Tillmans, she had a license or an easement that
was enforcible and recognizable as a property or contract
interest.
Now, the other ground, aside from its misconstrue"
tion of the 1866 law, which we claim the Court of Appeals
seriously departed from this Court's precedent on was the
issue of the private club.
The Court held that because, in its view, WheatonHaven was a private club, it fell within the private club
exemption of the 1964 Act.

This exemption exempts from the

public accommodations provision of that Act any private club
or other establishment not in fact open to the public.
Now, the Court of Appeals committed additional error,
in our view, by — it's quite clear ■— by reading that
exemption as a limitation on the 1866 Act.
Now, this Court, both in the case of Jones v, Mayer

m
l3

ano. j-ii v.he ease of Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park, had
specifica! ly held that the later enactments of Congress were
no

\

did not in any way limit or qualify the earlier

enactments, and , indeed, that is the effect now of many other
Court opinions. decisions which we have cited in our brief?
and, as I just indicated, it's certainly the effect,also of
the Congress's rejection of an amendment which would have
constituted a limitation on the 1866 Act.
Now, the question then arises:

What kind of a

limitation, if any, is there on the 1866 Act, so far as the
matter of a private club is concerned?
We would submit that the only limitation is a
constitutional limitation.

There is, we would agree, a

constitutional right of privacy or freedom of association.
This Court has never defined that in very explicit
terms, in circumstances comparable to these.

The right of

privacy received its fullest discussion, I suppose, as far as
I know, in the case of Griswold v. Connecticut, which involved,
of course, the matter of birth control devices; and the
Court held that there was a constitutional right of privacy
which was part of the penumbra of the Bill of Rights.
That has not been expanded upon to any great degree,
as far as I know, in subsequent decisions of the Court,
There has also been, of course, this — there have
been holdings that there is a constitutional right of free

14
association, which flows from — is based on the First
Amendment, and that, as a result, associations may not be
interfered, unduly interfered with as a result of State
action, or infringement of their constitutional right of
association, of their free association.
However, that issue is not really — those issues
are not really involved here, to the extent that they need to
be the outer — the outer limits of privacy need to be
explored or delineated by this Court,
The real question here was resolved in Sullivan vs.
Little Hunting Creek, where the Court held very clearly that
Little Hunting Park was not a private club because it had no
program, no plan or program of exclusiveness? no plan or
purpose of exclusiveness, and that it had no criteria for
excluding people from its facilities other than race.
Now, we submit that exactly the same thing is true
of Wheaton-Haven, as indicated by the bylaws and as
indicated by the record here, there has never been a basis,
any grounds —- there have never been any grounds for
excluding people that have been — in any way reflected in the
record.

There is indication that one person in this

association’s ten-year history was excluded, but the record
doesn't indicate why.

It doesn’t indicate the person's

race, it doesn't indicate where the person lived, whether
he might have been outside the geographic area; and, indeed,

15

it doesn't indicate whether he might have been afflicted with
some dread disease which would make his presence in the
swimming pool \mdesirable.
So there is no record of excluding people, there are
no criteria anywhere to indicate that the association had
intended to exclude people so long as they lived within the
prescribed geographic area.
With respect to the 1964 Act there has been some
question as to just what meaning should be given tc this
private club exemption in the 1964 Act.
Well, it would seem to me that as a practical
matter, although the — that as a practical matter the
exemption in the 1964, from the 1964 Act should be read to be
co-extensive with the constitutional limitation which, as I
say, 1 would concede applies to the 1866 Act,
I say that on the basis of the statutory history,
the congressional history which we've alluded to in our
reply brief, where Senator Humphrey, who was the floor manager
for the 1964 Civil Rights Act, in explaining the exemption for
private clubs, stated that it was intended to protect only
the genuine privacy of private clubs, whose membership is
genuinely selective.
Well, that language certainly parallels very closely
t

the language of this Court in Sullivan vs. Little Hunting Park,
and it would seem to be ■— it would seem that there would be

16

no basis for creating different criteria or a different right
of privacy.

The only difference is that the Court of Appeals

made this error of reading the statutory provision as a
limitation on the 1866 law.
There have been references made in the briefs and
of course the question naturally arises in anyone's mind as
to the difference between this case and the famous Moose Lodge
case, which was decided by this Court quite recently.

And

of course the difference between this case and the Moose Lodge,
between Wheaton-Haven and the Moose Lodge, is like the
difference between day and night.
The constitution of the Moose organization specifically
states that membership is restricted to male persons of the
Caucasion or white race above the age of 21 years, and not
married to someone of any other than the Caucasian or white
race, who are of good moral character, physically and
mentally normal, who shall profess a belief in a Supreme
Being.
Moose, by its own definition, by its own — is
exclusionary, it's a traditional fraternal organization,
QUESTION:

You're not claiming here that the

Constitution prevents the respondent from doing what it did,
you're relying on statutes, aren't you?
MR. BROWN:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION: Well, isn't that another distinction

17
between Moose Lodge and your case?
MR. BROWN: Of course.
QUESTION;
MR, BROWN;

Yes.
Of course.

Obviously, that case

involved State action, and I didn’t *— I only cited it because
it has been relied on by the respondents here, that is to
suggest that because the Court in dictum, or I guess really
assumed — I didn’t mean dictum? the basic assumption in that
case was that the Moose Lodge was a private organization.
And I am simply saying that, so be it; but this Wheaton-Haven
is wholly distinguishable as an organization, simply
because Wheaton-Haven has no exclusionary criteria of the sort
that exists in the Moose Lodge.
QUESTION: Well, you said that it has an
exclusionary criteria, a parameter of three-quarters of a
mile.
MR. BROWN; That’s the only one.
QUESTION: And none other?
MR. BROWN:

None other.

No, sir.

And it's open

specifically, by its own bylaws, to everyone else within that
parameter.
QUESTION:

Mr. Brown, going back to your property

right argument, on what specifically do you base this, on the
option?
MR. BROWN: Well, no, not specifically, sir.

The

18

option is merely one of the aspects of the property interest
that is involved, —
QUESTION:

So that your case would be the same

whether —
MR. BROWN:

— the option — excuse me.

QUESTION:

— or not the option existed?

MR, BROWN:

Essentially, although the option —

well, I don't mean to say it would be the same, but the option
is one of the indicia of the fact that the pool membership
here is an incident of real property in that neighborhood,
QUESTION: And this is so, despite the fact that
there must be membership approval even for the purchaser of a
former member’s property?
MR. BROWN:

Yes.

Yes.

But that membership approval

is no evidence that it's ever bean utilized other than in the
one instance that we referred to.
But certainly, by making that option, putting that
option in there, it adds to the inducement of persons to buy
a membership, and it increases the attraction in value of
homes in the neighborhood.
QUESTION: What kind of reasons could be properly
used under their voting power to pass on members?

Could

they say, for example, they won’t take in a chronic alcoholic,
or a drug addict?

What would be the areas?

MR. BROWN:

I would think that they could utilize,

19

yes, the kinds of reasons that you're discussing.

A chronic

alcoholic, a person with a dsread skin disease, or a person who
lives outside the geographic area.

But those are criteria

which are comparable to those which the proprietor — I say
comparable to those that a proprietor of any business might
use.
He can exclude persons -- not that this is a. business
but it's an accommodation? the proprietor of any accommodation,
public accommodation, can exclude persons who are going to be
disruptive, who perhaps don’t wear a necktie, if you go to a
restaurant.

There are reasons why a place can draw lines as

t o the kind of patrons it wants, but that doesn't indicate
that it has an absolute right of privacy which exempts it from
the operation of the Civil Rights Acts.
QUESTION:
rule absolute?

Incidentally, is the three-quarter-mile

Am I correct in my impression that one living

beyond three-quarters of a mile from the pool may still become
a member upon being accepted?
MR. BROWN:

He can become a member if the membership

rolls are open, that is not having exceeded the limit, and so
long as the number of persons from outside the three-quartermile limit do not exceed 30 percent of the total membership.
QUESTION: Thirty percent.
And usually the membership rolls were not full, am
I correct in that?

20

MR. BROWN; Well, usually they were not, although,
at the time of the events herein they were full.

They were at

the 325 limit,
I'd like to reserve any time I have.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

All right.

Mr. Noyes.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF HENRY J. NOYES, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. NOYES;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court;
This case was decided in the district court on cross
motions for a summary judgment.

Counsel for the petitioners,

who has argued today, and counsel and myself stipulated as to
all the facts, and that is the basis upon which the lower court
made its decision.
Nov;, those stipulations are contained in the trans™
cript that we have provided in this case.

I might say, in

spite of the fact that the petitioners, in the record in this
case, advise this Court that such transcript was not available.
That transcript, as we see it, in fact as a matter of
certainty, was the way in which the Fourth Circuit decided this
case.
Matters have now crept into the case and, indeed,
in the argument today, which can nowhere be found in the
record

21

The matter such as alleged door-to-door solicitation,
and the matters of the Montgomery County Council hearings are
not contained in the record in this case.

There are matters,

indeed, that have crept in as late as the reply brief of the
petitioners»
Now, when we analyze the case as it appeared down
below, and it was argued in the Fourth Circuit, really the
only contention that the petitioners make is that there is
no distinction between this case and Sullivan v. Little Hunting
Park.

That is their real issue; that is their real argument.
And we — of course the Fourth Circuit rejected that,

rejected it for very good reasons, after having this case
under advisement for over a year.

And the points of

distinction are substantial and several, between Little
Hunting Park and this case.
First of all, and most important, Little Hunting
Park turned on the fact that there was an attempted assignment
of a membership incident to the sale or lease of real property.
You do not have that in this case.
In Little Hunting Park, Freeman moved into the
neighborhood and leased his home from Sullivan for $129 a
month, and this honorable Court found that at least a portion
of the $129 was for the pool membership, because in Sullivan
the member had an absolute right to assign his membership.
in this case, Press moved into this neighborhood in

22

1967, at least a year before he ever had an idea to attempt
to join this pool.

There is no contention that Press ever

attempted to obtain an assignment from an existing member,
there is no contention that an existing member ever attempted
to assign a membership and that such attempted assignment was
aborted.
All Press says is that he wants to join.
Now, Press did this;

Press made an informal

request to one of the members, or one or two members for an
application.
against Press.

The directors had a meeting and they voted
And that was as far as it went.

Then Press —
QUESTION;

Did they specifically do it on race or

not?
MR. NOYES;

In Press's case, the record was

stipulated, and we don't deny it, we stipulated, to get this
case decided on summary judgment, that Press was denied a
membership because of his race.
QUESTION;

That's in the record.

Right.

MR. NOYES; We don't deny that.
And now, *—
QUESTION;

That has at least the same posture as a

finding of fact of the district court, based on substantial
evidence, then, doesn't it?
MR. NOYES s

At that point„

23
Now, Press, however — this is where we distinguish
Little Hunting Park,

In Little Hunting Park, first of all,

the board of directors has the sole control over its
membership.

In Wheaton-Haven, Press asked for an application

and they wouldn't give him an application. This was a board of
directors' vote.
However, the bylaws of Wheaton-Haven provide that
any member, at any meeting, can propose a member, and a
majority of the members can elect in a member.

Now, you don't

have that, or did not have that in Sullivan v. Little Hunting
Park,
So, rather than have Tillman, the plaintiff in this
case, who was a member, propose him at the next annual meeting
of members for membership, he didn't even bother attempting to
follow that route, because the board refused to give him an
application he immediately went to the courts.
Now, we say that there's a distinction that there
frankly is a substantial body, substantial group in WheatonHaven who would admit Press and vote to admit Press.

But he

didn't even attempt that route, he didn't even attempt to
poll the membership by having Mr. Tillman propose him at a
meeting.
Now, special meetings can be called by members, and
it's — 20 percent of the membership can call a special
meeting at any time, and 10 percent of the membership con-

24
stitutes a quorum.
Therefore, as few as --- even if the membership was
filled, as few as 10 percent of 325 would constitute a
quorum which could, presumably, lead to Mr. Press, or Dr.
Press being voted in by the members.
Now, what we think is very important, there never
liras an attempted assignment.

All Press is saying, and all

v*

Rosner is saying is this, in its simplest form;

They ask

the Court to adopt their proposition as follows;
Because of our race, because of our race we are
entitled to a membership and we are entitled to be guests
when similarly situated white citizens do not enjoy such
right.
Those facts are admitted in the record before the
district court.

When counsel, in answer to the question posed

by the district court, conceded that white citizens would
not have the same right that Press and Posner now press before
this Court.
QUESTION;

I thought all he was asking for was an

application in blank.
M3. NOYES;
QUESTION:
MR. NO-YES:

Well, —
Am I right or wrong?
He asked to have an application to —

well, in asking for an application, he indicated he wanted to
join

25
QUESTION: And he was denied the application?
MR. NOYES:

He was denied the application, but he,

in effect, was told, formally or informally, that at that time,
even if an application was given, it would not be approved.
We don't dispute that.
QUESTION: Well, what about all this other business
yoii're talking about?

He can go here and he can go there, and

he can hold a meeting here and he can do this.

What has that

to do with this case?
MR. NOYES:

It's a point of distinction between

Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park and this case.

The

petitioners are relying almost solely on Sullivan v. Little
Hunting Park, which was a transfer of —
QUESTION:

I didn’t know that — Sullivan, as I

remember it, I don’t know anything about appealing to the
membership and getting one-third of the votes? I didn’t think
that was in the case at all.
MR. NOYES:
case.

It wasn't in that case, but it’s in this

It wasn’t in that case because —
QUESTION:
MR. NOYES:

Oh, I see.
-- in Sullivan, the sole way a person

could get a membership was through the board of directors.
In this particular case the members can vote the person in.
This is the point of distinction that we raise, although we
don't say that it's the most substantial point. The most

26

substantial point, we say, is that this was not an attempted
assignment incident to the sale or lease of real property.
That’s the difference, it was an attempted direct application
to the membership by Dr. and Mrs. Press.

It was a direct

attempt by Rosner, saying she is entitled to be a guest even
though the uniformly applied bylaws limit guest privileges to
relatives of members.

There’s never been any contention that

those aren't uniformly applied.
Now, this first opteion statement was rejected in
the Fourth Circuit, and, reading the bylaws of Little Hunting
Park, which we have cited in our brief, as compared to the
bylaws in Wheaton-Haven, there is no first option.
At all relevant times in these proceedings, the
membership has not been filled.

That’s a matter of fact in

this record.
Now, if the membership is filled, the Wheaton-Haven
bylaws say that the club shall —* shall — buy back the
membership at 90 percent of the initiation fee, and then a
person who was buying a home of that resigning member would
have the first opteion to buy that, subject to approval of
the board of directors.
But in cases when the membership is not filled,
which is what we have here, and have had at all relevant
times in these proceedings,

the club may, the bylaws say

"may", buy back this membership, strictly whether they want to

27

do it or not, it's strictly up to the club.

They are not

required to buy it back.
Now, in Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park, you had an
absolute right to assign or transfer a membership.

You do

not have that in Wheaton-Haven.
In Wheaton-Haven, when a person desires to resign,
he has to submit a written resignation, and if the club is
not filled as we have it now, the club may or may not buy it
back.
You had no such provision in Sullivan v. Little
Hunting Park.

If a member attempted to assign his membership

and the club would not approve it, that meant he had no way
of disposing or getting any money out of his membership.
There is no situation in Wheaton-Haven where a
contractual relationship could arise, no way, between an
existing member and a prospective member.

There is no way that

a contract could arise under the bylaws.
Now, there is significance in the attempt to be
laid on the fact that, supposedly during the entire history of
this club that only — the record only indicates one
rejection of one person, and I believe the record indicates
that person was a white person.

Some great significance is

laid upon this.
The Fourth Circuit dealt with this, and the district
court dealt with this, in stating the more subtle xvays that

28

private clubs operate»

Once a person gets an application,

the approval is usually a pro forma type of thing.
keep a rate of rejections of members.

We don’t

The petitioners would

have us believe, or would have the Court believe, that
throughout the history of this club there has been a long
record of exclusiveness of Negroes and no exclusiveness of
white persons, yet the record shows no prior exclusions of
Negroes or white people.

It shows one rejection, and that

was a situation which is unusual, where the application has
been filed and then rejected.
But we don’t generally reach that point.
Now, we therefore say, Your Honors, that in this
case it really boils down to whether or not the Court would
pigeonhole Wheaton-Haven into Little Hunting Park, and the
briefs and the facts that I have stated indicates that it's
entirely different.
Now, as to 2000a, this Public Accommodations law,
the record will indicate that counsel in the district court
substantially, if not totally, abandoned his argument under
t hat concept.
At one point counsel said that the only issue is
whether there is a link between the association and interstate
commerce.

That was on page 61.
At another point he stated that if Wheaton-Haven

is a private club, we concede that neither Sections 1981 nor

23

1982, nor 2000a apply.
He said, of course we believe that this is not a
private club, but if it is a private club, then we're out on
all three statutes.

And of course if it's a private club,

they'd be out under Little Hunting Park, too, because Little
Hunting Park was decided under Section 1982.
In regard to counsel's statement that this honorable
Court found Little Hunting Park to be a private club or a
public operation, we do not read the case that way.

The

Court did, in one paragraph, state that there is no plan or
purpose of exclusiveness? but the Court didn't say it was a
public accommodation.
That case was decided on the transfer or attempted
transfer of membership incident to the sale or lease of real
property.
Now, as to membership at this time, the way the
bylaws are structured, anybody in the United States who we
deem, we want to admit, can be a member, we're not restricted
to a three-quarter-mile area until, unless the membership is
filled.
In closing, I would simply point this out to the
Court, as far as exclusiveness is concerneds

Again, the

petitioners attempt to lay heavy stress on the fact that
allegedly one person was turned down over the years.
However, this club is situated in the Wheaton area,

30

which is about some 12 to .13 miles above the District Line.
Homes from the District Line out, for many, many miles, are
as thick as they can be placed.

There is practically no

available land.
At this time we can take members because our
membership is not filled, we can take memberships from anywhere
in Montgomery County, the District of Columbia, Prince George’s
County, and the surrounding Virginia areas, and, indeed,
California.

Yet our membership remains below the maximum of

325.
It would seem axiomatic that if we desire to fill
this membership by running an ad in the newspaper, or if we
were in fact such a public operation, we would fill the thing
tomorrow.
My people prefer to keep their club at the present
amount of some 260 or 265, in spite of the fact that they’ve
got the potential membership, or Potential Area to draw
members of, at some rough guess, some five million people.
We say that this is not a public accommodation.
The record shows it is not.

The record, in the well-reasoned

opixxion of the Fourth Circuit, shows that Little Hunting Park
does not apply.

We respectfully urge upon Your Honors to

sustain the opinions of both lower courts,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Thank you, Mr. Noyes.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN H. MUDD, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT McINTYRE
MR. MUDD;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court;
I appear on behalf of Mr. Ernest McIntyre, one of
the respondents in this case, who previously was a member of
the board, who at this time finds himself somewhat in an
anomalous situation.
The record, including his deposition, which is in
the transcript, in the Appendix, shows that he, Mr. McIntyre,
was one of the members mentioned by Mr. Noyes who favored
integration of the pool or admission of Negroes to the pool?
and, in fact, first met Dr. Press when he was coaching his
youngster on a Little League or softball/baseball team, and
it was he who inquired about application to the club.
However, we find now that he is a defendant and
nowhere below has the court ruled that he, since he was sued
only as a director, should not have a part in these
proceedings and should have been dismissed? because the lower
courts have not gotten to that.
I will pass this point quickly, because I want to
get to the other points mentioned by Mr. Noyes.

But I say

that Mr. McIntyre has no place in these proceedings, and to
keep an individual in a case like this, with his demonstrated
concern, as a matter of social philosophy, if you will, would

32

discourage any individual from serving in any community
activity whatsoever»
But we corns now to the point as to whether the
verdict or judgments below should be affirmed, and I think we
come to the one point which has been the issue running through
the briefs, and that is whether Wheaton-Haven is not a place
of public accommodation but a private club or other
establishment not in fact open to the public»
Nov;, I don’t have the time, nor do I think the
point necessitates taking time, to demonstrate that in fact
this swimming pool was not open to the public»
It was created, formed, controlled, financed by
members.

The applications were voted on by members, either at

a board meeting or at a membership of the whole.
It was not a type of membership as in Little Hunting
Park that followed the real estate.
We had 60 — 70 percent within this three-mile
area, three-mile radius; 30 percent could be outside of the
area.
The sale of a house did not, ipso facto, mean that
the purchaser became a member of the pool.

The seller of the

house turned his membership in, yes, he did have an option,
the buyer; but the membership flowed back through the
corporation, which had the obligation to buy it at 90 or 80
percent, depending on whether the membership was full.

?

33
Now, we come to one thing that I think is most
important, apropos the oral arguments, and I do not wish to
repeat the points that have been made in the briefs.

Below,

in the district court, when this case started, Mr. Brown,
and X quote from the transcript at page 18 %
But of course the question of whether it's a private
club, we will also concede for this, for any purpose would,
is also relevant to section 2000 as well as sections 1981 and
1982.

We don’t think it is a private club, but if it is a

private club, then neither 1981, -2, nor 2000 would apply.
I think the same principles would be applicable.
Now, we find in the reply brief of Mr. Brown, at
page 9:
"Accordingly, Wheaton-Haven, at .least, falls within
that category of associations which, even though private,"
— "which, even though private" — "are not immune from judicial
interference to remedy injury resulting from arbitrary or
discriminatory exclusion."
So we have a complete reversal of his position, with
no authority cited other than the Medical Society case, and a
labor union case, which we submit is different, that is an
economic unit, a professional unit, such as a bar exam.

It

is not a place of pleasure, it is not a recreational activity,
it is not a social club, such as Wheaton-Haven.
Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You have a minute left,

if you need it, Mr. Brown.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ALLISON W. BROWN, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR, BROWN:

I would just like to say very briefly

that the important thing here to consider, and which has
been stressed in the plaintiffs' briefs and has been stressed
in the brief that was filed by the Justice Department in this
case, is that these community recreation facilities, of the
type that is involved here, are not country clubs or
fraternal organizations or sororities, they are organizations
established, as the record shows here, to serve the
community.
And I submit that in this day, where there is a
governmental policy attempting to foster free and open
housing, for example, there can be no more significance and
detrimental poignant badge of slavery than to have a situation
where everyone in the neighborhood is eligible

to use the

local community swimming pool except the black family that
happens to move into that neighborhood.

And that's exactly

what has happened here.
We submit —
QUESTION:

Mr. Brown, were there any facilities

other than the swimming pool?
MR. BROWN:

At the time, in the early days, at the

35
time Wheaton-Haven was first organised, the record shows
that there were no public pools and, indeed, the organizers
had asked the county authorities about that, to build a public
pool in that area, and they were told2 We can’t afford to,
we're too busy building schools»
Consequently, they went ahead and built this pool
in the local community, that is —
QUESTION2

If this club had owned any facilities

there, was there any clubhouse?
MR. BROWN:

Yes, there was a —■ well, a cinderblock,

partly frame building, which is where they keep their
facilities, I guess, or keep their tools and equipment,
pumping equipment and filters and so on.
vending machines there.

They have some

I don't know what else is there.

That isn't reflected in the record, sir.

But there's

no clubhouse for social activities on the premises.
QUESTION; Does the record show whether they serve
food or soft drinks?
MR. BROWN:

Yes. The record shows that there was

service of food from these vending machines for people who
were admitted, of course, to the premises.

And this is the

whole basis, or one of the bases for our assertion that they
are covered by the 1964 Public Accommodations Act, which, if
you recall, hinges on the service of food where the existence
of other kinds of equipment which are passed on in interstate

36

commerce.

And that's why the asserted jurisdiction under the

1964 Act.
I would just like to say in closing that the
association here, as the record will shox*, made a commitment
to the people who had originally solicited to join, it made a
commitment to the public authorities in Montgomery County
that it would provide a public community service facility and
we submit that now those same, the people who are in charge
of this facility are attempting to convert it from a
community facility into a haven for whites.
QUESTION: Well, Mr. Brown, is that in this
stipulation, the representation that was made to the zoning
board, the county board?
MR. BROWN:

That is, sir, in the decision of a

— the Montgomery County Commission on Human Relations —
QUESTION: That's in the record?
MR. BROWN:

That's right.

— which is in the record,

was submitted in the Court of Appeals, and the Court of Appeals
in fact received it and considered it.
So there are certain findings which were made by
that human relations commission which are included in the
record, are in the record of the Court of Appeals, and in a
number of those findings, as we point out in our reply
brief, were in fact stipulated — not stipulated to, but
they were brought out in the course of discovery in the

37

interrogatories arid admissions.

So there really is no —

they are in the record in that way, if not through the Human
Relations Commission decision.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER; Thank you, gentlemen.
The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 2;53 o'clock, p.m,, the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.]
