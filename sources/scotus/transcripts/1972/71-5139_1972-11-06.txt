-7 OF THE PETITIONER
Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case is here on certiorari to a decision of
the South Carolina Supreme

Court afflming the Petitioner's

conviction and sentence to one and a half years at hard
labor for the possession of marijuana.
The certiorari grant was .limited to the issue of
whether a black criminal defendant is constitutionally
entitled to an opportunity to examine prospective jurors on
voir dire with respect to whether they are prejudiced
against him because of his race or because of certain pretrial publicity in the case.

Thus this case raises for the

first time in this court the question of the right of a
criminal defendant to examine and to challenge for cause
juries who are called to decide his case.
We think that that right is a part of the
constitutional right to a jury trial and that in this case
it was violated.
The petitioner is a black civil rights worker

4
who has been active in the county of Florences South
Carolina as a representative of SCLC as well as at the time
a member of the Biracial Commission of the City of Florence.
He was indicted on June lsts 19.70 for the crime of
possession of me.’

of his civil rights

activities.
Over his objections the trial was commenced on the
day after

indictment;, that is5 on June the 2nd.

Although

Petitioner’s counsel sought to make motions for a change of
venue and for a continuance on the basis of pretrial
publicity and possible prejudice on the part of the prospec­
tive jurors3 he was unable to do so in sworn affidavits as
required under

South Carolina law and rather was forced to

make the request orally to the court which overruled both
motions s ummarily.
He made 9 similarlys an oral motion to. quash the
trial venire on the grounds that blacks had been 'systematically
excluded and.after a hearing on June the 2nd the court

denied that motion.
The next day 3 prior to the selection of the jury *
the Petitioner requested the trial judge to voire dire the
prospective jurors with respect to several matters relating to

5
whether they were prejudiced against him because he was black
and because of certain pretrial publicity and extra-judicial
statements in the ease.

Specifically» he requested that each

prospective juror be asked whether he or she was prejudiced
against negroes, whether the fact that the defendant was black
would affect his or l.er ability to render an impartial
judgment and r'\
petitioner was be

in the ease, whether the fact that the

o ils

make any difference in the way

they decided the case.
In addition, he specifically requested that the
trial judge ask the jurors about certain publicity which he
claimed had poisoned the minds of — or possibly poisoned the
minds of persons in that county with respect to persons
charged with the crime which Petitioner was- charged with
and also with respect to whether any of them had heard a
television program, several days before the trial at which the
state’s chief prosecution witness had appeared and had talked
extensively in connection with drug crimes.
The trial judge refused to ask any of the proposed
questions on the grounds that they were irrelevant.
he posed three questions to the prospective jurors.

Initead,
He

asked them whether any of them had formed or expressed an
opinion as to the guilt or innocence of the petitioner,
whether any of them was sensible of any bias or predjudice
for or against him and whether each of them could give the

6
state and the defendant a fair trial.

this case took a total of 12 pages of the record.

questions "no," but in response to the third question said
that she would rather not serve.
One juror said that she had formed or expressed an
opinion as to guilt or innocence, but beyond that, no juror
said anything more than "no, no, yes" to the entire voire
dire proceedings,
Q

Mr. Shapiro, the brief under your hand, there,

on page four, the — right after the quote at the bottom of
the page where it says, "The jurors were excused," that
should be two jurors were excused -MR. SHAPIRO:
Q

That is correct.

— shouldn’t it?

MR, SHAPIRO:

Yes,

Two?

It is two jurors.

That is a

typographical error.
Q

Mr. Shapiro, under South Carolina practice

after the judge has put the questions that he wants to put

7
on voir dire9 is counsel permitted to conduct any voir dire
of their own?
MR. SHAPIRO:

The South Carolina practice would

permit counsel to question the Juror at the judge’s
discretion.

That is, It Is permlssable for the judge to

allow counsel3 although the usual practice Is for the judge
to conduct the erf'ire voir dire examination and the more
usual practice /.s

f 8 judge to ask questions proposed

by counsel as was clone in this case.
Q

Did counsel for Petitioner here seek to

interrogate the jury on his own after the judge declined to
put the questions himself?
MR. SHAPIRO:

No, the counsel submitted written

proposed voir dire questions to the judge prior to the
selection of the

jurors and when they were refused he

sought no further attempt to question the jurors.
Q

Can we construe that record as meaning that a

request on the part of the counsel would have been fruitless?
Is that correct?
MR. SHAPIRO:

I think that is a necessary conclusion,

since the preferred practice in South Carolina Is for the
judge to put all

questions to the jury and when counsel did

request that he do so and that request was denied, 1 think
that It is certainly reasonable to infer that any further
request would have been fruitless.

8
Q

Wells isn't that settled on page 35?

The

court said this is all irrelevant and I am not going to do it.
MR. SHAPIRO:

I think that that certainly indicates

the way —

Q

It's on page 35.

MR. SHAPIRO:

—■ the judge would have ruled with

respect to that.
Q

That is the way he did rule.

MR. SHAPIRO:
Q

Exactly.

Wells isn’t that what he says on page 35

of the record?
MR. SHAPIRO;

Yes, it does.

He ruled that the

questions were relevant and would not put —
Q

Mr. Shapiro., the three questions to which

Mr. Justice Stewart referred you at page

four of your

briefs do I understand that those three questions are
required by South Carolina statute?
MR. SHAPIRO:

The South Carolina statute which is

set out in footnote three on page five of the brief states
that the court shall on the motion of either party in this
suit examine on oath any person vzho was called to know whether
he was related to either party9 has any interest in the
causes has expressed or formed any opinion or is sensible of
any bias or prejudice therein.

And the South Carolina

Supreme Court had interpreted that statute to be satisfied

9
when questions — general questions

of the nature put to,

the jurors by the trial judge are asked»
Q

So these three questions were asked by the

trial judge in obedience to that statute, is that it?
MR. SHAPIRO:

That is correct.

That is correct.

Although it should be.noted that the judge did not even
fully comply wit:

the — all of the requirements of that

statute but the throe questions the South Carolina Supreme
Court held on appeal constituted sufficient compliance
under South Carolina law.
The refusal

of the trial judge to voire dire the

jurors with respect to the issues posed was raised on appeal
In the South Carolina Supreme Court which affirmed the
conviction holding that it was within the discretion of the
trial judge to refuse the questions and that there was no
abuse of that discretion showing this case.

Two judges of

the South Carolina Supreme Court dissented on the ground that
this court’s decision in Aldridge versus the United States
was binding on the South Carolina court and that the
questions with respect to racial prejudice, as this court
held in Aldridgea should have been'asked.
Q

How many are there?

MR. SHAPIRO:

There are five judges.

We don’t understand the state in this case to
question the general proposition that a criminal defendant

10
has a constitutional right to challenge'for cause jurors
who are prejudiced against him because of race or because of
pretrial publicity. The right of challenge is a right
a
which we think is/necessary component of two independent
constitutional rights* the right to a jury trial and the
right to a trial before an impartial tribunal.
The right to a jury trial has included the right
to challenge as long as there have been jury trials.

It is

a right which developed at the time of the right to a jury
trial developed in the first instance and has never been
deviated from* either before or after the adoption of the
United States* Constitution.
What Mr. Justice Powell said with respect to the
unanimity requirement in the Appiqacca case* we think i3
equally if not more true about the right of challenge and
that is that although the history of the sixth amendment is
ambiguous in the sense that

we d.on!t have the record of

the framers3 the history of the right of challege at common
law has been unambiguous and vie think it has been related
to the right to jury trial for time immemorial.
We think also that right of challenge is essential
to the very function which the jury is intended to serve
and that is to provide an impartial barrier between the
state and the defendant.

If there Is any one element of the

right to jury trial which is essential* we think it is the

11
impartiality of that body and we think that the right of
challenge is the only means of successfully guaranteeing
that impartiality *
We think also that the right of challenge is
implicit in the right to jury trial in this- court?s
decision in Appidacca wherethe rationale for eliminating the
unanimity requirement is premised on the defendant’s ability
to secure an impartial, responsible panel of jurors who
will decide his case,
Q

How would you prepare the specific questions?

For example, if the request had been made, do you have any
prejudice against people who wear pink shirts, and the
defendant was wearing a pink shirt or counsel was wearing a
pink shirt, do you think that inquiry must be made?
ME. SHAPIRO:

I would think certainly not.

I think

that most of the questions and the extent of a voire dire
examination must necessarily rest in the discretion of the
trial judge for the most part.

Here, however, we are

confronted with the question of whether any examination at
all with respect to an issue which xtfas crucial not only to
this particular case but crucial to any case where there is
a black criminal defendant on trial before an

overwhelmingly

white jury and where there has been a certain amount of
pretrial publicity and extrajudicial statements connected
with the case»

12
Q

What was the final composition of the trial

period?
MR. SHAPIRO:

The jury was ten white and two black

as finally Impaneled.
Q

And does the state require a unanimous verdict

in a criminal ease there?
MR. SHAPIRO:

It does.

In South Carolina it does

require a unanimous verdict.
Q

But either one, any one juror could have

prevented a verdict?
MR. SHAPIRO:
Q

Yes, that is correct.

Well, then, I take it the answer -- your

response to that other question, Mr. Shapiro, that you are
really concentrating on -- really concerned about the
questions on racial prejudice, essentially, aren’t you, not
wearing app

el and

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, I think that this case involved

two areas in which this court on numerous occasions has
recognized are perhaps the most fundamental areas in'dealing
with Impartiality on juries and that is racial prejudice
and pretrial publicity.

We think these areas certainly are

areas which are essential, that the trial judge examines
jurors with respect to.

There may be other questions which

in other cases are essential to selecting the impartial
jury.

In the case of Mor for cl versus the United States, this

13
court held that a trial judge was required to examine
prospective jurors with respect to whether a loyalty order
would affect their ability as government employees to give
the defendant — who in that case was a communist who had
refused to testify before the unAmerican Activities Committee
so that that inquiry, In the circumstances of that case.,
was crucial.
Q

Is that a constitutional holding?

MR, SHAPIRO:

We think that it was.

The court —

it is a brief per curiam order but in that decision the
court did cite and refer to Dennis versus United States
where the court held that preservation of the opportunity to
prove actual

bias is essential to the selection of an

impartial jury and we think that implicit in that and reliance
of the Morford court on that is that it was, at least with
respect to that federal case, part of the right to an
impartial jury under the sixth amendment.
Q

Are you saying, in effect, Mr. Shapiro, that

the statutory questions that are required there might be
entirely satisfactory for an ordinary routine case but that
when special factors emerge the Constitution requires that
the judge exercise discretion to cover a broader range of
inquiry of the jury?
MR, SHAPIRO:

I think that is a fair statement of

our position which Is that in any — in a given case, the

14
relevance of the area of inquiry, proposed questions to the
issues and the circumstances of the case are what must be
considered and that when dealing with something as
fundamental as the issues in this case, racial prejudice and
pretrial publicity, that the judge cannot refuse to inquire
into these areas.
Q

in
Well, now,/the Aldridge .case back 40-odd years

ago, had the trial judge there asked any questions at all
or had he just refused to make any Inquiry?
MR. SHAPIRO:

Thex'e was a voire dire examination

In the Aldridge case which is set out at 283 U.S. 309 and
that examination did relate to the facts in that particular
case, the bias or prejudice of the juries with respect to
certain kinds of evidence and, certainly, even that
examination was a lot more extensive than the examination
in this case.

The judge in that ease did refuse a specific

question with regard to racial prejudice and this court held
that that refusal violated the essential demands of families
under the circumstances of the case.
In addition to the right of challenge resting on
the sixth amendment right to a jury trial as applied to the
states, we think it also is directly related to the right
to a trial before an Impartial body.

Wa think that the

right of challenge is crucial to selecting jurors who will
not be influenced by passion or prejudice or extrajudicial

15
matters.

We think it is more essential even than the right

which this court recognised in Groppi versus Wisconsin to
obtain a change of venue in certain cases and, indeed, it
is more basic,too, than the right to a cross-section of
the community because this right is one which
satisfied, the right to an impartial jury.

can only be

One can only

determine the partiality of jurors by questionning them
specifically and exercising the right of challenge.
The only position the state takes, basically, in
this case is that the general questions that the judge did
put to the jury satisfied whatever constitutional
requirements there are.

However, to conclude that, vie think

would make the constitutional requirements hollow indeed
because the questions which were asked did not relate in any
way and did not direct the jury’s attention in any way to
the crucial questions which

counsel sought to put to the

j ury.
There was no question at all which could even be
construed as asking the jurors whether they had heard or
had been prejudiced by any of the extrajudicial statements
or the pretrial publicity which had related to the case.
The only question which comes near that is the question as
to whether they had formed or expressed any opinion

with

respect to the case but it must be recognized that at that
time, when that question was asked, the jurors knew nothing

16
whatsoever about the ease.

All they knew was that the

defendant’s name was Gene Ham.
nature of the case was.

They didn’t know what the

They didn’t know what the crime he

was charged, with was and they had no idea of who was going
to testify in the case and as I pointed out before, the
chief prosecution witness was the person who had appeared
on local television several days before, discussing drug
crimes.
In that sense, the case was very close to Turner
versus Louisiana where this court held that contact between
jurors and prosecution witnesses, even without a showing
of actual bias or prejudice v?as enough to deny the defendant
a right to an impartial jury.
The other questions with respect to general bias
or prejudice for or against, we don’t think can satisfy the
requirements of probing racial prejudice,

We think that

this court’s decision in Aldridges in Dennis, In Horford „
indicates that specific inquiries are indeed essential to
securing an impartial jury.
We think it is clear that when jurors are put
formal, hurried questions in open court where an immediate
response is esuaected, they won’t volunteer things such as
whether or not they are prejudiced because of ra.ce.
Q

Was this the kind of proceeding where each

venireman was asked the three questions?

17
MR. SHAPIRO:

That is correct.

Each juror was

called to the — they were all in the box.

The judge went

from one to the other asking —
Q

And repeated the questions.

MR. SHAPIRO:

That is correct.

So that Y?e think that general questions as put would
reduce the right of challenge and the right of examination
to a hollow guarantee.
This court has recognized that the jury is
fundamental to the American scheme of justice but the jury
will only be able to serve its high function if the
procedures are designed to insure impartiality to the
greatest extent possible.
Because Petitioner was deprived of the opportunity
to secure the impartiality in this ease, we think his right
to an impartial jury was denied and that his conviction
should be reversed,
MR, CHIEF JUSTIVE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Shapiro.

Mr. Quinn.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY G. QUINN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. QUINN:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
The facts of this case having been presented in
the Appendix, I will not reiterate them with the permission

18
of the court.
involved.

There basically appear to be two issues

Firstly, the trial Judge’s refusal, and

prejudicial pretrial publicity, questioning as to prejudicial
pretrial publicity on the examination of the jurors through
the voire dire violate their ability to render a fair verdict,
There is no question that a pretrial publicity is
the proper.subject for questioning on voire dire, if there is
a showing that pretrial publicity did exist, that the pre­
trial publicity did refer to the Petitioners that the pretrial
publicity was prejudicial.
In this? case, there was no such showing'.

There was

no pretrial publicity which referred directly to the
Petitioner.

There was no pretrial publicity which was

prejudicial nor was there any pretrial publicity other
than general publicity regarding the drug problem in the '
State of South Carolina, County of Florence which we contend
is no different from any newspaper in the state today that
you cannot pick up without finding some allegation as to
drug use or drug abuse.
The facts in this case reveal that the pretrial
publicity alleged to be prejudicial consisted of three
articles in the same newspaper, published on the same date,
none of which referred to the Petitioner and all dealing only
generally with the drug problem.
Q

Where do we find that in the record?

19
MR. QUINN:
Q

Page 12.

Thank you.

MR. QUINN:

At the top of the page there It states

the "clippings appearing in the Florence Morning News."
Under these circumstances we contend that there -was
no abuse of discretion on the part of the trial judge in
refusing to ask these specifif: questionings sought.
And as for some basis for even conjecture that
specific prejudicial items might have reached the venire9 we
contend that it was wiser for the trial judge to praise the
voire dire examination

in the general terms that he did.

With no showing of pretrial publicity that was
prejudicial the chief question of this appeal becomes whether
the refusal of the trial judge to ask the specific questions
sought on voire dire pertaining to the defendant’s race and
the fact that he wears a beard, the trial judge ruled that
these proffered questions were irrelevant and he asked
general questions Instead and the general questions being,
"Have you formed or expressed any opinions as to the guilt
or innocence of the defendant, Gene Ham?

Are you conscious

of any bias or prejudices for or against, him?

v;as within view of the jury.

He

It was obvious that he was a

negro, that he was black and that he wore a beard.

20

Is it necessary that the trial judge ask, "Are you
aware of any bias or prejudice for or against this defendant
who is a negro, black, and wears a beard?" when these facts
are so obvious.

The state contends not.

Did not the general

questioning presented encompass the specific inquiries sought
by the petitioner?

We think that it did and we think the

effectiveness of this general questioning was proved by the
facts when two jurors stated in response to the general
questions that they could not fairly serve and they were
excused by the trial court.
Q
MR.

MR.
Q

Whichtwo?
QUINN: (Noresponse.)
Whichtwo?
QUINN: I am not aware of — you mean which?
Which two of the wwtnesses?

One you mentioned

on 47 I don’t agree with you that was the reason he was
excused.
MR. QUINN:

I don’t understand your question, your

Honor.
Q

You say there were two witnesses that were

excused?
MR. QUINN:
Q

Hmn?

MR. QUINN:
Q

Yes.

Yes, sir.

Two jurors?

21
MR. QUINN:

Q

Yes, sir.

For- what reason?

MR. QUINN:

When they stated they could not give the

state or the defendant a fair and impartial trial.

Q

The state 03:' the defendant?
QUINN:
Yes.

Or that they had. rather not serve.
It was state or the defendant?

MR. QUINN:
Q

Yes, sir.

It wasn’t the defendant.

I thought you said

defendant.
MR. QUINN:

I apologise I made that error.

The two jurors were excused in response to the
general questioning of voire dire and they were excused by
the court.

Would this not more effectively than any line

of questioning cause the remaining veniremen to be on notice
that they could not serve with an impartial attitude and
would not this cause the remaining veniremen to fairly search
their souls for any prejudice or any partiality which would
prevent their rendering a fair arid impartial trial and a
fair and impartial verdict based upon the facts and evidence
presented?
Q

In South Carolina, do you do the same to persons

on a capital offense?
MR. QUINN:
Q

Yes, your Honor.

The same questions?

22
MR. QUINN:
Q

Yes, your Honor,

Have you ever read

MR. QUINN:
Q

Ibeg your pardon?

Have you ever read Witherspoon against Illinois?

MR. QUINN:
Q

Witherspoon against Illinois?

Yes, I have, your Honor,

Okay.

MR. QUINN:

The sixth amendment of the United

States5 Constitution guarantees the right to trial by an
impartial jury.

It has been held that this includes the

right to challenge for cause. However, I am not aware of
it
any holding that/says the right to preemptory challenge is
included therein.

The right to challenge for cause must be

accompanied by some showing of bias or prejudice which would
affect the jurors5 ability to render a fair and impartial
trial.
Clearly, there was no such showing in the instant
case.
Was the petitioner denied the opportunity to make
such a showing?
or prejudice?

Did he have any grounds to suspect bias
Did he present any grounds to the trial judge

justifying his suspicion?
Q

None of these things were done,

Mr. Quinn, what would have been lost, however,

had the court asked the requested questions?
MR. QUINN:

In this particular instance I don't

think anything would, be lost, your Honor.

I think that the

trial judge xvas concerned with future cases coming before
him.

These were a short number of questions and he did

rule that they were irrelevant.
his discretion to do so.

I think that was within

Howevers I personally do not

think anything has been lost.
Q

Well, I suppose his irrelevancy conclusion

must have been based in the thought that the statutorilyprescribed questions covered the ground.
MR. QUINN;
Q,

I would assume so, your Honor.

Because otherwise they certainly were relevant,
t

weren’t they?
MR. QUIiJN:
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

The attorney printed those references at page

12 to the newpaper clippings.

Were those newspaper clippings

put in evidence or are they in the record of the- ease?
They are not in this appendix, as far as I can find.
<

MR. QUINN:

They were in the records of the —- in

the case that was appealed to the State Supreme Court.
are not in the appendix, that is correct, your Honor.
Q

Well, are they up here, do you know?

MR. QUINN:

I do not think so.

The law, as the petitioner apparently contends,
would be that the sixth amendment to the United States’
Constitution guarantees the right to conduct fishing
expeditions and this, we contend, cannot be so.

If this

They

24
were the law, then the law would reduce the function of
the trial judge and the questioning of voire dire of jurors
to that of a parrot taught to repeat each question submitted
to him, for it is submitted that there is no question, no
matter how innocuous, that might lead to some bias or
prejudice.

For example, I expect that a Christian might have

somewhat biased attitude toward an atheist,

I expect that a

pacifist might be somewhat biased toward a member of the
military establishment and, as your Chief Justice stated,
I expect that someone who has an aversion to pink shirts
might have a somewhat biased attitude to someone who wore one.
But I do not think, I do not contend, that this
existing bias or prejudice would prevent this juror from
rendering a fair and impartial trial upon giving his oath or
affirmation to do so,
I submit that the sixth amendment of the United
States’ Constitution does not guarantee the' right to a
trial by jury from a jury free of all biases, all prejudices
and all partiality.
Q

Of course', Mr. Quinn, even if, at the conclusion

of the answering of these questions by the. jurors, the trial
judge were to say, " I don’t find the juror to be
disqualified,” it might be that the petitioner’s counsel
would have obtained some information that would have helped
him exercise his preemptory challenges.

25
MR. QUINN:

Your Honor, I think this

is a crucial

issue of the case is whether the sixth amendment of the
United States Constitution guarantees the right to probe
into the prospective jurors as to whether — as to the
propriety of exercising of preemptory challenge and I think
this is what I am referring to as a "fishing expedition,"
which I don’t think comes within the confines of the sixth
amendment.
Q

You say, then, that no form of voire dire is

incorporated into the notion of a jury trial as the sixth
amendment?
MR. QUINN:

No, your Honor. I am stating that,

absent some showing, some basis for supporting , the question,
on voire dire, then the unsupported questions can be properly
excluded.
Q

Is this issue raised in the constitutional

right of the Supreme Court of your state?

I notice on the

opinion of the court, at least in the form it appears on
page 102 there is just a brief paragraph discussling this and
it is all in the terms of alleged error at a matter of state
law9 nothing about the United States’ Constitution, nothing
about either the sixth or the fourteenth amendments In your
'Supreme Court’s opinion discussing it and while"the dissent
talks about, a Supreme Court case which it says, "In which
decision is binding upon this court,”! think that you would

26
agree that is probably an erroneous statement because the
Algren case was not a constitutional case.

It just was a

matter of error, was a matter of administration of federal
criminal law,

Was this issue ever raised, this cons»

tltutional issue, or not?

Certainly, it doesn't seem to

have been decided as such by your Supreme Court,
MR. QUINN:

I think the issue was brought to the

attention of the Supreme Court in the arguments of the
defendant at the Supreme Court level,

I do — in the sense

that they alleged and alluded to the fact that he was
denied a fair trial.

I don’t think there was any specific

constitutional issue involved, particularly brought before
the court, rather,
Q

Well, do you place any reliance on that?

MR, QUINN:
Q

I think I do nbtv your Honor.

Generally speaking, we do not consider questions

here that haven't been raised in a timely way up through the
trial and appeal of a case in the state courts and if there
is no federal question properly raised in this court we have
no jurisdiction of this case.
MR. QUINN:

Your Honor, in our brief on certiorari

we did raise this issue and supported it in our brief on.
certiorari — in our brief in opposition to certiorari,
rather, and we were of the contention at that time that no
federal question was presented to the State Supreme Court and

27
we would adhere to this decision or our opinion today.
Q

Well, at least your dissenter to the Supreme

Court referred to Aldridge.
MR. QUINN:
Q

Which is not a constitutional decision.

MR, QUINN:
Q

Yes, your Honor.

That is correct, your Honor.

Well, of course, if you turn to page 101 of

the record at the very bottom, there, in the majority
opinion by Judge Littlejohn — no, I guess that was the
continuance.

I withdraw the question.

That was the

continuance, yes.
MR. QUINN:

The state submits that the sixth

amendment requires not that the jurors be free of all
partiality but that such partiality does not interfere with
their duty to render a fair and impai'tial trial.
Q

What is your definition of the word "impartial?”

MR. QUINN:

A situation in which such partiality

that does exist does not interfere with their rendering of
a trial based upon facts and evidences as presented with
no outside influencing factors, your Honor.
Q

But you could have a bias?

MR, QUINN:

I think everyone possesses some bias

of some type, no matter how slight or how —
Q

And you think a juror that has a bias against

a particular group of people could give an impartial trial?

28
MR. QUINN:

I think that would be an undue assumption*

your Honor.
Q

But you can't ask it., can you?

MR. QUINN:

I can’t state what bias exists in anyone.

I don’t think that anyone can.
Q

I don’t think that --

You don't think anybody is entitled to try

to find out?
ME. QUINN:

I think that they are entitled

to find out. your Honor.
Q

I think they —

Well, how could you find out with that question?

MR. QUINN:

There is no way you could find out with

that question.
Q

Thank you.

MR. QUINN:

However, I do feel that there must be

some groundwork laid for the — prior to the submitting of
the questions to the 'jurors.
Q

I

take it your position is that the questions

that were asked in this case were sufficient to crush out
any prejudice?

You pointed out that several jurors did

respond that they could not be fair.

They were then

excused.
MR. QUINN:

That is correct, your Honor.

that the general questions asked did encompass

I think

the specific

questions sought, absent some showing that the specific
questions might elicit some bias or prejudice and the

29
suspicion that some bias or prejudice exists must have some
grounds for that.
X submit that the sixth amendment requires not
that the jurors be free of ail partiality for such, a perfect
jury does not exist.

A voire dire examination designed, to

uncover all existing bias

or prejudice

or partiality

could lead to the circumstances recognized by one of our
State Supreme Court and X state in .their opinion —- and I
quotes s,The records of the cases appealed to this court in
which ruling3 mads while impaneling the jury have been
involved indicate that there is an increasing tendency to
prolong the proceedings inordinately by allowing counsel on
either side to indulge in tedious examination of jurors
apparently with no definite purpose or object, in view but
with the hope of eliciting something indicating the
advisability of rendering a preemptory challenge and that
the supposed privilege of doing so has been greatly
abused.”
This opinion was rendered in 1912 and I think this
is even more appropriate today.

The congested court docket,

the congested system of judicial administration leads one to
the conclusion that an unlimited voire dire examination
cannot coexist with efficient administration of justice.
There must be some compromise.

We contend that this compro­

mise is the laying of the groundwork for the admission of

30

the particular questions sought.

Absent this groundwork, we

think there is no basis for these questions.
We contend that there was no abuse of discretion
in the instant case, particularly when the judges —■ trial
judge?s voire dire examination encompassed the specific
inquiry sought and was effective to produce a jury which
could render a fair and impartial trial, their verdict being
based upon the facts and the evidence.
Further, we state that it is more effective if the
general question is proved to supply this necessary jury.
For these reasons, we respectfully submit, in conclusion, that
the decision of the South Carolina State Supreme Court be
affirmed.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Quinn.

Mr. Shapiro, you have got a few minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN SHAPIRO, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR, SHAPIRO:

I would like to first address myself

to the point raised by Mr. Justice Stewart with respect to
whether the issue was properly presented below.

In the

briefs in the South Carolina Supreme Court, the petitioner
made the following statements:

"The question is a const!”

fcutional one of due process of law for whether a juror Is
prejudiced or partial in the sense of one of the parties
is denied a fair and impartial trial.

It is not a procedural

31
one to be determined by the statutory construction but one of
vital substantive law under the Constitution.”
That petitioner was referring to the United States'
Constitution as is made clear in the following paragraphs
where he continues and quotes Irvin versus Dowd., Sheppard
varaus Maxwe11 and Ridean versus Louisiana for the proposition
that the refusal to ask the questions designed to Insure
the right to an Impartial trial is included in this court's
pronouncement in those cases.
He further continued and cited the Strauder versus —
""1-Jhitus versus' Georgia..
Q

I take it it is your position that it was in

the Supreme Court of South Carolina that that constitutional
question was first raised,, is it?
MR. SHAPIRO;
fashion, yes.

It v?as explicitly raised in this

That is correct.

We think, however, under

South Carolina practice that it was appropriately raised in
the way it was in the assignments of the South Carolina
Supreme Court and that the fact that the South Carolina
Supreme Court did not explicitly refer to the Constitution
in its opinion does not indicate that it was not presented.
In fact, there were several constitutional issues
that were presented as clearly as this one which the South
Carolina Supreme Court equally neglected to refer to in
its opinion.

32
Q

Well if3 as Justice Brennan pointed out* in

dealing with the motion for a continuance, the South
Carolina Supreme Court explicitly did deal with it as a
constitutional questions citing Powell against Alabama
and so on.

But with this issue, the only issue now before

us, one would never know from reading the opinion of the
South Carolina Supreme Court that that court understood that
it isas faced with a federal constitutional issue.
MR. SHAPIRO:
or reason,

Frankly, I think it is without rhyme

the issues which the South

Carolina Supreme

Court chose to refer to in the federal constitutional terras.
Petitioner also argues that the denial of his rights to a
change of venue expressly violated his right to a fair and
impartial trial under the sixth and fourteenth amendment,
yet the South Carolina Supreme Court makes no reference at
all to the federal Constitution in disposing of that issue.
So we think that that cannot foe taken to mean that they
did not; consider.

We think the issue is whether it was

properly presented and we think that under South Carolina
law it was.
Q

' i

Mr. Shapiro, 1 think these are cases that in

order to successfully raise something in the State Supreme
Court that hasn’t been raised in the trial court,, if the
ordinary state rule is that you must first raise it in the
state trial court.

Don’t you have to show that the Supreme

33
Court of the state passed on the question even though it
did not have to, and then you can bring it here?
MR- SHAPIRO:

We think that under South Carolina

lav/ the issue was presented sufficiently in this case to
present the constitutional issue in the South Carolina
Supreme Court,
Q

You mean South Carolina does not have any

rule of state practice that one must make a constitutional
objection at one’s earliest opportunity?
MR. SHAPIRO:
Q

No.

We think that —

What do you rely on?

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, only the South Carolina

decisions which we have cited again in our reply brief on
certiorari, cases such as State versus Brown, 240 South
Carolina 357 126 S.E. 2nd,

and several other eases

dealing with, voire dire questions we think indicate that
under South Carolina law this was adequately raised and
we are pointed, to no decision to the contrary.
Q

Adequately raised as a matter of constitutional

law?
MR. SHAPIRO:

As a matter of state lav/ and as a

matter of constitutional law.

I think that when this court

looks to a state Supreme Court decision, if an issue is
properly raised under state law with respect to the federal
issue, then this court has jurisdiction to consider it

34
regardless of whether the state supreme court considered it,
Q

True9 but one could raise a voire dire question

in the South Carolina courts either as. a matter of state law
or as a matter of constitutional law and I take it in order
to get it here as a matter of constitutional law you must
show that it was properly raised in the appropriate time
in the South Carolina proceedings or that if it was not,
that the Supreme Court of South Carolina3 even though it
did not have to pass on it, did pass on it.
MR. SHAPIRO;

We think that the cases I have

mentioned to the court indicate that under South Carolina
law a request that certain questions be asked in order to
insure an impartial jury raises the question as far as
South Carolina is concerned under both state and federal
terms and no additional statement is necessary.
Q

Where are those cases cited?

MR. SHAPIRO;

They are cited in our reply brief

on the cert petition.
Q

I don’t seem to have that but if you filed it,

we can find it.
Q
think

Thank you.

I would like to hear your opinion of what you

your view of the constitutional position?
MR. SHAPIRO:

Wells we think that it certainly has

constitutional dimensions.

The court certainly did not

explicitly refer to the Constitution.

It did, however,

35
deal with the issue in terms of the "essential demands of
fairness«u
Q

But it dealt with the District of Columbia

statute9 did it not?
MR. SHAPIRO:

It

dealt with a case coming up under

the —
Q

But Justice Me Reynold.5 s dissent was addressed

only ,to the District of Columbia statute.
MR. SHAPIRO:

Right, but I don’t think that the

issue was a statutory one.

I think the statute dealt with

the mode by which this court could review the decision but
as far as the issue of whether the particular question
should have been asked was
Q

Well, I suppose your argument is anyway, if

Aldridge is not a constitutional decision, something like it
ought now be the constitutional rule.
MR. SHAPIRO:

I think so arid I think that this

court indicated as much in Swain versus Alabama, where the
court stated

that the fairness of trial by jury requires

that the influence of race on jurors be explored.
Q

Mr. Shapiro, if you are pressing, as I assume

you are, the pretrial publicity issue, I am a little sur­
prised that you didn’t put in your appendix what these news­
paper articles

contained.

The reference at page 12 does not

really tell us anything, does it?

36
MR. SHAPIRO:

The newspaper articles, as far as I

know» are not In the trial record.
Q

As ~~

Shouldn't they be, if we are going to put

the situation in contest and determine whether these
}

questions were necessary?
MR. SHAPIRO:

I think that the issue which v$e

are

posing is not whether or not it was such pretrial publicity
as to deny a fair trial.

We are rather suggesting that

•where there has-been pretrial publicity that the duty of a
trial judge is at least to inquire whether jurors have been
prejudiced.
Q

In a case where —
Well, doesn't the content of that publicity,

the substance of it, govern the answer to that?
MR. SHAPIRO:

Mot necessarily,

We think that, for

example, a juror might be prejudiced by publicity which
did not rise to the -- to such as would under this court's
decision deprive him of a fair trial if that juror sat.

The

fact of the matter is, if the juror was exposed, he might
have been prejudiced.
Q

Well, all I see from this record is that there

•were some newspaper articles "about something.
MR. SHAPIRO:

The newspaper articles, as counsel

pointed out to the trial judge, dealt extensively with
problems relating to drug crimes.
Q

Well, "where did they get that information from?

37
MR. SHAPIRO:

Me 11., only from counsel’s statement

that
Q

Well9 that didn’t give me anything except

that there were the names of the newspapers.

Or did I miss

something?
MR. SHAPIRO:

Well* I think counsel only

referred to the fact that
Q

Is this in here from another clipping which

refers to a recent television program and an editorial?
MR. SHAPIRO:
Q

Okay.

MR. SHAPIRO:
Q

And — and the question —

And the question on page 36,

36?

MR. SHAPIRO:

Have you —?

That he requested that

the judge ask —<- stated '’Have you heard or read about recent
newspaper articles to the effect that the local drug
problem —53
Q

Where is that, now?

MR. SHAPIRO:
Q

Whereabouts in that?

MR. SHAPIRO:
Q,.

Proposed question number four.

That Is proposed question.

MR. SHAPIRO:
Q

It is on page 36 of the appendix.

That is correct.

But I mean, where is the ”recent newspaper

article” that is mentioned there?

38
MR. SHAPIRO:

They are not In the record.

They are

not in the record.
Q

Well, what good is it to us if It is not in

the record?
MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, I don’t think that it is any

good at this point.
Q

Well, what

how can you sustain that point?

That they should be asked these questions?
MR. SHAPIRO:

Because our position is not that it

was such prejudicial publicity as to deny him a fair trial
but rather, in view of the showing ~~
Q

Is there anything in this record that shows

that there v'as any publicity on this case?
MR. SHAPIRO:

There Is nothing in the record that

shows that there was any publicity about this specific case.
Q

Is there anything in this record that shows

there was any publicity about anything?
MR. SHAPIRO:

I think that the page 12 indicates

that the clippings that the counsel handed to the judge
dealt with drug crimes in Florence County.
Q

Well,

where Is that?

New, it says, ”1 have

v-pome clippings which 1 would like to give to the court
showing just the kind of publicity that has taken place.
have a clipping hers from the Florence Morning Hews of
May 29th, 1970, another clipping from the Florence Morning

I

39
News which referred to a recent television program which in
an editorial —"

Well, all we got are the names of the

newspapers.
MR. SHAPIRO:

I think that if you read the proposed

question on page 36 in light of that submission of the
questions, it indicates that newspaper articles related to
the fact that the local drug problem is bad, in the words of
counsel.
Q

You mean, you suggest that I go down and. read

those- newspapers?
MR. SHAPIRO:
Q

No, but we submit —

Because I tell you, I am not going to do it.

MR. SHAPIRO:

We are suggesting that this was a

sufficient showing to at least require the judge to ask
whether the

jurors might have been prejudiced because of

them.
Q

Well, wouldn’t the judge first have to ask

the question as to whether there were papers with articles
which the juror could have read?
MR. SHAPIRO:

I think that he had been presented

with articles which the Jurors could have read.
Q

Well, we don’t have them.

MR. SHAPIRO: But we think even more significant
on extrajudicial publicity is the fact that the chief
prosecution witness had testified extensively on a local

ho
television program several days before the trial.
Q

Where is that in this record?

MR. SHAPIRO;

Well, this is — it» again on page 36

proposed question number four —
Q

That proposed question is proof that this man

appeared on a program?
MR. SHAPIRO:

We think that that is sufficient

showing -Q

You do?

MR. SHAPIRO:

— that there was* in fact., such a

television program and that the chief witness did., in fact,
testify on it.

Of course, the judge refused to ask the

questions without any determination as to whether in fact
there had been such a television, program or not.

We think

that the way the case comes up. it is implicit that he
assumes that there was a program and in fact he said that
the question was irrelevant,.. We say that —
Q

Well, perhaps he thought It was

irrelevant

because after reading the newspaper articles he thought they
were so Innocuous,so vague, that that rendered the whole
inquiry irrelevant,
MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, of course, the newspaper

articles didn't relate to this television program and we
think, again, that it must be remembered that this motion
and these questions were posed the day after petitioner was

41
Indicted,

Counsel had no opportunity to prepare a formal

motion, to collect the newspaper clippings, to make a full
presentation to the extent of possible publicity.

He was

forced to go to trial over his objections on the very next
day after the indictment was returned and we think, especially
in light of that unseemly haste, that it was more than
necessary to have the jurors examined with respect to the
Issues he raised.
Q

Well, I understand page 12 that he did hand

the judge clippings, the clippings he was referring to.
MR. SHAPIRO:
Q

I think it can be assumed that —-

They just aren’t here, though.

MR. SHAPIRO;

They are not here and I think that

they were not the only clippings, although of course I
can’t state that as a fact.

The fact of the matter is,

counsel was not prepared to go to trial on the day after
the indictment.

He had not been able to prepare a motion

which could have set forth all of the clippings, all of the
parameters of the publicity and especially in light of that
we think that it was more than usually necessary to explore
the potential for prejudice on the members of the jury.
Q

Of course, Mr. Shapiro, of the four questions

that the judge refused to ask, only one of them had to do
with pretrial publicity.

The other three had nothing

whatsoever to do with pretrial publicity.

42
MR. SHAPIRO:

That5s right.

The .fourth question

which,, of course, Is a —
Q

So that if you are right about the first three9

the matter of pretrial publicity doesn't really — is not
dispositive at all in this case.
MR. SHAPIRO:
Q

That is correct.

Is that correct?

Yes.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Shapiro.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 2:0o o'clock p.m., the case was
submitted.)
