ORAL ARGUMENT OF L. Sfl

5N PORTER, ESQ.r

C-t-J BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
HR. PORTER;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
This case involves two regulations of the
California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control, which
provide that a California

State on-sale alcoholic beverage,

license may not be held on premises fox- the sale and
consumption of alcohol where certain sexually oriental acts
conduct, or visual displays are employed on the premises.
The regulations vrere enacted after legislative hearings
before the California Department of Alcoholic Beverage
Control.
Now-, it was developed at these hearings, first,
that alcohol acts as a depressant upon the control centers
of the- brain, which normally inhibit the so-called base
behaviors, in that persons consuming alcohol may and do
engage in acts and conduct which they would not.engage in
if not drinking.
Secondly, it was developed that parsons under the
influence of alcohol are more/ likely to be sexually

vtirmlated by viewing sexual material, sexual conduct and
acts, end that they are more likely to engage in sexual
activity or conduct on premises which afford or offer such
sexually oriented entertainment«

And they enjoin their enforcement?

MR. PORTER: That * 6 correct.
QUESTIONHave there been any license revocation

MR. PORTER:
QUESTION:
MR. PORTER;

No —
— against any of these plaintiffs?
— the regulations become effective

a number of days after their promulgation enactment or
placement in fch® California Administrative Code.

Before

their effective date, these actions ware broughtboth
-

The Federal District Court in Los Angeles withheld any
action# pending action by the State Courts»
The California State Courts refused to hear the
cases# refused to enjoin the regulation.
QUESTIONs

X wonder if there were a Younger

problem in this case# Younger y. Harris? are you familiar
with that case and its companions?
•MR. PORTER:

Not completely. There was no

not familiar with it.
QUESTION:

But when it's set in the State Courts#

you — what —- render a declaratory injunction# or a
declaratory judgment or injunction?
MR. PORTERS

Yes# the action for declaratory

relief and injunction was brought in the State Courts#
the State Courts refused#the plaintiffs went to the
California Court of Appeal# California
QUESTION:

-

You say they refused to hear the

dismissed proceedings?
MR. PORTER: These were on petitions.

Regulations

and/or decisions of the California Department of Alcoholic
Beverage Control are reviewable either by petitions for

6
writ

review in. the California appellata Courts, or under
rit of mandate proceeding, which would bo

similar to declaratory relief, to check the validity c
•

■

-

Lscretionary with the Cali it

Appellate Courts, whether or not they entertain.
QUESTION :

And discretion was exercised against

entertaining the proceedings?
MR. PORTERs

Against entertaining - *

QUESTION : And on appeal that was sv stained, ic
that it?
MR, PORTER:

The plaintiffs then want to the

California Supreme Court and our office requested that the
State Supreme 'Court take the case and take the challenge
and decide it. The State Supreme Court refused, denied
hearing the case.
QUESTION:

Well, then, I take it, that the case

is here so far as the action of the three-judge — opinion
of the three-judge court is concerned.

There is no pending-

state proceeding, and can be none because the State Courts
have refused to entertain one, is that it?
MR. PORTER: That’s correct.
QUESTION:

Mr. Porter, do you draw any inference

whatsoever from the refusal of the California

Courts to

take these cases up?
MR. PORTER:

Only one perhaps, in all honesty.

7
Just prior to these regulations being enacted» there was a
■

•

•

Alcoholic Beverage Control» a case decided by the California
Supreme Court.

That case» which came up before these

regulations, involved the employment of topless waitresses
in a San Francisco bar.
QUESTION;

In that case­ as I understand it, they*

in effect, invited the Department to issue, to formulate
regulations of this kind.
MR. PORTER?

That's correct.

They were disturbed,

according to their decision, by the fact that there was
no evidence, there were no regulations, just a sterile
stipulation, that topless waitresses were employed.
QUESTIONi

So, to get back to my other question,

can you draw any inference from the denial of hearing this
by the State Courts?
MR. POSTER;

That perhaps they had just had a case

where there was no evidence in the record, no regulations
involved, and they did not want to take on a subsequent
case in the absence of what they might have thought was an
absence of an evidentiary record.
QUESTION;

You don't infer that in the eyes of

the State Court, the regulation is perfectly valid, do you?
HR. POSTER;
QUESTION;

That’s possible.

I would not —

Would not violate it?

MR, POETER;
QUESTION:

would not. violate it.
Mr. Porter, do you regard this c

essentially a licensing case or an
MR. PORTER:

•

Licensing, Your Honor.

As indicated; the legislative hearing before the
Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control developed the effect
of alcohol upon persons imbibing in it, and also developed,
through the testimony of various law enforcement officials
in California, through Department investigators, that where
this type of sexually oriented entertainment is provided on
premises where alcoholic beverages are sold and consumed on the
premises, that their resultant problems on such premises,
including overt sexual acts between the employees, the
entertainers, and the customers, B-girl activity, as indicated

by officials from San Francisc

lice Department, where, in

1964, they had almost come to iuiil on B-girl activity, and
the introduction'of the sexually oriented entertainment in
on-sale bars in San Francisa©, that caused B-girl activity to
reach almost epidemic proportions.
Prostitution increased around such premises,, where

yon have this mixture, the prostitutes congregating where
you have the sexually oriented entertainment, sexually
stimulating entertainment, plus the customers imbibing in
alcoholic beverages.
Narcotic and drug crimes increased, at or near such

9
promisss» vielan.t crimes:, exploitation of customers , overt
tOUl

extensive law enforcement problems, which we’ve set out in the
brief.
Accordingly the California Department of Alcoholic
Beverage Control adopted these regulations in or ;i ,n: to tv. 1
and prevent the serious problems and offenses that ;voccurring on licensed alcoholic beverage premises in
California.
Now# as indicated# the regulations were attached by
various licensees in the Los Angeles and Southern California
area in both the State and Federal Courts, and when the
State Courts refused to entertain these cases, the three™judge
Federal District Court in Los Angeles heard the case.
On a two-to-one decision, the lower court held,
relying on Roth and other oases, decisions by this Court,
the lower court held that the sexual acts and conduct# and
visual displays that were -proscribed by the department
regulations were protected expression under the First
Amendment and the State could regulate them only on the
grounds of obscenity.

That inasmuch as the department

regulations do not deal with obscenity, did not require
standards of proof as to obscenity# the regulations must fall.
In addition# you will note that it is clear that#
when on© reads the lower court’s decision# they took the

10
position that regardless of the alleged pur
department in enacting the regulations, that they asstuaed
and determined that the department’s motive

;as he circumvent

tha obscenity laws, and not to try and pa-vent the problems
which the legislative record had shown.
How, the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control
argument is threefold.
First, that the sexual activities and sexual
conduct regulated by these regulations are net and do not
constitute symbolic speech, they are not and do not constitute
expression, and are riot within the protection of the First
Amendment.
Secondly, that even if this Court should determine
that they are within the First Amendment, that a State may
regulate First Amendment activity on grounds or interests
other than, obscenity, that obscenity is not the sola touchstor
the State is required to use in attempts to regulate First
Amendment activity.
QUESTION?

Mr. Porter, in your argument here, is

it based at all on the Twenty-First Amendment, dealing with
the State authority over regulation of alcoholic beverages?
MR. PORTER:

Based to the extent that if we are in

the First Amendment area, then as far as balancing the State's
interests, we submit that both the traditional power that a
State has had over -the conditions surrounding the sale of

II
alcoholic fc ;

:

»g ana the power given to the States under

the Twenty-First Amendment must be considered in balancing fch
State interests, that these are substantial and important
State interests , whe

we*re talking about the conditions

surrounding the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages.
We have never argued, nor would we ever argue, that
the Twenty-First Amendment would automatically cvorride th ;
First Amendment, or any other part of the Constitution *
We only urge that —
QUESTION: Well, it has been held that the TwentyFirat

;; V.

.,:;ear

l

commerce clause,

hasn't it?
MR. PORTER: Well, —
QUESTIONs And it does, by its terms.

MR,

t1 s correct? but I —

QUESTION: And it has been held that the TwentyFirst Amendment overrode a good deal of the equal protection
clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, hasn't it?

It was in the

case-,

MR. PORTER:

Yes, but; I would submit that —* or I

would, myself, attempt to temper that somewhat, to the
extent I think it shows an overriding State interest in
weighing between the commerce clause and the Twenty-First
Amendment, where you get up in equal protection, where you
get up into the First Amendment or some so-called, alleged,

12
preferred amendments of the Constitution»
/is I said, we do not argue that it overrides the
First Amendment»

If we're dealing in a First.Amendment area,

that great weight Should bo given to the State’s interest and
power under the Twenty-First Amendment, in balancing a:-A
weighing,-the State interest outweigh, the State interest to
ba protected under th© First Amendment«
QUESTION % But I gather, Mr. Portor» that that
viewpoint, at least, is now a tentative argument, your basic
argument is that there is no First Amendment right

1.

c'i.Vi::;

here at all?
MR. PORTERs

That’s correct.

And thirdly, we argue that a Federal Court may not.
enjoin or invalidate otherwise valid regulations, on the
grounds that it believes a bad motive influenced the regu­
lations »
Sow, first of all, as to this not being First
Amendment activities, we submit that public and commercial
acts, such as masturbation, oral copulation, sodomy,
exposure of the genitals, do not constitute symbolic speech or
expression, and that such acts and conduct do not contain
a recognizable, significant speech element entitling them
to First Amendment protection*
And assuming that dancing is protected by the
firni .imancKtant, which is the main argument of the licensees

13
in this casa,, vs® submit that the licensees may not make
such a lax in conduct, visual displays, dancing by merely
calling it dancing,- or the fact that tech acts or ornnlnct
engaged in, with music being played, or that they may do

some dance steps up to the act, or dance away from the act,
does not make these acts, the sexual acts, sexual conduct,
dancing; sexual conducts and acts are sexual conducts and a<
Furthermore, we would submit that if the live
sexual acts or conduct or displays are not speech, it does
not seem rational to us to say that by merely putting such
acts and conduct on film that they are transformed into
speech the minute they are put on the film and visually
displayed by film rather than live.
QUESTION! Well, a murder might not be speech, X
suppose we would agree that it isn't, and yet the depiction
of a murder, in a movie or a play, simulated, certainly is
protected by the First Amendment, isn't it?
MR. PORTER?

Yes, but here we're dealing with

regulations that do not want the sexually oriented entertain­
ment, whether it be on film or whether it foe live, and we're
not looking to the context.

I suppose if one just showed a

murder and nothing more —
QUESTION: Well, take Othello.

Or take countless

works of drama through the ages, they're certainly protected
by the First limendment.

14

m. PORTER ;

We11, a11 rigbt.

As to that, we would •

it is within

Amendment, that the State hare can show a proper* acre
significant interest , a more outweighing interest, in
preventing the display of such films on premises where
alcoholic beverages are being consumed, conceding that it
would be First Amendment film — protected by the First
Amendment.
We believe the State can properly restrict such
films from prestiges where alcoholic beve
sold and consumed.
QUESTIONS

Then the Twenty-first Amendment does

encroach upon the First?
MR. PORTER?

Well, it would encroach in the sense

that that is the interest of the State involved here,, over
the control of conditions surrounding the sale of
alcoholic beverages.

So the TWentyrfirst would be in the

State’s traditional power. Absent the Twenty-first over
conditions surrounding the sale of alcoholic beverages.
QUESTION;

Do the regulations prohibit the selling

of books?
MR. POSTER;

I submit if the legislative — no,

the regulations do not.
QUESTION: The point is, do you have to go as far
as you’re going?

That's my only point.

ME. PORTERS

Yes.

QUESTION:

Well, —

'X think you’re going a la

MR. PORTER:

— Mr. Justice Marshall, the regulations

do not prohibit books.

If the legislative hearing record

before the Department shows that books were sold on even
.premises, where'you had sexually oriented took» visually
displayed, combined with persons drinking alcohol, that you
had these bad results occurring, then I assume the Department
'-

prohibi ti

against sexually oriented books being sold on the premises.
QUESTIONs

That would only be under the Twenty”

first Amendment?
MR. PORTER:

No? I submit that it would be under

the State’s traditional broad police powers over alcoholic
beverages, in that —
QUESTION:

Wall, do you assume at the present time

there are some books that cannot be prohibited for sale in
California?
MR. PORTER? Do I assume that there are books that
cannot be prohibited from sale?
QUESTION:

Yes.

But the books may be prohibited from the

bar and no place else?
MR. PORTER:

If there was a proper basis for it,

yes.
QUESTION: Well, what is that under, then, if not the

Pi r s t Arne n d m ® r, t ?
MR. POSTER:' Well, under this Court *s decision in
United States vs. O’Brien, I suppose if it was shewn that
whenever

a certain book or certain types .of book were presen

on a bar» that it would result always in breaches of the
peace.

That there is.a book on protest of war, and that

when peoples were drinking in bars, that the record showed
that nine times out of ten where they had this book in a bar
and.people were drinking, you automatically had a breach of
the peace.
QUESTION:

Do you recognise the difference between

tearing up a draft card and selling a type of book?
MR. PORTER:

Yes.

QUESTIONs Thank you.
QUESTIONs

It seems to me, Mr. Porter, that — and

I had this feeling reading through the briefs, that you’ve
got this case turned around.

The California Department of

Alcoholic Several Control has not prohibited these things
big on in the State of California anywhere, it simply
prohibited the sale of liquor by the drink? and that’s its
function, its jurisdiction. And I should think that you
could validly argue, whether — you could make the argument
that under the very broad autonomous police power given
to the States under the Twenty-first Amendment and
historically, that California could prohibit selling liquor

by the drink in a bookstore if it wanted to, or within a
himdrad feet of a church if it wanted to, without violating
either the freedom of free press or freedom of religion.
You’re dealing with liquor by the drink, you’re not
prohibiting these things from going on, you're prohibiting
liquor from being sold.

Isn’t that true?

MR. PORTERs Well, I would endorse that# yes.
QUESTION:

Well# you don’t say that anywhere in

your brier very clearly.
QUESTION: That, was the purport of my quaaticij

-/*

you, whether this was a licensing case or an obscenity case.
It’s a licensing case relating to the sale of liquor, as
Mr. Justice Stewart emphasized.

And what else, what other

business is transacted in conjunction with that is a matter
for the State police power of California.
At least so I would understand the State’s position,
MR. PORTERS

Yes.

Well, aside from that position that the State is
merely licensing liquor by the drink and gust saying where
it may be sold, I would like to point out that nonetheless,
assuming that it should be found that the conduct, the
acts, 'the displays that are prohibited by these regulations
from being performed or being offered on on-sale alcoholic
beverage premises are within the First Amendment, and
there is a question as to the State, that the Stato is

18
actually trying to regulate First Amendment activity and not
trying to do something in furtherance of alcoholic beverage
control.
Wo submit that a State may regulate on grounds
other than obscenity, that the

on b

lower court were often the obscenity cases, and relied on
by the licensees, deal solely where

State is proceeding

against acts or conduct on the promises, that they are
obscene.
And, as we have indicated, that is not the State's
interest here.
This Court set down the criteria in United States
vs. O'Brien.

We have indicated in our brief how we feel

that is met by the State's regulations.
QUESTION:

Mr, Porter, counsel for the appellee has

argued that these regulations, whatever else may be said .for '
them or against them, are overbroad and vague.

Would you

care to comment on that before you conclude your argument?
MR. PORTER:

We submit that they arc not over-*

broad and vague, they proscribe specific sexual acts,
specific sexual conduct, they ara limited
QUESTION:

l thought they proscribed the sale of

liquor on certain premises.
MR. PORTER:

In their form, the regulations state

that an on-sale license will not be held on premises which

offer these —

beverages within 500 yards of a school?

Stewart, said, the rules are turned around.

When you have a monopoly State and don’t per'...it

which Justice Stewart is pressing on?

Could they validly

MR. HERTZBERG:

If you can show* that the State of

California has scientific evidence of some kind in a legis­
lative hearing that would constitutionally permit them to
find that there were some logical and reasonable correlation
between t-he sale of gasoline where liquor is cold, then I
would say yes.
But more so in a First amendment rights situation.
That’s what we have here.
Going back to the legislative hearings in this case?
1 contend •— we contend — that the State of California must

indecent exposuresr on© attempted raps, one actual raps by
alleged patrons, and two general statements that crime was on

And that's after three days of testimony,

inviting every lo.tr enforcement officer in the State to

Each and every one of the parade of horribles here
is grounds for disciplining the license of the licenses.
There is no need, as these rules in this case before this
Court at this time, to take away the First Amendment rights,
which we feel will be taken away as a condition of the
exertion of a privilege, because hare we are not talking about
the type of conduct, as the appellant alleges occurred in
O’Brien.

This is directly communicative activity.
1 don't stand here and ask this Court to think or

believe that every bar in the State of California carries
on the type of activity which the appellant picked out and
chose to put in his brief in this case.

These are by far

the exception.
If, in California, or any State I would believe,
any activity occurs of this nature, any contact between a
patron and an entertainer, it would be proscribed in addition

QUESTION:

Mr. Hertaberg, do you think the State

validly forbid the sale of liquor in the lobbies of all
theaters?

Or the sale, up and down the aisles of all

theaters?
■;

• "nr Scholtas will probably

argue that point, in that we feel that the State could not
validly exclude the sale of alcohol in the lobbies of all
theaters.
On the same theory that we argue here, because
there's no rational or scientific showing that the drinking
of that alcohol will result in any criminal activity.
QUESTION: Do you have any case on that?

27
MR. HEAR2SEI\Gs

I have no case on that? except this

Glnssburg case? in which —
OUESTJGMs Well? what has obscenity got to do with
selling liquor in the lobby of a theater?
MR. HERT2BSRG?

Obscenity really has nothing to do

with selling liquor in the lobby of a theater.

We just tael

that if a man has a liquor license and he operates a theater?
and the sale of the liquor is a necessary element to his
operation, then;what you’re doing is? you're placing upon
the patrons of that theater and the owner an unconstitutional
burden, and carving away the First Amendment rights of what
ho can show if yon —
QUESTIONS Well? how do you get the First Amendment
right in the man taking a drink in the lobby of a theater
which is showing Othello?
MR. HE&TZBERGs

Mr. Justice Marshall? it is true?

the way you pose your question? it doesn't meet identically
•the rules in this case.

This case is a different case than

your question.
However? I believe it would indirectly create the
identical result? and that is? if you say to a man he can’t
sell liquor in the lobby of a theater? and he sells liquor
in the lobby of the theater? he will either lose his license
or he will be criminally prosecuted.

28
QUESTIONS

Is this equal protection you’re arguing,

or First Amendment?
MR. HERT2BERG: First Amendment, sir.
Now#
QUESTIONS Well, suppose the State says you can’t
sell liquor in the entrance to an iron foundry.

I'm trying

to get something away from the First Amendment * We agree the
iron foundry is away from the First Amendment?
MR. HERTZBERG:
QUESTION:

Yes# Your Honor.

Well, could they do that?

MR. HERTZBERG:

I would agree to that.

QUESTION: The State could do it?
MR. HERTSBERGs

With no First Amendment right# the

State could do that.
QUESTION: Well, is there any other reason they
couldn't do it?
MR. HERTSBERG: Well, other than the fact that it
may discriminate against iron foundry workers under the
Fourteenth Amendment.

Probably if they could lick that,

probably they could do it.
QUESTION:

Well# doesn't the two o'clock closing

law discriminate against workers at night?
MR. HERTSBERG:

I think that's a reasonable

disc rimina tion.
QUESTION:

All right

29
Of course, historically — well, v?e
have to argue at this time the regulations as they come before
this Court.
Briefly, in answer to Mr. Justice Stewart's
initial younger vs. Harris argument, we filed this action
originally on behalf of the plaintiffs in the. Superior Court:,
of the County of Los Angelas in declaratory relief, and
requested an injunction in the Superior Court, which is the
lower trial court.

We were denied hearing.

We petitioned the District Court of Appeals for
writ of mandate and were denied a hearing.
We petitioned the Supreme Court of the State of
California, and were denied hearing.

Both on behalf of

entertainers, dancers, and bar owners.
i

QUESTION:

Mr. Hertsherg, then the California

courts assigned no reason for their refusal to consider your
petitioner.

None of them did, is that it?

Is that right?

i

MR. HEKT2BERG!

No, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, merely

a postcard saying "denied".
As the appellant herein says, he requested a
hearing along with us in the Supreme Court, and it was denied
on both sides.

The dissent in the Federal District Court

below did feel that there was a Younger vs. Harris problem,
but we went through every court in the State and didn't
got heard

QUESTIONS

Mr. Hertzberg « do you have any comment

on that refusal, do you draw any inference from it, or is it
a routine procedure in California?
MR. HERTZBESG: Well, I very honestly state, Mr,
Justice Blackman, J know one thing that the California Stnarera
heart,

like this Court, doesn’t like to give, advisory

opinions.

And whether that was their theory, or not, it would

merely be conjecture on ray part.
However, in California, you can only contest a
■l

.'.-oiplinary proceeding on a liquor license by going through

certain administrative procedures.

We filed the complaint in

this case prior to the effective date of the rules, to enjoin
- -

I believe it was prior, it may have been concurrently

therewith —* to enjoin their enforcement on the theory that
it would be irreparable damage, of which the appellant
agreed.

They wore going to enforce them. And that the loss

of these licenses would be irreparable.
We did not wait until the licenses were revoked
there, until disciplinary proceedings had been institi
QUESTION: Does California have a procedure whereby
one can get a judicial review of administrative rule-making
which, I take it, is what you sought her© rather than
administrative adjudication?
MR. HSRTEBERG t

I would answer that question in

this regard, but I would refer the answer to Mr. Scholtz, I

believe on declaratory relief we probably could.
We would submit, furtherf that the way the rwlee
are drafted, they are overbreadth the Smith vs. California
problem, which Mr. Solicits will take up with the Court, ere
such that, or in a manner that, they do deny, the licensees
herein ‘the proper exercise

the licensees and dancer

plaintiffs the proper exercise of their First Amendment
rights as a condition to the owning of a liquor license.

No different than NAACP vs. Button and those line of cases,
■ -r --- 'i- rr

requiring the foregoing of an oath, et cetera, to maintain
your license.
That5s the basis of our argument herein.
The District Court below said that if it's not
obscene, there's nothing wrong with it? and they can't take
your license away.

Because obscenity has been the standard

since 1957, as decided by this Court in Roth.
But to accept these rules, taking things out of
context and merely saying if an act simulates an act of
intercourse, simulates — whatever that may mean — that's
grounds for disciplinary proceeding. Even if. it's in a
picture on the wall. . Because it involves movies, still
pictures, and entertainment of any kind and nature whatsoever.
The injunction granted in the Federal District
Court in this case specifically excepted any contact between
any entertainer and a patron, a person in the bar.

Which are

32

90 parcent of the parade of horribles listed in the briefs#
in the brief of the appellant herein.
We submit that from time immemorial* dancing?
entertainment of that kind* as this Court said in Stanley
vs. Georgia, the line isi too elusive to draw .between conveying
ideas in entertainment* that whether it's.vulgar or whether
it's refined# whether it's ugly or whether it's elegant* it
receives the same protection* and that test.is the ch :..

nhv

test that’s been laid down so strong and hard.
To sustain the ru2.es in this case would take us
back to Hicklin# prior to Roth.
The activity# the dancing, is direct communication,
Tv.is is not# as 1 previously said# an O’Brien case.

In O’Brien

this Court held that when speech and ncnspeoch elements are
combined in the same course of conduct., a sufficiently
governmental interest in regulating the nonspeech -element
can justify incidental limitations on First Amendment
•

' '• ■ t

i-‘

freedoms*
But the Court further went on# in O'Brien# and
MM, .-k. •-

• V

.‘.yt.-C.t’l.. i*

it

stated# referring to Sfcromberg vs. California# the red flag
waving case# "since the statute there in San Bernardino#
California* was aimed at suppressing communication# it could
not be sustained as a regulation of noncommimicative conduct”#
citing Brandenburg .vs. Ohio# which required the incitement
to action

33
We submit that the conduct hers, or the content
of the conduct here, cannot be changed from speech to symbolic
speech or nonspeech merely by changing the name.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Hertssberg, is ifc a fair summary

of your position, or is it not fair, to say that you’re
contending that what the ST ate —~ because the State can’t
prohibit something in a theater, ifc can’t prohibit it in a
bar either?
MR. HERT2BBRG? That is correct.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, Mr. Hertzberg.

Mr. Scholts.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH PHILIP SCHOLT2, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OP THE APPELLEES
MR. SCHOLTZ:

Yes, thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
I think it’s clear that this case involves a
conflict between the state’s police power to control alcohol
and the First Amendment.

1 think it’s clear that these

rules would be overbroad, overbroad and vague under the
First Amendment, if there were no question of alcohol
involved, in that they prohibit — well, X could tick
off a .list of movies that couldn’t be shown in a bar under
these rules, from s,Cat'ch~22" to "Summer of e42®,

I could

tick off a list of master works of art, including probably

half of the output of Picasso, that couldn’t be shown.
So let me ask a rhetorical question!
require bar;:

. be racially segregated?

Could a State

After holding

hearings wherein police officers testified that fights between
persons of opposite races are more likely to occur when they’re
drinking, and therefore the State says that bars are required
to be racially segregated.
I say it could not do so.

That would foe an

impermissible conflict between the Fourteenth Amendment and the
State's police power over alcohol.
Similarly, 1 think, in this case, the Stata cannrf
■.

; :■ titutio:lal discrimination against exercise of

First Amendment rights, simply because alcohol is involved..
To respond to Mr. Justice Burger's question at*the
beginning, let me distinguish this between a rule that soya
a bar cannot he located, say, within 600 feat of a church, m
California does —California says you cannot put a bar within
600 feet of a church — but California doss not say, and I
submit it could not say, that you cannot put a church within
600 feet of a bar.
And California does not say that if you have a bar
at a place and a church comes in within 600 feat that the bar
has to go.
Because, l would also say this, that the rule
respecting, for example, the distance to churches, is intended

35
to protect the persons who go to the churches*

These rules

are intended end expressly intended to control what the people
do inside the bar, without regard to where it is located,
without regard to what effect it may have an anyone else
outside the bar.
So there is a clear distinction here between this
type of a rule, which directly applies to the conduct inside
of a bar, which directly restricts what can go on inside a bar/.
QUESTIONs
how you put it»

Wall, again, perhaps it’s according to

But 1 thought this had to do with places

where liquor could be sold, not to what conduct goes on inside
of a building, but whether or not liquor could be sold there»
MR, SCHOLTSs
QUESTIONS

Well, —

In other words, it's similar to a State

saying no liquor shall be sold by the drink in a church,
MR. SCHOLTZs
QUESTION:

I don’t think it is.
and the question is —-

MR. 8GH0LT2s

I don’t think it is*

QUESTION:

would that violate the person’s

freedom of religion,
MR. SCH0LT3s

I don’t think it is. Suppose th®

church had that type of a rule.
QUESTION:

No, I'm talking about th© ST&t® having it.

MR, SCHOLTSs

All right, th© State having the rule*

No sale of liquor in a bookstore or in a church.

That does

36
not mean that a bar automatically becomes a bookstore or a
church because it happens to - sell a book or becomes it haerens
to conduct religious services.»

It1 a a question of where the

da'ss ifieation starts.
QUESTIONS

It’s a question of how you put it# but .

MS. SCHOLTZs. No, X think it's a question of where
o- V<

the classification starts.
QUESTIONs

— this particular State agency has to do

with regulating the sale of liquor.
MR. SCHOLTZs

That's correct.

And 1 think that ~~

QUESTION: And that's all it's purported to regulate.
isn't it?
MR. SCHOLTZs

No, X don't think so.

X think this

really purports to regulate the content of entertainment at a
bar.
QUESTION?

Places where liquor can be sold.

MR. SCHOLTZs

What this rule says, and 7. think this '

is important, I don't think it's just a case of how you put
it.

This rule discriminates between types of entertainment.

It says entertainment can take place inside a bar, except
that the entertainment can't have this, and it can't have
that, and it can't have something else.
X think this is an unconstitutional discrimination
between types of entertainment, and that X think the
Constitution would require that type of discrimination, made

37
on the basis of obscenity.
QUESTION?

Is this the Fourteenth or First?

ME. SCfJOLT2s
QUESTIONs

First.

WeIX, the tost would be the Fourteenth

also, wouldn't it?
MR. SCHOLTZ: Well, the First and Fourteenth.
QUESTION: That is, in the State of California -•*
MR. SCI-IQLTZ:
QUESTION:

First and Fourteenth.

— not the federal government.

MS. SCHOLTZ:

It’s not a direct application of the

First or the Fourteenth.
QUESTION:

You reject the position of the State

that this is a licensing case rather than a First Amendment
case?
MR. SCHOLTZ: Well, it's obviously both.
It is both a licensing case and a First Amendment
case.
It involves, as I said earlier, the conflict between
•the First Amendment and the licensing power.
As Jsve said, I don't think this is a mere question
of terminology and how you put it.
QUESTION;

Well, do they have a rule about lighting-

in the bars in California?
MR. SCHOLTZ:

X think there's just a general rule

that says that the bars have to have sufficient light — for

the investigators to see what's going on when they walk in.
QUESTION: Does that in

the participants,
I don’t think that the Department of Alcoholic
Beverage Control could condition the issuance of a license
upon the applicant taking the oath, that this Court held was
unconstitutional in Speiser vs. Randall.

Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control could condition the

Shelton v. Tucker.

MR. SCH0LT2:

Right.

Shelton v. Tucker.

X don’t think there's any question that the State
couldn't do that.

X don't think the State can condition the

40
issuance of a license upon the refusal of the licensee to
erercise his First Amendment rights in a manner which
discriminates, the way this rule discriminates, the way this
rule discriminates between types of entertainment,
I don't think a State can say, “You can show ’Bambi
but you can't show 'Summer of *42' inside the bar."

That's

what I think is unlawful discrimination.
QUESTIONS

Mr. EchoIts, early’in

your brother on the other side I asked about the Younger

.jSKJV

problem.

I'm interested now in another preliminary question

in this case.

I've read Judge Ferguson's opinion bsforo I

got here, and I've just glanced over it again now,

I have a

hard time finding, in his opinion, any conclusion that the
remedy at law was inadequate or that there was irreparable
s

harm*

That, of course, would .be necessary as a condition to

the issuance of this injunction.
MS. SCHOLTZs

I don't think there was, the joint

pretrial statementI think, contained those elements:

that

there was irreparable harm, or there would be irreparable
harm from the enforcement of these rules, and that the remedy
at law was inadequate.
QUESTION? There’s no finding, however, that I can •unless you can find it in this discussion of Blount y« Risasi
and Freedman v. Maryland, I suppose by implication.
Otherwise, this was impermissible, wasn't it, the

41
injunction?
MR. SOHOLT2s

Nof I don't think it was impermissible

QUESTIONS Why?
ME. SCHOLTZ:

If the Court refero to tie record,

there was a joint pretrial statement filed, joined in by all
parties and the Court, in which the statements that there war
irremedial harm here,
no injunction.
Mow, if Judge Ferguson neglected to put that in his
opinion, I don't think that removes the jurisdiction.

That is

in the record.
It's also the case that the State Courts, as we've
said, did refuse to take the case.
In answer to Mr. Justice Rehnquist's question
earlier, there is a type of declaratory relief remedy
available, and that is what was done in this case, because
the State of California, in a liquor case, requires you to go
to the appellate courts rather than to the trial court level;
and the appellate courts apparently have the discretion to
refuse to take the case, which is what they did.
QUESTION:

This is a discretionary denial for

relief, but it can be available under California laxv?
MR. SCHOLTZ; That’s right.

It’s a discretionary-

denial of a relief that can be available.
no place for us to go.

And then there was

...

been exhausted.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Do you have anything

further, Mr. Porter?

MR. PORTER;

No, Your Honor.
