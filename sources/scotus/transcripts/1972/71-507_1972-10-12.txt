MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear argument

if- No. 71-507, Keyes against the School District of Denver.
Mr,. Mabrit, you may proceed whenever you are
ready„
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES M. NABRXT, III, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR,. NA.BRIT:

Mr. Chief Justice,- and may it pi ease

the Court:
The Keyes case is hare on writ of certiorari to
review a judgment of the Tenth Circuit which in part
affirmed and in part reversed an order requiring limited,
desegregation measures in the public schools of Denver,
Colorado,

Petitioners' submission is that the Denver system

has violated the constitutional rights of Black and Hispano
children to equal protection of the laws and that the courts
below should have required a more comprehensive plan to
desegregate the schools and otherwise eliminate 'discrimination.
Although the case comes from a state which had no
statutory dual system, we see the case not as involving socalled de facto segregation issues but rather as one with
segregation practices of the kind the Court has been dealing
with in the cases since Brown against the Board_of Education.
Both courts below agree with us that the Denver School Board
engaged in deliberate segregation practices in shams and

subterfuges, to use the words of the Tenth Circuit, to
segregate.

But the courts below failed, we think, to accord

the mil remedy to which the petitioners are entitled.
Q

The courts below, both of them, as I undersea: d

it, thought that so far as. the core area of Denver went, it
was de facto and not de jure segregation.,

Am 1 mistaken about

that?
MR. -SFABRXT:

No, that is correct.

My task in the

argument is to discuss the issues in part one of our brief
dealing with racial segregation, the issues you refer to,
Mr. Justice Stewart.

And Mr. Gordon Greiner will speak next

to discuss whether the operation of inferior schools for
Black and Hispano children also violates the Equal Protection
Clause and requires relief.
Q
correct?

Assuming no de jure segregation; is that

That branch of the argument.
MR. NABHIT:

We think that either ground,

segregation or inequality, is sufficient, to justify an order
to desegregate the schools, and argue also that both grounds
together justify such a complete remedy.

After I briefly talk

about the facts about the extensive nature of pupil and
faculty segregation in the Denver schools, 1 shall argue as
my first argument that if we draw only on the findings and
conclusions of the district judge, which were affirmed on
appeal, the findings, if you please, of de jure segregation,

5
the terra that the courts below use, that Denver has in fact
pattern, practice, and policy of racial segregation in the
schools which has affected a large and significant part of the
school system, not just a few schools, not just an isolated
or de minimis discrimination but a general pattern.
I will argue that because the violations found
below were systemwide, the remedy should have been aimed at
all of the segregated schools.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE; BURGER;

Mr. Nabrit, before you

proceed further, I overlooked announcing that Mr. Justice
Thurgood Marshall

is unavoidably absent this morning

attending a family funeral, and‘he reserves the right to
participate in the case on the basis of all the records and
arguments that are recorded.
MR. NABRIT:

My second argument will be that the

facts found below require a Conclusion that illegal segregation was considerably more widespread in the system than the
courts below held.

In that portion of the argument I will

concentrate on the Manual School as a case study to discuss
the questions about the burden of proof, what constitutes
a prima facie discrimination, and the like.

And also becuase

of the really social importance of Manual High School as the
keystone of the segregated system, sitting atop a theatre
pattern involving all the poor elementary schools, 11
elementary schools with 3fS00 Black pupils in 1968 feeding

6

into this segregated high school.
Q

Doss the record in this case show the

coinocsifeion of the school hoard?
MR. NABRITs

Was it biracial?

The school board during the relevant

years had one black member, Mrs. Noel, and she was the
member who initiated the three desegregation resolutions is
1968.

MR. NABTRIT;

the school district.
When the case began, the separation of Blacks and
Whites in the system really was very intense.

Although only

7
14 percent of the 96,COD pupils were Black, the vast
majority were concentrated in a few schools.

Mr. Greiner is

pointing at a 1968 elementary school zone map in which we
have shaded in dark blue the zones of-ten elementary schools;
with from zero to nine percent white populations.
Q

Hr. TCabrit, give me again the figure on the

overall balance picture, the overall composition of the
entire area as to Kexican-Amaricans-MR. N&BRIT:

Fourteen percent Negro, 20 percent

Hispano, and 65 percent Anglo.

At the bottom of page seven

in our brief you will see the detailed statistics,
Mr. Chief Justice.
In these ten schools shaded in blue we find twothirds of the Black elementary pupils, more than 5,500 of
them, going to school with only 150 Whits pupils, less than
one-half of one percent.

Another 15 porcent of the Black

pupils attend the other seven schools outlined in green on
the map, which are from 10 to 19 percent Anglo, and most of
those schools toward the west, a majority Hispano.

So,*the

form segregation takes is either all Blacks, it is either
Blacks separated from Whites by being an all-Black school or
Blacks being separated from Whites by being in schools with
Hispano.

And the secondary schools had, at the outset of the

lawsuit, a similar racial concentration; four-fifths of the
Blacks at three junior high - schools with four percent of the

8

Anglos, 91 percent of the Blacks at two high schools,
Manual and East, and the other 200 Black high school pupils
spread out in seven schools with 13,000 whites.
As to faculty concentration and segregation,
Judge Boyle found that this was part of the pattern.

He

found that the tendency to concentrate minority teachers in
minority schools helped, in his."words, seal off these schools
as permanent segregated schools.

And he found that the

reason for the concentration of Blacks and Hispanos in
minority schools was, and 1 emote, "because of concern over
a possible lack of acceptance by the TJhite community and
because of a feel of lack of support by soma faculties and
principals."

So, for as many as ten years after Brown, all

the Black and Hispano teachers in the system were assigned
only to the schools where Black pupils were concentrated.
And the figures on the faculty concentration patterns, set
out in detail on pages 12 and 13 of our brief, note
particularly
Hispano

the

teachers.

overall small proportion of Black and
The Black teachers were only seven

percent and the Hispanos onlv two percent in 19fR.

of course,

in the earlier years there were many fewer such teachers.
So, when you see a school with 5ft percent Black facul.tv in a
system with only seven percent Black teachers, you can see
what is gcii'iy on.
And I might say at this point, it seems to me that

o
the Tenth Circuit's reversal of Judge Doyle's faculty
desegregation injunction most clearly departs from this
Court's holdings in Swann and the other cases.

The Tenth

Circuit held that this admitted pattern of racial faculty
assignments was justifiable, because when thav began it,
the former superintendent Obarholtzer said that, they wanted
•role-models for Black pupils in the Black schools, but. that
of course had nothing to do with Judge Doyle’s finding that
they were excluding Black faculty from the >?hita school.
To begin mv first argument, as I said, for the
purposes of the Court's argument we accept as correct the
ruling of both courts below on the facts and the law about
school segregation in Denver.

The courts below found

segregation illegal only when the plaintiffs were able to
prove that the school board's explanation and justification
for segregatory acts were "a sham and a subterfuge
concealing odious intent.’’

This was the high standard, the

difficult burden, that the Tenth Circuit said plaintiffs bae­
to meet.

And even with this excessively strict burden,

plaintiffs had to satisfy both courts below that the Denver
system deliberately segregated eight schools attended by 37
percent of all the Black pupils in the school system.
Cur brief at pages 17 and IS breaks down those
figures in detail, identifies the schools and the percentages.
The eight schools found deliberately segregated, below enroll

10

a fourth of the Black elementary children, 00 percent of the
Black junior high school children, and 45 percent of the Black
senior high school children.

And our argument is that

properly analysed, the holdings below show that Denver did
have a pattern and practice of systematic discrimination
which justified relief at all the segregated schools.
Judge Doyle found in general that the Denver
School Board had a ten-year segregation policy, and he said
this several different places in his opinion in several
different'ways.

But it is not just a question of numbers

or the percentage of Black pupils in the system affected by
these findings.

It is not just a question of how many

schools that are involved.

It is a question of policies.

And the findings of deliberate implication include policy
decisions about all kinds of questions.

There were such

things as the location of new schools, the place or the
size of schools, the location of additions, the fixing of
attendance boundary lines, use of optional zones, the use of
mobile classrooms, the faculty segregation policy, which
obviously had systemwide implications, and the rescision of
the three integration resolutions in the spring of 1969.
Let me give two examples of how Judge Doyle’s
findings about northeast Denver really implicate more than
just the schools in northesist Denver.
Q

Implicate more than what?

11
MR. NABRIT:

More than just the local schools

involved in the northeast part of town.
One of the findings by Judge Doyle was that the
Board placed 23 mobile classrooms up in the northeast part
of Denver Mr. Greiner is pointing at.

And Judge Doyle found

and the quotations that set out numbers are at•nags 25-—that
the placement of these mobile classrooms was used to heap
Blacks confined in the Black schools and out of the White
schools.
•0

Could you have identified for me what is

referred to as the core city on that map?

Right in the left

part of the blue area.
MR. NABRITs

Manual High School is in the center

there,and the so-called Five Points area referred to in the
opinion is just this side of Manual.
Q

Where is the Park Hill area?

MR. 1SJABRIT:

Barrett School, Steelman School,

Ilallett School, the schools that are so freouently mentioned
in the opinion, are these three, and it was held that the
policy was to prevent Park Fill and

Philips—to keep those

schools majority white, while these schools turned Black.
0

What is the significance of the difference

between blue and green shaded areas?
MR. NABRIT:
percent White.

Under in percent Anglo and 10 to 20

All these schools are.

12
At the same time these mobile units were placed- in
these Park Hill area schools, the northeast Denver schools f
in the southwest part of the city a new neighborhood was
annexed into the school system which later became the
trailer area, which had 700 children and no school down there,
And so instead of building mobile units at the two nearby
schools,

Sabin

and. Beallf the Board instituted

policy

of busing these Anglo children ten miles across to the
southwest part of the city to University Park, Asbury, and
Cory.
And another example is the Montbello area, a newly
developed area out beyond the airport in the northwest
corner=

And that area had no junior high school.

Those

pupils ware bused past the black schools, Smilev and Cory,
all the way to the west part of town over at Lake Junior
High School.
1 did not really finish the trailor example.

When

trailer school was opened,and freeing 700 spaces .in the
southeast area, even though the Board said it had a policy
of using transportation to promote integration, it did not
use those spaces to relieve the overcrowding and to remove
the mobile units? that is what part of the rescision
controversy was about.

Simply removing mobile units to

reassign children in overcrowded Black schools to other
neighborhoods.

13

Q

How many students in the entire area are in

so-called mobile or part of schools which are temporary
that you know of?
MR. NABRIT:

The finding was that there were 28

mobile units in all of northeast Denver and at an average of
30 pupils a classroom, 1 suppose, something like that, maybe
a little less than 30.
Q

That would fluctuate quite rapidly, would it

not?
MR. NABRIT:

Yes, yes.

In the neighborhood of 300

or perhaps more.
We think that proving a policy and pattern of
illegal segregation,and it is obviously not practical in a
brief oral argument, to really get into all the evidence of
a trial that took more than 20 days, but that the findings
do probably show such a policy.

In other race discrimination

fields, most notably involving exclusion of Blacks from jurv
service, the courts regard a prima facie case as proved when
there is shown to be a general pattern of exclusion and that
there has been an opportunity to discriminate.

And

Alexander against Louisiana last term exemplifies that type
of approach.

And we think that something, not identical but

some sort of simpler approach to the development of a prima
facie case, is obviously necessary in this field.
The Fifth Circuit's recent decisions and bank

14
decisions in the Austin, Texas and Corpus Christi case
reject this idea which is advanced by the brief of the United
States and the briefs of the school board in this case that
it is necessary to prove segregation by proving a
discriminatory act at every single school in a system.

The

Fifth Circuit points out that such a rule has never been
argued by the Government before in the whole hirtory of
school cases.

It was not long ago that the United States

was pioneering statewide school desegregation cases against
Alabama and Georgia, and this new notion that you have to
prove school by school is a 'plain reversal of what Judge
Wisdom said was the tried and true method of proving school
segregation, namely, proving pattern.
The proponents of the school-by-school approach
must know that they are demanding the impossible, that such
a rule would virtually immunize most school segregation from
challenge.

I mean, school boards do not keep records vary

long on these issues.

And in this case there were not even

any maps of attendance zones in Denver prior to 1960, and
they had to be reconstructed by very laborious and pains­
taking process, and basic figures, statistics, about the
racial composition of schools, that sort of thing, were not
available for many relevant years.
Our second argument is that the pattern of
segregation was even wider than the courts below actually

:.:v

held because of some of the legal rulings.

We think that the

evidence shows that Manual High School, Manual Training
High School,» was in the classic pattern of, to use the words
of Swann, a school that was established for one race, set up
for minority group pupils and planned as such.
In that point in our brief, the Solicitor General
supports our contention that New Manual was established as
a minority school with explicit racial considerations.

The

little booklet which is excerpted in the record, published
by the school board when Manual was being planned,
Plaintiffs’ Exhibit 356, makes it obvious that Manual really
was planned for Black and Hispano students, as does the
testimony by the then superintendent, Mr. Oberholtzer.
The booklet said in essence that Manual School was going to
be different--hac3: in the early 19508s before Brown
was planned—Manual was going to be different, the people
were building a school to replace an older building.
had special problems.

They

They were designing a-—they had a long

history of the racial composition in the school, how it had
gradually changed from White to a majority Black and Hispane
and that—so that because of Manual's different population,
they were planning a different curriculum there.
Judge Doyle condemned a similar planning of a
school at Barrett after Brown, for some reason he focused on
the fact that Manual was planned before Brown as a minority

16
school, and we think that is the wrong point-

That even

though what the school board was doing did not violate the
law of the land back before Brown, they nevertheless were
engaging in explicitly racial considerations, and that Brown
applies just as much here as it does in states which had
segregation laws.
There really is not time to go into the evidence
about Manual about the subsequent boundary changes-

But ir­

is sufficient to say that Judge Doyle never found that there
boundary changes were justified or had any real basis as he
did about some other boundary changes, but only that he
applied some sort of a notion about the burden of proof,
which we think and argue in more detail in our brief miscast
the burden of proofA point not made very clearly in the brief is the

integral relationship of Manual atop a feeder pattern of
11 elementary schools in the core area, plus Cole Junior
High School, which feed pupils into Manual-

Segregating

Manual, establishing it as a Black school atop all these
schools feeding into it obviously is going to have an
influence on those other schools.

A white person living in

one of these feeder schools who wanted to avoid for his
child this school which the board had set up as the minority
high school is obviously induced to move out of the feeder
school area-

If you are interested in what the percentages

17
are, if you add Manual and its feeder pattern to the' northeast
Denver schools, then you really do have 74 percent of the
Blacks in the school system involved in illegal segregation»
Q

Are the feeder schools all over the city?

MR. N&BRIT:

The feeder schools for r.rral are

Mitchell, Gilpin, Swansea, Harrington, Columbine, Ebert,
Whittier, Crofton, Eleria, Garden Place, and Uyafct.
I

would like to conclude by re-emphasising the

passage in Swann which points out that school authorities*
decisions about construction, location, site of school, and
what kind of policy of pupil assignment there will he, will
determine the racial composition of the student body in each
school in the system.

It is the school board’s decisions

that determine the racial composition.

They define the

neighborhoods for~™the neighborhood school policy.
constantly redefine what the neighborhoods are.

They

So that at

the very least, our submission is, where a school district
is found to be engaged in using shams and subterfuges, the
burden shifts to the board to show that schools which look
in every respect like the schools they have found to be
illegally segregated except that they have some rational
explanation, are justified by some compelling interest of
the state and that the state's interests could not have been
served by less segregatory results.
Denver had integration alternatives at every step

18
and always rejected them and chose segregation.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. ftabrit.

Mr. Greiner.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GORDON G. GREINER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. GREINER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
My argument will consider the issue of Denver's
provision of inferior schools and schooling for minority
children who are Black or Hispano, and the provisions of
superior schools and schooling for Anglo children, as
constituting a denial of equal protection under the 14th
Amendment.
That was the finding and holding of the trial court
below in this case, after considering comparative evidence
of tangible educational inputs and outputs, as well as
evidence of the perceptions of principals, teachers,-pupils,
and the community in and about the schools.
Mr. Habrifc has already covered many of the policies
and practices of the respondents which created and contributed
to the racially identifiable isolated status of these
schools.

The segregated condition which resulted from those

actions is also relevant to the question of education
inequality.

But I will consider here only other practices

and policies which also contributed to the inferior status

of the school:-, as educational institutions.
Q

I understand that your argument would stand

independently of any evidence of de jure segregation.
MR. GREINER;

That is correct, Your Honor.

We are

not at all dependent upon the finding of any quality as heir.;
premised on Brown*s equation of de jure segregation—
Q

And by cie jure 1, of course, include action by

the school board.
MR. GREINER;

Certainly, certainly.

But that is

right.

Q

Your argument is craite apart from any evidence

of that.
MR. GREINER;

The argument stands alone: that is

correct.

Q

Are you suggesting by that argument that

perhaps there was a non-compliance;with Plessy v. Ferguson
independent of Brown?
MR. GREINER;
that is right.

Quite true, Mr. Chief Justice,

And I -would like—part of my argument will

present some of the types of disparities in the allocations
of resources to these schools which we believely clearly
violates every holding of this Court since Plessy.
I would also like to cover the second point of my
argument, the contention that any coeducation for minorities
in racially identifiable inferior schools denies equal

2n
protection*

And, finally, that the trial court formulated

a remedy for these unequal and disparate conditions which
met the standards of thoroughness, efficiency, fairness, and
rapidity, while focusing only upon those characteristics of
the system which he felt led to the violation as he perceived
it*
With regard to the schools in question, the
minority schools are shown on the map*

There are 27 of them

to which some 20,000 minority children are assigned.

Each

of these schools has annual enrollments of from 29 to only
1 percent.

The red dots on the map represent those with an

Hispano enrollment or a Black enrollment in excess of 70
percent.
0

Let me have that again.

MR. GREINER:

Which colors?

The red dots are schools 'that have

either 70 percent. Black or 70 percent Ilispeino*

The blue dots

are some additional schools which we feel should also be
covered by the findings of violation, and are equally
entitled to the remedy, whose racial composition shows a
combined 70 percent or more. Negro-Hispano enrollment.
These schools have over 40 percent of the Hispano
students in Denver and over 86 percent of the district's
Negro students, but only 5 percent of the districtis Anglo
students.

There are 22 elementary schools, four junior hiqh

schools, and Manual Training High School involved here.

21
Considering what these schools were like, Mr. Nafrr.it
has described how the administration refused to transport
Anglos into these schools and how they refused to reassign
minority children out of them.

I would like to tell you a

little bit about what the record and findings below tell us
about the conditions of these schools.
The minority student in Denver found himself
assigned to a school which had twice as many brand new
teachers, twice as many probationary teachers, and onlv half
as many teachers with ten or more years experience as
compared with the predominantly Anglo schools in the district.
This was the result of the administration's own policies
regarding the assignment of new teachers in the district as
well as the Board’s policies regarding teacher transfers
whereby teachers were accorded preference based upon
seniority so that as soon as a teacher had some seniority in
a school, she would then be first in line eligible for
transfer out.
Q

Is this in the employment contract of the

teachers?
MR. GREINER:
0

Yes.

Is that a result of collective bargaining?

MR. GREINER:

Prior to 1966, the contract provided

that teachers assigned to a school, new teachers, had to
remain in the school for at least their three-year

22

probationary period.

After 1966, the district even

abandoned that requirement, and we contend that that even
further contributed—
Q

1 know, but was this a result of collective

bargaining?
MR. GREINER:
Q

Yes, it was.

That gave transfer options to the more

senior teachers.
MR. GREINER:
absolute right.

That is true, but it was not an

The Board retained the power to both

initiate and disapprove of transfer requests under the
standard of whatever they felt was best for the interests
of the school district.

However, the evidence here shows

that the Board and the school administration never exercised
that power toward the goal of either stabilising the
teaching staffs in these schools or raising the level of
teacher experience in them.
C>

Could the school board refuse to transfer for

any reason?
MR. GREINER:

If in their judgment it was not in

the best interests of the district; that was the standard.
Q

Then the union contract provision did not mean

very much; is that your argument?
MR. GREINER:

Even if it met something, certainly

there was sufficient power reserved to the school admi ni s tr a t i on

23
to take some kinds of affirmative action to remedy the
situation that existed in these minority schools, both v/ith
regard to trying to improve the level of experience there
as wall as trying to reduce the rate of turnover there„
Judge Doyle, in considering the turnover rate in
these minority schools, found that it was so high that it was
actually disruptive of the educational process going on in
those schools.

And he also found that this constant flight

of teachers out of these schools contributed to the aura of
inferiority which surrounded the school and reinforced the
student's perceptions that somehow his school was a place of
less choice.,
With regard to achievement data, the administration
refused to disclosed comparative by-school achievement data
for over 20 years.

It failed not only to disclose it to the

community but even refused to disclose it to members of the
board of education as well.

While the predominantly Anglo

schools were achieving on the basis of national averages at
or above the 60th percentile in general, the minority schools
were only achieving at around the 20tn percentile.

The

administration nevertheless praised the high achievement in
the Anglo schools and the low achievement in the minority
schools in exactly the same glowing terms.

We recorded some

instances of this in our brief.
This unearned praise by the school administration

24
both obfuscated the disparity in minority achievement

and,

we maintain, also created and reinforced teachers’
acceptance of low achievement as not only the inevitable but
appropriate result of these minority schools.
The evidence shows that the administration set
uniformly low expectancy standards with regard to achievement
in these minority schools.

In our brief at pages 50 and. 51

in footnote 57, we show 14 of the schools, all with
established expected achievement levels set at a uniform 23
percentile.

At the same time, the school district was

setting expectancy at about the 50 to 70 percentile range in
the predominantly Anglo schools.
Because they had been conditioned by the
administration's expectancy standards, the minority student
found that his teachers did not expect very much of him, that
he was neither challenged nor motivated to do better? although
he did not do very well, he always seamed to be passed from
grade to grade.
Q

I suppose the expectancy was based on

experience in those schools, right?
MR, GREINERs

No.

The expectancy, according to the

school district, was based upon a calculation of, I believe
the term was, the inner guartile distribution of xo scores
for the particular class at that particular school.

Q

Not on the experience of previous years

25
MR. GREINER:

Not on the actual experience in the

schools, that is correct.
I would like to go on to our second point
concerning the law which we believe should apply to this
case.

While trial court did not find it necessary to hold

either that the segregation of these schools or their
educational inequalities were the product of racial
prejudice or odious intent, he nevertheless recognised them
to be the direct effect of state action, and held that its
effect discriminated against Blacks and Hispanos by
denying them an equal opportunity for an

education.

Thus, our case is very similar to such longstanding precedents as Sweatt v. Painter when the Court was
determining whether white and black facilities were
substantially equal under the old Flessy doctrine.

The

factors considered by this Court included the reputation of
the school, the overall quality of the institution as to
faculty and facilities.

And even as recenfclv as this Court's

decision in Swarm, the Court pointed as a substantive
constitutional violation of eoual protection to disparities
where schools do not have like qualities, facilities, or
staffs.

This, we maintain, is exactly the kind of case

found and proved below.
I would like

now to pass on to the question of the

appropriateness of the remedy which was finally put together

26
by Judge Doyle after a separate four-day hearing on relief.
I would like to .remind the Court that historically since
Brown II, the Court has looked to and relied upon the trial
court's exercise of discretion in fashioning appropriate
remedies in school cases and has consistently resisted
efforts to limit the tools available to the trial court in
fo : rulating an effective remedy.
In this case. Judge Doyle was faced with the
practical problem of

curing

a multitude of inecraalities of

input, environment, and output as thoroughly, efficiently,
and promptly as possible.

Here he did not take any

doctrinaire approach but carefully put together a varied
remedy based on the realities of the characterists and the
violations as he perceived them.

This broad choice of

remedy was made after a special four-day hearing in May
where, in the court's words, the crucial factual issue
considered is whether compensatory education in a segregated
setting is capable of bringing about the necessary
equalizing effect or whether desegregation and integration
are essential to improving the schools in question and
providing equality.
This was not, as applied by the Solicitor General's
brief, a decision made in a vacuum; because the trial court
had before it a, detailed plan of the board of education,
submitted under Resolution 1565, which was premised on the

27
very same types of special and compensatory programs in the
segregated schools which the United States contends here
would have been an acceptable alternate remedy.

But the

evidence presented at this hearing oh relief established that
minority achievement is improved in an integrate:,
heterogeneous environment, that attitudinal disparities and
disadvantages, such as teacher expectancy, teacher dislike
for the segregated school, and so forth, are only corrected
through a combined program of integration, desegregation, and
then a compensatory program in the integrated environment.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, Mr. Greiner.

Mr. Ris.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM K. RIS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. RIS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I have listened with interest with respect to some
of the facts that have been related to the Court and would
direct the Court’s attention to the basic fallacy that some
of the facts related extend many years back, prior to the
trial of this case or the conditions that existed as of the
time of the -trial.

Both Mr. Wabrit and Mr. Greiner have

related facts that

would indicate on the face that we have

a static situation and had a static situation for a

28

considerable period of time* when that is not the case
whatsoever with respect to the Denver background.

And this

will necessitate going into some additional facts and figures
with respect to Denver itself and the school district.
Denver is a home-rule city under the Colorado
Constitution.
around it.

It has the basic area, there are many suburbs

But Denver itself at the time of the trial

consisted of an area of about 100 scroare miles.

That had

increased roughly 40 percent after World War II fov reason of
annexations to the city from the surrounding area.

Under tr.

Colorado Constitution, the school district for the City and
County of Denver had exactly the same boundaries as the City
and County itself.

And, until very recently, the school

board had absolutely no say-so as to what areas would be
brought into the school district.

If the City and County

of Denver wanted to annex, it came in whether the school
district wanted it or not.

Very recently that has been

changed, but the change is so recant as not to be
contributory.
The school board itself? as has been indicated, is
an elective body, seven members? it has been for some period
of time.

The general area of Denver, with the recent

annexations, is shown on this exhibit.

As indicated on the

other exhibit, this was the so-called core city area,

the

business district being downtown and the so-called Five Points

29
area being to the north and east of that, area of the downtown
area.
Prior to World War XI, it is true that the Black
population was well concentrated in the Five Points area.
After World War II, a completely different situation
existed and expanded, ana this requires again some population
figures»

In 1940, the population of Denver was 322,000»

1970 at the time of the trial, it was 515*000, or

in

increase

of 40 percent.
In comparison to this increase of 40 percent, the
Black population in 1940 was 7,300»

It increased, it just

doubled, in the ten years between 1940 and 1950, and the
great bulk of this increase was after World War II, so that
as of the 1350 census, the Black population was 15,000, an
increase of 100 percent.
Q

Would the school population correlate pretty

wail with the. total population?
MR. RIS:

Wo, sir, the school population went up

during the same period, Mr. Justice Potter, because of the
basic increase in post-War babies with which we are all
familiar.

So, the school population between 1940 and 1970

has just about doubled, whereas the city population-Q

Went up by 40 percent.

MR. P.ISs

Forty percent, yes, sir.

a whale of a difference.

So, that made

Then the Black population itself

30
doubled again between 1950 and 1960, another 15,000, from
fifteen to thirty thousand? and another 17,000 between I960
and 1970.

So that between 1940 and 1970 when the city

population was increasing 40 percent, the Black population
increased over 600 percent.
The Hispano population, we do not have
comparable figures, because the 1940 census and the 1950
census did not separately count and tabulate the Hispanos
as a group.

They were merely listed under Anglo.

So, all

we have insofar as census figures are concerned, in 1960
there were 60,000 in the city and in 1970 86,000.

So,

numerically they were greater than the Blacks but not
increasing in the 3arae proportions and progression.
C>

Were Hispanos identified only by their

names?
MR. R1S:

Spanish surname is probably the best way

of identification, and I think that is still true.
Q

Is that the way they have been identified in

this case?
MR. RIS:

Insofar as the school district figures

are concerned in this case, they were identified in this
one fashion.

Shortly after school opened in the fall, a

call would go out to the principals to report back Anglos,
Negroes, Hispanos, and Orientals.

The principal would ask

the teachers, "Just give me a count of what you think is in

your room," and then that would be assembled by a school and
transmitted in»

It is a rather nebulous type of thing,

because we have Hispanos obviously ethnic who have names
Smith or Brown, and we also have non-Hispanos who ar® named—
Q

Rodrigues,

MR. RISs

Right# exactly.

So, it is rough, but

the school district during the years that it did ksap this
type of census followed just that pattern.
So far as the 1?» S. census, I cannot answer.

I jus

do not know.
As a result of this influx# though—and this is
where we get into a very flexible type of situation--this
is City Park, this square.

It is about a mile square.

Manual High is right here,

Cole Junior High jurat to the

north of Manual.

This is the so-called Five Points area.

And until after World War II, the Black population was quite
well restricted.

There were seme exceptions, of course.

With the large number of people coining in—and also I think
that there is one thing that had a great influence on this,
and that was the Colorado Supreme Court decision which just
plain said in

1957 that private racial covenants and deeds

were void and not enforceable? it even went further than this
Court in holding that be void at that time.
So, beginning in -the late, forties when the
population influx began, York Street, which is just on the

32

east edge of City Park, as of 1950--and this is again
roughly but as best as we can depict it—became the easterly
boundary for the Black population.

Between 1950 and I960,

it extended from west to east and again to the north of
City Park, so that what previously was basically a White
residential area became the reverse.

And in that particular

area, for example, in 1940 there were only 86 Black citizens
in that particular area»

In 1950 it was 098.

But it jumped

in the next ten years to 1960 to 8,700, just to the north
of the Park.
to 10,500»

And in 1970 at the time of trial, it was up
So that by 1960 the Black population had

generally moved and acquired substantial property in this

Wow we coma into the Park Hill area which you get
to the east and extends from Colorado Boulevard, which is
the main north-south thoroughfare, a six-lane main highway,
and extends on out to the airport..

Those of you who have

been to the airport, as yon come in, you come right down
32nd Avenue Parkway right through that area»

It was a typical

middle class Whit© neighborhood, single-family dwellings,
except for Monaco Parkway which had more expansive and upper
middle class neighborhoods»

And then after 1960, the

movement went forward so that the 1960 census showed in the
Park Hill area there were only about 500 Black citizens.
1966, a private census taken by one of the plaintiffs'

In

33

experts, showed that there were 12,00.0 in the Park Fill area?
12,000 Blacks had moved in,,

And by 1970, the time of the

trial, the census—wa did not have the census at that time
but it has been determined since and it is in our brief—
was 18,500.
So, we have a school board at this time with a
school district which had neighborhood school subdistricts
for

all of the elementary, junior high and high schools

set up.

And these schools in the Park Hill area, for

example, and in the area directly north of City Park, the
boundaries were established.

But, as the Black population

moved in, another thing occurred.
par family.

There were more children

The families were about 25 percent larger, and

in some instances families were doubling up in a single
residential unit, so that there became a very tight situation
and overcrowding in this area.

And that led to an area

directly north of City Park where something had to be done,
and it was at that point that Barrett School was built, and
it was planned at a time whan there ware no figures as to
exactly what the population was by race or ethnic origin
in this area.

But, nevertheless, they went ahead, as Judge

Doyle found, knowing that it was in a transition stage, and
ultimately it became—I think it opened 70 parcent Negro
and very shortly was nearly 100 percent, not guite.
is the history of Barrett.

And that

34
At the 'saroe time, they had another situation over
in southwest Denver, and they built a school over here at
exactly the same time to take care of the overcrowding in
this overcrowded area, the same size, the same plan and all»
But, nevertheless, this was following the neighborhood
school pattern that always existed.

And, yes, there were new

boundaries set up for Barrett, but that was merely to out
out from the other surrounding schools that were overcrowded
and to supply a school here.
We got into a big argument in the district court
as to why it did not extend across Colorado Boulevard.

I

will not go into all the details on that, but the principal
one being that—two things.
which we

One, the traffic hazard itself,

.are all aware of in setting school boundaries.

But the second major thing, from our standpoint, is that
regardless of the way the population actually moved, that
at the time of the trial, ten years after the school opened,
it was all Black anyway.

Bo, it had no causal relationship,

building in that spot, because of the normal neighborhood

This was the Park Hill situation over a period of
ten years and what they tried to do about it.
time, these schools were becoming crowded.
about mobile units,

At the same

You had some talk

h mobile unit is a temporary unit that

is brought in, but it is not merely a trailer.

It is on

foundations with its own plumbing, heating, air conditioning.
So, it is not a second-class facility at all.

The evidence

was that the administration tried to find out from the
parents what did they want.

Did they want the children

bused out or did they want them in mobile units?

In one

school, for example, the parents voted for mobile units,

in

another school they voted for busing out, and that is what
they got in each instance.
But over the same period of time—well, maybe I
had better go back and talk about Manual for just a moment.

record, in the brief.

It is in the

The main problem being that by reason

of large annexations in southwest Denver—mean, in southeast
Denver and southwest Denver, plus this Hontbello area that
was indicated, there was no money for new construction and
they were busing children into other schools.

And so there

was a very substantial number being bused during the same

If X may also reply to one point that Mr. fireiner
made, that they were busing in from Hontbello and past Cole
and so forth over to

Lake? Lake had some facilities, some

capacities, and that is why they were bused over.

The whole

argument in the trial court was what constituted capacity.
The plaintiffs took the position that all you did was take
the number of rooms in a school, multiply it by 30, and that
gave you the capacity, and that was a rule of thumb that the
schools used just in determining, hew much capacity they
had generally.
But as Superintendent Oberholtzer testified—and
he was superintendent for 20 years, 1947 to 1967, and he was
the one who gave the basic history of this period—he said
that the reason they were busing children past some of the
minority schools was because they were trying to reduce the
pupil per room capacity in those schools, and they had extra
teachers, they had paraprofessionals, there was a lower
pupil-teacher ratio, and it was by reason of these special
plans in these minority schools that they had a lower number
of pupils per room, that instead of being given credit for
it, they were being damned for it on a mathematical basis,
in effect.

And that is where we get into some of these

capacity problems.

It has to be looked at in the context in

which these schools were being utilised at that time.

37
Q

Was there any affirmative pairing of White and

Black schools for the purpose of busing from one neighborhood
to another?
MR. RIS:

No, sir, there was not.

The sole reason

for busing was due to overcrowding in some schools? and in
most instances, in the large, large percentage of busing that
was going on was because of no schools in the particular
areas.

There had been a bond issue in 1967, for example,

which had gone down to defeat,

And although during the 20-

year period of Dr. Oberholfczer's tenure they had

spent over

a hundred million dollars in new school construction, that
does not mean only schools but additions and remodeling and
so forth, and they built over a hundred new* schools or
additions to schools, nevertheless, with this rapid increase,
the doubling of the school population in 20 years, they just
could not keep up with it.

And then when they got whipped

on the bond issue, there was nothing to do except keep
busing until there finally were funds available for new
construction.
If I may go back just for a moment to New Manual,
Manual High School was a school in the core area.
always a Black school.

It was not

At one time it had a racial mixture of

Anglos and Hispanos and Negroes and Orientals»

There was a

small percentage of Orientals in that particular part of the
city.

The school was an old one.

And so when it came time to

38
reconsider what was to be done in the early fifties, they
decided that they would try to reconstruct a new school on
the same site.

So, they acquired adjacent land avid ultimately

built a school on the adjacent land and then tore the old
school down.

an aura of a non-academic type of school.

And probably it had
But it was a high

school offering all of the high school curricula, plus these
other vocational courses.
When it came time to construct New Manual, the
school district went overboard on what it was going to do in
trying to build a school that would take care of the needs of
the pupils in that area.

And that is one of the arguments

that is made in the plaintiffs' brief, that the school
district has not done.

But here they were trying to do

exactly that to find out what the particular needs of these
pupils were, what these children needed over the long haul
for their own benefit and considering their own circumstances.
And it is true that it was a low socio-economic area, and not

39

too many of these children went on to college, but they
needed special attention, and this is what the administration
was trying to do.
Q

It was an area high school always ,• was it not?

MR. RIS:
Q

Yes.

I mean, the high schools as well as the

elementary and junior high schools have been neighborhood
schools in Denver.
MR. RIS:

Yes, sir, throughout the city.

This is

true in every area, not merely in the core city area but no
matter where you go.
Q

How many high schools were there?

MR. RIS:

There were originally five, North,East,

South, West and Manual,
Q

And now there are nine.

And of the five, Manual was the only one

which was predominantly non-Anglo?
MR. RIS:

Non-Anglo, ves, sir.

At the time that

Manual was in the planning stage, so they could determine how
big to make it and what kind of facilities to provide,
whether it should provide shops or what type of shops and
so forth, they got out a brochure, they sought suggestions
of the community, had many meetings, and it was a wide-open
discussion with the administration and the Board as to what
they were going to do.

And, as a result of this, they

finally decided on the new school and what it was to offer.

40

As I say., they opened in the same location? the old school
had closed, the new school opened in the same location, same
boundaries.-

And when it opened, as the evidence shows, it

had 41 percent Anglo, 28 percent Black, 24 percent Hispano,
and 8 percent Oriental, which is just a good solid racial
mix.

And so it was not 99 percent Black.

It was not 99

percent Hispano or anything of the sort.

It was the only high school that had a

MR. RIS:

spectrum in its orientation, that was a college preparatory
school?

And those schools too, even though they were

high schools, they were neighborhood schools?
MIL RIS:
Q

Yes, sir»

There was no opportunity for a young man or

woman interested in getting a college preparatory oriented
high school education who lived in the core area and going
to one of these schools, there was no opportunity at all; is
that right?
MR. RIS:

Initially there was not.

Manual offered

a full curriculum for college prep.
0

Yes, I understand that.

MR. RIS;

And then later on and before trial,

after 1964, there was a gradual evolution on transfers.
there was called limited open enrollment in 1966.

First

And then

by 1968 there was a voluntary open enrollment which allowed
any child in any school in which he was a majority to
transfer to a minority school, with transportation provided,
and that has been true since ’68.

But historically that was

not true.
So, basically then the Board constructed to meet
the need, as one Board member testi£ied--two of them, as a
matter of fact.

We had a need in this neighborhood and we

built a school in the neighborhood and just followed the same
neighborhood pattern in the others in Manual and went ahead

42

and did what seemed the best thing for the kids in that
community and without modifying the neighborhood school
pattern.
The three resolution bit, if I may get onto that
particular point, as a result of the influx into the Park
Hill area, these grade schools were fast becoming imbaiansee
Black, not question about it.

So, we had Barrett,

the .

school that was constructed, Sfcadman, and Hallett.
those three fed into Smiley Junior High.

Then

At no time sea a

there any change of boundaries at Smiley Junior High, even
though it became Black by reason of the population moving in.
But as a result of this impact of the Blacks moving into the
Park Hill area, there was a concern and the Board took
cognisance of it.

Mrs. Rachel Noel, a Black member of the

Board and a vary competent woman, v/as the main focus on this;
and, as a result of various resolutions, they finally got
to the point where the superintendent was asked to prepare a
plan to attempt to control the racial imbalance in Park Hill.
And that is where we get into the three resolutions.
of the various schools, it related to only four
predominantly Black schools, Barrett, Stedman, Hallett, and.
Smiley Junior High.

And as a result of these schools, there

would be a change of boundaries within the subdistricts so
that they would no longer be completely contiguous around
the school, and they would be moved out to some of the

predominantly Anglo schools* and some of those children
moved in by similar changes
and their feeder* Smiley.

as to Barrett and Steelman
As to Hallett* they went into a

different plan, and they tried to go into a voluntary plan
whereby children particularly from the southeast would be
induced to transfer into Hallett voluntarily and Hallett
children out.

So* basically, insofar as mandatory really

was concerned* it applied only to the three schools.

And

than there were some compensatory education features tied
into that.
Q

That transportation you just alluded to would

be something less than ten miles* 1 would assume?
MR. RIS:

Yes* sir.

These resolutions were adopted during the spring
of the year* January to April, roughly.
board election in May.
June.

There was a school

-The new members took office in

So* instead of a four-three majority one way on

mandatory busing of these children out from these three
schools, there was a four-three the other way? and they
rescinded the resolution as.to the mandatory busing out*
substituted a voluntary plan to correct this imbalance or
attempt to correct it* and retained the other features of
the plan.

And* as the superintendent testified* he said

this is merely the beginning, this is merely the first step
in a test to see what we could do on this imbalance in the

44
area and also, secondly and just as important, to see
whether busing out and changing schools would affect the
achievement of these pupils, because he said he was not
convinced and the state of educational social science,
nobody had any empirical evidence to say whether it would or
would note

And so this was his first step to try to see

what could be done in this regard.

And so it was not an

absolute thing? it was merely one step in the developing
educational program which he had recommended to the Board.
And when they took the mandatory part out o£ it and
substituted busing, it did not change anything except that
one phase of it.

And also

what is most important is that

not a child had been bused up to this point, nobody had been
moved out and so they were being moved back, and there was
nothing that had been done except some preliminary planning
to implement the superintendent’s recommendations before
the rescission was made.
So, it is not the type of situation whereby
children were in one school and being moved back into a
minority school and by reason of their race.
As t.o the inputs and outputs, let me comment on
that briefly.
Q

By input you mean expenditure and by output

you are talking about performance?
MR. RISt

Results, yes, sir.

Before I get onto

45
that, X am jumping a little too fast here.

Insofar as the

entire school system is concerned, Judge Doyle, the
district judge, made one finding that just stands out head
and shoulders above everything else in the record? and he
stated, quote, "It is to be emphasized here that the Board
has not refused to admit any student at any time becave

of

racial or ethnic origin," and this remark was being made ao
to the entire district,
Q

Where v;ere you reading from?

MR. RXSr
Your Honor.
Q

I was just reading from my notes here,

But—
Do not take the time now.

MR. RIS:

It is on page 67A. of the Appendix to the

petition proceeding at the very bottom.
He goes on and says;

"It should be emphasized here

the Board has not refused to admit any student at any time
because of racial or ethnic origin.

It simply requires

everyone to go to a neighborhood school unless it is
necessary to bus him to relieve overcrowding."

And that was

the fasio fact-finding insofar as de jure segregation is
concerned and the allegations that they made.

The court

found that insofar as the traditional, classic type of de
jure segregation, the dual system, that just did not apply
to the Denver area.
The court also referred to a couple of small

46

boundary changes at Smith and Hallett a block wide and eight
blocks long, for example, in 1962 and 1964, in which we merely
referred to those as being some evidence of intent going to
the rescission of the three resolutions in 1969.
When it came to the Court of Appeals, the Court of
Appeals never ruled on the rescission as being a violation
or non-violation.

The Court of Appeals merely said, "Well,

Barrettwas built where it was, and the boundary changes on
these other two schools constitute a segregatory act."
Again, getting back to the basics as to what
constitutes a constitutional violation, there has to be a
state act and there has to be a causal relationship.

But

the whole history of this after *62 and '64 was that this
whole area became so concentrated with Blacks that there is
absolutely no causal relationship in the record and cannot
be under the facts and figures a3 to that particular item.
0

As I understand what the Court of Appeals did,

as you just said, was not to decide xfhether or not the
rescission was itself a violation.

But, putting that

question to one side, simply said that the original plan
was an effective remedy; is that not what the Court of
Appeals did?
MR. R1S:

I am sorry, I did not follow you in the

last part, Your Honor.
Q

The Court of Appeals did not pass

and did not

47
decide on whether or not the rescission was by itself a
constitutional violation.

Why did the Court ol: Appeals feel

that they did not have to pass on that?
MR. RIB:

They said, "Well, we find that there i-

already a violation by reason of the boundary changes hare,
for example, and the construction of Barrett."

But they

neglected to—

And approved the district court’s remedy in

that area.
MR. RIS:
Q

Yes, sir, they did.

That is what I thought.

MR. RIS:

But for a different reason, and I

apologise for misnaming you before, Your Honor.
*

Q

In effect, they said that even though the

repeal of the rescission resolution might not be an act of
segregation by itself by reason of the previous situation,
the situation demanded a remedy and the remedy that the
district court adopted saying go forward with the resolution
before rescission was an appropriate remedy.
MR. RISr,

Yes, sir, they used, the same remedy but

constitutional violation, yes, sir.
Throughout, the whole discussion on this when we
were talking about Manual, talking about these little
boundary changes and so forth, our principal complaint about

48
the court's findings and the plaintiffs’ position is that
tie causal relationship is still absent in the .•.-••ni ler..t- aad
therefore as to the first cause of action, as ?;e pointed out,
there was insufficient evidence to find a constitutional'
violation there.
As to the second cause, we get into the'neighborhood
school situation and the equality of educational opportunity.
The counsel says they are relying solely on Plessy her

What is equality of equal education?

is equal justice?

What

A person is entitled to counsel in a

court when he is charged with a crime.

As this Court has

ruled, if he appeals and has not the funds, he is entitled
to the transcript.

So, insofar as providing resources are

concerned, that is something the courts have taken cognizance
of.

So far as guaranteeing results, that is something else

again.

And when we are talking about equality of educational

opportunity, too often those two things are confused.

And

if P-1 easy is what they are relying on, what do we have here?
In a typical Plessy situation you have unequal allocation of
buildings, of equipment, of supplies, of transportation, of
teachers, and so forth.

What were the findings here?

At the trial there was a great attempt to show
that the buildings were inadequate in the core city schools.

They only had 1.3 as compared to

That is not the exact figures but that is comparable
The trial court found in

favor of the defendants

that particular issue on the buildings, and the court held
that by reason of the evidence that there were new additions
to the older buildings,, that they were remodeled and they
had adequate modern lighting, modern seating and so forth,
that there was no unreasonable allocation there.

There was

no evidence of any inadequacy in any of the equipment or
in any of the supplies.

There was no discrimination in

transportation .of the people who had to be transported.
They were all transported in the same buses.

There was no

discrimination in the extra-curricular activities, in the
sports program, insofar as the allocation of monies was
concerned,

The only evidence was that these schools were

allocated a greater amount than the other schools,

'f’his

included not federal funds and state funds, but they did
have a" greater allocation of money,
Q

When you say "they," you mean the schools—

MR. R1S:

I mean the core city schools, yes, sir.

The schools with the lowest achievement results.

So that

basically the only thing that the trial court carae up with at
all was a matter of teachers, teacher experience.
Every teacher in Colorado has to be a college
graduate, have a degree, be licensed by the state, and even

is. what the trial court, used all the way through, 'various
indicia of inferiority, some of which were resources
complained of by the plaintiffs and others were the
achievement results, for example, and the

dropout rale.

That has to be kept in mind, that some are causes potentially
and some are effects.

But the teachers war the only thing

that the district court even alluded to as an indicium of
inferiority in the schools,

And the Court cf Appeals held

that that was not such a substantial factor as to constitute
an unequal resource being furnished.

And even the evidence

itself does not. support that.
Dr. Coleman, for example, stated that the
experience of teachers was far overrated.

MR. RIS:

On that?

No, sir, there is not a

evidence.

MR. RIG:

He found inferiority—

MR. RIS:

--in totality..

But the only thing that

he referred to specifically, insofar as allocation of
resources, was the younger teachers, less experienced

And beyond that there was talk about dropout

rates, lower achievement scores and so forth.
On achievement scores, of course, as the Attorney
General’s brief points out, he took the achievement scores,
he took the fact of racial imbalance, and put the two

Q

Mr. Ri-s, did he not also suggest, am 1 wrong,

MR. SI'S;

They found expressly, Justice Brennan,

that it was not a substantial factor and not a really

Q

As I recall, one cf the pundits, expert

witnesses, said that the age of buildings has relatively
little, if anything, to do with performance of students? is
that right?
MR. RIS:

I think that is correct.

I am trying to

think of which one it was—Dr. Coleman again, counsel tells
me.

Insofar as the other factors on relationship, the

plaintiffs relied on various experts, Dr. Dan Dodson who
was the only expert to testify at the hearing on the merits,

then at the hearing on the remedies, Dr. Coleman ,
Dr. O'Reilly, and Dr. Sullivan were called-in, all of whom

country, one originally from Berkeley who has

Massachusetts, another psychologist from new York State
Coax’d of Education, and of course the eminent Dr

nkrrs.n.

Again, insofar as finding a privation between racial
imbalance and educational achievement, the record insofar
as any provable evidence is concerned is just completely
silent.
Dr. Coleman was of the opinion that it was
basically a cultural deprivation in the lower socio-economic
family groups and neighborhoods and that only to the extent
that minorities were found in those particular areas was
there any relationship at all.

But he was looking solely

at the family background and the cultural background of those
children.

And Dr. Dodson went on at great length about

various attitudes of community, of teachers and pupils and
parents and so forth, not with any relationship to the
Denver situation, just generally as a sociologist might do.
And again a complete lack of causal relationship.
Dr. O'Reilly, who was called on rebuttal by the

1

54
plaintiffs in the remedy hearing pointed out that this whole
matter of educational equality is a vary unsettled field,
he said many years of experimentation would be necessary to
slowly and carefully identify and develop a program to try
to remedy this.

It is an educational process.

So, so far

as the corollary schools, we have a finding by the court.,
the trial court, which is not attacked.here, that it is not
a balanced situation, no Brown constitutional violation,
by reason of the evidence concerning the so-called inputs
or the allocation of resources, except of the teachers,
and even the Court of Appeals saw that

there was no Plessy

violation.
So, what do we

'end up with?

We end up with an

educational problem that the educators have no answer for.
The state of the science is not such that a district court
can decree you shall do this, that, and the other thing.

But

it is something, as Dr. O'Reilly said aiid as Dr. Gilberts,
superintendent of schools, says it has to be.worked out over
a period of time; and we suggest to the Court that this is
something that is being done, has to be done, but it is not
a constitutional violation to be remedied.

It is an

educational problem, which must be-handled at the local level,
and it is something that is beyond the competence of the
federal judiciary.
The educators, with all their know-how, are having

55
a hard enough time and certainly it is not something that c&n
be decreed, such as furnishing counsel, furnishing
transcripts, furnishing people facilities of a physical
nature.
So, basically on the one hand, we say there is no
constitutional violation and therefore we have no remedy;
and, even if there were a constitutional violation, it
would be beyond the competence of the courts„

OPAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES M. NABRIT III, ESQ.,
IN
MR. NABRIT;

REBUTTAL

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice? and

may it please the Court:
We see the whole case as a de jure case.

I think

that the relationship between our two arguments is very well
illustrated by this Court's decision in 1965 in the case
called Rogers against Paul.

That was a case to desegregate

an Arkansas school system, where the desegregation was
proceeding at a grade or year level under the deliberate
speed doctrine.

And yet when Black pupils in the high school

grades were able to demonstrate in this Court that they were
unable to get classes and curricula in the Black school that
were offered in the White school, this Court carved out an

56

exception to the deliberate speed doctrine and said under
Drown or under Sweatt v. Painter or under a combination or
a merger of the two theories, that this was a violation of
equal protection which ought to be remedied by integration»
The remedy in the Sweatt case was integration.

The remedy

in the Supial [?] case was integration, hnd it was not just
based on some sort of theory of achievement# that Human
Sweatt might graduate from law school and not be a good
lawyer? the inequality was in the opportunity he had and the
barriers put in front there.
So, we represent the constitutional rights and
plainly there has been a deprivation for the student that
finishes at the top of the class at Manual as well as the
student that does not do well.
We think that for inequality, just as for
segregation, that there should foe no single doctrinaire
remedy for inequality.

The way that seems

most effective, most sure to accomplish equality, is to put
the pupils in school together.

And it was that sort of overall

judgment we think Judge Doyle made.

About the question from the Court about the age of
the buildings r what Judge Doyle said at page-51 in 313
Federal Supplement is, “However, we do not think that the
age of a building and sit® size are in and of themselvessubstantial factors- affecting the educational opportunity
offered at a given school.

However, we do recognize that

teachers, produce generally low-achieving students, the fact

inferiority which surrounds the school."

58
On this question of the rescission, no fancy
constitutional theory is necessary to support Judge Doyle's
conclusion that what this showed in the factual context of
the case and the series of things that had gone on with
relation to these schools was what Judge Doyle said was
both a purpose and an effect to keep Black kids segregated
up there in northeast Denver.
Q

May I ask you a question, at that point?

I

think 1 have had the same view that Justice Stewart
expressed^ that both of the courts below had found that the
segregation in the core area was not the result of do jure
state action.

Let us assume for the moment that this Court

concluded that it were bound by that finding.

Would it be

your position that this Court should then consider or
reconsider whether or not the distinction between de jure
and de facto segregation is now a valid, one?
MR. NABRIT:

Mr. Justice Powell, I would begin my

answer by saying that—I would divide it into two parts.

I

would say first on the state action question, we agree
entirely with the approach of the Solicitor General, that
it is the state running the schools, that they determine the
racial composition of the schools; sc that the real question
is whether or not there has been discrimination which
violates the Constitution on this record.

And I would say

first that it is not necessary on the record to reach that

59
issue of whether or not segregation is illegal if there was
no racial discrimination.

But on that question I would

think that certainly discrimination is inf
fact that both courts below agree to it »• that there is a
segregation patternthat the school board does have all this
opportunity and control, that there was widespread bias in
the system, and because of the known inequality of the

schools .
There is one absence in this record, and that is

the absence of any evidence about an important factor, which
is what caused the housing segregation, whether or not
Government was responsible for that, and there are other
cases being litigated, including some pending on certiorari
here where that question has been addressed in evidence and
there have been fact-findings by the courts, on it.

We do

not think it is necessary to reach that—
Q

There was no evidence of that in this record?

MR. NABRXT:

That is correct.

That was not

litigated here, because we viewed the case-i as a de jure case.
Q

1 really do not understand your answer so far

to Mr. Justice Powell's question.

Let us assume that we

accept the findings of two courts below that there was no
de jure segregation in the core area of Denver.

Those were

the findings of two courts; is that correct?
MR. NABRXTs

That was their holding, as we plainly

60

saw.
Q

Let us assume that ««?, accept chat# because we

have to or because we choose to; let us assume that we accept
that.

Then doer this case present# as I understood

Mr, Justice Powel.’s question# does this case present the
issue about whether or not the distinction that the Court
has previously made between- de jure and de facto segregation
is an invalid and unsuoportable distinction?
MR. NABRIT:

Faced with that decision# I would

still argue that we should win the case.

1 would be willing

to follow it out to Its logical conclusion if I had to# that
the inequality argument justifies relief without regard to
that and# indeed, that the school board really does control
the racial composition of schools as implied-Q

By its inaction in the face of changing

neighborhood patterns# by its inaction in correcting
predominantly non-Anglo schools# by abolishing the neighbor­
hood school system# that that is enough to violate the
Constitution by standing by and seeing these neighborhood
shifts?
MR. NABRIT:

I do not envision any realistic

record as involving only inaction, but that certainly might
be part of it.
Q

They make decisions—
We begin this question by assuming that they

took no affirmative action to segregate.

That is the basis

61
of Mr, Justice Powell's question, that there was no
affirmative segregative action on the part of the school
board in the core area.
MR. NABRIT:

I think that as a matter of making a

prima facie case of violation of the Constitution, the plain
tiffs can do it by showing, whether it is a substantive rale
or not. I do not fciow—certainly in terms of making out a
prima facie case of discrimination, plaintiffs can do it
without showing what the Court of Appeals called odious
intent.

I do not know any other answer, Mr. Justice Stewart.

X am not trying to evade the question.

It is certainly

open to the Court to reach the de facto issue
chose.

here if it so

What we are .urging is that it is not necessary.

And

if the Court found it necessary to reach that issue, then
we would urge that in any event we should win the case, that
whatever discriminatory intent--if discriminatory intent is
necessary, then it is inferable; and we made out a prima facie
case which requires that it be rebutted.
Q

Mr. Waferit, my understanding of Justice

Stewart's and Justice Powell's question is, Supposing we
reach a point where we find that discriminatory intent is not
inferable with respect to the Court, then what do you ask us
to do, to reconsider the distinction between de facto and
da jure?
MR. NABRIT;

I would argue the proposition.

The

7
62
alternative is the question of proving a priraa facie case
and as a question of substantive law.

I think the school

board really did control the racial composition of the
schools and that deliberate segregation is widespread.

So

that when you show evidence such as we have here, a situation,
to use Judge Doyle’s phrase, that looks just as if they
deliberately segregated—and Judge Doyle said the results
are just the same as if they had a segergation policy.

But

what I find here is that they had an explanation, a rational
justification for this.

I say that is not enough, that they

have to have a compelling justification for producing this
kind of segregatcry result, whether with or without intent.
I hope that is a complete answer, and I know I have
gone over my time.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Mr. Greiner, and Mr. Ris.
