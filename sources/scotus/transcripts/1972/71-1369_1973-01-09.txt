MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mrs. Cohen, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. LILLIAN Z. COHEN,
FOR THE PETITIONERS
MRS. COHEN:

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The question presented by these cases is whether
state prisoners, complaining about the manner of their
confinement, should be able to obtain equitable relief under
the Civil Rights Act, given the applicability of the federal
habeas corpus statute.
When these actions were commenced, each of the
respondents was confined in a state prison.

Each was in

custody, pursuant to a valid state court judgment of
conviction.
Each had been deprived of good conduct time credits
by the Department of Corrections as a result of a disciplinary
action and each immediately proceeded to the Federal District
Court with a combined petition for a writ of habeas corpus
and Civil Rights complaint.
In each case, the district court held a hearing and
granted relief on the merits, rejecting the state’s
argument that the actions were in the nature of habeas corpus

4
applications.
Each of the Respondents was released from physical
confinement as a result of the district court’s decision.
Individual panels of the Second Circuit heard
appeals by the state taken in all three cases.

The panels

which reviewed Rodriguez and Katzoff reversed the district
court on the ground that the applications were in the nature
of habeas corpus petitions and there had been a failure to
exhaust the state court remedy.
Before

Kritsky was decided, a motion to en banc

Rodriguez and Katzoff was granted and Kritsky was ordered
included in the en banc consideration.

Counsel were

directed to brief and be prepared to argue two specific
questions unrelated to the merits of these cases.
The first was the applicability of the doctrine
of abstention and the second was the need to exhaust the
state court remedies.
After this Court’s decision in ¥11wording against
Swenson, the circuit court reversed the panel decisions in
Rodriguez and Katzoff and affirmed the district court in
all three cases.
It is evident from the eight opinions that were
written by the court below that until this Court decided
Wllwording, the Second Circuit was evenly divided In
considering this case, by a vote of six to

six on the

5
question of whether the claims raised should first have been
presented to the state courts and what is even more
interesting is, aside from the diverse opinion, the division
of opinion between the members of the court, is the fact that
even among those who were very firm in their belief that the
state should first have considered these claims, there was
no agreement as to whether exhaustion of remedies was
required under the habeas corpus statute or whether
exhaustion of remedies should be required under the Civil
Rights Act.
Judges Friendly, Mansfield and Mulligan believed
that these are all habeas corpus petitions and that the
exhaustion requirement of section 225*1 is applicable.
Judges

Lombard, Moore and Hayes believed that

these might be considered as Civil Rights actions, but that
in any event, despite the earlier decisions of this Court,
exhaustion of state Judicial remedies was in order.
After Wilwordlng, a majority of the court below
felt that they were bound to accept the inmate’s choice of
remedy and based upon these earlier decisions of this court,
held that exhaustion of state judicial remedies would not
be required in these cases.
Petitioners seek reversal of the decision below
on the ground that the choice of remedy should not lie with
the inmate, as it presently does because any claim he may

6
raise regarding the legality of his custody is essentially in
the nature of habeas corpus.
Custody is at the heart of the habeas corpus
statute.

Section 224l says, "The writ of habeas corpus shall

not extend to a prisoner unless he is in custody in violation
of the Constitution.'1
Section 2254 says that, "A federal court shall not
entertain an application for a writ of habeas corpus in
behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of
a state court conviction only on the ground that he is in
custody in violation of the Constitution."
The decisions of this Court, which we cite in our
brief, make it clear that custody, as it is used in the
statute, refers not simply to the reason the inmate is being
confined, but to all the incidents of confinement as well.
Wilwording against Swenson reaffirmed this in the
context of the 8th Amendment claims that were there raised.
Actually, the respondents in this case do not deny the
validity of this classification so much as they fear the
application of the exhaustion requirements in section 2254
and the arguments which they raise in reply to the question
which the state has presented to the court and which is really
not so much the invention of the state in this case as it is
the concern of the circuit court which enbancked these cases.
relate to the exhaustion requirements, whether or not there is

7
any detriment to the inmate.
The reason which they emphasize the most, and which
I believe to be the least tenable, is that there will be a
delay to the state prisoner in reaching a federal forum.
The reason I feel that this is the least tenable is
that delay in reaching a federal court for a state prisoner
or for any citizen has relevance only insofar as there is no
adequate state court remedy.
Q

Mrs. Cohen, is this a question that should

be decided by this court just on the basis of competing policy
considerations, or is it basically a statutory Inquiry as to
what Congress has provided?
MRS. COHEN:

Well, I commenced my argument with a

reading from the statute of sections that I am sure this
bench is very familiar with.

I think that, initially, the

proper classification of these cases is determined by statute.
In this case you have a habeas corpus statute.

The essence

of that statute is custody and it is custody in the context of
a state court judgment of conviction and the sentence which
follows.
Therefore, I think that the jumping-off point for
any consideration of where state prisoner claims should be
presented is the habeas corpus statute.
Q

Of course —

Even though the state prisoner isn’t attacking

the judgment under which he is convicted?

8
MRS. COHEN:

Yes, I think that, based upon the

decisions of this court, we have passed the point where
conceptually, the habeas

corpus statute — or legally, the

habeas corpus statute is devoted simply to state court judg­
ment of conviction and sentence.

I think this Court made

that clear, as X said, in Wilwordlng against Swenson in the
context of 8th Amendment claims; it did so in the context of
Johnson against Avery, which raised a question about the
constitutionality of a 3tate prison regulation.
And as I say, I don’t believe that Respondents
really deny the appropriateness of this classification,
that if you — they don’t claim that these cases are not
properly habeas corpus.

I suppose if you asked them which

category they would prefer to be in, they would say that if
they really had to choose one or the other, their .choice
would lie with the

Civil Rights Act, but that is simply

because the decisions of this Court today are that the
exhaustion of state judicial remedies

would not be

required.
Q

Also — but also damages?

MRS. COHEN:

In the beginning, I would point out,

cases before this Court do not raise damage claims.
Q

I understand that, but if you had the choice

to make and you wanted — you would like to retain whatever
possibility there is to get damages?

9
MRS. COHEN:

Well, the position that is talcen by

the state does not preclude a damage action by the Inmate.
Q

Under what?

MRS. COHEN:

The Civil Rights Act.

Habeas corpus

is not a remedy for damage action and we are not arguing that.
I don’t —
Q

Yes, but you would — would you say that there

had to be an exhaustion of state remedies first, or not?

On

the damage question?
MRS. COHEM:

Not on the pure damage question and

we did not argue that in our initial brief when we set forth
the way in which we believed the damage could be handled.
Q

So this is really — so this isn’t — the

state’s position is this is really, in some respects, both?
It is proper under both procedures?
MRS. COHEN:

Yes.

But in one situation, what we
1

are saying is, that if the claims that are in the nature of
equitable claims, which should be properly treated under the
habeas corpus statute, because of the custody considerations
and because of other policy considerations as well.
damage action is
Q

The pure

incumbent under the Civil Rights Act.
Do I misunderstand you when I understand

this, that your claim is that, first of all, it is limited
to cases involving prisoners in state custody?
MRS. COHEN:

Yes

10

Q

And secondly, that when' the complaint is

either of the custody of itself or of the conditions of the
custody and when the — and Insofar as the relief iss either
release or correction of the conditions of those custodies,
then habeas corpus is and must be, should be an exclusive
remedy.
MRS. COHEN:

That is a perfect summary of the

position which we adopt and i-rhieh is consistent with the
decisions of this court.

This court has made it clear that

habeas corpus applies exactly for this kind of claim.
Q

Now -—

And questions of damages can properly be

left to ari action under the Civil Rights Act.
MRS. COHEN:

That they can and, not only that, but

that — damages —
Q

And that they are not appropriate in habeas

corpus?
MRS. COHEN:
Q

Thatfs right.

Not a kind of a relief that a habeas corpus

petition can give.
MRS. COHEN:

That is why I believe that what we are

asking the court to hold in these cases is not at all as
revolutionary as counsel for Respondents would suggest.
But, also important, given the nature of prison
rights litigation, is the fact that damages really play a
very small part in Civil Rights litigation.

11
Q

I see that, Mrs. Cohen.

I gather — am I

right in my history? — that the extension of habeas corpus
to state prisoners came in about 1867s did it not?
MRS. COHEN:
Q

Yes.

And the predecessor of 1983 which was what,

the old section one. of the old Ku IQux Klan Act, wasn't it?
MRS. COHEN:
Q

Was that about —

MRS. COHEN:
Q

That was about 1871, I think.

— 1877?

MRS. COHEN:
Q

Yes.

Yes.

Is there anythingin thelegislative

of either to indicate that Congress -— of

course,

history
we are

dealing with two federal statutes — that Congress meant that
the prisoner should have to take one and couldn't go to the
other if he preferred?
MRS. COHEN:

There is absolutely nothing in the

history of either statute to indicate that either statute
was intended to reach these claims at all.
Q

Then on what basis do you suggest that we

should say to the state prisoner, "Congress said that you
have to go to a federal habeas in these situations and that
you can't Invoke the remedy of 1983."
MRS. COHEN:

I am not asking this Court to say that

Congress said that the state prisoner should go to habeas

12
corpus statute.

What I believe is that Congress did hot

create the situation which exists right now.

There is

nothing in the history to show that either of these statutes
should reach these prison rights claims.
Q

Well, then —

MRS. COHEM:

The fact is that it is only within

the last ten years that these claims are considered
Q

Then

on what basis are you suggesting

that

we should say to the state prisoner —
MRS. COHEN:
Q

Because —

— that "Congress has provided you with two

remedies, but you must take the federal habeas.

You may not

invoke the 1983."
MRS. COHEN:
decisions by this

To begin with, it is on the basis of

Court that both of these remedies have

been held applicable to these claims, so for that reason I
suggest that it lies with this
that is created.

Court to remedy the situation

I would also point out that there is

nothing in either of these statutes to preclude the consider­
ation of challenges to conviction and sentence under the
Civil Rights Act and yet I don’t think anyone would suggest
that seriously, nor would this court consider seriously that
the Civil Rights Act was available to challenge your custody
insofar as your conviction may have been unconstitutionally
obtained.

13
Q

You want to limit 1983 to damage claims?

MRS. COHEN:
Q

For prisoners.

Which it should be.

MRS. COHEN:

For state prisoners, ye3.

Because X

think that the state prisoner can get the kind of relief that
he needs and he can get it just as efficiently, if not more
efficiently, given the nature of the habeas corpus remedy
by restricting it to that.
Q

With state prisoners, the gravanum of whose

complaint is the custody or the conditions of custody.
MRS. COHEN:
Q

Yes, and necessarily —

You wouldn't

limit it

to — youwouldn’t

say, they can’t bring Civil Rights suits

in other contexts,

just because they’re prisoners?
MRS. COHEN:

No, as I expressed the question

initially, I am saying that in the context of claims that
relate to the legality of their custody.
Q

Right or the

MRS. COHEN:

■—

Or the incidents of their custody in

any custody.
Q

Right.

MRS. COHEN:

And as I say, you are not depriving the

inmate of anything by saying that he is restricted to what
is really the appropriate statute.

He is —- the argument that

is relied upon by Respondents, as I indicated before, is the

14
alleged delay in reaching forum-, but, given adequate state
remedies3 the delay is not a source of prejudice to the
inmate.

In the case where you have —
Q

If they are nots then he doesn’t need to

exhaust them.
MRS. COHEN:

Not at all.

Exactly.

That is

exactly the standard for the operation of section 2254.

For

example, in Wilwording against Swenson, this court held that
Missouri provided no remedies to state prisoners for the
presentation of this type of claim.
Presumably, since the Wilwording decision,
Missouri has not created any new remedies t) or any remedies at
all.

Every state prisoner in Missouri could come directly to

a federal court and present his claims by way of habeas
corpus.

There is not a question of any delay.
On the other hand, where you have a state like New

York, which has remedies, we believe that the Interests of
the state and its responsibility for these cases require
that the application of the section 2254 requirement apply.
You have —
Q

Which administrative remedies?

MRS. COHEN:
Q

I am referring to both remedies here.

Well, does he have to pursue, if they are

alternative, does he have to pursue both?
MRS. COHEN:

Well, administrative remedies would

15
not apply in every situation in any event.
you had a situation where an inmate was

I think that if

challenging the

constitutionality of a regulation, you would not —
Q

He would go to a court.

MRS. COHEN:

He would go directly to a court

because it would not lie within the power of the administrator
to review it, so in that context, the administrative
exhaustion would not result in any delay, either.
On the other hand, if he is going to be suing the
Department of Correction on the ground that a regulation was
improperly applied to him, it seems to me that the claim
is not ripe until the Department of Corrections has taken
some action with respect to it.
Q

Now —

That would then involve exhaustion of the

administrative process, including judicial, state judicial
review, if any.
MRS. COHEN:
Q

That is right.

That is right.

So that if he is complaining about problems

in the prison, he would have to go for habeas corpus?
MRS. COHEN:

Exactly.

But that is — well, that is

the remedy this Court has already recognized as applicable
to these cases.
Q

So that if he is serving life imprisonment

and he complained about the fact that they hit him over the
head with a club, his relief is to be released?

16
?®RS. COHEN:

Oh, no, because the one thing that the

decisions of this court have made clear In expanding the
custody concept of the habeas corpus statute is that release
is not the sole relief that can be granted under the habeas
corpus statute.
The habeas corpus statute

says the court shall

deal with the situation as law and justice require and that
means that he would be relieved of the illegal restraint
under thi3 remedy.
confinement.
Q

He would not be released from physical

It is in the statute.
The prison has a standard rule in all the

prisons in New York that redhaired people shall not eat.
Habeas corpus?
MRS. COHEN:
custody.

Yes, because this is an incident of

In this case, what you have is a restraint that

goes beyond the legal inips of a sentence that has been
Imposed by state court.
Q

You don’t think the Civil Rights Act would

reach that?
MRS. COHEN:

The Civil Rights Act would not reach

it unless there was a basis for a tenable damage claim, in
which case the inmate could come to the federal court and
make damage claim.
Q

The 1983 isn't limited to damages.

MRS. COHEN:

No, It Is not.

On the other hand —

17
Q

It is also equitable.

MRS. COHEN:

On the other hand, you are dealing

with a situation —
Q

And you wouldn’t have a right to get an

injunction to say, "Follow the Constitution and stop
violating it."
MRS. COHEN:

The — well, the view we take is that

habeas corpus is actually a better remedy than the injunctive
proceeding because, presumably, the inmate would come in and
seek a preliminary injunction under the Civil Rights Act so
that he would get his food but the habeas corpus statute
would provide him with just as expeditious a review and it
would give him a final determination, expeditiously.
Q

It would provide him with food.

MRS. COHEN:
Q

As soon as he filed it?

MRS. COHEN:
Q

Oh, yes, because ~

Excuse me?

As soon as he filed his habeas corpus he

would get his food.
MRS. COHEN:

Well, there is —- it depends whether

you are talking about filing his habeas corpus.
in New York —■ New York has an injunctive remedy.

For example,
If this

inmate who is not getting his food in New York went Into
court, under the injunctive remedy specifically applicable
to constitutional claims raised by state prisoners, he would

18
get his injunctive relief right under that statute.

It is

designed to reach that kind of claim.
Q

The state statute?

MRS. COHEN:
Q

Yes, and that is —

Which I am not — I haven't reached that yet.

Is there any action in habeas corpus that is similar to it,
TRO?
MRS. COHEN?

Well, my point is that there is no

relief for it.
Q

Is there?

MRS. COHEN:
Q

No.

And there is nothing like a preliminary

habeas corpus, is there?
MRS. COHEN:
Q

That's all I wanted to know.

MRS. COHEN:
Q

No, there is a final habeas corpus —

There is a final —

So if you wanted some immediate relief, how

can you get it in habeas corpus as swiftly as you can by
temporary restraining order?
MRS. COHEN:

Because when he comes into federal

court on a habeas corpus petition, the statute, the habeas
corpus statute, requires that that application be
expeditiously decided, unlike a Civil Rights Act where there
is no legal injunction in the statute that the action has
to be specifically decided.

19
Q

It is difficult for me to believe that before

coming to the habeas corpus court, we must go to state
court.
MRS. COHEN:

But that only assumes that state

remedies are inadequate and what I have been referring to
now is an injunction proceeding that is available by statute,
specifically for this type of thing.
Q

In the state courts?

MRS. COHEN:
Q

Yes, it is, it is an —

It wouldn’t be a habeas corpus suit there,

or anything of the kind.

It would be a specific, equitable

action provided for by the state
MRS. COHEN:

law.

Provided for in state law and

enacted —
Q

He would have to first exhaust, I thought

you told us, the state-administered remedies?
MRS. COHEN:

Well, he would have to, but in that

respect it wouldn’t be any different than if he were a
federal prisoner.

A federal prisoner, before he can come

into a court, any court — well, federal court — end seek
any relief from his confinement, must pursue his administrative
remedies.
Q

How about a 1983 suit?

MRS. COHEN:

He can’t come in under 1983 because

if he is suing the federal administrator if there is no

20
state action —
Q

But let’s assume it were a 1983 suit

against state people?

You don't have to exhaust administrative

remedies?
MRS. COHEN:

Yes.

We are saying that if there are

administrative remedies available, that the inmate who is
being deprived of food — suppose you have a situation of a
very vindictive warden, as Mr. Justice Marshall suggested,
who will not give food to redheads.

There is nothing to

prevent the correction of that by the Commissioner of the
Department of Corrections upon an appropriate appeal.

The

case might never reach a federal court, based upon that,
based upon that assumption, but in any event, the — and as
I say, if this were a federal

prisoner who had the same

grievance against his warden, he would have to pursue that
remedy before he could come to a federal court for
injunctive relief, and that is a disparity which

Respondents

have never answered except to say that section 1983 does not
apply to the federal prisoner.
Fay is it so much more onerous for a state prisoner
to have to exhaust available administrative remedies which
really go to the rightness of the claim?
Q

And the fact is ~

I thought you decided that they don't have to

do it in 1983?
MRS. COHEN:

Well, that is what I am asking this

21
Court to reconsider in this case because, to the extent
that 1983 has been extended to state prisoners for purposes
of equitable relief, it seems to me that that is

an

inappropriate extension and that it should be withdrawn.
Now, the Respondents cite figures that are —
Q

And your reason is?

MRS. COHEN:
statute.

That habeas corpus is the appropriate

It deals with custody and it deals with state

prisoners’ custody.
Q

So that a state prisoner, whatever happens to

him, his sole relief In the federal courts is by habeas
corpus?
MRS. COHEN:

That is right, and you are not

depriving him of anything.

You are giving him an expeditious

remedy, a remedy which I think we have demonstrated works
more quickly for him in terms of getting him relief and
places less of a burden on him of going forward with

his

action.
Q

How Is it quicker than a preliminary

Injunction?
MRS. COHEN:

Well, the preliminary injunction —

one disadvantage that I see —
Q

You can make preliminary Injunction In

three days.
MRS. COHEN:

But that assumes a sophistication on

the part of the inmate to seek a preliminary injunction.

22
Based upon my experience, if I may refer to that, I have yet
to see a pro se application for a preliminary injunction.
They, initially, will file a — there may be, in cases where
counsel is representing the petitioner — but in pro se cases
they will file a Civil Rights complaint.
their relief.

They will ask for

It will be treated the way any other civil

complaint is treated and —
Q

Now, if you take my case, he has the finest

criminal lawyer in the world.
MRS. COHEN:

The disadvantage that I see is that

you'd get a bifurcated decision.

If you do this under the

Civil Rights Act, you go in and you get a preliminary
injunction under the Civil Rights Act and then you -—
Q

Then he starts eating.

MRS. COHEN:

Yes.

And then you have to get an

underlying — a final determination as to whether or not there
is validity to the claim.
Q

In the meantime, he is eating.

MRS. COHEN:
Q

He is eating.

And if he goes the other way, he won't be

eating?
MRS. COHEN:
Q

No, my point is —

Until the habeas corpus is decided.

MRS. COHEN:

There is no reason why the habeas

corpus can't result in a speedier decision and, in fact, I

23
think it does, given the emergency situation which you
imposed.
Q

How much time do you have to reply to the

habeas corpus petition?
MRS. COHEN:
Q

Twenty days.

That is 20

I will say —

days and nights?

«i

MRS. COHEN:
Q

No, that is not so, be cause —

Right?

MRS. COHEN:

Habeas corpus is na emergency remedy.

That is the concept of habeas corpus remedy.
Q

Oh, I know, it takes precedence and I also

know the size of the dockets in our present ■— In some
courts, means that you get one year instead of four.
MRS. COHEN:

As a practical matter, these are

Civil Rights actions and these — ostensibly, the. options before this Court now were emergency actions, too and yet, there
was no decision in these cases — in one of these cases — for
10 months, which passed by a long shot the time in which the
man Involved claimed he was entitled to be released.

So

that it is not so clear that under the Civil Rights Act there
is going to be a more expeditious remedy.
Q

I would think that there was a possibility

that you could get preliminary injunction sooner than you
could get a final decision in any case.
MRS. COHEN:

Suppose we were to take the preliminary

24
injunction hypothetical in the context of good time cases?
Q

Well9 why not take a TRO while you are at it?

MRS. COHEN:
Q

A temporary restraining order?

Which can be given in three seconds.

MRS. COHEN:

There is nothing to preclude the

operation of the habeas corpus statute in that way.

There is

nothing that says that a judge has to wait for a response
from the state and, In fact* in upstate New York, typically,
the state does not put in any opposition in these cases.
They are decided right off the cuff by the judge to whom
the petition is presented.
Q

Well, I can’t put my ticket on what happens

in upstate New York or upstate Podunk.

I am talking about

the general difference between habeas corpus and temporary
restraining orders and preliminary injunctions and I know
you can get a TRO without any notice in nothing flat,
MRS. COHEN:
Q

But I —

But I never heard of a writ of habeas corpus

being Issued without giving the other side an opportunity to
open its mouth.
MRS. COHEN:

And based upon the experience that I

have seen in my office in virtually every habeas corpus
application upstate, and probably the reason we wind up
with so many appeals in the Second Circuit is the fact that
we never put in a response upstate.

Those judges get the

25
petitions and they decide them without any response from the
state.

So there is no uniform —
Q

And how soon do they decide?

MRS. COHEN:
Q

Well, the very study that was cited —

I mean, we are so far out of the record

in this case, I don’t mid going that one step further.
MRS. COHEN:

I don’t have specific figures except

that the study that is cited by respondent indicates that in
some cases, the average is four months, but that doesn’t
mean that it can’t be sooner and it doesn’t mean that it
can’t be later.

The average in the ordinary Civil Rights

action has no comparison.

It is much slower.

The reason that Petitioners are urging this Court
to hold that an exhaustion requirement is applicable is
because it is — it places the responsibility with the state,
which Is where it belongs.

It Is the state courts which

place these people in custody.

It is the state which should

decide the limits and incidents of the sentences that it
imposes.
The good conduct cases are a perfect example of
this because, as we heard in the prior case considered by
this court today, things like good time parole e,legibility
all enter into the sentencing process.

There is a direct

relationship there between sentences as Imposed by state
courts and how sentence is carried out.

It is in that

26

situation that we think that the state courts have the
responsibility of deciding these cases first.
Another example are cases involving the place of
confinement where a man is claiming that "I should not be in
a state prison.

I should be in a hospital" or "I should be in

a narcotics addiction control center."
Here you are talking about the very Justification
for sentence and you are talking about something where the
responsibility lies with the state courts which imposed the
sentences and, similarly, the reason — another reason for
requiring this is that the state is regulating virtually
every aspect of the inmates' confinement.
Unlike any comparable situation with the ordinary
citizen, you have the state — a situation where Virtually
every action which is taken with respect to the inmate is
»

state action and lends itself to litigation.

If there is

no exhaustion requirement, it seems to me that the federal
courts are going to have to bear the burden of these cases
and they are going to have to become involved in this very
complex regulatory scheme.
The need to have some guidelines for considering
these cases I think was expressed with great urgency by the
court below and I think that they are asking this Court for
guidance and we believe that the answer to their problem
lies in the habeas corpus statute, not with Congress, but

27
with the statute which is already on the books arid which is
applicable and that cases challenging conditions of confine­
ment., no less than cases challenging conviction, share a
common denominator which is custody, and that they belong
under the habeas corpus statute.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mrs. Cohen.

Mr. Schwartz.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF HERMAN SCHWARTZ, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. SCHWARTZ:

Mr. Chief Justice and niay it

please the Court:
I should first like, if I may, to take a minute or
two to give some of the facts underlying these cases because
although the only issue for this Court is the Jurisdictional
issue, the only issue on which cert was granted, the lower
court, the Court of Appeals in its en banc decision affirmed
all three cases on the merits and the merits were argued in
several.
The first two cases, Kritsky and Rodriguez involved
very serious disciplinary due process issues in ivhich men
were denied good time on cases which the district court and
affirmed by the circuit court found were grossly deficient
procedures.
Mr. Katzoff, who received relief very quickly, by
the way, v/as punished with 60 days good time loss and 60 days

28
solitary confinement for writing titfo mildly derogatory
comments, "creep11 and "cigar-smoking S.Q.B." in diaries which
in
he did not circulate and itfhich, as the Court of Appeals and
the district court found, every institution in which he had
been, permitted him to keep.
Those are the merits and on each of those three
cases, the circuit court affirmed on the merits after
discussion and consideration of both.
Now, what the state is asking in this case is
really

very simple.

It is asking the Court to repudiate a

long line of well-established principles, most recently re­
affirmed last term in two cases, in Wllwording and in the
footnote

in Humphrey v. Cady, footnote 18, to the effect

that a state prisoner can challenge the conditions of
confinement under 1983.
We are not urging this Court to reclassify every
case as 1983*
available.

We do not deny that habeas corpus may be

This Court said so last term and that is not the

issue in this case.
The issue in this case is whether every habeas
corpus case — every prisoners* rights case, every

1983

case, shall be carved out of the jurisdiction of 1983 and
construed not the way this Court, not the way I am told
lower courts have construed them, namely as 1983 cases, but
shall construe them as habeas corpus cases requiring an

29

exhaustion requirement and we say, as Mr. Justice Brennan
pointed out, the statute was enacted in 1871.

There liras

obviously no thought at that time, I am quite sure, to deal
with prisoners® cases.

They obviously vie re dealing with

problems of friction between federal and state courts, as
was pointed out in Mltchum and Foster quite clearly, and it
v/as very clear that they gave a federal forum in what vias
then an almost revolutionary change in the federal jurisdiction,
a federal forum for federal rights and without having to go
all the way through the state system and in 1961 in Monroe
and Pape and in every case since then, Including three
prisoner cases, Holton and Schaeffer, Wilwordlng and
Humphrey and Cady, which raises related problems about the
proper place of confinement for someone committed under the
Wisconsin Sexually Deviant Act,

In every one of these cases,

this Court has said flatly, there is no requirement of
exhaustion of either administrative or judicial remedies.
Q

Mr. Schwarts?

MR. SCHWARTZ:
Q

Yes, sir.

Do you think a 1983 action would lie to

challenge a judgment under which a man was being held, a
state court judgment if the frame was unconstitutional.
MR. SCHWARTZ:

No, your Honor, that's very clearly

a habeas corpus issue, not because of the nature of the
classification, but because of the policy involved in the

30

exhaustion doctrine.
is very clear.

The policy in the exhaustion doctrine

It is to avoid friction between the Judgment

of a state court which it has entered or in which it is
holding somebody in custody and the judgment of the federal
court.

That was the basis for ex parte Royal and that Is

what is involved and that is why several courts have said
that when an attempt was made to challenge a conviction
under 1983, that was really an attempt to evade and we would
say we quite agree.

An attempt to evade simply should not

be permitted because it is an attempt to evade the
exhaustion requirement.
But what we are dealing with here, and this is the
essence of it, we are dealing with administrative action
which occurs in a variety of settings with a variety of
consequences and with a variety of remedies.

The question

about damages was absolutely on point In terms of what is
at stake here because these are damage actions as well as
equitable actions.

It depends on whether the thing is

monetary, but whatever benefits are sought to be gained
from an exhaustion requirement would immediately be defeated
by that and not because it is a question of evading it but
because, according to the state's own argument, both
remedies are available.

Always both forms are available

and every 1983 — every challenge to conditions can obviously
be a challenge for monetary damages.

31
The fact is that the state, in its brief, goes
somewhat farther than they went in oral argument because
what they said is if there is a damage claim, one has to go
into the state court to get the merits decided and then into
federal court to get damages.
Now, the claim that this is habeas corpus because
it is custody —
Q

Even

if that were so, if the state court’s

determination were adverse

to the claim, then it would be

res judicata —
MR. SCHWARTZ:
Q

—* in the 1983, xirouldn't it?

MR. SCHWARTZ:
Implication.

Yes, it would, your Honor.

I take it that is the clear

I can’t see any reason why it wouldn’t be,

which, in effect —
Q

I don't understand that that is the state’s

contention, that, in short, exhaustion of state remedies is
necessary before a 1983 action.
MR. SCHWARTZ:

Your Honor, on page 40 in their

brief they say, "On the contrary, if an inmate obtains relief
in the state courts by demonstrating a violation of the
constitutional right
Q

If he does.

MR. SCHWARTZ:
Q
courts.

Yes.

"—there is no —"

That doesn’t say he has to go to the state

32
MR. SCHWARTZ:
Q

Quite a different point.

MR. SCHWARTZ:
Q

Well —

I'm sorry, your Honor?

Quite a different point,

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Well, if the exhaustion philosophy

that they are urging —
Q

That is the whole point.

They concede that

there need not be exhaustion befor*e a Civil Rights action
is brought.

That Is the whole point of the argument.

MR. SCHWARTZ:

If — damages action — xirell, if

that is the case, then the entire policy of what they are
urging, which is the burden on the courts, friction, all of
the rest goes out the window and there is no point to it at
all.

After all, classifications, whether or not one is

going to carve out an exception, and again I say, your Honors,
that the statute gives the right to a state prisoner under
1983.

They are going to carve out an exception and the

exception is in order to avoid federal-state friction, in
order to somehow avoid the burdens on these courts.
Q

You say the statute gives the right to the

prisoner under 1983.

If you read 1983 literally, without

regard to the habeas corpus provision, you could use it to
challenge the state judgment of conviction, couldn't you?
MR. SCHWARTZ:

That is quite true, your Honor and

it is at that point that the fundamental policy involved in

33
ex parte Royal comes Into the picture.
not apply here.

Such a policy does

What we are dealing with Is administrative

action.
After all, In 19^8, when Judge Parker tried to get
the habeas corpus statute amended even more, the problem that
he raised was that of a federal district judge sitting In
judgment on the Supreme Court of the state.

What the state

Is urging would produce precisely that because it would
require that there be state recourse, state judicial
remedies.

In fact, they go farther.

They make prisoners

do a double job, contrary to what this Court said in
Wilwording, that state prisoners are not held to a higher
standard, they would make It doubly higher, first the
administrative jump, which :Ls difficult to see from their
argument as to habeas corpus, and then the judicial jump and
what would then happen is that a federal district court
would be sitting in judgment on a 3tate supreme court’s
ruling on whether or not there was a violation of the
federal Constitution.
Now, that will, if anything, exascerbate the
federal-state relations because that is precisely the kind
of problem that some of the movements for amendment of the
habeas corpus act produced.
Q

You mean, the state courts would rather be

by-passed completely than

second-guessed?

Is that

34
your argument?
MR. SCHWARTZ:

Well, we are .dealing with 3tate

administrative action here and most of the state courts
have frankly said that because many of the state courts still
retain the hands-off doctrine and many of the states courts
still say that this is a matter for the executive and, your
Honors, prisons are really not that unique.

The same

argument —■
Q

So you don’t deny that these prisoners

wouldn’t have a remedy in the state courts, do you?
MR. SCHWARTZ:
state.

They — it depends on the particular

In New York they would have.
Q

Well, let’s talk about New York.

MR. SCHWARTZ:

>

They would have an action for

equitable relief under Section 79C, yes,

of the New York

Civil Rights law.
Q

So there is a provision in the New York laws

to resort to state courts?
MR. SCHWARTZ:
Q

Yes.

Do you think the New York courts would prefer

to be by-passed altogether?
MR. SCHWARTZ:

It is hard for me to answer what

a whole group of courts would prefer to do, a whole group
of individuals.
Q

Well, we have a representative of the state

35
coming here saying that the state does not prefer to be
by-passed.
MR. SCHWARTS:

I would take it, then, they icould

not prefer to be by-passed.

I would take the Attorney

General?s recommendation on that.

But, of course, the whole

premise of the Civil Rights Act, as Cruz let out, and
Monroe and Pape and in Mitchum and Poster, is that when we
are dealing

with federal rights, a suitor has the right to

a federal forum and he has the right without exhaustion and
cases are legion to that effect.
Just last year, on the administrative issue, in —
Q

You still agree, don't you, that the 1983

statute must be accommodated to the federal habeas corpus
statute?

And when you do get into the area of challenging a

judgment, at least then you say that 1983 although literally
on its face reads on this situation, it nevertheless does not
cover it.
MR. SCHWARTZ:
Q

That is right, your Honor.

And you would also say, I suppose, that if

you are not challenging a judgment but you are claiming
release from custody for failure to get good time or what?
Would you say —
MR. SCHWARTZ:
Q

No.

No, on the —

— that is a 1983 case?

MR. SCHWARTS:

Yes, your Honor, because the good

36
time factor is purely fortuitous because to make the issue
turn on whether or not good time is involved makes it turn
on whether the action of the state that is challenged
involves the sanction involving the release of good time.
And •—
Q

And that, historically, the federal habeas

corpus would reach something even before judgment, wouldn't it?
MR. SCHWARTZ:

Yes.

Initially, it was available

for prejudgment.
Q

Historically, It would reach something

that would only before a judge and court.
MR. SCHWARTZ:

That is right, but, essentially,

what we are dealing with is still action by a state court.
That is the problem of the friction.
to ex parte Royal.

That is what gave rise

In fact, ex parte Royal deals with the

prejudgment situation.

It deals with a lawyer who was

confined before the trial.

But — and insofar as we are

dealing with review of state court action, and it Is the
state court, here the exhaustion doctrine applies.

But If

we are dealing with good time, a simple hypothetical will
illustrate It.
Suppose the state has a rule that prohibits black
and white prisoners from mingling together and two such
prisoners — two white prisoners or black prisoners do.
other
One man Is deprived of good time and theXnan, we'll say,

37
loses a good job.

And those things happen all the time.

The first man, challenging exactly the same conduct,
will have to exhaust and go through the entire state system
The second man will not, if one makes a turn on
good time.

And if somebody else chooses to sue for damages

for this kind of thing, again, the very same state interest,
the very same state action, simply because there a different
remedy, he will then have to go in and sue.
permitted to

He will then be

—

Q

Am I to understand now that you are

arguing that habeas corpus would not be available in some
of these situations?
MR. SCHWARTZ:

Habeas corpus?

Well, this Court

has said that habeas corpus lies to challenge the conditions
of confinement —
Q

Are you saying there is a choice between

habeas corpus and 1983 —
MR. SCHWARTZ:
Q

I am saying —

— is that what you are 3aying?

MR. SCHWARTZ:

I am saying that this Court said

precisely that.
Q

What is your position?

MR. SCHWARTZ:

My position is that this cases

raises the question of whether 1983 is available.

If I

had to choose, I probably would say, these are essentially

33
challenges to administrative action* official state action,
therefore 1983 would be more appropriate.
Q

On the other —

What is your choice?

MR. SCHWARTZ:

If I ~ well, that is a choice.

If

you are forcing me to say that it be — If you are asking
me to say, the choice Is either an exclusive 1983 or habeas
corpus, then, clearly, I choose an exclusive 1983 because
that Is precisely what the 1871 statute was established for.
Q

But you also, I gather — don’t

you Imply

that — a view that it may be that both remedies are
available and it Is up to the prisoner to choose which.
MR. SCHWARTZ:
Court has said.

I am saying that that Is what this

That is precisely what — in the wording,

part txvo of the VII1 wording decision opens precisely with
that line.

Part two says, "Moreover, although cognizable

and federal habeas corpus — see Johnson and Avery —
petitioners may also be left to plead causes of action
under the Civil Rights Act"and I am saying that this Court
has given them that right.
This case does not raise that issue of whether
he has an habeas corpus right.
Q
here?

In this case, what —

Do you mean that you agree with the state

Are you suggesting we would have to overrule

Wilwordlng?
MR. SCHWARTZ:

Absolutely.

39
Q

Disavow at least that sentence?

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Absolutely.

Not only that, but you

would have to move directly backwards from vrhat you did —
what courts have done in Wllwording and In other cases.

What

courts have done frequently is to say that we will construe
the habeas corpus as 1983.
What the state Is saying is, construe 1983 as
habeas corpus.
Now, there are claims that the federal courts are
being overburdened and that is obviously a very appealing and
important argument.

If the federal court is overburdened

with one kind of case, it means justice is denied to everyone.
But that problem with that argument is, first of all, the
1871 statute or any statute has never been construed to allow
a carve-out because of that problem.
Secondly, the whole question of burden is something
that we really don't know.

The statistics in the ABA brief,

and as you know, the ABA filed an amicus brief in support of
the Respondents position.

The ABA points out that something

like 3.^ percent of the civil cases are prisoner

Civil Rights

Act cases.
The statistics show they take up very little time.
Well, be that as it may, the fact Is that these
complicated questions of burdensomeness,of
remedy, are appropriately for Congress.

appropriate

These involve studies.

40
They involve studies of what is a proper alternative and in
some cases, as the ABA points out properly, the Congress has
decided to Introduce an exhaustion requirement such as —
with — you state utilitiy regulation.

In other cases, there

may be many other devices to handle these problems but,
certainly, as we discovered in the mid-60’s in connection with
habeas corpus, the burden was not what it seemed and over
time, It evened out and flattened out and that would be
true here as well.
The most — in some ways, the most Interesting
aspect of the state’s argument is the request for an
exhaustion of administrative remedies.

If this is habeas

corpus, where does that come from?
YJhat this Court Is really asking, what the state
is really asking this Court to do, is to overrule the long
line of decisions In 1983 cases and the line of recent
prisoner decisions In 1983 cases where the exact ttame
issues were raised.
The exact same arguments were presented and
dismissed in per curiams.
They are asking this Court to repudiate those.
Holton and Schaeffer, the Attorney General of Pennsylvania
said, ’’Prison cases are unique and this will produce
multitudinous litigation.”

This Court rejected that

argument unanimously and per curiam.

In

In McNeese, the Attorney General argued that
education is unique and therefore we have to have special
exhaustion requirements.

This Court rejected that.

Now, I think I have probably said enough to respond
to most of the points that seemed to me to be worth
mentioning on this.

I would say only with respect to one

other thing and that is this:
Our prisons today are in a mess.

Nobody has made

that point more clear than the Chief Justice and the
Presidentj, and there are signs of change.

And those signs

of changes as Maurice Slegler, chairman of the Federal
Parole Board9 said9 are in part a result of the actions of
the federal courts doing what the 1871 Act said they should
do and that is, to make the Constitution

apply to areas

where the states are not fulfulling constitutional mandate.
For this Court now to repudiate this long line of
cases, to say 1983 is not available, is to say to the
prisoner, not meaning that you are a second-class citizen,
which all society says, anyway, but to say to him that you
are second-class with respect to access to federal courts
and with respect to federal rights.
And it seems to me that that would be a devastating
thing to say at this time in our history when there are
beginnings of signs of some improvement and prison change, I —
Q

Would you say that a prisoner is a second-class

citizen with respect to access to federal courts because he
has to exhaust in a habeas corpus challenge or judgment?
MR. SHCWARTZ:

No, not to a judgment because who

else is there who challenges judgments

except prisoners of

one kind or another?
Q

Well, who challenges prison regulations

besides prisoners?
MR. SCHWARTZ:

Oh, I am talking about the whole

range of federal rights and education elsewhere.

As it

happens, others can challenge regulations except prisoners
there.

I guess their families can, if they are suing for

damages and there was harm to them, but, essentially, I
quite agree -with that insofar as by second class I mean, as
opposed to other litigants seeking to affirm federal rights
and I ifould yield the balance of my time unless the Court
has questions on this issue.
Q

Mr. Schwartz, could I ask you, the 1983

approach would be subject to the normal rules of res adjudi­
cata, I take it?
MR. SCHWARTZ:

Yes, your Honor, it would be.

I

see no reason to think that it would not be.
Q

Well, assume we agree with you that a

prisoner resorts to the state courts first.
MR. SCHWARTZ:

Yes.

And then comes to the federal court with a

43
1983 action?
MR. SCHWARTZ:

I would assume that it is res

judicata, just a3 it is with any other litigant.
Q

Even if his action in the state court is

habeas corpus?
MR. SCHWARTZ:

Yes, because — well, to be perfectly

honest, I would think that *—
Q

How did we ever get to that contrary position

in part two of Wilwording?
MR. SCHWARTZ:

Well, the issue in Wilwording, on

that particular issue, was that there was some question as —
I’m sorry, are you talking between the state habeas and the
.federal?
Q

Well, under your position, if. you brought a

state habeas corpus action first —
MR. SCHWARTZ:
Q

Yes.

— and then were turned down and then you

purported to bring a 1983 action in the federal courts, res
judicata?
MR. SCHWARTZ:

Yes, except he was dismissed there

on jurisdictional grounds in the state court.

Missouri said

that there was no remedy that was available, always, this
isn’t the right remedy, and I would think res judicata
would never apply in that context.

Missouri, I think, in

that case, did not consider the issue on the merits.

Q

But if they had?

MB. SCHWARTZ:

I think if they had, I think that

he suffers the burden of any other litigant, which is that
if he has had one day in court, he has had one day in court,
assuming that it was a full and fair hearing and that there
were no infirmities.
Q

But if you were purporting to bring a federal

habeas corpus action, you say that should be available as a
matter of choice, then he must have — if he chose the wrong
remedy in the first place in the state court, he should be

3ent back to get the right one if it is available).
MR. SCHWARTZ:

Well, that is a matter of habeas

corpus lore.
Q

Well, I agree with you, but isn't: that right

under the statute?
MR. SCHWARTZ:

It's an available state — yes, it

is an available remedy, yes.

Which would mean, of course,

that hi3 attempt to get his federal right would be prolonged
even further
Q

Yes,

MR. SCHWARTZ:

—

in a situation when he may be,

as Mr. Justice Marshall says, not eating.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OP MRS. LILLIAN Z. COHEN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MRS. COHEN:

That’s fine.

There are two points that I would like to reply
to.

PIrst9

contrary to what counsel has suggested, we

are not asking this Court to overrule the Wllwordlng decision
The specific holding of Wilwording is entirely consistent
with our position.
claims.

The claims there were habeas corpus

The question was whether or not the exhaustion

requirement applied and this Court held that the claims were
cognizable as habeas corpus claims and, In fact, that the
exhaustion requirement applied.

It is the dictum in

Wllwordlng that we are asking the Court to reconsider and,
Just as a point of Interest, I would like to tell the Court
that in Wllwordlng, on the remand, despite the dictum of
... i

this

Court, the parties and the Court are still considering

these cases as habeas corpus petitions because of the res
judicata problem.
The second point I would like to reply to is the
figures that were cited by counsel with regard to the numbers
of cases that are being brought In the federal courts right
.now:

The fact is that the figures cited in the American Bar

Association study seemed to show a drop in the rate of
increase of prisoners' Civil Rights actions and, to me, that
suggests a real, substantial reply to the concern of counsel

for Respondents that these claims are not being reviewed.
Prison conditions have not changed overnight.

The

prison population has not decreased overnight and yet there
are less of these claims coming into the federal courts in
the last two years.

They must be being decided someplace and

it seems to me that what is happening is that, in line with
the change that has been reflected in recent decisions, not
only of the federal courts but also of the state courts, you
are getting prison conditions corrected by state adminis­
trators and/or by state courts.

And I think that that is

a response to the exhaustion objection that is being raised
today.
Q

Well, Mrs. Cohen, do you think that the

numbers of cases is ever relevant to a constitutional
question?
MRS. COHEN:
Q

Not at all.

If there is a constitutional question.

MRS. COHEN:

I — donTt believe that at any point

in these cases we have argued that the nimbersof cases is a
legal justification for action.

At most, we have suggested

that, as a consequence of the approach which we suggest,
there may be a reduction in the numbers of cases brought,
but that is strictly fall-out.

That is not a legal

argument.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you —

Q

Is this a constitutional question?

MRS. COHEN:

I think vary clearly it has the right —

yes, I think that the —»
Q

Or is

it a matter of which one of these

statutes is applicable, or both?
MRS. COHEN:

Well, I think it has to be considered

a mixed question because you are talking about constitu­
tional rights and the right to redress of Constitution.
Q

The underlying claims are constitutional

claims.
MRS. COHEN:

And you are talking about the right

to present these claims and obtain review and I think that
that that is a constitutional question.
Q

Well, but if neither 1983 nor the habeas

corpus statute were on the books, could these prisoners go
into United States District Court and obtain the relief
they sought?
MRS. COHEN:

Only if they were able to meet the

$10,000 jurisdictional requirement for general litigants.
Q

Well, let’s say there was not that statute,

either.
MRS. COHEN:

They wouldn’t have any recourse then.

It is not constitutional.

Yes, but supposedly, our past decisions have

proceeded on the basis that we

were even then interpreting

our own.

I think that that activity would

require further action by the state in light of the

arguments that we have made today.

To take the other alternative, that we are

construing two alternative statutes or you are arguing two
