PROCEEDING S
MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

first this morning in No. 72-549 and 72-550, School Board of
Richmond against the State Board of Education, and Bradley
against the State Board of Education.
Mr. Coleman, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM T. COLEMAN, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF BRADLEY, ST AL.
MR. COLEMANs Good morning, Mr. Chief Justice? may
it please the Court;
The basic issue here is whether, 19 years after
Brown, State created school division lines were bamboo
curtains in the cause of school segregation in Virginia,
lines which were freely and repeatedly crossed and ignored
to maintain segregated schools in Virginia, now become iron
c urtains constituting an absolute bar to the effective
desegregation plan before the court below.

For, in this

case, the district court found as a fact that Virginia,
through its State school officials, its Legislature, and
its school divisions, including that of Richmond, repeatedly
and consistently violated the black petitioner’s constitutional
right to attend public schools free from State-sponsored
racial segregation.
In other words, the question here is whether a
district court is without power to approve a desegregation

4
relief plan solely because it involves interdivision assignment
of pupils among adjacent divisions.
And if this Court determines that that power has
ever —■ does exist, was there a gross abuse of discretion to
exercise it here when the record includes undisturbed findings
that, one, Virginia, including the three school divisions
here involved, repeatedly ignored the division lines to
preserve segregated schools.
Second, that it was no longer possible to achieve
effective and complete desegregation within the confines of
the Virginia, of Richmond school division itself.
Third, that repeated unconstitutional acts and
intentional delays, directed by Virginia, created this
situation.
Fourth, the school division lines serve no useful
administrative or educational purpose; and the result of such
failure would be to have black and white schools within
walking distance of each other.
In addition, the two adjoining school divisions here
involved, Henrico and Chesterfield, were themselves operating
non-unitary racial systems.
Petitioners in No. 72-550 are black school children,
the defendants are the State Board of Education, the State
Superintendent of Public Instruction, the three Division
School Superintendents who, under Virginia law, incidentally,

5

are centrally nominated, the Legislative bodies of Richmond,
Henrico, and Chesterfield, and the School Boards of these
thre>3 Divisions, each of which, under Virginia law, is an
administrative subdivision of the State.
QUESTION:

You said the School Superintendents,

Mr. Coleman, are centrally nominated?
MR. COLEMAN:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION: What’s that mean?
MR. COLEMAN:

Under Virginia law, it's provided

that the State Board of Education makes up a list of people
eligible to be appointed, and the School Divisions can appoint
only from that list; and, in fact, the Virginia law provides
that if, within sixty days, the person is not appointed if
there's a vacancy, the State Board itself makes the appoint™
ment.
And, incidentally, in this case, the School
Superintendent of the Division of Chesterfield was appointed
in that manner.

He was appointed by the State, because

Chesterfield, within sixty days, had not made the appointment.
Now, from 1371 until the time of the Brown decision,
Virginia’s Constitution, its statutes, and all of its policy­
making authorities compelled each School Division to operate
racially segregated schools.
At the time of the Brown decision, the school
population of the Richmond Division was 43 percent black and

6

57 percent white.

In Chesterfield, it was 21 percent black

and 79 percent white.

In Henrico, it was 11 percent black and

39 percent white.
For the three divisions together, however, the
composite figure was 33.7 percent black and 66.3 percent white.
As I stated before, in each division, regardless of
what the local division would want to do, by State law, black
and white had to attend wholly separate schools.
Now, unfortunately, Brown brought no change whatsoever
On pages 18

through 22 of our brief, we recount the very

successful State actions by State officials, with school
division cooperation, to keep Virginia schools segregated, into
position, then a statute under which the governor

would

take over any school which voluntarily or by court order
admitted blacks, then a public placement law, and then the
State tuition laws.
Now, the public placement law, as this Court knows,
was particularly effective.

As stated in Bradley, it took

out of the hands of the school boards and school superintendent
any decision relating to the integration of the school.
And so in 1961 these black petitioners brought a class
action on behalf of all black children in Virginia against
State officials, including the Richmond School Division, to
be admitted to white schools despite the provision of the
pup11 p1acement 1aw.

7
The district court granted limited relief, but
not class relief.

The Court of Appeals reversed, directing

class relief.
The Commonwealth and the Richmond School Division
then sought to void the impact, of this decision by introducing
a Freedom of Choice plan.

This plan was accepted by the

Court of Appeals, but this Court reversed, because the plan
failed to deal with desegregation of teachers.
It was now 1966, 12 years after Brown, a consent
decree was entered into involving a Freedom of Choice plan,
placing the affirmative duty on school authorities to modify
free choice if it did not result in effective desegregation.
Unfortunately, segregation continued, but the school
officials took no action whatsoever.
For this reason, the black petitioners, on March 10,
1970, filed for further relief pursuant to this Court’s
ruling in Green.

On that date, even though the composite

racial makeup of the three divisions had not altered, which,
you'll recall, I said 33,7 percent black and 66.3 percent
white; the makeup in Virginia had become 64.2 percent black
and 35.8 percent white.

While Chesterfield had become 9.5

percent black, 90 percent white; and Henrico, 3.1 percent
black and 91.9 percent white.
Now, at that point, this is 1970 now, just two and
a half years ago, the Richmond School Board admitted that it

8

had been and it was in violation of petitioners' constitutional
rights.

The schools were 3till rigidly segregated.

And I

would ask the Court to please turn to pages 167 and 168 of the
Appendix to the Petition for Certiorari.
QUESTION:

What pages, again?

MR. COLEMAN;

167a, Mr. Justice Brennan, and 168a,

And just look at the situation.

And this is 1970,

Of the seven high schools, three were 100 percent black, one was
99,26 percent white.

In other words, six of the seven schools,

by any test you could make, were clearly racially identifiable.
The middle schools, six of the seven were clearly
racially identifiable.
The elementary schools, almost all of them were
clearly racially identifiable.
The faculty and staff were clearly racially
identifiable.
Now, I am confident — now, this is 16 years after
Brown — I am confident that no one can stand up before the
bar of this Court and question the correctness of the district
court's resulting finding at pages 168a — 169a, pardon me,
where the court says that the schools were racially segregated,
racially identifiable, and violative o* petitioners*
constitutional rights.
Now, frankly, *;e find it impossible to characterize
such contemporary facts as, quote, "history" or "original sin",

9

as respondents do at pages 47 and 73 of their brief.
At that point, the district court's job was an
attempt to see that the School Board would produce a plan
which would effectively desegregate the public schools.
The Richmond School Board continued to file
inadequate interim plans, which x^ere approved only because of
time pressure, and the schools would have to open at the time.
In eeich case, the court specifically found that these interim
plans did not conform to constitutional requirements.
Then, on November 4, 1970, the Richmond School Board,
stating under oath that it was impossible to desegregate the
schools in the context of Richmond only, moved to join the
adjacent divisions of Henrico and Chesterfield Counties,
The State Board of Education and the State Superintendent of
Public Instruction.
And at that time the black petitioners filed a
second amended complaint, which again asked for relief on
behalf of all children throughout Virginia.

They asked that

the adjoining school divisions be included in a desegregation
plan either by consolidation or by contractual arrangements.
Now, after trial, and I wish the Court would follow
me through these findings, I really think that this case,
unless you can upset these findings, that this case has to be
decided in favor of the black petitioners.

That at trial,

after trial, a full trial now, the district court found —

10

QUESTION;

That complaint was filed whan — '71?

MR. COLEMAN:
QUESTION:

This was filed in 1970, Your Honor.

1970 still?

MR. COLEMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Yes, in 1970.

And is that done in response to an

implicit invitation by the district court?
MR. COLEMAN:
QUESTION:

No, sir.

It’s not.

MR. COLEMAN:

No, sir.

That was not done.

What

happened was, Your Honor, that they were trying to come up
with an effective plan.

In the course of that, Mr. Little,

who is of the Richmond School Division, said that the only way
you could have a plan would be that you involve the other
counties.

At that point, the judge, in a letter which appears

I think on about page 150a of the Appendix to the Petition,
indicated there are a lot of problems here and we would want
the lawyers to cooperate.
Then the School Board filed the motion and the —
it’s attached to the —* there's an order in which there's a
motion to recuse the judge, and it's attached to that order,
Your Honor.

It's 58, 58a is the order —*

QUESTION:

58a of what?

MR, COLEMAN;
Your Honor.

Of the Appendix to the Petition,

It's page 81»

If you read the letter, sir, and

once you read that letter, I am confident that you will not

11
conclude that that was an invitation on the part of anybody
to fils a claim.
In other words, the findings were that, one, the
pupil assignment patterns in the three —
QUESTION;

Now, was this a formal finding, Mr.

Coleman?
MR. COLEMAN;
QUESTION;

Yes, sir.

At what page?

MR. COLEMAN;

Well,as I go through, I will give them

to you.
QUESTION; All right.
MR. COLEMAN;

One, that the pupil assignment

patterns in the three school divisions showed great disparity
in 1971 racial composition, making both individual school
facilities and the entire three systems racially identifiable.
He said that the Richmond system is identifiable
as black, and that of each county is perceived as a white
system.

That’s on page 201a to 208a.
That a great number of one-race schools had

recently existed and, I repeat, some still exist.

That’s

at page 186a, 201a.
He also found that at the time Chesterfield and
Henrico were joined, and at the close of the record, each
was operating a non-unitary school system in violation of the
Constitution; and that's at page 524a of the record, 526a of

12
the record with respect to Chesterfield, and page 527a of
the record and 529a of the record with respect to Henrico.
It further found that past and continued action by
State authorities interfering with desegregation, that a
constitutional plan for the city and for the counties as well
cannot be achieved within current school division boundaries.
That finding is at 237a, 207a, and 201a.
He concluded that the defendant should not be
permitted to profit by self-created problems, and that’s at
page 237a.
Finally, he found that at the time the record closed,
each division still operated a school system which was, in
some respect, non-unitary.
The court never found, as respondents would have you
believe by page 8 of their brief, that any one of the three
divisions had ever achieved a unitary status.

And I ask

you to look at the chart in the Appendix to the Court
Opinion, which shows that each division operates racially
identifiable schools.

And the chart is in Volume II,

beginning on page 524, where he takes the schools of
Chesterfield County, then Henrico County, and Richmond,
And I assure you, when you will examine those, you will
find that in each instance in this record every one of these
schools were racially identifiable.
The other thing I want to make —

13

QUESTION!
MR. COLEMAN:

In mine I find no page 524.
It's the — it's attached, Your Honor,

to the Appendix to the Petition for Certiorari.
chart, it is 524f Your Honor.

It’s a

The white book.

And with respect to Chesterfield County,any test
you will apply, you would have to say three out of those six
schools are identifiable as x^hifce.
Nov;, another thing which I’d like to clear up in
this case, the judge never found, and we don’t urge, that
the absence of a quota gives rise to a constitutional
violation.

And I would just ask you to read page 519a of

the record, once again in the same opinion -— I mean the
same, it’s the opinion, but it's in the Appendix.
Now, once he found these massive constitutional
violations, he had a constitutional duty to end them.

And

in Charlotte, the Swann case, in Davis, this Court has said
that once there’s a violation, the court should take all
steps necessary to end that violation and to end the effects
of it.
Now, the only reason, and the only thing that makes
this case any different from Davis and Swann is something
that my friends try to raise, namely, this division line.
And I stand here and say once again that in order to maintain
segregated schools, this line was never observed.
freely were taken back and forth across this line.

Students

14
You will find from this record now, for example,
that the Kennedy School, which is under the Richmond Division,
is actually situated in Kenrico County, and black children —
Kennedy is now about SO percent black»

And if you look at

page 8 of our brief, we set out a table for youj on page 8»
And here you have a situation where Kennedy High
School, built in 1967, opened as a black school»
80 percent black.

Now, over

In fact, it's 93 percent black as of now.

That within four miles of that school is Henrico High School,
which is four percent black.
Now, that's the problem that the district judge
had here.

He looked at this map and he saw that you had an

array in the Richmond School Division of black schools,
measured by any test that you want to measure.
Right on top of them, outside in these counties,
there were white schools.

Now, certainly, in Swann, what you

did was to approve a plan which said that you should desegre­
gate the schools and that you send students by contiguous
zones, by busing, to these various places.
Now, here the only reason is this line.

Now, I

assure you, the record will show and will repeatedly show,
this line is an arbitrary line, it was never used to

■— when

there v/ere segregated schools.
The judge found, at page 193a of the record, in
his opinion, also in the record, this record now, sir, at page

15
912, there's testimony that under the State Tuition law when
a black child would get the right to go to school in Richmond,
and then if the white parent didn't like it, he, under the
State Tuition law, as you know, Mr. Justice White, could opt
out and go some place else; that the State paid the tuition
and the white child went out of the county.

That’s on 912a

of the record.
QUESTION;

Mr. Coleman, as I understand it, the

busing issue was a separate matter and is not involved in
this case.
MR. COLEMAN:

Well, Footnote 2 of the Court of

Appeals opinion says this is not a busing case.

The record's

clear here that the amount of busing involved here is less
than it was —
QUESTION: Well, the question of busing is not in
this case, is that right or not?
MR. COLEMAN:

That's correct.

QUESTION: And that whether there's too much or
too little, or whether there's any at all or not is irrelevant
in this case.
MR. COLEMAN:

Irrelevant; irrelevant.

The sole issue here, Your Honor, is that when a
judge finds as a fact that these lines have been repeatedly
ignored in the cause of segregation, can you — do they then
become an iron curtain when you attempt to integrate the

16

school, particularly when there's a finding of fact by the
judge, not upset by the Court of Appeals, which says that it's
impossible to do it within the context of Richmond only.
QUESTION:

Mr. Coleman, —

MR. COLEMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir?

— you referred to 193a,

Judge Merhige’s

opinion about prior practice of crossing these lines.

Does

he mean there that that crossing had taken place in other
counties in Virginia outside the Richmond metropolitan area?
Or does he mean that pupils were exchanged previously between
Henrico and Chesterfield and Richmond?
MR. COLEMAN:
QUESTION:

He means both.

So there were actual pupil exchanges?

MR, COLEMAN:

Yes, there were actual pupils in these

three counties, and, in addition, there were cases in other
counties where there were regional black schools.

And,

incidentally, Mr. Justice Brennan, you ought to remember from
the Green case, that they actually bused Indians across the
line, too, at one particular time.
QUESTION:

Well, what was the nature of the exchange

between Henrico and Richmond or Chesterfield and Richmond?
MR. COLEMAN:

Well, the nature was that under the

Pupil Placement law, when a black person would apply to go to
school in Richmond, the white family then had the right to
send his child to some other school.

He would then make an

17
application to go to school in Henrico or go to school in
Chesterfield, and they would have to take him.
In fact, the testimony says that if, for some reason,
Richmond woxxld stand up and say, No, you can’t do that, the
State would get back at them by just deducting from the next
State grant check the amount of the tuition.

And so the

testimony says, We couldn’t do anything about it; this was
State-directed, we had to do it.
And the fact is that these children were going across
these lines all during that time.

And that’s what the judge

found.
In addition, now in these counties there are special
schools, like science schools in one county, the children go
across that line and nobody gets upset.

And it’s only when

it comes to desegregating the schools that this line, all of
a sudden, becomes the most sacrosanct thing in the world.
And we just don’t think that under your cases that
that is so.

And we also cite a lot of cases in the district

court, on page 78 of our brief, and I think it's Footnote 121,
where the Court of Appeals and the district courts have
repeatedly ordered that there be an interchange of students,
if that was the only way.
And, Mr, Justice White, what I’m trying to say,
when you have a line which is just ridiculous, never used,
then, under those circumstances you can’t say that that becomes

18

an absolute bar.

And this case is just that simple.

Now, as I said before, that I think that the real
issue here is one of whether the discretion was properly
exercised, and in my opening I indicated to you the reason
why I thought it was properly exercised.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGEF:

Thank you, Mr. Coleman.

Mr. Little.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE B. LITTLE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE SCHOOL BOARD, et al.
MR. LITTLE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I believe the marshal is bringing an exhibit in,
would you prefer that I —
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

No, you may proceed

unless you need it at the outset.
MR. LITTLE:

All right, sir.

No, sir.

As Mr. Coleman stated, the Richmond School Board,
an arm of the State of Virginia, conceded that its schools
were not being operated in accordance with constitutional
requirements.
In addition, this bi-raciai board, consisting of
four whites and three blacks, is unanimous in its belief that
there can be nc elimination of black and white schools,
absent assignment of pupils across existing lines.

19

I would like to capsule four aspects of this case
underlying this position.

A brief word on the constitutional

violation, discussion of the precise issue, a more detailed
review of the evidence which shows the lack of sanctity in
these school division lines, and, finally, key aspects of the
particular relief decreed.
Coming to the constitutional violation, the mere
fact that a dual school system was still flourishing in
Richmond 16 years after Brown provides the nexus for the
relief decree.
The only question confronting the district court
from the first day of the reopening of this protracted
litigation was how to remedy this persistent and deliberately
deferred perpetuation of a dual school system.
remedy case.

This is a

We don't have to search for a constitutional

violation.
This search for an effective remedy provides the
lens through which all of the evidence and all of the actions
of the d-istrict court must be viewed.

The precise issue is a

rather narrow one.
Did the district court abuse its discretion in
approving a Richmond School Board desegregation plan which
involved assignments of pupils across these lines?
This concept of interdivisional assignments
constituted the essential ingredient in both of the alternative

20

forms of relief sought.

Consolidation was not the only

relief sought.
The first was a contractual .interchange between the
existing school divisions, fully authorized by State law.
The second was a consolidation of these school
divisions in accordance with the provisions of State law.
Our position is that the action of the lower court
was dictated, on this record, by a sound application of the
all too familiar remedial guidelines previously established
by this Court.
Under these decisions, there's only one test, that's
effectiveness.

Effectiveness is the key.

No one can stand

before the bar of this Court and argue that the Richmond
School Board plan is not obviously more effective than the
present plans in operation in Richmond or Henrico or
Chesterfield.
The respondents and the government have studiously
avoided any discussion of effectiveness which, as we understand
it, is the heart of Brown, Green, Swann, Davis, and other
decisions of this Court.
The district court — let me go back.

What we

analyze the position of the respondents to be, and the
government apparently, is that notwithstanding these guidelines
which are so clear and explicit, regardless of consequences,
regardless of the feasibility of the means to overcome these

21
lines, regardless of the past treatment of these lines by the
State of Virginia, these lines impose a geographical limita~
tion on. the powers of a chancellor seeking to remedy an
admitted constitutional violation.
The district court very carefully considered the
importance which State authorities and local authorities had.
attached to these lines.

He concluded that there was no

overriding State interest in either restricting the assignment
of pupils to the political subdivision in which they reside
or in requiring each political subdivision to operate its
own school system.
He also concluded, from a review of all of the facts,
that these lines did constitute barriers to any effective
relief for these plaintiffs.
Now, what evidence supports these findings?
It falls into three areas.

First, we don’t have to

look far, we simply only have to go to the Code of Virginia,
the State laws.

We next can go to the expressed policies

of the State Board of Education, the father
in Virginia.

we're a child

The power over schools is in the State.

is a State violation,

This

Richmond did not, of its own initiative,

set up a dual school system.
We can go to the established policies of the Board.
And, finally, we can go to the history of past practices.
Let’s come to the laws.

Our Code expressly, for

22

many years, has set out a framework for the operation of a
school division consisting of two or more separate and
distinct political subdivisions.

Our State law, for years,

and we have all used it, has expressly provided for the
operation of joint schools for any educational need.
Our State law, and we have all engaged in it

not

all, but many divisions have — specifically provides for the
contractual interchange of pupils between separate political
subdivisions.
These, the very existence of these laws totally
belies any overriding State interest in restricting the
assignment of pupils to the political subdivision in which
they live.

But they even do something else under the

remedial guidelines of this Court, a fair interpretation of it,
they suggested alternatives which a district court, in the
performance of his duty to end segregation and its effects,
had to consider.
Let's come to State Board policies.

The State Board

of Education has encouraged consolidations of separate political
subdivisions into one school division for almost thirty
years.
In 1944, it approved and accepted in principle a
plan which had as its objective the reduction of the number
of school divisions then in existence in Virginia.

At that

time we had 110, and for the most part each represented a

23
separate political subdivision*

This plan, which was endorsed

by our own State Board of Education, had as its objective the
reduction of the number of school divisions from 110 to 40 or
50, which would have necessarily involved combining the
separate political subdivisions into a single school division.
As recently as 1969, again in a statement expressing
the desire, the State Board stated that consolidation be
considered for educational needs, expressly stated that,
quote, "Political boundary lines do not necessarily conform
to educational needs."
This is not what the plaintiffs in this case have
said; this is what our own State Board of Education has
recognized.
QUESTION:

Where do we put our finger on that in

the record —
MR. LITTLE:
QUESTION:

Pardon me, sir?
Where do we put our finger on that in

the Appendix here?
MR. LITTLE:

This is on Richmond School Board

Exhibit 82, it's in the Exhibit A-ppendix, on page 63 and 64.
In the second paragraph, the last two sentences:

"The State

Board, therefore, has favored in principle the consolidation
of school divisions with the view to creating administrative
units appropriate to modern educational needs."
QUESTION:

I don't believe I have the right one.

MR. LITTLE:

I beg your pardon, sir, this is the

Exhibit Appendix.

MR. LITTLE:

The white one?

No.

This is the thin brown Appendix.

school divisions with the view to creating administrative units
appropriate to modern educational needs.

The Board regrets

the trend to the contrary, pursuant to which some counties
and newly formed cities have sought separate divisional
status based on political boundary lines which do not
necessarily conform to educational needs."
Not only the State Board but this record contains
testimony from some of the more outstanding educational
experts in the country, which agree with the State Board,
that political boundary lines are of no significance in the
area of education.
Now, so much for the State Board policies.

Let me

pass on — excuse me.
QUESTION:

How many school divisions are there now

in Virginia?
MR. LITTLE:

Approximately 130,

QUESTION: And you said there were how many in —
MR. LITTLE:
QUESTION:
MR.LITTLE:

110,
— 1944?
Right.

So more towns have attained

status, such as this Court saw in Emporia.

That is the reason

for the increase.
The objectives of that plan were never carried out,
but I am urging it to show v?hat the policy of the State Board
has been.
Let's come to the past practices of these, with
respect to these lines.
The district court quite properly found that the
State officials and the local officials had historically
used principles of consolidation and interdivisional
assignment of pupils in the establishment and maintenance
of regional schools for blacks, joint schools for blacks,
and joint schools for other educational needs*
These regional schools for blacks consisted of as
many as four separate political subdivisions encompassing an
area as large as 1700 square miles, requiring the children
to spend the night at these schools because of the extreme
travel distances involved.
These schools operated in Virginia, and the last
one did not close, as this Court might have anticipated, in
1955, it closed in 196S.

26

There is not a scintilla of evidence in this record
that any finance problems arose as a result of one regional
school being supported by four, as many as four or five
separate political subdivisions.
Now, what about the use of interdivisional assignments
There’s a statute on our books, it’s still on the
books, Section 22-115, found in our brief but also in the
Petition Appendix at 194, which, in 1960, the State declared
it a matter of public policy of the State to encourage students
to participate in programs which would require them to attend
schools in political subdivisions other than the one in which
they reside.
More significantly, in order to perpetuate
segregation, not pre-Brown, but after Brown, in the Fifties,
the last Sixties, thousands of blacks were involuntarily
shoved across these so-called sacred lines for the sole purpose
of perpetuating segregation in defiance of this Court and
in defiance of the affirmative duty on school authorities to
end discrimination.
Now, is this all history?

What's happening today?

Let’s come to Richmond, if we can.
Mr. Coleman mentioned Kennedy High School.

This

black line, irregularly shaped, is the city limit of Richmond
[indicating on map].
The only schools shown on the map are those within

27
one to three miles of that line.

This one school might be a

little more than three miles.
Kennedy High School ~~ the blades in Richmond
historically and today live in the eastern portion of the
city, the south-central portion.
the city [indicating] .

This is the black part of

The .lily-white area is in the western

part, and part of the southern.
Kennedy High School, right here, is a Richmond school
opened in 1967, it is located entirely in Henrico County.
It opened as an all-black school.

And every cay since it has

opened 1500 children cross this so-called iron curtain,
attend Kennedy, leave that school and cross that line again
to go home.
QUESTION:

Do any students living in Henrico go to

Kennedy?
MR, LITTLE:

Not that we know of, sir.

We did

discover in one of the schools that an Henrico child, by
giving a false address, had enrolled, I'm not sure it was at
Kennedy, but it was in Armstrong High School.
On Fairfield Court is another Richmond school, an
elementary school, a historically black school.
partly in the county and partly in the city.
about 560 students.

That lies

It enrolls

Each day of their lives they cross the

line to go to school; they probably cross the line several
times during the day that they're in the school because the

28

line goes right through the school building.
So far as crossing lines in the past, as recently as
'69 Henrico was operating this school right up here in the
extreme northern portion of the county *

They who claim to be

lovers of neighborhood schools have a neighborhood school for
this school consisting of the entire Henrico County.

Students

from the easternmost portion of Henrico, to get to that school,
had to go into the city, across this great line, through the
city, outside the line again, up here.

That's how sacred the

lines were,
2Vt the present time, Henrico, Richmond, Chesterfield,
we operate joint schools for educational needs.

The location

of the Math Science Center, referred to by Mr, Coleman, is
right here, School 408 — I beg your pardon, this school
right here.
In 1970-71, approximately, it varies within 1,000 or
1500, approximately 10,000 students from Henrico attended some
courses there, 10,000 from Chesterfield, 10,000 from Richmond.
So that's what significance the line has for us in Richmond
today.
I submit the Richmond School Board, in light of its
ignoring these lines in the past for educational purposes
could not stand up here, if it so desired, and interpose this
line as a shield to effective relief.
I think that on the basis of the State laws, the

29
State Board policies, of the past treatment of these lines,
what else could a chancellor conclude?

That he was entitled

to use, certainly, at the very least, the same means that were
used to violate the Constitution.

I fail to see where that

is a drastic decision on the part of a person seeking to
remedy the constitutional violation.
One other thing on the map I would point out.

The

Henrico offices are located right at the heart of the city.
The building permit for Kennedy School was issued by Henrico
County.
QUESTION:
annexed?

Which part of the city was really

The part involved in the whole litigation?
MR. LITTLE: Right.
QUESTION:
MR. LITTLE:
QUESTION:
MR. LITTLE:

Right out

here.

And that was taken from —
Chesterfield.
— Chesterfield County?
That's right.

This is the James River, this line right through
here, embraces it.
Henrico envelops the city north of the river.
Chesterfield envelops the city south of the river.

Like a

butterfly, as one witness testified.
QUESTION: When an annexation takes place, is the
school district boundary automatically changed with it?
MR. LITTLE:

Automatically changed, yes, sir.

We —

30

that boundary has shifted some 14 times, by virtue of
annexations.
May I come to some of the key aspects of the relief
decree.
I think it highly significant, the judge’s order
of January the 10th, from which this appeal is taken, simply
requires these school authorities to exercise powers which
they presently possess under State law; namely, to consolidate
these schools.
Secondly, I would like to observe this:

we are not

saying that the particular plan, even though the district
court found it to be reasonable, feasible, workable,
educationally sound, we don’t stand here saying it's the only
plan to effectively desegregate these schools.
QUESTION:

Mr. Little, what's the formality by which

a consolidation is effected?
MR* LITTLE:

All it requires is the consent of the

State Board of Education, and I would refer the Court to the
detailed framework set out — first, it's Section 22-30 of the
Code, found in the Petition Appendix on page 617; then there's
a long series of statutes saying how you bring it about, how
you create the Board, how the representation is determined,
how the finances, both for capital outlay and operating funds,
are handled.
There's a detailed framework set out in State law,

31

all it requires is a request, the State Board has to approve
the request, and the counties have to consent to it.

But

once the consent is there, the machinery is already in our
law to set it up.
But coming back to the plan, the only reason it was
the only plan before the court was that, despite invitations
from the court and from the Richmond School Board, none of
the respondents would participate in the preparation of a plan,
even assuming this relief were appropriate.
The lower court, in its order of January the 10th,
expressly provided and gave them an abiding opportunity to
come in and make amendments to the plan, modify the plan,
even at this date, or if they come up with a better plan,
so long as it eliminates segregation in its effects, there
will be no problem.
Now, one other point on the plan.

There is no

more racial balance created under this plan than in the plan
approved by this Court in Swann v. Mecklenburg.

Under the

plan in Swarm, the variance in black composition ranged from
8 percent to 38.

Under the Richmond School Board plan here,

it ranges from 17 percent to 41 percent black.
It's true that every school ends up majority white,
just like it did in Swann v. Mecklenburg, simply because of
the historically stable racial composition which hasn't varied
one-tenth of one percent in a decade in Richmond, in the

32
Richmond metropolitan area, of two-thirds white, one-third
black.
■>

This Court, in McDaniel vs. Bressey, by approving
that plan for Clarke County, certainly approved a plan which
does a lot more toward racial balance than either this plan
contemplates or results in or was done in Swann.
Furthermore, I call the Court's attention to the
caveat of the district court, found in the white Petition
Appendix, Volume II, page 519-20, where the court itself said,
ywhereas the racial composition is educationally sound, there's
no constitutional requirement for it, it's not to be deemd
inflexible, rate or variations might be unavoidable, and
giving them the opportunity to make amendments.
In concluding, then, may it please the Cdurt, on
this record the acceptance of interdivisional assignments is
certainly too broad a remedial device.
limitations, namely, time and distance.

It has inherent
The only time where

interdivisional assignments would be an appropriate remedial
tool would be where, as here, the transportation times and
distances are remarkably comparable to what is presently
being carried out in each of the separate divisions.
In conclusion, I think the bald truth is shown by
this map-

We have 67, 68, 60 percent black schools right

now in Richmond.

This is based on '71-72 figures.

Look what's right next door, seven-tenths of one

33

percent black, three-tenths of one percent black, zero
percent blackj and the greatest percentage of black in any
of the schools shown here is five percent.
That’s our problem.

And if this Court affirms the

Fourth Circuit, you have historic reality of black and white
schools in the face of a feasible alternative for eliminating
it.
And, finally, if it affirms the Fourth Circuit, I
think it’s all too clear from a practical standpoint that the
promises of Brown will be rendered illusory for every black
child in the City of Richmond.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Thank you, Mr. Little.
Mr. Kurland.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PHILIP 3. KURLAND, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. KURLAND:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
We respectfully submit that the question in this
case is not whether the Richmond School System is desegregated.
It is.

There are no children included or excluded from any

Richmond school on the basis of race.
The question in this case is not whether the Richmond
School System is unitary.

It is.

There is no school in the

Richmond School System that is racially identifiable as white
or black; they are just schools in Richmond.

34

The question in this case is whether the Constitution
requires that a desegregated, unitary city school system,
which has a substantial black majority, be consolidated with
two other independent, desegregated, unitary county school
systems in order to assure a white student majority in the
city schools.
The fundamental facts here are just three.
The Richmond School System has a substantial black
majority.

The county school systems have a substantial white

majority.

And the district court plan, and that is what is

in question here, the plan entered by the district court in
this case is under review here; the district court plan in
question would create a single consolidated system so that
students will attend schools with substantial white majorities.
The issues here, then, are whether a ratio of seven
black students to three white students in the unitary school
system is constitutionally forbidden; whether a ratio of seven
white students to three black students is constitutionally
compelled.
With the Court's permission, X shall address myself
first to some of the facts, second,to the applicable precedents,
and third, to the question of the existence of a constitutional
violation, and, finally, to the problem of a remedy.
This action was not one initiated against the
Counties of Henrico or Chesterfield to desegregate their school

35
systems, because those school systems are, and were before
they were brought into this case, desegregated and unitary.
QUESTION:

But there seems to be some question

about that, doesn’t there?
MR. KURLAND:
QUESTION:

I —-

By definition, Your Honor, —

You’ve said that now three or four times,

that all three of these systems are desegregated and unitary,
and were long

before this order was entered.

MR, KURLAND:

Before this order was entered.

That’s right, sir.
QUESTION:

I gather that there is some disagreement,

just as a matter of fact, at least, at the factual level
between you and your brothers on the other side.
MR. KURLAND:
QUESTION:

Well, I don't think —

Is there not?

MR. KURLAND:

I don’t think there’s disagreement

as to fact, if I may say so, Mr. Justice.
QUESTION:

Well, I'd like to know about that.

MR. KURLAND:

There’s disagreement as to conclusion.

There is nothing to suggest that the distribution of students,
in any of these three systems, is race by race.

There is

nothing to suggest that any of the schools in each of these
three school systems is identifiable by race.

And that is

what this Court has said is a unitary, desegregated school
system.

36

QUESTION: Well, Judge Merhige, in his very long
opinion, — and I grant you, it wasn't explicitly clear •—
but I drew from what he said that in his view neither one of
these systems was unitary and desegregated, that each one of
them -MR. KURLAND:
QUESTION:

The only —

— showed vestiges of an officially

segregated system at the time this decree was entered.
MR, KURLAND:
QUESTION:

The only factual —

Am I wrong about that?

MR. KURLAND:

No, sir.

Well, the only factual

basis on which Judge Merhige could reach his conclusion was
that the percentage, the ratio of whites in the county schools
was different from the ratio of whites and blacks in the city
schools.

The problem that Mr. Little was talking about.
There was, in one of the counties, a laboratory

school attached to a —
QUESTION: A State university.
MR. KURLAND:

That’s right.

— which the HEW asked

be desegregated, and it was separated from the system. There
was a school in one of the counties which, over a period of
time, had turned from white to black as a neighborhood school,
and that was changed.
Those are the two on which any notion, aside from
this ratio proposition, which any notion that the county

37
schools were not desegregated could be based.
QUESTION:

When you use the term "racially

identifiable school", precisely what do you mean?

Taking

Richmond.
MR. KURLAND:

What I mean is that within the city

there is no — let me change it.

In accordance with this

Court's mandate, the distribution of blacks and whites within
these schools in Richmond is such that none can said to be
assigned or identifiable as black and others as white.
Every one of the schools conies within 50 percent of the total
Richmond ratio.
QUESTION: What would you say, Mr. Kurland, if the
State Legislature suddenly consolidated these three counties
for purposes of operating schools, say these three school
districts were consolidated suddenly?
MR. KURLAND:

What would I say to that?

QUESTION: With respect to a suit which charged that
there was not a unitary school system?
MR. KURLAND:

If this were one system, the

distribution of students would not be satisfying the mandate
of this Court.
Our proposition is that it is not one system —
QUESTION: Right.
MR. KURLAND:

— and the power of the State

Legislature to effect such a change certainly exists.

38

QUESTIONs Right.
MR. KURLAND:

We submit the power of this Court

does not reduce that.
QUESTION:

Right, and that is the issue.

QUESTION:

Mr. Kurland, in the Richmond area, I

don’t see any gray spot there.
MR. KURLAND: Any what, sir?
QUESTION:'Gray, according to the chart there.

And

you have a unitary system, but not one single gray there.
MR. KURLAND:

You mean 20 to 39 percent?

The

distribution in Richmond, Your Honor, —
QUESTION:

Well, is that map correct?

MR. KURLAND:
correct.

I cannot tell you whether it is

I can tall you by looking at the exhibit, on page

155e of our Exhibit Appendix, you will see the distribution
of schools in Richmond.

There are

There are nine with 80 percent black

And the other fifty are under 80 percent black

population.
There are five majority white schools, Belleraeade
has S3 percent, Webster Davis has 56 percent; there are others,
54, 60, and 57 percent,
QUESTION: And that’s a unitary system?
MR. KURLAND:

To the extent — if it is not, Your

39

Honor,, if the, distribution of whites and blacks within
Richmond is not proper, then the order of the district court
should be directed to Richmond to improve that distribution.
QUESTION;

I suppose if you did have a gray spot

within — a so-called gray school, that is zero to 19.9 percent
white —■ within Richmond, that would be evidence of a
segregated system, would it not?
MR. KURLAND:

That's right, sir.

You would have

an attempt to single out a school as a white school.
QUESTION: Well, I don’t care whether you look at
it one way or the other, but as I look at it, practically
all the gray ones are outside and all of the black ones
are inside, by sheer accident.
MR. KURLAND:

It’s not accident, Your Honor.

It’s

the demographic distribution of population between the
poor city, not only here but in every city in the United
States.
QUESTION:

Well, how many of the findings of Judge

Merhige were upset by the Court of Appeals?
MR. KURLAND:

The Court found that there was no

nexus between the alleged wrongdoing in the past and the
demographic distribution between the comities and the city
here, which is —
QUESTION: Well, I — excuse me, sir.
MR. KURLAND:

— which is the essence of the finding

40
of inadequacy of the trial court opinion.

The trial court

opinion, Your Honor, —
QUESTION:

Well, in the granting — they disagreed

with the opinion, but did they do anything with the findings?
MR. KURLAND: They found that the findings did not
support the basis for the remedy. The findings, Your Honor,
are in terns of what we must concede are egregious areas
in violation of constitutional provisions in the past.
This case came, this issue came in 1970, after, if
1 may say so, there had been a great change.

This school

system, all three school systems were already under order,
were already desegregated and unitary.

And what the Court of

Appeals found, Your Honor, was that there was an absence of
a nexus, that what had been done in the past, which we concede
and abominate, is not a cause of the distribution, this
population distribution which you have here.
As I say, this case originated as an action to de­
segregate the Richmond School System.

The respondents were

not made parties to the action until after the Richmond
School System came under a decree to desegregate in
accordance with this Court1s mandate in Green v. School Board
of New Kent County.
It was only after the district court decreed and
effected a unitary plan for Richmond that Richmond proposed,
the plaintiffs embraced, and the trial court adopted.

41
Consolidation Plan which called on the respondent counties
to provide students to the Richmond School System to assure
a substantial white majority in every Richmond school.
The Consolidation Plan approved by the trial
court, which is the plan under review here, would assure that
no school in the consolidated system would have a student body
of less than 60 percent or more than 80 percent white.

This

plan has no function or effect other than to assure this
specific racial balance which petitioners’ experts have
labeled a, quote, "viable racial mix”.
Each of the three school systems here is already a
large, well-functioning school system.

Each had approximately

the same wealth and tax base per pupil for educational
financing.

Except that Richmond reported a slightly larger

wealth and tax base than either of the two counties.
Each was an integral part of its respective county
or city government, and has been so since the origin of public
education in Virginia,for over a century.
The geographic division of the counties and the city,
which have always been the geographic divisions of the school
systems, have existed since before the founding of the
Republic, except for annexations in the county by the city.
In order to attain a viable racial mix, the trial
court ordered segregated busing of about 70 percent of the
combined systems, with busloads of black school children being

42

exported to Henrico and Chesterfield schools, and busloads of
white children being imported to Richmond schools.
QUESTION;

I thought the busing issue was not in

this case,
MR. KURLAND5

The busing issue, sir, is our — we've

never made a contention that busing is not an appropriate means
of effecting a unitary system.

We do suggest that there are

difficulties with this as a remedy, because of the nature
that the busing takes here.

That is, the segregated nature

of the busing.
In determining whether —
QUESTION: But you are — am I to understand that
you are arguing that a separate ground for sustaining the
Court of Appeals decision is that there is a —
MR. KURLAND:
QUESTION;

No, Your Honor, what we are —

— that it relates to busing?

MR. KURLAND:

What we have said, Your Honor, is that

busing is a perfectly appropriate tool, subject to the
limitations expressed

by this Court in Swann, to effectuate

a desegregation of a school system.
But we say, though, that when you measure the
remedy that has been offered, the form that this busing takes
is a fact that the Court must take into consideration in
deciding whether or not the remedy is an appropriate one.
QUESTION:

And you're not urging as a separate reason

43

for affirming the Court of Appeals that the district court
thought that it was implementing some racial balance idea?
I mean, you’re not saying that the district court was wrong
solely for that reason?
MR. KURLANDz

Vie are saying that the court was

wrong because that was the function and effect of the plan,
yes, sir; yes, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Yes, but the issue that is here is

whether or not —
MR. KURLAND:
QUESTION:

This plan.

Yes, the issue here is the plan, but the

issue as to whether — is whether or not the Court of Appeals
was right in saying that the district court could not cross
these school boundaries?
MR. KURLAND:

That's the — the basic issue is the

one I stated, whether it can cross the school boundaries for
the purpose of effectuating a viable racial mix.
If the Court looks at the record, created by the
City of Richmond and the plaintiffs, at the trial level, —
QUESTION: But I thought you said a while ago that
if this, if all these three districts xvere together, the
distribution of blacks and whites wuld not be acceptable?
MR. KURLAND: That’s right.

You would not have a —

you would have a total system within the three units which
would have whites, identifiable white schools and identifiable

44
black schools.
QUESTION: Well, if the three schools districts were
together and were one system, would you be here attacking
this plan?
MR. KURLAND;
plan, Your Honor.

Yes, I would be here attacking this

For the reason that this was not an attempt

to desegregate or create a unitary system, but to effectuate
a specific thesis, which is that in order to have a proper
school system you need a ratio of between 60 and 80 percent
white, and no more than 40 or less, to 25
QUESTION:

That was one of the questions that is

presented in the -petition for certiorari, but you are urging
it as a respondent, is that it?
MR, KURLAND; That's right.

It is in our response

to the petition for certiorari.
It's quite true that the petitioners have run away
from the factual record on which this case and the judgment
was based.
As I say, the plan ordered the separation of the
school systems from their county and city tax basesy it
ordered the abolition of the county and city school boards,
and their replacement by a court-created school board, with
the consequent dilution of the control of local education by
local parents; it ordered the replacement of an already large,
fully equipped school system, or three already large, fully

45
equipped school systems by a single school system, so large
as to be in the top .2 percent of American school systems.
And it. did this, and this is my point, it did this
all solely for the effect of assuring^white majority in the
h
classrooms of Richmond.
The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held
that this restructuring of local government for this purpose
was beyond the power of the federal courts.

We respectfully

s ubmit that the judgment below should be affirmed by this
Court.
The case for the respondents rests on three
propositions established by this Court in four of its most
recent rulings on the subject of school desegregation.
All of these decisions support the conclusion of the Court
of Appeals;

the judgment of affirmance by this Court may

rest on any one of them.

All of these precedents will have

to be rejected, I submit, if the judgment of the Court of
Appeals is to be reversed.
The first of the rules established by this Court
on which respondents rely is the function of judicial school
desegregation decrees is to transform a dual system into a
unitary school system.

This was the rule established in

Green,
It should be noted that the New Kent County School
System, involved in Green, like the Richmond School System, is

46
a black majority school system adjacent to a white majority
school system, and was such at the time this Court ordered the
creation of a unitary system within New Kent County.
•The command of Green was accomplished by the trial
court in this case when it approved both the plans proffered
by the plaintiffs and by Richmond to effect.

the unitary

school system in Richmond.
Under the plans approved by the trial court, one
of which has been in effect in Richmond for the past two
school years, each of the schools in Richmond appropriately
reflects the racial composition of the school population of
the entire system.
The school system of Richmond, therefore, I submit,
is unitary in accordance with the requirement of Green.
And that is what this Court has said in recent cases, that is
what the Constitution requires.
Until the decision by the trial court below, there
had not been a single decision that went beyond the requirement
of creating a unitary school system out of a dual school system,
except where school system boundaries had been drawn with the
effect of perpetuating a dual system or preventing its
conversion.
The second rule on which respondents rely was
established by this Court in Swann v. Chariotte-Mecklenburg,
when it held that the establishment of a racial balance among

47
the schools, even within a single system, was not a
constitutional duty.

Indeed, the Court said in Swann that

the use of a racial balance other than as a starting point for
a plan to restructure a dual system was judicially improper.
And it said that once the unitary system had been established,
as is the case here, the federal court had fulfilled its
constitutional function and should go no further.
Even in the face of later demographic changes not
attributable to invidious governmental action.
In the instant case, the whole purpose and effect
of the consolidation plan is to establish a racial balance.
One need not look only at the allegations of the respondents.
The petitioners* summary of their plan, as set forth in our
brief, the petitioners' testimony in support of the plan, as
set forth in our brief, and if you will look at pages 18 to
30 of our brief you will see that a viable racial mix was
the objective of this plan.

They call it racial balance.

But here the viable racial mix was defined for the district
court as one in which there are not less than 20 percent nor
more than 40 percent black students in every school in the
system,
Wa submit that the consolidation plan accomplishes
nothing else than the effectuation of this viable racial mix.
The third case on which we rely is Wright v. City
Council of Emporia.,

In that case both the majority and the

48

minority were agreed that racial balance was not a proper
objective of the school desegregation decree.

The majority

ruled that the school system boundaries could not be redrawn
where the effect of such action would be to leave black pupils
in inferior schools and inhibit the effectuation of the unitary
system therefore ordered by the trial court.
Parenthetically it should be noted that the single
school system that the Court left in the Emporia case had a
racial balance approximately the same as that which exists
in Richmond,
It is clear, I submit, from Emporia, that it was
the invidious effect of the manipulation of school system
boundaries that permitted the trial court to enjoin the
separation of the newly created city school system from the
county system, of which it had been so long a part.
In this case there is no possibility of charging
that school system boundaries, as ancient as these, coterminus as they are with the county and city governments of
which they are a part and on which they depend, were any way
created or manipulated with the effect of preventing the
creation of a unitary system in Richmond,
But it is only when such gerrymandering has occurred
that the Court has sustained the power of the federal judiciary
to interfere with the allocation of functions of municipal
governments,

49

The point underlined by both the majority and
dissent in Emporia is the constitutional right to local
control of educational systems, except only where that,
allocation of authority was a means to preclude the
establishment of a unitary system.
The fourth of the cases — before I leave that point,
there is an incident of local control which I think is not
irrelevant and which is particularly pointed out by the
araicus brief by CORE, that not only vrifift the consolidated
remove or destroy local control of the counties and their
governments, in effect it will pollute the black influence
that has become existent in the Richmond area, where they
now have three of the seven members of the School Board.
The fourth of the cases that I submit is controlling
here is Spencer v. Kugler, where this Court affirmed the
proposition that school system boundaries that were patterned
on the boundaries of local government units, of which the
school systems here are an integral part, are not subject to
revision by a federal court in order to establish a better
racial mix among the separate and distinct school systems.
Here, as in Spencer, there is a demographic pattern
that shows a concentration of black population within certain
school systems.

Here, as in Spencer, there is no showing

that the demographic patterns are in any way a consequence of
governmental action to effectuate the separation of the races.

50

The fact is that so far as the demography of the
Richmond area is concerned, the racial pattern is similar to
that of all cities1 suburban areas in the United States,
north, south, east, and west, except that the in-migration of
blacks to the city, to Richmond, is smaller than in most other
such areas.
I submit that the decision of the Court of Appeals
under review here is consistent with and indeed required by
each of the precedents established by this Court in these
cases.
What petitioners seek here is a major departure
from this Court's precedent.

If petitioners are to succeed

here, it can only be because black majority school systems
are unconstitutional, per se, where such a school system is
adjacent to a white majority school system; although both
school systems are in compliance with the constitutional
commands of this Court.
The only alleged deficiency, the only alleged
deficiency of the Richmond system is that it has a black
majority.

The notion of the intrinsic inferiority of school

systems with black majorities, as asserted by petitioners'
expert witnesses, is, for the reasons so cogently set forth
in Judge Sobeloff's opinion in the Brunson case, basically
inconsistent with the ruling of this Court in Brown v. Board
of Education.

51
The other unwarranted innovation which petitioners
would bring about is the duty of the federal courts to
restructure local government in order to bring the different
racial mixes that exist within cities and outside cities
under a single governmental unit.
Insofar as petitioners’ claim rests on the
concentration of blacks within cities, and the concentration
*

of whites outside cities, a

nationwide phenomenon, as a
t

reason for joining the school systems, its argument is equally
valid or invalid with regard to every governmental function
performed by local government units.
The general problem of metropolitan government,
whether existing cities and. suburbs can continue to exist as
separate jurisdictions or must be combined in some metropolitan
unit, is the most complicated political, social, and economic
problem which has many aspects other than schools, but which
is not and cannot be the concern of the Judiciary in our
system of government.
I'll turn, if I may, to the question of the
existence of a constitutional violation.

As this Court

reiterated in Swann, before a federal court may intervene to
substitute its authority for that of a local government, there
must have been a constitutional violation committed by that
local government and the federal court's action must be
directed to a cure of that violation.

52
Respondents here are net guilty of any such
constitutional violation, and so 1he necessary predicate for
federal court action is lacking*
What the petitioners havi shown is only that there
is a concentration of blacks in th« urban population of the
Richmond area, a concentration of whites in the surrounding
areas? but there is and could be no showing that the
respondents are in any way responsible for bringing about that
racial distribution.
QUESTION:

But surely the petitioners have shown

more than that? they've shown as a matter of basic State
law there was officially imposed segregation in the public
schools throughout Virginia until 1954, and that thereafter
there was a history of 17 years of resistance to the
constitutional rule announced by this Court in Brown v. Board
of Education*
MR. KURLAND: That's right.
QUESTION: Throughout the State of Virginia, and
including, specifically and explicitly, these three school
districts.

Isn't that true?
MR. KURLAND: That's right, Your Honor.

two things that were not shown.

There are

It was riot shown that any

of this resulted in the demographic distribution, which is the
basis of their charge here,
QUESTION:

You mean the State-imposed segregation

53
doesn’t bring about segregated housing?
MR. KURLAND;
QUESTION:

There is nothing in this record --

Are you going that far?

MR. KURLAND;

Just what I'm saying, Your Honor,

there is nothing in this record to suggest that the housing
patterns here have developed as a result of State action.
Nothing.
QUESTION: Well, you did have State-segregated
schools?
MR. KURLAND:
QUESTION:

We did have State-segregated schools
You did have restrictive covenants?

MR. KURLAND:

No, sir, we have not — we had

restrictive covenants, but they were abolished by this Court
way back in 194- —
QUESTION: But they were there before?
MR. KURLAND:

That's right.

There is nothing in

this record which —
QUESTION: Are you going so far as to say the
State of Virginia had nothing at all to do with it?
MR. KURLAND:
QUESTION:

With this distribution of population

Yes.

MR. KURLAND:

Yes, Your Honor.

That this record

does not reveal a single factual basis —
QUESTION:

You said the record doesn't show it,

MR. KURLAND: That is what I assume the basis for -

54
QUESTION: The record does show that despite the
decision of this Court, Richmond,compelled by the State,
defied it for 17 years.
MR, KURLAND?

That is right, Your Honor.

defiance came to an end.

And that

That defiance came to an end before

this order was passed upon.
QUESTION? But not before the suit was filed.
MR, KURLAND?
Certainly not

No, sir; the suit was filed in 1954,
before then.

The immediate suit that was brought here, the basis
on which this, the amended complaint came after.

Not only

the end of defiance, but the adoption of an equal protection
provision in the Virginia Constitution, in the adoption of
an open housing law by the State of Virginia.
There is a difference, I submit, between the
State of Virginia, the Commonwealth of Virginia, as it is
today and has been for the last several years, in the period
on which the petitioners have predicated their basis for
interference with Virginia government action.
I come back to the proposition, and I repeat the
proposition, that there is nothing in this record —■ this is
not a short record, Your Honors — to suggest that the
demographic distribution, which is the basis for the request
for relief, was in any way caused by actions of the State,
or any of the respondents.

55

QUESTION; What's Judge Merhige's finding on that
precise point?
MR, KURLAND;

I don't know that I can help you,

Your Honor.
QUESTION; Well, perhaps you can come back to that
later —
MR. KURLAND;
QUESTION;

If I may.

— rather than to delay now.

MR. KURLAND:

What we have here is a situation in

which the respondents have reached that point spoken of by
this Court in Swann, that point in time when the unitary
school system has been established, and the time for the
federal courts to abstain from interference with the manage­
ment of the State school systems, unless there is a showing
of action which has an invidious effect.
QUESTION:

Mr. Kurland, —

MR, KURLAND:
QUESTION:

Excuse me, Your Honor.

— what about page 169, where

he says:

The present pattern is a reflection of the past racial
discrimination contributed in part by local, State and Federal
Government?
MR. KURLAND:
that, Your Honor.

There isn't any doubt that he said

What I’m contesting is that there is any

factual basis in the record on which to reach that conclusion,
I cannot give you record references to the absence

56
of proof.
QUESTION:

Well, you think he pulled this out of

the clear blue?
MR. KURLAND:

I don't know whether it came from the

blue, I know it did not come from the record.
I’ll turn, if I may, to the last issue.

Even

where this Court has found constitutional violations, as with
the attempted withdrawal of the Emporia schools from the
county system to perpetuate segregation, it has made clear
that the propriety of the remedy is one that is dependent on
a number of factors to be weighed,
I submit that in this case all that factors weigh
against the remedy here which is the consolidation plan.
The consolidation plan which is the subject of review by
this Court.
First, the remedy is not responsive to any
constitutional violation.
Second, the factor of timing, as it was termed in
Emporia, shows that here as there the new plan, the consolida­
tion plan, was not forthcoming from the city until after a
unitary plan had been approved and established.
Richmond here, like Emporia there, moved to take
itself out from the unitary plan that would have resulted in
majority black schools in the City of Richmond.
There is no showing here of any white flight from

57
the city schools to the county schools? to the extent that
there has been white flight from the Richmond schools has
been to somewhere else in the schools of the respondents»
And if white flight from the public schools were a result of
the desegregation of the Richmond school system, it may be
hazarded that that is not going to be abated by the consolidate
plan.
There is here no showing, as there was in Emporiaf
that there are any differences in quality or capacity between
the school systems of Richmond and the school systems of the
counties.
To the contrary, the effect of the consolidation
would be to require a school system of inordinate size, with
the consequent problems from which all oversized metropolitan
school systems suffer.
QUESTION:

What about the contention that there

were exchanges of students back and forth across these lines
in historical times?
MR, KURLANDs

There is no doubt, Your Honor, that

during the period of obstruction there were individual
students who crossed State lines»

There has never been,

in the history of the State of Virginia, a consolidation of
school systems.

The only consolidation of school systems

that exists is where a single superintendent has been
appointed as the chief administrative officer for two school

58
systems.
3ut those school

systems each maintained their

own pupil placement, their own teacher employment and, indeed,
as has been suggested, the selection of a superintendent,
although it does come with the approval of the Board, the
State Board, is usually by the local school system.
The answer to your question is yes, there was in
the past crossing of State lines in order to engage in
unconstitutional

activities.

QUESTION:

How about the Kennedy High School, they

didn’t have any trouble at the line with that?
MR. KURLAND:
trouble with the line.

I don't know what you mean by
The City of Richmond was —

QUESTION: Well, isn’t Kennedy outside of Richmond?
MR. KURLAND: Certainly, Your Honor.

The City of

Richmond has the power to place its schools.
QUESTION: Well, they didn’t have any trouble with
the county line on that, did they?
MR. KURLAND:

Nobody has any possibility of

interfering with it, as far as I understand, Your Honor,
Kennedy is placed in Henrico, of course that's what Richmond
wants.

They have the power to —
QUESTION:
MR. KURLAND:

Doesn’t the Richmond school system —
— suggest it, even now.

Any of this

area which we're talking about is possibly subject to

59

annexation by the City of Richmond.
QUESTION; Well, I understand the Richmond School
Board is in favor of this plan.
MR, KURLAND;

It’s the Richmond School Board’s

plan, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Yes,

MR. KURLAND;
bring this area in.

Yes, sir.

They’re not asking to

This plan brings in the entire two

counties to be joined with the City of Richmond.
QUESTION;

I know, but my point is I thought you

made great stress on we shouldn't cross these county lines.
MR. KURLAND;

I'm saying that we should not separate

— create new school systems, new forms of local government
in the city of, in the State of Virginia or any other State
in the Union,
QUESTION; All right.
QUESTION:

I suppose with respect to the county

high school, the Richmond School District acquired the land
•*
with its money —
MR. KURLAND:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

— and built the school?

MR. KURLAND:

Yes, sir.

Each of the schools within each of the systems is
owned by the school system that operates it,
QUESTION: Who has the police power over it?

60

MR. KURLAND:
QUESTION:

Who has the police power?

Yes.

MR. KURLAND;

You can ask the Attorney General who

has the police power over the Kennedy — the area occupied by
the Kennedy School System.
QUESTION; The City of Richmond.
MR. KURLAND;

The City of Richmond.

The fifth factor to be weighed in terms of the
desirability or appropriateness of this consolidation plan
is the construction of the local control of the school boards,
a factor that both the majority and the minority in Emporia
found of such great consequence, and the importance of which
is underscored by this Court's recent decision in the Texas
School financing case.
I would submit that if this plan were to be approved
by this Court, the resulting rule would require a reorganization of every urban and suburban school district in the
nation.

By changing their boundaries and removing their

systems from local control.

The demographic patterns

existent here, and that is the basis for the petitioners' case,
are nationwide and not local.

And if we look only at the

areas adjacent to Henrico and Chesterfield Counties, the map
in the back of our brief, you will see that if the Court
were to adopt petitioners' thesis, there could be a proper
demand on these same two counties to supply their white

61

students not only to Richmond but to the counties of Charles
City, Dinwiddie, Amelia, Goochland, and New Kent, as well
as the City of Petersburg.
We submit that such a vast overhauling of the
school systems of the nation will not have a happy result
in the maintenance of public schooling.
I’ve said, Mr. Justice White, that busing is not
an inappropriate means under the circumstances described in
Swann to the effectuation of a unitary system. It is not
irrelevant that the busing involved here is totally segregated
busing.

It has to be if what you’re doing is moving whites

into the core and blacks out of the core.
We submit that that is not likely to help solve
the conflict, the racial conflict that’s existent.
The children of Richmond, Chesterfield and Henrico
would be selected by a draft-like lottery.

The distances to

be traversed and the time to be invested are necessarily
greater than under the existing programs.
The Richmond School System covers 63 square miles?
the proposed consolidated system would cover 752 square miles,
and since busing would be to and from the City of Richmond,
distances must necessarily be great,
I submit, in short, that the proposed cure would be
far more deleterious than the alleged disease.
As this Court indicated in Emporia, it would not

62

support even an intrasystem plan where its consequences would
bs egregious.

They certainly are here.

In sum, the case presents the simple but important
question:

whether the Constitution requires that wherever

there is a demographic pattern of racial separation, school
systems must be restructured by federal courts to assure the
presence of white student majorities whereever possible.
This Court has already announced that racial
balance within the school system is an objective beyond the
scope of the federal judicial function.

A fortiori, I submit,

it is beyond the scope of federal judicial power to impose
racial balance among independent unitary school systems.
The teaching of Brown, if the Court please, and the
judgments that have been founded upon it, is not that there
must be a racial balance but rather that the races should have
equal status,
We respectfully submit that the trial court's
judgment would detract rather than add to the equality of
status.

And we pray that the judgment of the Court of Appeals

for the Fourth Circuit be affirmed.
Thank you, Your Honors.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER? Thank you, Mr, Kurland,
Mr, Solicitor General

S3
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERWIN N. GRISWOLD, ESQ.,
FOR THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING RESPONDENTS.
MR. GRISWOLD;

May it please the Court;

This case is an inevitable sequel to the decisions
in Brown I and TL.

That wa have got this far is, I think, a

sign of progress.
The only constitutional provision which is applicable
here is the clause in the Fourteenth Amendment which says
that no State shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction
the equal protection of the laws.
There is nothing in the Constitution about
education, about quality education, about racial balance, or
racial mix.
The problem in the Brown cases clearly arose because
of the maintenance of dual school systems, where children were
assigned to one school or another in the same school district
because of their race.

That was what was attacked there,

and no greater relief was there claimed.
Here there is no dual school system in Richmond
under Plan 3 now in operation.
Whether in the absence of a dual school system or
its vestiges in Richmond the Equal Protection Clause has any
application is the issue now presented here,
Before 1 proceed further, I would like to refer to

64

certain phrases which are used in the brief for the petitioners
in Mo, 72-550, sometimes taken from the opinion of the district
court below, because I believe that they are or can be
misleading or an unintentional hindrance to thought.
For example, on pages 44 and 46 of the brief the
words, quote, "greatest possible degree of desegregation",
close quote, appear.

This is an attractive phrase, but I

think that standing alone it has no real meaning.

It takes on

meaning only as it is applied to a specific group of students
attending schools in a defined area.
It has meaning as applied to the students in the
City of Richmond? it has meaning as applied to students
attending schools in a larger area.

But it does not help in

the task presented here, which is to determine whether the
process by which a dual school system is effectively
disestablished can be extended to a larger area, not for the
purpose of eliminating dual schools but for the purpose of
providing a viable racial mix.
Another phrase which appears several times in the
brief to which I have referred, and in the district court
opinion, is, quote, "racially identifiable schools", close
quote.

Again I suggest that this phrase has no operational

meaning, except as it is applied to a particular area.
There are many schools in Vermont and New Hampshire
and other States which are 100 percent white, and thus, I

65
supposei they are racially identifiable.

But they do not in

any sense violate any provision of the Constitution.

It is

only when a school is racially identifiable with respect to
something else that the phrase has any legal significance.
On this record there are no schools which are
racially identifiable with respect to any other school in the
City of Richmond,

A school is not racially identifiable for

any purpose of legal significance merely because it is 70
percent white or 70 percent black or, indeed, 100 percent
white or 100 percent black.

And I doubt that that presents

any question under the Equal Protection Clause.
Indeed, there is something somewhat contradictory
a nd unattractive in the proposition that a school is inferior
merely because it has a certain percentage of black students.
Unless the proportion of students of one race in a school is
the consequence of some sort of invidious discrimination or
unless it leads to discrimination through inequality of
appropriations, it should be colorless legally.
Here is the place where the Constitution should be
colorblind.
Yet the record shows that it was this sort of
reasoning which led the district court to its conclusion.
I'he district court's order is based on a concept of a viable
racial mix, a phrase that is used many times in its order,
and which comes directly from the testimony in the district

66

court of Dr. Little and Dr. Pettigrew.
This approach has already been judicially answered
in one of the characteristically illuminating opinions of
Judge Sobeloff in the Brunson case, which is quoted at pages 59
and 60 of the respondents' brief, of the notion that a good
t

school must have a white majority does, as Judge Sobeloff said,
seem to constitute a direct attack on the roots of the Brown
decision.
Yet that is the only basis of the district court's
order.
QUESTION:

What do you understand by the meaning

of the overworked adjective "viable” in this phrase?

I

thought that it meant a makeup of school populatj.on that would
be stable, that would not have inherent in it the probability
of leading to all-black and all-white schools.
MR. GRISWOLD:

And that, Mr. Justice, in the words

of the experts, is a school population witn no-less thun ?.G
percent black, because the blacks feel isolated if there's
less than 20 percent, nor more than 40 percent black, because
white flight —
QUESTION: That leads to the whites flight,
MR. GRISWOLD:

— enters into the picture. And the

consequence is that what it means is there must always be a
white majority in every school, to have a viable —
QUESTION: Well, in the context of the Richmond

67
metropolitan area, that's what all the testimony had to do
with, wasn't it?
MR, GRISWOLD:

No, I think, Mr- Justice, that the

testimony of the experts would be applicable throughout the
United States, where there is any problem of racial adjustment.
Less than 20 percent makes the Negro feel isolated, and more
than 40 percent means that there is risk of white flight.
QUESTION:

Well, I understood the testimony basically

to be directed to the facts, the demographic facts of this
metropolitan area, which is basically two-thirds white and
one-third Negro.
MR. GRISWOLD:

Mr. Justice, I think the testimony of

the experts, if examined, will show that in their opinion,
in any situation in which there are two or three or four
percent black students, that that is undesirable for the black
students; and that in any situation in which there are 50, 60,
70 percent black students, that there is a great potentiality
of white flight.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. GRISWOLD: And here the children of Chesterfield
and Henrico Counties are brought into the picture for the
purpose of maintaining this not less than 20 and not more than
40 percent black, and yet why stop there?

As the map at the

close of the respondents’ brief shows, these three areas are
completely surrounding by other counties where there is a

63

majority of black.

Why should not some of the Chesterfield

and Henrico students, perhaps those living close by, be used
to leaven the mix in the surrounding territories?
QUESTION:

I see.

MR, GRISWOLDs

Indeed, this suggests a way to test

the district court’s decision below.

This case began in

Richmond, and the remedy is designed to improve the
situation in Richmond.
Let us suppose, though, that the case had been
started in Chesterfield County, and complaint had been made
that the schools in Chesterfield are racially identifiable and
that a mix of 20 percent to 40 percent black students is
preferable according to the expert testimony.

Does it seem

conceivable that an order would then have been made joining
Richmond as a party defendant in the Chesterfield case, and
then bringing Richmond students into Chesterfield in order
to provide there a viable racial mix.
It may be suggested that this is absurd, but I
wonder if it is really different from what the district court
undertook to do here.
And in this connection I would like to refer to a
few undisputed facts.

The combined area of Richmond,

Chesterfield and Henrico is 752 square miles.

That is more

than ten times the area of the District of Columbia.

It is

63 percent of the area of the State of Rhode Island, and

69
nearly 37 percent of the area of the State of Delaware»
The petitioners' arguments here inevitably lead to a large
amount of centralization and concentration of control over
these schools.

And, logically, there is no reason for

stopping short of a Statextfide system.
Indeed, since the Due Process Clause of the Fifth
Amendment embraces the concept of the Equal Protection Clause,
there's no logical reason for stopping short of a single
national school system, with a viable racial mix in every
school.
This is very close to the problem with which this
Court dealt in the San Antonio School District case, where
it concluded that the Equal Protection Clause should not be
applied so mechanically to produce a type of overawed,
inflexible, egalitarianism which is indeed alien to our
history and to our institutions.
Our position here is not quite as broad as that
taken by the respondents.

We do not contend that school

district lines are inevitably or inherently inviolable.
On the contrary, in the Scotland Neck and the Emporia cases
last term we contended that district lines should be
disregarded when they were established or put into effective
use for the purpose of maintaining the consequences of a once
combined and segregated school system.
But there are no such facts here, and there is no

70

contention here that these district boundaries were
invidiously established.

If there had been specific instances

when the lines have been used to maintained segregation and
that effect continues, then we would regard the district lines,
the district court as having power to look into that situation
and devise an appropriate remedy.
QUESTION:

Mr, Solicitor General, how do you read

the Court of Appeals opinion — did the Court of Appeals, in
your view, say that there was an independent reason for
reversing the district court, in that the district court
attempted to establish a racial quota or establish a racial
balance among all the schools?
MR. GRISWOLD:

Yes, I think, Mr. Justice, that that’s

essentially what the Court of Appeals meant, and that becomes
very apparent when the district court’s opinion is read,
because it is filled with this holding, "to achieve a viable
racial mix”.
QUESTION: As you read the Court of Appeals, it would
have reversed the district court even if — even if the
boundary line question were not a separate iosue in itself?
MR. GRISWOLD:

No, Mr. Justice, I think that if this

were historically and always had been a single school district,
that then there i^ould not be — then there would be racially
identifiable schools within the school district.
QUESTION:

Yes, but that isn’t the question. The

71
question was whether or not in proceeding■ — if historically
this had always been one area, mid it had been racially
segregated, then the problem was to disestablish the dual
school system.

Would the Court of Appeals then have

reversed the district court because of the way it approached
it in terms of racial quotas or racial mixes?
MR. GRISWOLDs

I’m not sure, Mr. Justice.

That

would have been a case very close to the Charlotte School case,
where this Court said that an absolute racial balance
throughout the system was not required, but here there would
have been a considerable concentration in one area.

It

would have been not unlike the situation in Charlotte, before
the district judge there —
QUESTION: Well, then, it must be that the Court
of Appeals didn’t use that factor as a separate, independent
grounds for reversing the district court.

The boundary line

issue has to be — has to be — is critical to the Court of
Appeals decision?
MR. GRISWOLD:

Oh, yes, Mr. Justice.

isn’t any question about that.

Yes, there

It's critical to my position

here.
There's a section in the petitioners' —
QUESTION:

Are you saying, Mr. Solicitor General,

that boundary lines may be disregarded to achieve some
objectives, but they may not be disregarded to achieve racial

72
balance?
MR. GRISWOLD;

Mr. Justice, I'm say that they might

be disregarded where it is shown that they were established
for the purpose of providing or maintaining some sort of
discriminatory consequence with respect to the schools.
In this case there is no such evidence and no such claim.
My time seems to have expired, Mr. Chief Justice.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Yes.

If you wish to

finish, we'll make an adjustment accordingly.
MR. GRISWOLD: Well, I have only a little more.
The district court opinion and the petitioners'
brief do rely on the fact that some Richmond schools and
some Henrico schools are, quote, "located a very short
distance apart," close quote.

And I would mention that on

this chart the only schools that are shown are those which
are thought to be close to the boundary line.

There are many

other schools in between, which are not shown,
I think, though, that there’s less here than meets
the eye.

In the first place, seven of the eleven pairs of

schools, and I would call attention to the tabulation at page
429 of the Appendix, in the district court's opinion, seven of
t he eleven pairs of schools are more than three miles apart,
and four of them are 4.9 miles apart, and up to 6.2 miles
apart.
Now, five miles is as far as from the Capitol out

73

Massachusetts Avenue to the American University.

Two of the

schools are listed as 1.4 miles apart, and there's a notation
that this is eight blocks.

But the distance of 1.4 miles

is the entire length of Pennsylvania Avenue, from the foot
of the Capitol to the Treasury Building; that's 14 Washington
blocks on a diagonal.

If 1,4 miles is eight blocks, that

allows more than 300 yards per block, which are rather large
blocks.
QUESTION;

Is there anything in the record that

shows how far they presently bus children in Richmond?
MR. GRISWOLD;
QUESTION:

They presently bus children in Richmond.

MR, GRISWOLD;
with what it is.

How far — what, Mr. Justice?

I believe there is.

I'm not familiar

It cannot be as great as the distances

involved in busing the children from Henrico into Richmond,
and the children from —
QUESTION: Well, I understood they used to bus them
clean across Richmond,
MR. GRISWOLD:

Isn’t that right?
Yes, but that isn't very far, Mr.

Justice.
QUESTION: Well, Richmond is more than five miles,
isn't it?
MR. GRISWOLD:
than five miles,

Yes, Richmond in many places is more

I am suggesting that this is not a case of

having a black school here right next to a white school, which

is the impression which is sought to be created by this
tabulation.
On this record there are no invidious local
examples of discrimination.

At any rate, that is not the

basis on which the district court below undertook to act.
The basis of its decision was the desirability of establishing
a viable racial mix, a phrase which it used repeatedly.
That concept, we submit, is itself invidious, and a denial
of equal protection to both white and black.
Accordingly, the decision of the Court of Appeals
should be affirmed.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Thank you, Mr. Solicitor
General.
Mr. Coleman, we'll enlarge the time of the rebuttal
by three minutes.

You work that out the way you wish.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM T. COLEMAN, JR., ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF BRADLEY, ET AL.
MR. COLEMAN:

Thank you. Do you think it might take

me twice as long to move as fast as the Solicitor did?
QUESTION:

Mr, Coleman, --

MR» COLEMAN:
QUESTION:
answer at any time.

Yes, sir,

— may I ask one question for you to
Suppose this were not Richmond, Virginia.

f

Suppose,everything else being the same, this were Kansas
City, and the line between the districts was not a school

75
district line but was the State line between Missouri and
Kansas; would there be any difference in this case?
MR. COLEMAN:
lot of difference.

Oh, Mr. Justice Blackmun, there's a

Federalism is important.

And there’s no

way you can stand up here and say that when you’re involving
two States the rule is the same as when you're involving
school districts.
QUESTION;

Isn't this the next case, though?

MR. COLEMAN; The Constitution specifically provides
that any time that two States get together there has to be
a congressional compact, and that’s just completely different
than, with all due respect, it is nowhere near this case and
we're not contending that,
QUESTION: Then you disagree with the Solicitor
General's comment to that effect?
MR. COLEMAN:

Oh, I certainly do, and I really --

well, I do, yes, sir.
Now, what the Solicitor General said, this is
Charlotte but for these division lines.

Now, he did not

tell you that in Division 6 there is nothing done under this
plan.

Now, once you eliminate division 6, you then don't

have the 752 square miles that they would have you believe,
but you have only 400-and-some-odd miles.

That is less

than what you had in Swann, because Swann was over 500, and
Mobile was 1200 square miles.

76

So, really, with all these horribles that you don't
have that in this case.
Now, I have tried to argue the case based upon the
record, and Mr» Kurland, with all due respects, when he was
asked about the record, he walked away from the record,

X

do think that this case has to be decided on the record, and
contrary to what Mr. Kurland said about findings with
respect to residential and segregation, there is a finding
at 206a in the Appendix to the Petition for Certiorari, 211a,
and, indeed, on 572a it’s the one finding that the Court of
Appeals accepted and said the district court was correct,
and that he was not upsetting.
Now, secondly, they constantly talk about these
systems being unitary at the time they were brought on, at
the time of the decree? that just is not the fact.
record findings are to the contrary.

The

The Court of Appeals

never mentions Rule 52(a), it never discusses the evidence,
it just says*

I assume that these systems are unitary.

But the district judge, and X referred you to those
places, Mr. Justice Brennan, and I just ask you to read them.
That's supported by the record.

Look at that exhibit and

you i*ill find that these schools certainly are not unitary,
that they are all-black schools, they're all-white schools,
measured by any test you wish to meet,
QUESTIONz

Well, let me put it this way, in these

77
terms;

Do you say that in the City of Richmond today they

are operating a dual school system in terras that we used in
Green and prior cases?
MR. COLEMAN;

The answer affirmatively is yes, as

loud and clear as I can make it, Mr. Chief Justice.
the same thing with respect to Henrico.

X say

I say the same thing

with respect to Chesterfield.
But, more important, what X said, that’s what the
district judge found, and no Court of Appeals has upset that
finding.

And it seems to be that on this record, that's the

way that this has to be decided by this Court,
Now, they talk about this line, I think at some
point somebody should tell you that this line was redrawn in
1971, and if you look at the Exhibit book, on page 67e,
you will find a memorandum from the State Board of Education,
saying, "By official action at its June meeting the State
Board of Education established school divisions as per the
attached effective at noon, July 1, 1971,"
Now, the district judge said, and he found as a
fact —* and every time I see this chart that Mr. Kurland
puts in his brief, I say I wish I had put it in there, because
that's what this case is about.
Now, here you have a State agency charged with the
responsibility of setting a new line.

It sees Richmond as

all-black, it sees these counties as all-white.

vcw, I ask

78
you, can you exercise State power in such a way to keep that
black enclave there?

This was done in 1971, after this

lawsuit was under way in final hearing. And it was done at
a time when anyone who drev/ that line knew the result of
drawing that line was to create all-black schools and allwhite schools.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We'll resume there after

lunch, Mr. Coleman.
MR. COLEMAN:

Thank you.

[Whereupon, at 12:00 noon, the Court was recessed,
to reconvene at 1:00 p.m,, the same day.]

AFTERNOON SESSION
[ 11 GO p.ra,]
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Coleman, you may

continue.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM T. COLEMAN, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF BRADLEY, ET AL
MR. COLEMAN:

- [Resumed]

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
Just at the luncheon break, sir, I pointed out that
the respondents in 1971 had an opportunity to redraw these
lines and they drew them in the same place.
Unless there be any doubt about that, just look at
pages 228a and 229a of the Appendix.
Now, there was some mention about white flight.
Once again, we have a finding on it. The judge found as a
fact that between 1970 and 1972, 7800 white students, or
39 percent of the entire white student population of Richmond,
left the school system.

That's at page 237a of the Appendix,

and in the record it's at page 417a.
Now, there is talk about these schools, and I think
it very interesting that when you come to the opposition of
the stay, or trying to grant the stay after Judge Merhige, at
page 1347a of the record, the lawyers, seeking the stay,
representing the State Board of Education, the Superintendent
of Public Instruction, the Attorney General of this great

80

Commonwealth of Virginia that so long has segregated blacks,,
says:

The evidence indicates that Richmond school buildings

are old and obsolete in some cases, while Chesterfield and
Henrico have gone forward in the past decade and a half with
aggressive, modern building programs.
Now, we also heard some mention, which I really
think comes with ill grace from the Commonwealth of Virginia,
that the blacks having the courage to seek this relief
somehow should be criticized because of the question of white
control.
Well, you had pointed out to you that it was a bi~
racial School Board that made the determination to seek this
relief.
Secondly, you had pointed out to you that it's the
black petitioners asking this relief.

And I really think it

comes with poor grace from the Commonwealth of Virginia that
has this tremendous history of segregation in penning black
people up to now say that somehow we are criticized for
attempting to get schools which comply with the Constitution.
That’s all we want.

And not have schools which are in

violation of the Constitution,
QUESTION:

Suppose that the State of Virginia, Mr.

Coleman, decided that it was awkward to try to have these two
counties and the City of Richmond function for administrative
purposes only in the field of education, and decided to legis-

81

late an annexation or however they do it in Virginia.

This

would be one way of accomplishing this process, wouldn't it?
MR. COLEMAN:

Yes, sir.

And, as Mr. Little pointed

out to you, Mr, Chief Justice, the Virginia statutes permit
the result that the judge brought about, and the only statute
which he didn't follow 100 percent was the statute that was
amended in 1971, while this litigation was pending, and the
record makes it clear on page 906a of the record, 942a of
the record, and 944, that the Legislature sitting in Richmond,
knowing that this lawsuit was pending, then sought to change
the statute so that these local counties would have to
consent.
QUESTION: Are you suggesting that it follows that
if State law permits something, that then that vests
constitutional authority in the courts to reach the same
result?
MR. COLEMAN:
that question.

Well, Your Honor, I'm glad you asked

Our position is, clearly, that once we

establish a constitutional violation, which I think we have
from 1871 until, to date, then the Court can take steps to
end the violation and to correct the situation.

And certainly

if the steps they take are those that are consistent with
State law, there can't be any criticism, particularly when
you, Your Honor, in the Davis case, indicated that once there
is a violation and the only way to end the violation is to

82

ignore a State statute, that the federal court has the duty
and the obligation to ignore that statute.
You will recall —
QUESTION:

Well, all State statutes aren’t

fungible.
MR. COLEMAN:

No, but State statutes which prevent

the ending — well, no, State statutes are not fungible, I
agree.

I have no problem with that.
But I'm saying that this State, any State statute

that's involved here, if it has the effect of preventing
effective desegregation, you then do what you did in the
North Carolina vs. Swann, and if you indulge, on page 46,
where you said:

Just as the race of students must be

considered in determining whether the constitutional violation
ha3 occurred, also must race be considered in formulating a
remedy, to forbid at this stage all assignments made on the
basis to deprive school authorities of the tool.

And there

North Carolina was arguing they had a State statute which
specifically said that you can't send children to school —
QUESTION:

That State statute would have frozen

the statute's role permanently, would it not?
MR. COLEMAN:

Well, that's exactly the same thing

here, Your Honor,

Look at my friend's map, that's what he is

attempting to do.

He is attempting to freeze pe manent ly that

situation, and I just don’t think that a federal district court

33

is without power in permitting — particularly,, Mr. Justice
Fahnquist, whan you asked me the question, I stated that they
took people across this line to maintain segregation, and
you asked Mr, Kurland that and he agreed with me,
X do think that under those circumstances,
certainly to say that you can’t do it to get an effective
desegregation is more sophistication than at least I have,
Mr, Coleman, you answered Mr. Justice

QUESTION:

Blackmun rather vehemently when he put the question to you
about State lines.

Let me try a hypothetical, perhaps not

so hypothetical, nearer home, nearer where we are.
You’re familiar with the problems in the District
of Columbia, over the years.

It has been suggested publicly

and privately, from time to time, that the State lines of
Virginia and Maryland should be ignored and that the
metropolitan area of Washington should be treated just as
the Court has treated the metropolitan area of Richmond,
Would your response to that be the same as Mr,
Justice Blackmun's question?
MR. COLEMMJ:

Well, I think that that is slightly

a different situation. That’s not this case.

But I would

say that after checking I would find much greater difficulty
urging that you can cross the district line to go into the
— to go into Maryland, because once again there are
constitutional provisions dealing with how you set up a district

84

And with the Tidewater case decided in 1940, and other cases,
it’s a different question, but it's not the question we have
here.
It's just different, Your Honor.

Mow, if I had

that case, I v/ould then meet the issue, and I would be able
to answer the question? but I just think it’s a completely
different question.
QUESTION: Well, the Equal Protection Clause, in
its terms, applies to a single State.
MR. COLEMAN:

That’s right; yes.

Yes, sir.

Well,

that's one ~
QUESTION:

Mr, Coleman, in your petition for

certiorari you present the single question of whether or not
a federal court may go beyond the geographic boundaries of
a school district in providing a remedy,
MR. COLEMAN:

That’s right,

QUESTION: That's the single question.

Now, let's

assume we agreed with you and said that it may go beyond.
Would we just say, reverse and not reach anything else in
this case?
MR. COLEMAN:
QUESTION:

Well, --

Is there another question?

MR. COLEMAN:

— the light has gone on, and I —

QUESTION: Well, I have asked you a question.
there another question in the case?

You can —

Is

85

MR. COLEMAN; Well, my understanding is that if you
make the detenaination that the Court of Appeals was wrong
in saying you could not go bavond that division line, then
I think you should affirm Judge Merhige.
If you don’t, because —
QUESTION: Well, we don’t — we haven’t got Judge
Merhige to affirm here, we've got the Court of Appeals
judgment.
MR. COLEMAN:

Well, you reverse and order them,

what you do all the time, Your Honor, you order them to
reinstate the judgment,
QUESTION:

I know, but is there any other question

we must reach before reversing?
MR. COLEMAN:

I think not, Your Honor.

And —

QUESTION: Well, were there any other questions
raised in the Court of Appeals that the Court of Appeals did
not reach and decide?
MR. COLEMAN: To the best of my knowledge, the
answer to that is no, there were not, Your Honor,

And what’s

happened here is a very sophisticated way to confuse the
situation.

The viable racial mix appears nowhere in the

principal opinion of Judge Merhige,

In his entire opinion,

in that part which is from page 164a to 263a, thereafter
there’s an additional part of the opinion where all he does
is to take all the testimony and discuss it.

And they find

86

only in that part, you cannot find in what he said his
opinion was, and so I think that if you determine that that
line which was a bamboo curtain for purposes of segregation
cannot become an iron curtain, you should reverse and
reinstate the judgment of Judge Merhige.
If you felt you should send it back, I think at
least under your other cases you should say when it goes
back ~ which I don't think it should go back to the Court
of Appeals — at least the Merhige plan should go into
effect the way you did in Swann, until such time as relief,
because, after all, I do hope that the next generation at
least will get a constitutional education.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Thank you, Mr. Coleman.
Thank you, gentlemen.
The case is submitted,
[Whereupon, at 1:08 p.m,, the case in the aboveentitled matters was submitted.]
