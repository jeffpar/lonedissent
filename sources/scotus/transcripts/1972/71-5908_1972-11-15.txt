MR,, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER %

We will hear arguments

next in 71-5908, Chambers against Mississippi.
Mr, Westen,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER WESTEN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. WESTEN;

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
The petitioner in this case, Leon Chambers, was
convicted of a murder which another man was seen committing,
and to which that other man spontaneously and repeatedly
confessed within hours of the shooting.

The case presents

two questions.
First, whether Chambers has a right under the
Constitution to introduce the other man's confessions to
prove he is innocent; and, second, whether Chambers has a
right under the Constitution to cross-examine the other man
and impeach him for repudiating his confession in court
and denying that he had anything to do with the crime.
The case began with a shooting that took place at
night during a racial disturbance in June 1969 in the town
of Woodville, Mississippi.
Aaron Liberty.

The victim was a policeman named

Liberty and other policemen were confronting

an angry crowd of about fifty blacks.

As Liberty faced the

crowd, he was suddenly shot four times in the back.

The

4
bullets carae from a 22-caliber gun from somewhere in the alley
behind him.

As he died, he turned and shot both barrels of

his riot gun into the alley. The first shot passed over the
heads of the crowd, the second shot hit a man who, by then,
was running down the alley.

That man was the petitioner,

Leon Chambers.
Chambers was left in the alley, severely wounded.
When the police had gone, he was taken to a local hospital,
where, two days later, he was placed under arrest for the
murder of Aaron Liberty,
Chambers insisted from the outset that he was
innocent, and that the State had arrested the wrong man.
Indeed, within hours of the shotting, another man, Gable
McDonald, spontaneously confessed on separate occasions to
three different people that he was the one who shot Officer
Liberty.
He first confessed to Berkley Turner, who left the
scene of the shooting with him that night.

He next confessed

to Sam Hardin, whom he had known all of his life, and who
drove him home on the night of the shooting.

He confessed

the next day to Albert Carter, his next-door neighbor,
whom he had known for at least 25 years.
Four months later, McDonald repeated his confession.
He dictated it in the presence of a minister and signed it
under oath.

It was detailed.

He said that he shot Officer

5
Liberty at close range from the mouth of the alley»

He said

that he used his own nine-shot 22-caliber pistol, which he
discarded after the shooting.

He said that he was confessing

because it was no secret any longer that he was the one that
shot Liberty.

He said that he was telling the truth, but

admitted that he would be afraid to testify in court.
QUESTION:

Mr. Westen, does the record show what

has happened to — Gabriel McDonald, is it?
MR* WESTEN: Gable McDonald had a preliminary
hearing, one month after he signed his written confession,
before a Justice of the Peace, who, after a few days of
deliberation, dismissed the charges against him.
One year later, Chambers himself went to trial for
the murder of Aaron Liberty.

He based his defense on showing

that he was innocent and that it was not he but McDonald who
killed Liberty.
The evidence against Chambers is practically non­
existent. One witness testified that he was watching Chambers
at the time of the shooting, and could swear that Chambers did
not shoot Liberty.
Three policemen, who were on the scene, one who was
standing only two yards from Chambers and another who was
standing four yards from Chambers and watching him at the
time, denied seeing Chambers shoot Liberty.
The police testified also that despite a diligent

6

search they never found the murder weapon»
There was evidence also in the record that Chambers
— there was no evidence in the record that Chambers had ever
owned a 22-caliber gun»

It is true that one witness, a

policeman, the one who was standing farthest from Chambers,
testified that he saw Chambers shoot Liberty,
QUESTION: Was there any evidence offered that
McDonald ever owned a gun like this?
MR. WESTENs

Yes» The record showed that he had

purchased, before the shooting, a nine-shot 22-caliber pistol,
and that he purchased shortly thereafter, shortly after the
shooting, a second 22-caliber pistol.
QUESTION:

At what stage in the process of the

proposed impeachment was that evidence offered?
MR. WESTENs That was offered as part of the
defendant's affirmative case.

He called, the defendant called

a witness who sold the two guns to Gable McDonald in Natchez,
Mississippi, and who had federal firearms records.
I was saying that there was one eyewitness, a
policeman, who testified that he saw Chambers shoot Liberty,
but the record also shows that neither that policeman nor
any other policeman even searched Chambers, who was lying,
at the most, 20 or 25 feet from them after he was shot, and
that that same policeman spent the next day asking members
o f the black community if they knew who shot Liberty.

7
As for Chambers' affirmative case, which is the
issue here, he moved first to introduce McDonald's oral
confessions.

The confessions were spontaneous.

independent of one another.

They were

They were uttered on the scene

of -- they were uttered within hours of the shooting. They
were made to friends of his, and to people who had themselves
witnessed the shooting.
Furthermore, the confessions were corroborated by
eyewitness testimony*
McDonald shoot Liberty.

One witness testified that he saw
Another testified that he saw

McDonald immediately after the shooting, carrying a pistol.
As I said before, there was evidence that McDonald
had owned two 22-caliber pistols; one that he had purchased
before the shooting and another that he had purchased
immediately thereafter.
Nonetheless, when Chambers called Sam Hardin and
Berkley Turner as defense witnesses, the trial court excluded
— prevented them from discussing McDonald's confessions.
He excluded the confessions on the ground that declarations
against penal interests are hearsay and inadmissible in
Mississippi.
Chambers then moved to introduce McDonald's written
confession.

For that purpose he called McDonald as a

defense witness.

He had no illusions at that point that

McDonald would be a friendly witness, because at McDonald's

8

own preliminary hearing, long before the trial, McDonald had
repudiated his confession.
But Chambers called him for the purpose of
authenticating the confession and laying a basis for
introducing it.

And he examined McDonald for that purpose

only.
When —
QUESTION: Was the written confession introduced?
MR. WESTEN:
QUESTION:
MR. WESTEN:
QUESTION:
MR. WESTEN:

Yes, it was.

It was —*

On what ground?
It was introduced —
Why was that admissible?
It — I think if the State had made a

hearsay objection, it would have probably been sustained.
But they did not, and hearsay is only excluded on motion, on
objection, in Mississippi.

It may well have been that —

QUESTION: So he was subject to cross-examination
on his repudiation?
MR. WESTEN:
QUESTION:

He was — he —
I mean he was subject to questioning

by —
MR. WESTEN: The State interrogated him about the
truth of this confession. But Chambers was denied the right
to cross-examine him, following the State’s examination about
his repudiation.

s
QUESTIONs All Chambes did was ask him, "Is this
your confession?"
MR. WESTEN; That's right.
QUESTION; And ~
MR. WESTENs
QUESTION:

He knew at that

point

And then introduced it?

MR. WESTENs That's right.
And the State made no objection.

It may have been

that — the written confession had already been introduced
in McDonald's own preliminary hearing.

Whether that was the

reason or whether the State failed to make the objection for
other reasons, it was read to the jury.
QUESTION:

And so Chambers said — called him to

the stand and said, "Is this" — showed him a copy of the
confession and said, "Is this your confession?"
MR. WESTEN: That's right.
QUESTION:

He had signed it.

"Is this your

signature?"
MR. WESTEN:

Yes.

QUESTION: And the next question might have been,
"Did you also admit that you killed" —
MR. WESTEN:
QUESTION:

Liberty.
— "Liberty? did you also admit that

to anybody else?"
MR. WESTEN:

He might have asked that question, but

10

he had very good reasons for not asking it.

He had made a

motion before trial to examine McDonald’s —QUESTION:

I know, but let's assume he had asked it.

If the written confession —- if he was entitled or permitted
to inquire about the written confession, might he not have been
permitted to inquire about the oral confessions?
MR. WESTEN:

Certainly. And I think if he had asked

that question, it would have been admitted.

But there were

reasons —
QUESTIONs And he — and McDonald might have said,
"Yes, I did tell so-and-so that I killed Liberty"?
MR. WESTEN:

He might have, yes.

likely would have denied it.
QUESTION:
MR. WESTEN:

But he most

For these reasons —

Yes, let's assume he had denied it.
If he had denied it, which is what

Chambers expected, because at McDonald's own preliminary
hearing he had already denied talking to anyone else about
the shooting or having confessed to anyone else, before his
written confession.
If he had denied it, Chambers would have been left
with an answer that he couldn't impeach, and could not follow
up because the trial court had already ruled that —
QUESTION:

It would have been — he would have been

in better shape than he is now, though, wouldn't he?
MR. WESTEN:

That's a question, perhaps, of trial

strategy.
QUESTION:

Perhaps that's what this case is all

about .
MB. WESTEN:

But he •— but I think it would have

been madness to ask a witness for an answer that could not be
impeached.

Chambers —- he knew — Chambers called McDonald

because there was certain testimony he wanted from him, and
he examined him for that purpose only.

And until the court

permitted him to pursue inquiry fully, he refused to elicit
answers that he could not follow up, and to leave —■
QUESTION:

Mr. Westen, at the conclusion of

McDonald's cross-examination by the State, your client's
counsel asked leave to cross-examine, it was denied, but then
he didn't even make any effort to put any questions on what
would be called redirect, I suppose.

I would think he could

have gotten some of what he wanted in on redirect, without
necessarily having leave to cross.
MR. WESTEN:
answers to that.

There are two things — there are two

Redirect makes some sense, where there's a

hope of rehabilitating the witness, where the witness is
friendly, where he is prepared to support the party who
called him.

But in this case, McDonald had denied on cross-

examination everything he had said on direct examination.
repudiated it.

He'd

And the only thing — and there's almost

nothing that can be done on redirect with a witness like that.

12
The reason why Chambers did not go ahead and ask
individual questions on cross-examination, to ask him about his
explanation for repudiating the confession and what he was
really doing that night, and about the truth of his alibi,
ar.d about his 22-caliber pistol, was that the judge had ruled
— had made a ruling that he had no right to put

leading

questions to his witness.
QUESTION;

Mr. Westen, under the laws of Mississippi,

in those conditions, if he asked the question, wasn't he bound
by the answer?
MR. WESTEN;

He would have been, and that’s what he

had been told from the outset of trial.
QUESTION; Well, isn't that the answer?
MR. WESTEN: That's -- that is our answer.
QUESTION;

Your position is that he was a hostile

witness inherently, and that he should have had the privilege
of treating him that way from the outset? is that it?
MR. WESTEN; That's what was argued in the State
court. As far as this Court’s concerned, as far as the
constitutional question is concerned, McDonald became a
witness against Chambers when he denied the truth of the facts
on which Chambers rested his defense.

It was at that point

that Chambers, we submit, had a constitutional right to crossexamine him, to probe the truth of his testimony, to determine
if he was committing perjury, and to impeach him with independent

13

evidence, to show, to discredit his testimony.
QUESTION'S Was McDonald ever indicted?
MR. WESTEN:

No, he was not.

And I should say that at the point where the
Justice of the Peace dismissed charges against McDonald, the
only evidence they had against McDonald was his sworn
confession; they did not know about the three oral confessions,
and they did not know about the eyewitness.
QUESTION: Was the eyewitness called at Chambers’
trial?
MR. WESTEN:

Yes, he was.

QUESTION: And did he testify that he had seen
McDonald rather than Chambers shoot the officer?
MR. WESTEN:

Yes, he did.

We urge this Court to reverse the conviction on
two independent grounds.
First, Chambers was denied his right under the
Constitution to call Hardin and Turner as witnesses in his
behalf, and to introduce McDonald's confessions, to prove
he was innocent.
The right to call witnesses, the right of the
accused to call witnesses and present testimony is protected
by both the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment
a nd the compulsory process clause of the Sixth Amendment.
With respect to due process, we rely on the line

14
of cases, of which fche leading case is Brady vs. Maryland.
Brady stands for the general proposition that it is a denial
of due process for the State, for no good reason, to deprive
the defendant of exculpatory evidence that has a material
bearing on his innocence.
In Brady, the State deprived the defendant of
exculpatory evidence By withholding it from him.

In this case,

Mississippi has denied Chambers the benefit of exculpatory
confessions by withholding them from the jury.
each case is the same.

The effect in

In each case, the State put a man on

trial for his life, and then, for no good reason, deprived him
of the benefit of evidence that would have shown he was
innocent.
QUESTIONS

Well, it’s your position that he should

be able to call a witness who can testify as to an exculpatory
c onfession, wholly aside from impeaching anyone?
MR. WESTENs That's right.
QUESTIONs

That’s the --

I mean just as a general proposition,

even if McDonald had never been called at all, he should have
been able to call a policeman who would testify as to an outof-court confession by some third party?
MR. WESTENs
QUESTIONs

We —
Is that your position?

MR. WESTENs That is our position.
expand on it.

But I should

It's our position that the due process and the

15

compulsory process entitle the accused to offer evidence to
show he is innocent, unless the State can show some reason
for withholding it from the jury.
In this --QUESTION:

Wasn't it that what you felt you should

be permitted to do was to produce the men to whom the oral
confessions were made?
MR. WESTEN: That’s right.
QUESTION:

To argue and so forth. Not some police[sic]
man to testify that the — that Chambers had admitted to them.
MR. WESTEN:

We submit that we should have been

permitted to put on the stand Sam Hardin and Berkley Turner,
to testify —
QUESTION:

The ones to whom the alleged oral

confessions were made?
MR. WESTEN: That's right, to recite McDonald's
out-of-court confession.
QUESTION: Even though McDonald isn't in court, and
is wholly unavailable?
MR. WESTEN:

No, because we think“that that's one

reason why Mississippi is incapable, in this case, of making
a showing — of showing a reason for withholding the
confession.

The presence of McDonald rendered his out-of-

court confession sufficiently reliable — it provided a
sufficient basis for introducing a hearsay confession, that

16
there was no legitimate reason to keep it out»
There's another reason. We think that —
QUESTION: Before you get to that reason, do you go
so far as to ask that the old Donnelly case be overruled?
MR. WESTEN: We don’t think that the Court has to
overrule Donnelly»

Donnelly was not a constitutional case.

It established a federal hearsay rule, and it did so on facts
t hat were not nearly as compelling as they are in this case.
In Donnelly, the declarant was dead, and there was no way to
cross-examine him about the truth of his out-of-court statement.
In addition, there was only one confession, as
opposed to three as in this case.
And, finally, there was eyewitness testimony in
this case to corroborate the hearsay confession, which was not
the case in Donnelly.
QUESTION: Would you say that Mississippi couldn't go
so far as to require a predicate for the hearsay testimony, as
most States, I believe, do, by first asking McDonald, as long
as he’s there:

"Did you ever make a confession, oral

confession to Berkley Turner?"
MR. WESTEN:

Yes.

And I think that relates to

Mr. Justice White's question, and I think that kind of rule
would make a lot of sense.

That's the proposed federal rule.

That's the rule in California.
But Mississippi doesn’t have that rule.

It excludes

17
hearsay confessions whether or not there was a predicate,
whether or not there was a prior question to the witness
about whether he made the out-of-court statement.
It is our position that it would have served no
purpose to ask itf for the purpose of introducing McDonald’s
confessions for their truth, as hearsay, to prove Chambers was
innocent.

There was no purpose served by asking McDonald,

in Mississippi, -—
QUESTION: Well, in any event, I gather your
submission is that you should be ~ have been permitted to put
on Hardin and whoever the other chap was, to testify what
McDonald had told them, not for impeachment purposes but for —
MR. WESTEN: For hearsay.
QUESTION:

— affirmatively, on your defense.

MR. WESTEN: That's right.

They are two arguments

we make.
The first is that Chambers had an affirmative right
t o show he was innocent by offering evidence -QUESTION:
MR. WESTEN:

That, somebody did it.
— to show that it was not he but

somebody else that committed the crime. And we submit that
under the decisions of this Court, in California vs. Green and
in button vs. Evans, there is no legitimate ground for
withholding those hearsay confessions to exculpate Chambers.
In Dutton vs. Evans, the Court --

18

QUESTION? As long as McDonald's around.
MR. WSSTENs

Excuse me?

QUESTION: As long as McDonald is around, —
MR. WESTENs As long as — yes.
QUESTION:

— and subject to examination.

MR. WESTEN: We think that California vs. Green

and

Dutton vs. Evans are cumulative in this case, both factors are
present.

Under the standard in California vs. Green, the

declarant was present.

Under the standard in Dutton vs. Evans,

the statement was a spontaneous declaration against penal
interest, that carries, in the language of the plurality
opinion, "such indicia of reliability that they can be
introduced" — they can be introduced in satisfaction of the
strict constitutional standard of the confrontation clause.
In this case, the standard of —
QUESTION:

I had rather understood that basically

this case is 180 degrees opposite of either Dutton v, Evans or
the Green v, California.

There the claim was, the constitutional

claim was that the Sixth Amendment permitted — did not permit
those exceptions to the hearsay rule? and in this case you're
saying that the Constitution, including the Sixth Amendment,
requires that Mississippi make
hearsay rule.

these exceptions to the

Just exactly the opposite claim.

Isn't that — have I got this wrong?
MR. WESTEN:

In many ways for — in some ways,

19

perhaps, it's the converse of Dutton, and of California vs,
Green, but for this reasons

In California vs. Green and in

Dutton, the State offered hearsay against the accused under
its own rules of evidence? and the question was, were those
hearsay statements so inherently reliable in the context —
in their context, that they could be introduced in satisfaction
of the strict constitutional standard of the confrontation
clause.
In this case, Chambers contends that he has a right
under the compulsory process clause of the Sixth Amendment,
which has nothing to do with confrontation, and due process
clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, to offer the evidence in
his favor, affirmatively to prove he's innocent.

But unless

the State can demonstrate that the hearsay is so inherently
unreliable that the only way to protect the integrity of the
c ourtroom is to exclude it altogether.
And we submit that under the federal standard — and
I should say that whether or not the hearsay is reliable is
itself a federal question, and it's a federal question
because it determines the scope of the defendant's right to
prove he is innocent.
In light of California vs. Green and Dutton vs.
Evans, I see no way in which Mississippi can demonstrate that
these statements are so unreliable that they have to be kept
out to preserve the integrity of the courtroom.

20

QUESTION;

Mr. Westen, may I come back to the

questions that were asked you by Mr. Justice White.

Let’s

assume for the moment that McDonald was not in the courtroom
and not available, and no one knew where he was.

Would your

position be the same as to the admissibility of the testimony
of the three persons to whom the oral confessions were made?
MR. WESTEN:

It's my feeling that where a hearsay

statement is corroborated by an eyewitness, and is corroborated
by the declarant’s own written confession, and corroborated
by independent oral confessions, and is a declaration against
penal interest, and is spontaneous,

and uttered on the scene

of the crime to friends of the declarant, that it is
sufficiently reliable to be introduced in his favor.
But that ~ the Court doesn’t have to decide that,
because the declarant was present here.
QUESTION: Right.
MR. WESTEN:
QUESTION:

I think it's important ~
But your theory, as I understand it, is

that in effect you look at the totality of the circumstances,
to see whether or not the evidence could be admitted, it was
inherently reliable?
MR. WESTEN: Well, perhaps I've misled you, Mr.
Justice Powell.

It's my position that the due process clause,

and —
QUESTION; Right

21
MS. WESTEN:

— the compulsory process clause

entitle the accused to offer any, any exculpatory evidence
that has material bearing on his innocence unless the State
comes forward and makes its showing that the evidence is
so unreliable that it has to be kept out.
So it's not the accused who has to demonstrate
that it is reliable, it’s the State that has to demonstrate
that it is inherently unreliable.
QUESTION: But this isn’t a new question, I mean
there’s a historic rule about this, about third-party
confessions.
MR. WESTEN: There’s a hearsay rule.

There’s a

State and —
QUESTION: But hasn’t the rule regularly followed
been that an accused may not simply call somebody to testify
to a third-party confession?
MR. WESTEN: That is the rule that —
QUESTION:

I mean that's been a rather standard rule,

hasn't it?
MR. WESTEN:

The rule in federal courts, which has

been established, it was established in Donnelly vs. United
States, to which Mr. Justice Blackmun referred, establishes
that standard, it establishes that proposition.
QUESTION: Well, how about State cases?
isn't this —

I mean,

MR. WESTEN: The States are generally in agreement
with Donnelly, about the
QUESTION :

So need the State need to state every

time that it’s offered, make the demonstration other than
citing .150 cases?
MR. WESTEN:

It's our position that the State has

the burden of demonstrating a persuasive reason for preventing
the accused from proving his innocence.
As for the hearsay rules you were referring to, Mr.
Justice White, Donnelly itself has been severely questioned.
It would be abolished by the new, proposed federal rule of
evidence.

The dissent by Mr. Justice Holmes is slowly

becoming the prevailing position in all of the recent States
that have recently codified their laws of evidence.

But

we're not making the argument as a general matter, that
declarations against penal interests should always be
admissible, we're making the ■— it's our position that
in a criminal case, where there is practically no evidence
against the accused, and where it is quite possible that
he is being tried for a crime to which someone else — a
crime which someone else committed, and he has —
QUESTION:

Well, why, Mr. Westen, isn't that

a totality approach, as Mr. Justice Powell suggested?
What you're now doing, suggesting, as I understand
it, is that at least in the facts of this case, where there

23
is so little evidence otherwise against Chambers

— there's

so little evidence —
MR. WESTEN;

If this were a case like Dutton vs.

Evans, in which there were 19 witnesses against the accused,
who all pointed the finger at him, there might be some
question about whether he could offer a hearsay confession
to prove that he hadn't done it.
QUESTION!

Well, I ask you again, xvhy isn’t this,

then, as Mr. Justice Powell suggested, the argument for a
totality approach in this context?
MR. WESTEN:

I'm not sure that I know what you mean

by totality.

I think the question is:

exculpatory?

Is it material?

Is the statement

QUESTION: Well, what I mean is that whether or not,
in the context of this particular case, he should be
permitted; that you're not arguing that necessarily there
should be a general proposition that always exculpatory
statements should be admitted.
MR. WESTEN: Well, the general propositions that
were — on which we rest our argument is that the accused
does have an affirmative right to prove he is innocent, unless
the State can make some showing.

In this case, it is,

we submit, absolutely untenable to argue that out-of-court
statements, confessions are unreliable.
QUESTION: But you have to make this on a constitu-

24

ticmaX basis, not on a supervisory power basis, don’t you?
MR. WESTEN:

That’s right.

And the constitutional

basis is — I refer the Court to the opinion on the last day
of the term in June, in the case holding that parolees are
entitled to a hearing before they are — before their parole
is revoked.
The Court said in that opinion that the due process
entitles an accused to offer evidence to show he is innocent,
and to confront the witnesses against him.

That’s what we're

arguing •— that's our position that there is an affirmative
right in the accused to make out a defense, and to offer
evidence that is reliable and persuasive and material to his
innocence and, as our second ground — which I haven’t
discussed yet, and probably won't reach — that the accused
has a right to confront and impeach, cross-examine witnesses
against him.
QUESTION; And he became a witness against, in that
sense, when he repudiated his confessions.
MR. WESTEN; That’s right.
QUESTION; That’s your argument?
MR. WESTEN;

And when he denied the truth of

Chambers’ affirmative defense.
The — perhaps I will reserve the remainder of my
time for rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Hancock, either now

25
or at some time in your argument, would you address yourself
to the situation, the hypothetical situation that 1811 give
you nows
What would be the situation under Brady, if all
three of thesje witnesses had gone to the prosecutor or the
police and told them of this confession?

And let's add that

McDonald himself went to the police and told them what he
told the others.
And the prosecution never disclosed that to anybody,
and it was never discovered until after a conviction.

What

would be the situation in this case under Brady, and subsequent
cases?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMMIE HANCOCK, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. HANCOCK;

I believe under such circumstance it

would be the duty of the prosecution to inform the defendant,
or petitioner here, of any evidence that was favorable to him.
And that the denial of the State to do such would be
certainly considered by this Court in —
QUESTION:

Now, in this case we have essentially,

then, do we not, the question of what the defense -- what use
the defense would make of that information after they discover
it?
MR. HANCOCK:

That is correct.

I think here we should start out by saying that the

State put on their case here, there's no question as to the
sufficiency of the evidence raised? the State, in putting on
their case, introduced witnesses who stated that they saw
Leon Chambers do the shooting»
QUESTION:

The jury was justified upon —

How many witnesses said that they saw

Chambers do the shooting?
MR. HANCOCK:
QUESTION:

One witness testified that he —

I thought you said "witnesses".

MR. HANCOCK:

One witness testified that he sattf

Chambers when he actually pulled the trigger, and he saw the
wounded man flinching as the bullets hit hirn. Andother witness
testified that he saw Leon Chambers bring his hand down, and
at about that time he heard the shots fired,
QUESTION: These were policemen?
MR. HANCOCK: These were policemen.
QUESTION: And they arrested Chambers promptly, I
assume?
MR. HANCOCK: Chambers was shot immediately thereafter
by the man whom he shot? Chambers shot Aarcn Liberty, who
was a policeman, and at that time Aaron Liberty fell backwards,
and then he turned around and fired one Shot into the air,
and then shot Leon Chambers.

Leon Chambers was carried to the

hospital, and was admitted over there.
QUESTION: Was he arrested?
MR. HANCOCK: The sheriff — the testimony of the

27
sheriff was to the effect that he was, considered him to be
under arrest.
QUESTION:

He considered him to be under arrest.

When was he arraigned?
MR. HANCOCK:

He was arraigned —

QUESTION: A year later.
MR. HANCOCK:

I believe he was — it was some time

later? I don’t remember the exact time.
QUESTION: Any explanation for that?
MR. H.ANCOCK; Well, Leon Chambers, during this time,
was very ill.
QUESTION:

I mean this is a case where you have three

policemen who saw the crime of murder, and it took them a year
to get around to arraigning him.

Isn't that strange?

MR. HANCOCK: Well, I think that depends to some
extent upon the physical condition of Leon Chambers at the
time.
QUESTION:

Like what?

Well, when did Chambers get out of the hospital?
MR. HANCOCK:

Pardon me, sir?

QUESTION: When did he get out of the hospital?
MR. HANCOCK:

I do not know. This was not brought out

in the trial, I don't believe.
QUESTION:

Butyou don't have any reason for ■— why

it took them a year to get around to it?

28

MR. HANCOCKz

No, Your Honor; not based upon the

record, I do not. But this question was never raised in the
lower court.
QUESTION:

Was he out, walking around?

MR. HANCOCKs

I do not know.

The record does not

show that.
QUESTION!
ever

Well, does the record show when he was

when a warrant for arrest was issued?
MR. HANCOCK:

Pardon me?

QUESTION: Does the record show when a warrant of
arrest was issued?
MR. HANCOCK:
QUESTION:

I do not believe it does,
Was he — I assume he was arrested at

some time.
MR, HANCOCK:
QUESTION:

He was arrested.

But you don’t know when?

MR. HANCOCK:

He was arrested, I believe, within a

week after he was shot.
QUESTION:

Then was he out on bail?

MR. HANCOCK:
QUESTION:

He was released on bail*

Is that in the record?

MR. HANCOCK:

I believe — yes, sir, it is.

He was

released on $15,000 bail, I believe.
QUESTION: That was a week afterwards?
MR. HANCOCK:

I’m not sure when he was released

29
That question was not raised previous to this time.
The petitioner now states that he was not allowed
to put on his affirmative defense.

However, the petitioner

was allowed to introduce a witness who testified that he
saw Gable McDonald shoot Leon Chambers.

[sic,]

Now, Gable McDonald was not the defendant. The
petitioner tried, attempted to show that he was innocent by
showing that another man was guilty.

This man being Gable

McDonald.
As I said, the court, trial court allowed the
petitioner to put on testimony of an eyewitness, of a person
who said that he was an eyewitness and that he saw Gable
McDonald shoot Leon Chambers.

[sic.]

Also, the defense was allowed to call Gable McDonald
as a witness.

Gable McDonald admitted that he had confessed

to this crime.

He said that he went to the petitioner's

counsel, petitioner at the lower court, at the trial court;
he went to petitioner's counsel and gave them a confession.
Now, this confession was introduced into evidence.
The court allowed this confession to be introduced as a
confession.

I don't believe that they were required to, under

the decision of this Court in Donnelly, and the universal
rule, almost, but the trial court allowed this confession
to be introduced into evidence.
Then the State questioned Gable McDonald, and Gable

30

McDonald testified that he did give the confession, and he
testified that he gave the confession because he was promised
that he would get some money for it, if he would confess»
That the police, the law enforcement officers would never know
about it, and that it would ultimately wind up in a lawsuit
wherein he would get one-third of the money that was brought
about in this lawsuit.
So McDonald repudiated his confession, and he
explained why.
At that time Leon Chambers brought on three more
witnesses, and he asked them if Gable McDonald had confessed
to them.

The prosecuting attorneys objected to this on the

ground that it was hearsay, and certainly it was.

The

statements were introduced for the purpose of the truthfulness
of those statements.

Well, the person who knew the truth,

if those statements were made by Gable McDonald, was Gable
McDonald himself.

He's the only individual who would know if

he made those statements and if — whether they were true.
QUESTION:

This argument was available for the

written confession and you didn't use it.
MR. HANCOCK:
true.

Right.

Right.

I believe that's

I think the State allowed more evidence, more

affirmative evidence for the defendant to go in than the
State was required to do so.
QUESTION: Was McDonald asked whether he had made

31

these oral admissions to these other people?
MR. HANCOCK;

No, Your Honor, he was not.

The petitioner now states that he did not ask him,
because the trial court refused to allox>; McDonald to be
questioned as an adverse witness.
Now, —
QUESTIONs

Mr.Hancock, as a matter of fact,

cannot an argument be made that the oral confessions are much
more reliable than the written one?

In this case?
/

Because they were — if they did take place, they
took place immediately, that night; whereas the written
confession came along three or four months later.
MR. HANCOCK;

I don't believe they necessarily can.

Gable McDonald would be the only one who — Gable McDonald
was available as a witness, and he did testify in this trial.
He would be the one to testify;

Yes, I gave those confes­

sions, and those confessions were truthful.
those confessions and they were false.

Or, Yes, I gave

Or, No, I did not

give those confessions.
The testimony from these other witnesses would be
based purely upon hearsay, they would not know the truthfulness
of the statement.
QUESTION: But unless he claimed, unless McDonald
claimed that these other three people to whom he made the
oral declarations had also promised him money, would they not

32
not be, those three confessions, would they not be as Justice
Blackmun suggested more cogent, more reliable than the one that
he said was given for a promise of money?
MR. HANCOCK:

I don't necessarily think so, because

after this great deal of time Gable McDonald knew that an
investigation was being conducted into the trial.

He knew

that prosecution would be coming about, and under these
circumstances he then made his written confession.
So I don't believe that there would be any greater
grounds for the admissions to be truthful soon after than it
would have been at the later date.
QUESTION:

Mr. Hancock, did I understand you to say

that one of the parties to whom the oral confession was made
was allowed to testify?
MR. HANCOCK:

He did testify, not as to the

confession, because an objection to that was sustained upon
the grounds that it was hearsay.

But one of the parties who

was going to testify to this effect did testify and he
testified that he saw Gable McDonald.
QUESTION:

That he did what?

MR. HANCOCK: The witness testified that he saw
Gable McDonald shoot Aaron Liberty.
QUESTION;

Yes, but did not the court instruct the

jury to disregard that, that testimony?
MR. HANCOCK:

I don't believe they did.

It's —

33

QUESTIONs I so construed the record, page 73 of
the transcript.
Perhaps I'm wrong, but that was the view I took
of it.
MR. HANCOCK:

I might be mistaken, but I do not

believe that they sustained an objection to his testimony,
that he saw —
QUESTION:

Was it witness Hardin?

MR. HANCOCK:

Pardon?

QUESTION: Was the witness named Hardin, H-a-r-d-i-n?
MR. HANCOCK:

Yes.

In any event ■—
QUESTION:

Well, it reads:

"By the Court:

The

jury will be so instructed at this time."
That's the last line on page 73 of the record, of
the Appendix.
QUESTION: Well, that has to do with the whole —
MR. HANCOCK:

Yes, that has to do with — pardon

me — that has to do with his hearsay objections on whether
or not a confession was given,
QUESTION: The oral confession.
MR. HANCOCK: The oral confession.

This is not

saw Gable McDonald shoot Leon Chambers."

[sic.]

QUESTION: Well, \vhere is that in the record?

Is it

in the Appendix?
MR. HANCOCK:

I'm not sure that it's in the Appendix.

It is in the trial —
QUESTION: Well, it is in the record?
MR. HANCOCK:

It is in the trial record, that Gable

McDonald testified that he — that Hardin testified that he
did see Gable McDonald shoot Leon Chambers.

[sic.]

Gable McDonald — Leon Chambers, rather, could have
asked Gable McDonald if he in fact made these other
confessions? but he did not do so.

He chose not to ask him.

He says he couldn't because he had requested the trial court
to allow him to question Gable McDonald as an adverse witness.
Now, under Mississippi rules,a petitioner, a defendant
is allowed to question a witness as an adverse witness, a
witness whom he calls as an adverse witness, when it is shown
that the testimony of the witness takes him by surprise or
he is hostile.

Well, there was no showing here in this case.

But, in any event, I don't think there is any magic
significance to the words "cross-examination".
still asked Gable McDonald:
He never did this.

He could have

Did you make other confessions?
He never questioned Gable

McDonald at all.
He didn't come back on redirect examination, after
Gable McDonald said, "No, the confession — I did give a
previous confession? that confession was not true."

35
QUESTION:

Under Mississippi practice, Mr. Hancock,

is the trial judge permitted or authorised to allow leading
questions in particular questioning situations, even though
the witness is not an adverse witness within the meaning of the
rule?
MR. HANCOCK: This is a matter within the discretion
o f the trial judge.

But here no attempt was made at that,

QUESTION:
of that.

He said:

I note the circuit judge's explanation
The answer is that the court would not

permit the defendant to cross-examine.
MR. HANCOCK: Well, as I said, there was no attempt
made to cross-examine.

And this is — as I said, there .is

no *—
QUESTION:

This is the judge in your Supreme Court.

He had no problem with it.
MR. HANCOCK: But maybe this was a dissenting
opinion.

But, as I said, I don't think there's any magic

meaning to the word "cross-examination".

He could have

asked him on direct examination, not a leading question
possibly.
QUESTION: But wouldn't he be bound by the answers?
MR. HANCOCK: Well, maybe the testimony that later

QUESTION:

"Maybe".

What's the lav; in Mississippi?

When you ask your witness a question, are you or are you not

bound by the answer?
MR, HANCOCK:
answer.

You ordinarily are bound by the

However, the answer might be such as to allow the

defendant to then question the witness as to -QUESTION:

But the judge has already said he can’t

do that.
Hasn’t the judge already said that?
MR, HANCOCK:

That was an after-the-fact opinion,

QUESTION: But didn't the judge say "you can’t
cross-examine this witness”?
MR. HANCOCK:

No, Your Honor, he did not in the

lower court,
QUESTION: What did he say?
MR. HANCOCK: The petitioner filed a motion and then
later requested the trial court to proclaim Gable McDonald
to be an adverse witness.

At the beginning of the trial, when

the motion was first made, the judge said:

I will reserve my

ruling on that until later when Gable McDonald is introduced
as a witness.
Gable McDonald was introduced as a witness.

This

motion was made to the trial court, and the trial court
overruled it.

At that time there was no showing that any of

Gable McDonald's testimony was ~ took the defendant by
surprise.

He was willing and able to answer every question

that was asked him, so he was willing to testify.

37
QUESTION:

Well, did the judge — did or did not

the judge give him the right to cross-examine him as a hostile
witness?
MR. HANCOCK:

He did not give him the —

QUESTION: And under those circumstances, wouldn't he
be bound by any answer that witness gave?
MR. HANCOCK: Well, I would think that would depend
upon the answer.
*

QUESTION: Well, what is the law in Mississippi,
w hen you call your own witness and he gives you an answer, you
can impeach him?
MR. HANCOCK: The law in Mississippi, as in most
jurisdictions now, is that you cannot impeach your own
witness under ordinary circumstances.
QUESTION:

I thought so.

So if he'd asked the question, he would have been
bound by the answer.
MR. HANCOCK:

If Gable McDonald had said, "Well, I

refuse to answer that", at that point he would have become a
hostile witness and he could have been cross-examined under
Mississippi law.
QUESTION: Well, if McDonald had answered, "No, I
didn't kill him, you did", he'd be bound by that answer.
MR. HANCOCK:

Yes.

QUESTION: And you don't understand why he didn't ask

38

it?
MR. HANCOCK: Well, 1 believe you have to look at the
totality of the circumstances. That goes to a matter of the
trial strategy, which I can't read into the trial record, the
t rial strategy of why this was ~ why he elected not to
question him, or why he did not.
But, in any event, we would consider that if there
were error, it was a harmless error, because there was
testimony to the effect, and it was put before the jury, that
Gable McDonald shot Aaron Liberty, an eyewitness — a witness
testified that he was an eyewitness to this.

Gable McDonald's

confession was put before the jury that he, on one occasion,
confessed to the crime.
We don't believe this would be devastating in any
way.

We believe, under the circumstances, that ruling

of

the trial court was proper, that he did receive a fair trial,
and that if there were any error it was purely a harmless
error.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Thank you, Mr. Hancock.
Mr. Westen, you have about one minute left,
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PETER WESTEN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. WESTEN:

I will refer the Court to our reply

brief on all of these questions concerning the failure to ask
a question and the failure to lay a foundation. But I'd like

39

to say a word about it to Mr. Justice Rehnquist and Mr. Justice
White.
Chambers offered the confessions for two different
purposes;
innocence.

first, as affirmative evidence of his own
For that purpose, there is no such thing as a

proper foundation in Mississippi.

There is no rule in

Mississippi that to offer hearsay for its truth you have to
first ask the witness, the witness on the stand, whether or
not he made the out-of-court statement.
That might be a good rule.

It's the rule in

California? it's not the rule in Mississippi.
As for the —• we also offered a confession for an
entirely different purpose, an opposite purpose.

We offered

the confession to Albert Carter in order to impeach Gable
McDonald.

In order to lay a foundation for an impeaching

confession, it is necessary to ask the witness whether or not
he made the out-of-court statement.

But we were not able to

do that at the trial court because, at that point in time,
the trial court had ruled that we could not cross-examine
McDonald.

And the question put to McDonald, whether or not

he had made an out-of-court confession inconsistent to what
he had just testified to to the State, would have been in the
nature of cross-examination.
QUESTION;

Mr. Westen, turning to page 146 of your

Appendix, am I right in thinking that the only time during

40

the trial proceedings that any constitutional dimension was
suggested to these rulings of the trial court was in the
motion to set aside the verdict, where, in paragraph 6 of that
motion, you say "the trial of the defendant was not in accord
with fundamental fairness guaranteed by the Fourteenth
Amendment of the Constitution of the United States"?
MR* WESTEN:

Yes, and for the above reasons, for

the reasons that Chambers was unable to offer a hearsay
confession to prove he was innocent, and to cross-examine
McDonald.
QUESTION; But it doesn't say, in that motion, "for
the above reasons", does it?
MR. WESTEN;

No, but I think it's —- I think it's

implied, because the above grounds are the errors, are the
specific errors alleged.

The argument was raised in the

Mississippi Supreme Court specifically; even if it hadn't
been it would have been before that court properly under the
Mississippi plain error rule.
QUESTION;

But it was raised.

But neither of the opinions in the

Supreme Court of Mississippi treated the matter as a
matter of constitutional --MR. WESTEN;

I think that's right, but that's

because they didn't bother with them.
properly before them.

The questions were

They were passed upon necessarily, and

they were implicitly denied.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, Mr. Hancock.
