MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
next in Wo. 71-692,

We will hear arguments

Illinois against Somerville.

Mr. Gildea, you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD J. GILDEA, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GILDEA:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This cause is here on a Writ of Certiorari to the
United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit to
review a judgment of that Court, reversing an order of the
District Court for the Northern District, of Illinois dismissing
a Petition for a Writ, of Habeas Corpus.
The facts in issue are these:
The petitioner in the Writ of Habeas Corpus in the
District Court, Donald Somerville, was indicted by an Illinois
grand jury for the offense of feloneous theft.
A jury was selected and sworn to try the issues of
that case.

The day afterwards, before any evidence was heard

and before any opening arguments were made by counsel, the
counsel for -the State of Illinois moved the Court to dismiss
the indictment on the basis that it failed to charge a crime
cognizable by the State of Illinois.

That is, it failed to

aver a necessary element of the offense of feicneous theft
and that is the intent to permanently deprive.

Over a general objection of defense counsel, the Court
sustained

the.

state8s motion and dismissed the indictment..

Two days later the matter was resubmitted to an Illinois grand
jury and a 'second indictment was returned charging the very
same offense, this time alleging the necessary averments to
constitute an offense under Illinois law.
QUESTION:

Let me back up now to the day of trial.

Suppose the day before the trial motion had been made by
defense counsel challenging the indictment on the same grounds
and the Court had dismissed the indictment as defective,, what
would have been the status under Illinois law of that case?
Would they have gone to the grand jury again, got a new
indictment?
MR. GILDEA:

Yes, your Honor.

Under Illinois law

no offense was ever charged, the defendant had never been
placed in jeopardy, and the State was free to resubmit the
matter to any grand jury.
QUESTION:

How is he more in jeopardy after the jury

is picked under that kind of an indictment, a defective indict­
ment, than he was before?
MR. GILDEA:

I don't believe in any more jeopardy,

depending upon whether the Court attaches emphasis to the
concept of attachment.

But. in terms of the double jeopardy

principles, I understand it he is no more in jeopardy after the
selection of a jury than he is before under these circumstances.

5
QUESTION:

And he was In no jeopardy before under

the defective indictment?
MR. GILDEA:

He was in no jeopardy.

And under the

traditional and the classic rule, he was in no jeopardy after­
wards, bearing in mind that the classical rule for attachment
of jeopardy is only when a defendant is placed on trial before
a jury or a judge in -the event of a bench trial on a regularly
charged indictment.

However, if there is some defect in the

jurisdiction of the court before which the matter is presented,
under the classical rule of double jeopardy, he is not then
in legal jeopardy as the concept, was understood initially and
as it has been understood, to my way of thinking, since the
inception of the rule.
QUESTION:

Well, are you seeking a ruling here that

is based on the jurisdictional nature of the indictment?
MR. GILDEA:
one aspect of the case.

No, your Honor.

We feel that that is

But we feel that we can't sustain

our position on another basis besides the jurisdictional basis,
and that is under the "manifest necessity"

doctrine that was

espoused in the United States v. Perez and that was continuously
employed by this Court up until as recently a» United States v.
Jorn, our basis being that in reference and in deference to
Illinois State criminal procedure^ the question of judicial
power to try crminal cases, the Court before whom Donald
Somerville was arraigned for trial had in fact under Illinois

6

law no pov/er to try him for that offense.
QUESTION:

Then suppose the trial had been going on

for three days and the defect were discovered, your position
would be the same?
MR. GILDEA:

Our position would be the same insofar

as the manifest necessity doctrine, that is, that the Court
would still have to have declared the mistrial.

Then the

question may then arise as to whether or not on some other
theory, such as an estoppel theory, the State should be allowed
to reprosecute him, and that would depend on whether or not
the defendant had sustained any substantial burden as a result
of the error, if it is an error, on the part of the prosecutor
in drafting a defective indictment and proceeding to trial.
And that would depend, again, upon the course that the trial
took up to the time of the mistrial.

Then depending on

whether or not the status of the evidence, whether or not the
evidence at that point reviewed by another court was such that
one might say that the defendant had the advantage or was on
.I
the verge of an acquittal at that point.
QUESTION:

If Illinois hereafter simply lets the

trial go forward and finish and leaves it up to the defendant
to raise the jurisdictional question, then what you have lost,
is simply the wasted time, you just wasted some time and effort?
MR. GILDEA:
Illinois --

Well, not entirely, your Honor, because

7
QUESTION;

Well, really if he was convicted ,in

that trial and he appealed and the case was reversed, you could
retry him,
MR. GILDEA:
QUESTION;
MR. GILDEA;

That is correct, your Honor.
But if he was acquitted, you could not.
You could not.

But if he is acquitted,

I think interjects an element into the case.

And that goes

back to I think the inception of the rule which is the principi®
of autrefois acquit.
What we consider here is the fact that all that the
law is concerned about or concerned with is a resolution of
the issues of a case, the merits of the case.

And if it

proceeds to a verdict and there is an acquittal, than it's hard
to say that the acquittal that was returned by the jury had
anything whatsoever to do with any defect in an indictment.
QUESTION;

That's exactly right.

So you couldn't try

him again then.
GILDEA:
QUESTION

No, your Honor.

And I think then —

we are really arguing here whether

the State should be permitted to terminate the trial and
not waste its time when a sufficiently serious defect in the
proceedings arises which would almost guarantee reversal.
MR. GILDEA:

That is correct, your Honor.

There is

nothing in the course of the proceedings insofar as they
transpired up to the point where the mistrial was declared that.

8

would indicate that the State was at a disadvantage.

As a

matter of fact, no evidence whatsoever had been introduced.
There were not even so much as opening arguments.
QUESTION;

But whatever box the State found itself

in it created itself.
MR. GILDEA:

There is no question that the error is

attributable to the prosectuion.
QUESTION;

So you are saying — is your general

proposition that where there is a defect in the trial that
would guarantee ro^ersal, or almost guarantee reversal, arising
out of the State's negligence, a mistrial can always be
declared?
<*

MR. GILDEA;

Where an irreversible error has occurred

in the course of proceedings —
QUESTION;

And it's the State's negligence -«= and it's

rooted in the State's negligence.
MR. GILDEA;

And it's rooted in the State's

negligence, tinless there is something in the record that
would indicate that the assertion must — there was substantial
prejudice to the defendant or unless there was some indication
in the record that the assertion of the defect was interjected
for the purpose of avoiding an acquittal.

Then under those

circumstances we are submitting that does not constitute
double jeopardy, because what would happen in that case, if
the trial weren't aborted, it would proceed to a termination.

9
And the best we could hope for is, well, there could be an
acquit ocii,,

iiufc in the facts of this case, of course, on. the

retrial, there was a conviction and there is no indication here
that the subsequent trial was in any way different frora the
initial proceedings, or that the state gained any advantage
ii.^ the course of the subsequent trial .

So what the alternatives

are are simply to proceed to a termination, in which case all
that t-..e State coulcx hope for is gaining a conviction in which
case the defendant could assert the jurisdictional defect
which is never waived and would

have in his corner at his

advantage the prospect of having a retrial.

It just could

not be avoided.
QUESTION:
jeopardy attach?

If it's a jurisdictional defect, how can

That is, if there is an indictment which

cannot bring him to trial, then what difference does it make
that the formality of the jury having been selected and
sworn has been carried out?
MR. GILDEA:

That's what we assert as the traditional

view.
QUL3II0N:

But that traditional view doesn't relate

to defective indictments.

Is there any case in this Court

which has ever sard that jeopardy attaches on a non-indictment,
an indictment that is no indictment?
MR. GILDEA:

No, your Honor.

The reason I referred to the manifest necessity

10

doctrine is because tills Court has —- it. has been intimated
in Benton v. Maryland which is premised upon People v. Barrett
a New York case, where it was said that there was a different
connotation attached to the term "attachment of jeopardy"
where it was said that from the viewpoint of the defendant,
what difference does it make whether or not the Court has
jurisdiction

and any judgment could be sustained because as

a practical matter he still faces 'the jeopardy of the prospect
of being sentenced to the penitentiary and not for observing
the error.

So there seems to be some suggestion that there is

a difference between practical jeopardy and legal jeopardy.
And that's why I made that distinction.
But under the traditional view, there was no legal
jeopardy in this case because the Court had no jurisdiction
to try the issues.
QUESTION:

The logical conclusion of that is that

even if he were tried and acquitted, there would be no
double jeopardy.
MR. GILDEA:

Well, no, I don't think so.

X don't

think so for this reason —
QUESTION:

You said because there is no jurisdiction

there is no jeopardy.
MR. GILDEA:

I say this — I think I am allowed to

make this one qualification, and that is, what is the purpose
of jurisdiction?

And I say this, that the only purpose in

Ii
jurisdiction is to restrict the exercise of the judicial power
of the Court.

It's for the advantage of the defendant, so to

speak, so that the Court cannot try any criminal case except
those that are allowed by the particular State constitution.
Now, if it should proceed to do so, even though
the court has no jurisdiction to do it, the ultimate issue
in any legal proceeding is to determine the merits of the case.
And if the merits of the case are determined by a court even
though it did rot have jurisdiction, then we are put in this
position:

A jury or a trier of fact has resolved the issues

against the State.

Now, albeit the court perhaps did not

have jurisdiction, the State was not prejudiced by that and
there is no reason to suspect that had the court had jurisdic­
tion there would have been a difference in the outcome of the
case.

Therefore, since the matter was determined on the

merits, then why allow the State to avert that result simply
by claiming lack of jurisdiction?

So I think that’s a big

difference.
QUESTION:

On that basis, then, if the judge had

said to the defendant, "By the way, the indictment is defective;
do you want a mistrial," and he said, "No," the judge said,
"All right, we will go ahead," and he’s convicted.

You would

say that would stand, too, then?
MR. GXLDEA:
that.

No, I don’t, because he could not waive

My basis is this:

The court could not proceed.

If

12
the court did not have the authority granted by the State —
QUESTION:

What if he said, "No, let's go ahead,"

and he was acquitted?
MR. GILDEA:
acquitted.

He said, "Let's go ahead," and he was

I think in that instance, first of all, I think

that the court would have been acting beyond its powers.
Now, if the defendant participated in that and said, "Let's go
ahead," then it's a different situation.

Then perhaps in that

instance, if he agreed to an illegal judicial proceedings,
then I question whether or not he could claim double jeopardy.
QUESTION:

Let me suggest a hypothetical.

seem a little extreme to you.

It may

Suppose in one of the very

large courts in the country where they have, as they do in
several places, 150 or 160 trial judges and nobody knows all
of them by sight, that some person walked into the courtroom
under a valid indictment and he is not a judge at all, h© is
just a fellow with a black robe and h© sits and presides over
the trial and a conviction results.
MR. GILDEA:
QUESTION:
MR. GILDEA:

Is that a valid conviction?

No, your Honor.
A complete nullity, is it?
It'3 a complete nullity.

And I think

perhaps this really points out the ~
QUESTION:

All right, let's take it on© step further.

An acquittal results.
MR. GILDEA:

Again, it’s a complete nullity.

13
It's always been the view.

It8s never differed.

X think

from the inception of the rule, if we refer to from the time
of Lord Cook

all the way up to the present, it's always been

the same.
QUESTION:

Let's take the next step.

Could he be

tried again by a real judge?
MR. GILDEA:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.
Now, here we have a non-indictment

instead of a non-judge, haven’t we?
MR. GILDEA:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.
The distinction is difficult for me to

grasp, but perhaps you can enlighten me.
MR« GILDEA:
a distinction.

I am not sure whether or not there is

If you consider in this respect, at least in

Illinois it’s the indictment that gives the court, an
indictment by a grand jury, that gives the court judicial
power to try a ease.

Nov/, if there is no valid indictment,

that court whether it wears black robes or whether the judge
has been sworn and is drawing a salary under the Stats law,
it makes no difference, because he has no more authority than
I to sit in judgment upon a defendant in the other situation.
In either case the court does not have the authority to try
that issue.
QUESTION;

14
respecting the non-judge, that in this case if there had been
a verdict of acquittal, the State would have been barred from
trying this parson again.
MR. GILDEA;
QUESTION:

Yes, but not on —
Thera is a difference apparently in the

two cases, between the case of an acquittal on a non­
indictment and a trial by a non-judge.
MR. GILDEA:

I have to concede that. I do believe

there is a difference because in that, instance the parties
placed their reliance on the apparent authority of the court.
The hypothetical proposed by the Chief Justice was, of course,
an extreme one, which it’s difficult to imagine having occur,

15
QUESTION;

Is your point really, for lack of a

bettor word, it has to be a valid acquittal?
MR. GILDEA:
QUESTION;

No, I don't think so,
It has to be an acguittal — it couldn't

be an acquittal of a court without jurisdiction.

You wouldn't

buy that.
MR. GILDEA;
QUESTION:
MR. GILDEA;

In the one case —
I don’t see how you could.
— if the court has the appearance of

judicial authority in it, there is a defect in the mechanism
by which that court exercises its judicial authority, then in
that instance, if the case proceeds to a verdict and there is
an acquittal, then the question remains what is the purpose
of the double jeopardy rule.

And in this situation, in that

situation we are speaking about, again, if the merits have
been regularly tried before a court that has apparent juris­
diction^ to try the case and it’s resolved in favor of the
defendant, then the question becomes, well, what is the
infirmity in that verdict and the subsequent judgment?

And

the infirmity is a technical one, is it not, the affirmifey
being that there was not a regular procedure in which that
judge was authorized to try the case.
Now, bearing in mind that when we speak about the
principle of double jeopardy, we are talking about competing
interests.

We are talking about the interest

of society in

16

punishing the guilty, assuming that's a legitimate interest,
and we are talking about the interest
being tried in a single prosecution.

of the defendant in
Now, when we contrast

those two interests in the situation that we are talking about,
can we say — and I think this is how I would resolve the
question — can we say that the State or the prosecution or
society

by virtue of that defect in the procedure whereby the

judgment was rendered suffered such prejudice that, the verdict
should be overturned?

And I would say in that instance, no,

it hasn't suffered anything.
QUESTION:

Could we back up just a minute?

wasn't this indictment subject to be amended?

Why

Is that

Illinois law?
MR. GILDEA:

That's Illinois law.

Illinois does

have sin amendment statute, but oxily as to form of defects.
»

But this went to the

(inaudible) ... and for that reason it *
*

wasn't subject to being amended.
QUESTION:

Suppose instead of a non-judge, this

spurious judge, you had a situation where the judge was a
genuine judge and you had a valid indictment, but someone just
forgot to administer the oath of office to the jurors and you
went on with the trial, would that be a valid trial?
MR. GILDEA:

I think so, your Honor.

Perhaps this

is bringing out the point that I should have made before.
this case what we are talking about, we are talking about

In

1?

technical flaws v/hich will occur, much the same as they occurred
?

in the case of LaVada

v„ New Mexico where the defendant plead

and that was overruled and there was a failure to

arraign the defendant, and they, proceeded to trial and then
*

•

•

they recognized cnat, they rearraigned him, which was a
technical mistrial, and proceeded to trial.

That's one

instance.
Now, again, I say, how is the State prejudiced in
terms of the ultimate judgment, verdict and judgment?

But if

you are talking about, let us say, a judge who has absolutely
no authority to preside, then the State in that instance is
prejudiced, society is prejudiced, because it cannot tolerate
persons without judicial authority presiding in criminal cases.
In that case I would say the State or society is prejudiced
and there should be a distinction between the two cases.
QUESTION:

Under Illinois law, had the trial in the

first indictment proceeded and resulted in a judgment of
conviction, could that have been collaterally attacked in
Illinois courts ^<3 the prisoner released?
MR. GILDEA:

Very definitely.

And an illustration of

that is the case that we have included in our brief, People
ex rel. Ledford v. Brantley.

It was a case purporting the

charge to the defendant was burglary.

And under Illinois

law to constitute the offense of burglary, you have to show
ownership of the burgled *

property in someone other than the

18

defendant.

And in that case they failed to allege the owner­

ship of the burglarised premises.

And the inmate in that

case,, Ledford, after pleading guilty to the indictment, he
pleaded guilty which normally waives all defects other than
jurisdictional defects, pleaded guilty and subsequently filed
<*

a petition for habeas corpus under the State Habeas Corpus Act,
and the court held in that case that his plea of guilty did
not waive the jurisdictional defect.

And therefore it was

subject to an attack and a post-conviction proceeding.
QUESTION:

Mr. Gildea, in getting back to the

distinction you have drawn between the non-judge and the
non-indictment cases, this Court in the Green

case, 355 U.S.,

said that the double jeopardy clause,and I'm quoting,

is a

* •

guarantee"that the State with all its resources and power
should not be allowed to make'repeated attempts to convict an
individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to
embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live
in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity."
Now, in the face of that principle, how can you
distinguish the non-indictment and non-judge cases’?
MR. GILDEA:

Well, I think first, of all. Green, if

I am not mistaken involved a case that went to verdict and
the defendant was —•

What I envision to be the abuse of the prosecutor's;

"

authority is th© ability on the part of the prosecutor to
attempt to avoid an acquittal by successive prosecution.
But in this case here, that was not the case, because
the State did not attempt to avoid an acquittal, because there
is nothing in the record that would indicate that the State
was in jeopardy facing an acquittal.

As a matter of fact, if

we consider the proposition that on the subsequent trial the
State was successful and the defendant was convicted and w®

consider that in terras of the fact that there was an impediment
in the indictment that was objectively

determinable, and

that there were no other indications in the record that th©

stances of fciie case, the underlying policy of the rule was not
violated in this instance.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Glides.

22
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD P. ALWIN, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. ALWIN;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court;
As Justice Harlan said in his opinion in the Jorn
case, the purpose of the double jeopardy provision is a
constitutional policy of finality for the defendant's benefit.
Here that policy was violated where the defendant was put to
trial once on an invalid indictment and then reindicted and
put to trial again on the subsequent invalid indictment.
We have in the history of the decisions of this Court
two consellations of cases, if you will.

We have the Peres

case and the cases along the line of following Peres under
different circumstances where this Court has held that the
trial may be aborted by the trial judge without the consent
of the defendant where there is a manifest necessity for doing
so, where there is a breakdown in the judicial machinery.
Those are the words used by the Court.

r

bn the other hand, we have another constellation of
cases, the Downum case, Jorn case, the Green case I think
belongs in that category, where the court has held that the
trial cannot be aborted without the defendant having been
s

placed in jeopardy.

And I hasten to add that sometimes

jeopardy is a conclusion.

Suffice it to say that the defendant

cannot be retried after the first trial is aborted.

23
To get to the question now before the Courts the
issue is whether or not the existence here of a defective
indictment takes this case out of the classic mold to which the
general rules applies.

And the respondent submits that it

does not.
I would like to look at some of the circumstances
here which this Court has considered in reaching a conclusion
that reprosecution would be barred.

Admittedly now these

circumstances are not each and of themselves determinative,
but they all go into the double jeopardy equation.

And one of

the first circumstances we have here is that neither the
mistrial nor the defective indictment was caused by the
defendant.

And I call your attention to the Tateo case where

the Court found that the mistrial was caused by the defendant, of
the guilty plea in that instance, not in this trial.

The

defendant also subsequently by a 2255 proceeding attacked the
judgment

of conviction.
Similarly, in the Ewell case, there was interestingly
*

an indictment, and there the defendant subsequently by k 2255
proceeding or at least on appeal attacked the judgment of
conviction.

Now, this Court held that there was either a

continuing jeopardy as expressed in Price v. Georgia or that
the defendant had waived his jeopary.

Whichever theory is

adopted under these facts, the defendant can be retried on a
subsequent valid indictment.

24
How, interestingly in the Ewell case, there was a
bad indictment.

But this Court, chose not to rest its opinion

on the existence o£ a bad indictment for the proposition urged
by the State here that there was no jurisdiction and -therefore
jeopardy had not attached.

This Court relied rather on the

sounder proposition that once the defendant attacks the
judgment of conviction, his jeopardy has not somehow concluded,
there was a continuing jeopardy, if you will.

QUESTION:
MR. ALWIN:

I take it it's not cited in your brief.
It's not cited in ray brief.

It is cited

by the way, in the Petition for Certiorari filed in the
previous case when this case was up here before.

prosecution.

Importantly, however, it was caused by the
And that distinguishes this case even from the

Jorn case where the mistrial was occasioned by the conduct of
the trial judge.

Here we have the underlying causa, the

material cause, if you will, the bad indictment was created
by the prosecution.

I pass again to the third point, what I call the
fishing cause of the mistrial was the motion for the mistrial wa
*

made fay the prosecution in this case.

Again I call your

attention to the Jorn case where in dissenting three Justices

■

noted that the — I am quoting —- “the mistrial was not
requested by the prosecution.This cannot be said about this
case.
The citation for the Ewell case is 383 U„S. page 116,
1966 case.
Returning for the moment to this idea that the cause
here and also the motion for the mistrial was occasioned by
the prosecution's conduct, I would like to call your attention
to the concept of overreaching expressed by Justice Harlan in
the Jorn case.

I think here we have overreaching,

overreaching

I would add, does not have to go so far as to be bad faith.
It can be, as Justice Frankfurter indicated in the concurring
opinion in Brock v. North Carolina, it can be incompetent or
casual or ineffective conduct of a prosecutor.
I would also point out that it can be passive as well
as active.

In the Downum case we have what might ba termed

passive overreaching.

The prosecutor didn't have the witnesses

there to testify against the defendant.
Here apparently it resulted from the drafting of the
bad indictment,and the indictments are drafted by the State’s
Attorney's office.

But. more importantly here, the State was

26

actually given a second chance to correct ‘tills error before a

trial.

was empaneled and sworn.

And that9s when the case went to

And we suggest here that the error would not have been

half so serious if the prosecution had npt proceeded to trial
on this bad indictment.
QUESTION:

If there was no jurisdiction in the Court

at that time under this indictment, do you think there was
jeopardy when that jury was sworn and took its place in the box?
MR. ALWIN:
sense I do.

Yes, your Honor, in a constitutional

I think that is the meaning of the Ball case where

the Court noted the difference between the voidable and the
void indictments.

I think there was jurisdiction within the

meaning of jeopardy under the Sixth Amendment, although I
hasten to add the jurisdiction is sometimes an elusive concept.
Certainly here there was jurisdiction over the parties and the
cause.
QUESTION:

Really that's what the Ball case does

stand for, doesn't it?
MR. ALWIN:

I believe so, yes.

Had there been no

jurisdiction there, then I think the Court would have to hold
that the acquittal itself was invalid.

The acquittal could

not have suddenly caused jeopardy to exist where there was no
jurisdiction.
I point out the purposes of an indictment here.
They are to — at least two purposes of indictment are to enable

27
the accused to prepare a defense and, of course, to plead
former jeopardy.

Here there is no indication that the accused

had not been able to prepare a defense and was in fact ready
to go to trial.

And this is indicated also by his objection

to declaration of a mistrial which X would point out does not
appear to be a token objection.

We don't have the record of

the State Court proceedings, but I would quarrel with the
State's characterization of this objection as a token objection.
Also supporting the argument here, of course, is the
decision in Benton v. Maryland where the Court noted that the
defendant there, as here, if the first trial had not been
terminated, the defendant could well have served out his timeunder this invalid indictment.

This, I think, is a very important

practical point which also goes to the jurisdiction of the
Court.

You see, the defendant could have served time even

in a case where the State would argue that the Court had no
jurisdiction.

A decision in line with what the State urges

here would not take into account the practicalities present in
a situation like this.
QUESTION:

Are you saying that if everyone in the

proceeding had been careless and not noted this defect, then
he might have been in prison for several years?
MR. ALWIN:
have been.

Yes, X think he would have been, could

However, if it had later come to his attention

that X think under the decisions of this Court and the courts

28

of Illinois, he could have had his conviction vacated by
collateral attack.
Now, the State argues that once it comes to his
attention, this somehow deprives the judge of a power to
continue the trial when in the first instance the judge didn't

have any power to continue the trial.

I don't think this

argument again comports with the reality.

The mar© fact of

knowledge should not be controlling in this case.
defendant admittedly with knowledge or

Here the

notice,if you will,

after this defect was called to his attention wanted to
continue with the trial.

Now, I ask your Honors what would you

say if I were here today on behalf of the same defendant and
he had objected, let's say he had raised the point, and trial
had bean terminated on the defendant's motion and then an
invalid indictment was obtained and he interposed the defense
of double jeopardy in this case we are here for today.

I

think your Honors would hasten to point out to me that this
mistrial had been declared under the defendant1s motion.

And

that's the principle of the Ewell case and the Tateo case.
t

You can't tales inconsistent positions and than ask for relief.
Ass the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit stated
in the Haugen case which is cited in the State's brief, you'can21
blow hot and cold.

Now, that was a double jeopardy case where

the defendant wanted to blow hot and cold.

He objected to an

invalid indictment and then he interposed the defense of

29
double jeopardy.
The respondent, in this case was consistent throughout
the proceedings»

He objected to termination of the trial.

He

maintained in the Appellate Court of Illinois that the
indictment was in fact valid.

X think obviously he was

adequately placed upon notice and he could prepare a defense.
That’s one of the essential purposes of the indictment.
Another point which I think should be taken into
consideration here, and I will make it only briefly, is the
potentiality for abuse.

We do not argue that in this case there

was an abuse by the prosecutor's office of an invalid
indictment.

But the potentiality is there, especially in

this situation, unlike the situation in United States v. Jorn,
for example.
I call your Honors' attention to the quotation
from People v. Barrett in the Downum case which I think
quite adequately covers that particular issue.
QUESTION;

Mr. Alwin, doesn't the Illinois law,

though, carry some safeguards against this type of abuse if
*

under an invalid indictment the defendant can not only get
his conviction reversed on appeal if the State doesn't bring
it up at the trial, but actually get collaterally released
after the judgments become final.

There certainly isn't much

incentive for the State to put in deliberately a defect in
the indictment thinking if the trial goes badly, we will use it?

30

if not, we will forget about it.»
MR. ALWIN:
Honor,

Well, I think, yes, there is, your

if the State tries an individual serially enough times,

I think eventually they will get a conviction which will be
upheld.

Even this advantage which I think your Honors

characterized as slight, but which I don't think is so slight,
might be sufficient for a prosecutor to take advantage of.
QUESTION:

Even though he knows its subject to

collateral attack?
MR. ALWIN:

Yes, I think so.

I think in the

experience of lawyers frequently a prosecutor will go to a
jury with a case which due not necessarily to a bad indictment
but due to very strong error he may suspect will be reversed.
In that situation he does not terminate the trial.
QUESTION:

Of course, when you are talking about

whether something will be reversed or not, does that always end
up as the judgment of the Appellate Court as to whether the
thing was not only erroneous but also prejudicial?

Here

you presumably start the trial with the opening day with an
indictment that is demonstrably bad and will entitle this man
to be released from any judgment of conviction without anybody's
assessment of prejudicial error or the like.

I think those

are different situations.
MR. ALWIN:

They certainly are different situations.

I cannot say with certainty to what extent this abuse might be

31

taken advantage of by the State's Attorney for Cook County, for
example, if at. all.

Perhaps there would be no abuse in our

State's Attorney's office in Cook County,but the potentiality
is there.

And that is one of the things that the double

jeopardy clause is designed to guard against.
QUESTION:

Isn't there an element of potentiality

of abuse, if I can call it. that, on the other side also?
Your case might be scheduled for trial on Wednesday, and on
Monday you see the defect in the indictment.

You can move

today to strike the indictment and not be subject to double
jeopardy.

But if you can play a game and if that jury is

called and sworn, then you have the present situation.

So

that there is a potentiality of game-playing in that respect,
too, isn't there?
MR. ALWIN:

Well, if it were to come to the

defendant's attention, I would think that he would be estopped
from later raising it if he chooses to go ahead with the trial.
QUESTION:

Under Illinois law could this trial have

been suspended and the grand jury return a new indictment?
I notice it was done very swiftly here, two days or something.
Could they have bad this jury stand aside and keep it impaneled?
MR. ALWIN:

I don't believe so, your Honor.

I don't

know of a case —
QUESTION:

In other words, they were impaneled on

one indictment and they had to be tried on that or nothing?

32

MR. ALWIN:

Yes, that is my understanding.

I think the final point I would make here is that
the defendant was deprived of his right to go to this jury.
In answer to, I believe it was Mr. Justice White's questions
to Mr. Gildea, there was a question of whether or not this
would be a waste of time for the State to continue; with this
trial if the same would be reversed on appeal.

To answer

that it would be a waste of time is short-sighted for this
overlooks the valued right of the defendant to go to this
jury and by this confrontation to end the confrontation rather
with the State at this time.
I would finally point out, if your Honors have doubt
about whether or not the defendant’s plea of double jeopardy
should be sustained as your Honors pointed out in Downum, this
doubt should be resolved in favor of the citizen.

In the

final analysis, as Justice Harlan stated in Jorn, the trial
judge’s decision to abort the trial should be tempered with
the defendant’s right to go to this jury which has been
selected and sworn and to end this confrontation with the
State right at that point.

That, was overlooked here.

Finally, I would add if in

a

situation it is a

criminal who must go free because, as Justice Clark stated in
?
Knapp v. Ohio, because (inaudible) , wq must remember here
that again as he stated it is the law that sets him free.
I thank you for your attention.
