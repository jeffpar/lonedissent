MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

Mr. Iungerichf you may proceed whenever you're
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RUSSELL IUNGERICH, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. IUNGERICHs

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
This case arises after the affirmance of the trial
court judge in dismissing a criminal case after a motion to
suppress had been granted in California trials court —
California trial court.

It was a people's appeal.

The facts of the ease, briefly, was in this manner,
female
An anonymous/informant placed a telephone call to a Los
Angeles police officer and informed him that two persons,
named Rodger and Judy were living at 1901 Nolden, in Los
Angeles - and were engaged in narcotics activities, and. were
also injecting methedrine into two children living at that
residence,
The officers verified that a lady named Judy Krivde
was paying the utilities at that address.

By visual observa­

tion, in going to that location, they saw two young children
playing in the front yard.
They returned at a later date, approximately a week

4
later, and observed several trash barrels next to the curb,
on the Parkway, awaiting pickup by trash collectors»
They also observed trash collectors? in the vicinity
with a trash collection truck.

They intercepted the trash

collectors and requested that the trash collectors empty
tiie well of the trash truck and deposit these particular
barrels into the well of the trash truck so that they would
not be conglomerated with other trash collected from the
neighbors in that vicinity.
Then, a block away from the residence where the
respondents Krivda and Minor were residing, the police
examined the contents of these trash barrels from the well
of the trash truck, and in the contents of the trash barrels
they discovered four to six partially smoked marijuana
cigarettes and other miscellaneous contraband narcotic
material.
After this, the officers observed respondent Rodger
Minor ecme from the house and retrieve the trash barrels and
place them on the front porch of the house.

At this point,

the officers went to the house, they arrested respondent Minor,
affected entry, conducted a further search, and ultimately
arrested respondent Judith Krivda.
In this context, then, two important questions
arising under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the
Constitution of the United States are presented here»

5
The first is whether Fourth Amendment protection
extends to garbage,in this case, which has been placed on the
curb and, for all intents and purposes, appears to have bean
abandoned to the trash collector.
And, secondly, whether, under the cireumstancos in.
this case, the application on the exclusionary rule :L.
constitutionally compelled»
With respect to the first issue, petitioner submits
that this case is controlled by this Court's precedents set
in the cases of Hester v. United States and Abel to United
States o
In the latter case, Mr. Justice Frankfurter wrote
that there is nothing unlawful in the government’s appropria­
tion of abandoned property.
And I submit to this Court that it is clear in the
context of this case that this property was abandoned and
that the respondents herein retained no further privacy
interest protected by the Fourth or Fourteenth Amendment.
Under the- circumstances in this case, it is clear
that they were acts of abandonment, first, by placing the
trash into the trash container, and, secondly, the abandonment
of the trash was further confirmed by the fact that the
barrels were placed upon the curb for collection by the
trash collector.

And, finally, I think we can draw a further

inference of an intent to abandon by the fact that the

6
residents of the house did not attempt to intercept these
trash barrels when the trash men carae to collect them,» or in
any manner attempt to retrieve them, when apparently they
were within the house, since Rodger Minor was later seen to
emerge from the house and retrieve the trash barrels.
I think, in the context of this case, it is clear
that privacy was at an end; that the Constitution protecte,
with the Fourth and the Fourteenth Amendment, as the Fourth
is applied to the States, basically the fundamental proposition
that a man's home is his castle,
are protected»

and things around his house

But when we extend privacy beyond these

fundamental principles, those fundamental areas, we get into
a very tenuous area where we don't have the privacy
interest, we don’t have annexes that connects the personal
Fourth Amendment rights of the individual with the property
seised or the place that is ultimately searched or the
material that is ultimately examined.
I think that if we look at the text of the Fourth
Amendment, it speaks in the possessiva, that persons have the
right to be secure in their houses, papers, and effects, but it
speaks of their papers and effect, and the "their" portion
of the amendment ceases when property is abandoned.
QUESTION?

You mean it’s no longer theirs?

MR. IUNGERICH;
correct, Your Honor

It’s no longer theirs; that's

QUESTION:

But I thought this was a possession

prosecution«
MR. IUNGBRICH: Welly I think the question of
possession, I think that was raised in the opinion of the
California Supreme Court in a footnote, in California vs»
Krivda, but I think if we analyze, we are dealing with two
separate matters here, as to whether there is sufficient
evidence to convict, and whether chore is probable cac^e x'Q.l
arrest.
And I would present this example to the Courts
The example of a man who sees a police officer approaching,
and at that point he throws a

bindle of herein on the- ground.

The courts have said the bindle of heroin —
QUESTIONs

We’ve seen cases like that here.

MR. IUNGE RICH:

Yes.

the b indie of heroin is

abandoned, but no court has ever held that the fact that the
man had possessed it recently, had possessed it prior to the
abandonment, that that could not be used as circumstantial
evidence to subsequently convict him, having had dominion
and control at the prior point in time.
And 1 think that those two fundamental questions
need to be separated.

1 think that the California Supreme

Court's opinion, with the footnote, suggests that possibly
there would not be sufficient dominion and control is inadvertent
and those facts were not before the court.

And X think that

8
it is improvident that that statement was made in the opinion,
But I think that the two questions are wholly
separate.
The question here is whether or not the police
officers had the right to examine this property in the well
of the trash truck, and certainly these particular respondents
had no fundamental right of privacy protected by the Fourth
Amendment in the location» one block away from their home»
inside the well of the trash truck» or with respect to the
material that was examined, which had been abandoned by them.
And 1 think there's no question that they voluntarily
relinquished all further rights or interests in that property.
QUESTIONS Would the case be any different if the
barrels had been on the back porch, where the trash collectors
had to go through the property, across the front lawn, to get
it?
MR. IUNGERICH:

I think that the case might be

fundamentally different under those circumstances.
QUESTION: All right.
MR. IUNGERICH:

All right.

I think there the immediate protection

with the areas immediately around the house, for the protection
of these contents, in other words, they might —
QUESTION:

fern mean in that circumstance, putting

the trash in the barrel would not be an abandonment?
MR. IUNGERICH:

Well, I think it would be possibly —

9
I think that it would show an abandonment.

there we would have a conflicting situation.

But I think -that
In other words,

that the contents of the trash barrel at that point may have
been abandoned, may somehow be protected because the trash
barrel at that point is owned by the individual and it is
within his backyard, for example, as it was in Edwards.
I think that there may foe some situation. That's not the
situation we have here.
QUESTION;

That’s because of the protection given

to his home, —
MR. IUNGERICH:
QUESTION:

That would be correct.

— isn't that correct?. And the same

would be true of something in a wastebasket inside his living
room.

He might have abandoned it, conditionally at least,

but the reason that's protected is because his home is
protected; is that right?
MR. IUNGERICH; That would be the way I would
distinguish the case, yes. Your Honor.

That would be, of

course, different from the situation in Abel, where the man
had vacated a hotel room and the contents were found in the
wasfcepaper basket;there, of course, they would be abandoned.
QUESTION; That was no longer Abel's homo because
he had given up the room.
MR. IUNGERICH;
QUESTION:

That's correct.

On the other hand, somebody's property,

10
X suppose, is protected# even in another person’s home? is
that right# undor the Fourth Amendment?

If I lend you a

chattel, have I got standing to object to an unlawful search
of your home where that chattel is seised?
MR. I0HGERICH:

Not under the Alderman decision c-i:

this Court, I don’t believe, Your Honor.

I don’t believe you

would have standing.
l think under California, under People vs.
QUESTION:

'

It’s ny property, those are my effects,

that have been unlawfully searched, and have bean seized.
Let’s say I lend you some guns.
MR. XONGERICH:

But '.£ think there would be a question

there as to whether you could raise an objection at. that
point to the unlawful seizure.

In light of the fact that,

I think probably the crucial distinction there would be that
there would be nothing to indicate the fact of possession to
the officer, whether located in the different location.

I

don’t know whether we would have a right of privacy there.

X could see a right of privacy, perhaps, when you deposited
your chattels with -~
QUESTION?

Well, you say, you read to us, you put it

to us, the language of the Fourth Amendment, where it talks
about a parson’s effects.
shotguns.

And among my effects I own three

X lend them to you to go hunting.

in your house.

And they’re

There’s an unlawful search of your house, and

11
an unlawful seizure of those guns.

Do I have standing to

object to that?
MR. XUNGERXCH:

1 would not think so, because 1

think there again we’ve got — we have a question of — you
have —* actually under those circumstances, 1 think it wouxo
be the question of having assumed the risk that possibly tier
would foe an invasion of your privacy where you would not foe
there to assert your own personal rights.
QUESTION: This isn't an invasion of my privacy,
it’s a seizure of ray effects, an unlawful search and seizure.
That * s covered by the language of the Fourth Amendment, isn't
it?
MR. IUNGERICH:

Yes, but I don’t think that that --

that the coverage of your effects, in 'that sense, I think there
has to be some closer — first, I think it’s important to look
in terras of the — of being secure in those effects.

X think

somehow your personal connection with the afreets has to bo
manifest at the point to someone outside, that they are your
effects, or that they are likely to be the affects of someone
other than the person who is in that particular dwelling, and
holding those particular chattels.
Now, l think that under the circumstances a police
officer, for example, would not h® able to discern that they

were your effects, from the fact that you havealent them to
someone else.

And under those circumstances, I think that

12
he would be judging it on the basis of the reasonable
probabilities involved» that they belonged to the person in
the. house and not to you.
I think» under those circumstances» I wouldn’t —
I think that we might make an exception# from the language as
it’s stated in the Amendment.

1* don't know that it's an

exception» but X don’t think it would foe- applied to that
situation.

Isn’t -the whole point of the other side

Period.

HE. XUNGERXCHs

I don’t think that's a reasonable

assumption, Mr, Justice Marshall.
QUESTIONs Why not?
MR. IUMGERICH: Because I think that when a man
abandons property —QUESTION:

Well# the police are not in the garbage

business.
MR, IUNG33RXCHs

I don’t believe the police are in

the garbage business# but# on the other hand» I think the
question has to be:

Has the man exposed — as va speak of

as this Court has spoken ©f in gats# where he has exposed
this particular material to the public» hie privacy interests
are at an ©nd.

In other words —

QUESTION:

But I would

well» suppose the can was

covered?
ME. IUNGERICH;

I believe the cans in this case were

originally covered•
QUESTIONz Wells don't you think that he would assume
that nobody would gat in there?
MR. IUNGER1CH:

1 don’t believe so, Your Honor,

because it's well known that the garbage man, himself, is
going to actually empty those cans and possibly observe the
contents.
QUESTION;

Well, where did this

■— what town did

this occur in?
MR. IUNGERICBs

It occurred in the City of Los

hugelee.
QUESTION:

Well, how many times do the police

examine garbage in Los Angeles?
MR. IUNGERICHs

I don’t have the statistics on that,

I was unable to locate any statistics on the number of times.
QUESTION:

Well, I still say, couldn't I assume

■that the police would not look into my garbage?
MR* XUNGBRICHs

I don't think it's a question of

whether you can assume that fch© police would not look into
your garbage, because, I think you could also assume that
there is a likelihood that the police would not search your
house, with or without a warrant.

Thera is also a strong

possibility that the police would not arrest you»

14
But I don't think that that necessa

1y shows that

you have a reasonable expectation of privacy»
The circumstances are under *—
QUESTION:

I don't know of any better act of privacy

than to have my garbage commingled with a thousand other
people

*s

garbage.
MR. XUNGERXCH: Well,

1

think what that proposition

ultimately leads to is that we create a constitutional
sanctuary for the disposal of evidence.

In other words, if a

man, for example, — and changing the facts of our case at this
point —* but assume the police had not received the telephone
call that they did but rather received a phone call from an
anonymous informant who said that the man who lived inside
this house had murdered his wife, and that they were unable
to verify that, but they did see the trash cans.

And assume

further that this man had dismembered his wife and put the
portiems of her body in brown butcher paper inside a can.
The police would than — would, under the circumstances of this case, if they attempted to look at the
contents in the well of the trash truck, would actually be
barred by a constitutional rule to the contrary to the
position that th© petitioner takas in this case, they would be
barred from ever reaching -that evidence, and this man would
be given a sanctuary for the disposal of this type of
evidence, and actually from the disposal of the body.

QUESTION? Well, 1 think v;e could decide this case
without allowing somebody to hide a dead body.
MR. 1UNGERICH:

Well, I don’t think that there —

that most — I don't think -the. ~~
QUE3TI0N; Well, why didn't the police look in the
cans themselves?
MR. IUNGERICH:

Well, I think that the police did

not look in the can bscuase they felt that perhaps if they
wesre aware of the Edwards decision that that might violate —
well, rather than -- -they wanted to get it as far removed
QUESTION:

I think you were right the first tx me.

MR. IUNGERICH : Well, I don’t think — there is the
possibility that if it were still on the curb there might be
a chance of it being within the curtilage,

tod X think to be

on the safe side, that the officers had the cans, you know,
had requested in this case that the cans be placed within the
well of the trash truck, where it was a clear situation.
tod I think the only thing I can say in this case
that could account for that is that it was good police work
rather than bad police work, in light of the decisions of
i ‘

this Court.
In other words, in this case the officers tried, as
best they could, to have the minimum possible intrusion,

tod

I don’t think that one, a man expects to have the right of
privacy in his garbage as a general male.

X would think, if

you would ask the general man on the street actually where
his garbage came to rest# he would probably tell you that he
didn't even care.

And I don't think that most of ns are

concerned about the disposition that takes place afterward.
We are concerned about privacy.
I think -the question also* as X pointed out, major
credit card companies advise their card holders to cut the
cards and to actually destroy the cards and mutilate them
before they go into the garbage can.

And X think that

proceeds on the inference that the public doesn’t expect
privacy, that the public expects today ~~ and colleges* for
examplef comb over garbage to find whether there’s recyclable
material? they expect the possibility of dogs or cats or
nosy neighbors to look inside the trash cans* and possibly
scavengers on the street.
And I think under these, circumstances, while there
may foe a subjective expectation among seme people * that there
is a privacy interest protected by the Fourth Amendment.
1 don't think that that is a reasonable expectation*

in light of the fact that the man has departed his control
over this particular item of property.

He has abandoned it.

He has done what is the classic definition of abandonment*
he has thrown it away.
X think that it is one thing to say that a man’s
home is his castle; it’s another thing to say that the garbage

17
dump is his castle*
QUESTIONS Well# let me bring you back to your
concessions, 1 think it was, a little while
cans were on the back porch the situation would be different*
MR. TUNGERXCHs
QUESTIONs

Yes, Your Honor.

But —

Well, who owns the curb on which these

cans were standing?
MR. IUNGERICH:

Wall, X don’t believe it’s clear

from-..the record in this case.

X am familiar with the rules

in bos Angeles, as far as setback regulations, and the county
or the city, in'this' ease, would own that property or have an
easeraent upon the property out in front, on the parkway*
X think, under the circumstances of this case,
however, we.have removed even from the point at which the
garbage was out at that point on the parkway, because the
ultimate examination which took place took place in the wall
of the trash truck a block away from the location.

So, X

think, at that point there’s no question that there was any
curtilage involved here, or protection of the area of the
i

«fomestic economy around the house.
I think, however, there’s still no question that
the property was abandoned.

If the police officers did look

into the trash cans at that point and did retrieve something
from the trash cans, that property was abandoned property
and, under the holding in the Abel case, it would ~~ if it rs

18

abandoned-, it would not — would be reasonable to appropriate
it,, as these officers did.
QUESTION? Are you saying that it is net abandoned
on the back porch, but it is abandoned on the curb?
MR. IUNGERXCH;

I’m saying that — yes, Your Honor.

I’1 m saying that if we assume that that is government land in
Sront, in other words —
QUESTION j

I thought you responded to Justice

Stewart by saying, yes, it's abandoned even when it's on the
i.-

porch, but it’s still in effect in his house, and therefore
protected by the explicit terns of the Constitution.
MR. iUNGERICHs

Yes, 1 think X made a slip of the

tongue here when 1 said that
it’s on the back porch.

it is abandoned at the point

And that is my position.

That there

may be some protection from the Fourth Amendment in the area
around the house or connected with the house at that point.
QUESTION: Also, X suppose, it's a factual inference
that it might be more conditionally abandoned.

Sometimes

people put things in the wastebasket and, while it's still
close to them, they decide to got it back out.
paper, for example,

Yesterday’s

They'll say, well, we put that in the

1 think that —

QUESTION:

Mr. lungerich, are you going to address

yourself* sometime during your argument? to the basis fes­
tae Supreme Court of California’s opinion as to whether it
did decide the case on a federal constitutional ground?
MR. IUNGE RICH:

Yes, Your Honor* I could do that

now.
QUESTION:

I was hoping you would come to it at

sometime in your argument.
MR. XUNGERICH: Weil* this question* I think* is
fairly clear from the —• this goes to the argument that
respondent ha3 made, that certiorari has been improvidently
granted* as I would understand Mr. Justice Relinquish.
Is that the question?
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. 2UNGERICH:

Well, X think it's clear from the

opinion that the California Supreme Court rested its decision
on thev Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments and not upon any
separate ground.

You find no mention of either Article I*

Section 19 of the California Constitution* which is the search

20
and seizure analog in the California Constitution, or to the
Cohan rule.
And 1 think the case is just clearly sot forth,
from the language of Mr. Justice Burke, that h© relied upon
the Edwards and Bradley decisions, which may be ambiguous,
but he said he relied on them only to the extent that they
relied upon like principles in Kafcs vs* united States.
And I think that there is no question from that that
he was relying on federal and not State law.
So, therefore, I think

There is a transcript of the proceedings.

Under what ground?

MR. IUNGERICHs

Well, under the circumstances, we

would have a clear ruling that it was not required under the
Federal Constitution.

which dealt with :t Federal Constitutional question dealing
with the Fifth Amendment.

Justice Trayhor in that opinion, said that:

compulsion from the Federal Constitution
QUESTION; Well, now, what about the difference
between the standing rule in search and seizure cases, as
announced in your Supreme Court and the Federal rule?

24
MR, IonesRtCH s

Yes

Well, most recently in the

Kaplan decision, in 6 Cal. 3d, the California court expressly
stated, and there’s a clear footnote in that opinion, which
states that they do not reach the question of whether that
standing rule is required under Article X, Section 19 of the
California Constitution.

They avoided the question entirely.

I don't think it was —
QUESTION: Well, on what did they predicate it?
MR. XURGERICH;

They predicated it on the fact

t.i i S l.

that this rule had continued since

they were relying on

the cahan days, and that they did not feel that since it had
been an established practice in California for such a long
period of time that it should be overturned.
And I think they distinguish in the opinion the
question of standing from a question of Fourth Amendment
protection.
QUESTION;

Now, your comparable Fourth Amendment

provision in the California Constitution literally tracks it,
it's not identical in phraseology with the Fourth Amendment,
is it?
MR. IUNGSRICHs

Constitution provision is virtually the same, what we say here
for the Federal Constitution goes for the State Constitution.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Thank you.
Mr. Hanson.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROGER S. HANSON, ESQ. ,
OKI BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR, HANSON: Thank you, Your Honor.
Chief Justice Burger, and may it please the Court:
I’ll pick up where Mr. lung®rich left off here,
because I think it’s important to this Court to realise
that this case, People vs. k ravel a f was the second California
garbage can decision.

The first case, People vs. Edwards,

?I Cal 2d 1096, dealt with a situation slightly different.
In Riverside County, California, which is a more rural type

28
of county, the police the police vaulted the back fence*! of a
home of the Edwardses, came upon their property, went into the
garbage can, that garbage can was setting on the back step.
In that particular case the California Supreme Court held,
five to two, specifically stating, under.Article I, Section
19 of the State Constitution, that it was an Illegal search and
seizure.

Also relying, of course, on the Fourth Amendment.
And I think in this particular case there is no

ambiguity whatsoever, and I would like to call the Court's
attention to my brief, starting on page 91, I have cited
verbatim the Edwards opinion, excerpts from the Edwards
opinion.

I’d like to simply call that to the Court's

attention, on page 92 of my brief.
It says?

Accordingly that search was unlawful under

the Fourth Amendment of the Federal Constitution.

It. similarly

violated Article I, Section 19 of the California Constitution.
The trial court thus erred in admitting the evidence found
in the trash can.

People vs. Edwards, 71 Cal 2d 1096, at

pages 1104 and 1105.
Now, in the Krivda decision.
QUESTION*

And Justice Burke wrote that opinion,

didn't ha?
MR. HANSONs

Yes, Justice Burke wrote that opinion.

Justice Burke also wrote the Krivda opinion.
Going over to page 93 of my brief, at page 367, the

29
California Court said, and X quote now from Krivda:
It is also clear, as in Edwards, that defendants’
reasonable expectation of privacy was violated by unreasonable
government .intrusion.

See People vs. Edwards, supra, 71 Cal 2d

1096, 1104 and 1105.
We should hesitate to encourage a practice whereby
our citisens' trash cans can be mace the subject of police
inspection without the protection of applying for and securing
a search warrant.
QUESTIONt

Mr. Hanson, you contend, I take it, that

it's patent that the Supreme Court of California relied on the
State grounds, your opposing counsel apparently contends that
it’s equally apparent that it relied on the Federal grounds.
If we should be in some doubt, wouldn't the natural
thing for us to do under the present would be to remand under
Minnesota vs. National Tea and that line of cases?
MR. HANSON i

Oh, I don’t think there’s any

■

ambiguity, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
QUESTION: Well, suppose we should conclude there is?
MR. HANSON: Well, I suppose —
QUESTION:
MR. HANSON:

Do like we did in Kirschner.
Well, that's within the decisions of

this Court, but 1 just don’t see -QUESTION:

But that's what they insisted, so that’s

why we did it in Kirschner.

30
MR, HANSON; Weil,

I’m

not familiar with Kirs diner,

I'll bs honest with the Court.
But in this particular case there's no question that
Biwards overtly was decided on Article I, Section 19 of the
California Constitution.
QUESTION;

Well, there seems to he no question, I

gather, that, not as overtly at least, the Krivda opinion makes
no reference to it.
MR. HANSON;

No, I disagree with that, because it

cites exact paginations where this decision is found, 1104 and
1105 of 71 Cel 2d 1036.
QUESTION: All right.
MR. HANSON;

Arid.

1

would appreciate the Court peruse

pages 92 and 33 of my brief.

I think it's as clear as a bell.

No question about it.
QUESTION;

You mean that, incorporates those very

discussions of the California grounds?
MR. HANSON: Very definitely.
QUESTION;

Very definitely.

Your position, the only way it could make

it clear, v?ouid have been to put the quotes in, in that.
That’s the only way.
MR. HANSON; Well, I don’t see how it could be —
QUESTION; And yet that’s not necessary once they
cifca the pages.
MR. HANSON:

That’s correct.

That's correct.

QUESTION: Could 1 ask you — you made the motion,
apparently, 'in the lower court?
MR. HANSON: Well, 1 was not trial counsel at that
time.
QUESTIONt

Did you know ~~ have you read the record?

MR. HANSON2
QUESTIONS

Ko, X haven’t.
You don't know, then, whether the State

ground was ever presented to the State Courts?
MR. HANSONt

No, I do not.

But it certainly was decided ■—*
QUESTION*

Let’s assume it was not,

MR. HANSON?

Well, I don't think that matters, I

think it’s what the California Supreme Court decided in this
case, and they decided it was illegal under the State
Constitution.
QUESTION: Well, you say, it's your argument that
they did

decide under the State Constitution, and yet they

didn't say so expressly.
there expressly.

You say they did, I don't see it in

But would it make any different in the

interpretation of their decision as to whether that ground
was even before the court?
MR. HANSON:
of this Court.

I don't think so, not in the opinions

I think in all fcha opinions of the Court,

ths Court simply goes to what the State Supreme Courts base
their opinion on.

And that's my understanding of reading the

32
Minnesota vs. National gea and so forth.
Now, in addition, I think that the second point is
it really doesn’t matter because under this Court’s decision
ia Cooper vs. California, which I have cited replately in
ray brief, it doesn’t make any difference because the State
Supreme. Court of California is permitted, as far as this Court
goes, to provide more stringent Fourth Amendment protection
than this Court is

3er the F

astituta

And I think impliedly, impliedly, the California Supreme
Court has given protection to the domestic garbage can.
Now, I'm familiar with the fact that the Supreme
Court of Wyoming and the Supreme Court of Oregon and several
of.the lower Federal courts have not gone along with protection
of domestic garbage cans.

But that is not material, because,

I think that Cooper vs. Californla stands as authority for
the fact that a Stata Suprema Court can give more rigid
Fourth Amendment protection to its citizens if it wishes to»
QUESTION:

But isn't that just the situation that

obtained in Kirschner and obtained in Minnesota vs. Rational
Tea?

This Court didn't question the fact that the State could

afford broader protection in the Federal Constitution, but we
fait it was unclear whether or not the State had felt
compelled by the Federal Constitution or was acting under its
own aegis.
MR. HANSON:"Well, all I can again certify to this

Court is that in the Krivda opinion it cited specifically
pages 1104 and 1105 of the Edwards decision, which was very
explicit on Article 2, Section 19 of the California
Constitution.
How, while it did not say we are going beyond the
Federal Constitution — I gree to that, if did not say that in
this opinion, that we are going beyond what the Federal
Constitution required in giving protection to this garbage
can, certainly impliedly that's what happened in this
particular case*.
The California Supreme Court, 2 think, is a very
erudite court.
closely.

It's a court that studios these things very

It is probably the loading State Supreme Court in

the United States,

And I think that these cases were very

thoroughly studied by that Court.

And it gave this protection.

How, one thing that I think is very important in
this decision is there has always been, from the point of view
of the State of California, that this property was abandoned.
Mow, it would be my contention, if it please the Court, that
th© concept of abandoned property deals with not Federal
matters»

It deals with what the Stato Supreme Court decides

constitutes abandonment in the State of California.
How, my opponent has cited in his brief certainly
Law Review articles.
York.

He cited the law of the State of Hew

The question is, what is the law of the State of

34
California concerned with abandonment?
I think, first of all, we’ve got to say that anybody
i

that really overtly places contraband in the trash can, or
deals with contraband, is vitally concerned with what happens
to.that property.
possession.

This is, after all, a prosecution for

tod if it’s a prosecution for possession, the

people are deemed to still have soma type of possessory
interest in this particular problem.
QUESTION;

Well, I thought the theory was only that

it was circumstantial evidence of the fact that they did have
possession.
MR. HANSONt
QUESTIONi

Well, surely; that’s correct.
Hot that they still possessed it when it

vias in the garbage can.
MR. HANSON? All right»
is:

Very well.

But the question

are they concerned as to what, happens to it and who

thereafter may get ahold of it?
And in our Supreme Court decision of People vs.
Irwin, which is 1 Cal 3d 423 opinion.

The Supreme Court of

California again says the following;

Abandonment is defined

as the voluntary giving up of a thing by the owner because he
no longer desires to possess it or to assert any right or
dominion over it — and now the important thing — and is
entirely indifferent as to what may become of it or as to who
may thereafter possess it.

35
I would suggest to this Court that if in fact we
have a foona fide dealing in contraband, anybody that does
that, if you're dealing in cocaine, you're dealing in heroin,
~~ and X deal with these people all the time out in California
in defending them
happens to it.

they are vitally concerned with what

And so undor the strict definition of abandon

mant, it has not been abandoned as defined by the California
Supreme Court.

And that is not, 1 would suggest to this

Court, a constitutional issue, which this Court may taka a
look at.
The question is, what has our State Supreme Court
said about it?

I say that they have said it is not abandoned

in this particular case.
Now, furthermore, the decisions of the California
Supreme Court, again in the field of search and seizure, in
our Marshall decision, at 69 Cal 2d. SI, and in our Magrue
decision, 1 Cal 3d 404, there is language in those decisions
that specifically preclude the going into closed, opaque
containers without a search warrant.

It is not confined to

containers within the home.
There is a triumvirate decision,
?
?
MagrueAft, so forth, in X Cal 3d, which proscribe going into
closed containers at airports.
So we have a closed garbage can here.

Not only do

we have a closed garbage can, but within that closed garbage
can we have closed, opaque brown bags.

And they could not have

<

36
gone in those bags without violating the California law,
without getting a search warrant.
Now, the fact that they didn't do that, cf course,
is because the garbage haulers, employed by the police as
police agents, the police told them exactly what, to do:
intercept the truck a block away from the house, go pick the
stuff up, make sure the well cf the truck is cleaned out so
there's no co-rcingling, take it a block away.

They directed

everything they did, and it's my contention that these garbagehaulers became police agents for the purpose of this particular
pickup.
QUESTION*

I think, Mr, Hanson, the Supreme Court

of California used the word "requested", didn't it, when it
spoke of the context between the police and the garbage
haulers?
MR. HANSON: Well, 1 don't know.

I'm sure that they

probably requested or demanded or commanded something of them.
I suppose it was a friendly confrontation.

I don’t know

exactly how it ~QUESTION*

You think there's no difference between

the word "commanded" and "requested"?
MR. HANSON*

Oh, I'm sure there is, usually a

difference in being "requested".

But, you know, garbage

haulers are generally not the most educated people, and they,
I think, are more compliant with the request of police.

I

37
don’t think they question anyting that they want them to do.
They went ahead and did this.

And I think, under the general

Stoner vs. California, and Chapman vs. United States rationale,
it is expected that a maid will clean your room, but it is not
expected she’s going to lead them on a tour of your
possessions.

When you rent a house, it’s expected that the

man. may come in to inspect the promises, but it’s not
expected that he’s going to bring the revenue agents in, under
Chapman, vs. United States.
2 think that is axiomatic in this particular case.
It is not expected that these garbage haulers are going to
comply with a request of the police department.
Now, furthermore, —*
QUESTIONS
there.

Mr. Hanson, lot me just interrupt you

Your opposition, the Attorney General, in his reply

brief, contends that a City of bos Angeles ordinance exempts
city officers, such as policemen, from the general prohibition
against tampering with garbage containers.

Do you agree

with that interpretation of that ordinance?
MR, HANSON:

No, no, definitely not.

X think the

Court’s attention must be referred to Section 6603 of the
City Code, and Section 6620 of the City Code.

Now, if it be

contended that officers arc exempted, they’re certainly
employees of the City, and Section 6629 3aye this, it sayss
No employee of this city shall remove or dispose of, for said

38
employee's benefit or use, any of the contents of any vessel,
tank, or receptacle used for the collection or removal or
disposal of rubbish.
So X think — first of all, I'm not conceding
whatsoever that an officer in the context that's react the.ro is

I think that's a garbage officer of come

does, at all.

I don't think it

And, anyway, they’re employees, and so

•Section 6629 does not permit them to do this.
While in general I admit the rationale of this
Court in Abel, but, nonetheless, in California vs.- Krivda we
have a very heavy regulation on California garbage, very
heavily regulated, and it just absolutely preludes this
particular behavior that took place in this case,

ibid not

only does the municipal county ordinances preclude it, but
they, taken in context with the Ninth and Tenth Amendments
to the 0. S, Constitution, suggest to me that where the States
have not overtly legislated and where the federal government
has not overtly legislated, then it is up to the citizens,
acting through their municipalities, to legislate.

And these

statutes actually absolutely preclude this type of
confiscation of the garbage can.
Now, those are the threshold laws, and I would like

39
now to address myself to the merits of the case.
Anybody that says* in recognising the certified
question/ the certified question that earns up to this Court
was whether there is *— whether anybody who takes contraband
and puts it in a garbage can and puts that curbside exhibits
a reasonable expectation of privacy, that that garbage will
not be viewed in the well or the bin of the garbage truck
some distance away from pickup and prior to co-mingling„
Now* I have a little garbage truck here, which 1
purchased over in Virginia yesterday* and this little garbage
truck is one exactly like we have in California* and to
insure that the Court understands what California garbage
trucks look like* this is what they talk about when they
say the well of the truck.

This is the well of the truck

back here.
And* characteristically* these trucks move around
the streets in California* and they have a very heavy
schedule, to meet* a lot of homes to meet* and there will b©
a man ''standing on the back of this truck and a man driving
the truck, and they will drive up to a home, this man will
jump off the back of the truck* he will take the cans, he
will up-end them into the well* he will hit a hydraulic
button and within two or three seconds it is elevated into
the truck.
the truck

Within two or three seconds it is elevated into

40
There is absolutely no opportunity, no practical
opportunity at all for this to be viewed in the well of the
truck.

This is a very smelly placa, it is covered with dust,

when they dump these cans in here, there is an emanation of
dust that comes out of the end of it.

I would suggest to this

Court that it is not practically nor reasonably to expect
that anybody is going to view what's going on in the well of
that truck.
That button is hit, it is gone in three seconds, and
actually, even though this model of the truck has the top of it
gone, the California garbage truck is closed there, and this
garbage disappears into that truck within the twinkling of an
eye, and nobody ©ver sees it again until it's out to the
dump. And in California, ons of the big uses of garbage is
for land fills.

We have a .lot of mountains out there, and

they are dumped in mountains, and they're covered over by

bulldozers.
Now, I have a move with me, and if the Court would
take a look at it before this Court decides this case *— it
is two minutes and 5? seconds, it is a totally unrehearsed
movie, which is in color, in 16 millimeter, and it shows

MR. HANSON: Well, I thought it would help the Court
to confirm my contentions as to how California garbage is
picked up.
If the Court.would view it, I'd appreciate it.
One of the things that I think is very important hare
is that really the California citizen operates under a
contract of adhesion, really:
garbage any other way.

he cannot got rid of the

You can5t burn California garbage.

You can’t do anything like that, because of the smog levels
out there.

The only thing you can do, if you want to get

rid of it at all, is carry it out to the curbside.

You can’t

leave it behind your house, because if you do they won’t
pick it up.
You may be able to do that in some of the small
towns, I don’t know; but in the City of Los Angeles, the only
way you can get rid of it, and it’s covered by these
statutes in my brief, is to carry it out to the. curbside.
And the California Supreme Court, even in its

dissent, in its three-man dissent in the Krivda case.
recognised -the right of privacy in that can when it was on the
back step of the home.
But somehow, and I contend this is an intellectual
non sequiturr they seem to lose three votes when it was
carried out to the curb, and I don't understand that, because
this is what people have to do*

If you did not do that, you

would have the home being engulfed by garbage, because you'd
never get rid of it.

You have to carry it out to the curb

to gat rid of it.
My clients were doing only what they had to do in
order to get riel of this.
We have a very regulated situation in California,
and I don't think that these people can be held to have given
up any right of privacy simply because they had to carry this
can out to the curbside in order to get rid of it.
So, therefore, in my opinion, there is no distinguishmerit between the Edwards case and the Krivda case in the State
of California.
Wow, 1' think also of great importance is the
following:

is there a possibility of detecting contraband

undes? such circumstances?
drug cases.

I defend in California a lot of

I have never seen, never seen at all, even

licensed chemists who were able to detect contraband without
doing analysis.

And I'm talking here about marijuana and

pills and so forth? you can't tell the majority of white
pills from aspirin tablets.

So, therefore, you have a

university“trained chemist who has to make quite extensive
tests to detect contraband, and therefore I would contend that
the average person, who would have a split-second chance to
view contraband in the well of this garbage truck, would have
no chance, no chance at all, to detect it whatsoever.

You

could not possibly detect it.
QUESTIONi

Mr. Hanson, where did you say the

garbage ultimately goes in Los Angeles?

It goes to a landfill, Mr.. Justice

realisation as to what takes place in California garbage deep:;:.

marijuana* do you equate that to abandonment?
MR. HANSON:

No* I don’t.

1 equate this to a

requirement as to how you have to dispose of something* and
not
QUESTION: What's the difference between getting rid
of something and abandonment?
MR. HANSON: Well* under the general idea of
abandonment* as far as I’m concerned* abandonment would be
just some free will* free desire to get rid of something.
Here you have a very regulated way that you have to do it.
You're disposing of something pursuant to statute* pursuant
to statute.

You can't do it any other way in California.

Unless you want to got in the business yourself»
QUESTION:

You don’t know of any other way to get

rid of a marijuana pot than to put it in the garbage?
MR. HANSON:

Yes* I think you could flush that down

the toilet* or* as some poopl® do who are kind of hard-pressed
for it? they’ll roll- it over again in a new cigarette.

I think

46
you could do that.

But I don’t know, I've never fooled with

it myself, other than to represent these people.

But I’m

told that they will recycle their marijuana into new
cigarettes when it gets down to the end.
Now, one thing, I think, that we've got to distinguis
here is *— I’m sure the State of California is probably not
suggesting widespread indiscriminate searching of garbage
cans.

If they are, X would contend, as I have in my brief,

that this is a mathematical impossibility.

It’s a statistic

impossibility, that there is just no possibility that this
is going to be successful, when you talk about the number of
polios that can be devoted to it versus the number of garbage
cans p
So, therefore, we have to talk about a situation
where there's some type of information, some type of
premonition that a can contains contraband, and in those
particular circumstances I contend that the search warrant

is the preferred way*

-i .
«

Agalar vs. Texas, Pinelly va. United

States, Whiteley vs. Warden of Wyoming Stata Prison, all the
various decisions of this Court, which actually require —
and I suggest also Coolidge vs. New Hampshire.

As I read

Coolldge, in the 91 Supreme Court Edition 2022, at page 2047,
this Court has restricted the particular ways of seising
•things any more to either a search warrant or as incident
to a lawful arrest.

47
So instead of trying to muddy up the water's,
instead of trying to complicate the field of o-aarch and
seizure, this Court hao simplified it by curtailing the means

by which somebody can seise something.
So 1 think there's just a host of decisions going
to the merits of the case# going to the law of California,
going to the decision of the California Supreme Court,
invoking Article X, Section 19, in the Edwards case, and
incorporating that in the Kri.vda case, would just absolutely
preclude this type of thing from happening.

And I think the

decision of this Court should be nine to nothing affirming
the opinion of the California Supreme Court in this
particular case.
X just can't see how it can be anything else, under
the various things that have happened in this particular case
QUESTION:

Well# if the opinion of the Supreme

Court of California rests on a State law ground, we wouldn't
affirm it# would we?
MR. HANSONi
QUESTION:
MR. HANSON:
QUESTION:

You mean —*
It's none of our business.
— you'd dismiss it for want of —
We wouldn't affirm it, we wouldn't

reverse it; that's a matter for the State.
MR, HANSON: Well# that may be true —
QUESTION:

Jankovich# you cite the Jankovich case

MR, HANSON;

Indiana Toil Road? Jankovich, yes,

QUESTION; We dismissed it, didn't we?
MR, HANSON;

Right,

Correct.

Now, I think there's one other area I want to touch
on in the closing minutes here.
X think there is a very pragmatic situation in thio
particular cas©»

I think that if this Court worag at al.*

sanction a search of garbage cans, it is an avenue to open
up swsrovs areas of fraud, because a garbage can, as this
Court, I think, can almost take judicial notice, can be
loaded by somebody who wants to gat rid of somebody else.
If I want to get rid of my neighbor, 1 go and deposit
marijuana in the can, I make an anonymous phone call to the
police department, I say, Mr. Jones at 123 Main Street has
marijuana in the garbage can.

Boom, they come over, they

descend on the can, they search it, and they find marijuana;
and he's off to the pokey.
And if you don’t think it’s difficult to defend
these drug cases in California, why, you’ve got another think
a-ccming, because X do it all day and it’s very emotionally
laden, and it’s very difficult to get these people off if
caught in any way with narcotics, before a jury.
that they’re guilty, there's no way you can do it.

They thxnK
And X

would suggest that if this Court in any way gives any
credence to the desires of the California Attorney General,

49
we have some problems.

We have some severe problems in this

particular case.
I think also — I think also we have the. final
threshold question as to the right of privacy of pec;-.

t.c

live their lives» to dispose of their life's tracings, if it
might foe birth control residue or if it might foe a particular
liquor that they want to use or something» I think that it is
a severe encroachment upon their right of privacy» if this
Court would in any way suggest that the California police
should be given the right to indiscriminately search these

cans.
Citing Griswold vs. Connecticut» I think that, the
birth control privacy of the bedroom should be extended to
getting rid of that birth control material out into the
garbage can.

And also I think there is a severe equal

protection problem» because if this whole matter depends on
where that can might be setting» or whether he might ba
living in a rural area» residential area» I think it's a
refinement that we don’t want to go into.
Many people live in huge apartment houses» where
there is co-mingling in a huge trash can.

There you don't

have the problem, because it'3 initially co-mingled, but if
you don't have the situation wher© you're living under a
circumstance lik© that, where you're living in a private home,
of course, then you have to comply with the regulations of

so
tlie County of Los Angeles and -the City of Los Angeles in how

you gat rid of this material*
QUESTIONS

So the whole Fourth Amendment, its

applicability depends inevitably upon sometimes very subtle
nuances and differentiation of fact? doesn’t it?
MR. HANSON: Certainly it does.

I recognise that.

Now? no one has said in argument yet about the
general attach on Mapp vs. Ohio? but in the couple of minutes
I have left? assuming my opponent is going to allude to it
in his closing argument? I think that somebody of my
particular educational status is not going to? in the few
minutes? in any way attempt to overcome the scholars of the
last fifty years who have considered? debated? discussed?
published Law Review articles by the thousands on the
exclusionary rules*

I think that the State of California is

now in a position where? frankly? there has been an addition
of four new members to this Court, and X think they feel that
they can take a new shot at the exclusionary rule.

And

1 would suggest to this Court that this Court should not
lightly consider an assault on this rule.
There is really no other practical way? no other
practical way.

Some people may say:

civil rights suit.

pursue a 42 USC 1983

But X would suggest to this Court that

if somebody is caught with a bunch of cocaine and it is
shown to be an illegal seizure? but because you can’t exclude

51
it, the man is convicted? he doss maybe ten years, he makes
$50?000 a year selling cocaine? he brings a civil rights suit
to recover $50,000 times ten years, or $500,000, what jury —
what jury in the United States would give him ten cents?

A man

who is dealing in cocaine brings a civil rights suit to
recover money because he's been illegally searched and seised,
can anybody, in their wildest imagination, suggest that that
man would get any money?
I don’t think so.
There really is practically no relief under 1903
of the C^il Rights Act.
Some people may suggest, well# we should discipline
the police*

X don’t think this is practical# X think this

las been hashed and rehashed for years.

It is not a practical

way of handling it.
The only way it can be done is by this exclusionary
rule, and I think that the scholars the last fifty years#
emanating from Weeks vs. United States on down through Mapp
vs. Ohio, have so considered# and there just is really no
other way of doing it.
If the State of California is really sincere in
this, I would suggest that this Court may give some credence to
a parallel type of relief along with this exclusionary rule,
to see how it works.
X think Mr. Chief Justice Burger, in the Bivens vs.

Six Agents of the Federal Bureau j>f Narcotics , expressed a
reluctance to throw away the exclusionary rule until an
alternate could be selected*
So 2 think that if there is any credence to be giver,
to an alternate, let it go in a parallel manner to the
exclusionary rule, and let's all investigate and sae what
happens *
1 would suggest that the exclusionary rule would
probably still be in effect, because the alternates are
merely shams, that, they really will not work too well.
California talks about restricting it to substantial
violations, and I would suggest that we're getting into
replete additional things which are going to bo more complicate!
because then you're going to. have to decide whether there is
a reasonable or unreasonable search, where it has already bean
held to be somewhat unreasonable.
I think you're going to have nuances on nuances
on this particular thing, to the point where anybody that
would want it to happen would give up in despair on it.
Sven in the Amicus Curiae briefs, the reasons for
doing away with it, the Americans for Effective Law Enforce­
ment present statistics which show that the police are
doing so well that in 84 percent, six out of seven cases,
the attack on the search and seizure has been upheld as
being correct

On the other hand, California, in its brief, says,
Well, the thing is so complicated, our police eraft understand
.. ,?.
«A» v*. l-

1 think that and that alone is reason for a
disinterested, neutral magistrate, who’s had training in law,
to set and decide if it’s legal or illegal.
Illinois says, and I'd hesitate to admit it, that
their police are lying so badly, every time they get caught
and they’re challenged by a judge, why, they would be -prone
to lie in order to get the evidence in.
Well, I would suggest to the State of Illinois that
if, in fact, that's their admission, that they ought to try
and curtail the police from lying and go on the same rule that
everybody else goes*

that a judge is supposed to decide this.
