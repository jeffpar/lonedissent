PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No. 71-1^28, Hensley v. Municipal Court.
Mr. Bass, you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STANLEY A. BASS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BASS:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
This case is here on certiorari to the United
States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit which
affirmed the dismissal of a writ of habeas corpus.

The

District Court, in dismissing the petition, did not reach
any substantive issues, but denied the petition on the sole
ground that the petitioner, being enlarged on his own
recognizance by the state trial judge pending the outcome
of the federal habeas proceeding, was not in custody for the
purposes of the federal habeas statute.
The issue presented is whether or not a federal
habeas judge is without power to entertain a petition for
the writ until the state criminal defendant, who is
sentenced to imprisonment

surrenders into jail

where the

defendant has exhausted his available state court remedies
and has been permitted by the very judge who imposed the
sentence to remain at large pending the outcome of the
federal habeas proceedings.

4
The background facts will be briefly as follows:
Petitioner Hensley is the Chief Presiding Officer
of the Universal Life Church v/hich has awarded Honorary
Doctor of Divinity degrees.

He was charged with violating

a California misdemeanor provision which prohibited the
awarding of degrees which signify academic accomplishment
without meeting accreditation requirements.
held on May 19th, 1969-

The trial was

At the close of the state’s case,

the defendant moved to dismiss.

The court held that it

lacked jurisdiction in the state or further proceedings.
Subsequently, the state moved to reopen the case.
Mr. Bienvenue, the defendant's counsel at that time,
declined to appear at the reopening.

He advised the

prosecutor that neither he nor Hensley would appear.
However, the traverse in this case states that
Hensley was never advised by Mr. Bienvenue that he had to
appear or that his failure to appear would result in
conviction.
One the contrary, he says he was advised that the
trial was dismissed and that he need not appear further.
Q

Is that still relevant to us?

MR. BASS:

That may be relevant insofar as we deal

with his status, at least on recognizance or Vfhether or not
there has been a deliberate bypass.

I think it may not be

relevant, however, it is offered in case questions do arise

5
with respect to that but the court held in defendant's
absence that the court had jurisdiction and it found the
defendant guilty in absentia and on July 1st, 1969, one-year
imprisonment was imposed plus a $625 fine in course and at
that time the state trial judge granted a stay and allowed
the defendant to remain on his own recognizance pending
appeal.
Subsequently, the conviction was affirmed.

The

state trial judge permitted Hensley to remain on OR pending
the exhaustion of state plus conviction remedies which were
habeas corpus in the district court of appeal and in the
California Supreme Court.
Then, on June 16th, 1970, Hensley filed his federal
habeas.

On the same day, the state trial judge granted a

stay, an additional stay, permitting him to remain at large
pending the determination of the federal habeas application.
The federal habeas corpus judge found that -— or
ruled that the — Hensley was not in custody because he was
on recognizance and he denied the petition.

However, he

granted a certificate of probable cause and the court of
appeals affirmed.

The rehearing was denied.

A timely

petition for cert was filed and this Court granted cert.
Q

Mr. Bass, as a practical matter, is this

about the only factual situation in which the federal habeas
petitioner will have exhausted state remedies and still be

6
free on his own recognisance?

I would think during the course

of his appeal in state courts, for example.» he can't get
federal habeas because he hasn't exhausted his state remedy
and that it might be a fairly limited situation in which this
type of thing would occur.
MR. BASS:

Well, we don't get into the question

as to whether or not the state remedies ar*e so ineffective
as to protect the rights of the petitioner, but we have a
question under 225*J.
Here, since Hensley was permitted to remain at
large by the state trial judge, he exhausted all his stateremedies without the problem of his having to surrender and
the sentence running and the question possibly becoming moot.
Here, the issue was preserved because at all times
he was permitted to remain in his recognizance by the state
trial judge.
The important factor to note is that the state
trials judge permitted Hensley to remain on his recognisance
may well have felt that Hensley’s failure to appear at trial
was not intentional and would have a bearing at such time as
the federal court reaches the question of deliberate bypass.
But it would appear that by releasing him —

In the record.

The point here is that the record needs to be

developed before the judge can make a finding that there has
been an intentional relinquishment of federal constitutional
right.

One cannot conclude there is a bypass on this record.
Q

And what is the point you raise on this

federal habeas corpus?
MR. BASS:

Well, the issue at this time is the

custody question but the underlying constitutional questions
asserted in the petition relate to freedom of religion and
Fourteenth Amendment due process.
Q

Freedom of religion?

MR. BASS:

Fourteenth Amendment due process in

that he was convicted in absentia and he is also arguing that
he was engaging in constitutionally-protected activity.
Because he did not have an opportunity to present a defense
in the state court, no record was made of the First Amendment
position.
Q

Why didn’t he have the opportunity to present

it in the state court?
MR. BASS:

That was due to a combination of factors,

part of which was the alleged inadvertence or Incompetence
of counsel in not telling Hensley that he had to appear,
otherwise he would lose his opportunity to make defense.
Q

It is

That point was raised on direct appeal with

competent counsel?

MR. BASS:

It was raised in the state habeas corpus.

Yes.

Do I understand you to have answered to

Justice Marshall that the state appeal had been affirmed?
MR. BASS:

The state appeal was affirmed, yes.

Q

conviction was affirmed on appeal?

The

MR. BASS:
Q

Yes, your Honor.

Do I also understand you to intimate there is

no Younger against Harris issue in this context at. all?

Is

this your position?
MR. BASS:

That is correct.

This is riot a situation

where he seeks to abort a state prosecution.

He had already

been tried and sentenced and has exhausted what would be all
of the available state court remedies in California.
Q

But you are

in federal court before that

exhaustion was completed, are you not?
MR. BASS:

No, he has exhausted.

He has tendered to

the state courts in his state habeas petitions the issues that
he seeks to raise here.
Q

Was this tender not made — I may have my

facts wrong — was all this tender not made even to the

10
federal court while the state appeal was still pending

and

undecided?
MR. BASS:

The timing on this is that he filed an

appeal from the conviction.

That appeal was affirmed.

He

then raised on petition for rehearing or for certification
the issues of lack of adequate representation and conviction
in absentia.

That was denied.

He then filed habeas in the

district court of appeals in California.

That was denied.

He then filed an original habeas in the California Supreme
Court.

That was denied.
Q

All of this after the appeal from the

conviction had come down?
MR. BASS:

Yes.

Then, subsequently, in June of

1970 he filed a federal habeas after there were no other
procedures available in the state.
Q

What do you see as hopeful in dealing within

the federal habeas corpus proceeding now?
MR. BASS:

The first issue I would think that the

federal habeas judge would entertain is the question of
deliberate bypass as to whether or not the petitioner Hensley
intentionally relinquished his opportunity to appear and to
raise any defense and Fourteenth Amendment due process.
It would appear that the First Amendment issue
might not be reached until the Fourteenth Amendment question
as to whether or not Hensley deliberately absented himself

11
from the state trial court \^?ould be resolved.
q

Mr. Bass, I think my confusion arises from

this, he was sentenced to a year in jail, was he not, In
addition to a fine?
MR. BASS:
Q

Yes.

Has he ever served any part of that time?

MR. BA.SS:
Q

Not to my knowledge.

I think he has not.

Well, this is where I am confused.

Why

wasn't he incarcerated when his appeal was affirmed?
MR. BASS:

Because the state trial judge continually

granted stays, keeping Mr. Hensley on recognisance.

He

granted about four stays.
Q

While these petitions were pending state and

federal?
MR. BASS:

applications.
corpus.

The 3tate trial judge granted a stay

He granted another stay pending state habeas

He granted another stay pending a federal habeas

And after the federal habeas was denied, he granted a

stay for about two weeks at which point Mr. Justice Black
granted an eight-day stay.

Mr. Justice Douglas granted a

two-week stay and then a stay pending an appeal to the court
of appeals for the Ninth Circuit was granted.
Q

Well, he has been very generously treated,

hasn't he?
MR. BASS:

Except for the fact that he is going to

12

serve one year In jail if he does not get federal habeas
corpus relief.

The basis of our argument is that the term

,!in custody" used by Congress relates to the class of cases,
not the timing as to when the petition must be filed.
The state’s argument here is not based upon any
legitimate needs or federal judicial administration;

it is

not based upon any lav/ enforcement needs, but is based
strictly upon an outmoded conceptual definition.
In this case, if the habeas petition is not
committed to be filed while he is on recognizance, he will
file it when he is in custody.

There will be the same

number of federal habeas petitions.

There will not be an

increase in the federal case load.
Secondly, if he is not permitted to file the habeas
while he Is on recognizance, and must go into jail, there
will be more pressure on the district court to move more
quickly to hear the case whereas if he is on recognizance
granted by the state trial judge, the federal court can hear
the thing in a more leisurely fashion.
As this court pointed out in Peyton versus Rowe, it
is in everyone's Interest to hear the habeas corpus
application.

It is in the state's interest.

petitioner's interest.

It is in the

It i3 in the court's Interest.

In

fact, it will cost the state money to incarcerate this person
unnecessarily, perhaps, if it turns out that the federal rights

13
are involved, it will be irretrievably lost.
There is absolutely no reason to commend the result
urged by the state in this case.

In Peyton versus Rowe, this

court allowed the use of anticipatory attack upon a future
sentence.

In Jones versus Cunningham, it was unnecessary to

wait until parole was revoked before Jones could bring the
habeas.

In Strait versus Laird it x*as unnecessary to wait

until the servicemen were reactivated before he could bring
his conscientious objector application.
In this case, we deal not with the question of a
district court's discretion but simply with a question of
power.

There is no need here, for example, for the federal

court to determine if bail should be granted because the
state trial judge has already granted the stay while he
exhausts the federal habeas.
This is the reverse situation of the case in the
California Supreme Court called In Re Smiley.

There, a

federal court granted own recognizance release and the
California Supreme Court said that they had jurisdiction to
grant habeas relief.

They said if they had the authority

to release the person there was no reason why it would be
unreasenable for them to say they lacked the authority merely
because someone else had done it for them.
Q

Are you suggeting the federal habeas corpus

In practical effect.

MR. BASS:
Q

Well, of course that issue is —

In your point of viexv.

MR. BASS:

— is not presented now, Mr. Chief

Justice but it would appear to me that if the case is
remanded back to the district court, the first question that
the district court would have to answer is whether or not
Hensley made a deliberate
Q

A deliberate bypass, but after you cross

that?
MR. BASS:

After we cross that, the question then

is whether or not he was deprived of the effective
assistance of counsel by losing his right to present
substantial statutory as well as constitutional defenses.
It is a serious question as to whether or not the California
statute applies to a church granting honorary Doctor of
Divinity degrees and that issue was never litigated because
he did not have the opportunity to appear and timely raise It.
So —
Q

Under whose jurisdiction is the man now?

MR. BASS:

Under the jurisdiction of the municipal

court.
Q
in California.

Does that last forever?

I thought it is

Doesn’t he lose jurisdiction at the end of

a term or at the end of some time?

15
MR. BASS:

Excuse me. your* Honor, I thought you

meant with respect to the stay that was granted.
Q

Well, if he Isn’t under somebody’s juris­

diction, how do you get habeas corpus?
MR. BASS:

Well, he — he is under the imminent

control of the sheriff, who would be the person who runs the
local jail to whom he would have to surrender.
Q

li/hat does he have to do for the sheriff?

MR. BASS:

He has to surrender as soon as the stay

expires.
Q

What is he doing for the sheriff right now?

MR. BASS:

Nothing, but, however, there is an

interesting parallel between this situation and the situation
of Jones versus Cunningham where this court pointed out that
Jones could be rearrested at any time that a parole officer
felt that he violated his parole.

Under the California

statute, the OR recognizance could be revoked, presumably
without the same type of procedural due process as a trial
and Hensley could be taken any day if it were not for the stay.
Q

Taken by whom?

MR. BASS:

By the sheriff and incarcerated in his

jail.
Q

Well, is it contempt not to show up?

MR. BASS:

It constitutes — well, it could

constitute a contempt.

It certainly constitutes a separate

16
crime.
Q

Is it a crime not to show up?

MR. BASS:

Oh, yes.

In California it is a crime.

It constitutes a separate offense and if he is caught out­
side the jurisdiction, extradition is automatically waived.
Under those circumstances it is not shared by the
public.
Q

Yes, it sets him

off from other people

fairly well.
MR. BASS:

We

submit that it is a very real

difference.
Q

He doesn’t have to report to anybody.

It

is nothing like probation or parole, is it?
MR. BASS: It Is not like parole in the sense that
he doesn’t have to report.
Q
It is not like probation.
MR. BASS:

On the other hand, in the sense that it

can be taken away so easily, without notice, perhaps ■—
Q

But he isn’t under any custody at all.

MR. BASS:

He is under the Imminent incarceration,

the threat of incarceration is at any time.
Q

What is the difference between him and the

man that is indicted?
MR. BASS:

Well, the man who is indicted can’t

bring habeas because the man hasn’t exhausted state court
remedies.

17
Q

So he —

MR. BASS:
Q

Hensley has run the string out.

Well, what is the difference between that?

If he is on his own recognisance that can be revoked tomorrow
morning, can’t it?
MR. BASS:
Q

Of course.

But he can’t get habeas.

MR. BASS:
state court remedies.

Well, because he hasn't exhausted his
The doctrine of prematurity would take

care of cases like that.
Q

I suppose the restraints imposed upon him are

listed fully in the first paragraph of your argument on page *
MR. BASS:
Q

Those are taken from the statute.

They are indeed, and more than fully because

you talk about, in some Jurisdictions territorial and super­
visory restrictions are also Imposed which implies that that
is not true —
MR. BASS:
Q

That’s true.

In California.

MR. BASS:

That is true that it is not, but we

don't think that the absence of territorial restrictions is
that meaningful.

If one looks at Strait versus Laird, for

example —
Q

Well, I thought you said the only restriction

was that he could be picked up.

Is that what you said?

18
MR. BASS:
Q

That is not the only restriction.

Is that what you said in response to my

answer or not?
MR. BASS:

That — that is the only restriction

that is present in the sense that the restriction that he
has to serve a year would be termed to be in future.

Howevers

that may be just a metaphysical way of looking at it because
it may be that — maybe that’s tomorrow that he has to serve
that year.
Q

What other restriction is he under?

MR. BASS:

The restrictions are — well, as the

California statute points out, he Is required to appear when­
ever the judge requires him to come in and that in default
he waives extradition, that it is an offense if he doesn’t
show up.
Q

Is that any different from being picked up?

MR. BASS:

Well, he has got an outstanding

detainer, a one-year sentence.
Q

I am saying, he can be picked up and put In

jail.
MR. BASS:
Q
than that?

Yes.

Now what other else can be done to him, other
Nothing.

MR. BASS:
Q

Well, he owes a fine.

Well, what about the turn-up on the fine?

19
MR. BASS:

Well, I don’t think he is ordered to

stand committed in default of payment, but we think that the
fact that he owes that one-year sentence —
Q

Is your argument restricted to men who have

been convicted?
MR. BASS:
Q

Yes.

Right?

MR. BASS:

Yes, my argument is restricted to men

who have been convicted and who have been sentenced to —
Q

And who have exhausted their state remedies.

MR. BASS:

Arid who have exhausted state remedies.

We don’t deal with the situation —
Q

All I am trying to suggest is, don't load

anything more on that cart.
MR. BASS:

Right.

I'm not dealing with the

situation of a person who is merely fined.

I am not dealing

with the situation of a person who has already served a
sentence and who just complains about the

civil disabilities

that come from conviction because this situation Involves the
most graphic type of deprivation, namely imprisonment and the
Court need not reach the other question, particularly the
question raised in the United States ex rel Meyer versus Well,
which is the seventh circuit case where the Supreme Court
denied cert last month.
Q

And what was involved in that case?

20

MR. BASS:
habeas.

In that case, the person had filed a

The seventh circuit said he was not in sufficient

custody.

The problem was he had posted ten percent under the

Illinois statute which could have been set off against

was no anticipatory Incarceration possible.
Whereas, of course, in this case that one year is
staring him in the face and if he doesn’t get relief from the
federal habeas court, he will be in jail.
And, of course, if he was in jail, every day that
he suffers in jail that may turn out to be unconstitutionally
imposed will be irretrievable.

He will never be able to

get anything out of that.
Moreover, If we are dealing with case3 involving
very short sentences —
Q

That is the fate of almost all habeas

petitioners, isn’t

it?

It is almost fortuitous that the

state court here happened to grant bail because ordinarily a
federal habeas court won’t grant bail pending its own
decision as to whether the state conviction is valid.
MR. BASS:

Well, I don’t know about probabilities.

This Court in Shuttlesworth did state that the federal court
had the power to do that.

It is true that in this case the

state court must have thought enough about the issues and

21
perhaps Hensley’s nondangerousness to allow him to remain on
a. recognisance for such a long period of time and whether
this be considered a charitable or just what is legally
necessary3 the fact of the matter is that he has not been
recalled.

He could be.
Q

But the great majority of your habeas

petitioners are in jail and serving time that might be held
invalid by the federal habeas court, are they not?
MR. BASS:

Yes, but the situation we deal with

here is that the state judge had granted the stay.

Under

such circumstances we find that there would be no reason why
the federal judge should deny or eschew power to hear when
the very reason for the state court allowing the man to stay
out is so the federal Judge can hear the petition without
being presented with stay applications or other types of
emergency requests for immediate relief.
Q

Well, couldn't it be said equally that the

state judge was simply being appropriately deferential to
the fact that a petition was filed, not to anything more than
that?
MR. BASS:

Well, I don't think, Mr. Chief Justice,

that state court is required under any consideration of
supremacy or federalism to grant such a stay.

It would

seem to be entirely a matter of discretion and if he decides
not to grant the stay then the petitioner would have to ask

22

the district court for that stay, but that was unnecessary in
this case because the state granted it.
Q

Mr. Bass, does the record show affirmatively

that the purpose of allowing Mr. Hensley to remain on bail
was to enable him to file a petition of habeas corpus?
MR. BASS:

The pertinent provisions of the record,

Mr. Justice Powell, page 12-A, paragraph eight, the — of the
return to the order of the show cause, the state indicates
he is at liberty on his own recognisance pending the outcome
of this habeas corpus proceeding and on page 19-A of the
record, it indicates that that stay was granted by Judge
Nelson who is the judge of the
Q

municipal court.

We have a non sequitur in paragraph eight,

unless I am reading too fast.

The state concedes — this Is

the state's return, isn’t it?

The warden's return.

MR. BASS:
Q

Yes.

Or whatever, the municipal court.

He is

out on his own recognisance pending the outcome of this
habeas corpus proceeding.

Therefore, this court is not in

a position to here consider a grant, a writ of habeas
corpus.
MR. BASS:
Q

I realize this.

What does the "therefore" mean?

MR. BASS:

It sounds extremely illogical because the

whol pui'pose of granting the stay was to allour him to do it

23

and now by the state judge having allowed him to do that*
then the federal judge says he can’t do that.

There is a

certain —
Q

Perhaps Judge Nelson wasn’t

as friendly to

you as you thought.
MR, BASS:

Oh, I think perhaps he was.

But I was

going to suggest that I did have copies, actual copies of the
stay order granted by the 3tate court.

If the Court would

\*ish, I could leave copies with the Clerk of the Court.
Q

I believe the statement that has application

in the second sentence of paragraph is not saying any more
than it is saying in this court, that, absent custody, no
habeas corpus jurisdiction.
MR, BASS:

Isn't that all they are saying?

That Is true, that is what they are

saying but the juxtaposition of the two sentences, perinaps
better than anything, demonstrates the illogic of their
position.
Q

Mr. Bass, does the court order which you

mentioned shed any light on the question as to what the
reason for granting the stay was?
MR. BASS:

No, Mr. Justice Powell.

The order

granted by the state court is a one-page order.

It simply

says it is ordered that the sentence given to the petitioner
Is identified.

It is hereby stayed pending determinaton

of the petitioner’s writ of habea corpus in the United States

district court, northern district of California.
We would submit that in view of the fact that the

ritual that Congress could not have intended, in view of the
fact that it serves no legitimate purpose, it does not serve
judicial administration.
interests.

It does not serve the state’s

It certainly does not serve the petitioner's

interest to be incarcerated under such circumstances before
he can file where in fact, we have imprisonment, a sentence
of imprisonment involved here.

Under such circumstances it

is clear that the federal habeas court did have authority and
that Mr. Hensley was in sufficient custody to be able to
invoke the writ.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Bass.

Mr. Lempert.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DENNIS ALAN LEMPERT, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. LEMPERT:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
The Court in its questions, I think, has struck
upon the sole issue in this case as to whether or not an
individual who for whatever reason is not yet in custody, is
a prisoner and can petition the federal courts for habeas
corpus.

25

The sections that are cited in my brief are very
clear.

The preamble says that a prisoner may petition for

habeas corpus when he is in custody, under the federal
Constitution and then it goes on to set forth the other
areas.
Q

Mr. Lempert, how long does a municipal court

MR. LEMPERT:

Until such time as either the

defendant is acquitted or until such time as the completion of
the sentence, if one is imposed, is completed, including any
period of probation.

Q

Well, I thought you said he could stay

MR. LEMPERT:

Well, at the request of the defendant

he could.
Q

He could?

MR. LEMPERT:

I believe he could.

If the defendant

requests that the court refrain from imposing sentence or
from having that sentence executed at the defendant’s
request, the defendant has suffered no prejudice by the
system but rather hi3 own —
Q

Do you know of any other state that allows

that?
MR. LEMPERT:

No.

But here we have a situation

wnere the defendant was sentenced and the judge in the trial
court granted a stay to permit the defendant the opportunity
to

refrain from going into custody until such time as his

appeals have been terminated.

Mr. Stromer, the counsel who

was representing the defendant at the time the federal habeas
corpus petition was first filed, notified Judge Nelson of
the fact that he was in fact filing a petition with the
federal district court In San Jose with Judge Peckham and that

27
Judge Nelson as a result of the request made by Mr. Stromer
delyaed and stayed temporarily the execution of the sentence,
thereby continuing Mr. Hensley in his own recognizance.

There­

after, the judges of this court and the Ninth Circuit
continued to stay the proceedings.

We are now almost at the

fourth anniversary of the time the alleged offense took place.
Counsel in his statement Indicates that the state
has no legitimate interest whether or not the defendant goes
into custody at this time or at some future time and I would
respectfully differ with that.
substantial interest.

The state has a very, very

As any defendant has a right to a

speedy trial, so, too, does the state have a right to a
prompt and expeditious execution of sentence, otherwise the
purpose of sentence doesn't do anything.
Q

Mr. Lempert, the state could have vindicated

that right here, couldn't it, through its own municipal
court judges' refusal to grant the stay?
MR. LEMPERT:

Only up till 1970.

Thereafter it

was the federal courts and the justices of this court and
other courts in the Ninth Circuit that prevented the municipal
court from acting.
And at this point in time, the defendant has been
out of custody following the imposition of sentence some
three and a half years.

It just does not seem appropriate.

The fact that the petition for writ of habeas corpus

28
initially wa3 devised as a system as a means to have a prompt
and expeditious examination

of a detention by a defendant;,

generally before trials has been expanded by the legislature,
by Congress, to permit a means while after conviction, when
an individual is in

custody, Is a prisoner, to have the

courts examine that detention.
Q

Mr. Lempert, if Judge Nelson had not granted

this stay, Is it fair to suggest that nonetheless before a
determination on the merits of a federal habeas petition
either the district court or the judge of the Ninth Circuit
or a justice of this court would have enlarged the petition?
Q

Well, that could have been done if the

federal courts had wanted to do that.

That is, if the

defendant had gone into custody, there is machinery whereby
when a petitioner files a habeas corpus in federal court he
can be released by the federal courts.

But here, because of

the Judge Nelson wanting to do the defendant a favor, if you
will, and Mr. Stromer, continued temporarily or stayed
temporarily, until such time as there was a consideration of
the habeas petition by the federal district court.
Thereafter, the matter was taken out of Judge
Nelson’s hands by the subsequent stays that

were

issued by

the Ninth Circuit and by this Court and it reverts back to
the question as to whether or not this court or the federal
court can exceed the authority that is granted to it by the

»

29
legislators by the statute authorizing the issuance of habeas
corpus.

The statute is clear.

It relates to a prisoner and

it relates to someone in custody.
Nows the court has regularly defined or expanded on
what is custody,
to be in custody.

what status someone has to be in in order
In Jones it indicated that a parolee is

in custody because he can’t drive a car, he can’t work -without
permission of a parole officer, he can’t go places or do things.
He is in custody, not necessarily with bars around him, but
nonetheless, restricted.

This defendant in this case, whose

whereabouts are totally unknown, at least as far as the
people are concerned.

He can be sitting in this courtroom.

He can be out of the country.

He is operating his business

and there Is no restriction on any of his activities whatso­
ever, except one, that with a lawful order of court, he shall
surrender back to the court and that I don’t feel is the
type of custody, the type of restraint, the type of
interference that is of such magnitude that requires the
Invocation of the habeas corpus.

It doesn’t qualify for

that custody that is required by federal habeas corpus.
One of the questions that was asked is under whose
control Is the defendant presently?

And that, I think,

similarly procedurally presents a very interesting question.
Counsel responded he is under the control of the municipal
court.

The municipal court has no power over the defendant

30
at this time.

It cannot lawfully order anything respecting

the defendant because the court is precluded from that by a
stay granted within the federal system and the sheriff has
no control over the defendant.

He cannot volitionally go

out and seize the defendant or arrest the defendant or do
anything with respect to him.
The petition for habeas corpus is addressed to the
San Jose Municipal court and It is not properly any person
or any entity that has the control over the defendant and
I would submit that ■—
Q

Supposing that at the moments within one

minute, theoretically, at least, after this person entered
the penitentiary, he could bring this same habeas corpus?
MR. LEMPERT:

That is correct.

That is correct.

Once he goes into custody and once he is In custody, then the
right accrues to file the petition for writ of habeas corpus.
Q

And could the district court release him then

MR. LEMPERT:

If the district court at that time

wanted to exercise discretion, yes, it could but that
presents the question -G that may be a more desirable system.
It may well be that it might — the system should have a
procedure whereby someone who is in

immenent danger of

going into custody can have access to federal habeas corpus
and If the Congress so desires, then they ought to pass legis
lation which would permit that.

But under the present status

31
of the law, Congress has not gone so far and they still
require, in the legislation, that the person be in custody.
Q

What if you are under order to show up at a

time certain?
MR. LEMPERT:

At the time you are — that you

appear, you are responding to a court’s order but I don’t
believe that you are in custody of that court.
Q

What about when the time passes and you don’t

show?
MR. LEMPERT:
you may

If it is a wilful failure to appear,

very well be in contempt of that court.

You may

well be in violation of the order of the court.
Q

But you don’t think you are in custody?

MR. LEMPERT:

Not at that time.

It would be —

the defendant could be anywhere at that time.
Q

You might be guilty, as indicated In the

argument, of a separate offense, also.
MR. LEMPERT:
Q

A different offense.

Under the —

As was suggested yesterday.

MR. LEMPERT:

— under the California recognizance

release a defendant, in order to be released on his own
recognizance, relinquishes certain rights.
Q

When you are released on bail and the only

restriction on you Is you don’t leave the Jurisdiction, don’t
leave the county, is that custody?

32
MR. LEMPERT:

Generally speaking, when someone is

released on bail in California, there is no territorial
restriction.
Q

I know.

I didn't ask you that.

I asked you,

suppose you were under territorial restriction?
MR. LEMPERT:
Q

I don’t believe so.

But if there were such a territorial

jurisdiction, did it disappear when the federal habeas
proceedings were started?

You have 3aid the state courts

have been powerless ever since that ~~
MR. LEMPERT:
Q

That is correct.

So whatever the restrictions were, they

vanished then, did they not?
MR. LEMPERT:

I would think, if the Court at this

time — the Municipal Court — were to issue an order
requiring the defendant to appear tomorrow at its court and
the defendant chose not to appear, that that would violate
no law, that the defendant could not be prosecuted for that
because the court is — has no jurisdiction to issue such an
order.
Q

Because of the federal court stay.

MR. LEMPERT:
Q

Because of the federal court stay.

Or the federal circuit justice stay.

MR. LEMPERT:

Whichever.

Because of the federal

status of that case, the court could not issue a lawful order

33
because it was precluded from —
Q

If there was federal jurisdiction, it was

destroyed by the issuance of a stay by a federal judge.
MR. LEMPERT:
follows.

No, I don’t think that necessarily

There was no federal jurisdiction, I believe,

because the defendant was not in custody.

Notwithstanding

that fact, the fact that the federal courts have stayed the
execution of sentence I don’t think affects one way or the
other the defendant’s custodial status.
If -- I believe

you indicated that if the defendant

were ordered to appear and did not, would he then not be
in custody?

Clearly not.

He would be somewhere — somewhere

other than where he was supposed to be but not in anyone's
custody.

He could not be restrained unless he were found

and placed in custody.
Q

What if we — the Court has held that a

parollee released from physical custody but under certain
restraints is under custody for purposes of federal lav/.

One

of those typical restraints is a territorial jurisdiction,
don't leave the state or don't leave the county or something
like that.

Now, If the only sanction for that is you will

be jumping bail if you — or you will be violating your
parole if you leave the county.

You might be committing a

crime or your parole might be revoked.
Now, If you are under an obligation to show up at a

34
certain time and you don’t show up, you certainly have some
obligation that other people in the community don't have.
MR. LEMPERT:
Q

Yes.

And you were

supposed to be someplace at a

certain time that you weren’t.
MR. LEMPERT:

Correct, but that is not, I feel,

the type of custody that requires the invocation of habeas
corpus.

A parollee is an individual who is not only suffering

from a single requirement or a single restriction on his
daily existence as this Court has pointed out in Jones.

He

is suffering from a whole range of prohibitions with
respect to job, family, his domicile, who he can associate
with, \tfhere hd can go and where he can’t go.
Q

Mr. Lempert, a person is served with a

subpoena in a civil case, an automobile accident case and
he is under an obligation to appear on a day certain as soon
as he receives that subpoena, is he not?
MR. LEMPERT:

If it is properly served upon him,

yes.
Q

Assuming that.

in advance et cetera.

And he has been paid the fees

Would habeas corpus be available to

lift that sub poena?
MR. LEMPERT:

Under counsel's argument, I think it

would be, because if any individual is subjected to an order
of court, the violation for which would result in the possible

35
incarceration of the person which, if an individual 'wilfully
violates a proper sub poena or summons served upon him,
could be subjected to a body attachment and be incarcerated
and under counsel's argument, yes, that person would spon­
taneously get the right to file a petition for habeas corpus.
Q

Which would you rather have to face, a habeas

corpus petition or a 1983 complaint?
MR. LEMPERT:
Q

I don't.

I beg your pardon.

MR. LEMPERT:
Q

I don't know.

I don't know.

Mr. Lempert, if you'll back up a minute,

Judge Nelson gave his stay when they first went into federal
court, right?
MR. LEMPERT:
Q

That is correct, your Honor.

For that stage, wouldn't we have been saved

all of this if he said no, wait a minute, before I give you
this stay, let me push him in.
MR. LEMPERT:

That is correct.

Had that occurred,

then had Judge Nelson —Q

This whole point would have been gone.

MR. LEMPERT:

That is correct.

Had there been

a remitter from the Supreme Court of the State of California,
reconferring jurisdiction on the municipal court and if at
that time Judge Nelson had declined to grant the stay of
execution of the snetence, the defendant would have then at

36
that time been taken into custody and thereafter would have
been eligible to file a petition for federal habeas corpus
and his request for release.
Q

He just revoked the one he had given.

MR. LEMPERT:
had to terminate.

That would have terminated.

It

The stay had terminated because of the

decision —
Q

If Judge Nelson had done nothing, this would

have been a very good writ.
MR. LEMPERT:
Q

That is correct.

Well, then, doesn't it get very circular?

Or am I confused?

In other words, if we should affirm the

court of appeals for the Ninth Circuit In this case, as you
are asking us to do, then no judge in the future will ever
issue a stay because he will say I have no habeas corpus
jurisdiction until or unless you are incarcerated.
that right?

Isn’t

So this case would never arise again..

MR. LEMPERT:

Well, It depends which judge we say

would not have the jurisdiction.
Q

What?

MR. LEMPERT:

It would depend which judge.

A

federal judge —
Q

I’m talking about a federal judge.

In this

case, as I understand it, the man was convicted in a
municipal court.

37
MR. LEMPERT:
Q

Correct.

The municipal court judge released him on his

own recognizance pending an appeal and —

Q

Q

the state system.
That is correct.

And by its own terms, that municipal judge’s

stay would have terminated after the affirmance of the
conviction in the state system.
MR. LEMPERT:

Correct.

Is that correct?
Well, procedurally no,

because there is an automatic stay with the filing of a
petition with the district court of appeals.

The stay

that was granted by Judge Welson was a stay up till the time
that the appellate division of the superior court either
affirmed or denied the case.
Q

Okay, then, after affirmance, the stay would

have terminated.
MR. LEMPERT:
Q

That is correct.

Had it not been for the intervention of the

federal district judge.

federal district judge in the custodial status of the

MR. LEMPERT:

And Mr. Stromer.,

and saidj we are filing now a petition for writ
corpus before the federal court.

Please, can we keep

Mr. Hensley out until such time as the federal court decides
the case and Judge Nelson, being a magnanimous individual,
agreed to do that.
Q

And maybe also unaware of the Ninth Circuit

fule.
MR. LEMPERT:

Unaware of the Ninth Circuit rule?

It

was never even brought up whether or not there was jurisdiction
in the federal court to hear the case.

The impression at

that time was that the Ninth Circuit — rather, the federal
district court, Judge Peckham, would consider the petition
and would be dispositive of the case.

At the time for the

return of the order to show cause why the petition should
not be granted, I brought up the question that the court

40

aid not have the jurisdiction to hear the case.

At that

time, the federal courts then, by granting stays, continued
the defendant on his own recognizance.

Had the federal courts

not at that time, either the Ninth Circuit or justices of
this court, interfered

at that time, the defendant would

similarly have gone into custody and at that time would have
been eligible for federal habeas corpus.
It may be a circuitous r*oute and it may be that
regardless of the verdict of this court in this case, the
matter is going to go back to Judge Peclcham.

Either the

defendant will be in custody when that happens, or he will
be out of custody.
Q

But whether or not —

And in the absence, I guess really what it

boils down to is, however this case is decided, in the
absence of a stay order by a federal judge, the person is
going to be in prison, isn't he?

That's correct, in jail,

MR. LEMPERT:

And collateral rights, yes.

And the

whole question goes back again to whether or not this court
or the federal court system has been given the right by the
Congress to hear a case such as this.
Q

I’m sorry, Mr. Lempert, I am confused.

If

Judge Peckham had not Issued a stay order —*
MR. LEMPERT:

Judge Peckham did not issue a stay

order.
Q

Well, who was the first federal judge to

issue a stay order?
MR. LEMPERT:
Q

I believe It was Justice Black.

Well, now, are you suggesting that had that

not issued —
MR. LEMPERT:

The defendant wotuld have been

incarcerated.
Q

Mow, how would he have been incarcerated

in the light of Judge Nelson’3 admitting him on his own
recognisance pending decision of the habeas corpus?
MR. LEMPERT:

Because the habeas corpus was

determined by Judge Peckham when he dismissed the petition
for Ttfant of jurisdiction and at that time a petition was
filed with Justice Black to continue the defendant on his
own recognizance pending a filing in the Ninth Circuit and,
thereafter, Mr. Justice —
Q

I see.

Well, Judge Nelson’s stay expired

with Judge Peckham's decision?
MR. LEMPERT:

The terms of the stay were conditioned

upon the determination of the case by the district court
in San Jose, yes.
Q

By Judge Peckham.

MR. LEMPERT:
Q

That is correct.

So — but in another case, this case could

arise again, then, in the sense that a 3tate judge might
enlodge a man on his own recognizance pending the filing of
decision on a petition of habeas corpus.
MR. LEMPERT:

I don't think so because I don't

think a state court or a judge of the state court can confer
jurisdiction on the federal courts.
Q
it, though?

I didn't —* but wouldn't the state judge do

MR. LEMPERT:
Q

— if you were told that the federal lav/

will entertain it.
MR. LEMPERT:

That is correct.

The law would be

clear at that time, because this court has not addressed itsel
to that question.

It has considered what certain

circumstances are custody and what are not but it hasn’t
said that an individual on ball or an individual released on
his own recognizance, whether that person is or is not
deemed to be in custody.

The California courts recognize

the doctrine of constructive custody.

Q

But Jail can

A parolee — and as the court has

pointed out, other types of people, although maybe not

not their own.
Q

Well, the question here is whether one, on

his own recognizance, is in custody in the same way.
MR. LEMPERT:
Q

Yes, absolutely.

If he surrendered to the state now, voluntarily,

to begin his sentence, within 30 minutes or even three
minutes thereafter the federal district Judge could let him
out again pending determination, could he not?
MR. LEMPERT:
Q

Yes, sir.

And you wouldn’t question that the federal

court had jurisdiction then.

Thank you, sir.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Do you have anything

further?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STANLEY A. BASS., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BASS:

Just this, Mr. Chief Justice, that for

the record, after the federal habeas was denied, the state
trial judge then granted another stay of about 12 days and
that was the stay that kept him out until Mr. Justice Black
acted on August the 12th.

The habeas petition was denied on

July 31st so that there was a dovetailing throughout of
stay orders that were granted by the state trial judge
before the federal judge took over.
Q

Did I get the impression that you thought —

that you said before, going in in this process of surrendering
himself to custody of the state, then immediately filing a

47
petition for habeas corpus in the federal court and asking
for a stay was just a meaningless ritual.
MR. BASS:

Is that —?

I thought it was a meaningless ritual

for the petition to have to go through.

I also mentioned in

the brief that I thought it would be an extremely inadequate
remedy to suggest that all he has to do is surrender either
into the ante room or to the institution of confinement and
then he could probably be bailed by a federal judge.
Two circuits3 the Fifth and the Eighth Circuit that
decided the issue the other way contrary to the Ninth Circuit
both Involved Civil»Rights cases coming out of the south
and it was no accident that in those cases it was extremely
important that the person who was still out on some sort of
form of release be allowed to seek vindication in federal
courts in a timely fashion and we submit that there really
is no reason other than just a definitional one which is
outmoded and we think has been superceded by Strait versus
Laird and all of the previous cases9 that this person can be
considered in custody for purposes of 22*»1 C-3»
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Lempert, thank you.
The case is submitted.
