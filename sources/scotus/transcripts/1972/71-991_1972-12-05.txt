PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No. 71-991, Otter Tail Power Company against the
United States.
Mr. Handler, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MILTON HANDLER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. HANDLER:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
The key issues in this case are whether Otter Tail
violated section 2 of the Sherman Act by refusing to sell
power at wholesale or to wheel governmental power to two small
towns in its area v/hich had

decided to terminate Otter Tail's

franchise and to take over themselves the retail distribution
of electricity to their inhabitants.
One of the towns, Elbow Lake, Wisconsin

— Elbow

La,e, Minnesota applied to the Federal Power Commission and
obtained from that body two orders requiring Otter Tail to
provide it with wholesale power.

The other, Hankinson, North

Dakota abandoned a similar FTC proceedings following the
defeat of the public power faction In a municipal election.
Finding that Otter Tail's refusal to wholesale or
wheel power constituted unlawful monopolization, the district
court issued a voiding junction which I should like to invite
your Honors to examine with me.

it appears at 208 of the

Appendix.
You will note, your Honors, that it imposes an
unqualified and

absolute ob3.±gation on Otter Tail to whole­

sale power to any municipality in its service area.

The

judgment likewise requires Otter Tail, again without qualifi­
cation, to wheel power generated by others to any municipality
that requests such service.
The district court also found that Otter Tail had
monopolized in two additional towns, Colman and Aurora,
South Dakota by bringing or aiding the pliantiffs in certain
law suits.

On this basis, paragraph (C) of the judgment at

page 208 restrains Otter Tail from exercising its constitu­
tional right to appeal to the courts in the protection of its
own interest

if, by so doing, it will delay, prevent or

interfere with the establishment of a municipal power system.
Finally, the judgment in paragraphs (D) and (E)
abrogates willing arrangements between Otter Tall and other
electric power suppliers limiting the use of Otter Tail's
facilities for transmission of their own power to their own
customers.
I propose, with the court's permission, to
discuss each of these erroneous decreeal provisions separately
and in the order indicated, starting with wholesaling.
Contrary to the impression created by the plethora
of briefs filed in this matter, we have not raised — and this

5
court need not consider, the abstract question as to whether
the anti-trust laws can ever be applied to any of the acts
and practices of electric utilities.

The

narrow question

presented for decision is whether there is plain repugnance
between section 202(B) of the Federal Power Act, which is
set forth at page 3 of our brief, and section 2 of the
Sherman Act as applied to the present facts.
There is no disagreement among the parties that
where such repugnancy exists, the regulating agency has
explicit jurisdiction.

I address myself therefore not to the

questions of law which are in agreement, but to the question
of whether in fact the pertinent provisions of the two
enactments are mutually Inconsistent.
I start with Justice Brennan’s summary of section
202(B) in the Gainesville case, which your Honors will find
at page 26 of our brief.

You might well recall that

Justice Brennan there pointed out that section 202(B) — that
under section 202(B) any municipality wanting to be served
at wholesale may apply to the Federal Power Commission for an
appropriate order which may be granted if the Commission
finds that it would be in the public interest, would not
impose an undue burden, would not require the enlargement of
generating facility or impair service to the utility’s
existing customers.
The judgment below is repugnant to each and every

6
aspect of regulatory scheme.

Firsta mandatory interconnection

has been granted here on a blanket basis by a district court
which has thereby usurped the authority of the agency to maice
such decisions as Congress contemplated on a case by case
basis

in light of the facts of each application.
Second^ neither the court’s decision nor the

prospective operation of its decree is based upon a finding
that such mandatory interconnections are in the public
interest within the meaning of the Federal Power Act.
Finally, the decree requires Otter Tail to
wholesale regardless of whether such action would impose an
undue burden, require the enlargement of generating facility
or impair Otter Tail’s ability to render adequate service to
its customers.

Indeed, the district court states In its

opinion that the erosion of Otter Tail’s business and its
very survival are irrelevant.
Any municipality that henceforth wishes to compel
Otter Tail to wholesale will simply apply to the court under
the injunction rather than to the Federal Power Commission.
If it is an anti-trust violation to refuse whole­
saling in advance of a Federal Power Commission determination,
and this is precisely what happened here, we refused, Elbow
Lake went to the Federal Power Commission which issued two
orders compelling wholesaling and yet we are held now to have
violated the anti-trust laws.

7
It is perfectly apparent that anytime you refuse
in putting a municipality or any applicant to the task of
appealing to the agency, you open up a panoply of anti-trust
sanctions against yourself.
Q

In essence —

Mr. Handler, if Otter Tail had wanted to

voluntarily sell to Elbow Lake, would it have had to go to
the Federal Power Commission to get permission?
MR. HANDLER:

This is — the statute contemplates

voluntary interconnection and Commission in 202(A) as
contrasted with 202(B) is charged with the responsibility
of encouraging such voluntary interconnections under 202(B)
it has the power which I have enumerated and described to
order the compulsory interconnections.
I have to check with those that are more versed in
the intricacies of the Federal Power Commission law as to
whether the voluntary arrangements are subject to approval.
I am told that they are not, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
Despite the fact that the government persuaded the
trial court to hold that the erosion of Otter Tail’s
business was without legal significance, now in this appeal
the government seeks to reconcile the conflict between the
two enactments by suggesting that if Otter Tail had refused
wholesaling because it constituted a threat to its ability
to serve other communities, its conduct probably would not
have violated the anti-trust laws.

8
The governments however, nowheres explains how this
contention can possibly be squared with its simultaneous
assertion — and I am quoting, "That the right of a utility
to survive has never justified conduct which otherwise would
violate the Sherman Act."
The government further proposes that the statutes
can be reconciled on an ad hoc basis by having Otter Tail
request a modification of the broad decree that I have
asked you to read when other compliance would violate the
provisos of section 202(B).

Both concessions, it seems to me,

are tantamount to a confession of error since the judgment
by its terms imposes an unqualified duty to wholesale without
any conditions whatsoever.
It is small comfort to Otter Tail to be told on
this appeal that the effect of the judgment on its ability to
render adequate service to its customers can be taken into
account on a motion to modify

judgment when the court has

already held that Otter Tail's very survival, much less its
ability to serve, is legally Immaterial.
Furthermore, under the proposed regime, the Com­
mission’s function of applying the criteria in section 202(B)
would be transferred to a court having none of the specialized
expertise necessary for such a task, thus devitalizing the
regulatory scheme established by the Congress.
Now, If your Honors will turn to paragraph (B) of

9
the Judgment on page 208, you will find that it requires
Otter Tail to wheel subsidized government power to any town
which wishes to take over its retail business.
In our main brief, we discussed at some length the
legislative history of part two of the Federal Power Act.
That history shows, and it is not contradicted by the
government, that Congress specifically rejected the imposition
of any such duty to “Wheel in order to protect utilities from
the very kind of competition that the government now seeks to
promote.

The bill's draftsmen repeatedly sought to reassure

Congress that under no circumstances would a utility have to
wheel power to its existing retail customers.
Far from recognizing that such competition might
be a possible benefit, Solicitor and later

Judge De Vane of

the FPC, the draftsman, underscored, and I quote, "There is
nothing in this bill that permits one utility to enter
another utility's field and in so doing to require the other
utility to transport its power for that purpose."
Again, he says, "The bill is not drawn upon the
theory that competition should be established in this
industry."
When De Vane proposed an amendment to the bill which
would have prevented the FPC from ordering wheeling, his
revision was rejected as inadequate because of the danger
that a court might take such action on it3 own accord.

Thus,

10

in order to eliminate any possible basis for compulsory
wheeling, Congress eliminated entirely all of the wheeling
provisions of the 1935 measure and in so doing, Congress was
assured by the proponents that there was no existing provision
of applicable law

that required utilities to wheel.

The government’s present contention that a duty
to wheel is implicit in the Sherman Act of 1390 would make
Congresses solemn and explicit assurance, in Justice Douglases
words, "a hollow promise.”
Since 1935, the proponents of compulsory ruling,
including the

Justice Department and some amici in this

appeal, have repeatedly sought to persuade Congress to
reverse its earlier determination.

Indeed, in the 1966

hearings, the American Public Power Association, an

amicus

herein, argued the need for legislation by reviewing the
same events in the town of Kankinson upon which the govern­
ment now predicates this anti-trust suit and your Honors will
bear in mind that this whole suit originates out of a
refusal in respect to two towns and two towns only.
Having failed to convince Congress of the merits of
their position, the government and its amici now seek
Judicial legislation in the guise of an anti-trust suit.
The most elementary regard for. the separation of powers, it

v

seems to us, dictates that these arguments and the entire
public versus private power controversy be aired in the halls

n
of Congress and not here.
I now turn, your Honors, to paragraph (C), the
injunction against instituting or supporting litigation
against towns which have voted to establish municipal power
systems was decreed before this court’s decision in
California Motor Transport and is based upon the erroneous
ruling of the Ninth Circuit in that case that the Noerr
principle does not apply to litigation.

The court relied on

the Ninth Circuit decision.
While conceding that there is no evidence that
Otter Tail ever denied any competitor access to the courts,
the government nonetheless construes California Motor
the
Transport as vitiating / Noerr doctrine where litigation is
Intended to delay, prevent or interfere with the establishment
of a municipal power system.
In other words, litigation having an anti­
competitive purpose would fall within the sham exception.
So construed, we respectfully submit, the sham exception is
co-extensive with the effective operation of the Noerr prin­
ciple itself and saps that doctrine of all vitality.

If

this had been the court's Intention in California Motor
Transport, instead of holding, as it did, that Noerr

and

Pennington apply to litigation, It would have upheld the
Ninth Circuit in confining these oases to appeals to the
Executive and Legislative branches of the government.

12
On the contrary, this court held that Noerr and
Pennington apply to litigation and the government's
contention and the judgment below, in our opinion, flies in
the face of this court’s decision.
Now, let me point out, your Honors, that there was
no evidence and no finding that Otter Tail’s litigation
efforts were baseless or without reasonable foundation.
Otter Tail’s good faith was never question.

It is inevitable

that any lawsuit challenging the legality of municipal
action in establishing an electric system will to some
extent delay or interfere with the town’s plans.
Let us suppose that a town elects to take over
Otter Tail’s retail business without first holding the
necessary referendum and that it proceeds to market a bond
issue in plain contravention of the requirements of state lav/.
Is it not clear that the commencement of an action to subject
a municipality to the restraints of applicable state
will

law

inexorably delay, interfere and, indeed, if successful,

prevent the establishment of the municipality — by the
municipality of a power system.
Is it also not clear that the judgment below
denies Otter Tail of all practical access to the court which
is precisely the reverse situation with which this court was
confronted in Motor Transport, where the conspiracy had the
purpose and effect of depriving the defendant’s competitors

13
of free access to public tribunals.
Here, we bring suit at our peril, the peril of
contempt.

This court has held that the

First Amendment

applies to injunctions as well as to statutes and the
teaching of the controlling First Amendment cases is that the
injunction appealed from here is unconstitutional on its
face since it is a naked prior constraint on the right to
petition.

I have compared the wording of this injunction

with the wording of statutes which this court has stricken
and I say that under these cases, the restraint here is much
broader than those which have been held unconstitutional by
the court.
I don't think that the invalidity of this restraint
is an even arguable proposition in light of California
Transport and the only explanation for it is that the judge
followed a decision of the Ninth Circuit which this court
overruled.
both
Now,/this court and prior Justice Department
officials such as Professor Turner have expressly recognized
the folly of any mechanical application of anti-trust to
regulated Industries.

The artificiality of the government’s

anti-trust contentions confirms the wisdom of these earlier
caveats.

The government fails to come to grips with the

plain fact that Otter Tail.can neither fix prices nor
exclude competition.

Its rates are regulated by federal,

state and municipal agencies and Its inability to exclude
competition is demonstrated by the fact that every
municipality wishing to defect from the Otter Tail system
has succeeded In doing so.

In lieu of any functional

analysis, the government argues that every municipality —
and the two that are involved here Hankinson and Elbow Lake,
one has a population of 1,125 and the other has a population
of 1,550 inhabitants and many of the towns have much smaller
numbers of inhabitants.

The government argues that every

municipality, no matter how tiny, constitutes a separate
relevant market which means that every seller who has a
customer who patronizes him exclusively is a monopolist under
the anti-trust laws.
Alternatively,

the government would make Otter

Tall a monopolist in its area by computing its market share
on the basis of the respective number of towns served by

it

or by independent municipalities and comparing that with the
number of towns in the entire region.
In addition to arbitrarily excluding Otter Tail’s
most significant competitors, this analysis by head count
ignores the plain economic fact that a city of 20,000 is
simply not equivalent to a town of 20 inhabitants.
The government’s claim as to Otter Tail’s purported
dominance over transmission and without the dominance over
transmission there would be nothing to the claim of anti-trust

15
violation separate and apart from my other arguments — the
claim of dominance ignores the fact that in wholesaling
situations the Federal Power Commission has the statutory
right and the duty to order interconnections under the
circumstances outlined by section 202(B).
Furthermore, and this is very important, there is a
complete absence of evidence in this record that Otter Tail
in fact enjoys any such dominance with respect to any of the
towns in its service area except possibly Hackinson and Elbow
Lake and even these towns actually, according to the record,
had other feasible sources of pother available to them but on
a less favorable economic basis.
The government’s own expert at Appendix 606 and 608
admitted that he had not studied the availability of alterna­
tive means of transmitting power to any of the other 463 —
of the 465 towns serviced by Otter Tail.

This is the basis

of the repeated statement in the government’s brief that
Otter Tail had dominance over transmission.
And finally, the government attacks the legality of
Otter Tail's contract with the Bureau of Reclamation whereby
Otter Tail agreed to wheel Bureau power to municipalities
which Otter Tail was then not servicing at retail.
According to this view, a utility may agree to
wheel only if its contractual duty is absolute and includes
its own customers.

In view of the fact that the industry

16
fought tooth and nail to avoid any such duty in 1935, is there
any question that no electric company would ever enter into a
coordination agreement with a government agency if it had to
do 30 on such a suicidal basis?

Apart from the incontestable,

I underscore the word Incontestable validity of such agreements
under settled anti-trust and the common law of restraint, the
result belovr nullifies the policy stated by Congress and
Section 202(A) that voluntary interconnections were to be
encouraged.

I say this is a fine way of encouraging when you

invalidate this type of restriction.
For all of the reasons, your Honors, outlined in
this argument and more

fully developed in our briefs, this

is a very important case and I could only touch the highlights,
but we rely upon our briefs for our other contentions and we
respectfully submit that the judgment belov/ be reversed and
the complaint dismissed.
Mr. Chief Justice, I believe I have about three
minutes that I would like to reserve for rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Handler.

Mr. Wallace.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. WALLACE:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
The Appellent has used as its starting point in

17
this case the terms of the anti-trust decree and as is often
tx-ue in devising a decree to afford effective relief in an
anti-trust case, the decree here imposes some restrictions
that go beyond the constraints imposed by the anti-trust
laws themselves in the absence of a violation and as in most
anti-trust cases, I think the best way to look at the case is
to begin with the question of whether there was a violation
of the Sherman Act before turning to the question of how can
effective relief be afforded and whether the district judge
properly afforded effective relief.
The evidence in this case focused principally on
events in four small towns, Elbow Lake, Minnesota, which had
a population in the 1970 census of 1,484, Hankinson, North
Dakota, with a population of 1,125, Colman, South Dakota,
456 persons and Aurora, South Dakota, 237 persons.
The basic issue in this case as we see it is
whether the normal constraints of section 2 of the Sherman
Act on the use of monopoly power to suppress competition
can be enforced in the courts to protect the consumers of
electricity in towns such as these from being foreclosed
from any viable competitive alternative to renewal of the
Appellants franchises, the Appellant's retail franchises
when they expire.
Q

Technically, at least, I understood the

Appellant’s argument to go to the validity of the remedy, the

18
three aspects of the remedy, i.e., the compulsory Interconnec­
tion for wholesale electricity, the compulsory wheeling and
the injunction against litigation.

All those go to the

remedy, not to the substantive violation.

I suppose your

argument will be that if you take away those three things
from the remedy you won't have anything left in order to
enforce the correction of the antitrust violation.
MR. WALLACE:

It seems to me that in approaching the

question of the propriety

of the remedy, the starting point

is what is It that you are trying to remedy.

Was there a

violation of the antitrust laws here and, if so, how should
It be remedied?

I don't see how we can start with the

remedy in answering the questions in this case.
Q

Well, then, what this case is about, then, is

the remedy, exclusively the remedy, those three aspects of
the remedy

the Appellant says are invalid, even assuming

a violation.

Isn't that right?

MR. WALLACE:

Well, Appellant, in its written

briefs, is contesting whether there was a violation

of the

anti-trust laws.
Q

Yes, but even assuming a violation it says

that the district court, because of the Federal Power Act in
the case of two aspects of the remedy and because of the
Noerr Doctrine with respect to the third aspect of the
remedy, says that those aspects of the remedy are what are

19
Invalid, assuming a violation.
MR. WALLACE:
Q

Well —

Isn’t that right?

Or have I misunderstood

this?
MR. WALLACE:

That is part of Appellants contention

but in responding to that question, Mr. Justice, I would have
to start by pointing out that even If I assumed that there was
some validity in Appellant’s contention, then the court
would be faced with the question of whether the remedy should
be modified or whether it was improper to impose the remedy,
and I believe that the remedy was proper — that is our
contention but It seems to me that before we can answer that
question, we have to at least give some attention to what It
is that was being remedied and what the court — what task
the court was faced v/ith.
And in that connection I would like to point out
that in our brief on pages 55 to 6^ v/e explain that
competition palys Important roles in the electrical power
Industry and many of these roles are summarized In a footnote
on page 58 of our brief but the one of particular concern to
us in this case Is the role of competition in the retail
market in small towns.
Mow, although that role is limited to periodic
competition for the retail franchises when they expire, it Is
of great public importance and, indeed, all three of the

20

states involved here have sought to safeguard this periodic
competition by limiting the maximum length of retail
franchises to either ten or twenty years and Otter Tail itself
has competed vigorously in this periodic competition for
franchises.

Its policy has been to acquire existing municipal

systems and franchises whenever it is economically feasible
for it to do so and since 19^7 this record shows Otter Tail
has acquired franchises in six towns previously served by
municipal systems.
Between 19^5 and 1970, there have also been
contests in twelve towns served by Otter Tail over proposals
to replace Otter Tail with municipal systems.
Q

fir. Wallace, to go back to this acquisition

of some of the municipal operations, I am not sure just
what point you were making there, that Otter Tail is
engaged in competition?
MR. WALLACE:

Well, I am trying to point out the

importance of the periodic competition for the franchises
that Otter Tail does engage in, even though —
Q

Well, presumably the municipalities consented

or there would have been no takeover.
MR. WALLACE:
Q

Isn’t that correct?

0 course.

You are speaking of towns that had had a

municipal plant and decided, for various reasons, they didn’t
want to operate on their own and so they sold out to Otter

21
Tail, is that it?
MR. WALLACE:

Well* this is the way that improve­

ments occur in these towns in the quality of service or in
the level of rates.

It is through this periodic competition.

I am pointing out that this competition exists whether the
town is presently served by a municipal system or we believe
under the antitrust laws it also should exist where the town
is presently served by

Otter Tail and the importance of this

competition to consumers is shown by the contests in the
twelve towns served by Otter Tail because on this record
it is a direct result of the threatened loss of its franchise
in these towns.

Otter Tail responded by making such offers

as improved street lighting for the town, a more favorable
municipal pumping rate, improved local maintenance services,
a modernized power distribution system.
In some of these instances, these legitimate
competitive responses persuaded the tovm to stay with Otter
Tail rather than to convert to a municipal system.
In other instances, these responses were not
enough to persuade the town

but the fact is that this is

an important source of the benefits of competition
traditionally protected by the antitrust laws, this periodic
competition which the states sought to assume by limiting
the length of these retail franchises are the way Improvements
In service can be obtained by the inhabitants in these towns.

22
The reason the government brought the present suit
is because, in our view, Otter

Tail went beyond these

legitimate competitive responses and beyond legitimate
competition also in the political arena.
participated

very vigorously

Otter Tail

in the election campaigns

in

these towns on a decision whether to convert to a municipal
system and we don’t challenge that conduct.

We believe that

was also legitimate conduct.
But we believe that —• and the reason we brought
this suit — was our contention that Otter Tail went beyond
these legitimate responses and used what we contend and the
district court found were illicit methods to foreclose
competition when its franchises were at stake.
Now, in order to understand the district court’s
finding in this respect, I want to remind the court first
that the district court found specifically that considerations
of reliability and of economy of scale make it economically
impractical to establish isolated electric generation and
transmission systems in small towns like those in Otter Tail's
service area but there are no such inherent disadvantages to
the establishment of small retail distribution systems and
they are generally among the 70 percent of the electric
utility systems in this country that are engaged solely in
distribution and thus are dependent upon larger firms for
access to wholesale power, whether through purchase from the

24
Q

Mr. ¥allaces this may very well be a naive

question, but supposing we have got a, say9 a Buick dealer
over in Alexandria who is supplied power by the Buick
Company wherever Buick produces it and the City of
Alexandria, being authorized to do so under Virginia law,
decides it wants to go into the Buick dealership business
and tells Buick, in effect, we don't want you to keep
supplying this Buick dealer in Alexandria, we want you to
supply the Alexandria Municipal dealership which we are about
to set up.

Does Buick require

the antitrust laws to

disenfranchise its existing Buick dealer and start selling
the City of Alexandria?
MR, WALLACE:

I don't believe so, Mr. Justice.

Certainly that doesn't seem to be what is at stake In this
case although analogies of that kind are used in some of the
briefs supporting the Appellant and there is a lot of talk
about a per se violation and a per se theory being involved
here.
Q

What is the problem in this case, just in

terms of my hypothetical?
MR. WALLACE:

Well, the basic difference is that

monopolisation is what is charged here and it is predicated
on the existence of monopoly power and refusals to deal that
are designed to preserve that monopoly power and that have
that kind of anti-competitive effect and that are not based

25
on a legitimate business reason other than to preserve that
monoploy power.

Otter Tail didn't come forward with any

legitimate business reason.
In other words, a so-called "per se" violation

of

the anti-trust laws is a violation for engaging in certain
conduct which is so inherently antithetical to competition
that it is unlawful regardless of the circumstances in which
it occurs or the reasons why it is engaged in or the effect.
In this case, the circumstances, the existence of
monopoly power were highly relevant.

The reasons to suppress

competition and to preserve that monopoly power were highly
relevant and the effect was highly relevant and extensive
evidence was heard on the effect.

So many of the hypotheticals

that have been suggested in the brief seem to us quite beside
the point in this case.

I think this is a much narrower

decision than one might assume from reading some of the briefs.
Indeed, it seems to us that these refusals to deal
come squarely within the terms of this court's previous
decisions interpreting section 2 of the Sherman Act.
Assuming that the monopoly power did exist here,
the principles violated are, for one, the general principle
perhaps best expressed in United Statos against Griffith
where the court first noted that the antitrust laws are as
much violated by the prevention of competition as by its
destruction and then said that the use of monopoly power —

26
Q

What kind of a case was that? Public utility?

MR. WALLACE:

That was a case involving motion

picture distribution and exhibition.
Q

Not a public utility case?

MR. WALLACE:

It is not a public utility case.

But the use of monopoly power to foreclose
competition was held there to be unlawful and there are many
cases that Indicate that refusals to deal in one market

—

here wholesaling or wheeling of power — for the purpose of
maintaining a monopoly in another — here the retail
distribution of power — are violations of section two
and we think there is little question but what these
principles are applicable if, In fact, a monopoly power
existed here so that there was monopolization.
There is, as we have pointed out in our brief,
even though public utilities are involved here, there is no
exemption in the applicable laws from the antitrust laws, no
express exemption and — from principles that have been
established in many of this court’s opinions

— inadequate

basis to find an implied exemption because the regulatory
powers conferred on the Federal Power Commission in this
field are not sufficiently comprehensive to indicate that
the normal rule of competition Is the regulator of the
market where it plays its proper role in this industry Is to
be displaced

26

-A

Of course, we are dealing with an Industry where
there are natural monopolies existing except for the periodic
competition at the time of initiating or renewing franchises
but that competition has been emphatically recognized by this
court in another area that is also regulated by the same
federal regulatory agency in the transmission of natural
gas and in this court’s opinions dealing with that subject
such as the El Paso case.
Q
had treated as

Mr. Handler suggested that the district judge
Irrelevant the possibility that Otter Tail

would not be able to carry out its mission to other
communities.

VJhat is your view of the district judge’s

position on that?
MR. WALLACE:

The district judge made extensive

findings that there was no basis to believe that.
Certainly, with respect to the existence of the
violation here, there was no basis for that contention
because all that Otter Tail refused to do that it should
have done under the district judge’s holding was to continue
to supply power to the same towns but at wholesale rather
than at retail or through wheeling agreements rather than at
retail so it is very difficult to see how that would be any
drain on Ottetf Tail’s system and, obviously, Otter Tail
would not.be expected to be wholesaling power at a loss.
The only possible basis for this contention would

27

be that Otter Tail's retail rate to the consumers in these
towns were such that these consumers were subsidizing other
parts of this operations which Otter Tail did not intend.
Q

But, Mr. Wallace, if Otter Tail loses

Hankinson and Elbow Lake, doesn’t it have to look around for
some other potential customers?

It may have to supply them

at wholesale, but in order to keep the same number of
customers, doesn't it have to look around for some others to
supplement Elbow Lake and Hankinson?
MR. WALLACE:
number of customers.

Well, if it wants to keep the same
Otter Tail has been, as a matter of

fact, growing in recent years, but there is no principle
that says the antitrust laws must be put aside so that one
competitor
reduced.

will never have his total number of customers

That kind of economic self-interest is not an

offense to a violation of the antitrust laws.
Q

I thought you suggested in response to the

Chief Justice's question that since all Otter Tall was being
asked to do was to continue to serve the same communities that
it already served, It couldn’t possibly claim a business
justification and my point was that although it continues to
serve them, It does not serve them in the same capacity and
very likely it may have to look elsewhere.
MR. WALLACE:

Not in the same capacity.

Well, if

it wanted to maintain the same gross income, that kind of

28
thing, but it is difficult to see that we are talking about
any serious impairment in the particular conduct that was
held to be a violation here.
What this contention really

goes to is the problem

of what the decree requires of Otter Tail and I believe
I will have to turn to the decree in this respect and perhaps
in a couple of others, because the decree does say that
Otter Tail should wholesale and wheel power to other
municipalities that ask for it, should agree to do so.

But

the Appellant did not point out to the court paragraph five
of the decree at page 209 which is a very key provision which
states that — 209 of the Appendix — that the defendant
shall not be compelled by the judgment of this case to furnish
wholesale electric service or wheeling service to a
municipality except at rates which are compensatory and under
terms and conditions which are filed with and subject to
approval by the Federal Power Commission and this provision of
the decree in our

view brings into play here, fully, the

normal functions of the Federal Power Commission in protecting
the furnishing of electric service in this country.
Q

It is no part of the normal functions of the

Federal Power Commission to require wheeling of power, as I
understand it.

I understand that has been a bone of

contention for years and that Congress has repeatedly and
systematically rejected the proposal that the Power Commission

29

be given that authority.
MR. WALLACE:

That is corrects your Honor and this

decree does not authorize the Power Commission to compel the
wheeling of power.

The excerpts from the legislative

history quoted in the Appellant's argument here were all
of the effect that this bill is not intended to authorize
that wheeling be compelled by the Power Commission in the
exercise of its functions in determining what is in the
public interest in this industry.

But nowhere in the

legislative history was there any suggestion that the anti­
trust laws were being repealed.
Q

I was directing myself to this paragraph five

to which you have directed our attention.
MR. WALLACE:

Well, but the Power Commission does

have a function in reviewing wheeling agreements.

When

wheeling agreements are made, they are filed with the
Commission and the Commission has power to impose terms and
conditions on them , just as —
Q

Now, with respect to

the furnishing of

wholesale electric service, is it your submission that under
paragraph five all of the provisions of 202 of the Power
Act become applicable?
MR. WALLACE:

That is what,

in our view, this

paragraph of the decree was designed for.

Most wholesaling,

most interconnections in wholesaling in this country occur

30
by voluntary agreement rather than by order of the Power
Commission and those voluntary agreements are filed with the
Power Commission and are subject to the imposition of terms
and conditions by the Power Commission that are in the
public interest and if, under this decree, a particular
agreement was thought by Otter Tail to impair the possibility
of its furnishing reliable service to its existing customers
when that particular agreement which it was required to
enter into under this decree is submitted to the Poi^er
Commission for its review, Otter Tall could point out these
difficulties to the Power Commission and the Power Commission
would, under the decree, under section 202, be free to
impose whatever terms and conditions the Power Commission
believes are required in the public interest to the point of
virtually nullifying that particular agreement in order to
protect Otter Tail's existing customers.
Q

So that, in your view, under this paragraph

five of the decree, the Power Commission could proceed with
respect to a compulsory interconnection for wholesale
service wholly independently, as though this judicial decree
did not exist?
MR. WALLACE:

The way it normally proceeds with

respect to interconnection agreements, that is correct.

That

is the principle function of the Power Commission with
respect to interconnections.

There is nothing in the Power

31
Act that says that the Power Commission has to authorize
an interconnection, a wholesaling agreement before it can be
entered into.

The voluntary agreements which are what most

of them are, are merely subject to terms and conditions
being imposed in the public interest.
Q

It itfasn’t a matter of voluntary agreements.

The whole point of this case is that they did not volun­
tarily agree.
MR. WALLACE:

Well, that is correct and because

that was a violation of section two of the Sherman Act the
relief is that they should now enter Into

agreements that

presumably they would have entered into voluntarily but for
their policy of seeking to foreclose competition in order to
preserve their own monopoly.
Q

But if they don’t want to, it is your — do

I understand you to say that this will just be a section 202
proceeding as though this judicial decree did not exist?
MR. WALLACE:

Well, It would be — the voluntary

agreement will be entered into because the decree exists.
What Is in contemplation under —
Q

I mean, they are not voluntary.

MR. WALLACE:

But what would be treated by the

Commission as a voluntary agreement will be entered into
under the compulsion of this decree.
this decree

That Is the purpose of

32
Q

That is an odd definition of "voluntary."

MR. WALLACE:

Well, that is correct, but the -- I

think the best way to explain it is that the decree was
designed to see to it that Otter Tail enters into the
agreements that it would have voluntarily entered into if it
were not for its policy of monopolization.
Q

Than what role, if any, does the — do the

provisions of 202 with respect to the power of the Commission
to decline to compel an interconnection for wholesale
serve?

What — to what degree do they continue to play a

part after this judicial decree?
MR. WALLACE:

Well, they don't play a part with

respect to agreements that Otter Tail enters into under the
requirements of this decree.

Those are treated by the

Commission as most wholesaling i3 treated.
That was part of the extortion case we heard

Q
yesterday.

I don't — let’s say that — what happens if

Otter Tall says, well, despite the decree under this
paragraph five,

we are simply not going to do this.

MR. WALLACE:

Q

Not going to do what?

Not enter

Then Otter Tail —

Yes, we are not going to Interconnect and

wholesale power to one of these municipalities.
MR. WALLACE:

I think Otter Tail would be in

contempt under the decree if it refused to enter into an

33
agreement to Interconnect.

It does have recourse under

paragraph five to ask the Commission to impose terms and
conditions on that agreement that will protect the public
interest in the furnishing of service to its existing
customers —
/

Q

Then I misunderstood.

MR. WALLACE:

— and those terms and conditions can

virtually nullify the agreement.
Q

Well, by "virtually nullify," does the

Commission have power under this five —
MR. WALLACE:
Q

—

The agreement would still exist.

to say, no, you don't have to interconnect

at all?
MR. WALLACE:

Uh, no, not to say, no, you don't

have to Interconnect at all but that you don't have to furnish
any wholesale power

through this interconnection that will

impair your ability to serve your existing customers.

It is

only if you have access power, you know, the terms and
conditions can be based on the factual showing that is before
the Commission.
Q

Mr. Wallace, you mean that the decree could

interconnect but they could say we are not going to furnish
any power?
MR. WALLACE:

Well, they have to agree under this

to interconnect for the purpose of furnishing wholesale

34
power.

The terms and conditions on that agreement can be

Imposed by the Commission as it does on any voluntary
agreement to interconnect.
Q

And one term that the

Commission could

impose, according to you, is that you not furnish any power
to the —
MR. WALLACE: (Interposing): If the circumstances
required the Commission to do that.

That is correct.

I

think it is highly unlikely that such an agreement would be
sought by a municipality anticipating that that would be the
end result.

If there were a situation where Otter Tail said,

yes, if you insisted that I enter into this agreement under
the decree I’ll have to, but I’m going to be able to make
such and such a showing to the Federal Power Commission even
though in my view you are not going to be able to get any
power as a result of this agreement.

There is no point in it.

I just — I think we are dealing with unlikely hypothetical.
Q

Well, do you mean to say that that would be

a circumstance where they might respond by saying if we
carry out this interconnection and deliver this power we
won’t be able to have proper reserve power for other towns.
Would that be the kind of a —
MR. WALLACE: (Interposing):

That would be the kind

of a condition the Power Commission could then impose.
Q

Going back to —

35
MR. WALLACE:

All of this is very unlikely because

this record shows ample power over Otter Tail's line.

We are

only dealing with the extreme situation.
Q

Going back to (B), paragraph (B) of the

injunction, the transmission, isn't this in effect an order
by a district judge to do something that Congress has
refused to do for 25 or 30 years?
MR. WALLACE:

Well, Congress has denied the

Power Commission authority to order wheeling, just because
the Power Commission might think it is in the public interest
to have wheeling under section 202(B).

Now, it is not clear

that the Power Commission has no authority to order wheeling.
The Power Commission did order wheeling a3 a condition to the
use of hydroelectric resource in the Idaho Power case and
this court upheld it and it is quite possible that it could
order wheeling in a discrimination case where the utility
was wheeling to one customer and not to another but under
202(B) the Power Commission has no authority to order
wheeling.
Q

Would you say that the district court's

injunction here has gone beyond the powers which Congress
vested in the Power Commission on the wheeling or
transmission?
MR. WALLACE:

I would say It has gone beyond the

power vested In the Power Commission and that it was

36
appropriate for the district court not to be limited by those
powers when a violation of section «two of the Sherman Act
had occurred.
Q

You place this entirely on the remedial

aspect?
MR. WALLACE:
In the

Power Act

That is correct.

There is nothing

that says there the remedies that district

judges can require for redress of violations of the Sherman
Act are to be limited because the Power Commission can’t
order certain things to happen merely because the Power
Commission would believe them to be in the public interest
when there has been monopolization, when these people have
been denied their rights to choose for themselves any viable

to
competitive alternative/being the continued captive customers
of the one supplier, then remedies are required and the law
has always been that effective
Q

remedies should be devised.

Mr. Wallace, I knoiir your time has expired,

but what about paragraph (C), engage in litigation.
MR. WALLACE:

Well, uh, the only way I can answer

that, Mr. Justice, is to point out that abuse of litigation
was, I think, very wisely recognized by this court last term
in the California Transport case to take many forms that come
within what has come to be called the "sham exception to the
Noerr Doctrine" and the form that was particularly involved
here X think was very well described, with, perhaps, some

37
foresight in that opinion in the California Transport case
as a pattern of baseless, repetitive claims that may emerge
which leaves the factfinder to conclude that the adminis­
trative and judicial processes have been abused and of course
the district judge here did not have the benefit of this
opinion when he had to write his opinion but I think his
findings indicate that kind of pattern, not merely because of
the repetitiousness of the issues and the lack of success
involved here but also because of the repeatedoffers by
Otter Tall to reimburse the towns for the expenses
incurred in this litigation if they would only abandon their
plans to set up their own system and stay with Otter Tail.
You had here a spectacle of a public utility using
its funds derived from its customers, not to provide better
service, but to generate litigation expenses which it would
then offer to repay with more of those funds in order to
foreclose competition and, faced with this pattern of the
abuse of the litigation process, I think it was proper for the
district judge to grant relief to this part of the pattern of
the monopolization conduct.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

That makes it quite
We are appealing from

the decree as entered in the trial court and it seems to me
that that is the decree which measures our rights and our

With respect to paragraph five, the proviso,
Mr. Wallace has failed to point out to your Honors that
section 202(B) imposes two functions on the Commission, first
and foremost to determine whether it is in the public
interest to order the Interconnection, the wholesaling.
Secondly, to determine the terms and conditions on which that
interconnection shall be carried out.
The proviso does not cover the first.

It covers the

second and it is just absolutely wrong to suggest that in
passing upon the terms and conditions the court can — the
Commission can also determine whether it Is in the public
interest to have an interconnection In the first place.
Indeed, it seems to me that my good friend and
former student’s concessions today establish beyond

which makes antitrust inapplicable.

case where this court has approved this kind of hybrid
regulation.

Indeed, I have the

hardihood to say that there

is no case in the books where repugnancy is plainer than it
Is here.
Now,

I would like, Justice Stewart, if I may, to

clarify one of the points which you raised.

If you turn to

page 27, the opening sentence, the record 27, the opening
sentence of the court's opinion states, "And this action
brought into section two of the Sherman Act the basic issue
Is whether wholesaling of wheeling constitutes monopolization."
Our position here is that wholesaling does not
constitute monopolization under the doctrine of primary
jurisdiction.

Antitrust is ousted.

Wheeling does not

constitute monopolization because the legislative record,
contrary to what Mr. Wallace says, contains an assurance not

merely

that the agency cannot order wheeling but that the

court cannot order wheeling.

This was fully debated at the

hearings so that we say that there is no basis for that
decreeal provision because it does not constitute a violation
of law.
With respect, Mr. Chief Justice, to the erosion
argument, at the bottom of page 45 of the Appendix, the
opinion, a so-called — I'm reading — "a so-called 'erosion
study' DX4l offered by Defendants sought to foretell Its
financial disaster if It is required to serve its former
customers which convert to municipal operation."
That is the argument.
The court's answer, "Otter Tail cannot violate the
law albeit its avowed purpose is to protect the integrity of
its business."
On page 45, "Isn't it rather odd you have an
injunction here which is available to every one of the 465
towns that can decide to take over the Otter Tail business
and ask Otter TAil either to wheel a

subsidized governmental

power or to wholesale without regard to the effect on its
system, without regard to its financial ability to service
customers, without regard to its very survival." This is
the Injunction and then we are told here solemnly that all
that is Involved is an

injunction sought by one town and that

Otter Tall would have the energy to supply a town of 1,450

but that is not the case before this court.
Justice Rehnquist, a voluntary agreement need not
be submitted in advance but after it is made, it is filed and
the Commission could have the power to review its terms.

Thank you, Mr. Handler.

Thank you, Mr. Wallace.
The case Is submitted.
(Thereupon, at 11:10 O'clock a.m., the case
was submitted.)
