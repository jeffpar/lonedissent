CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments first

in Ho. 71-5685, Daisy Johnson against Mew York State Education
Department.
Mr. Nathanson, you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARL JAY NATHANSON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. NATHANSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Education has long been regarded as perhaps the
most important function of both State and local governments.
It is recognised as fundamental and preservative of the
democratic society.
Education truly prepares the individual for meaningful
participation in society, economically, socially, politically,
intellec tualiy.
New York State, like most States in the United States,
considers education of such fundamental importance to both the
individual and to society that it compels minors to attend
upon compulsory instruction for a period of ten years.
It is against this background that the issue being
presented in this Court must be considered.
New York’s public school system continues to rely
extensively upon textbooks as the basic core for their
curriculum.

4
It remains a fundamental tool in the education of
all youngsters in the public schools.
The question presented in this Court is whether the
Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment forbids
New York State from denying indigent school children textbooks
essential for their required instruction solely because of the
inability of their parents to pay textbook rental fees.
In all but six of New York's 756 school districts,
the statutory scheme for providing textbooks is twofold.
With respect to students in grades 7 to 12s the
Education Law requires that textbooks be provided free of
charge to all students in both the public and the private
schools.
With respect to students in grades 1 to 6 in the
public schools, the legislative scheme provides that the
authorized voters of a school district may vote a tax for the
purchase and loan of textbooks free of charge to all students
in grades 1 to 6.
However, the absence of such budget approval and
such approval of a tax for that purpose, the local school
districts are required to either rent or sell textbooks to
all children in grades 1 to 6.
In June and July of 1970, the voters of the West
Hempstead Public School District defeated a budget and a tax
for the purchase of textbooks and the distribution of textbooks

5
frea to children in grades 1 to 6.
Consequentlya the local school district notified
all parents of children in grades 1 to 6 that they would have
to pay a textbook rental fee as a condition to their children
obtaining textbooks.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

What is the situation

today?
MR. NATHANSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, subsequent to the

granting of certiorari in this case, the school district did,
in fact, approve a school budget and a tax for the purchase of
textbooks.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

So that all of these

students, grades 1 to 6, are now receiving books, are they?
MR. NATHANSON:

All students in the elementary

school are now receiving books.
However, the local school district is under an
obligation under New York State law to hold annual budget
referenda.
The preceding history of the pattern of voting in
this district — where six of

seven school budgets have been

defeated ~~ the fact that there are — these local school
boards admit that absent approval of this tax they are mandated
to rent or sell textbooks to the students in the district,
I think bears upon whether or not this case is moot or presents
a justiciable controversy, and I cover that further subsequently

6

in the argument.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
MR. KATHANSON:

Very well.

The petitioners in this case are

parents of children in the elementary school grades.
They were notified, received letters -- the record
bears it out -- prior to the commencement of the school
term, that no textbooks would be provided to children unless
their parents paid a textbook rental fee.
Petitioners are also recipients of public assistance
in New York State and are unable to pay — were unable to pay
the textbook rental fee.

That factor is uncontroverted by the

record and there is no question of their indigency.
Q

Part of their payments are for educational purposes?
MR. MTHANSON:

Yes, with respect to that portion,

New York State, in 1971, reduced the level of benefits for
public assistance from 100% of need to 90% of need.
At the present time, recipients only receive 90%
of what the State has determined to be the minimum need for
sustenance.
So there is no question that even assuming there was
a minimal allowance in the budget for education, the very fact
that they have reduced the budget by that 10% deprives the
recipient of any opportunity to purchase the textbooks.
Q

Then what you are saying is that the educational

increment is used for general support?

7
MR. NATHANSON:

Yes, sir.

The edueafelon increment

is used for other items aside from textbooks.

It would be

used for purchase of sneakers for gymnasium classes.
be used for purchase of gym suits.

If would

It would cover all items

related to educational needs.
Q

Well, inherent in your argument then is the fact that

this isnft an educational increment at all, despite it’s being
so-called?
MR. NATHANSON:
Q

That’s correct.

Does the record indicate the type of«use you

have just spoken of, Mr. Nathanson?
*

MR. NATHANSON:
used?

No, there isn’t.

With respect to how the funds are
But this question was raised before

the Court in the Rosado case with respect to the adequacy of
the grant.
I have contacted the attorney who argued the case
before the Court, and handled the Rosado case.

I was informed

by that attorney that the allowance is intended to cover all
these other items and not intended to cover textbooks.
Q

But that's not in the record here?
MR. NATHANSON: No, sir.
Prior to the commencement of this action, the

petitioners, through their attorney, contacted the superintendent
of the local school district and inquired as to whether or not

some alternative method could be utilised to obtain textbooks

s
for these indigent children.
The superintendent of the school district, although
«cu^atsioaafce with the plight of the children, indicated that he
was obliged under State law to exact textbook rental fee as
a condition to furnishing textbooks.
The recipients also contacted the State and local
welfare agency and requested an allowance to cover the textbook
rental fees.
They were informed that New York State ,when it went
onto the flat grant system, eliminated all special grants
and'any opportunity to provide for this type of expenditure.
That is borne out in the record in the affidavits of the
petitioners.
Q

Mr. Nafchanson, let me ask you one other question*

What, in fact, happened to the children of your petitioners
for these past years?

Did they ever receive textbooks in some

way?
MR. MTHANSON:

Yes, Justice Blackraun.

Subsequent in the term, five weeks after the commence­
ment of the school term, and after the District Court dismissed
the complaint for legal insufficiency, the named plaintiff*s
children did receive textbooks for the balance of the school
term.

They went through five weeks of the school term without

textbooks.
Q

May I ask the source of their receipt?

9
MR. NATHANSON:

There was an arrangement entered

Into between counsel for the local school board and myself,
whereby the sum of $30 was deposited by me to be held in
escrow pending resolution of the controversy, and the local
school ooard agreed to provide textbooks to only the named
plaintiff's children without prejudice to maintaining .the class
action.
I might point out that the local school board in
the matter, as it appeared in the lower Court, conceded that
there were, in fact, other recipients in the school district
who were similarly affected by this legislative scheme.
I have also attached as an affidavit to the reply
brief an affidavit from another recipient who is a member of
the class,and in the second school terra, again, went without
textbooks for a substantial period of the school year.
Q

Of course, years ago, nobody got free textbooks.
MR. NATHANSON:

That's true.

In Mew York State, textbooks — I come from the
City and Mew York City textbooks have always been provided
free.

They have always been thought of as a fundamentally

basic part of the learning process.
Q

Maybe in your day, but for an old-timer, not in my

Q

How long has the Constitution of Mew York provided

day.

that all children must be given a free education, as a State

3.0
Constitutional thing?
MR. NATHANSON:
Q

X am sorry, Mr. Chief Justice?

How long has the provision for compulsory State

education been in the New York State Constitution?
MR. NATHANSON:

Goes back more than 100 years, sir.

With respect to — this action was started as a class
action in the District Court on September 16, 1970.
The petitioners asserted three basic claims in the
District Court, all alleging a denial of equal protection.
The petitioners only press one claim in this Court
and that is the poverty claim.
The petitioners allege that textbooks are essential
for the education of their children, that the failure to pro»
vide textbooks by the State has denied them equal educational
opportunity, and has further stigmatized them.
With respect to the stigma, the affidavit of one of
the petitioners, Forestine Pressy, bears upon that.
In her affidavit submitted in the District Court,
she said:

"On the first day of school, my daughter asked the

teacher for textbooks and was told that she would have to bring
money from her mother to obtain textbooks.

My daughter asked

me upon her return from school why some children in her class
were given books and X told her that the parents of those
children were able to pay for the books."
Petitioners also allege that children being forced

ii
to attend school under the Compulsory Education Law and then
sit in classrooms alongside other classmates whose parents
were able to afford textbooks were subjected to further
stigmatizing by having a feeling of inferiority and unworthiness
engendered upon them.
What came clear through this whole thing was an
official State view of their worthiness, or, I should say,
unworthiness.

The classification creates two classes of

children in grades 1 to 6, the poor and the non-poor.
The non-poor receive the full benefits of the State's
educational program and the poor are barred from receiving
those benefits.
Q

The statute doesn’t create that classification.

Those classes exist quite apart from the statute, don't they?
ME. NATHANSON:

Yes, but the impact of this textbook

rental fee is, in fact, to deprive those children of equal
educational opportunity.
The statute may be neutral cn its face, but in
operation it is discriminatory.
Q

How do you distinguish your case from the general

doctrina laid down iri Dandridge v. Williams?
MR. NATHAWSOH:

I think that this case satisfies the

traditional test of Dandridge for the following reasons:
Dandridge said that minimally for a classification
to cut mustard,under the I ml Protection Clause, it's got to

12

be rationally based and free

roia invidious d is c r iia ina t ion.

i. think clirs class s .c leatroii rarls to satisfy those
requirements for the following seasons.
first, in considering the rational basis

this

legislation, I think we've got to look at the overall purpose
of education in Hex* York State, which is to provide a system
of common schools where all the children of the State may be
educated.

,
Secondly, I think we have to consider the fact that

children are attending school under compulsion.
When measured against this overriding general purpose
of the State, it can hardly be said to be rational to deny
poor children the very basic tools they need to acquire learning
skills.
Q

You are talking about a classification.

You are not

talking about the distinction between elementary school
children and children further along in school —

m. mTHAWSGti:
Q

No.

So just what is the classification that you are

talking about?

The fact that Mew York doesn*t give anybody

free books from grades 1 to 6?
M&. &4THANS0K:

The fact that Kew York State gives

books to those parents who are
who are able to afford textbooks.
q

Well if sells them.

to children of those parents

13
MR. NATHANSON:
Q

Rents them.

Rents them.

It doesn’t give them, does it?

MR. HATHANSON:

The impact upon those who don’t have

the rental fee is to be denied equal educational opportunity.
Q

Well, the classification, though, really, is almost

non-existent, as I would see it.

Hew York State says to

children in the elementary school grades:
books.”

And that’s that.

”We will rent you

It isn’t a classification in any

orthodox equal protection sense.

MR. NATHANSON:

1 think the classification falls

within those line of cases marked by Griffin.

I think they

are really on all fours with the Griffin case.
Hew York State tells — accords a right of education
to all students of the State.
Griffin accorded the right of appellate review.
There is no Constitutional basis for either right.
Federal Constitution basis, it may be argued.
In Griffin, the statute was neutral on its face.
Those who could afford the transcript fee attained adequate
appellate review.

Those who couldn't, were denied adequate

appellate review.
I think it parallels this case.
Q

Then you say basically that the rationale of Griffin

should be carried over from the field of criminal law into
this situation?

14
MR. NATHAHSON:

Yes.

I don't think the Griffin

rationale has been limited by this Court to only criminal law.
I think the rationale in the Griffin case carried through in
the Harper case.
X think the underlying rationale of that case was
extended further in the Boddie case.
I think it is a continuous application of that
principle.

X don't think this Court has to abandon that
<

rationale to find any other basis of deciding this case.
Q

Mr. Hafchanson, may I ask if this i3 a case in which

a three-judge Court should properly have been convened.

The

Court of Appeals said it was not, but if it was then are the
merits before us at all?
MR. HATHAKSON:

Your Honor, the third cause of

action did seek declaratory relief.

I think it is careful of

resolution in that framework, that the Court can declare the
right of those —
Q

But I thought this case was litigated before

Judge Travia before the Court of Appeals —
MR. HATHAKSOH:
Q

That is correct*

on the issue of whether or not a three-judge

Court should have been convened, was it not?
MS. HATHAHSOM:
Q

Yes, sir.,

And the Judge Travia said there was not a substantial

Federal question and the majority of the Court of Appeals

15
agreed, isn't that so?
MR. NATHANSON:
Q

That Is correct.

Well, if Judge Travia and the majority of the Court

of Appeals are wrong, then shouldn't the disposition here be
that they were wrong and send this back to the convening of
a three-judge Court to determine the merits.
I don't see how the merits are here before us at
all.
MR. NATHANSON:

This Court could properly send the

matter back for three-judge Court —
Q

Don't we have to if it should have been a three-

judge Court case in the first instance?

We have no juris­

diction, do we?
MR. MTHMSOH:

Except that the Court of Appeals,

I think, noted that because of the third cause of action,
which sought declaratory relief, that it wasn’t essential
to convene a three-judge Court*

If this Court should determine
• ■

that jurisdiction lied and that relief was appropriate, that
relief could be granted under the declaratory judgment cause
of action, and that in view of the fact -Q

That would have been for a single judge?
MR, HATHAMSON:

That would have been for a single

judge.
Q

But we only reach the merits if we find that it is

properly decided on the three-judge Court issue, isn't that

16
right?
MR. MTHAKSOW:

That’s correct.

The local school board — the State Department
of Education filed neither records nor affidavit in the
District Court.

The local school board filed answering papers

and affidavits and admitted some very key matters.
First, they admitted that fees were demanded.
Secondly, they admitted that those unable to pay the
textbook rental fees were denied textbooks.
Third, they admitted that the fee policy placed a
burden upon the educational opportunity of those denied text­
books, and that those children were denied equal educational
opportunity.
The board further admitted that textbooks in grades
1 to 6 are essential for the quality education of all children.
The District Court dismissed the case,finding legal
insufficiency, without holding any evidentiary hearing.
There was no opportunity at District Court to either
explore the class further or present any further information.
The Court of Appeals again affirmed the District
Court's dismissal but, nevertheless, conceded that education
was no doubt an area of fundamental importance, that those
children who could afford textbooks no doubt received a better
education than those who could not, but concluded that the
statute was neutral on its face and free from any invidious

17
d .1 sc r imina t Ion.
Q

Do you have a figure for one year’s textbooks, again?

It is somewhere In the record here?
MR. NATHAMSON:
costs.

Actually, there are two parts to the

We are only pressing the textbook fee.
Textbook fees were $7.50 per child.
In addition to the textbook fee, there was a material

fee, a fee for supplies and other related items.
That totalled some $15.

So, all in all, the fee,

with textbooks and that other item, ranged from $15 to $17
per child.
We are pressing only the claim of the textbooks as
being essential to education.
Q

Did I understand you to say that some of the school

districts in the State of New York do provide free textbooks?
MR. NATNANSON:
Q

Yes, Mr. Justice Powell.

Do they do that as a matter of State law or —
MR. NATHANSON:

Yes, the State law distinguishes

between some school districts on the basis of size.
I am from New York City.
had a problem obtaining textbooks.

New York City has neverChildren always get text»

books free in the City.
Some of the other school districts which encompass
cities are required under the State law to provide textbooks,
irrespective of budget considerations.

18
Q

If we reach the merits in this case, do you claim

that that is a classification that violates the Equal Protection
Clause., namely, a classification based on the size of cities
within the State of New York?
MR. NATHAMSON:
thi3 case.

We are not pressing such claim in

This case confines itself to whether or not the

local school district can provide textbooks to those affluent
children — children of affluent parents who can pay and deny
that essential tool of learning to those who are too poor to
pay the required fee.
That's the premise of this case and we confine it
to that issue.
Q
question?

While I have interrupted you, may I ask you this
Assuming you are right with respect to school books,

and I think you can make a very strong argument, as you are, on
that point, how far would you carry the logic of your position?
Would you carry it to free transportation, to free lunches, to
provide adequate clothing?

How far down the road would you

suggest the Equal Protection Doctrine would carry?
MR. MTHMSON:

We are not making that claim here,

but I would say that with respect to transportation, the same
argument can be made.

Getting to school Is essential to any

education, and if some children are passed by at their door
because they don't have the carfare to get on the bus, I would
say that they, too, have an Equal Protection claim.

We pass

19
into Che gray area when we talk, about clothing.

I think that's

where we’ve left the rationale of the Griffin case.
Q

Free lunches?
MR. MTHANSON:

under Federal legislation.

Free lunches are basically handled
X don’t think we can anticipate

that as a problem.
Q

Mr. Hathanson, free glasses for the myopic child

who is nearsighted and can’t see without them?
MR. NATHANSON:

Well, the problems of the handi­

capped child are a real problem.

X would say that if the

glasses are essential for the child to participate in the
educational program, and if glasses are, in effect, provided
to other children by the school district, then the same
rationale would apply.
We are talking, I think, about something that’s
being provided to some children and not being provided to
others.

It is the obligation of the State to treat children

equally.
Q
supplied.

The child of wealthy parents would have glasses
Just as here the child of the more affluent parent

would have his textbook rental paid.
X am asking in your case whether your logic doesn’t
take you to the end result that the district would have to
provide glasses for the indigent child?
MR. MTHANSON: That problem is being addressed to by

20
the Social Services Law.
Q

Suppose It isn’t —
MR. fiiATHAHSON:

I don’t think that that would

necessarily carry forth.
Q

Your argument doesn’t turn, does it, Mr* Nathanson,

on the fact that it's the school board itself which rents the
textbooks ?
Wouldn't your position be the same if the school board
said, "Here’s a list of books you have to have.

Now you

can go down to Joe's Book Store and rent them, if you’ve got
the money.”
MR. MTHANSON:

If the textbooks were required

and

in New York State the textbooks that these children use are
part of a required course of study — if the school requires
these textbooks be used, and children who can pay the rental
fee get them, I think there is an obligation to provide if
for those who can’t pay rental fee.
Q

It doesn’t turn on the fact that the renting agency

here happens to be the State here or the school board?
MR, MIHANSON:

Well, we have State action because

it is the school board involved.
Q

But the State action is the requirement,isn't it,

that books be used for the course?
MR. MTHANSOM:

If the State were to require that

these books be used and the children had no way to obtain these

21
books because they lacked the fee, I think the same rationale
would apply.
Again, in 1971, the school district on three
occasions rejected the school budget.
Before I discuss the legal contention any further,
I.think it is important to consider two aspects of this case.
What’s happened to these poor children has happened
to them in schools they are compelled to attend.
Secondly, the injury they have suffered is due not
to any conduct or demeanor on their part, but solely because
of the fact of their status as members of poor families.
I think the State has -- while we submit that —
and we've argued in our brief that — education could qualify
►V>' •

under the more exacting standard of the Equal Protection
Clause, we submit that for the purposes of determining this
case, the Sandridge basis is sufficient, again that this
classification is neither rationally based nor free from
invidious discrimination,
X discussed the lack of rational basis before.

X

will just deal with lack of invidious discrimination here.
First, the State has stigmatized poor children.
X think it is significant that in the Court of
Appeals the majority, although they affirm the lower Court,
conceded that the plaintiffs had realistically described the
potential plight of these children when they described the

22
psychological and emotional harm being engendered by being
compelled to sit in classes with other students who were
learning from textbooks while they don't have textbooks.
Q

Do I have to get to the psychological thing?

The

child just doesn’t get an equal education, doesn’t he?
Isn't that your point?
MR. MTEAMSON: That’s correct, Justice Marshall.
Q

Why do we have to worry about the psychological.

He doesn't learn that 2 times 2 is 4 because he doesn't have
a book.
MR. NATHANSON:

That’s correct.

He also learns that wealth breeds favored treatment
in the public school, which is a poor lesson for both rich and
poor child in a classroom.
The further invidious discrimination in this case is
the fact that children are being penalised for something over
which they have no control.
Just as the child in the Levy case and in Webber case
was penalised for illegitimacy, a condition over which he had
no control, here too, the impact of this >- and the admitted
impact of this classification — is to deny equal education to
poor children.
I think it is significant that the Brown case, which
said that once the State offers the opportunity for education
it must offer it upon equal terms,

It is a right that must be

23
offered upon equal terms to all.
X don’t think it is being offered upon equal terms
in this case.
I think the Griffin case is parallel to this case,
and again the Griffin case didn't depend upon the Court finding
any Federal Constitutional right for appellate review.

Instead

the case was hinged upon the fact that the State had, in fact,
provided appellate review and the fee prevented those people
who couldn't afford the transcript from receiving an adequate
appellate review.
I think that very same rationale applies to this
case.
I think also the method in which the State has
brought about achieving their purpose is ill-tailored and
poorly tailored for the objective.
I fail to see how they maximize impact of the text­
books by denying textbooks to those who perhaps need them most.
It would seem that a less onerous alternative would
be to deny textbooks to children in grades 1 to 12 who are
able to pay the textbook rental fees.
In that case, all children would be able to obtain
textbooks in the State.
I think this case also parallels the Harper case.
In Harper, too, there was no Federal Constitutional right to
vote in the State election.

Nevertheless, the Court considered

24
the fundamental interest involved, the right to vote being
preservative of all other rights.
X think education also shares that place in American
society.

It is preservative of every other basic civil and

political right.
Q

We've read these opinions of Judge Travla and the

Court of Appeals and X don't find anything in them that suggests,
as you have, that on the declaratory judgment the both Courts
thought that this was proper for a single judge and then on
appeal.
Page 63 of the record that reached the Court of
Appeals approach this:,!At the outset there must be a determin­
ation as to whether Judge Travia properly denied plaintiff’s
motion for the convening of a three-judge Court.

The three-

judge Court is ultimately decided upon the rationality of the
Mew York State Legislature's enactment of 701 and 703.

There

is little to be gained by having this Court of three judges
subject its own rationality to further scrutiny ...”
And everything else in the opinion is addressed to
the question whether this is properly a case for a three-judge
Court.
Mow, X suggest to you that if we were to disagree
with the Court of Appeals and Judge Travia, we ought pay no
attention to your argument on the merits

but send it back

to a three"judge Court to address the merits.

25
ME. MATHANSON:

I had based my statement on Footnote

5 in the Court of Appeals opinion in which the Court indicated
that under the circumstances —
Q

In the event that the complaint had been meritorious.
ME. NATHANSON:

I interpreted that to mean that

declaratory relief would have been appropriate even if the
Court found that there was a substantial claim, would not have
to have convened —
Q

Well, I gather you do agree that the threshold

question for us is whether or not the motion for a three-judge
Court should have been granted.
MR. NATHANSON:
Q

Yes, sir.

And in order to decide that, we have to consider the

merits of your Constitutional claim, don't we?
Q

Consider it but not decide it, if it should have been

for a three-judge Court.
Q

If we say three-judge Court, it is a question

of whether it is a substantial Federal question,and then
necessarily to have to give some thought to the merits.

We

don't decide the merits to decide whether there should be a
three-judge Court, just whether there is substantial Federal
claim which requires the convening of a three-judge Court.
I thought that's what this case was all about and
that's why we took it.
Q

Mr. Nathanson, can you enlighten me.

Suppose you had

26
simply sought declaratory relief

in

the District Court, or

what was it, the Eastern District, and not sought

m

injunction?

Regardless of Judge Travia*s opinion as to the
substantiality of the Constitutional claim, would that have
required the convening of a three“judge Court?
MR. 3ATHAKS0N:
Q

Ho.

X didn't think so.
MR. HATHANSON:

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Lewifctes.

ARGUMENT OF JOEL LENITIES, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES

MR. LENITIES:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Q

Are you going to address that question, Mr. Lewittes?
MR. LEWITTES:

Yes, I will.

I would, initially though, like to analyse these
two statutes and try and place this case, ix I nsay, in its
proper perspective*
The two statutes are Section 01 of the New York
Education Law, and that deals with the provision for the
furnishirg of textbooks in grades 7 through 12, and which
allows the local school beard to pay up to $10 for books per
child for the school year.

That's $10.

That’s the outside

limit they may spend in grades 7 through 12.
Section 703, dealing with the primary grades I through

27

6s speaks in terns of qualified voters of any school district
may vote a tax for textbooks.

If they do not, if they are

under the austerity program, then they may charge a rental
fee per year of $7,50 per child.
Now, this provision under 703, does not indicate
the heavy areas, the urban areas, in New York State, because
provisions there do allow the local school boards to provide
textbooks without a referendum, and authorize them so to do.
It is noteworthy as well, that in these large urban
areas, New York City, and we have set them forth, which they
are, Buffalo and Rochester, Syracuse and Yonkers, it is note­
worthy that these are concentrated areas of welfare.
So it is not quite justified on the part of the
petitioners here to claim that the State of New York is
discriminating against indigent welfare recipients.

As a

matter of fact, a large percentage of the welfare recipients
do reside in these urban areas and are beneficiaries of the
State statutes that do commit school textbooks to be distri­
buted without any charge or rental fee.
Q

You agree that Constitutional rights are personal

to the individual, don’t you?
MR. LEWITTES:

Yes, they are.

If I may, Justice Marshall, I am simply trying to
place this case in its perspective.
little out of hand.

I think it is getting a

28
Now, the $7.50 rental fee per year in grades 1
through 6, can actually be deemed a reasonable rate in light
of the $10 limit that’s applied in grades 7 through 12, under
Section 701, and because the declaration of policy in the State
of New York with regard to grades 7 through 12 is that because
of the added cost of the textbooks and the technical nature of
the textbooks, this heavy burden should not be passed on to
any o£ the children and the State has formulated that declara­
tion of policy in the statute itself.
So the $7.50 figure is a reasonable rate when we
look at the $10 rate in Section 701.
Now, in New York State prior to this Court’s decision
in Rosado against Wyman., there were special need grants for
AFDC or aid for dependent children, recipients included.

There

was included an item for textbooks in these special need grants.
This Court in Rosado determined that the State of
New York may not so proceed with special need grants.

There

must be a flat general grant.
And in following this Court’s dictates, New York's
Social Services law was amended to read so that Section 131-A
does eliminate all special grants, excluding rent and fuel,
but it includes textbooks and related educational expenses
under the general grant.
And the record shows,and it has been conceded by the
petitioners in this case, that when Rosado case was remanded

29
to the District Court., the District Court determined that
approximately $3 is included in the monthly grant for all
educational expenses for a family of four.
So that amounts to $36 per year for a family of
four.
Assuming that the 10% reduction is involved here,
then that would be $32.40 per year for educational expenses.
Now, we have just noted that the rental fee is
$7.50.

So that it is noteworthy that it is not an unjustifiable

rental fee.and that these petitioners can afford this, assuming
that they budget the welfare grants properly.
Q

How about poor people who are not on welfare?
MR. LENITIES:

Those poor people are not in the

class, I understand, this alleged class —
Q

I am just asking what happens to them?
MR. LEWITTES:

I assume, obviously, they are not

recipients of welfare, and therefore would not be getting this
$7.50, this $36.
Q

And would not be getting books.
MR. LEWITTES:

Q

Yes.

Technically, yes.

But you are not tying into welfare along with this

statute when it was passed, are you?
MR, LEWITTES:

Well, I think that we could conclude,

could we not, that the State Legislature, when it passed this
law which was passed in 1965, may have very well taken into

30
light the Social Service Law, and, in so doing,felt that it
would cover the educational costs but that the welfare statute
would not cover the educational costs when you got to the
higher grades because of the heavier cost of textbooks.
Therefore, the difference between 701 and 703.
Q

Of course, it could have been done by just giving them

the books.
MR. LEWITTES;
Q

Well, it is quite clear, is it not, -**

Am I correct?
MR. LEWITTES:

Yes, but it is quite clear, is it not,

that the State of New York really never has been in the business
of loaning textbooks or of selling textbooks.
May I also note, by the way, that the educational —
Q

How many States have this statute?
MR. LEWITTES:

We have a compendium and there are at

least 15 to 20 States that have this, if I am not mistaken.
The educational expenses —
Q

Do you think a child can be educated without books?
MR. LEWITTES:

Well, Justice Marshall, there are

theories in education today, they tell me, that children may be
educated without books.

As a matter of fact, some of the

theories claim that these textbooks are not at all helpful,
that they are doing away with -•
Q

What study was that?
MR. LEWITTES:

I believe it is mentioned —

31
Q

Aren’t there also studies that say if a child

doesn’t know how to read by junior college, forget about it?
Am I right on that?
MR. LEWITTES:

Well, yes, but they do not say that

it is because of the textbook that he knows how to read.
Q

Why do you allow for other people to buy them?
Why do you require them?
Aren't they required?
Ml. LEWITTES:

I think that the State of New York

statute does not require the textbooks —
Q

Doesn’t the State Board of Education require certain

textbooks?
MR. LEWITXES:

They have an approved list of text»

boohs, yes, Your Honor.
Q

Well, what’s that for?
MR. LEWITTES:

I am not saying «» I think the

question was asked of me was whether or not it is essential
that textbooks be used in education.
My answer was that I don’t think it is necessarily
true that I concede that because there are theories in
educational circles today
The question as to whether or not the State of New
York —
Q

What do you use in place of textbooks?
MR. LEWITTES:

I am not that familiar with the

32
theory.

It was noted, by the my, in the Circuit Court

dissenting opinion that there are theories -Q

Are you relying on them?
MR. LEWITTES:

Mo, I am just trying to answer your

question.
You asked me, I believe, whether or not one can be
educated without textbooks, and I am answering that there are
theories that; yes, the answer is yes.
If you are asking me whether in this particular
case the State of Mew York textbooks are involved in the
educational process, the answer is yes.
Q

Well, you know you go way back to before you had

schools, like President Lincoln, at least he had books.
MR. LEWITTES:

Well, I think with this modern age

today —
Q

I want you to show me somebody that's educated and

passed an examination without books.
MR. LEWITTES:

I can aay that with the visual aids

and the new developments in education —
Q

Do you have visual aids

in these schools in this

county?
MR. LEWITTES:

I think they probably do have visual

aids -Q

Probably, probably?
MR. LEWITTES:

I don’t think

—

33
Q

It is probable they have visual aids, and it is

probable they have this, but one thing is certain, these kids
don't have books, that is certain.
MR. LEWITTES:
the kids do have books.

But the thing that is certain is that
The school budget was voted and they

have books.
Q

And could that be changed next year?
MR. LEWITTES:

Well, it may be changed next year, but

let me say this, Justice Marshall, if I may.

It has been

determined that books are useable for 5 years.
Q

Could it be changed 5 years from now?
MR. LEWITTES:

Yes, it could, but I think the

history of the school district, as a matter of fact, it has
been alleged throughout that there were three votes that voted
down the budget.
As a matter of fact, it was one school year that
they voted down the budget.

Prior to that, they had always

voted for the budget.
I think that the fact of the matter is that because
of the welfare, and because these are welfare children that are
bringing this, I think the welfare grants do cover this.
In the alternative, I think we could argue, and I
say in the alternative because Dandridge talks in terns of
allocation of financial resources.
allocated.

We cover them.

I think we've more than

34

But In our own — New York State does have a finite
budget, and this is a welfare case.

*•

As much as they would like to construct this to be
one of fundamental liberty, it is not fundamental liberty.
They are not arguing that it is really fundamental liberty
because fundamental liberty would mean that the textbooks would
be available to all the students, whether they are rich or
poor.

.
They don’t say that here.

They say that we should

provide textbooks for indigents.
If it is a fundamental liberty, they should be
arguing it should be provided for all.
The fact of the matter is that it is not a fundamental
liberty.

It is not a question of fundamental liberty involved

here because I don't think we have to reach that issue.

I

think it is one of the welfare cases under the — one of
the social economic cases under Dandridge, and that we have
reasonably handled this problem with out Statute 701 with grades
7 through 12 and 703, 1 through 6.
Which is the most important accoutrement of an
education?

I don't think the State of New York has decided

this and should be held to decide.
The school lunch program is a very important factor,
no doubt.

In Briggs v. Carrlgan in the First Circuit, they

held that they could restrict school lunch programs to

35
secondary schools even though that fell heavily upon indigent
students who could not afford the lunches.
Q

How long have you had school books in Mew York?

Textbooks ?
Ml. LEWITTES:
answer that.

I frankly, Justice Marshall, cannot

I would say for at least 50 years.

Now, I would like to get — before I close, I would
like to get to the question -- Justice Brennan's question
yes, the only issue before this Court is whether or not

a

three judge*-court improperly was denied and that is the sole
issue here.
Of course, the merits have to be considered, but
have they raised a substantial Federal Constitutional question?
This Court in the California Mater Service v.
Redding, has set forth the test whether or not the case is
obviously without merit or whether it has been foreclosed by
prior decisions of this Court. I think that it is possible that
it has been foreclosed by prior decisions of this Court.
I think in Dandridge is the case that we could stand
on.

I think the language in Jefferson v. Hackney, as well.
I think that if they seek to attack the fact that

there is a voter referendum here, I think James v. VaItterra
covers that.
So, I think that it is clear that using either the
test of the unsoundness or whether it has been foreclosed by

36
previous decisions of this Court, I think that the three-judge
Court was properly denied below.
Q

Mr, Lewittes, I understood Mr. Kathanson, in response

to a question from Justice Brennan, to say that the Second
Circuit here at least relied on an alternate theory for not
convening a three-judge Court*

That is, that whatever — even

conceding that the Constitutional question might have been
substantial, the probability of injunctive relief would
be virtually non-existent.
And, therefore, even if the plaintiffs had prevailed
in their Constitutional claim, the most they would have gotten
is a declaratory judgment.
And, under those circumstances, that it was unnecessary
to convene a three-judge Court.
Do you agree or disagree with my —
ME. LEIIITTES:
Q

That is correct, yes.

Granting or not granting an injunction is part of the

evaluation the single judge must make in the first instance,
is it not?
MR. LEWITTES:
Q

Yes.

That's no different, I gather, than the assessment

that you’ve been suggesting had to be made to determine whether
there should have been a three-judge Court.
ME. LENITIES;
Q

Exactly.

So we don’t escape it by that footnote?

37
MR. LEWXTTES:
Q

Mo.

Mr. Lewittes, as I read the Second Circuit’s footnote,

Footnote 5 on page 65 of the record, their analysis of the
probability of an injunction doesn’t turn on the merits of the
Constitutional claim, but on whether injunctive relief under
the traditional equitable standard would be right,
I read that to suggest a test not based on the
ConstituSonal merits, but on whether injunctive relief, in this
or any other type of equitable action,would have been granted.
MR, LEW1TTES:

I think that's what they said in the

footnote with regard to that Astroeinema Corporation, but X
think a reading of the decision here in the Second Circuit
shows clearly that they used a traditional test as to whether
or not a substantial Federal question —
Q

Certainly that's the way Judge -- understood that

it wasn't ~~
MR. LEWITTES:
Q

Yes, exactly.

According to your brief, on May 3 of this year the

school district reversed its policy and is now furnishing
free school books to everyone.
MR. LEWXTTES:
Q

Is that right?

That is correct.

(inaudible)
MR, LEWITTES:

We do urge that and I have also added

the significant factor that because these books are useable for
5 years that even — it is not in the realm of clear probability

38
that we are going to have this problem —
Q

Is that the answer to Mr. Nafchanson's suggestion that

these budget elections are annual affairs?

What you are saying

is that the books that have been provided have a 5 year life.

MR.

LEWITTES:

Certainly.

They don't become obsolete

within one year.
Q

So that,at least for the next 5 years,children in

grades 1 to 6 are going to have textbooks in this school
district.
Q

One rental fee and that extends for 5 years?
MR. LEWITTES:

They pay one rental fee per year, but

the rental fee is only paid in case an austerity budget is
voted.
Q

I see.

Q

So that while it is technically capable of repetition,

you are suggesting, are you, that it is highly improbable that
it will recur, at least for 5 years?
MR, LEWITTES:

Exactly, I am.

Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Lewittes.

The time is up for Mr. Nathanson.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 10:53 o'clock, a.m., the oral
arguments in the above^entitled case were concluded.)
