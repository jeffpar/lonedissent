ORAL ARGUMENT OP FIRS. JEAN M. COON,
ON BEHALF OP THE APPELLANTS
MRS. COON:

Fir. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The statute at issue on this appeal, Chapter 138
of the New York laws of 1970, provides for payment by the
state to nonpublic schools within the state specific sums
of money as partial reimbursement of the expenses Qf
recordkeeping, testing end reporting incurred by the nonpublic
schools in complying with requirements of state law and
regulation.

The laws and regulations referred to have been

enacted for the purposes of the examination and inspection of
the nonpublic schools by the state.

The examination of this

statute to determine its validity must,

feel, be made in

the perspective of the total historical educational picture
in the state of New York.
Prom the creation of the University of the state
of New York in 1787, the Regents of that University and
subsequently the Commissioner of Education, as its adminis­
trative arm, have had general supervision over all
educational institutions in the state of New York, both

4
public and private»

All private educational institutions,

from elementary grades through colleges, receive their
charters from the Board of Regents.
The state education law gives the Commissioner of
Education the power to examine and inspect private as well as
public institutions of learning to determine whether or not
they comply with the compulsory attendance and instructional
requirements of the state law.
The state education law not only requires children
to regularly attend some school--either public or private—
but sets minimum standards of education, including course
content, which must be met by the schools which these
children attend, in order that their attendance does comply
with the compulsory attendance laws.
The importance of this supervisory function to the
state's concern relative to its children's education was
recognized by the framers of the state constitution in 1Q9I4.,
when in adding a provision prohibiting aid to sectarian schools,
the
they specifically excepted expenditures of money for/purposes
of examination and inspection.

In the carrying out of this

function of examination and inspection, and general supervision
in the state,
over the education provided by nonpublic schools,/the state
requires the schools to perform certain testing, recordkeeping
and reporting to the state.

Among these are the administration

of tests—including Regents Examinations--which are state-wide

5
tests of specific subject matter achievement, pupil evaluation
program tests in grades 6 and 9 and other general state-wide
evaluation tests also used in public schools.

And in addition,

the regulations of the Commissioner of Education require the
nonpublic schools to conduct a continuing program of
individual pupil testing in all grades to provide an adequate
basis for evaluating pupil achievement.
In addition to the testing program, the nonpublic
schools are required to maintain health records, records of
marks, attendance records, provide information under the
»

basic educational data system which includes statistical
information as to students, teachers, curricula offered,
physical plant, and so forth, and in the secondary schools,
additional data on a more detailed basis than in the basic
educational data system.
These requirements, imposed upon the nonpublic
schools by law or regulation, involve considerable additional
expense to the schools for which, immediately prior to the
enactment of Chapter 138? the schools were not compensated.
While immediately prior to the enactment of the
statute the schools were not compensated, the state has had
a long history of providing some compensation to some
nonpublic schools in recognition of the cost burden imposed
by the state, in assuring that the requirements of the
compulsory attendance laws are being met.

Beginning in 1892,

6
appropriations were made annually to so-called academies
for services in connection *jith the compulsory attendance
laws.

Those academies included sectarian and nonsectarian,

secondary nonpublic schools.
The provision for such compensation was retained
in the state's education lax< until 1930.

But even after

repeal in that year, appropriations continued to be made in
the state's local assistance appropriation bills in connection
with the attendance requirements of academic pupils.

Only in

the years between 1968 and the enactment of legislation at
issue here were no payments made to any nonpublic schools for
these purposes.
The legislation adopted in 1970, therefore, merely
reinstated a past practice of compensating nonpublic schools
for recordkeeping and examination services required by the
state, updated the amount paid to reflect current economic
conditions, and made the base of payment more equitable by
including all nonpublic schools and all state-imposed
examination and recordkeeping requirements.
The cost analysis studies made for the State
which
Education Department, and/are exhibits in this case—exhibits
D and G in the separate folder of exhibits submitted to the
court-~and which were made by three individuals acting
independently of each other, demonstrate that the payments
made to the nonpublic schools are justified in amount and

7
are still substantially less than the actual cost of the
performance of the services*
Appellees do not dispute these conclusions except
by alleging that the administration of tests is a part of
the teaching function of the nonpublic schools, and that
consequently Hew York is paying the schools for the cost of
education.

This is a matter of perspective.
From the state's point of view, we are not paying

the schools to administer tests apart of the educational
programs of the schools, but rather as a method of evaluating
the achievement of the schools in meeting minimum standards
of education.

This assumes that the teaching function, per

se, has been completed prior to the administration of the
test as a measuring device and we submit that this is a more
reasonable viewpoint on the aspect of the state’s payment in
this regard.
The past decisions of this Court have not prohibited
all payments or benefits to nonpublic schools, just as they
have not permitted all payments or benefits.
In Everson, the activities which were described
•MMWMMMUMn +

as prohibited were those directed to the aid of religion as
such.

In McGowan, this Court observed that the establishment

clause does not ban state or federal regulation of conduct
whose effect merely happens to coincide with the tenets of
»>

some religions.

8
Again, in Emerson, the Court expressed the concept
of neutrality, stating that the Constitution does not require
the state to be the adversary of religion.

In both Scliexnpp

and McGowan, this Court discussed the intent and effect test,
by xtfhich a statute is measured as to whether it has a secular
legislative intent and a primary effect which neither aids nor
inhibits religion.
In Walz, the test by which legislation was being
measured was expanded to include an evaluation as to whether
the statute at issue created an excessive entanglement between
church and state.

In discussing whether or not the New York

statute here at issue meets

Ejections under each of these

tests, we must bear in mind the observation of this Court's
opinion in Lemon--that the line between permissible and Im­
permissible legislation is not a wall but rather a blurred,
indistinct and variable barrier, depending upon all the
circumstances of a particular relationship.
Q,

Mrs. Coon, in this connection is the record

clear as to the fact of the state aid embracing or not
embracing teachers examinations as such, other than the
generalised tests that come out of the state offices?
MRS. COON:

Yes, your honor, because the State

Commissioner’s regulations require the nonpublic schools to
have a continual in-school program of testing of pupils to
measure educational achievement.

And that the testing

9
involved here includes not only the general tests imposed
by the state--which are statewide in applicati on--but also
the state’s examination of the tests administered in the
schools to determine whether or not the pupils in all grades
are meeting levels of educational achievement.
Q,

So that if a teacher gives a weekly quiz, her

time and the preparation of that quiz is a part of the cost
that1s considered?
MRS. COON:

That was included in the cost analysis

study, yes, your honor.
Q,

How does the state audit that?

How does the

state know whether the tests are executed?
MRS. GO®:

They require reports to be made to the

Commissioner of Education.
Q,

Reports on each individual pupil?

MRS. COON:
Honor.

On the results of testing, yes, your

Not by name, necessarily, but by a program of

evaluating the tests given the results of the test and Ikw
the pupils are measuring up in terms of whether or not
their measurement complies with the general standards of
education of children in similar grades in the public schools.
Q,

Is it possible for the New York statute to have

been construed more narrowly so as to, as not to include
what you have just told me is included?
MRS. COON:

It would be possible to so construe it.

10
That might raise a question as to the relationship to the
amount paid.

There was a cost analysis study which is exhibit

G, which referred only to the state-wide tests and comes to
less than the amount paid to the schools.

However, it should

also be noted that that particular cost analysis study, while
it related only to the state-wide tests, did not include the
other recordkeeping functions such as health records and
attendance records and so forth, which were included in the
other studies which included the teacher testing.
Q

Has this statute ever been construed by the

state courts?
MRS. COON:
Q,

Ho, your Honor, it has not.

It’s conceivable that they might have construed

the statute more narrowly, had it gone to them, if -MRS, COON:
Q,

It is conceivable, your Honor.

Mrs. Coon, it seems to me that one of the

subsidiary questions in this case might very well be whether
the process of testing can, in fact, be separated from the
basic, overall process of teaching.

Bearing that in mind, am

I correct in my understanding that all these tests are standard
tests prescribed by the state--prepared either by the state
or by some national testing agency?
MRS. COON:
Q,

No, your Honor, they are not.

They are —

Are any prepared by the local schools?

MRS, COON:

Yes, your Honor.

Thoy are required by

11
the Commissioner's regulations*
Q,

Right.

Are they all multiple choice tests?

Or may any of the tests be answered by narrative questions
that require discretion on the part of the teacher in
grading?
MRS. COON:

I would assume any type of test the

teacher would use is measuring whether or not her pupils
have understood and learned the material provided.
Now, of course, from the state's standpoint, it
should be remembered that the state is only concerned in
how these particular tests measure achievement as to the
subjects which are taught also in public schools.

It is

not a concern of the state nor would any cost analysis
process here be used tests which are directed solely to the,
to sectarian subjects or sectarian information.
Q,

Mrs. Coon, do I understand that there's a

difference betxtfeen the kinds of tests that are given in the
public schools from the kinds of tests that are given in the
nonpublic schools?
MRS. COON:

No, except in this regard, that there

is no specific regulation of the Commissioner which directs
the public schools to conduct a continuing testing program,
an in-school testing program.

The Education Department

relies more on its more direct and continuing supervision of
the public schools, in terms of the evaluation.

12
Q,

That Is, by members of the staff of the

Commission of Education?
MS. COON:

Well, right.

The staff and their

continuing relationship and much more direction supervision,
of course, over the public schools than they have over the
nonpublic.
Q

But they do have--*the state-wide tests are

given in the public schools, aren’t they?
MS. COON:

Yes.

Both in the public and nonpublic

schools.
Q

But the regulation doesn't require the public

schools to prepare their own tests, like it does the private
schools?
MS. COON:

It does not require them to conduct

this continuing program of testing-Q,

Yes.

MRS. COON:

—under this regulation.

It would

require them, certainly, to prepare any test which the school
itself intends to administer.

All tests administered in

public schools are not state-wide tests.

There are teacher-

prepared tests there as well.
Q,

What do you think the issue here is, Mrs. Coons?

Do you think its—or is it both--that the schools were paid
for this or that it entangles the state too much in the
school program?

13
MRS. COON:

I think that the issue is probably as

raised by the plaintiffs in this action, was more that the
schools were paid.

We submit that this problem of payment

produces considerably less entanglement than would a direct
administrative supervision.
Q,

How much audit is done of the --

MRS. COOK:

The only audit that has been done of

this has been the cost analysis studies which were done on a
selected schools basis, comparing the cost in public and
nonpublic schools.
Q,

There's no continuing auditing?

MS. COON;
Q

No, there is not.

The entanglement is actually in requiring the

tests.
MRS. COON:
Q,

Right.

And the supervision of performance?

MS. COCN:

Right, and we submit, your Honor, that

there would be much more entanglement involved here were the
state to have to send inspectors into the schools, or send
test administrators into the schools to perform this function
there--that the payment of the cost of administration and
recordkeeping produces substantially less entanglement than
would a direct supervision.
Q

I didn’t understand, Mrs. Coon, what supervision

is there of performance?

lk
MRS, COON:

Well, we submit, your Honor, that If

the state were not able to pay —
Q,

Yeah, but what--I'm sorry--but what's the nature

of the supervision of performance?
MRS, COON:

What form does that take?

VJell, the state has an interest, and I

think that this Court in Allen certainly said that the states
do have the interest in supervising.
Q,

I guess I haven't made my question clear yet.

I'm just trying to find out what's done--how do you supervise
performance?
MRS. COON:
from the schools.

By auditing the tests, by getting reports

The schools are required to submit

extensive reports, recordkeeping analyses, and so forth.
And to this extent —
Q,

I see.

Q,

That's what these tests are for, isn't it—-to

audit the performance of the school?
MRS. COON:
Q,

In terms of educational achievement?

MRS. COON:
Q,

That's what the tests are for.

Yes, precisely.

Whatever entanglement there is, is really

without regard to payment, then.
MRS. COON:

That's quite true, your Honor.

The

payment, we feel, merely compensates them equitably for
supplying this particular service to the state.

We submit

15
that there is no entanglement.
Q,

Teaching is mandated by the state, too, isn't it?

MRS. COON:
Q,

Yes, it is, your Honor.

So under your theory, they could pay the whole

budget money?
MRS. COON:

Oh no, no, your Honor.

so because I think there's a difference.

I don't think

The teaching function

of the schools was undertaken voluntarily by the schools as
education.

The fact that the state's requirement which has

been superimposed upon the schools of keeping all these
records and reporting, and so forth, for the state has been
an involuntary function of the schools and we submit that
having imposed this requirement upon them, involuntarily,
that we should be able to compensate them for at least part
of the cost of it.
Q,

Don't they impose teaching upon them, too?

MRS. COON:

Only since they have voluntarily

undertaken to establish themselves as a school.

And to that

extent, the teaching function has been voluntarily, we submit,
undertaken by the schools.
Q,

Isn't this really a part of, sort of a condition,

isn't it of satisfying the compulsory attendance law?
the school have to do this?
MRS. COON:
Q,

Does

It can just —

Oh yes, they would have to do this.

They would have to do it or the students

16
wouldn't be satisfying the compulsory school attendance laws?
MS. COON:

That's quite truef your Honor.

think that there's more to this than this.

But we

I think there's

certainly a state interest and function here in seeing that
these pupils are not only in school, but that they are
receiving certain qualities of education and so forth.

And

I think that the state has the interest in compensating the
schools for all the recordkeeping and detailed functions
that we have imposed upon them.
Q,

Do the teachers-f just following up my brother

Douglas' question~-do the teachers in private and parochial
schools have to meet certain standards imposed by the states,
or do they have to be—in the gtate of Nev? York—or do they
have to be certificated in any way?
MS. COON:

Not in this program, your Honor.

However,

there are extending certificating requirements under other
programs and that certainly the basic educational data system
which they have to file with the state, does request infor­
mation concerning the education of the teachers.
Q,

But there's no requirement as to the educational

or professional qualifications of the teachers in these
schools?
MS. COON:
Q,

Not in the, not as far as -*

The teachers, as far as the state goes, could be

i>/holly illiterate, for instance?

1?
MRS. COON:

I don't think that they're—well* if

they were xjholly illiterate and could teach the students in
a manner in which -Q,

They'd be quite extraordinary teachers, I agree

with you.
(Laughter)
MRS. GOON:

I would think so.

I think that the

thing the state is interested in here is the result -~
Q,
are there?

But there are no standards for the teachers,
As there are in the public schools, of course.

MRS. COON:
Q,

Not in this regard, your Honor.

There are standards for courses, are there not?

MRS. COON:

There are standards of courses, yes.

There are certain courses that must be taught in the schools.
And there are certain levels of achievement they have to
reach —
Q

Then the state could finance the teaching of

those courses?
MRS, COON:

Yes, your Honor.

No, no, no.

No,

because as I said, again, this relates to the fact that the
schools have voluntarily established themselves as schools.
To that extent, we would agree certainly with the decision
of this Court in Lemon--that the state cannot pay for the
teaching function.

What we're saying here is we're paying

for a neutral, a non»ideologieal function of the schools,

18
simply a recordkeeping program and an achievement measurement
program.
Q

But the District Court couldn't even figure out

whether the amount paid equalled the cost to the schools or
exceeded it.
MS, COON:

Well, in this particular instances we

have the stipulated cost analysis studies, that are in the
record, which indicates that the amount paid to the schools
is substantially less than the actual cost of the program
itself.
Q,

Was that stipulated?

MRS. COON:
Q

Yes, your Honor, it was.

That was on a, not a school by school, that was

a sample basis.
MRS. COON:

That was a selected measurement between

public and non-public schools.
Q,

Prom your response to one of the earlier

questions, it would seem to me at least, that New York gt&te
is unique in not having any standards or qualifications for
the teachers.

Some of the states at least have the same

requirements applied to private and parochial church schools
as for public schools.

Are you sure that New York doesn't

require those same standards for the teachers in a church
school?

If a college degree is required to teach eighth

grade or junior high school and public schools, are you

19
telling us that that is not required?
MRS* COON:

That has not been required in the past

in New York, no.

There is, I believe, some—certainly going
I believe
to be some--as more and more lay teachers/reach the schools,
there’ll be more and more qualifications imposed.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

I understand,

Mr. Chandler, that you will reserve your time for rebuttal?
MR. CHANDLER:

Yes, your Honor.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Pfeffer.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEO PFEFFER, ESQUIRE
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
Q

Mr, Pfeffer, before you start, on this last

question, did you understand that situation in New York?
MR, PFEFFER:

I understand it, yes.

That is the

situation in New York.
Q

That is unusual, isn't it?

MR. PFEFFER:

It is rather unusual, and it's the

reality of the influence and political power which groups
have in New York which has been able to resist this.
Q

Meli, I don’t think that's too unusual.

Through our people and our family, I knox* quite a good many
of them who are college graduates who have had jobs in
private schools, but who couldn't get jobs in public schools
because they hadn't had the necessary courses in education.
That's not too unusual.

Some of the best private schools in

20
the country have teachers who could not get jobs in public
schools.
MR. PFEFFER:

Well, that’s entirely true, yes,

your Honor.
Q

Because they haven't had the necessary courses

in education.
MR. PFEFFER:
the general level.

The question was whether they are on

There are exceptional persons who have

innate genius, but on a general level — a general level, it
is assumed, a general assumption that they have the training
that is necessary for effective teaching.
Q

The state does accredit or withhold credit from

private schools, as I understand it.
MR. PFEFFER:

Is that correct?

On the elementary school level?

don't know that the state accredits in that sense.

I

There is

overall right of the power of visitation vrtiich is as I under­
stand it.

In my state, the State Board of Education

is available,to colleges and universities and the state has
standards for accrediting and those standards include the
number of days children must attend school.
certain courses.

It requires

It requires certain minimum requirements

with respect to teachers.

I don’t know whether this record

contains that information or not.

I don’t recall it at the

21
moment.
MR. PFFEFFER:

I don’t think the record contains —

my own understanding is that it doesn’t have it, at least on
the elementary school level.

It may have it on the secondary

school level.
The position of the Appellees in this case is that
this Act, Chapter 138, is not what it purports to be, but
whether it is considered what it really is or whether it is
considered what it purports to be, it is equally unconsti­
tutional under the Establishment Clause.
The Act purports to be a law to compensate private
schools for certain services which are mandated by law and
regulation.

But aside from a sort of talismanic

reference

to it, perhaps to satisfy the purpose-effect requirement
which had been expressed before this law was enacted, the
declaratory — the declaration of purpose refers to these nongraded services of testing and recordkeeping and that is the
last thing that is in the law.
The rest, the operational act, the policy act, has
no reference to it.

Each school gets a specific amount per

child, $28 for each pupil, grades one through six,
each pupil, grades six through twelve.

for

It matters not whether

the — this is the way the rule is interpreted and applied
by the state — it matters not what is the actual cost of
these mandated services in a particular year if it is $1 or $5

22
or $10, the school gets $28 per student or $45 per student
without regard to what is the expense.
The school is not required to account for the money.
It gets the money personally and does with it what it will.
Q

Could it avoid giving the tests entirely?

MR. PFEFFER:
Q

Very strictly, it could.

Now, let me

Would it still get the $28 and the $45 if they

didn't —?
MR. PFEFFER:

According to the application and

construction of the statute by the state, yes.
what is expressed in the Exhibit G.

And this is

Exhibit G, which was a

second of these illegal cost analyses, made months before
the law was enacted, but after the law suit was started for
the purpose of defending the law suit.
selected
They took a few/schools and they found out what?
They found out in these few selected schools in the
first test — or in both tests — that about two-thirds of
the amount — and this is two-thirds of the amount, which is,
was found to be the cost — is used for inschool, which means
teachers examinations.

Only one-third, which was found in

both tests, only one-third can be ascribed to examinations
such as those which come from the state, the recordkeeping,
everything else and the defendants brief — the defendants
brief admits — it’s on page 16 of defendant’s brief.

It

says the State of New York admits that — at the bottom of the

23
page — that the ove whelming majority of tests —
Q

Where are you now, on page —

MR. PPEPPER:
Q

On page ~

— 16 of the brief?

MR. PPEFPER:

— 16 of the main brief of Defendants

Levitt and Nyquist, your Honor, the brief of the State of
New York, near the end of the bottom of the page.
"The overwhelming majority of tests given in public
and nonpublic schools alike are formulated, administered and
graded by teachers."
These are the tests which take care of two-thirds
of the whole course.

We eliminate that and you have an

amount which is conceded to be substantially less than the
amount which is given per student.
But even that is not relevant because the state
takes the position that it is irrelevant how much money
is spent for these nongraded services.

The amount is

given per pupil and not on the basis of what the cost is.
These costs and amounts were never required by law.
made

They were

merely for the purpose of preparing for this — for this

case, apropos of the suit and the state states in its
interrogatories which is in paragraph three — it does not
ask what the money is for.

It doesn’t require any reporting

and it takes the position that the amount is fixed by law
and this is the amount which is unchangeable t whether the

24
costs go up or go down.
Now, there’s another point I’d like to call to the
Court’s attention.

I think Mrs. Coon,

you’re correct in

stating that this money Is used to reimburse full expenditures
already made.
The law was passed in 1970 to take effect the
following year and each year the school gets, per pupil,
according to the amount of students during that current year.
The first year, the school is allowed to choose the

take to measure the number of students it has and for that
year, that is the number taken

for the $28 or $45.

Thereafter, the year before the current year is
used as a base year but the payment is not made for the base
year.

They've already been paid for the base year.

The payment

is made for the current year and that provides that in the
event that there is a difference between the student Involve­
ment through the current year or the base year, an adjustment
is made accordingly.
Moreover, the Act provides that the payment is to
be made in two portions, one is payable January 15th.

The

other is paid April 15th, for the current year.
Now, April 15th is two and a half months before the
end of the school year.

There Is nothing in the Act or its

administration which prevents a school teacher or school

saying to the teachers, "We are short of money for our
religious teaching.

Use all that money for the two and a half months we

are going to get now — use all that money to pay for
catechism, to pay for religious worship."
According to the State of New York, that is
perfectly permissable.

There are no strings attached to this

money, no reporting, no auditing, the only auditing required
is to establish how many students there are during the year.
Q

Of course, if New York set up a system of

strings attached in auditing, then you ifould be here saying
there was too much entanglement, wouldn't you?

Mr. Pfeffer, don’t you think that New York

Independent of the First Amendment religion

MR. PFEFFER:

The Attorney General is defending this

Q

Well, could he bring a suit in the state court

asserting that the school, a particular school or a whole

MR. PFEFFER:

I've devoted myself up till now to the law as

in any way account for the money

This is substantiated and established by the

interrogatories submitted to the state and the response to it
on Appendix pages 87a and 88a in which the state says”the
qualifying schools are not required to submit reports
accounting for the moneys received and how they are expended.”
Also

— that means It is a free — they have a

free hand on It, no strings attached.
Also, I want to call to the Court's attention the
fact that, as applied — and this comes from the second of
the in

litem cost analysis made by the state after the suit

was started, that in two typical schools that they selected,
the Catholic Central High School and the North Shore Hebrew
Academy — and I point this out, I give this reference on
page 20 of my brief — the school» the first
received $77,878.

school

Let's say, $77,000 Under the law.

Taking in account everything other than teacher's

30

examinations, that means these Regent's Examinations and pupil
evaluation tests, recordkeeping, healthkeeping, everything
conceivable under the Act, which is mandated — which is
not mandated and this includes indirect costs and so-called
"kind and benefit costs" which these teachers give as inkind;
taking all, according to the state's own cost analysis, the
sum total of all these, the most liberally interpreted
mandated service is $24,674 which is less than one-third of
the amount received in the Statute.
The only way you can justify this Statute is the
other two-thirds of it is if teachers* examinations, the kind
of examination which the teachers give in every school, oral
or written, daily quizzes, weekly quizzes, are included; you
get two-thirds of the sum total is that.
The same is true of the second, also on page 20, the
second typical school, North Shore Hebrew Academy.

They had

received $5,400.

MR. PFEFFER:

It’s all in Exhibit V and Exhibit T.

$5,400 this North Shore Academy received under the statute.
Its total cost for other than inschool teachers testing is
$1,776, again less than one-third.
So that in answer to the question which
Mr. Justice Blackmun put, if this statute were interpreted
narrowly to limit it only to these — to exclude teachers
tests and quizzes, the guts of the statute would be out.
Two-thirds of the amount would be destroyed.

Now,

there is no question that is not what is intended.
Nov;, assume

the statute is what it says it is.

I

will now, at this point, accept the statute at face value
and accept that teachers examinations, the kind of examination
which is done every day in school, it's taken two-thirds of
the time — that that is properly within the state.
It is our opinion that this statute is unconsti­
tutional on its face for a variety of reasons.

Mr. Pfeffer, to discuss this further, suppose

private schools the choice of either having the state supply
the service on mobile medical units or to let the private
schools engage the services themselves with their own
physicians and pay them $5 a hear or $10 a head.

What would

you say about that?
MR. PPEPPER:

I think that was constitutional

provided, Mr. Chief Justice, provided the schools were
required to account that they did that particular thing, that
they used the money for that purpose for the inoculations.
But that's not required here.

But that would be entanglement.

No, that would not be entanglement.

This is the difference between this case and Everson and
Allen.

There is no religious aspect to the inoculation.

.......................................................

A

But as the Court
.

pointed out in Lemon against Kurtzman, there is-Srworld of
difference in the teaching.

A teacher can — and this is

from the Lemon case — a teacher can — some may and some
may not — may use the teaching for the purpose oJf
indoctrinating religion and this is exactly equal with respect
to testing.

-«m

'

If you include inclass testing, and I have put
forth in my brief examples of testing in respect to the most
value-free subject, mathematics and I have given examples of

34
the texts which were actually used and proposed and vrtiich are
fully impregnated with religious values.
Now, I don't say that the school — any of the
schools in New York use those texts.

I don't know whether

they do or they don't, but it is not important.

The point

that is important is that — is that the point is that to
make sure, as they must do, in order to avoid financing
religion, to make sure that it doesn't do it, this state has
an obligation to maintain a continuing surveillance.
Q

Well, that would be true in the inoculation

case because the school might take the money and use it for
religious teaching, and therefore, the state would have to
be assured that the school had not done that and that would
entangle the state with the school, would it not?
MR. PPEPPER:

The entanglement would be limited, not

to examining what is taught, but limited to a doctor's
certificate, yes, we inoculated 50 students here and we got
paid $250.

There is no entanglement there.

That's not the

Q

Did I understand you to say that they could

did, I don't believe that would be unconstitutional.

MR. PFEFFER:

Because giving the money there» it

The only law that would be violated would be

the Christian Science tenets.
MR. PFEFFER:

Well, if they — if the Christian

Science school accepted it and used it for inoculations, that
is all right.

That would be all right.

I think so.

Now, the point is, I think it is completely
unrealistic, I think it just is a fact of the world to seek
to divorce testing, day-by-day testing, examinations written
or oral in the future from the days of Plato when testing has
been the basic way of teaching, the major way of teaching
religion, as the Catechism, the traditional Catechism, it4s
a form of teaching by testing.

Their teacher asks questions

and the student answers.

If the student answers correctly, he

has learned his lesson.

If he answers incorrectly, he studies

some more.
Every student knows that in order to pass his course,
he has to pass examinations.

How do you pass examinations?

You give the teacher what the teacher wants.
Now, you take the two schools here, the Catholic
Academy or

the Hebrew Academy and the Catholic School.

Or, take a question on the origins of

I am sure that a student in the North Shore

Hebre\tf Academy would not — if he wants to pass the course -answer that question the same way that a student in the
Catholic

Central School would do it.
Teaching is with tirades.

One way, the least

effective way, is for the teacher to stand up in front and
lecture and lecture and then send the students home,
A most effective way is for the teacher to get it
from the students.

That is the way it is done and the

state says that applies to everyday teaching, written and
oral.
Q

Mr. Pfeffer, do you know, has the ROTC Program

ever been tested in any of the federal courts or state courts.
MR. PPEPPER:

There is no such case that I know of.

.1 don’t think that applies here because these are elementary
schools, grades one to six.
Q

Yes, but it is —

MR. PPEPPER:
Q

But I don’t know of any such case.

That still has some entanglement and gives

some aid to church-operated institutions, does it not?
MR. PPEPPER:

Well, the — my answer to that would

be that ROTC is generally, as far as I know, up till now, at

38
the college level and in Tilton versus Richardson, this Court
held that there were more liberal rules in respect to — at
the college level than with respect to elementary and high
school levels so that I don’t think it would necessarily be
the same answer.

I would have reservations on the elementary

and secondary schools.

I would certainly have reservations

on them.
Now, in Lemon, this Court said that — in Lemon

and

!)iCenso — that the state of Rhode Island and the State of
Pennsylvania were obligated under the Constitution’s
statute to see to it that the money given to the teachers
was used only for secular teaching, that it could not give
them the money and say, use it for secular teaching, but make
no examination, no verification of whether it is being used
for the purpose and then the Court went on and said, but that
very verification — in answer to Mr. Justice Rehnquist’s
question — that very auditing, that very surveillance, that
very required, constitutionally and statutorily required
assurance that It was not used for sectarian instruction
or religious worship, that involved that surveillance which
from Wala through Lemon the Court said Is forbidden by the
establishment clause.
Yes, it is true that if there were no audits here,
as there Isn’t, we claim it is unconstitutional because it is
financing, subsidising religious education and If there is

39
audits and there is surveillance and there is policing, we say
it is unconstitutional because involved in entanglement but
that is not our dilemma, that is the dilemma of the
establishment clause.

That is the dilemma of the history of

over 150, 175 years where state after state, court after
court, constitution after constitution said you cannot do what
you are trying to do here.

You cannot take tax-raised funds

and use it to pay part of the operating costs, whether it is
required by law or not required by law, of church schools.
This is what it is all about as to what the
establishment clause says and
no to,

this is what the Court said

that long before there was a public school system,

there was a religion clause and that the policy, the
constitutional interests which were set forth in the religion
clause, antedated our educational system.
Our educational system had to shape itself to the
establishment and free exercise clauses, not the establishment
and free exercise clauses to shape themselves against the
educational interests.
This is what this case is about.

This case says as

the court below said, you cannot take an Important element of
the budget of a church school and offer it — you cannot take
it off the voluntary contributions of those who adhere to it,
and make it an obligation of every taxpayer.

This is a

violation of what the establishment clause of the Constitution

requires.
Thank you very much.

MR. CHANDLER:

The answers to our interrogatories

Q

Yes.

All right.

MR. CHANDLER:

Spell that out completely.

We are here — in this case, this statute has been
enacted, a unique statute, in reliance on the language of this
Court in the Allen case.

This Court there said, "If the

state must satisfy its interest in secular education through
the instrument of the private schools, it has a proper interest
in the manner in which those schools perform their secular
education function."
That is what we say this act was designed to do.
It has already been brought out but should be
emphasized again that public and private schools in the
State of New York are part of one system and subject to one
set of controls.

They have been under the University of the

State of New York since 1784.

They have been required to be

compulsorily examined, tested and inspected since, 'I think,
1852.

Take the case of a child who goes to a Catholic high

school.

He has to take courses prescribed by the Regents

of the State of New York.

His attendance records are kept.

takes examinations and when he takes them, they are the same
as the so-called

"Regents Examinations."

They are the same

examinations that are given down the street in George
Washington High School and if he passes them, he gets a
diploma.

And who does he get the diploma from?
He gets the same diploma as his friend down the

He

43
street.

He gets the diploma signed, not by the Bishop, not by

the Pastor, but by the Commissioner of Education of the State
of hew York.
The degree of control is illustrated by one regula­
tion which is that if a school, public or private, wants to
give a course where there is not already an approved syllabus,
permission from the State Education Department must be had
before that course is to be taught.
Mr. Pfeffer's arguments and his bookkeeping depend
upon one fundamental fallacy.

He overlooks the fact that this

You

have to fill that out in order to get' the money and you have
to certify that you have conducted the testing requirements,
that you have kept attendance requirements and done all the
other things required by the mandated services.

pocket.

Well, It — It's a partial

reimbursement because it Is less than the cost that the
school undertook.
Q

Well, could it be a contribution?

MR. CHANDLER:

A contribution toward that, but the

point that I am make is, the school — whatever it Is, the

school is out the money.

It has performed the services.

It

gets back a partial — not larger — a partial reimbursement
and that partial reimbursement

of course becomes its own

money.
Let me go back to an analogy.

What about the parent

Was that money segregated

or marked or tainted by sectarian Influence?

No.

When he

got it back, he could use it to put in the plate, he could
use It to go to the races.

It ivas a reimbursement for a

legitimate expense.
So, with all respect, I say that this talk about
l.

audits is completely beside the point.

The point is that the

school is required to perform a large number, an appalling
number of administrative services for the state.
One side illustration, I just happened to notice
that the records of attendance and other basic data in
connection with these applications are required by the state
to be maintained open to inspection in the school's files for
at least 50 years.
Did the parent In the textbook case who was relieved
of the cost of buying textbooks* did he get sectarian money?
Was it sectarian reimbursement?

No.

The point I am making is that as this is a
reimbursement for funds already expended, it is completely

46
immaterial where the money goes.
The partial reimbursement was deliberately fixed
by law in the judgment of the legislature, which should be
conclusive and it was fixed in such a way that there would be
no overage.

The cost studies made aftex'’ the suit vms brought

all bear that out.
Let me give you just one little illustration from
one of the Exhibits.

In mode two they studied how much it

cost the schools to perform the mandated services.

They took

a public high school and a Catholic high school and a public
elementary school and a Catholic elementary school and
applied the same bookkeeping tests to both *of them to see
how much it cost.
Holy Trinity High School in Hicksville, for doing
the state's bookkeeping for it, it cost thst

school $232.90

per pupil and they got back $45.
Hicksville High School in the same time, same town,
it cost them $361.72, one-third more.
Corpus Christi Elementary School in Minneola,
Catholic, it cost them $77.56 to do the state’s work for it.
They got back $27»
Willis Avenue Elementary Public School across the
street, it cost them $474.12 to do the same services and so,
as for all the other —
Q

Mr. Chandler, why do you think there was such

i! 7
a variation in these cost figures?
MR. CHANDLER:
Q

Well —

Among the schools?

MR. CHANDLER:

Variation?

Well, apparently,

because the Catholic schools pinch their pennies a bit tighter.
The Minneola High School —
Q

Well, there is quite a variation from $^00~plus

in the one instance and $77 in another.
MR. CHANDLER:

The Minneola High School may have —

I believe that was a new school with not too large an
enrollment and it may have come to more.

That — uh — but

let me take ours from the same study.
Holy Family Elementary in Hicksville, it cost them
$86, got back $27.

The Dutch Lane Elementary School, it cost

them $198, still much larger but not quite as large as the
Minneola figure.
You see, it simply shows that there is no padding
and no excess and that applying the same bookkeeping methods
fairly to both public and private schools shows, or demonstrates,
the fact that there can be no overage and no excess.
As a matter of fact, all three judges in the trial
court agreed that there was no excess.

Judge Palmier! pointed

it out very forcefully in his dissent.

The other judges said

that if you take out of account teacher exams, then the costs
are — then the reimbursement might in some instances exceed

48
the cost.

But the point is, we maintain that the teacher

exams should, not be taken out.

They are in the statute.

They are specifically provided for in a regulation which ray
opponent has not even cited in his brief.
I see time is running very short and I will close,
your Honor, with one further thought.
about dilemmas today.

We’ve heard something

Consider this dilemma:

The state has

a right to have parochial schools perform effectively.

It

has a right to have testing and examination done, not for the
purpose of educating them, but for the purpose of seeing how
well they are being educated.
If it admittedly costs the schools a lot of money
to do it, if relief of this sort is not allowed, there is
another alternative that once comes up — may I just finish
my sentence? — a corps of state inspectors.
If It is all wrong to reimburse a school for doing
this kind of work, it is obviously all right to send a patrol
of Inspectors in every Monday, Wednesday and Friday to keep
attendance records, to give examinations, fire the teacher
from the room for the moment and give an examination and do
all the bookkeeping work.
That would require quite a few more people in
Albany and would, I think, result in entanglement of a sort
that has been conceived.
