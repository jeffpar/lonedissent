ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT R. GRANUCCI, ESQ.,
OK BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GRANUCCIs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
This case comes here on a writ of certiorari to
review a judgment of the United States Court of Appeals from
the Ninth Circuit, reversing an order of the United States
District Court for the Northern District of California?
denying Mr. Bustamonte’s petition for a writ of habeas
corpus.
The questions presented ares
One, whether the court of appeals erred in holding
invalid the search based upon a verbal expression of consent
in an atmosphere free of coercion, on the sole ground that
the State had failed to demonstrata that consent was given
with knowledge that it could be withheld.
The second point is somewhat broader.

It is;

whether questions relating to search and seizure should be
made available to state prisoners seeking to set aside a
final conviction on federal habeas corpus.
A jury found Robert Clyde Bustamonte guilty of

4
possessing a completed check with intent to defraud»

At the

trial three stolen and forged checks were admitted into
evidence over defense objection»
The facts of the case are theses
On January 19, 1967« the Speedway Car Wash in
Mountain View, California, a town about 30 miles south of San
Francisco, was burglarised®

A number of blank checks and a

check protector were taken.

Subsequently these checks were

completed by respondent Bu&tmonte, using the check protector
and forging the ear wash owner's name.
Bustament©, together with Joe Alcala and Jo© Gonzales,
them sat out to cash the checks.
On the evening of January 30, the three proceeded
to San Jose, to find persons who might b© willing to use
false identification to cash the checks and give them the
proceeds.
They picked up three :aen, but their efforts to
cash the checks were unsuccessful.
About 2:45 -»
QUESTION:

Can you connect the picking up of the

three men with the efforts to cash the checks?
MR. GRANUCCI:

Yes, that was the —

QUESTION: That was the purpose of their association
at that moment?
MR, GRANUCCIt Yes.

This evidence came out at the

5
trial.

It appears in the opinion of the California Court of

Appeals.
At 2:45 the following morning, as the six man were
drying along the highway, a police officer on patrol
noticed that their car had only one functioning headlight.
He made a U-turn to follow the car, and then saw that it had
nc rear license plate light, either.

He then stopped the car.

Gonsales was driving and Alcala and Bustamante were in the
front seat.

Three other men were in the rear.

Gonsaies had no driver’s license, nor any
identification.

Neither did anybody else, except Mr. Alcala,

who produced his driver’s license and stated that the ear
belonged to his brother.
The officer who was along asked the men to step
out of the car.

Meanwhile he had called for a backup patrol.

After the officer was joined by two other police
officers, he .asked. Alcala if he could search the car.

Alcala

replied, "Sure, go right ahead.”
v

Gonsales# who testified at the trial, corroborated
this statement and testified that Alcala even assisted in the
search.

In the search the officers found three protectoris©d

checks, wadded up under the rear seat.
payable to different named individuals.

These checks' were
Later on a search

warrant was obtained to search Bustamonte's own two
automobiles.

There the searching officers found other blank

5
Speedway checks, the check protector, and a number of traffic
citations relating to Bustamonfce.
The writing on the checks was that of Bustamonte.
At the trial, and oh appeal in the California
Coart of Appeals, oar intermediate appellate court, Bustamonte
contended that Alcala's consent to search was invalid,
because Alcala had not been warned of his right fco refuse
consent.
Th® California Court of Appeal rejected this
contention*

It applied the established State standard ' for

judging consent searches * first articulated by a former State
Chief Justice, Robert Trainer, the ultimate of California's
exclusionary rule, declared six years prior to Mapp v« Ohio.
And this is the California consent rule, as stated
by Justice Traynors
"Whether in a particular case an apparent consent
was in fact voluntarily given or was in submission to an
expressed or implied assertion of authority, is a question of
fact to ba determined in the light of all the
circumstances."
Here the California Court of Appeal concluded that
the consent was voluntarily given, because it was verbally
stated by Alcala, in response to a request for permission to
search.

There is no overt coercion, nor was there any

implied assertion of authority.

Indeed, the Court of Appeal

1
noted that the atmosphere at the time of the car stop was
congenial»
The California Supreme Court then denied Mr»
Bustamont© * s petition for a discretionary hearing of the
appeal»

In May 1969- Bustamonte filed in the United States
District Court for the Northern District of California a
petition for a writ of habeas corpus.

The petition was

denied on February 10, 1970, without an issuance of an order
to show cause, but the reason that the District Court did
recite, that the federal judge had before him the opinion
• •

of the California Court of Appeal.
The District Court also granted a certificate of
probable cause, and Xe&v© to appeal to the Ninth Circuit.
In September IS71, the Ninth Circuit Court of
Appeals vacated the order of the District Court and remanded
the matter for further proceedings.
California

That court held that

had failed to show that the consent was valid,

because there was no specific showing that Alcala knew that
he could refuse permission to search.
There we coma to the crux of the problem.
California's consent rule, analogous to the rule
articulated by this Court prior to Miranda for assessing the
voluntariness of confessions, makes knowledge of one's
rights one of the circumstances to be considered in

8
determining voluntariness*

It is a relative fact, but it

is not the determinative fact.
stances*

It is only one of the circum­

The Ninth Circuit opinion makes it determinative.

It lias substituted its waiver standard for California’s
voluntariness test.
In effect, it held that Justice Traynor5s rule for
assessing voluntariness was unconstitutional.
So the question before the Court today is not the
relative merits of the

Ninth Circuit waiver of rule, or

the California voluntariness rule.

The question iss

Could

the Ninth Circuit impose its Federal rule on the State, when
the State had an equally valid rule?
Now, the Fourth Amendment is not absolute in its
terms.

This Court has said many times that it does not

prohibit all searches, only unreasonable searches.
The conceptual basis of the California consent rule
is simply this:

It is not unreasonable for an officer to

act on permission to search granted in response to a request
therefor, under circumstances free from overt coercion or
any implied assertion of authority.
No more than this is required.

Since we're

judging reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment —■ it’s
not absolute? it's relative — and reasonableness of
governmental action cannot, and it should not, foe judged
solely by the affected party’s subjective state of mind.

9
That a subjective waiver standard is inappropriate in Fourth
Amendment cases becomes clear when we examine three distinct
lines of authority.»
The first of these is third-party consent cases.
As recently as Coolidge v. New Hampshire, and Frasier v. Cugp,
this Court, with little if any division on the point, held
that a third party could consent to a search of a subject's
property where the consent was given under circumstances showing
it was voluntary.
This seems to me to militate against a waiver
standard.

If we were talking about Fifth and Sixth Amendment

rights, surely this Court would not countenance a third
party’s waiver of a defendant’s Miranda rights, his right to
counsel, or his right to a jury trial.

Indeed, the decision

in Boykin v. Alabama indicates that these rights must be
waived personally by the defendant*
The second line of authority consists of those
cases including Hill v. California, which have held that the
reasonableness of an officer’s actions in making an
arrest are to be judged on the basis of how they appear to
him*

tod a reasonable mistake of fact will not invalide an

arrest*
Significant].}/, in Stoner v. Californ.1 a, referred to
in the earlier argument this morning, the Court rejected the
purported action based on the consent of a hotel clerk, because

10
the Court specifically said that the police could not
reasonably believe that the hotel clerk had authority to
consent to the search of the room,
I think, conversely, this indicates that if the
police had reasonably believed that the man had authority to
consent, the Court would have sustained their actions*
And Idle third line of cases supporting our position
are that overwhelming trend of authority which rejects the
requirement of a specific warning in search and seiaure.eases,
We've cited them in the brief, they are quite numerous.
Now, not only — these cases are significant, because
wherever this Court has imposed a waiver standard, the
.necessity of a warning has followed shortly thereafter.
And there are good reasons for not requiring warnings
in consent to search cases.
For one thing, it certainly is not calculated to
improve police-community relationships, because in some cases
police do ask permission to search, and if they are refused,
they are entitled to search on separate grounds.

For example,

exigency, or probable cause to search a moving vehicle.
Also, unlike a confession case, where the giving of
a confession shortly after a waiver of Miranda rights is
itself evidence that the rights were understood and waived.
The mere existence of tangible products obtained in a search
are no proof that a warning was given and a waiver obtained.

11
Third, the Miranda rule was intended to forestall
conditions whichwouXd give rise to coerced confessions, the
most unreliable kind of self“incriminating evidence.

The

exclusionary rule, on the other hand, does not go to the
reliability of the fact-finding process.
Finally, although this was discounted by the Court
Of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, it does make good sense to
say, as did the California Court of Appeal in this case,
that when permission is sought from a person of ordinaryintelligence, the very fact that consent is given carries the
implication that an alternative of refusal existed.
QUESTION;

Mr. Granucci, you said that the existence

of a confession is itself evidence that the. Miranda right was
understood and waived, whereas the production of tangible
goods is not.

I don’t think I quite understand your position

at least stated that shortened.
MR. GRANUCCI;

I think that perhaps I have to

expand them a bit.
Where an officer testifies that he warned a suspect
aid gave him the Miranda rights, and shortly thereafter a
confession is given by the man, by the suspect, I think the
very fact of the confession being given is some evidence of
a waiver.
Now, in Miranda, the Court said you can’t presume
waiver merely from a silent, from merely a silent record,

where a confession is given without a warning, but when it
follows the warning 1 think it's reasonable to conclude that
the confession is itself soma evidence of what

it may not

be conclusive, but it’s some evidence.
Whereas, when you have a tax^gible piece of property,
that property is not going to tell you whether or not consent
to search was given.
But the confession, the fact of the confession is
itself some evidence of waiver.
QUESTION; As I understood your brief, your argument
in part was that the very fact of a request by the officer
gave —• amounted to an inference, an indication that the
request could be denied.
MR. GRANUCC1;

Yes, that’s right,Mr. Chief Justice.

And the Ninth Circuit discounted that by saying
that verbal assent is not enough.

In argument, the implication

apparently relied on by the California Courts can hardly
suffice as a general rule.

Under many circumstances, a

reasonable person might read an officer’s "may I?" as a
courteous expression of a demand backed by force of law.
QUESTION; Did the Ninth Circuit comment on the fact
that Bustamonte helped with the.search, assisted the
officers?
MR. GRANUCCIs
QUESTION s

No, Mr. Chief Justice, —

In their opinion?

13
MR. GRANUCCI:

No# Mr» Chief Justice, they did not.

And I might correct Your Honor? it was not Bustamonte who was
assisting in the search, it was Mr. Alcala.
QUESTION:

Alcala? yes.

MR. GRANUCCIz

The one who had borrowed the car

from his brother for this expedition.
QUESTION z

I see.

He was the one that had a

driver’s license, was he?
MR. GRANUCCI:

He had the driver’s license.

Gonzales was sitting in the driver’s seat, driving the car.
Alcala was sitting in the middle.
license,

He had the driver’s

ted Mr. Bustamonte was on his right hand.
QUESTION'S

I think I got the two parties confused, 1

because I recall you have an argument that the conduct that
followed the request for consent and giving of consent verbally
demonstrated a consensual situation generally.
MR. GRANUCCIs
Sure, go right ahead.

Yes, and it did, because Alcala said,
They searched the car.

the officers search the car.

And they helped

And I can refer Your Honor

to page 51 of our Appendix.
j

QUESTION: The tiling that worries me is the officer
cornea up and says, “Would you let me see your driver’s
license?"
MR. GRANUCCI%
QUESTION:

Under California law, Your Honor, —

Ho, but if he says, "would you mind", don’t

14
you usually understand that he means "you either show it to me
or else"?

Isn’t that what you think?
MR, GRANUCCI s

Your Honor, I can go beyond that,

because under California law a driver is required to exhibit
his license whenever an officer requests it.
QUESTIONS That’s not my question.

But the nice,

polite police officer says, "would you mind doing it?”
MR. GRANUCCI :
QUESTION:

Yes.

That is —

That means "give it to me".

MR. GRANUCCI:

That is ~

QUESTION: That instant; that means "give it to me”.
MR. GRANUCCI:

That is, Your Honor, a polite

assertion of authority.
QUESTION:

Right.

Right.

Then he says, "Would you

mind letting me see your registration?"
MR. GRxAMUCCI s

Again a polite assertion of

authority.
QUESTION:
Than.

Than he says, "May I search your car?"

Now, what’s the difference?
MR. GRANUCCI:

No.

There may or may not be an

assertion of authority.
QUESTION:

Well, what’s the difference?

MR. GRANUCCI:

I think the difference is twofold.

It depends on -the circumstances of the case, and it also,
I think

I also think you have to take into account the

15
knowledge of California drivers»

You know, in our State,

before you can get a driver's license, you have to take a
rather comprehensive examination of the responsibility of
drivers»
QUESTION5

In most States.

MR. GRMUCCIs

Mostly, yes.

But there's nothing

in any of the California driver's handbooks that say you have
to consent to the search of an automobile, although they do
say that the driver has to identify himself and produce his
license when requested to do so,
QUESTION:

Is there any other difference you can

give for those three questions, other than that?
MR. GRANUCCI:

Well, I think that's the first

answer that comes to mind.

We do feel that the real issue is,

we don't preclude the possibility of unlawful assertion of
authority.

The real question is how you judge it.

Do you

focus on the affected party's state of mind as the Ninth
Circuit did, or can you take Justice Traynor's point of
view and look at all the circumstances of the case?
And we say it’s perfectly valid to take the
voluntariness approach.

We take the same approach in

California that this Court took in Bumper v. North Carolina.
There, based upon the circumstances of the case, the court
found there was an implied assertion of authority.
not

They did

the court did not focus on th© lady's subjective state

of mind.

They just «aid that under these circumstances they

have an implied assertion of authority*
QUESTION: Doss this record show in what words or in
what form the request to exhibit the driver’s license was
made?
MR. GRANUCCX:

It's in the Appendix.

It’s in the

Appendix, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

All right, you won’t have to stop for it.

MR. GEAHUCCX:

The Appendix contains the

a hearing

outside the presence of the jury, on the objection to these
three checks.
Now, we say that the California objective
voluntariness rule is constitutional, and when the Ninth
Circuit held it unconstitutional and imposed its federal

,

standard

it not only raised a question about the correctness

of that rule, but about the particular jurisprudence that
makes that kind of thing possible.
This leads us to our second argument.
QUESTION:

Excuse me.

Before you go on with that,

am I correct that, at page 30, the question is "Did you ask
the driver of the vehicle for a license?
"Yes. I did.
’’And was he able to produce the license?
61 No c!!
It doesn't show the precise words used, as it does

1?
with respect to the searching of the car.
MR. GRANUCCXj

1 must have misunderstood Your

Honor * s question.
QUESTION!

I was just looking to see whether the

two situations were comparable.

Apparently, on this record,

they’re not.
MR. GRANOCCIJ

On our second point, it’s agreed by

both proponents and critics of the exclusionary rule that
its primary purpose is to deter unreasonable police action.
Whether application of the exclusionary rule at the trial is
a hotly debated question.

But we insist most strongly that

whatever deterrent value the rule may have on trial and
on direct review, its deterrent effect is totally attenuated
by the time we get to collateral attack.
Basically, in our second argument, what we ask -the
Court to do is to tailor the impact on the State of the
exclusionary rule, to fit the purposes it was intended to
serve.
QUESTION;

Now, you’re talking about the exclusionary

rule as it was in Weeks v. United States or Canan against *—
People v. Caban, whatever the case wa3, when it was just a
rule.

The trouble is, sine© Mapp v. Ohio it’s been part of

the Fourth Arsvandment of the Constitution cf the United States.
Up until then it had been generally understood, at least by
me and I think by other people, that it's simply a rule of

18
evidence.
But Mapp told us we were wrong in that understanding,
MR. GRANUCCI:

Well», conceptually I think that the

Fourth Amendment of the Constitution itself contains no
explicit exclusionary rule,
QUESTION:

I know that, and you know that? but Majrg,

says that the exclusionary rule is part of the Fourth
Amendment as incorporated in the Fourteenth.»

it has to say

that, doesn't it, or we would have no power to decide Mapp
the way we decided it.
QUESTION:

Am I right in thinking that at least

part of your contention here is that even, though the
exclusionary rule is constitutionally derived, in a case
such as HSryis, decided a couple of years ago, there was a
limitation on its application in some aspects of the
production of testimony?
MR, GRANUCCI:

Exactly.

QUESTION: Are you suggesting that that limitation
be broadened to cover the writ of habeas corpus?
MR. GRANUCCI:

Exactly, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

One of the reasons that I think Kaufman •*** l respectfully
submit that Kaufman was wrong is because Kaufman didn't have
the advantage of the reasoning of this Court ih\Harris
Maw York,

y•_

But Miranda may be constitutionally compelled, too.
But the Court still held that in assessing th© use

of the evidence
QUESTION:

You don't really mean that!

ME. GRANUCCIs

Oh, I think I do.

I ask the Court

to take a balancing test, weigh deterrent value against real
substantial de'correct involved in the case on collateral
attack <>
It would take much more time than the rules of fchir.
Court allow to fully illustrate all of the disadvantages.
They're cited by the commentators.

They're cited in our

brief.
But one of the real disadvantages that 1 wasn't
aware of until it came up in this case was that it gives the
Federal Courts an opportunity to impose Federal standards on
the State in place of their equally valid State standards
for judging constitutional questions.
Now, I can conclude the prepared portion of my
argument in no batter way than referring this Court to the
late Associate Justice Harlan, who described collateral
attack on exclusionary rule grounds as imposing a burden on
the judiciary and on society at large, which results in no
legitimate benefit to the habeas petitioner and does nothing
to servo the interest of justice.
And 1 respectfully ask that the remainder of my time
bo kept for rebuttal*
QUESTIONs

Is it your submission that the Court

20
should retreat from Kaufman at least to the extent of the
Thor-fori, case in the District of Columbia Circuit,. or would
you have us go all the way and just say this is not open to
collateral attack, at least when it's been considered by the
State Courts?
MR. GRANUCCX

2

I would go all the way and say it's

not only Thorton —
QUESTION?

The Thorton case was discussed a good

deal in the Kaufman opinion. Judge Leventhal's opinion in
Thorton.
MR. GRANUCCIS

Yes, I think I recall that.

X would

go all the way and say it shouldn't be raised.
QUESTION:

Shouldn't be opened?

MR. GRANUCCI: Shouldn't be opened.
QUESTION:

No matter how unreasonable the search and

seizure was?
MR. GRhNUCCI:

That's the position l'sd have to take.

But to ameliorate that, I would point out to Your
Honor that the decisions of this Court in the early 19609s
almost guaranteed adequate State process for the vindication
of Federal claims, by providing each defendant with an
attorney, with a specific procedure for raising constitutional
questions*

I refer to the New York confessions case.

With

counsel on appeal, with a record on appeal.
Basically, opponents of our position have made some

21
very delicately phrased arguments, mainly to the effect
that you have to ultimately vindicate Federal rights in a
Federal tribunal.
But when they boil it down to the essentials, they
mean this and only one thing, that State Courts cannot be
trusted with Federal rights,

And that assumption is wrong,

QUESTION: Well, how broad is your argument.

From

what you just said, I suppose, it would militate against all
Federal habeas corpus jurisdictions,
MR, GRAHUCCI:

Ho.

It would.

Federal habeas

jurisdiction is also a very controversial thing.

But — and

a stronger case can perhaps be made for it, where the error
complained of goes to guilt or innocence? but the exclusionary
rule does not go to guilt or innocence.

Its purpose is

totally collateral to the criminal trial.
When a habeas petitioner, by exerting the
exclusionary rule, wins a reversal or a new trial, he gets
something that, has nothing to do with guilt or innocence, or
his rehabilitation, or any personal merit of his.

One would

think that, you know, you’d expect to find enormous
compensating benefits, in order to tolerate such a mis­
carriage of justice.

Because that’s what it is, vrhen a man

gets but on *— it has nothing to do with 'guilt or innocence,
I'll save fie rest of my time for, rebuttal*
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Granucci.

Mr. Tobisman.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STUART p. TOBISMAN, ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. TOBISMAN;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

tlie Courts
The two issues presented in this case ares

first,

can a consent search b® valid in the absence of a showing of
any knowledge of the Fourth Amendment right being relin­
quished; the second issue is, can State

prisoners continue

to use Federal habeas corpus to waive their Fourth Amendment
claims.
With respect to the consent search issue,
it seems to ms that there are two questions to be answered.
The first question is s

What are the elements of a

waiver of fundamental constitutional rights?
As recently as last June, in Barker vs.Wingo, this
Court defined a wavier of constitutional rights as an
intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right
or privilege and courts are to indulge every reasonable
presumption against the existence of such a surrender.
QUESTION; Doesn't that suggest a totality of
circumstances concept?
MR. TOBISMAN;
so.

Mr. Chief Justice, I don’t believe

X -think that the essential elements are, first, the

voluntariness, the fact that it is in effect an intentional

23
act; and, second, that the right be known.
I would submit that I don't frankly understand how a
man can fee found to have surrendered a right unless he knows
it exists.

X mean, what has he done?
It seems to me that to surrender the right means that

he was aware of its existence, and decided, for any of: a
number of reasons, to give it up.
I believe that the central question is really one
that you've allude,& to, sir, namely, should a consent search
'v

be deemed the equivalent of a waiver of Fourth Amendment
tights, so that all waiver elements, including knowledge,
must be demonstrated to validate the search.
Contrary to the State’s position, good faith on the
part of the polios is not an acceptable criteria for
determining whether a search is valid under the Fourth
Amendment.

Rather, the criteria under the Fourth Amendment is

on© of reasonableness, and this concept of reasonableness is
embedded in history and context of the evils the Fourth
Amendment was intended to prevent.
The primary aim of the Fourth Amendment is to protect
each individual's privacy from arbitrary governmental intrusion.
Xt is a focus on the right of the victim, not on the good
faith, subjective state of mind, I may say, of the police
officer conducting the search.
This Court has repeatedly reiterated that the

24
Fourth amendment is among the moat firaekui^ntal of our
constitutional safeguards, and, over the years, many cases
have come before this Court, which have resulted in the
establishment of safeguards and very, very elaborate procedures
to validate a search.
I would call the Court's attention to its recent
statement in Coolid-ge vs* How Hampshire, that warrantless
searches are deemed per se unreasonable under the Fourth
Amendment, subject to a few very limited, well defined
exceptions.
I would further submit -—
QUESTION:

Of course, one of the exceptions

explicitly enumerated in Coolidge —
MR. TOBISMAN:
QUESTION:

Pardon me, sir?

One of the exceptions explicitly

enumerated in Coolidge, as well as in Katz and other cases,
if you*want to call it an exception, was that the search,
when there is consent to the search, doesn't present a’Fourth
Amendment problera.
MR. TOBISMAN:

Well, I perfectly agree that consent

searches-are permissible under the Constitution.

My point

would be that consent searches purport to make all of these
other safeguards irrelevant *
QUESTIONs

Yes.

MR. TOBISMANs

As a matter of fact, let's look at

25
this case.

If the search is valid in this particular case#

that means that the search is constitutionally permissible,
even though there is no warrant# no probable cause# no one
has been questioned about any specific crime# no one is under
arrest.

There is no threat or danger to the police from the

searched premises.

There is no testimony in the record from

Mr. Alcala# the individual who allegedly consented to this
search.

And# last# there is not even the remotest effort

made to determine if he had any notion at all of his right
to resist -idle search.
This record discloses one fact about Mr. Alcala.
He was approximately twenty years old.

That9s all.

QUESTION: Well# how much would you require?
MR. TGBISMAN:

Well# 1 would say that I would

require that there be a showing that he did in fact understand
his right to request that the police obtain a search warrant.
QUESTION:

You wouldn’t require that there be

probable cause, would you?
MR. TGBXSMANe

No# not at all# sir.

I concade

that he could in fact waive his right to the production of a
warrant.
My point is# in this particular case# if this
search is constitutionally permissible# it's permissible
without regard to any of the traditional safeguards that this
Court has developed.

QUESTION:

Would it satisfy your standard* counsel,

if the policeman had said* in addition to what he did say*
15You are not required by law to consent* you may refuse your
consent if you wish? but if you refuse* we will be obliged
to detain you here until we can get a search warrant"?
Would that satisfy your standard?
MR, TOBISMAN: Well* I think one question underlying
that is whether* in fact* the -police could detain them under
those circumstances.
It seems to me that if there were sufficient

counsel* I'm just suggesting if the policeman had made that
statement* in those words* and then sometime later someone
would have to decide whether he lawfully could have given
the implication of the threat to hold them until he got
the search warrant.

But i£ he gave that warning, would that

be adequate?

I believe that such a warning would

that in my mind that appears to me to constitute possibly

I think that it is, and I think that,

on that basis# a search could he approved, so long as the
justification for the detention is appropriate at that time.
QUESTION;

If he placed the man under arrestr could

he search the entire car then and there?
me.

TOBISMAN:

I believe that under the Court's

recent decisions dealing with searches incidental to arrest,
a search of the entire automobile at. that time might not be
constitutionally justified.
My point here is that no one was under arrest.
The Appendix clearly states, at page 40, when the officer was
asked, no one was under arrest, ho had not asked any
questions at all about & specific crime.

hs a matter of fact, it’s doubtful that he was
aware of the existence of the particular crime at the time
the search was undertaken.
QUESTIONi

Could he have been arrested for operating

a motor vehicle without a license?
MR. TOBISMAN:

Under California law, I frankly

don't know the answer to that.

But assuming he could, I

think that there would be — I would doubt that there would be
a sufficient basis, as a result of that particular arrest, to
search the entire automobile.
X!d like to point out, if I may, sir, that at that
time all of the individuals were out of the ‘car, there was

28
no one in the car , there was no threat or danger to the
policemen at that moment*

The sole justification was Mr.

Alcala's alleged invitation to the police;

come in, search

my car.
QUESTION:

Mr. Tobisman, as a practical matter,

with the consent standard that you're seeking to have upheld
hero, does that mean that the police would have to give
warnings much as they do in the Miranda situation now?
MR. TOEISM&N:

Well, 1 would sav that the decision

affirming the Ninth Circuit's disposition in this case would
not necessarily require that affirment of admonition is to be
given in all Fourth Amendment cases.

It's true that such
t

admonitions are required in the contest of Fifth and Sixth
iUaendmenfcs, but 1 would respectfully call the Court’s
attention to the lowor court decision cited in my brief,
which give examples of courts considering this particular
question without regard to — in instances where there were'
not affirmative warnings given.
I’d like to go on, if 7 may, because I think, in all
condor, I should admit that were I a police administrator,
under the existing state of the law, I would instruct my
officers to make it clear to the individual that the sole
justification for a search of the house or automobile, as it
may be, i© their consent.
And 2 would not want to lose convictions because my

29
officers failed to apprise the individual of his rights, and
put toe to obtaining a search warrant.
However? 1 think that one of the problems is that
there are many cases that appear to turn on minor technicality
peoplee 1 notice a lot of hostility to cases dealing possibly
with some of the elements of search warrants and things of
that sort? or hostility in terns that —- pardon me? hostile
reactions in terms of decisions dealing with the content of a
warrant.
I don't think that this is a case that deals only
with the minor technicality.

This case? I really believe?

goes to the fundamental question of:
Fourth Amendment protection?

Who is entitled to

Is it only the man who is

sophisticated and educated and knows of his rights? and who
will not consent? or la it all of the citisens? including the
poor person? the uneducated person? the person who fears the
police?
If they are all to be entitled to the Fourth
Amendment’s protections? I don't see how they can be deemed
to have given up that right? unless there is some showing in
the record that they were aware of it at the time they allegedly
surrendered it.
QUESTION?

Was there a hearing here on the question?

MR. TOBXSMAN:

My understanding is that the question

was raised at trial? and that testimony was taken in chambers.

y

The officer involved gave his testimony, and I believe that
there was other testimony given by Joe Gonzales, the man who
was driving the axstomobile.
QUESTION?

And they *—

The defendant didn’t testify there?

MR. TOBXSMAN:

No, the defendant did not testify.

And Mr. — as I mentioned before, Mr. Alcala did not testify,
QUESTION:

X suppose it would be enough to satisfy

your rule if it were clearly shown -that the defendant knew
what his rights wore, even though he wasn’t informed?
Even though someone hadn’t — even though the officer hadn’t
given him some warning?
MR. TOBISMANs Well, if I may backtrack a little bit.
The actual consent was given by Mr. Alcala.

I would be

quite satisfied with the result if there were a showing that
he was aware of his right at the time it was relinquished.
QUESTION: Well, did the driver say he didn’t know
vfrat his rights were?
MR. TOBISMAN:

No, the actual!

the consent was Joe Alcala.

-- the man that gave

He apparently had borrowed the

car from hi3 brother.
QUESTION:

Well, he testified, didn’t he?

MR. TOBISMAN:

He did not testify.

man who did give the consent.

But he was the

All of the evidence involved

with the actual conversation is based upon the testimony
of the police officer on the one hand, and the testimony of

33.

Joe Gonsales on the other hand.
QUESTION?

Well, was there testimony anywhere at

the hearing that the defendant put on any testimony for the
defendant„ saying that the fellow who gave the consent did
not know what his rights were?
MR. TOBISMAM;

There was — at the time the motion

vas made, there was some suggestion by counsel for the
defendant that the search was not properly authorised, that
Mr, Alcala was not aware of his rights, and that it was
conducted in a — the search was conducted in a coercive
atmosphere.
QUESTION;

Does California have an expression

hearing?
MR. TOBISMAN;

I'm afraid I can’t answer that, sir,

t don't know.
QUESTION;

Alcala, then, didn't take the stand to

enlighten anybody about the state of his knowledge about his
rights?
MR. TOBISMAN:
QUESTION;

Alcala never testified at all.

Nor was he called by the defendant?

MR. TOBISMAN:

He was not called by the defendant.

My understanding, and I've tried to communicate
with the attorney who handled the case at trial, is that he
could not be located.

They made an effort, but could not

locate him at the time of the trial.

32
QUESTION:

You would say, then, on this record,

then, you also would have to go on and say that California
has th© burden?
MR. TOBISMAN:

Oh, yes.

Oh, clearly.

Clearly.

I think that the elements —
QUEDSTION:

You think that's constitutionally

required?
MR. TOBISMAN:

Yes, I do.

I believe that in order

to make any of the other safeguards meaningful and worthwhile
a right should not be surrendered unless there's some showing
that the individual knew it existed.
QUESTION:

Incidentally, were any of the other five

convicted of anything?
MR, TOBISMAN:

Not to my knowledge.

The only ~~

there were citations issued, traffic citations issued to the
driver.

So far as I know, Mr. Alcala was never convicted of

anything.

Mr. Gonzales, who provided the main testimony in

connection with the search, other than that provided by the
officer, was never convicted.
I believe that, as I mentioned, the effect of the
consent was to make all of the traditional Fourth Amendment
safeguards, including the emphasis on search warrants
irrelevant.
QUESTION:

Mr. Tobisman, could we just go back?

MR. TOBISMAN:

Yes, sir.

33

QUESTION% Do I understand your position to be that
if Mr. Alcala knew that he did not have to, that would he
sufficient, whether or not Bustamonte did?
MR, TOBISMAN2

Yes, that's my position.

QUESTIONs And how about the other side?

If

Bust arson te knew that it was not necessary to consent, even
though Alaala didn't, then what would your position be?
MR. TOBISMANs
a difficult one*

That question, I think, is obviously

I would say that Mr. Bustamonte was riding

in the car, presumably as the guest of — pardon ms, Mr.
Bustamonte was the guest of Mr. Alcala.
I think that Mr. Alcala's control over the premises
could be deemed satisfactory so that if he consented to the
search, the search would be valid.
One thing I would point out —
QUESTION*

Would that be the extent, then, of

California's burden on consent?
MR. TOBISMANs
QUESTION?

Yes.

Yes,

In my case —

Bustamonte*s trial would have to show

that Alcala knew he didn't have to consent?
MR. TOBISMAN: That’s right.

I believe that otherwise

it would require that all six people be questioned, and I
think again, viewing this —QUESTIONs

But you'ro not sure that it would be

sufficient if California proved at Bustamonte*s trial that

34
Bustamonte knew that he didn't have to consent to that?
MR. TOBISMAN:

No.

1 believe that the authorisation

for this search resulted from Mr. Alcala's alleged consent.
That was
QUESTION:

So California could satisfy its burden

only by proving Alcala knew he didn't have to?
MR. TOBISMAN:
QUESTION:

That would be my position.

You would say that the Constitution would

not permit a rule on California to the effect the defendant
must first put on some testimony that Alcala didn't know?
MR, TOBISMAN:

No, I believe that the justification

for the search, the constitutional basis for the search must

he presented by the State.

The State is required to establish

the basis for the search, and I think that what it must do is
demonstrate the elements of a waiver of the Fourth Amendment
right.
QUESTION:

You don't think California makes a prima

facie case of consent by showing that he said, as he did here,
"Go right ahead; just go right ahead"?
MR. TOBISMAN:

No, I don't.

I think the same

question could be asked in a case where, for example, the
police officer says, “Can I see your driver's license?"
you answer "Sure".

And

I don't think that the fact that you say

"sure" in any way indicates whether you've made a judgment
based on your knowledge of the alternatives available to you

35
at that time.
QUESTION;

You don51 think that's,reinforced any by

the fact that the speaker who said these words then proceeded
to help the officer with the search?
MR. TOBISMANs

Well, I believe that the assistance

rendered by Mr. Alcala is partially overstated,

after all,

■She police officer asked, according to Mr. Gonzales, I believe
it's around page 52, he asked, "Does the trunk open?"

And

Mr. Gonzales said that Mr. Alcala said, "Yes, it does", and
walked over and opened it.
There's another statement where he says, "How about
opening the trunk?"

I mean these are the statements of

Gonzales, not the man who opened the trunk, not the man who
consented to the search.

The statement of Gonzales, the man

who was driving the car.

The man, at that point, was 17 or

18 years old, and is talking about a conversation that he
overheard.
I dont? think that that in any way indicates
Alcala's state of mind at that particular point.
I'd also like to mention that the record is quite
clear that Alcala was well aware that the cheeks were in the
car, either on the possession of someone in the car or in
the car? and it just see-s to me if he was aware of his rights,
it's curious that he would so readily authorize the police to
search that car, when they would not have any other basis to

38

do so,
QUESTIONi

Mr. Tobisman, incidentally„ was any

attempt to corns hare by certiorari from the appeal after the
conviction in the State Court?
MR, TOBXSMMs

Ho. sir# there was not.

Not that I’m

a/are of.
What happened is Mr. Bustamonte, on his own# after
&e California Supreme Court denied the petition for hearing,,
filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the District
Court.

He did this without the assistance of counsel# and

I was not called upon to assist him until after the ruling of
fee District Court in the matter.
Again I think that -QUESTION:

Do you think that that’s significant at

all?
MR. TOBXSMAM:

Ho# X don’t# sir.

1 think that

although I’d like to reserve some discussion of that point
on the second part of the argument, X think that this Court in
Fay vs. Hoia held that certiorari is not the equivalent of a
normal appellate channel, and it is not necessary that a
petition for a writ of certiorari be filed as a precondition
to seeking federal habeas corpus.
1 think that the —-

QUESTION: Actually FaY_v. Hoia overruled Darjv»_
Burford

37
HR. TOBISM&N;

That’s right, overruled Par vs.

Burford, which had, as I understand it, required that such a
petition be filed prior to seeking habeas corpus.
Again, I don't believe that that has a real direct
bearing on this particular case.
I would like to emphasise, once again, what 1 think
to be the most important aspect to this case.

That is that

I'm not seeking to impose what X feel to be an undue burden
on law enforcement officers.

After all, consent searches

do not involve probable cause, they do not involve emergencies,
they do not involve dangers to the police.

The sole

justification for the search is the suspect's invitation.
Therefore, 1 submit that the Court should make the
effort to determine whether a knowledgeable surrender of
constitutional rights was present at the time such consent
is given.
'Furthermore, it is my 'understanding that federal
agencies, such as the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs,
and the

do obtain written consents before conducting

a search, and 2 have seen one of the forms that is used by
thp Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, and it does
contain a statement to apprise the suspect of his rights
under the Fourth Amendment.
Again, 1 don't believe that this is an undue burden
on the one hand for the police? on the other hand, I think that

to reject the waiver test would be to in effect substantially
dilute the effectiveness of the Fourth Amendment, and actually
remove it actually from the protection of many citizens of
this country, who simply are not aware of their constitutional
rights.
QUESTIONs

Mr. TobismanP it’s ray understanding that

your opponent takes the position that the giving of warning
for a Fourth Amendment situation would be much, much more
complicated, sine© the right protected is the right to be free
from unreasonable search and seizure, rather than just an
absolute right to counsel.

Do you have any comment on what

I understand to be his point?
MR. TOBISMM’Js

Yes, I do,

I think that we have to

look at this in terms of what ara the police most likely to
do.
If file police have a probable cause to seek & warrant,
I think that this Court's decisions indicate that they should
take -that tack.

That's the preferred way to do it.

At a time

when they’re seeking consent, if it is, in fact, a search
that can only be justified by consent, there is no other
basis.

There is no other basis for the search under the

Fourth Amendment.
I don’t believe that it creates a difficulty for
thorn if they are seeking consent, because they have no other
basis for the search to make it, to find out for themselves or

39
to somehow be able to demonstrate the individual's awareness
of liis rights at the time they conduct the search.
QUESTION s

But a judgment as to whether probable

cause exists or whether the circumstances are exigent is
necessarily not a very firm one and in many doubtful cases I
actually think a police officer might be approaching with the
thought, ”X think I'vo got probable cause, but I'm going to
see if I can gat consent«"
MR, TOBXSMM:

Well, I think ha may in fact do that

on many occasions, and frankly that concerns me, because ‘that

mans that whereas the police officer could not conduct that
search against me, for example, or maybe against other people
who ar© awar© of their rights, he would ba able, as a matter
of law, to conduct that search against many citizens in this
country who are not aware of their rights.
1 do recognise the fact that there are ambiguities
and difficulties that the police officer must face up to,
but 1 believe that unless the waiver test is applied with
respect to the Fourth Amendment, the result would be that, as
a matter of lav;, the police can conduct searches against
vast segmsnte of the society that, as a matter of law, they
cannot otherwise Conduct.
And they could not conduct, for example, against
people who are aware of their Fourth Amendment rights*
QUESTION: The essence of your case is that the

40
California test is not a fair test of reasonableness»
MR. TOBISMANI

That's correct*

My position is that

Ker vs, California, although it did not establish supervisory
authority over the State courts, U. S. Supreme Court
supervisory over the State courts, it did clearly indicate
that certain basic, fundamental criteria must be met in the
application of the Fourth Amendment»
1 think that this is one of the most basic elements ,
one of -the most basic aspects of the Fourth Amendment that I
could possibly conceive of, is the right to be available to
all citizens, no matter if they're uneducated, educated,
sophisticated or unsophisticated, or is it not?
I think that that’s the essential question and it's
fundamental — it reaches the level of a Key vs» California
fundamental criteria in my opinion»
QUESTION*

I thought you were attacking the

California rule as to what is consent, as consent vel non,
not reasonableness vel non, aren't you?
MR. TOBISMAN$

Well, 1 think that — I can’t

conceive, in my own mind, how you can have consent to
something unless you know it exists.

2 don't understand how

you can surrender something unless you know it e&isfcs.
QUESTION»

So you are attacking the California

test of consent —
MR, TOBISMANs

That's right.

Pardon me, I'm sorry.

QUESTIONS

not the reasonableness,

MR. TOBISMAN:

Pardon me, I misunderstood the

interpretation of what is consent, they do not comply with
the requirements of Ker vs. California.
In truth, ~
QUESTIONS

Mr. Tobisraan, —

MR. TOBISMMTs
QUESTION s

Yes, sir.

— then you feel that Key v. California

cuts down in your favor or against you?
MR. TOBISMANs

I believe that Ker vs. California

would ba in my favor, i£ only because it requires that
certain fundamental safeguards are

certain fundamental

criteria are met in viewing the elements of a constitutional
right.

The State has —
QUESTION:

That’s the difference that Mr. Justice

'Clarke,as I read it, tried to draw between Federal and State
review.
MR. TOBXSMAN:

Offhand I can't remember the passage

that you're referring to.

But, again, I cite Ker for the

proposition that certain minimal criteria must be met by the
State.

They can go beyond it, but they can't fall below it.
QUESTION: Suppose they stop a ear and say, "What

have you got in there?

Have you got any contraband in your

car?”

And the owner of the ear say3, "Go ahead and look.55

How about that one?
MR. TOBISMANs

Well, I would be -afraid that that

represents some sort of coercion,, just a suggestion to the
individual that "we know you’ve got it" or "do you have it"?
that ’would concern roe.
QUESTION:

That’s not what 1 said.

QUESTION:

MR. TOBISMANj
QUESTION:
consent.

Well, I think that if —

Of course that's not a question of

That's a question of invitation.
MR. TOBISMAN:

Well, I think that if I'm inviting,

if I’m inviting an officer, for example, to search my car*,
if it’s a true invitation, it can only be based on my
understanding of my right to say "It’s none of your business
"If you've got a basis to search my car, go ahead."

But I

don’t have to let you.
I think that that’s really the underlying question
in this case.

And I think that to really be an invitation

43
means that I know I can say no*
If I don *t know I can say no f I’m being forced to
do it.
QUESTIONi

So if it gets to that point, the police

cfficer can say, ”You don’t have to let me look."

At that

stage, that’s what you’d require?
MR. TOBISMAN: Well, I’m saying that either at that
stage or at trial some evidence would have to be adduced to
demonstrate that the individual knew he could say no.
QUESTIONt And that’s the burden on the State?
MR. TOBISMAN:

Yes, I believe it is.

If I may, I’d like to turn to the second issue,
which is;

should State prisoners continue to have access to

Federal habeas corpus to raise Fourth Amendment claims?
The State requests the Court to turn its back on
the extensive, historical development of habeas corpus as a
remedy to vindicate fundamental constitutional protection.
In 1969, in Kaufman vs. United Statas, this Court
held that Federal, prisoners can use Federal habeas corpus
to raise Fourth Amendment claims, even though such claims
have been previously considered in a Federal court.
State prisoners hav© an even greater need for
Federal habeas corpus, since ifc will probably be their first
opportunity to raise a Federal constitutional claim in a
Federal court.

44
Since 1916, certiorari has been the only direct
appellate access to Federal courts which is available to Stats
prisoners under normal — under most criminal convictions.
Again, in 1963, in Fay vs. ffoia, this Court indicated that
since certiorari is by no means the. equivalent of a normal,
direct appellate channel, there is no need to file a petition
for a writ of certiorari as a precondition to seeking Federal
habeas corpus.
Today, with the increased workload of this Court,
certiorari is even less of an effective direct appellate
channel than it was when Fay va« Iloia was decided back in
1963.
Thus it seems to me to be quito clear that the
State's real goal is to deprive State prisoners of any
meaningful access to Federal courts in connection with their
Fourth Amendment rights.
The Court indicated its firm refusal to do this in
Kaufman,

and I respectfully urge the Court to continue to

reject the State's position in this case.
Federal habeas corpus is the main, opportunity for
‘

*5

-

careful, consistent Federal court review of State court
decisions regarding the Fourth Amendment.
The fifty State Supreme Courts can develop, and
have developed in the past, inconsistent or erroneous rules
regarding fundamental constitutional protections.

Federal

habeas corpus provides an efficient, effective remedy to
correct those errors.

It guarantees the fair and equal

treatment for all citizens, wherever tried? with respect to
their fundamental constitutional protections? including
•those of the Fourth Amendment.
Clearly, then, Federal habeas corpus is the principal
remedy available to implement the rule of Key vs, California,
as X previously stated my understanding of that rule.
Moreover, and although X will admit that this
possibly goes beyond the narrow scope of this issue, I believe
that Federal habeas corpus decisions have the sams general
deterrent effect on progressive law enforcement departments
as decisions at pretrial, at trial, or on direct appeal.
It seems to rae it's one thing for a police officer
who conducted the particular search, or the particular
seizure, to so® that he lost the case as a result of his
conduct? possibly that will affect his conduct, possibly
it will not.
X think the more important aspect of this is the
general deterrent value of all court decisions dealing with
the Fourth Amendment.
QUESTION: Well, what do you think about your
argument that's in the context of the State court having
already approved the search?
MR. TOBXSMM:

And found it reasonable*

X think that. —

46
QUESTION* Then what’s the deterrent offset of a
later Federal habeas corpus?
MR. TOBISMAN;

I think that, in effect, the Court

is saying that the standard of reasonableness, a standard
based on vindicating the individual's right to be free from
unreasonable governmental intrusions, that standard of
reasonableness prescribes certain rules, certain conduct
that the police must comply with.
QUESTION:

Well, I understand that it would have to

do that, but I'm talking about deterrents, not about whether
it would help the defendant have his conviction set aside.
Of course it would.

But what about deterrents?

MR, TOBISMAN: With respect to deterrents, if this
Court, in this case, affirms the decision of the Ninth
Circuit, I am confident that all around the country police
officers will recognize that in order to sustain a conviction
it is going to bo necessary to demonstrate knowledge on the
part of the individual who —
QUESTION: That really isn't my question.

Let's

assume a law enforcement officer, who is — just like these
lav/ enforcement officers, -there's a set of regulations issued
that says you need only to be worried about consent, you need
not worry about waiver standards or Miranda warnings in
getting consent in searches.

That's the rule.

.And the. State court approves it. And you think that

adds really to — for those officers, for the officers
involved in this case, it would be much of a deterrent, if
later, in Federal habeas, the search is set aside?
MR. TOBISMANs
fact is that

X think absolutely.

X think that th

what we1 re really talking about is conforming

conduct to a set of criteria, to a set of standards.
If this Court holds that a conviction cannot be sustained on
the basis of

I agree with you for the future.

MR. TGBISMANs

Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

My statement is

intended as a statement of deterring the improper conduct
in the future.

I don’t —* I think that that’s the essential

element of this case.
QUESTION;

All right.

MR. TGBISMAN;

Pardon ms, I misunderstood the

question.
QUESTION; Suppose, Mr. Tobisman —* 1*11 try to
restate ray thought on Mr. Justice Vihite’s question —
suppose we hadn't granted certiorari in this case, and you
have a judgment from the Supreme Court of California that
says this search is perfectly valid, you got a judgment in
/the Ninth Circuit that says it’s not valid, and this Court
hasn't passed on it.

X take it that’s a typical habeas

situation, where your lower Federal courts are in conflict
with your State courts.

How, where does the police officer look for guidance
in that situation?
HE» TOBISMM:

I.

think the ultimate result in that

context would be that the conviction would be overturned,
presumably, if in feet we had all of the other elements.
QUESTIONS

Certainly, but we8re not talking about

the conviction*
MR. TOBISMANs

Ho, no, I*m sorry.

QUESTION? But where the police officer looks for
guidance.
MR. TGBISM&N:

I believe that the police officer

would ultimately look for guidance to the court that is at
the end of the lino, that’s going to, in effect, say whether
this conviction can stand or not*
QUESTION*

The Federal court?

MR. TOBXSMANs
QUESTIONS

That’s right.

Your whole position assumes that, as &

practical matter —* .I’m not suggesting it isn't correct? but
I suggest your whole position assumes that if the police
officer had pursued the proposition after ho said, "Yes, go
ahead, help yo'arsolf'*, and then the police officer said,
"It's ray duty to inform you that you don't have to consent*
Now, do you still consent?0
As a practical matter, do you think the man is
going to withdraw his consent?

to do that, but I frankly would be satisfied, assuming there
is a showing that it was in fact a voluntary act, and freely
he decided to say, “No, you can’t search the car3.
QUESTION:

Is it any more voluntary?

MR. TOBISMAN: Well, you know, X think that we're
talking again about the other side of the issue, which is:
can you voluntarily give up something you don't know about?
That's one side.

The other side is:

are you really

voluntarily saying yes, when -the policeman says, "I want to
search your car.J‘
I assume that you can in fact make a voluntary
decision to let the police search your home,let the police
search your car.

I assume that that can in fact be done.

But my position is that it can only be done if
you are aware of your right to say no.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGES:

Thank you, Mr. Tobisman*

your time is up.
Mr. Granucci, you have four minutes remaining.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT R. GRANUCCI, ESQ.

,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR* GRANUCCIs

Thank you, Tour Honor.

I commence by noting that Mr. Justice Rehxiquist * s
last question is not a hypothetical one.

It describes a real

and very disturbing situation in the Ninth Circuit, where
that court, in some of the cases cited in our brief, has
applied its own waiver standard in cases brought by State
prisoners.
Whereas the highest court of the State of
California has declared that consent to search is to be judged
by a voluntariness standard.
Now, let mo step back and clarify one thing, if 1
haven’t done so.
We do not say that simple consent to search is
sufficient.

California courts are concerned about the

possibility of an implied assertion of authority*

They are

vary concerned about it.
The question is, how do we judge.

How do we *—

what means do we invoke to judge the question of implied
assertion of authority?

California uses objective circum-

stances, and it’® a constitutional rule*
Now, counsel observed that Alcala wouldn’t have
consented to this search if he thought ha could refuse*
Well, I would suggest to the Court that there ar® some good

51
reasons why Alcala might want to consent, even if he knew
the checks were in the car.

He could very well feel,"well,

they stopped us and they’ve got us.

And if they find the

checks, they won’t find them on me, and X can always say
later on 1 didn't know they were in the car.”
And the consent, "the fact that 1 consanted would
he some indication that I didn't know."

Nov, “*“*
QUESTIONS So you're saying that on the evidence
in this record there was a prima facie case for consent?
MR. GRANUCC1s
QUESTION?

Yes.

tod that the California rule was it

depends on the facts?
MR. GRANUCCXs

That's right.

QUESTIONS And as long as the officer asks, and ho
consents, then at least the burden of going forward with
the evidence shifts?
MR. GRANUCCIj

I think that’s right, Your Honor*

Although X would say this, that if you had drawn guns or
something like that, that’s —
QUESTIONS Well, obviously.
\

MR, GRANUCCZ't

You see, in other words, we look

for
QUESTION* But that isn't in this case?
MR. GRANUCCIs

.No, sir, it isn't*

52
Verbal expression of permission to

search*

Then

you look for no implied assertion of authority# and of
course no overt coercion.
QUESTION:

So yon would say that if Alcala had

been called to the stand and he had testified he did not
know that he could have refused# or he testified that he
thought he had to consent# this might be a different case then?
MR. GRMUeei:

It might be a different case.

This would be another of the factors that we would throw
into the equation of measuring voluntariness.

Knowledge of

one's rights is a relevant fact# but it's not a determinant
fact.
QUESTION:

Once again# can you tell me why they

asked to search the car?
MR. GRANUCCI: Well# it's in the record# Mr. Justice
Marshall.

The officer# on his instinct# thought# "Well,

here we are# it * s 2:45 in the morning# we have three young
men in the front seat# three older men in the back seat#
nobody has got any identification except Alcala# and they've
all given inconsistent stories about who picked who up, and
where they were going."
Some instinct told him that things were exactly
all right# although he couldn't pin it down to a specific
crime.

So he asked permission to search.
He pretty well articulated his mental thinking.

It

33

was a policeman’s hunch.
We don’t s&y that it would have justified the search
of the car without consent, but it certainly made it reasonable
for the officer to ask Mr. Alcala for permission.
Now, — Is11 respectfully submit the matter.

My

time is up, Your Honor.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
at the Court’s requf

nd

Mr. Tobisman, you served
