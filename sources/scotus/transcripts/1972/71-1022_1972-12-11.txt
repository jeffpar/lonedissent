P R 0 C E' E D I N G S
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first this morning in No. 71-1022, United S
Basye.
Mr,, Solicitor General,, you

may

proceed whenever

you are ready»
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERWIN N. GRISWOLD, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GRISWOLD:

May it please the Court:

This is a federal income tax case.

It is here on

the Government's petition to review a decision of the United
States Court of Appeals fen: the Ninth Circuit.

The case

arises out of one of the interesting developments in modern
society.

In California there is a substantial system of

both group medical insurance and group medical practice..

In

this particular case the medical insurance is provided by the
Kaiser Foundation Health Plan,, Inc.

And the medical services

are provided by a partnership known as Permanente Medical
Group.
The individual taxpayers before the Court are members
of this partnershipf or their spouses in cases where joint
returns were filed.

The years involved are 1960 and 1961,

except in one case where 1962 and 1963 are also involved.
The case was heard in the district court on a
stipulation of facts.

The basic stipulation appears at pages

4
79 to 88 of the Append ix, and attached to the stipulation
are the full texts of t h re e s u h s t a i11 i a 1 do c um e xrt s a 11 a ohe d
to and a part of the s tipulation.

And the case turns largely

on the effect of those documents and payments made pursuant
to them under the federal tax laws.

The first of these

documents i.s the partnership agreement of the Permanente
Medical Group , usually referred to in this case simply as
Medical Group.

This partnership agreement appears on pages

.102 through 113 of the Appendix.
The next document, appearing at pages 116 through
150 of the Appendix, is the medical service agreement, being
a contract entered into as of July 1, 1959 by the Kaiser
Foundation Health Plan, which is obligated to produce
services under its contract with its members, and the Medical
Group which thereby undertook the obligation to provide the
services.
Under this contract Medical Group agreed to supply
health services to the members of the Health Plan and the
Health Plan agreed to make payments to Medical Group.

The

question at issue in this case relates to a portion of the
payments, and I will spell this out in detail in just a
moment.
Finally there is in the

Appendix at pages 159

through 139 a trust agreement establishing the retirement
plan for the Permanente Medical Group.

That is the way it

is entitled at the beginning. Trust Agreement Retirement
page 159.

This is

a typical non-vested retirement plan providing for benefits
for physicians only and. only to the physicians who persist
in their connection with Medical Group or related groups for
periods stated in the trust.
Q

There are no non~-ro.ed.ical employees then that

are beneficiaries?
MR. GRISWOLD;
in this retirement plan.

There are no non-medical employees
Non-medical employees were taken

care of in some way otherwise; how does not appear in the
Appendix»
Q

Did the plan cover physicians

members of the partnership but. who were staff employees?
MR. GRISWOLD:
Q

Did the plan—

Cover physicians, doctors, who were not in the

partnership but who were employed by them?
MR. GRISWOLD:

Yes, the plan covers physicians who

are employees of Permanente Medical Group as well a.s
physicians who are partners in Permanente Medical Group.
The payments involved in this case ware made by
Health Plan to the Trust, pursuant to the agreement between
Health Plan and the partnership Medical Group.

Let us now

turn more specifically to the agreement.
I would like to call the Court's attention to page

6
122 of the Appendix, which is in the agreement between
Health Plan and Medical Group.
recites this.

Section. B-3 of the agreement

This is near the top of page 122.

“Health Flan desires to arrange by contract for
all Medical Services in the service area required to satisfy,
or convenient or incidental in connection with satisfying,
the Medical Service obligations provided in Membership
Contracts.

Medical Group agrees to provide such Medical

Services for the consideration and subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement."
Thus, all of the payments provided by the agreement
are expressly stated to be in consideration of the services
rendered by Medical Group.
124 of the Appendix.
last two lines

Similarly at the bottom of page

If is agreed that, and I quote the

on 124, "Within the Service Area, Medical

Group shall provide to all Members all Medical Services
required by or incident to Membership Contracts."
And then at the top of page 126 appears Section
C-3 of the contract under the heading “Compensation for
Medical Services."

And the first sentence of C-3 reads,

"As full consideration for rendering Medical Services as
required by Sections C-l and C-2, Medical Group shall receive
the compensation provided in Part III hereof."

And this leads

us to Part III of the contract, Article H, beginning on page
137 of the Appendix and continuing for the next several pages.

It is there provided in the introduction to Article H, "As
base compensation to Medical Group for Medical Services to
be provided by Medical Group hereunder, Health Plan shall pay
to Medical Group the amounts specified in this Article H."
And then H-l provides for the per member price and
provides for a payment based on the number of members, the
initial per member price for July, 1959 and each succeeding
month—it appears near the bottom of page 137—was $2,61329
per member per month.

But continuing with Article H, it

appears that this base compensation consists of several items.
Incidentally, I may say that at the time the contract was
entered, into there were 350,000 members.

That meant

coverage of some 900,000 persons, because members were
families,

I understand that something close to three

million persons are now covered by the general plan.
But there are further provisions for adjustment to
the per member price in Sections II-2 and H-3 on pages 138
and the top of page 139,

And then we come to the paragraph

which gives rise to this case.

This is paragraph H--4 on

page 139 of the Appendix, and it is headed "Provision for
Savings and Retirement Program for Physicians.11

And since

this is the key to the case, I would like to read the
paragraph.
"In the event that Medical Group establishes a
savings and retirement plan or other deferred compensation

8
plan approved by Health Plan, Health Plan will pay, in
addition to all other sums payable by Health Plan under this
Agreement, the contributions required under such plan to the
extent that such contributions exceed amounts, if any,
contributed by physicians."

As the plan was established, the

physicians made no direct contribution.

"Provided, however,

that Health Plan shall ccvr-once contributi-: no July 1 . 5.959,
and provided further that Health Plan’s obligation to make
such contributions shall continue only so long as this
agreement or any. continuation or extension generally similar
to this Agreement shall remain in effect.'*
And it appears later in the Appendix at page 162
that the rate of Health Plan's contribution to this trust
shall be 12 cents per member per month.

And with 350,000

members, that worked out to about $500,000 per year.

And

the .record shows that over a period of four years something
over $2 million was paid by Health Plan into the retirement
trust.
Following the execution of the Medical Service
Agreement, that is, the agreement between Health Plan and
Medical Group, the trust agreement was entered into.

It was

actually signed about December 30, 1959, but it was effective
as of July 1, 1959, the data when the agreement between
Health Services and Medical Group became effective, and
nothing turns on the fact that there was some delay in working

9
out and finally signing the trust agreement.
As 1 have already indicated, the trust agreement
is entitled "Retirement Plan for the Permanente Medical
Group/' and it is a typical non-vested retirement trust.

It

provides for benefits only to physicians, but it includes
not only the partners in Medical Group but also physicians
who are employees of the Group.

It provides for tentative

credits for each physician based upon his age, experience,
and length of service.

It provides that these credits may

be forfeited if the physician leaves the partnership or its
employ, except under certain circumstances.

In that event,

the forfeited amounts are creditable to the other physicians
who are beneficiaries of the trust.
As the respondents here agree and expressly state
at page 4 of their brief, in no event is any amount
refundable to Health Plan.
Q

Mr. Solicitor General, if a physician’s

interest—a partner physician's interest—is forfeited, then
I take it the Internal Revenue Service in some way would
recognise the extent of his, shall I call it loss, at that
time in the year of forfeiture?
MR. GRISWOLDs

No, Mr. Justice.

I think

we get to

that question only if we assume that the payments are income
to the trust.

But if it is decided, as we contend, that the

payments are always income to Medical Group, then it simply

becomes a question of what is the distributable share of each
partner5s income in that trust each year.

And the payment

to the trust, we contend, is income to the Medical Group
partnership and is a part of the income which must be
shown on the information return of the partnership and
allocated to the partners in proportion to their interest in
the partnership income.

Therefore, what happens to any

particular physician's interest in the trust is irrelevant
as far as this case is concerned.
Q

That I understand.

But I wondered whether he'

does not have a loss of some kind at the time of forfeiture
that might be assertable.
MR. GRISWOLD i

I do not believe so, Mr. Justice.

He simply has, perhaps, a reduced income from the trust
which will affect him, but this is from the point of view of
the tax law as we contend, the same as if the payment was
made to Medical Group and Medical Group then made a payment
to the retirement trust.

That would not be income to the

partner when it was paid to the retirement trust, and it would
not be a loss to the partner if he had a forfeiture.
I think this all turns on the somewhat subtle but
nevertheless controlling issue in this case. Are these payment
income to Medical Group?—-which we contend they are—Or are
they income to the retirement trust which is the basis which
the court below decided.

Q

Mr. Solicitor General, I suppose the

retirement plan for general employees other than physicians
involves a substantial number of people and a substantial
amount of money.

Are those employees taxed on the deferred

income on the year in which it is contributed to the pension
fund or when they receive it at the end of the line?
MR. GRISWOLD:

Mr. Chief Justice, that depends on—

in the first place, there is nothing in. t '

record sie ve

hi;-,

whatever.
Q

Taking a typical one that we are familiar

with—
MR. GRISWOLD:
retirement plan is for

Taking a typical one, if the
employees and if it is non-

discriminatory so that it meets the standards of Sections
401 and following of the Internal Revenue Code, then the
amounts paid into it would be deductible by Medical Plan and
would not be taxable to the employees until they were paid
out to the employees.
Section 401.

This plan is quite clearly not within

In the first place, it is discriminatory because

it applies only to the top salaried people, the physicians,
but even more clearly, it is not exclusively for employees and
their beneficiaries, which are the only things to which the
retirement trust provisions in Section 401 apply.

In the

years involved here, at least 1960-61, there was no provision
whatever in the law for deduction of retirement benefits for

self-employed persons, and partners are, of course, selfemployed persons as partners in lav; offices have known with
respect to the tax law for a long time.
Q

Mr. Solicitor General, I take it that the

Government's theory is that the money is paid to the trust
and it is for the use and benefit of the partnership and is
income to it?
MR. GRISWOLD:

Yes, Mr. Justice, that is exactly it.
«

Q

The individual partner would only actually

benefit by it if he does not leave the partnership and retire
as pursuant to the plan.

At the time he does something that

results in the forfeiture, he will already have paid taxes
on a certain amount of money that was income to the partnership
and is now in the trust.

Does he not, when he leaves the

partnership, resigns or something, he has no kind of a
capital loss?
MR. GRISWOLD:
even an ordinary ios3.

He may, Mr. Justice, have perhaps
He may have a deduction for a loss.

There is no basis in this record for determining that, and
there is no issue in this case as to t?iat except, as it bears
on the remaining problem.
Q

It would be a very odd situation in the tax

law, would it not, if you based taxes on some income and it
does not even enter your basis in soma property?
MR. GRISWOLD:

Yes, it would certainly increase his

13
basis in the partnership.

It would certainly increase his

basis in the partnership.

Indeed, there has been confusion

in this case about this.

It is a complicated case, but let

me point out--Q

Hr. Solicitor General, this was my question

and perhaps I did not phrase it very well.

But it seemed

to me that on the Government's theory, if there is taxability
to the partnership and hence to the underlying partners, that
there had to be some kind of a deduction eventually in the
event

of

departure from the partnership and forfeiture.
MR. GRISWOLD:

Mr. Justice, I think my answer was

quite inadequate and perhaps illustrates the difficulty of
the case to one who has been working on it for months.

It

is quite plain that the increase in income not offset by a
corresponding withdrawal of funds from the partnership would
increase each partner’s basis in the partnership and would be
taken into account in one way or another when—
Q

Money that went into buildings that he could

not take away with him when he left?
MR. GRISWOLD:
ship.

Money he withdrew from the partner­

Incidentally, in the foldout just before page 203 is

the computation of the amounts allocated to each partner in
this case by the revenue agent, and I think this illustrates
the same thing, because I believe that there was an error by
the revenue agent in calculating the deficiencies because he

14
apparently allocated the payment to the trust on the basis of
the retirement formula in the trust,

But the payments should

have been allocated only to partners and to parIneza on a
pro rata basis, since that is the way that all earnings in
excess of drawing accounts were distributable under the
partnership agreement.
This question is covered by paragraph 24 of the
stipulation at page 87, down at the bottom.

"The parties

agree that any recomputations of the various sums involved in
these actions, -which may be required by the,Court’s
adjudication herein, will be made,verified and settled bycounsel.l'

And I feel fairly confident that after this Court's

decision, that can be done.
But in the interim, the counsel cannot agree upon
such recomputations,

The sums may be settled by the Court

upon application and ten days notice.

And I mention this

because it may be what threw the court below off the track,
the same way that I think I was thrown off the track, and I
would like to avoid suggesting the same error here.
Thxs case can be made to appear, and very likely is,
,-ery complicated.

There is even a considerable discussion in

the respondents’ brief to the effect that the Government is
proceeding on the entity theory of partnerships while it is
sa.id that the conduit theory is applicable.

It seems odd

that we sSiouid still be discussing such things in 1972.

I

15
think it is by new accepted that partnerships are both
entities and aggregates and are so treated in the tax law.
They are treated as entities for the purpose of filing
information returns.

But partnerships are not taxed under

our law and never have been.
partners.

The tax is imposed on the

They are not taxed on their income actually

received from the partnership.

What they are taxed on is

their distributive share of the partnership income whether
they receive it or not.

I do not want to oversimplify this case# but 1
would like to suggest that the question at issue here was
resolved many years ago and that the case# on careful
examination, involves no question which has not been longestablished in our tax law.

The first of two cases is the

venerable classic, Lucas against Bari decided in 1930 in an
opinion by Justice Holmes.

That case involved an agreement

between husband and wife under which the income of the
husband became the joint property of both spouses„

It was

contended and the Ninth Circuit held that the income was
taxable half to the husband and half to the ttfife.

But this

Court reversed Justice Holmes in his well-known opinion, and
said:
subtitles

"This case is not to be decided by attenuated
There is no doubt that the statute could tax

salaries to those who earned them and provide that the tax
could not be escaped by anticipatory arrangements and contracts

however skillfully devised to prevent the salary when paid
from vesting even for a &<jaoa/.l in the man who earned it.
That seems to us the import of the statute before us, and we
think that no distinction can be taken according to the
motives leading to the arrangement by which the fruits are
attributed to a different tree on that from which they grew»
The other case is Mainer v. Me1Ion in 304 O.S.
That involved a partnership and involved income which, under
the applicable state' 'law, could not be paid.

Ant: the Court

held that it was nevertheless income to the partnership aril
came within the distributable share.
Let me turn to a hypothetical example.

Let as

assume a large law firm with a hundred or more partners and
as many associates.
a Cromwell.

For convenience 1 will call it Ropes

Let us assume that it has a large and important

client, which we will call International Conglomerates, Inc.
The cient has worldwide operations and is constantly
confronted with legal problems.

It has its own legal staff,

but it. relies heavily on the services provided by Ropes &
Cromwell.

International Conglomerates is much interested in

the continuity of the services of the individual members of
Ropes & Cromwell.
In the past, Ropes a Cromwell has billed at
appropriate intervals and these have been paid.

Now let us

suppose that Ropes & Cromwell suggest to the corporation

17
that hereafter ten percent of the bill ba paid to the law
firm’s retirement fund.

Obviously enough, this would make

no difference under Lucas v. Earl and the Culbertson case,
the entire amount would be taxable to the partnership.

I do

no think it would «sake any difference that the law firm's
retirement fund was a non-vested one under which no partner
had any immediate right.

The payment to the retirement plan

would still foe income to the partnership of Ropes a Cromwell
because it is a payment made on account of services rendered
by the partnership and taxable to the partnership under
Lucas v. JBarl.
Now let us suppose that instead of.a payment to the
firm’s retirement fund, the payment is made to a trust for
such of the wives of the partners of Ropes & Cromwell as
survive the partners.

Here no partner would have any right

to receive any specific amount,

I suggest, though, that the

payments would still be clearly income to the partnership.
And, finally, let us assume that International
Conglomerates came to Ropes & Cromwell and said, “We are very
much interested in the continuity of your firm and in
encouraging people to stay here in order that they may have
background and experience in our work, with the result that
when we have a problem we may go to someone who already knows
a great deal about our business and the way we operate.
Accordingly, we want to join with you in establishing a non-

18

vested pension plan under which wa will make regular annual
paymentsc and the plan will eventually provide retirement
payments but only to those members and employees of the firm
who satisfy length of service requirements.
That, it seems to me, is what we have here, putting
the respondents8 case in its strongest terms.

But such a

payment would still be a payment by International
Conglomerates, Inc. on account of services rendered by Ropes
& Cromwell and would thus, under Lucas v. Sari and
Culbertson, be income to Ropes & Cromwell.

Since it is

income to Ropes £ Cromwellt each partner of Ropes &
Cromwell would be taxable on his distributive share of that
income, whether distributed or not.

And even though it could

not be distributed, as this Court held in Reiner v. Mellon.
In this case, the payments made to the retirement
fund by Health Plan were made on. account of the services
rendered by Medical Group and pursuant to the compensation
contract between Health Plan and Medical Group, which
specifically provided

for the payment of these retirement

amounts as part of the compensation—-that is in quotation
marks—-payable to Medical Group for medical services to be
provided by Medical Group hereunder.
The whole point here is the payments are income to
the partnership which performed the services.

We do not

gat to the question of the right to receive payments from

the retirement trust until the payments made by the Health
Plan for the services of Medical Group are treated as income
to the retirement trust.
the retirement trust.

But the payments are not income to

They are income to Medical Group under

the clear teaching of Lucas against Earl.

And since the

payments are income to Medical Group, it does not matter that
the partnership Medical Group by its contract caused these
amounts to be payable to the retirement fund in such a way
that no one had an immediate vested, right to get cash and no
partner could currently receive his share.

In this respect,

the situation is like that in another good old case, Griffiths
against the Commissioner, where the Court held that the
taxability of the income currently could not be defeated
despite the technically elegant arrangement which had been
set up to divert the taxability.
For the reasons which I have indicated since the
diversion of earned income, that is, the amounts paid
pursuant to a contract for personal services rendered, runs
directly foul of one of the fundamental principles of income
taxation, that earned income is taxable to him who earns it
no matter what diversionary arrangement is made for its
payment.

The decision below is erroneous and should be

reversed.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
General.

Thank you, Mr. Solicitor

20

Mr. Brookes.
OPAL ARGUMENT OF VALENTINE BROOKESr ESQ.,
ON BEHALF 05' THE RESPONDENTS
MR. BROOKES:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
To a substantial extent, the Solicitor General has
argued another case than the one before you.

Let me first

refer to his example about the mythical law firm of Ropes &
Cromwell.

He suggested that the facts there were that the

law firm suggested that ten percent of what had been its
normal retainer should be paid to a trust, which was to
establish a retirement plan.

Let me read you what tbs parties

stipulated in this case.
"The primary purpose"-Q

Where is that?

MR. BROOKES:

I beg your pardon.

It is on page 83

of the record, Your Honor, and it is in the stipulation of
facts,

It will also appear virtually

in haec verba in the

opinion of the Court of Appeals, which is on page 32 of the
Appendix to the petition for certiorari.

The stipulation is

that:
"The primary purpose of the retirement plan was to
create an incentive for physicians to remain with Medical
Group, or other groups of physicians contracting to serve
Health Plan members, and thus to insure Health Plan that it

would have a stable and reliable group of physicians
providing medical services to its memberss' and so on.
Than it states that the

retirement plan was

patterned after one which was in effect already in Southern
California between another medical group and this same Health
Plan, and finally that:

"The payments which Health Plan

agreed to, and did raake to the plan, were paid solely to fund
the retirement plan, and were not otherwise available to
Medical Group or to the individual members or employees
thereof.11
Q

Mr. Brookes, I presume that the stability

which that paragraph refers to would benefit Medical Group
as well as Health Plan, would it not?
MR. BROOKES:

Yes, Your Honor.

The point that J

•

seek to make is that the initiative was taken by Health Plan
and was for its benefit, according to the stipulation, and it
was so understood by both courts below.

The opinion of the

Court of Appeals is more voluminous and it speaks of the facts
more fully than the district court does.

There were no

findings of fact in the district court other than the opinion.
The Court of Appeals in the opinion, which will appear at
page 32 in the petition for certiorari—and again I mightmake quotations from page 39 of the petition, this is the
appendix to the petition end in that case X would call your
attention to the shift of pages---the Court of Appeals says

the primary purpose of the retirement plan is to insure
Kaiser a stable and reliable pool of physicians providing
medical service to its members.

The plan accomplishes this

purpose by creating an incentive for physicians to devote
their careers .to Kaiser members, and so on.

This is

virtually from the stipulation in haec verba.

But then at

page 3S of the appendix to the petition, the court interprets
that language again.

In distinguishing a circuit court case,

Hulfcert, which had been cited by the Government below, the
court said that Huibert was not in point because though the
partnership, had it chosen not to enter the sales agreement
or had it entered a different one on different terms, would
have received the whole of the payments as current income.
In this case, and I am quoting the Court of Appeals,

the

parties stipulated that "the payments which Kaiser agreed to
and did make to the trust, were paid solely to fund the
retirement plan, and were not otherwise available to
Permanente"—that is the partnership—*!,or to the individual
members or employees thereof."
Then, turning to the next page—
Q

E4r. Brookes, before you go to that—

MR. BROOKES:
Q

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

--I am having a little difficulty seeing how

t

your material in Section IS, page 83 and 84 differs from the
hypothetical that the Solicitor General has suggested.

Would

you pinpoint what you think

the distinguishing factor

which the Solicitor General suggested, ha suggested that the
law firm made the suggestion to its client that a portion of
what had theretofore been paid as the retainer, ten percent,
should be paid into a retirement fund and become deferred
incomeo

The stipulation, as construed by the Court of

Appeals and also by me, says that this is not what happened
there, that this money that was paid into the trust would not
otherwise have been available; it would not otherwise have
been paid for the benefit of the partners and their
employees„
Q

Is that a recital which can control the

economic reality, do you think?
MR» BROOKESs

I think the answer is that probably

the result, is the same in either case, Your Honor»

But I

do wish the facts to be before the Court, and if these two
different thrusts of initiative do make a difference, then I
think the Court should be aware that the Court of

Appeals

below decided the case on an understanding of the facts which
it drew from the stipulation of facts, which was to the effect
that the initiative here came from Health Plan rather than
from the partnership, and the partnership did not ask Health
Plan to take some of the current earnings it would otherwise
have received and defer them

24
How, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the
Court, there are cases which we discuss at some length in
our brief which hold that this initiative, the question of
who suggests the deferment, is irrelevant.

The cases that 1

refer to involve what we call non-funded plans.

This is

where the employer merely refrains from paying sums to the
employee, holds them in its treasury, and pays them later
at some time agreed upon by the parties.

This is a type of

retirement fund.
Q

Mr. Brookes, to get back fox* just a moment

to the line of questioning that the Chief Justice was
♦

pursuing, in paragraph 16 of the stipulation on page 84 of
the record which you had earlier read to us, the last sentence
there, "The payments which Health Plan agreed to,and did make
to the trust,were paid solely to fund the retirement plan,
and were not otherwise available to Medical Group or to the
individual members or employees thereof."

It seems to me a

natural reading of that last sentence would mean that the
funds, after paid to the retirement plan, were not otherwise
available.

Are you suggesting that that means that Health

Plan would not have made these payments in any other form
than as a payment to the retirement plan?
MR. BROOKES:
that language, however.

Yes, I am, Your Honor, not solely from
And, incidentally, the Court of

Appeals adopted the interpretation which I am urging, which is

drawn in part from the language earlier in paragraph 16 ,
which starts out by saying, "The primary purpose of the
retirement plan was to create &n incentive for physicians
to remain with the Medical Group"—and than omitting some
words—■"to insure Health Plan that it would have a stable
and reliable group of physicians providing medical service»"
Q

Mr,. Brookes, if the'medical partnership was

to have received $100,000 a year, Health Plan said, f,we will

pay you the hundred thousand, but we will also pay $25,000
because of some particular benefit we want Health Plan-wise
to the retirement fund."
MR. BROOKES:
Your Honor.

Is that what the argument is?
This is what I have just stated, yes,

This is not my only argument, however.

I am

seeking to get the facts before the Court.
0

I gather the argument is the hundred thousand

would be income, and the twenty-five thousand fha parties
agreed should not be income because it was not pre-paid for
medical services rendered?
MR. BROOKES:

Mo, Your Honor, my point would not be

that the parties would so agree but rather I would turn to the
substance of their agreement, and this gets to what is the
most critical point in this case, in my opinion, which is that
as to the taxpayers the amounts paid into the trust were
wholly contingent and forfeitable.

They had no enforceable

right to them until the lapse of conditions which had not

26
occurred at this time.

They must either serve 15 years or

serve ten years and become 65 before any of their accounts
cease to be tentative.

But even after the attainment of

these conditions, they must continue to make themselves
available, even after retirement, for consultation purposes
and refrain from competition.

If they fail to live up to

those conditions, then too they forfeit, even though their
payments had begun up to the time of the second type of
conditions of forfeiture.
Q

On your theory, when is, if ever, anything

taxable to the partners?
MR. BROOKES:
Q

When they get it, Your Honor.

Does your approach and your analysis of these

facts tie in with the history of the Permanente Group and
Health Plan; were they not born out of the same ball of wax
originally?
MR. BROOKES:
general way, Your Honor,

Oh, 1 think not, except in the most
There had been a predecessor

Health Plan had been in existence for years

prior to the execution of any of the contracts that are in
the record here.

Indeed, it entered into the employment

agreement, if X may so term it, with the partnership six
months before the establishment of the funded plan.

So,

there was a period of six months in which it was contemplated,
•there might be such a pian, but it was not in being and yet

27
the physicians were working under the partnership agreement
and the other agreement with Health Plan®

These were not,

however, simultaneously born.
Q

Are you suggesting that the two organisations,

Health Plan and the Medical Group, just came together by
accident?
MR. BROOKES:

Ho, X am not, Your Honor.

The Health

Plan was established by a funding of a large sum from a.
prominent California family for the purpose of pro\Tiding
pre-paid, low-cost medical care on a non-profit basis.
existed.

It had a hospital.

It acquired more.

It

It found

that it could not operate them without physicians.

It also

found that it could not. balance the budget if outside
physicians selected by the patients were employed at normal
fee rates.

So, it became necessary to establish a

relationship with a group of physicians who had provided
exclusively with their services.

It is the outgrowth of

years of experience which has produced the documents in the
record here.

There was a prior partnership, a prior

partnership agreement.

The one before you was entered into

in 1959, and the record does not state how long back in
history the prior relationship of Health Plan with other
partnerships had been created, and I do not know.
Q

It is a very celebrated development in medical

practice, of course, in California.

MR. BROOKESs
essential

So it is, Mr. Justice, and the

key to its success is the availability of a

group of physicians under the exclusivity conditions which
exist here.

The court below used the language "exclusivity";

it was not original with me.

I am borrowing their language,

and it is exclusive in both directions.

That is to say,

Health Plan contracts to have the medical services performed
exclusively by the physicians who are either partners of or
employees of the partnership, and in turn the partnership
contracts that its partners and its employees will perform no
services for any other health plan but this one.

There is a

limited provision for their having private practice, in which
case their earnings go into the partnership as wall.

But

their private practice is not permitted to interfere with
■their services for Health Plan, because they must provide
their full time or the equivalent thereof for Health Plan.
The Court of Appeals, in further response to your
question, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, as to whether I correctly
interpret that one sentence in the stipulation isolated from
the balance of the stipulation, said that the agreement
provides that Kaiser*s contributions to the plan are to be
in addition to all other sums payable by Kaiser. "Thus, had
Permanente elected not to establish the retirement plan, it
could not have received additional current income."
It then states;

"Nor is there any evidence in the

29
record"—this is at page 40 of the appendix to the petition
for certiorari'— "Hot is there any evidence in the record to
suggest that Permanente agreed to accept less direct
compensation from Kaiser in exchange for the retirement plan
That Kaiser would not have been willing to make

payments.

the payments except into the trust under the conditions
imposed is consistent with the primary purpose of the
retirement plan: to insure Kaiser a

stable and reliable

group of physicians.., ,We therefore conclude that Permanente15 •
there is a deletion at this point? Mr, Chief Justice—-"We
therefore conleude that Permanente? never having had the
right to receive the income? could not have diverted it to
others,"
This, X believe? distinguishes this case, from the
hypothetical of the law firm that was assumed for argument
purposes by the Solicitor General,

Q

Yon are not conceding? as X understand it?

Mr, Justice? I am glad you gave me

the opportunity? of making that clear,

I do not

concede that that difference—-that the ease depends upon that
difference.
Q

My case is—

The Court might so find it and X think

also the difference may create a climate for the approach to
the case, and 1 would like that climate, which I consider to
be somewhat adverse, to be removed.
no difference, no distinction.

The law probably makes

The rules are quite clear in

the status of employees or independent contractors, that the
result we argue for would follow because their interests in
the retirement payments are entirely forfeitable and
contingent.

Even in the event of a non "-qualified plan where

there are employees, Congress has stated its policy, and its
policy is with a funded but non-qualified plan.

This is a

funded plan and a non-qualifiad plan.
The payments by the employer to the trust or into
the fund are not current income to the employee if their
rights are non-forfeitable at the time that the payments are
made, Section 402(b) of the Code so states.

We cannot claim

that we come under the umbrella of that section because we
are independent contractors, we are- not employees.

It is

true that some of the physicians are employees, but they are
employees of the partnership and paradoxically the Government
does not seek to tax them.

On the contrary, if seeks to tax

the amounts paid to the retirement fund for their possible
future benefit to the partners and would allow the partners
no deduction for the amounts that are actually potentially

31
receivable by the employees.

And the paradox becomes

complete because of the fact that this so works out, this
plan* that it is quite possible that ultimately the only
beneficiaries will be the employees.

If the partners all

peel off one by one and leave no one but those persons who
are presently employees as participants in the plan, all
forfeitures go to the benefit of those remaining in the plan,
and I have indicated by hypothesis that they are employees.
They may later become partners, but at this time they are
employees and maybe the
Q

sole beneficiaries.

But is not this, Mr. Brookes, what the

statute provides for, one status for partner and another
status for employee.

Your quarrel there is with the statute,

is it not?
MR. BROOKES:
the statute.

Mo, Your Honor, we seek to rely upon

We do not believe -that the Government’s

position based upon Lucas against Earl is sound because it
is not derived from the statute.

Lucas against Earl is

certainly a distinguished and important case, but to
illustrate, Your Honor, how statutes may change, what has
been the law in the past, if Mr. Earl is 3till alive, he can
derive the benefits from the statute which he could not
derive under the method he attempted in Lucas against Earl,
because all he need do now is file a joint return With his
wife, and he would get the split income benefits that he

32
sought by the device that was denied him,

so, statutes do

change things, and we rely upon the statute.

And we have

discussed this at considerable length in our brief, and I
would like---it is difficult to discuss a statute in oral
argument without the statute before you, but I—-this is not
such a complex statute as that.

First, the Section 701 which

appears in the appendix to respondents' brief, which is the
white one, it appears at page 3 of the appendix.

The

appendix is separated from the rest by a blue insert sheet.
It says that "A partnership as such shall not be subject to
the income tax....Persons carrying on business as partners
shall be liable for income tax only in their separate or
individual capacities.11
The point that we sea in that section is that
Congress is thinking of a partnership not as an entity
conducting business but rather as an aggregate of individuals,
of persons, carrying on business as partners.

It is consistent

with that thrust, that emphasis, that Section 703, which
appears on page 5 of cur appendix, says that "The taxable
income of a partnership shall be computed in the same manner
as in the case of an individual except that55'—and none of the
exceptions is applicable here, and the Government has never
contended that any of them was applicable here.
So, it says that "The taxable income of a partnership
shall be computed in the same manner as in the case of an

individual,."
There is history behind these cede sections„

They

are derived--the language which I have read is derived
without significant change from the prior code»

This Court

construed the prior code in Nauberger to adopt in the context
then before it the aggregate theory rather than the entitytheory.

There are lots of words used for -these theories and

though the Court used both the entity language and the unitlanguage and it also referred to the partnership as an
association of individuals and it allowed a partner to offset
his individual, non-capital losses against his share of the
partnership,s non-capital losses, even though the statute
could more readily have been construed in the other way
under the doctrine of

eaf generis

which the Court refused

to apply because it thought, and I quote, that "Congress
haa recognised the partnership both as a business unit and
as an association of individuals.

But," they said, "this

weakens rather than strengthens the Government's argument
that the privileges are distinct and that the unit
characteristics of the partnership must be emphasized."
And interestingly at that point they cited among
the cases a case from the Court of Claims, the Craik case.
And the Craik case involved a non-resident who was a member of.
a resident partnership.

The question was whether he was

taxable upon the entire distributive share of his income of

34
the partnership or merely a portion of it.

Some of the

partnership income was also from foreign sources as he
resided abroad.

And the Court of Claims used the language

undoubtedly referred to by this Court in referring to the
Craik case, that at common law each partner was the agent for
the other partners in carrying out their common purpose.

The

income earned by the partnership was regarded as having been
earned by the individual partners either by himself
individually or through his agents, the other partners.

The

court below used the term that the partnership was acting
only as the agent of its members and it used it in this
context, in this sense? in the petition and in the brief
both, the Government has sought to

snake capital of the use

of the term agent, but this is the classical concept of the
relationship of one partner to the other, and in the Craik
case which this Court spoke of approvingingly in Neuberger,
the Court did say that each partner was regarded as having
earned the income.

The statute says in Section 701 that the

businesses done by individuals, by persons doing business in
the form of a partnership and it says that the income of the
partnership shall be computed in the same manner as in the
case of an individual.

If those instructions are applied,

then we see that the fact that the payments into the trust by
Health Plan create only forfeitable and contingent rights in
the taxpayers is controlling.

Under volumes of doctrine,

jD

including many decisions from this Court, whether on the
cash or the accrual basis, a taxpayer does not have income so
long as his claims to whatever the property is remain
contingent and forfeitable.

That rules has been applied

consistently in deferred compensation cases.
Lucas against Earl has never been applied in
deferred compensation cases.

It has been cited by the

Government time after time in deferred compensation cases,
as it was in both courts here, and it has been rejected in
all of those cases, including the two courts below here.
And the reason is, Mrs. Earl received money in 1921 and it
was at that time that Mr. Earl was held taxable upon it.

He

was not held taxable upon any income in an earlier year
before somebody received it.

And so it should be here.

These

individuals should be taxable when they receive their income
and not before.
Q

Of course in Lucas against Earl you did not

have the added ingredient of a partnership.
MR. BROOKES:

This is true, Your Honor.

The Code

has further answer to the Government's position, and that is
it says that—-this is Section 704.

It appears in the

appendix to our brief and the relevant part is on page 5;
it is the first words of Section 704.

"A partner's

distributive share of income, gain, loss, deduction, or
credit shall"—-and so on~---s,be determined by the partnership

36
agreements” Then it goes on—and 1 was mistaken, this is the
critical language»

"A partner's distributive share of any

item of income shall be determined in accordance with his
distributive share,” unless the agreement of the parties
provides to the contrary.
The point is that a partner is not taxable
inflexibly on x-percentage of the net income of the
partnership.

appreciated value to be the sole taxpayers on'that
appreciated value if the property is sold for a profit.

So

that the gain which the partners have bought by admitting the
new partner will not be taxable to all of them proportionately.
Q

What happens—and I am just asking for

information—what happens if part of the income of the
partnership in a particular year is invested in a capital
asset, which of course would be presumably depreciable?

Is

any of the property that was so invested figured in the
distributive share of

Q

If it was sold—

Not sold.

Let us say the partnership bought

MR. BROOKES j.

The point of appreciation in value

above: basis would be related to the depreciation to be taken
by the partnership, not to the number of years»
Q

That in subsequent years, I understand.

MR. BROOKES:

In subsequent years, yes»

How, the statute and the regulations recognise
this, permit the parties to vary the depreciation amongst
themselves.

So. that the depreciation may go to the party

who contributes the appreciated asset rather than beingenjoyed by the partners who have not contributed the
appreciated asset.

And, conversely, in the example I gave

a moment ago, if that property, that building should be sold,
the statute permits that partner to be the one exclusively
taxable upon that appreciation which has now become gain.
So, the distributive share may be only of one item
of gross income.

And my point is that a distributive share

is a proportionate share.

A case the Government relies on,

He gets depreciation in the future.

So,

But the point that I am seeking to make

goes off from that, Your Honor, and it is about the word
"distributive."

The statute now permits distributive shares

to relate to items of gross income, not merely to the sum of
net income, and the word "distributive" was construed by this
Court as meaning proportionate.

And here no partner knows

what his proportionate share of this item of income is, if it

is income»

Of course, we deny that it i,v income.

But if it

were deemed to be income of the partnership, his proportionate
share is unknown.
Q

It is dependent upon future events.

And you do not know what is going to happen
either, do you?

It is purchased from taxable income

Q

Mr. Brookes, I should ask a question when the

red light is on, but suppose everything were exactly the
same as it is here except that Health Plan paid this amount
to Medical Group and Medical Group in turn promised to pay
it over to the trust and did in fact pay it over to the
trust.■ Any question about its taxability to the partners
under those circumstances?

Medical Plan has never received this

important in the income tax law.

important.
