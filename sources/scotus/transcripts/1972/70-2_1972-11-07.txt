Mr. Solicitor General.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERWIN N. GRISWOLD? ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. GRISWOLD;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
This case and the following one are here on reargu­
ment.

Fortunately neither involves any factual question about

obscenity.

Each case involves a construction or application

of the Constitution or of the statutes of the United States
alone.
This case is a customs forfeiture proceeding?
brought under Section 1305 of Title 19 of the United States
Code.
As the Court will recall, that is, in form, an in rem
proceeding against certain articles which were found in the
customs, and it was begun by the filing of a complaint for
forfeiture by the United States Attorney.
That appears on pages 2 and 3 of the Appendix.
The procedure was apparently somewhat informal, or
the Appendix is incomplete? no motion to dismiss appears in
the Appendix.

And, as far as can be told from the Appendix,

the owner of the materials never had a lawyer.

He apparently

dealt with somecns in the United States Attorney's office.
The next thing we know is an Order of Dismissal,
which appears on page 5 of the Appendix, where Judge Ferguson
said the case depends

upon Section 1305; "it further appearing

that a three-judge court in United States v. 37 Photographs,
determined that Section 1305 is unconstitutional on its face;
and it further appearing that this Court ought to abide bv
that decision pending its possible review in the United States
Supreme Court.
"It is ordered that the action is dismissed.”
Thus, the decision depends upon a determination that
Section 1305 is unconstitutional on its face, a determination
which this Court has subsequently rejected in this Court’s
decision in 37 Photographs, which reversed the District Court
in California, and is reported in 402 U.S.
Up to that point there are no facts.
a trial.

There never was

There was, however, a motion by the United States

Attorney to stay the order of dismissal, which would have
resulted in turning the items,which are called the defendants,
over to the claimant, and there was,in connection with that,
filed an affidavit by the claimant which appears on page 9.
I can only surmise, but I find myself with a feeling
that it was probably written by an Assistant United States
Attorney in cooperation with the claimant, because the
claimant has not had counsel.

5
And in the affidavit, the claimant says "That none
of the defendants were imported by me for any commercial
purpose but were intended to be used and possessed by me
personally."
And in the motion to stay the order of dismissal,
the Assistant United States Attorney, on page 7 of the record,
savss

"The Court is further advised that the plaintiff has

no evidence with which to contradict Mr. Paladini8s affidavit,
and, therefore, does not contest the fact that this was a
private importation."
And that is the basis upon which the case is here.
It is thus purely a question of construing and
applying the First Amendment with respect to articles which
are conceded to be obscene for the purpose of the case,
because the forfeiture was ordered dismissed, because the
statute was held to be unconstitutional on its face.
That could have been only under an application of the First
Amendment, and so we are confronted here with an almost
pure question of the construction and application of the
First Amendment.
I find it very difficult to think of it in terms of
construing the First Amendment, because I can find nothing
in the First Amendment that seems to deal with that.
"Congress shall make no lav; ... abridging the
freedom of speech, or of the press ..."

s
Now, I think we can put speech aside.

No one has

undertaken to speak, no one has spoken, no one is being told
that he can't speak anything he wants.

With respect to the

press, there is no prior restraint, and no one is stopping
the presses.

It has never been supposed that the First

Amendment prevents legal action with respect to the product
of the press, in cases where that is warranted.
QUESTION: But it’s not your point, is it, that the
First Amendment is wholly inapplicable to this case because
these things were printed outside the United States?
MR. GRISWOLD:

No, no.

No, Mr. Justice.

I think

the First Amendment is applicable with respect to any action
by officers of the United States.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. GRISWOLD:

The fact that they were printed

abroad, we don't even know that they were printed abroad.
They may have been reimported.
QUESTION: Well, we don't know.
QUESTION:

Mr. Solicitor General, you're not

suggesting that all of these defendants, so-called, are not
forms of expression, are you?
MR. GRISWOLD: All of them are forms of —
QUESTION; Expression.

Are they not?

I see there

are reals of film, brochures, —
MR. GRISWOLD:

They are reels of film and printed

There's a whole lot •—

much more in this than I thought there was.

A good many

They are forms of expression, aren't they?
MR. GRISWOLD; They are forms of expression, but

no one is abridging the freedom of the press here.
seeking to prevent the printing of material.
to prevent the importation of material.

No one is

They are seeking

But that is not

preventing the printing of the material.
But let me move to the next aspect of the argument.
Actually, I suppose, this case turns entirely on the
meaning and application of four decisions of this Court.
Thera are, of course, a good many others which are in the area.
But the four are the Roth case, decided in 1957; Stanley v,
Georgia, decided in 1969; United States v. Reidel, decided in
1971; and United States v. 37 Photographs, also decided in
1971.
The first of those is the Roth case, and I believe
there are only two members of the Court now sitting who
participated in that case.
The Roth case refers -- the opinion of Justice
Brennan refers to the universal judgment that obscenity should
be restrained, reflected in the international agreement of
over 50 nations and the obscenity laws of all the 48 States,
and in the 20 obscenity laws enacted by the Congress from

8

1842 to 1956, and continues» this is the same judgment
expressed by this Court in Chapilnsky v, New Hampshire» where
the Court said that there are certain well-defined and
narrowly limited classes of speech» the prevention and
punishment of which have never been thought to raise any
constitutional problem.

These include the lewd and obscene.

"It has been well observed that such utterances are
no essential part of any exposition of ideas." That was why
I was a little hesitant in answering your question. "And are
of such slight social value as a step to truth that any benefit
that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed by the
social interest in order and morality."
And then follows the key sentence;

"We hold that

obscenity is not within the area of constitutionally protected
speech or press."
Now» that sentence has» of course, been quoted
many times since, but if these materials which are conceded
to be obscene on this record are not within the area of
constitutionally protected freedom of speech and press» this
is not a First Amendment case.
Now, that case was 15 years ago, a lot of water
has gone over the dam, this is an extremely difficult area,
on which there have been sharp differences of opinion; but
through it all, Roth and that passage have survived.

And

I find it very difficult to see, in 1972, if the Court's

9

position is that obscenity is not within the constitutionally
protected area of freedom of speech and the press, that there
is any First Amendment problem here,
QUESTION: Well, I just wonder, you say that
notwithstanding Stanley?
MR. GRISWOLDs

Yes, Mr. Justice, because in Stanley,

Well, Mr. Solicitor, I'm just suggesting

— what Stanley stands for, at least, is that in the circum­
stances involved in Stanley, that the government has no power
to suppress something called obscenity.
MR. GRISWOLD:

Mr. Justice, I would think that the

way to combine Stanley with Roth would be to say that Stanley
is applicable —

11
on the Fourth Amendment.
There is a great deal of talk about the First
Amendment in Stanley, the dissenting opinions?

or the

concurring opinions rested it on the Fourth Amendment.

1

find it quite easy to handle the two cases on that basis.
I find it very difficult to find consistency betx^een Roth and
the statement in the Stanley opinion.

"Roth and the cases

following that decision are not impaired by today9s holding."
Now, they certainly are impaired as to the privacy
of a man’s home.

And if that sentence had said? "except with

respect to the privacy of a man’s home?

Roth and the cases

following that decision are not impaired by today's holding?"
I could follow it better.
The statement, however, made in the opinion of the
Court was quite unqualified.
And then we have, a year and a half ago, United
States v. Reidel, where five members of the Court concurred
in a majority opinion, and Mr. Justice Harlan filed a
concurring opinion, and three members of the Court, dissented.
But in Reidel, the majority — the majority, and,
may I say with respect, including Mr. Justice Stewart, joined
in the statement;

"Roth has not been overruled, it remains

the law in this Court and governs this case."
And if the law is that obscenity, and the materials
in this case are for the purposes of this case obscene, is

12
not protected by the First Amendment,, that would seem to
dispose of the case.
And it went on to say, '“but it neither overruled
nor disturbed the holding in Roth”, and then quoted the
language from Roth, which X have given9 and reversed the
district court in that case by saying that the district court
gave Stanley too wide a sweep.
Finally, the Court said, on page 356, "but Roth has
squarely placed obscenity" —- and this is a majority of the
Court — "Roth has squarely placed obscenity and its
distribution outside the reach of the First Amendment, and
they remain there today.

Stanley did not overrule Roth, and

we decline to do so now."
And then at the very close of the opinion, it says
that these matters remain with State power, Roth and like cases
pose no obstacle to such developments.
Now, Mr. Justice Harlan concurred, and Justices
Marshall, Black, and Douglas dissented.

Immediately following

that decision there was decided United States v. 37 Photo­
graphs , where, as you will recall, there were two questions,
one might be called the time question, the question of the
speed with which the government can operate in this ? and
there was a clear majority on that issue. And we are endeavoring
to carry out that determination of the Court.
But then the Court went on to decide two further

13

questions,, one with respect to the fact that the district
court in 37 Photographs had ruled in favor of the defendant,
even though the importation there was for commercial purposes,
on the ground that the statute was overbroad, because it was
also applicable to a private importation.

And if the statute

was overbroad, then it was unconstitutional, and then it fell
as to commercial importation, too.
And a total of six members of the Court joined in
saying that that application of the statute was wrong, that
the statute was valid as applied to commercial importation.
But only four members of the Court joined in a
plurality opinion with respect to whether a private importa­
tion was covered by the statute.
That opinion by Mr. Justice White is, again, in
strong terms, reiterates Roth, holds Roth fully applicable.
And then we come to Mr. Justice StewartSs opinion,
which made up one of the six, along with Mr. Justice Harlan.
Mr. Justice Stewart, turning to the private aspect of the
importation, says:

But I would not in this case decide, even

by way of dicta, that the government may lawfully seise
literary material intended for the purely private use of the
importer.
And then he goes on to give his own private dictum,
as I read it — perhaps wrong — that it would be invalid as
applied to a private importer.

He concludes:

If the

14
government can constitutionally take the book away from him
as he passed through customs,, then I do not understand the
meaning of Stahjsy v. Georgia? and I can only say, Mr. Justice
that I don’t understand the meaning of Stanley v. Georgia,
particularly in the light of its treatment in the subsequent
cases.
And so we come to the question on which a majority
of the Court has not yet spoken;

whether an importation for

private purposes is in some way, which I find hard to follow,
brought within the language of the First Amendment, or is
within the decision of the Court in Stanley v. Georgia, as
that case has been explained in the case itself and in the
two subsequent cases of Reidel and 37 Photographs.
Now, surely there is nothing in the Constitution
about a distinction between private and commercial, with
respect to the application of the First Amendment.

Surely,

the First Amendment applies to commercial publication.
After all, our newspapers have always been commercial.

Our

television networks are one of the greatest, commercial
activities in the country, where very large sums are made by
use of public facilities, resulting, among other things, in
very high costs for election campaigns.
I don't disparage the slightest the business of
the newspapers or of the television, I simply point out that
a distinction between public and private, with respect to the

15
First Amendment, is — between commercial and private with
respect to the First Amendment is one which finds no applica­
tion or support in any other area? and I find it very
difficult to see why it should here»
Moreover, if, as the Court has not only decided but
has reiterated in recent times, obscenity is not within the
protection of the First Amendment, I cannot see how it makes
any difference whether it is commercial or private, at least
as long as it is not in the privacy of the home, which is the
area which was involved in Stanley, and any application of
Stanley broader than that is certainly not a decision in that
case, but is a dictum of some sort which has not met full
support from the Court in subsequent decisions.
Wow, there are references in other cases to penumbras
of the First Amendment.

I recognize that the First Amendment

ought not to be construed in strictly literal terms.

I have

even contended here that no law does not mean no law, and
that still seems to me to be, in some applications, a sound
argument.
Similarly, the First Amendment need not be construed
literally in its broader application.

But a penumbra, I am

told, is an area of partial darkness between the light and
total darkness.

It is also a realm of great uncertainty,

where the conclusions, I would suggest with great respect,
are not found in the Constitution, but are found in the mind

16

of the person who is writing about the particular problem.
I find it extremely difficult to see how it is
appropriate to extend — I won’t say the Constitution; but
to extend the application of the Constitution to a matter which
for a century and three-quarters, has been regarded as within
the complete control of Congress, under its power to regulate
foreign commerce, the importation of items into the United
States.
The mere fact that it’s private does not seem to me
to justify the conclusion that Congress cannot regulate the
importation.

That would be equally true of narcotics or

explosives, or other material which a person might want to
bring in on his person, a diamond ring or something else that
he had acquired abroad.

He is subject not only to having to

declare those and pay duty on them, but in certain cases to
be searched and to have the property seized.

The mere fact

that it’s private does not seem to me to support it.
The fact that it is in print doesn't seem to me to
help any, at least if there is any vitality to the repeatedly
declared statement in Roth that obscenity is not within the
protection of the First Amendment.
That decision in Roth seemed to me to be sound at
the time. The Court has taken occasion, in a number of
decisions, to reiterate its support for that decision in
Roth, and that seems to me to be sufficient to dispose of this

17
case.
Accordingly, we urge that the judgment below be
reversed.
QUESTION;
legislative history?

Has this statute got any relevant
It seems to have been enacted in 1930.

Is there anything in the legislative history that indicates
the evil to which it was addressed?
MR. GRISWOLD:

Mr. Justice, I cannot answer that.

I think, though this statute was enacted in 1930, that it
had predecessors, and that the full legislative history would
be long and complicated, and I cannot give it to you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Senator Kuchel.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS H. KUCHEL, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR. KUCHEL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
As the Solicitor General has indicated, one Paladin!,
an American, returned home from abroad with certain motion
picture films and printed materials, which were seised by
Customs officials after a search.
was filed.

A complaint of forfeiture

The district court found that U. S. Code 1^05(a),

unconstitutional.
In a motion for stay in the district court, the
United States advised the court, and I quote:

does not

contest the fact that this was a private importation.

18

Also, as the Solicitor General has indicated, the
obscenity of the seized articles is assumed, for the purposes
of this argument.

It is our position that 19 U.8.C. 1305(a)

camiot be constitutionally applied to the facts in this case,
which we believe fall within the scope of Stanley v. Georgia.
In Reidel, Mr. Justice White said for this Court,
quote, “The personal constitutional rights of those like
Stanley to possess and read obscenity in their homes and
their freedom of mind and thought do not depend on whether the
materials are obscene or whether obscenity is constitutionally
protected.

Their rights to have and to view that material

in private are independently saved by the Constitution."
If a man, as Reidel indicated, has the constitutional
freedom of mind and of thought, if he has a constitutional
right to possess and to read, in private, any material,
however shabby or outrageous or offensive it might be to the
rest of us, then the content of that material is completely
irrelevant to his exercise of those rights.

And well it

should be.
For any theory by which our government would exercise
any control over a man's mind or his thoughts, over what, in
his own privacy, he chooses to read or to view is surely
repugnant to our concept of constitutional freedom of the
individual under this system.
Stanley holds, and I quote it, “The First and

19

Fourteenth Amendments prohibit making mere private possession
of obscene material a crime» Roth and the cases following that
decision/’ said the Court in Stanley, 61 are not impaired by
today's holding.

As we have said, the States retain broad

power to regulate obscenity, that power simply does not
extend to mere possession by the individual in the privacy
of his own home."
"We think," said the Court in Stanley, "that mere
categorisation of these films as obscene is insufficient
justification for such a drastic invasion of personal liberties
guaranteed by the First and the Fourteenth Amendments."
And so, one more quote from that decision, "whatever
the power of the State to control public dissemination',' that
is the word, "public" not "commercial", "public dissemination
of ideas inimical to public morality, it cannot constitutionally
premise legislation on the desirability of controlling a
person's private thoughts."
And that sound doctrine, it seems to me, ought to
prevent the State from interfering with the private thoughts
of a person v/herever he may be.

The right to be let alone,

the right to be free from unwanted governmental intrusions
into one's privacy, except in very limited circumstances,
are rights which this Court has said protects the individual
in whatever ha intends to preserve as private, away from the
scrutiny of the public.

20

In Katz vs. United States, the Court said, "the
Fourth Amendment protects people, not places.

What a person

knowingly exposes to the public, even in his ov7n home or
office, is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection....
But what he seeks to preserve as private, even in an area
accessible to the public, may be constitutionally protected."
And in Hof fa vs. United States, the Coux'fc said,
"What the Fourth Amendment protects is the security a man
relies upon when he places himself or his property within a
constitutionally protected area, be it his home or his office,
his hotel room or his automobile.

There", said the Court, "he

is protected from unwarranted governmental intrusion.

And

when he puts something in his filing cabinet, in his desk
drawer, or in his pocket, he has the right to know it will
be secure from an unreasonable search or an unreasonable
seizure."
The home, just, as any other place, may be searched
on the basis of a warrant issued on probable cause, defining
with particularity the subject matter of the search.
The locus of the articles in Stanley’s home clearly
is not what protected Stanley.

What protected Stanley was

that the articles were motion picture films and printed
material, articles with First Amendment implications.

Any

other contraband which might have been found in Stanley’s
home in the course of a lawful search would not have been so

21

protected.

For example, during the search of Stanley's home,

if the officers discovered, in plain sight, an illegal machine
gun or an unregistered x^hiskey still, they xrould have been
authorized to seize it and to prosecute Stanley for illegal
possession of it.

It is therefore clear, I submit, that the

result in Stanley is deeply rooted in the First Amendment.
The right to private possession is in no sense
inconsistent with the government’s right of customs inspection.
In a sense, customs officials are clothed with a blanket
statutory search warrant authority.

To determine what

articles are being imported, whether they may be lawfully
imported and whether and to what extent they might be dutyable.

And, in accordance with Thirty Seven, since obscene

materials, intended for commercial use, may be excluded,
inquiry can be made as to the intention of an importer, of
allegedly obscene materials.
I want to observe that Thirty Seven xvas not a case
of private importation.
The fact that customs officers may not seize
material intended for private use should have no adverse
effect at all on law enforcement responsibilities of the customs
people.
In its brief, the United States argues, and I quote
from page 10 of that brief, that "to subject homeowners to
searches for possession of obscene materials would induce

22

self-censorship reaching to protected speech,, and would
generate a 'chilling effect’ upon the exercise of the First
Amendment right to peruse materials that are not obscene.6'
Unquote.
That apparently is sound argument.

We submit that

it applies with equal impact on the American traveler, who is
returning from abroad.

He has, of course, the unquestioned

right to import non-obscene material.

But would there not be

an equally chilling effect upon him, as he ponders the purchase,
for example, of a book which he believes to be non-obscene
but still is consumed with the fear that some customs people
may disagree with him?
That same chilling effect could easily deter an
American down the street, in this country, from ordering
even a possible classic from a foreign source.
QUESTION:

Senator Kuchel, I suppose one could

carry that one step further and say that the commercial
importer might engage in self-censorship if he has to draw
the line somewhere between obscene publications and nonobscene, and that would have a chilling effect on him.
MR. KUCHEL:

What I'm trying to do is to speak for

the facts in this case, and so far as a commercial importer
is concerned, 1 rather doubt that the fear would run against
the non-obscenity possibility, but it would be the other
way around.

He'd want to import those that would clearly be

23

obscene, if he is interested in commercial distribution.
The Solicitor General, in his argument, referred to
hand grenades and narcotics, privately sought to be brought into
this country, except for the law.

I know of no basis on which

you can equate hand grenades or narcotics with rights
guaranteed to the American people under the First Amendment.
And 1 would say that that is not an argument against the
findings of the district court.
Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Courts
What kind of a constitutional right is the right to
read or to view, undisturbed by the State, if it may only be
asserted behind the closed doors of one’s home?

Should not

that right accompany a person wherever he goes, to his office
or on returning from a trip abroad, as wall as in his home?
And why should his constitutional rights, under the
First Amendment or the Fourth Amendment or the Fourteenth
Amendment or any part of the Bill of Rights, be abridged or
shriveled by equating him with a public distributor of
obscenity?
QUESTION: Do you think that that means that he has
the right to go somewhere and buy it if it’s admittedly
forbidden hard-core pornography?

Or just — are you limiting

it to the right to carry it in his briefcase or his pocket,
have it in his office or on the train or in an airplane?
MR. KUCHELs

Mr. Chief Justice, this Court, in

24

Stanley, recognized a right to receive information.

It did

not comment on whether the reception should be free of charge
or for money.
But if it is the intent, as I would urge it is,
which makes the difference with respect to the intent of for
private use or for public use, then I would take the position
that an individual American citizen, desiring to obtain any
printed information for private use, would have the right to
obtain it, in a lawful manner.
QUESTION: Does that include the right of someone
else, vicariously through the individual’s First Amendment
right, to sell it to him?
MR. KUCHEL:
say no.

I cannot stand before this Court and

I would say that there is a right on the part of

the State to prohibit the dissemination of material which it
would find was obscene.
QUESTION: So that you —
QUESTION:

That means the seller could go to prison

but not the buyer?
MR. KUCHEL:

I regret that I find myself in the

position where I'm seeking to apply the rights to receive,
as Stanley has laid down, but I offer no argument against a
law under which a seller would be guilty of a breach of a
statute.
The case —

Well, that's all right.
The case now pending squarely presents

May the United States constitutionally seise

motion picture films and printed material intended for the
private use of the importer?
The answer is in the negative, and the question
really answers itself.

If intended for private use, then the

character or subject matter of the films and printed material
can be of no concern to the government.
Fundamentally, therefore, and I repeat, it is the
intent which we submit should be controlling.

It may well

be that the whole bundle of a person's private constitutional
right to possess such literary material as he desires, to
think as he wishes, and to view or read what he pleases,
must give way to the authority of the State to prohibit or
control,

at the moment when he does not seek to exercise those

private rights, but, to the contrary, intends to sell or
otherwise distribute to the public any of the material he
has in his possession.
But so long as what material he has he intends to keep

26

to himself in a personal or private way, he should be
protected against the State, either because of Stanley or
because of what Stanley foreshadows, not alone in his home
but anywhere else where he keeps such material in private.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER; Thank you, Senator.
Mr. Solicitor General, you have four minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ERWIN N. GRISWOLD, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. GRISWOLD;

I would like to make only two points

in rebuttal.
The argument that there is a right to receive, and
that this supports the distribution of material, was, in
essence, the heart argument in the Reidel case, and was the
argument which was rejected by a majority of the Court there.
QUESTION; Well, if I understood Senator Kuchel
correctly, he would concede that the very material here
sought to be imported by this man could, by the State of
California or any State, be prohibited from sale in public.
And he's tracing it just from the chain of getting it outside
the country and getting it into his own home, his own office
or his own pocket.
MR. GRISWOLD;

I was undertaking simply to support

Senator Kuchel’s concession on that, to refer specifically
to the Reidel case, which decided it, I believe, and also to
the decision of the Court per curiam in Gable v. Jenkins, at

27

397 US 592, decided shortly after the Stanley case, in which
the power of the State of Georgia to regulate the dissemination
of such material was expressly confirmed*
The other point that I would like to make is that
I think that for practical purposes the distinction between
private and commercial in this area is illusory*

It is

appealing, in a sense, of course, in the sense that led to
Stanley v. Georgia, the freedom of the man's mind to think
what he wants to think*

But there is no practical way to

deal with a decision which says that if the matter is private
it can be imported, but if it is commercial it can't be
imported *
The only thing that you can go by would be the
man’s own statement plus, perhaps, the quantity of materials
imported, and here there was a very substantial quantity*
It's one thing to say it's in his luggage, it's in his
pocket, it's in his home, but how are you going to keep them
there?
QUESTION:

But isn't that stipulated, conceded out

of this case by the concession that it's for private purposes?
GRISWOLD:

It is stipulated that he claims that

they are for private purposes and that the government has
no evidence to the contrary.

How would the government ever

have any evidence to the contrary at the point of importation?

QUESTION: Well, let us say, Mr. Solicitor General,
that the man had three convictions previously for selling this
kind of material.
MR. GRISWOLD:

Yes, Fr. Justice, Fr. Chief Justice,

I can accept and recognize that there would be certain cases
when it would be possible to do that.
QUESTION:

.And there's nothing to prevent the

government from requiring him to sign a sworn statement that
this will not be sold, is there?
FR. GRISWOLD: And then what?
QUESTION:

Then if he violates it —•

MR, GRISWOLD:
QUESTION:

What?

— make a crime out of that.

MR. GRISWOLD:

It would not at least be any crime

under any existing law, if he then sold it.

Moreover, by the

time he has sold it, it is in the stream of commerce, and the
purpose of Congress in trying to keep such materials out has
been entirely frustrated.
practical.

I simply repeat that it is not

A decision that things can be imported by a person

—- does it have to be in his luggage accompanying him, or can
he ship it in, as he comes in?

Or can he ship it in while

he’s abroad, in order to have it home when he gets there?
How would anyone -- how would customs officers,
officers of the government, endeavoring honestly to comply with
the decisions of the Court, deal with it as a practical

2«?

matter?

I submit, that to decide that it can be imported for

private purposes is, in effect, to overrule the consequences
of 37 Photographs, which the Court decided last term.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Thank you, gentlemen.
The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 11:50 o’clock, a.m., the case in
the above-entitled matter was submitted.]
