MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER1

We will hear arguments

next in No. 72-350, United States against State Tax Commission
of Mississippi.
Mrs. Lafontant, you may proceed whenever you're
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. JEWELS. LAFONTANT,
ON BEHJ\LF OF THE APPELLANT
MRS. LAFONTANT I

Thank you.

Mr~ Chief Justice, and may it please the Courts
Mississippi prohibited the sale or possession of
alcoholic beverages until 1966 .

In that year it adopted a

local county option policy subject to the requirement that the
State Tax Commission be the sole importer and wholesaler of
alcoholic beverages.
The Commission promulgated a regulation which
authorized military post exchanges and other military agencies
to purchase liquor either from the Commission or directly
from distillers.

That required that the distillers collect

from the military and remit to the Commission a mark-up cost.
The officers' and non-commissioned officers' clubs,
and other non-appropriated fund activities had purchased
liquor from out-of-State distillers, and suppliers, when
Mississippi was a dry State.

And they decided to continue

this practice rather than purchase from the Commission itself.

4

The United States filed an action seeking declaratory
and injunctive relief aqainst the enforcement of this·
Mississippi regulation that required out-of-State distillers
to collect a percentage sum designated as a wholesale mark-up
on their liquor sales to certain post exchanges, and other
military organizations.
QUESTIOlh

Has the military at any time made

purchases directly from the State?
MRS. LAPONTANT1

None whatsoever.

Uot from any

distillers in the State, and never from the Commission itself.
All of the purchases by the military, all of them had been made
from out-of-State distillers; never from the State.
So the United States filed an action seeking
declaratory judgment, which said that the markup had to be
collected from the military and remitted to the State on
bases in the State of Mississippi, and also required the
distillers to remit the markup to the Mississippi Tax
Commission.
The 1Jnited States, in addition to this , sought to
recover the total of all such payments made by these
military purchasers.

Incidentally, theoe payments were made

under protes-: und by July 31st of 1971 the total payments
made amounted to $648 , 421. 92.
The State of Mississippi ceded , and the United
States acquired jurisdiction over lands within the State,

5

comprising the Keesler Air Force Base and the United States
Naval Construction Battalion Center.

Mississippi also ceded

and the United States accepted concurrent jurisdiction over
lands comprising the Columbus Air Force Base and Meridian
Naval Air Station.
The court below decided against the United States,
stating that the 21st Amendment makes Mississippi law
applicable to the sales of liquor to the military bases, and
the court entered a summary judgment in favor of the
appellees on.all issues.
In its opinion, the court found, and Mississippi
conceded on page 5 of its motion to affirm and dismiss, that
the united States had exclusive jurisdiction on two bases,
namely, Keesler Air Force Base, and the United States Naval
Construction Battalion Center; and in the opinion of the
court the united States and Mississippi had concurrent jurisdiction on the other two, Columbus Air Force Base and the
Meridian Naval Air Station.
And we accept the finding of that court.
The 21st 1\mendrnent regulates the importation of
liquor into a State.

Section 2 of that amendment provides

the transportation or importation into any State of the
united States for delivery or use therein of intoxicating
liquors , in violation of the laws thereof, is hereby
prohibited.

6

We submit that the mere finding of the lower court,
that the government has exclusive jurisdiction, means that the
federal enclave is not within a State but is a separate
territory outside the ambit of the 21st Amendment.
The interpretation of the lower court that the
21st Amendment makes Mississippi law applicable over the
sales to the int.rumentalities on the bases over which the
United States has exclusive jurisdiction is inconsistent witn
the case law.

In Collins vs. Yosemite Park, 304

u.s.

518,

it was held that the regulatory phases of the California law
with respect to the importation and sale of intoxicating
liquors are applicable to a corporation selling liquor in a
national park.

Jurisdiction over which has been ceded to the

United States with a reservation only of the right to tax
persons and corporation in the ceded territory.
To the extent that the statute operates as a purely
tax or revenue measure, it was found that it was enforcible
in the park.
However, license fees could not be enforced because
the State did not reserve the right to regulate or to license
without -- I could say for the exception that it did reserve
its right to issue license fees for fishing, but nothing
concerning alcoholic beverages.
Thus in Collins, California did not derive its right
to impose revenue measures from the 21st Amendment, but did so

7

solely from its reservation of its right to tax.
In this case there was no reservation by Mississippi
of a right to tax, Mississippi reserved only the right to
serve criminal and civil process.
A proper application of Collins would defeat
Mississippi's claim of any right to impose any taxes of a
regulatory or revenue nature, or any taxes whatsoever.
QUESTION:

Mrs. Lafontant, as I understand it,

there are, what, four military installations in Mississippi
of which onlY- two are

are exclusive.

And does this case

involve only those two?

LAFONTANT:

No, this case involves all four.

What I am attempting to do
QUESTION: But certain of your arguments are
applicable only to the two.
MRS. LAFONTANTs

So far.

QUESTION1 So far.

MRS. LAFONTANT, Right.
jurisdiction --

I'm still on the exclusive

8

QUESTION1 And that applies to only two out of the
four?
URS. LAFONTANT1 That's correct.
QUESTION: Thank you.
MRS. LAFONTANT: Thank you.
QUESTIOlh

Mrs. Lafontant, could I ask a question,

please?
MRS. LAFONTANT: Certainly.
QUESTION,

What is the government's attitude with

respect to Mississippi's power to regulate intoxicants taken
off the base?
MRS. LAFONTANT1 The position of the government would
be that Mississippi would have the right to regulate the
taking of intoxicants off . the base.

our position ia it has

no right to tax or regulate intoxicants that are taken in to
the base, which is the military enclave, federal enclave.
In other words, they could have a policeman at the
door, at the gate of the military enclave to check people who
are taking intoxicants off, if that would be the case.

Under

its police
QUESTION: Would it follow from that that they.could
require a declaration each time a person left, much like the
declaration you make when you are coming into the United States,
a declaration stating that you did not have any liquor, or
that you had three fifths.

Would that be possible?

9

MRS. LAFONTANT:

I think the State, within its

powers to control activity within the State, would have that
power.
Qt.mSTION:

And make it a criminal offense for any

or at least attach some kind of sanctions to the violation?
MRS. LAFONTANT:

Yes, sir.

I believe the State of

Mississippi could pass such a law and make that a requirement,
to check every individual who would leave a military
installation, and make them
Q~STION:

That's just smuggling.

MRS. LAFONTANT:
QUESTION,

Yes.

Yes, sir.

You've told us the post orders these

direct from the distillers.

I suppose if they followed the

other alternative of ordering liquor from the Tax Commission,
then they would pay the markup, would they not?
MRS. LAFONTANT, That would be

my

feeling, yes, sir,

Your Honor.
The basic constitutional import of
QUESTION: Suppose that Mississippi required all
purchases to be made from the Tax Commission and didn't
permit buyers this alternative of direct purchasing, then
where would the government be?

Or would they have the right

to, in your opinion?

MRS. LAFONTANT:
Congressional action.

I don't believe in the absence of

I don't believe that they would have

10

the right to prohibit or to really state that they could only
buy the liquor from the State of Mississippi.
QUESTION:

This is sort of Yosemite, isn't it?

MRS. LAFONT1\NT1

Collins vs. Yosemite; yes, sir.

QUESTION: Would your answer -QUESTION:

Congress could surrender some of this,

as a praemissis?
HRS. LAFONTANT:

Yes, sir; and it has done so in

many cases. But to this State it hasn't done it in this
area.
QUESTION,

Is your answer to Mr. Justice Blackmun's

question the same for both Keesler and Meridian?
The concurrent and the exclusive questions.
MRS. LAFONTANT:

No, the answer would not be the

same in the concurrent jurisdiction, I don't believe, Your
Honor.

If I understand the question correctly.
QUESTION:

In the concurrent jurisdiction, then,

the State of Mississippi could require that liq11or be purchased
only from the State beverage outfit?
MRS. LAFONTANT1

I believe so, yes, that would be our

position.
The basic constitutional import of Collins is that the
21st Amendment does not make State laws applicable to an
enclave over which the federal government has the exclusive
jurisdiction.

Any exercise of sovereignty by the State over

11
such enclave must be only through a reservation of right at
the time of cession.
The lower court did not, in its judgment, differentiate between the enclaves over which the United States
exercises exclusive jurisdiction and the other two bases
over which the United States and Mississippi have concurrent
jurisdiction.
The court found it unnecessary to do so, because of
its interpretation of the impact of the 21st Amendment,
stating that_ ?-li.ssissippi laws are applicable to enclaves under
the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States.
It is our opinion that where there is exclusive
jurisdiction, the State has no right to inq,ose a regulatory
or revenue measure upon a federal instrumentality,

Even

where there is concurrent jurisdiction, the State can impose
regulatory measures only when the transactions involve nonappropriated funds.
So that I really have to return to your question,

Mr. Justice, to state that the same would apply for the ones
where there's exclusive j•1risdiction, as well as concurrent
jurisdiction, except where there's non-appropriated funds
I think the State could limit Meridian, such as -QUESTION: Are these funds here all non-appropriated,
all appropriated, or are they mixed?
MRS, LAFONTANT1 They 1 re mixed, Your Honor.

12

Ho, some are appropriated funds.

The commissaries

are considered appropriated funds; the mess halls are nonappropriated.

So we have both kinds in both the exclusive

and the concurrent jurisdiction bases.
As I said, even when there is concurrent jurisdiction,
the State can impose regulatory measures only when the transactions involve non-appropriated funds, such as the holding
of Paul vs. United States, 371 u. s. 245.

-

The Paul case does not involve any enrichment of
the State of California,

It deals with regulatory measures,

to establish minimum health standards in the distribution of
milk through a minimum price statute.

-

Paul should be interpreted as meaning that even

where the State and Federal Government have concurrent jurisdiction, that where the overriding concern of the State for
the health of its citizens does not result in any direct
expenditure of funds from the United States Government, the
interest of the State in the health of its residents shall
prevail.

-

The instant case is even stronger than Paul.

In our

case here we have a direct imposition of a tax upon the
instrumentality of the tlnited States.

There is a direct

enrichment of the State through the imposition of the markup,
and that markup collected by Mississippi, we submit, is a tax,
It is not a voluntary payment by the distillers.

How can it

13

be voluntary when the distillers are threatened with delisting
unless they impose the markup upon the instrumentalities and
remit it to the State?
QUESTION:

Now, this argument goes across the board

to all four bases, I take it?

Mns.

LAFONTANT,

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir.

If the distiller refuses to collect and remit the
markup, he will be denied the right to sell his product, and
he may be prosecuted criminally.

That is, he can be made to

serve up to a year in jail, or pay a fine of $1,000, or both.
lie submit that this tax is a contribution toward
the cost of maintaining Mississippi's governmental function,
since it is paid into the general revenue account.
In addition, there's no service rendered by the
State of Mississippi on the exaction of the markup.

Thus,

it is a payment demanded by the State of Mississippi as a
contribution toward maintaining its governmental function and,
as I said before, it is a tax.
QUESTION:

Would you

MRS. L.I\FONTl\NT:
QUESTION:

In other words,

Mrs. Lafontant, would you say that's

true as to any State liquor operation where the State gets
the markup that a wholesaler normally would, that it's in
effect a tax?
MRS. LAFONTANT:

It depends on how it's collected.

14

I would say this, that if the markup was included
in the price of the liquor and passed on, you might have some
problem showing that it was a direct tax upon the purchaseri
but in this case it's almost like social securit7, or a sales
tax, no one has any question about the fact that tnis money
is collected specifically to be submitted to the State of
1-ti.ssissippi, and it's collected from the purchaser itself.
And then it's put in the general revenue fund of the State,
and the State does nothing to receive this money, although in
the brief of my opponent it is stated that this is for services
rendered by the distiller, in passing this liquor on and
collecting this, this is his service,

But he doesn't collect

the money, the money goes directly to the State of Mississippi.
So, therefore, it certainly is passed on to the
purchaser himself,
QUESTION:

Well, if I understand you, this argument

is predicated on -- even though concurrent jurisdiction -MnS. LAFONTANT:

QUESTION&

Yes , sir.

that the base is an instrumentality

of the United States?
MRS. LAFONTANT:

Yes, sir, the particular agencies

of the united States that are involved, both in the concurrent
and exclusive.
QUESTION: And would this be true without regard to
whether it's appropriated or non-appropriated funds?

This

15

argument.
MRS. LAFONTANT:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION: Well, it would be rather difficult to
establish it was an instrumentality of the United States if
it was non-appropriated funds, wouldn't it?
MRS. LAFONTAI~T:
issue at all.

No, I don't think that• s the

I feel -- we have cases, one case is the

Standard Oil case vs. Johnson, that was passed in 1941,
where Mr. Justice Black held that the messes, which were
considered-~ which aren't from appropriated funds, he held
in that case, Your Honor, that the messes are instrumentalities
of the government.
QUESTION:

And I have his specific language here.
ThoSf.! Tort Claim Act cases , we haven't

had one here for a long time, but -MRS. LAFONTANT:

Federal Tort Claims?

QUESTION:

What's an activity sponsored by

Yes.

non-appropriated funds, is the United States liable under
the Tort Claims Act?

In an officers' club, for example.

It seems to me I remember a swimming pool case, at the
Court of Appeals level, -MRS. LAFONTANT:
QUESTION:

Yes.

where they held it was an instr1.UOOntal-

ity for the purposes of the Tort Claims Act.
Mn.q. LAFONTANT:

I'm not familiar with that case,

the Federal Tort Claims Act case, but I certainly feel that

16
what we• re dealing with is a tax situation •~hich might not
necessarily flow over into
QUESTION:

It wouldn't follow, necessarily, but

there's sorne relevance to it, I would assume.
MRS. LI\FONTJ\?lT: Well, if we followed that thinking a
little further, I would tiay that where you have non-appropriated activities, where there's no financial oetrimcnt to the
United States, that the United States would not be liable.
J\s

the Court stated in United States vs. LaFranca,

at 282 U.S. 568 and 572, a tax is an enforced contribution to
provide for the support of government.

Appellees concede

that the markup payments may be treated as an excise tax
in its :notion to affirm or dismiss , at page 11.
This tax, we submit, is imposed upr,n an instrwnentality of the United States in both the appropriated and nonappropriated bases.
QUESTION: Well, I notice at page 29 of your brief,
you have citation of a statute, Feceral statute, "the status
of post exchanges and other non-appropriated fund activities
as instrumentalities of the United States is recognized• by
that statute.
Is that right?

Mns.

LAFONTANT:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION: But , independently of statute , you would
still say as to non-appropriated funds it would be an instru-

17

mentality of the United States?
MRS. Ll\FONTANT:
QUESTION:

Yes, I would.

Well, does the statute

MRS. LAFONTANT:

Because the -- it has been

interpreted in Standard Oil vs, Johnson that these mess halls
are instrumentalities of the United States, even though nonappropriated funds are -QUESTION:

Nas that statute on the books when that

case was decided?
MRS, LAFONTANT:

In 1941?

I can't find exactly ·,mere you're reading, would
you please -QUESTION:

On page 29, second paragraph of your

footnote 16,
QUESTION1

It begins "The status of post exchanges",

MRS. LAFONTANT:

Yes.

5

u.s.c.

I don't know what

year that would have been.
The fact that Mississippi found it expedient to
collect those revenues directly from the distiller does not
change the reality that the burden of payment is directly
placed upon an instrumentality of the United States Government.
It is true that Mississippi normally imposes the
tax upon the distiller, but in operation and effect, the
tax is one upon the purchaser.
It is well settled that a State may not impose a

18

tax upon the transactions of the United States Government,
or upon its instrumentalities and agencies.

Tt,e tax here is

imposed upon governmental instrumentalities, the United States
Army

post exchange and various clubs.
The Supreme Court in 1942, in Standard 011 vs.

Johnson, 316 U.S. 481, the question was settled that Army
post exchanges are instrUMentalities of the United States,
and Army post exchanges are out of non-appropriated funds,
Mr. Justice Black said there that post exchanges are
arms of the government, deemed by it essential to the performance of governmental functions and partake of whatever
il'tlmunities the 11.rmod Services may have under the Constitution
and the Federal Statutes.
The reasoning of the Johnson case has been extended
to include military messes and officers ' clubs in many cases,
The 'fundamental principle that federal instrumentalities are inunune from State taxation was first stated in
M'Culloch vs. Maryland,

That principle is deeply rooted in

the concept of federalism and has not been abrogated to this
date.
For all of these reasons, and the reasons set out in
our brief, we respectfully submit that the judgment of the
court below should be reversed,
Thank you very much.

1m. CllIEF JUSTICE BURGER1 Thank you.

19
Mr, Wright.
ORAL ARGUMEHT OF ROBERT L. WRIGHT, ESQ.,
ON BEl!l\.LF OF THE 1\PPELLEES
MR. WRIGHT:

May it please the Court,

I am going to first describe to you the nississippi
policy toward military sales of liquor, and then describe the
federal policy toward those sales, and finally discuss this
Court's decisions that accommodate State and Federal liquor
control policies with each other.
Mi~sissippi's policy is, as has been pointed out,
to pree1.pt for itself all profits made from the wholesale
distribution of distilled spirits and wine within its own
borders, and Mississippi also imposes an annual privilege tax
of $900 on package retailers, and excise taxes on all sales
varying from 35 cents a gallon on wine to $2.50 a gallon on
distilled spirits.
Now, the State gives to the military retailers,
these are the clubs -- and, by the way, those are all
stipulated to be non-appropriated instrumentalities of the
United Statesi there's no question about either fact, that
they operate with non-appropriated funds and that they are
instrumentalities of the government.
Now, the State gives to those military retailers
the option of ordering direct from distillers without payment
of any State taxes, providing only that the State's wholesale

20
markup is collected and remitted to the State by the
distiller.
Now, the markup is fixed administratively by the
Commission in accordance with the statutory direction to
cover the cost of operation of the State's wholesale liquor
business, yield a reasonable profit, and be competitive with
liquor prices in neighboring States.
During the period here involved, that markup on
spirits was 17 percent, 22 percent on wine.

Now, that markup

is applied uniformly throughout the State, selling to all
retailers in the State,

And the effect of the military tax

exemption , however, was to give the military retailer a price
on whiskey and gin that was 50 cents a fifth cheaper than the
private retailers pay, because the excise tax exemption allowed
for $2.50 a gallon on spirits.
The military retailers were also exempted from the
$900 a year privtlege tax paid by the private retailers,
Now, the .net effect of the State ' s regulation is
that the military clubs are guaranteed a price on distilled
spirits that is no more than 17 percent above the price at
which distilled spirits are sold in the State,
markup, that' s the State gross profit margin.

This 17 percent
The net

income to the State from the markup is the difference between
the markup and what it costs the State to maintain its
wholesale distribution system,

21
How, that cost is substantial, because it involves
stocking and warehousing a very large inventory of wine and
spirits Statewide.
Now, the cost of this, to carry that inventory, has
to be borne by the State, whether the military chooses to buy
direct from it or direct from suppliers, in accordance with
the option given to the military for their convenience.
Now, when military orders are sent direct to the
supplier, he ' s obliged, of course, to perform the wholesaling
functions that the State normally performs and to remit the
State's normal wholesale markup to the State.
The application of the State's -OUESTIO?h

Mr. Wright, is it your position that

the State could compel purchasing from the State?
MR, WRIGHT:

Indeed i t could.

This option weo

granted to the retailers for their benefit, for their inconvenience,
QUESTION:

Is there any case that you would cite

in support of that statement?
MR, WRIGHT:

We have cited the Collins v. Yosemite

case , which held exactly that as far as California's
excise tax is concerned,

But I'll get to that case later,

I wanted to describe here first how the Mississippi
system operates , and then I ' ll describe how the federal
policy operates.

22

Because after you see how the federal system and
the State system perform, r don't think you ' ll find any
conflict that would force you to reach the constitutional
issue.
now, when the military orders are sent direct to the
supplier, he has to perform those wholesaling functions, but
the military clubs, the united States never performs these
wholesaling functions, whether it buys direct from the
distiller or whether it buys -- whether it chose to buy from
the State, in neither even would the United States or the
clubs perforTII the wholesaler functions, for which a markup is
charged.
Now, the application of this markup to direct saleii
prevents the distiller from adding more than 17 percent to
its wholesale price when he sells to military retailers.
That's the same ceiling that's applied, of course, to sales
that are made by the State to the retailer , because of the
fixed 17 percent markut-'•
QUESTIOH1
MR. wnIGJIT1
QUESTION:

Du:· the distillers don't keep that money.
I beg your pardon?
The distillers don ' t get that money,

right?
MR. WRIGHT1

No.

What they get is the privilege of

selling liquor in Mississippi.

They gain access to the

Mississippi market that they could not have if they didn't

23

comply with llississippi law.
QUESTION:

What does Mississippi give either the

distiller or the club?
MR. WRIGHT:
it gives

It gives the distiller t\70 things:

him the right to distribute his liquor in

Mississippi, and it also gives him a taxfree military market,
that can be exploited without paying the State taxes that
attach to the sales through the private stores.
QUESTION, But all Mississippi wants is the 17
percent, any way they can get it.
MR. WRIGHT:

I am pointing ou<:: that the 17 percent

is a gross profit margin that in itself is not the profit
the States gets.

The difference between the 17 percent

State official, nobody in the State does anything for this
liquor at all.

Right?

track of it.

Other than to accept the money,
Well, they have to -- they do keep

And they do not get the money from the military.

There is no payment made by the military,

These protests

that were talked about are not protests made by the suppliers,
who are actually assessed the charge and who pay it1 those

24

are protests made by the clubs to the suppliers.
QUESTION: Well, do I asswne that the distiller is
any different from any other corporation?

They pass on all

taxes to the purchaser, don't they?
MR. WRIGHT:

Precisely.

QUESTION: hnd that's what they do here.
MR. liRIGIIT: Exactly.
QUESTION: And the distiller is a conduit for your
taxes.
MR. WRIGHT:

Well, it isn't -- I pointed

out there

has to be a tax -QUESTION I

Well, you don't even pay the distiller

for collecting it for you, do you?
MR. WRIGIIT1

It's a wholesale markup.

?Jow, no distiller has protested this obligation,
which is, of course, -QUESTION: Because it doesn't cost him anything.
MR. WRIGHT:

Well, it costs -- it is an impossible

arrangement for him, but I want to point out that the burden
is his, it is imposed on him, the markup obligation.

He's

the one who discharges it.
QUESTION1
MR. WRIGHT:

hnd if he protests
And it is no more of a burden on the

clubs than any other State excise tax or State -QUESTION a But if a distiller sues you or raises a

25

lot of noise, would you still buy whiskey from him?
You wouldn't, would you?
You wouldn't really allow a distiller to sue you,
would you?
MR. WRIGHT,

I'm not suggesting that there was no

There's no doubt about that.

MR. WRIGIIT I
QUESTION1

Mr, Wright,
Yes,
Excuse me, sir,

Do

you have a general

sales tax in Mississippi?
MR, WRIGHT:

I don't believe so,

I don't believe

the tax applies -QUESTIO?I:
MR. WRIGHT1
QUESTION:

Uo sales tax.
There's a tax on liquor.
I'm not talking about liquor, but do you

have a retail sales tax in Mississippi?
MR, WRIGIIT1 There may be one, but I don't think it's
significant in this context,

26

I was just wondering whether a sales tax is collected
from Collll1l0dities sold in an Army post exchange on one of these
bases.
MR. WRIGHT:
exempted.
taxes.

tlo, it's not.

All State taxes arc

The military clubs are exempted from all State

That's in the same sentence of the regulation that

imposes the market, exempts them from all State taxes.
Now, any distiller, even a private one, knows that
none of his wholesale -- if he has an exclusive wholesale
distributor, whether he's public or private, the wholesale
distributor can't be expected to tolerate direct sales that
are made by the manufacturer that undercut his profit.

Collecting and remitting a wholesaler's•- an exclusive
wholesaler's markup, to him on direct sales made for the
convenience of a purchaser, is common industry practice.
How, at the trial , no effort was made by the
United States to show that, absent Mississippi's regulation,
any of the affected military clubs could have bought liquor
from any supplier at a lower price than they actually paid.
Now , from the natu~e of the regulation, I think you
can see that no such showi.19 •.~as possible , unless you assume
that some supplier wanted to penetrate the military market,
could offer special inducements that would offend all the
principles of both State and Federal regulation of the liquor
traffic.

27

now, coming to the Federal regulation, Federal
liquor control policy, unlike Mississippi's, is centered
around practices that have no special bearing on activities
within any State.
However, in some aspects, Federal control is more
decisive than State control; whon it comes to price, for
example, the major part of the average cost -- the cost of
the average bottle of distilled spirits sold anywhere in the
United States is the Federal excise tax, that's $10.50 on
every gallon ef 100 proof spirits.
This means that roughly half the wholesale price on
even the best bonded bourbon is the Federal excise tax.
How, if the Congress thought, as the contention is
made here, that maintenance of military morale requires
lower liquor prices, it could cut the club prices in half by
simply providing a Federal excise tax refund to military
purchasers.
How, the Congress has never been asked by the
Defense Department to solve its morale problems that way.
The only Federal legislation now on the books dealing with
military liquor is the 1951 law that's quoted in the Appendix
here in full, and that statute consists of two sentences,
it's the sole authority of the Defense Department of regulation
that put the military in the business of selling liquor at
retail.

28

Those are also set out in full in the Appendix.
Now, what this law does, on its face, -- I'm talking
about the 1951 Federal Act -- is authorize t.~e Defense
Department to make regulations governing sales to or by
members of the Armed Forces at or near any military base,
any base.

It doesn't make any distinction between exclusive

and other jurisdictions.
QUESTION:

May I ask you a question that's

somewhat like Mr. Justice Powell's question:
Does Mississippi have a tax on cigarettes, for
example, a State tax?
MR, WRIG!JT1

I really don't kr.ow,

I assume they

may have.
QUESTION1
MR. WRIC-,HT I
QUESTION1

Probably do, almost everybody does,
Yes.
Now, can they tax -- I'm not concerned

about whether they do or not1 do you assert that Mississippi
has a right to, the power to tax cigarettes with a State tax
if they are sold in the exchanges?
MR. WRIGHT;

I assert nothing as to cigarettes,

the only assertion here is to liquor, because this is a 21st
Amendment case.
QUESTION1

Yes, I know.

MR, tmIGIIT1 The 21st Amendment doesn't apply to
cigarettes, and it may well be that Mississippi could not do

29

with respect to cigarettes what it has done with respect to
liquor.
lfuat it has done with respect to liquor is brought
within the rights granted by that amendment to control the
distribution of liquor in Mississippi.
Now, the statute I just referred to also makes
these regulations, that the Secretary of Defense can
promulgate, punishable as federal crimes.
QUESTION: Do you have any Indian reservations in
Mississippi? MR.

Do

you know?

WRIGIIT:

QUF.STIO!h

I couldn't say.
I

arn

just trying to get at some of the

same things that -MR, WRIGHT:

QUESTION,

It's possible.
-- we were talking about before.

Would you assert the State's power on an Indian
reservation, -MR, WRIGHT:

QUESTION 1

Well, I think ---

with respect to liquor undar the

21st Amendment?
MR. WRIGHT:

I think the State's power to regulate

stops with the border of the enclave, in any event, as far
as what happens on the base,

The Federal Goverl'lltlent controls

what happens, not the State,
But what wo're talking about here is the cost of

30

liquor that goes in to the base.

As to that, I don't think

there is any question but what the stores operated on the
base are in no better position to resist Mississippi's
control than the private stores.
The entire

returning to the statute, this is

the only Federal law on this particular question of liquor
sales at bases.

The law's entire legislative history is found

on one page of the Congressional Record, as cited in our
brief.

That was adopted as an amendment to the Draft

Extension Act of 1951 by agree~ent, just before the House
passed it.
The amendment was proposed by Representative Cole of
New York as a substitute for one proposed by Representative
Bryson of South Carolina.
Bryson's amendment would have made every base where
draftees were trained bone dry.

Cole said his amendment was

preferable, because it would let regulations made by the
Secretary apply to all bases.

Bryson said that was agreeable

to him1 Cole's amendment was then adopted without any debate ,
without a vote,
NO'l~, you should also remember that three years before ,
the Federal Assimilative Crimes Act had been enacted, in
1948, which made State crimes punishable as federal crimes

when committed inside federal enclaves, whether exclusive
or concurrent jurisdiction, and subsequently all State liquor

31

laws were then, as they are now, enforcible by criminal
prosecution.
But no mention of those laws was made by Cole or
by Bryson or anyone else when this 1951 federal regulation
was passed.
Now, whatever else Congress may have nieant to do
by that '51 law, it certainly didn't intend to r.iake military
bases havens for bootleggers.
I use the term "bootlegger" because since the 21st
Amendment tha~•s the word that describes the activities of
people who sell liquor without payment of taxes, State or
Federal.
Now, the Defense Department itself construed this
law that I just described as not requiring avoidance of
State regulations in sales to military bases, when it
amended its own regulation in June 1966.

That was just before

Mississippi's regulation becarne effective.
The federal amendment struck out the requirement
that the base purchases be made, quote, "without regard to
prices locally established by State statutes or otherwise . "
And it continued to enforce its requirement that its own
sales of package liquor be priced, and I quote again, "within
ten percent of the lowest prevailing rates of civilian
outlets in the area.•
I think it' s quite clear on the face of the

32
regulations themselves and the statutes, there is no genuine
conflict between federal and Mississippi liquor control
policies, as they are expressed in their respective laws and
regulations,

and those policies, in both cases.

QUESTION:
1966?

Mr, Wright, what was the situation before

I understand until 1966 Mississippi was simply a bone

dry State.
MR. WRIGHT:
QUESTION:

Mn, HRIGHT1

In theory but not in fact.
Well, but in law it was.
There was a prohibition in the law.

QUESTION: But in law it was, am I right in that?
MR, WRIGHT1

In law, it was a dry State.

QUESTION: And was liquor sold on all of these
military bases?
MR, WRIGHT:

That I can't tell you about. The

stipulation doesn't cover the pre-1966 activities.

I would

suspect it was being freely sold in country clubs, I would
suspect the military clubs also bought it and sold it.
But I don't
QUESTION:
1-IR. l·1RIGHT:

The stipulation doesn't show?
It's simply not part of the record that

you have here. ·
QUESTION: Well, I wondered what the situation was ,
because it might bear on the problems , at least as far as some
of these bases are not wholly federal enclaves ,

••

33

MR. WRIGHT:

Well, they are all federal enclaves.

The difference between them is the two -- they claim that
the grant was exclusive jurisdictioni and the other two -QUESTION:
MR.

Yes, that's what I moan.

WRIGHT:

concurrent.

But in either event,

you understand these cessions of the basesthat were made
from '42 to

•so.

QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. WRIGHT: This was while Mississippi was dry.
QUE&TION: Was dry.
MR. t·IRIGHT:

But after the 21st J\mendment was

passed, Mississippi's right to regulate, to tax, or
eotablish a markup, or do anything else with respect to
controlling liquor in Mississippi stems from the 21st
Amendment.
QUESTION1
MR. WRIGHT:

The 21st amendment and -That militated exemptions •

QUESTION: And until 1966 Mississippi chose to
exercise its power under the 21st Amendment by having
absolute prohibition.
MR. WRIGllT:
QUESTION:

Right,

And that's --

I wondered what the situation was on

these bases during that period with respect to the sale of
liquor, either by the drink or by the bottle.
MR, WRIGHT:

I can't tell you, but I would suspect

34

that there was liquor on the bases, as there was nearly
everywhere else in Mississippi, on an illegal basis.
QUESTION:
view of the power?

But to lay aside the fact, what is your
Could Mississippi have prohibited liquor

on a military enclave?
MR. WRIGHT,

I think it's a more difficult question

than the one we have here, because I think it's clear that
when you have a State trying to control what happens on the
base , conduct on the base, you have an entirely different
question than you do when all the State wants to do is to
control the distribution of liquor to the base, which is what
you have in the case here,

And this was also involved in

the Yosemite case,
But this brings me to what I think are the two
decisive cases of this Court in this area,

Assuming that

you do believe there is a conflict between Federal and State
policy, which I don't think can really be found on the
statutes
QUESTION!

Well, I know, but on that point it

seems to me that that regulation you talked about is permissive,
I mean it didn't any longer require the military to seek the
lowest price or to buy as cheaply as possible.
MR, WRIGHT:

It never did require them to seek the

lowest price,
QUESTION: But I don't know how you can say there

35

isn't a conflict when the United States is now asserting the
right to buy liquor free of any State-imposed markups.
MR,

WRIGHT:

This suit created a conflict,

unquestionably, but -QUESTION:

Well, all right, but there is now --

MR. WRIGHT:

-- what I'm talking about is if you

lay the Federal policy side by side with the State policy,
as expressed in the laws and regulations of each, -QUESTION,

Well, it would be nice if you could just

say to the Unj.ted States,

Awfully sorry, we just won't

entertain your lawsuit, because you just shouldn't have
brought your lawsuit.
I mean, that's all you're suggesting.
MR. WRIGHT:

Well, even if you regard it, a

conflict is present, I think your decisions, the Court's
decisions in Ohio v. Helverin~ and in Collins v. Yosemite Park,
decide this case in favor of Mississippi.
Now, in 1934, Ohio's Attorney General thought the
morale of Ohio citizens would be improved if payment of
Federal excise taxes on the State's liquor sales could be
avoided.

Now, following the 21st Amendment, Ohio preempted

for itself the business of both retailing and wholesaling
liquor within the State.
Ohio argued that since it had gone into the
liquor business itself ,

as both t he controller and a revenue

36

measure, the sale of liquor in Ohio was a sovereign function
that could not be impaired by federal action; and they claimed
that the federal excise tax was such an unconstitutional
impairment, because it did enormously increase the prices
that the State had to pay for the liquor it sold.
Now, this Court's response to Ohio's argument was
refusal to allow Ohio to file a complaint.

The opinion

simply observed that while Ohio could enter the liquor
business as a State monopoly, it could only do so subject
to normal, non-discriminatory business taxation.
And all you have here is normal impooition of a
markup, which is discriminatory only in favor of the clubs,
because when the markup is applied to military sales all
taxes are waived, but when applied to the private clubs the
excise tax has to be paid, which gives them a much higher
per-case price.
Now, four years later, in the Yosemite Park case,
a liquor selling concessionnaire of the Park Service tried to
avoid the payment of the California excuse tax on his
liquor sales , it couldn't do it.

Now, he argued that he was

an agent of the Federal Government operating in an enclave
where the United states had exclusive jurisdiction.
This Court held that the concessionnaire did not have
to take out a retailer' s permit or pay California ' s tax on
retailers.

And Mississippi is not attempting t o force these

37

clubs, either, to take out retailer's permits or pay that
retailer's tax.
The Court also held, however, that the Yosemite Park
concessionnaire did have to pay California's excise tax levied
on all liquor sold, quote, "within the State", end quote.
Because "within the State" meant anywhere within the State's
boundaries, whether on a federal enclave or elsewhere.
Now, the Court noted that California had reserved
taxing power when the park was ceded to the government in
1919,

But th~t doesn't explain the distinction it drew

between the retailer's tax and the excise ta~.
California has treated that 1938 decision as
authorizing application of its excise tax to all liquor sales
to military bases within the State,

J\nd the United States

has never challenged that conecruction.

California gives

liquor wholesalers no excise tax exemption on sales made to
non-appropriated fund agencies selling liquor on military
bases.
QUESTION: Well, Mr. Wright, your analysis of the
Yosemite case would seem to equate the concessionnaire with
an instrumentality, does it not?
MR, WRIGHT:

Yes, I think he clearly was an agent

of the Park Service,
QUESTION:

And you make no distinction on the other

factors in Yosemite, about the consent of the --

38

MR. WRIGHT:

Uo, I think clearly if there's a

constitutional prohibition against California's taxing sales
of liquor in to a federal enclave, then nothing California
could do, by its statutes, would give it the right to do it.
QUESTION: Well, the United States could consent to
California's doing it, could it not?
WRIGHT: Well, I think it was held, as to that

MR.

point,

-QUESTION1

Well, answer my question, Mr. Wright:

'

could it?
MR.

WRIGHT:

QUESTION:
MR,

And did it not?

WRIGHT:

QUESTION:
MR.

They could.

In that case it did, yes.
Yes .

WRIGHT: All I'm saying is that since that time

California has enacted legislation which applies its tax
not only to sales to non-appropriated fund instrumentalities,
at all the bases in the State, witho\1t regard to the terms of
cession or without regard to what taxing rights, if any,
were reserved when the place was ceded,

And that California

also gives no excise tax exemption to distillers outside the
State who sell direct to military installations, where
payment is made on the Federal Treasury,
And the
to do that.

u. s.

has never attacked Cal ifornia' s right

39

Now, in 1947 a distiller did litigate the matter,
however, National Distillers tried to avoid payment of the
tax on the sale of 41,000 quarts of bonded whiskey that had
been bought for medicinal purposes, and it was sent to the
Army Medical Depot in Los Angeles .
Now, that whiskey was ordered out of St. Louis and
shipped to Los Angeles from Ohio.

And the distiller argued

that tl1e application of the California excise tax to that
shipment cast an unconstitutional burden on federal functions
because the tc1,x was included in the price the 11.rmy paid,
Now, California Appellate Court rejected the
distiller's argument and sustained the tax.

That case is

cited at page 17 of our brief, in footnote 12.
Now, the u.s. could have intervened in that case,
and carried it to this Court on the constitutional issue,
but it didn't.

What it's doing now is asking you to overturn

a construction of that 1938 decision in Yosemite Park that
was regarded as settled until this case was brought against
Mississippi,
Now, if there is any sound policy reason for doing
that, I haven't heard it expressed in the government's argument or seen it in its brief,
Thank you.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER1

Thank you.

Does the government have anything further?

40

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. JEWELS. LAFONTANT,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MRS. LAFONTANT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

--

At this time I would like to waive my right to rebut

QUESTIONt

Mrs. Lafontant, let me ask you one

question, if I may, before you waive.
It seems to me at least possible that a distiller
is either an indispensable party or perhaps the only party
'

here who can raise this type of an issue.

The government has

made these payments to the distiller, the distillers aren't
a public body which you ordinarily pay under protest, the
distiller has in turn remitted them, the payments to the
State of Mississippi.
Don't you think that perhaps the distillers ought
to be parties in order that these issues you've brought can
be properly raised and adjudicated?
MRS. LAFONTANT1

I see no reason or any real

necessity for the distillers being made party plaintiff to
this case.

The United States Government is attacking the

whole regulation, and the United States is certainly the
purchaser, the real party in interest , because he has to pay
the money, the distiller is just the conduit passing it on,
and it's expressly stated that way.
I don't think it would detract from the case ,

41

however, if the distillers were made party plaintiff.

But

I don't feel that there would be a necessity for it.
QtJESTION1

Could I ask you, coudn't Mississippi

just si111ply have a law that required all distillers who sell
in Mississippi to charge everybody, all of its customers, a
certain price?
MRS.

A certain price.

I would agree

that Mississippi could do that.

MRS. LAFONT1\NT1
