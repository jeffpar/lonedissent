ORAL ARGUMENT OF
RICHARD B. STONE, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

STONE:

ryou, Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
Ur:is cas:

sr-ich

here on a somewhat unusual writ

of certa orari to the United States Court of Customs and
Patent Appeals raises the question whether Respondents are
entitled to a patent on the method which they have devised

for

rical information expressed in one form

of mather.atj. al language into another mathematical language,
both of which languages are used extensively in!-general
purpose digital computers.
Q

Well, must they not have the digital computer

as part of this combination in order to make the whole thing
meaningful or is this part of this combination In order tc
make the whole thing meaningful?

If the formula — the process

stands alone, It is not very meaningful, Is it?

MR, STONE:

No, that is precisely our contention,

Mr. Chief Justice, is that what the Respondents have claimed

our arguments Mr.

That

Is the basic thrust of

Chief Justice.

The underlying mathematical technology;" involved in
Respondents’ elai

expressed at great length in our brief

and in Respondents * brief and , though there is some difference
in emphasis, I think there is little, if any, significant
difference between the Government and Respondents with respect
to the technological nature of the claim discovery.

•

Furthermore, though, the technical background set
forth in our brief, I believe, would

help to place

Respondents’ claim in its proper context.

The technology

necessary to an understanding of the legal issue in this
case is, I think, simpler than it may appear and I will
brief describe here exactly what it is that Respondents wish

5
to patent.
A computer is v.

-.' vice which solves problems

numerical information or other kinds of data
which can be broken down by logic into
.

numerical form.

By

sr in operation today is

the digital computer which, as its name implies, operates on
information and data expressed.In numerical digits.
.1/ on of the computer is quite simple.
After a problem

rr be a broken down into the mathematical

steps necessary to solve that problem, the computer computes
tie solution by actually doing the arithmetic; though it is
at; enorr •

ate and complicated and sophisticated

device, the modern computer itself is really an extension in
principle of the old adding machine or calculator.

Its

utility lies in its ability to perform in minutes or even in
seconds, calculations which would require years to perform
by hand.
Although the computer represents digits and numbers
in physical form such as, for example9 by a series of
electrical

pulses, the mathematical processes which the

computer performs are the same which a human would perform
except that they are expressed by mean3 of the physical
symbols built into the computer which uses eleotrical signals
for example in a manner similar to the way in which we use
pencil and paper.

6
Thuss the machine is built with the capacity to
carry out a wide variety of arithmetical calculations but
though tk:-i machine is built to do the arithmetic it is told
to do3 the machine can't think.
i.

It cannot solve the problem

•;> the operator breaks that problem down into a series of

ma -nematical or logical steps for the computer to carry out*
This series of mat he.- -at i cal steps is the computer's instruction
or, as it is popularly known in the trade, a "program."
Though some computers are built to carry out a.
particular program,, obviously the greatest utility is in
general purpose computers which are built to perform a

wide

variety of programs, requiring only that the problems be
broken down into logical mathematical steps and translated
into a language that is compatible with the internal physical
characteristics of the computer.
This brings us to the precise subject of Respondents'
claim.

In the g2?eat majority of general purpose .digital

computers, the simplest and.most convenient means of
physically representing numbers ia in switchlike alternatives,
;

• vi>**•

such as the presence or absence of an electrical signal or
pulse,

for example — analagous in perhaps more understandable

terms to the on and off of a light bulb.
For thi3 reason, data used within a digital computer
is ordinarily recorded, not by means of our decimal number
system, but instead by means of the binary number system,

7
which expresses numbers in terms of only two characters,
0 and 1, which can be easily correlated to' the presence or
absence of an electrical pulse, the on and off of a light
bulb, and which is based on powers of the number 2 rather
than pov?ers of the number 10, like our decimal number system.
These two characters, as I say, are easily
represented In the computer, for example, by the on and off
of an electrical impulse.
Now, the numbers that we deal with in our daily
lives are ordinarily

in decimal form.

Therefore, much of the

data which we feed into computers has to be converted from
the decimal number system to the binary number system.

An

intermediate step of this conversion process is the binary
coded decimal number system which is a combination of binary
and decimal numbers in that it expresses the ordinary decimal
digits in binary numerals and arranges them in the order of
the decimal number system.
Thus the number 53, for example, would consist of
the binary representation of 5 in the left-hand place and the
binary representation of

3 in the left-hand place, and it is

frequently desirable to convert binary-coded decimal numbers
to pure binary form.
Respondents have discovered a mathematical relation­
ship between binary-coded decimal numbers and pure binary
numbers.

They have translated

this mathematical relationship

8
or theorum into a mathematical procedure for performing the
conversion of binary-coded decimal numbers to binary numbers.
What they are claiming — and. their claims are set forth in
pages three and. four of our brief and in numerous other places
in the record, is an algorithm, which the dictionary defines
as any procedure for solving a given type of mathematical
problem.
The basic step in Respondents algorithm, as we show
in the Appendix to our reply brief and in the Appendix to our
petition, is the repeated multiplication in binary, according
to the rules of binary, by the decimal number 10.

Their claim

would, if granted, give them a monopoly over any computer
program based on this mathematical relationship which they
have discovered.

Though what they claim is not exactly a

computer program itself, it is a generalized formulation for
programs which solve the mathematical problem of converting
from one form of numerical representation, binary-coded
decimal, to another form of numerical representation, that is,
»

> .

,

pure binary.
Now, let us deal with precisely what it is that the
Patent Office and its Board of Appeals found wrong with the
Respondents claim.

The patent law defines patentability

essentially in two aspects.

First, the statute sets forth,
>

at 35U3C101 what constitutes patentable subject matter.
io, what types of of invention are patentable.

That

9
Then there are other provisions, notably 35USC102
and 103s which set forth conditions for the patentability
of otherwise qualified subject matter which are essentially
that the invention be. new, that it be useful, and that it be
nonobvious.
The Patent Office did not deal here with the issue
of whether the algorithm claimed by the Respondents is new,
useful and nonobvious because it found that Respondents, in
any event, were claiming a patent on nonpatentable subject
matter.
Under 35USC1Q1, a patentable invention must be a
"process,machine, manufacture or composition of matter."

It

is a fundamental axiom of the patent law, originating in the
writings of Thomas Jefferson and repeated In perhaps the most
consistent theme throughout the patent decisions of this
Court that ideas including scientific principles or mathev »--- ^

matieal formulas, mental processes and other abstract
intellectual concepts, are not patentable, only machines,
manufactures, compositions of matter or processes.
How, how exactly does Respondents claim for an
algorithm

for converting binary-coded decimal numbers into

binary numbers fit into this fundamental distinction between
a non-patentable abstract mental procedure and a patentable
process machine,manufacture or composition of matter?
Clearly, their mathematical proceudre is not a

10
machines manufacture or composition, as those three are all
tangible products or substances.

The only question, then, is

whether their claimed Invention is a "process" within the
meaning of 35USC1Q1 and, therefore, the starting point of this
inquiry is, what is the distinction between an abstract
principle or mental procedure and a patentable process?
The statute merely defines the process at 35USC100
to include "process, art or method," which brings in the
old terminology historically used as synonymous with the word
>

• -

■»'

"process."
Obviously, there is no sharp line between these
two concepts.

Indeed, every process, and I suppose every

tangible product such as a machine or a manufactured article,
embodies and can be explained at some level in terms of
abstract principles.

But in the case of machines or other

tangible products, the patent is not granted on the idea but
on the tangible object itself, so that the ideas themselves
• ■

*

■

are not monopolised except in the limited tangible form in
which they ares embodied in the machine or manufactured product.
In what circumstances„ then, may patents be granted
on processes?

In other words, where have the decided cases

drawn the line between idea3 and patentable processes?
There are essentially two lines of cases which I
believe cover virtually all process patents that have been
granted.

First, the Patent Office ha3 granted, and this Court

11
has validated;, patents on processes which Involve the chemical
or physical transformation of tangible substances, such as,
for example, the processes for the vulcanization of rubber,
the conversion of fat into soap or the grinding of flour as
it is used in the seminal case of Cochrane and Efeener .

These

cases — and many of these are cited at pages six to seven of
our reply brief — consistently emphasize the Court’s con­
ception of a patentable process as a series of acts to be
performed on a tangible substance to change its physical
■5

properties in some way.

And that concept is expressly

articulated in the leading decision of Cochrane and Dsener
at 94US.
The rationale of.these decisions is that when a
process deals with the transformation of specific substances,
by specific physical acts, a patent on that process has a
finiteness, a foreseeability 'of scope, and a tangible qualtly
that distinguishes it from a patent on a pure idea.
The other line of eases which must be considered
here in the context of process patents are those 19th century
landmark casses in which process patents were granted to
Mr. Morse in connection Vfith his

invention of the telegraph

and to Mr. Bell in connection with his invention of the
telephone.
The inventions claimed in these cases were series of
stops performed on electric currents to produce physical

12
reactions, in one case to print letters at a distance and in
one case to produce sound at a distance.
In our view, these cases are really analogous to
cases such as Cochrane and Dsener, which involved the physical
transformation of substances because the inventive element in
these cases was in the physical manipulation of electric
signals.
In our case, by contrasts electricity is really an
arbitrary means or symbol by which numbers in mathematical
operations are physically

represented.

The inventive element

in Respondents claim is not in the physical manipulation of
•' ;•

•

y.X.;\

electricity, but rather in the mathematical steps which the
• ‘-v

computer carries out under Respondents’ instructions with the
'physical symbols that are already built into the computer.
But even assuming that the Morse and Telephone
cases were analagous to our case and avoiding a metaphysical

pulses, these cases granted claims only on those processes

end-use and this is discussed at great length in our brief.

granted a patent on his first claim, which was so limited
and the court granted Mr. Bell’s claims on processes carried

13
out by means of the two specific aparatuses which he des­
cribed.

For in these cases, as in the cases such as Cochrane

and. Dgener which patented processes for transforming physical
and chemical substances, any monopoly that might have been
granted on the underlying scientific principles was limited
by reference to tangible apparatus.
And now, finally, what is it that Respondents claim
here as a patentable process?
Respondents have discovered a relationship between
binary-coded decimal numbers and pure binary numbers that
enables them to convert from one numerical language to
another by repeated multiplication according to the rules of
binary multiplication by the decimal number 10 which is
expressed in binary form as 1010.
The algorithm which they set forth in their

claim

merely translates into the language of computer programs a
set of multiplications and additions by the binary equivalent

of 10.

Though there Is no time here to explain in detail
V., ...

why Respondents’ discovery is no more than a procedure
involving multiplication by binary 1010, the Court need not
accept this conclusion on faith, for it Is fully developed in
the Appendix to our reply brief where we analyze Respondents'
claims step by step.
Though Respondents have illustrated their claim at
great length with complicated explanations and diagrams and

Ik
charts, they have not contradicted our analysis of the
mat eraatical procedure that they claim, nor have they denied
that the algorithm described in their claim merely translates
their mathematical discovery into the language of computer
programming.
When the operator tells the computer to add, he
uses words like "shifting," "masking," and "storing»"

These

words do not change the mathematical theorum that Respondents
have discovered into a patentable process any more than one
changes two plus three into a patentable process by calling it
deux et trois or translating it into some other foreign
language,
Q

Mr. Stone, don’t they at least, though, limit

the scope of the path to the computer field?
MR. STONE:

Mr. Justice Rehnqulst, it is not

entirely clear whether their claim is limited to operation in
the computer field because the only words In that *— in one of
their claims they refer to shifting and a shift register, and
that is a word which is probably related to at least general
purpose digital computers.
reference.

Their claim 13 has no such limiting

I suppose their — In practicality, their claim

is likely to be carried out primarily on digital computers
because the computations are very elaborate, but even if that
is the case, we believe that a general purpose digital
computer is a trivial limitation on the claim because it is

15
really no more than an extension of an adding machine or
calculator.

It is no more than the most advanced device we

have for calculating extensive mathematical calculations that
take up too much time to be done with pencil and paper but
as a matter of fact, the Patent Office felt that Respondents'
claim could be carried out by means of pencil and paper.
Q

Wouldn't you agree with the earlier question of

the Chief Justice that outside of the computer field there is
simply no utility to the thing?
MR. STONE:

I would agree that outside of the com­

puter field, that there is no general utility known right now
for this process other than carrying out calculations on a
computer, but that is such an — data processing itself is
such an abstract science and it is really a — it is the
science of finding answers to mathematical problems and it is
inherently — the information that is fed into :a- data pro­
cessor is inherently nonpatentable in the most extreme sense
in which vre don’t allow patents on scientific and mathematical
ideas.
Q

Is the computer itself patentable?

MR. STONE:

Yes, the computer itself is certainly

patentable and had Respondent claimed a computer for carrying
out this process which was new and useful and nonobvious,
they certainly could have been given a patent.

But what they

We 1.1 s assume there hadn't been any computers

until they Invented one to make this conversion?
MR. STONE:

Well, I suppose they could have — if

they had invented a computer they could certainly have
claimed a computer.
Q

You Just think they haven't claimed a computer?

MR. STONE:

They haven't claimed a computer because

they haven't invented a computer.
Q

All they —

Assume if there hadn't been any computers and

they invented a computer to carry out this process and that
was applicable, why isn't this —
MR. STONE:
Q

No ~

— against, the background of existing computers,

why isn't this a new use of an old machine?
MR. STONE:

That is very simple, Mr. Justice White.

It is not a new use of an old machine because a computer is
built to carry out all the calculations which this program
calls for being carried out.
Q

Well, it is doing something it never did before.

MR. STONE:

No more than an adding machine is doing

something it never did before when it adds a series of numbers
that it ha3 never added before.
Q

Well, until this process was discovered,

computers had never done this particular operation, had they?
MR, STONE:

(No response.)

17
Q

Until this came along, the computer had never

done this*
MR. STONE:

Well, Mr. Justice White, the analogy

which we use in our brief

and I think that this is the

appropriate analogy — is an old player piano which carries
out

which plays songs when piano rolls are inserted into it.

We do not believe that the computer acquires a new function
every time :Lt carries out new calculations that it is
Inherently built to perform, any more than a player piano
carries out a new function or acquires a new use every time
a new piano roll is inserted into it.
That is precisely the heart of our case.
computer and the machine are one thing.

The

Many of the

aspects

of the computer and the machinery are patentable but the
computer is built to carry out, through physical symbols and
into electricity and other devices, all the calculations which
j

this Respondent has told it to carry out.

It doesn’t —

of these calculations.
and designed to do.

That is exactly what it is built

It is the same machine even though it

is playing different music or carrying out different cal­
culations exactly tha same way that an adding machine is the
same machine when it says 3 plus 3 as when it says 3 plus 2.
Q

Well, you certainly do reduce programs to

a nothing,
MR, STONE:
Q

I don’t reduce them —

They don’t add a thing to the computer,

MR. STONE:

I don’t reduce them to nothing.

The

underlying mathematical discoveries that are involved with
them may be extremely ingenious and extremely important and
extremely useful, but they don’t add anything to a computer.
They are mathematical calculations which the computer is
already there to carry out.
indeed, if Respondent had invented the Pythagoran
Theorum and the Pythagoran Theorum were complicated enough
so that it could ,.only be carried out on a computer, I don't
think think you would say that Respondent was entitled feo a
patent on the Pythagoran Theorum

merely because it was

likely to be carried out on a computer or that the computer
acquired a new function in carrying out the Pythagoran
Theorum that it does not have when it, say, is computing the
area of a circle

19

Mr. Stone3 when scientists and. physicians and

researchers have put toghether known substances which perform a
totally new function

— that Is, it will open up or close up

a particular valve in the heart, for example — it may be a

MR. STONE:

the necessary qualifications, Mr. Chief Justice.

That is,

Q

What are they giving the patent on?

The

substances or the intellectual concept?
MR. STONE:

They are giving a patent — assuming

that they asked —• that the device itself that they asked for
a

patent on — they are given a patent on the device.
Q

Well, the device is the sum total of the end

\

I

substance that is the medicine which produces this result.
MR. STONE:
Q

Well, the —

These are all known substances, aren’t they?

MR. STONE:

Yes, and there are cases — If all they

have discovered is that certain substances, in combination,
produce a certain result, it may

be that they don't get a

patent because a number of cases such as the Funk Brothers
case, 333US and the Armour case at 3$6Fed 2nd, Armour vs.
Richardson Merrill have made the point quite forcefully that
the mere discovery that a combination is useful is not

20
patentable of itself unless there is some element of invention
in putting that combination together or some synergistic
relationship between the substances that make for an invention
other than the pure invention of the mathematical or
scientific principle.
But our point in this case is the only element of
invention in Respondents1 claim, the only element of
invention in this algorithm is the mathematical invention and
the mathematical theorum Itself,

There is no element of

invention whatsoever that takes places subsequent to the
discovery of this mathematical process and therefore it is not
in the useful arts and not patentable subject matter.
We have touched upon these subjects already in the
questioning, but Respondents basically describe their
mathematical procedure as a machine process and take a number
of other steps to describe their claims in ways that make it
look like more than pure mathematics.
One, which we have already touched upon in
questioning by Mr. Justice White, is that they imply

that it

is a machine process rather than a mathematical process
because it is, in effect, it creates a new use for the
machine.
As I have said, these instructions which Respondent
has devised really contribute nothing to the operation of this
machine because the computer was always able to carry out

21
these steps before the program that the Respondents invented
was ever devised.

The Respondents have never denied this and,

indeed, they admitted it in the court below when they stated
in their brief that all of the recited signal manipulations
are conventional operations which are performed by conventional
electronic apparatus.
They also allege that the steps which they set forth
are not strictly mathematical but are machine steps because
they are carried out by means of electricity in the machine.
As we have said, the inventive element in Respondents claim
is entirely mathematical and has nothing to do with
electricity.

Respondents have not invented the technique for

carrying out their calculations on a machine.

That was done

by the inventor of the digital computer.
Indeed, virtually everything that Respondents
claim as inventable other than mathematics and as patentable
other than mathematics in this law suit was invented by the
Inventor of the digital computer and not by Respondents.
Electricity, as 1 said, is merely the writing
medium which the computer uses to perform the mathematical
steps that Respondents have devised and it no more imports
patentability to Respondents' theorum to translate it into a
computer algorithm or program any more than it vrould import
patentability to the equation A equals pi R squared, trans­
lated into a computer algorithm for determining the area of

22
a circle»
Respondents also attempt to make a patentable process
out of their theorurn by referring repeatedly in their brief
to the special private exchange telephone system, called the
"PBXU which includes a digital computer apparatus that
Respondents allege their algorithm is
accommodate.

especially designed to

They seem to imply that they are claiming a

patent on this mathematical procedure only as it is used in
this PBX device, if, indeed, they are not implying that their
claim is in some way analagous to a claim on the PBX itself.
The fact is that their claim makes no reference
whatsoever to the PBX device or, indeed, to any other device,
In its broadest sense it can be read, perhaps, ,to refer to
operation on a. digital computer but we do not believe that
that limitation would give Respondents’ invention tangibility
any more than no limitation at all, because if they have a
monopoly on this procedure as carried out on the digital
computer, they have, in effect, a monopoly on the theorum
• *

itself.
The thrust of our argument is that there is no
invention in this process other than a mathematical invention.
Their Invention adds nothing to the digital computer except
in the sense that it gives the digital computer another
operation to carry out which the digital computer is built to
carry out inherently and vfhich really amounts to no more than

23
the normal Inherent operation of that digital computer.

For

this reason we believe the decision below should be reversed.
I will save ray remaining time for rebuttal.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Stone.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF
HUGH B,

COX, ESQ., ON BEHALF OF
•THE RESPONDENTS

MR. COX:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court:
In our view, the question presented here is whether
a method for converting electrical signals in an electrical
)

data processing machine that signals that represent binarycoded decimal numbers into pure binary numbers is a patentable
invention under Section 101 of the Statute.
The only issues seems to be an issue of subject
matter.

The claims were not rejected In the Patent Office

on any grounds of utility, novelty, or obviousness and those
points v?eren?t raised or decided in the court below.

As

I

understood the argument for Counsel for the Commissioner
this morning, he is not raising those points in this court.
So that I submit that the question of subject matter
has to be considered on the assumption that these claims are
useful, novel and nonobvious.
Now, I should like to begin by saying a word about

2 ii

the background and nature of this invention.

The Respondents

here made the invention because they were working on what was
essentially a machine problem and they solved the problem by
inventing a machine method.

They were working on a PBX.

Now, a PBX, as I assume every member of the —
everyone knows, is a switching device that connects a group of
telephones one with the other and also connects those
telephones with outside telephones.

It is used in a hotel,

for example, to connect all phones in the hotel and those
phones with outside phones and is used the same way in an
office.
Now,

one

of the elements of this switching device

was a control unit which was a kind of digital computer.

It

received electrical impulses from the telephone making the
call*

By electrical impulses it identified the-telephone that

was being called and then it connected the two telephones.
Now, to carry out this function, it was necessary
in that control unit to convert binary-coded decimal numbers,
V * '

B, C, D numbers, into pure binary numbers.
When the Respondents were working on this problem,
there were quite a number of known ways of converting these
B,C,D numbers into binary numbers but all these ways were
unsatisfactory simply because of the physical limitations of
the computer with which the Respondents were working.

Some

of the methods required storage of — in the computer — of

25
elaborate tables of conversion of values and then circuits to
do what is called "multi-digit adding."

Some of them

required other special circuits to perform special functions.
Now, the computer that the Respondents were working
with did not have storage capacity.
digit adding circuits.
circuits.

It didn't have multi-

It didn't have these other special

So their problem was to find a mtehod of

converting B,C,D numbers into binary numbers that was to be
consistent and"feasible and efficient within the terms of the
physical limitations of this computer they were workiiig with.
They discovered such a method.

Now, we have

described the method in our brief and in the Appendix to our
brief.

Briefly, I simply will say this:

It consists of

processing a B„C,D number in a series of repetitive cycles
and you do thi3 to the electrical impulses in the machine.
In each cycle an electrical impulse is detected, discovered,
by another electrical impulse.

It is cancelled and then tv/o

electrical impulses are Inserted In predesignated places in
the original sequence of impulses that you are converting
and when you have done that for each signal in the B,C,D
series of signals under this process, you then obtain a series
of signals which are the representational value that is
equivalent in binary to the representational value in B,C,D
with which you started.
Now, in discovering and in inventing this method.

26
the Respondents detected that there was a mathematical
relationship that would be useful.

And I emphasise that

because the important thing here is a recognition that this
relationship, this mathematical relationship could he useful
in devising a machine method that would solve their problem
and by

as a result of that recognition they devised this

simple method

of carrying out this operation and it had

great advantages, of course, for them.

It made It possible for

this computer they were working with to do something that it
couldn't do before.

And it has advantages for any digital

computer, even though it has more elaborate equipment

than

the equipment in the computer with which they were working.
It reduces the number of signals and the amount of
circuitry you have to use and that reduces the possibility of
error thr-ough circuit malfunction which sometimes happens.

It

means that you don't have to use a lot of storage space in a
computer, even if you have it, which is often a convenience
necessary.
How, a3 I said, in the storage, it has advantages,
substantial synergistic advantages in any kind of a digital
computer.
Now, as I said, they were able to do — to make — to
devise this method because they — they recognized that this
mathematical relationship could be used to advantage in a
machine in converting these B,C,D signals -— these impulses

27
into the Impulses representing pure binary numbers.

mathematics.

But the

not on the

I want to emphasise that point because It is

a confusion that seems to me to run through the argument of
the Petitioner here.
There are two claims in this case.

They were both

rejected by the Patent Office on the ground, and the sole
ground, that they represented or were an attempt to claim
mental processes and mathematical steps.

The court below

reversed holding that they were claimed on a machine method
and we submit the court below is right.
We have discussed the language of those two claims
at great length in our brief,
discussion here.

i don’t propose to retread that

I will simply say this:

That I think there

really isn't any room for argument about claim eight.

No one

anything else from the terms that were used in thatclalm and
the Government Petitioner doesn’t really argue that there is
any doubt that that claim is confined to a method to be
practised on an electrical data processing machine, a
computer.
They make some arguments about claim 13.
those arguments are wrong.

We think

We think when the claim is read

as a whole and it context, it» too, like claim eight, simply
claims a method that is to be practiced on an electrical

20
data processing machine.

But whether there is merit in those

arguments or not, they donft apply to claim eight because
they depend upon language claim 13.

Claim eight stands upon

an independent basis.
*

Now, I should like now to examine the reasons that
the Petitioner here gives in saying that this machine method
is not covered, not patentable subject matter under Section 10
of the Statute.
1 don’t really think the Petitioner is relying in
any degree on the conventional patent law about mental steps.
He said this morning that a computer doesn’t think and I
suppose there is no doubt about that.

When this method is

practiced, it is a practice for manipulating electrical
signals and when the steps described in the claims are
taken, the signals are detected, blanked out, transferred,
inserted in other places.

It is a mechanical operation.

The rule against patenting mental steps is simply a
rule that you can't patent something that goes on in the mind
and the Respondents here have not attempted to do that.

MR. COX:

taking your words "in trouble" because I think that it would
raise some serious questions.

I think there is a rule and

probably a sensible rule that you cannot get a patent on
something that goes on simply in the mind,
Q

Well, if these applicants had simply stated

in their claims this method, this relationship, this way of
converting, you would agree it would not be patentable?
MR. COX:

I think there would be a serious question

there because I doubt whether they would have made a specific
application of it in the useful arts.
You see, there is a very old doctrine that I am
going to say something about in a moment.
Q

However, these would still be very useful.

I mean, there would be advantages.
MR, COX:

Yes, but the trouble with it, Mr. Justice

White, I think would — I am in the position of arguing rather
than on the other side of this, but the trouble would be that
unless you make a specific application of the thing of the
useful arts, then the claim may be so broad as to preclude any
use of the formula at all even for purposes, of speculation or
thought or something of that kind and I think that is one of
the bases of the old rule that you can’t patent a natural

MR. COX:

Well, they are claiming we are, but the

fact is that the claims — the claims —
Q

That's what this ease is all about.

MR. COX:

The claims simply do not extend that far

and, furthermore, the Government — the Government doesn’t
really want to win on the ground that the claims go too far.
What they want is a rule that would exclude all of these
programs and if there is any trouble about these claims,
claims could easily be drawn that would put it beyond the
doubt of even l?th century conveyancer that these claims
didn't extend to anything except the use of this method in

31
the machine.
Q

You claim this is a process, I take it?

MR. COX:
Q

It is a process and a machine process.

Under what part of the definition of process in

the statute do you think this falls?
MR. COX:

Well,there isn't any definition beyond

the word but it's — it is — you could say it is a process
for a new use of an old machine possibly although I really
.think that this point is developed* both in our brief and the
brief of

others, that when a thing like this Is used in a

computer, you so change the function of the computer that it
really becomes a new machine but I would say that this is a
process because it achieves by a result, a useful result by
a series of machine steps that have not heretofore been
achieved in this manner.

think you could, because the — the machine can change the
circuit — you change the circuitry in a sense, temporarily,
of course, if you had a permanently wired circuit that did
this, I think you could get a patent on it.

And, in fact, a

patent has been issued on —
Q

If the machine has not been changed, then all

I

32
you are doing is using the machine to carry out a mental
process.

If it is a new machine, why would you need a process

patent?
MR. COX:

Well, you need a process patent because

the very purpose of programs and the utility of programs, in
a sense the inventiveness of programs s lies in the fact that
it makes it possible to use a machine without changing the
circuitry.

You can change the machine without changing the

circuitry by changing the way the functions are performed.
And the point is that when you have a method, a process, that
does that, it seems to me to fall squarely within the
definitions of process as they have been laid down by the
decisions of this court.
Section 101 simply speaks — uses the word "process”
without trying to define It, but there is a definition, I
think, in 100 which says that — tries to give it a little
content but I think this might be an appropriate place for
me to say something about the piano roll analogy which was
brought into the argument a little while agos because the —
I think its precisely on this point that the piano roll
analogy breaks down.
When the program does make a difference in the
technological functioning of the machine it rearranges the
way the signals operate, the way the circuits operate so
that there is a difference of that kind.

Now, a piano roll

33
produces a different song,, but that is the only difference
between one piano roll and another

and of course, that kind

of value is not protected by the patent law.

It is an aesthe­

tic value so that I think the piano roll is more comparable to
the numbers, the data, that Is fed into a computer because a
piano roll doesn’t essentially change the function of what
the player piano does.

It produces a different tune, which

is not subject to patent protection at all.
But I want to emphasise

this point because I think

of the confusion that is involved, that these patent claims
do not attempt to claim the mathematics as such.

Anybody who

wants to practice this method ■— the mathematics

t-

not the

method, because the method is a series of machine, steps, but;

FIR. COX:

MR. COX:

Well, it — Mr. Justice White, the

-

/

3^

Respondents here have consistently taken the position with the
Patent Office all the way through that that is what claim 13
meant and in the Patent Office they offered and tried to
amend claim 13 to put in the words ’’electrical signals” to
make it absolutely clear and the Patent Office examiner
wouldn’t allow them to do it because, as far as I understand
what he said, he said it wouldn’t make any difference.
You see, the real point in this case is the point
that I think that v/as made this morning, a point that has no
sanction, I submit, in the decisions.

It is a notion that

you can’t get a patent here on these machine steps because the
machine, by mechanical means, is doing something that the
human mind could also do by using the same mathematics.
That is what the argument comes to.
And 1 submit that there is no Justification for it
and it is really inconsistent with the whole 150 years of
development under the patent laws because the essence of most
inventions is substituting — or many inventions -— is
substituting mechanical effort for human effort.

Of course,

by mental process you could do this conversion, but what the
Respondents here have done is to invent a — to devise a
method, a method for doing the machine which enhances the
operations of the machine and enables the machine to do
something more efficiently than could be done simply by other
methods

35
Now, to speak of this merely because the conversion
has certain has certain representational value , represents
symbolsa it means something for given conventional values in
a man’s —- men’s minds, does not, it seems to me, suggest
that there is any reason why it can’t be patented.
After all, communication depends upon the same
kind of conventions and when you talk over the telephone, the.
communication is sensible only because the words, by convention
have certain meanings to the person who listens to you and
that is true in this case as to these numbers.

They are

assigned, conventionally, certain symbolic significance but

i

it.doesn’t, it seems to me, have anything to do with the
question of whether the machine method for making these
computations is patentable.

It is not a mental process.

The claims don’t cover the mathematics as such.
monopolise the mathematics.

They don’t

It is simply a claim on a machine

method.
Now, the argument, I think, that this is an attempt
to patent a principle or a law of nature simply misconceives
the origins and the nature of that rule because when you read
the cases — and it is an old rule — you see that those
cases really stand for this.

They are cases that hold, in
<

the first place, a man cannot get a patent on a principle in
the general and the abstract, simply he must make a specific
application of the principle to the useful arts and,

36
furthermore, he cannot get a patent on some application that
he hasn’t invented.
Now, I submit that this -- these claims here satisfy
both tests.

The Respondents discovered this mathematical

relationship and, what is more important, determined it to
be useful in devising a machine method and the only tiling they
are claiming is a particular machine method that they
invented.

They are not claiming the principle except as it

is applied by these steps in a machine so they do not run
afoul of either aspect of the rule against patenting a general
principle.
There is, I submit, a kind of strained and
artificial quality about all of these arguments that are
made against the patentability of these claims.

They use

the conventional terms "the patent law" and the conventional

concepts, but wfoen you look at the arguments they do not —
those applications don’t — simply don’t apply.
reliance upon the Telephone case.

Take the

Now, if there is one thing

that is perfectly clear about the Telephone case, it is that
that case did not hold that a method patent had to be
confined to a use in a particular kind of apparatus.

What

that case held was that if you had a valid method claim* It
extended to the use of the method on any apparatus that was
used to practice the claim and, in fact* in that case, the
V
court upheld that claim, held that it was infringed by the

37
use of an apparatus that practiced the method, although it
was an apparatus that Mr. Bell had not described in his
patent and, as far as you

can tell from the record, had never

even dreamed of.
There is the limitations that the Petitioner says
must be put on a method claim of this kind are simply not
required by the cases and, indeed, in certain respects their
argument is pussling because in their brief, at least, they
seem to be more cautious in their oral argument.

They

suggested that maybe this patent would be all right if it had
been

confined to use in a PBX.
Well, now, that is really a strange suggestion

because the subject matter is the same, whether It is used
in a PBX or whether it is used in all computers.

It is no

more or no less a mathematical axiom or a principle in the
one case than it is in the other.
The point is that this is useful.

It is useful in

terms, not claimed in any terms of any other machine, but
claimed in terms of electrical data processing machines.
Now, all fo these arguments really seem to me to

they are directed to an end.

They are examples of the

Petitioner wants and what the Amici

What the

want, who are supporting

38
him* is a broad rule of law that will exclude from the Patent
Act, from the protection of the Patent Act, all computer
processes and programs.
And, indeed, they presented that case in those terms
and the Petition for Certiorari and I suppose that Is why the
’ '*

• I- ‘1

case is here, because this court will not ordinarily take
cases on certiorari, simply in the normal run of affairs,
simply to look at the circumstances affecting a particular
patent.
Therefore, X think X am obliged to say something
about the policy arguments that they advanced to support this
broad result.
How, the first thing I am going to say, I'm just —
I'm going to pass over it because we have developed it in our
brief.

We think it is inconsistent with both the spirit of

the patent law, the letter of the patent law and the 150 years
of decision to exclude a whole field of technology in this
way because the patent law has constantly been interpreted
and applied as extending to new fields of technology as they
come along if the Inventions meet the standards of the act.
Beyond that, I submit that these reasons, these
policy reasons which they advanced for the broad rule of law
that they acquire will not withstand examination if they are
viewed in relation to the Patent Act itself.

The Petitioner

or the Commissioner of Patents says that it will be

39
burdensome and. Inconvenient for him if he

has to search,

classify , examine patents In this field and I submit that is
hardly a good reason for denying patentability to a whole
area of patents.
work;
Act

Of course, it will involve some additional

any new technology does but the standards of the Patent
should not be bent or departed from for that reason and

I think the difficulties, in any event, are exaggerated for
the reasons set forth in our brief.
But that brings me to the other thing that I find
myself obliged to say something about which is the economic
reality that underlies this contest over whether these
processes should be patentable.
If you examine the briefs in this case, the brief
Amici, you will see that the patentability of these programs
is opposed by the group of hardware manufacturers.

They are

large companies whose business primarily is the manufacture
of the computers, although they also manufacture programs
called "software."

The patentability of the programs Is

supported by the companies which are engaged in the business
of software or of making, devising, Inventing computer programs
and processes.

These companies Eire for the most

as

compared with — the hardware industry is a concentrated
industry.

There are three or four companies in it and one of

them, IBM, has by far the largest share of the market.
software industry, on the other hand, is a diffused and

The

40

diversified Industry with a lot of companies in it, most of
them small.

They are precisely the kind of enterprises that

need the protection of patents in order to stimulate research
and invention, to raise capital to protect the time they spend
on developing these things which — and they are the source
from which you might reasonably expect invention would come
because the hardware manufacturers are far more interested in
their machinery and., sometimes, these programs cut down the use
of the machinery or they make simpler machinery feasible.

They

are far more interested In their machinery than they are in
the program so the patentability of these computer processes
and programs, 1 submit, will be consistent with the policy of
the patent lawbecause it will provide protection and
stimulation for invention from the very source which needs the
protection and from vrhich invention may reasonably be expected
to come.
So I submit, in conclusion, that vrhefcher you look at
this case in terms of the conventional standards of the Patent
Act as they have been developed in 150 years of decision, or
whether you go beyond that and look at it in terms of the
policy arguments that have been presented here, in either view
of the matter the decision of the court below should be
affirmed.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Mr. Stone

Thank you, Mr. Cox.

41
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF
RICHARD B. STONE, ESQ., ON BEHALF OF
THE PETITIONER
MR. STONE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

I think the essence of the conflict in this case
is reflected here in this oral argument as intensihly as it
can be and that is, that Respondents have attempted repeatedly
throughout their briefs and in their oral argument, to skirt
the fact that the invention which they have come up with and
which they claim in this case is an invention purely
mathematical in nature.
They have used repeatedly essentially two methods
to try to relate this invention to machinery on which
doubtless there are many possible and permlssable and
appropriate patents.
First, they have — as they did in their brief —
referred extensively to thi3 PBX telephone-switching system
which they allege that this patent was very specifically
designed to accommodate because of certain problems and
limitations of the PBX machinery itself.
Our response to this is quite clearly and simply
that their claim makes no mention whatsoever of the PBX
device.

It has nothing to do with — as far as we can

determine from the PBX device,

Granted, it would cover the

use of this mathematical procedure in any type of digital

computer and would certainly not be limited to the PBX.

Even

if it were limited to the PBX, the Patent Office would perhaps
hear arguments as to why there was some special synergistic
relationship between this program and the PBX device and if
Respondents could prove some synergistic relationship that
would import an element of invention that was beyond the
invention of their mathematical theorum, the Patent Office
might be presented with a different case.
We are highly doubtful, however, that Respondent's
could prove such a synergistic connection between this
algorithm and the PBX device and in

any event they have not
!•

;u" v

claimed any limitation whatsoever to the PBX device and we
are therefore unconcerned with the underlying motive for their
invention — for their discovery of this particular theorum.
Q

Well, Mr. Stone,did you say that an application

of the Government's theory here would not then require outright
rejection of the validity of the patent claim if it had been
limited to the PBX?
MR. STONE:

It would be at least be heard as factual?
Yes, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, the Patent

Office would certainly have heard the issue whether there was
some Invented element beyond the pure mathematical invention
or some synergistic relationship between the claimed
machine and the algorithm which would import patentability.
But that simply Is not present in thi3 case.
In addition, Respondents have repeatedly used the

43
word, "machine process”

which, I reiterate, brings up the

implication that what they — the mathematical steps which
they have asked this machine to carry out and instructed this
machine to carry out import a new function of some sort to
this machine and are related in some way to an invention on
the machinery itself.
There are — in one of the Ami.cus briefs — there is
given a list of and description of a number of important
theoretical discoveries involving mathematical steps used,
for example, to predict weather which are so complicated and
so long to carry out that they can only practically be done
on what is today known as a digital computer, our most
complex calculating device.
If Respondents are entitled to a machinery, to a
patent on — if Respondents are entitled to a patent on this
mathematical procedure, merely because it is most likely to
be carried out on a digital computer, then all of those
important mathematical discoveries as well as other important
mathematical discoveries which are likely because of their —
of the inherent length of their mathematical calculations to
be carried out on a digital computer, would be monopolized and
taken out of the realm of common usage even though they have
nothing inherently to do with machinery except that they

are

likely to be performed on machinery that has already been
invented and designed to carry out those mathematical steps.

44
Finally, Respondent -- excuse me
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr*. Stone, your time is

up, but did I understand you to say that if this had been
limited to the PBX or a single-purpose machine of soma kind,
that the Government's position would be different?
MR. STONE:
that.

No, Mr. Chief Justice, I have not said

All I have said is that if it had been limited to the

PBX, then it would have been appropriate, perhaps, to make an
inquiry as to whether there was some special relationship
between Respondents' discovery In the PBX which would import
an inventive element other than the mere mathematical
discovery to the claim and perhaps warrant a patentability.
All we say is that this might have been a different
case but that is not the case before us.
Finally, the competitive — the problems of the
competitive status of the software industry which Respondents
alluded to are indeed Important problems which of course, I
think it is a matter of public record, the Government i3
quit® concerned with.

Our view Is simply that the solution

to these competitive problems is not to grant undeserved
monopolies

on mathematical principles.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Cox.

Thank you.

Thank you, "Mr. Stone.

The case Is submitted.
