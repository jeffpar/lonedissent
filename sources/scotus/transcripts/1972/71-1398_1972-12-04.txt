MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear argument

first this morning in No. 71-1398, Warner against Flemings.
Mr. Solicitor General.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERWIN N. GRISWOLD, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GRISWOLD:

May it please the Court:

This case is a sequel to O9Callahan against Parker,
395 U.S.f and Relford against the Commandant in 401 U„S„,
involving court martial trials of servicemen.

It involves

the application of 08Callahan in determining when an offense
is service-connected, and it involves the question of whether
G6Callahan should he applied retroactively.
The case is here on the Government's petition for
a writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit.

I may say that the immediately following case is

here on the defendant's petition for certiorari from a
conflict decision of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth
Circuit on somewhat varying facts.

In this case, both courts

below have ruled in favor of the respondent.

The present

Court proceeding began in October, 1970, when the respondentfiled suit in the United States District Court for the
Eastern District of New York, relying on 0sCallahan and
seeking to compel the Secretary of the Navy to overturn the
respondent's 1944 conviction for auto theft and to correct

4
his military record insofar as it shows a dishonorable
discharge»
The answer filed in the district court on behalf
of the Secretary of the Navy recited the respondent's
conviction by court-martial on two charges, one of absence
without leave and the other of fact, the conviction being on
a plea of guilty to both charges»

And the record of the

court-martial was attached as an exhibit, and this appears
at pages 14 to 24 of the Appendix filed in this Court»
The case was tried on the pleadings and affidavits
which tend to show these facts»

In 1944 the respondent, who

was 18 years old at the time, was a seaman second class in
the United States Navy, stationed in New Jersey»
4, 1944, he received a pass for a fchree~day leave»

On August
This

expired on August 7th and he failed to return to his post.
Ten or eleven days later—and I use the two because it
appears one way one place in the record and another another
place in the record»
was stolen from

a

On August 17th or 18th an automobile
city street in Trenton, New Jersey.

This was owned by Ernest Bush who was in service in the
United States Signal Corps, though the automobile was his
personal property and not in any sense the property of the
Government»
Two days later, on August 20, 1944, which is 13 days
after his leave had expired, the respondent was apprehended

5
in Pennsylvania by the state police»
stolen car.»

He was then in the

He now says that he was a hitchhiking passenger,

but there is nothing in the record of the court-martial which
shows or even intimates this»

The state police turned the

respondent over to the naval authorities, and he was confined
in New York for trial.

He was then formally charged with

being absent from his duty station during wartime for a
period of 13 days and with the theft of an automobile, and
the charge reads "from the possession of a civilian" on
page 17 of the Appendix, while the United States was at war.
■A court-martial was held at the Brooklyn Naval Yard
in October, 1944.

The record of the court-martial shows that

the respondent was represented by counsel, Lieutenant
George B. Folly of the U. S„ Naval Reserve.

It does not

appear whether he was a lawyer or not.
The respondent pleaded guilty to both charges„

He

was sentenced to three years imprisonment, reduction in rank,
and a dishonorable discharge.

The sentence was served with

appropriate reduction of time, and he was dishonorably
discharged in October, 1946.

It is this court-martial

judgment and the resulting dishonorable discharge which the
respondent sought to set aside by the proceeding which he
brought in the district court below.
In the Re1ford case we contended that 06 Callahan
should not be applied retroactively so as to invalidate

6
court-martial decisions where the trial had been held before
O5Callahan was announced»

But the court did not find it

necessary to pass on that question.
We make the same contention here, and I shall also
contend at the close of my argument that the offense here was
service-connected even if the 0*Callahan case is otherwise
applicable.
Both courts below in deciding the retroactivity
question against the Government’s position relied on certain
passages in the 0°Callahan opinions»

1 used both the

majority opinion and Mr» Justice Harlan's dissenting opinion
in which the Court or members of the Court used jurisdic­
tional terminology»

This appears, for example

„

in the

opinion which is printed in the Appendix to the petition for
certiorari at pages 38 to 40, and there are frequent
references in the opinion to jurisdiction.
The courts below concluded that courts-martial do
not have jurisdiction of non-service connected crimes.

From

this they concluded that since there has been no formal
constitutional amendment on this subject, it must follow
that courts-martial never did have jurisdiction of non-service
connected crimes and if the court-martial in this case did
not have jurisdiction, its judgment and sentence are void
and should be corrected.

It all follows in the opinions

below with the inevitability of an iron-clad syllogism.

7
We suggest, that the error below comes from taking
the jurisdictional language used by the Court and by the
dissent in Q8Callahan with mechanical rigidity»

We suggest

that the question whether that decision should be applied
retroactively must be decided on the basis of the criteria
which this Court has generally invoked in determining the
temporal impact of the announcement of new constitutional
doctrines in other cases»
The automatic retroactive application of new
constitutional decisions is a conceptual mode of thought
widely accepted in the 19th century.

But this Court has

clearly rejected it in a number of cases.

These cases

recognise that constitutional doctrine evolves and is not
discovered.

What the Court has done is to show a candid

willingness to leave undisturbed decisions rendered in
conformity with prior constitutional pronouncements unless
substantial justice otherwise requires,

And I think that

this is in accord with a passage from then Chief Judge
Cardoso in his "Nature of the Judicial Process” where he
referred to the problem of the effect of overruling decisions,
and he said at page 148
Process":

of the "Nature of the Judicial

"Where the line of division will someday be

located I will make no attempt to say»

I feel assured,

howeverf that its location,, wherever it shall be, will be
governed not by metaphysical conceptions of the nature of

8
judge-made law, nor by the fetish of some implacable tenet
such as that of the division of governmental powers, but
by considerations of convenience, of utility, and of the
deepest sentiments of justice."
0"Callahan was in the most literal sense a clear
break with the past,, a phrase which the Court used in its
Desist opinion.

The fact that this marked departure from

generally accepted principles of military jurisprudence, the
fact that this was cast in jurisdictional terms, should not,
we submit, foreclose consideration under standard criteria
as to how 0*Callahan should apply to situations such as
presented here where the court-martial conviction became
final long ago.
What 03Callahan decided is that in the absence of
service connection, court-martial jurisdiction cannot be
exercised so as to take away the Fifth and Sixth Amendment
rights to indictment and trial by jury.

As this Court said

in Linkletter, whatever the jurisdictional implications of
the decision, the Constitution neither prohibits nor requires
that it be given retrospective effect.
Rather, the issue is, as in other retroactivity
cases, whether a new trial should be given to those already
tried„
The tests applicable in this problem were stated in
Stovall against Denno, and the relevant quotation is set forth

9
ok

page 18 of our brief;

the new principles;

" (a) the purpose to be served by

{b) the extent of the reliance by law

enforcement authorities on the prior law; and Cc) the effect
on the administration of justice of a retroactive application
of the new approach»”

All of these point to non-retroacfcive

application here»
The purpose of the new rule was to make applicable
the guarantees of indictment and jury trial in cases
involving non-service connected offenses»

These are

important guarantees, but they do not involve the integrity
of the truth-finding function, particularly in a case such
as hare, where the defendant has pleaded guilty»
This Court’s decision in DeStefano against Wood
involved jury trial»

But this Court held that its decisions

in Duncan and Bloom need not be applied retroactively»
This Court cannot have meant by its decision in
0cCallahan that all non-jury trials are inherently unfair»
Indeed, in the quotation from DeStefano set forth on page 20
of our brief, the Court said;

"We would not assert, however,

that every criminal trial—or any particular trial—held
before a judge alone is unfair or that a defendant may never
be as fairly treated by a judge as he would by a jury."
If O8Callahan meant that all jury trials were
unfair, then all court-martials would violate the Fifth
Amendment and this Court could not have decided Relford or

PeStefano as it dido
military offense»

Re1ford did not involve a strictly

It was the crime of rape committed on a

military reservation.

If there were indeed reservations

about the integrity of the military truth-determining
process at trials of the sort involved in Re1ford, that
case could not have been decided as it was.
The Uniform Code of Military Justice became
effective in 1950 after the trial in this case.

But there

is no reason to condemn all court-martial convictions prior
to 1950 dealing with non-service connected crimes as inher­
ently unfair because tried without grand or petit juries.
In Burns against Wilson» involving a pre-1950 court-martial,,
Chief Justice Vinson concluded that there was no "fundamental
unfairness in the process whereby petitioner's guilt was
determined.45
The second Stovall criterion is reliance of the
law enforcement authority.

This is, 1 think, as clear a

case of reliance as could be found.

For many years military

trials of servicemen for non-service connected crimes was the
established px"actice.

This proceeded not only in terms of

an act of Congress but also in light of many statements by
this Court indicating that military status of the accused
was an adequate predicate for military trial.

This Court

said in Kinsella against Singleton, "Military jurisdiction
has always been based on status of the accused rather than

10
on nature of the offense." And similarly in Whelchell (?)
against McDonald in 340 O.S., a case not cited in our brief
nor in the O8Callahan opinion, this Court said in an opinion
by Mr ok Justice Doug las , '’The right to trial by jury
guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment is not applicable to
trials by courts-martial or military commissions."

There

was no suggestion that this applied only where the offense
was service-connected either in this or in any other
decision of this Court.
O'Callahan was, we submit, a clear departure from
the generally accepted arid understood and uniformly applied
law up to that time.

To use some phrases, it was the

creation of a precedent; it was a mutation, which is a sharp
and unpredictable change in the nature of an organism; it
was invention in the classic sense, that is, a result that
was not obvious to those skilled in the art, as this Court
said in Graham against John Deere & Company.

And if I may

adopt the language of my one-time colleague as a dean, now
Professor Louis Pollock of the Yale Law School, he recently
said, "On a wide range of frontier problems the courts are
taking an almost unprecedented architectural initiative."
This was, I believe, a frontier problem where the line had
never been crossed before and the Court's decision in
015Callahan was, I think, fairly called architectural
creation.

'’In the absence of clear regtiiremants of essential

11
justice, that is the sort of decision which should not be
applied with retroactive effect."

And let me here interject

the well known case of United States against Chambers back
in 291 U.S., where there was an actual formal amendment to
the Constitution, the repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment,
and the Court held that this was inapplicable to offenses
where the judgment had become final before the amendment was
adopted.
And finally as to effect, this cannot be measured
precisely, but it is clear that it will be substantial.

We

have in this case a court-martial conviction 28 years ago
based on a plea of guilty,

There were since the beginning

of World War II, approaching 30 years ago, literally
millions of court-martial convictions in the three services,
with most statutes of limitations operating against
upsetting them.

And there must be hundreds of thousands of

these which involved offenses which were not serviceconnected,

No one can tell how many claims will be raised,

but all will be entitled to make claim, and surely many will
make claim if this Court decides that 0*Callahan is to be
applied retroactively.

It will be a massive amnesty

unforeseen and unforeseeable and without, I submit, sufficient
warrant.
There is also the difficulty of reconstructing
events over many years in the past.

As a practical matter,

12

any retrial in. a different form is almost sure to be
frustrated in the older cases„
There is further the still continuing problem of
determining what is service-connected„

Re1ford discussed

the possible interrelation of 12 different factors, and
these were counted and weighed in various ways in the court
below.

The possible combinations of pro and con permutations

are almost endless, as the decisions below show? tallying up
the pro factors and comparing them with the con factors in
order to make the service-connection judgment many years
after the trial appears unduly cumbersome and not at all
aatisfactorily accurate.
K
i

In this case,, the offense was committed in wartime„

•t

That might be; well enough alone to make it service-connected,
Neither in 08Callahan nor in Re1ford was the offense
•

committed in wartime.

i

Moreover, the offense here.' was

committed while the respondent was admittedly absent without
leave, which is clearly a service-connected offense'»

He was,

in .fact, ten or eleven, days over his leave period, not some
case where he missed the bus and failed to get back, when the
car was stolen,

And he was arrested 16 days after his leave

expired, moving away from his station, from his duty station,
in the stolen automobile in wartime.
Our history shows many instances whore non-service
connected crimes by servicemen have been tried by court-

3.3

martial during time of war.

Congress expressly authorised

such trials during the Civil Warj during wartime there is
more need to keep units together, to have a system which
facilitates rehabilitation.

This is particularly true in

the Navy where ships move out to sea and where it may well
not be feasible to leave ashore not only the defendant but
also other members of the ship's company who may be
essential witnesses.
Q

Mr. Solicitor General, 1 do not recall

whether you touched on it in your brief or not, but does the
statute on correction of military records permit
correction, proceedings for a correction, after the death of
the serviceman?
MR„ GRISWGLDs
but I believe not.

Mr. Chief Justice, I do not know,

The board for the correction of records

has refused to make the correction here.

If it does make

the correction, it will only be pursuant to an order of the
Court and therefore will not be pursuant to any statutory
authorization to the board.
Q

I was wondering whether ancient proceedings

of men now long dead might be sought—
MR. GRISWOLD:

I have no doubt that there will be

efforts to do so in order to establish pension rights of one
kind or another, and certainly that question will have to be
litigated, and I am not prepared to say what the legal

14
factors might be that would bear on it»

Quits apart from

those who are dead, there must be many hundreds of thousands
still living who had been convicted in court-martials in the
past 30 years, some of whom may be able to make the claim
that their offense was not service-connected.
At any rate, when the wartime factor is added to
the element of absence without leave and the offense,
stealing an automobile, facilitated that absence, there is,
we submit, a sufficient military interest to bring the
respondent's crime of auto theft, within the serviceconnected category.

The offense was committed in wartime

and infringements of a military offense that was appropriately
considered to be particularly serious in time of war.

But

let me add st this point that this very discussion at the
close of my argument illustrates one of the problems
inevitably arising if Q6Callahan is held to be retroactive,
which will be that of the great many potential cases, at
least for a long time practically all of them will have to
be litigated because the process of telling what is serviceconnected and what is not, taking out this special group
that was involved in Re1ford—-that is, those occurring on a
military base—if it does not occur on a military base, if it
occurs within the territory of the United States, then the
problem of telling what is and what is not service-connected
can be extraordinarily difficult and not really—that it is

15
something that will have to be litigated, but it is
something upon which the standards to be applied by the
courts in determining the issue are extremely doubtful and
uncertain.
Q

Do you suppose it is possible that the test

of what is or is not service-connected might be quite
different, in time of a declared war from what it would be
in other times?
MR. GRISWOLD:
Q

Yes, Mr. Justice.

And, in other words? it could be even held

that any offense by military personnel in time of a declared
war is ipso facto service-connected?
MR. GRISWOLDs

That would be outer reach of our

contention„ and that contention would surely be made if
✓

Q9Callahan is held to be retroactive and will have to be
decided perhaps by another case which will come to this
Court.
Q

It could foe decided in this cases, could it

not?
MR, GRISWOLD:
yes.

It could he decided in this case,

If not. in the next case, I believe.

But in this

case it could be decided that this offense was serviceconnected merely because it was wartime and that would enable
the Court to dispose of this case as it did Re1ford without
considering the retroactivity issue.

16
Q

It is not involved in this case, but what

status are we in right now?

Moreover, it is

a long time ago, 28 years ago, and there ought to be' some
time when.some of these things are not dredged up and gone
over again.

For these reasons we submit that .the judgment

below should be reversed.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, Mr. Solicitor

General.
Mr. Meltsner.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL MELTSNER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. MELTSNER;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court;
The Government contends that the relevant question
before the Court is whether the absence of trial by jury and
grand jury indictment in military trials so infected the

17
integrity of the truth-determining process that 08Callahan
must foe applied retroactively to this case.

But 08Callahan

took the military justice system as it found it in 1969t
and the Court still determined that the procedures available
at that time were insufficient to rebut a claim that
military jurisdiction ought not foe limited to necessity, to
the special interests of the military,
I take it that the Court focused on the right to
trial by jury and the right to indictment by grand jury and
several other rights, which are discussed in the opinion,,
such as ths independence of the civilian judiciary as
compared to the military, because those were protections
which were not granted to a military defendant in 1969,
Surely if other fundamental procedural protections had not
been granted to Mr, 0'Callahan at the time of his trial,
which took place tinder the Uniform Coda of Military Justice,
I assume the Court would have also discussed and relied
upon the absence of those procedural protections,

I can see

no reason why the Court would not do so.
In this case the Court is confronted' with a man who
was convicted by court-martial totally lacking in fundamental
procedural protections, totally lacking in the protections
which this Court said were enough when it decided that
Duncan v, Louisiana ought not be applied retroactively.

In

short, the litigant in DeStefano at least had a right to a

That was not the case in 1944 in the

vicinage? a majority was sufficient to convict.

There were

And

court-martial members could be replaced in the middle of the
proceeding? they had no tenure right whatsoever.

19
Such procedures, especially when administered in
the context of a military establishment clearly raise, it
seems to me, dangers of infecting the integrity of the
truth-finding process.

Indeed, it was this very reason and

because of the arbitrariness which returning servicemen had
experienced during the Second World War that a storm of
protest was raised and the Uniform Code was passed in 1950
remedying 'several, although not all, of the procedural
deficiencies I have outlined.
In the Navy it is interesting to remember that the
procedures which were applied to John W. Flemings in 1944
had basically been formulated by the Continental Congress in
1775 at the time when the military

establishment, as

Senator Ervin has mentioned in a passage relied upon foy the
court below, at a time when the service was mainly staffed
by mercenaries.
In light of this regime of procedures which simply
must raise questions about the integrity of the fact-finding
process, I think the rule of Williams v. The United States,
and there is really no need for further inquiry info the
reliance and administration of justice aspects of the rule
which we are talking about here.
Q

But—

Going back to your reference to the fact, that

the Code continued essentially the same from 1775 until the
1950 revision, I suppose the gentlemen in Philadelphia were

20
well aware of that when they were drafting Article 1 of the
Constitution, were they not?
MR. MELTSNERs

Nevertheless, in G°Callahan this

Court plainly construed Article 1 to restrict jurisdiction
to where it was absolutely required and necessary by special
military interests and—
Q

In your view, "_e the only escape from

retroactivity the overruling of 0sCallahan?

Do you think

it is an all-or-nothing approach hare?
MR. MSLTSNERs

I certainly think retroactivity

must follow from 08Callahan, at least the cases of this
sort, at least the cases tried under these procedures.
Q

Cases tried before 1950?

MR. MELTSNER:

That is correct.

That is correct.

The point has been mad© at soma length in the
Government's brief and here today by the Solicitor General
that G1Callahan was an invention or, 2 believe the word was,
a mutation.

Perhaps it was in theory, although it seems to

me that O'Callahan merely applied the principles which this
Court had developed over a course of years in limiting
military jurisdiction to a different class of cases.

But

one thing is certain, and that is that there was no reliance
on O8Callahan law in fact.

There may have been a reliance in

principle, but there was no reliance in fact.

From at

least 1955, civilian offenses have generally been turned

21
over to the civilian, authorities ,

In its 08Callahan brief

the United States represented to this Court that military
jurisdiction granted by Congress is in practice a residual
jurisdiction.

Army regulation makes it Army policy to

deliver members to state and local civilian authorities for
trial upon request unless the best interests of the service
would be prejudiced thereby«,
Q

That has been at least since 1955?

MR. MELTSMER:
Q

In fact, the state—

That is correct» •

We ar© dealing in this case, however, with

a time when the nation was totally at war»

Do you happen to

know whether or not it was the policy, of the military back
then to do that?

My personal knowledge is that it was not»

I, was as a young naval officer entrusted for a while every
morning with going down to the police court in Norfolk,
Virginia and getting all the sailors out of there and getting
them back to their ships and getting the civilian authorities
to cede and waive jurisdiction»
MR» MELTSNER;

I do not knew the

practice during

wartime, Mr, Justice Stewart»
Q

Whether in wartime or not, do you think that

is an important factor?
MR, MELTSNER;

I would like to deal with that

when I get to the effect of the decision, and I will do that
in just a moment.

My point here merely is that in 1968

22
90 percent of offpost rapes, 95 percent of all offpost
murders, 96 percent of all housebreakings, and 94 percent
of all offpost motor vehicle cases, the kind of offense
involved here, were turned over to the civilian authorities.
When we get to wartime, I am sure the percentages are lower
at that time.
Q

But the impact—
You need the men to get back in their units

to carry on the war.
MR. MELTSNER

%

Of course.

The impact, however,

of retroactivity of O'Callahan on those cases will be
totally restricted to the processing of applications for
change in discharge status by the administrative agency
which Congress has given that task to, correction of military
records, and to the administrative officials in the judge
advocate general's court.
While at first blush 1 would concede, as the court
below said, it appears; as if this is a staggering problem,
the impact of retroactivity, the more one looks the more one
sees it evaporate.

For example, 70 percent of all military

offenses, of all offenses tried by court-martials are
military offenses.

There is no problem in determining that

those “are service-connected offenses,
take place on post.

Eighty percent of them

Thirty percent of them have taken place

overseas and there is no question but that those are service
connected offenses.

There are only 4,000 men in custody of

23
the military at the present time.

A survey clone by

Mr. Blumenfeld based on Army records, which is discussed at
length in my brief, concludes that one percent of these
cases are likely to involve non-service connected offenses.

No.

that they were briefed before the lower courts, and in none
of the briefs filed by the United States is there any argument
that these statistics are not perfectly accurate.
Q

Do they concede that the statistics are

accurate?
MR. MELTSNER?

They do not address themselves to the

statistics, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, although the statistics '
are Army statistics.

Mr. Blumenfeld expressly states—he is

a former lawyer in the military system—he states the
sources of his statistics and at no point doss the United
States make any attempt to question their accuracy or their

24
applicability.
Q

If you are going to rely on them, why do you

not offer them in the record so that we can have sort of a
conventional review of them?
MR. MELTSNERs

Mr. Blumenfeld8s article, Your

Honor, was not published at the time this case was tried in
the district court.

It came to ray attention as appointed

counsel while the case was on appeal.
The Court of Military Appeals has held that
0°Callahan will be retroactive to cases which came up on
direct review.

Blumenfeld*s study, as 1 suggest, monitored

a year and a half of cases before the Court of Military
Appeals and determined that only one percent were
applicable, would, be non-service connected.
Most of the requests that are likely to come up
under 09Callahan, i£ it is held retroactive, surely can be

handled handled by these administrative agencies, and here
it is interesting to note that the services are quite
familiar with procedures for returning pay? they have a
computerized system for doing this, and they have a lawyer's
review section certainly able to develop standards which will
be applied to determine whether large classes of cases are
service-connected or not.
Thus, under any application of the three-factor
test, we contend that 0'Callahan must be held retroactive.

25
Nevertheless, I continue to believe that the court below
was correct when it alternatively rested retroactivity on
the jurisdictional nature of 0°Callahan.

It, has always bean

thought a settled rule that the judgment of a court without
subject matter jurisdiction was void and could be collater­
ally attacked.

And the Government cites no criminal case

of purporting to modify this principle.
Link letter and its progeny dealt with, rules of
procedure.

The only exception is the 3. S. Coin decision

where this Court decided that when the substantive offense
could not be charged, retroactivity follows automatically
without reference to the three-factor test.
Prospectivity may foe appropriate despite the
jurisdictional nature of a rule when good reasons are
presented, but the Government has not supplied any good
reasons in this case, and neither the Government9s brief,
the opinions of the courts that have dealt with this problem
of ■ 08Callahan6 a retroactivity,nor the academic commentators
have fashioned criteria that should govern in this area.

It

seems to me that by changing the conventional rule as to
jurisdictional cases the Court is opening up itself to the
spectre of retroactivity being a decisional issue in every
case.

It is putting a cloud of doubt on some fairly accepted

notions such as that jurisdictional rules cannot be waived
and that jurisdiction cannot be given by consent.

26
Finally, it seams to me that prospectivity may in
the future act to induce seme, member of the military
establishment to try and extend the power Which this Court
indicated in 08Callahan had to be strictly limited to a
special class of cases by a principle of necessity* Military
jurisdiction's a jurisdictione 1 would contend, based on
necessity.

We try and make it as fair as we can, but in no

sense can. it compare to the civilian court system.
The Government also contends that the auto theft
involved here was service-connected.

Appeals, which has extensively considered this issue in

The first is the

But the military has ample power to

protect its interests in military discipline by punishing
for AWGL, and it is for this very reason that the Court of
Military Appeals has held that absence without leave itself
is not sufficient to convert an otherwise civilian offense
to © military offense.

There is also, as'X pointed out,

no evidence.connecting the absence without leave to the
theft.
Now we come to the question of wartime.

I will

readliy concede that military interests are greater in
wartime than they are in peacetime, military interests in
discipline.

But that, does not lead me to the immediate

30

conclusion that 0sCallahan has no meaning whatsoever in
wartime»

1 would apply the' traditional test that this Court

has applied in cases that arose during the Civil War, the
First World War, and the Second World War»

But it is not

simply the fact, of wartime that ousts the civilian courts
of jurisdiction but whether or not those courts are open
and able to deal with the particular offense.

Q

The cases you refer to in the Civil War and

in the First World War, it was not the question whether a
soldier could be tried by a military court but whether a
military court could try a civilian.
MR. MELTSNER3

That is

correct.

I believe there

are some of those cases where the person is military”
connected.

But in many of those cases it deals with

civilians.

But the test was—
Q

Were any of them soldiers?

Were any of them

members of the military?
MS. MELTSNERs

Not to my knowledge.

But the test

was the same, it seems to me, restricting military juris­
diction to the narrowest possible scope necessary.

So, I

do not think that the fact that the United States was at
war ends the matter.

The question is whether prosecution of

this case in the civilian courts affected, the war effort in
any way.

Where is the theatre of operations?

And it is for

31
this reason, because there was no specific connection, that
the courts below held that wartime was not sufficient in and
of itself®

This man was so important to his military unit

that he was taken immediately and lodged on an island in the
middle of Long Island Sound.

There was no attempt to keep

him with his unit to do anything®

He was 'then sent away

for three years.
In short, if the Government prevails on this point
in this case, 08Callahan has no meaning whatsoever in wartime,
and I think that is contrary to its entire spirit of
limiting the special jurisdiction by principles of
necessity and strictly limiting.
