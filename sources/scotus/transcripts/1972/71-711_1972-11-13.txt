MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first, this morning in No. 71-711, National Labor Relations
Board against Granite State_Joint Board.
Hr. Come.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF NORTH J. COME, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. COME:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
This case is here on certiorari to the First Circuit
which denied enforcement of the Board's order against
respondent union, the local of the Textile Workers Union.
The case involves an application of the principles formulated
by this Court in the Allis-Chalmers and Scofield cases.
Section 8(b)(1)(A) of the National Labor Relations Act makes
it an unfair labor practice for a union to restrain or
coerce employees in the exercise of their Section 7 rights
which includes the right to engage in concerted activity and
the right to refrain from engaging in concerted activity.
The question presented here is whether a union
violates Section 8(b)(1)(A) by fining employees who return
to work during the strike after they had resigned from
union membership and by seeking judicial enforcement of the
fines.

The facts are briefly these:
The union for many years has been the collective

bargaining representative of the employees of the International
Paper Box Machine Company in New Hampshire.
On September 14, 1968, 6 days before the scheduled
expiration of the collective bargaining agreement, the
Union membership voted to strike if a new agreement was not
reached by September 20fch.

No agreement was reached and

the strike with attendant picketing began on that day.
On September 21, the union held a meeting to
discuss strike organization, at which the membership approved
the resolution that anyone aiding or abettiing the company
would be subject to a fine of $2,000.

All but 3 or 4 of

the 160 employees in the bargaining unit were union members,
and all of the union members went out on strike.

The con­

tract that had just expired had a maintenance of membership
provision in it which required employees 'who, or union
members at the time the contract became effective or who
joined the union during the term of the contract, remain
members during the contract term.
Practically all of the Union members attended both
the strike authorization and the fine authorization meetings.
The members assented to the strike by a standing vote with
only one member dissenting.

The motion to levy the fine was

adopted unanimously without discussion.
■

/

On November — yes, sir.
QUESTION:

Mr. Come, were those public votes in

5
the sense that they were not. secret ballots?

HR. COME:
standing votes.

That is correct, Your Honor, they were

They were not secret ballots.

QUESTION:

Do you know what attendance there was?

Or is that in the record?
MR. COME:
the members attended.

The record shows that practically all of
The Court of Appeals and the Trial

Examiner indicated that there, might be some problem in future
compliance proceedings as to whether all of the 31 who were,
subsequently fined were there or not.

But the record shews

that practically the entire membership was present at the
meeting.
QUESTION:
membership.

And I gather there is no issue here of

It is conceded all were members of the union.

MR. COME:

That is correct.

And the question here

is the right of the union to fine the members after they had
resigned from the union.
QUESTION:

Is there any issue of reasonableness of

MR. COME:

That is not in this case.

the fine?
That is

pending in the Boeing case which is on petition for
certiorari, but the Court has not acted on that.
QUESTION:

Would .it make any difference to your

position, Mr. Come, when they resigned?
MR. COME:

Yes

6
QUESTION:

Where would you have the cutoff data?

MR. COME:

Under the principle that the Board is

applying, the cutoff is whether they resigned before they
engaged in the activity for which they are being fined.

In

other words, if they went to work before they resigned, in
the Board’s view under Allis-Chalmers, the fine would be
O.K.

If they resigned before they went to work and then ware

fined, in the Board's view

that, would not be protected.

And

that is what you had in this case.
In the Boeing case, you have also a raid-position
where you have some people who resigned after they went back
to work.

And what the Board did in Boeing was to sustain the

fine as to the strike-breaking activity that occurred before
the resignation, but thereafter held that the fine was
improper.

But you don't have that mid-position here because

it's perfectly clear that all of the 31 employees who were
fined first took the step of notifying the union of their
resignation before they went back to work.
Now, as I have indicated, during the course of this
strike which was still going on at the time of the Board's
second hearing which was 18 months after its inception, you
had 31 employees who, beginning some month and a half to two
months and the bulk occurring seven and a half to twelve
months during the course of the strike, submitted resignations
to the union and went back to work.

7
The union notified them that the were in. violation
of the union rules, ordered them to appear for a hearing
before the union tribunal.

They did not.

They were tried

in absentia and fined the equivalent of a day's wages for
each day worked during the strike.

And when none of the

employees paid the fines, the union filed suits in the State
courts to collect the fines.

These suits are still pending.

And the employees in turn filed unfair labor practice charges
with the Board.
The Board concluded that the 31 employees had
effectively resigned from the union before returning to work
and that the union violated Section 8(b)(1)(A) of the Act by ~~
yes.
QUESTION:

I want to be clear.

No resignation was

submitted in any of the 31 cases, is this so, until after
that meeting at which the resolution was passed that anyone
who crossed the picket line would be subject to a fine of
$2,000?

MR. COME:

That is correct..

QUESTION:

And is it

that fact

the Board relies

on particularly?
MR. COME:

It was that fact that the Court of Appeals

relied on in reversing the Board.

The Court of Appeals said

that since they had participated in the strike vote, they in
effect had by analogy to the charitable subscription line of

8

cases made a contract with the tin ion to see the strike through.
In the Board's submission that, strike vote is not
sufficient to override the employees' Section 7 right to
resign from the union and go back to work.

That's the issue

that we have in the case.
Well,- in Al 1 i3-Chalmers this Court held that a
union did not violate Section 8(b)(1)(A) of the Act by fining
employees who went to work during the strike authorised by
the union membership and by suing in court to enforce the
fines.

The Court,- balancing the union's need to preserve

solidarity during the strike against the employees' Section 7
right to refrain from engaging in concerted activities,
concluded that the union discipline

there did not violata

Section 8(b)(1)(A) because, as we read the Court's opinion,
it. was imposed against the member pursuant to the contract
of membership.

The employees there were full members of the

union and the infraction of the union's strike rule occurred
while they were full members of the union, and therefore, they
were subject to the union discipline.
In the subsequent Scofield case, the Court in holding
that the union did not violate Section 8(b)(1)(A) by leving
a court-enforced fine against employees who violated a. union
production rule that was acquiesced in by the employer laid
down this test, which vre think is applicable here fcr applying
Section 8(b)(1)(A), namely, that it "leaves a union free to

9
enforce a properly adopted rule which reflects a legitimate
union interest, impairs no policy

Congress has imbedded

in the labor laws, and is reasonably enforced against union
members who are free to leave the union and escape the rule c"
Now, we think that the principle to be distilled
which is relevant here is that the power to levy a court™
enforceable fine on an employee for breach of a legitimate
union rule which this is co-terminus with the union member

contract or relationship.

And in the Board's view that was

terminated her© by the resignation for this reasons
The union's constitution and by-laws contain no
provision defining or limiting the circumstances under which
a member could resign from the union.

Under the lav; governing

voluntary associations where there is no specific provision
with respect to resignations, it's settled that a member may
resign at will.
Nov;, the union contends, however, that even if the
31 employees could thus effectively sever ties with the union
even the Court of Appeals was willing to concede that,
absent any provision,

the resignation here was effective

for most purposes — these 31 employees were nonetheless bound
to support the strike until its conclusion because it's only
reasonable to construe the union's constitution and by-laws as
imposing by implication an obligation to see a strike through
to its end, or in any event, that conclusion is warranted here

10

in view of the employee participation in the strike vote.
We submit that neither of these arguments warrants
a different conclusion here.

In the first place, with respect,

to implying by implication an obligation in the union's
constitution and by-laws to see the strike through to the and,
we are coming across a very important right that's guaranteed
by Section 7 of the Act which gives to all employees, including
union members,the right to refrain from engaging in concerted
activities.
QUESTION:

Do you proposed that the result would be

the same in your submission, Mr. Come, if there were an
express provision to that effect in the constitution?
MR. COME:

I would say, Your Honor, that the Board

has not yet had occasion to consider whether a different
accommodation between the Section 7 rights of the employees
and the union's right to impose reasonable discipline would be
warranted if there were such a provision.
QUESTION:

I expect if the Board prevails in this

case, you will get that chance pretty soon.
MR. COME:

I would assume so.

But all I can tell

you is that up until now the Board has not had occasion to
face that question and it has reserved it.

The closest that

the Board has come to it is in dealing with a provision in
the union constitution that provided for resignation only 10
days at the end of a fiscal year.

And the Board has held

11

that that provision doesn't, give any meaningful right to
resign in terms of a strike situation and reached the same
result in that, case as it did in this case where there is no
such provision.

But it has not yet indicated what, it would

do where you had a rule that, was specifically tailored to a
particular strike situation.
QUESTION:

to hold for the employee in the

face of such a provision would be tantamount to saying that
Section 7 rights were unwaiverable, I suppose.
MR. COME:

That is correct.

That would be the

conclusion that the Board would have to —
QUESTION:

Aren’t there some

other instances where

you have upheld waivers?
MR. COME:

There ar© instances where waivers have

been upheld and it really comes down to how basic the hoard's
and the Court's judgment will be as to the right to refrain is
in Section 7.

There are some rights that have been held not

to be waiverable.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. COME:

Now, given this statutory right in

Section 7, however, it's well settled that a waiver of statutory
right, if it can be waived, has got to be expressed.

And you

against that principle if -you found a waiver by implication
in the constitution and by-laws here.
Secondly, there is very good reason for not departing

12
from

the principle of requiring an expressed waiver because

a contract of membership is a rather unusual contract.

A

member becomes bound by the union constitution and by-laws upon
joining the

union, even though he had no real part in formu­

lating the provisions of the contract.

It’s like a contract

of adhesion similar to an insurance policy.

And the principle

applicable there is that as between two possible interpretations
you give the break to the party who had no part in formulating
the terms of the contract.
And thirdly, the decision whether to resign from &
union and return to work during a strike presents the employee
with a very, very difficult choice, a choice that, can be
most meaningfully made in the particular strike situation.
And therefore, it can't readily be assumed that an employee if he
could waive the right would willingly want to do so by
implication.
Four, while the employees may be sympathetic to a
strike when it is first called, events occurring thereafter
which he may not have anticipated may lead him to alter his
view and a desire to return to work.

For example, he may have

underestimated the time that the strike is going to take.

This

strike, as I indicated, was going on for at least 18 months.
And

in underestimating the duration, he may have underestimated

the resultant hardship to himself and to his family, or he may
have underestimated the employer's ability to find replacements

13

for him.
On the other hand, the decision to resign from the
union and abandon the strike is going to deprive the employee,
the individual, of his right to participate in union meetings
at which policies are formulated, to vote for union officers,
it may deprive him of certain union benefits, subject him to
a certain social stigma.
So he has a difficult choice to make here.

And we

submit that the policies of the Act are bast effectuated by
holding, as the Board has, if he can waive this right at all,
it has to be an expressed waiver.
Wow, what about the strike vote here which is what
the Court of Appeals relied on as making the difference?

W©

believe that the strike vote is an unreliable basis for
determining rights and obligations under the Act, particularly
where it. was by a voice vote such as you had here, because
the employees may be induced to strike by a bandwagon psychology.
As a matter of fact, one of the employees here testified that,
yes, he stood up, but he stood up because everybody else was
standing up.

But be that as it may, assuming that he really

wanted to support the strike, we believe that it’s unrealistic
to conclude that any employee voting to strike in 1968 knowingly
made a waiver to suppor that strike to the bitter end no
matter how long it went on or no matter what his own personal,
situation may have developed.

14
Certainly, we believe that it's unreasonable to
attribute to the employee en intention to support the strike
even after he would be willing to take the very severe step of
resigning from the union.
QUESTION:

You say it was a severe step to resign

from the union.
MR. COME:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

What adverse consequences flowed to these

particular union members as a result of their resignation in
this case?
MR. COME:

Well, the record doesn't show specifically

what happened to them.

I can only generalize that normally

by resigning from the union, the individual loses the right
to participate in union meetings at which policies are
determined, and

also the right to vote for the officers of

the union who are going to b© his bargaining representatives.
QUESTION;

If the union had gotten a similar contract

to the one which expired at the conclusion of the strike, could
it have prevented these men from being re-employed?
MR. COME:

NO, it could not have prevented them

from being re-employed.

One thing that the union cannot do

is to affect job rights.
You talked about the kind of contract that they had.
The contract that they had was a maintenance of membership
contract which doesn't require you to be a member in order to

15
keep your employment..

If they had been successful in getting

a union shop agreement, which they did not have, under a
union shop agreement

you have to become a member of the union

within 30 days, they might have been able to require that they
pay dues as a condition of continuing employment.
Taft-Hartley Act, that kind of thing.

Under the

But you could not

require them, at least as we understand the lav;, to actually
become a full member of the union and thus subject themselves
to union discipline.
The further point that I wanted to make is that in
most strike situations, the vote is not by standing vote but
by secret ballot and to try to find out how somebody voted
where it's by secret ballot would impair the secrecy of a
ballot and lead to further complications.
And finally, if you made the strike vote determinative,
we believe this is a serious risk of deterring union democracy,
because employees would be fearful that by participating in
the vote or in the discussions that they might be hooked
forevermore irrespective of what may develop, might decide to
play it safe and not participate, which is certainly not a
desirable result.
MR, COME:

Mr. Come, do I understand correctly that

basically the Board's position is that without regard to all
these special factors, the union's authority begins and ends
with what, it may do with a member, and once one has resigned

16

ha is no longer a member, and therefore conduct after
resignation is simply not subject to union discipline.

Is

that, it basically?
MR. COME:

That is it.

And for these reasons we

submit that the judgment of the Court below should be reversed
and the case should be remanded with directions to enforce the
Board's order.
MR.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Come.

Mr. Roitman.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF HAROLD B. ROITMAN, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. ROITMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
There are several points that I think bear some
emphasis in analyzing this case.

First of all, I think it

should be pointed out that in this case the Board is now seeking
to have what is an already rendered decision of the State
Court of New Hampshire reversed.

In this case the union sought

enforcement of the fines and sought collection of other con­
tract remedies that it had against these 31 individuals in the
New Hampshire Court;

a motion to dismiss that action was

filed, and after a hearing there was the ruling by Mr. Justice
Flynn of the New Hampshire Superior Court denying the motion
to dismiss and asserting jurisdiction for the New Hampshire
Court for the determination of these membership issues acting

17
as the opinion points out, and X have attached the opinion
as a slip to the brief of the responsdent.

The judge pointed

out that the New Hampshire Court was acting in the federally
unentered enclave mentioned by this Court in the Scofield* case
and in the earlier decision of Machinists v. Gonzales where
you will recall the State Courtis ruling that the union had
improperly expelled an individual was held to be a matter for
the decision of the State Court and not a matter reserved to
the Board under the National Labor Relations Act.
Secondly, the Board now seeks, of course, to have
that decision of the New Hampshire Court reversed without in
any way proceeding against the decision in New Hampshire,
either by way of Federal Court, injunction or otherwise.
Secondly, it seems to me that we have here three
distinct, classes of members.
intricacies of the case.
this company.

It gets somewhat lost in the

But there were 160-odd employees of

Three or four of the employees at all times

elected to act pursuant to their Section 7 right not to join
the union and not to engage in concerted activities.

Those

employees never joined the union and never participated in
union affairs.

They refused to join in the strike and, in

fact, the record shows that they continued to work all during
the lengthy strike that occurred passing to and from the picket
line.

And there is, of course, nothing in the record which

in any way indicates that any of their Section 7 rights to

13
refrain were in any way infringed upon by the actions of the
union.

On the contrary, those rights ware scrupulously

observed by the union.

And these people, we say, come squarely

within the Section 7 rights and don’t come within the special
proviso of Section 8(b)(1) which gives the union the right to
act in the situations making membership rules.

But those

-jmployees carefully had their rights reserved under Section 7.
Now, it's our position that with respect to the
other 160 employees, they were all mature men who voluntarily
elected to join the union.

There was no pressure of a union

shop or any other outward pressure with respect to their jobs
which would compel them to join the union.
to join the union on their own.

They freely elected

And then, as the contract was

about to expire, they met in democratic meeting and voted to
engage in

a

strike if a new contract could not be reached

with the company.
Now, that vote for a strike was a part of the
democratic process and a part of the union’s legislative
activities which this Court referred to in the Allis-Chalmers
case as part of the national labor policy.

But. these individuals

and the 31 individuals v/hom the Board seeks to protect in their
strike-breaking activities in this case, all of these employees,
first of all, met and voted to engage in the strike, secondly
QUESTION:

Suppose at that point some of them had

voted against the strike and the strike vote having been taken

—-

19

thereupon resigned.

Would your position as to them be any

different?
MR. ROITMAN:

Yes.

Our position with respect, to

them is that there was an established union procedure — now
be it not spelled out in the constitution, but there was an
established union procedure —

set forth in the membership

application card and check-off authorization card under which
an employee was free to resign his membership in the 10-day
period following termination of the contract.

That was an

appropriate time for any employee who did not want to participate
in the concerted activity of the strike to resign.

The union

pointed out that there had been an established practice and,
in fact, one of the 31 members whom the Board is seeking to
protect here, whose name was Hazen Johnson, was an employee
who had joined the union after spending some time in the
employment of the company.
the union.

Then he had decided to resign from

His resignation had been timely filed at a previous

contract termination and was accepted by the union.

Then he

changed his mind again and reapplied for admission to the
union.

And now, after many months of the strike, he resigned

again for the second time and the union at all times has taken
the position that, those second resignations were untimely but
they would have been timely had they been filed at the
conclusion of the contract and at. the inception of the strike
in that 10-day period

20

QUESTION:

I take it you are insisting, sticking

upon the 10-day provision.
HR. ROITMAN:

Well, it’s the union’s position with

respect to that position that, under Section 8(b)(1) the union
is the

appropriate party to determine what its rules are with

respect to retention of membership.
Now, it’s true that the union did not. spell out
explicitly in the constitution that there was this escape
period, but the union’ did establish,and that’s documented in
the testimony, that it honored as a matter of practice any
resignations that, were submitted during this period.

And the

application for membership card, of course, contained this
10-day escape period immediately above the signature of every
member of the union, every member who applied for membership in
the union signed one of these cards for membership application
which contained within it the recitation that the application
could be withdrawn during this 10-day period.
QUESTION:

Is it your position, Mr. Roitman, that as

to all 31, none having resigned within the 10-day period at
the termination of the contract and within the first 10 days
of the strike, they remained members after that 10-day period?
MR. ROITMAN:
throughout this case.

Yes, that's always been our position
We argued that, point before the Trial

Examiner. It's mentioned again in the Court of Appeals decision.
The Court of Appeals did not attack that particular phase of

21
our argument.

It decided the case on the contract argument

rather than this membership argument.

But I would say that

it is still the position of the union and always has been
that the union has the right under 8(b)(1) to determine its
rules with respect to retention.

This was a rule that, the

union put forth, and the union is the proper party to determine
any ambiguity in those rules, not the Trial Examiner or
some party outside the union.

We just say that the Act puts

the union in the position of being the determiner of those.
QUESTION:

Since the union constitution does not

provide for this 10-day resignation period and the rules do
not apply and the contract doesn’t apply, is that something
the union could withdraw at will unilaterally?
In other words, what is the status —
MR. ROITMAW:

The union membership is a contract of

membership.
QUESTION:

You called it a practice.

Now, is it

something that he could enforce?
MR. ROITMAN:

Yes, I think so.

I think this was in

fact the union rule which was part of the contract of membership
which any member could enforce.

I think he could absolutely

enforce his right to resign at that time.
We would point out also that the construction given
that particular aspect of the case is that, apparently the
Board would allow an individual to resign at any time regardless

22

of this limitation which the union says is there, but if the
Board’s position is taken and you say that a member can resign
at any time during the course of a contract, it would appear
that he would continue to pay dues until this escape period for
the

payment of his dues applied and you have the incongruous

result of an individual continuing to pay dues to an organisa­
tion

of which he is no longer a member.
QUESTION:

Sometime the consequence of that form of

provision in the collective bargaining agreement is —
HR. ROITMAN:

Yes, it is.

But I think the union

construction that the two things juxtapose there is a more
logical one.
QUESTION:

What is New Hampshire lav/ on the question

whether one is still a member if he doesn't resign within a
period like this?
MR. ROITMAN:

The Court in its decision merely stated

that that v/as one of the issues that the Court would take after
it heard the case.
QUESTION:

Which court?

MR. ROITMAN:

The New Hampshire Court.

Judge Flynn's

decision again, which is appended to the back, indicates that
the question of resignation would be one for the Court to
decide on the merits.
QUESTION:

What is your view whether that's a matter

for State lav; or whether it becomes involved —

23

MR. ROITMAN:

Well, I think this Court, has said in

affect in the Gonzales case that that is the kind of an issue
that the Federal Government has not entered into and therefore
it is a matter for the State Court to determine.
QUESTION:

Mr. Roitman, the Court of Appeals

apparently and the Trial Examiner concluded perhaps as you
suggested that there was no evidence that the employees knew of
the union's practice or that they consented to it.

Your

position is that notwithstanding that} conclusion, tills was
something that was up to the union and it didn't make any
difference if the employees knew about it or consented to it,
is that right?
MR. ROITMAN:

Well, we say on the face of the

evidence that when they signed the application card, this
provision was right in front of them, that was certainly some
indication of knowledge that certainly in the case of Johnson
whom I mentioned previously, he knew about it because he had
resigned at the appropriate time, had his resignation accepted,
and then chose to apply for readmission.
QUESTION:

Are you contesting this factual conclusion

then of the Trial Examiner that was upheld by the Court of
Appeals?
MR. ROITMAN:

Well, it's our position that basically,

yes, the union does have the right to make that, determination.
I don't think the issue is central to the upholding the Court

below at. all.

It’s just another facet that can be used to

uphold the final result here which is that it was the union’s
position that these were not effective resignations at the
time they were made and therefore that the people were still
bound.
The Court of Appeals of course, went on the other
ground that this was a contract which bound the members, and we
agree with that.
QUESTION:

Mr. Roitman, I am still bothered a little

bit about this 10-day provision.

I take it. your position

essentially is that Section 7 rights have been waived except
as to the 10-day provision during that period.
Now, suppose there weren’t any 10-day provision at
all.
MR. ROITMAN:

Then I think you are perhaps back in

the situation that this is a voluntary association and that
absent restrictions, this voluntary association can be terminated
by either party at any time as a matter of voluntary right of
anybody to continue the association.
QUESTION:

But with a 10-day provision, that is not

so.
MR. ROITMAN:

No.

We say that that is a part of

the membership contract commitment to be bound by that state of
affairs.
QUESTION:

If it were a one-day provision, it would

25
not. be so.
MR. ROITMAN:

Well, I suppose you can always stretch

the elastic till it breaks.

Our basic position would be that

the union does have the right, under again the proviso

of

Section 8(b)(1) to effectuate a rule with respect to retention
of membership.

And I suppose it can be a harsh rule as well

as a liberal rule.

There is nothing in the Act. which in any

way indicates that.
QUESTION;

Vi
On that, basis, it doesn’t seem to me

there should be any difference between one day or no day.
MR. ROITMAN;

Well, no days is the same if there can

be no escape from membership.
QUESTION;

MR. ROITMAN:
position.

You know, that, is just not an impossible

When we formed a more perfect union, there was no

escape provision.
QUESTION:

Where in the record is the union8 s

position about this resignation?

Were they notified that

their resignation would not be accepted?
MR. ROITMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, they were.

I can’t, find it.

MR. ROITMAN:

,f must have missed it.

Each of the employees who resigned,

the first two were sent letters by the head of the Granite
State Joint Board, and it was called to their attention that
their resignation would not be considered effective and the

26

fine would bs imposed against them.

And later on in the

record, after the company —
QUESTION:
of it?

Where is that in the record, the original

Is it in there?
HR. ROITMAN:

Yes.

Page 79, Your Honor, is ---

well, no, page 79 is the letter —
QUESTION:

Page 35, would that be it?

MR. ROITMAN:

Yes, that's correct.

"Dear Felix:'1

There are two

letters set forth, one of which has a P.S. on it and the other
one does not, page 34 and page 35 and page 36 indicate that.
QUESTION:

Where in here is it they are relying on

the 10-day rule?
MR. ROITMAN:
QUESTION:

That is not spelled out in the letter.

Is it spelled out any place?

MR. ROITMAN:

Spelled out. — Well, the evidence with

respect to that appears in connection with the examination of
Mr. Pitarys at the first case.

I think it's about page 20 or

21.

QUESTION:

But you are relying on that now.

When did

you start relying on the 10-day provision?
MR. ROITMAN:

Well — in the decision of the Trial

Examiner, the first decision in the case, he sets forth some
of the union arguments which he deals with, and that is one
of them that he mentions.

The point that was brought out, I

think, by my brother in his examination was

that the Board had

27

considered this type of issue, the 10-day escape period, in
connection with the Automobile Workers Union in a case that
went up to the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit called
the Paulding case, which is referred to in the briefs»

In

that case the Automobile Workers did have a provision in the
constitution which allowed resignations only in that 10-day
period.

The Board held that that did not apply, but the Court

of Appeals reversed the Board in that case.
petition for certiorari.
was accepted.

There was no

The decision of the Court of Appeals

That's at 320 F. 2d and-is referred to in several

instances in the briefs.
QUESTION:

Am I correct, up through the case in New

Hampshire and the later charges filed with the NLRB, that this
10-day period didn't become an issue until then?
MR. ROITMAN:
QUESTION:

No.

That's right.

It wasn't an issue when they were fined,

am I right?
MR. ROITMAN:

No, nobody raised that question.

union always took the position that it had a right

The

to fine

these individuals on the basis of their strike vote, on the
basis of their participation in the vote for the fine, and in
the fact that their resignations were defective.

All three

of these things were part of the —
QUESTION:

Even if they were made within the 10-day

period, they still would have fined them, ara I right?

28

MR. ROITMAN:

No, I don’t think so.

These resignations

came not within any stretch of a 10--day period, but months and
months after the strike had not only started, but after these
31 individuals had not only voted for the strike but had
actively participated in the strike.

These employees all went

on strike, these 31 employees all participated in the -picketing.
They all participated, mor most, all of them, participated in
the decision of the union to secure group health insurance for
the strikers, they participated in union benefits for strikers.
They were actively and affirmatively supporting the strike
for many months.

And we say that all of these factors are

part of the reliance item which entitles the union to fine
them for their subsequent strike-breaking, because they broke
their contract which they affirmatively had worked to promote
by engaging in the strike-breaking.
I would suggest that —
QUESTION:

May I ask — I have been looking in the

printed record, but can't locate a form of application for
membership which includes that 10-day provision.
MR. ROITMAN:

Hava I --

You will find it in the original

application, petition for certiorari, where the decision of
the Trial Examiner is set forth.
first opinion.

He sets it forth in his

I think it is also set forth in the record at

page 34, your Honor.
QUESTION:

Thank you.

29

MR. ROITMAN:

The last paragraph here says that.

"the authorization shall remain in effect unless I revoke it
within 10 days," and each individual signed that, as you notice,
right underneath the recitation.
The matter is also referred to in Trial Examiner
Janus' opinion, and I think he sets forth

a copy of the

check-off and membership application clause in his opinion.
QUESTION:

Mr. Roitman, is it your position that the

obligation of the union members continued for the duration of
the strike regardless of how long the strike lasted?
MR. ROITMAN:
position that we take.

Yes, I think that's essentially the
That is, when union members vote to go

out on strike, they know they are engaging in a serious economic
confrontation that can last for an indeterminate period.

And

they obligate themselves to see that enterprise through till
its termination.

And its termination, I might say, might come

either because the exercise of the economic forces on both
of the parties, it gets them into a compromise position,or one
of the other side yields sufficiently to get an accommodation,
or as in the case here, the union finally votes to abandon or
discontinue the strike.

That wasn't in the record here, but

ultimately that is what happened.
QUESTION:

Was there any meeting of the union

membership subsequent to the September 21st meeting, 1968,
when they voted to impose a fine?

30

MR. ROITMAN:

Oh, yes.

There were constant meetings

where the officers reported back to the membership on the
status of negotiations and the situation which the union was
in, where they voted to undertake items, for example, like the
insurance matter which I referred to a moment, ago.

That

wasn't spelled out very carefully in the record, but I think
there is perhaps a brief reference to it in some of the
letters of resignation.

On© or more of the members complained

he didn't like the way one of those meetings was run.

But

there were frequent meetings at which there was ample
opportunity for these 31 employees to exercise their
democratic right within the union to persuade any of the others
to their cause.
And we say that that's the position that this Court
left the parties in in the Scofield case, namely, that the
union, the national labor policy is one that favors the
democratic operation of union affairs, that the union has
these legislative powers with respect to collective bargaining,
that when they democratically vote to undertake a strike, the
only thing that remains open after that is the settlement of
the strike or the use of the democratic process to change the
position.

And in the Scofield quotation that’s relied on by

the Board, if you back up a few sentences, I think that’s made
clear by the Court.

The Court points out that it’s the right

of an individual to exert his democratic influence or his

31

influence on the body and have his minority position,, if you
wish, changed to a majority position by persuasion.

And that

position is the one that's in accord with legislative policy
under the Act and is in effect the only way that, th© contract,
commitment can be changed,by mutual agreement.
We point out that the Board itself in dealing with
associations, for example, that are put together for th®
purpose of mutual collective bargaining lays down th© rule that
you can only withdraw from such an association prior to the
time the association engages in collective bargaining.

That

a subsequent withdrawal must be by mutual consent rather than
by any individual having an individual veto power.
If you allow the Board's position, of course, each
individual has a right to veto the legislative determination
of the majority, and you have not a democratic proposition, but
an anarchy within the union which allows each member to be
an individual breaker of the joint commitment.

And there

again, we pointed out situations where in the past the Court,
has held that an individual waives his right to engage in
strikes when the union votes to accept a contract against
striking.

There are various other situations we have referred

to in the brief where for one reason or another the individual
member’s right to either engage in a strike or not to engage
in a strike is affected by the majority determination of th©
union in accordance with the National Labor Policy.

Mr. Come, do you have

anything further?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF NORTON J. COME, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. COME:

I just wanted to point out, as I believe

Mr. Justice Rehnquist noted, that the Court of Appeals found
on pages 5a to 6a — it's really 6a of the petition.— adopted
the Trial Examiner’s finding that there was no evidence that
the employees knew of this practice or that they consented to
tliis limitation on their right to resign,

that is, with

respect to this 10-day point that Mr. Roitman has been making.
QUESTION:

Some are of the point of view that, say,

if you signed it, you did know about it and it was effective.
What would you then say as to whether they were members at the
time they actually resigned?
MR. COME:

Well, I think that there you would have

an issue that would probably have to be remanded to the Board,
because as the Board found the facts here, this 10-day
provision was not something,first of all, that had anything to
do with resigning from the union.

It was a combination
The Trial Examiner found

that the 10-day provision related only to the check-off provision,

He further found that there was no evidence in the
record that showed that the employees were made aware that this

was the way that you have to resign from the union.
Court of Appeals sustained that finding.

We submit that it is

supported by substantial evidence for the additional reason,
as Justice Marshall pointed out, that nowhere in the letters
that were sent to the employees was any mention made of the
