PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

In 71.--8625 United Air Lines, against Mahin.
Mr. Berens, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK H. BERENS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. BERENS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This is a Commerce Clause case.
The question presented is whether Illinois, in
conformance with that clause, may impose its use tax on all
fuel loaded by United Air Lines aboard its aircraft about to
leave the Chicago airports on interstate and foreign flights.
As found by the Trial Court and confirmed by the
Illinois Supreme Court, the facts can be stated very briefly.
All of the fuel is purchased by United from Shell
Oil Company at Shell Oil's terminal in Northern Indiana, at
which point, delivery occurs and title and risk of loss transfers
from Shell to United.
From there, United arranges transportation by
common carriers, principally a pipeline, to o'Hare and Midway
Airports in Chicago.
The fuel is stored at those airports on the average
from two to six and one-half days, of which about two days is
required to remove impurities accreted during the transportation

4
The fuel is then loaded itato United's aircraft.
Q

Is it brought from Indiana to Chicago airports by

truck?
MR. BERENS:

Mainly by pipe line for jet fuel*

There are trucking operations to Midway because the
volume is much less there.
The truck-line,as well as the pipe .line, is a coupon
carrier, and the contracts are between those carriers and
United.
The fuel is loaded into United's —
Q

How long did you say it remained at the airport

before it is loaded aboard - MR. BERENS:
days.

A minimum of two, a maximum of twelve

The average is two to six and one-half.
Q

And this is to clean impurities?
MR. BERENS:

Approximately two days are required to

settle the fuel and filter it.
The remainder of the time is merely coordinating
transfers of the fuels, the scheduling of the transfer with
the flight operations.
Q

Meaning that there may be quantities more than

aircraft?
MR* BERENS:
pump a large amount
month to 0‘Hare.

They are several days on hand.

They

-** the jet fuel is pumped three times a

The other fuel to Midway is carried by truck

3
on almost a daily tests.
Q

And the quantity loaded on a particular aircraft

differs9 does it?

Depending on how much —

MR. EERENS:

A great amount.

There is variation,

depending on its destination and depending on how ranch fuel
it came in with.

It can range from — and it is in poundage

rather than gallons in the air industry

from a couple

thousand to sixty or seventy thousand pounds of fuel.
The fuel is loaded almost always immediately just
prior to the departure of the aircraft.
None of the fuel involved in this litigation is
used locally or in intrastate flights.
These arrangements have been followed by United
continously since 1953,

two years prior to the enactment of

the Illinois Use Tax Act; and they are part of a nationwide
contractual arrangement between Shell and United which covers
delivery at 43 different points.
For example. United takes delivery at Shell's
Northern Indiana terminal, not only for the Chicago airports
but for other airports in the Midwestern States.
All of the fuel loaded is, as I said earlier, con­
sumed on interstate and foreign flights and almost all of it
outside of Illinois.
The reason for this is that,under the Federal
Aviation Regulations, commercial carriers are required to carry

6
large amounts of reserve fuel, and they land,with this reserve
fuel, at Chicago, according to the record, 99.9% of the time.
And it is this fuel that is principally first
consumed as the plane leaves the State.
And keep in mind where Chicago is, in Illinois, up

at the upper comer of Che State, so that the distance
traversed on many flights, particularly east and northbound,
over Illinois, is 60 or less miles.
Q

Would this be west *>MR. BERENS:

Westbound it varies from 130 to 216

miles, Your Honor.
Q

Depending, I suppose, on whether they are going due

West or Southwest.
MR. BERENS:
pattern.

These are all due West on United’s

They have only one Southwest route that is only used

in 3/10's of 1% of the time.
Q

The situation might be different, I take it, for

Braniff, or someone who is flying South out of Chicago to
New Orleans?
MR. BERENS:

Although not in the record, that’s our

understanding.
And, also, air lines that serve Saint Louis and the
Southwest are covering a great deal of mileage —
Q

Surely the issue here doesn’t depend on whether a

particular air line crosses a few snore miles of Illinois than

7
United, does it ?
MR. BEREMS:

We submit that la part it does, based

or* the very premise of the Use Tax Act, and in particular
the 'Illinois statute that I will attempt to develop.
Q

So this will be a decision for United only?
IU. BEREWS:

Ho, I believe it will apply. Your Honor,

to all other air lines, but conceivably on a factual basis.
Q

Well, I take it what you are saying is that if they

use ail the gasoline up, or whatever fuel this is, and make
another stop in Illinois, you might have quite a different
case.
MR. BEREWS:
tax

In that case,Illinois has asserted

and the air lines are paying the

tax already when that

occurs.
United, for one, has a flight from Moline to Chicago
where they pay the Use Tax on the amount loaded aboard the
flights.
Q

It is on the amount loaded, not the amount consumed?
MR. BEREHS:

It is identical in that particular

situation.
Q

But I suppose normally they hope it is quite close.
MR. BERENS:

Again, Mr. Chief Justice, it varies

according to the destinations -Q

They don’t warifc to carry excess

certainly want to carry enough.

fuel, but they

8
MR, BERENS;

Well, under the FM Regulations,

they are required to carry what you might, and what 1 might,
think is a great deal of excess, tens of thousands —
Q

To meet weather problems —
MR. BERENS:

This is to meet any contingency that

can be conceived of.
Even when there are weather problems and they may
have to land in another alternate airport, they schedule the
fuel so that if they do land in the other airport, they have
the same reserve as they would have had had they landed in
the original scheduled airport,
Q

I take it you argue that this is a necessary incident

of the interstate commerce aspect?
MR. BERENS:

This is compelled by common sense as

well as the FAA and the CAB.
Wot only Is the fuel consumed outside of Illinois,
except do ainiamg amounts, but depending on the type of
aircraft, from 35 to 60% of the fuel loaded in Chicago is
actually consumed after the plane has landed in another State,
and is proceeding in the next leg of its interstate journey.
The Illinois Use Tax is a privilege fax imposed on
the use of tangible property in Illinois.

It is a general

revenue tax, and Its proceeds are not allocated to airport
construction or maintenance.
The Act defines use in the usual broad way, to include

9
the exercise of any right of ownership over property.
But the Illinois Act then limits this definition- by
several exceptions intended, according to the explicit tenus of
the Act, to prevent, and I am quoting, '’actual or likely
multi-state taxation."
One of these exceptions is the so-called temporary
storage provision, which excludes from the concept of a taxable
use, the storage in Illinois of property purchased outside
of the State, brought in by the owner and then used outside
the State.
The construction placed on this provision by the
Illinois Supreme Court in the decision below, raises the
serious Commerce Clause issue that is appealed to this Court.
From 1955, when the Act was first enacted, until
1963, Illinois sought only to tax that portion of the Chicago
laden fuel that was actually burned over Illinois by departing
flights*

This was known as the "burn-off rule," and United

did not contest the constitutionality of the tax during that
period because it considered it not unfair.
In 1963, the Illinois Department of Revenue issued
a bulletin which took the position that this stored fuel
becomes taxable, and I’ll quote the words of the bulletin:
"when it is placed into the tank of an airplane, railroad
engine or truck," continuing to quote, "at this point, the
fuel is converted into its ultimate use and therefore a

10
taxable use occurs in Illinois,” end of quote.
The bulletin contrasted this with the situation where
the fuel is hauled,as it called it, by separate facility, by
which it meant a tank truck or a railroad tank car or a
pipe line, in which case, the storage, the withdrawal, nor the
transportation, was taxable.
In a four-three decision below, the Illinois Supreme
Court upheld the position taken by the bulletin.

And I want

to point out that the majority below was composed of two twojudge opinions,a per curiam of two judges and a two-judge
conferring opinion.
There was a three-judge dissent.
The concurring opinion was specific regarding the
taxable incidents.

It said, and I am quoting again:

“Illinois

may constitutionally collect the tax imposed on all of the fuel
loaded on United*s planes at the airports."
The per curiam opinion was much more complex.
Q

Is there any evidence that the fuel was ever used

for any other purpose than for these planes?
MOL. BERENS:

Not on this fuel in this litigation.

There is no diversion of it whatsoever.
Q

Well, then, 1*11 ask your friend to indicate what is

the distinction in terms of its dedication for ultimate use,
why that doesn’t occur as soon as it gets in the storage tanks
at the airport, but I think that's for him rather than you.

ii
MR. BERENS:

I will not answer that.

The per curiam opinion was much more complex.
First of all, as a preliminary conclusions it held
that the burn-off rule was unconstitutional under the Commerce
Clauses citing Kelson and Randolph v. Kentucky, Volume 279 of
this Court's reports.
And this placed the

pez

curiam

judges in the anominoua

position that holding a tax on that part of the fuel loaded in
Chicago that was actually consumed in Illinois was a burden on
the commerce, but that if the State taxed all of the fuel
loaded even though it was burned outside the State, it was not
a burden, thereby making a tax on part more of a burden than
tax on all.
But returning to the construction of the temporary
storage provision, the Court discussed three events that
applied to all the fuel, the storage, the withdrawal and
the loading aboard the aircraft, and it spelled out a distinction.
It said that if the fuel were removed from the storage and taken by, again, separate facilities, or as it expressed
it, in a vehicle which does not consume the fuel, to another
State, neither the storage nor the withdrawal, nor the loading
onto that vehicle, nor the transportation from the State,
would be subject to tax.
It contrasted this with the situation where the fuel

12
is stored the same way, withdrawn the same way, but loaded on
a vehicle which consumes it.
Q

They were construing the State law here?
MR. BEREMS:

They were construing the State law

which I am taking time, Your Honor, to do because it is the
foundation of our argument.
And in that situation, which was identical in ail
respects to the other except onto what it was loaded, it found
that a taxable use occurred.
How, it attempted to relate the taxable use back, to
the storage but we submit that*s a nonsequitor because the
storage in both instances is the same, so is the withdrawal,
but is decisive,and the taxable event, we submit, is the
loading onto the vehicle which consumes it.

Thus,the ver curiam»

of Michigan-Wisconsin Pipe Line Co. v. Calvert. Volume 347, and
a number of other cases.
That case, which was a unanimous decision, held that
Texas could not impose a severance tax on natural gas being
transferred from a refinery pipe line in Texas to an interstate
pipe line, and the Court said, in part, that the tax, and I am

v. Calvert, Volume 347.
Q

Mr. Eerens, what if the Supreme Court of Illinois

had said, instead of, as you say, at least by implication,
that the taxable event was the loading, that the taxable event
was the storage in immobile storage container for whatever
period of time?
Would your case be any different?
MR. BERENS:

We don’t believe the Illinois Supreme

Court could have said that in light of the statutory provisions
they were construing which exempted the storage.
But taking your question one step further, if that
temporary storage provision did not exist in the Illinois
statute, we would concede that the storage and the withdrawal
could have been taxable under the Commerce Clause under
Edelman and Nashville v, Wallace

It is a statutory situation that makes the con*
stitutional issue what it is.
Q

I would mention Edelman.

You are going to distinguish

that case somewhat?
j-w

-

MR. BEREfitS:

+•

I hope to.

In Michigan*^isconsin, the, quote, ”The Court
cited Joseph V. Carter and Weeks, which some years earlier had
invalidated a New York City gross receipts tax on the income
of a stevedoring company loading ships in New York Harbor and
unloading them.”
And that case stated — the Carter and Weeks

«

and I quote from page (inaudible), "Transportation in
commerce, at the least, begins with loading and ends with
unloading.

Loading and unloading has effect on transportation,

outside the taxing State, because those activities are not
only preliminary to,but are an essential part of the trans*
portation itself,” end of quote.
To the same effect,are numerous cases cited in our
brief.

And we have found no authority in the regulatory area

or the tax area that holds that loading is not an integral
part of interstate transportation.
At least in its brief, the State bases and justifies
this tax primarily on Nashville v. Wallace, 288 U.S., and
Edelman v. Boeing Air Transport.
In both those cases, I should add, which respectively

15
Involved the taxation by Tennessee and Wyoming of fuel that
was eventually used in an interstate rail system and inter­
state air carrier -- in both those cases, this Court accepted
the construction of the lower courts that the State tax
involved was on the storage and on the --or the withdrawal
from the storage.
And based on that, this Court concluded that the
taxable event was prior to the commencement of the interstate
movement, prior to the (inaudible),
And I emphasise that in both of those States at
the time of the litigation, there was nothing resembling a
temporary storage provision as exists in Illinois, making the
statutory situation fundamentally different, in our opinion.
Q

Yet the Edelman statute had an exemption for

gasoline exported or sold for exportation from the State.
MR. BERENS:

It certainly did, Your Honor, and

looking at the briefs and the record in the library here, there
was no evidence that counsel for either side alluded to that
to this Court.
Q

Well, do I imply from that that that’s meaningless

in the EdeIman statute then?
MR. BERENS:

I don’t know if it is meaningless.

Your Honor, but I do submit that it had not been pressed to
this Court as a provision that was relevant in the statute.
If it had been, I think it is conceivable that the

16
Court in Edelman may have distinguished the case a year earlier,
that is the Wallace case, but the Court in this case, specific­
ally said that the statute here construed is identical to that
construed in the Wallace case.
Q

You don't relate it to the temporary storage exemption

in your Illinois structure?

You don't relate the Edelman

exemption?
MR. BERE1JS:

Unfortunately, we are confronted with

that exemption in the Edelman situation.

It did not seem

to be considered by the Court in its consideration.
If it had, I would have thought Edelman would have
come out the same way we are urging the Court to cone out in
this situation, that because of the export provision there
couldn’t be any tax.
But also, I may add, in the Edelman. there seems to
have been a mistake in applying the statute, rather than a
constitutional issue.
The State also relies in Southern Pacific v. GaHigher,,
which,together with the other two cases I just mentioned, is
specifically distinguished by Carter and Weeks at 330 US432,
noted.
In both Miehigan-Wisconsin and Carter and Weeks,
this Court has stated that where the tax

is on an integral

part of the transportation, it is not necessary to show multistate taxation, but that the mere possibility is sufficient.

17
Here, we have actual multi-state taxation.
The fuel purchased from Shell is subject to Indiana
gross income tax measured by the sale price to United.
A few days later, Illinois will subject the same
fuel to its Use Tax, based on the same sales price.
In addition, as pointed out in our reply brief, there
is a potentiality of States downstream taxing the same fuel
in situations where a flight lands, let us say, in Dayton,
Ohio, and then proceeds to Columbus, where there is a segment
within the State.
This applies to roughly one out of five of United’s
departures.
We don’t want to rely entirely on authority, but we
would like to relate to the fundamental purpose of the
Commerce Clause.
I think this was well-stated in the Carter and
Weeks

case, at the very end.
Not only do these precedents outlaw taxes, but it

has reason to support such outlawing in the likelihood that
legislation will flourish more luxuriantly where most
revenue will come from foreign or interstate commerce.
Thus, in port cities, and transportation or handling
centers, without discrimination against oufc-of-State as
compared with local business, larger proportions
of necessary revenue could be obtained from the flow of

18
commerce *
The avoidance of such a toll on the passage of
commerce through a locality was one of the reasons for the
adoption of the Commerce Clause.
Now, we view this as a toll, not in the classical
sense, but if you look at the Use Tax as the privilege of
enjoying property, the enjoyment of a consumable good, such
as fuel, is in its consumption, not in its storage.
But only a very small fraction of this fuel is
actually consumed in Illinois and that only on about 4% of
the departing flights of United.

The rest is burned outside

of Illinois, much of it in other States.
If you strip this of its formalism, Illinois seeks
to impose a toll on fuel purchased outside of the State,
temporarily stored here only, in the words of the Illinois
Supreme Court, "to facilitate United's interstate operations
from Chicago — "
Q

Let me interrupt.

When you said:

"only to facilitate

United's interstate operations," you are inserting the word
interstate from the quotation of the Illinois Court, are you
not?
MR. BERENS:
Q

On what authority are you doing that?
MR. BEREWS:

Q

Yes, and that was inadvertent.

That was inadvertent,

You’ve done it more than once, I think, in your brief.

19
1 thought you built an argument on this inadvertent
insertion.

But it is inadvertent?
MR. BERENS:

The quote of the Court was "on its

operations from the Chicago airport.”

The word interstate was

not in there.
I think in the brief we have frequently said "built
on its interstate operations," but I don't believe we have
quoted it, if.that was the import of your comment, Your Honor.
Q

Well, you also store this fuel and pay tax in

relation to your intrastate flights, do you not?
MR, BERENS:

I am sorry, 1 didn't hear your

question.
Q

I say, you also store this fuel and pay tax in

relation to your intrastate flights?
MR. BERENS:

Yes, we always have.

That is not part

of this assessment or part of this case.
Q

I realize that, but your insertion of the word

"interstate" in the quotation, I think, is confusing, in
view of that fact.
I can leave it to counsel to comment on it and see
what they have to say by way of illumination.
Q

Mr. Berens,

you say you want to get away from

formalism and then cite very authoritative precedents to that
effect, and, yet, if you concede that Illinois could have
reached this same result had it just picked the right incident

20
to tax, i.e., the storage itself.
Your own position has a certain formalism to it,
doesn’t it?
ME. BERENS: Well, I think, the formalism supported
by considerable line of authority in this Court, such as.the
Spector case, Dilwortfa v. McLeod and many others,which said
the means by which the State, in Freeman v. Hewit- imposes
its taa?, is decisive.
Q

You really can't reconcile all the cases in this

Court on the subject, can you?
MR. BERENS:
them.

I don't think we can reconcile all of

We can certainly reconcile most.
Q

What have we got on this deal, 80 or more decisions?
MR. BERENS:

Q

I understood it was 300.

All right then, 300.

If you can reconcile even 80,

I think you've done quite a job.
MR. BERENS:

Fortunately, I don't think I have to

reconcile that many.
O

Getting back to Mr.Elackmun's question to you, 1

notice you've bracketed at least page 31, where you quote
from the Supreme Court, you've bracketed the vsord "interstate,”
but isn't this something like the Evansville approach to the
Supreme Court, of Illinois taking «*» dropping out your inter»
state, speaking about these as operations to facilitate?
MR. BERENS:

We would distinguish Evansville on the

21
basis that
Q

My question was: don’t you thinly, that's the approach

the Illinois Supreme Court was taking?
MR. BERENS:
Q

I don’t think so.

. Well, I gather the storage

I take it, whether it's

used on intra or interstate flights, it’s all stored in the
same tanks, isn't it?
MR. BERENS:
Q

Yes.

And you say for 12 days.

And I'd expect in that

period, there is considerable quantity withdrawn and loaded
aboard intra-state planes.
MR. BERENS: I have to make one clarification,
Mr. Justice Brennan.

None of the flights departing Chicago

are intra-state flights of United.

While they do stop at

Moline, they are continuing flights to points outside the State,
Q

That may be so, but, nevertheless, I think you've

already agreed that — have you not? — that what’s burned
between Chicago and Moline is taxable?
MR. BERENS:

We pay the tax on it, but we have done

it as a volunteer for many years.

We do not think those are

intra-state flights.
Q

But you don’t think the Illinois Supreme Court —
/

of course, Evansville was decided after this case was decided —
MR. BERENS:

And I believe the Lower Court cases in

Evansville were also after that.

22
We distinguish Evansville,very briefly, on the fact
that the landing fees and other fees that United pays and the
other air lines pay at the Chicago airports are fully compen­
satory, not only for maintenance of the airports and operation
of them, but also it repays the bond issue ~~
Q

That was true in Evansville, too.

They also paid

landing fees.
MR. BERENS:

But the airport was operating apparently

at a deficit, as I read the opinion, and this -Q

We had the companion New Hampshire case «■- 1 have

forgotten the name of it, where they had all hinds of additional
fees besides the departure tax.
MR. BERENS:

As I read those cases, or at least your

opinion of those cases, not the Lower Court's, they were still
not fully compensatory, that additional funds were needed and
this contributed to them.
And, in fact, as I recall your opinion, you pointed
out that as long as the amounts for the head taxes did not
exceed by a gross margin the deficit, that would be treated as
a service that the State was providing, was being paid by
these head taxes.
I would like to also mention very briefly the
cases and line of cases cited by the amicus brief-, the socalled stream of commerce cases, which points out that the
fuel here is committed from the time not just when it is stored

23
in Illinois, but at the time it is brought up as jet fuel
to Northern Indiana to interstate commerce.
And that it is brought from Indiana through Illinois,
stored there temporarily, only for the exigencies of United’s
interstate operation, and then is taken -- almost all of it
is taken from the State and is consumed elsewhere.
If the stream of commerce cases preclude property
taxes on goods moving in commerce, which are assessed only
once a year, it seems even more essential that they be construed
liberally, as this Court has indicated on several occasions,
including Richfield Oil, to preclude a tax on the flow every
day of the year, which would be the situation here.
One possible approach, of course, is burn-off, and
we have -- while we believe the situation is controlled by
Michigan-Wisconsin, and that the loading is an event that
cannot be taxed, examples in recent years, such as Northwestern
Portland Cement and General Motors v. Washington, have approved
apportion taxes on net and gross income from interstate trans­
actions.
Q

Are you suggesting that we construe the statute that

way, that is, save it by saying it can’t exceed the burn-off
rate?
MR. BERENS:

I don’t think, Mr. Chief Justice, you
t

have to construe the statute that way.

As a constitutional

matter, you can say that this is permissible.

24

And, we have the situation where the Lower Court
seemed fco have construed the statute the way it did, or at
least two of the four-judge majority did, because they thought
burn-off was constitutionally impermissible, and so they had
to go for the decision which yielded the full tax or none at
all.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. O’Rourke.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT J. O’ROURKE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. O'ROURKE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The question presented before this Court is whether
United Air Lines exercised such a right or power over tangible
property, and in this case it is aviation fuel, Incident to
the ownership of that property in Illinois, so as to subject
United to the provisions of the Illinois Use Tax, and whether
or not the imposition of this tax is violative of the Commerce
Clause set forth in Article 1, Sec. 8, Clause 3 of the
Constitution, and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment.
The Illinois Use Tax, which went into effect in
August of 1955, imposes a tax on the privilege of using in
the State of Illinois, tangible personal property that was
purchased elsewhere, and was designed to complement the
retailers’ occupational tax,under which a tax is imposed upon

25
persons engaged in the business of selling tangible personal
property to purchasers for use and consumption.
Now, both of these statutes, the Illinois Use Tax
and the Illinois Retailers Occupation Tax, have both been found
to be constitutional.
The Use Tax Act of Illinois was enacted for the
valid purposes of preventing evasion of the Retailers
Occupational Tax by persons making out-of-State purchases
of tangible personal property for use in Illinois, and also
the additional purpose of protecting Illinois merchants against
the diversion of businesses.
Shell Oil Company, in this case, refines its
turbine fuel at its refineries in Wood River, Illinois, then
transfers it via pipe lines, 250 miles, to storage facilities
in Hammond and East Chicago, Indiana, for storage.
Both Hammond and East Chicago, Indiana, are south
suburbs of the City of Chicago, and no further processing
occurs at Shell's facilities, merely the filtering necessitated
by the pipe line transfer.
United Air Lines purchased this aviation fuel from
Shell, United sends its orders into Shell's office in East
Chicago, Indiana, takes delivery in Indiana, and transfers
the aviation fuel via a common carrier pipe line, to storage
tanks in Des Plaines, Illinois, which is a northwest suburb
of the City of Chicago, just adjacent to O'Hare Airport..

26
The storage tanks in Des Plaines are owned by
Shell Oil Company, but are leased to United and to American
vfoere gas owned by both companies is co-mingled.
The aviation fuel is allowed to settle in storage
tanks in Des Plaines, Illinois, before it is transferred again
by pipe line owned by Shell but leased to United to United’s
O’Hare Airport underground facilities.
These underground tanks service the jet aircraft
before they embark from O'Hare.
How, the delivery of the gasoline to Chicago’s Midway
Airport is via common carrier tank trucks from Shell’s Indiana
facility to the Midway Airport.
Now, all aviation fuel that is ultimately pimped into
United’s aircraft at either O’Hare or at Midway, and that is
subject to the present litigation, is either refined and/or
stored by Shell at Wood River, Illinois, facilities prior to
its transfer to Hammond and East Chicago.
Now, Shell claims that it pays an income tax based
on one-half of 1% of its gross sales in Indiana, but Shell
pays no sales tax or retail occupation tax to the State of
Indiana or to the State of Illinois.
United does not pay any sales tax or use tax in
any

State, other than Illinois, on the purchase of the fuel

involved in this controversy.
From August, 1955, until June 3, 1963, United paid

27

to the State of Illinois, without protest, a use tax on this
fuel purchase, delivery and storage, on that portion of the
fuel deemed to have been used or consumed within the borders
of Illinois on flights departing from Midway and o'llare to
points outside of Illinois.
The advantage of this burn^off theory is that in
many instances it would make United subject only to a use tax
on the 10 to 15 mile trip from O’Hare to Lake Michigan.
Then as now, Illinois Use Tax was imposed upon the
privilege of using in Illinois tangible personal property
which was purchased at retail.
How, use, as defined in the Illinois statute, is
defined, and I quote, "exercised by any person of any right or
power over tangible personal property incident to the ownership
of that property."
How, Section 3 of the Illinois Use Tax, from its
inception in 1955, has provided for exemptions from the payment
of that tax.

We recite these in our brief.

There are quite

a number, but I would like to call the Court's attention just
to too provisions.
Section 3(c), which states — Section 3 states
the Illinois Use Tax has provided an exemption from the tax,
quote, "to prevent actual or likely multi-»State taxation.
»

The tax

here imposed shall not apply to the use of tangible

personal property in this State under the following circumstances«

28
And circumstances (c) is the use in the State of
tangible personal property which is acquired outside of the
State and caused to be brought into the State by a person who
has already paid a tax in another State in respect to the
sale, purchase or use of such property, to the extent of the
amount of such tax so paid in the other State.
Now,the exemption (d) which counsel alluded to,
the temporary storage one.

Temporary storage in this State

of tangible personal property which is acquired outside of
this State and which subsequent to being brought into this
State

and stored here temporarily, is used solely outside

this State or physically attached to or incorporated into
tangible personal property that is used solely outside of
the State.
Now, on June 3, 1963, the Department of Revenue of
the State of Illinois issued a bulletin which provided in
pertinent part, and I quote again, ’’Temporary storage ends and
a taxable use occurs when the fuel is taken out of storage
and placed into tanks of airplanes, railroad engines or trucks."'
At this point, the fuel is converted into its ultimate use and
therefore a taxable use occurs in Illinois.

If a common carrier

does not have separate facilities for the transferring of the
fuel out of the State of Illinois, but always puts it into the
tank of the airplane, railroad engine or truck for final
consumption, then they no longer will be able to give a

29
certificate to the vendor stating that the fuel is purchased
within the temporary storage provisions of the Use Tax Act,
but must pay the Use Tax to their supplier.
Q

Mr. O'Rourke, suppose the United plane has two

tanks.
MR. O'ROURKE:
Q

Yes, sir.

One is the fuel that’s left over when they land and

the other is the fuel they pick up.

And when they land they

turn on the tank of the fuel that's left over.
on the other tank when they cross Lake Michigan.
happens?

And they turn
What

’
MR. O’ROURKE:

Mr. Justice Marshall, I would like

to make it clear that none of the gas that is brought into
the State of Illinois, in this respect, is ever taxed.
The placing, however, of the fuel into the
instrumentality of consumption, the airplane, then would cause
the tax on the fuel placed into the tank.
The very fact that it would be connected to the
lines and would be capable of being consumed within that
vehicle would subject it to the tax.
Q

Well, suppose they put on the second tank a sign

which says, "Storage Tank."?
MR. O’ROURKE:

Well, I don’t think that the Court

or anyone else, the State, particularly, would be subjected
to the provisions —

30
Q

Ifc wouldn't be taxed if it was put on the plane in

the cargo department, would it?
MR, O'ROURKE:

No, sir, it would not.

If it were loaded onto a storage tank for the
purpose of taking it out of the SSa te to be used 3oleiy out
of the State, and that qualified as a storage tank, as a tank
truck or tank car on the railroad, or —
Q

In the good old days when they first put liquor on

planes, they used to have things on there that locked it up
until after they got through takeoff.
MR. O'ROURKE:
Q

Right.

I recall that.

Well, suppose they put like that on this tank?

Then

what would you do?
MR. O'ROURKE:

If it were still connected to the

instrumentality for consumption, it would be an evasion of
the Retailers Occupational Tax of the State of Illinois.

It

would not qualify for an exemption.
Q

And that means, Mr. O'Rourke, as I understand it »»

your answers to Mr. Justice Marshall mean that your argument
does not depend at all on the premise that any of this fuel
is actually burned within the boundaries of Illinois.
MR. O’ROURKE:

Wo, sir, we do not.

The fact that they exercise dominance or ownership
over that particular fuel in the State of Illinois subjects
them fco that tax.

31
Q

It is when they put it in -MR. O’ROURKE:

That’s one of the events that «e

claim shows ownership of that particular fuel.

From the date of June 3, 1963, to the date of the
bulletin, all fuel loaded aboard United’s planes at the two
airports, was deemed to measure the tax.
And the exemption contained in the temporary
storage provision in question x*as construed as having appli­
cation only if the temporarily stored fuel is transferred out
of the State for use elsewhere by means other than placing it
in the equipment which would consume it.
The first inquiry that we should make becomes
whether upon the facts 3tated there is an event upon which
Illinois may impose the Use Tax without violating the Commerce
Clause.
And we submit that the first of these events is the
storage and withdrawal from storage at Des Plaines, Illinois,
tank.
We quote in our briefs and also counsel for the
opposition, the national Chattanooga and Tennessee Railroad
v. Wallace case,which is cited at 288 U.S, 249.

In this case,

Tennessee levied a privilege tax upon the storage of gasoline
within the State and its withdrawal from storage for use or
sale.
The taxpayer is the interstate rail carrier purchasing

32
large quantities of gasoline outside of Tennessee and trans­
porting it into the State in tank ears, from which it had
loaded and placed this gasoline in storage tanks.
Ail of the fuel that was withdrawn and used by it
as a source of motor power in interstate railway operations
was taxed.
The taxpayer challenged the imposition of the tax
on the basis that it was imposed on the gasoline which was
still a subject of interstate commerce, and also on the basis
that, in effect, the tax was upon the use of gasoline in
appellants interstate business.
In this particular case, the Court held that the
power to tax property, the sum of all the rights and powers
incident to ownership, is that the State can tax the successive
exercise of two of the powers incident to ownership, storage
and withdrawal of storage, both completed before interstate
commerce began.
Now, in the case of Edelman v. Boeing Air Transport
which was discussed, Wyoming imposed a license tax upon the
use of gasoline within the State.
The taxpayer maintained an air service for trans­
portation of passengers, mail and express, in interstate
commerce.
It purchased gasoline from both within and without
the State, which it intermingled and stored in tanks at two

33
airports.
The taxpayer contended that the State could not
validly apply the use tax to gasoline imported from outside
the State, stored in tanks at the airport and used for filling
the interstate planes in which it was eventually consumed.
The tax was applied to stored gasoline as it was
withdrawn from storage tanks at the airport and placed in
planes.
In this particular case, the Edelman case, the
Court upheld the tax upon the theory that a State may validly
tax the use to which gasoline is put in withdrawing it from
storage within the State and placing it in tanks or planes,
notwithstanding that the ultimate function was to generate
motor power for carrying on interstate commerce.
Now, United stores and withdraws at least twice,
once at Des Plaines, Illinois, where it allows the fuel to
become comingled with that of other air lines, and then at
O’Hare where United again withdraws the fuel from storage,
preparatory to loading it aboard its aircraft.
And it has thus committed taxable events or uses
not violative of the Commerce Clause.
Q

Tell me if I am wrong.

If the taxable incident in

the EdeIman case was the storage of the gasoline, is that
right•
M. O’ROURKE:

The withdrawal from storage.

34
As Mr. Justice Blackmun has pointed out, they also

had a temporary storage provision there.

It was the withdrawal

from storage that was the incident of ownership.
Q

Is it your position that Edeiman controls this case,

your case?
MR. O’ROURKE:

I would say so, both Edeltnan and the

Nashville-Cfaattanooga and St. Louis Railroad case.
It appears equally certain that United’s acts
constitute events within the meaning of the Illinois Use Tax
as well.
If we recall the language of the acts, and I quote:
"Use means the exercise by any person of any right or power
over tangible personal property incident to the ownership of
that property."
How, any right or power includes United’s loading
fuel aboard its plane, and the storing and withdrawI from
storage of the fuel.
Hhen the fuel is loaded on the aircraft, It Is
irrevocably committed to its ultimate use.
Now, both in the Nashville case and the Edelman
case, the Courts have held that storage and withdrawal from
storage of gasoline was complete before interstate commerce
began.
It was further held that the burden of tax was too
indirect and remote from the function of Interstate commerce to

35
transgress constitutional limitations.
Now, both the per curiam and the dissenting opinions
of the Illinois Supreme Court agree that the events of
storing fuel in Illinois, or the taking of fuel from storage
in Illinois, are constitutionally taxable under the Illinois
Use Tax, because these events are complete before interstate
cOsrsnerce begins.
Indeed, United, this morning, or this afternoon,
conceded that if temporary storage provisions of the Illinois
Use Tax did not apply to the incidents in question, then it
is subject to the Illinois Use Tax.
United, however, asserts that all fuel placed in
tanks of its planes continues to be exempt under the
temporary storage provision of the Illinois Use Tax Act, and
that the exemption is lost and the fuel subject to the tax
only to the extent of the fuel released from the tanks for
consumption over Illinois«
Now, the statute in question refers to, quote,
’’Temporary storage in this State," unquote, of tangible
personal property and to such property, quote, "stored here
temporarily," unquo te.
The meaning of the term "stored" or "storage" has
been defined as a deposit in

a

store or warehouse for safe­

keeping.
Here, the fuel is not placed in the tanks of the

36

airplane for safekeeping but for consumption, and it cannot
be said the fuel will be solely used outside of the State of
Illinois.
To accept United's argument that the placing of
fuel in departing planes is but a continuation of temporary
storage, and that the burning of fuel in and over Illinois
is a determination of the temporary storage, and the fuel’s
release as the plane operates i3 a local event or use,is
properly taxable, would completely run us afoul of He Ison y.
Kentucky,
And, if United's theory is correct, then each State
could pay the burn-off as the plane — or charge the burn-off,
rather, as the plane crossed over State borders, and this
would then be an unconscionable burden to interstate commerce.
Q

Are you suggesting it could charge a burn-off tax

for just a fly-over?
MR. O'ROURKE:

That's how far the theory, I believe,

could be carried, Mr. Justice, Chief Justice.
Q

Any case gone that far that you know?
MR. O'ROURKE:

No, it has not.

As a matter of fact, Kelson v. Kentucky, which I just
cited and we've cited in our case, was a case where a ferry­
boat was operated between the State of Illinois and the State
of Kentucky.

It went up the Ohio River and gas was brought

aboard the ferryboat in Illinois and as it traversed up the

37

Ohio River, 75% of the fuel was burned off on the Kentucky
border side of the Ohio River.
Kentucky attempted to tax the consumption of that
gas and the Court found that the gasoline, in this instance,
was an instrumentailty of interstate commerce and that the tax
was actually a price on the privilege of using interstate
commerce.
And, therefore, according to HeIson the burn-off
theory as you cross the border would not be carried forth.
Our contention, further, is that the burn-off theory
would equally be an imposition on interstate commerce.
Q

But you say that putting it in the tank does coaimit

it to the use in that airplane, but that is not a commitment
to carry interstate commerce.
MR. O'ROURKE:

That’s before interstate commerce

has begun.
We also say that the taxing event could occur when
they comingle their fuel both at Des Plaines in the storage
tanks and also at O'Hare Airport where they place it in
storage.
These are exercises of ownership according to the
use definition of the statute.
Q

You said that some

commerce was begun.

event ^as before interstate

You mean the loading event?

MR. O'ROURKE:

Yes, sir

38
Q

But the aircraft is in interstate commerce *—
MR, O’ROURKE:

That is true, but according to

the Edeiraan case the loading of the airplane or the withdrawal
of it from the tanks,and the loading of it in the airplane
was done before interstate cornicerce began.
Q

Mr. O’Rourke, why don’t you tax the storage tanks?
MR. O’ROURKE:

We could do that very well,

Mr. Justice Marshall, but we do not do that because of the
temporary storage provision or the possibility that this gas
may be taken out of the State and into another State and It
would, therefore, impose a multi-tax burden upon the user of
the gas.
Once it has been committed to its final use or
the exercise of ownership, then we maintain
Q

—

Then there is no question that this gas is always

used in United planes?
MR. O'ROURKE:

No, it could possibly be taken —

and 1 know of no evidence that was presented — but the
argument was used both in the Lower Court and the Trial Court
and the Supreme Court,that the gas could be taken out of the
storage tanks at o’Hare and transported to Milwaukee,
Wisconsin, for example.

Therefore, there would not be a tax

imposed upon It.
They consider that temporary storage.
Q

It is just a (inaudible) question.

You knew you

39
could do it but you want to be sure.
MR. O’ROURKE:
Q

Yes, sir.

Did your reference to the impropriety of the burn*»

off theory concede

the unconstitutionality of the tax collected

in earlier years, under the old system?
MR. O’ROURKE:

Yes, sir.

Again, we wish to emphasise that the Illinois
Supreme Court so held in Turner v. Wright, which is an
Illinois case, 11 Illinois 2d 161, that the Illinois Use Tax
is a tax imposed on the privilege of use, not on the extent of
the use of that privilege.
The definition of use extends beyond the actual
consumption of tangible personal property, and once you get
into the question of consumption in the use tax, it is then
that you arrive at the ridiculous situations and the undue
burdens.
We feel that many parts of the transaction between
Shell and United are of sufficient local nature that we would
invite the imposition of retail occupational tax on the
transaction.
Q

Mr. O’Rourke, opposing counsel cites Justice

Rutledge’s opinion in the Mippert case in their brief, where,
as I understand it, he said it isn’t enough to just say I am
picking out — for the State to say, I am picking out a local
incident that occurs there.

It still could be a burden on

40
intersfcafce commerce.
You've got to go further than just say an event;,
however small in stature, took place.
MR, O'ROURKE:

Well, our statute does point out that

in the exercise of ownership would permit us to impose the
tax upon that property, provided it does not qualify for an
exemption, provided that there has not been a tax paid on the
property, to avoid the multiple tax situation.
Q

You think that would be constitutional, however

applied?
MR, O'ROURKE:

I believe that there could be

situations where it could be unconstitutional.
Mow, ne recognise the right of Shell and United
to enter into any contractual arrangement that they may want
to, but such contractual arrangements cannot serve to defeat
the right of the State to tax parties or events taking place
within the State.
Otherwise, an unfair advantage would inure to those
having out-of-State storage tanks and that it would relieve
the parties of the obligation of the retail occupation tax
and the use taxes by the terms of their contract.
This would be discriminatory to those who do business
in Illinois and would destroy the accepted purpose of the Use
Tax Act which was designed in part to negate an unfair ad­
vantage over local business who are obligated to pay the retail

41
occupation tax on fuel.
And we have examples of this occuring at O’Hare
Airport, where other air lines come into the airport and
they buy or purchase the gasoline directly at the airport
and they are charged or responsible for paying a retail
occupation tax.
Now, the Illinois Use Tax was designed to complement
the Retail Occupation Tax Act, and in the decision of Turner v.
Wright, it was held not to be discriminatory in that the use
tax is imposed at the same rate as the tax under the Retail
Occupation Tax Act,
It does not apply to out-of-State transactions that
would not measure a tax under the retail Occupation tax if
the event had occurred in Illinois.
Nor is it applicable to the use of property purchased
outside of Illinois on which a sale or use tax lias been paid
in another State to the extent of the tax so paid.
Q

If Shell*s facilities were in Chicago Heights instead

of Hammond, you wouldn’t have this problem because you would
simply directly tax the sale.
HR. O’ROURKE: You would directly tax under the
Retail Occupation Tax Act.
Q

The Retail Occupation Tax, as you call it, is

what is generally known as a sales tax, is it not?
MR. O’ROURKE:

In other States.

We don’t like to

refer to it as a sales tax.
Q

Ho.

For various reasons «»

But it is what is in other States known as a sales
tax.

4% of the —
MR. O'ROURKE:

4%.

And if it occurs in a

municipality*** by example, other air lines coming into
Chicago,actually pay a 5% tax because they are responsible for
the municipal retailers occupational tax, as well.
Q

That's a long circumlocution
MR. O'ROURKE;

—

Yes, sir.

Mr. Berena pointed out that the Use Tax Act came into
effect in 1955, two years after this type of operation had
started with Shell Oil.
I would like to respectfully point out, though, that
the Retail Occupation Tax Act was passed in the State of
Illinois in 1933, many, many more years prior to the contractual
arrangements between Shell and United.
We maintain, if the Court please, that the imposition
of the Illinois Use Tax on United's exercise of Its right or
power over tangible personal property **- and this is the fuel
-«* incident to its ownership of that property in Illinois, does
not discriminate against interstate commerce since it neither
imposes a tax solely on interstate commerce,nor imposes a
higher rate of tax on interstate commerce, nor subjects interstate
commerce to the multiple tax burden.

43

And it is upon this argument, and the arguments
which we have submitted in our brief, that we respectfully
urge this Court to affirm the judgment of the Illinois Supreme
Court.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

I think you have used

all your time, Mr.Serene.
The ca3e is submitted.
(thereupon, at 1:59 o’clock, p.m., the oral
arguments in the above-enfcitied case were concluded.)
