MR. ZELL:

me clear it up a little bit, your Honor.

Let

At the time of the

second trial — We now have a bifurcatory trial in Georgia.
We have guilt and innocence, then we have a sentencing or
punishment phase if you stand guilty.

At the time of both

Mr, Chaffin's trials there was not this.

They tried guilt

and innocence and punishment at the same time.

So the judge

charged the jury on guilt and innocence and he also charged
the jury on sentence, all in the same set of instructions, you
see.

So in charging the jury prior to the instructions, I

said, "Your Honor, if the jury does find him guilty, would you
include in your charge they can give no more than 15 years,
what h© got on the first trial?"

The judge refused the

instruction.
QUESTION:

What was the charge he gave?

MR. ZELL:

The standard sentence of life or death.

QUESTIONS

Georgia

They said, you can't do it.

Manslaughter was the most he can

We are talking here about punishment, not about crime,

7
which apparently there is a difference.

Now,, the lata Justice

Harlan, Mr. Justice Marshall, Mr. Justice Douglas say that
double jeopardy applies to punishment as well as the crime.
I have taken this attack as well and have- accepted it, naturally.
I also argue due process and equal protection.
After the conviction of life I went to the Georgia
Supreme Court and they affirmed it, again citing & previous
Georgia case.

I then went into the Federal District Court in

the second go™around and Judge Sidney Smith affirmed it, denied
the writ.

Then X went to the Fifth Circuit.

affirmed.

X lost in four courts and I am now before this

Court.

The Circuit

I didnst get a dissent yet.
I would like to then get into the constitutional

questions involved here.

Very shortly, of course, it's the

right, of appeal, obviously.

If a man gets a sentence, if he

gets a high sentence, of course, he has less to lose.

He will

appeal if he gets a life sentence certainly, or certainly a
death sentence.

But if the man gets one or two years — now,

for example, rape in Georgia is anywhere from one year to 20
years, life or death.

If a man gets one or two years on a

rape charge or a robbery charge, which is anywhere from one
to 20 years, life, or death, or burglary which is one to 20,
forgery is 1 to 10, theft or ... i3 one to ten.

So if a man

gats the low end of a sentence, one or two years, there is
this threat by the State, it’s an implied threat obviously,

8

that if you appeal on a retrial, we will go for the maximum
sentence.

This is a built-in threat, it's not an expressed

threat, it's an implied threat, not to appeal.
How, I think in any system of justice, we should
encourage a man to exercise his rights, whether it. be for
jury trial or for an appeal.

And we should encourage an

So your answer is yes.

MR. ZELL:

That's correct.

But that isn't Pearce, is it?

Well, no, you weighed a different problem

Now, this Court struck down that provision

MR, ZELL:

That's a possibility, your Honor.

QUESTION:

Isn't it more than a possibility?

Isn't

it a real probability over which some public defenders are
somewhat concerned?
MR. ZELL:

Yes, your Honor, but I would hop® judges,

in their fairness and honesty, compassion, will set a sentence
in line with the crime.

I think our whole legal system is

based on fairness and justice.

I'd like to think that a

judge —

On that basis there is an argument for

permitting the sentence to be increased later.

I mean, after

all, the system is supposed to be right.
MR. ZELL:

Yes, your Honor.

QUESTION:

It's supposed to match the penalty to the

crime, you say.

So the question should be not whether it's

higher or lower than the first time, but whether it’s on its
own basis all right.
MR. ZELL:

But you raise the proposition, what is

the State's interest in increased penalty?
policy?

What is the

Why should a State —
QUESTION:

You just stated it.

You just stated it.

MR. ZELL:

I see very little, if any —

QUESTION:

No, you just stated it, that the

sentencing should be rational, it should b© based on the facts

11
of the case.

So your question should consider the sentence

at the second trial on its own two feet without regard to the
first.
MR. ZELL:

But, of course, then you place — the man

is going to appeal his first conviction, is he not, and then he
won't appeal it, because he is afraid of an increased sentence,
if he got a particularly low sentence the first time.
QUESTION:

By the way, Jackson just set aside the

sentence, not the conviction.
MR. ZELL:

That's correct.

All I am asking in this

case is to reduce the sentence, I'm not asking to set aside the
conviction.
QUESTION:

Are you going to try to bring this case

within the principles stated in Pearce?
MR. ZELL:

Well, there are words in Pearce that are

very helpful to this case about the right to exercise due
process, the right to appeal, that you shouldn't be worried
about getting an increased sentence.

You could certainly use

that to “~
QUESTION:

Did the jury know anything about the

first trial?
MR. ZELL:

No, they did not.

Now —

Was there any possibility of vindictiveness?

MR. ZELL;

There is none, obviously not.

Can the prosecutor

argue about the sentence in Georgia?
MR. ZELL:

In the sentencing in the case in trial

he argues for a greater sentence to the jury.

Yes, ha does.

He argues for —
QUESTION:

Does that have any effect, do you suppose?

MR. ZELL:

I am sure it doss occasionally.

They

hope it does, I think, the prosecutor.
3ut let me say this —
QUESTION:

And the judge knows about it, doesn't he?

MR. ZELL;

Yes.

We have different judges, by the

way, which makes no difference.
QUESTION:

How about the prosecutor?

Is he the same?

MR, ZELL:

I think the prosecutor was different,

the judge was —
QUESTION:

Certainly the file was the same, though.

Everybody knows that he was tried first.
MR. ZELL:

That's correct.

QUESTION:

Except the jury.

MR. ZELL:

Except, the jury, that is correct.

QUESTION:

Did I understand you to say that this man

13
was tried before the bifurcated trials?
MR. ZELL:

Before.

That’s correct.

QUESTION:

So he wa3 tried all at once.

So that the

prosecutor is considerably more inhibited in a single trial
than he is in a bifurcated trial when you coma to the sentence.
MR. ZELL:

That's correct.

In a bifurcated trial

you can present more evidence as to sentence.

We have a

complete statute on what, evidence is admissible in a sentencing
phase trial.
QUESTION:

Did the prosecution go for death in the

first trial?
MR. ZELL:

No, they didn’t.

The judge obviously knows your prior conviction, he

So

we considered this, by the way, waiving his right to jury trial
in the second trial.

We considered that.

He asked me my advice,

I remember, prior to the

trial, what should we do, would I get an increased sentence?
I told him I couldn’t answer that question, I didn't know, the
law was unsettled.
Toward increased sentences and life to death, four
States do not follow Stroud, and apparently three do.

Iowa

in 1926 allowed a sentence to go from life to death on the
second trial and the man was executed.

The same in Louisiana.

I think Massachusetts in dicta said they would allow going from
a life sentence to death.
Now, whether we are talking about going from five
years to 20 or going from life to death, I think this just

MR. ZELL:

Yes, your Honor.

I better not say that.

I don't know.
QUESTION:

Was there a full transcript of the trial?

MR. ZELL:

Mo, there was no record made in this case

and let me explain why.

When I filed the writ the second

go-araund in the Federal court before Judge Sidney Smith, ho
just asked for briefs, he did not allow anything in the record.
QUESTION:

No.

Is there a transcript of the State

court trial extant anywhere?

Does one exist?

MR. ZELL:

Yes, on both trials, they do exist, sir.

QUESTION:

QUESTION:

They may have been, but they may not have

MR. ZELL:

actual trials were transcribed to show that the evidence was
exactly the same.

penalty, because when I went out in the corridor of the trial,

QUESTION:

MR. ZELL:

Yes, your Honor, very definitely.

The

question we are faced with here, of course, is does this chill
your right of appeal?
QUESTION:

Well, supposing the prosecuting attorney

thought that the 15 years sentence awarded at the end of the
first trial was a vary just and proper one and he wanted to get

just that again, if he has any sense he's not going to ask the
jury for 15 years.

He’s going to ask them for something more

are the jury will split it.

That's absolutely correct.

If you’re not going to argue vindictiveness, you're talking
about the rights of, you know, somebody who isn’t here, some

It bothers the defendant when he made that

MR. ZELL:

I don't accept that principle because it

Yes, you do.
Well, I'm going to go to trial.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Zell.

Mr, Hicks.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD E. HICKS, ON
BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. HICKS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I think the question we have here is a very narrow
one relative to the Pearce due process question.

I believe

this Court has held in Stroud, Pearce and the Colten cases
that neither double jeopardy or equal protection impose an
absolute bar to a higher sentence.

So I think we are limited

27

in this case to the narrow question of whether or not a jury
can impose a harsher sentence on retrial.
involved here is the Pearce case.

And the authority

And as the Fifth Circuit

read the case and as I read the case, and hopefully as the
Court wrote the case, that was based on the due process
argument, requirement, that a prisoner should be free from
apprehension that should he appeal, he might receive a higher
sentence solely because he appealed.

The judge is saying,

you appealed my ruling, my sentence, well,I am going to show
you.
Now, we just don't have that with juries.
not the same motivation there.

There is

There is just no vindictiveness.

A judge has his career to look after.

Perhaps, as in. Georgia,

he runs for election.
QUESTION:

What are the odds in Georgia that the

jury would be — or do you know — about the jury giving death
if the prosecutor doesn't ask for it.

Or is it wholly out of

the hands of the prosecution?
MR. HICKS:

Well, we don’t ask for it.

It's on the

statute books.
QUESTION:
MR.

HtCKS:

QUESTION:
MR. HICKS:
QUESTION;

That's what I mean.
It's not up to us to decide.
The prosecuting attorney can
Well, he can, yes.

(inaudible)

He can say —

He can, but sometimes he doesn't.

28

HR. HICKS:
QUESTION:

Sometimes he doesn't.
Does he say, "Now, I don't think for a

moment that, death is appropriate in this case?"
HR. HICKS:

Well, what I have said myself many times

when the death penalty was in existence —
QUESTION:
MR. HICKS:

You're not asking for it.
I would say, "Well, we will waive the

death penalty, but we are not going to waive anything else."
QUESTION:

Yes.

So you do have a choice as to what

you say to the jury about it.
MR. HICKS:
QUESTION:

Yes, that's correct.
In your experience, has a jury ever given

death if the prosecution doesn't ask for it?
MR. HICKS:

They have never given it when I was

trying a case.
QUESTION:

whether you asked for it or not.

MR.HICKS:

Right.

QUESTION:

When you say we are waiving the death

penalty, what's the nature of the instruction that the trial
judge —
MR. HICKS:

Just doesn't, charge on death.

QUESTION:

Well, here —

QUESTION:

He doesn't?

MR. HICKS:
QUESTION:

No.
If you don't ask for it —

t

MR. HICKS:
QUESTION:

29

That’s been my experience.
Then, assuming these-allegations in

paragraphs 2 and 5, or 2 and 7, of this petition for habeas
are true, then it would appear that the prosecutor must have
asked for the death penalty since the trial judge charged
at both trials on the death penalty.
MR. HICKS:

It would appear from that — I will answer

the question that was asked Mr. Zell.

The arguments are not

They may have been recorded, but they are not

transcribed.
QUESTION:
MR. HICKS:
QUESTION:

But the instructions are.
The instructions, yes.
Now, did the judge instruct them on the

death penalty in the first, trial?
MR. HICKS:

I don’t knot*.

QUESTION:

It's alleged here in one of the allegations.

MR. HICKS:
QUESTION:

Right.
Or if he did, then the prosecution must,

have asked for it.
MR. HICKS:
QUESTION:
MR. HICKS:

Yes.
In both trials.
Not necessarily.

Perhaps they just

didn't waive it.
QUESTION:
closing.

I see.

Oh.

You mean not addressed it at all in

30
MR. HICKS:
QUESTION:

Right.
If th-3 prosecution doesn't expressly

waive but doesn't expressly argue, then does the trial judge
charge on it?
MR. HICKS:
QUESTION:

He normally charges it anyway.
And he did charge life imprisonment.

MR. HICKS:

Probably he would charge death, life,

or one to 20.
QUESTION:

I’m talking about in the second trial.

MR. HICKS:

He charged death, he also charged life,

and he charged one to 20 in both trials.
QUESTION:

What would be your objection to him

saying that in this particular case the heaviest sentence you
can give is 15 years?
MR. HICKS:

Well, I think the problem with that is

then the jury says, well, that’s the top.
to give him the maximum.

Maybe wa don’t want

As they said in this case, they

said, we want to give him life and we will give it. to him.
But they say that 15 would be the top limit, so they might
come down a little.
QUESTION:

Well, if Pearce means what the petitioner

here says, it is the top.
MR. HICKS:

Wall, if there is vindictiveness, that's

the way I read Pearce.
QUESTION:

That's what I mean.

So that he could

31
thsn say 15 is the most he can get.
MR. HICKS:
QUESTION:

He could say that.
Tell me, Mr. Hicks, may a trial judge

when the jury brings in life, as in this case, say, well, no,
I v/ill cut. that back to 30 years, or 15, or something?
MR. HICKS:
charge.

No, he can't do it on the life or death

He could on a less sentence.
QUESTION:

That is if it. were brought in 20’ years

by the jury, he could cut. it down to 10?
MR. HICKS:

That's correct.

*

QUESTION:

But he can’t cut either life or death.

MR.HICKS:

That's correct.

-That’s cited in our

brief, the code section.
QUESTION:

Now, do I understand that the instructions

of the trial judge to the jury in the second trial are
available, have been transcribed and are available?
MR. HICKS:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

Would you have any objection to submitting

MR.HICKS:

No, sir.

QUESTION:

Get us that on both trials.

MR.HICKS:

Yes, both trials.

QUESTION:

Did I further understand that the

arguments to the jury, at least by the prosecutor, are not
available or cannot be made available?

32
MR. HICKS:

They were not transcribed.

I know that.

Whether or not. they were taken down, I don't, know, but I could
find out.

Yes, sir.
You weren't in the trial of the case, I

MR. HICKS:
QUESTION:

No* not that case, no, sir.
So you don't know what the posture of

the prosecution was at either trial with regard to the death
4

penalty?
MR. HICKS:
QUESTION:

Well, I do know off the record.
Well, you do know that at least the

prosecution didn't waive it —
MR. HICKS:
QUESTION:

He didn't waive it.
— in the second trial or the judge

wouldn't have instructed on it.
MR. HICKS:
QUESTION:

That's correct.
And he didn't waive it in the first

trial.
MR. HICKS:
QUESTION:
MR. HICKS:

That's correct.
oh, no, you don't, know that.
It's fact.

33

QUESTION:

Oh, yes,

MR. HICKS:

I know he instructed it because I have

the instructions.
QUESTION:

But. you don't knew whether the prosecutor

addressed the jury in either instance as to death.
MR. HICKS:

That's correct.

I don't know from the

record because we don't have the record.

Now, personally, the

prosecutor's office is right next door to mine and he has
told me that, he asked for it.
QUESTION:

How about, the first?

MR.HICKS:

Both.

The facts in the case (inaudible)

He asked for it in both cases.
QUESTION:

I see.

I see.

QUESTION:

And there was a proper instruction in the

second trial by counsel for the defense, was there not, asking
the court to instruct the jury that 15 years would be the
maximum they could —
MR. HICKS:

Well, that's what he said.

I assume

that's true.
QUESTION:

Well, would that b© a matter of record

also?
MR. HICKS:

I don't, remember reading that myself, so

I can't say.
QUESTION:
you submit that to

He can come out with the same amount.

But the first two possibilities, that is,

that he will be found not guilty or he will get less time
seem to be the more reasonable predictions of what will
happen, because the second time around, the prosecution, I
can tell you, has a hard time getting the witnesses the first
time and the second time it's even harder to round up your
witnesses.

This is the only case I have seen that,

not that big a scare.

But it's really

They all want to appeal.

It seems to

me that the majority of them want to appeal anyway, no matter
what their sentence is.
Now, Mr. Zell in his brief in his argument seems to
say that we are limited to that first sentence, that first
sentence is the best, I guess.

But really, w® don't claim

that the first sentence is anything particularly significant
or holy about the first sentence.

Perhaps the jury in jury

sentencing didn’t have all the information that the second
jury had.

And what w© are looking at really is justice, what's

right in a particular case, a particular sentence in a
particular case, what will bring about rehabilitation in this
person if he is rehabilitatable, or what punishment is due if
punishment is due.
QUESTION:

Do you agree with Mr. Zell that, the

records are practically identical?
MR. HICKS:

No, I don’t.

The first time around the

defendant, had purely an alibi defense.

He said he was in

Warm Springs at the time this crime was committed, and he
presented an alibi witness who said he was in Warm Springs.
That was his defense.

The second time around — now, of course,

36

the State’s case was the same.

We had the same victim, the

same outcry witnesses, and things of that, nature.

But the

defendant the second time around said ~~ he didn’t present
his alibi witness, he just said, "I wa3 in Warm Springs and I
didn’t do it."

Then he also presented a psychiatrist and a

psychologist who said that h© didn't know the difference
?

between right and wrong, the McNaughten rule, and he wasn’t,
guilty for that reason.
On rebuttal the prosecutor put up a doctor who
examined the defendant within 4 ox* 5 hours prior to the
commission of his crime and said he was perfectly fine.

The

defense psychiatrist and psychologist, didn’t, examine him
until S months after the commission of the crime before the
trial.

So it would seem to a reasonable person sitting on

the jury that a doctor who examined the man within hours of
the commission of the crime would seem to have more credibility
than a doctor who examined him some 9 months later.
QUESTION:

Would you see that as a rather remarkable

coincidence?
MR. HICKS:

It is remarkable.

unbelievable the way it happened.

It's almost

The victim in the case

lived in an apartment downstairs from the apartment where
the defendant lived and they were neighbors.

The husband of

the victim took the defendant to the doctor on the day this
crime was committed.

When he came home from the doctor, he

37

droppad by to sea the victim and thank her for her husband
talcing him to the doctor.

And for some reason he then

proceeded to strike her in the head, knock her down, take
a tee shirt and choke her.

The next thing she remembers is

waking up in the woods in Clayton County some distance away
where she had been brutally beaten, some object had bean
used on her to sexually molest her, and she was terribly
molested and beaten and spent some considerable time in the
hospital.
Now, that doctor, we managed to find out who that
doctor was that the victim's husband took the defendant, to the
date of the commission of the crime.

And as I understand,

Mr. Zell was surprised when that, doctor showed up on rebuttal
testimony.
QUESTION:

That, would be reasonable grounds for

surprise, under the circumstances.
MR.HICKS:

So for that reason, even if we are talking

about the Fearce plea of vindictiveness rule under the judge
theory, then we think there is reasonable grounds to see that
there was some different evidence before this jury to give
more time than the first time around. And primarily we say
that the Pearce rule of looking for identifiable characteristics
after the first trial doesn't apply here because a jury just
doesn't apply vindictiveness, they don’t have the same
motivation.

A judge is trying to look out for himself.

MR. HICKS:

That's correct.

QUESTION:

MR.HICKS:

It was used here as a matter of fact.

QUESTION:

The jury must have known then there was

a previous trial.
MR.HICKS:

Yes, they knew there was a previous trial,

but not a previous conviction or what the previous trial said.
QUESTION:

Now

,

what are the odds,

really, if

there was a previous ferial, there was either a conviction -the odds are that there was a conviction that was set aside
or there wouldn't be a second trial because of double jeopardy.
MR. HICKS:

I wouldn't agree with that.

There are

many mistrials in Georgia, many more mistrials than retrials,
I will say that.
QUESTION;
what had happened?

So the jury would be confused about

HR. HICKS:
QUESTION:

They would be, yes.
At least you couldn't Infer that the jury

knew that he had been convicted and moved to sat aside his
trial.
MR.

HECKS:

QUESTION:

I don't think you could, no, sir.
Or if they knew that, would it be likely

that they knew the precise sentence that had resulted?
MR.HICKS:

That sentence would not. be admissible

in Georgia, to say what the prior sentence was.

They just

wouldn't know that unless it was a highly publicized crime or
something.

Then they might know.

And in a situation where

they would know in a highly publicized crime, or if it. should
come out in the trial, then the Pearce rule to show vindictive­
ness could be applied to the jury.

But in the general run of

the mill cases where the jury does the sentencing, the Pearce
vindictiveness rule would just not apply as far as we are
concerned, and that is what the Fifth Circuit has held also.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.

REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF GLENN ZELL
OF BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ZELL:

Let me just say this.

My defense was

apparently impeached quite a bit by my doctors and this other
witness.

He really had just seen him and said, "He appeared

to be O.K. to me,K which you could think your're Napoleon

40

and somebody might think you're O.K. just, for a few minutes.
But. anyway the evidence was the same as to the crime.
That's the important tiling we are concerned with.
This Court has never commented on or discussed the
Stroud problem, life to death.

We seem to stay away from

that, and that's what I am asking tills Court to da, overturn
that doctrine.

What I am saying is I am agreeing with

Justice Douglas, and I believe Justice Marshall, in their
concurring in the Pearce case.

In balancing the sentence

upward or downward on a retrial, you should favor the
defendant on balance to give him the unfettered right of
appeal.

That's the primary basis of my argument is Justice

Douglas' concurring in Pearce.
QUESTION:

I don't remember, for the record here.

Was the defendant charged with kidnapping as well as assault?
MR. ZELL:

They charged him with many, many other

crimes in other countries.

Clayton County he mentioned, the

adjoining county, he was charged with some sexual act and
other crimes.

I think they were disposed of.

QUESTION:

On this victim or other victims?

MR. ZELL:

No, this victim.

This victim.

And I

think they were disposed of either by a concurrent sentence
of a few years or dismissed.

But the only charge against

him was the robbery case.

what this case was about.

After he knocked her out, he took

41
her car, and that's what ha was charged with, stealing or
robbing her car by force and violence.
But I want to stress the Stroud doctrine, that, is
still alive and that's what I want to se© overturned from
life to death.

That is still with this Court.

It has never

been overturned.
