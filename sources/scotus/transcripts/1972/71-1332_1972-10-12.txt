MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

We will hear arguments

next in 71-1332, San Antonio School District against
Rodriguez.
Mr. Wright, I think you can proceed whenever you
are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. WRIGHT:

Mr. Chief Justice,and may it please

the Court:
I would like to take as the text for my argument
this morning a sentence from an article that Professor Coons
and his collaborators, Sugarman and Clune, wrote last year.
It is cited at page 44 of my initial brief.

They said:

"Of all public functions, education in its goals and methods
is least understood and most in need of local variety,
experimentation, and independence."
That, I think, is wise counsel.
is the argument for reversal in this case.

I believe that
In our view, the

Texas system of school finance, imperfect as it is—we
conceded its imperfections in our brief—the Texas system
does allow for local variety, experimentation and
independence; not as much as I would like it to, but that is
its goal, that is its rationale, and for that reason there
is a rational basis to it, and I will undertake, to develop

4
of course in a moment our view that the rational basis test
is the appropriate test.
%

The view adopted by the district court that there
is a rigid constitutional mandate that the quality of
education may not be a function of wealth, except the wealth
of the state as a whole, in my submission, is based on
educational assumptions about matters that are today not
understood and which educators are not ready to form firm
judgments, and it would seriously inhibit, if it would not
destroy altogether, the possibilities for local variety,
experimentation and independence, of which Messrs. Coons, et
al., quite properly speak so warmly.
Proposition One, the proposition adopted by the
district court in this case, would impose a constitutional
strait jacket on the public schools of 50 states.

It would

mean that hereafter and permanently, or at least until a new
book is written and the Constitution changes again, that all
measurements in terms of education, the public schools, must
be in terms of per capita or per pupil student expenditures,
even though there may be many other things that we ought to
be worrying about in an effort to cure the problems of public
education.
It would not necessarily destroy all local control.
There is the variation presented by Professor Coons and his
associates described as district power equalising.

If

5
district power equalising is consistent with the mandate of
the court below, and the court did not undertake to speak to
that question at all--it left it completely open—-then it
would still be possible for an individual school district
to decide that we want to spend more money here than that
other school district to spend it, and there would be an
elaborate system so that this could be done; and its ability
to do so would simply depend on the tax rate the district
was willing to impose on itself.
taxable property in the district.
control still in the schools.

It would not depend on the
That would leave local

To that extent, it is far

better than any notion of centralised state funding on a
single statewide formula.
But, as we pointed out both in our brief and
particularly in our reply brief, it seems to us if district
power equalising is a viable alternative, that this case has
ceased to ba a case about education at all, that we are no
longer concerned with whether the children in the Edgewood
School District have an education inferior.to those -in Alamo
Heights, because this would still be possible if the voters
of Alamo Heights decided that they would assume a larger tax
burden, tax rate, than the voters in Edgewood.
On the district power equalizing solution, this
becomes a case for the relief of taxpayers rather than a
case to help out school children.

Many of the. writers who

6
support drastic reform and who support reform as a matter of
constitutional judgment have said that the district power
\

equalizing solution would itself be unconstitutional, because
it would make the number of dollars spent on a child
dependent on what friends and neighbors think.

I must say

that in view of what this—
Q

So, there would still be an equal import,

there could be into that?

MR, WRIGHT;

There certainly could be.

In fact,

a whole reason for having district power equalizing would be
to make unequal input possible.
Q

But under the Texas system it is impossible

for some districts to have a sufficient input, even if they
are willing to tax themselves more.
MR. WRIGHT;

To have a sufficient input? was that

your word, Justice White?
Q

Yes.

MR. WRIGHT;
Q

I would not agree with that, sir, no.

Why is that?

MR. WRIGHT;

Because we believe that our state

foundation program has assured to every district a sufficient,
input for an adequate education, and that it has left every
district to decide for itself what if anything more—
Q

So, you think this is really power

equalization that you have now?

7
MR. WRIGIITs
equalisation.
Q

No, 'I don't think that ours is power

I think that ours is a matter of local choice.
You get the same result in the sense that

anything over a minimum—a minimum is guaranteed and districts
may make up their own mind.
MR. WEIGHTs

That's right, yes.

I, of course, do

not think that Proposition One appears in the small print of
the 14th Amendment; so that if the Texas system in this
respect resembles power equalizing, it does not bother me,
but I would think that it should bother my friend
Mr. Gochman and it should bother Professor Coons.

Because I

do not see how the unequal input of power equalising can be
defended if the Constitution says you cannot have an equal
input.
Q

Would you say it would violate the equal

protection clause if in some way a court did decide what was
a minimum level of education, it was found that many districts
in Texas did not come up to that level and could not really
under the formula because the property in tills particular
district is just too limited and the state foundation
program just does not bring it up to a minimum level?
ME. WEIGHT:

I think that would be a much harder

constitutional case for me to defend, yes.

I do not want to

concede that I would necessarily lose it because it is not
my case

8
Q

Apparently then we must decide then whether

it would be—to sustain you we must agree with you that the
foundation program brings it up to a minimum level?
MR. WRIGHTs
issue here.
Q

No, I think that is simply not an

There is hardly so much as an allegation—
If there is a violation if it did not, do we

not have to decide that it does?
MR. WRIGHTs

I do not think you have to decide that.

I am prepared for purposes of the present argument, Justice
White, without foreclosing what I may say the next time I am
up before you on a different case, to concede that there is a
constitutional minimum that could be required.

I think that

there were certainly overtones of that in Yoder last term
when the Court talked^about a basic education and quoted what
Thomas Jefferson had to say about it and things of that sort,
so that I can understand what to me is a viable constitutional
argument, that a minimum education is required.

But I do not

think there is any issue between -the partias in this case
on whether or not Texas is providing a minimum education.
Q

You mean, in effect, if it is not conceded,

at least it is not denied, that the present foundation
contribution to the local schools is sufficient to provide
an adequate education?
MR. WRIGHTs
not denied.

That is my understanding, that it is

I certainly would not want to put words into the

9
mouths of my friends.

But their pleading is not drawn on

the theory that the foundation program does not give Edgewood
enough.

Their theory is that it does not give Edgewood as

much as hlamo Heights and that there is the constitutional
violation.

And that is certainly the constitutional

violation found by the district court.

The district

court

raade no finding that we fall below whatever the constitutional
minimum may be,
Q

One difference, though, between the power

equalization and your system is that under power equalization
if a district chose to tax itself at a higher rate, it could
get more money even if it was poor in property?
MR. WRIGHT:
Q

That is right.

Not so under the Texas system now?

MR. WRIGHT:
Q

That is right.

Each district would have the same,row to hoe,

so to speak, in raising that additional money under power
equalization, which it does not have now?
MR. WRIGHT:

I,would not want to accept that

entirely, Justice Rehnquist, because power equalizing is
*

always put in terms of the taxable property par pupil.

And

it seems to me that in terms of what row you have to hoe in
order to put a tax rate on yourself, it is really your
inccxne, your ability to pay, that is important.

In a wealthy

district, the same rate would foe a much smaller proportion of

10

income.

So that in that sense, in terms of the marginal

utility of the dollar, it would still be easier for wealthy
people to vote to spend more money than it would for poor
people to do so.

But, as Professor Coons says in his book,

this is a point on which pragmatism must triumph over
principle.
Q

Do you know of any case in this Court which

Sias ever held that it would be unconstitutional for a state
simply to get out of the business of public education bag
and baggage?
ME. WRIGHT:

I know of no such case, and I would

say there were certainly strong implications in the Prince
Edward County case that a state could do exactly that if it—
Q

Then why do you say that a minimum education

may be a constitutional requirement if a state could get out
of it entirely?
MR. WRIGHT:

my concession

X, of course, you recall, sir, made

entirely in terms of this case.

X think r can

safely concede it here, but I do not have to take on that
argument in order to win this case? even if a minimum is
constitutionally required, Texas wins here.

I must say I am

attracted, Justice Rehnquist, as a scholar to the argument
that if might be, despite the intimations of your previous
cases, that today the failure of a state to provide an
education altogether would inhibit the First Amendment rights,

II
that a state has an obligation to teach children to read and
to write.

I do not know that I would accept that argument,

but I can see the possibilities of sketching out an argument
of that kind.
Q

In the past two or three years, did not

Mr. Justice Black in one opinion, whether part of the holding
or not, did he not say pretty flatly a state could close all
its schools if it wanted to?
MR. WRIGHTs

I think he said something of the sort

in Palmer \r, Thompson, the swimming pool case—
Q

Is there a question, hox/ever, that once the

state undertakes to furnish education, then it must furnish
a certain minimal adequate education for everybody?

Once

they start to go dawn that row, they must follow through.
MR.. WRIGHT:
everybody, yes.

We certainly must do it for

If we are going to do it for any, then we

must do if for every young person in the state.
Q

Would tliat mean that if a county in a state

decided to provide public education, then as a constitutional
matter every county in that state had to do it?
/

MR. WRIGHT:

I would not think so.

t

Constitutionally, as you know, there are many,

12
many decisions that say that county action is state action
from the point of view of the 14th Amendment.
MR. WRIGHT:

Yes, for some purposes they are,

But

whether they are for purposes of the equal protectior.! clause
in this kind of sense, there I would say your decisions are
to the contrary.

They say that to have things different in

one county than it is in another county is not a violation
of the equal protection clause.

Those were not education

cases in which that was being said.

In one of them Maryland

had different penalties in one county for a crime than it
had in another county, and you upheld that and there is a
consistent line of those cases, Justice Stewart.

places assess at 30 percent and seme at eighty and some at
a hundred.
MR. WRIGHT:

They differ very widely in Texas as

they do in most states, Justice Brennan, and I think that if
a state were to adopt district power equalizing, it as a

13
practical matter would have to adopt statewide assessing.

I

do not sea any other way in which the scheme would be
feasible.

Otherwise you simply use a favorable rate,, and

you get more than you are entitled to.

And I think that

demonstrates the further incursion on local government that
the ideas presented here by the Appellees represent, that
very little is to be left of local government if the decision
below is to be affirmed.
We contend, of course, that if we are subject only
to the rational basis tost, that this is not one of those
eases in which we must demonstrate a compelling state
interest in order to justify the results for which we argue,
and justify the state plan.

And we think that there are quite

a number of very recent cases in this Court, some of them
ignored by the lower court and some of them still more
recent, that show exactly that and show that this Court is not
going to impose a constitutional strait jacket on the states
in difficult, intractable questions of social reform, welfare, '
economics, Dandridge, Lindsey, Jefferson v. Hackney, cases
of that kind, and we think this is clearly in the area with
which we are concerned.

The appellees undertake to distinguish

these and to suggest that in soma way the educational needs of
the poor are fundamental, while their needs for food, for
housing, are not.

And, with respect, this is a distinction

that X think simply is not a tenable one, that it is hard to

14
say that a higher salaried school teacher is more fundamental
to a poor child than food or a sound roof over his head.

Mr. Wright, you may

You have 13 minutes remaining altogether.
MR. WRIGHT;

Thank you, Mr. Chief-Justice.

In the time that remains to ms, I would like to
turn for a moment to the factual assumptions that underlie
the judgment below and the arguments of the appellees.

And

I would like to make perfectly clear what our position is
with regard to those, because there is soma suggestion,
particularly in some or the amicus briefs in support of the
appellees, that Texas is asking this Court to resolve the
very vexing questions on the relation of money to quality and
education and on whether or not persons who are individually
poor are likely to be found in school districts that are, in
terms of taxable property, collectively poor.
We, of course, are not asking you to settle those
questions.

Our submission is that these are intensely

difficult questions on which no answers, in the present state
of knowledge, are possible and that this Court should not
undertake to resolve matters on which educators and social
scientists cannot come up with any answers.

We have felt it

necessary to discuss the questions because, as we understand
it, the position of our friends would require to resolve
these issues.

16
The decision below, though it never discusses the
issuef makes the implicit assumption that, in education
money is quality.

The assumption is explicit in the writings

of Professor Coons and his associates and others who have
written on that.

The district court never spoke to it.

But

the district court, looked at figures about numbers of dollars
spent and then announced a constitutional requirement that the
quality of education cannot be allowed to vary except as a
function of the wealth of the state as a whole and thus
implicitly assumed what v/e think no court can safely assume,
because in fact we are very skeptical that it is even true
«

that beyond some minimum quality is money.
The district court did explicitly find that there
is a correlation between poor people and poor school
districts.

The finding of the district court in that regard

is based on the reading of the extremes of the chart that was
offered in evidence.

Its determination in that regard has

been criticized not only in our briefs and in our testimony
at the trial but in the literature.

In our brief we set out

the discussion of the finding on that point by Professor
Goldstein in his article in the Pennsylvania Lav/ Review, and in
the issue of the Yale Lav? Journal that was published on
Tuesday of this v/eak there is a lengthy student note that is
again very critical of the finding in Rodriguez on that
point that appears at page 1312, notes 40 and 41,of the Yale

17
note# and the subject is referred to again at page 1317 of
the Yale note, on v/hy you cannot undertake to conclude a
correlation between .individual poverty and district poverty
on the basis of the kinds of figures that the district judge
relied on.
Me presented also in Our briefs disinterested
studies elsewhere in Kansas and in California that have said
no, this relation does not exist.

The central finding of the

Yale note, based on virtually complete data of the entire
State of Connecticut and on a far more sophisticated
statistical analysis than any 1 have seen anywhere in the
literature, is that there is no such relation in the state of
Connecticut, that indeed the relation tends to be an inverse
one, that it is the poor people who live in the area where
the most is .being spent on education and the rich people
live in the areas where the least is being spent on education.
Q

As I read this record, Mr. Wright, it seemed

to me that the testimony—I am not sure about the findings—
pretty clearly demonstrated there is unequal treatment of
these respondents who are Americans of Spanish ancestry at
educational levels.

Is that any part of this litigation?

yes, Justice Douglas.

13
inequality without regard to whether the particular
plaintiffs were of Spanish ancestry or Anglo or what.

But

the issue is certainly there.
We think that the issue is one that is fairly
readily answered, that although it is of course quite true
that in the Edgawood School District in Bexar County, Texas,
the great majority of the students are of Spanish origin
and not as much money is spent there as in other school
districts.

But we doubt that this would be found to be

true as a general matter.

But the poor school districts

are not that congruent with racial distributions, that it is,
in other words, a happenstance.

We have a case in which we

have particular plaintiffs who are Mexican-Ameriean and who
live in a district with low taxable resources,
Again, on these factual statistical problems, we
think that the state of the literature simply does net
permit the conclusions that are essential to the position of
my friend; and that even if their conclusions were sound, we
still think that our legal argument would have great merit.
But if their conclusions are not demonstrable at the present
fc5,me because they are the essential premises of the results
for which they argue, we think that the inability to
demonstrate the accuracy of these assumptions is fatal to
their case.
Q

1 assume you use the term "state of the

19

literature" in the broader sense of state of the human
knowledge on this?
MR, WRIGHT:

Ye3, yes.

That is exactly the sense

in which I use it, Mr. Chief Justice.

my remaining time for rebuttal.

the Court:
The court below he3.d the Texas system unconstitu­
tional because it distributes educational benefits on the

minority pupils, while the poorer districts are poorer in
income and predominantly minority in composition.

And the

Another one is on page 98

of the Appendix, Plaintiffs' Exhibit 3, which shows that the
correlation is not only on a district basis of minority
discrimination but on statewide, on a statewide basis.
The court further found that there was no rational
or compelling reason that could be offered for this

20
invidious discriminatione

This Court is to decide whether or

not to reverse the lower court and approve District 12 as a
proper basis for distributing public school education.,
The defendants admit that there is a perfect
correlation between the property tax base per student and the
amount of dollars each child gets for his education.
Mr. Justice Brennan, tax rates do vary in Texas.

Yes,

But the

district taxing at the highest rates in Texas get the lowest
dollars per pupil, and the districts taxing at the lowest
rate get the highest dollars per pupil; and we showed it in
exhibits in Bexar County where my clients live, a metropolitan
area, and we showed it statewide.
Q

Mr. Gochman, let me be sure I understand you.

Do you say that there is an inevitable correlation between
district wealth and income of families?
MR. GOCHMAN:

That is not what I just said a moment

The record shows it to this extent, that

as to the poorest districts—as to the poorest districts and
the richest districts, the poorest people live in the poorest
districts and the richest people live in the richest districts,
and in Bexar County it perfectly correlates.
Q

My question is whether this is a necessary

correlation.
MR. GOCHMAN:

No, Your Honor, it is not.

But we

probably would not have a lawsuit if it was not that way,

21
because this kind of discrimination falls most heavily on the
poor.

The poor have nowhere to go.

The Minnesota iron range was the

most comparatively poor range as far as family income was
concerned.

And yet in my day it was the iron range that

had the best schools.

They were the ones with the swimming

pools and the tennis courts and the extra facilities and the
highest paid teachers.

The reason was that the tax rates

up there hit the—
MR. GOCHM&Ns
like that in Texas.

There are probably some accidents

But in the West Orange case, which we

cite in our motion to affirm, we show how they do away with
that happening in Texas by poor people being in a district
that gets all the oil refineries.

What happened in Orange,

the big majority district dissolved itself and then got
itself attached to the poor district, the poor people, with
the great wealth, and attached itself to the district with
poor families and great wealth.

There is some of that in

Texas, but as a whole, and especially at the top and the
bottom, the richest districts have the least poor people and
the least minorities, and the poorest districts have the most
poor

people and the most minorities.

Q

It does not hold true in the middle, does it,

22

at least by one of your exhibits?
MR» GOCHMAN:

It does not hold true in the middle.

But in Bexar County, where my clients live, Your Honor, it
holds true perfectly up and down the line.
Q

Is there an exhibit in the record?

Yes, Your Honor.

students in Bexar County.
Q

Would you carry your general theory across the

state line?
MR. GOCHMAN:

No, Your Honor.

I carry the equal

protection clause to be no; state shall, and it is the state’s
obligation.

The state has set up this school system.

Q

The logic of it, laying aside the 14th

Amendment emphasis on state, the logic of it, however, would
apply across state lines, would it not?
MR. GOCHMAN:
Q

No, Your Honor, I fchink-~

The logic would be military in concept that

you are arguing.
MR. GOCHMAN:
Q

No, I think we

are talking about—

Why should people in Texas, for example, have

better schools than the people in Rhode Island, if they are
better?

I don't know whether they are or not.

MR, GOCHMAN:

As a moral proposition» maybe so.

But this is a state-—it is now a state function» not a federal
function.
Q

I said laying aside that limitation» the logic

of your argument would apply with equal force, whether you
call it moral grounds or totalitarian philosophy or whatever.
May I ask you one other thing:

How would you rate

such items as the need for police protection» fire protection,
public health facilities?

Where would you grade them with

respect to public education, higher, lower, or on the same
level as the functions of state government?

in restricting the poor on travel, the Court said you could

They also agree that these district boundaries
serve no educational function, and they have no rational
basis.

instructional media.

But if you look at Section K of the

statute, it says if you put up the matching funds it
guarantees it.

And that is why Edgewood gets less funds from

the state program than Alamo Heights.
But, in addition to that, what is a minimum?

26

What kind of a morass is Mr. Wright asking you to get into?
What is a minimum?

Is a minimum giving him the second grade

or giving him 12 years when he comes out at the end equal to
an Alamo Heights second grade?

Are we going to have two

classes of citizens, minimum opportunity citizens and firstclass citizens?

I think in Sweatt we took care of that, and

I think in McLaurin we took care of that»

If we are going

to apply equal protection of the lav; to get into minimums,
it is going to get us into a thicket that we have to work
our wav out—
Q

Your answer is,the state contribution does

not provide an adequate education?
MR. GOCHMAN:
that and we proved that.

Yes.

And I say that and I pled

But, additionally, it does not make

any difference?once the state provides the service, it has
to provide it all on equal terms.
Q

Your position then is just straight out that

the state must provide equal input every school district in
the state.

Whatever system they have, whether it is property

tax or any other system, or whatever schema you have, it has
got to have equal input dollarwise per student.
MR. GOCHMAN:

No, Your Honor.

In fact, for example,

take—
Q
two districts?

You can have an overall unequal input into

27
MR. GOCHMAN:
flat based on wealth.

Yes,, Your Honor.

But it is not just

The perfect correlation here is that

the input that you get in is based on what your tax base is
and nothing else.
Q

Let us assume the state just had an income tax,

no property tax at all.

And it just gave one school district

$500 a child and another school district $600 a child.
MR. GOCHMAN:

For no reason?

I wovild say that

wculd violate the equal protection clause.
Q

When could it give one district more than

another?
MR. GOCHMAN:

I would think power equalizing could

be sustained because it does give effective local control,
and it does—
Q

That ends up with wide disparities between

school districts as to what they get.
MR. GOCHMAN:

Yes.

We are not preaching against

disparities in education.
Q

As long as the local people make up their mind

to have it unequal?
MR. GOCHMAN:

As long as there is an equal

opportunity for education.

Or, if there is going to be a

disparity, let it be on a program basis.

If a school says—

if a state says, "We want to subsidize people more that go
into the sciences," and one school is heavy in sciences and

28

they get more from the state because science is more
expensive to teach, there would be some reason for that
diversity.
Q

In power equalisation, if after providing a

minimum education, if a district decided that they wanted to
spend more money on education, they could decide to spend it
is that right?
MR. GOCHMAN:
Q

Yes.

Yes.

By taxing at a higher rate.

And let us assume a district decided

that and they wanted to spend $800 a student, and another
district said, "Well, we just don't believe in education.
We are just going to go to five hundred."

That would ba all

right, as long as the five hundred provided some what you
would say vrould be minimum?
MR. GOCHMAN:

The compelling basis for that, if it

is to be sustained—and I am not preaching for power
equalizing, because that is not what Texas is looking at.
Texas is working on putting in a new program.

But you would

have to compare it to James v. Valtierra, Your Honor and say
that this gives the opportunity, a real genuine opportunity,
for the people in the area to determine their own destiny.
Q

So, you would say that the state may provide

unequal inputs?

And the only way they can get a fair

education is to get out of Edgewood.
Q

There has got to be some consistent principle

that governs the decision rather than just saying this is
really bad and the other would not be quite so bad.
MR. GOCHMAN:

No.

What I am saying is—and we are

getting into the constitutionality or lack of constitutionality
of this power equalising system—

30

Q

Yes, but in deciding a case I suppose it is

important to know, is there any system you can think of that
would satisfy your objections to the present Testas system?
MR. GOCHMAN:
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

Other than just simply state control.

You say

you do not need to go to state control.
MR. GOCHMAN:
looking at in Texas

Yes, Your Honor.

One thing they are

for example is, you take all the non™

residential wealth and you tax it statewide and you tax the
residential wealth on a county-wide basis.

In taxing this

residential wealth on a county-wide basis each district, by
improving its own tax rate, will get itself more money.

But

there is a basis, because pretty well, on a county-wide basis
throughout the state, the residential tax basis will be
equal or the variance will relate to the higher cost of
living.
Q

As I get your position, it is not that just

unequal inputs per se violate the equal protection clause.
So far it sounds like you are saying that the fact that there
are some districts that are locked in is what violates the
equal protection clause.

There is nothing they can do about

having a better education either from the state foundation
program or from taxing at higher rates.
MR. GOCHMAN:
Q

Exactly.

That seems to be your major point.

MR. GOCHMAN:

Could power equalising ultimately produce

Superintendent of the Edgewood School District says he cannot
afford to come near the curriculum they have in this
neighboring school district.

supporting it—there would not be any lawsuit if the facts
were not there.

We say the discrimination is based upon the

wealth of the districts. But we say that that discrimination
falls most heavily upon the poor and the minorities.

And

in that regard and with regard to the racial discrimination,
this is not segregation where you have to prove that the
segregation discriminates.

The discrimination is there on

its face, that the minorities get less both in Bexar County
and statewide.
Q
this

You do not contend, do you, that Texas set up

of discriminating against minorities, do you?

35
MR. GOCHMAN:

I contend that objectively Texas did

what it did, and it could have done something else.

And what

it did discriminates against minorities.
Q

Is that not a great deal like the findings we

had in Jefferson against Hackney where you could say
statistically minorities were discriminated against, but there
was no finding of intent to discriminate?

And as to welfare,

we upheld that.
MR. GOCHMAN:

Exactly.

We have to face Jefferson v.

Hackney, and we say it is distinguished because the
importance of education, because it falls on helpless
children, and because the state created the discrimination.
Q

Does not welfare fall on helpless children too?

MR. GOCHMAN:

Yes, Your Honor.

But on the other

two grounds, the importance of education as it relates to the
Constitution of the United States, and the fact that—I lost
my train of thought on that one.

The importance of

ed^^oation to the Constitution of the United States and the
fact that the state did it, the state made these districts
poor, are two distinctions of Jefferson v. Hackney.
Q

The school districts are created solely by the

state legislature, are they?

the convenience of the state.

The state set up the system for
But the boundaries are

3?
adjusted by a majority of votes of adjoining districts and
by the county board of trustees if it is a county district»
But

the problem is nobody is going to join up Edgewood.

The San Antonio central city district, the evidence will show,
continually took in neighboring districts, but it is not
going to go to the badio, the majority of the people in Tan
Antonio who vote, to take it in.

And, thereby, the San

Antonio Independent School District--the central city
district--has foxir times the wealth per student of Edgewood.
It would injure its ability to teach its present students
by having an election to decide to take in Edgewood and in
chat way the state has locked in Edgewood.
Q

The state legislature, or does any statewide

agency, the board of education or whatever, have any power
to create or to change or adjust the boundaries of the
school districts in the state?
MR. GOCHMAN:

No.

Basically this is the job of

majorities in the adjoining school districts, if they are
independent school districts.

And if they are county

school districts, the county board of school trustees, Your
Honor.
Q

This county is B-e-x-a-r that you pronounce—

MR. GOCHMAN:

County?

Bexar.

It is Bexar, yes.
How many school districts in Bexar

The seven that we name in the

suit—
Q

They do cross county lines?

MR. GOCIiMAN:

Yes, sir.

The seven that we name in

the suit that have 93 percent of the students.
One thing they are asking you to do in this case
is to declare constitutional a system that is based on
money making a difference and giving incentive matching
grants to those schools that have the most money and put up
the most money for education, and ask you to declare that
system to be unconstitutional on the ground that money makes
no difference.

Actually at the trial of this case they all

agreed that money made some difference and money made the
difference.

Nov; they say that a minimum program is enough,

which is admission that money must make a difference, that
there must be a maximum program.
But again I want to go into the fact that Sweatt,
I think, did away with roinimume*

And I want to point the

Court to HcLaurin, because this is what the state did.
it is not what will happen as a result that counts.

And

In

McLaurin the State of Oklahoma said this child shall sit in
the back of the room, this law student shall sit in the back
of the room.

And they wanted to justify it in court by

saying, “Well, nobody else would have sat with him anyway;
so, the statute ought to be upheld because it v/ouidn't be any

39

different if we didn't have it»"

And the court said, "What

the state did is what is important."
I want to say, in concluding, that the San Antonio
Independent School District, the central city district, is a
main defendant in this case.

And they fought us hard at the

trial level, got out on a motion to dismiss; but on appeal
of this case, after seeing the decision of the trial court,
and the equity involved and the vast discrimination, filed
a brief in support of the decision of the trial court.
Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURNER:

Thank you,

Mr. Gochman.
Mr. Wright, you have six minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
Mr. Wright.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

I would like to begin with a further word on the
racial aspects that were posed by Justice Douglas in a
question to me and also in Mr. Gochman's argument.

In

response to that simply quote from the book by Messrs. Coons,
Sugarman, and Clune.

They say—the quotation appears at

page 24 of our initial brief—"It is not surprising that even
the present litigation is understood by many of its close
supporters as a racial struggle.

The fact is otherwise.

There is no reason to suppose that the system of district-

40

based school finance emobides racial bias.....

No doubt

there are poor districts which are basically Negro, but it
is clear alraost by definition that the vast preponderance
of such districts is white."
Q

Is Mr. Gochman bound by that comment?

MR. WRIGHT:

No, but I think that you are bound to

take into account the findings of serious students, such as
Professor Coons, in determining what the 14th Amendment
means on a nationwide basis.

Professor Coons and his

associates have supported that statement, Justice Rehnquist,
by figures showing that in California, for example, 59 percent
of minority students live in districts in which the
assessed values are above the median and therefore, if we
would have strict equalization, they would get less than
even. now.
0

If I had a case here from Texas and was

claiming that Texas had denied the equal protection, I think
that I 'would feel rather strongly that whatever the figures
might show about California, I was entitled to stand on the
record made in the Texas case.
MR. WRIGHT:

Rut I think, with respect, sir, that

in determining the rule of law that the particular facts
about the Edgewood School District or about California or
any other particular place are all merely parts of the
overall mosaic that you must appraise in deciding, Does the

41
Constitution or does it not require this?'
Q

Was it any part of the district court's

rationale in this constitutional decision that this was
racially discriminatory?
MR. WRIGHTS
Q

1 did not think so.

MR. WRIHGT:
effect in

No.

No.

There were allegations to that

the complaint.
I am not here to apologize for the Texas school

finance system, and I have said repeatedly that it seems to
me far from perfect.

I think that the Texas system does

assure, as evidence in the record shows, more than merely a
minimum; it insures a basic education to every school child
in the state, and it then lets districts, if they have
money and want to spend money, go beyond that.

As I

understand the argument of ray friend Mr. Gochman, it would
not matter if Texas were giving each school district in the
state $2,000 per student.

If Alamo Heights were still free

to tax, with its heavy resources, and spend more than
Edgewood was, he would still find this to be impermissible,
although, for reasons that are not persuasive to me, he
regards the same result as quite different if it stems from
district power equalizing than if it comes out of the mere
facts as they are.
I have said several times in my brief—and I want

42
to say here and say with the utmost sincerity—how much I
admire the creative scholarship of Professor Coons and his
associates, my colleague Professor Udali, and others who
have written in the field, and X admire also the devotion
and the ability with which Mr. Gochman has persevered in this
case.

These people have opened the eyes of the whole

country to a very serious problem.

I think that every one

in this courtroom would agree that what we want is better
education for all children and especially for poor children,
that the real differences between us are whether a new
system should be adopted because this Court finds that the
Constitution requires it or whether we look to legislatures
to provide remedies and the difference about whether the
proposals they make would indeed lead to better education
or only more expensive education, whether they would relieve
poor children or only children who happen to live in poor
school districts, and indeed if district power equalizing is
to be taken seriously, whether the remedy that has been
offered hers is not one that is of no benefit to children
but only of benefit to taxpayers.
Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Wright.
