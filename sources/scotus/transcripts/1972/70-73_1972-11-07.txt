MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

-

--

For Counsel in today's

Mr. Justice White is unavoidably absent, but reserves the
right to participate in the cases argued today, on the basis
of the records, briefs, and the tape recording of tne
arguments.
We will hear arguments first today in No. 70-73,
Miller against California.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF BURTON MARKS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. MARKS;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
We are back again before the Court, since January of
this year, to reargue the matter and to discuss with the
Court what one of my colleagues described as the continuing
saga of life in the pits, or \*hat goes on in the lower
courts, because we don't know what, actually, this Court is
saying with respect to the pornographer.
The second proposition that we have for this Court
is that a person charged with the crime of obscenity should
have, perhaps, as much rights accorded to him, or her, as,
let's say, a parolee who is having his parole revoked or
perhaps a juvenile who is being declared a delinquent.
Perhaps I can explain.

As I said,, there is a continuation of horrors.

In

January,. I described to the Court what happened in this case,
what a defense lawyer had to do to go through a trial or
proceeding in order to at least have, attempt to have some
kind of hearing as to whether or not the material was
constitutionally protected. This included pretrial hearings,
in which evidence is presented by the defendant, none by the
prosecution, and a complete denial of any real hearing or
real, in my opinion, understanding by the trial judge as to
what the issues were.
Since that time, to give you an example of what
occurs in the courts below, because of the erratic, if I may
say, types of decisions which emanate from the higher courts
and perhaps the visceral reactions that occur with various
judges, is — I’ve been in three trials since I've seen you,
and this Court, in Weiner vs. California, held certain
material to be protected vis-a-vis Redrup.
Now, the Weiner materials were found in San Diego,
and they involved some motion pictures and some film.

So I

had two trials in Los Angeles, in which I attempted to have
the judge take some recognition of the materials in Weiner,
so there could be a comparison of what was protected and what
was not protected.
Now, the interesting proposition is that the
prosecution —

5

QUESTION: Was this a jury trial?
MR. MARKS;

No, we waived jury.

The interesting proposition in the first trial that
I had was that the prosecution had an attorney who was
reasonably experienced in the pornography field.

This

prosecutor was unwilling to admit to the court, as were the
police officers who are really the experts, because in Los
Angeles they have a vice squad with pornography experts that
travel through the State, and they know what's going on in the
State, and they refused to admit that the materials in my
case were the same as the materials in Wiener, and, as a
matter of fact, refused to take judicial notice of the fact
that they were the same, and there was simply no way to get
the Wiener materials from San Diego to Los Angeles, because
they had been introduced into another case in San Diego, to
try and persuade a second judge that the materials were the
same and therefore protected.
QUESTION:

As I get it, then, the point of your

argument is that, when you said you waived jury trial, you
used that?
MR. MARKS;

In the last — well, the first case I

did, because the judge that we finally got was, in my
opinion, sophisticated enough to understand what was going
on.
QUESTION;

well, was that a matter of trial tactics

6
in defending cases like this, you ordinarily prefer a bench
trial?
MR. MARKS;

No.

Absolutely not.

No.

Because if -

you're allowed to have the procedures which the California
State allows you to have, you have — you should have, under
g

Noroff, a real pretrial hearing to determine whether or not
the material is obscene or not.
QUESTION; Which then ends the whole case?
MR. MARKS; Which would end the whole case, but the
unfortunate proposition is, as I was going to point out, is
that the judges simply don’t follow the law.

They don’t —

perhaps it’s merely a matter of buck-passing, and, as former
President Truman said, the buck's got to stop some place.
QUESTION; But I take it, if there's a determination
of obscenity at this pretrial proceeding, that is not
conclusive, of course, at the jury trial, is it?
MR. MARKS: Well, that's a very interesting question
Of course not.

Of course, that —

QUESTION;

In other words, you may still argue

to the jury the non-obscenity of the material, right?
MR. MARKS:
QUESTION;
MR. MARKS;

Of course.
Yes.
Yes, sometimes what the judges feel

or believe is — and there's soma California case law to that
effect, although it really does not seem to be appropriate,

7

because ordinarily we’re talking about a misdemeanor case in
obscenity.

The only time you get into a felony case is when

it is bootstrapped into a felony by virtue of the charge of
conspiracy,, which makes it a felony, or because the person
has a second offense.
Now, if you have a misdemeanor trial,, there is no
such thing as a preliminary hearing.

So the California

Supreme Court gave misdemeanance in a pornography case,
essentially what might be called a preliminary hearing through
the Norcff case, in which you're entitled to have a hearing
to determine whether there's obscenity.
Now, some judges believe that this only means
probable cause.
QUESTION?

Are misdemeanor cases tried before

MR. MARKS:

Yes. Some judges believe that this

juries?

obscenity issue and determination means only probable cause
to believe it's obscene, so that it will go in front of a
jury.

That is not my understanding of the law, but there’s

no clearcut decision on that proposition.
In a felony case, if you happen to have a felony,
then you have a preliminary hearing and in that preliminary
hearing there is a probable cause situation, to believe that
a crime has been committed.
Again, there is a case out of California called

8
?

Luros, which says that the grand jury does not need any
evidence to make a determination of probable cause so that
the matter can be brought before the petit jury for a trial.
But then we have, again, this intermediate Koroff
step, which supposedly is supposed to have the judge independent!
make a determination of obscenity.
It3s always been my expression or opinion that the
proof of the prosecution as to obscenity in a pretrial hearing
has to be also beyond a reasonable doubt because if it's not
obscene, it can't be prosecuted.
But, as I say, this leaves the law in a state of
flux, and nobody really seems to care.

I was talkinq about

the trial, but what happened was the Wiener •— the two
defendants had been arrested in practically the same situation,
they were the type of defendant that you will ordinarily find
in, as far as I can determine, 90 to 95 percent of the cases
which come before this Court or before any obscenity court,
i.e.,a bookseller, a motion picture operator, somebody who is
in business, not the skulking pornographer who goes out into
the alleys, and calls in the little kids and says, "look at
the dirty pictures"; he's there, he has a store, he has a
business, he has a movie theater, he invites no one in except
by the advertisement.

Generally, if you take a look, for

instance, you open your Washington, D. C., newspapers and
there's advertising for what’s known as adult films.

And it

9
doesn't pictorially describe what's being shown, it qives
the title and the persons itfho are the, let's say, the
aficionados or the ones who want to go to the theaters, know
what's going to be shown in the theaters by the fact of the
title and the place of the theater, and they go and see it.
But I'm talking about the client, the person who is
in business.

He is operating a store.

He buys film.

He

buys books, and he sells it to the persons who come in.
Ordinarily there's no such thing as pandering, as was
described in Ginzburg, simply a police officer walks in,
sees a piece of material that he doesn't think is worthy of
his consideration, either makes an arrest on the spot —
although that is now out in California — but generally will
go back and make an affidavit that he saw a dirty book or a
dirty picture, and he will describe why it was dirty, and
then some magistrate will sign a search warrant and he will
go in and seize that.
QUESTION:

Sometimes —
He doesn't buy the book and then take

that to the magistrate?
MR. MARKS; Sometimes they do, but very seldom.
Apparently there's no enough funds given to the vice squad
to purchase this type of material.

They have other areas.

They generally go in and they look at the pictures.
My two clients happened to have arcades on Main
Street, where you have peep shows, and little motion picture

10

theaters.

The police officers went in, saw the films, went

back, describe what they saw or what they thought they saw,
gave the affidavit to a magistrate, who authorized the seizure.
They came back a few days later, seized the film, took it to
the police station, then had an arrest warrant issued.

Both

clients were charged with felonies because they had a prior
misdemeanor.
QUESTION:

— prosecution or for destruction, or

both?
MR. MARKS: Evidence.
In the first case, the judge, after I had waived
jury and after I had been able to present an expert who had
seen the Wiener material and seen this material which was
called simulated, testified it was exactly the same.

And I

presented to the judge a list of cases, and showed him how
the material was exactly the same.

Finally read the material

and, lo and behold, after an entire trial in which the police
officers had testified in their expertise as to what was
obscene and not obscene, and my expert had shown the
comparison between Wiener material and these materials, the
judge granted my motion to dismiss on the grounds that the
material was constitutionally protected and returned the films
to me,
The next case was exactly the same, it was another
person who had an arcade next door.

I went in to the second

11

judge,. who had never had a pornography case, never had an
obscenity case, but of course knew what was obscene and not
obscene, tried to persuade him that this case that I had
today was exactly the same case as the case 1 had yesterday,
and that in fact the ruling of the judge before was res
judicata, because it wasn’t an acquittal, it was a declaration
of protected material.
The second judge —
QUESTION: Why would that be res judicata under
California law, if the same people weren't parties to it?
MR. MARKS:

Well, it would at least be collateral

estoppel under Ashe vs. Swenson, because the prosecution has
to be estopped from continuing to prosecute something which
they must know is protected.

It was the same district

attorney's office.
QUESTION:
MR. MARKS:

With the same defendant?
No, no, a different defendant, but the

same material.
Now, somewhere along the line, if a defendant or a
person in a criminal case, who is charged with a criminal
offense, must have the opportunity of saying, "Lookit, I am
protected".

Isn't that what "scienter" means?

Doesn't

scienter mean that the person is doing something which he
thinks is all right, or, conversely, if you want to prove
that he had a mens rea the offense, he had to know, or at

12
least have reason to believe that the material which he was
selling or exhibiting or purveying was not protected or in the
realm of hard-core pornography.
But these booksellers don’t know that, because they
get a decision from Redrup, of protected material, and then
down it comes to the lowest court and sometimes even the
highest court, and they say, We don’t believe it; nobody
could hold anything like that to be protected.
QUESTION:

Don't you have a provision for an in rem

proceeding in California?

Proceeding against the material as

such, which would be res judicata, vis-a-vis the State, as
against the material?
MR. MARKS:

No.

There is the aspects of it blowing

in the wind, but it’s not legislative, it would be judicial
because of some recent decisions that came out of the
district court, three-judge court, in the Central District of
California, stating that perhaps the search and seizure
statutes which we have, and the 1538.5 of the Penal Code
which allows for a traverse to a search warrant, although it
doesn't meet the Freedman requirements or the Blount vs. Rizsi
requirements of a fast hearing provided by the State.

At

least one court has said that's sufficient hearing, and you
can probably traverse the search warrant on the basis that
the material was not in fact obscene and couldn’t be
seised because that's the lav/ in the State of California also.

13
If it's protected, it can't be seized.
But the big problem is, how do you get word to the
judge that it's protected?
QUESTIONS

Well, if you did have a panel judqraent

in that kind of a proceeding, I suppose, then, it would be
res judicata that that particular material was protected,
wouldn't it?
MR. MARKS:
QUESTION s
MR. MARKS:

It ought to be.
Yes.
But what happens is that the judge will

say, as he did in the second case, first of all, I don't
these aren't exactly the same materials, so therefore they
must be different, and you can argue all day long that one
portrayal of an act of sexual intercourse is very much like
another act of sexual intercourse.
QUESTION: Well, you're not talking, then, about
precisely the same film, an absolute duplicate, you're talking
just about similarities?
MR. MARKS:

I'm talking about two films that if you

put them back to back and took away the faces of the actors,
it would be impossible to describe any difference in what
was portrayed in the screen.
QUESTION:

But the films, presumably, at least,

were sold under different titles or produced by different
producers?

14
MR. MARKS; Right.

Some of them may have different

titles, but there just is no way -- I recall the old saying,
"you’ve seen one, you’ve seen them both".
QUESTION:

You’ve seen —•

So that determination with respect to the

one would not help you very itmch, would it?
MR. MARKS: Well, it’s got to help somebody.
QUESTION:

Unless it's a copy of precisely the same

film, you wouldn't have.
MR. MARKS: Well, that, I guess, is the big problem.
Because if I see a magazine that shows a picture of a naked
woman, with her legs spread, what's known in the trade as a
"beaver shot", and this Court has said that's protected, and
I see another magazine with a woman with her legs spread and a
beaver shot with a different title and a different woman, I
would like to be able to tell my client:

it's all right to

sell that, because it’s been held protected.
But some courts will say, Why, that's ridiculous,
it's a different woman, and it's a different camera angle,
and it's a different magazine, sc how could the material be
protected?
One of the most beautiful cases in point, and it
was handed to my brother, Mr. Shellow, who will be arguing
later, is the case of Wisconsin vs. Simp3on, out of the
Wisconsin Supreme Court, filed October 31, 1972, and in that
case they had, from what I can determine, magazines with nude

15
persons together, and nothing more, and here is some of the
holdings of the Wisconsin Supreme Court ■— and, incidentally,
I had brought it along and now X don't seem to be able to find
it?in the recent article, the most recent edition of the New
Yorker Magazine, there's a little cartoon and it shows two
gentlemen in black robes strolling along and one of them is
saying, "If it turns me on, it's smut".
So that's about what has happened with the Wisconsin
Supreme Court.

Here's what they say:

"Described magazines are not as a matter of law not
obscene."

This was the contention raised.

"Appellant argues

t hat these magazines cannot be found obscene because only
nudity is depicted, and not sexual activity.

Given non­

obscenity for non-sexuality, argues appellant, these complaints
are not sufficient because they do not allege obscene
depictions of sexual activity.

In support of his proposition,

appellant asserts several Redrup reversals, and certain
language in State vs. Amato."

They go down.

"This court, in Court vs. State, resoundingly
rejected the contention therein presented, that this court is
bound by the decisions in other courts regarding whether
similar magazines are obscene or not."
quotes:

And they put some

"the subjective nature of the steeterial, as well as

the subjective conduct of the respective defendants
requires an individual analysis in each case."

16

A complete rejection by the Wisconsin Supreme Court
of what this Court said in Redrug,, that certain material is
protected.

They say, We’ll tell you whether or not it's

protected; we'll tell you whether or not we viscerally have
that feeling.
Another example of the type of reaction yo\i get from
the lower courts:

The question is, Was the introduction of

the magazines into evidence vzithout further evidence sufficient
to prove their obscenity beyond a reasonable doubt?
And they say:

This Court has repeatedly held that

obscenity is not so aloof a concept as to require expert
testimony.

There is nothing here that warrants any further

consideration of that question, and the evidence in the form
of the magazines themselves was clearly sufficient to prove
obscenity beyond a reasonable doubt.
Do you know how this case went to trial?

They took

the magazines and threw them in to the jury and said: This is
v/hat the man is selling, and, remember, these are magazines of
a man and a woman in the nude — and that’s all they’re doing —
and the court is saying,
going to our own way.
Well,

We will ignore everything, and we’re

What do you do?

—

QUESTION: As I recall, and correct me if I’m wrong,
you urged us on a prior argument that Younger v. Harris was
wrong and that we should overrule it.

You maintain that point

17
now or "~
MR. MARKS z
QUESTION;

Absolutely.
— did 1 —

MR. MARKS s Absolutely.

I mean, assuming that you

can find some judges in the district courts, the Federal
District Courts that will follow the law of this Court, because
you don't always follow that either.

I was continuing my

saga of horrors, with which this Court is very familiar,with
the case where there were 20,000 rolls of film seized in
Southern California, and the district courts held they couldn't
be seized, it was unlawful, and Judge Hanson of the Superior
Court said, pooh on you, in effect, and it went to the court
of appeals; Judge Hanson was never held in contempt, of
course, because judges are immune from that sort of thinq.
And it went through three or four or five respective courts,
finally came up to this Court, which affirmed the district
court three-judge ruling, and finally the films got back after
five or six months, at the most; an extraordinary waste of
time, in my opinion.
Getting back to the initial premise of my argument:
Can’t we give a defendant in a pornography case the same
due process of law that we give a juvenile or that you give a
parolee?

Can’t he have a hearing, such as you said in

MoraIcy, can’t he have the same presumption of innocence,
that is to say,in Winship, you said:

due process says that

18

each element of the offense must be proved by competent
evidence beyond a reasonable doubt.
Well, we have three elements of the offense, we
actually have four.

They were stated in this Court in Roth,

they were stated in Memoirs, and it was just recently approved
by this Court in Raid vs. Washington, which approved Roth and
Memoirs, as to the three elements.
very simple:

And the three elements are

Does it go beyond contemporary standards?

it appeal to the prurient interest?

Does

Is it utterly without

s ocially redeeming value?
Doesn't the prosecution have the burden of proving
those elements, First Amendment elements, beyond a reasonable
doubt under the Fourteenth Amendment, so the defendant can
have a hearing and a trial on it?

And don't they have to

present evidence, competent evidence?
I say that due process says they do.
The fourth element is even more elusive, and that's
the scienter element.

Smith vs. California said you've got

to know what you're doing.

The basic element of due process

of law is that you have mens raa, criminal intent.
people are businessmen.

These

Maybe they're in a dirty business

that you don't like, but, nevertheless, they are in business.
They don't want to violate the law.
QUESTION;

Do you understand Smith v, California

to stand for the proposition that the seller must know what's

19

in the books that he sells, or, alternatively, that the
seller must know that what is in the book he sells is
illegal?
MR. MARKS:

I say that he must know what's in the

book is illegal or probably illegal, because if you just say
you know what's in the book, then you get into the wildest
speculations

does that mean that he knoivs there are some

pictures of nude people?

Does he know it's sexually

oriented?
The Bible is sexually oriented, if you take some
passages.
What do you have to know about the contents of the
book?

I think you have to know, or have some reason to

believe, that he knows that this has gone beyond that which
is legally protected.
QUESTION: That goes a little further than what the
opinion in the Smith case actually said, doesn't it?
MR. MARKS: Well, it goes a little bit further, but.
it has to be a logical and rational extension of that
scienter requirement, because if you don't have that scienter
requirement, you might as well overrule Smith vs. California
and says

anybody who sells a book or who shows a motion

picture that deals with sex is subject to arrest and
prosecution under some standards which were slightly less
than standards which are afforded to most other criminals.

20

1 say, finally, there’s an instruction -that used to
be given, and it still is at times, that says, in the Federal
Court, to the jury?

If he’s guilty, say so? if he’s not

guilty, say so.
I say in this instance, if you’re going to give us
some standards, and you’re going to say that the First Amendment
applies to the States, say so.

And if you’re going to tell the

courts below that they can't seise material without having an
adversary hearing or some sort of hearing afforded to the
person, say so.

And if you're going to say that they can't

prosecute without having a hearing or some determination as to
material, say so.

But at least give us a chance.

QUESTION?

Mr. Marks, what you're proposing is that

there be required, before there may be a criminal prosecution,
some kind of civil proceeding at which the definitive
determination whether the material involved is or is not
obscene? is that what you're talking about?
MR. MARKS: Exactly.

An injunctive type of proceeding.

QUESTION: Which would be conclusive.
Well, what about the — how does that apply in
pandering situations?
MR. MARKS:

I think that if you are — first of all,

I have never seen a case in Ginzburg which has that type of
pandering.

I think that that case is out in left field and

will never happen again.

But if it does happen again, this

21
Court has found ways to get around what has otherwise been
apparently restrictive rules of law.

If the person is

pandering;, and he knows it, the law allows for it.

Thera is

room for all those -- that type of exception.
Thank you.
QUESTION:

Mr. Marks, under your theory, would it fce

permissible for the State to deal with a particular book or a
particular movie in an in rent proceeding, and given a
favorable result to them on the obscenity issue, bind anyone
from thereafter who used it in the State on the issue of
whether or not that was obscene?
MR. MARKS:

No, I think what they must be —■ the.

only thing that they can bind the defendant on in a separate
question is scienter.

After that hearing, no other defendant

can go about and say, I didn’t know it was protected because
the law presumes that everybody else knows the law.
QUESTION: So that even though the new defendant was
not a party to that proceeding, he can't defend on the
ground that it was not obscene?
MR. MARKS:

Oh, he can defend on the ground that it's

not obscene, because —- I would say this, as long as your
procedure is going along, you’d obviously have to have an
in rem proceeding with the right to appeal by whoever is
appealing.

But the question of scienter, knowledge as to

whether it’s obscene, would be withdrawn.

22

Because, don't forget, in an in rera proceeding you
have a judge sitting there, and the judge can rule on the —
I think that the only thing a judge can rule on is whether or
not the book is not obscene.

If he rules that he will not make

such a finding that the book is not obscene, that it is not
protected, then notice is given to the world, as it were, to
the criminal defendants, that this may be the subject of a
prosecution.
Because he can't foreclose by saying that the book is
obscene.

The right of a criminal defendant in a case to have

a jury trial on that issue.
QUESTION:

Then the kind of iri rem proceeding you

contemplate binds the State but not the defendant?
MR. MARKS: Absolutely. And that's the way it should
be.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Capizzi.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. CAPIZZI, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. CAPIZZI:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
With respect to the in rem proceedings, I would
suggest that it is not the ansv/er for, as Mr. Justice Brennan
has suggested, it doesn't solve the question raised by the
pandering concept enunciated by this Court and adopted in

23

California by statute.

Nor does it take into consideration

the definition which this Court has given to obscenity, namely
that to be obscene it must — we must apply contemporary
standards for customary limits of candor.

And as 1 suggested

last January, v/hen the case was argued before this Court,
contemporary standards, if they are contemporary, they are
going to change, maybe from day to day, certainly from month
to month or year to year.

And we're going to have to

constantly reexamine that same book to see whether or not it's
obscene, applying contemporary standards, not the standard
that would apply six months ago when the hearing was held.
With respect to the knowledge that is necessary, I
suggest that the only knowledge necessary is the knowledge
as to what is in the book.

To require that the person

disseminating the material must know that the material is
obscene would be to totally insulate the distribution of this
type of material from any sort of criminal prosecution.
QUESTION:

Mr. Capizzi, I gather that your argument,

because of the aspect of that it must be contemporary,
according to contemporary standards.

That might be an

argument against a particular conclusion of non-obscenity
be binding on the State where the same material was involved
later.

But what about the argument that in any event,

before there should be any criminal prosecution there ought
to be a judicial determination of obscenity or no -obscenity

24

before that proceeding continues?
MR. CAPIZZI:

Of course I anticipate another

problem that that would raise, and that in a civil proceeding
the burden of proof is by a preponderance, whereas in the
criminal proceeding it would be by beyond a reasonable doubt.
So there would be another disparity there.
In effect, at the present time —
QUESTIONS

So that if a finding were in the

particular case involving the dissemination by a particular
defendant, would it matter if the determination were that
it is not obscene, applying a preponderance test?
MR. CAPIZZI:

Well, in effect in California, as Mr.

Marks has suggested, we have what borders on that sort of
procedure.

It's not a civil proceeding as such, but it's

preliminary determination of the constitutional question, the
mixed question of law and fact, as to whether or not this
material is —
QUESTION;

Well, except as I understand Mr. Marks,

at least as to some judges, they apply a probable-cause test.
Iney don't, in fact, make the ultimate determination of
obscenity or non-obscenity, as I thought he told us.

At

least some judges.
MR. CAPIZZI;

Some judges, I feel possibly do that.

They feel that —
QUESTION: Well, what would you -— if you had such

25
proceeding at all, do you think that it should stop with a
probable-cause determination or should it qo on to the make
the ultimate determination?
MR. CAPIZZI:

I think the initial question should be

a probable-cause, determination if we are, in fact, going to
have that determination.

But X would suggest that that

determination that’s made by the trial judge is the same
determination that is facing this Court in each obscenity
case.

And that i£ we adopt a sufficiency of the evidence

test, that that initial determination doesn’t necessarily
have to be made.
That is to say, is it protected in the constitutional
sense as a matter of law; and, if not, then the person is
going to stand trial.
other case:

But merely treat it as we would any

hold the trial, and then, at the conclusion of

the trial, in review, determine whether or not there’s
sufficient evidence to sustain the conviction beyond a
reasonable doubt to a moral certainty.
QUESTION: Well, of course, I gather so far, at
least, our cases have indicated that you don't approach this
on a sufficiency of the evidence basis, it’s a constitutional
determination, and we have a finding, to make the determination
up here.
That's the way we’ve handled it so far, haven't we?
MR. CAPIZZI:

Yes.

X don't know that there is

26

really that much differences, however, between a
QUESTION: Well, I think there's a considerable
difference.

In a negligence case you determine sufficiency

of the evidence, we don't determine negligence up here.
in obscenity cases we do.

But

It's a constitutional determination.

Don't we?
MR. CAPIZZI:

Well, that's true, but it's a matter

of either it is or it isn't, rather than it is by degree.
QUESTION:

I don't understand why, if you're going

to have a civil proceeding, which is to consider the
obscenity of the material for which the defendant is being
prosecuted, why you shouldn't go all the way through and have
a judicial determination that it is or isn't obscene.

Instead

of just a probable-cause determination.
MR. CAPIZZI:

If there is such a civil proceeding

provided for by law, that may very well be what would be
necessary.
QUESTION:

I thought you said California has

something like that.
MR. CAPIZZI: Well, there is a determination that's
made by the judge as to whether or not this matter is
constitutionally protected, in the question of law.

As I

suggested, the question that this Court determines every time
an allegedly obscene book or obscene matter is presented to
it for review.

27

QUESTION: Well, it’s just that I thought Mr. Marks
MR. CAPIZZI:
QUESTION:

It?s not —

•— suggested that practice is different,

at least as it's carried on by some judges in California.
MR. CAPIZZI: Well, I will concede that the practice
does differ among the judges, the trial judges.
QUESTION:

Do you distinguish between probable

cause standard and a civil preponderance of the evidence
standard?

Are they different in California?
Isn't, by its very nature, a probable cause or a

preponderance of the evidence a balance of the probabilities?
and how is that different from a probable-cause test?
MR. CAPIZZI:

I'd say it's probably similar.

The

two •—
QUESTION: They both fall short of the standard of
"beyond a reasonable doubt", don't they?
MR. CAPIZZI:

That's right.

However, in the

procedure that California follows, if we required proof
beyond a reasonable doubt before we could get to a jury,
we would, in effect, be denied a jury trial; and if we proved
it beyond a reasonable doubt to the judge, why is a jury
trial necessary?

Or if he rules — no matter how he

rules, one party to the proceeding is being denied the
constitutional right to a trial by jury.
So I think we have to first determine whether or

28

not this particular matter justifies going to trial.

That’s

the procedure that’s followed in California at the present
time..
That’s the procedure that was followed in this case,
contrary to the suggestion propounded by Mr. Marks, there was
a determination by the trial judge shortly after the arrest
in this case, a determination that this was not constitutionally
protected matter.

That took place in May of 1969.

Mr. Marks attempted to anpeal that to the appellate
department of our Superior Court and the appellate department
of the Superior Court concluded that the trial judge was
correct and this was not constitutionally protected matter.
And it was after that decision by the appellate
department of the Orange County. California, Superior Court
that the decision of the L.A. Municipal Court, which is a
written opinion, and relied upon by Mr. Marks,was signed.
So if there is a docttine of res judicata or
collateral estoppel, that applies in this case, the initial
decision was the judge who heard the matter in this case and
concluded this was not constitutionally protected material.
And the trial judge in Los Angeles County should
have been bound by that determination as opposed to Orange
County being bound by thr later decision of the L. A.
Municipal Court judge.
The case was tried, evidence was produced, and the

29

jury was instructed on the basis of a Statewide standard
for customary limits of candor, and it was on appeal for the
first time that appellant suggested that a nationwide standard
should be adopted and applied.

This was after he had produced

evidence and concurred in instructions to the jury that a
Statewide standard should be applied.
QUESTION:

That’s the phrase that’s used in

California generally in jury instructions and court opinions,
$

that the measure is the customary limits of candor?
MR. CAPIZZI:

Yes, the material must go substantiali

beyond applying contemporary standards, it must go
substantially beyond customary limits of candor.
QUESTION;

Of candor?

MR. CAPIZZI;
QUESTION;

Yes.
"Candor” means honesty.

MR. CAPIZZI; Honesty, frankness, purity.
QUESTION;

Is that test used in other First

Amendment areas in California?
MR. CAPIZZI;

Yes.

As to all allegedly obscene

material, that’s the test that is applied to determine
*(

whether or not it is -QUESTION; But beyond obscene materials, in any
other case involving a First Amendment claim, if it goes --- if
it's too honest, is it illegal?
MR. CAPIZZI;

No.

I think it is a term that is

30

exclusively used for obscenity.
QUESTION:

It seems to me rather an unfortunate

phrase to use, that's all.
MR. CAPIZZI:

Well, it's a phrase that is enacted,

by statute, following decisions of this Court.
QUESTION; The more honest it is, the more unlawful
it is?
MR. CAPIZZI:
QUESTION;

Well, —

I think that's what the word "candor"

means.
MR. CAPIZZI: There are various -—
QUESTION:

Forthright.

MR. CAPIZZI:
by the dictionary.

— definitions, I believe, propounded

Purity is one of them; frankness is but

one definition that is used.

However, simply because someone is

frank or honest does not necessarily insulate that conduct or
speech.
And I think a similar area would be libel if it's
done maliciously, even though it might be honest.
Let's say truthful.
I suggest that the Constitution does not require
that a nationwide standard be adopted.

If we're to say that

the limitation of the States is through the Fourteenth
Amendment, and the due process clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment, the implication is that the States may deprive its

31
citizens of life, liberty, or property, if due process is
followed or complied with.

And due process in the past has

not required that each State have identical laws for
depriving its citizens of liberty.
The different States provide varying types of
conduct as criminal, and it seems that it should be no
different for each State to have a slightly different
definition as to what constitutes obscenity than it is to have
a slightly different definition as to what constitutes
burglary or any other crime.
QUESTION:

I don't know that anybody has made a

claim that burglary is protected by the First Amendment.
MR. CAPIZZI:

No, but it involves conduct, and

it involves freedom of action.

If each State must have an

identical definition as to what constitutes obscenity, how
can we avoid the conclusion that the definition of any
crime must be the same from State to State?

Because, in

obscenity, we're talking about the freedom of speech; in
any other criminal conduct we're talking about freedom of
action.

And I suggest that freedom of action is likewise a

very, very basic concept.
QUESTION:

Well, one's in the First Amendment and

the other isn’t.
MR. CAPIZZIt
QUESTION:

The other is in the —

There's nothing in the Constitution that

32

says you have freedom to steal or commit burglary or murder
or --MR. CAPIZZIs

No, but freedom

—

QUESTION;

mayhem or assault and battery„ But

there is something that says you have the right of free
expression and free speech.
MR. CAPIZZI:

No, but freedom to do what we wish,

and the States proscribe certain conduct as not being permis­
sible.

Likewise, from State to State, if we’re talking about

he tlue process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, should we
not have different definitions as to what constitutes
obscenity?
The fact that — well, in addition to the
constitutional argument, I suggest that practicality suggests
that a nationwide standard is simply not possible.
In Denver, dancers wear pasties and G-strings.
Southern California, they wear nothing.

In

What is the standard?

Or, to further illustrate it, let's assume for the
sake of the illustration that east of the Mississippi the
dancers wear pasties.
wear pasties.

West of the Mississippi, they don't

What is the national community standard for

limits of candor?
How are we going to average or determine something
that’s not subject to determination?
From & practical point of view, it would be very

33

easy for the appellant in this case to determine the
standard in the various localities.

Much easier than it

would be for him to determine the standard on a nationwide
basis. The,whole is made up of the parts, and while the parts
may be readily identified, simply by identifying the parts you
can't necessarily arrive at a description as to what the
whole is.
If we were to adopt something that was acceptable to
the nation as a whole, we would probably have something akin
to what we see on TV, something that's acceptable for
dissemination indiscriminately into any home and to anyone
who might see it.
case.

Which is, in effect, what we have in this

It was mailed, unsolicited, into the home where anyone

within the home might open it and see it.
Thirdly, I would suggest, with relation to the
earlier comments, that judges, in determining obscenity
matter in the constitutional sense, are determining a question
of law.

And the local judges are not capable of determining

what the national standard for limits of candor is.
How are they going to determine what the limits of
candor, nationwide, are?

Experts?

Experts might be fine for

the trial judge, but if we have conflicting experts, how is
the appellate judge to resolve the conflict?
The basic principle that the trier of fact can
determine credibility because he views the witness is absent

34
when the appellate judge is looking at the cold record.
Further, as attorneys and judges, X think it's
easy for us to accept the proposition that speech acceptable
in one location is not acceptable at another.

We describe

things one way in the office to contemporaries, partners, and
associates, which description, if used in court, would
probably subject us to contempt.

Why?

If location is not important, why can't we speak the
same way in the courtroom that we can speak in the office?
I think obviously that in that situation we recognise
that the limits of candor, honesty, frankness, differs from
place to place.

Because we have two different communities

in effect, the office and the courtroom.
And the same is true from city to city, county to
county, —
QUESTION:

You mean you're less candid in the court

than you are in the office?
[Laughter.]
MR. CAPIZZI: Well, no, Mr. Justice Marshall, but we
use different terms sometimes to describe the same thing in
court than we do in chambers, in the office, or sometimes
out of court.

And I think the reason is not simply a question

of honesty, because both descriptions are honest and frank
and describe the same thing. But it's the language that's
used that's acceptable in one location and not acceptable in

35

another location.
The test then, as submitted, that the States are
free to adopt whichever community they choose, whether it be
local, State, or national, for determining customary limits of
candor.

In this case the State chose the Statewide community,

and it's submitted that the evidence amply established that
that community was — the standard for that community was
exceeded, the evidence amply established that the material
predominantly appealed to a prurient interest, and although
Mr. Marks says he hasn't seen a case since Ginzburg that
involved pandering, I would suggest that this case itself
may very well involve pandering.
These were brochures containing a number of scenes
from the book they purported to advertise and very little
of the text of the book is there, only the most graphic
depictions of sexual activity,selling predominantly the
prurient appeal of the books as opposed to whatever social
value they may or may not have.
QUESTION;

Mr. Capizzi, did I understand you to say

that in California you attempt to apply a State standard?
MB. CAPIZZI:
QUESTION;

That's correct, yes.

How is that any more easily applied than

a national standard?
MR. CAPIZZI;

It's not, I would concede.

extremely difficult to establish.

It8s

In adopting the Statewide

36

Standard, the State court said that an expert must be used to
establish what that standard is, or to assist the trier of fact
in determining that standard.
QUESTION;

I suppose a jury, however it's instructed,

is going to apply what it regards as a standard,to wit, a
local standard, isn't it?
MR. CAPIZZI:

It's possible, although they're

administered an oath and asked to follow the law, and
presumably they do follow the law.
QUESTION;

In any event, you are conceding that what

might be the standard in a northern California county might
not coincide with the standard in Los Angeles?
MR. CAPIZZI;
QUESTION:

Oh, most definitely. Yes.

Well, you're in effect stuck with what

the Supreme Court of California is going to rule on that point.
MR. CAPIZZI:

That's correct.

I'm suggesting that the Constitution does not make
that standard impermissible, and the Constitution would
likewise permit of a local standard if the law of that State
indicated a local standard.
In other words, the State itself is free to adopt
the standard which it sees fit, and neither of the three
standards, local, State, or national, violate the Constitution
as applied to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment.
QUESTION; Going back to Mr. Justice Blackmun's

37

question to you about the jury acting independently, isn't the
jury permitted to credit or discredit any evidence that it
wants to?
MR. CAPI2,ZI:
QUESTION:;

Most definitely.

And particularly isn't that true about

expert testimony?
MR. CAPIZZI:

That's correct.

Most definitely.

Simply because the expert testifies doesn't mean the jury has
to accept that which he relates to them, if he disbelieves
that witness.
But, responding further to the question, the Statev/ide standard is difficult to determine or to prove or to
provide experts on.

Extremely difficult.

A nationwide

standard, requiring experts to establish, would be virtually
impossible to do.
QUESTION;

Especially in view of —
Have the courts undertaken to define

Statewide standards of what constitutes negliqence or reasonable
care?

Or do they leave that to juries on a case-by-case basis?
MR. CAPIZZI:

I believe that’s left to the juries

on a case-by-case basis, yes, Mr. Chief Justice.
QUESTION:

Would it be fair to say that it's

possible to have one type of a verdict in Northern California
in a homicide case and a different type of verdict on
substantially the same evidence in some other part of
California?

38

MR. CAPIZZI: No question about it.

Yes.

QUESTION: That's the nature of the jury system, isn't
it?
MR. CAPIZZI:

That's the nature of the system; that's
*

correct.
Further, with respect to the third element that's
required in California by statute, and that's the issue of
utterly without redeeming social importance, I would like to
emphasize the redeeming aspect of social importance and ask
that that not be treated lightly or dropped from the full
phrase.

It seems to be glossed over on occasion or completely

eliminated.

But if the phrase is to have meaning, then the

redeeming aspect of utterly without redeeming social
importance must be emphasized.
Everything, as suggested by Justice White, has
some value to society, whether we learn from it, hopefully,
and if that is the test, strictly social importance or social
value, then nothing is going to be obscene.

But we must have

— it must be utterly without redeeming social importance.
We would ask that the Court reject the necessity of
determining obscenity in the constitutional sense on a pieceby~piece basis, and adopt a sufficiency of the evidence test
as applied in other cases.
No matter which test is adopted, it's submitted that
the material in this case is patently offensive and substan-

39

tially exceeds any conceivable standard or limits of candor.
And for that reason we would sufoxait the judgment should be
affirmed.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Thank you, Mr. Capizzi.
Mr. Marks, do you have anything further?

You have

two minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BURTON MARKS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. MARKS:

Very briefly.

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice.
I say this:

I may have some disagreement as to

whether probable cause hearing is different from a preponderance
o f the evidence hearing, and I personally feel that Chapman
vs. California would militate or necessitate a beyond a
reasonable doubt hearing.
But that's not the point.
a hearing, and let us work it out.

The point is:

give us

That's what happened

before.
Give us a hearing, let the person have his chance in
court, not in a criminal prosecution which was never meant to
apply to a First Amendment case.
QUESTION: As I understand it, though, you're not
talking about ’’giving us a hearing”, in your words, with
respect to the precise material involved in any particular

40

case, but sort of genetically, with respect to material
genetically.

Is that right?

MR. MARKS:

Give us a hearing which will bind the

States, so that they can't continue to harass and prosecute
for the same type of material —
QUESTION: The same type of material, not the same
material?
MR. MARKS:

No, the same type.

QUESTION: And that's where one •—
QUESTION: Who is going to decide whether it's the
same type?
QUESTION: Exactly.
MR. MARKS:

Well, somebody knows it when they see it,

and you can look at it and there's no question.
QUESTION:

Isn't that what you're doing now, jury by

jury?
MR. MARKS:

If you are doing it jury by jury, you're

doing it on a proposition that one type of material has
already been declared to be protected, and you can’t even
bring that type of evidence in some cases before a jury or
before a judge to estop.
QUESTION: But are you saying any more than that in
some courts, before some juries, a verdict might be
manslaughter, that on the same evidence might be second-degree
murder.

Is that — I take it, as a lawyer, you'd acknowledge

41
that that does happen?
HE. MARKS:

Oh, that has happened, but that isn't

what I'm saying.
Perhaps what I*m saying is that the defendant has to
have a chance to know before he can be put before the jury and
made to do something.

And the State should give the opportunity

and they should be forced to produce the evidence by an
impartial State, not the police officer testifying as the
expert, but impartial evidence before an impartial judge.
That's what we want.
