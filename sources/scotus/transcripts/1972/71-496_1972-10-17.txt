PROCEEDINGS

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 71-496, Ward against the Village of Monroeville.
Mr. Berkman.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF BERNARD A. BERKMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
Ml. BERKMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case raises squarely the question of the
continuing vitality of the mayor's court system in the
dispensation of roadside justice in Ohio.
Specifically, the issue here is whether a atayor,
charged with the financial and law enforcement responsibili­
ties for the Village of which he is executive and adminis­
trative head, can serve as an impartial judge and fact-finder
in criminal proceedings without violating the due process
clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
The facts which give rise to this issue are
briefly stated.
Actually, the petitioner was convicted of a
couple of traffic offenses in the mayor's court.
In Monroeville, he was convicted of offenses which
are violations of ordinances of that incorporated village.
Monroeville is a small, unchartered, incorporated
village in Northwestern Ohio, in Huron County, through which

4
a main truck and auto highway, State Route 20, runs.
It carries a considerable amount of truck traffic and, from
time to time, Public Utilities Commission State officials
conduct safety checks at its village boundaries in cooperatio
with village councIlmen.'
The record reveals that in some instances when
these safety checks occur up to 20 arrests per day happen.
In this particular instance, the petitioner was
convicted of failure to comply with the lawful, order of the
police in which it was contended that he did not stop
within a reasonable period of time after having been waved
down in order to participate in one of these PUC traffic
checks.
And secondly, he was charged with failure to
produce a driver's license upon request of a police officer,
and an altercation which occurred after he did stop his
truck somewhat up the road, during which an episode of
shooting of mace, and so on, occurred.
Petitioner was tried.

He interposed the defense.

He was convicted and fined tke maximum of $50 cost in each
case.
The constitutional question which is here presented
was preserved by affidavit to disqualify the mayor as judge,
a motion to dismiss the prosecution, or in the alternative,
to certify to a proper court.

5

In all of these instances9 petioner was frustrated,
and a number of events occurred during the course of the
trials, and both trials ultimately in the Court of Appeals
were consolidated so that they are here presented.
A number of rather aberrant episodes occurred
during which the mayor sought to shift the burden of going
forward to the accused, appeared somewhat surprised and
amazed that defense counsel would even challenge the credi­
bility of a uniformed officer under oath, abandoned to the
police officer witness the right to determine whether he
need answer questions put to him by defense counsel, and,
as a layman and non-lawyer, relied rather substantially and
heavily upon the prosecutor’s legal advice.
At a hearing conducted on the affidavit to dis­
qualify, some additional information of relevance and
importance to the constitutional question here presented,
emerged.

It was demonstrated that from the years 1964

through 1968, the five previous years prior to the con­
viction, that of the total number of — total amount of
money in the village’s general fund, in each year somewhere
between 36% and 51% of all the general revenues of the
village came from fines assessed in the mayor’s court.
In addition, it appeared that in 1959, at a time
when the village was concerned that the jurisdiction of
mayor's courts was to be lessened, the alarm that the village

6
had with respect to the fact that the lessening of juris­
diction of mayor’s courts would somehow or other affect
adversely its fiscal position, is demonstrated by Village
Ordinance 59-9 in 1959, in which an expert was hired, at
least partially in concern over the fact that the decrease
in the jurisdiction of the mayor’s court would involve
some increased tax responsibilities or curtailed services
for the members of the village.
That ordinance is reproduced in our brief, and
also appears in the Appendix.
As a matter of State law, and as a part of the
hearing, a number of other important constitutional facts
were developed in the case below.
In the first place, it was established, and the
law of Ohio is clear on the subject, that the mayor is the
chief law enforcement officer of the village, with the power
to hire, fire and supervise the police chief and all the
members of the police force.

He has the powers of the

-

sheriff and is to enforce the peace within his boundaries.
And, in this instance, he had the power to do and
did actually appoint the police chief who was the principal
witness against the accused in this case and had,as a matter
of fac$ to determine the credibility of his employee.
Now, it is true that there is some approval required
of counsel in this instance, but the principal responsibility

7
and the chief law enforcement officer, I think, without
question, is the mayor who sits as the judge in these kinds
<£

cases.
The Ohio Revised Code, Section 73715-18, 73330 in

1905.20,make very clear his position as chief law enforcement
officer in the village.
In addition, it was developed:, and the law is
also clear that the mayor is the chief executive of the
village for financial responsibility for Its fiscal con­
dition.
He is required to report its fiscal condition and
in the event that there are excess expenditures or expendi­
tures which are improper, he is required to enforce it,and
Ohio Revised Code Section 73332 and 73333 make that abundantly
clear.
Q
was?

Does the record show what the mayor salary

•
MR.

BERKMAN:

No,

it does not.

We do not contend that his salary was dependent
upon the outcome of a particular case, except that it is
demonstrated that it was taken from the general fund.
Q
isn't it?

The salary is a matter of local decision,
It is not determined by State lav??

MR. BERKMAN:
Q

Yes, that's right.

And it would probably be just a few hundred

8
dollars in a village like this, wouldn't it?
MR, BEKKMAM:

I would imagine.

It was also developed that the mayor is not a
lawyer, not subject to the cannons of judicial ethics and yet
required by law to make procedural and evidentiary rulings
under Ohio Revised Code, Section 293815, and that inasmuch
as he was not a lawyer, the person from whom he sought his
legal advice was the village solicitor who happened to be
the prosecutor in this case,
Q

Isn't that apt to be true of almost any

non-lawyer, traffic judge, you know, regardless of whether
he has some executive position?
MR. BERKMAN:
are quite right.

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I think you

I think that that in itself would not be

an unusual fact.
Our contention is that,coupled with all of the
other factors which keep the tribunal from seeing the
situation in a neutral manner, add to the situation in which
he is obtaining all of his information, including the
matters of admissibility of evidence, and so on, from a
source which is biased in one direction in the case.
Q

You are not claiming that the absence of

a lawyer, a law trained man, as the judge, is a violation of
due process, standing alone?
MR. BERKMAN:

That is not our particular

9
consideration.
As a matter of fact, what we are saying is that
the entire composite of circumstances under the statutory
scheme which is established in mayor*s courts as both execu­
tives in charge of the function of their village and also
to sit as a neutral and detached magistrate in criminal
matters, is in itself a denial of due process.
All of these factors add together to create the
consitutional infirmity of which we complain.
Q

Did you have a right, an unrestricted right,

for de novo trial?
MR. BERKMAN:

Well, I think that it is now clear

that under the 1970 amendments, at least, which followed the
case as it was tried initially by some two years, that there
is under Section 19—
Q

Was there at the time?

MR. BERKMAN: -- I think not.

I think that the

county court*s appeal was a matter of law.

And, as a matter

of fact, there was a good deal of additional skirmish, or
issue, taken at the Court of Appeals level and at the Ohio
Supreme Court —
Q

Let’s assume there was, for the moment,

that there could have been an appeal from this conviction,
unrestricted de novo trial, with the first trial having no
significance in that later trial, would that make any differen

10

in your case?
MR. BERKMAN: We think that it would not make any
difference because of the fact that we contend that it is
not necessary to go through an unconstitutional trial in
order to get a constitutional one.
Our position is that they have to go through two
trials before you get—»
Q

Are you in favor of all these traffic court

situations that absolutely have to be absolutely a con­
stitutional trial?
MR. BERKMAN:
j

Q

Well, we think —

It would withstand all kinds of con­

stitutional —
MR. BERKMAN:

I don’t think we need to stretch

that far, Mr. Justice White, because so far as we are
concerned, at least in these kinds of cases the bare minimum
amount of due process — and we know that in.different kinds
of circumstances, this Court has applied different standards
of due process.
But we say this, regardless of whether or not an
individual is entitled to a jury trial, regardless of
whether or not an individual is entitled to counsel, regard^
less of whether he is entitled to witnesses,and all of the
other aspects that get together in due^process, we think
that at very mini man, even in traffic offenses, even in petty

11
matters, that an impartial tribunal, unquestioned because of
his role in other matters, is a basic essential.
Q

How much of a fine could there have been in

this case?
MR. RERKMAN:
imposed.

In this case, the maximum was

It was $50.
Q

Could it have been transferred to another

court?
MR. BERKMAN:

As a matter of fact, it could not

because under the rule if the fine exceeds $50, then and
under those circumstances the individual who is on trial is
entitled to trial by jury in a court of record.
Q

If the fine could be more'than $50?

MR. BERKMAN:
Q

Yes.

And here it couldn't be more than $50?

MR. BERKMAN:
Q

That's right.

What would the court of record be, the

county court or —
MR. BERKMAN:

The courts that have concurrent

jurisdiction which are courts of record in Ohio and municipal
courts and county courts.
Q

And the county courts were created back in

the ‘50*8, weren't they?
MR. BERKMAN:

Back in 1957, as a result of the

legislative abolition of the judges in peace courts.

12
Q

And would there be a municipal court with

jurisdiction over Monroeville?
MR. BERKMAN:

I think not, but the county courts

have jurisdiction where the municipal courts do not.
Q

This system is not in any way peculiar to

Monroeville, Ohio, but it is the system to be found in all
of the non-cbartered, incorporated villages throughout the
State, isn’t it?
MR. BERKMAN:

Yes, it is set out in Section 1905,

Chapter 1905 of the Ohio — and there are, I would imagine,
hundreds of such mayoral courts.
limited to

Their jurisdiction is

consideration of criminal cases under their

villages ordinances and moving traffic violations that
occur within their borders.
So that, in fact, they also have jurisdiction
over State statutory violations involving moving vehicular
traffic.
Q

But, again, their power to punish is limited

even for violation of those State laws, isn’t it?

MR. BERKMAN:

To the extent that the accused

actually has a right to and seeks a jury trial, but, Your
Honor, I would point out that there are a number of tactical
and financial reasons why somebody would decide why he ought
not to have a jury trial.

And in those instances the court

has jurisdiction to hear such cases.

Q

But with a limited power to punish, doesn't

it?
MR. BERKMAN:

No, I find no such statutory

limitation and it is our contention that traffic manslaughter
is, indeed, in the jurisdiction of the court if the accused
does not seek a jury trial.
Q

So the mayor can put people in jail?

MR. BERKMAN:

I think he can, and, as a matter of

fact, Section 1905.30 specifically indicates that par­
ticularly in the event of the non-payment of a fine,the
individual is to be incarcerated.

And that appears specifically in the statute.
As I read its jurisdiction, I think that traffic
manslaughter, driving while intoxicated, all of which carry
penalties, including imprisonment, would be within the
court’s jurisdiction, subject only to the provision tnat
if an individual seeks a jury trial, he can have it somewhere
else.

That is in the court of record.
The due process issue was preserved at each level

of appeal and the Huron County Court of Appeals consolidated
both cases and affirmed the conviction and the Supreme Court
by a 5 to 2 decision, in Ohio, did the same.
Certiorari was granted

and the Issue is now before

us.
1 think that it is tot necessary to belabor the

14

point that a neutral, detached, impartial judge«factfinder
is essential to minimum standards of due process in fair
hearings, both in criminal and non-criminal cases.
I would only point out that an impartial judge,
as a requirement of fair hearings, is as old as the history
of courts, as old as the judicial practice itself.
The whole point, it seems to me, of letting some­
body have the power to adjudicate a decision between two
competing parties is the hope that the judge will act in a
way which goes straight down the middle and be neutral and
determine the result on the basis of the evidence and not on
the basis of his own self-interest.
Q

Would it be a violation of due process if

you had a judge appointed by the mayor?
MR. BERKMAN:

Judges appointed by the mayor?

I think that it might not violate due process
under such circumstances so long as the judge takes an oath
and performs his office.
Q

What if the mayor appointed judges under

the statute to serve at the pleasure of the mayor?
MR. BERKMAN:

Well, 1 think we might run into a

question, depending upon the entire aggregate of circumstances
under those concerned.
Q

But what you want is some other person?

MR. BERKMAN:

It seems to us that we are asking too

13
much of a system and too much of an individual under the
intertwining system in which he must wear the hat of police"
man and the hat of impartial judge and the hat of the
administrator of the village, to give not only justice but
she appearance of justice, to which we think that every
motorist and every individual who comes within the juris‘km
diction of that court is entitled.
Q

Is this the same scheme that we have had

here in both Turney and Dugan?
MR, BERKMAN: Well, I think that the situation has
changed insofar a3 statutes are concerned with respect to
Turney.

Since that time, the jurisdiction of the mayor's

court has been whittled away so that it no longer involves
county-widejurisdiction, as I have indicated in response —
Q

Wo longer, I gather from what you said

earlier, that the mayor gets any part of his compensation
from the fines.
MR. BERKMAN:

Right.

Those axe two dis­

tinctions In the fact that we present to you now, as dis­
tinguished from Turney.
Q

And also in Turney, if I am not mistaken,

there was no right to a trial de novo?
MR. BERKMAN:

Q
was like -- ?

That's right.

That's right.

Is this situation more like Dugan than it

MR» BERKMAN:
it is Turney»

We thinlc it is less like Dugan than

As a matter of fact, we think that Dugan is

not applicable at all because the Dugan case involved a
chartered municipality and a commission form of government
in which it was conceded and stipulated by all the parties
that the person designated the mayor in that case was not
the chief executive officer as mayor is in this case, and
that really all he was was a member of a commission of five
persons.
Q

That commission, though, exercised the

authority of the municipality.
MR. BERKMAN:

So he was one of five.

I believe, Mr. Justice Rehnquist,

that he was not in any way involved in the executive
operation of the city.

Really, that executive responsibility

was deposited in the city manager.
Q

Wasn’t the manager responsible to the

commission?
MR, BERKMAN:

1 think he was, but the actual

administrative or executive function was confined in the
hands of the city manager, rather than the commission itself.
Q

All members of the council there shared the

responsibility for financing the municipality.
MR. BERKMAN:

Yes, I think that is correct, but I

think that the individual role

of

the person who sat as the

mayor was subject to at least the checks and balances that the

17
charter system gave under those circumstances.
And, as a matter of fact, a great deal of time and
attention in that opinion, a short one, was devoted to the
distinction between the charter system and the mayoral system
which we had in Turney and which appears presently before this
Court.
I call it to the Court's attention only in
addition to Turney and Dugan which are at the core of this
Court's concern.
In re Murchison which I think finishes the job
which was begun in Turney to indicate that the appearance as
well as the actual form of justice has got to appear.
Now, in order to excuse the kind of system that
we have had in Ohio, some arguments have been made
by respondent, some arguments have been made by legislators,
and I think that there are basically three.
The first is that this is the minimus and that
the kind of damage that can be done to an accused in this
kind of court is something that really ought to be overlooked
in the; interest of expediency of operating a court and so on.
Q

Do you really have to argue that, counsel,

now that you are here?
NR. BERKMAN:

We think that the grant of

certiorari in this case has been an indication that that is
not an argument that is necessary to deal with, and if fcne

Court feels we ought not, we will move on to our next
contention which is a contention that is made that with
respect to infliction of substantial — that no substantial
damage can be inflicted, in a response to a question from
Mr. Justice Stewart31 have indicated that there are grave
consequences,

'

,

I would like to add one more to that-which lias not
been brought out and that is that under Ohio’s point system
for the accumulation of points to revoke a driver’s license
Ohio Revised Code,Section 4507.40, twelve points are necessary
to take away a driver's license.
The petitioner in this case is a truck driver.
He drives a truck for a living.
The events of which he was convicted under the
lists of points per violation, that appear in that statute,
would give him six points;
And a mayor's court, although it is not a court
of record, for purposes of giving reports to the Bureau of
Motor Vehicles in Ohio, is, indeed, a court of record for
at least that limited purpose.
And, so, as a result of this conviction, half of
the necessary points to take away his driver's license, in
this court occurred.
Your case, Bell v. Burson. in 402 U.S., I think,
indicates the importance, particularly to a wage-earner on the

19
road of having his driver's license, and we would add that
point.
I think we have dealt with our contention in
response to a question from Mr. Justice White with respect
to the appeal de novo, but when we add that the appeal de
novo is a rather peculiar animal in Ohio,and the one that
you will be considering in this case has within it a couple
of contradictions that cause me concern,to think that it
isn't a fresh slate on which is written the new trial.
Our answer would stand that we think that you
don't have to have two trials in order to get one that
is constitutional.
Q

If you should not prevail here, may he then

seek de novo under new dispensation in Ohio?
MR. BERKMAN:

That's a knotty question which I

don't understand the answer to, particularly in view of the
fact that during the course of our appeal that new right
and our contention was made available to us, but I would only
urge that even under the present statutory law the Section
1905.30 provides for incarceration and/or bond, and also
1905.24, very curiously, provides that the appeal, even the
appeal de novo, which is referred to in the next section,
cannot be even docketed unless a transcript of the proceedings
below is presented to the court.
I ask for what purpose, if this is a de novo

20
hearing, is a transcript necessary to be prepared, and how
is that to be used, either to influence the court above or
to be used as a judicial admission in the taking of testi­
mony or —
Q

Is there a transcript of the magistrate’s

here?
MR. BERKMAN:

Well, I refer the Court respectfully

to Section 1905.24, which makes that a condition —
Q

The point is, is it not, that there isn’t

a transcript in these matters.
MR. BERKMAN:
Q

When it is not a court of record --

MR. BERKMAN:
Q

Well, there isn’t, except —

No, it Isn’t a court of record.

How come they have a transcript?

MR. BERKMAN:

Well, I presume that the parties

can make private arrangements but there is no statutory
arrangement.
Q

That’s what I mean.

MR. BERKMAN:

I point out only the difficulties

in the application of the de novo —
Q

Do you know what the practice is?

MR. BERKMAN:

The practice, 1 believe, is that

there is -- ordinarily, the practice is that there is no
appeal from these kinds of cases.
Q

Right.

But do you know what the practice is

21
when there is an appeal?
MR. BERKMAN:
Q

It is a new — isn’t it?

MR. BERKMAM:
Q

I am sorry, this is the only appeal.

Yes, it is new since June of 1970.

You don’t think it means just a transcript

of the docket entries, or something?
MR. BERKMAM:

Because the original papers are

also referred to, Your Honor, and I am not sure.

It is

unclear.
Also the word ,,trialn is used in that statute and
I only suggest that merely calling something de novo does
not solve all the problems that may emerge in dealing with
the question.
An argument is also made that the provisions of
Ohio Revised Code, Section 2937.20, which provides for
disqualification from bias is a protection against excesses
in the mayor's court and we tried that in this case,and I
am here to report to you that it didn't work successfully
unless you feel that every $50 fine needs to come to this
Court in order to have ultimate adjudication.
What we are saying, basically, is that there is
a difference between individual bias and secemic interest.
And, we are saying that this particular statute is designed
to deal with the mayor who happens to be the brother-in-law
of the opposing party, or something of that kind, but does

22
not deal with the inherent secemic problems, and, therefore,
cannot be handled in every case in a way which permits that
kind of disqualification.
I would like to reserve the balance of my time.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Berkwan.

Mr. Eckstein.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANKLIN D. ECKSTEIN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR. ECKSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
My name is Franklin Eckstein.

I am the Solicitor

for the Village of Monroeville, Ohio.
I would like to first say there are a lot of
questions about trial de novo.
I am just a country lawyer and I would like to
say that, although 1 hesitate to differ with opposing counsel,
there was a right to trial de novo at the time of Ward’s
case.
It was in the Common Pleas Court.
But Ward did not have the right to a trial de novo
for the reason that he had brought in a court stenographer.
And a rule then was the same as a rule today,
although you go to the county court or a municipal court*
That rule is,once you bring in a stenographer and all of the
others, it is reduced to a record.

23
You have the right to appeal on questions of law,
but not on questions of fact»
And, back then, as today, if you don’t bring in
your stenographer, and you go before the mayor, the mayor
prepares his docket form,which is a single piece of paper.
No evidence or testimony, other than the mayor’s
finding of guilty, is on that piece of paper.

And you go

to the county court or the municipal court where you have
a complete new trial of the facts as well as the law.
Q

Now, let's get that sorted out.

Could this particular petitioner have gotten a
true de novo trial as a matter or right here?
NR. ECKSTEIN:

He could not in his first case

because he brought in a stenographer.
And what I will call a second case where he did
not bring one in and simply
Q

—

The second case was the other —

MR. ECKSTEIN:
driver's license.

That was failure to produce a

It was related and we consolidated in

the Court of Appeals.
In that case, he could have had a trial de novo,
if he had chosen.
And, that would be the same rule of law today.
Q

What’s the difference between the two?

MR. ECKSTEIN:

Well, what happened, Mr. Justice

24
Q

X know, but what's the difference between

the rule?
You say he brought in a stenographer?

MR.

ECKSTEIN:

The rule was that if you bring

in a court reporter and the testimony and the written
evidence is reduced to a writing, when you appeal from the
mayor's court you only get a review of the questions of
law»

You do not get a review of the questions of fact.
If you leave the stenographer home, which is a

tactical decision, then if you lose you can start all over
in the county court or municipal court.
And the Ohio Legislature wanted to keep this
system.
In 1970, before the Ohio Court of Appeals, now
the question they asked us would we prepare supplemental
briefs on a question of whether or not appeal from mayor's
court and to county pleas court was —
Q

The questions of law would be like the

sufficiency of the evidence?
MR. ECKSTEIN:
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

You just didn't take the evidence over again,

that's all.
MR. ECKSTEIN:
Q

That's correct.

I see.

MR. ECKSTEIN: But to go back —

25
Q

And you say chafe’s true also now, since

1970?
MR. ECKSTEIN:

I would hesitate to differ with

any interpretation but I practiced in county courts and
municipal courts, as well as mayor’s courts, in the
surrounding communities, and this is the practice rule.
Q

There was a change in the law in 1970, but

you say in this respect the law is the same.
MR. ECKSTEIN:

The only difference was

the court you went into on appeal.

Because of an amendment

to the Ohio Constitution, they made that appear to be
doubtful whether you could appeal the Common Pleas Court;
the Legislature not waiting on a decision in our case by
the Ohio Supreme Court amended that law.
But as recently as 1970, they kept the system,
although they changed the courts.
Q

So while the 1970 law does talk about a

trial de novo.you are telling us that when in fact you
had a stenographer in the mayor's court it may not be a
trial de novo?
MR. ECKSTEIN:
Q

It was not a trial de novo.

Even though the Legislature is calling it

that?
MR. ECKSTEIN:

Weil, the provisions, if you

read the provisions, that's the way it worked out.

And in

26
our practice, that's the way it was.
Q

What does the court on appeal do if there

is a conflict in the evidence?
MR. ECKSTEIN:

It is an appeal, Mr. Justice White.

In otter words, the judge, the county court
judge who could have heard Ward's case --it would have
been a Common Pleas judge — would have heard the evidence
and wouldn't have been, I don't think, influenced by the
fact that the mayor had found the man guilty or — of course,
if he's not guilty, there wouldn't be any further prosecu­
tion.
But I don't think that a county court judge would
have been influenced.
Q

No, no.

The question is when there is a

transcript, as you say there was in the first case.
What does the Common Please Court do if there are
conflicts in the evidence on the cold record?
MR. ECKSTEIN:

I see.

Well, I presume it would be

up to him as the reviewing judge to decide —
Q

Well, it isn't a new trial if he doesn't

decide it.

MR. ECKSTEIN:

No, it is not a new trial.

just a review of questions along.

It is

It would be only a

--

If you are going to consider the sufficiency

27
o£ the evidences you have to knew what the facts are.
And if the facts are disputed, do you decide the
facts on a cold record, or do you --

that isn't much of

a de novo trial, is it?
MR. ECKSTEIN:
Q

No, not when there is a transcript.

Do you know whether they have developed any

clearly erroneous type of rule?
MR. ECKSTEIN:
Q

Not that I know of.

Mr. Eckstein, you mentioned the tactical

decision that a litigant faces in deciding whether or not
to bring a stenographer with him to the mayor's court.
What sort of tactical considerations would lead
him to bring a stenographer with him?
MR. ECKSTEIN:

Well, if he felt that he would not

get a favorable decision, in that particular mayor's court,
he could bring in a stenographer to preserve a record so
that he could go to the county clerk and perhaps with a
very minimal effort, in terms of time, present his written
briefs, perhaps, and get a reversal.
But that would be all the greater reason that a
defendant would want to bring in —•
Q

Well, there might be another reason akin

to the argument we heard earlier today in the antitrust case
Just the presence of the stenographer might lead to a fairer
trial by the mayor, may it not?

28

MR.

ECKSTEIN:

I think that that could be a

possible consideration.
Q

If you have a trial de novo, may the judge

in the court of record or the jury impose a higher sentence
or more severe sentence?
MR. ECKSTEIN:

No, they would not be able to.

And in this case, maximum fine would have been
$50.

You’d have to follow the ordinance, and there would

have been no right to a jury trial.

It would have been

tried to a judge.
Q

Tell me, Mr. Eckstein, if Mr. Ward fails

on this appeal, would he have an opportunity for trial
de novo?
MR. ECKSTEIN:

No.

Not under Ohio law.

He brought in a stenographer and he forfeited
that right when he brought the stenographer in.
Q

How about on the second offense?

Or is that not before us?
MR. ECKSTEIN:

That has been merged into the

second offense.
The failure to ask for a complete retrial of
the facts in that case, in my estimation, would have waived
the right.
I would just like to point out that —
Q

What is the difference between the trial

29

de novo and an appeal?
MR. ECKSTEIN:

Well, as we view it in the case of

mayor's courts, an appeal would only be where you have the
transcript, and the question would be a question of whether
or not the law had been properly applied to the facts as
they appear in the transcript.
Whereas, trial de novo, as we understand it, is
a complete retrial, and introduction of evidence and everythin;
else.
Q

Isn't this an anomaly of an appeal from a

non-judicial officer?
MR. ECKSTEIN:

All I can say, Mr. Justice, is

that I believe that the Legislature, in wanting to keep
this court system, wanted to provide every protection they
reasonably could and still keep the system.
It is,indeed,a unique situation.
I would lilce to point out to the Court that the
first time that affidavit for prejudice was filed at a
Monroeville mayor's court, that the mayor granted the motion
of the defendant, and he did certify the cases to the Huron
County Court.
Now, from beginning to end, the constitutional
question — and in raising the question on the affidavit,
the mayor said, "Yes, you're right."
He certified the county court, and the case sat

30
over there for about four months9 until December 17, 1968,
when the county court judge discovered the grounds for
the transferral, and decided he did not have original
jurisdiction to hear the case and sent it back to Mayor
Salisbury.
So, in the first instance, the mayor, I think,
bent over backwards to be fair.

Unfortunately the county

court did not send back the second case involving the
driver’s license until January, so that they were not tried
together before Mayor Salisbury.
Q

You say "bent over backwards,"

He might have

done what was right.
MR. ECKSTEIN:

Well, the point was, Mr. Justice,

that once the county court judge returned the case to him
he felt obligated to go forward under Ohio law.
Q

Why?

MR. ECKSTEIN:

Well, the county court did not

have original jurisdiction In that instance to hear that
case because o£ the fact that the fine was less than $50,
and the basis for the motion in the county court judge’s
opinion was not well taken.

That was the constitutional

question.
Q

What is the basis — i.e., let’s just say

that there was personal prejudice on the part of the mayor.
Then, what substitute judge would he have had?

31
The mayor of another town, county judge, or —
HR. ECKSTEIN:

I don't see how they could have

done other than have a substitute county court judge hear
the case, because I can't — I've not had, personally, that
experience, but I don't see how they could appoint a mayor
Q
judge?

Why would they have to have a substitute

They could have a substitute civilian.
MR. ECKSTEIN:
Q

judge.

Well, under the system —

The mayor wasn't a lawyer.

He wasn't a

They could have gotten a substitute non-lawyer,

like the deputy mayor or a member of the council.
MR. ECKSTEIN:
Q

Well, I think ~

Or any other civilian.

MR. ECKSTEIN:

Possibly the president of council,

who assumes the role of mayor when the mayor is out of town
or resigns —
Q

Or the head of the hospital, or some

obstretician.
MR. ECKSTEIN:

That's a question I simply can't

answer, I am sorry.
Q

It is just not clear under the Ohio law.

But because you suggest in your brief that he
could have filed —
MR. ECKSTEIN:

My suggestion was that he should

have based It on other facts.

32
Q

All right, but if he had, and if it had

been valid, now my question is: what would have happened?
And you don’t know the answer.
MR. ECKSTEIN:

You say —

In this case, I don’t see how

it could have been other than a county court judge, but
possibly it could have appointed president of council it
said.
Q

Because in this case, the county court

judge apparently said I have no jurisdiction in this case,
even though the mayor had disqualified himself.
MR. ECKSTEIN:

Yes, that’s right.

But, in this particular case, I would like to
briefly point out that facts of life in a small town simply
aren't the way

they are claimed to be by the counsel ibr

Ward.
I think that the mayor's executive responsibility
is greatly overstated.
It is true that the statute says that the mayor
is to report to council on financial status of the town,
because in point of fact the only one who has any idea at
all about what's going on in town is the clerk-treasurer,
who is usually the only full-time salaried official in the
town, other than the street department men and the police­
men.
Q

In this town, the mayor gets no salary at all

33
Ml. ECKSTEIN:

He receives a couple hundred dollars

a year.
And, as a footnote, he was right, the case didn’t
make him any richer or poorer.

And he retired like most of

them usually do after they have had enough of being mayor.
It did not lead on to any great political career and he
didn’t pick any political or financial plums during the
time he was mayor.
But, really, a small village does not resemble
the Federal Government at all, in terms of domination of
the legislative by the executive branch.
Q

Does the record show what the population of

Monroeville is?
MR. ECKSTEIN:
Q

The population is 1300, Your Honor.

It is in Huron County?

MR. ECKSTEIN:

Huron County.

And, as a point of fact, of course, you can prove
anything with statistics.

It is true the village did have

traffic fines, and made up a third to a half of the general
fund.
Of course, the general fund is only about one-fifth
of the budget of the village because you have street fund,
electric fund, water fund, sewer fund, and certainly these
other fund3 contribute important services to the people in
the village.

34

So it |.s a question of relativity, it seems to me.
If you look at the flow of traffic through town, I think
that you recognise when you have a heavy volume of traffic
there are more apt to be convictions because there are more
offenses.
It is true the Public Utilities Commission does
run these safety checks.

The testimony was they run about

one a month.
Now, if the village were in the position of
wanting to make money, it seems to me, they would be asking
them to do a lot more of these safety checks.
Q

Are you going to distinguish all of this

you are talking about from Turney?
MR. ECKSTEIN:

I think, Your Honor, in Turney, you

had a very remarkable situation where the mayor's court had
county-wide jurisdictions, the fines were in the thousands
of dollars, the marshal;, kept 15%, the prosecuting attorney,
10%; and the special policemen, 15% of the fine.
They were interested in (die outcome.
kept the coats.

The mayor

He was interested in the outcome, and in

paying the costs of the people who were doing the law
enforcement.
They were going from a small village into a big
city to enforce the prohibition law.

And that was set up by

the legislature simply because they couldn't get it enforced

35

any other x-ray.
How, todays in a mayor's court, this man has
jurisdiction only over offenses within his own boundaries,
within a municipal corporation.
If the fine is over $50, the

person has the right

to trial by jury, x*hich means you go into the county court.
And if you waive the jury trial and go ahead and
have the county —
Q

Isn1t it true that the magistrate is a

member of the bar, an elected magistrate-

And you can still

get a jury trial in any other State?
MR. ECKSTEIN:

X am sorry.

X didn't understand

the question.
Q

The fact that you can get an appeal or a

new trial does not interfere with some people consider to
be your right to be tried by impartial judicial officer,
MR. ECKSTEIN:

Weil, £ would simply like to suggest

Your Honor, that —
Q

Well, this man is not a judicial officer,

is he?
MR. ECKSTEIN:

He does have a limited judicial

function, Just as he has a limited executive function, just
as he has a limited legislative function, believe it or not.
Q

Could this man be an obstetician?

MR, ECKSTEIN:

He sure could.

36
This man is a truck driver.
Q

Could the magistrate be a truck driver?

MR. ECKSTEIN:
Q

This magistrate was?

MR. ECKSTEIN:
Q

Yes, he was, in fact.

And that's an impartial, judicial officer?

MR. ECKSTEIN:
Q

Yes.

Well, Your Honor —

Yes or no?

MR. ECKSTEIN:

In this particular instance, X

would say that the man was less partial because of a lot
of things that got into newspapers over the six months
waiting period.
Q

Some of them very unfavorable, like this -I am saying,without anything to do with

this case, or anything, is a truck driver your Idea of
an impartial,judicial officer?
MR. ECKSTEIN:

I don't see why he couldn't be

just as impartial as a man —
Q

is that your idea of what it is?

Is that

your idea?
MR. ECKSTEIN:

I can't say butwhat he could be

as impartial as a lawyer could be.
Q

Impartial, judicial officer.

MR. ECKSTEIN:

Within the limited judicial

function.
Q

I guess you don't get the truck drivers

I've run across.
Q

Well, in any event, he was elected by the

voters of Monroeville, was he not, to this position?
MR. ECKSTEIN:

Yes, he was.

I would like to point out the mayor does not
have the power to levy taxes.

The mayor does have the

authority to appoint policemen, but as was testified to
below, and is the practice, safety committee of council goes
through the candidates.

They have the mayor appointed, but

council must approve the man.
Council mis t appropriate the money for the
salaries.

Council must buy all the equipment for the

policemen.
And it is up to the village clerk to keep the
council informed as a practical matter with respect to
what is going on financially, and, I think, if you take a
look at what actually happened below the facts are susceptibl
to different interpretation.
Now, this truck driver got confused.
was he granted the motion first time around.
later, it bounced back.

He had a hearing.

What happened
Six months

He started to

open court and counsel for Ward was interrupting him.about
renewing a motion and the mayor said, "I can't grant it now.”
Then the prompter was read into the record, and
the mayor didn't know what he was doing -- 1:II admit that —

38
He then proceeded upon enter of plea of not guilty to
ask Ward, "Bo you have anything to offer in the way of
testimony?"
This proves, in my estimation, that the man was
confused, which is unfortunate, but I don’t third; it is
fair to say that the mayor put the burden of proof on
defendants.

All mayors put the burden of proof on defendants

The same way with what happened in the course of
the trial.

The mayor couldii't see that we were going to end

up in U.S. Supreme Court.

He didn't know all the questions

about what was the process of procedure charging under
ordinances, or what was going on with'respect to the facts
of the case.

He thought they were going up blind alleys

wasting time and he got mad

and he lost his temper and

he challenged counsel for Ward, with respect to crossexamining the policeman.
I would say that the mayor in this case did lose
his temper.

He did act poorLy, but 1 don't think counsel

for Ward is right to say that what we have here is a man
who is above reproach, but the system put him in this bad
spot.
I think you've got a man here who listened to
six months of stuff in the newspapers, because this was
a very remarkable case for a small town, and the facts
were distorted.

There was a base that was used, although

39
it was widely reported that it was mace — that other facts
were distorted.
The mayor came with pretrial knowledge that
was improper and the mayor in the course of the trial
lost his conduct.

I don't think it is fair to say that

all mayors necessarily are in the same category as this one
mayor with respect to this one man.
And all I can say is that there is no denying the
fact that this mayor did a bad job in the handling of this
case, and maybe there is argument there for consideration
by this Court, but I don't think that we can make the leap
in logic and say that all mayors always place a burden of
proof on defendants, or that they all tend to defend
policemen, because they aren't responsible for the policemen.
Q
that argument.

1 don't understand Mr. Berkman to be making
In fact, I rather understood him to be

emphasizing that his attack is upon the system, as such»
Recognizing that the system may in same cases grant very,
very fair trials, in other cases unfair trials, but that
tie system itself is constitutionally invalid.

That's what

I thought -MR. ECKSTEIN:

What 1 am saying is I don't think

that argument is right.
What I am saying is that in this case, I think the
system is okay, but I think in this particular case they

40
should have filed an affidavit for prejudice based on
the facts of the mayor's prior knowledge.

The mayor ,

certainly knew about this — Ward was a resident of
Monroeville and the mayor certainly had the kind of
pretrial knowledge that I think would have been a basis
for a valid affidavit for prejudice for interest.
Q

As I understand it, you can't tell us what,

under the law of Ohio, would have happened if the mayor
had said, "Yes, you are right.
MR. ECKSTEIN:

I am prejudiced."

All X can say is 1 would presume

it would be tried by county court judge appointed for that
special purpose or they would appoint some other civilian.
Q

But the law is not clear, as X understand

it?
MR. ECKSTEIN:

There is no provision in the law,

as X have read it, to say who must then take the spot of
the mayor.
X think another question that is worthy of
consideration is what would happen If mayors' courts are
abolished.

X chink that the State of Ohio has indicated

through the Legislature they want to keep them because of
the fact that they do serve the purpose of allowing
defendants to have a hearing, in any event, before a mayor
and not have to miss work and go and appear before a
magistrate,who does have court, like municipal court or

41
county court during the day.
Mayors are part-time employees as far as being
mayor is concerned.

They have court session in the evening

because they work during the daytime.

In fact* you could

argue that more people would be apt to post bond and :
forfeit it rather than miss work and appear before municipal
court judge or county court judge.
Q

Couldn’t you elect a local village judge,

or a magistrate,if you wanted to call him that, in
the same way they elect the mayor and the city council, and
do it at the same time with no great burden?
MR. ECKSTEIN:

Depending upon the holding of this

Court and a change in the State laws you could, Your Honor,
but not under the existing laws.
Q

I wasn’t speaking of the existing law.

You were saying this was impossible of solution.
MR. ECKSTEIN:

I was assuming that if the mayor's

court system, per se, is held to be unconstitutional, that
people would have to go immediately to county court for
relief or municipal court.
Q

Until some other program were set up,

MR. ECKSTEIN:

Depending upon the grounds for

MR. ECKSTEIN:
two3 Your Honor.
Q

Believe it or not, there are only

It is not a very large county.
Does either one of them live in Monroeville,

or hold court in Monroeville?
MR. ECKSTEIN:

The court is held in Willard, Ohio,

where I practice, a town of about 6,000.

The other session

is in the county seat, Norwalk, Ohio, a town of about 12,000

11,000.
Q

And only daytime sessions?

MR. ECKSTEIN:

And these judges hold court during

the daytime.
Q

And not at all at night?

MR. ECKSTEIN:
Q

No.

How does the Village of Monroeville get

its legal advice on a daily basis.

Do they just go to

anybody they want to?
MR. ECKSTEIN:

It is in State law.

They retained

counsel for a period of up to two years, under contract.
I must say that the financial officer

who knows

what's going on — more often than not goes to the State
Auditor's office, rather than to come to counsel.
one of the many bones of contention.

That's

But they receive their

advice from the solicitor, when they ask, or from the
State Auditor, or prosecutor, or whomever they consult.
But I think that this is a unique situation.

The

43
mayor presides also over the sessions of council.

Council

is where the real power is in the small municipality.
have the power to tax.

They

They have the power to spend.

And the mayor’s executive responsibility is limited
if you look at the executive powers vested in the clerktreasurer and the marshal,

street department, whoever else

gets appointed.
In small towns, as a matter of fact, the mayor
does not run the town.

It isn’t an executive office similar

to large cities or similar to the Federal Executive.
I think that if you review the proceeding that
actually went on, that it is susceptible to more than one
interpretation, and I would just respectfully urge the
Court to consider that whether or not the defendant fully
availed himself of all the rights that the State law provided
with respect to trial de novo«which I say did exist and
with respect to an affidavit for prejudice based on other
grounds, and I respectfully submit that the mayor does not
pick any great financial or political fruits from being mayor.
In point of fact, I represent five municipalities
between 1,200, 1,300, and 6,000, that have mayor's courts,
and we've had twelve mayors in the last four years, -I have practiced law four years — and only one was defeated
for reelection. Most of them serve as mayors for a couple of
years and quit because of the hassle and the pay of a couple

44
hundred dollars a year.
They don’t find innocent people guilty just to
get revenue for the city, and I guess, in closing, what I
would

lilce to say is, I don’t think this case is at all

like Turney, and if the Court should find, though, that the
operation of the Monroeville mayor’s court resembles Turney,
I don't think that it is fair to conclude that all mayor's
courts have a high revenue in the mayor's court, or that
all mayors conduct themselves the way this mayor did.
He was provoked.

There was six months publication in

magazines and newspapers, locally, about this particular
event and what had transpired and, I think — I can’t argue
with the fact that the mayor acted improperly at some
points in the hearing, lost his temper, and was not the
fair and impartial judicial officer he should be.
But I don't think that's grounds for finding
that in a substantial number of cases that other mayors —
Q

Are you conceding then that,as applied,

this statute worked an injustice or that this conviction
should be reversed?
MR. ECKSTEIN:

No, I think that if the defendant

had filed an affidavit for prejudice and had cited th5
facts to show —
Q

You seem to have said in plain words that

the mayor In this case acted improperly.

45
MR. ECKSTEIN:

I think that if you look at the

fact that the mayor lost his temper, and — of course, on
the findings of fact, I think, that he made, as far as the
findings are concerned, I don’t think the outcome 'would have
been changed — that’s not relevant.
I think the mayor's losing his temper —
Q

He had prior knowledge of the case from

having investigated it?
MR. ECKSTEIN:

No, not from having investigated

it, but in a small town when the newspapers pick up these
kinds of events and they are republished over six months,
and when newspapers are published, in some cases, to distort
facts, I think that he comes to trial with a kind of prior
knowledge it isn't right.
Q

Did he — was he responsible for the arrest?

MR. ECKSTEIN:
not in charge of police.

No, he was not, and the mayor is
It may say in statutes that he is

the chief conservator of peace.

1 don't know what that means.

The mayor does not set schedules for policemen to
work.

He doesn't tell the policemen bow to do their Job.

The real authority is the safety committee of council which
is responsible for all expenditures, and is really responsible
for the hiring of police*

They are the ones who govern what

the police —
Q

; Who is responsible for bringing charges?

46
MR, ECKSTEIN:

The charges are always brought by

policemen or by people who have witnessed events.
Q

Can he direct those charges be dismissed?

I suppose the mayor can, as a judge.
MR. ECKSTEIN:

I suppose so.

I would presume that

he would have that right, if he felt that the thing were
clearly illegal and the affidavit were clearly improper.
Q

Can he direct that charges be brought?

MR. ECKSTEIN:

I don't think that the mayor —

I know in none of the five towns I represent that he can,
I don’t think that the mayor can direct that charges be
brought.

I think that it is up to the chief of police to

decide how to enforce law.

The only thing the mayor can

do is what he did in this case, which is, he says if there
is a clearcut violation, arrest people, and If there is
not a clearcut violation, forget it.
But I don't think the mayor is deeply involved in
enforcement.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Eckstein

Do you have anything further, Mr. Berkman?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BERNARD A. BERKMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. BERKMAN:

A couple of comments,

The fact that the judge in this case was a truck
driver and the defendant was a truck driver, I think,

47
is not the kind of trial by one’s peers that was intended.

1 would only say that I misspoke in my principal
arguments with respect to the use of the word '\aaee.”

The

record specifically says !’teargas” and I think there is
no constitutional difference.

q

What's it all about?

Mi. SEBKMAN:

There was apparently an altercation

after the attempt by the village constable to flag down the
accused.
This occurred at a parking lot near a restaurant
come 1700 feet beyond the point at which the individual
was flagged down.
His defense was that he had a loaded truck and
that he could not stop iianect lately and it was not safe to
s top his truck there and he pulled into the first location
off the berm where his truck could reasonably stop.
At that point, the village constable now -- or
at the time of the hearing, the chief of police of the city,
took chase in hie automobile.

An altercation took place

there, during which time, Mr. Ward was fait with teargas
from the police officer’s cannis tor.
Q

The mayor wasn’t there.

He had nothing to

do with that at all.

This Court lias a rare opportunity to determine
for itself what — or I should say9 has a rare opportunity
because it has already been determined whether or not the
financial responsibilities of the mayor are 6uch that they
involve him in that kind of activity.
In Turney, the very same statutes that we have
here with respect to the mayor's responsibility, were considered and the court so fined.

Their numbers have been

changed with a renumbering system, but the language, I have
checked and it is identical with respect to the responsi­
bilities of the mayor for the financial affairs of the city.
Q

The facts were quite different with respect

to his salary, and so on.
MR. BERMAN:

Yes.

I am only talking about this

particular aspect of his financial responsibility which
was an: issue here.
I would also urge with respect to the necessary
neutrality, necessary detachment, which is required;
although we have not taken a position that separation of
powers is compelled against the State, we do say that this
Court has drawn a line between judiciary action and police
action in certain areas.

And we have called the Court's

attention in our brief to Coolidge v. Mew Hampshire in
which one of the principal points dealt with the importance
of a neutral and detached judicial officer required to issue

a warning.
And in Shadwick v« Tampa last term, 407 U.S.,
this Court, in distinguishing between whether or not a clerk
could issue an arrest warrant, made it very clear the
neutrality and detachment a judicial officer requires
severance and disengagement from activities of law enforcey3>.

So, it seems to me to be an easy move from
the issuance of warrants to a situation where a determination
is not being made in the threshold issue of probable cause,
but really the ultimate determination of guilt or innocence,
how much more important is it to make sure that the judicial
sad the police officers are not intertwined in that way.
We would urge that in the event that mayor's
courts should be abolished,or the statutory provision dealing
with them should be dealt with appropriately by this Court,
no great inconvenience would occur.
vie are ready to stipulate that same way could be
found in order to take bond forfeitures and pleas of guilty.
Our contention is that when you have a dispute
that court is of no use if we are going to concern ourselves
with minimal standards of due process.
We think that the county courts which have con­
current jurisdiction are available and can set up some kind
of a night procedure or some kind of procedure for bond

50

forfeitures9 and so on, to adapt to the convenience of
the population.

You wouldn’t expect us, as a matter of due

process, to tell them what hours of the day —
MR. BERKMAN:

I am only responding to the
