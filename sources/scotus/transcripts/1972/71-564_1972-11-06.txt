MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in Mo. 71-564, District of Columbia against Carter.
Mr. Barton, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD W. BARTON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BARTON:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court:
The question which is before the court in this case
is whether or not the District of Columbia, a

congressionally

created municipal corporation, is a person within the
meaning of the 1871 Civil Rights Act, H2 USC 1983.
The court below answered the question in the
affirmative*

It is our contention that it should be

answered in the negative.

In this respect we rely upon

the decision of this court In Monroe versus Pape.in a host
;of circuit court decisions elsewhere throughout the country
and upon the legislative history of the 187! Civil Rights
Act.
We start with the proposition that is undisputed
and that is that if the District of Columbia and other
.

municipal corporations are persons within the meaning of
the.l871 Act, It is because and only because the Congress
so intended.
Now, this court, in 196.1 in Monroe versus Pape, in

an unanimous opinion on this point., an opinion offered by
Mr. Justice Douglas, expressly held — as we read the
opinion — that Congress did not Intend municipalities to
be included within the word '’person” as used in the 1871
Act.
The court below held that notwithstanding Monroe
versus Pape , the District of Columbia was a person within
the meaning of that Act and it did so on two independent
grounds; first, that Monroe versus Pape did not hold that
municipalities were not persons within the meaning of the
Act but, rather, held that they were persons within the
meaning of the Act but that municipalities could not be held
liable in damages under the Civil Rights Act to the extent
that they were Immune under local laws.
Now, he court did not phrase it in quite that way
but that is the necessary effect of the court’s holding
because it held that the Civil Rights Act — the word
’’person” as used in that Act — did encompass the District
of Columbia which is, indisputably, a municipal corporation.

In reaching the decision that it did the court
relied upon the legislative history of the X8’?l Civil
Rights Act which was thoroughly explored by this court in
its opinion by Monroe,

It pointed out that one of the

reasons, one of the principal reasons which led to the
so-called "Sherman Amendment” or amendments, there were

two of them, the second one a slightly

watered down version,

indicated that many of the members of the Congress were
then concerned with whether or not the Congress could,
consistent with the Constitution, impose liability upon
municipal corporations.

That issue was very hotly argued.

Some took the position that it could.
position that it could not.

Others took the

But when the Congress rejected

that amendment, the Sherman Amendment — now, the Sherman
Amendment would have made municipalities liable for actions
within their borders by persons riotously and tumultously
assembled together, which was a clear reference to the Ku
Klux

Klan and similar organizations.
That amendment was rejected.

Some, 1 think, rejected

it because they were convinced that it was unconstitutional.
Others perhaps rejected it because they thought it was unwise,
perhaps still others because they thought it was both unwise
and unconstitutional but the amendment was clearly rejected
and as this court unanimously concluded in Monro® versus
Pape, that legislative history is so forceful as a reflection
of the intent of Congress that it would just be Impossible to
conclude that the Congress intended to include municipalities
within the meaning of the term "person” as they used it in
that act.
Now, one of the things that the court below relied
upon was the argument which had been advanced to this court

6
in Monroe versus Pape which is not referred to in its
opinion and that is that in light of the concern of Congress
as to whether or not it could impose liabilities on
municipalities when they were immune under local law, the
court should limit its holding, the one that it eventually
made in Monroe'versus Pape, to a holding that municipalities
are liable under the Civil Rights Act only to the extent
that they are liable under local law.
Now, the second basis for the lower court's decision
was a utilisation of 1988 subtitle 42.

Now, that is the

statute which permits federal courts, when

they are

administering federal laws ~ and this would include 1983 —
to borrow provisions of state laws to assist the federal
court in implementing a right which is given by a federal
statute or the federal Constitution but what the court below
has done here is not utilise section 1988 to implement a
right, but rather to create a right which, under this
court’s decision in Monroe versus Pape, does not exist.
This court said in Monroe versus Pape that there is
no right to bring an action for damages against a municipality
under 1983 so the court made an end run, so to speak, around
that and said, but you can borrow local lav/ and if local
law provides for liability, then you can adopt that liability
and use that to implement the nonexistent remedy that you
have against the municipality under 1983«

7
We submit that that is just not sound reasoning.
It has been rejected by several circuit court decisions, two
in the Seventh Circuit, one in the Ninth Circuit, since the
decision in this case came down.
Those decisions are

MR. BARTON:

There are two Seventh Circuit Court

decisions and those are both cited and referred to in the

■Moor versus Madigan case.

Those were decided in October

and. November of 1971.
»

The second independent ground that the court used
for finding the District of Columbia amenable to suit under

8
the Civil Rights Act was that the legislative history of the
act indicated, again, that the Congress was primarily
concerned with the constitutionality of imposing liability
upon municipalities and that that reluctance to do so which
the Congress gave in to could not have applied to the District
of Columbia, that Congress, under the Constitution, has
plenary jurisdiction over the District of Columbia and it
could, not have been concerned with whether or not it could,
had it chosen to do so, Impose liability upon

the municipal

corporation of the District of Columbia.
That, of course, is quite true as far as it goes;
clearly, the Congress could have done that.

There is

nothing in the legislative history that we have been able to
find that even mentions the District of Columbia or indicates
that Congress was in any way concerned about the District
of Columbia or the applicability of the act to the District
of Columbia.
Q

What you just said leads me to inquire whether

or not it is settled that section of 1983 applies to the
District of Columbia at all,

quite apart from this narrower

question about the liability of a municipality, but certainly
by its legislative history with which I am reasonably
familiar, having written a couple of opinions in the area,
indicates a concern by Congress of what was being done in
the individual states, particularly the states which had

9
recently been involved

in the war between the statas and

the statute talks abouts "Under color of any statute of any
state or territoryI would suppose the legislative
history would indicate., certainly,that Congress wasn't
concerned with the District of Columbia over which it has
exclusive legislative and other control.

Is it settled?

Has it beer?, settled that the District of Columbia, for
purposes of section 1983® is a state or a territory?
ME. BARTOW:
point.

There are cases that touch on that

I cannot say that it is settled but our position

would be that if Congress had given thought to this, it would
perhaps have excluded the District of Columbia expressly.
Q

Well, is it included in that statutory language?

Do you understand it to be?
MR. BARTON:

There are cases which hold, and we do

not cha!3.enge this point, that insofar as the act applies
to employees, that is, offices of the municipal corporation,
it is operable within the
Q

District of Columbia.

That is a police officer, for example, in the

District?
MR., BARTON;
Q

Yes, your Honor.

There is no question of this court so holding,

is there?
I®. BARTON:

No, I don't think there is, your

His holding* as we

that because the Congress could not have

been concerned about its authority

to impose liability

on the District of Columbia since it had plenary power over
the District of Columbia* it intended the act to apply to
the District of Columbia but the main purpose of the act
v/as to give a federal remedy in a federal court,
Q

As

against state action?

MR, BARTON:
Q

Yes.

And here we are talking about a federal

government * one under the complete control of Congress* the
government of the District of Columbia.
MR, BARTON:

Yes* but the only court then in the

District of Columbia was a federal court so there was no
need to give a federal remedy in a federal court if .you had
any remedy at all.

If the act applied, in the District of

Columbia* you would automatically have a remedy in a federal
court,
Q

In other words, before one even got to the

question of the limits* if any* of Monroe against Pape* I

11
should think the preliminary question would be whether
section 1983 is applicable to the District of Columbia or
its employees, officers or agents at all?
MR. BARTON2

Q

Yes, and that issue was not

Not discussed by the court of appeals, not

discussed in either briefs as I understand it,
MR, BARTON:

No, 1 don’t think it is.

The other

side3 I think, does cite two cases in which they say — hold
that the District of Columbia is a territory within the
meaning of the 1871 Civil Rights Act.
Q

There are two decisions, what, of the Court of

Appeals for the District of Columbia?
MR. BARTON:
opinions.

I don’t remember the source of those

They are cited in the brief by respondent, I

believe.
Q

The District of Columbia is surely something

more of a federal instrumentality than a new territory, is
it not?
MR. BARTON:

Yes, it is, of course, under the

plenary jurisdiction of the Congress and any remedy that a
person would have and any court to which a person would go
would be a federal court in the District of Columbia,
certainly in 1871, so that is one of the reasons why we
contend that, notwithstanding the fact that Congress knew
that it could have, had it thought about it, make the act

12
expressly applicable to the District of Columbia or
applicable by implication, It would not have done so had
it

thought about It because, there would have been no need

to do so Insofar as the District of Columbia —
Q

Well, apart from that, Mr. Barton, I thought

the District of Columbia was sui generis

unique., in our

structure as agovernmental entity.
MR. BARTON:
Q
Territory?

It is —

It Is sort of a federal enclave, isn’t it?
You can't carve states out of the District of

Columbia3 can you, constitutionally?
MR, BARTON:

No, not without a constitutional

amendment,
Q

But you can carve states out of the territories,

as we used to know them.
MR. BARTON:

Yes, but I think it was proposed again

just yesterday in the paper that the District of Columbia or
most of it be given back to the State of Maryland but it is,
the present governmental entity, the District of Columbia
is a municipal corporation created about 100 years ago by
the Congress and which does have the power to sue and be
sued.
Q

But doesn't the 18th clause of Article One

deal expressly with Congressional authority to regulate the
affairs of the District of Columbia?

13
MR. BARTON:
Q

Yes.

I thought that gave us rather a different

status from an ordinary territory?
MR. BARTON;
question.

Well, I say;, we have not explored the

I would be delighted to.
Q

Wells 1 gather you have not contested the

applicability of 1983, I think you told us , In an action
brought under it against a police officer* for example.
MR. BARTON:

Now* we did not bring here the question

as to whether or not 1983 was applicable to police officers
as distinguished from the District of Columbia and that is
perhaps why I am not prepared to answer on that but if the
court would like a supplemental memo on that issue, we would
be glad to supply it,
Q

It has already been pointed out that the

compelling reasons for 1983» as with the fourteenth amendment
itself* was to protect individuals against state action, not
against federal action in this context, isn'*t that true?
MR. BARTON:
Q

Yes, but —

And the District of Columbia, acts of the

District of Columbia are federal acts, are they not?
MR. BARTON:

Yes, they are, all applicable law here.

There is no such thing as criminal offense against the
District of Columbia, It is against the United States and,
of course, the laws of the District of Columbia are those

14
enacted by the Federal Congress.
Q

You do have a D.C. code that is different from

the United States’ code.
MR, BARTON;

Ghs yes, many of the

while the

laws are enacted by Congress, it enacts certain legislation
applicable exclusively to the District of Columbia.

Those

laws are codified as the District of Columbia and the
District of Columbia code.

Of course, there are many other

laws that are applicable to the District of Columbia as well
as throughout the country.
Q

That, in part, derives from the fact that

Congress would have no power to enact a great many of the
laws in the District of Columbia code and make them
applicable to the states.
MR. BARTON:
Q

Is that not so?

Yes —

Of course, there is a speed limit for

Iowa or

California or many of the other criminal acts.
MR. BARTON:

Yes, the plenary power which the

Congress enjoys over the District of Columbia is extremely
broad,just about absolute.

It can do just about anything it

wants to consistent with the Constitution for the District
of Columbia.

It is, of course, limited as to what it can do

elsewhere with the Interior operation of municipalities or
states.
The other side contends here that Monroe- versus

15
Pape should be, well, in effect, overruled by this court
and its argument in support of that is that a number of
other lower federal courts have, not withstanding Monroe
versus Papeapplied it in eases seeking injunctive relief .
and that Is true-, there are four circuits which have held
that notwithstanding the. Monroe versus Pape, the — you can
seek injunctive relief against a state municipality.
There are a number of other cases that hold to the
contrary.

Those states that have clone so, have relied upon

footnote 50 in this court’s opinion in Monroe versus Pape.
Several commentators have suggested that they have completely
rewritten or misunderstood that footnote 50 that it does not
hold, as several of the circuit courts concluded it holds,
that they were limiting, the court was limiting its holding
in Monroe versus Pape only to actions for damages and that
you could still bring an action for injunctive relief under
1983? notwithstanding Monroe versus Pape.
That would appear to be completely inconsistent
with the reasoning in Monroe versus Pape because-if a
municipality is not a person within the meaning of the act,
as this court held, then it would not be a person either
for injunctive.relief or for damages but as a recent
district court; In Delaware pointed out, perhaps all this is
de minimus because in none of the cases in which the courts
have granted injunctive relief under 1983 has the municipality

16
been the only entity.

In every other case — in every case

there has been governmental officials, members of the
school boards the city council* the mayor, the police
department or whatnots are members.

If they are amenable

to unjunctive action under the act, it doesn't really add
very much to add the municipality too because a municipality,
of course, can act only through its agents.

If you enjoin

its agents, the members of the school board, the city council,
the chief of police, you are not really adding anything else
•if you enjoin the municipality on top of that.
So those cases, while we submit are not soundly
decided, they do not militate against the soundness of
Monroe versus Pape as we see it.
Thank you, your Honors.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you,

Mr. Barton.

Mr. Kaplan<
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WARREN K. KAPLAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. KAPLAN:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

court:
Several years ago, in a Law Review article written
on the subject of police external review boards, a judge of
the circuit court of appeals for the District of 'Columbia
made mention of the omnipresence of review mechanisms at
every level of our complex form of government, even at the

17
level of the judiciary.

He said, and I quote, "Even the

Supreme Court is not fully immune for in common with all
judges they are at the mercy of the most coldblooded external
review ever devised by man,

I refer to the law professors

who spend six months doing an autopsy on appellate opinion
often written under pressure in four or five days,"
Mr. Chief Justice, I do not know what case, if any,
you had in mind when you wrote those words, but it is
certainly applicable to Monroe versus Pape for in the 12
years that have elapsed since that decision saw printer’s
ink and particularly in the last two or three years, there
has been a continuing barrage of criticism in the law reviews
aimed at that portion of the decision which held.that a city
is not a person within the meaning of section 1983.
The latest addition to that volley of criticism
appeared too recently for inclusion in our brief and I
would like to cite the court to it at this time.

It is a

comment in the University of Virginia Law Review, volume 58,
commencing at page 143 which takes as its text the decision
of the court of appeals in this case and which is entitled,
perhaps somewhat overenthusiastically, "Garter versus
Carlson,, the Monroe Doctrine at Bay.”
Q

Page 143?
*.

MR. KAPLAN:

Yes, sir.

Now, the essence of these

several law review articles which are cited in our brief Is

essentially threefold.

In the first places it has been

pointed out that the historical analysis which underlay this
court’s decision in Monroe misconstrued the significance of
the legislative history of the Sherman Amendment.
Secondly, it has been pointed out that in the
subsequent cases of the lower courts and, indeed, of this
court, the Monroe holding has been departed from, has been
eroded by the many cases which have granted equitable relief
against municipalities and, finally, it has been pointed
out, and we concur in this suggestion, that if it is open
for the court to reexamine

the holding in. Monroe, that all

of the relevant policy considerations militate toward a
different finding, that is, that a city is a person within
the meaning of 1983.
Now, if the court — I shall come back to those
points in just a moment — if this court notwithstanding
these considerations should decline to reexamine its holding
in Monroe at„ thijg, time, then we say that nevertheless the
decision of the court below should be affirmed because
Monroe is distinguishable for the various reasons that were
set forth in the opinion of the court below, that is, that
the rationale of Monroe is inapplicable to municipalities
which are not immune under local law and, secondly, that
the District of Columbia is a unique entity.

But those

arguments 1 would prefer to leave for my brief.

They have

19
been dealt with extensively there and in the opinion of
the court below and I would like to discuss at this time
the reasons for reexamining Monroe as a whole.
Let me respond first to the question raised by
Mr. Justice Stewart a few moments ago as to whether the
District of Columbia is* in fact* involved in section 1983»
I think that this court disposed of that question in Hurd,
versus Hodgea which was a 1947 decision.

It was a companion

case to Shelley versus Kramer and it held that the District
was a state or territory within the meaning of section 1983«
Nows I don't believe that there has been any
question about that,

in any case, since that time.

Now,

there have been a couple of lower court cases which have
been a couple of lower court cases which have repeated that
statement since then.

One is Sewell versus Pegelow, a

Fourth Circuit case found at 291 F«3d 2nd page 196.
Q

Is the Hurd case cited in your brief?

MR. KAPLAN:
Q

No, it is not, your Honor.

Would you give us that citation?

MR. KAPLAN:

I am sorry, your Honor, I don't

remember the citation.
Q

Q

291 Fed 2nd, 196?

MR. KAPLAN:
Q

Yes, sir.

I think your brother said that there were a

couple of citations In your brief, but I did not find them.
MR. KAPLAN:

I don't recall that there were on that

point because it had not ever been raised.
If I may turn briefly to the legislative history,
which I think is very important in this case, this court
predicated its holding in Monroe

virtually exclusively on

the legislative history of 1983» the Sherman Amendment.
Subsequent research has indicated that that historical
analysis misconstrued the significance of the Sherman
Amendment and the matters that were put forth in debate on
the Sherman Amendment.
Now, if one reads the legislative — the

21
Congresaxonal Globe of 1871 and the measure that is here
under discussion, that is, 1983 and its amendments, it takes
up virtually the entire first session of the 42nd. Congress ,
more than some 500 pages of 6-point type., three columns' to
the page.
If one reads through that considerable literature,
one comes to two rather significant conclusions.

The first

is that when the Congress was debating what is now section
1983 itself, it never mentioned municipal liability and the
second is that when it discussed the Sherman Amendment, in
which context it did discuss municipal liability, it was
talking about something very different from what was
involved until 1983 and the principal objections to the
Sherman Amendment are not applicable to the consideration
of municipal liability under 1983.
Now, 1983 was first discussed on March 25th, 1871
and I must fcalce a moment to go into this history in some
detail.

This was pursuant to a message from President Grant

that was received on March 23rd of that year, urging the
Congress to enact some

effectual legislation to vindicate

Fourteenth Amendment rights.

From March 25th for a period of

sex’-eral days, approximately 10 days from March 25th, 1983
itself was discussed gfc great length in the house and it was
finally passed in the house with no mention whatever of.
municipal liability.

It then went to the Senate, where it

22
was again discussed for several days with no mention of
municipal liability,
On April 15th, just before the vote came, in the
Senate» the so-called '’Sherman Amendment," which would have
Imposed riot damage liability on municipalities without
fault — that amendment was added Just before the vote came.
There was no debate and the amendment, the Sherman Amendment
in. 1983 itself, was

passed by the Senate so that on

April 15th, after nearly 20 days of debate, 1983.. without
the Sherman Amendment in the House, with the Sherman
Amendment in the Senate, had been passed by both branches
without any debate whatever on municipal liability.
It was only after that point, when, it went back to
the House, that there ensued the vigorous debate over the
Sherman Amendment and the essence of the opposition to the
Sherman Amendment was not any hostility to the idea of
municipal liability per se, rather, it was hostility to the
Idea of municipal liability without fault.
Representative Kerr, one of the most articulate
opponents of the Sherman Amendment, made it very clear on
April 19th, at page 788 of the Congressional Globe, when he
said, "Of course —n in effect, "Of course there would be no
objection to this bill if it merely imposed liability for
a breach of a duty which a municipality had."

He pointed

to examples which existed at the time of municipal liability

for failure to repair streets or bridges where there was a
duty.

In fact, he even said there would be no objection

to municipal liability for riot damage.

If there were some

fault involved, if there were acquired — and there were
other statutes in existence at this time of this nature in
New York, Maryland, and Pennsylvania ---■ if there were fault
on the part of the municipal officials, the Maryland statute
at the time, I believe, provided that there would be
liability for riot damage if the municipal authorities had
noticed that the riot was going to occur and that it was
within their

power to prevent it and did nothing.

In that situation, municipal liability would have
been all right and, in fact, on April 20th, when 1983 was
finally passed in. the House, It was with a substitution for
the Sherman Amendment which was consistent with
Representative Kerrss feelings.

That substitution is now-

sect ion 1985, the so-called "passive accompliceprovision
which provides that if anyone Is aware that a deprivation of
civil rights is going to take place and takes no steps to
prevent it but has it in his power to prevent It or aid in
preventing it, then he, too., is liable.
Q

I don't like to interrupt your argument, but

I have just been looking at Hurd and Hodge.

That does not

involve 1983* it involves a very different section, 1978,
which is the present 19823 I think.

every state and every territory and in the District; of
Columbia.

1983, by contrast, has quite a different

legislative history and shows concern with the action of
state officers in those states which, to use Congresses
rather tactless words in those days, ”had lately been a
rebellion against the Union,” and why would, in the light of
that legislative history, would 1983 apply to the District

25
of Columbia, which is entirely under the aegis or the
supervision and power of the Congress of the United States?
MR. KAPLAN;

Well, I think, your Honor, that the

objectives of the ~ all of the sections of the Civil Right
Act are sufficiently common so as to apply to the District
of Columbia as other state or territorial subdivisions.
Certainly, it would be an anomalous result if a citizen who
was assaulted by a policeman across the District Line In
Montgomery County had a constitutional cause of action and
his brother, who lives just across the line here in the
District of Columbia, did not, for a similar injury.
Q

Well, in 1983. Monroe did not have any

constitutional dimensions at all, did it?
MR. KAPLAN:
Q

Well, the objection —

We did not say that it

was unconstitutional

to allow a municipality to be sued, did we?
MR. KAPLAN:
Q

No.

No —

It is purely a question of statutory

construction.
MR. KAPLAN:

Yes, your Honor, yes.

Of course,

1983 itself was aimed at vindicating the l4th amendment
rights.

It was passed pursuant to section five of the

l4tn amendment.
Q

I don't

quite see the anomaly that you

describe, Mr. Kaplan, saying that it would be ah anomaly if

26
in a state, a man had an action, cause of action, based on
an act of Congress that was designed to prevent states from
depriving people of constitutional rights, but he did not
have the same cause of action here in the District where
Congress is the sole legislative body.
MR. KAPLAN;

Well, while Congress is the sole

legislative body, the police here are essentially locally
controlled, just as they are in Montgomery County or
' Fairfax County.
Q

What has that got to do with the anomaly under

a statute like 1933?
MR. KAPLAN;

Well, X suppose, your Honor, that what

1 am saying, put in other ways, is that it would be small
consolation to a citizen of the District who finds himself
the victim of police brutality to know that he does not have
a cause of action against his assailant, unlike his neighbor
who lives across the District Line, simply because the
District is a federal entity.
Q

That would be no consolation at all.

Q

He5d be ruined by his right to vote, while he

is at i -.
MR. KAPLAN;
Q
of them?

Well ~

While you are at it, why don’t you solve all
All the problems?

MR. KAPLAN:

Well, that is not involved in this

27

case,, of course.
Q

He might have all sorts of rights in the

District of Columbia under the law of the District of
Columbia,, under the federal common law, or statutory law
against the policeman or the policeman’s superior, but
the question here is the applicability of a statute which
was denied to curb actions under color of state law,
MR. BARTON:
Q

Well —

And to give — to confer federal jurisdiction

upon such actions.

Mow, here in the District of Columbia,

all the courts are federal courts.
MR, BARTON:

Well, your Honor, I would respond to

that only by saying in the message to Congress from
President Grant on March 23rd in which he requested them to
enact this sort of legislation, he said, "I urgently
recommend such legislation as in the judgment of Congress
shall effectually secure life, liberty and property and the
enforcement of law in all parts of the United States.”
He was not restricting the impact of this legislation
to the states.
Q

How did it affect the legislation with which

Congress responded to that message?

That is what we have to

try to devolve.
MR. KAPLAN:

Well, as your Honor —- as has been

pointed out. there has never been any question raised In this

28
case as to whether it was applicable to the District.
Q

You are quite right in pointing out that Judge

Basse Ion assuming it and cited Hurd against Hodge which , on
examination, does not stand for what he said it did.
MR. KAPLAN:

Well, as Mr. Barton volunteered, I, too,

would volunteer if the court wishes supplementary memoranda
on this point.
Q

Have there been any attempts since Monroe and

Pape to get the statute amended to include municipalities?
MR. KAPLAN:

The Civil Rights Commission, your

Honor, in 1966, I believe, did suggest the — U.S. Commission
on Civil Rights

did suggest that legislation should be

passed so as to make municipalities liable for 1983
deprivations.

I don't know that there has been any action

on the part of Congress to do that but of course, as this
court has pointed out on various occasions, legislation —
Q

Just as a matter of curiosity, I wonder, have

there been actually bills introduced or hearings in Congress?
MR.-KAPLAN:

I am not aware of _ an-y y your .Honor.

But since the exemption of municipalities came
about as a result of

a

judicial decision by this court, I

think that the reinstatement of municipalities as proper
defendants could come about by the same routej although
legislation would certainly be welcome, 1 don’t think that
in this case it would be necessary.

Wella I would like to come back just for a moment
to the legislative history in what is now section 1986 which
was the substitution for the Sherman Amendment.

We have a

statute whlch imposes liability where there is fault s where
there is knowledge that the

deprivation is going to occur

and the defendant is in a position where he could aid or
aid in preventing the deprivation and there is their
liability»
That meets the objection of the Sherman Amendment
that Representative Kerr felt was so important so that the -~
that substitution is, I think, consistent with the notion
that there should be liability where there is fault.

It is

consistent with the notion that a municipality may be a
person within the meaning of Section 1983.
Since this court5s decision in Monroe, as counsel
has pointed outs there have been several circuits, the
fourth and fifth, the seventh, the tenth, which have, not
withstanding the very clear mandate of this court in footnote
'50 to Monroe, which have stated that a municipality may,
nevertheless, be a person for 1983 purposes where
relief is sought.

equitable

This court has, in fact, Indicated its

approval of that distinction in the subsequent cases of
Turner versusCity of Memphis, Tinker versus Des Moines,
MacNeice versus Board of Education in which, without
discussing the point, the court implicitly approved the

30
granting of equitable relief against the state subdivisions„
I think that the attempts made by some commentators
to rationalise this distinction between the granting of
equitable relief end the granting of damages cannot withstand
close analysis,

Now, the rationalization that is most often

put forth is that equitable relief Involves a lesser threat
to the municipal treasury and, therefore, a municipality
may be a person for equitable purposes where it would not be
if the claim

were for damages.

But the problem with that distinction , the problems
are three-fold.

First of all, it Is inconsistent with 1933

itself, which expressly says that where there 'is' '■— where you
have a person who is depriving another person of his 14th
amendment rights, he shall be liable in an action for
damages or equitable relief or any other proper proceeding.
Secondly, it is inconsistent with the facts of the
matter, the fact of the matter being that equitable relief
may frequently involve the expenditure of very large sums of
money, much more than are apt to be involved in an action
for damages.
For example, in a ease of Harkless versus Sweeny
Independent School Board which came before this term -before this court last term and which the court denied
certiorari, there was an action by ten black schoolteachers
for reinstatement and back pay under section 1983.

They had

31
been out of work for some five years and the fifth circuit
granted reinstatement and back pay under the guise of granting
equitable relief., although the payment of some several
hundred thousand dollars was potentially involved.
In the ease of Griffin versus Prince Edward County a
I don't believe that came up under 1983» but it was an
example of the granting of equitable relief at enormous cost
to the state subdivision.

This court ordered the Prince

Edward County schools to be reopened.
Finally., this distinction between equitable relief
and legal relief is inconsistent with the statements of
this court in the Bivens case decided last term in which the
court indicated that where there is jurisdiction to grant
equitable relief* there ought also to be jurisdiction to
grant legal relief.
the
I think that /proposition that we are contending
for, that is,that the courta upon reexamining its holding in
Monroe 3should conclude that a municipality is'

or may be a

person within the meaning of 1983 s is consistent not only
with the legislative history and not only with the
subsequent post~Honroe cases granting equitable reliefs but
it is also consistent with the overall purpose of 1983 as
expressed by President Grant and with contemporary notions
of social justice.
We no longer believe, as people did 200 years ago.

32

in the case of Russell versus Men of Devon, that it is better
for an individual to suffer an injury than for the public to
suffer some inconvenience.
Contemporary notions of risk-spreading are so wellentrenched that just within the last dozen years,since Monroe,
in some 2? jurisdictions, the doctrine of sovereign has been
partially or wholly abrogated, either judicially or through
legislation and, in some nine other jurisdictions, munici­
palities may be liable in an action of damages where they
have insurance.

And all that has occurred just almost

entirely since this court’s decision in Monroe.
Finally, municipal liability is essential if we are
to achieve th© two-fold objectives of determents of police
misconduct and compensation for that misconduct when it
occurs.
Police misconduct, as was pointed out by the U.S.
Commission on Civil Rights in 1961, has been and continues to
be a very serious problem in this country.
a few weeks ago there carae across my desk an

In fact, just
American Bar

Association report, a tentative draft of standard's relating
to the urban police function, which says, "The continuing
failure to devise and Implement necessary procedures and
sanctions to deal with police abuses is ono of the most
critical problems now confronting our society.8?

And that is

net the American Civil Liberties Union talking or the U.S.

33
Commission on Civil Rights.

That Is the American Bar

Association,
Q

Aren't they concerned in that report with

probing the practice and procedure?

They are not concerned

with the rights of third persons, are they?,.
MR. KAPLAN:

Well® 1 think not — I believe they ares

your Honors concerned with the rights of third persons as
well.
Q

■ • Vt

MR. KAPLAN:

Well,"! believe we are concerned with

that3 too, but I think it is clear that we are also concerned
with tort liability to third persons because they go on to
urge that sovereign Immunity should be abrogated by judicial
decisions where it still remains.
I think they are concerned with all of those purposes.
Of course, as far as compensation la concerned,
there can be no meaningful compensation for victims of police

brutality without municipal liability.

.

..vr.,. ir••

The court, in Mapp

versus Ohio,, and the Fourth Circuit in Lankford versus Gelston
and other courts in other cases have taken judicial notice of
the fac; that policemen are notoriously unsatisfactory
defendants in*tort cases, that they are habitually and

incorrigibly judgment-proof.

When they can be found — and

this case presents still another example of why they are
unsatisfactory defendants, for In this

cases the defendant,

John Carlson, who on August 19th put on a pair of brass
knuckles and beat the plaintiff’s face into a bloody pulp,
has not even been found for service of process.

So that

there frequently can be no compensation for victims of
police brutality without municipal liability and that has
been pointed out by a vast number of commentators.
Well, I would say, finally, that another reason
municipal
for imposing/liability is that which is put forth by Judge
Nichols in his concurring opinion in this case and that is,
to give some protection to the policeman so that the police­
man will know that he does not any longer stand alone, that
he has the municipality on his side to provide a defense
for him.
1 believe that all of these relevant —- all of the
relevant policy considerations point unequivocally to the
imposition of municipal liability.
X see that my

time has

all but expired and I

would like to leave the court with one further thought and
that is this:

In the

for more than, a century now, the

paper promises of the fourteenth amendment have for very
many of us citizens in many parts of this country and in
many aspects of their lives, particularly where police

35
misconduct is concerned, have remained essentially that,
that is, paper promises.

In this case, at this time, this

court has a rare opportunity, the first such opportunity
since Monroe

7,Pape

was argued 12 years ago this week, to

transform those paper promises into meaningful reality.
Now, I know that Mr. Carter, the respondent in this
case who sits in the back of this room today, had not fully
understood all of the dialogue that has just transpired,
filled as it unavoidably was with legal and complex
abstractions and jargon of our profession, but he and the
hundreds of Melvin Carters across this land will understand
the impact of this court's decision and it is on his and
their behalf that I most earnestly and respectfully urge
this court not to let this opportunity of

putting teeth

into the 14th amendment pass to pacified exercise.
Thank you very much.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Kaplan.

Mr. Barton, do you have anything further?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD W. BARTON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. BARTON:
reexamine Monroe,

The respondent asks this court to

As Mr. Justice Douglas, the author of

Monroe just stated, it was not decided on constitutional
grounds but upon the intent of Congress and this court has
said over and over again that, absent the clearest showing of

36
error’s it will not reexamine nonconstitutional questions»
In response to Mr. Justice Stewart's question a
little while ago to me, Hurd versus Hodge and Sewell versus
Pegslow were the two cases I had in mind.

Hurd, as

Mr. Justice Brennan said, did not involve the 1.983 hut it
was cited by Judge Sobeloff in Sewell versus Pegelow for
that proposition and Judge Baselon In this ease has picked
that up, too.
Thank you, your Honors.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Gentlemen, I think it

might be useful in this ease in view of some of the
developments that occurred during oral argument, for you
to submit supplemental memos if you would like covering
these factors that you referred to in the Hurd and the
Sewell cases.

It might help us unravel the situation.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 3:01 o'clock p.m., the case
was submitted.)
