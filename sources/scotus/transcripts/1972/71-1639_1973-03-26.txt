We will hear arguments

in 71-1639, Broadrick against Oklahoma.
Mr. Buckingham, you may proceed whenever you’re
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN C. BUCKINGHAM, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. BUCKINGHAMS

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Courts
This case is on appeal from a three-judge Federal
Court decision, denying appellants

civil class action for

injunctive relief to enjoin the deprivation of the civil
rights of the appellants and all classified employees of
the State of Oklahoma,
The appellees, the State Personnel Board, initiated
proceedings against the appellant seeking to dismiss that
appellant from employment by the State Corporation Commission
for alleged political activities under Title 74 Oklahoma
Statutes, Section 818.
This action by the State Personnel Board precipitated
the filing of the suit in Federal Court,
The questions presented in this appeal may be briefly
stated as follows;
May a State by statute proscribe in broad and
general terms First Amendment rights of State employees?

4
And, two, may a State constitutionally classify the
employees of some but not all of its State agencies and
broadly prohibit the employees of those agencies from enjoying
First Amendment rights while permitting the unclassified
employees of the State,all other public employees, and the
citizenry at large to freely enjoy the same.
Now, we urge to this honorable Court that such
proscriptions by State statute are wanting in constitutional
acceptability of the First, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments
to the Constitution.
If the political activities prohibition provisions
of the Hatch Act, in the previous case, are found to be
subject to successful challenge as being vague and overbroad,
a fortiori the political activities prohibition provisions
of the Oklahoma Merit Act should be determined constitutionally
wanting.
If, however, the political activities prohibition
provisions of the Hatch Act are found to be constitutionally
sound, it does not necessarily follow that the political
activities proscriptions of the Oklahoma Merit Act are
constitutionally well-founded.

As said proscriptions are

inherently distinguishable from prohibition provisions of
the Hatch Act.
QUESTION: Which would you regard as more lenient to
the two items?

5
MR, BUCKINGHAM:

I would suggest that the Hatch Act

is more lenient,
QUESTION:

Let me ask you another question, while

I have you interrupted.

When this action was begun, whether

or not State disciplinary proceedings were pending?
MR. BUCKINGHAM:

There were, sir.

QUESTION: Could one

than say that the Federal Court

should have abstained?
MR. BUCKINGHAM:

No, sir.

particular instance, because

j

We feel in this

facially the statutes involved,

which predicated the action against the State employees, are
both so vague and broad as to permit the Federal Courts, under
1983, because of the civil rights question involved, to rule
specifically on that statute.

Abstention, to make all

additional employees who may have conduct

the State

Personnel Board feels should warrant some kind of action, a
prosecutory action, tinder these two sections.
We feel that it is untenable when you read the two
statutes.
QUESTION:

Well, but didn't Younger v. Harris

involve a claim of over-facial, overbreadth, too, didn't it?
Isn't really the only distinction between that and this is
that this is civil and that was criminal?
MR. BUCKINGHAM:

No, sir.

We feel in our particular

case and this particular statute, as you know in the Hatch Act

6

and further Acts, there are some proscribed permitted
activities, political activities? perhaps not non-partisan
activities.

The Oklahoma statute does not describe any

permitted political activities of any kind, other than a
private expression and the right to vote.
Where they use such terms as "you may not take part
in any affairs" —
QUESTION*

But in the proceedings that were pending,

what were they, administrative proceedings?
MR. BUCKINGHAM*

No, sir.

They are administrative

proceedings insofar as the determination under the Oklahoma
Merit Act, or the charges are valid and they will be discharged
from their jobs.
In addition, under the particular Act, if they are
discharged, criminal actions in the nature of misdemeanor
can also be brought against them.
QUESTION* Well, what I’m not clear about is, what
proceedings were pending when this action was brought?
MR. BUCKINGHAM:

The proceedings that were pending

were an action by the State Personnel Board to, in effect,
have the Corporation Commission show cause why these employees
and these employees should not be dismissed from their jobs.
QUESTION*

Brought where?

MR. BUCKINGHAM: By the State Personnel Board —
before the State Personnel Board,

7
QUESTION; Well, that's what I say.

It was pending,

then, before an agency.
MR. BUCKINGHAM;
QUESTION:

That's right.

There was no court proceeding at that

time.
MR. BUCKINGHAM: That is correct, sir.
QUESTION:

So I gather, if this is a 1983 suit,

your thought would be that there's no requirement —
MR. BUCKINGHAM:
QUESTION:

— in actions under that section —

MR. BUCKINGHAM:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir.

— without administrative remedy?

MR. BUCKINGHAM: That is correct, sir.
QUESTION:

Now, what's the basis of that?

MR. BUCKINGHAM: Well, sir, because it —
QUESTION:

I thought normally there had to be an

exhaustion of administrative remedies.
MR. BUCKINGHAM:

Well, sir, in this particular

instance we feel that under the — although this question was
not the one in issue that was raised in this particular case,
it was agreed by the —
QUESTION*

Is this a jurisdictional matter or —

MR. BUCKINGHAM:

No, sir» this is not a juris­

dictional —
QUESTION; So you don't — you think the State, if it

8
had a defense in this regard, or somehow, it just isn't —
MR. BUCKINGHAM:

It isn't before the Court in this

case; yes, sir.
If it was, it was a — that question as to whether
or not 1983 was appropriate was not raised in the District
Court. The case is up here on the question involving the
curtailment of First Amendment rights.
QUESTION: But it came from the Federal Court to here.
MR. BUCKINGHAM:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

And they could notice it if it were

plain error.
MR. BUCKINGHAM:

I would assume you probably could —

QUESTION: But you brought it under 1983, didn't
you?
MR. BUCKINGHAM:

Pardon?

QUESTION: Was that your jurisdictional ground, 1983?
MR. BUCKINGHAM:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

That's correct,

Well, haven't we in many cases held that

in actions under 1983 there's no requirement to exhaust
administrative remedies?
MR. BUCKINGHAM:

Yes, sir, you have.

QUESTION: And that's your answer?
MR. BUCKINGHAM:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

It is.

Do you know of any case that an

administrative proceeding like this was disregarded?

9

MR. BUCKINGHAM:
QUESTION:

Do I —

In any decisions of this Court?

MR. BUCKINGHAM:

No, sir, we have not — I think

insofar as the State Personnel Board is concerned, if you're
talking about Oklahoma, Mr. Justice, I think this may be the
first case that the State Personnel Board has brought under
the so-called political prohibition section.
QUESTION:

Mr. Buckingham, you've never had an

authoritative decision from your State courts?
MR. BUCKINGHAM:

Sir, we have two decisions

involving the Oklahoma Merit Act, and this simply were questions
raised as to the validity of the Merit Act, and essentially
whether or not they could delegate certain rule-making
functions to the State Personnel Board,
But insofar as the question of First Amendment
rights, and the particular Section 818, which is before this
Court, there have not been any substantive rules,
QUESTION:

Mr. Buckingham# are you challenging

the Oklahoma statute because of vagueness?
MR. BUCKINGHAM:
QUESTION:

And overbreadth, both, sir.

I've read what counsel has presented,

both in the Jurisdictional Statement and in your Brief, and
I don't find a mention of the word, of vagueness anywhere.
Your opposition argues it.
I wondered whether you had conceded to this, that the

10

statute was not vague?
MR. BUCKINGHAMS

No, sir, we have not, Your Honor.

I thought I had used the phrase *vagueness and overbreadth",
and I specifically direct your attention to —- if I may, and I
think it would assist the Court, if I could read these two
short provisions that are involved, the sections that we're
actually complaining of.

Then I think I can point out the

problem.
Supra, unnumbered paragraph six states:
"No employee in the classified service, and no
member of the Personnel Board shall, directly or indirectly,
solicit, receive, or in any manner be concerned in soliciting
or receiving any assessment, subscription or contribution for
any political organization, candidady or other political
purpose;" — "or other political purpose" — "and no state
officer or state employee in the unclassified service shall
solicit or receive any such assessment, subscription or
contribution from an employee in the classified service,"
Next, unnumbered paragraph sevens
"No employee in the classified service shall be a
member of any national, state or local committee of a
political party, or an officer or member of a committee of a
partisan political club, or a candidate for nomination or
election to any paid public office, or shall take part in the
management or affairs of any political party or in any

11
political campaign, except to exercise his right as a citizen
privately to express his opinion and to cast his vote."
I respectfully suggest, sir, that what — you could
not hardly get more vague than the use of the phrase "the
affairs of a political party".
QUESTION; That may be, but I was worried if that
question was presented; and I find nothing like that in your
«

brief.
QUESTION:

Which of your Questions Presented?

Perhaps we can get at it more specifically.

Which of the

Questions Presented, as you read them, do you think presents
that issue?
MR. BUCKINGHAM;

Well, I could very honestly state

to the Court, I think that the Court is probably correct,
insofar as I have not in any way, in either the brief that
I filed or the Jurisdictional Statement, used, utilized and
specifically pointed out that word of the statute.

I have

used generalities in terms of referring to the statute being
overbroad and vague, the vagueness.
I humbly submit to you that by virtue of —
QUESTIONs

Well, in the third Question, on page 5

of your Jurisdictional Statement, there is "Taking part in
the management or affairs of any political party".
MR, BUCKINGHAM:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION: But, in any event, you’re not conceding

12
that?
MR. BUCKINGHAMS

No, sir.

We feel that it is patently obvious that the
political activity proscription of the Oklahoma Merit Act
impairs First Amendment rights of Oklahoma State employees
in the classified service.
QUESTIONS

Here, your No. 3 is almost precisely

the language of the Hatch Act, is it not?
Or at least its thrust is precisely the same:
"management or affairs".
MR. BUCKINGHAM:

Yes, sir; that is correct.

QUESTION: So in that sense you do not think it is
either more broad or less broad than the preceding case?
MR. BUCKINGHAM:

Well, I would have to agree, Your

Honor, that if itfs about the same language, it could not be
either one way or the other.
QUESTION:

Well, but this line is taken directly

from the unnumbered paragraph seven.
MR. BUCKINGHAM:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

It's an exact quotation of the language,

isn’t it?
MR. BUCKINGHAM:
QUESTION:

That's correct, yes, sir.

Well, I suppose your State courts might

give those words a different reach than what a Federal court
can reach in the Federal statute, might it not?

MR. BUCKINGHAM:

Yes, sir.

That is a possibility,

also.
QUESTION: The identity of the words don’t mean that
much, do they?
MR. BUCKINGHAM:
QUESTION:

No, sir.

Did the three-judge District Court

before whom your case went in Oklahoma have to construe this
statute in order to reach the determination that it did?
MR. BUCKINGHAM:
QUESTION:

In —

It’s hard to tell from their opinion,

I would think.
MR. BUCKINGHAM:

Yes, sir.

Prom their order, I — insofar as the construction
is concerned, the Jurisdictional Statement has attached to
it the opinion of the three-judge Federal Court, and I can't
go beyond what they state there as to what they did, as far
as construing it.
Additionally, it is obvious that the political
activities proscription of the Oklahoma Merit Act affecting
only those State employees who are in the classified service
is repugnant to the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment to the Constitution.
In this regard, we’d like to request respectfully
that the Court direct its attention to page 29 of the Answer
Brief of the Attorney General, which seems to suggest that the

14
difference between classified and unclassified employees
coincides with the classification of ministerial and policy­
forming officers.
In other words, it seems to indicate that the
Attorney General feels that the policy-forming officers are
generally unclassified.
Then if you go to the Merit Act involved, which
sets forth the unclassified employees, I respectfully submit
that these are some of the unclassified employees, subsection
(8) "patient and inmate help in the state charitable, penal,
mental and correctional institutions;"
Subparagraph (13) "temporary seasonal farm laborers,
or other farm help engaged in a single phase of agricultural
production or harvesting, not to exceed one hundred twenty
calendar days in any year;"
Sub (15) "laborers, semiskilled or skilled
craftsmen temporarily engaged for purposes of building,
renovation, or remodeling and paid on an hourly# or piecework
basis, provided the request if made by the appointing authority
and is approved by the State Personnel Board."
QUESTION: Well, doesn't that mean that the ingaact,
as he's reading the statute, is that the people on the very top
and the people on the very bottom are not covered, for
totally different reasons?
MR. BUCKINGHAM: Well, sir, I read it a little

15
differently# insofar as unclassified —
QUESTION: Well# you excluded part-time farm labor
for policy reasons# which is a matter of —
MR. BUCKINGHAM;

I couldn't -- I would have to

agree# I can't see that that is a policy that —
QUESTION:

You might want to cover the man who's

head of the agricultural department# as a policy maker.
MR. BUCKINGHAM:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION: The question is whether they've done that
as precisely as they should.
MR. BUCKINGHAM:

Well, under the Act there are

certain designated agencies which are designated as classified#
certain employees are classified; then the Governor may select
certain classified employees.

I think# as you will note in

the Jurisdictional Statement# and see these sections on
unclassified employees# there are some 22 different, various
exemptions under the statute for unclassified employees.
Nov;, it's hard for us to conceive how a secretary
working in the Corporation Commission as a typist# wearing a
political button endorsing a candidate, how this is
relevant to some governmental purpose where she should be
deprived of her rights to wear this button, as opposed to a
secretary in the Attorney General's office.
QUESTION: Does the term "classified" in your
statute connote job tenure of some sort?

16

MR. BUCKINGHAM;

Well, I would assume, sir, that

classified would connote some kind of tenure insofar as
connection with the Oklahoma Merit Act, some kind of a
permanency in that regard.
QUESTION; And so what the Legislature has basically
done, in saying that employees who have that kind of tenure
are barred from this type of political activity, and employees
who don't have that kind of tenure aren't barred?
MR. BUCKINGHAM;
QUESTION;

That would be a rationale.

Incidentally, your named plaintiffs

were employees of the Corporation Commission?
MR. BUCKINGHAM; That is correct, sir.
QUESTION;

Is this a partisan office in Oklahoma?

MR. BUCKINGHAM;

No, sir, it’s an elected office.

There are three different Commissioners who constitute the
State Corporation Commission, each is elected every two years,
and they have a race, just like any other race, there are
nominations of Democrats and Republicans or other parties.
It usually draws numerous amount of candidates, and then a
party, a person is elected to that office,
QUESTION; Then it is partisan?
MR, BUCKINGHAMS
Commissioners are, yes.

Yes, it is a part of the — the
If you say partisan in reference to

that they are a Democrat or a Republican, I can't think of a
time when an Independent has been elected, which are non-Party

17
members.
QUESTION:

You say they run under Party labels?

MR. BUCKINGHAM: Well, it's an open race, sir.
Independents can run, and Democrats and Republicans can,
in the Primary.
QUESTION:

And what are they, four-year terms or

six-year —
MR. BUCKINGHAM: Six-year terms, sir,
QUESTION: Six-year terms.

There are three of them.

What's the salary of the office, do you know?
MR. BUCKINGHAM:
QUESTION:

$19,500?

MR, BUCKINGHAM:
QUESTION:

$19,500.

Yes, sir, for the Chairman,

For the Chairman; and $19,000 for the

members,
MR. BUCKINGHAM:

Yes, Sir.

QUESTION: And what are the functions of the office —
of the Commission?
MR, BUCKINGHAM: The Corporation Commission itself
has rather broad and extensive functions, generally regulating
public utilities and such, and next they're regulating various
oil companies, that we refer to in the area of oil and gas
conservation and related matters.
QUESTION:

Transportation —

It has some of the same functions as the

Railroad Commission does in —

18

MR. BUCKINGHAM:
QUESTION:

Mr. Buckingham.

MR. BUCKINGHAMS
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, very similar.

Yes, sir?

I think I understood you to say that

you would consider the Oklahoma Act more restrictive than the
Federal Act.
MR. BUCKINGHAM:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION: Did you say because the word “privately"
is in the Oklahoma Act?
MR. BUCKINGHAM:

No, sir.

If I did, I'm sorry, I

misled the Court, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Well, I’m sure you didn't mean —

MR. BUCKINGHAM:

Yes.

The Hatch Act does

recognize certain political activity, which they recognize
that employees could engage in.

In other words, there is an

affirmative provision in the Hatch Act; if it's non-partisan
political activities.
There is no such language in the Oklahoma statute.
Now, there is no recognition of any kind of
activity, political activity, that you can engage in, other
than if you would consider the right to vote and to privately
hold an opinion as being a political activity that you can
engage in.
In this respect we’re saying that the Oklahoma Act
is more restrictive

19

QUESTIONS

In the opinion of the three-judge

court, paragraph 9, Conclusions of Law, there is an interpreta­
tion of your Act, to the effect that it does not restrict
"public and private expressions on public affairs and
personalities so long as the employee does not channel his
activity towards party success."
Assuming for the moment that the Court had authority
to interpret Oklahoma law, would you accept that as a fair
interpretation?
MR. BUCKINGHAMS

No, sir.

I think recently the

Attorney General who's in this case, actually we're referring
not towards party success, there was a candidate involved in
the city election, which was non-partisan, where an activity
was taking part by, as I understand, a Corporation Commission
employee, and the charges were found invalid of the political
prohibition section of the Oklahoma Merit Act,
Now, that seems to negate that determination in the
Federal Court's Finding No. 9.

At least the State Personnel

Board didn't feel that that would be a prohibition against
them bringing charges against an enployee who perhaps indicated
a preference for a candidate if he's running for a city office,
not on a partisan, political basis.
The Attorney General, throughout his brief, infers
that the object and/or aim of the Oklahoma Merit Act was
directed at the evils of partisan politics, equating partisan

20

politics with evil.
Now, the appellant in this case strongly dissents
to that type of a conclusion.

The evils the Act were

directed against were the coercion, intimidation, and misuse
of authority which might exploit the employees by governmental
superiors.
We respectfully suggest the Act was not directed
against a voluntary participation in partisan political
activities by a classified State employee.

And in this regard

we point out that the purpose clause of the Merit Act simply
sets forth what you would expect a purpose clause to provide,
to provide all citizens a fair and equal opportunity for
public service, to establish conditions of service which will
attract officers and employees of character and ability.
QUESTION:

Well, isn’t there another factor that

the Legislature takes into account, that is that they don’t
want to put a premium on having a man enlarge his staff of
any particular department so in order to have that many more
people to work on political activities?
MR* BUCKINGHAM:

Oh, I believe —

QUESTION: That's a legitimate factor?
MR. BUCKINGHAM:
you, yes.

Yes, sir.

I have to agree with

That most certainly, undoubtedly, is in the mind of

many Legislators, insofar as enacting prohibitions.
But what we're saying in this case very simply is

21
that there is a suggestion, well, what can you do?

Just strike

on this particular provision, political prohibition provision,
that's a rather drastic step.
Isn't there an easier way?

Wouldn't it be difficult

to draft a statute?
I suggest to you that it would be difficult to
draft a statute, but you could have drafted a statute where
you positively set forth what particular political activities
could be enjoyed by all employees.

As opposed to proscribing

a blanket prohibition of those acts which they cannot do.
This seems as a possibility as an answer.

And I

suggest that it appears to me, with the vast number of State
employees that we have, both in Oklahoma and throughout the
country, that they offer to give them the opportunity to
voluntarily exercise political expression.
I think this is without a doubt a foundation of our
system of government.
QUESTION:

And you could —
You seem to place some emphasis, and I'm

not sure in what respect, on people wearing buttons saying,
"I'm for" this man or that man.
MR. BUCKINGHAM*
QUESTION*

Oh, yes, sir.

Now, you think that is First Amendment

rights which the Legislature cannot prohibit.
MR. BUCKINGHAM:

I think the printing on a button

is an expression of political opinion.

I would say that's

22
more closely akin to a private expression of political
opinion as opposed to being an act that should be curtailed.
The State Personnel Board has enacted a particular provision
interpreting the prohibition section of the Oklahoma Merit
Act, where they say that is partisan political activity.
Bumper stickers, partisan political activity.
QUESTION:

Well, let's just take that in the office

now, wearing a button, "I'm for Governor Jones for re-election"
or whatnot, or I'm for the other man,
MR. BUCKINGHAM:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

You say a Legislature is constitutionally

barred from saying that that kind of display during working
hours in the office has a tendency to provoke disputes and
arguments and divisiveness and disputation among the employees,
to the disparagement of their work and their duties; you say
the Legislature cannot do that?
MR. BUCKINGHAM:

If they can show that there is a

compelling need to do that, if there is some legitimate —
QUESTION:

Now, I've stated —

MR. BUCKINGHAM:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

I've stated all we need.

Now, do you

say that need, as I’ve outlined it, is not a legitimate
State interest?
MR. BUCKINGHAM: Well, I think it possibly could be,
under your hypothetical, where you said "during office hours".

23
But, you see, the prohibitions included in the
Oklahoma statutes are not restricted to "during office hours".
QUESTION? But they might be construed that way by
the State courts in a particular case, might they not?
MR, BUCKINGHAM: Well, they haven't been construed
by the only other —
QUESTION ?

Or —

1®. BUCKINGHAM:

— which is the State Personnel

Board, which is an adopted rule.

They have put such a

restriction
QUESTION: But you concede that it would be a valid
exercise of judicial power for the courts of Oklahoma to say,
that's valid as a limitation during office hctir

and in the

building where you work, but it is invalid outside of office
hours and outside of the building?
MR. BUCKINGHAM:

If they determine that there was

actually something that divisive about it, Your Honor, —
QUESTION: Well, I thought you conceded that during
office hours this would be divisive?
MR. BUCKINGHAM:

Well, it seems, Your Honor,

correctly or incorrectly, that taking your presentment, that
that determination, that it was divisive, no, I personally do
not find that that is divisive,
QUESTION:

But do you think — in your view of it,

do you think a Legislature is constitutionally barred from

24
thinking that it is divisive and legislating on that assumption?
MR. BUCKINGHAM:

My personal opinion, insofar as

the provision in our case, is, sir, that that is going too far.
I think that —
QUESTION: Even during office hours?
MR, BUCKINGHAM: Even during office hours.

I think

the fact that you have a car sitting out on your parking lot,
with a bumper sticker on it, that "I'm for X", and they said
well, that car is sitting out in that parking lot with that
bumper sticker on it, that's so divisive that we're going to
prohibit that.

That does not — I think the expression of the

curtailment of that activity is going too far.
QUESTION:

Do you think a Federal Court has the

power, has the duty constitutionally to say that the Legislature
of Oklahoma can't think otherwise?
MR. BUCKINGHAM:

That's all right.

I think the

Federal Court has a duty of looking at what the State
Legislatures are trying to accomplish and at the same time
weighing those rights against the First Amendment rights,
which this Court has so jealously protected, and saying there
are going to be times, and there are going to be situations
where we should establish guidelines of what should be
permissible and should not be permissible insofar as the
impairment of those rights.
And that's where I think we are here.

25
In conclusion, appellants pray this Court reverse
the judgment of the trial court, with instructions to enter
an order enjoining appellees from proceeding further in the
dismissal action against the named appellants.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Very well,
Mr. Martin.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL DENNIS MARTIN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR, MARTIN:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
In 1947 this Court upheld the Mitchell case, and a
companion case, Oklahoma vs. Civil Service Commission? you
applied the Federal Hatch Act prohibitions to State employees
that are federally funded.
The Oklahoma Legislature, in 1959, in enacting the
Oklahoma Merit System Act of Personnel Administration, in~
corporated in that Act political activity prohibitions against
classified employees of the Merit System.
This Act is modeled after the Federal Hatch Act,
In fact, the Act provides in one of the sections that the
State Personnel Board is required and directed to alter any
rules or regulations it has that conflict with standards or
conditions of federal grants, recognizing that the federally
funded employees that work for the State are subject to the
prohibitions of the Federal Hatch Act,

26

There are some differences between the Federal
Hatch Act and our State's political activity prohibition.
Basically it's a matter of degree.
I believe that the State took the prophylactic
approach that was upheld in Mitchell as a method for proscribing
political activity on behalf of State employees,
In doing so, they did not incorporate by reference
any case decisions, as there were none in Oklahoma.

They did,

however, provide that the Personnel Board could, by rule,
enact rules and regulations to carry out the effect and
purposes of the Act,
The State Personnel Board has done so, and they
continue to enact rules and regulations regarding not only the
entire Merit System but the political activity prohibitions.
In addition, the language, the facial language of
Section 818, has some differences which are not contained in
the current Federal Hatch Act.

There are references to

"privately expressing his opinion and casting his vote", which
I believe has been raised by ray brother counselor.
We would urge that —
QUESTIONs

I would agree it’s difficult to define

"private expression"; how do you do that?

You tell yourself?

MR. MARTIN; Well, Your Honor, I might first state
that this prohibition is related only to an employee who is
taking part in the "management or affairs of a political party

27
or political campaign”, that it is not restricted to his
voicing his opinion on matters of public personality or
affairs.
QUESTION :

Well, the only explanation I'm asking for

is ray ’'private expression of my opinion"? what does that mean?
MR. MARTIN: This is not defined in the Act, there
has been no —
QUESTION: What do you think it means?
MR. MARTIN: What do I think it means?
That's a good question, Your Honor.

I could not

answer that.
QUESTION: Well, doesn't it mean that if he's at a
party with his friends at home, he can express it, and if
he's out on a platform he can't?
What's so difficult about that?
MR. MARTIN: Well, I think it's a matter of degree,
because you can —
?

QUESTION:
MR. MARTIN:

Well, isn't Bell Hunter a degree?
Yes, that is, Your Honor.

But I don't

believe that is —
QUESTION:

It would depend on the size of the party,

wouldn't it?
MR. MARTIN;
my point.

This is true, Mr. Justice,

This is

You can certainly view a fact situation where it

would be a private expression, but I think you could certainly

28
find one where it would be a borderline case.
QUESTION: This legislation was enacted in 1959, wasn't
it?
MR. MARTIN:

Yes.

QUESTION: And before that time was there any similar
legislation in your State?
MR. MARTIN:

No, there was none.

QUESTION: And this legislation came along at the
same time as the creation of a classified service came along?
MR. MARTIN:
QUESTION:

Yes, it did.
Prior to that time had there been any

category of public employment in your State that was
equivalent to Federal Civil Service?
MR. MARTIN:
QUESTION:
MR. MARTIN:
QUESTION:
MR. MARTIN:
QUESTION:

No —
Non-political?
No, there was not,
So it all came along together in 1959.
Yes, it did.
And none of it, really, has been —

that is the meaning of these two paragraphs we have before
us here, these have never been the subject of construction or
interpretation by the courts in the State, have they?
MR, MARTIN:

No, the only authorative interpretation

that has been made has been made in regard to Attorney
General's opinions that have been issued over the years.

29

And there have been a number of those.
QUESTION:

Has he ever purported to explain what

was meant by "private expression of opinion"?
MR. I1ARTIN:

No, that question has not been asked.

I might add that the State Attorney General's opinions have
force and effect as law until overturned by a court of
competent jurisdiction; and State employees and State agencies
are required to adhere to those opinions.
QUESTION:

Who can request an Attorney General's

opinion?
MR. MARTIN:

The Attorney General's opinion can be

requested itself by — it's usually requested by the State
Legislature, an agency head; cannot be requested by a private
citizen.
QUESTION:
MR, MARTIN:
QUESTION:

Gan not be?
No.
By an agency head; by the Legislature

as a whole or can any member —
MR. MARTIN:
QUESTION:
MR, MARTIN:
QUESTION:

Member.
— of the Legislature?
Any member of the Legislature.
Is there any practice in your State, as

there was in Arizona, where I came from, where a private
citizen wanted an Attorney General's opinion, he would ask
his Legislator who would in turn ask the Attorney General?

30

MR. MARTIN:

Yes, it's done quite often.

I think what the issues —
QUESTION:

You mean no one really cares what that —

at least nobody has asked, is that it?
MR. MARTIN:

No one has asked.

We cannot, on our

own, issue Attorney General's opinions, we have to be asked
questions, and this question has not been asked.
QUESTION:

I gather from what you said earlier,

you're not unhappy it hasn't been asked.
MR. MARTIN: Well, I would hate to have to write it,
Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Well, you don't object to the subject

that the District Court ruled, in fact, except that —
MR, MARTIN:
QUESTION:

No, I do not object to that.
Do you think that that court opinion,

that that's a reasonable construction of the Act?
MR. MARTIN:
QUESTION:
MR. MARTIN:

Yes, I do.
Has the Oklahoma court ever decided it?
No, the Oklahoma court has never

construed either of these two paragraphs.
I believe what we have before the Bench today is an
issue of the prophylactic approach adopted by this political
activity prohibition set forth in Mitchell.

The alternatives

to setting up the prohibitions, in terms of the vagueness
test, would amount to setting out all types of conduct that

31
could possibly be prohibited* a task which would seemingly be
impossible.
The prophylactic approach of Mitchell is the current
approach that the State has used, and is currently adopted.
Another approach would be perhaps to narrow the
language of the statute and set out specific prohibitions
that would not be as broad a prophylactic.
QUESTION:

Is the record clear as to what the

gentleman was' accused of, knowing how he was accused of
violating the Act?
MR. MARTIN:

Yes, it is, Mr. Justice.

In the original record, it contains charges by
letter, certified letter to each individual, specifying with
particularity what conduct he was accused of violating,
in terms of the political activity statute.
Each individual was charged alternatively with
soliciting campaign funds, receiving campaign funds, attempting
to secure other classified employees to work in the campaign,
and I believe there is one charge of hauling campaign
materials.
QUESTION:

That was for the re-election of an

incumbent Commissioner, wasn't it* Commissioner Jones?
MR. MARTIN:

Yes, it was, Mr. Justice.

QUESTION: Was he elected?
MR. MARTIN:

Yes, he was

32
I might add that the question of exhaustion of
administrative remedies, that the Personnel Board issued a
stay of their proceedings pending a determination of the
constitutionality of these prohibitions in the Federal Courts.
They were —
QUESTION: Couldn’t that be a State court decision,
under that stay?
MR. MARTIN:

Well, a stay was issued after a

complaint had been filed in the Federal Court.
QUESTION:

Well, does Oklahoma have a declaratory

judgment proceeding?
MR. MARTIN:

Yes, they do, Your Honor.

QUESTION: Would there be any way any of these
affected people could go directly into the Oklahoma courts
without having first to go through all of the administrative
proceedings?
MR. MARTIN:

I believe it’s possible, that they could

have gone into Federal Court.
QUESTION:
MR. MARTIN:

No, State court.
State court, and challenged the validity

of the statute.
QUESTION: Without waiting the outcome of the
administrative proceedings?
MR, MARTIN:

I think the Personnel Board would have

issued a stay in that event, also.

33

QUESTION: Well, was there a — in the administrative
proceedings that were pending, was there provision for an
answer from the party?

Wtere the issues made up?

MR. MARTIN: At the time the —
QUESTION:

Were there questions of coverage or

violations that were going to be involved, or —
MR. MARTIN: Well, there were specific charges that
were made.

At the time the stay was granted, there were a

number of motions pending before the Board in relation to those
charges by the attorneys representing them.

We had not

progressed to the point of having a hearing, or even starting
to have a hearing.

We were still in the discovery stage,

when the complaint was filed in Federal District Court.
QUESTION: The disposition by the Commission, is that
done immediately subject to judicial review or is there some
administrative appeal?
MR. MARTIN:

In regard to the administrative hearing,

there is a ten-day provision for a request for rehearing, and
the party then has thirty days in which to appeal to State
court.
QUESTION:
MR. MARTIN:
QUESTION:

To the State court.
On the record.
Does something — is he suspended, or

does the court have power to stay his suspension, or does the
law say nothing will happen to him until he’s completed the —

34
MR. MARTINs Both the Board and the Court has the
power to stay any order of the agency.
QUESTION:

And what does it do?

Go into an

Oklahoma trial court or into an Oklahoma appellate court?
MR. MARTIN?
QUESTION:

It goes into an Oklahoma trial court.
And then where is it — is there an

intermediate appellate court before you get to the supreme
court?
MR. MARTIN:
QUESTION:

Yes, there is.
Is it de novo in the trial court, or is

it on the record?
MR. MARTIN:
QUESTION:
MR. MARTIN:

It's on the record.
What's the standard they use?
Substantial evidence.

QUESTION: Could this Commissioner who benefitted by
the work presumably of these people have asked the Attorney
General for an opinion about these matters?
Is he one of the State officers who has that power?
MR. MARTIN:

Yes, he could have asked for an opinion.

I believe that the vagueness test, as set out in
Grayned vs. City of Rockford, is controlling in our case.

The

notice that the State employees had in regard to the prohibitions
is given not only by the facial language of the statute itself,
but also from rules and regulations set forth by the Personnel
Board, circulars that are issued by the Personnel Board to each

35
employee proscribing and setting forth what activities he can
be involved in and what activities he cannot be involved in.
In addition, there are Attorney General's opinions
which, as I indicated earlier, have force and effect of law,
and which employees and agencies are required to follow.
These opinions have alternatively, down through the years,
interpreted the prohibition to be prohibitions against partisan
activity.
The standards which the Personnel Board has to
enforce this political activity prohibition is sufficient to
meet the test in Grayned.

They themselves have set forth

rules, and they also guide themselves by the Federal Hatch
Act prohibitions, through the Oklahoma vs. Civil Service
Commission case, and a provision in the statute itself which
requires them to alter any rules or regulations which conflict
with those standards that apply to federal grants.
So they, themselves, adhere to standards which they
set themselves, and which are set through the Federal Hatch
Act.
The employees themselves have access to advisory
opinions from the Personnel Board, which is indicated to them
in a circular that is distributed.

They have access to the

rules and regulations of the Board which further define the
prohibitions set out in the statute.
And, under certain conditions, they can ask for

36
Attorney General's opinions if they get someone to ask it
who has authority to.
The broadness test, overbreadth test, that's
applied to this case, in particular in relation to the
language of the statute itself, appellants contend that it
prohibits constitutionally protected speech,as well as non­
protected.
The three-judge panel correctly held that the
prohibitions were against partisan political activities, and
were not overbroad.

While the specific language itself does

not, with perhaps as much certainty as appellants would like,
connotate that it is only partisan political activity that is
prohibited, the particular wording of the statute gives that
connotation.
In addition, the Attorney General ruled in 1968, in
an Attorney General's opinion, that those prohibitions were
against partisan political activity only.

The enforcement of

those provisions by the Personnel Board and the circulars that
they issued to State employees also specified that they are
partisan political activity prohibitions.
QUESTION: Well now, what does that mean?
We were told earlier that in these election races
for the job of Commissioner, sometimes independents run; and
if employees work for that independent candidate, would that
be partisan political activity, or wouldn't it?

37

MR. MARTIN; Well, I don’t believe —
QUESTION;
MR. MARTIN;

It wouldn’t be on behalf of a party.
I don’t believe we've had an independent

run — yes, we have; I take that back.
QUESTION;
MR, MARTIN;

We have had,

We were told that some have.
Yes, in the last race.

I think that if an independent is running as an
independent and has, through his resources, a — I won't
say party, but a —
QUESTION*
MR. MARTIN:

Organization.
— an organization that espouses his

particular beliefs, that *—
QUESTION;
MR, MARTIN*

That leads his candidacy.
Yes,

Someone working for that

organization would be very similar to working for a party,
that they are attempting to espouse to others the beliefs of
that individual through his organization and his platforms,
QUESTION*

Of course, it's reasonable to assume that

the Democratic candidate and the Republican candidate would
consider that partisan political activity, since its aims are
against them?
MR. MARTIN*

Yes, I would think so.

I would think

that the definition of party politics is broadly that which
is aimed at instigating in State government a particular belief
or espousing a particular platform.

We currently have the

38

two-party system, but there are independents and other
parties, such as the American Party, which are parties because
they espouse a particular belief or attempt to set forth
particular policies in State government, which are unique
unto themselves.
So I think in that regard it would be a prohibition
against someone working for an independent candidate, if he
had such an organization.
QUESTION:

The Attorney General's rulings in your

State, don't they —
MR. MARTINS

Yes.

QUESTION:

Are these published rules available?

MR. MARTIN:

Yes, they are.

QUESTION:

They are published —

Prom the reading, I think it is.

MR. MARTIN: They are published and distributed to all
agencies.
QUESTION:

Well, are there any Attorney General's

opinions in this case?
MR. MARTIN:

Yes, there are.

There is the '68

opinion, which interpreted the political activity prohibitions
and held that they were partisan political activities.
There have also been other opinions down through the years —
QUESTION:
MR, MARTIN;
QUESTION;

Have you got some other citations —
Other citations?
Yes.

39

MR. MARTIN;

I have a listing of some of the opinions

and what they dealt with.
QUESTION;
MR. MARTIN:

Are they in your brief?
No, they aren't, Your Honor.

QUESTION: Well, are they available in some way?
MR. MARTIN:

Yes, we can make them available.

As an addendum to the record.
QUESTION:

Well, are they

they're published,

they're not just part of —
MR. MARTIN:

No, they're published.

They’re issued, they're issued to the individual
requesting the opinion, and they are also sent to State
agencies to distribute and to inform the employees.
QUESTION:

You don't happen to know whether or not

they're in our library, do you?
MR. MARTIN:

I don't believe we — we are now

they were put in a bound volume.

I believe that just occurred

several years ago#
They did start in '68; excuse me.

Yes, we do have

I don't know if you have access to it in

QUESTION; Would you, with the Chief Justice's
permission, make available copies of the Attorney General's
opinion, opinions that do bear on the construction of these —

40

MR. MARTINs

Yes.

Yes.

There are three that are in the record, but they are
not inclusive of all that were issued.
more that were issued.

There are a number of

Now, I will make available as part of

the record those opinions.
Of the State's 22,000 employees, approximately 20,000
are under the Merit System as classified employees.

The

prohibitions specifically apply only to classified employees.
They do apply to unclassified employees to the extent that
unclassified employees cannot attempt to solicit funds from
classified employees or get them involved in partisan
politics.
The distinction for the prohibitions are related
to the enactment of the Merit System of Personnel Administra­
tion.

When the Personnel Act was put into effect in 1959,

these prohibitions were placed in there and applied only to
classified employees.
The rationale of the Merit System is to allow the
employee

to progress in his work, free from outside influence,

including politics.
The decision to exempt certain agencies and
employees from the classified system was based primarily on
the decision that the populace needs some State individuals
to express their will.

In addition, the unclassified employees

are not protected by the Merit System nor subject to the whims

41
and caprices of their employer, so to speak. They have no
recourse in the event that they are terminated, as do the
classified employees.
Not only are specific individuals exempted from the
Merit System classification, but agencies as a whole are also
exempted.
While the decision of the Legislature to allow the
populace to express their will through certain individuals
was expressed in the Act, they also felt that it was necessary
for entire agencies, because of the nature of their work, to
also be exempted.

And in this regard the application of the

prohibitions is limitedly applied to them.
We think this is a valid distinction, that under the
prophylactic approach of Mitchell the decision to include
some State employees under the prohibitions and exclude
others is a judgment that has to be weighed by the State in
its experience over the years of the political activity that
they1re attempting to prohibit.
The Governor in the State of Oklahoma can, by
Executive Order, place new agencies under the Merit System or
existing agencies that are not under the Merit System.
So there is the flexibility, as time goes by, for the State
to continue to combat the evils of partisan politics by
placing those unclassified employees and agencies under the
prohibitions.

42
QUESTIONs

Does the Governor have unrestricted

power at any time to place any or all categories of State
employees under the system?
MR. MARTIN:

He’s given authority by the Personnel

Act to place agencies —
QUESTIONi Agencies.
MR. MARTINs

— under the Merit System.

And that

authority does not exceed the exemptions that are already
placed in the statute itself.
There are certain statutory exemptions, but as far
as newly created agencies, he has the authority to place them
under the Merit System by Executive Order,
QUESTIONS
MR. MARTIN s
QUESTIONS

To do so or not to do so?
Yes.
You say that the reason for banning

political activities by the classified employees is to
insulate the employee from political pressure; is that the
aim of it, or —
MR. MARTINs I think that*s one of the reasons.
The obvious reason for the enactment of the Merit System is
to insulate him from outside influence, including politics.
QUESTION;
MR, MARTINs

Yes.
I think the prohibitions applying

only to classified employees —
QUESTIONS

Well, but why apply it to anybody?

Why

43
prohibit political activity by any State employee?

What's

the purpose of that?
MR. MARTIN: Well, the State, unlike the Federal
Government, did not until 1959 make prohibitions against
political activities; and during this long period of years
since 1907, since we have become a State, it's been apparent
to the Legislature that the political activity control of
State employees was something which was not good for the
State.
QUESTION: So it was to insulate the employees from
political pressure?
MR. MARTIN:

It was to insulate the employees and

to prohibit a party from controlling the State and making its
desires and wishes that of the State, instead of having a
neutral State government which was not controlled by a
party.
QUESTION; And once an employee becomes a classified
employee, he gets certain job protections —
MR. MARTIN:
QUESTION;
MR. MARTIN:

Yes, he does.
— does he not?

And what are they?

He is in a retirement system; he is

not subject to dismissal except for cause, set out in the
statute; if he is dismissed he has a hearing before the
Personnel Board.

And there are specific prohibitions against

using influence against him, either discriminatory or favorable,

44
to effect his promotion or his non-promotion.
QUESTION:
MR. MARTIN:
QUESTION:

Non-promotion, yes.
So there are basic —
So he gets basically tenure, and can be

discharged only for cause —
MR. MARTIN: That's right.
QUESTION:

— and he gets to participate in a retire­

ment system and so on, that the other employees, who are
employees at will, I guess —
MR. MARTIN:

The employees at will, non-classified

employees also have access to retirement system; but they have
no tenure in terms of their dismissal.
QUESTION:

On job security.

MR. MARTIN: That's true.
QUESTION:

Can an employee say, I'm sorry, I don't

want to be a classified employee?
He has no choice, the individual employee, does he?
MR. MARTIN:

He hats a choice in terms of where he

applies to work.
QUESTION:
MR. MARTIN:
QUESTION:

Yes,

But only that.

Yes,
Mr. Martin, I understand it's agreed

that the Personnel Board has the authority to promulgate
regulations —
MR. MARTIN:

Yes, they do.

45

QUESTION:

— and in the Appendix you have, as I

read it, only one regulation, that's 1641, that deals with
the substance of the issue here today.

Does this mean that

counsel are in agreement that no other regulation is relevant
to this case?
ME. MARTIN:

No, I don't believe so, Mr. Justice.

Specifically, at the three»judge panel level, it was brought
out that this constitutional attack included only the
statutory language, that the rules enacted by the Board were
not included in this attack.

And on that point, since we're

dealing with the facial invalidation problem, the rules that
have been enacted by the Board in regard to this area were
not looked at or included in terms of the record.
QUESTION:
MR. MARTIN:

Are they published and available generally?
Yes, they are.

There is a publication

of the, of all the rules of the Board, which are issued to
all the agencies and employees.
QUESTION*

Well, aren't the rules some evidence of

what the Act means?
MR. MARTIN:

Yes, they are.

QUESTION: Well, how could you deal very sensibly
with constitutionality without knowing what the Act means,
and looking at the evidence about what it means?
MR. MARTIN: Well, the Personnel Board, even though
they have supported the national rules and regulations in

46
further defining the prohibitions in the Section 818, they
have not extensively done so.

The Act has only been in

effect 14 years, —
QUESTION:

Well, they've had to pass on it, you’d

think they would be relevant.

The adjudication is on

cons titution ality.
MR. MARTIN: We can make those available to the Court,
if they desire to look at it.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: That might be useful;
would you do that?
MR. MARTIN:
QUESTION:

Yes, I will.
Well, the three-judge court didn't have

access to that, did they?
MR, MARTIN: They had access to the one that was in
the record.

But they did not have access to all of them,

since the plaintiffs, appellants here, particularly noted
that they were not contesting those rules or regulations, just
the prohibitions.
In conclusion, I'd like to point out to the Court
that Oklahoma has taken the prophylactic approach of Mitchell.
And we feel that this is the only practical way of combatting
the evil that is sought to be prohibited.

An all-inclusive

approach of setting out all the conduct that is to be pro­
hibited by statute is impossible; a narrowing construction of
the statute would not have the effect of combatting the evils

47
that are sought to be prohibited.
Now, if the prophylactic approach of Mitchell is
valid, whether it's based upon a rational test, vagueness
test, or the compelling governmental interest test with the
least alternative restrictive test.

And we feel that the

Court should sustain the lower court's holding that said
prohibitions are constitutional.
Mil. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.

Mr. Buckingham, I have a question or two if you
have a moment longer.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN C, BUCKINGHAM, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. BUCKINGHAM?
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

I suppose it can be assumed, or at least

let's assume it anyway, that although there were some employees
who assisted this Commissioner, under whose general juris­
diction they worked, there were these people who helped him
get re-elected, there may have been others who did not help
him get re-elected; that's a reasonable assumption, isn't it?
MR. BUCKINGHAM:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, it is.

Is it a reasonable assumption for the

Legislature to think that they want to protect employees from
being urged by the Commissioner to engage in political
activity?
MR. BUCKINGHAM:

Very reasonable. Very reasonable,

Your Honor.
QUESTION:

And perhaps those who are requested and

declined might not be so favored if the Commissioner got
re-elected.
fact.

It's a possibility; I'm not suggesting it is a

It's merely a possibility that the Legislature might

have taken into account, is that right?
MR. BUCKINGHAM:

Yes, sir.

I'll agree with you, yes.

QUESTION: So that that would tend to sustain the
Attorney General's view that the purposes were prophylactic,
or, to take Mr. Justice White's term, to insulate them from
this kind of an influence?
MR. BUCKINGHAM:

Yes.

We do not contest the

purpose and the aim and the object.
how it was accomplished.

What we're saying is,

What we're saying is that in the

particular statutes that are involved, they are too broad —
QUESTION:

Well, are you challenging it as applied

here to people who solicited money, received campaign
contributions, and distributed campaign material?
MR. BUCKINGHAM: What I'm saying, sir, that with
regard to the statute that is involved, itself, since the
jurisdiction of the court was aimed at the statute itself,
insofar as its overbreadth and vagueness were concerned,
QUESTION: Should anybody who is able to read have
had any doubt that this statute prohibited the kind of
activity involved in this particular case?

49

MR. BUCKINGIIAMs

Well, if we are to assume that

we're talking about subscriptions and receipt of money, then
I would say that you have to agree with them,
QUESTION:

That is what’s involved in this case?

MR. BUCKINGHAM:

Yes,

So far as the charges, I

believe, if the Court please, that these are charges that go
a long way, or insofar as having action on those charges,
these are the allegations that are named against the
employees.

Now, I don’t want the Court to feel that by

virtue of us arguing the case that we have at all admitted
at all there is —
QUESTION:

No, no.

We’re merely talking about

allegations, which you concede would be proper grounds for
a State to establish prohibitions, and that if they were
found guilty of them, they could properly be disciplined,
MR, BUCKINGHAM:

Yes, sir.

Most certainly. We

think that that type of conduct is what was obviously aimed
at, and what we’re trying to do, insofar as any kind of
proscription of these rights; but what we’re saying is,
let’s not take all the rights that they have away, with
regard to political expression.

The statute *— a statute

could be enacted and could be drafted, let’s say, from the
positive point of view, permitting them to engage in certain
partisan political activity on a voluntary basis, which would
give them an exercise of those rights guaranteed to them by

50

the First Amendment.
We're saying that under oux* statute they're not
granted these rights.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Thank you, gentlemen.
The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 3:04 o'clock, p.m., the case in
the above-entitled matter was submitted.}
