MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We 'will hear arguments

next in No. 7101315, Alexander against Virginia.
Mr. Dietz.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STANLEY M. DIETZ, ESQ..,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. DIETZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This is the Third Act in your trilogy of obscenity
cases but I am not going to follow the line urged by Mr.
Fleiehman and Mr. Brown — excuse me, Mr. Smith and that is
because, as I view the exhibits involved in my case and recall
the testimony that was produced by the Commonwealth and by
the Defendant, that our material did not Involve hard core
pornography which brings me to think about the Roth case
because the Roth case involved hard core pornography.

The

case certiorari was granted on the limited point of whether
hard core pornography was protected by the First. Amendment
and. you ruled that it; was not.
In the Roth case, as I understand it, the Post
t

Office Department submitted exhibits — examples of what
hard core pornography really was.
Q

Well, now, Mr. Diets, my recollection of

Roth was that the discussion was that the materials involved
were obscene, whether hard core or what was not suggested.

We didn't even have the exhibits here and the concession, 1
think, as it appears in the footnote of Roth is simply that
the materials here involved were obscene and that concession
was made to present the question of whether obscenity was
protected by the First Amendment and you keep talking about
hard core pornography.

I thought that was a phrase that

came in much later.
MR. DIETZ:
opinion for the Court.

Well, of course, your Honor wrote the
I was not involved in the case,

but I —
Q

I know, but you don't find the words, "hard

core pornography" anywhere in the opinion, do you?
MR. DIETZ:

Mo, sir.

No, sir but I understood —

I understood that there were exhibits submitted of hard
core pox*nogr-aphy.
Q

I know nothing about it.

We had no exhibits

here in that case.
MR. DIETZ;

Well, I 3tand corrected.

Actually, I felt that In this pornography field
it had really boiled down over the years to interpreting
the Roth case to mean hard core pornography.
Q

Well, I think that is a different argument.

MR. DIETZ:
ease of Riedel, you

Yes, sir.

Of course, in the very recent

the Court again stated that hard core

pornography or that obscenity was not constitutionally

5
protected but my argument is that the materials in this case —•
if you compare them with other materials which this Court
has had. under consideration in such matters as Wiener and
Dulan versus California which depict only simulated sexual
activity a simulated sexual activities which I would define as
possibly inches or possibly seconds away from the actual
c on summation,, but leaving to the imagination the actual
graphic depletions the actual passage of the scene and I
would urge this Court to draw the line at that line, at that
place, differentiating between simulated sexual activity
which should be constitutionally protected — if you have the
other elements involved ?!For Adults only” and without any
obtrusive advertising which is the school of law which has
mushroomed since the decision of this Court in Redrup versus
New York»
Now, in this ease that X have today, we have a
statute from the State of Virginia.

It is a civil statute

although it is part of the criminal code and it provides
for any person ~~ state’s attorney or Commonwealth or any —•
any person, any citizen to bring an action to deplore a
book to be obscene.

It specifically prohibits a Jury trial.

1 therefore say it is unconstitutional because in an obscenity
case I feel a Jury trial is mandated by the. First Amendment.
Q

What has the First Amendment' got to do with

jury trial, at least on its face?

6
MR» DIETZ:

Well, I recognise that the First

Amendment does not spell out the jury trial, but if you take
the Roth case definition of what is obscenity and what is
not constitutionally protected under the First Amendment,
then it must be decided by community standards.

The

community is the jury.
Q

You want not only a jury, but a jury of the

kind they had 500 years ago, then, where the jury brings its
own knowledge to decide rather than
MR. DIETZ:

No, sir, I would follow the guidance

of the late Justice Frankfurter in Smith verans California
where he said that it's a jury question that you will have
to introduce expert testimony around these points- of prurient
interests and community standards to guide the jury in their
deliberations.
Q

But that was a criminal case, wasn't it?

MR. DIETZ:

Smith versus California was, a criminal

•case.

I recognise the distinction.

And Roth was a criminal

case.

At the same time, this Court decided Kingsley Books

case, Kingsley Books versus Hew York — Regents of Mew York.
That case was a civil case and if did not raise this issue
of a jury trial because in that case a jury wets not
requested.

I believe that Justice Frankfurter wrote the

opinion for the Court and noted that an advisory jury was
available In New York, but none was requested.

7
But in my case, I had, right from the outset,
requested a jury trial but this state statute specifically
prohibits a jury determination»

And through my experience

in defending, representing this particular company we have
many, many instances where a jury looked at obscenity
exhibits differently than a judge alone»

You have pending

in this Court a petition for certiorari, another case that I
have, Village Books versus Marshall, where a judge viewed a
book and said that it was obscene, issued an Injunction
against it in the State of Maryland.

That same book was

tried before a jury -— three different juries in three
jurisdictions acquitted.

Of course, that was criminal cases

anci I recognise there is a different standard of proof
involved.
Well, 1 feel very strongly that First Amendment
ease, obscenity case, a jury trial should be allowed where
craved.
The second point that I claim this statute was
unconstitutional is that it specifically

provides for the

community standard to foe a city or a county.

It doesn’t

even limit the community standards in the way that the case
that Mr. Pleichman argued, to the State of California.
is not the State of Virginia.

It

It is evidence of community

standards In that city, in that county.

This is — of

course, it is very -easy for the state to say, "Well, how

8
else can we get experts?

There are no such things as an

expert on a national community standard."
faced with?

So* what are we

We are faced with a so-called "expert" who* as

we have in the record of this case* who has been part of a
group that studied obscenity a year and a half before in
that area and who had spoken with different people and those
civic groups which consisted of the Navy Wives’ Club and
who had not been in an "adult" bookstore in a year or more*
which I use the phrase "adult" bookstore.

It has been

referred to in the California case as "dirty" bookstores.
Well3 I take issue with that.
"Adult" bookstores are stores that only trade with
adults9 who do not allow juveniles entrance.

It is so

stipulated in our case* that we do not do business with
juveniles.
All the states* or nearly all the states* have
statutes.

The District of Columbia does.

The State of

Maryland does* where they differentiate a different penalty
Involved if you deal with juveniles in the obscenity field.
But that was not an issue.

They stipulated in our case* no.

j uveniles involved.
So that brings us back to the community of
Portsmouth and I might say, this is not a situation like they
had with Los Angeles, some 250 "adult" bookstores.

This

bookstore was the one and only bookstore in the City of

9
Portsmouth.

I don’t know the exact population,

it is around 70

-

75»000 people.

I think

But this is the only

bookstore, "adult” bookstore in that city.
Q

Do you think it makes a difference under the

First Amendment whether you have one or 250?
MR. DIETS:

No, sir,

I mentioned that because I

was discussing community standards and, earlier, I heard an
argument stated that are we to apply the community in some
small city in Montana as a standard as compared with the
entire State of California?
"adult" bookstores.
Tidewater Area,

California is covered with

There are not quite so many In the

There are approximately 10 that I am aware

of j) but only one in the City of Portsmouth.
MoWp on community standards, it might be argued
that the majority of the people In the community don’t go
into these bookstores and don’t make purchases from these
bookstores,

Tall, I would then argue to this Court that this

is quite true.

The majority of the people are not

customers in my client’s bookstore.

But the First Amendment

was not made or created to protect only the majority view
but I think, principally, the minority viewpoint, that is the
one where you have — under the First Amendment — the right
to get up and say, "I don’t agree with all of you people.
This Is my point of view.”

And that is what is being done

in this bookstore in the City of Portsmouth.

10
Now, if I might at this point refer to another
element of the issue of obscenity* we claim that the judge
in his opinion found that these books to be "patently
offensive."

"Patently offensive" to whom?

the customers who go into that bookstore.
forced in.

Certainly not to
They are not

We don51 have any sidewalks that pop them into

the store as they walk by and adult bookstores, and particu­
larly that bookstore in Portsmouth, have the windows
blacked out.

You cannot see inside and there are big signs,

"Adult Bookstores, Mo Minors Allowed," and if anyone comes
into the store who might be close to the age of majority, he
must demonstrate his credentials to prove that he is, in
f cts adult.
Now, the second point that I wanted, to claim as
far as the statute being unconstitutional Is that it affects
a prior restraint.

I won’t spend too much time oh this point

because they never, in fact, got the restraint off the
ground*

They — in this case — they went into the bookstore,

took a list of all of the books that had anything .to do with
*

sex, issued a subpoena duces tecum to managmerifc: of the store
i

to appear in court with a copy of the books.

■

'

-

The people appeared, the books were: taken following
•which the •— two of the judges reviewed the pocks and issued
}

a

show cause order and the Commonwealth Attorney filed a

petition asking that all of these books be declared obscene.

11
Now , at that time they also filed a. notice to the
two employees of the bookstore that — I think three or
four days later — that they were going to ask the court for
a temporary restraining order.

This is where we claim there

would have been a prior restraint.

It would have been

granted had not we gone Into federal court to ask for an
injunction and then the motion for a restraining order was
continued indefinitely, and we never did actually have a
hearing on the motion for a restraining order but this
restraining order would have been in effect but there was
absolutely no time limit as this Court has held constitu­
tionally mandated in affirmative statutes of

this nature.

There was no time limit other than the general boundary
that it should be heard as soon as possible, as 3oon as it
was expedient.
Aa it turned out in this case , the proceedings
started in May and the hearing was held in November.

The

decision did not come until December of the same year.
Now. in this Court's granting of certiorari on

.

this ease you added, as an issue, whether or not these
sexually-oriented materials are constitutionally protected.
Now, we feel this case to be the perfect vehicle
for the argument that — following Hedrup — that this
material is constitutionally protected, first of all because
it does not involve any material which could be considered

12
hard core pornography — and the definition of hard core
pornography, of course, we draw from the opinion of Justice
Stewart which I believe was actually the definition of the
United States Government in UVS. y. Glnsburg and in all the
law materials we do not have — we do not have that element
of graphic depiction of sexual activities.
The testimony that was produced by the state —
many of their witnesses said that this is not hard core
pornography.

One of them said it would only be obscene for

juveniles, for 19-years-oXders.

That was the gentleman who

was the part-time police officer and part-time printer who
testified as an expert for the State of Virginia.
I would like to reserve some time for ,rebuttal
if I may.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Mr. Kulp.--

Very well, Mr. Diets.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES E. KULP, ESQ.y;
OH BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. KULP:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

members of the Court:
At the outset in this case, it must be borne in
mind that the type procedure we are talking about involved in
this case is a

civil procedure in realm as opposed to a

criminal prosecution.

The procedures in Virginia under this

civil procedure provides for no criminal sanctions whatsoever.

13
It ia merely -an action against the books which are alleged
to be obscene.
Q

So there Is nothing about conduct in this

case?
MR. KULP:
Q

Mo» sir.

It is just suppression of books as books?

MR. KULP:

That is corrects sir.

This statute is,

of course, a creature of statute and it was unknown at
common law.

It has long been established that neither the

state nor the federal constitution, guarantees or preserves
a right to jury trial except In those cases where it
existed when the- constitutions were adopted.

The Fifth

and Sixth Amendments deal exclusively with criminal
proceedings and the Seventh Amendment, while dealing with
civil actions, pertains to suits at common law and where
value exceeds $20»
In Kingsley Books versus Brown the court upheld a
New York statute which is very similar to the statute
Involved in this case and a determination in. the Mew York
case was for a procedure without a jury and this Court held
that it was not for this Court to limit the state in
resorting to various weapons in the armory of* the law and they
could use the criminal, civil or some combination of these
two procedures.
Q

Mr. Kulp, let me ask you a question.

Suppose

14
a bookdealer had a thousand of a particular book that came
under* the ban of this statute In the view of the Commonwealth
and you proceeded against one of them and In the interim
proceedings against the book itself, would it be a violation
of the statute if this dealer gave the balance of the books
away for nothing instead of selling them?
MR. K.ULP:

No, sir, I donft believe so because

the statutes, as I recall and believe to be in Virginia is
that it is sale or some commercialism involved.

Now, where

there was a transfer of these, I don't believe that would
come under the statute in this case.
Q

Given away to minors?

MR. KULP:
that.

No, sir., I don't think you could do

There is a specific statute which would prohibit the
/„

G-.

giving of the articles to minors.
1

We might1 have to back up,

think that, probably, the criminal statute in Virginia

might even prohibit the giving of these books to another
person.
Now, the question about tie prior restraint, of
course, as this Court knows and the record shows, there was
no prior restraint In this case and as Mr. Diets says,
advised the court.
The one thing I would like to call to the Court's
attention is the fact that the record will show -- it is not
in the Appendix, but In the record, the trial record itself.

15
it will show that Mr. Dietz agreed to continue this case,
so this question of when the case started and when it ended
is not exactly the amount of time that is really for this
Court to consider in the prior restraint aspects because, as
this Court indicated, In Thirty-Seven Photographs, it said
that !5no seizure or forfeiture will he invalidated or delayed
where the Claimant is responsible for extending either the
administrative action or judicial determination beyond
allowable time limits.'* So I simply submit that in this case,
Mr. Diets did not press for any hearing in this matter and,
in fact, went in and requested a continuance.
Q

Mr. Kulp, when the state prevails in one cf

these proceedings, what happens, finally, to the books?
MR. KULP:

The books are permanently enjoined, as

they were in this case, from being sold.
Q

But the are not destroyed?

MR. KULP:
Q

But there is no destruction involved.

I see,

MR. KULP:

Now, as to the community standards, of

course, this statute sets a community standard being the
community wherein the —
Q

That is to say, the state doesn’t keep them?

MR. KULP:
Q

Mo, sir.

They return the books and the bookseller is

simply subject to an Injunction.

16
MR. KULP:

that Is correct and If* he violates it,

of course, could be subject to the contempt of court —
Q

While I have you Interrupted,there were -—what

339 different books involved In this?
MR. KULP:

Yes, sir.

They were all single copies

that were brought in.
Q

And these were hard-cover books or what?

MR. KULP:

Most of there soft-cover.

I don’t think

there were any hard-cover books.
Q

Paperbacks.

MR. KULP:

Yes, they were large — more; like —

they are really magazines, as opposed to little pocketbooks.
Q

Photographs?

MR» KULP:
Q

Photographs.

So this ends up as an injunction against some

kind of conduct, sale?
MR. KULP:
Q

Yes, sir, that’s —

Is that the only injunction?

MR. KULP:

Well, it Is against the books and it

says that —
Q

"They many not

MR. KULP:
Q

fee

sold”?

They may not fee sold, that, is correct.

Car. he leave it and start over again as a

library?
MR. KULP:

Well, 1 think that he might then subject

himself to a criminal penalty
Q

Of what?

MR. KULP:
Q

If the books were sold.

I didn’t say sell.

Just leave it open,

anybody wants to come in can read them.
MR. KULP:

I would say there is probably no

statute in Virginia which would prohibit that.
Q

You have described this all along as an

in.

rem

procedure, but of course, an injunction is not an

in

rem

procedure is it?
MR. KULP:

No, sir, it's actually — it Is an

injunctive procedure but it goes against the books as
opposed to a person.
Q

The procedure ~~

On the injunction, does the Injunction name

anybody?
MR. KULP:

Yes, sir, it names the people who are

the producers or the publishers of these books.
Q

It enjoins them, doesn’t it?

MR. KULP:

Yes, sir.

It enjoins them.from selling

these particular books which have been listed in —
Q

That’s a reversal,

Q

How do you get in rem out of that?

Hem is

a person. Isn’t It?
MR. KULP:

Yes,, sir, well. 1 think that the

procedure does allow for the — or calls for the injunction

for these persons not to sell these books which have been
judged to be obscene.
Q

Under Virginia procedure, if these books

were transferred to someone else who had no connection with
the people who were defending against the state in the first
action, could those people relitigate in some other court
the question of whether they were obscene because they
weren’t parties to the first action or would the books them­
selves be branded as obscene by virtue of the in rera
character?
MR* KULP:

Well, I think that probably they would

be able to litigate it in some other situation.
Q

Wouldn’t it be res judicata as to the book

itself, if it is an In rem action as to the first
MR. K'CJLP:

stage?

Well, I think it would be a decision

as to the effect that those books have been declared
obscene, but I don’t think that the injunction would only
apply to those people who were brought into court as parties
or who were served with notice.
Q

Is this an ancient statute?

MR. KULP:

No, sir, this is a

fairly recent — I

don’t know if I can — I don’t — it’s not within- the last
two or three years but I think it was in i960 if I am not
mistaken — somewhere along that time.

Q

We are talking about 18.1-236 that is on

19
page 19-A of the —
MR. KULP:

Yes, sir.

Q

: mt the order to show cause shall

be directed against the book by .name or description, then it
goes on to say, M— authorizing the court to issue a temporary
restraining order against the sale or distribution of the
book alleged to be obscene.”

Now, is that order also run

against the book so it makes anybody who sells it anywhere in
the jurisdiction of the court —
MR. KULP:
Q

I don't believe so, your Honor.

Well, isn't this on page 19-A, "The order of

the court below was, in accordance with its findings, that
the magazines listed are declared obscene and the said
Alexander, Collier, Village Books, Inc., Media Arts and
Guild Press, Limited are hereby .restrained from either the
sale or commercial disposition of the aforementioned
magazines,1’

That is the order before us, isn’t It?

MR. KULP:

Yes, sir.

In a notice on page 19-A that

the statute was — on 22-A — was enacted by chapter 233 of
the Acts of Assembly, i960.
Now, as to the community standards, the First
Amendment in clear language states that

Congress shall make

no law abridging the freedom of speech or press.

There is

no specific mention of the states in this amendment and the
freedom of speech has been made applicable to the states

20
through the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Therefores what the states may constitutionally do In this
area must be judged upon the language of the Fourteenth
Amendment and not upon the language of the First Amendment.
The question arises as to how would a national
standard be determined?

Would each locality have to have

Its own set of ’’experts” to go around the country in order
to ascertain what material Is acceptable?
would be required to be Interviewed?

How many people

Would they be

required to go into the rural areas as well as to the large
.met r op oil t an are as ?
If a national standard is required we would be
relegated to they type expert which the appellants present
In this case.

It appears that this Dr. Hammon» who was in

the Georgia case also appeared in this case.
We get experts from out of state who come into town
on the day of the trial and In this case the record shows
that they spent no more than 10 or 15 minutes thumbing
through not more than half of the books which were Involved
in this case and then making their opinions known to the
court and we compare this to what the state experts did on
the other hand.

These people were all local people.

had examined each book thoroughly.

They

They had knowledge of

what the customs were and what the community standards were
in Portsmouth, Virginia and» as former Chief Justice Warren

21

said In Jacob®llls^ he said he didn’t believe that there was
a provable national standard and that this Court had not been
able to enunciate one and it would be unreasonable to expect
the local courts to demand one.
As this Court said in Missouri versus lewis., the
Fourteenth Amendment does not profess to secure to all
persons in the United States the benefit of the
and the same remedies.

same laws

Great diversities in this respect

may exist in two states separated only by an imaginary line.
When we get to the question which- this Court asked
Counsel brief and argue, the answer to the question of
whether the display of any sexually-oriented pictorial
magazines for commercial sale, when surrounded by -notice
to the public of their nature and by reasonable protection
against exposure of the magazines to Juveniles — the answer,
I believe to this question, depends upon whether we are
■

••

talking about sexually-oriented pictorial magazines which are
obscene.
If the magazines are, in fact, obscene, then there
la no constitutional protection for the reasqn that in Roth
this Court held that obscenity was not within the area of
constitutionally-protected speech.

This question 'was clearly

answered, I believe, in the negative in United States versus
Reidel decided in May of last year.

In B-side 1 the Jurisdictional statement'was whether

22
the government could constitutionally prohibit the distri­
bution by the mails of obscene material to the willing
recipients who state that they are adults, to which question
this Court responded by holding that the government could
prohibit discrimination of obscene material through the
mails.
This Court expressly rejected the argument that
'.Stanley somehow limited Roth and that the state and federal
’governments were constitutionally limited to prohibiting
distribution of obscene materials to Juveniles and to
unconsenting adults.
Stanley recognized that the states retained broad
powers to regulate obscenity.
There is being espoused the proposition that since
the President’s Commission on Obscenity found no 'causal
relationship between pornography and antisocial conduct and
sex crimes, then the states have no interest In

protecting

consenting adults from pornography.
The position of the Commonwealth of Virginia is
that this argument completely "takes away from the states
the right to reject the findings and conclusions of the
President’s Commission.

The Commission’s report has been

rejected not only by the President and by the Senate, but it
has been criticised by scholars.
The Commission’s studies did not explore the

23
long-range effects of frequent exposure to the obscene.

At

the time the Commission was concluding that public opinion
did not support any legal restrictions on the right of adults
to read or vie-» explicit sexual materials the Gallup Opinion
Index found 80 percent of the adult population favoring
stricter laws on pornography and the Harris Poll at the same
time found 76 percent of the population want pornography
literature outlawed.,
The Commission also'reported that in Copenhagen the
rate of reported rape declined during the period in which
pornography has been widely available.

Therefore, the

Commission concluded that there was no causal connection
between sex crimes and pornography.

However, the Commission

completely dismissed the fact that in this country, adult
arrests for

forceful rapes increased 50 percent in the

last decade when the availability of erotic material also
increased,
The obscenity report published by Stein and Day
publishers In 1970 found evidence of a demonstrable
correlation between rising obscenity statistics .and rising
crime rates.

Within the last few weeks a British study

found that British society was threatened by the growth of
pornography.

Common sense does suggest that if good

literature can enoble its readers, foul literature can degrade
them and that to depersonalise said de roman t i e i ze sex may be

24
damaging and certainly cannot be helpful to the development
of happy human relationships.
The people who are presently saying that a book
does not corrupt are the very same ones who seem convinced
that displays of violence on television do indeed have the
power to corrupt.
The position of the Commonwealth is that in the
question or the area of obscenity, that this Court has
specifically held in Both and reiterated in Stanley and
reiterated once again in Re1del and Thlrty-Seyen Photographs
that obscenity is not protected by the First Amendment and
while it may be proven truly at soma time that certain
areas in this law should be changed, it is the position of
the Commonwealth that this matter rests in the hands of the
legislature and we would ask this Court to affirm the
Judgment,
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you,, Mr. Kulp.

Mr. Diets, do you have anything further?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STANLEY M. DIETZ, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. DIETZ:

If It please the Court, I should like

the opportunity to answer a few of the questions that the
Court posed to Mr. Kulp.

‘

Mr. Chief Justice Burger, I believe you•asked the
>

question regarding giving away of this material. ‘This statute

25
which appears on .19 ~ A deals only ~~ paragraph one — "Whenever
he has reasonable cause to believe that any person is
engaged in the sale or commercial distribution of any obscene
book3" et cetera»" any citizen or the attorney for the
commonwealth of any county," et cetera, "may bring it to
the attention of the court."
Now, that is particularly interesting because he
says "any citizen who has an interest" and then we get to the
issue of this injunction because if you will consider the
very final paragraph of the statute as It appears on 22-A

in the petition for certiorari, paragraph 13, and I quote,
"It is expressly provided that the

petition and proceeding

authorised under this article relating to books alleged to
be obscene shall be intended only to establish scienter in
cases where the establishment of such scienter is thought to
be useful or desirable by the petitioner."
"Only to establish scienter."

I cannot visualize

how any common citizen who might be offended by the sale of
a book would be concerned about scienter.
Q

Well, what does that mean?

What do you suppose

that subparagraph 13 means?
MR. DIETZ:

I believe that they intended it to sort

of open the door for them to use this in a criminal proscecution.

I argued in the Supreme Court of Appeals of

Virginia that this statute was vague and unconstitutional.

26
It contains no provision for granting an
injunction, no provision for injunction.

It only contains

a provision for a temporary restraining order an-d that is
paragraph 5 and it does have as its avowed purpose only to
prove or establish scienter whenever it might be considered
important to the petitioner.

And of course, in this case

the lower court —- and in this brief I argued that the judge
overstepped his bounds in even granting this permanent
injunction and he never granted a temporary restraining order,
Q

Well, is the temporary restraining order

procedurally under this statute directed at the period
between the selsure of the book and the determination of its
quality?
MR. DIETZ:

I would have to assume so,-

It does not

say "states” but it does say that this can be granted upon
four days' notice after the filing of the original show cause
order.

Now, the show cause order has to be advertised in a

newspaper for three weeks following which the respondents or
any interested party has a right to come in and defend.
As it occurred in this case, because this was a
bookstore that had counsel, I immediately came into the case.
As a matter of fact, we had a counsel even at the time that
they served the subpoena duces tecum and when we produced the
books in the court.

Q

Well, was the temporary restraining order in

27
effect on the date of the seizure and the date of the hearing?
MR. DIETZ:

It was never -- it was never issued.

The motion was never granted.

I might clarify this.

says that I agreed to a continuance.

Mr. Kulp

Actually, I believe

that if you read the record carefully, I appeared in court on
the day that the temporary restraining order was to have
been heard and first I asked them for a stay, which was
denied and the I asked them to just continue it indefinitely,
which was granted because —• and that was not for trial, that
was only the temporary restraining order feature — because I
had filed an action in the United States District Court
asking for an injunction to prohibit any further proceedings
in the Court of Hustings.
Q

So that is what stopped it.

Well, what — excuse me.

Sorry, I didn't

mean to interrupt.
MR. DIETZ:

Well, that is what stopped'the court

from issuing the temporary restraining order.
Q

But under this statute, all that

Is ultimately

secured if there is a finding that the book is obscene is a
kind of a kind of a declaratory judgment, is that it?

That's

the way it looks to me.
MR. DIETZ:
judgment.

Well,

I wouldn’t say declaratory

Well, all right, a declaratory judgment but it

says that it is only to be used to establish scienter when
everybody should have equal views for it, so I would assume

23

that if they went ahead and sold, these books while a
temporary restraining order was in effect —
Q

Or after such judgment*

MR * DIETZ:

Or after judgment, then they could, come

into court arid get around the — what this Court said they
must prove in Smith versus California

i

ir as scienter or

knowledge of the obscene nature of the material by a book­
seller.
Q

But there is ho —- ultimately there is no —

this statute itself doesn’t impose any restraint, ultimately
on the sale.

It is just a judgment.

The court, shall order

the clerk of court to enter judgment that the book is obscene.
MR. DIETZ:
Q

Yes, sir.

That is the end of it.

MR. DIETZ:

That is according to the statute, but

as it is applied and I had the entire order printed in the
petition for certiorari on page 19-A, the judge did issue a
permanent injunction against my client and restrained him
from either the sale or commercial distribution of all of
the magazines.

And all of the magazines, that is an

interesting point because — and I argued to the courts below
that some of these magazines had been considered by this
Court in different cases but he still enjoined those as
well, even though this

Court has applied constitutional

protection to these magazines.

29

Q

To the specific issues or just to the same

magazine on some other issue?
MR. DIETZ:

As it so happened, this was the same

magazine — I am not sure of the specific issue, but —
Q

Well, that isn’t the whole story.-

MR. DIETS:

— if you look at the magazine

involved, you just compare it as the magazines were girlie
magazines and the only thing that changes is the face of
the girl.

The position, everything else is the same.
Q

And then the Supreme Court of your state

affirmed that permanent Injunction?
MR. DIETZ:

The Supreme Court of Virginia affirmed

the entire proceedings in the court below, and X argued this
point in the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia.
Q

And they said, didn’t they, that where some­

thing was found to be obscene, it was perfectly proper to
enjoin it?
MR. DIETZ:
Q

I don't —

Or words to that effect, at any rate.

MR. DIETS:

Well, the general effect.was they

sustained the lower court
Q

so they sustained the injunction.

Yes, but they did pass — they did say where

something Is found to be obscene under Virginia law it is
proper to enjoin it,
MR. DIETS:

I believe that is the

general effect,

30
Justice

Rehnquist, but — well., I’ll say no more on that.

That is what they did.

I do not believe that they acted

within their jurisdiction in doing that any more than
Judge Bain acted within his jurisdiction under this statute
in issuing the injunction.
This., as was argued by Mr. Kulps this is a creature
of statute only.

There is no common law right to declare

the book obscene, nonmailable.

It is only by statute.

And

this judge exceeded what the legislature intended that he
had the power to do in his authorisation.
I argue that this statute In unconstitutionally
vague.

I have that in my brief and that is the prime reason

and I believe my time has expired.

Unless there are any other

questions by any member of the Court, I will submit.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Diets.

Mr. Kulps your argument is submitted, but if there
is any Virginia statute which authorises a permanent
injunction, it has escaped our attention in the briefs and
you may coll our attention to it if there is such, sending a
copy, of course, to your friend.
I am suggesting you submit additional argument of
merely citation, if any.
COMMENT BY JAMES E. KULP, ESQ.
MR. KULP:
right now.

I believe I might be able to answer that

To my knowledge there Is no statute which

31
authorises the permanent injunction which the court declared
in this case but the Supreme Court of Virginia in its
<2ecision3 which is shown on. page 2-A of the petition for
writ of certiorarifl held that if the material is adjudged to
be obscene, then it is perfectly proper to restrain its
sale or distribution.

So this is the statutory construction

put on it by the Supreme Court of Virginia.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Very well, thank you.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 2:21 o'clock p.m., the case i*as
submitted.)
