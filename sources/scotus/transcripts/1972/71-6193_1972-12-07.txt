CHIEF JUS'.l:ICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments next

in 71··6193, Broun against the United States,

Mr. Lundy.
ORAL ARGUNENT OF LOWELL W. LUNDY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. LillIDY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and ll'.ay it please

the Court:

This case, I think, factually, if I may state it
briefly, presents a simple question of fact in that the crime
charged in this case involved a situation where tno men 1,,ere
arrested in Cincf.nnatl, Ohio, t·iith some alleged stolen goods
'1-lhich was to be shipped in interstate collllllerce, taken across
the Ohio River into Kentucky.
The next day, in Manchester, Kentucky, a city
police judge in Nanchestcr issued a search warrant for State
and local officers to go into a store which belonged to

Mr. Knuckles and search for stolen property,
The search 11arrant uas si8ned in blank by the judge.
The affidavit m:is signed tn blank by the judge, and the
District Court held tbat the search t•iarrant was not t~orth the
paper that it was ~,ritten on, and he quashed the soarch
warrant.
However, the officers, I think, being unauarc of
that, or uhethcr they uerc unaware of it or not, they went

4
ahead and searched for two days in this Ulan's store, and took
a large quantity of merchandise.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

It ~,as quite an under-

taking, oasn't it?
MR. LUNDY:

Two big truckloads.

It went on all

Saturday afternoon and all day Sunday.
The Court suppressed from motion all the evidence,
but only as to the ouner of the store.

The Cou:-:t held that

the Lvio men t'lho 11ere arrested in Cincinnati did not have
standing to suppress the evidence.
The case t:as tried, and, of course, all the evidence
that uas seized in the store t'las admitted in evidence against
the two men 11ho are petitioners in this case,

They t~ere

indicted.
Q

Hot·1

soon after the arrest -- they t,e::e arrested oith

the trucks and tiith a lot of this merchandise in their
po::rnession

hot'i soon after --

MR. LUNDY:
Q

I think it was the next day.

Hat. the rn:irrant obtained subsequent to the time

they arrested them in possession of the ,:,oods?
MR. LUIIDY:

Yes, Your Honor.

After the goods were

gotten :tn Cincinnati, 1'iord uas gotten do11n to Hanchester,
Kentucky, and one of tnJ:? employees of the store-• or the
merchandising company from ohich the goods were taken•• he
came to M..'lnchester t:b.e next clay, as 1. underst~nd it, and he got

5

the warrant from the city judge.
Now, these u:en uere ind:Lcted, together t•iith Clinton
Knuckles who is not here, in the first count charging the,n u:i.th
a conspiracy to move these goods in interstate co=~rce.
They ~,er.e also charged, in the second count, of
simply transporting goods in interstate comui.erce.
The third count involved the other defendant who
is not here.
Now, the case uas appealed

to 6th Circul.t and the

6th Circuit held, among other things, that a harmless error
had been cowmitted because the rulings of this Court in Bruton
had been violated, and they upheld the District Court's ruling
that thcae men did not have standing to suppress this evidence.
No~i, factue}.ly, that's the case that ce are concerned
with here today.
Nou, if I mny, I t·iould like to address myself to the
question of these men's standing to suppress this evidence,
firr;t.
The Court u'tll, of cour.se, oe aware that they uere
indicted on a conspiracy charge.
Now, the goods that t•,ere seized in Kentucky to
prove the conspiracy could be used to prove the conspiracy
against these petitioners Sru:!.th and Brom1, but lt could not be
used to prove the same conspiracy against the co-conspirator
and defendant, Clinton Knuckles.

6

You have here one conspiracy which is charged
against three man, and under the law of conspiracy, certainly
any statement or act done by any co-conspirator during the time
of the conspiracy, or during the life of the conspiracy, is
chargeable to all the conspirators.

Any deed, any act or any

word spoken by.: co-conspirator it is charged to the other man,
It is his act, too.

Q

It's his statement, too.

6th Circuit thought that some of these errors were

harmless because these men uere caught ~:i th the truck and
in possession of large amount of stolen goods, and nothing
could have alter.ed the r.esult, is that about right?
HR. LUNDY:

I don I t think so, Your Honor, and if

you t·iill per.mit me to I will explain uhy I don I t think so.

Q

You concede that's a p~etty strong case against

theiu?
HR. LUNDY:

They hod a pretty strong case against

them fol" stealing out of the oarehouse in Cincinnati.
If all of this stuff that tuis taken out of the store
was not used against them, I think they could not have proven
a Federal cace against them, nor could they have proven a
conspiracy against them.
Now, I say that for this reason.

At the trial of the

case, the Court instructed the jury that they must have found
these defendants guilty of having committed the third overt
act ch.::!r.gcd in the indict:lllcnt in ordex to get the case into

7

Kentucky.
One overt act, according to the trial Court, had to
have been COl!llllittcd in Kentucky.

Otherwise, the Eastern

District in Kentucky t ould have had no venue over the case.
There would h::ive been :improper venue.
Now, that overt act charged that thesa men delivered
stolen mcrchandioe which they had stolen in Cincinnati and
taken to Manchester, Kentucky.
Now, the Court instructed the jury to that effect,
th£lt if they didn't find them guilty of co11111itting that one
overt act, then there uould have been no business of being
in the United States District Court.
Nou, without all this merchandise that was gotten
out of the store doun there in Mnncheoter, Kentucky, they
couldn't have proven that, and they wouldn't have had venue
and they wouldn't have proved any interstate transportation.
They may have got them for stealing in the State of Ohio, but
they t;ouldn I t have had them. for any interstate violation.
So, from tlu:t point of view, I don't think it was a
harmleso error.
this manner.

I think that -- I look at a har.nless error in

If you suppress the evidence and take it out of

it, you ought to have o chance to beat the case.

You ought to

have o chance to uin the cace.
Nou, ii you lecve it in there ,.ould you h::ive any
chance to uin or \1ouldn I c you.

If you leave it in there,

8

certainly you wouldn't have, but if you take it out, the
Government doesn't have much of a case.
Would the ex:lusioruiry rule apply when it 1s the

Q

Government'a attempt to prove venue as opposed to proving
elementa of the offense itself?
MR. LU1'DY:

Well, I don't know, Your Honor.

wouldn't think it uould make any diff.erence, really.

I
If t:he

evidence is excluded, it is excluded probably for all purposes.
If you couldn't admit t:he evidence in the trial itself which
t:he Government 1:ould have to do, then they uouldn' t have proven
their venue.
So, if you supprecs it, you suppress it for all
purposes.
No,1, I am su'!:e that this Court is auare that this
Court hos rendered decisions in cases uhich touch upon this
point, certainly in the case of Jones. v. United States and
Sirmuons v. United sc~tcs and Alderman v. United States, in
tihich the rule h~s been established that a man doesn I t have to
come in and claim possession of so~ething in order to have
standing to oupprcsa it,
or bas

SOIUC

If he is either around the premises

posncssa ·y interest in it, uby he has standing,

Nou, I thinl. that in the case 11hich is allilost
pr.ecisely in point with the facts of this case is a decision
that uno rendcr.ed in July, 1971, that: sscc out of 2nd Circuit,
United Statcu v. Price,

9

The facts in that case were very similar to the
ones in this case, and there t~as a oituation tlhcre so;ne
fellous E.tclc a bunch of TV sets nod they took them and hid them
in u uarchouse come place.
The \larehouce was not :..n the possescion of, nor t-ias
the defendant present wben the search uas made in the warehouse,
and the 2nd Circuit came to the conclusion that the man had
standing to suppress the evidence and in their opinion they
remanded the case for a hearing on that point in order that
he tn.'.lY establish it.
No~~, the 6th Circuit, of course, in this very case
here -- and,incidentally,in the Price case it involved a
conspiracy also.
Nou, the 6th Circuit, of course, has taken a
contrary posit:i.on.

They say thnt my men have no standing to

suppress this evidence because they weren't thoro and it wasn't
a posscssory crime, and they hod no standing to suppress it.
No~,, certainly the lau was not complied ttith in this
case.

The judge of the police court of Uanchcater, Kentucky,

just signed his name to a piece of paper.

He told the County

Attorney -- and t1e can ascumc that mnybc the c~.ty judge in
a small toi~n doesn't lmmt any better, being a layman -- he
told the county attorney, he said, ''You can go over and
just fill it in.

I've got to take my ttife to the hospital."

And I think tho man signed another piece of paper for

10
the affidavit and told the county attorney to go over and fill
it in,

And the county attorney filled in the affidavit for

the search t?arront, a.:id he talked to the defendant •· the
proposed defendant -- and they didn't have enough detail·
in it, so they tore that up and did another one.

And then

they gave this to the officers and the officers went d011n there
and searched.

Q

There is no issue about that being a wholly

invalid llar-.<'ant, Mr. Lundy,

There ism issue about that,

is there?
NR. LUNDY.

The Asoisuint United States Attorney

admitted it uasn' t north the paper it was written on •:Q

And, as I unjerotand it, tile Government here in this

Court proceodo on the premise that that was tin invalid uarrant.
l-lR. LUNDY:

That's true, but I would like to make

this, t1hat I think is a distinction.

We are frequently reminded

that because the constable bungles the felon goes free.

This

Thie isn't the case t-1here some law officers

they may have acted out of ignorance,
This is a case tlhcre the error was con:J11itted by
a judicial officer and by prosecuting at:torn<?y tiho should have
knotin better.

Q

Wac Knuckles ever p:rooccuted?

MR. LUNDY:

Yes, he's been tried t1,ice, so far.

The Court went into severance as to Knuckles

because all the evidence

that tias seized could not be

admitted against him, but it could be admitted against these

Of course, I am sure the Court reasoned that he

couldn't just take that all of a sudden as bein: introduced
in evidence and then cdmonish the jury, "You consider this
against Smith and Bro1·m but you forget about it over here
as far as Knuckles is concerned.
I don't mean to mislead the Court.

Knuckles 1·1ao

He has been tried

subsequently under a succeeding indictlllent that the Government
has tried to make ii.qprovcments on.

Q

Uhat has been the result of tho Knuckles trials7

Are they hung juries :n both cases?
HR. LUNDY:

'£he first case •:ias a hung jury and

the second caso was a mistrial.
And the second case 11as under indictment nU111ber 2
and the third case tias undei: indictment number 3, and the
succeeding indictments had t~10 more co-conspirators named
in those casea.

12
But it :ts very difficult for me to se:e ho~ •· if
you a~c going to prove one consp~racy, you can use different
quantities

or qualii:ies of cvi.c"ence to prove it aeainst

different people.
If ~-1e three gentlemen sitting her.e conspire to
commie a crime, it bothers me to think that they ccn use more
evidence aga:lnst me than they can against these too :fellows.
You oughC to be able to take the same eviclen~e
to convict all three of u~ and you ought to let the same
quality of evidence be used as far as all of us are conceZ'Iled.

No,,,

~,:I.th her.e is noc, I 11ould say, a possessory crime pa:t' se,

But the United States couldn't prove this case unless

it shoiied that EOlllCtimes theme r~en bad ~11 this two t:-uckloads
of stuff in their possession.
So it had to prove posGession at so~c point to prove

13
If I made one overt act, then they've got us all.

Anything

The law is very plain,

This Court has spoken on

several occasions to the effect that a partnership -- a
conspiracy is a partnership in crime, that acts and the
statements of a co-conspirator made in the course of Che
conspiracy are admissible against all conspirators uho uere
conspirators at that time.
in the tricl of this case, the Court so instructed

the jury in effect.
Q

(inaudible)
MR. LUNDY:

Well, I am arguing about this idea of

agency and conspiracy to try to reason my way through and if

I can help the Court to reason its way through -Q

The

only statements at issue here uere made after the

conspiracy -MR. LtnIDY:

Th.'.lt 1 s true,

I am not ta king about

that

Q

Isn 1 t that the only issue here?
MR. LUNDY:

I am tolking about the Fourth Amendment

issue.
Q

As I understood your point, at least in your brief,

v.as that ~:hat is sauce for the goose should be sauce for the
gander, and if the Government can take all the advantage of
thi~ conspiracy thaory then you ought to have some of the

14
advantage of it in holciing that Knuckles t-1as a member of the
partnership and your agent.

MR. LUNDY:
Q

That's precisely it.

There are no prea=est statements at issue here?
HR. LtnlDY:

Q

Isn't that it?

No, sir.

Okay.

t-m..

LutIDY:

All l:he stntcmcmts ~-,ere made aften•1ards.

Nou, the Court instr.ucted the jury "- I am referring
to page 226 of the Appendu:, whei:e the Coll:,:t very plainly -and it is in quotes, "A conspiracy f.s a Ld.nd of a i;artnership

No, sir, they did not.

It may be a fiction to call that a partnership, and
anybody t1ho does, I

actually or figuratively.
MR. LUNDY:

What case clid ue do that in?
MR. Lilli.DY:

Your Honor.

Q

That's been done in several cases,

I think that --

Was anything ever said about partnership law, or

~1as the term partnership in these cases used in a colloquial
sense, a shorthand for saying tlu:tt in their criminal conduct
they acted 1:1.ko partner.s in the sense tbat it uos a joint

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Evans.

OR.~ f.RGUMEIIT OF M. L. EVAiiS, ESQ. ,
O?l BI!llALF OF 'IRE APPELI.EE

?-JR. EVANS :

Mr. Chief Jus t:ice, and ma:, it please the

Court:
This case presents principally t:uo questions re•
lating to tho application of tho automatic standing rule.
First, ~~r.ether it applies where the possession
charged is of otolen property.

Second, uhether ii: applies

where the possession charged is posseosion thai:: Illas at a time
othc,: than a t:l.a:e ~1hcn the sem:ch and seizure toolt 9lace.
In our viet·i, the ansuo;: to both of theso questions
is no.
The

case t~hich

1,;as

case is similor.,in some respects, t o ~ Combs
h(!-.:'e lost ter.ru and which the Court disposed of

18

without deciding the automatic standing issue.
On the day that Combs ~,as decided, certiorari was
granted here.
Mr, Lundy has detailed the facts,

In essence,

petitioners Bro,m and Smith t·1ere engaged in stealing merchandise f:com the Central Jobbing Company in Cinc:!.nnati.

They

transported the merchandise acrocs State lines to Kentucky
uhc:i:e they sold it to Clinton Knuckles, the oime:i: of the
Knucklea Dollar Store.
Tt~o months later, after the final act of interstate
transportation, a defective search warrant was issued and a
search t•1as conducted of Knuckles store.
The petitioners uere charged with interstate trans•
portation of stolen merchandise and with conspi:i:acy to commit
the substantive offense.

And on a motion to suppress they

sought to exclude the evidence that uas seized from the Knuckles
store.
The Court bclou rejected these contentions on the
ground that the petitioners lack standing to make them,
In our vieN, it is clear on these facts that the
petitioners have no standing under the traditional standing
rule.

That rule requires a shm~ing of an interest either in the

prec1ises that t~ere searched or in the property that was seized.
The petitioners here r.ave no interest in the
premir;es that t·icre searched.

1 t was Knuckles' store.

They

19
have never asserted that they had an1 interest in the premises,
and they were not present at the time the search was conducted.
In fact, they were in custody in Ohio, having been arrested the
previous day.
Nor do they have an interest in the property that
was seized,

There is no proprietary interest because the

property was stolen.

It didn't belong to them. There is

no possessory interest because they parted with the possession
two months earlier.
In other words, their Fourth Amendment rights were
not implicated by this search and seizure,
To the extent that Mr. Lundy has on argument here
attacked the traditional standing rule, I believe that as
recently as Alderman it has been upheld and definitively,
The Fourth Amendment rights are not assertable vicariously,
And their personal rights and the exclusionary rule is limited
to circumstances where one can allege that he has been a
victim of an unlawful search rather than one who is aggrieved
solely by introd~tion of evidence that was so seized,
Q

What about a traditional, conventional kind of

partnership,

Let's say a law partnership, and if something

is wrongfully seized can any one of the partners complain about
it under the Fourth Amendment? From the safe of a partnership,
say, or
MR. EVANS:

The ques,ion is a ha~d one to pose, I

20
think, because in most instances the situation is such that
the partner has an interest in the premises that were searched,
It is hard to even imagine a situation of a partnership property circumstance 11here there hasn't been some in•
vasion of the premises searched.
Q

loud.

But beyond that --

Well, lets say -- I am just kind of thinking out
I agree that in most law offices they would have a

lease in an office building and every partner would have an
interest in that piece of real estate,
But let's say that one of the partners takes some•
thing belonging to the partnership home tdtb him to his home.
Does every partner then have a Fourth .Amendment complaint if
that other partner's home is -c,irongfully entered and the property
seized?
HR. EVANS:

I think it is a close question.

l think

it can be argued on either side.
Q

Because here, rightly or wrongly, the trial judge

did tell the jury that this was a partnership.
~,ord, didn I t he?

He used that

Page 226 of the record.

MR. EVANS:

Hhen we are dealing with Fourth Amendment

questions, J. don't think that the partnership -- in the context
of this case, an~my -·· I don't think the partnership idea
really applies.
Q

But even if these concepts --

I wondered if you -- the 11ay you began your argument,

you ab:iolutely :tgnored the argument of your opponent,

You have

21
talked about this case as though it is just another Fourth
Amendment case.

You haven't paid any attention to his

argument that this is a conspiracy case and, therefore, it is
different, and that the trial judge didn't have the viet9,
at least,that this i,as a partner.ship.
MR. EVANS:

That's the t•1ord he used,

My ansuer to the argument is there are

several problenu; ~,ith it,

In the first instance, even if we

assllllle that partnership concepts are appropriate in their
traditional common lat1 sense, the traditional common law rule
is there cannot be a partnership for an illegal purpose,
But even putting that aside, the partnership is,
by Hr, Lundy' o assertions, coincident with the conspiracy.
The conspiracy ended, by definition, the day before the
search was made.

They were arrested, they had already given

their confessions, their. statements, at the time the search
uas made,
But in any event, even if

11c

go all the way and say

that on the oasis of this constructive possession theory they
had posses:Jion at the time the search t9as made, it is our view
that the posscssor.y interest in stolen property is not an
interest that the Fourth Amendment is designed to protect.
Q

So you really would argue then that if you run across

a fcll019 with a stolen car that under any circumstances you
can search the car because it is stolen?

Just oecause it is

stolen and not getting into any other baois for the search.

22

MR. EVANS:

I think that a stolen car is a slightly

different situation --

Q

It is property intereot.
llR. EVANS:

Right, thcr.e is no property interest,

And I would argue, I think, that such a search could be made,
The difference is that in some respects a car is like -you can enclose things 1·1ithin ii:,
like a house.

It is a large place almost

Even though it is not, you are :!.n a sense a

trespasser on that car.

And I would argue that the car may be

searched regardless --

Q

Just because it is stolen.
MR, EVANS:

Right.

Now, there is a consideration

that might lead to a different result,
Q

There are no cases around like that, are there?
MR. EVANS :

Not that I knm-1 of.

But there is a

consideration that could be brought to bear on the other side
of that issue and that: is that since we are concerned 1~ith the
detercnt fact of the Four.th Amendment in these standing
questions, it: could be that ~,here y:,u have a stolen car and it
is clear that people can search -- that police can search
stolen cars without anything more -- it might there have some
impact on the deterent effect of the Fourth Amendment.
Q

Does it make any difference in this case whether

there is standing or not? Do you really care? As long as
there is no interest: in the store -- and it is conceded that

23

there isn't -- the officer.s 1,1ere validly 11here they ~,ere,
right?
MR. EVANS:

Well, if there is stand5.ng in tho

petitioners to assert the Fourth Amendment, as claimed, I
believe
Q

But not 11ith respect to the store.

Let's assU111e

they have standing to assert an interest in the goods, an
illegal seizure of the goods.

They may have standing to

assert it, but uon't they automatically lose?
MR.. EVAHS:

Q

It is stolen property, isn't it?
NR. EVANS:

Q
they?

Well, I think not because••
It is stolen property.

The officers have probable cause to seize it, don't
They are legally where they are 11hen they see it.
11.R. EVANS:

They are not legally where they are

because they entered
Q

No, 1•1e just put aside the fact that they did not

illegally enter the store,w:lth respect to this defendant.
MR. EVANS:
Q

yes, that's right.

I gathered your colleague on the other side conceded

that he 11asn't arguing that the partnership in crime gave his
clients any interest in the store, that they could assert under
the Fourth Amendment.
MR. EVANS:

Right.

And in our view, nor did they

have any interest in the prope~ty.

24
Q

Well, even if they did they would lose -MR. EVANS:

I suppose that is right, yes.

Because the petitioners here lack the traditional
•• Gtanding under the traditional rule -·· they sought to
invoke the automatic rule that was established by the Jones
case.

The automatic standing rule is a narrow exception
to the traditional rule.
In Jones, narcotics uere seized from a -- during a
search and seizure of an apartment belonging to a friend of the
defendant.

While the defendant was on the premises, he was

charged uith various narcotics offenses t1hl.ch, because of
statutory pr.esumptions, permitted conviction on showing of
mere knowing poi::session.
On these facts, the Court held first that the
defendant's lm;ful presence on tbe premises gave him a sufficient interest in the premises to justify his standing to
challenge the reasonableness of the search of those premises
and to move to suppress the proofs.
Now,this ar.psct of the Jones case is not involved
here because, as everybody is agreed, the petitioners have
never asserted an interest in the Knuckles store.
The court, in Jones, could have stopped there, but it
went on and it considered whether independent of Jones'
inter.est: in the premises searched, llhether he had a sufficient

25
interesc in Che property that was seized to justify standing.
Nou, it uas, of couxse, the fact that Jones possessed
the narcotics that he m1s accused of possessing, and he possessed
them at the time the seizure was made.
And it was apparent, in the Court's viet·l, that had
Jones been prepared to come for14ard and testify as to his
possession, at the time of the seizur.e, he uoulc have had
standing under the traditional rule.
The problem uas he was not in a position to cooie
fo:..·ward.

He 1·1as not uilling to come forward to testiiy. And

the reason he oas not ii:tlling to come fort~al."d to testify is
because, at that time, there ~1as substantial risk that his
testimony as to his possession at the time of the suppression
hearing could be used against him in the trial as part of the
Government's case in chief.
Because of this dilemma that the defendant t·1as
faced with, the Cou'i:t ruled that he need not Dl!lke the sho14ing.
Where the Government, :tn its indictment, has already conceded,
in effect, that he could make the showing.
Thel."c 11as a co.:-ollary rationale that tias articulated
by the Court, as ~1ell.

And that is that contrary holding, that

is, tb.:it Jones must come foruard or in practical effect 1~ould
be unable to come forward, would give the Government the
benefit of inconsistent position, because it \1ould be arguing
in a sense at the trial that the defendant possessed the

26
na!".'cotics at the t:une they t.cre seized,

That t.as the basis

of the charge.
While at the suppress~on hearing, by challenging
his standing, they nould implicitly be saying that he had no
possession at the time of the seizure.
This, the Court viet;ed 1s not consonant uith the
amenities of the administration of crimill<!l justice.
The first thing to be said about
the case here ii.: that unlike

.J.2..I!!ll!.

in respect of

J.2.ns.!!. the petitioners here have

no standing under the traditional standing rule.
As uc have discussed, they have no interest in the
Knuckles store and, :i.n our vieu, they have no interest in
the property seized.
In ou.'t' viet,, the auto:natic standing rule of Jones
uas designed solely for those oho t~ould oth.e·:uise have had
standing under

1:,1c

t,:-aditional rule, but tierc unable to assert

that standing because of the situation that prevailed at that
time t·Jith respect t:o the use of testimony, supp:ression testimony ,
at a subsequent trial.
Because Broi.n and Smith have no standiug under the
t:~aditional rule, uc think that they should not be the
bencfic iuries of the r.ule that uas designed for i:hore who
would have such standing.
Nor docs the Jones rationale compel a different -- an

-·-

extension
of the Jones rationale to the-· nor does the Jones
.

27
rationale compel an e:,tension of its rule to the facts here.
Since there is no standing under the traditional
rule, thci:e defendants m,n:e not faced ~iith the dilemma that
Jones was faced with.

His dileninia arose becauoe the testimony

that he uould have been prepared to give to establish standing
could have been used against him.
Here there i.s no dilemma because tb.er.e is no
testimony to establish standing and there is no testimony that
they are not in the posit:ton that Jones was in to come forward
and establiGh it.

Q

Their attoraey says that because they were, quote,

partners, and joint venturers, at least if I understand his
argument, then Knuckles t·1as the agent of Brown and Smith for
Fourth Amendment purposes.
MR. EVANS:
dec:!.ded in Alderman.

At least I think that's \~hat he •·

I believe that this is in essence
At least appears to be to me.

The ruling

stated by Aldei-men is that co-conspirators are not entitled to
assert another co-conspirator' o F'ourth Amendment rights.
And if that's the argument that's being made, I think
5. t has been ans~:ercd.

I don't think that there is any precedent for a
vicarious asse,:tion of rigb.ts, even uith:l.n a conspiracy,
t·1hethcr you call it a partnership or not.

Q

There wasn't any personal property involved in

Alde~ that 1,as allegedly the joint property of co-conspirators.

28

NR.. EVANS:
Q

No.

That's right.

The question was one of personal privacy -r,m. EVANS:

'rhat's right.

I think the same

principles apply here, nonetheless.
Q

There can be a vicarious uaiver of Fourth .Amendment

rights, can't the~e?
I can't, at the moment, recall the style of the case
-- the "duffle bag case"•· Fraser v. Cuff -- where the fellow
sayc, "Sure, you can go ahead and search my duffle bag,"
and in there he found John Smith's effects. And ue said John
Smith has no

John Smith's rights tiere waived by the owner

of the duffle bag.
MR. EVANS:
the duffle bag.

In a sense, John Smith had no rights in

He had his rights -- his rights were in the

property that was in the duffle bag.
Q

.Mr. Evans, uh.at if a man is uearing a stolen overcoatZ

Let's spin this thing out one more step.

Do

you think the

ove,:coat can be searched, as in Justice White's analogy, ,1ithout
any other grounds for seaTCh, just that since the overcoat is
stolen the man has no standing to object to its search?
MR. EVANS:

I think not, Nr, Justice, because I

think in that instance it uould be difficult to argue that bis
person was not invaded, that his interest in his Otin person -I think that's the ansuer to it.
Q

What if the~e are stolen goods in the pocket?

29
UR. EVANS:

The same ansuer as ! have given to

Mr. Just:!.ce Rehnquist,

I believe thet an invas:l.on of what one

is uecring, even if \•Jhat one is t:earing is stolen, I uould
think is au invasion of the pezson.

I would not t1ant to have

to argue up here the other side of that issue.
Q

But you f;ould argue the oppc.s:!.te?
MR. EVANS:

Q

You m:.ght h..'lve to argUP. it :ln the bo7.'der search case,
MR. FVANS:

Q

Yes .

'£hat's r1.ght,

And, t;ouldn' t you also tal<:e the position that

after they broke in, after they searched Knuckles' place, if
they had gone into any of the material that they had found,
they might have a problem, but they didn't go into them.

Is

tht>.t right?
MR. EVANS:
Q

cartons.

You mean :l.f they h.ld opened t:he cartons?

No, if they had opened the machines that were in the

But they didn't.

They just took the cartons, am I

right?
MR. EVANS:

It is my understanding that in the cartons

were things like men I s and ladies' shoes and that kind of
thing, but they didn't go in.
Q

But I don't think th.lt it•-

But ion' t your point that it 1~asn • t the property of

thece people, and it does put them in a pretty good dilemma.
:i.f they claim that it is their property, they are hung, and
if they don't, they are hung.

30
MR. EVANS:

I think not because, as I have indicated,

they gave up a possessory intexest in the property some ~,o
months before the sea::cb rn1s made.

So even if they were to

come forward and make on assertion that they couldn't make,
namely, that they did possess

it at the time the sea~ch was

made. I think that the applicable -rule in those circUlllstances
would be the Si1r.mons rule uhich resolves the dilemrca in a non•

.J!?.!!£.[ context, namely, the testimony they gave ,10uld not

be

aole to be used against the~.
~hat seems to me to be the sensible resolution of
the problem.
To Sll!lllUlri~e the discussion t~ith respect to the
dilemma aspect of

:Ifil.l£.!!, as applied here, we think it just

does noi: require -- since there is no dilemna that remains at
this point -- there is no need to apply the automatic standing
rule on our facts.
Nor, do we think that the alternative rationale of

.:!2!1£.!!

requires an application of ito rule on t!icsc facts.

Because in the circumstances we have here, the:re is no in•
consistency of position th.:!t the GoveZ'tllllent is forced to take,
The Government musi: show, as part of its case, and
did 3ho1·1 that Broon and Smith posscE:sad the Central Jobbing
Company merchandise at somo point, but that possession t-ias
1:~10

•

months p:!:io,: to tho l:ime the search tas made,
The gove:cnmcnt need not deny at the supprossion

31

hearing that the petitioners uere al: one time in possession of
the merchandise.

It is a t'1holly consistent position.

Its argument really is that at the time of the
search there uas no possessory interest justifying Fourth
Amendment protection.
Or, alternatively, even if thc!'e uaa such a :?ourth
Alllendment interest that deserved protection, or even if there
i1as coincident or contemporaneous possession, the possession
was of stolen property, and the possession of stolen property
mc:o:it:o no Fourth Amendment protection.
In our vi.cu, therefore, thc:-:e is no reason to apply
on these facts a rule that uas designed to benefit only those
who uould have had stsnding under the traditioru:il rule.
But for a Constitutional dilcr r~ that has been
raoolvecl in a different way by Simmons, the petitioners here
seek not a resolution of a dilemma that they face, but really
a reaping of an unintended and unnecessary wind[all.
Thero is another issue in this case involving a
Bruton violation.

The:o:c tias testimony at the trial concerning

statements made by both Brown and Smith which were, in some
respects, cr.oss:-i11c:u~.vatory.
We concede this was error, but as ue detail in our
br.icf, ne bcJ.ievo- the error was harmless beyond a reasonable
doubt.

And, unless there are questions, I do not propose to

deal with it further at this timC!.
