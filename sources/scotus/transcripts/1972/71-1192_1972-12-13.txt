PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

now in No. 71-1192» Goldstein and Koven against the State
of California.
Mr. Leeds, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ARTHUR LEEDS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. LEEDS;

Thank you, Your Honor.

Mr. Chief Justice, and way it please the Court:
The question presented by this case is whether or
not the State of California has the right, or any other State,
through the use of its criminal laws to enact what is, in
effect, copyright for sound recordings.
I would put it further than that.

What is, in

effect, a copyright that goes further than any Federal copy­
right has ever gone, and could ever go, under the provisions
of Article l, Section 6, Clause 8 of the Constitution.
Q

It will help me, at the outset, Mr. Leeds, if you

will help me get clarified the situation that existed before
thle recent Federal statute.

I am thinking of the case of

Shapiro-Bemstein y. Remington Records back in the 2d Circuit
io about 1956 or 7, where they were dealing with the two cent
per record copyright.
Hinder what kind of a statute was that two cents
required to be paid to anyone who copied a record?

4
MR. LEEDS:

Yes, Your Honor.

That is somewhat confusing.

The Federal statute

requires — prior to Public Law 92-140 — required that anyone
who wished to use the underlying musical composition — and by
that I mean the work of the composer, which is usually assigned
to a publishing house — anyone who wished to use that, could
do so upon payment of two cents per use.
That would mean if you made an album you might make
12 uses.

If you sold a thousand albums, you would make 12,000

uses.
And you had to pay the two cents to the composer for
the use of that song.

And the composer could stop anyone from

making use of the song, as long as he didn't use it on a record.
But under Title 17, Sections 1(e) and 101(e), as
they existed prior to Public Law 92-140, once anyone was allowed
to make a recording, a sound recording, then the so-called
compulsory license provisions came into effect, and anyone
else could make what was called a similar use by paying the
statutory royalty of two cents and by filing the required
notice of intent to use.
Q

This wouldn't pertain to the first recording company,

would it?
MR. LEEDS:

Ho,Your Honor, it would be paid only to

the publishing house, the composer.
We have to divide up here the difference between the

5
composer and the performing artist.
We have two separate interests involved here.

One

would be the interest of the composer, the man who writes the
song

A Verdi opera, for instance, Verdi would have one

interest.

The performer who performed it and recorded his

performance would have another interest.
Those are two separate and distinguishable interests.
As a matter of fact, Your Honor, I think that the
Congress that passed the law in 1909, which remained essentially
unchanged until Public Law 92-140 became effective on February
15th of this year.
Congress said, as part of its committee report

that

accompanied that 1909 law, it is not the intention of the
committee to extend the right of copyright to the mechanical
reproductions themselves, but only to give the composer or
copyright proprietor the control in accordance with provisions
of the bill of the manufactur and use of such devices.
And 1 think it has been universally accepted —
Q

That's in connection with the new bill?
MR. LEEDS:

Ho, Your Honor, that's in connection with

the 1909 Act, the original act.
The new bill — the legislative history involved with
the new bill is set out, to some extent, in our reply brief.
I call Your Honors' attentions to that first number
in our reply brief, which commences at page 4, which discusses

6
some of the legislative intent, because the question has come
up as to whether Public Law 92-140 was in any way intended to
change the prior legislative history.
By that, it has been argued by respondent, that
somehow Congress, in Public Law 92-140, intended to authorize
the States to enact the legislation similar to the California
statute.
As we point out in our brief, we think that is
absolutely contrary to both the letter of the statute, which
says it shall have no effect on previous law or on the sound
recordings recorded prior to Public Law 92-140, and also upon
the legislative history as expressed in the committee report.

At one point, the committee report quotes, or sets
out, a letter from the Justice Department, and the Justice
Department said the bill does not apply retroactively and
Section 3, which is Section 3 of the new law, Public Law 92-140,
expressly states that it should not be construed as affecting
in any way any rights with respect to sound recordings fixed
before the date of enactment.
Q

What about after?
MR. LEEDS:

Your Honor, with respect to sound

recordings fixed and published after Public Law 92-140, they
would be presumably covered by Federal copyright.

And 1 think

even the State must concede either they are covered by Federal
copyright or they are not covered at all.

7
Q

So, if a State had a law before, it has become

inoperative for the post-Federal law —
MR, LEEDS:

I would think that there could be no

question about that, Your Honor.
They are in direct conflict.

The Federal law

provided for 28 years copyright, plus 28 years -- and this
is important now -- the State's law provide no limitation.
It goe3 on in perpetuity.
Q

In any event, the importance of this case is

limited to events and rights that arguably have been fixed
before the passage of the Federal law?
MR. LEEDS:

I think, Your Honor, in light of the

facts that are directly in front of this Court, that is
correct, that the sound recordings which are the subject of
this case were recorded, quite clearly, prior to February 15,
1972, because the events which occurred in the lower Courts
had already

-- in fact the conviction had already been entered

long before February 15, 1972.
So that the effect of the new law is to provide —
and we argue and we think Congress makes it clear — that the
effect of the new law is to establish a period of experiment.
In fact, that is exactly what the committee report states.
The committee report states that — and the Act itself provides
that sound recordings recorded between that very special time
subsequent to February 15, 1972, and no later than December 31,

8
1S74, are entitled to copyright protection, a limited kind of
copyright protection, only against duplication, the kind of
act which is involved in this case.
Congress said the reason they did that was because
they needed further time to examine the possibilities and the
other alternatives towards the solution — the ultimate
solution — in this areaOne such solution which has been suggested, and I
concede, Your Honor, that I was one of the people that suggested
it to Congress at the time, was that there be a compulsory
licensing provision similar, Mr, Chief Justice, to the pro*’
visions of the old law, and the new law, with respect to the
composer's rights, not necessarily limited to two cents, of
course, but a so-called compulsory licensing provision.
Congress has decided it needed further time to study
this problem.
We suggest that that kind of time and that kind of
Congressional intent is mooted by a decision of this Court,
and certainly by a decision of any other Court, that the State's
have a right to enact permanent, perpetual monopoly protection.
Q

1 saw it with many amicus briefs here with maybe a

half a dozen States.
MR. LEEDS;
Honor.

I think there are more than that, Your

I believe there are 10 States.
Of course, the other side of that coin is that there

9
are 40 States that do not.
And I think the amicus. Recording Industry Association
of America has alluded to the fact that they have spent a
great deal of money, or at least that they have spent a great
deal of time in attempting to establish these laws in various
States.
Q

The States that have them, apparently, are the States

where the recording industry is a pretty large economic factor
in the State, Tennessee, New York, California, Florida.
MR. LEEDS:

The Florida statute, of course, has been

subject, of course, to the ruling of this Court, but has
been declared to be unconstitutional by —■ which is almost
an identical statute —
Q

Tennessee, New York and California.
MR. LEEDS:

Yee, Your Honor.

Some other States,

too.
I am not in a position to say how important any of
the record industry is in any of those States, but —
Q

Now, these are basically the same laws as the one

that is involved in this case?
MR. LEEDS:

Basically, the same law, but Tennessee

would be the one distinction.
demeanor.
Q

The other laws make it a mis­

I think that Tennessee makes it a felony, but —
They are all criminal laws?
MR, LEEDS:

They are all criminal laws, yes, Your

10
Honor.
I would point out that one of the problems of these
State laws is that, whereas in the Federal law, both in the
copyright laws and the patent laws, the ultimate goal is to
have a dedication to the public.
This Court has said, and I believe to quote for just
a moment, in the Sears case, Sears Roebuck v, Stiffel, !,Thu3s
the patent system is one in which uniform Federal standards
are carefully used to promote invention while at the same time
preserving free competition."
I really do not see how anyone could say that the
State laws are a system of uniform Federal standards.

They

are, quite clearly, to the contrary.
They are something other than uniform Federal
standards.
Further, they do not -- and I think that should be
quite obvious — they do not promote competition.

Rather, they

are contrary to the very purpose of the patent laws and the
copyright laws and to the Article l, Section 8, Clause S* of
the Constitution.
Q

Do you think it is unconstitutional for a State to

declare that it is unfair competition when a stranger simply
copies a recording made by a major company after that other
company has engaged the artist, perhaps paid a musician to.
work out the arrangement, and hired the equipment and done all

11
the work necessary to produce that recording.
Then, are you saying that the State can't put any
limitation on other people simply making a copy of that and
taking advantage of all that expense that has been incurred?
MR. LEEDS:
saying that.

Yes, Your Honor, I am most definitely

I think that's what this Court has said repeatedly.

I think that's what this Court said in Sears Roebuck
and said in the Compco cases.
The Court has said if there is to be such protection,
itnust come from the Federal Government.
As we recall, and I believe this Court cited us to
Madison in the Federalist. Number 43, where Madison said that
the States

cannot make effectual protection for copyrights

or patents.
Q

It has to be uniform on a national scale.

Does the new act contain the same kind of compulsory

provision as the 1909 Act?
MR, LEEDS:

It does with respect to the composer's

rights.
Q

Clarify this for me.

Aren't the composer's rights

protected by having the copier pay the two cents per record
to the master recording company, and then the master recording
company must account to the artists?
MR. LEEDS:
Q

That is not the way it works, Your Honor.

Under the new act?
MR. LEEDS:

Under both the old act and the new act,

12
payment must be made according to statute directly to the
copyright proprietor.

That is, the copyist, or duplicator

does not make his payment to the original record company and
have the record company forward the payment on to the copyist
— esccuse me, to the composer.
payment directly
correct.

The copyist must make his

to the composer, under Section 1(e), that’s

And under 101(e).
So that the payments do go directly.

There are

specific protections provided under the Federal law.

Those

protections must be followed by the copyist or he is in
violation of Federal law.
If he does not follow those protections, then he is
subject to civil suits and, under Public Law 92-140, the new
law, he is subject to criminal penalties also, as well.
That was one of the provisions in the law.
Q

Have we had cases involving this before?

Sears and

Compco were patents.
HR. LEEDS:

Yes, but Mr. Justice Black, in his

opinions in both cases, especially in the Compco case,
specifically referred to the copyright protections.
Q

Wasn't the Sears case the copying of a lamp of some

kind?
MR. LEEDS:

Yes, it was, Your Honor.

And the
*

respondents made this distinction.

They say that one who

copies a lamp or imitates a lamp, somehow appropriates the

13
sound recording.
That distinction, I have to confess, escapes me<,
It is a distinction without a factual difference.
The distinction leads us to this remedy, to this
solution, that if one wants to make a copy of a Rembrandt
painting, one must make a freehand sketch of the Rembrandt
painting.
But if you take a photographic copy, because that
is, after all, a mechanical reproduction, that somehow you
have lost your rights, the Rembrandt has jumped out of the
public domain and now is protected and presumably — I don’t
want to make those arguments which I recall are referred to
as an "Oh, my God” argument — but presumably that when one
wants to copy a Rembrandt, one must go and find the eras of
Rembrandt if you want to make a photograph, because these
protections, according to State law, last in perpetuity.
There are no limitations of any kind, no provisions
for dedication of the rights to the public.
Q

Mr, Leeds, the Chief Justice a moment ago asked you

if a certain State action would be unconstitutional and you
said yes, it would.
Do you think State action of this sort is un­
constitutional by virtue of supremacy clause or that it would
be unconstitutional by virtue of the patent grant to Congress
in the Constitution, even if Congress had never implemented its

14

authority under that grant?
MR. LEEDS:

I think it would be unconstitutional

under both clauses, Your Honor.
I think that Article 1, Section 8,Clause 8, is a
grant of authority and a grant of power to the Congress.
When read in connection with Madison*8 Federalist,
I think he makes it as clear as possible, and I believe going
back to the Banks case, Banks v. Manchester, way back in 3.888,
I believe it was, this Court held that this power to make
copyrights

rested only by the Constitution within Congress.
But I think we needn't find that in this case,

because I think in this case we have a clear legislative
intent as expressed for a number of years, from 1909 through
1972, that you either find your rights under the Copyright Law
or you don't find your rights at all.

1 think that one example of this is the fact that on
more than 31 separate occasions the recording industry brought
to Congress, and had introduced in Congress, legislation which
would have made sound recordings the subject of copyright,
and on each occasion it failed.
There is one occasion cited, X believe, in my petition
where the matter came out of the Judiciary Committee, the House
Judiciary Committee, with such a provision in tact, and it
was amended on the floor of the House.
amended out.

That provision was

The request to amend it was joined in by the

15
chairman of the Committee.
I think it was clear that Congress simply did not
want to grant this protection.
The States have come along and aaid, well, there is
a mistake here.

Congress has made a mistake.

The sound

A.

recordings have no protection.

We just simply can’t have that.

We must have some protection.
After all, as has been pointed out, California has
a great stake, it feels, in the sound recording industry,
as do New York and Tennessee.
It brings people into the State because entertainers
are there.
We have to protect it, and if Congress is only going
to give protection to post-February 1972 sound recordings
and grant no protection to a prior recording, we are just going
to have to do something about that.

Congress is simply wrong.

It is petitioner's position that the States have
no right to say that Congress is wrong in this area, that
Congress defines the public domain.
Q

Could I ask you to clarify this?

Say a sound

recording was made prior to the day of the new act and then
comes along the new act and the person who made that sound
recording then wants to take advantage of the Federal law for
the old recording.
MR. LEEDS:

May he?
I believe,

he may, Your Honor.

I concede

16
that Professor Nimmcr has taken the position that he may not,
but it seems to me that we then have again this idea of some­
thing that was in the public domain on February 14, 1972, and
on February 15th jumps out of the public domain*
I believe that this Court said in Graham v* John
Deere that that can’t happen*
Q

So you are saying that he may not take it.

your position?

Is that

He may not take advantage of the new Federal

law?
MR* LEEDS:

I am not certain what you mean by take

advantage.
It is my opinion that the copyist may copy, yes,
Your Honor.
Q

And the person who made the recording may not seek

the protection of the Federal law?
MR. LEEDS:

Not with respect to recordings fixed or

published prior to February 15, 1972.

That is correct, Your

Honor.
Q

Because he has already dedicated it, you think?
MR. LEEDS:

Because he is already dedicated, and

the Act specifically states that it applies only to sound
recordings fixed and published, both, after February 15, 1972.
I suggest, Your Honor, that that is a necessary
requirement.
Q

Going back to the abuses which led —

I don’t mean to argue it.

I just wanted to know what

17

your opinion was, what the fact was.
MR. LEEDS:
Q

Thank you, Your Honor.

Common Jaw in the States or statutory law involving

unfair competition, isn’t there?
MR. LEEDS):
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

I am sure it involves something like palming off

and deceptionu
MR, LEEDS:

That is exactly correct, Your Honor.

We believe that if there is deception, the passing
off of one’s product as another's product, that the States
may control that.
But I point quite clearly to the statute involved
here.

Labeling and how this product was labeled has nothing

to do with the commission of the crime involved here.
The crime is committed when the product is manu­
factured for resale or when it is sold.
It doesn’t matter how it is labeled.

It could bear

no label at all, and it is a crime, in other words, the simple
act of copying that which is in the public domain under Federal
law*

•

.............

. j-

Respondents have argued that it cannot be in the
public domain, because if you put it in the public domain
there is no protection.
I suggest that that Is a circuitous argument.

To

say something doesn’t f«ill in the public domain simply bacaus*

18
if it falls in the public domain it has no protection, leads
us nowhere.
I think Judge Hand made that -- Judge Learned Hand
made that point in at least four separate cases, spanning from
the early 1930‘s through the 1950's.

He said in a case,

Fashion Originators case,where there was a so-called dress
piracy or design piracy, Judge Hand said that you either get
Federal protection or you have no protection, and that the
copyist was free to go ahead and copy these dress designs,
and he pointed out that to rule otherwise would be to really
negate Federal law, because if you allow the States to decide
what is publication, because that is principally what the
respondent argues here.
Respondent argues that the State should be free under
the common law copyright doctrines and under Section 2 of the
Copyright Act, to protect unpublished works.

And respondent

argues notwithstanding the fact that some of these albums sell
a million, two million, copies and, therefore, use — commercially
exploit through a conscious deliberate effort — commercially
exploit to the fullest extent possible the sound recordings,
nevertheless the recordings are not in the public domain.
As Judge Hand said, what more could be done to place
these items in the public domain?

Everhthing possible done to

commercially exploit them has been done.
And we suggest that recording companies with respect

19

to pre-February 1972 sound recordings, were put to the test*
If they wish to commercially exploit, then they did so just
as everyone else does who cannot get a patent and cannot get
a copyright.

They do so and to the benefit of the public

because, as this Court has held, the interests of the public
override the artist or the inventor or the performer.,
If that troubles anyone, I think it should be
remembered that this has been the law in the patent area for
years and years.

It has always been the law in the patent

area that an inventor may spend his whole life and all his
resources inventing, and if he cannot bring himself within
the Federal patent laws, he makes a dedication of his work to
the public as soon as he discloses it to the public.

He either

gets his patent protection or he gets no protection.
1 think that's the clear reasoning of Sears and
Compco and that is the way it has to be unless — if we are
going to have, excuse me — if we are going to have a uniform,
national patent and copyright laws.
Q

Are you saying then that the only way recording

companies can be protected is to get what they have been trying
to get, that is, have Congress authorize the copyrighting of
a recording as such, as distinguished from the material that
is being recorded?
MR. LEEDS:

Yes, Your Honor, X am suggesting that,

and I think, as I say, it is the only way we can be assured of

20
two things, one a uniform national copyright law.

So that

something that is capable of being copied in Washington can be
also copied in New York, or is capable of being copied in New
Jersey can also be copied in New York.
That is the only way we can assure that.
Second, it is the only way we can assure that we ever
have a dedication to the public.
It is to be remembered that these State laws last
in perpetuity.

In effect, they go way beyond what Congress has

even authorised during this experimental period.
Congress has said you can have a copyright for twentyeight years, and perhaps you can extend it for twenty-eight
years.
The State of California says y>tr can have a copyright
in perpetuity.

The exact same kind of copyright*

It: cannot any longer bo argued that the State is
only protecting against duplication because that is exactly what
the Federal law does.

It only protects against duplication.

It does not protect against the so-called imitation.
The State of California has, in effect, simply extended
it has given a boost to the Federal law.

It simply says that

we are going to take these products and extend protection in
perpetuity*
Efcw, another argument that has been made apparently
by some of the private amicus, at least the Recording Industry

21
Association of America. is that the rule such as proposed by
petitioners,that is, if this Court were to overrule the lower
Court, would destroy the recording industry.
I think there is absolutely no evidence of that and
no reason to believe it.

They novo have protection.

We are only talking about sound recordings which were
recorded prior to February 15, 1972.

Some of the sound

recordings that are being copied now, though not necessarily
involved in this case,but certainly some that are being done
around the country, as indicated by the amicus brief filed,
some of those recordings date back to pre-war, pre-Second World
War recordings.
Nevertheless, under the California statutes, and the
other statutes, they are protected and that protection simply
go:@s on and on and on.
X see that my time is up and 1 saved some time for
rebuttal.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Leeds.

Mr. Schacter,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID N. SCHACTER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR. SCHACTER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Presuming one issue before this Court, can the State
of California prevent the appropriation of recordings fixed

22

before February 15, 1972, which, therefore, are not protectable
under Federal law?
There is not before this Court any question of
concurrent Stateand Federal protection or the interpretation
of the Federal statute, Public Law 92-140.
Petitioners pled nolo contendere on June 28, 1971,
to appropriating recordings on a date prior to the enactment of
the Federal statute.
There is both a moral issue and a policy isstie in
this case.
As has been pointed out by the Chief Justice, for a
record company to make a recording, they must first go,on one
hand, to the person that has the right to the words and music.
They obtain from that person a license to use those
word3 and music.
From that point, we go to the other side of the
argument.

The record company now with just the words and

music, nothing more, must go out and hire a recording studio.
They must go out and hire artists, arrangers, copyists,
engineers, record producers.
They must pay money immediately upon the making of
the record to union pension plans, to music performance trust
funds.
And after all this money has been expended to make
this record or disc, it must be promoted, covers must be made.

23
Money must be spent in advertising.

And then there still is

no guarantee that that record will be a hit or when the revenue
will corae in.
Then, even after the records are sold, upon the
sale of the record, the record company must then take money
back and give it to the artists, the performers, and on top
of that, union funds that provide for free public performances
throughout the country.
Now, what does the pirate do?

The pirate goes to

a store and he buys a record for $3 or $4,

That is the extent

of his investment in the artistic composition.
He now has the performance.
says, copies.

He goes and makes, he

What they really are are duplicate originals.

This is a unique thing, something different than
anything before.
Here we have the types of items that existed in
this case.
This is the item the pirate puts out.

There is

nothing on it more than on the front 8-track stereo, on the
bottom, continuous play.

On the back it says don't put it too

close to the heat because it is not going to do it any good.
But what is the thing the public sees?

What is the

thing the public buys?
In the front, it says Sergeo Mendez, "Crystal Illusions,"
the name of the artist, the name of the performance and then

24
Program 1, Program 2, Program 3, Program 4, the exact
performances that are on the legitimate tape.
So what is being taken here?

He is not taking the

Q

He is taking the

public goes out and buys.

Now, the pirate, as you call him, is obligated to

pay the artist, isn't he, two cents for use?
MR. SCHACTER:

No.

The pirate only pays, if he does,

and I underline -Q

I am talking about his obligation.
MR. SCHACTER:

His obligation prior to 1972 was to

pay two cents for each cut or side or composition.
the words and music.

That means

He pays nothing to the massive investment

that was taken to produce this record.
Q

So, the answer to my question is yes?

He doesn't

pay the artist?
MR. SCHACTER:
Q

No.

The composer?
MR. SCHACTER:

The composer, yes, Your Honor.

The artist is the one who, shall we say, singe or
plays the instruments.
Q

Well, it is the whole orchestration.
MR. SCHACTER:

Q

Whole orchestration, right.

Composer is wbat I meant.
MR. SCHACTER:

Composer, correct.

25
Under the 1909 Act, and a little more teeth were
given to it on February J.5th, the composer has always had
protection.

But we are talking about all these individuals,

and the companies and the unions, who have made the performance
who have no protection, except only the State common law rights.
And what we have to look forward to is not so much
what was applied but what was the end result.

Are we going to

say there was a complete forfeiture of everything or is there
some protection?

In other words, the equitable reasoning

behind it. \t.

I suppose there is another added factor that usually

these -- to take your term — pirates do not make a copy of
a recording until it gets into the top ten, or something of
that kind.

They wait until all the efforts of the originator

have produced a good result.
But what would prevent them, if anything, from
crossing the line and going over to Nevada or some place and
setting up a copying process if Nevada doesn't have a statute
like this?
MR. SCHACTER:

Well, the second part of the California

statute states that it is also a crime in California to sell
these bootleg performances without the consent of the owner.
Q

So, they couldn't be sold in California?
MR. SCHACTER:

q

They couldn't be sold in California,

Could they be sold in the forty States that don't have

26
such statutes ?
MR. SCHACTER:

I think in the forty States that do

not have such statutes, depending on how this Court decides
what protection will be afforded to these performers prior to
February 15, 1972.
Those States could probably use unfair competition
or some civil litigation.
It is the end result more than the scheme that leads
up to it that is important.
Are we going to allow this taking witouttany retri­
bution?
Q

Is California's base unfair competition or patent

or copyright?
MR. SCHACTER:
Q

You mean the basis of this statute?

Yes.
MR. SCHACTER:

Your Honor, this comes under common law

copyright, which means that the performance is not dedicated.
In other words, when we tell the record — and we, meaning the
people that are in the State of California — there is

not a

dedication because the record is being sold just to play.

That

is the reason.
Q

But you listed among the things that they went to

all this trouble pressing the records, and all.
copyright.

Is it?

That's not

Copyright the pressing of a record?

MR. SCHACTER:

Well, we are talking about what leads

27
up to the record itself.
Presently, under the new act, there is protection.
Q

Are you protecting the artist?
MR. SCHACTER:

We are protecting the artist, the

performer and the unions.
Q

And who else?
MR, SCHACTER:

All the people that are paid monies

from the sale of a record.
.

Q

Well, that would include the man that pressed the

record.
MR. SCHACTER:

Well, the record company pays him

money, yes.
Q

And the promoter?
MR. SCHACTER:

Q

The promoter in New York.
MR. SCHACTER:

Q

And the promoter.

Well —

And the other 49 States.

Are you protecting them

too?
MR. SCHACTER:

We are protecting them in the sense

that in the State of California —
Q

i am just wondering if you are putting too much load

on your horse?
MR. SCHACTER:

Well, in essence, what it is is we

have a property right, the same as
this watch.

I

have a property right

How, until Congress comes out and tells me that 1
don't have a right any more on my watch, this is mine forever.
And when I have purchased it from a store, the money that I
paid to that store is eventually going to go back to the man
that, perhaps, sat at the small table and worked at that wheel.
Q

If I make a direct copy of that watch, there is

nothing you can do about it, can you?
MR. SCHACTER:
Q

Well, the —

The only person that can do anything about it is the

man who made the watch, and here it would be the composer*
MR. SCHACTER:
Q

Ho, Your Honor, because

Want to start on something else?
MR. SCHACTER: I don't agree with that and for this

reason.

I had some fastas tic machine and I brought this watch out and
another watch came out literally exact.

That's the unique

thing because —
Q

I would think then you could get a patent on that.
(laughter)
MR. SCHACTER:

The problem is, first, the difference

between copyright and patent, and the idea of unfair competi­
tion.
In the essence of what we call a bootleg tape, we have

just talking about the performer.
in competition with himself*

We are

We have put the performer

There is nothing more unfair

than that*
What’s worse, he is in competition with himself and
he doesn’t get anything for it*
Q

That is the great inequity*

What happens to the performer when he gets paid for

singing and doesn’t get paid a royalty?
MR. SCHACTER:

Well, in the make he draws some, yes.

But there is a protection there also because we have the, let
us say, the lead singer in an album.

He obtains money for the

making of the album,
Now, the other monies that he will obtain depend on
the sale of that album.
You also have the working man, the working musician,
the working vocalist.

You don’t see his name anywhere.

His

money comes first from the money that the record company has to
pay into the pension funds.

But, second, his money comes to

him after the sale of the record.
Q

Well, aren’t there some places where you take the

record to put music, and you get the artist and you rent a
band,and you go in a place and they make a master record, and
you pay one price for that and if you sell 80 million records
they don’t get anything more.

Am I right?

30

MR. SCHACTER:
Q

That's right.

You can do that also.

Why is it protecting them?
MR. SCHACTER:

That would be an individual.

Only

in (inaudible) circumstances.
Excuse me. Let me correct myself.

I don’t think I’d

be correct.
Q

If it happens to be Frank Sinatra, he gets such a

high price for that one performance that that covers him for
the future.

But if he is an unknown person, he just gets the

union rate.
MR. SCHACTER:

That’s correct.

Absolutely, Your

Honor.
But even more so, there is one inequity that perhaps
we should point out.

There is a book written on how to make

money in the music industry, and they talk about three companies
A&M Records that started off with $200 in a garage, Motown
Records, which started out in the ghetto of Detroit, and Dot
Records, which started off in Tennessee.
All of these people started off with limited funds.
All they had to go on was their talent.
How, their companies went up only because after
great time put out and after many failures they were able to
get that one hit, and that one hit was enough to bring in
enough monies to make other hits.
But what if, upon the making of that one hit, somebody

31
prunes off all of the profit, all the money?

That man could

never survive because people only will make performances, or
anything else, to make money»

And if you take away the commerce,

we are going to be culturally deprived.
And I say that for this reason.

The present Federal

So if this Court declared

unconstitutional, and, of course, there was no pro­

tection at all under Federal protection prior to 1972.
Q

It is clear that prior to *72 there was no Federal

protection for the recorder.
MR, SCHACTER:
Q

For the performance,

For the performance.

And why not? Because the courts

have ruled it just wasn’t covered by the Copyright Act?
MR. SCHACTER:
the history.

:

No, it came this way, going back into

Over a period of years, perhaps from the 1930’s,

a means had been made to revise the complete Copyright Act.
Q

Had been made or suggested?
MR. SCHACTER:

Had been suggested, I am sorry.

Within these attempted revisions were protections
for the performances, but the revisions were struck down in toto
and so were these protections, and that's why —
Q

Under the original Copyright Act, the courts had

decided that no protection was intended, is that it?

Or was

it perfectly clear under the original Copyright Act that this
kind of protection was not to be had?

32
MR, SCHACTER:

I think it was more, as we stated on

the briefs, not needed at that time because the proprietors -Q

Maybe not needed, but I suppose there was a claim

made sooner or later under the original Copyright Act on behalf
of the performer,
MR, SCHACTER:
Q

There were attempted claims,

Yes, court proceedings and constructions of the

Copyright Act, or not?
MR. SCHACTER:

No.

The Copyright Act specifically

did not give protection to the performer,
Q

It specifically negated it?
MR. SCHACTER:

wasn’t there.
Q

It just

It just was void.

It just was perfectly clear it wasn’t there,
MR. SCHACTER:

Q

It didn't say negative.

There is a voidness.

Then there were repeated requests to the Congress

that were turned down?
MR. SCHACTER:

Until ’72.
Until *72, because those repeated

requests were part of a complete revision, and when the complete
revision fell down, that fell down.
This was not a problem, realistically speaking, until
the 1960’s when it became so cheap to buy tape appropriating
material.

Very easy to take a tape and make another one,

another duplicate original.
As was said in the House report, this was not an

33
experiment when they gave this protection.

This was the first

time that piecemeal legislation was put forward and it was
done so because they said, and I am quoting, "lie are persuaded
that the problem is an immediate and urgent one and the
legislation to deal with it is needed now."
The other terminology was overdue.
Q

I thought it might be relevant to ask whether there

had been some knowing deliberate Federal decision prior to '72
not to extend this kind of protection.
MR, SCHACTER:
Q

No, there was not.

Isn't that the basis of your argument, that there is

no Federal preemption of this particular segment?
MR. SCHACTER:

Correct, Your Honor,

There is no

Federal preemption.
Q

I know, but the argument based on Sears and Compco

is that by not having it, by not having the protection, was
equivalent to a Federal decision not to have it.
MR. SCHACTER:

If I may comment on that, Your Honor,

it is that in Sears and Compco there was a specific way to
obtain the protection.
In other words, you either had a patent protection
for mechanical or design right or you didn't.
We don't have that in the copyright, because there
was no way to even bring something forward under the Patent or
Copyright Act for musical performances.

34

Q

Arguably the Copyright Act should be let stand, that

as long as there is protection for the composer that's enough
in this whole scheme of things?
MR. SCHACTER:

Absolutely not, because it would

declare a complete forfeiture of all the performances that have
been made prior to 1972.
Q

There is nothing in the Federal Act to protect the

performer.

That was a void, and the void was filled.

you mean filled by State laws.
MR. SCHACTER:

Now,

Is that it?

No, the void was filled in 1972 by

the Federal —
Q

Yes, but I was speaking of before '72.
MR. SCHACTER:

by common law rights,

Okay.

Before '72,the void was filled

the common law rights saying that the

sale of a record would not cause it to be published.
Q

And some State statutes, like California.
MR. SCHACTER;

And some State statutes, like

California, and within the other States the idea of unfair
competition.
As I said, it only became a problem after it became
easily acceptable to take these products and put them on the
market.
So, what must be brought before this Court is that
we cannot make a supposition as to what is going to happen in
1975, because the present Federal protection lapses then.

And

35
if it lapses, no one is going to make the performance, no one
is going to make a record if they believe as soon as they might
obtain any type of profit from it it is going to be taken away
from them.
And that would be a great cultural detriment to this
country.
The pirates give nothing.
Q

They only take.

What's your position on pre-1972 recordings in light

of the Federal Act's limitation to 28 years?
MR. SCHACTER:

The unlimited times doctrine?

Congress has the power, under the Copyright Act,
and it states, as this Court is well aware, "Congress shall..."
It has always been presumed that a record or
recording is a writing, but it is not until Congress affirma­
tively acts and uses that power to take something and place
it under its wing that that power comes into existence.
And so, it is no different than my analogy to my
watch.
Q

You say the pre-'72 common law copyrights are

perpetual even though post-'72 recordings are protected only
for 28 years.
MR. SCHACTER;

Yes, Your Honor, because until

Congress has affirmatively acted we cannot consider what
something would be in a void.
No one can argue that the pirate is socially or

36
economically beneficial to society.

In fact, the reports of

both the Senate and the House, the Assistant Registrar of
Copyrights, the Attorney General, the Commerce Department,
the State Department, the courts throughout the country, and
the State legislatures, all say that piracy is economically
harmful.
And, again, I refer both to the House and the
Senate reports, where they state that this is -- and the word
that they use -- this is legislation that is long overdue.
There is a substantial interest of the State of
California under its police power to promote the general
prosperity,, To protect the general prosperity, the State must
legislate to protect legitimate business from those who would
destroy that business.
Now, as stated in our brief, and is set out, from
1850, California had a general theft statute, a general
larceny statute, but as businesses came into the State, it
was necessary to refine those statutes to give those specific
businesses protection from those who would prey upon it.
One example is that in 1939 California enacted a
felony statute for deciduous

fruits, avocados.

The reason was

that in the 30's if someone went up and drove along the road,
came into an avocado patch, picked a couple of avocados, no one
cared.
But when avocados went on the open market for 50 to

37
75 cents a piece, and in the middle of the night a man with a
truckload of men and three or four trucks would wipe out a
complete grove, it was necessary for California to enact
specific legislation to protect its businesses, to protect its
businesses, tne people that work in it, and the commerce that
is derived.

does not create a monopoly.

small record companies.

There are many

I have told you of A&M»

Anyone can use the words and musics.

Anyone can use

the idea and expression and make a record themselves, if they
wish to put out the capital investment, that sounds just like
another record,
Q

What about the taping of one of these artists at

a public performance?

Would 653 prevent the selling of things

made from that tape?
MR. SCHACTER:

On the public performance, 1 think

we could go specifically back to the common law copyright,
because under Ferris v. Frohman a public performance does not
dedicate the artistes right.
Q

Doesn't ASCAP take care of that?
MR. SCHACTER:

ASCAP, under separate, perhaps

contractual, relations, they could, but we are talking about
here a public performance.
653h only deals with a record, in other words,

38
from that point —
Q

So, if I tape a public performance of one of these

artists and then sell prints that I make off the tape, I don't
violate 653h.
MR. SCHACTER:

Mot 653h.

You would be violating,

probably, under unfair competition and other contractual rights,
Q

Mr. Schacter.
MR. SCHACTER:

Q
if any.

Yes, Your Honor.

To get back to the common law and the civil remedies,
Could an injunction be obtained against the piracy you

are talking about by the parties whose interests are affected,
by the performer, for example?
MR. SCHACTER:

Well, the performer usually contracts

away his rights, practically speaking, to the record company.
Q

Could the record company enjoin the piracy —
MR. SCHACTER:

The record company, as was in Capitol

Records v. Erickson in California, did bring injunctive pro­
cedures.

This is where there is both civil and criminal

remedies.
The realistic fact is though that the injunctive
procedures did not prove to be adequate because an injunction
could be obtained against the individual, that would be the
producer.
The producer then could move out of the jurisdiction,
keep sending his tapes into the State, and then we would be left

39

trying to find the seller because our injunction would be no
good.

We would have a different party.

And our injunction

could not cover someone that went out of the jurisdiction.
That’s why it is necessary to have 653h to prevent
the selling, not only the appropriation but also the selling.
Piracy is also anti-competitive.

It would force out

the small companies that have to subsist on one hit, because
these companies live off the hits that were made in the past
to bring in monies to make new hits.
Only a very small percentage of records that are
made are hits, and the pirate only takes the hits.
It should be remembered that no business could live
or can live if their complete inventory is wiped out, is
made valueless.

Because how can you compete against someone

that puts out the identical and original performance and yet
charges less than one-third of what it cost you to purchase it
wholesale ?
Only the stronger would survive if 653h were struck
down, because the record companies would be forced to go into
piracy and the record companies, the big record companies,
like Columbia, RCA and Capitol, who own their own pressing
plants, their own tape plants, could even out-pirate the
pirates, because they could put the product out cheaper.
Q

Do you agree that after 1972 that the only way to

get protection as long as the Federal Act lasts is to seek

40
Federal protection?
MR. SCHACTER:

I believe that there are two views,

that there can be concurrent -Q

What's your view?
MR. SCHACTER:

My view?

My view is that if — there

has been mechanics set up, the record companies would be best
to afford themselves of Federal protection.
Q

It would be best, I know, but can 653h be enforced?
MR. SCHACTER:

There is a severability clause in

653h —
Q

HOp can it as to incidents after 1972?
MR. SCHACTER:

I would say no.

I would say that there is a preemption there.
Q

And at the end of 28 years, if you seek Federal

protection on a recording after ’72 — that if you want
protection you say the only place to get it is under the Federal
law?

You seek that protection.

You get it.

It expires.

And then at the end of 28 years, is it public domain or then
may the State law give it protection?
MR. SCHACTER:

Ho, it would become public domain,

because in that specific situation, Congress has then decided,
has affirmatively used the power to go into the field.
What we are talking about here is where Congress
never went into the field, and so the States must give pro­
tection until Congress affirmatively acts.

41
I see that I am running close to the end of my time*
I would only state briefly that there was no Federal
preemption before February 15, 1972, either expressed or
implied,
There has always been State law protection for
unpublished writings.

Section 2 of the Copyright Act expressly

encodifies this, which is different than the patent.
This Court recognized the State protection in the
Sears case in Footnote 7, and we are different from patents
because there are specifically no State protections under
patents.
Published has always had two definitions, dual, both
State and Federal,

The Federal law determines what will

invest Federal copyright protection.

The State law determines

what is unpublished, and decides what publication is necessary
to divest protection.
In each instance, the courts will construe the
facts, and if possible to prevent forfeiture«because what we
are speaking here more than anything else if we strike down
653h and the underlying reasons behind it, will we declare all
the right8 and investments to all the performances that were
made prior to 1972 complete forfeitures?
That is the essence of the case.
The pirates are a parasite upon an industry.

If

they are allowed to exist, like any parasite upon a host, they

42
will destroy the host.
Q

The public will suffer.

If we were arguing a purely equitable case, those

arg»4raents would be very persuasive, at least with me, but we
are arguing a statutory and a constitutional case, aren't we?
MR. SCHACTER:

Yes, Your Honor, and those reasons,

I

believe that under Article 1, Section 8, Clause 8, until
Congress affirmatively uses that power, that the material is
not considered under that power because there is a void.
Once the power has been exercised, once Congress has
gone into the field, then it exists. But before that, we must
leave it to the State and even Congress has so stated in
Section 2 of the Copyright Act, in reference to unpublished
works c
If it Is unpublished works, the State declares if
It is an unpublished work because it says unpublished and
common law.

There is no Federal common law, so we must

presume it is to the State.
Q

I don't recall your — the opposition that you filed

to the petition for certiorari, but did you raise that point in
your opposition, that we should stay away from this problem
until experience had accumulated under the *72 Act?
MR. SCHACTER:

I don't believe so, Your Honor* I

think that the question itself, all over the United States,
X might say, courts and people are waiting to determine what
is going to be those protections.

43
And I can only say, yes, It is an equitable argument
because the equities in this case are great.
Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Leeds, you have a

few minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ARTHUR LEEDS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. LEEDS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I would first like to say that I concur that 653h
has nothing to do with the taping of a public performance.
And that is important to remember because we are
talking about something where the copyist attempts to copy
something which has been, we contend, dedicated to the public
domain.
That is important.

It was commercially exploited

fully and I think that's where we differ so completely.
We have to remember that we are talking about something
which is constitutionally the subject of copyright.
a watch.

It is not a wrlstwatch.

It is not

It is something which is

a writing within the definition of the Constitution.
I would point out that going way back to 1930 or
*52, I believe, when New York first attempted to pass a
statute such as the California statute is now, and it was
vetoed by Governor Dewey because Governor Dewey felt

that

44
this was something that should be left to the Congress, and he
so stated in his veto message.
That is exactly what we have here.

Me have a

situation where we are concerned basically with the question
of the balance of rights between the State and the Federal
Government under the Copyright Clause.
As has been pointed out, Sears and Compco quite
clearly state, both those cases, that when the matter is not
covered by copyright or patents and is exploited commercially,
it falls into the public domain and may be used by anyone.
Sound recordings — I take issue with learned
counsel — that sound recordings are not unique.

They are in

no way different than a photograph or a painting, because if
you want

to make a copy of a painting, the best

way to doit is to make a photograph of it.

If

and clearest
you want to

make a copy of a pole lamp, the best and clearest way to make
a copy of a pole lamp is to make a plaster of paris mold.
If you want to make a copy of a book,

the best and

clearest way to make a copy of that book is to make a photographic
offset printing.
Now, it has also been suggested -Q

Not quite as freely, can you?
MR. LEEDS:

Yes, you can, Your Honor, if the book

is not copyrighted.
Q

Well, if it is not copyrighted, yes.

45

MR. LEEDS:

Exactly, Your Honor, and these sound

recordings are not copyrighted.

That is exactly our point.

That was the point of this Court, I believe, in
Sears and Compco, the pole lamps were not patented or
copyrighted.

Therefore, they could be copied.

The Rembrandt is not copyrighted, therefore, it can
be copied.
This Court relied heavily on Learned Hand's decision
in G. Ricordi v. Haendler and its decision — this Court's
decision in Sears and Cozapco«
Q

But you can copy the Rembrandt only with the

permission of the owner, isn't that right?
MR. LEEDS:

Q

Ho, Your Honor, I —

Can you go down and take a photograph of something

in the National Gallery of Art, except by their leave?
MR. LEEDS:

is driving at.

I think I now see the point Your Honor

You are saying, you are talking about the owner

of the physical Rembrandt as opposed to the rights which —
the incorporial rights which deal with the copy.
Q

The National Gallery could charge if they wanted to

$100 for every person taking a photograph, or $1.
MR. LEEDS:

They absolutely could, and that's

exactly what the sound recording industry does.

It sells you

its recording for $5.
If the National Gallery wanted to sell me the

46
Rembrandt for $100,000, surely I would have the right to make
photographs of it,
Q

In selling it, is there any way they could put a

limitation on copying It?
MR. LEEDS;

That was attempted. Your Honor, in RCA

Victor v. Whiteman, I believe, dealt with that, another Learned
Hand decision where the sound recording industry attempted to
put on a restricted covenant, and Learned Hand pointed out that
you simply can't do that, you could not put such a restrictive
covenant, and struck it down.
To be quite frank, the matter hasn't been raised, to
my knowledge since then, but my belief is that probably,for
the reasons expressed by Learned Hand, could not be done.
The fact we try to emphasize here is that the States
have gone further than Congress can go.

Even Congress cannot

grant protection for unlimited times.
The Constitutional clause is quite clear.

It says

that to promote the progress of science and useful arts by
securing for limited times to authors and inventors the
exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.
Congress has been given the job of balancing when and
for how much and for how long protection should be granted to
any specific Item which falls within the constitutional
definition of a writing.

They have chosen in some areas to

grant 7 years protection; in other areas they have chosen to

47
grant 28 years protection.
In all those areas, they have always said that it
is dedicated to the public good.

I would only point out that it is for Congress fco
make this decision.

If Congress hasn't decided to grant the

copyright protection, the States cannot grant longer pro­
tection.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:47 o'clock, a.m., the oral
arguments in the above-entitled case were concluded.)
