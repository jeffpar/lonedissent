MR* CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear argumenta

next.' in Swenson against Stidhams, 71-224.
Mr, Homines.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH M. HOMINES, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. HOMINESs

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case is a habeas corpus case which originated
in the Western District of Missouri.

It involves a question

concerning Jackson vs. Denno and Simma vs* Georgia.
In 1955 Mr. Stidham was convicted for the first
degree murder of another inmate in a prison riot at the
Missouri State Penitentiary.

The original conviction was

affirmed by the Missouri Supreme Court in 1957.
Mr. Stidham filed for collateral review pursuant
to Missouri Supreme Court Rule 27.26.

That was likewise

affirmed.
Then a second collateral review in 1967 was sought,
denied by the Circuit Court of Butler County, Missouri.

‘Hie

Missouri Supreme Court reversed and remanded for an
evidentiary hearing, and reinstated Mr. Stidham's direct
appeal in the spirit of Swenson vs. 3osier, which required
counsel on appeal.

They affirmed.

In 1970, Mr. Stidham sought habeas to the Western

4
District of Missouri through Judge Co 11 in son..
dismissed on five separate grounds.

Judge Collinson

It was appealed.

The appeal was dismissed by Mr. Stidham.

He

tried to reinstate the appeal and the court did not allow
the re ins tatemesii.
He filed a second habeas corpus petition before
Judge CoHinson.

Judge Collinson, relying upon the former

opinion , denied it, and also denied a new issue involving
Coleman vs. Alabama.
Of the five issues that then went to the Eighth
Circuite four war© affirmed.

One? the Jackson v. D,

issue,

was found, by a two to one vote,, to be — the Eighth Circuit
held that their review of Missouri case law demonstrated
that the Missouri trial court had frequently used the right
to submit the question of voluntariness to the jury without
a prior determination independently by the judge of volun­
tariness »
In essence^ I feel that the Eighth Circuit
clearlv has held that the Missouri rule was the same as the
<•

Hew York rule.
Under Jackson, which was struck down, the judge
could not exclude a confession if there were circumstances
which indicated testimony on both sides.

He was not

entitled to exclude a confession merely because he, himself,
would have found it involuntary.

In essence, he was without

s
the judicial power to resolve the conflicting evidence on
voluntariness.
This Court held that the defendant had a. right at
some point to a hearing and a determination on the issue of
voluntariness.

And the court expressed the opinion that to

give the jury the dual function of deciding voluntariness
and the factual history did not give the defendant the
constitutional determination that he was due.
Now', because of the way the Eighth Circuit read
the Missouri procedure? we have deal
cases? beginning from 1829? when we became a State, Hector
(£ Slave) vs. The State?

all the way through up to the most

recant cases.
0

Basically? I think? distilling those cases indicates
that that Missouri procedure contemplated a preliminary
hearing outside -the presence of the jury.

That at that

hearing the State had the burden of non“persuasion*

After

that hearing the court could weigh the evidence and find
the confession involuntary and refuse to let it go to the
jury.
Or the court could find the confession competent
evidence and instruct the jury on their duty to find that
the confession was voluntary? and instruct on their duty
to find that if they thought if was voluntary they then had
the second determination to make? vfether they thought it was

6
true and they believed it.
Now, the Eighth Circuit Court's rather definitely,
I believe, with the use cf elipses from three different cases
in Missouri as their basic'reasons for saying the Missouri
procedure was bade — one of those cases is State vs. Bracforo,
At the part in the opinion just buffora the ?u •
what is admittedly equivocal language. ? and it’s pretty diffici
to determine exactly what the procedure is, the Hitsouri
Supreme, Court said this:
a court is not obliged to submit the issue of
voluntariness of a confession to a jury merely because there
is substantial evidence tending to show the confession was
voluntary however much the evidence of its voluntary character
is outweighed by the evidence to the contrary.M
Now, that portion follows some equivocal language
which the Court sets put, which indicates that:

But the

batter rule is that if there is a real close question, let’s
let it go to the jury.
Now, the question is: What does it mean?
answer is:

It's pretty hard to tell.

And my

I don’t believe it

means exactly what 'the Eighth Circuit said,

I don’t believe

that is tli© exact way the New York procedure worked.
And the other case that leads me to that conclusion
/

is State vs, Gib11terra, which they also quote.
there says that:

The Gout

it is not the law that if there be any

?
substantial evidence indicating the confession was voluntary#
the court must — and the emphasis in our brief is, the
Court’s emphasis — must refer the question to the jury
however much it may bs outweighed by evidence to the contrary»
If that were true the Court would be doing no more
than it always does throughout a trial in ruling on the
admissibility of evidence.

And there would be no used of

such preliminary hearings, except in the rare instances when
such evidence is wholly lacking.
Now, here is where the equivocation starts, as it
happened in the last cases

"On the other hand, whan there is

substantial conflicting evidence and the question is close,
it is better to refer the underlying issue of voluntariness
to the jury than to exclude the confession.'5

Then they go

on with some language about miscarriage of justice if this is
not clone.
QUESTIONs

Is the basic issue in this case, the

basic questions What was the law of Missouri in 1955 with
respect to procedure in handling alleged coerced confessions?
MR. HOMINESs

No, sir*

To the extent that that might

be the conclusion to be drawn from ray question as presented,
I don’t believe that’s it.

I go one step further and say

that no matter what the law in Missouri might have been in
.1955, that we have to determine what this judge did on the
facts before him

8
That's where I think the Eighth Circuit made the
mistake.

Because if the Eighth Circuit was correct, had the

judge,- on the record, said:

I

'

confession was voluntary as a matter of law.

If the Eighth

Circuit was correct, no matter; that would not have been a
proper finding.
QUESTION: Even though, as you suggest, the judge
vary clearly had complied in 1955 with what the — with
Jackson v.» Pernio, decided many years later, you say that the
Eighth Circuit would have said:

Well, that doesn’t make any

difference, because the law of Missouri didn’t require it to
do-that?
MR. HOMINES:

Right.

QUESTION: Well, Mr, Rimines, isn’t it also perhaps
equally a fundamental issue in the case of the proper
application of this Court’s holding in Jackson v. Denno, to
whatever in fact happened in the Missouri trial court?
MR, RQMINES:
QUESTIONs

Yes, sir, that’s what I —

That, you say, is the basic issue.

MR. HOMINES %

That’s what I tried to indicate.

That, I .believe is the basic issue, not necessarily so much
what the Missouri procedure may or may not have been.

2

mean that might be a nice intellectual inquiry, but, frankly,
I’m concerned in -this particular case that we hold, or that
the Court holds that the procedure that this judge used, the

9
words this judge used, after the inquiry that was made, war
sufficient under Jackson vs, Denno*
QUESTION:

Because at that preliminary >— that

inquiry, what you say is an interesting intellectual
inquiry, to what was the law of Missouri in 1955, showed, I
suppose you would agree, normally in our judicial process
be left for the determination by the United States Court of
Appeals for the Eighth Circuit?
MR. HOMINES;

I think that's correct.

QUESTION; We're not in business here to decide what
the State law is, or was.,
MR, HOMINES;

No, and in a particular case where

the law is, perhaps, unclear as the court indicates, at
least two members of the court indicated they thought this
was.

Perhaps that is a proper inquiry.
But X think on the particular reason that we're

her© today that that's not the proper inquiry.
Basically, I guess the most charitable thing,
perhaps the worst thing that could be said for all these
Missouri cases is a basic general rule cannot be established.
The early cases, up to about 1930 clearly indicate the
judge made the decision.

There's some equivocation in some

of the cases after that, and I think — especially if you
read State vs.. Lasfcer, you find a case where the attorney
ccm.es in and he will not put on any evidence.

And so there

10

up crops what’s called a prima facie rule, which that puts
languages in the cases that at the next time the judge uses
— I don’t think in the correct factual circumstances *
In this case Mr. Hennelly, who is a vigorous trial lawyer,
as I believe the transcript will indicate, requested of the
judge a second judge, coming in from another circuit.

The

case was being heard on the change of venue, of, I would say,
approximately 250-300 miles away from the State Penitentiary,
the comity that it’s in.

He requested testimony on the

That

confession, a hearing outside the presence of the jury*
was given.
Now, the language we’ve specifically set out in
the brief.

The first time that one of the officers gets up to
testify about the confession, Mr. Hennelly indicatess

At

this point, Your Honor please, the defendant moves the court
to conduct a preliminary hearing and asks the court to
inquire into the voluntariness of the statement and to
determine whether the statement was given voluntarily,
either the oral or the written statement? and we ask that
the hearing be had outside the hearing of the jury.
That was don®.
pages of the transcript.
defendant testified.

Evidence that was taken covers 80-05
All the officers testified.

The

And at the end of that, Mr. Hennelly

indicatess That is all.

That is defendant’s motion.

11
Then the court's language, which is perhaps what
ashsaused the confusion., is;

Now, at the conclusion of the

hearing outside of the hearing of the jury, the request by
the defendant for a hearing upon the statement which has been
identified as 16161, it is the court's opinion that the matters
c oncoming the statement should be offered in the presence of
•the jury.

Subject, of course, to any attacks as to its

credibility by the defendant.

The defendant has, of course,

the right to proceed to challenge the voluntariness of the
statement and confession even before the jury.
But it is the court’s opinion that upon the evidence
that has been offered before the court and. outside the hearing
of the jury, that the statement is and should be admissible.
Then he follows with some other non-appropriate
language.
Hr. Hennelly immediately jumps up and says2

In

other words, the court is overruling my motion, and requests
■the court to hold, as a matter of law, these statements were
involuntary.

Is that right?

"The Courts

That is right,"

And brings them back

in*
Now, of course, if you accept what the Eighth
Circuit says the law was, it can be read two ways.

The one

way, the way that wa say it should be read; the other way,
the way that Mr. Hennelly says it should be read, to the

12
extent thats

Okay? he*s equivocating.

If he was trying to.

make the decision of, well» is there enough evidence here»
that maybe I ought not to rule, it goes.
I think it’s clear from the judge's actions here
that he is saying» ”1 don't believe a word Stidham is saying.”
He has decided credibility.
in Jackson.

That's what we*

Has this matt ever had the credibility of his

voluntariness decided before the jury gets it, and that mined
nature of trying to decide whether it's truthful and Whe1
it happened,
QUESTION: Could I ask a question, please?
MR. HOMINES: Surely.
QUESTIONs

Let’s assume that Jackson was violated

or wasn't followed, or that the procedure that Jackson thinks
the trial judge

should follow wasn't followed at the trial,

the criminal trial.

The defendant then is not entitled to a

new trial, necessarily, but just to a hearing on the
voluntariness of his confession, isn't that true?
MR. HOMINES:
QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.

Now, after he was convicted he was given

another full hearing in the STate courts, was he not?
MR. HOMINES:

That’s true.

QUESTION: And there were no new witnesses called
or anything, I take it.
MR. HOMINES:

No, there was some changing of

13
testimony# but —

,

QUESTION: Change of testimony but there- was full
opportunity for a hearing# and the «—
MR. HOMINES:
QUESTION:

That's true.

— same *—

MR. HOMINES:
QUESTION:

Counsel.

For all intents and purposes 1U

was submitted on practically the same evidence.
MR, HOMINES:
QUESTION:

True.

Is that right?

MR. HOMINES: That's true. Your Honor.
QUESTION: And the State trial judge that ’was
conducting that collateral hearing denied relief,
MR. HOMINES: That's true.
QUESTION:

Now, if that were a determination that

the confession was voluntary, it really wouldn’t make any

.

difference what the procedure was at the trial, would it?
MR. HOMINES:

No# it wouldn’t.

The only trouble,

Your Honor, is with what the judge said — we're again
hung up in semantics.

The judge did not say:

I view the

evidence, I find it voluntary.
He said:

I view the evidence.

The judge in 1955

found it voluntary, as he should have.
So it is not just
QUESTION s But he went on and said there was plenty

14
of evidence to support that?
MR. HOMINES:
QUESTION:

Right.

He did.

Well, if he thought the judge determined

it voluntary, said there was plenty of evidence to support it,
do you think- that’s a determination of voluntary?
mr0

that.

HOMINES:

I think it certainly•is.

And we argued

We also have argued that the determination the Supreme

Court made on appeal was sufficient under Jackson.
QUESTION;

Yes.

MR. HOMINES;
QUESTION;

Under the reinstated appeal.

Yes.

Because there the court did say

it was voluntary.
MR. HOMINES: Right,

Judge Collinson said it was

voluntary.
QUESTION: Did the trial judge say it was voluntary,
or did he say it was not involuntary?
MR. HOMINES $

Those words, all of the words in

there are Mr, Rennelly’s words*
;{. .

The judge only rules.
.

does not say voluntary nor not involuntary.
anything.

He says:

He

,f

He doesn’t say

Ifm going to let it go to the jury.

Mr. Hennelly then says:

Are you overruling ray

motion that it is not involuntary as a matter of law?
And he says:

Correct,

Call in the next witness.

So he actually uses none of the phrases, or the
magic ruble as Judge Gibson says, he does not indicata that.

IS
QUESTION s The trial judge could have determined that
as a matter of law it was involuntary, could ho not?
MR, ROMINES:
QUESTION!

He could have.

Then he would not have let it.

MR. HOMINESs

That is correct.

He had that power.

That's how we distinguish it from the New York rule which, as
I read seme of those cases, it seems to indicate that once
there is conflicting evidence he didn't have the power to take
it away from the jury.
QUESTIONs And you say that his words, coupled with
his actions, make it clear that he was ruling that he
regarded the confession as voluntary, subject only to the
jury’s right to reexamine that as to credibility and other
attack?
MR. ROMINESs

Mid probative value, that's correct,

Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Mr. Homines, if the case had come here

on direct appeal, or certiorari from the affirmance on direct
appeal by the Supreme Court of Missouri, and we had
concluded that this colloquy between Mr. Henneily and the
trial judge did not satisfy Pernio, v?e would have sent it
back to the Missouri courts, I suppose, for much the same
type of hearing that Mr. Stidham obtained in his Missouri
habeas proceedings.
MR* HOMINES: That's true

16
2 don't think there's any doubt that the?; Eighth
Circuit recognized» under Sigler vs. Parker» that it had
be a determination that while they sent it back even
Western District. Court» it was only to hold that case until
new proceedings should be instituted in Missouri» which
evidently indicates a third collateral attack proceeding in
Missouri for Mr. Stidham.
Basically» we make the argument that the Supreme
Court on appeal» and particularly the judge in St. Louis»
on the collateral attack hearing» under 27.26» that made a
sufficient determination under Jackson.
In our brief we also indicate that we do not wish
to waive those arguments regarding the retroactivity of 'casos»
although it's pretty difficult to fly in the face of Jackson»
■which apply retroactively tc a habeas case.

We believe that

it should not apply collaterally standards that are not
!
•)

viable at the time the original appellate review of tha
court.
Perhaps» and I've heard that argument made in two
or three other eases in the last couple of days» it's a dog
that won't hunt» but we believe that it should hunt.
It's a problem»

I've handled -- been in the office

three years and I've handled 1475 petitions, responses to
show cause.
QUESTION*

1475 petitions, was that —

MR. ROMINES:
QUESTION!

Responses to show cause, that's right

— to federal habeas?

MR. ROMINES:
I didn't believe it.

In three years.

I went through and ~

The more docket cards I went through,

the more the numbers cams up.
QUESTION: Was that just the Western District?
MR. ROMINES s That takes in the Western and the
i

Eastern District.
Four hundred and eighty-one of those have bean
appealed, 84 have been reversed; and only in one, this case,
have I had a gut reaction.

And it's fairly difficult to tell

exactly what it is, but it's a let of little things, that 2
just think it's something wrong that this can go on, after
this man has had this number of hearings; and 1 think it
should stop.
We also make an argument in the brief —
QUESTION:
MR. ROMINESs
QUESTION:

Where would you ©top it?
I would stop it right here.
You're not denying the function of the

federal habeas?
MR. ROMINES:

No.

I'm not concerned with that.

And I'll try to deal with that in the next part.
The other part of our argument was that this man
h ad an original habeas# it went to the Eighth Circuit# ha
dismissed his appeal# on basically the same issues except for

ia

a Coleman v. Alabama issue? which he brought up later.
But he tried to reinstate his appeal? the Eighth
Circuit said no.

That should have been the end of it for

Mr» Stidham on this issue.
Now? he filed a second habeas corpus in the Western
District.

Judge Collinson denied him relief? basing it on

his prior decision and also denying relief on Coleman vs.
Alabama.

It goes up.

Then the Eighth Circuit? and there

have been other cases involving the same Missouri procedure?
which they've not felt concerned enough to tsll us about ip
the last few years of Jackson v. Denno.

In this case the

two members on that panel decided that the Missouri law was
incorrectly being applied.
QUESTIONs

Did you make the same argument in the

Eighth Circuit?
MR. HOMINES:
Honor.

We did not have oral argument? Your

Went off on the summary docket.
I would like to reserve some time for rebuttal.
QUESTIONS

Am 1 correct that Judge Gibson was the

only Missouri judge on the panel?
MR. HOMINES:
dissented.

Yes? sir? and he was the judge that

His basis being that the Missouri Supreme Court

is the one to judge what the law of Missouri was.

And he

was the only Missouri judge oh that three-man panel.
Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;
ORAL

Mr* Hennelly.

argument of mark m. hennelly, esq.,

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
ME. HENNELLYz

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
I think it is always an emotional thing that we
would like to 6.0 away with as many appeals as possible.
Unfortunately, this is the occupational hazard
has to take with respect to innocence.

And that33 the

situation that Stidham has taken for almost twenty years.
The question is whether or not we're going to say to Mr.
Stidhams

The dockets are too loaded.

If we coerced this

confession out of you., it's most unfortunate, because we’ve
got too much work to do.
And I don't think that that is a proper interpreta­
tion of the — of any of the laws.
QUESTION; Am I correct that this is the seventh time
that this case has been before some court?
MR. HENNELLY;

It’s the seventh time it's been

before type of court. Your Honor.

And, again, 1 say that’s

a result of this man's insistence that he was illegally
convicted.
We would not be here -— we would not be here if
Judge Godfrey, who heard the case when it came back the
second time, if he had done exactly what the court said

20
should have been done.
Let me read what Judge Godfrey did.
says s

As to paragraph (h) concerning the

Judge Godfrey

averment ~-

QOESTION:

What are you reading?

QUESTION s'

Can you give us a citation to the record f

so we can get it?
MR. HENNELLYs

Yes.

This is on page 26 of our

brief? at the Appendix 686.
QUESTION:

Page what?

MR. HENNELLY:

It's on page 26 of our brief.

QUESTIONS All right.
MR. HENNELLYs "As to subparagraph b concerning the
averment that ‘the overwhelming evidence was that the statement
Was involuntary because of coercion exerted on movant9 this
contention was raised and profusely litigated in State vs.
Stidham, and the Court finds it is no longer open to
question here.”
Judge Godfrey made no finding that we asked him
to make.

If h© had, we wouldn't have had to come here,
QUESTION:

Well, didn't he go on in the next

paragraph and say that
MR, HENNELLYs
QUESTION:

Yes,

— it ‘was resolved by the trial court,

in the first instance?
MR, HENNELLY:

Yas, he ~~ well — but he went on

further than that» too, Your Honor.

1811 read the whole

thing that he said;
"It should be noted that the evidence concerning the
issue of voluntariness was greatly confli«ting and was to be
resolved by the trial court in the first instance raid the
jury in the second having regard to the credi ility of the
witnesses.

This issue should now be considered closed —

it should now be considered closed — and this Court finds it
to be so.”
In other words, all that he did was to put a stamp
of approval on what had been illegally done previously.
QUESTION s What year was he speaking in?

That date

isn9t here?
MR. HENNELLY;

It was two years ago. Your Honor.

In other words, we- tried the case the first time in about
1955, and then the sixth appearance was before Judge
Godfrey, and Judge Godfrey clearly did not make the finding
that he should have made as a result of the mandate of his
own Supreme Court.
Now, as we understand O'ackson v. Dsrmo, when a
trial is over a defendant ought to be able to say to himself;
I am satisfied as to the circumstances under which this jury
convicted me with respect to a statement#
And he ought to be able to say;

I am satisfied

that the court, the court, found that it was voluntary.

And he ought to be able, as a result of Slams v„
Georgia, to say that that was found wi'
QUESTIONs

Mr. Hennelly, —

MR. HENNELLY:
QUESTION 3

Yes, sir,

— on the preceding page that you quoted

from, page A685, and I take it this is still the opinion of
the Missouri habeas judge.
it sayss

The last paragraph there, where

"Movant’s contention that the trial court failed to

find specifically that the confession was voluntary this
Court finds is untenable since the Court found specifically
that the confession was not involuntary,"
Now, if a court finds specifically that the
confession is not involuntary, that’s tantamount to finding
it voluntary, isn’t it?
MR. HENNELLY:

No.

No,. Your Honor, all that he

is doing is restating what the court did in the first instance.
All that he is saying is that:

I’ve read the decision and

I see when 1 read the decision that tije court found chat it
was involuntary.
He's not saying that based upon the evidence

• ‘

that was put before me, that I now find that it was involuntary
And if he did, we'd be dead as far as this case is concerned.
But ha didn't do that.
QUESTIONs

But he’s at least characterizing the

finding of the original Missouri trial judge’s finding, that

it was not involuntary#
ME. HEHNELLYs

No, 2 don’t think that he is.

I think that what he is doing is going bade to —
and while 1 realise that an interpretation as to what was the
law in Missouri at the time is only a factor to be considered
as to what was in the mind of the late Judge Weber when he
made this finding, 1 think that all that he is doing is saying
that at that time they lived up to what the law was in
Missouri.
And the fact of the matter is, with respect to the
material that Mr. Routines read, at the time that 1 asked for
the hearing, I asked for a hearing based upon both the oral
and the written confession.

And you will note, if Your Honors

will, that when we got down to the colloquy as to "Are you
finding as a matter of law?", we were talking about the
State's Exhibit 16 and 16-1.

There is no place in this
\

record, there is no court that has ever decided that the oral
statements, which were objected to, and the record saved at
each instance on the oral statements, there is no finding
any place in this record that the oral statements were
voluntary.
Sow, again, with respect to the statement of the
court, and ray statement "you’re not finding as a matter of
law", when I say "you're not finding as a matter of law'5,
I'm saying the law as it existed then.

It is for that

,

24
reason that, it is of some importance»

It * ss the case law that

we've been following in Missouri all the time. And the case
that we had been following in Missouri was chiefly

it was

clearly an opposition to the finding that this Court made in
Jackson y. Denno♦

It was that if the question was close, the

court, didn't have to put a stamp of approval on it, the
court didn’t have to make a positive finding, the court passed
it on. to the jury»
tod, as a matter of fact, at page 703 of the
Appendix, that’s exactly what the Supreme Court said.

When

we originally tried Stidham and he went up to the Supreme
Court for the first time, the Supreme Court saids

"There is

no merit in defendant's contention that his written confession"
■—■ his written confession? they don’t even worry about the
oral statement •— ”we coerced and involuntary and. was
admitted in evidence before the State established that it
had been voluntarily given.

The court conducted a full

preliminary hearing on the issue, found the issue was for the
jury, and later, after hearing evidence before the jury,
submitted the issue to the jury for determination.
testimony was to like effect at each hearing."

The

So on and so

forth.
The last thing it says s

"On the conflicting showing

the issue of the voluntariness of the confession was for the
jury»"

Which is totally inconsistent with what this Court has

held the court should have clone with respect to Jackson v.
Danno, and the Sims case.

The court should have made a

positive unquestioned finding»

And? quite frankly*, if Judge

Godfrey? when the case event back to him# if he would, have
done it? that would have been the end of it, too.
But to this day nobody has made that finding?
except that the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals has strongly
suggested that it was totally involuntary? and that it was
taken, and that if we took the uncontradicted testimony?
that the confession was involuntary and should have been
excluded as a matter of law»

of the Eighth Circuit?

If it had not come here? and if —

if the State had not applied for cert? it would

have gone back for another hearing# to determine the
voluntariness of the statement? and I presume that some other

MR. HENNELLY:

No.

Why wouldn’t it go back for a hearing

before Judge Collinson, or one of the other judges in the
Western District, since presumably the petitioner has

Rehnquist’s question that if in fact Jacksonj, Donne was not

question concerning the voluntariness —

— and if he finds that it was voluntary,

then the conviction remains undisturbed.
MR. HENNELLY:

HR. HENNELLY:

they try it with whatever evidence they have? independent
of the confession.

MR. HENNELLY:
QUESTION:

I gather, then, that — how

Judge Godfrey is a State court?

That's right.

How did they get back to him?

MR, HENNELLY:

It got back to him because the

Supreme Court found, the Missouri Supreme Court found that as
a matter of fact he should have a hearing on a 27.26 motion,
which is our post-conviction device, to determine whether or
not that confession was voluntary? together with some ether
matters.
QUESTION; And your submission is that Judge Godfrey
did not in fact make a finding on the voluntariness?
MR. HENNELLY:
QUESTION:

He did not.

Had he made one, then Jackson v. Dsnno,

you agree, would have been satisfied?
MR. HENNELLY: Would have been satisfied.
’QUESTION: But all he did was go back to — who was
the original judge?
MR. HENNELLY:
QUESTION:

It was Judge Weber.

And what — you point out to us that

at 685 and 686 is Judge Godfrey’s characterisation of what
happened before Judge Weber, is that it?
MR. HENNELLY:

In effect, he says, I cannot, that’s

res adjudicata6s part in this.

29
QUESTIONS

That's what it is.

MR. HENNELLYs
QUESTION?

That's what it is.

And your submission is that that’s the

characterisation of what happened before Judge Weber?
MR. HENNELLYs
QUESTION:

That's right.

Instead of doing as he should have

done, both as the Supsrsrae Court required him to do and to
satisfy Jacks on v. Denno, to make bis own independent determination of voluntariness?
*

MR. HENNELLY:

That's right.

QUESTION: The difficulty is, the Supreme Court told
him to hold a hearing and determine voluntariness?
The judge held a hearing, and he said whatever he
said, and you appealed again. And the Supreme Court of
Missouri found no error in his —*
MR. HENNELLY: That's right.
QUESTION*

— in his activity.‘ Apparently the

Court thought he had complied completely with the prior order.
MR. HENNELLY t That3 s right.
QUESTION:

Well, whether it did or not, whatever

he found didn't entitle anyone with any relief with respect
to the confession.
MR. HENNELLY: Well, Your Honor, —

can’t recall the case, but I understand that one of the

determine the demeanor of- the witnesses, et cetera.

I mean, that would not be of sufficient —
MR. HENNELLY;

I don’t think that would conform

with Jackson v. Dennp because I think that the trial judge,
who has the demeanor of the witnesses and has tha atmosphere
of the case, it is he who has to determine whether or not that
confession is voluntary.

He’s the one that has to do it.

QUESTION; Well, at any rate —

31
QUESTION:

It was the trial judge that did.

MR. HENNELLY:
QUESTION:

I’m sorry.

Wasn't it Judge Weber that did?

settle this would be for him to settle it.

MR.HENNELLY:

No, no, 1' don't.

I say that you could

send it back to another judge who can hear the demeanor ofthe witnesses now.

Just as I say Judge Godfrey could have

done it.
QUESTION:

That is, presuming that after eighteen

years the witnesses still remember all the details.
MR. HENNELLY; Wei, we put -*•* it was just a year and
a half or two years ago that there was a reasonably full
hearing, after eighteen years.'.
But I think that we are losing sight of what is the
main thrust of Stidham's position in this case, and what is
suggested by the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals.

And that

is that this confession should have been thrown out completely.
QUESTION:

All right, now let me go back to this a

minute. The Supreme Court of Missouri, when you appealed after
the second

MR. HENNELLY:

32
QUESTION? The Supreme Court of Missouri said;

And

finally the court found ~~ referring to Judge Godfrey ~~ the
court found — ought to say, Judge Godfrey found, as had the
previous court, that the oral written confessions were
voluntary.
MR. HENNELLY:
QUESTIONi

Yes.

And needless to add, the latter finding

is overwhelmingly supported in procedure and factually, the
cause meets all the requirements in the federal cases.
Now, at least the Supreme Court of. Missouri
disagrees with you as to what Judge Godfrey found.

And, in any

event, it reads it that way and finds it supported by the
evidence.

MR. HENNELLY;

No, 1 don’t.

I don’t.

And, really,

with all due respect, I think that we have got to realise that
Mr. Stidham, as is characterized in this, in the Supreme
Court opinion, is a litigious convict.. And again that
litigiousness is but a byproduct of innocence, perhaps.

Your table of cases would indicate that.

During the last two months, from July 12, 1954, until

been in a cell measuring five feet by seven feet with
furnishings consisting of a wash basin

several occasions.
And I might tell the Court that in the original
trial he told the court that the conditions in that penitenti­

you that your courts will be burdened again, because we will

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OP KENNETH M. HOMINES, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. HOMINES:

I told the Court that he was an

impressive trial lawyer., which he is.
Two things I might mention:

One on exactly what the

Eighth Circuit did with the case.
They sent it back for a hearing in the STate court,
under Sigler vs. Parker.

I'm not sure that was correct,

because they do not indicate what new facts there are to be
determined.

It looks to me like there is sufficient record

on both the original trial and the 27.26, to determine what
all the facts were.

I’m not convinced, as is Mr. Hennelly,

that some judge,, perhaps even this Court under Boulder: vs.
Holman could not just sit and look at the facts.
I think clearly the Supreme Court of Missouri cpuld
i

take that cold record and, under the authority of Boulden vs.
Holman and Jackson itself, say this confession is voluntary.
Now, as to what the Eighth Circuit said concerning
the testimony, I believe, at pages 770 and 771 of the Appendix,
•the court indicates that they are merely indulging themselves
in Procunier vs. Atchley, which says that:

if we were to

believe Mr. Stidham's facts, clearly he would be due some
relief.

They've not said they believe him.
All they've said is that:

for the purposes of

testing whether the five or six allegations he makes, on their

face, would grant him relief if it were true, we will not
apply Proomier, we will send this back, v;e will not say it
was involuntary, and we will also not say that it was voluntary
QUESTION: Well, they did also say, didn't they, that
"we've examined the transcripts and other relevant materials
and found that several of Stidham’s allegations have not been
contradicted in the record”?
MR. HOMINES: Right, they —
QUESTION:

The majority did say that.

MR. HOMINES

'

They requested a letter of me sometime

in early April, specifically referring to the fact that he had
not had anything to eat or drink, and requested transcript
references.

And I sent what I thought were appropriate

transcript references back to them, and also some fairly
explanatory argument as to exactly what they wanted.

They

were concerned about his testimony as to loss of weight.
He testified that

end this is at the 27.2G now —• he testi­

fies that h© lost 25 pounds during a six-day period.
Then he testified that ho was not given anything to
oat.

Other than that, they did not indicate in their letter,

other than those two things, exactly what those other loose
ends are»

And of course, as we indicated in the footnote, you

are going to have loos© ends in every case that's tried, and
certainly it's not the law that you have to present rebuttal
testimony to every allegation a man makes before you can

40
determine credibility,

And that3s all that 1 think is

basically involved there.
Judge Co11inson was able to determine credibility
with these loose ends, as were all the other courts,

QUESTIONS

How long was he in solitary?

MR, HOMINES:

I believe the record indicates he had

been there twenty months, but —
QUESTIONs

Twenty months?

ME. HOMINES: Right.
QUESTION:

For escape.

And is there anything in evidence that

says there weren’t cockroaches in there?
MR. HOMINESs

Ho,

there were no cockroaches.

There is nothing that indicates
I mean, no one was asked the

specific question: Did you see cockroaches?
Stidham volunteers it.
QUESTION: Well, then it's uncontradicted?
MR. HOMINES: Right.
QUESTION: And you have no reason to deny it?
MR. HOMINES:

Oh, if I were bringing it, I think the

first question I would ask somebody, if I could find somebody,
would be that question. But there is nothing in the record
that we have here today that indicates that there were not
cockroaches.

That’s right.

QUESTION: Well, is the rule in Missouri, as it is
elsewhere, that the finder of fact is entitled to disbelieve
an interested witness, without the necessity of contradicting
testimony, if that is the conclusion of the trier of fact
that he’s not telling the truth?
MR. HOMINES:

That is the law

42
Now, the twenty-month period that he was in
maximum security, he was in maximum security for an attempted
escape.

Now, the record indicates twenty months, 1' have not

dona any independent research that indicates anything
different.-

Clearly, he had been done there a sub

period of time.
Where this differs from some of the other cases
involving this, he was not in maximum security looking
