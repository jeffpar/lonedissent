ZIOGEEDIMGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments now

in Wo, 71*6742, Hurtado against the United States.
Mr. Armendariz.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALBERT ARMENDARIZ, SR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR, ARMENDARIZ:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The case that we are going to consider today,
gentlemen, arises out of a right that the United States
Government and, for that matter, State governments have in
securing the services of witnesses in cases in which the Federal
Government and the State are — this involves the Federal
Government only, but in general, the States are — interested
in having, in other words, witnesses for the State, witnesses
for the United States Government.
And, in the process of securing these witnesses,
Congress has passed Rule 36(b) of the Rules of Criminal
Procedure, which authorizes the incarceration of these witnesses
during the pre-trial procedure to guarantee that they will be
there should they not be able to make bond, and that they will
be there to testify during the proceedings Involved,
Then, we have in conjunction with this — and, by
the way, I might say here that there are other ways that a
witness may be detained, such as, an example, the Mafia, or a

4
Mafia witness who the Federal Government fears may be killed,
may be detained.
So, there are other ways of detention other than
through 46(b) .
But, then we have an article which is found in the
law regarding the payment of these witnesses, and this is the
statute which is in question here.
The main issue here, as I see it, is the interpre­
tation of 1821, regarding the payment of witnesses.

This is

the main issue.
The main issue arises because — and if it is
interpreted a certain way then, of course, the constitutional
issues can be reached.

But the main issue arises because we

have a statute which is in three pieces.

It is a tripod.

The statute is in three pieces or three sections.
The first section is that no person shall be held -- excuse me,

I

am reading.

The first section involves the payment of

a

per diem, a per diem to all witnesses.
Now, the second section

involves itself with the

payment of that part of the money that a person, or a witness,
would spend in hotels and eating, or sustenance.
And then, the statute, in its involvement, has a
last section which refers to incarcerated witnesses, and states
that such witnesses will receive $1 a day compensation.
The interpretation of the statute is really the

5
important thing here.
I think we have a very similar case in the way that
the Court should proceed, and that is the Bandridge case, that
is, that the interpretation of the statute is of first con­
sideration because if the interpretation is that it is $20 a
day then we don’t reach the constitutional issues.
Now, it is important, then, to look very carefully at
the words of the statute and to look to the rules of interpre­
tation of statutes.

And this is what we feel has not been done

by the courts below.
First you must look at the fact that the very first
section refers to a per diem.

It calls it a per diem.

Now, this is, of course, a daily payment, and if we
look at the statute itself, and we look at the intention of
Congress in all of these things, we are faced,as lawyers, as
judges, with this situation.
We must recognise that Congress, in its scheme of
things, has provided for payment for services for all court
attaches.
It has provided for payment to each one of you as
judges of the Supreme Court.
It has provided for payment for we lawyers who might
be asked to participate in the defense of a person.
Congress has provided for payment for the bailiffs,
for the janitor of the court.

6
And Congress has provided likewise for the payment
of witnesses $20 per day.
Now, must Congress say that -- in that first section
-- that a per diem shall be paid to witnesses, including those
incarcerated?
This is what the 5th Circuit seems to think, but
that is not the rule of interpretation of statutes.
Look at the second section that we have here,
gentlemen.

The second section excludes salaried employees of

the Government from the $16 payment.
Now, there is rationale there.

The rationale is

that salaried employees of the Government receive money from
the Government to pay their daily expenses, their hotel.
It excludes witnesses in custody.

This is reasonable.

It excludes them from the $16, specifically, because they are
having their room and board paid for in the local pokey.
It excludes witnesses who reside near the court.
This is also reasonable because if you live near the court
you go home and you eat at home and you don't need to pay a
hotel bill.
Now, the second section excludes those that Congress
intended to exclude.
The first section doesn't.

The first section says

all witnesses.
Mow, we come then to, of course, the word, or the

7
term, “attending court.'5
And this is where the 5th Circuit has stated that a
witness in jail is not attending court.
They seem to say — I mean they say — although they
don’t quote a case to' us, that this is a stage of the proceeding.
But we are not dealing with semantics and words.

¥e

are dealing with fairness and equality, and we are dealing with
the interpretation of the statute of Congress in which we should
not attribute to Congress such a disposition to give to one
witness who is free who is in the hotel enjoying himself, $20
a day while he waits and the person who is placed in jail, give
him $1 a day while he waits.
Q

A witness is subpoenaed from the penitentiary, the

Federal penitentiary, in Leavenworth, Kansas, and subpoenaed
down into Texas or Florida and put in detention while he is
waiting.

Does he get $21 a day?
MR. ARMENDARIZ:

already decided.

You are referring to a case which is

I believe we quote it in our brief.

And the

court distinguished — I forget which court it was — but this
has been decided already — but the court distinguished that
case as — and I think rationally so,because this was a person
who was arguing that his right to work within the penitentiary
-- but this is a prisoner who is being held for another reason.
He would be held anyway.

And I think the Government concedes

that in its original brief in opposition to this granting of the

8
writ, where the Government concedes there is very little
reason to differentiate between these people when they are
being held for no other reason than to testify.
And this, I submit, is the situation here.
Q

If your client were actually testifying he would get

$20, wouldn't he?
MR, ARMENDARIZ:

Your Honor, the answer to that is

not in the record.
Q

What's your position as to **MR. ARMENDARIZ:

Our position •*« they were not paid

in any case that we have found -- but this is not in the
record because this case Same up -Q

What's your position?

Is your position that the

statute does not provide for payment to clients such as yours
even for the period when
MR. ARMENDARIZ:

they are actually testifying?
Oh, no, sir.

Our position, of

course, would be, in line with the position of the court below,
that they should get a payment of $20 for the day of the trial
At least for the day of the trial,whether they testify or not.
But it is very interesting to note, and we asked -or we sent -Q

How then is your client treated differently from

other witnesses?
MR. ARMENDARIZ:

He is treated differently in a very,

very substantial way, and that is that in the example that was

9
quoted by one of the other justices.
Let us say he is not in prison.
subpoenaed from here to El Paso, Texas.

All right, you are
You are going to

testify before the 'Western District of Texas.

You get $20

a day from the minute you leave here whether you testify or
not.
Now, you go to El Paso.

You take two days if you

drive, if you fly.
Now, let's suppose the case is set for Monday
morning, which is the case in most of our courts.
And lie gets there and he reports to the District
Attorney and the District Attorney tells him, "Nell, we've got
six cases ahead of you.

We won't need you until Thursday.

Where are you?”
"Well, I'm at motel so and so.”
"Well, you stay there and stick around and we will
call you when we need you.”
He gets $20 a day while waiting in the hotel.

While

the man who is waiting in the jail gets $1.
Q

He is In attendance for purposes of the trial.
MR. ARMENDARIZ:

Well, so is the man in jail, 7*mr

Honor.
I submit to you that he is very much so.
Q

Was there a trial going on?
MR. ARMENDARIZ:

I submit to you, Your Honor, yes, sir.

10
The minute that a complaint is filed against a person
and that man is put in under 46(b), there is a trial stage or
there is a trial going on, and it is the same stage, because
you are in that stage of the game.
Q

You would argue that if there weren't a trial con­

templated the Government would have great difficulty justifying
holding them at all.
MR. ARMENBARI2:

Your Honor, we have -- in our whole

position, we have evaded the issue of procedural due process.
We have limited our position to the fact that given
the right to hold — and it is only in the matters presented
by the defendant — I beg your pardon, by the Government —
that we have reached this particular point.
Of course, we would go into it a little bit more in
rebuttal.

I intend to.
But, specifically, what you have here, of course, is

an interpretation of attending in court.
I agree with you, Mr. Chief Justice, that this is
one of the issues here, but I fail to see how interpretation of
statutes and logic, or anything else, can lead to the conclusion
that a person that is in jail because of a case being initiated
and is in progress is not attending in court, simply because
he is in jail waiting for His Honor to call the case.
Q

Is it correct that if they were not being held in

jail they would be or would have been deported by now?

Is the

11
record silent on that?
MR. ARMENDARIZ: Yes, in this particular case, 1 think
the record will show that there was no reason to hold than other
than as witnesses at this time.
Q

They would have been gone.

If you are going --if we should agree with you that

$20 per day applies as well to the man in jail, what do you do
then with, the

last sentence?

MR. ARMENDARIZ:

To what does that apply?

Your Honor, the Court of Appeals

downstairs, in its decision, stated what we contended at the
time, that this is a recognition by Congress that a man in jail
-- now, mind you, look at the whole statute —
Q

My question is to whom, to what witness, does the last

sentence apply, if we were to agree with you that your man was
entitled to $20 a day.
MR. ARMENDARIZ:

It applies to those persons who are

in custody, who are in jail, in order to provide toiletries
and things that they need while they are in jail.
Notice that the other «witness who is free gets $16.
Asks yourselves, why $16?
Q

Why not $15?

I am afraid I haven’t made myself clear.
If we agree with you that your man was entitled to

$20 a day, and that anyone in the position of your client is
entitled to $20 a day, and read the statute that way, what do
we do with the last sentence?
MR. ARMENDARIZ:

It’s an addendum — it’s called

12
something else.
Q

Applicable to whom?
MR6 ARMEMDARI2:

Q

Applicable to persons in jail.

Rut you would want $21 instead of $20»
MR. ARMEWDARIZ:

Because $20 is the per diem and

$1 is for toiletries and other things that a man needs in jail.
I suggest that the statute suggests also that the
payment be made on a daily basis so that they can have those
-- and it uses the word "per day."
Q

So you relate the $1 to the $16 for the man outside?
MR. ARMENDARIZ:

Yes, sir, and it is reasonable.

This is logical that it is relating to the $16 —
Q

The man outside, unless he is in Government service,

really gets $36 a day, and you feel that since your man is
in prison he ought to at least get $21.
MR. ARMENDARXZ:
Q

$21, yes, sir.

The $15 —

That's what this is all about?
MR. ARMEI'TDARIZ:

This is what this is ail about,yes,

sir.
And I want to reserve whatever rest of the time I
have for rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Solicitor General.

13
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERWIN N. GRISWOLD, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR, GRISWOLD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This is a troublesome case and it is good, X think,
that the problem has been brought to light.
Whether there is anything that this Court can,
properly, or should do about it is not so clear.
In the first place, it seems to me important to
put before the Court what I conceive to

he

the basis of the

jurisdiction of the District Court in this case.
There is in the Appendix the original complaint
beginning on page 4 of the Appendix.

And there is also a

first amended complaint beginning on page 28 of the Appendix.
It isn't wholly clear to me which one is actually the
one upo'

Court acted, but I would assume that the

first amended complaint is the one which is before the Court.
The United States is the sole defendant named in this
complaint.
There is no officer of the United States, no
marshall and no United States attorney and no Cabinet officer;
no one but the United States is named as a defendant.
If you look at the complaint, paragraph 2, it says
that "this suit seeks to enjoin the enforcement of a Federal
statute,11 to wit, Title 28, U.S.C. 1821, and it requests a three*»

14
judge court.
And, then, If you look at paragraph 3, you find that
it is alleged that there is a case of actual controversy, and
there is a reference to the declaratory judgment statute,
Now, I think It is perfectly clear that Congress has
never consented to a suit by citisen or an alien against the
United States to enjoin the United States from anything.,
It may have in some special acts, but it has not in
any statute which is applicable here.
And, similarly, I think that sovereign immunity is
a barrier to a suit for a declaratory judgment against the
United States, unless the case is in some other way brought
within the jurisdiction of the District Court,
When we examine the statutes which relate to the
jurisdiction of the District Court,the only one which can have
any application here —
Q

You say this is a jurisdictional question?
MR. GRISWOLD:

I am just trying to find out what is

the question.
Yes, X say that it is quite clear, it seems to me,
that this cannot be a suit to enjoin the United States because
the United States has not consented to any such suit.
Q

You think that is equivalent to the lack of power in

the District Court.
would be -*

If you had interposed it, I suppose it

15
ME. GRISWOLD:

1 don’t think any officer of the

United States has authority to waive the sovereign immunity —
Q

Congre s s, Congre s s.
MR. GRISWOLD: Congress has power to, and the only

place that 1 know of that Congress has waived its sovereign
innaunity,with respect to suits against the United States, is
Section 1346 of Title 28.

And the first provision of that is

Internal Revenue tax cases.

And the second is the Tucker Act.

The Tucker Act provides that the District Court shall
have jurisdiction in any claim not exceeding $10,000.

And,

incidentally, in order to come in with respect to Federal
question, it would have to exceed $10,000, which is simply
another technical reason why, quite apart from sovereign
immunity, that would not be there.
Q

They allege 4682, which is the one you are reading.

They allege that,specifically, that it should come under that.
MR. GRISWOLD:

Yes, I understand, and I am trying to

narrow it down and say that this case is solely and simply a
case under the Tucker Act, Section 1346(a)(2).
There is Section 1346(b), which is the Federal Court
Claims Act, but this does not purport to be such a suit,
though conceivably someone might contend that there was a
basis for that.
Nor does it purport to be a suit with respect to
Civil Rights Act.

16
So5 1 am suggesting that: this ease can be before the
District Court and can be considered by this Court, not as a
question of enjoining anything.
It is not a question whether if the people are now
in custody they can be held. Conceivably a writ of habeas
corpus might be filed to release someone on the ground that
detention under Section 46(b) without proper compensation
violates scsne provision of the Constitution.
These people are not now in custody.

They have

been released sometime since.
And so this is — and, perhaps, I should not have
taken this much time to bring this out, but I think it is
important.

This case is before the District Court and,

therefore, here only as a suit under the Tucker Act, which
means that it must be not exceeding $10,000 in amount, founded
either upon the Constitution or any act of Congress or any
regulation of an Executive Department, or upon any express or
implied contract with the United States in cases not found
in torte.
Well, now, it obviously is not upon an express or
implied contract, nor does it rest on a regulation of an
Executive Department, so it has to be, in order to allow
recovery, founded either upon the Constitution or any act of
Congress.
Q

Of course, they expressly allege that each claim is

17

based on an act of Congress.
MR. GRISWOLD:

Yes, Mr. Justice, I understand that,

and so that gets us down — there are also a lot of other
things —
Q

I mean in that respect.

Sven on pur argument, that

that's within the Tucker Act,
MR. GRISWOLD:

That is within the Tucker Act, but the

act of Congress is Section 1821.
And, so, we are now confronted with the problem of
construing Section 1821, and my opponent contends that the
proper construction of that is that it provides for a per diesa
of $21 per day to the detained witness.
And, this Court can, of course, make a statute mean
anything it feels it ought to mean, but I find it extraordinar­
ily difficult to find that that is even the literal proper
construction of the statute, or that it is the construction of
the statute which can be supported In terms of its history or
the practice under it.
Before I go further, I think it is not unimportant to
have the facts of this case somewhat more fully before the
Court.
Q

— but his alternative is if you don't construe it

that way, then it is unconstitutional.
MR. GRISWOLD: -Yes, Mr. Justice, but if it is un­
constitutional, I find no basis for sustaining a —

18
Q

That*3 what I wanted to ask you.
Can the Tucker Act permit a claim founded —
MR. GRISWOLD:

Yea* Mr. Justice.

The Tucker Act

permits a claim if it is based upon the Constitution.
But suppose you find this statute unconstitutional?
What basis is there for writing a judgment against the United
States?
Q

It doesn't help any, in this respect, if he says,

"Denying me compensation when the statute gives compensation
to somebody else, denies me equal protection of the law, and
in order to remedy my denial of equal protection of the law
you must pay me."
MR. GRISWOLD:

I have one little trouble.

The Fifth

Amendment has no equal protection clause.
That is a problem that the Court has wrestled with
in other circumstances.
Moreover, even under the Equal Protection Clause, you
have the question of proper classification, and that, it seems
to me, is where the facts I would like to put before the Court

Q

Assuming he won on his equal protection argument,

that to deny him $20 a day when you pay it to other witnesses
is a denial of equal protection.

And he says, "I must then
X.

have the $20."
Is that a Tucker Act claim?

19
MR. GRISWOLD:

Yes, Mr. Justice, I think that would

be a Tucker Act case.
Q

Okay, That was the purpose of my question.
MR. GRISWOLD:

the solution or analysis.
Q

But I would not agree that that was
Yes, it is a fucker Act case.

You don't think then, Mr. Solicitor General,

that the Tucker Act, when it refers to the Constitution, speaks
only of the eminent domain or condemnation,
MR. GRISWOLD:

Wo, I don't see how it can be

limited solely to that, although that, of course, was a
large part of the basis upon which suits under the Constitution
are brought, either in District Courts for less than $10,000,
or in the Court of Claims for greater sums.
Q

The upshot is, as I understand the theorising of my

brothers on the other end of the bench, that if he prevails
on the statutory claim, on the construction of the statute,
he gets $21 a day, and if he prevails on the Constitutional
claim, he gets $20 a day.
MR. GRISWOLD:

Yes, that would seem to be that,

if the Court concludes that on the constitutional claim some
kind of automatic authority is required despite the basis for
proper classification which I would like to put before the
Court.
Q

That is a substantial question,
MR. GRISWOLD:

I agree with that.

It seems to me not irrelevant that all

20
of the main plaintiffs in this case, and as far as anything
appears — and

I

don't understand class actions, particularly

as applied to this sort of a situation -- as far as appears,
with respect to the numerous people who are said to be of the
same class involved — but all of the main plaintiffs in this
case are people who illegally entered the United States, who
were arrested,together with the people who brought them into
the United States, who were under the benign policy of the
Immigration and Naturalization Service, treated very gently
as illegal immigrants, but whose services were rendered for the
purposes of proceeding against those who were apparently
engaged in the business of bringing Mexicans into the United
States illegally.
All of the people involved in this case were subject
to deportation.

All of them were proceeded against criminally,

and were convicted of the crime of illegal entry.

All of than

were given a sentence of a year, but placed on immediate
probation.
And, I would like to call attention, not only to
Rule 46(b), which, after all, is a rule of this Court and must
have at some time obtained approval by this Court, and there
are cited in our brief various cases which support the holding
of witnesses who would not otherwise be available for criminal
trial, and the brief also shows that this goes back to the very
earliest days of the Republic under the Constitution,

Statutes

21
passed in 1789 recognised that people could be hold as material
witnesses and it has always been done.
The business of payment has had an experience of what
I would call neglect.
Back in 1850, 120 years ago, there was provided a
separate fee of $1 a day for witnesses held in custody and at
that time there was provided a fee of, I think, a $1.50 a day
for other witnesses.
Over the years, but only, really, within the past
20 years, the regular witness fee has escalated and has gotten
now to $20 a day, plus $16 a day for subsistence.
But no one has ever changed the $1 a day for people
who aro held in custody, except that in 1948 even that was
omitted when the Judicial Code was revised in 1948.
And, a year or two later, in a comprehensive
amendment to the Judicial Code for the purpose of correcting
errors which were made when it was put together, the $1 a day
was put back in.
Q

During that interim, the statute was not interpreted

to mean that people incarcerated got the $20, too, X take it?
I-IR. GRISWOLD:

Mr. Justice, I do not know, but I

don't think so.
My guess is that they just went ahead and paid them
$1 a day on the ground that this was going to be straightened
out anyhow.

22
Now, I think, it is also relevant to point out, as we
have in our brief on page 31, that Section 1821 is not the
only statute — this, I think, has some bearing on the con­
struction of Section 1821 — is not the only statute which
provides for detaining persons in this situation at a fee of
$1 a day.
This is printed in the footnote in the bottom half
of page 31:

"The Attorney General, under such conditions as

are by regulations prescribed, may stay the deportation of any
alien deportable under this Section,'*

and these aliens were,

,5if, in his judgment, the testimony of such alien is necessary,
on behalf of the United States, in the prosecution of offenders
against any provision of this .chapter or other laws of the
United States."
All of these people were held for the purpose of
being available to testify against the people who introduced
them into the United States.
All of those persons who were prosecuted pleaded
guilty, and all of these persons were discharged immediately
after the conclusion of that criminal case.
(Whereupon, at 12:00 o'clock, noon, the oral
arguments in the above-entitled case were recessed,
to bo resumed at 1:00 o’clock, p.m., the same day.)

23
AFT358HOOB SESSION
(1:00 p.m.)
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Solicitor General, you

may resume whenever you are ready.
MR. GRISWOLD:

Insofar as this case turns under the

Tucker Act on the construction of a statute, and we have
referred, primarily, to Section 1821, but I have also -mentioned
the corresponding immigration statute, Title 8, Section 12,
27(d), I do not think that there can be a construction of the
statute which would lead to the payment of $21 a day to these
detained witnesses.
Not only is that not a feasible or reasonable
construction on the face of the statute, but the contrary is
provided by the regulations of the Department of Justice which
are printed on page 16 of our brief.
Incidentally, I would call particular attention to
the second paragraph of the United States Marshalls Manual of
the Department of Justice.
Witnesses detained under Rule 46(b) of the Federal
Rules of Criminal Procedure should be paid the compensation of
$1 per day, except for the days they attend in court, when they
are entitled to the regular witness fee of $20.
And the same construction appears in this record, in
the answer of the United States Attorney, which, since the
petitioner here filed a motion for summary judgment, is admitted

24

for the purposes of this case*
This is on page 23 of the Appendix where the United
States Attorney alleged that it was the practice to pay $1 in
these cases, but whenever a witness who is detained in custody
is in attendance in court, or before a United States Commissioner
or before a person authorised to take his deposition, he
receives the witness fee of $20 for each day’s attendance*
Q

Hr. Solicitor General, my reading of the Appendix, on

page 3, indicates that on April 8th the District Court granted
the defendant motion for summary judgment, which would be the
Government, I take it.

So that — I would think that your

statement that the answer of the Government be taken as true
wouldn't necessarily be applicable.
HR. GRISWOLD:

Hr. Justice, here, again, I am not

wholly clear, but there joint motions for summary judgment,
and when the matter is before the court on joint motions for
summary judgment that is on the ground that there is no
material issue of fact in either way, and I had in mind the
fact that it was the Government's motion which was granted, but
there was also a motion for summary judgment by the petitioners
here.
I don't greatly care whether this is regarded as
admitted or not, I believe that it is the practice, and that
that is plainly evident by the United States Attorney — United
States Marshalls Manual, which is printed on page 16.

25
If there is a question with respect to the con­
stitutionality. of the statute as so construed, I find it
difficult to see that the answer is that this Court should
somehow or other rewrite the statute, and provide that an
amount should be paid.
Suggestion has been made in equal protection terns
if they are applicable to the Federal Government — arid I have
tried to argue in opposition — that there is no constitutional
right to any sort of a witness fee and that there is a proper
basis for classification, or discrimination, here, with respect
to people like these particular petitioners who were, themselves,
violators of the law, who were subject to a one-year sentence
in jail, whose grant of probation was coincident with the
holding as material witnesses, and who were then held until
the people who introduced them into the United States pleaded
guilty and were then immediately discharged.
As I understand the situation, no one of these
petitioners was paid $20 for any day, because no one of these
petitioners appeared in court because the people who introduced
them into the United States pleaded guilty.
Q

Their convictions, I take it, followed the events we

are talking about, did they?

They were not under conviction

while they were being held.
MR. GRISWOLD:

The dates are stated on pages 8, 9

and 10, but the chronologies are a little — certainly too

26
difficult for me to keep in mind.
Q

My point, that I am driving at is if they were under

the sentence they could have been held without any question —
MR. GRISWOLD:

They were under the sentence and could

have been held except that the sentence granted Immediate
probation.
Q

I see, but it could have done otherwise, couldn’t it?
MR. GRISWOLD:

It could have done otherwise and

was, I am sure, done as a part of the process by which they
were dealt with and then held until the people who introduced
them into the United States came to trial, which, in one case,
was about six weeks later, and in another case was about a
month later.
Q

If that had not been suspended until after these

events, we wouldn't be here on this case.
MR. GRISWOLD:

There wouldn't have been any problem

as to this, except, conceivably, under the Bail Reform Act,
they might have been entitled to bail before trial, whereas,
here, they were, in fact, —
Q

I am speaking of the after-trial period.

After they

had been found guilty, if, instead of suspending the sentence,
the judge had put them in the same building and said, "1*11
consider motion for modification of the sentence and suspension
of the sentence after you have testified."
MR. GRISWOLD:

After the trial, there would

have

'

27
been no problem about that at all.
Q

It was on March 26 when, apparently, they pleaded

guilty to the misdemeanor x^hich resulted in the six months
imprisonment, and then suspended and supervised probation for
one year.
And that same day, they were committed as material
witnesses.
So, it must have happened almost simultaneously,
I gather, Mr. Solicitor General.
I am reading from what you say at page 7 and 8.
MR. GRISWOLD:
Q

Yes.

You say at page 7 that it was on the 26th that these

petitioners pleaded guilty and got the six months execution,
which was suspended, and they were put on probation for one
year.
MR. GRISWOLD:
Q

That’s right.

And, then on the next page, it says on that day they

were committed as material witnesses.
MR, GRISWOLD:

On the same day.

My interpretation is

that it Is all part of one process designed to deal appropriately
with these people who had broken the law,and to provide the
evidence which was necessary to appear against the other
persons who had not,
Q

That's quite right.

If there hadn’t been that

suspension of execution of sentence, there wouldn't be any case.

28
MR. GRISWOLD:

If there hadn't been the suspension,

there wouldn't be any problem.
How, let me say, as I indicated in our brief in
opposition, that I have tried to do a little good In this
matter,
I have called it to the attention of the Deputy
Attorney General, and of the Attorney General, and it has
proceeded this far, that on January 10, 1973, the Attorney
General sent a letter addressed to the Speaker, a corresponding
letter to the Vice President, but the letter has not yet been
sent to the Speaker or to the Vice President.
The form I have has a big rubber stamp on it, 53To
Budget for clearance.

Mot sent to Congress.”

And under the form, there has to be clearance from
the Office of Management and Budget and the last paragraph of
the letter says, "The Office of Management and Budget has
advised that enactment of this legislation is consistent with
the objectives of this Administration,"
Mow, when clearance is obtained from the Office of
Management and Budget, and my influence at that office is
not always very great, but the Attorney General has recommended
it to them.
If it is obtained, then this proposal will be sent
to Congress.
The proposal, as it is indicated, raises the $1 per

,

29

day in both cases, that: is both in Section 1821 and in the
Emigration Provision, to $20 per day.
It also takes advantage of this opportunity to make
a change in the provision with respect to transportation costs
for ordinary witnesses, where the statute now provides that
there should be first class,and the suggestion is made that
in modern times economy class air fare is adequate, and they
are doing that.
However, I am told that this will be simply a means
of putting it before Congress, if it gets before Congress, and
the Department may well not support the full $20 a day.
And there is a very real problem here which needs to
be considered.
$20 a day for 30 days in a month is $600 a month.
And, in this particular area of Mexico, 70% of the people have
an income of less than $80 a month.
And there is great concern that if we provide a
built-in way to make $600 a month by illegally entering the
United States, and being detained as a witness, that the number
of people who do this may be very greatly increased.
Q

But you may be detained as a prisoner.
GRISWOLD:

Q

May be detained as a visitor?

As a prisoner and paid nothing.
MR. GRISWOLD:

Yes, but if that is — works out to

be eight times as much as you can make working in the fields in

30
Mexico, it may look pretty good.
And the suggestion:has been made that if this does
come before Congress that representatives of the Department
will recommend that there be added a proviso to this effect
— this wording is not final, but explains the idea — provided
that any alien who has entered the country illegally, and who
is held not more than 30 days as a material witness in a case
involving the illegal entrance of himself or another, or any
violation of the Immigration Law, shall receive only $5 per day
for such period of incarceration, when not attending in court.
And this, I mention because it seems to me to
emphasise the fact that this is a problem which ought not £o
be resolved in some kind of rigid constitutional terns, that
the Equal Protection Clause requires that everybody be treated
the same, that it obviously has practical connotations.
This is not just a mechanical thing, but the
protection of our borders against the introduction of illegal
immigrants who compete for jobs against American citizens,
in areas where jobs are not readily available, is a legitimate
matter of American policy, is a matter which can appropriately
receive the attention and consideration of Congress, and,
which it seems to me, in a proper allocation of function,
should be determined in detail by the Congress and not by this
Court.
Now, it is very appropriate, I think, that the issue

31
has been raised, and that steps are being taken so that it
will be put before Congress for active consideration there.
I would think that the ultimate resolution of the
problem would be better in the hands of Congress than by
any solution which, it seems to me, this Court can make.
This Court cannot spell out a detailed statute which
will say well, in case of illegal immigrants, and so on.
The only analogy that has been suggested for proceeding
by this Court is in terms of some equal protection idea, which
idea, I think, is not relevant here in the facts of this case.
Accordingly, we would submit that the judgment below
should be affirmed.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Solicitor

General.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ALBERT ARMENDARXZ, SR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. ARMENMRIZ:

If the Court please.

If I may

**Gentlemen, we have listened —
First, let me tell you that up to the — in the

lower court, as in the Court of Civil Appeals, the Government
did not argue that there was a rational basis for this
invidious discrimination that exists in this statute.
The Government —

Was it required to?
MR, ARMENDARIZ:

Q

You have the burden in the lawsuit, don’t you?
MR. ARMEWDARIZ:

Q

X would say yes.

Yes, sir, I recognise that, but —

You have the burden not only of showing a dis-

crimination, but an invidious discrimination.
MR. ARMENDARIZ:

Invidious.

Yes,

And the point

that I am making is that they resorted to 201, which is a
— which is sane thing — all of this argument which counsel
has made is subject to a motion to strike, because they have
added to this record in a rule that doesn’t come into effect
until July 1, 1973.
And we had submitted a stipulation as to the
appendix, and now he has added an appendix under this rule
which isn't a rule yet.
But the real reason for it is because up to now
they had advanced no reason, Your Honor, regarding the rationale
under which this statute might stand constitutionally.
Q

What is it you say the Government lias added?
MR. ARMRHDARIZ:

Here it is.

It is on page 5.

"Although we do not suggest that additional facts are
in any way necessary fco the resolution of the ease at this
stage, we believe the court may find pertinent,” so on and so
forth, "under Rule 201(b)(2) of the new Federal Rules of
Evidence."
Then they add, ' all the argument of counsel

Precisely.

This is what we say,

that is irrational because they — these are only generalisa­

I suggest, Your Honor, that in the added material
we find, for instance, that the Government has fined the

There is a quid pro quo.

another $300, which fully covers the

What is the maximum money fine that could be imposed

on an alien in these circumstances?

Q

Mo, I am speaking of these right here — your

petitioners.
How much could they have been fined for the offense?
MR. ARMENBARIZ:

the maximum for each offense.
Q

But if the judge had fined them $500 and six months,

then he could take — if you are right on your argument — he

of that $500, couldn’t they?

MR. AKMEHDARIZ:

Mo, sir, this doesn’t necessarily

follow, because you also have to take into consideration the
purpose of the statute, and this is what we haven’t considered.
What is the purpose of 1821?
The purpose of 1821 is to make payment to witnesses,
to see that they don’t lose out of their own pocket.

They are going to have to do something because it is un­

And they have gone to Congress because it is un­

differences, but the statute itself at this time is invidious.
Q

How long were they held as witnesses after they

were convicted?

38
MR* ARMENDARXZ:

Well, two of them were held almost

90 days, sir.
But we have some that were held siss months, some of
them nine months.

They can put them in jail and throw away the

key.
Q

Some of the named petitioners?

MR. ARMENDARIZ:

Yes, sir.

Two of the named

petitioners were held 90 days, Justice Marshall.

And they throw away the key.
How, they could have taken their deposition.

They

could have done several things, but if you have to pay them
$1 a day, these is no reason to do that, is there?

Keep them.

It is cheaper.

Are you asking for $20 a day for the whole time

or just the time after conviction?
MR. ARMENDARIZ:

Ho.

For the time after the

conviction, yes, sir.

That's all you are asking for?
MR. ARl-ISlffiARIZ: All we are asking for, sir.

That's not the way I read your complaint.
MR. ARMEMDARIZ:

That's what we meant.

look at this

minute to thank Your Honors for allowing me to sit my son

of this bar, for the permission that you gave *ne, for the
attention that you gave me.

I sincerely appreciate it.

differentiation because of alienage and I suggest that that

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr, Armendaris,

Mr. Griswold..
MR. GRISWOLD:

Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court

pleases, I will lodge this submission to the Budget Bureau with
the Clerk so that the Clerk will have the information available.
Q

That measure, when passed, wouldn't affect this

case, would it?
MR. GRISWOLD:
Q

No, Mr. Justice.

It is not retroactive?
MR. GRISWOLD:

I assume it could be made retroactive,

but the proposal is simply prospective, and whether anything
will come of this, I have no idea.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Well, thank you,
