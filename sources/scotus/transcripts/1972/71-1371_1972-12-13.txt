MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will, hear arguments

next in Rosario against Rockefeller, 71-1371.
Mr. Neuborne.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF BURT NEUBORNE, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. NEUBORNE:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case involves the constitutionality of Section
186 of New York's Election Law, which imposes severe restric­
tions upon qualified voters seeking to join the political
party of their choice and to participate in their party's
primary elections in New York State,
The complex and often indirect operation of New
York's deferred party enrollment scheme is set out at length
in petitioner’s brief at pages 4 through 7,
But, while the operation of New York's scheme may be
complex and difficult to follow, its effect is very clear,
New York's scheme imposes two serious impediments
upon the free operation of the electoral process in New York
State*
First, it establishes a cutoff period for partici­
pation in a party primary which is longer than the cutoff
period of any other State in the United States.
In order to qualify to participate in a presidential

4
primary in Now York State, which in Hew York State are held in
June of each — every four years in June

a potential party

enrollee must enroll in October of the preceding year, fully
eight months before the party primary.
In order to participate in a primary in a nonpresidential year, which in New York State are held in
September, a potential enrollee must enroll in the party in
October, fully eleven months prior to the primary in question.
Thus, petitioners in the instant case who registered
to vote for the first time in December of 1971, and who sought
to enroll in the party of their choice for the first time in
December of 1971, were barred from voting in the June 1972
primary because their enrollments had not become effective on
or before October 2, 1971, fully eight months before the
primary.

The second impact, which New York's statutory scheme
has on the operation of the political process, is to impose
a waiting period of a substantial period of time between the
/

attempt of a voter to join the party of his choice and the
effective date of his acceptance by the party.
Indeed, petitioners in this case, who attempted to
join the Democratic Party for the first time in December of
1971 and who completed solemn declarations of party loyalty at
that time, pledging to adhere to the principles of the party
and to support the candidates of the party, generally, at the

5
next elections, will not be recognised by the State of Mew
York as members of the Democratic Party until sometime between
November 14, 1972, and February 1, 1973, a waiting period of
between eleven to fourteen months.
Indeed, the drastic operation of Mew York's law can
be understood if we apply it to a person in Mew York State who
registers today for the first time.
If one of the two million unregistered voters in Mew
York — qualified, but unregistered,voters in Mew York City
were today to seek to enroll and to seek to register in a Mew
York City registration office, he would be ineligible to
participate in the primaries for the Mayor of the City of
New York scheduled to be held in September of 1973, and his
application to become a member of the political party in
question would not become effective under Mew York law until
sometime between November 15, 1973, and February 1, 1974.
The existence of so drastic a curtailment of the
political process poses very serious constitutional issues,
but we should note at the outset that there are several issues
which are not posed in this case.
There is not posed in this case any issue of internal
party regulation, in that the statutes in question are imposed
by New York State upon the political parties of New York
whether or not they wish to have them applied.
Indeed, in the instant case, the Democratic Party,

6
the party into which the four petitioners sought entry In
December of 1971, appeared in State Court in June of 1972,
shortly before the primaries, and requested that petitioners
similarly situated -- that plaintiffs similarly situated to
the petitioners be permitted to participate in the Democratic
primary.
That State Court proceeding was dismissed because of
lack of time and has not been reinstituted.
But we should emphasise that there is no Interest
whatever in permitting the political parties in the State of
New York to regulate themselves, raised by this case.
Nor does this case necessarily raise the arguably
more difficult issue of party switching or the alteration of
a pre-existing party affiliation.
For the four petitioners in this case are all new
registrants, first time voters, who were seeking to do nothing
more than to register their initial party affiliation.
Q

Would the impact of your position have an effect on

the parties and on the people who are already registered in
one political party or the other?
MR. NEUBORNE:

X think not, sir.

I think it would

simply permit those persons who wished to join a political
party to do so.
Q

Well, what about those who have already joined one

and they want to vote in the primary of the other party?

7

Wouldn't the adoption of your position open that up?
MR. NEU80RME:

I understand, sir.

It would be possible for this Court to frame a
decision narrowly to apply only to those persons who are
seeking to register their initial party affiliation.
Q

Is that all you are —
MR. NEUBORNE:

No, 3ir, we are not.

We believe that

the application of the New York process even to persons who
have been members of one political party and who seek to
alter their party affiliations raise very serious constitutional
questions.
And we believe that under the least drastic alter­
native analysis, which this Court has evolved, that even those
regulations cannot stand, but I simply -Q

Is there something in the record to show in what

category the named plaintiffs are?
MR. NEUSORNE:

Oh, yes, sir.

The allegations are

that they are registering for the first time and that they had
never before been members of any political party.
Now I do not believe that those facts are contro­
verted or that any contention -Q

Well, It is clear then that they aren't in the class

of people who have moved from one county to another or from one
State to another?
MR. NEUBORNE:

That is correct also, Your Honor.

s
Q

Your narrower argument would be that the State's

interest against rating, if it be illegitimate, can be
adequately protected by dealing only with those who have been
already registered?

m,

NEUBORNE:

Precisely.

But by dealing with the

potential class from which, if raters are to come at all,
they will come.
I suggest to the Court there is now pending before
the Court fcusper v, ponfcikga, an appeal from a three-judge
court in the Illinois District Court, in which the issue of
crossover participation, the issue of switching from the
Republican Party to the Democratic Party, was discussed by
the Court below.

The statute was declared unconstitutional.

And that case, I understand, is now pending on appeal before
this Court now.
So that If this Court wished to address itself to
the broader issue of crossovers, as well as initial party
affiliation, it could do so in the gonfcifceg case.
The basic issue, as we see it, therefore, raised by
this case, is whether New York may place such drastic obstacles
in the path of persons seeking to register and record their
initial party affiliation.
And we think the most obvious legal disability
inherent in the New York scheme is that it obviously operates
as a durational residence requirement.

9
Indeed, Hew York State, I do not understand to argue
to the contrary.
It is conceded that any person who established a
residence in Hew York on or after October 2, 1971, was in­
eligible to participate in the June 1972 primaries»

And it is

conceded that any person who established a residence in Hew
York on or after October 14., 1972, is currently ineligible
to participate in the September primaries scheduled for
September 1973.
Instead of responding to the argument on the merits,
Hew York has argued only that the petitioners, as persons who
are long-time residents of New York, lack standing to raise
the durational residence requirement issue.
But there seems no doubt that petitioners have
suffered an injury, in fact,at the hands of the New York's
deferred enrollment scheme.
There seems no doubt that they possess the classic
adversarial posture concerning the continuation of New York's
deferred enrollment scheme.
And this Court, in similar situations in the past,
has permitted petitioners situated similarly to the petitioners
in this case, to advance the arguments of persons who share a
basic community of interest in dealing with the allegedly
unconstitutional

scheme before the Court.

Thus, in Pearse v. The Society of Sisters, ThognhilJL

10
v. Alabama, Barrows v. Jackson., Griswold v, Connecticut,
Eisenstat v. Baird, and most recently in the Chief Justice’s
opinion for a unanimous Court in Bullock v. Carter, the Court
permitted the petitioners before the Court to raise the argu­
ments of persons with whom they were united in interest in
seeking to deal with an allegedly unconstitutional scheme,
especially when the continuation of the allegedly unconstitu­
tional scheme would have an inhibitory effect upon the exercise
of fundamental constitutional rights.
Moreover, the Rosario case was brought as a class
action on behalf of all persons who were being impeded in
attempting to join their political party by the operation of
New York's deferred enrollment process.
Judge Whistler, in his opinion

in the District

Court, specifically noted it to be a class action, and, thus,
we suggest that the petitioners herein have classic standing
to assert the arguments of the members of their class, as to
the unconstitutionality of Section 186.
Although the duration residence requirement,we
suggest,is the most obvious violation of the Constitution
before the Court, quite clearly, New York's statute operates
on long-time residents as well to violate their right to vote
and participate in the political process.
This Court in the past decade has forged a rigorous
standard which must be applied to State statutes which restrict

II
the operation of the franchise.
The test, as most recently formulated by the Court
in Dunn v. Blumstein, is whether the State statute at issue
advances a compelling State interest by the least drastic
means.
New York State argue3 first that because this is a
primary election we are talking about, instead of a general
election, that some lesser weakened diluted Constitutional
standard should apply.
However, this Court has recognised for 30 years that
the right to vote can be entirely frustrated unless it also
includes the right to particpate in the nominating process.
Indeed, as the Chief Justice noted in Bullock v.
Carter, often the outcome of a primary election is even more
important than the outcome of the general election because quite
often you have one party safe seats.
This is especially so in a State like New York
where one party strongholds have existed from since the
Civil War, and there were numerous primary elections.
(Whereupon, at 12:00 o'clock, noon, the Court
recessed, to reconvene at 1:00 o'clock, p.m., the same
day.)

12
AFTERNOON SESSION

(1:00 p.m.)
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr* Eteubome, you may

continue.
MR. HEUBORNE:

Thank you, sir.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
When we adjourned for lunch, we had begun to discuss
the argument made by Hew York State that because this is a
primary election that we are dealing with here, instead of a
general election, that some more relaxed constitutional standard
may be utilised to judge State statutes restricting the
interested parties from participating in such an election.
I had invited the Court's attention to a line of
precedent which began 30 years ago in this Court and culminated
in the Chief Justice's recent opinion,in Bullock v. Carter,
in which he pointed out that the outcome of a primary election is
often more important than the outcome of the general election
itself, and that for precisely those reasons if the right to
vote is to receive adequate protection it must also include
the right to participate in the processes by which the candidates
are chosen.
Indeed, that has been the law in Hew York State,
pursuant to New York State law, since 1911.
Thus, whatever the constitutional standard is that
is to be utilized in judging the constitutionality of State

13
statutes restrictive of the franchise, petitioners submit that
the same standard must be utilized in judging statutes which
restrict participation in primary elections.
The State argues, however, that even if one applies
the compelling State interest test to the statutory scheme
before the Court, New York is able to meet that test because
the statutory scheme deters bad faith rating of a political
party by persons not in sympathy with the party’s principles
who will attempt to participate in that party's primary
election, to, in some way, injure the party.
However, even assuming that the State has a compelling
interest in guarding against bad faith rating, and I suggest
to the Court that a very real question exists as to whether
the State possesses any compelling interest at all in prohibiting
persons attempting to affiliate with a political party for the
first time to affiliate with that party.
But, even assuming that the State does possess some
compelling interest in the prevention of fraudulent participation
in a primary, it is clear that at least five less drastic
alternatives exist, by which New York State could advance its
commendable interest in this case without at the same time
causing the broad disenfranchisement of thousands of New York
voters each year.
First, and most obviously, New York already has
a very effective device to guard against bad faith rating.

14
Section 332 of New York’s Election Law provides that
a person enrolling in a political party may be summarily
disenrolled at the instigation of a member of the party after

a hearing before a party functionary, upon a finding that the
attempted enrollee was not in good faith in his attempt to join
the political party.
The operation of Section 332 in New York State
has been one of extreme effectiveness.

Indeed, the history of

Section 332 in New York State demonstrates beyond argument
that it has been an effective tool to deal with precisely the
evil which New York State contends Section 186 is designed to
deal.
Q

That would be an awfully hard thing to prove.
MR. NEUBORNE:

Your Honor, the proof that has been

adduced in the various cases was to show a pattern of persons
moving from one party into another party, filing virtually
identical declaratory statements with a long history of having
been engaged in a contrary political activity, and some evidence
that they intended at some future time to go back to that
party.
The hearings under Section 332 are reported in a
ntanber of New York cases, the most significant of which I
suggest is

Zuckman v. Donahue, where 900 persons who were

allegedly raiding in a political party context were disenrolled
after a judicial hearing demonstrating that they were attempting

15
to enroll In bad faith.
As Chief Judge Mishler pointed out in the District
Court —
Q

Before the damage is done?
MR. NEUBORNE:

It is brought on exceptionally

quickly, yes, sir.
The initial hearing is one held before the county
committeemen of the party itself.

Now, of course, that hearing

must, in order to be constitutionally permissible, must be
subject to judicial review, but it is subject to judicial
review on a summary petition with very, very expeditious
consideration, and has, in the past, in New York, worked
admirably in dealing with precisely this problem.
Q

How many cases have gone through judicial review?
MR, NEUBORNE:

There are approximately 10 reported

cases in New York State — situations such as this.
Q

Over what period of time?
MR. NEUBORNE:

Well, we have had Section 186 on the

books, in one form or another, since the end of the 19th
Century.
The summary disenrollment procedure has been available
to us for a substantially shorter period of time, but my
recollection is, Your Honor, that the earliest case is
approximately 1930, that is cited in the reports.
Most of the raiding,if that's what one can call it,

16
has gone on in New York, went on in the period when the
American Labor Party disintegrated into two wings9 the American
Labor Party and the Liberal Party, and a contest commenced with
what had been the constituency of the American Labor Party.
And it was in that context that most of the raiding
situations came up.
Even in that context, a heated political struggle
between two factions, 332 was utilized with great effectiveness
in maintaining the purity of both political parties.
Q

When did this statute before us come on the books?
MR, NEUBORNE:

Q

Section 186, Your Honor?

The one that we are now dealing with.
MR. NEUBORNE:

The statutory scheme of having an

enrollment box which is opened once a year, I have traced
back to 1898,
It is in the codification of the Election Law in
1909 and it has been continued forward to the present time.
Chief Judge Mishler, in writing in the District
Court, noted the effectiveness of Section 332 as a device to
guard against party raiding, and I note in passing that Chief
Judge Mishler spoke with a great deal of experience.
Before his elevation to the bench in 1961, he was
the Chairman of the Queens County Republican Party, and had
been its candidate for public office on a number of occasions,
is familiar with the operation of the political process in New

17
York, and recognized Section 332 for what it is, a very effec­
tive device to guard against bad faith raiding.
A second less drastic alternative open to New York,
would be to apply these restrictive affiliation rules only to
those political parties who want them.

In other words, if a

party thinks that it is in some way being endangered it could
— I suppose New York could if it wished set up a statutory
scheme that allowed a party some option in protecting itself.
New York has not chosen to do this, has chosen
instead to Impose these restrictive rules on parties whether
or not they wish them and, indeed, in this particular case,
the Democratic Party went to Court to say precisely that it
didn’t want them and, nevertheless, was forced to live with
them.
The third less drastic —
Q

Might not that pose some kind of serious adminis­

trative problems, though, to the registration officials if
one party could be in and one party be out, as long as you do
have a State registration system?
MR. NEUBORNE.*

I think not, sir.

I think the first

answer is that if that’s what is necessary to permit persons
to vote, the fact that it would be administratively more
difficult to operate would not be a sufficient justification
f or not utilizing it.
But I do not believe that it would create substantial

18
administrative problems, because it would be perfectly possible
-- we only have four parties in New York State, the
Republican, the Democrat, Liberal and Conservative,
It would be perfectly feasible if the Legislature
of the State of New York wished to permit those parties to
opt for some form of deferred enrollment process, and simply
have the registrars make the entries as to who is a party
member at the point in time which the political party wished,
Bi other words, those parties which did not opt
would have the entries made immediately.

Those parties which

did opt could, if they wished, have the material in the
enrollment box for a period of time.
But the same number of entries would have to be
made by the administrative officials.

It would simply be

making them over a longer period of time.
Indeed, it might, Your Honor, it might be
administratively easier to do it this way, because the way the
system works now,all party enrollments in a year must be
entered by the official in a very short period of time.
As soon as the enrollment box is open in midNovember, every enrollment that has been made during the
preceding year must be entered within a very short time,
creating a very serious administrative backlog for the process.
Party option might have the effect of spreading
it out over a longer period of time and making it administratively

19

more workable.
I do not suggest that I am in favor of party option.
X merely pose it to the Court as a possible less drastic
alternative which Mew York could have utilised.
A third less drastic alternative which we discussed
earlier was the application of this particular statute to the
class which even arguably, the only class which even arguably
poses a danger of rattling,and that's those persons who have
a pre-existing party affiliation, and who are seeking to alter
that pre-existing party affiliation.
Every single instance of raiding which has been
- 4

t

**

v ... - " v

'

cited in the Mew York reports and which has been discussed by
the Attorney General, has involved persons of a pre-existing
party affiliation attempting to alter that affiliation to
participate in the affairs of another party.
Indeed, no other State except New York has found it
necessary to apply these types of restrictions to persons
seeking to newly affiliate with a political party.
In Phoenix y. Kolodztejski. Mr. Justice White,
writing for this Court, noted that it would not be permissible
for a State to base electoral restrictions on a hypothetical
possibility not reasonably likely to occur*
And in that case, he pointed out that only 14 other
States had similar restrictions on the franchise.
Well, this case is even dramatically more

20
insubstantial, in that no other State has seen fit to impose
this type of restriction upon persons attempting to affiliate
with a political party for the first time,
Q

You do have a fairly unique situation in New York

with your four recognised parties,
MR. NEUBQ&NE:

I don’t claim to be an expert on

the political party structure of the other 49 States, but I
would be surprised if there were not minority parties in other
States as well.
If Ohio, Illinois, California, Pennsylvania, can
get along without this type of restriction applied to newly
enrolled persons seeking to merely register their initial
party affiliation, it is inconceivable to me that New York
requires this type of drastic restriction which has the effect
of barring persons similarly situated to the petitioners, from
*

participating in a primary, despite the fact that they tried to
enroll in that primary over six months before it was held.
The fourth less drastic alternative would be a
«

reliance upon the loyalty oath, which New York State currently
requires persons attempting to enroll in a political party to
s ign.
In order to enroll in a political party in New
York, one must file a solemn declaration of adherence to party
principles and a solemn declaration of intention to support the
nominees of the party at the next general election.

21
That requirement forbids casual party affiliation in
New York and it has the effect of making it virtually impossible
for large casual party switches to occur.
In other words, we must assume, if there is to be
an evil in New York State that persons will fraudulently
execute these affiliation — these enrollment blanks, and it
is, we believe, inconceivable to think that large scale
fraudulent switching will occur»
Finally, if large scale fraudulent switching does
occur in violation of the party loyalty oath, New York maintains
a comprehensive system of criminal sanctions for fraudulent
participation in the electoral process, which, as Mr. Justice
Marshall pointed out in Dunn y. Blumstein, can be used
effectively to guard against fraud.
So that really what New York has done here is not
use the least drastic alternative.
The only way to describe what they have done is
they have used the most drastic possible alternative to deal
with this problem, and they therefore in so doing have
unnecessarily disenfranchised thousands and thousands of
New Yorkers.
Even if this case did not involve voting rights,
even if it did not involve a dilution of the franchise and
a triggering of the compelling State interest test, it would
nevertheless raise the most serious questions undor the

22
association freedoms protected by the First Amendments because
the effect of Hew York statutory scheme is to create a waiting
period which forces persons attempting to join a political
party to wait as long as 14 months before they are accepted
into that party.
How the right to join and the right to associate
with a political party for the advancement of common beliefs
is the core association freedom protected by the First
.Amendment,

it is the most important association freedom we

have.
How,before Hew York can impose this type of
drastic and unique interference with the operation of that
associatIona1 freedom, it must come forward and demonstrate
some overriding societal interest, which can be advanced by
no less drastic means.
That is precisely the test that Mr, Justice Harlan
used in his concurring opinion in Williams v. Rhodes-, ..when
he analysed the impact of the Ohio Election Law and ruled that
it had an impermissible constitutional effect upon persons
attempting to associate for the advancement of common political
goals in Ohio.
We suggest that it is no coincidence that the test,
the constitutional test, which Mr. Justice Harlan utilised
in Williams v, Rhodes, is very similar in operation and effect
to the compelling State interest test which Mr. Justice Marshall

23
utilized in Buna v« Bluasteia.
They work very, very similarly*

They come out just

about the same, and they do because they are both designed to
protect the single most important values that we can possibly
have in a democracy, which is the right to participate in the
political process by which are leaders are chosen.
That is an ultimate First Amendment right, as well
as a right to vote, and we suggest, therefore, that even if,
as Mr. Harlan did in Williams v« Rhodes, even if one has chosen
the Kramer, Evans v> Cornman, Dunn line of authority, and
analyzes this case solely as an associational freedom test,
the interests which New York State has advanced are far, far
less compelling than those which this Court has rejected in
associational freedom cases of the past.
If I may, Your Honor, I would like to reserve the
remainder of my time for rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Nueborne.

Mr. Greenwald.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF A. SETH GREE^MJ), 1’SQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
ME. GREENWALD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
In considering this case, I think that there is a
certain similarity to the previous case argued here, to those
of us acquainted with professional sports.

24

It seems to me the previous case concerned itself
with what California can do to stop the Pirates and the present
case involves what Hew York can do to stop the Raiders*
The statute in question, Hew York State Election
Law, Section 1B6, the enrollment box statute, simply provides
that enrollment blanks in a party are placed in a box and are
removed after the general election.
What this means, as has been pointed out, is that
for an enrollment to be effective for the primary next
succeeding, it has to be done before the general election.
If it is done after the general election, it is
deferred.
Q

These problems are the same for first voters as

for all others, people who are moving and people who just
have never bothered to register over a lifetime?
MR. GREENWALD:

Hew York has, in Section 186, a

general rule that provides that registrations, excuse me,
enrollments, must be accomplished before the general election
to avoid the danger of raiding.
However, the next section of the law, Special
Enrollments, provides that persons who have reached voting
age after the general election can get a special enrollment
and immediately enroll in a party up to 30 days before the
primary.
There are a number of other exceptions provided in

23
Section 187,
Another one is if a person did not have residency
requirements at the time of the preceding general election.
However, once again, there is a further restriction there in
subdivision 6 of 187, that is restricted to the same comity
as the person resided at the time of the preceding general
election.
So, I think that New York has shown that it is
not opposed, per se, to later enrollments.

It is concerened

with the danger of raiding and protecting party integrity,
Q

In what category are these named plaintiffs?
MR. GREEMALD:

These named plaintiffs are voters

who were eligible and could have been effectively enrolled in
a party before the preceding general election, but failed to
do so for unstated reasons,
Q

They never had been enrolled?
MR. GREEMALD:

They never had been enrolled, that

is correct.
And, the point is that the —
Q

Raiders or potential raiders?
MR, GREENWALD:

I think they can be, because New

York is concerned with non-party votes being cast in a party
primary for purposes inimicable to the party.

And there is

the same danger with the independent and you have to keep in
mind that an independent is one of the major political blocks

26
of American political life*
An independent is material for a raid also, just

j

as people who have actually enrolled in another political
party.
1 think that it is quite apparent that in many
situations if a party is engaging in raiding it is not going
to stop just with its own members’ raid, it is also —
Q

Let rae see.

I thought this was a group who,

after the ratification of the amendment permitting IS to 21
year olds to vote for the first time became eligible and that
was after the general election.

m.
Q

GREENWALD•

No.

Aren’t they a group who be carae 18 to 21 and eligible

to vote following ratification of the amendment.
MR. GREEMALD;

The 26th Amendment was ratified in

the summer of 1971, I believe July.

At that time, anyone who

was enfranchised by the 26th Amendment was eligible to register
and enroll in a political party in the State of New York.
If they failed to do so by, as would anyone else in
the State of New York, if they failed to do so by the general
election of '71, they were not enrolled in the party to vote
in the 1972 primary.
Q

But if they became 18 after the general election,

they could specially —
MR. GREENWALD:

Specially enroll under Scaction 187.

27
There is an exception.
Q

But this group could not?
HR. GREEMALD:

This group could not because it

had not availed itself of the statutory obligation to enroll
in the party —
Q

You say that these named plaintiffs had — were

eligible to enroll prior to the general election?
MR. GREENWALD:

That’s stipulated.

There is no

argument that these named plaintiffs, petitioners involved here
just simply failed to take the opportunity which is available
to every voter in the State of Hew York to enroll in a political
«i-.

party timely and avoid the dangers of raiding.
Q

Are the plaintiffs distressed at the time just being

too long a time?
MR. GREEHWALD:

That is part of it, and I think the

Court of Appeals opinion addresses itself to why we have the
date of the general election as the operative date,
to be done before the general election.

it has

That is simply that

before the general election it would be the rare politician
that would encourage a voter to vote for his party at the
general election but enroll in another party.
But, after the general election, no such deterrent
would be present.

He doesn’t have to put himself in that type

of unseemly, incongruous position.
And I have indicated that we are seeking to

28
discourage raiding.
Q

What was the date of the Mew York primary?
MR. GREENWALD:

The New York primary was June 20,

1972, this year.
Q

June 20th.

And at that primary, were nominations for

other offices than the Federal offices?
MR. GREENWALD:

At that time, there were nominations

for Federal offices, State offices, such as the Assembly and
State Senate involved.

Yes, there were State offices involved

also.
Q

Mr. Greenwald, I was ..a little bit confused by one

of your earlier references to raiding.

I have understood it

as being the process by which people unsympathetic to the basic
goals of a party try to take it over for a particular period of
time.
I,perhaps erroneously, got the impression from one
of your comments that you thought of raiding as something
broader, as a party on its own initiative going out and getting
independents to join it.
MR. GREENWALD:

Well, to join it in — Justice

Rehnquist, to join it in a raid on another party.
X would also like to point out

that in this day and

age when we have a lot of *iell organized independent, ostensibly
non»political, groups which at, perhaps,primary time have
political interests, say, to defeat a candidate, they also would

29
encourage people fco enroll in a party, independents, other
party members to defeat a candidate who is adverse to the
interests they care to advance.
And, 1 think, once again, that this is destructive
of the political party process as we know it.
New York, of course, has a closed primary system.
Q

Isn’t there another problem of crossovers, say, by

Democrats, into a Republican primary to influence the choice of
the Republican nominee and then vote against him at the general
election?
MR. GREENWALD:
Q

Precisely,

It can work both ways*.

It can work both ways all right,
MR. GREENWALD:

It is not an issue of who has the

advantage at one particular time

I\think there is a clear

compelling State interest in preventing this type of activity
from occurring.

And, certainly, Section 186 is an effective

means of doing it,
Q

Mr. Greenwald, basically raiding is done by one

party going into the other party temporarily, is that right?
MR. GREENWALD:

That is basically the generally

accepted definition.
Q

That is not true here.
MR. GREENWALD:

Q

Well, I contend that —

What is there in thi3 record that shows that these

people were ever in any other party?

30
MR. GREENWALD:

They were not ever in any other

party.
Q

Well, how can they be changing party?
MR. GSEENWALD:

I say that when a person has failed

to avail himself of the opportunity to timely enroll, when at
the time of the preceding general election, he failed to
indicate that he was, say, a democrat, when he had the
opportunity to do so, that when he later seeks to, in effect,
change his status —
Q

Change what?
MR, GREENWALD: Change status.

Political status,

from independent to, say, democrat, that is as much a change
of political affiliation as when someone is a Republican and
seeks to change it to Democrat,
Q

Is there anything to show that they were independent?

Maybe they just weren’t voting, period.

All people who don’t

vote aren't independent.
MR. GREENWALD:

The question of why people don't

vote is, of course,a hotly contested matter.

A lot of people

feel that it is simply a matter of apathy.
Q

Well, you are dealing with people's rights here.

X think you have to show some basis in order to deny them that
right.

Your basis is that this law is to protect people from

raiding another party, which is not this case, I submit.
MR. GREENWALD:

Well, the dangers involved In party

31
raiding may not be immediately presented by this case, but X
do submit that if Section 186 had not been in effect this past
year, there would have been a substantial crossover vote in
the State of New York.
This was demonstrated by the fact that in States
where party affiliation restrictions had been struck down
this spring, there was substantial crossover voting and nonparty members voting in, say, the Democratic primary.
Q

There was also crossover voting in New Zealand,

I imagine, too, but we are restricted to these plaintiffs
and the class they represent.
NE. GREENWALD:

Am I correct?

I understand the class that is

involved.
Q

Is there anything in the record that shows that

shows anybody in this class was crossing?
MR. GREENWALD:

No, there is nothing in the record

to show that these particular petitioners were crossover voters,
Q

The Constitution goes to the person involved.
MR. GREENWALD:

Q

Yes.

I suppose one of the State's contentions here is

that given the nature of the evil it was entitled to adopt a
prophylactic solution that struck generally at what was in­
volved, and the fact that it might on occasion be a somewhat
more attenuated nexus than others, wouldn't necessarily make
it unconstitutional.

32

MR. GREENWALD:
case,

I think that that certainly is the

We have here a statute that directs itself equally at

an evil.

It places the same requirements on all voters,

generally.
Q

In that primary in June, would there be any sort

of vote which had a bearing on the selection of delegates to
the National Convention?
MR. GREENWALD:

You mean the one past June?

Well, at the time —
Q

I mean was this a bunch of youngsters who it was

thought if they could vote in the primary would probably vote
for McGovern for the Democratic candidate?
MR. GREENWALD:

Well, I think that when this case

came up here on petition for certiorari.a political organisation,
Lawyers for McGovern, filed a brief amicus curiae.
It is interesting that today they didn't file a
brief on the actual case*
Q

It is academic now*
MR. GREENWALD:

Well, it shows that — it shows

where their concern is at one particular primary, in the
personality of one particular candidate, or perhaps one
particular issue.
And 1 think that the argument that the petitioners
made that a person has the right to join a party to advance
the interest of a particular candidate or a particular issue,

33
strikes at the heart of our political party system, which
contemplates that people join a political party because they
are generally attuned to the basic theories of Government of
the party.

Now, once again, I recognise that our political
parties are fluid in the United States, and I think that's
the beauty of the deferred enrollment system.

A person who

joins the Democratic Party in a national election year, such
as this year, could effectively join, say, the Liberal Party
for a municipal election which is coming up next year, and
in the following year, join the Republican Party for the State
election, if he feels the issues are different.
Now, I don't think there are too many people who
do this, but the opportunity is available.

All New York State

asks is that the person do this at the proper time to avoid
the danger of raiding, or short notice takeover of political
parties.
Involved herein is the integrity of the closed
party primary in the State of New York, which includes, not
just Democratic and Republican parties, but rather the two
other minor parties, the Conservative and Liberal parties,
which have very limited enrollments* and especially when you
get down to an assembly district basis, primaries in those
two minor parties can be controlled by very few votes.

It is

very easy to take them over with members of other political

34

parties, or, for that matter, well organised independents
with interests antithical to the political party.
Q

The New York is the only State that has the period,

defers the period from the date before the previous general
election?
MR. GREENWALD:
other States.

I have checked the statutes of

Kentucky has a similar system as to people who

have affiliated with a party.

You cannot switch your party

enrollment between the period of the general election and the
primary.
Also, from my reading of the Kentucky statute,
I would say this would include anyone who registered to vote
but failed to enroll in the party.

However, there is a

provision, as I said, for new registrants.
I do think though that most States, or a goodly
number of States,are trying to accomplish the same thing as
the State of New York is trying to accomplish here, to reduce
the possibility of party raiding,

^

And the fact that Section 186 is an effective
means of doing it, as the Court of Appeals below pointed out,
does not mean that it is an improper means.
X think this brings us to the issue of just what
is the nature of a primary.
election.

A primary is not a general

It is set up to allow party members to select their

candidates, and, as such, it replaces a caucus or convention.

35
The vote is properly limited to party members.
If you don't close your primary ***■ and some States
don't close them — you have the possibility, indeed, the
probability of raids.
I think this is demonstrated that it has always been
the case in States aueh as Wisconsin.

What happened this

spring is instructive.
I would submit that a State has the discretion to
define the constituency of a political party so long as the
definition does not permanently exclude anyone who may wish to
be represented.
That’s exactly what is done here.

The enrollment

is taken but it is deferred.
Now, we have, at this point —I have contended that
I do not think it is necessary to apply the compelling State
interest test.

X would contend that the traditional, rational

basis test is perfectly applicable to this type of control of
the exercise of the franchise.

This is not a disenfranchising

statute, and I think the fact it applies to all voters
equally in primary voting is indicative that you can apply the
rational basis test.
However, and X am well aware that this case has
always been decided on the basis of the compelling State interest
test, we have another standard, and X think it Is called,
perhaps the close scrutiny because allegedly fundamental

36

rights are involved.
Once again, this statute has withstood close
scrutiny, and the statute has an important purpose, and
especially because it is a primary case —
Q

Has it been on the books —
MR. GREENWALD: Oh, yes.

It has been on, I think

you can say a little longer than Mr, Neuborne has, but the
basic point is that since the beginning of the primary system
in Hew York, we have had this deferred enrollment system.
I think that's instructive,if you know, probably
some of you do, some of the political history of the State of
New York has been filled with a lot of political shenanigans,
and back room tactics, and I think that the desire of the State
of New York to preserve party integrity to avoid unseemly
electoral practices is perfectly proper.

However, if we have to meet the compelling State
interest test, I think, we have to go no further than look at
the Court of Appeals opinion,
I don't think there is too much dispute at this
point that there is a compelling State interest in preserving
party integrity and avoiding raids.
As such, the statute achieves its end by the least
drastic means.
I object to this test because, as the Chief Justice
has said, in very short past, that this statute.'. — that this

37

test demands perfection.
And yet 186 has met this test.

It meets it because

the suggested alternatives are not truly viable when you
consider the dangers of large scale raiding.
The discussion of the party disenrollment statute,
Section 332, demonstrates, as in the decision of the Court
below, that it is enormously time-consuming and it would
be ineffective in States with large scale raiding.

The point

being, of course, in the paucity of cases, that with 186 you
i

don't have too many 332 cases.
The fact is that 332 is simply a supplement to
Section 186, and there is no doubt in my mind that if we had
to rely solely on 332 we would have a much more serious
infringement to First Amendment rights with the Courts inquiring
into voters' political beliefs and the genuineness of those
beliefs which is avoided in Section 186.
As to this infringement — alleged infringement of
First Amendment rights --it should be noted, as the Court
said below, that 186 is designed to minimally infringe on
First Amendment rights,

primary restrictions that w<*re struck down.
Q

After the general election, could any one of these

38
have enrolled?

After the '71 general election?

MR, GREENWALD:
in this case.
Q

Wo.

That’s exactly what happened

'

Who may?
MR. GREENWALD:

Who may?

Yes.

Section 187 of

New York's Election Law provides a number of categories.
If I could» it states this subdivision 2 —
Q

Where do you find that?
MR. GREENWALD:

Right after Section 186,

1 don't

believe it is in the appendix, but it is referred to in the
Court of Appeals — some of the exceptions of 187 are referred
to in the Court of Appeals decision.
One of the exceptions is that

- as I have alluded

to before — a person who became of age after the preceding
general election.
A person who became naturalized,
A person who didn't have the necessary residential
qualifications, although, once again, I direct, if you had
the statute, there is a further exception in Subdivision 6
which limits that to the same county.
A person who was in the service of the military at
the time of the preceding general election or enrollment time.
A person who was in a Veterans Bureau Hospital, and
also spouses or children.
A person who was incapacitated by Illness during the

39
preceding general election.
These are all people who —
Q

How does one go about if he is -- falls into one of

those classes, what does he do?
MR. GREENWALD:

Well, he goes to the Board of

Elections within — at least 30 days before the primary3 and
he gets a special enrollment and he is immediately enrolled
in the political party and can vote in the primary.
I think that it is instructive, when you talk about
First Amendment rights, that if a four-year restriction on a
person who voted in the primary of another party from being
a candidate of the second party is not an unjust infringement
of First Amendment rights as was affirmed by this Court in
Lippitt v, Cippollone.
Then it seems clear to me that the much lower
restriction, or whatever, or requirements of Section 186, are
not any more offensive to the First Amendment,

They are

amply justified by the situation Involved.
Q

That Ohio statute barred them from being a candidate

if he had voted a primary of the opposite party any time
within the previous four years.
MR. GREENWALD:

Yes.

And what 1 point out that X

think it has been said by the Chief Justice in Bullock v.
Carter, that the rights of voters and candidates don't lend
themselves to neat separation.

40
Ifc would seem to me that the right to be a
candidate is as much a First Amendment right as the right to
vote.

They are both encompassed in the political rights of

cifcizens.
I think also it is instructive that New York has
a history of allowing party switches.

If we look back to 1971,; the situation with

Democratic Party and then proceeded to seek the Democratic
nomination.
If we look then also during a period when Section
186 would defer his enrollment.

Congressman Ogden Reid

switched from the Republican to Democratic Party.

These

switches are made in good faith and, as has been shown, Section
186 is not a bar to such switches of political affiliation.
Q

Two voters in New York switched parties and that

has what effect on me?
MR. GREENWALD:

I am giving this example to

demonstrate that Section 186 does not prevent the honest,
trustworthy citizen from exercising his First Amendment rights.
Q

Did you say those that acquire citizenship,in the

meantime, can be registered?
MR. GREENWALD:
Q

Yes, I believe —

Well, in the Southern District, they sometimes have

41

throe or four hundred in one class, am I right?
MR. GREENWALD:

I am not acquainted.

I will accept

that.
Q

Well, suppose you take all those over and register

them in one party? Would that be raiding?
MR, GREENWALD:

The State of New York, in Section

187, has made certain exceptions.

They feel that these people

who have not had an opportunity, certainly they couldn’t have
enrolled at the time of the preceding general election, they
should have an opportunity to specially enroll,
Q

Would it be raiding, wa3 my question?
MR. GREENWALD:

I don’t say that is raiding.

It

might possibly be, but it is not a serious danger.
Q

There is nothing you could do about that, could you?
MR. GREENWALD: Well —

Q

Assuming it was raiding.

Is there anything New York

could do to stop it?
MR. GREENWALD: Yes.

As the supplement of this

enrollment statute 332 could be applied if that could be shown
to be raiding.

Section 332 of the Election Law, the dis-

cnroliment statute, Your Honor.
Q

They could be disenrolled? For going in a block to

register?
MR. GREENWALD:
raiding.

If it could be shown that it was

I doubt if in such a situation it could conceivably

42
be raiding, if a person has just been naturalized.
Q

What in your statutes defines what’s raiding?
MR. GREEMWALD:

Raiding is not defined in the

statute, Your Honor.
Q

So you couldn't do anything to them, could you?
MR. GREENWALD:

I doubt if anything effectively

could be done.
The final thing I’d like to allude to is the in­
jection of the durational residency requirement -- durational
residency question into this case,
present.

I do not think it is

There is no doubt that the instant petitioners,

the people involved here never lacked residency.
Certainly, as to them, they are not being subjected
to a durational residency requirement.
Furthermore, if there was such a petitioner in this
case, a person who had moved into county or from out of State,
there is no doubt in my mind that there is another section of
the law that they’d be attacking, namely 187, Subdivision 6.
To that extent, it seems to me, the interest of
that class, and my adversary has pointed out to the various
classes possibly involved, although we only have one class in
this case — as to that class, the Interest of the class the
petitioners represent, are antagonistic.

It is a different

case.
It seems that the statute clearly is not a durational

43
residency requirement,

does not, by its very terns, require

someone be a resident of the State for a certain period of time
before he can enroll in a party.
I think that it is essentially not in the case.
In summary, I think it can fairly be stated that
Section 186 is a reasonable statute fulfilling a compelling
State interest by the least drastic effective means.
It is submitted that it has a minimal effect on
First Amendment rights and it is not a durational residency
requirement or, there is another argument, a grandfather
clause.

There is no racial motivation in this case.

not a grandfather clause.

It is the young voters.

It is
Indeed,

we do have an exception for young voters who come of age.
It was not in the complaint that any allegations
of racial discrimination, and I think the decision in the
welfare case, Jefferson v. Hackney,

a very recent decision of

this Court, clearly demonstrates that the possible greater
affect on a racial minority Is no proof of the fact that it
is a racially disc minatory law.
Furthermore, there is nothing in the record to show
that.
At this point, I will rest.
Q

Was this question here before?
MR. GREEMALD:

Was this question here before?

I had made an argument that there were appeals from

44
the Mew York State Court of Appeals, which did involve Section

186, and the deferring of enrollments that were appealed to
this Court —
Q

Did it raise the same question?
MR. GREE WALD:

I contend that it did raise the

counsel in this case, as a matter of fact --

appeared •*Q

What was the issue in the case?
MR. GREENWALD:

The issue was that Mr. Friedman

could not be a candidate for Congress because his enrollment
was deferred due to a late transfer of enrollment.

constitutionality of the section?
MR. GREEWALD:

Yes, I believe it did and this

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr.c

Thank you, Mr. Greenwald.

Neubdrne.you have three minutes.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BURT NEUBORNE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. NEUBORNE:
here prior to this case

The Friedman case, Your Honor, was

45
However, two distinguishing characteristics
existed in the Friedman case.
First, Friedman was attempting to be a candidate,
similar to the Lippltt situation where the candidate in Lippitt
was attempting to run and not vote.
As the Chief Justice noted in Bullock v. Carter,
the right to become a candidate may be very different than the
right to actually vote in a particular election.
Secondly, —
Q

Barred as a candidate by virtue of a provision

dealing with candidates or was he barred as a candidate by
virtue of this provision dealing with registration as a voter?
MR. WEUBORNE:

I know of no provision that deals

only with candidates, so I assume —
Q

It would have been this provision.
MR. HEUBORNE:

Secondly, and more Importantly,

Your Honor, I suggest —
Q

The fact that it did deal with application of 186«

Q

Treated him as not properly enrolled, did it?
MR. NEUBORNE;

Yes, sir, to a person who wished to

become a candidate.
Q

How do you differ?
MR.NEUBQRNE:

Well, the major distinction that I

have with that case is that the record in that case indicated
that there was a very substantial question as to the good faith

46
of Mr.Friedman’s residence, and, in fact, there was an
adequate State ground upon which the State Courts passed on
that case, and that’s that there were serious questions as
to whether or not he was a bonafide resident of the address
from which he was attempting to enroll.
Q

That’s one of substantial Federal question.

That’s

a different thing from dismissing because the State decision
rested on inadequate State ground, isn’t it?
MR. KEUBORWE:
Q

Yes, sir. I understand that.

So we can’t treat it as having been handled here,

on the ground that it rested on inadequate State ground, can
we?
MR. NEUBORWE:
Q

There were serious statements —

We certainly didn’t, when we dismissed it for want

of substantial questions.
MR.WEUBORNE:

That is correct, sir.

However, I

wish to reiterate that that was again a candidate case, very
much as Llppitt was a candidate case.
More importantly, I think, Your Honor —
Q

He was barred as a candidate because he was barred

as a voter, wasn't he?
MR. NEUBORNE:

Yes, sir, but his right to become

a candidate triggered the particular test that the Court was
utilizing at that time.
As Your Honor pointed out in Bullock, a very different

47
set of considerations come into play when a person -Q

It may be if you couldn’t bar a voter a fortiori,

you shouldn't be able to bar a candidate.
MR. NEUBGRNE:

Well, I am frankly troubled by that

distinction, Your Honor.
Q

Yes, 1 should think you would be.
MR, NEUBORNE:

I am troubled by the distinction in

Lippifct. and it is a distinction which has been made by this
Court and which does distinguish the Friedman case.
Briefly, I wish to point out that the petitioners
in this case could have registered during the brief period
between the time the 26th /amendment was enacted, was ratified
in June of 1971, and the close of registration in New York in
October of 1971.
But they would have been registering in connection
with elections in New York State where the highest office at
stake was that of County Executive and wbere the turnout was
exceptionally low, simply because there were no significant
issues presented to the electorate at that time.
Indeed, the turnout was so low that the vast bulk
of persons who registered under the 26th Amendment did so after
the 1971 general election.
Q

But then they are In the position of raising the

constitutional question deriving from their own inadvertence
or —

48
MR. WEUBORHE:

Ho, sir, I don’t think it is in­

advertence .
Judge Dooley —
Q

Well, then, their own indifference,

to use the word less than indifference.

I was going

They were indifferent

to that particular election, on what you tell us,
MR. NEUBGRHE:

Well, Your Honor, where the highest

office at stake was that of County Executive, in the
particular primary where they sought to enroll, they were
attempting to participate in a presidential primary in Hew
York.
Judge Dooley, in a related case, noted that you
**■

can swim 365 days a year, but you only do it when it is hot.
You can register quite often, but you only do it when the
political season begins to heat up.
And X submit to you, that these petitioners
attempted to register to vote -Q

You only raid when it is hot —
MR. MEUBORNE:

Well, that may be so, Your Honor,

yes.
But, again, you only raid, I submit, if you are
moving from one party to another.
Q

Well, X suppose the fact is anyway any organised
