MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

next in 71-863s Columbia Broadcasting against the Democratic
National Committee}, 864, 865 and 866,
Mr. Solicitor General.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERWIN N. GRISWOLD, ESQ.s
OH BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GRISWOLD;

Mr. Chief Justice and may It please

the Court;
This is a group of four related cases all here on
writs of certiorari to review the same decision of the United
States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
The questions arise out of two proceedings
commenced by.separate letter communications to the Federal
Communications Commission.

The first letter of .stomp Iaint was

sent to the Commission on January 22;. 1970 by. an organisation
known as Business Executives Move for Vietnam Peace,
customarily called ”BSM" In these proceedings.
This complaint appears at page 291 of the Appendix,
BEM sent an order from the Communications Commission to compel
Washington radio station WTOP to rim spot announcements
against the Vietnam wars either free of charge or for a fee.
Although BEM’s specific complaint related to advertising time,
its arguments were not confined to this.

The substance of the

complaint appears near the end at page 296 of the Appendix and

I will read the first full paragraph at the top of page 296:
"For the reasons stated above,, the Business
Executives' Movement for Vietnam Peace requests that the
Federal Communications Commission order WTOP to broadcast
free of charge BEM one-minute announcements or, in the
alternative, that the Commission require WTOP to sell BEM
air time for broadcasting of these announcements."
The Respondent in that matter. Post Newsweek stations
replied to the complaint by letter and there were further
filings by letter which appear in the Appendix.
There was no hearing or any submission In evidence
or argument other than these letters.
The other proceeding before the Commission began
on May 19th, 1970 when the Democratic National Committee
wrote to the Commission requesting a declaratory ruling
which would allow it to buy time in order to comment on public
issues and solicit funds.

This letter begins on page 15 of

the Appendix and the essence of it is on the opening page,
page 15s and there the Democratic National Committee requested
the Commission to issue a declaratory ruling that under the
First Amendment to the Constitution and the Communications Act
a broadcaster may not as a general policy refuse to sell time
to responsible entities such as the DNC for the solicitation
of funds and for comment on public issues.
the
DNC indicated that it wanted/time for the broadcast

5
of specific programs of varying durations and for spot
announcements of varying durations.
DNC said that the primary reason for wanting this
time was that it was in debt and it needed the money the
television solicitation could bring in.
its claim to advertising time.

It did not limit

It relied on the First

Amendment, but it recognised that even under its First
Amendment claims broadcasters could limit the use of their
facilities to —- and I quote their words: "Responsible
spokesmen" and it recognized the broadcasters could adopt
procedures to insure that the presentation was in good taste.
The Commission asked for comments from the three
broadcasting networks.

The National Broadcasting Company

responded that it had no policy against selling time to a
political party and that it would permit so.licitatlon of funds
on such a program.

It added that it had offered to sell time

to DNC but was advised that the Committee did not wish to
proceed, with the purchase.
Both the American Broadcasting Companies and the
Columbia Broadcasting System responded saying, in substance,
that they were buying to comply with the Fairness Doctrine
established by the Commission and upheld by this Court in
the Red'Lion case in 395US but that It was their policy not to
accept sponsored discussions of political or controversial
issues or to allow solicitation of funds.

6
The position of CBS may be summarized by referring
to page 51 of the Appendix* about two inches from the top of
the text.

"In adopting this policy

concluded that we could

not provide coverage of significant issues with fa.irness and
balance if partisans with strong financial resources could
prempt our facilities to present their viewpoints on issues
they select.

A policy of selling time to partisans would* in

our view* necessarily distort the manner in .which issues were
presented to the listening and viewing putlie.
"CBS has concluded that as a licensee in a medium
with a finite amount of time to provide news* information and
entertainment we best serve the public by presenting issues
and viewpoints within a balanced program schedule utilizing
newsworthiness as the sole criterion."
On August 5th* 1970* the Commission denied BKM*s
complaint.

Commissioner Cox made a concurring statement and

Commissioner Johnson dissented.
A week later* on August 12th* the Commission issued
a memorandum opinion in order denying the request of DNC for
declaratory ruling.

Again* Commissioner Cox concurred and

Commissioner Johnson dissented.
The Commission in its opinions did not really focus
on advertising time except in response to Commissioner
Johnson’s dissent in the DNC case and even there the
Commission appears to be talking about both programming and

7
advertisIng time.
Similarly, in the BEM opinion, the Commission does
not highlight advertising time though that was all that was
involved in BEM's complaint»
Following these decisions, BEM and DNC filed
separate appeals in the Court of Appeals.

The Federal

Communications Commission and the United States were the
respondents.

The two cases were consolidated there.

Post

Newsweek stations, American Broadcasting Companies and
Columbia Broadcasting System intervened.
The Court of Appeals reversed the decision of the
Commission in an opinion by Judge White, concurred in by
Judge Robinson and Judge McGowan filed a dissenting opinion.
The four cases now here were filed to review this
decision according to the varying interests of the seven
parties involved.

Po3t Newsweek stations filed a petition

with BEM as respondent.

Columbia Broadcasting System and

American Broadcasting Companies filed a petition — separate
petitions with DNC as respondent and the United States and
r

the Federal Communications Commission filed petitions against
both complainants, BEM and DNC.
In many respects, the positions of the United States
and the Commission on the one hand are similar to those of
the broadcasters on the other.

In particular, speaking for

the Commission and the United States, however, I should

8
point out this possible difference.

In particulars I am

interested in maintaining the proposition that this is an
area in which the Commission is properly concerned and where
it has authority to act if it should determine that affirmative.’
action on its part is appropriate.
I should let the broadcasters speak for themselves
but they would., I gather from their briefs, prefer to have it
established that the Commission cannot act at all in this
area consistently with their First Amendment rights.
This difference does not seem to me to be essential
in the present case as long as it can be determined that the
Commission acted properly when it decided not to act in these
cases.
Now, there is one more factual situation which I
should put before the Court.

While this case was pending

before the Court of Appeals on June 19th, 1971, the Commission
published a notice in the Federal Register initiating a
broad study into the efficacy of the Fairness Doctrine.

The

Commission specifically undertook the study "In the light of
current demands for access to the broadcast media to consider
issues of public concern."

The Commission noted, however,

that it could not abandon the Fairness Doctrine since that is
ratified by Act of Congress or treat broadcasters as common
carriers
What the Commission said — sought',' it said, was

9
whether- the policies it had developed are the most effective
means of fostering uninhibited, robust, wide-open debate on
public issues.
When 3 in January and February of this year, there
was a period when the mandate of the Court of Appeals in this
ease was not stayed, the Commission published a further notice
soliciting comments on the procedures gold guidelines necessary
to carry out the mandate of the Court of Appeals.

This latter

notice was withdrawn when this Court granted certiorari and
stayed the mandate of the Court of Appeals but the Commission
has continued its overall inquiry into the.Fairness Doctrine
and its operation and it has requested comments on what
policies j, If any 5 should be adopted v/lth respect to access to
the broadcast media.
It has confined its inquiry to the non-constitutional
aspects of access because the First Amendment issue was
pending before this Court.

It added that is final decision

may be delayed and made in light of the Supreme Court’s
decision.

I am advised that

this inquiry is proceeding

actively and that the problems are under current consideration
toy the Commission.
Q

Are these taking the form of hearings —

MR. GRISWOLD;

Yes, I understand both hearings and

written submissions.
Before going further it is relevant to observe that

10

the Commission has not here ordered anyone to do anything.
What it has done is simply to stay its hand.

The ultimate

question then is whether there is something in the First
Amendment which requires the Commission to order broadcasters
to accept editorial advertising regardless of their compliance
otherwise with the Fairness Doctrine.
Obviously, there is nothing literally in the First
Amendment which

leads to this result.

It can be found only

by a rather broad construction of that amendment, a construe-»
tlon, incidentally* which, if applied to the printed press,
namely that they must accept advertising offered to them at
least if paid for», would surely be regarded by them as an
abridgement of the freedom of the press contrary to the
explicit provisions of the First Amendment.
Q

Would you suggest, Mr. Solicitor General,

that if the Federal Communications Commission had this
obligation that is being sought that it would mean that the
Commission would also have to step in and put some limits on
--the amount of advertising time which could be used and at
what hours?
MR. GRISWOLD;

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, that was

clearly recognised in the opinion of the Court of Appeals
which did not decide that either of these complainants was
entitled to have its advertising broadcast.

It simply

decided that the Commission must establish means for working

11
out who could broadcast and at what times and. if there were
more people applying than there was time for, how they should
he selected.

It specifically referred to it as an

"abridgeable right to speak” and the abridgeable element in it
rose out of the fact that there is inherently a limited amount
of time available.

So as I will suggest later on, this would

put the Commission into deep entanglement with the operation
of the actual operation and the editorial judgment of the
stations.
Now, Commissioner Johnson in his dissenting opinion
intimated -- perhaps X could use a stronger word than that -that the way you deal with this was to abolish the Fairness
Doctrine and do it on a first come, first served

basis and

when the time was up, established on some basis, then nobody
else could get inv That, we think, is something which it is
very hard to find in the Constitution and something which is
very much an administrative matter which'is in the province
of Congress through its delegatee, the Commission, to
determine.

<
For that reason X say that Constitutionally I think

that this case involves more of the separation of powers than
it does of the First Amendment.

Of course, we fully agree, as

the Court said in Red Lion that the First Amendment is not
irrelevant.

The underlying problem here Is undoubtedly a

subtle one.

When dealing with a medium to which there is

12
inherently limited access what is the best way to protect
the public’s right to hear and see and learn?

Basically, in

the present state of knowledge and In the absence of any
specifically applicable provision in the First Amendment or
elsewhere in the Constitution this should be, I submit, a
problem to be worked out by Congress and without the
rigidity which would result from an extension of the First
Amendment well beyond its language.
Congress ha3 exercised its power in the Communi­
cations Act and has delegated oversight and rule making to
the Communications Commission which has been .actively and
effectively engaged in the complicated and essentially
experimental task for many years.
Q

The question of the First Amendment is not

applicable at all, is. it, unless or until broadcasters can
be equated »d.th government, state or federal?
MR. GRISWOLD:
Mr. Justicea literally.

Well, certainly that is true,
In the Red Lion case the argument

was made on behalf of the broadcasters that you can’t have
a Fairness Doctrine.
Q
their right.

Well, that is rights because they were claiming
They were equating themselves to newspapers

and they were saying that the Commission had no power to
exercise that kind of control over them.
MR. GRISWOLD:

I think, Mr. Justice

13
Q

It Is exactly the opposite side of the coin,

MR, GRISWOLD:

I thinka Mr. Justice*

that you get

into an argument about tie First Amendment when you begin to
talk about the First Amendment values.
parage First Amendment values.

Now5, I do not dis­

I think: they are very important

but the contention is made that in order to protect First
Amendment values3 you must give these Complainants an
opportunity to express their views over this medium which so
enormously multiplies their voice.

But I agree with you

literally that no one is preventing the Complainants from
exercising either their freedom to speak or their freedom of
the press —
Q

Maybe somebody is , but until a relation can

show that it is Government that

is doing ifcy the First

Amendment is not involved9 is it?
MR. GRISWOLD:

Unless the Government is under some

sort of a duty to help them to protect their First Amendment
values.

Mow3 I —•
•

Q

• A

In other words, when a newspaper turns down

an ad and says* ”We are not going to run this ad,” there
cannot possibly be any claim* can theres that that is a
i

violation of the advertiser's First Amendment right because
the Government is not preventing ita it is the newspaper
that is asserting its own right under the Constitution.
MR. GRISWOLD;

Well, I would have supposed that 'was

14
true, Mr. Justice, but Congress, on February 7th, passed a
statute giving access to political candidates to the radio
and television and included in it to the extent that any
person sells space in any newspaper or magazine to a legallyqualified candidate for federal elective office, then they
must sell space to other candidates.
Q

Well, the Constitutionality of that statement

is not of import.
MR. GRISWOLD (Overriding):

That is not her® but I —

that :Ls one reason I am a little hesitant about making what I
think I

would otherwise have made as my answer.

I think it

had always previously been understood that the press was under
no obligation whatever to print anything it didn't want to
print.
Q

In any event, if you get into whether or not

that has been understood you would agree, I would suppose,
unless I am all off on the wrong track here, that the First
..... .

Amendment is

*;* •

inapplicable unless and until you equate

broadcasters with Government, state or 'federal. Now, that
«
V;.
was done.

A company town le equated with government in March

and a shopping area was equated with government in another
case but until or unless that

step can be taken, the First

Amendment is simply not implicated.
MR. GRISWOLD:
that view.

\

Well, I would be happy to accept

There are expressions in some of the opinions, at

15
least for purposes of this case I would be happy to accept
that view.

There are expressions in some of the opinions

about First Amendment values which seem to indicate that when
there is government participation there is a brooding on the
presence of the First Amendment in the sky which must be
taken into account.
As the Court said in the Red Lion cases "If
experience with the administration of these doctrines indicates
that they have the net effect of reducing rather than
enhancing the volume and quality of coverage there will be
time enough to consider the Constitutional implications” and
I

think that is what is making me find difficulty in

answering your

question.

If it does appear in experience that this does
really prevent serious difficulltes In the public's
opportunity to learn about political candidates then I suspect
that there will be those who will raise Constitutional
arguments which will have to be answered.
But the use of the word "quality

of coverage" in

the passage seems particularly relevant here.

Under the

decision below the broadcaster loses control over the quality
of the paid advertisements which he must accept.

The present

state of experience points strongly to the conclusion that
the public is better served by giving scope to the journalis­
tic judgment of the broadcasters subject to the continued

constraint of the Fairness Doctrine.
If real experience to the contrary develops, there
will be time enough, as the Court said, to reconsider the
Constitutional implications.
As I have indicated, the Commission has the matter
now under active reconsideration in the light of experience
and of the claims which have been made.

The Commission is

acting pursuant to powers expressly assigned to it by Congress
in the exercise of its commerce power which — and other
powers — which has set up a system of broadcasting in this
country under private ownership and control subject to
regulation by the Commission,
How, Congress has expressly provided, in Section
IIIH of the Communications Act that persons engaged in
broadcasting shall not be a common carrier.

Congress has

also provided equal time for political candidates and more
recently, for a right of access for political candidates.
Congress has further provided that licensees shall
hold their licenses for three years.

It has charged the

Commission to"iis'e'the standard of the public interest in
renewing licenses and it has provided in Section IIIR,as this
Court quoted in the Red Lion opinion, a mandate to the
Commission from time to time, as public convenience, interest
or necessity requires, to promulgate such rules and
regulations and prescribe such restrictions and conditions as

17
may be necessary to carory out the provisions of this chapter.
In carrying out this charge* the Commission has
developed the reply to attack rule and the Fairness Doctrine9
both of which were upheld by this Court in Red Lion,
Q

Mr. Solicitor General* do you understand the

broadcasters5 position to rest considerably on the existence
of the Fairness Doctrine?

In the absence of the Fairness

Doctrine S take it their position might be considerably
different?
MR. GRISWOLD;
different.

I think their position might be

I think I would rather have them speak for

themselves.

I am not at all sure* though* that if this

Court had held that the Fairness Doctrine was invalid as an
undue interference and violation of the First Amendment rights
of the broadcasters* that it wouldn’t almost be an A Fortiori
case to say that they would have no rights here.
Q

Well* 1*11 put it to you this way* then.

Does

the Commission’s position rest at all on the fact that they
have promulgated and are enforcing the Fairness Doctrine?
*fhat their reluctance to order stations to receive these
advertisements rest considerably on the —
MR. GRISWOLD;

No, Mr. Justice, I don’t think it

is that they are reluctant to.

I think It is that they feel

it is not necessary and the "First Amendment value" involved
in the picture is adequately taken care of by the Fairness

Doctrine,
Q

The Commission's position is not,then, that

if the Committee’s position were upheld that the fairness
doctrine would be much more difficult to enforce?
MR. GRISWOLD:
considerable extent.

Well, yes, I think it is, to a very

I think that, as Commissioner Johnson

said in his dissenting opinion, I think it pretty much
involves the abolition of the Fairness Doctrine.
Q

So that the existence of the Fairness Doctrine

is a very substantial part of the Commission's —
MR. GRISWOLD:

It is certainly a very large element

in the overall picture.
Now, I don't understand that Red Lion was a
constitutional case in the sense that It decided that the
Fairness Doctrine was required by the First Amendment.
the contrary, it was, as I

On

see it, an administrative lav; case

holding that, the Commission under the authority granted to it
by Congress had the power to establish the Fairness Doctrine
and Congress had the power to ratify It in 1959.
Q

Well, to that extent it was a constitutional

case because the —
MR. GRISWOLD (Overriding):
Q

And as far as

-r didn't have the power to do it.

MR. GRISWOLD:

And as far as the Constitution was

involved that there was nothing in the First Amendment which

19
made the Fairness Doctrine invalid.
Q

Right.

MR. GRISWOLD:
Q

It seems to me it was a —- It was a -

The (inaudible) was a limitation upon the right

of the broadcasters.

It did not make any effort to

MR. GRISWOLD (Overriding):—whether Congress was
prevented from treating this as an administrative doctrine
because of the First Amendment.

There is no suggestion that

the stations involved in this case do not comply with the
Fairness Doctrine.

They do present discussions of controver­

's! al and political issues.

The questions is whether they must

nevertheless take spot announcements and perhaps put on
programs on public interest issues from anyone who wants to
pay for the time and then., very likely pursuant' to the
Fairness Doctrine* have to allow free time to those who want
to present the other side if no one can be found for the
presentation of the other point of view.
It is hard to think of anything which more
effectively destroys the freedom

and control of the broad­

casters* often called "the electronic press."
It is likewise hard to think that the public will
be well-served by a system which makes access to the airwaves
on controversial issues depend in material extent on who has
the money to pay for it and perhaps on who has the most money
as the price is bid up.

20
As Judge McGowan said in the court below, "That
approach does not seem to me to be a promising one in terms
of the public’s right to know," and he added, ,!It is hardly
the part of wisdom to scrap our present system of private
broadcasting for a system in which money alone determines
what items are to be aliped and in what format. ”

Are these not issues of the sort that Congress
should determine with the aid of the agency in the light of
experience and without premature constitutional restraint?
The Fairness Doctrine has been developing for more
than 40 years.

This has been done under the watchful eye of

this Court and with recognition,as this Court said in the
Pottsville Broadcasting case, that the administrative process
should possess sufficient flexibility to adjust itself to
the rapidly fluctuating factors characteristic of the evolution
of broadcasting.
Through the Fairness Doctrine as it has developed,
there is a clear duty on the broadcaster but he is still a
private businessman a3 a part of a deliberately adopted system
of private broadcasting and he is not only free but obligated
to exercise his journalistic discretion.
The considered and experienced judgment of the
Commission that this is not a situation in which it should
take affirmative action should be upheld and accordingly, the
judgment below should be reversed.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Solicitor

General.
Mr. Jennes.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERNEST W. JENNES9 ESQ.a
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. JENNES:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Mr. Wallenberg and I have divided the issues we
will argue.

I will briefly supplement the Solicitor General’s

description of how the present system works and* assuming
but not conceding state action, will treat the First
Amendment issues.
Mr. VJollenberg will argue the state action issue
which Mr. Justice Stewart has raised, the commercial
discrimination equal protection issue and the question of
statutory construction.
It would perhaps be helpful if I review briefly
some pertinent aspects of broadcasting and their relationship
to First Amendment interests.
DNC would have this Court view broadcasting as a
virtually monolithic institution in which there are three
network presidents who decide what the American people will
hear and when and how but this is not the way it works.

As

the networks briefs show, this is a caricature of how the
networks handle news and information but more important, some

22

7,000 individual broadcasters are entrusted with the
responsibility of fairly informing the public and these
independent stations and the many individual and often
partisan voices that speak through these 7S000 stations
provide diverse ideas and opinions to the public.
Q

Does the failure of

a

licensee to observe

the Fairness Doctrine to give a balanced picture sometimes
become an issue when they come up for renewal of a license?
MR. JENNES:

It has indeed and the Commission's

refusal to renew a license on that ground was recently sus­
tained by the Court of Appeals.

Fairness Doctrine complaints

are ever present and the Commission rules on them-and the
broadcasters are very aware of the problem.
Q

You are suggesting that is a sufficient control

oyer balancing as against unbalanced programs?
MR. JENNES:

I am suggesting that there/is no

evidence — I will show, I believe, that there is no evidence
that the system as it exists has been abused and, accordingly,
that assuming the First Amendment question that Congress and
••

*•••

,•*

•;

•••-

.•

*•

.

the Commission have not exercised a choice which serves the
interest of the First Amendment through the

Fairness Doctrine.

Public exposure to conflicting views in parties arid
voices is advanced by the

Fairness Doctrine and the related

requirements of the Communications Act.
Each station is responsible for determining from the

23
public on a continuing basis what It» the public., and
representative groups and organizations regard as public issue
needs and interests.

There is discretion to present these

viewpoints in a variety of ways, including hard news,
commentaries, special events coverage„ documentaries and the
like.

But very importantly, for these cases where access is

being argued, stations must include, under the Commission’s
Fairness Doctrine, as part of the mix, representative partisan
spokesmen on controversial issues.
Now» subject to these trusteeship obligations, each
broadcaster exercises a Journalistic function in selecting and
balancing subjects, formats, and speakers for the very purpose
of assuring that a significant variety of important issues
and competing viewpoints is effectively presented.
Some sell time for commercials to partisans.

Others

do not sell time but provide access to partisan views without
charge in their normal programming.

How this system ’.forks to

serve First Amendment purposes is well-demonstrated in the
BEM case itself.
The uncontroverted record is that the various
aspects of the Vietnam issue were repeatedly covered in WTOP's
news» Information and public affairs programs.

Moreover,

numerous partisan spokesmen had access In fact to YJTOP without
charge to express their varying views in varying ways.
Every viewpoint in the 14 different samples of

BEM’s

24
commercials for which BEM sought to buy time on WiOP was, in
fact, expressed over that station and, furthermore, several
stations in the area with different policies carried BEM’ s
commercials.
It would thus, I submit, be incredible to suggest
that VJTOP deprived the public of access to the ideas which are
advocated by BEM.
Mow, this Court has repeatedly stated that the
central purpose of the First Amendment is to preserve a
market-place of ideas for the American people and it is longemphasised that the First Amendment must work differently, in
different contexts and when this Court defined the First
Amendment interest in broadcasting in Red Lion,, it was the
public’s right to receive suitable access to social, political,
aesthetic, moral and other, ideas and experiences on which the
Court focused.

In Red Lion, it was the public’s right to

know, not the Individual’s right to speak, which controlled.
Because of broadcasting’s limited capacity, Congress
and the Commission may constitutionally subordinate private
claims

to paramount public interests,

whether those claims

are advanced by broadcasters themselves, as in Red Lion or on
behalf of individuals who want to speak their views.
There are simply more individuals who want to
broadcast than there are frequencies to accommodate them.
There are simply more subjects to report on and treat than

25
time will permit.
Q

There must be responsible choice.

Aren*t there frequencies

still not taken up

in lots of places in the country?
MR. JENNES:

There are in some places in the

country and in UHF televisions there are many areas in the
country where no frequency is available in radio.

The

situation varies from community to community„ area to area.
Q

But you think that predicate is generally still

true enough to warrant a Commission regulation like —
MR. JENNES (Overriding):

Well, Mr. Justice White,

I am assuming that «->■*• you mean the Fairness Doctrine?

I

assume that ~ that the — that the issue of the constitution­
ality of the Fairness Doctrine was

disposed of in Red Lion

and I am assuming further for purposes of my argument that
there is state action.
Q

I know, but you are still asserting here that

there is a limited capacity in the television medium.
MR. JENNES:

Well, I am asserting that — that an

individual radio or television station has a limited amount of
time and responsible choice has to be made as to what is going
to be covered in that time.
Q

Well, you are also assuming that there is a

limited spectrum of frequencies to be licensed by the
Federal Governxsient.
MR. JENNES:

I presume -**
That is correct.

26
Q

— that is the — that has been the rationale

since 1927s the Radio Act, and that has been the rationale
of every decision on the subject in this Court» hasn’t it?
MR, JENNES:

That is correct and that is precisely

why the Act has placed the responsibility on the individual
broadcaster as a trustee and that — that term has been
repeated and repeated.

The obligation of the broadcaster as

a trustee, subject to the Fairness Doctrine and subject to
other requirements to inform the public clearly about
controversial issues of public importance.
Q

Well, 1 understood Mr. Justice. White’s

question as going to unclaimed potential stations.

Now, are

there any or very many unclaimed in large market areas?
MR. JENNES:

There are not very many in large market

areas, Mr. Chief Justice and I take it that the — that the
holding of the court below and that the position of the
Respondents in this case would not vary from city to city or
state to state.

What they are claiming is that — that broad­

casters may not, as a matter of policy, refuse to sell time
for editorial commercials.
Now, the Respondents —,I suggest that, to the
extent there is a constitutional requirement, that that
requirement has been served by the system as it operates.
Now, the Respondents would have this Court create* a neif
constitutional right without a showing of any

abuse

27
requiring vindication and I think it is very important to
emphasize that their arguments depend on factual propositions
of dubious validity at best advanced in their briefs for the
first times never submitted to the Commissions that the
Fairness Doctrine does not work adequately, that their
proposal is fair and efficient and would not have significant
adverse effects.
I would suggest that the very heavy burden on those
who would establish new constitutional principles was not
met by selected examples in Appellate briefs.
On the other hand, the constitutional right urged
by BEM and DNC would pose very serious practical and legal
problems and would disserve First Amendment interests by
increasing the influence of the wealthy and powerful by
resulting in distortion and by impairing the broadcasters
capacity to provide balanced

coverage of issues and by

increasing government control over the flow of information.
Such a new constitutional right would greatly
advantage the else of the pocketbook
is broadcast.

in determining what

There is a tendency to think of the implications

of these cases in terras of organizations like BEM or the
Navy League or the ADA or the John Birch Society but this new
right, if it were established, would require broadcasters to
permit a host of commercial advertisers to spend in the
neighborhood of a billion and a half dollars a year on the

28
networks and another billion dollars a year in national
television advertising to use their television and radio
commercials for the expression of views on controversial
issues that serve their business interests and their other
interests rather than to sell their products and services.
Mow, it is apparently a common policy of broad­
casters not to permit advertisers to do this now.
The court below and all the parties recognise that
it would not serve the public interest in free speech if the
expression

of views in editorial advertising time were

dominated by those who can most afford to pay or if the
newly asserted constitutional right resulted in imbalanced
treatment of public Issues and the lower court fell back, as
the Solicitor General said, on the Fairness Doctrine for an
answer but this would exascerbate the problem.

If a broad­

caster balance which Judge Wright described as a one-sided
flood of editorial advertisements by presenting contrary
viewpoints, he would have to divert time from or ignore
other subjects which warranted attention.

The result, the

agenda of news and other information presented to the
American people would be determined

by the purchasers of

editorial advertisements,
Q

That is because of the

MR. JENNES:

Cullman rule?

Not nee — that is because of the

necessity of the Fairness Doctrine itself.

29
Q

And the Cullman rule exascerbates it?
«■MMMOUMnBWMtM

MR, JENNES:
is that a -

Exactly.

Exactly,

VJhat I arn suggesting

that a heavy flight of commercials would create

an obligation to respond and then clearly one is left under
Cullman.
Q

Right.

MR. JENNES:

Moreover, increasing involvement of

the government cannot be avoided if editorial advertising is
made compulsive and innumberable questions would arise as to
the permissable subject of advertisements, the content of
particular ads and the like.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

YoUr time is up In a

few minutes.
MR. JENNES:

Let me conclude by saying that the

threat of Intimate, direct, and pervasive government
regulation of broadcast content would be serious and there is
literally nothing before this Court to require it to say that
these hasards must be suffered, and irreversibly, because of
a constitutional command.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr*. Wollenberg.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. ROGER WOLLENBURG, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. WOLLENBERG:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I appear on behalf of the Petitioner, Columbia

30

Broadcasting System,

1 think that the able arguments which

have preceded have made clear, I hope, what is before this
Court and what is not before this

Court,

As we see it,

there is not here today any question of the Commission's
power to take affirmative action in the access area if it
should, on appropriate basis, determine that such action
was necessary♦

What we have here, as the Solicitor General

has made clear, a decision of the Court of Appeals which,
through the enunciation of a new constitutional doctrine has,
in effect, resulted in the substitution of the judgment of the
Court of Appeals for that of the agency on the erroneous
premise that the First Amendment requires the government to
compel broadcasters to provide paid advertising on demand.
Now, 1 should like to make clear that, contrary to
the impression that the Solicitor General may have had, the
broadcast petitioners in this case are not here asking for a
ruling by this
Commission.

Court that would limit the powers of the

What we are asking for here is a reversal of th®

decision below, a decision which creates a constitutional
strait jacket that binds the Commission and, indeed, the
Congress, for all time.
Q

You don't intend to contend that your client’s

constitutional rights were violated by the decision, though?
MR. WCLLENSERG:
contention, your Honor

No, we have not made that

31
The Solicitor General quoted Judge

Me Gov; an and I

think what he —
Q

That contention would be similar to the

contention that was made by the -broadcasters in Red Lion.

It

is not made here.
MR. WOLLENBERG:

And let me say, your Honor, that

I associate myself with Mr. Jennesf statement that we are —
we accept Red Lion, though we are not here undercutting Red
Lion and that, to the contrary, we suggest that the trustee
fairness scheme,created by Congress and the Commission and
upheld in Red Lion, would foe diminished, hampered and
frustrated by the holding of the court below.
Q

Well, Mr. Wollenberg, I take it from the

responses of the broadcasters that they relied on the Fairness
Doctrine, to some extent at least, as justification for the
refusal of selling advertisement?
MR. WOLLENBERG:

I don’t know, your Honor, whether I

would use the word "justification."

I would say this, that

the broadcasters having been told, very clearly, in the
•

announcements of the Commission and the announcements of this
1 Court in Red Lion, that they have a responsibility to achieve
fairness and that thi3 is a responsibility not only to
present the varying sides of issues, to present the individual
views of representative spokesmen of issues and not only those
two, but also to affirmatively see that they cover Important

32
public Issues , that with those three very substantial
responsibilities whichs as the Chief Justice has pointed out,
may lead to a denial of license

if you do not carry them out,

those very substantial responsibilities, some broadcasters -not all -— some broadcasters, including Columbia Broadcasting
System, have concluded that the best way to effectuate and
Implement and carry out those responsibilities is not, as
Judge McGowan said, to scrap the existing mechanism for a
system in which money alone determines

what Issues are to

be aired*
In other words, Columbia Broadcasting System, over
a long period of years, has concluded and believes from its
experience that it is not the best way to coyer issues, to
simply sell time to those who desire to and are able to
purchase time.

This does not mean that everything is filtered

through a CBS point of view or that the individual views of
representative spokesmen are not given.

They are given daily

in news broadcasts, regularly on news interview? programs, mid,
as occasion warrants it, extensively and directly, for
example, in very extensive coverage of the national political
conventions.
So it is not a matter of declining to let people
spealc through their own mouths, It is a matter of attempting
to plan, to organise, so as to achieve these heavy respon­
sibilities of covering the issues, providing information for

33
the publics of providing balance* of providing the various
sides,
Q

Well* Mr. Wollenberg, what is your view?

Is

there a First Amendment problem here or not in the sense of
there being or not being some state action or Federal
Government action?
MR. WOLLENBERG:

It is our position, which I hope

to get into at a little greater length —
Q

All right* but you can answer now.

MR, WOLLENBERG: — after the luncheon recess* but it
is our position that there is not state action here and that
there not being state action, that that is an alternative
ground for reversal of the judgment below because the First
Amendment question does not arise unless there is state
action.

It is our view that, for the reasons that we set

forth at some length in our opening brief, that even

prior to

last term that the standards properly applied -- for state
action —*» before governmental intervention or governmental
involvement rises to the constitutional place of state action
there must be a compulsion, an inducement, a-participation —
those are catch words but they summarise the areas.
i

We .made those points Ih our opening brief and in our
i
reply brief we pointed out that we think that the attenuated
j

reliance of the court below on some general* language in
Burton and Wilmington and Public Utilities Commission against

34
Pollacka but that reliance was misplaced in light of the
decision of this Court at the last term in Moose Lodge,
Q

Mr, Wollenberg, during lunch maybe you can

think fo the answer to this questions do you think there is
any difference in a test of state action when you are dealing
with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment
as in Burton from the test applicable when you are dealing
with the First Amendment as in Marsh or the Shopping Center
case9 or should the tests be identical?
MR. WOLLEMBERQ;

Uh —

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

I think we will let you

respond to that later.
(Whereupon, a recess was taken for luncheon from
11:51 o8clock a.m, to 1:00 ofclock p.m.)

AFTERNOON SESSION
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

1:00 p.m.

Mr. Woilenberg, you may

proceed.
MR. WOLLENBERG:

Before attempting a. response to

the open book examination question that was left with me at
the recess, and concluding my discussion of state action, I
would like to emphasise again, lest there be any misunderstan­
ding 9 what we are not contending.
We are not contending, on the basis of our state
action argument, that the lack of state action as we see it
takes this area outside of the power of the Federal
Communications Commission,

Ws are arguing that there is not

the state action that gives rise to a constitutional right in
the Respondents to demand the system which

Judge. McGowan

lists correctly described as a "constitutional strait jacket."
Now, with respect to Mr. Justice Stewart’s question,
let me say first that I don’t think that any possible shades of
’difference in standards would be controlling or, indeed,
,

; ’

’

.

•

V;

material here because I think by any standard's that there is
Y .
a lack of state action* But on the specific question of the
i
Equal Protection Clause in the State Action Standard versus
the First Amendment Standard, I think that if there is a
difference, it is not a difference between the two
amendments, but is a difference, perhaps, between the Equal
Protection Clause as applied in racial discrimination kind of

oases and other cases, whether they be First Amendment or
Equal Protection.

I think that the long history of the Equal

Protection Clause and the enactment of the Fourteenth Amend­
ment to give force to the Civil Rights cases,

Civil Rights

Acts, in case they should be declared unconstitutional, that
the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment was designed not
only to end historic policies of state action to enforce
segregation and enforce different treatment, to the blacks,
but it was also designed to assure that no private action
under color of state law should achieve that effect.
So I think that there is a special consideration
that applies in the racial cases.
Mow, I said before the luncheon recess that we think
that the cases before Moose Lodge established the correctness
of our position, that Moose Lodge merely reaffirmed it.

We

have briefed the question rather extensively in our opening
brief and in our reply brief and because of the limitations
of time, 1 3hould like simply to say why, in this particular
situation, we don't think you have any kind of government
participation, encouragement, compulsion or approval.
A close reading of the Commission Vs very thoughtful
and very articulato opinion in these cases makes clear that
the Commission was not saying that it didn't, want broadcasters
to sell time for controversial Issues, to sell advertising
time.

It was not saying that it approved broadcasters who

36
did that and would be more likely to renew their licenses
than those who sold such time.
The Commission was not telling broadcasters to do.
What the Commission was saying — and I think very correctly
was that it would be inappropriate for it to issue an order
of compulsion to broadcasters because it would interfere with
their ability to carry forth their trustee responsibility of
achieving the Fairness Doctrine in their own way and it might
indeed impede it and those who wished to sell advertising
time may do so but they still have the responsibility of
carrying out the Fairness Doctrine and those who wish not to
may

do so but they still have the responsibility of carrying

out the Fairness Doctrine including that portion of the
Fairness Doctrine which requires that

partisan views be

given expression and not be filtered out in the presentation
process.
Q

Mr, Wollanberg, don’t you at least have this dif*

Terence between Lloyd and Moose Lodge on the one hand and
the situation of the broadcaster on the othera that the
vV ■:

'

/ ;

' license which he holds is really a performance proper is made
possible only by governmental exclusion of other potential
t

broadcasters whereas my recollection of both Lloyd and Moose
was that the private individuals were dealing with their own
private property.
MR, WOLLEWBERG:

Well, of course, in Moose Lodge

at

37
least one dissent argued that the number of liquor licenses
were limited in the state but it is perfectly true that you
have licensees here and that broadcasters can only broadcast
if they hold licenses, but it is also true that the congres­
sional and Commission regime that was upheld in Red Lion
answered that scarcity

and limited number of licensees by

placing on the broadcasters a heavy kind of responsibility
that newspapers, for example, do not have and

it is that

Fairness Doctrine responsibility and that implementation of
the public’s right to know which is the B'irst Amendment
interest that was stressed in Red Lion» not the right of an
individual to get on the mike, because there are a limited
number of hours, a limited number of days, a limited number of
stations but the right of the public to know and this Court
unanimously in Red Lion held that the regime adopted by
Congress and the Commission of assuring that the public’s
right to know would be satisfied, was a legitimate and a
reasonable scheme.
What we are arguing here is that the decision below,
as the Commission said, by compelling a particular type of
activity would frustrate and interfere with that responsibility.
I turn now to one of the principal contentions
of the Respondents and holding of the court below that there
is some kind of a constitutional invidious discrimination
involved in the practice that the Commission has declined to

38
prohibit and whether you call this a First Amendment
violation or an Equal Protection violation, the contention is
that if you sell

time

for a commercial advertisement,

advertising time, you cannot refuse sale time for controversial
speech.
Now, we suggest that that is not a valid contention.
We suggest that

commercial matter and controversial matter

are treated very differently under the Act because of the
affirmative responsibility — under the Fairness Doctrine
and Rad Lion, as I have mentioned — to cover controversial
«»■ i ' HIM—W—

issues so that the broadcaster who won’t let the controversial
issue into his advertising time also keeps the commercial
broadcaster out of his program time.

The Commission will not
4

allow broadcasters to have program-length commercials so that
what actually happens is that under the scheme of the

Act

and the Commission’s rules, controversial speech is given a
preferred position as against commercial speech.
This does not mean that any individual has the
right to come and demand that he can put on a commercial.

No

individual has a right to demand that he come and be given
time on the air.

In both cases, the broadcaster exercises

discretion.
t
V

.

>'-Av .* *C.'-

The cases which have been relied upon by the

Respondents in the court below, we submit, are not
controlling their lower court cases dealing with busses where

39
you have no system of Information other than the advertising
space and

state-supported or state-partially-supported

newspapers and in the newspaper cases there is a conflict with
the Avins and Rutgers case in the Third Circuit which 3ays
that there is no right of access to a journalistic medium
even where it Is supported by the state.
We think that those cases are not in point here.
What is in point here is that there is a reasonable
classification

if you will, a reasonable determination that

has been made by the broadcasters in which the agency charged
with expertise in the field has found to be not unreasonable,
if the broadcaster wants to do it that way, as a method of
achieving

his Fairness obligations.
One final point:

Mr, Jennes emphasised some of the

dangers of an unrestricted right of purchase of time and he
pointed out that it is not just the organizations that are
interested in getting on but we also have commercial
advertisers.
Now, there is about a billion and a half dollars of
network, television, commercial advertising sale during the
course of a year and if you say that there is a constitutional
right put into your advertisement, controversial issue matter,
then presumably that billion and a half dollars of
commercial advertising can include as much as any given
commercial advertiser desires to do.

Most broadcasters today

make ar. effort not to include, in their commercial advertising
such materials.

^

Now, we have pointed to examples of cases where
broadcasters have not•complied with that or cases where the
line has been crossed in what appeared to be a product
commercial slopped over into an advocacy of a position and in
that case the Fairness Doctrine applies but most broadcasters
today make the effort to make that distinction.

I think it

is a very important distinction because I think that an
agenda would indeed, as the Commission said, be set by the
affluence if we set up a constitutional principle of this
■

,

\

kind and 1 don't think that any amount of balancing by the
broadcaster could unskew what had been skewed in that fashion.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Wollenberg

Mr. Califano.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH A. CALIFANO, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR, CALIFANO:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
I will deal with the DNC case and my colleague,
Mr. Asher, will deal with the BEM case.
As far as the Democratic National Committee is
concerned, the issue before this Court, the central question,
is the same central question we began dealing with with the
networks in March and April of 1970 and with the FCC in the

Hi
late spring of that year.

It is, are the public airwaves,

which are the most powerful and forceful means of communication
in our democratic society, the greatest democracy in the
world, are these airwaves to be used to promote the sale of
soap, deodorants, mouthwashes mid brassieres and not to
promote the exchange of ideas and the legal issue is whether
the

Federal Communications Commission, consistent with the

Communications Act and the First Amendment to the Consti­
tution, can permit the three major- networks and the 7S000
broadcasters of this nation to impose an absolute ban on all
radio and television broadcasts paid for by the,.,major political
parties if they discuss controversial issues of public
importance?
The rule we asked for is a very simple rule.

It

simply requested the Commission, and I quote "That a broad­
caster may not, as a general policy, refuse to sell time to
responsible entities such as the Democratic National
Committee for the solicitation of funds and for comment on
public issues."
Q

The —Mr, Califano, would you care to define

"responsible entities?"
MR, CALIFANO:

Your Honor, we use that —

Mr. Justice, we use that phrase in the rule because it is the
phrase used by the communications industry and the FCC under
the

Fairness Doctrine and where they present an editorial

view on one side and say that responsible spokesmen are
invited to answer that editorial on the other side.
Q

That is certainly not the concept we have of

many of the developments to the First Amendment, is it?
MR. CALIFANO:
Q

I think the relevance —

It doesn't allow government to control the

speech of their responsible people, does it?
MR. CALIFANQ:

No, Mr. Justice, it does not and as

far as we are concerned, the only possible difference between
the —* well, let me put it this way — I suppose the point
of using that phrase and not simply asking that the DMC or
the two major political parties be granted a time was that
we recognized that the FCC will have to establish some
reasonable regulations along the lines.
Q

Mr. Califano, while we have stopped at this,

would it be reasonable and appropriate for the Federal
Communications Commission under your formulation to say, yes,
the network or the station must make that time available on
those terms provided that they make an equal amount of time
available within the same five-minute span for the contrary,
the 45 seconds against something and then that they must allow
45 seconds plug right afterward eontraryminded.
MR, CALIFANO:

'Well, the *— you know, Mr. Chief

Justice, we have uh — the Fairness Doctrine would still
operate, as we see our rule, it would operate alongside of it

and to the extent that issues were not covered or that other
spokesmen wanted to deal with the very same issue, we would
think the networks should indeed permit them to do so.
In response to the question of whether they should
go back-to-back with it* we have argued in a whole series of
other matters that , with the networks and with the
Communications Commission, about that right, and the only
time — the only time we have ever been granted that was when
Senator Muskie and President Nixon spoke back-to-back in 1970
on Election Eve,
Aside from that, we have never been able to
establish that as a right and I would have to say that I
don’t

think it is recognised as a right by the FCC or most

people in the comnmnications area.
Q

Well, wouldn't this hypothetical situation I

just suggested be an implementation in a precise way of what
the Fairness Doctrine is driving at?
MR» CALIFANO:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, yes.

that is certainly one way to do it-.

I think what 1 am

saying is that it is not the only way.
any number of reasonable solutions.

That —

There are probably

The Commission has found

any number of reasonable solutions to deal with the Fairness
Doctrine.
Q

Well, first of all, would this be a

reasonable solution?

MR. CALIFANO:

Yes, your Honor.

The Solicitor General stated the proceedings below
and I will not repeat them but with one exception,

I think

it is important to note that the Federal Communications
Commission granted part of the DNC request.

The Federal

Communications Commission said that a broadcaster could not
refuse, as a general policy, to accept spot announcements
for the solicitation of funds.

It denied the rule we

requested insofar as that rule involved the discussion of
controversial issues of public Importance and the Con-mission
opinion below in no way attempted to tell us how to make
that distinction, even in a 60*~oecorid spot soliciting funds
for a political party.
The Court of Appeals affirmed the Federal
Communications Commission insofar as it granted us the right
t'o purchase spot announcements and solicit funds and
reversed the Federal Communications Commission holding that
an absolute ban, which is what we are talking about

an

absolute ban by the broadcasters and the networks violated
the Communications Act and the First Amendment to the
Constitution.
Q

Is it that clear that the court*s-holding was

statutory as well as constitutional?
MR, CALIFANO:

They specifically state» Mr. Justice

Relinquist, in the opinion that whether the opinion is

considered based on the Communications Act or the First
Amendment is a matter of little import since the Communications
Acts as the Court of Appeals read it, incorporates the same
First Amendment values.
The broadcasters and the FCC opinion blesses their
attitude in this case.

The broadcasters, in a sense, and

precisely are saying that they have the right to Impose an
absolute ban, that they can explain to the American
what the

people

vlexfs of the Democratic Party are, what the views of

the Republican Party are or what the views of any individual
i

spokesman for them are, better than that spokesman can do it
themselves and in the age of double-think and euphemistic
doubletalk that we live in, they call it "journalistic
intervention.”

They say that —

:'

> ■ i •'£ i

Q

Well, let’s assume that — just* dealing with

the First Amendment plain out, now — forget the Communications
Act — if these broadcasters were newspapers, surely they
would be wholly correct in that point of view, wouldn't they?
HR. CALIFANO:

Yes, Mr. Justice, they would be, but

they are not newsapers.
Q

They would be in their absolute right under

the First Amendment, wouldn’t they?
f

MR. CALIFANO:
Q

Newspapers?

As —

Just answer that question.

MR. CALIFANO:

Yes, it would be their right and

Q

Just to make sure I understand.

MR. CALIFANO: — privately-owned newspapers would
have that right.

I note that that Is precisely a point that

the Solicitor General made in the argument he made on the
Red Lion case; he distinguished broadcasters from newspapers.
Q

Certainly they are different, but I just want

to be sure that you go at least that far under the First
Amendment that if these were ordinary, if these were newspapers
they would have an absolute right to print what they wanted
arid to refuse to print what anybody wanted them to,
government or private individual.
MR. CALIFANO:
Q

That is their First Amendment right.

That would be

MR. CALIFANO:
Q

That is correct,

And that would be a First Amendment right.

MR. CALIFANO;
Q

Wouldn’t that be true?

the reason they had that right.

That is corrects, Mr. Justice Stewart.

Right.

MR. CALIFANO:

The Communications Act, 1 might note,

on that point specifically notes in Section 301 that the FCC,
•which grants licenses to broadcasters to provide for the use
of such channels may not provide for the ownership of those
channels.

Specifically dealing with that point, newspapers

are privately owned.

The channels of broadcasting —

broadcasting is about as regulated as any Industry in this
country and I guess the point — we might as well deal for a

moment deal with the questions on state action.
As fan as we are concerneds as we have laid out in
our brief,» we think there is clearly state action in the
action of a broadcaster.

There is a federal statute Involved

with a public interest standard.

The federal statute

preserves the public ownership of the airways, permitting
licenses for relatively

short and temporary periods of time.

We are dealing in this case with an order of a
federal regulatory agency, the Federal Communications
Commission, which in turn is dealing with rights of exercise
over public property.

The government cannot avoid respon­

sibility — the Federal Government — for what is at issue
simply because it puts them in permissive terms and, to sum
it up in the words of one commentator cited in our brief, !'the
federal regulatory system is an much responsible for the
existence of the broadcasting medium as the Bureau of
Engraving is responsible for the existence of U.3. currency.”
Q

Well3 I have always been under the impression,

Mr. Califano, that the legislative history of the Act negates
the idea of governmental control of the content.
Is that not true?
MR. CALl'FANO:

Yes,

your Honor, the Section 326 of

the Act prohibits the Commission from interfering with the
right of free speech by means of radio-communication but
what we are asking for is not that the broadcaster or the

48
Commission — that the Commission start saying what the
content of any broadcasting program might be.

What we are

asking for is that the broadcaster be required to recognize
our First Amendment right to have some access — we don’t
ask for every minute of every day — and experience in this
area would indicate that nobody is going to take anything ~~
any large„ enormous amounts of time.
Something, I might say, in the legislative history —
some of the legislative history on this very point — is
laid out in our brief.

The FCC already, in effect, regulates

something about spokesmen in the Fairness Doctrine.
This Court in Red Lion has recognized that some
spokesmen, at least when they are personally attacked, have
a right to appear on television and what we are asking for
Is not inconsistent with what the PCC said a generation ago
and in 1945, for example, in the United Broadcasting case
which involved the right of a cooperative or a labor union to
have some access to television, I quote one sentence from the
Commission’s opinion: "The Commission is of the opinion that
the operation of any station under the extreme principles
that no time shall be sold for the discussion of controversial
public issues and that only charitable organizations and
certain commercial interests may solicit memberships is
inconsistent with the concept of public interest established
by the Communications Act as the criterion for radio

49
regulation.
We are not asking for anything new In this case.
There are other cases subsequent to that which, in effect,
agree with it.

We believe, as we indicate in our brief, that

this case can be decided on the basis of the Communications
Act and it is not necessary for this Court to go to the
First Amendment issue.
We lay out our analysis of the legislative history
of the early communications opinions, of Section 326

of the

Communications Act and of Section 301.
As far as the common carrier point, which is made
only briefly here in oral argument by the broadcasters, is
concerned, we would note simply that our view of that
provision is that it was designed to distinguish telegraph
and telephone companies which are handled by Title II of the
Communications Act from broadcasters which are handled by
Title III and, moreover, the rule we asked for is not a right
to automatic access for the Democratic Party 'or any particular
Individual.

It recognizes that judgments must be made.

But

we believe that the broadcasters and the FCC can make a
judgment short of absolutely banning us from the air.
With respect to the constitutional points —
Q

Insofar as your argument does rely on the

First Amendment, that seems to me an extraordinary thing to
say, that Government can make judgments as to what it will

49 -A
suppress and what it won't.

That is exactly what the First

Amendment does not permit, isn't it?
MR. CALIFANO:

Judgment today — we do recognise

that there are a limited number of hours in the day.

We

recognise that there are only three networks in this country.
Q

Yes.

MR. CALIFANO:

We recognise that most communities

only have a certain number, a relatively certain number —
Q

Well, we have a finite spectrum.

MR. CALIFANO:
Q

So we have a —

Then you say that the broadcasters, which you

equate to Government, can say — must say, we’ll let you
■speak because you are responsible, but may say we won’t let
you speak because you are irresponsible.

Now, that is an

extraordinary limitation of the First Amendment of the
United States Constitution, it seems to me.
MR. CALIFANO:

What — what — Mr. Justice Stewart,

• I am not saying it in those terms.

What I am Saying is this,

that recognizing we have a finite resource, re.oo'gyiizlng as
:this Court did in Red Lion that we are talking about because
of that, in some sense-, an abridgeable First Amendment right —
Q

That is a contradiction in terms, isn’t it?

MR. CALIFANO:

Well, that is the language of the

unanimous opinion of the Court.
Q

That language of the First Amendment says,

50
'’Congress shall not abridgedoesn’t it?
MR. CALIFANO:

Yes, it does, but the — but the

writers of the First Amendment — uh — well, let me put it
this way, I think we have to deal with the realities of a
medium that we now havej the realities of that medium are that
it ±3 limited.
What is happening today is that the broadcasters
are simply saying that if you are peddling commercial items
you have a right to buy time.

If you want to peddle

political ideas or political parties, you have no right to buy
time and. we say that there is something less than that kind
of outrageous discrimination and less than an absolute ban
that the broadcasters can operate under.

I think that it —•

you know, to say the whole broadcasting system will collapse
if this Court or anyone opens up the airwaves to people or
political parties to discuss controversial issues is
contrary to all the experience that we have.
The newspapers and the magazines of this country
are not filled with political advertisements.

Corporations

that advertise their television sets and their automobiles
and their department stores and their grocery items in the
newspapers of this country

have not taken the billions and

billions of dollars they spent in newspapers and simply
turned it over to the discussion of public issues,

I don’t

think there is — I think the wealthy man is a straw man of

51
very thin proportions and I think that anyone that has
attempted to find these wealthy men to buy television time
for the discussion of controversial issues by the major
political parties, at least — and I would daresay it would
be more difficult for others ■— has found out that there is
not a barrel of money out there waiting to be spent.
We are not going to face this problem.

We do have

to recogniaes howevers the broadcast medium is a limited
medium,
«

As far as — we believe that the Red lion, in its
language — we believe our First Amendment right for direct
communication is strong and involves the right of direct
communication.

We think there is no substitute for that.

I

don’t think anyone in this chamber could believe that It is
the same thing to have Walter Cronkite

or John Chancellor

or Roger Mudd explain what President Nixon said as it is to
have President Nixon make his direct appeal.
assert that If Walter Cronkite

Would anyone

had laid out the reasons

why President Nixon invaded Cambodia the American support for
that would have gone from 5 percent to 70 percent?

Can

anyone assert that there Is some journalistic Intervention
that could have made the case for the Gulf of Tonkin
Resolution of President Johnson more effectively than he
could have made it?

Should the broadcasters or Mr. Wollenberg

or Mr. Jennes, would they like to

have Frank Reynolds or

52
Frank Reynolds or Walter Cronkite come up here and explain
what they are trying to tell the Court?

The point is that

this is the medium of communication in this country.

It has

a greater impact on our political dialog and ow? electoral
system than any other form available to any person or party
in this country and we simply want to write •— we want a rule
that simply says to the broadcasters, "You cannot say that
no political party can purchase time on television for the
discussion of controversial issues."
Q

You are not suggesting, Mr. Califano, that all

networks and all stations are now exercising such a limitation,
are you?
MR. CALIFANO:

Well, your Honor, we have been

through a whole series of rules on that.

There are a

variety of rules in that area right now.

Some networks and

stations have policy which says that during election periods
time can be purchased by candidates or people on behalf of
candidates.
Q

And spot announcements, too.

MR. CALIFANO:

And spot announcements may be

purchased during this period.

But outside of those periods

you may not do that.
Q

In other words, when there is no campaign —

election campaign on.
about.

That is what you are complaining

53
MR. CALIFAMO:

That is correct.

That is correct.

The rules, indeed, of the networks in this case changed, at
various points of this proceedings. CBS initially took the
position, for example, that they would not sell time except
during election periods a:ad then only to candidates, either
spot time or programming time, and they denied us
programming time.
Three months later when the FCC — after they filed
our case, CBS said they would change the rule and they would
permit spot announcements simply to raise funds but not to
discuss controversial issues.
Eight months later when we were in the Court of
Appeals, CBS said that it would now permit spot announcements
-

;.Vu

for us to discuss controversial issues, announcements of 60
seconds or less and to raise funds, but no more and in part,
I might say, it seems to us that it is not

you know, we

should not have to depend on how. CBS executives feel on any
given morning at any given stage of the legal proceedings as
to what our rights are to express our views to the American
people over the medium that 95 percent of the American homes
find as their greatest source of information and news in this
country.
I have made the discrimination point in term3 of
spot announcements.

I believe the same kind of discrimination

exists in the programming area as we wait out'below and here.

It seems to me that — that all programming — people can
buy programming.

Religious organisations can buy programming

but the two major political parties cannot buy programming.
Q

Well, they can buy it if the networks sell It.

MR. CALIFANO:
Q

If the networks sell It.

There is no rule, is there, of the Commission

that .requires the networks to sell it to religious organisa­
tions?
MR. CALIFANO:

Not to my knowledge.

Not to my

knowledge.
Q

The question is here the freedom of the network

to — or the stations, the broadcasters, to sell or not to
sell, isn’t it?
MR. CALIFANO: Well, no, Mr. Justice Stewart, they
are right to absolutely prohibit this kind of discussion.
Q

Yes, they are right on the general rule that

we will not sell time for this purpose.
MR. CALIFANO:
Q

That is correct.

Their freedom not to sell time for this

That is the issue, isn’t it?
MR. CALIFANO:
Q

That is correct, Mr. Justice.

We have a different question here also, that

you would show that a particular network would sell spot
announcements and some of the others that you want to one
political party but not to any other political party.

55
MR. CALIFANO:

That is not the situation you have here, is it?

MR. CALIFANO:
Q

No, that is not, Mr. Chief Justice.

That the classification made by the licenscees

MR. CALIFANO:

That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice,

There are, I might note, according to the Census
Bureau, about 100 religions in this country.

Two or three

of them have a purchase time on Sunday mornings for
religious shows and it hasn’t destroyed television on Sunday.
The other 95 haven’t come bouncing in to acquire time.
Some corporations are effectively granted the right
to purchase entire announcer time; witness, as we cite in our
brief, some of the National Geographic and Xerox shows that
have appeared on the air.
The broadcasters set up in their briefs a whole

not think this Court should give, just as the Court of

And the bottom line on that point, I submit,
Mr. Justice, is this.-

In Red Lion, in the unanimous decision,

the Court of Appeals, this Court, noted that it would not
decide the case on the basis of extreme
extreme examples.

The Solicitor General, indeed, in his

argument in Red Lion, urged that particular point upon this
Court.

In case of doubt, this Court opted to

go with the

First Amendment values and the right to free speech noting
and Inviting the broadcasters to go back to the Federal
Communications Commission and ultimately come back here if
any of the horrors that they envisioned — any of their
nightmares ever came to pass.

None of them ever did come

fro pass and the same kind of doubt, if anyone has it in this
room besides the broadcasters, the dangers should be treated
in the same kind of way in this case.
We believe that that opting for free speech is

57
consistent with everything* with a whole host of decisions of
this Court.

We believe that this

Court* in effect, opted

for free speech in the Norr case in a situation of dangerous,
explosive, dirty and outrageous fighting between truckers and
railroads.

In Times v. Sullivan, this Court opted for free

speech in a situation where a newspaper lied.
In the Pentagon Papers, this Court opted for free
speech, even though the national security of this country
might have been involved.
In this case, the only inhibition on opting for
free speech are a host of impossibles that the networks claim
may come to pass and that they may hurt the system of
broadcasting.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS R. ASHER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. ASHER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please
1•

the Court:
Because I feel that perhaps the argument has taken
a path of abstraction I vrould beg leave to try to focus upon
the specific present in the BEM case to illustrate the exact
nature of the issue before the Court and the narrowness of
that issue as held by the

court below.

The issue is one of discrimination.

Broadcasters

60
voluntarily determine that in order to raise revenue they
are going to put a certain portion of their time up for sale
and market it to others and that those other persons are
going to use that time to speak.

BEM approached a broad­

caster that did just that with 18 out of every 60 minutes it
is on the air, WTOP radio station, and sought to purchase
time.

It was turned down not for any of the reasons suggested

by the Petitioners, not because the speech was obscene,
indecent, defamatory, or might somehow otherwise be in
violation of some specific law, but solely and exclusively
on the basis of a policy which is set out at page 297 of
the Appendix and I quote, "It is the policy of the PostNewsweek stations, radio and television stations not to sell
spot announcement time to individuals or groups in order to
set forth

a

point of view on any controversial subject

of public importance."
Now, that presents the clear, narrow issue that
was decided by the court below.

That is a flat ban on

selling time which is regularly marketed to commercial
spokesmen to people who wish to speak about controversial
subjects.
In brief, such a policy — as we view the ruling
of the court below and as this case is presented — involvesno question of creating a new constitutional right or"right
•i

of access," as it is phrased.

Rather, it deals specifically

61
with the question of whether or not —■ assuming, .for the
moment that I will address state action — assuming that the
action of the broadcaster is either itself state action or
because affirmed and approved by the regulatory agency's
state action, whether* or not this discrimination, barring
First Amendment protected speech, in and of itself

is

violative of the First Amendment doesn’t mean that every
person has a right to speak but rather a right not to be
excluded on such a discriminatory

ground*

We would suggest primarily that reading cases like
Ballantine against Prestonson and Breard versus Alexandria,
the approach taken by the broadcasters in terms of their
marketing of time turns constitutional values on their head.
The Court has time and again in those cases held that the
First Amendment protects political speech, does not protect
commercial speech,

if somehow or other the commercial

speaker, when he wishes to address a particular issue, the
merits of his product or otherwise in his own words, may
come and buy time on the nation’s most powei-ful communications

MR. ASHER:

public property.
I would, if possible, like to defer the state
action argument for a moment, but If you prefer —*
Q

Go ahead, Mr. Asher.

MR. ASHER:

The Petitioners seek to justify the

exclusion of editorial advertisements on two distinct grounds
and I think this should be kept in mind.

One is that somehow

or other the Pariness Doctrine offers an alternative to

63
letting people speak and therefore there is no real

First

Amendment interest left over on the part of people who want
to buy advertising time to say what they wish to say.
Fairness Doctrine has taken care of all that.

The

The broad­

caster has* in an alternative manner, told the public all
that it needs to hear.
Any individual vrho wishes to speak can rest
assured that if his speech was worthwhile it would have been
communicated by the broadcaster already.
The second is the parade of horrors which vie regard
as purely speculative and totally undocumented on the record
in this case.
Now, to address the first question, whether or not
the Fairness Doctrine constitutes a substitute for or a
justification for excluding constitutionally-protected speech
from the marketplace of advertising — and X perhaps ought to
digress for a moment to indicate that the court below limited
its holding to that time which a broadcaster voluntarily
elects to market to others.
"advertising time.”

The court characterised that as

discriminate between controversial speech and others.
Q

You are, you said, going to get to the

question of whether or not a broadcaster can be equated with
a government, aren’t you?

Because there is nothing to your

64
arguments unless that preliminary threshold is covered.
MR. ASHER:

Well, perhaps since Mr. Justice White

and yourself have both expressed interest in ray doing it
sooner, I should — I will address it at this moment.
If I can refer back to a 1966 opinion written by
the Chief Justice when he sat on the court of appeals,
Office of Communication of the United Church of Christ v FCC,
the very question of whether or not a broadcaster can be
equated with a newspaper in terms of First Amendment rights
was the question raised by Justice Stewart earlier.

It was

discussed.
Q

Well, now, I didn’t — I 3aid, if you ^l?ere

dealing with a newspaper.

I know that Red Lion could not have

been decided the way it was if a broadcaster is the same as
a newspaper because, clearly, government, under the First
Amendment, doesn’t have power to tell newspapers to be fair
and balance their reporting or anything

else-,

newspapers

have an absolute right to be unfair and we held that in
Red Lion

that broadcasters do not so, obviously, they are

net the equivalents, and I didn’t say that they were.
MR. ASHER:

No, I didn’t suggest that you did,

Mr. Justice Stewart, only that you had addressed the question
of is there analogy here between the papers and the broad’

.

• ***:■•

casters —

Q

If there were.

*

65
MR. ASHER:

have quite clearly suggested that

there is an analogy and I will not burden the Court with —
with all of the analysis that

Mr. Chief Justice Burger went

through in the Church of Christ case except to .point out that
it was clearly rejected that there Is any analogy between the
freedom of the broadcaster to make arbitrary decisions and
that of the newspaper, which in the Church of Christ case
was characterised as a purely private enterprise.
Q

When you say that, the newspaper was

characterized, was it not?
MR. ASHER:
Q

Yes, the newspaper was characterized as

This is the same distinction Justice Stewart

has been making.
MR. ASHER:

That's right.

And In emphasizing the

difference between broadcasters and newspapers, Mr. Chief
Justice, you use the following language, "A broadcaster
seeks and is granted the free and exclusive use of a limited
and valuable part of the public domain.”

When he accepts

that franchise, it is burdened by enforceable public interest
obligations,

A newspaper can be operated at the whim or

caprice of Its owner.

A broadcast station cannot.

On essence, what we. are addressed with here i3
at"
.. ly
whether or not/the whim or caprice of a broadcaster it can
market Its advertising time so as to draw what we think has
been clearly established by this Court at its last term in

66
Moseley as the most recent example as an invidiously
discriminatory policy that somehow or other the controversiality of the speech which someone wishes to

offer

and

time that he seeks to buy determines whether or not he can
utter it and, in fact, if it is controversial, he cannot
purchase the time.

He is flatly banned.

If it is not

controversial and therefore not protected by the First Amend­
ment, then he can’t.
Q

Mr. Asher, the language following the quoted

portion that you referred to In the United Church of Christ
case went on to say, in effect, that when they come to the
renewal of their license they are held to an accounting of
their stewardship in terms of whether they have been
operating on whim and caprice or whether they have been
operating on public interest.

It i3 quite a different matter

from the inverse of prior restraint or prior compulsion that
you are talking about here
MR. ASHER:

now.

I think that is — you may be quite

right, Mr. Chief Justice, but what the Commission has
established in this case is a policy that when a broadcaster^
license comes up for renewal — and every three years each
broadcaster’s license comes up — that whether or not they
engage in this invidious discriminationin other words,
whether or not they employ flat ban, this will not be
regarded as a negative factor on the side of determining

67
whether they have served the public interest.
In fact5 the Deomcratic National Committee asked
for alternative relief from the Commission.

They asked* one,

that flat- bans be prohibited or, two, alternatively, that the
Commission declare that it will be regarded as a negative
aspect

in terms of serving the public interest at renewal

time that broadcasters do discriminate against controversial
speech in the sale of their advertising time.
The Commission rejected both of those approaches.
So what the Commission, in essence, has done here
is it has given the broadcasters carte blanche to employ a
discriminatory policy and when a broadcaster comes up for
renewal, this policy will not be held against him.

In fact,

in the pleadings in the BEM case, WTOP specifically stated
that it was employing a policy that had been approved by the
government.
Now, this approval goes to the very core of whether
or not his license is going to be renewed and it makes no
difference whether the Commission in a specific proceedings
such as BEM's complaint or in the general request for
declaratory ruling as in the case of the Democratic National
Committee states that a particular discriminatory policy
will be regarded as an adverse factor in license renewal.
question is, what has the Commission done here?
we will not regard it as an adverse factor.

The

It has said

We will regard it

68
as, afc best, a totally neutral factor.

You are free to go

on discriminating and your licenses will be

renewed as

usual.
Q

Mr. Asher, supposing that your clients claim

they have been rejected by a netwox’k which had a policy of
selling no time for any sort of advertising?

Would you still

claim a First Amendment denial and that your client has a
right of access to these public airwaves?
MR, ASHER:
Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

Not on the facts of this case,
The First Amendment right 1 think is

a sort of abstraction that we all walk around garbed with, and
the question is, where can we exercise it and under what terms
can it be denied?

The facts here are rather narrow ones and

the court below made of it rather narrow ruling.

It said

when a broadcaster holds forth time for sale, 'then within that
time it cannot discriminate invidiously between controversial
-

.

• /W

and commercial speech.
That is the sole ruling that we are seeking
affirmance on here and the facts of this case need not get
beyond that and over to the question of a broadcaster which
is a noncommercial broadcaster which does not hold out time
for sale and thereby make a discrimination within that time.
Some mention was made of the Moose Lodge case and
that somehow or other it is dispositive of the facts before
the Court here.

Of course, Moose Lodge involved a private

69
club which had been licensed by the state to sell liquor.
Here we are talking about what has been time and again
characterised as a publicly-engaged industry licensed to
exercise control over what is perhaps the most important
form of communications in the country.

There is no

constitutional value protected in terms of a person's right to
drink and the regulation in the liquor area was focused
primarily upon keeping drunks and minors out of bars, a
legitimate state interest but clearly in no ’way relevant to
determining whether or not, when the government owns the
airwaves, owns the form of communication, as it did in
Burton against Wilmington Parking Authority and, on top of
it, licenses it out to others to utilize whether or not, at
least for the purposes of applying the First Amendment to the
way in which those airwaves are allocated, there, is not
sufficient action to call a state interest •— or not sufficient
interest to call a state action — and if one compares the
analysis engaged by this Court in Moose Lodge , .where one was
not concerned with' the vital First Amendment values, with
Lloyd against Hammer where there was no licensing whatever,
there was a privately-owned shopping center which xvas not
licensed by the state, yet nonetheless, the Court — the
Court’s majority — felt obliged to go to great lengths to
point out that First Amendment values are so important that
\

reaching that shopping center’s clientele as an audience are

70
so Important that there are alternative ways of reaching that
audience without getting inside the shopping center, notably,
distributing the leaflets at the entranceways.
Now, whether one agrees or not with the result
reached in Lloyd, 1 think Lloyd demonstrates that when
dealing ’with First Amendment values in a form that may be
appropriate to the communication of speech, this Court goes to
great lengths to try to determine whether or not speech is
being unduly curtailed.
Here we are dealing with a form unlike in Lloyd
which is dedicated solely and exclusively for the purposes of
communication.

There is no purpose whatever other than

communicating information.

Have you said all you are going to say

addressed to the point that broadcasters are government?
MR. ASHER:

No.

Well, I — I think — I would

like, perhaps, to address the Court's attention to page 72
of our brief.

We set out the language of Section 301 which

may perhaps be a good place to start in analyzing the question
of the degree of governmental involvement in the operation of
the broadcaster.
It is the purpose of this act to maintain the control
of the United States over all the channels of interstate and
foreign radio transmission and to provide for the use of such
channels but not the ownership thereof by persons for

71
limited periods of time under licenses granted by federal
authority and no such license should be construed to create
any right beyond the terms., conditions and periods of the
license„
Now, starting from that proposition, we are
dealing with a valuable public resource that the government
has maintained very, very stringent ownership of and the
statute requires that it maintain control over.

This differs

from virtually every other state action case that this court
has

ever been approached with including, in fact, the

Buret on against Wilmington Parking Authority where there was
t

no specific statutory requirement that the Parking Authority
maintain control over each and every square foot of the
parking lot that it built.
Time and again, this Court, when faced with the
question of . the way in which the-"government regulates
broadcasting, has expressed, in. the broadest of possible terms,
the manner in which the government exercises thi3 control.
For example, in Pottsville Broadcasting, which was quoted in
Red Lion, this Court used the term that the government
maintains a grip on the dynamic aspects of radio transmission
and, again in Red Lion, this Court stated that broadcasters
have been given a preferred position — a preferred position
conferred by government.
We figured, when we blend all of these factors

72

together, I think it is extremely difficult not to find at the
very least that the way in which broadcasters operate in
terms of allocating their air time — and we are talking here
about having voluntarily made a decision to market their
air time, must be held up to governmental standards, the
same First Amendment standards that would be applied if the
government were operating these stations themselves.
We are not talking now about that portion of the
broadcaster’s time which he is not holding out to others.
Q

But can you really make that sort of a

distinction between a marketing or commercial time and the
other aspects of the broadcasting business when you are trying
to decide whether or not this is state or governmental
action?
MR, ASHER:

I think you can make the distinction,

Mr. Justice Rehnquist only as follows:

The Fairness Doctrine

sweeps across the entire board of broadcasters dealing with
controversial issues and so, presumably, the

government has

asserted an interest in the whole manner in which it is done.
From our point

of view, the right that we are

asserting is not an absolute right for all of the broadcasters’
air time.

It is simply a right not to be discriminated

against when the broadcaster elects to sell something.

It vjill

be a different case if it ever comes up when someone asserts
a right to a broadcaster’s time when the broadcaster has not

73
determined he is going to market to others.
Q

But in order to decide whether or not it is

governmental action, the Court would have to adopt some
general principle and not just say that in these two particular
cases it is governmental action and we will worry about others
when they come here.

I am wondering whether any general

principle could be applied that would find it governmental
action here that wouldn’t require it to be found governmental
action in almost every other facet of the business?
MR. ASHER:

Well, yes, I think so.

Certainly, if

in a broadcast station's offices an employee tripped and
would hurt himself, he wouldn’t have to assert his rights
under the Federal Torts Claims Act.

Notably, the distinction

is that the airwaves are what are licensed out' by the
h ‘..V

government and it is the utilization of those' ^airwaves which
;•'bring the broadcaster within the ambit of stateaetion.

MR. ASHER:

Well, limitation and censorship may

7 ii

perhaps be the same, Mr. Justice Stewart,

All that we are

asserting here is that certainly no one has an absolute right
to speak on the airwaves and the NBC case made this clear.
What we are saying is that a broadcaster has not got a right
to be unreasonable.
Q

Well, that is an equal protection argument,

MR. ASHER:
Q

That is very much what it sounds like.

MR. ASHER:
Q

That’s right.

That is right and I —

That is an equal protection argument and that,

too, depends first of all upon equating the broadcaster with
government, but equal protection is something else and that
Is really what you would agree,•I think, that the Court of
Appeals’ opinion was heavily larded with protection rhetoric.
MR, ASHER:

Oh, quite,

I am trying to, make my
■

argument in accord with that.

;

'•

I think that in stressing the

element of discrimination rather than the element of absolute
rights, we were focusing on whether or not there has been
invidious discrimination which I think in decidiihg Mosely
last term this Court acknowledged that the First Amendment
interests and the equal protection-, interests were entx^ined
but nonetheless came down on equal protection grounds.

I

think what we find ourselves faced with here is largely the
same factor.
The government can limit speech.

The question isis it doing it on a reasonable

here.
Q

You say the

government can limit speech and

it does it all the time?
MR. ASHER:

Oh, X think there is no doubt about it.

It closes this courtroom at a certain time and only allows
certain people to speak in

the courtroom.

Courts are closed.

Time, place and manner are perfect3.y permissable.

While one

may have a right to speak in the Capitol Building during
the hours —
Q

Time and place, not by the contents,

MR. ASHER:

Certainly not on the basis of the

content and if on content at all, certainly not on the basis
of the fact that controversial speech will be excluded.
Q

What about responsible speech, speech by

responsible people as contrasted with irresponsible people?
Is there any power of government under the First Amendment
/

to make that kind of distinction?
MR. ASHER:

;

It is a very, very difficult

distinction to make, Mr. Justice Stewart

and certainly this

Court has in many, many cases suggested that regardless of
whether or not one is responsible, one has a right to speak,
the answer to the question is if the

forum is unlimited,

then probably you cannot distinguish on the grounds that this

76
man is irresponsible and that man is responsible.
if the forum is limited,

However,

it may be a reasonable ground to

suggest that one man is speaking for a broader audience than
another.

We constantly face allocative problems.

When two

people want a parade permit to go on the same street at the
same time, the government has to make a allocative decision
*

and there are numerous reasonable grounds on which you could
do it.
Now, responsibility may be one of them, although I
find it the most troublesome simply because it is the kind of
.judgment that is most attached with censorship.
Q
you gave.

Well, now, let’s, take that last hypothetical

Q

They have made the classification and once

you have hurdled whether this is governmental action., you
still have to demonstrate this is an unreasonable and
itripermissable classification, do you not?
MR. ASHER:

I think we do and I think that the

classification is unreasonable and Impermlssable on its face
unless this Court is prepared to state that somehow or other
it is permissable for a governmentally-operated forum to
say commercial speech will be permitted and political speech
will not,
And every single time this Court ha3 been
addressed with that question It has answered it in the
negative.
Q

It has

merely said that the political speech will be allowed just
during political campaigns, so you have another* classification
MR. ASHER:

Oh, we have numerous classifications,

that we will allow political speech by political parties to
raise money, but we won’t allow it for other purposes, which
in a way touches upon another unreasonable aspect, of the
entire scheme that seems to be evolving here.
In another way, we start out with what presumably
would be a neutral approach to let’s say marketing advertising
time and immediately the neutrality is removed by saying,

78
controversial speech is going to be let out.

It is going to

be excluded.
So we split from neutrality of time, place and
manner — at least, which has been held permissable in
numerous cases, into an un-neutral area which is invidious.
It excludes political speech and permits commercial speech
free rein within that air time.

And it's not prearranged.

Some controls are exercised but at least an opportunity to
speak and that is all that we seek here, nothing more.
Q

Mr. Asher, when a state is involved they put

up the old blue army state interests.-

What do the broadv ‘

• •

'X \

casters and agencies put as their overwhelming interests?
MR. ASHER:

Well, we have been hard-pressed to try

to find any of the interests that have been asserted by the
broadcasters that could be regarded as overwhelming.
One is the danger that perhaps the rich who buy
up the time and somehow set the agenda of debate —
Q "

•They are Just regulating their own time.

MR, ASHER:
Q

I beg your pardon?

They are regulating their own time.

time?
Q

Yes, they only have 24 hours of the day.

MR, ASHER:
Q

Yes.

That’s right.

79
MR. ASHER:

And no one is questioning the broad­

caster’s right to regulate it in terms of saying, we are
going to market so much to sell to others and keep so much
for ourselves to say what we want to.

We are just talking

about that time they are selling.
Q

Then your only point is that you are

restricted because it is controversial?

That is right.

ground on which we were kept out.

That is the only

If you look at the policy

of WTOP radio stations on which the Business Executives
group was excluded, the only ground on which it was
excluded was the controversiality of its message.,~no
ground whatever.

other

It is strictly that narrow discrimination

that we are talking about.

Now, a number of what 1 would

regard as false horrors have been paraded to the Court as to
what might happen if it were acknowledged that there is no
right not to discriminate.

Or, I’m sorry, a right to

discriminate or a right to be required not to discriminate.
One, somehow or other that the rich might buy up all the
time,

I think that that is at best a speculative danger

because if we look at the nature of editorial advertising
in newspapers we find that for the most part editorial
advertising is utilised by disadvantaged groups that somehow
or other feel that their views have already been excluded.
The rich, on the other hand, are not monolithic by

80
any means and if General Motors in fact decided that rather
than trying to sell cars it was going to use all the time it
could buy up to talk about political issues, one, that would
run completely counter to the situation we see in the newspaper
area where we find very little politicising by commercial
interests.
Secondly» that subject wasn’t briefed to this
Court but thirdly, even if it were done, even if corporations
utilised advertising time to address issues rather than
simply the merits of products,

is that necessarily an un­

desirable First Amendment consequence so long as we have the
Fairness Doctrine to assure that there is balance?
Now, another one of the danges that has been
advanced is that somehow or another the Fairness Doctrine
that ’
will be wrecked If we have a requirement/editorial speech not
be excluded from advertising time.

And, again, there is no

basis whatever for reaching this conclusion.

Numerous
— ><
stations, as acknowledged by the broadcasters, already carry
1

editorial advertisements.

None of them have come forward

to say that somehow or other as a result oflour doing this
we are about to go under.

We are being swamped.

The common doctrine which requires that' broadcasters
give free time for response only comes about in two
circumstances.

One, where — three circumstances— where a

controversial issue of public importance has not been dealt

81
with fairly by the broadcaster, it is Imbalanced in

the

broadcaster’s programming and in one of the cigarette cases
the FCC has held that an eight-to-one balance of procigarette and anti-cigarette advertisements is reasonable, so
the broadcasters have a tremendous latitude in which to
determine what is balanced.
Secondly, no one has paid to come forward to put on
the other side and, thirdly, the broadcaster in his own
programming has not, in one way or another, elected to
present the other side.
Only in those circumstances must they give time
free to someone to present an alternative viewpoint.
remember, we are not talking
world.

Now,

about every issue in the

We are talking about issues that are both contro­

versial and of public importance, notably those issues which
not only the Fairness Doctrine applies to are specifically
excluded under the flat ban policy that we asked this Court
to declare unconstitutional.
Novi, if an issue i3 both controversial and of
public Importance, presumably a broadcaster, if he is
■

* '

fulfilling his Fairness Doctrine obligations, is already
going to be covering that issue and it is very unlikely that
/

•

*

letting on a particular spokesman is going to throw his
•i

programming into imbalance and the facts of the BEM case
indicate that.

WTOP has argued that it has presented both

82
sides of the war in extreme balance, keeping in mind the eightto-one ratio

that the Commission has held to be reasonable,

selling three or four minutes to one group or another group
to express their views on the issue to supplement what the
broadcaster has already put on in newstime.
throw his programming into imbalance.

It's not going to

The one place in which

you might find a problem of the broadcaster being faced with
either an economic burden under the

Fairness Doctrine or

an incursion upon his discretion as to what issues should be
covered is where a new issue comes up.

raised that issue.

Then the broadcaster obviously, pot having

covered it, probably has not been fulfilling his;..Fairness
Dcotrine obligations.

He may have overlooked the.issue and

so that in furtherance of the First Amendment objectives of
robust, vfide-open debate, the new issue will have been brought
to public attention and how the broadcaster deals with it
need not impose any great economic burden.
Primarily, the broadcaster will deal with that issue
by either dealing with it in news time.

Perhaps another

member of the public will come forward and buy time to

83
present the other side but in any event the broadcaster is
going to be subjected to no burden that he is not already
required to address under the Fairness Doctrine because we
are only talking about controversial issues of public
importance»

We are not talking about those kinds of issues

which the broadcasters somehow or other suggest they should
exclude.
One of the broadcasters suggested trivial issues
might be excludable.

Well, if it is trivial, then it is not

controversial and of public importance.

We are only talking

about the burning issues of the day, those very issues that
the broadcaster must address in his programming time under
the Fairness Doctrine and must address with balance.
I think that I have covered pretty much those
areas that were not covered by Mr. Califano except to
suggest that the question of programming time, as far as we
are concerned in the context of this case, must be looked at
very narrowly.
Notably, if a broadcaster regularly markets
programming time to others, then again it would be invidious
to say, "I'll mai’ket it to you if you want to talk about a
commercial subject but not about a controversial one."
On the other hand, if a broadcaster markets only
spot advertising time, which is the case with a number of
broadcasters, then that is what we are talking about and we

84
are saying that Is where he cannot discriminate.

But, none­

theless, the basic question is discrimination and the basic
judgment is the broadcasters’ as to what he is going to
subject —■ what type of time he is going to put up for sale.
When he puts time up for sale, then he is to be held to a
requirement that

he not discriminate invidiously between

that which is controversial and that which is not.

Mr. Wilkinson, you have seven and one-half minutes.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF
VERNON L. WILKINSON, ESQ., FOR THE PETITIONERS
MR. WILKINSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Questions were asked of counsel for DNC on what
sections of the Communications Act they

were relying as

being violated by the Commission’s decision'. ""Tn—that
connection I would like to call to this Court’s attention
and emphasis© that on at least four occasions

Congress has

" • ’ ‘ :(<v

had opportunities to prescribe the right of access for the
presentation of contrasting views on controversial issues
arid in each instance has refused to go that far.
First of all, the Radio Act of 1927 with
reference to candidates for public office, they did put in a

85
provision which would carry it over again when the Act was
reenacted as the Communications Act of 193^ that if time is
made available by the broadcaster to one candidate, he must
likewise make available time to other candidates for the same
office.

But, this statute immediately went on with a

sentence to this effect, "No obligation is imposed upon any
licensee to allow the use of a station for any such
candidate."

That was the provisions up until 1959S except

for the standard of public interest and the report on
editorialising in 19^9.
?

However, in 1959 after the Larr Daily episode,
Congress restricted still further this equal time require­
ment even for candidates by eliminating bona fide newscasts,
by eliminating bona fide news interviews, bona fide
documentaries and on-th-spot-coverage bona fide news events.
Now we come then next to the Campaign Expenditure
Act of 1971 which became effective April 7, 1972 where
Congress provided that licenses could be revoked for willful
or repeated failure to allow reasonable access to or to
permit purchase of reasonable amounts of time for the use of
a broadcasting station by

legally-qualified candidates for

federal elective office, federal only, not state.
Now, you will notice that they used the word "or,"
"Either access or permit purchase of reasonable time."
didn't say purchase and purchase of reasonable time.

It

86
Congress was perfectly familiar back in 1959 and
after this Court’s decision in Red Lien that the broadcaster
v/as under an obligation to see that, all sides of controversial
issues were presented.

And, therefore, the stations are

under a duty to provide time either free of charge or on a
paid basis and that is the policy which most of the three
networks, for the most part, have followed.
With reference to controversial issue's, we present
the time free,
Now, Congress and the Commission have gone further,
/

after the Campaign

Expenditure Act was enacted, question

was asked by Meredith Publishing Company, which Owns several
television stations and radio stations, ’’Can we continue our
policy under that statue of making time available: free only
to candidates and not selling time and thereby keeping a

{hi

complete balance and not the richest candidate getting more
spots and the poorest

candidate being able to only buy one

spot because on time for sale for candidates for public
office, the Fairness Doctrine, as I understand it, is not
directly applicable.
The

Commission held that Meredith Publishing

Company could continue to make time available on a free basis
and not be required to sell time for campaign purposes.

And

that is even and I think therefore that we have an A Fortiori
situation when we get into the subject of controversial

37
issues.
So we do not have here a question of selling time
to the commercial advertising and refusing to sell time to the
person that wants to espouse ideas.

We sell time to the

commercial advertiser to advertise his products.

We give

time for the presentation of controversial issues.
Q

Well3 you didn’t give time here, did you?

MR. WILKINSON:
Q

We have given —

Did you give time in these cases here?

MR. WILKINSON:

That was in response to this

particular request but there is no complaint by the DNC —
Q

But I can't understand you.

Why would you

give somebody else time and you didn't give them time?
MR. WILKINSON:
on the ABC network, yes.

We have given DNC time on occasion,
We did not in response to this

particular request.
Much emphasis was placed on United Broadcasting
Company case in 19^5 by the Respondents.

The. Commission was

loaded with its Fairness Doctrine here.

It Is true there is

some, mention made of It back .in 1929, generalizations, but it
was not until the reform of editorialising in 19^9 that the
Commission finally expounded Its Fairness Doctrine In much
the same form it is at present except for the additional
conditions about personal attack rules and matters of that
kind.

38
We do not consider United Broadcasting Company case
•

!

therefore as controlling In view of the 19^9 reform on
editorialising and the Fairness Doctrine itself as announced
by the Commission and I vfould like therefore to call to the
Court's attention that the more authoritative pronouncements
than the United Broadcasting

Company case — a decision by

a different panel of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia both before this case was resolved and
after this case was decided where they say, "We believe
"DN-C’s position to be fallacious and point to our recent
decision in Green v, FCC

where we state that no individual

or group has the right of access to the air.
