PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

next in No. 71-6314, Gosa against Mayden.
Mr. Saalfield, you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN ft SAALFIELD, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SAALFIELDj

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court;
The case that we are now to hear involves a similar
issue as that which you have just heard.
companion case to the Flemings case.

This is a

However, I would like

to emphasise a factual distinction which I think important.
In the case of Gosa v. Mayden , in both the lower
courts they found retroactivity

or at least the impact of

the 01Callahan v. Parker decision not to apply.

The court-

martial sentence imposed upon Mr. Gosa, therefore, was
upheld.

But let me emphasise that the Goaa factual situation

is almost identical to that in QcCallahan.

And in

0'Callahan as well as Gosa we had a member of the United
States military who was off duty with permission of his
superior officers and off post in civilian clothing.

Under

this context and while in such status each of the defendants
in the lower court committed the offense of rape for which
they were subsequently tried in the court-martial.

4
These offenses

,

1 emphasize, were committed while

each of the defendants were off duty and while the nation
was not in a wartime status»

This is important, I believe,

in distinction with the Flemings case.

But in continuing

I hope to remain as succinct as possible to avoid cumulative
as well as repetitious argument which was ably presented
by counsel Meltsner for Flemings.
However, I contend initially that the court-martial
which tried Mr. Gosa had no jurisdiction within which to
impose any sentence whatsoever on the charge of rape.

I

would indicate that the constitutional construction as well
as application of those provisions leave the Court with no
alternative but to restrActively apply the jurisdiction of
the court-martial in those instances.
Q

Mr. Saalfield, is there any indication in the

record here as to why Mr» Gosa was not tried in the
state courts of Wyoming for this offense?

We have been told

in the course of the earlier argument in the briefs that
the general policy of the military was, in situations like
this, to waive any potential court-martial jurisdiction and
have the person tried in the state courts.
MR. SAALFIELD:

Yes, sir.

Mr. Gosa in fact was

held by civilian authorities for approximately one month
after he was arrested for the offense of rape, after which
time he was turned over to the military.

He was not tried

^

5
by civilian authorities for the reason that no complaining
witness was found by those authorities,
Q

Oh, that is right.

The complaining witness

was in a little trouble herself on shop lifting or something
Is that not what the record shows?
MR, SAALPlELDs
Q

The record did indicate that,

I remember that now,

I read the briefs a

couple weeks ago.
MR, SAALFIELD?

Yes, sir.

It is our contention—and no one knows better than
this Court the basis for the decision in 0°Callahan, but
obviously as the content of the decision indicated, under
those circumstances 0'Callahan was not in the status and his
crime did not involve service connection.

Therefore, the

Court decided that there was no jurisdiction by which the

court-martial could try him for the crime which was
alleged.

q

The petitioner was handed over?

MR, SAALFIELD:
Q

Yes, he was, sir.

Is he still in prison?

MR. SAALFIELD:

He recently was released, I think

approximately four or five months ago.
sentence.

He has served his

At any rate, the majority of this Court in the

0’Callahan decision went to great lengths to contrast the
court-martial procedural system with the, system of trial by

6
jury of one's peers, which is representative in the civil
judicial process.

It is not necessary or appropriate for

me at this time to reiterate and emphasize the distinctions
which this Court arrived at.

But, rather, I point out that

the Court in the 08Callahan, decision recognized the' vital
fundamental importance of the Fifth and. Sixth Amendments
which impose and guarantee to individuals certain liberties.
If is these liberties which we are now concerned.
We contend, therefore, that the 0°Callahan decision
which was jurisdictional indicated that the court-martial was

/
without jurisdiction under the facts of that case to impose
any sentence whatsoever on the person being court-martialed.
The court-martial, in effect, was without power, was without
authority, and was without competence by which to adjudicate
on such a matter.
jurisdiction.

^

And, therefore, the court-martial had no

We contend, therefore, that the judgment of the

lower courts in this case, the Gosa case, is null and void ^
without any force and effect because of this jurisdictional
question, and that the rules of retroactivity or prospectivity
which have been promulgated and created by necessity by this
Court in cases in the past are of no applicability, because
every time these rules of prospectivity or retroactivity
have been applied, none of the cases have gone to the
jurisdictional question or the power of the court in the
first instance to adjudicate the case before it.

And

7
precisely tills is the matter with which we are now concerned.
The lower courts? both, the district and the court
of appeal, recognized? I think? from a fair reading of their
decisions? that 0*Callahan was a jurisdictional decision.
However? each of these courts applied the so-called Stovall
or Linkletter three-pronged test which counsel has argued
before the Court in the prior case.

I at this time am not

going into the test? but suffice it to say that the test
involves the purpose? reliance? and effect of a particular
decision of a court.
Again, I would like to emphasize that in each and
every instance where these tests have been applied before?
it has involved procedural questions primarily in the area
of criminal law? and I would emphasize that we are not now
concerned with whether the court in fact had the power to
try the case because in the case before us now? the courtmartial in Gosa did not. have that power.

Therefore? we do

not need to concern ourselves with this retroactivity
problem.
There are no cases, or any decisions which have
applied the test of retroactivity where a jurisdictional
question of the court is involved as we are talking of it in
this case.

Traditionally the rule of retroactivity is

applicable where where a court lacks the jurisdiction to
adjudicate in the first place.

This is emphasised by

^

8
Judge Godbold in dissenting opinion in the appeal decision
below.
Even conceding that the test of retroactivity
should be applied, 1 would argue that under the circumstances
the test favors retroactivity rather than prospectivity, and
the reason for this argument is, one, if we look to the
purpose of the test itself, we find that it is fco instill
and insure the guarantee of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments,
which is the right to trial by jury, presentment of a grand
j ury indicfcment.
The Government contends, however, that if this is
the purpose, that there is no impairment whatsoever in the
truth-finding process, and therefore there is no need, to
retroactively apply the decision of 0*Callahan»
However, I think the Government’s argument ignores
the 08Callahan majority decision, which went to great
length to point out the shortcomings of the court-martial
system as it was known in 1969»

And the historical argument

suggested in the 07Callahan decision indicated a limitation
on jurisdictional expansion must be levied on the courtmartial system.
Furthermore, the Government argues and cites the
case of De-Stefano and cases similar to it, Bloom v. Illinois.
These cases involve the question of right to trial by jury
for certain serious crimes.

However, 1 would emphasise in

9
these cases in the first instance the defendants did have
the opportunity to be tried by a civil judge, and a

^

f

distinction can thereby be drawn between that situation and
where a defendant is being tried by a court-martial.

And,

of course, the differences are well contrasted in the
09Callahan decision»
But I would contend that the purpose is not
necessarily protection of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments»
But even further 1 would say the purpose is to make certain
that the jurisdiction of the court-martial system as we
know it today in the military is delineated in a definitive
way so that the Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights cannot be
impinged»

And by doing so we can thereby only say this is

a jurisdictional question»

Therefore, being jurisdictional

I argue we have no choice»

This Court must impose the

effect of the decision retroactively»
The Government further contends that reliance has
been very heavily weighed upon by the military with regard
to court-martial jurisdiction»

i/

Military policy, however,

1 would say, historically favors civilian authorities trying
those who are involved with offenses which are committed
off the base»

And a memo of understanding, in fact, in 1955—

a memo of understanding between the Department of Justice
and the Department of Defense—in those situations, although
jurisdiction is concurrent, emphasised the policy of the

10

military to turn over cases which involve serious crimes off
the base committed by military personnel to the Department
of Justice for prosecution.
Q

As you indicate by the use of the word, this

was a matter of policy and choice on the part of the military,
was it not?
MR. SAALFIELDt

Yes, it was.

And my reason for

mentioning that, Your Honor, was to emphasize that the
Government recognized that this was probably the proper form
and that this reliance factor is not so great as the
Government might urge.
C

Is it not true that they did not want to have

the burden of all these trials?
MR. SAALFIELD;
0

That may he true.

I do not know.

Mr. Saalfield, the memo that you have just

referred to sounds like it is termed as though it dealt
with possible federal civilian prosecutions.

Was there a

similar understanding between the Department of Defense and
potential state prosecutors?
MR. SAALFIELD;

I do not know, Your Honor.-,

Lastly in the three-pronged test is the effect of
the 08Callahan decision being applied retroactively.
Government

The

strongly urges an extreme administrative burden

would be imposed on the military system should this decision
be applied retroactively.

However, X think in the first

II
places if the Government is going to so argue, that they
have the burden to convincingly show to the Court that this
in fact would be the case.

To the contrary, however, I

believe that the Government has done no more than to specu­
latively mention that this will be an extreme administrative
burden but has not shown any statistics or figures to
support their contention.

And, to the contrary, 1 would

urge the Court to recognise the Law Review article by
Mr. Blumenfeld which has been cited previously by counsel
which rebuts most all the contentions of the Government with
regard to any administrative inconvenience or extreme
burden should retroactivity be imposed.
In conclusion, with regard to this three-pronged
test, I think we are involved, as we are in many decisions
with a balancing of certain values.
which are at stake here?

What are the values

On the side of the petitioner we

are talking of individual rights instilled in the Fifth and
Sixth Amendments.

On the other side, the Government is

interested with the or concerned with the administrative
burden on the military should retroactivity be the situation.
I do not think that the administration or the burden on the
administration of the military should in any way corae near
weighing the importance of what the individual rights of the
petitioner are that are involved, the Fifth and Sixth
Amendment are fundamental.

No matter what the financial cost.

12
repercussions or otherwise* the value I think clearly points
to the individual.

Also we are concerned with the power or

the right not to he tried by a court-martial in non-service
connected crimes.

Conversely* on the other side* we have

the power of the court-martial itself and the breakdown* if
you will, or the possible breakdown in military discipline.
I do not believe

in the facts of 0°Callahan and Gosa, which

1 contend are identical except that 0*Callahan was in
Hawaii and Gosa was in the District of Wyoming or the State
of Wyoming, that there will be any affect if this Court
recognises or limits the jurisdiction of the court on
military disciplina because of the fact that this is a non­
service connected, offense.
Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERr

Thank you, Mr. Saalfield.

Mr. Solicitor General.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERWIN N. GRISWOLD„ ESQ.*
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. GRISWOLDs

May it please the Court:

This case began by a writ of habeas corpus, but
it appears that the defendant has now been released.

Should^

habeas corpus be used as a sort of declaratory judgment that
the prior confinement was illegal?
0

May I ask, Mr. Solicitor, was he still confined t/

when the petitioner filed here?

MR. GRISWOLD;
Q

Yes, he was confined»

Have we not decided in that circumstance that

we may still decide the case?
MR. GRISWOLD:
Q

I am not sure, Mr. Justice.

I thought we had a term. or two ago.

MR. GRISWOLD;

I would be happy if the Court has

jurisdiction of this case because I would hate to have this
question of retroactivity have to be argued a third time
before the Court.
Q

I do not recall the name of it, but I am

rather confident we did decide that.
MR. GRISWOLD:

He may be on some sort of probation,

but that does not appear.
Q

No, the test, as I recall the case, the test

we applied was whether he was confined when the petition was
filed here.
MR. GRISWOLD;

He was confined when the petition

was filed; there is no doubt about that.

If the case is

properly before the Court, it does seem to present the issue
of retroactivity which was discussed in the previous
argument.
rape

The offense here was, as the district court said,

which occurred while he was off base, off duty, dressed

in civilian attire, and with the woman involved a civilian.
The offense occurred in peace time after the Uniform Code of
Military Justice was in effect in the State of Wyoming.

It

14
is thus very close in its facts to 08Callahan.

Indeed,

the

Government stipulated in the court below, and I fully agree
here, that the charge was not service-connected.

And thus

the question is whether 0°Callahan is to be applied
retroactively to a conviction which became final some two ^
years before 0‘Callahan was decided.

The reasons against,

retroactively applying 09Callahan have been canvassed
thoroughly in the Flemings argument and need not be
generally repeated here.

I would point out, though, the

language of the district court in this case below who said
that, at page 31 of the Appendix, "In spite of the fact that
the Supreme Court in 06 Callahan talks in terns of a lack of
jurisdiction on the part of military courts-martial, the
basic rules in Linkletter, Tehan, Stovall, and PeSfefano
against Woods should apply in this case."
And I would call particular attention to the
excellent opinion of Judge Clark below in which, among other
things, he refers on page 43 and 44 of the Appendix, to
O' Callahan as.

"a decision which undoes congressional action

in a context where the act involved has a half century
background of at least tacit judicial approval.:35
There is considerable reference in the briefs, and
there has been reference in the argument here, .to the
suggestion that the practical consequences of a retroactive
decision would not be very great.

It is said that there are

15
plenty of administrative personnel and they board for the
correction of records who could do the paper work, -and this
could all be worked out*
as that„

Of course, it is not as simple

When, the records are? corrected, various consequences

would follow.

Back pay? if & dishonorable discharge is

canceled, then not merely veterans’ benefits become
available but past veterans’ benefits would become available.
Pensions for dependents and survivors would turn on it.
1 do not put it solely on financial grounds, even
though that would be a large and fortuitous windfall if
retroactivity was applied across the board with statutes of
limitations having run so that further prosecution could not
be had in any event.

1 would like to suggest that though

this Court can and in some cases certainly should change
the rules for the future, it not only ought not but it cannot
rewrite history.

And things which happened before the rules

were changed, in cases where essential justice is not

i/^

involved should not lead to a complete redoing and re-—not
evaluation, because re-evaluation is impossible in these
cases to a complete rewriting of history.

And so we would

say that in this case the judgment below, based on the
excellent opinion of Judge Clark, should ba affirmed.
Q

I gather you are not making the argument you

made in the Flemings case, that this is service-connected?
MR. GRISWOLDs

No, Mr. Justice, I said that it was

stipulated below and we agreed that this is not serviceconnected o
Q

I am addressing myself particularly to the

argument you made in Flemings„ that because that was an
incident that occurred during a declared war., that in and
of itself, you suggested, would make it service-connected»
MR. GRISWOLD;

We are not contending that this was

during wartime in 1966.
Q

You limit your argument then only to the time

of declared war?
MR. GRISWOLDs

In this case, we limit the

to a time of declared war.

argument

We have stipulated that this

offense was not service-connected.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;
MR. SAALFIELD;

1 have no rebuttal.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;
General and Mr. Saalfield.

Mr. Saalfield?

Thank you, Mr. Solicitor

The case is submitted.

[Whereupon, at 11;21 o'clock a an. the case
was sufom.itted „ ]
