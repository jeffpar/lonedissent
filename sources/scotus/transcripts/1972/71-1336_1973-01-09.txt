PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first this morning in No, 71-1336, the matter of the
application of Griffiths for admission to the Bar.
Mr. Broiles, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF R. DAVID BROILES, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. BROILES:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Fre Le Poole Griffiths was born in the Netherlands
in 19^0, emigrated to this country on a temporary visa in
1965, obtained the status of a permanent resident alien after
she acquired work in this country in the State of New York in
1965.

She continued to work in this country and was married

in 1967 and moved to Washington, D. C.
After residing in Washington, D. C. approximately
two years, she moved to New Haven, Connecticut where she was
admitted to Yale Law School as a second-year law student.
She completed her studies toward an LLB degree at Yale Law
School and graduated from Yale Lav; School in June of 1969.
She has the equivalent of a B.A. in law from the
University of Leiden in the Netherlands, an LLB in law
from the Univeristy of Amsterdam in the Netherlands and an
LLB in law from Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut.
She is, concededly in all respects, qualified, for

admission to the bar examination in the State of Connecticut
but for the fact that Rule Si of the Superior Court rules of
the State of Connecticut requires that all applicants for
admission to the bar
States.

examination be citizens of the United

Pre Griffiths is not a citizen of the United States

and did not at the time of her application intend to become
a citizen of the United States.
She was, at the time of her application, a resident
within the residency requirements of the State of Connecticut
for admission to the bar.
Q

Does she give an indication of why 3he dcies

not intend to become a citizen of the United States?
MR. BROILES:

This is the fourth hearing that we

have attended and you are the first person to ask.

The record

does not so Indicate why she does not intend to become a
citizen of the United States.
If you would like for me to give you the reason, I
would discuss it —
»

Q

Well, does the record show whether or not she

intends to remain in the United States and particularly in
Connecticut?
MR. BROILES:

The record does not show whether she

intends to remain in the United States or in the State of
Connecticut.

She was not asked that question.

She, in fact,

does intend to reside in the United States with her husband.

5
Q

Indefinitely?

MR. BROILES:

Yes.

She does intend to reside in

the United States indefinitely.
Q

And clearly intends not to become a citizen.

MR. BROILES:
become a citizen.

She does not at this time intend to

Her feeling is that after 25 years of

living in Holland that she cannot give that up at this
particular time.

Dual citizenship is not a possibility.

It

would be as if we immigrated to Hollands say we married a
Dutch citizens and I was living in Holland and my wife was
working there and in order to practice my profession as a
lawyer I w&s required to give up my citizenship in the
United States.
My failure to do that — and I would not give up
my citizenship in the United States to be a Dutch citizen —
would not be because of any lack of loyalty to Holland, where
I was a resident thereof, or because I intended to violate any
laws of Holland or because I could not abide by the
constitutional laws of Holland.

It would be because of the

feeling I had after having my family and resided in the
United States for 25 years, that sort of personal feeling is
what Mrs. Griffiths has and she doesn’t feel at this time
she could give up —
Q

You are talking about "personal feeling," but

one never knows about the future, about the relationships.

6
for example, between our country and Holland or any other
nation.
MR. BROILES:
Q

No, there are contingencies —

And as long as that personal feeling of

loyalty exists to the nation of which you are now a citizen,
that, I suppose, is what Connecticut was trying to get at,
wasn’t it?
MR. BROILES:
Is trying to get at.

I think it Is not what Connecticut
Connecticut — people have personal

feelings, for example, with regard to their citizenship in the
state in the United States by virtue of the l4th Amendment,
we have a dual citizenship to a state and to the United
States if we are citizens of —
Q

But International affairs, under our

Constitution and all those matters, are turned over to the
national government.
xtfith other nations.

The states don’t have foreign policies
That is one of the reasons our

Constitution was adopted.
MR. BROILES:
Q

That Is correct.

So that is not ---

MR. BROILES:

Well, if you are asking, is there a

contingency that she might

go back to Holland, that contin­

gency, in fact, exists, as much as the contingency that some­
one born in California who is admitted to practice in lav; in
Connecticut might

go back to California, that someone who is

ni

a citizen of the United States might choose to renounce their
United States citizenship and move to Israel.
die.

Someone might

Someone might commit a breech of the canons of ethics

as a member of the bar and be disqualified.

There are all

sorts of disabling contingencies that one can have.
one of them would be that she can go to Holland.

Certainly,

That is a

contingency, also, that her husband is subject to, that anyone
would be subject to in leaving the United States.
I do not think it is what the State of Connecticut
is getting at by requiring United States’ citizenship of all
members or applicants to the bar, though.
Q

Mr. Broiles, to pursue your hypothetical,

yOur moving to Holland and having a Dutch wife.

As a member

of the bar of some one of the states of the United States, do
you think you would have the right to be a judge in Holland?
MR. BROILES:

No, I would not have the right to be

a judge in Holland, though it is interesting that my client,
who is not a citizen of the United States and is a citizen of
Holland would, on our research, have a right to be the Chief
Justice of the United States Supreme Court.
Her research tells me that in Holland that is not
the case.

I tell you what my client tells me about Dutch law.

I don’t purport to know anything about it other than that.
But we have not found any disabling provisions for an alien
to be a United States district court judge or to be on the

8
Supreme Court of the United States of America.
Q

According to the Constitution, they don’t even

need to be lawyers, do they?
MR. BROILES:

There is no requirement that a

Justice on the Supreme Court be a lawyer.
Q

Mr. Broiles, following through with your

hypothetical, just as a matter of curiosity, do you know
whether you could be admitted to the bar of Holland?
MR. BROILES:
Q

According to my client, I could not.

Without being a Dutch citizen?

MR. BROILES:

Without being a Dutch citizen.

Our research shows that there are very few coun­
tries that allow xtfhat one would call ’’reciprocity without the
requirement of citizenship,"

one of the few being Japan and

it is apparently possible in England but it is not possible,
according to her, in Holland.
Q

This is outside the record, but Is your client

still a resident in Connecticut?
MR. BROILES:

She is presently living in Holland

and is coming back Thursday and has the intention of
practicing In Connecticut if this opinion is favorable to
her.

She went to Holland and. had a child.

She now has —

since the beginning of this lawsuit has had two childdren.
Q

Is the case moot?

MR. BROILES:

No, it is not, your Honor.

There Is

9
no residency requirement in the State of Connecticut.

Rule

82 requires that you have an intention to reside in the State
of Connecticut, which she has.
brought up, of course

At the

time the case was

she had been a resident of Connecticut

for two years.
Q

An intent to reside, that means an intent to

live in Connecticut and indefinitely.
MR. BROILES:

No, it does not, your Honor.

It means

an intent to reside in Connecticut so long as it takes to
become a member of the bar.

Once one has become a member of

the bar, you need no longer have that intent.
Q

Well, I know, but how can you have an intent —

what does residency mean in Connecticut?
MR. BROILES:

Q

Residency means living there.

Just being there?

MR. BROILES:

Just being there.

I, for example, am

a member of the Connecticut Bar, a Commissioner of the
Superior Court of the State of Connecticut as I stand here
right now.

I have not resided in the State of Connecticut

for two years.

I have been to Connecticut only twice in

those two years, both times in connection with this lawsuit.
I became a member of the bar in the State of Connecticut
after my graduation from a law school in the State of
Connecticut.

No questions were asked me and no questions

are required by the rules of the Superior Court of the

10
State of Connecticut that I intend to permanently reside in
the State of Connecticut.

Rule 82 says, "You must either

reside In the State of Connecticut or Intend to reside In the
State of Connecticut."

It does not require an intention to

permanently reside in the State of Connecticut.
Q

I recently —

Residence means domiciled, then?

MR. BROILES:

In your ~~

I think residence does, in fact,

mean that; that you at the time you make application for the
admission to the bar, have the intention to reside.

I take

domicile to mean actually physically be present.
Q

Well, also, domicile

involves an intent to

remain there indefinitely.
When I stay overnight in a hotel in New Haven,
that doesn't make me a resident of New Haven.
MR. BROILES:

It would not.

Q

I have the intention

But if

of residing in

Connecticut indefinitely, then I am, and domicile depends
upon intent.
MR. BROILES:
Q

I think domicile depends upon --

Residence by Intent.

MR. BROILES:

Yes, I don’t think the intent can

reasonably be said to be indefinitely.

The Intent must be to

stay there, having no particular plans to leave at this time
to go someplace else, that this is where I am now.
definitely leaving someplace else.

I am not

11
Q

That isn't leaving?

Residency doesn't even

mean that, then, in Connecticut?
MR. BROILES:
Q

Oh, I don't think so.

I don’t think —

So you could just move to Connecticut for

long enough to take the exam and leave when —
MR. BROILES:

Based on the rules of the State of

Connecticut, that Is quite correct.
Q

That is rule 82.

In other words, as mentioned in this case,

somebody could come from Japan or Uganda or Nepal and just
fill out the questionnaire and take the Connecticut bar exam?
MR. BROILES:
Q
do so.

No, that's a —

That is an absolute constitutional right to

Is that right?
MR. BROILES:

No, that Is absolutely not the position

here.
Q

Well, what —

MR. BROILES:

One has to take — one has to take —

one has to not only fill out the questionnaire but be inter­
viewed by the bar committee.
Q

All right, he is there long enough for an

interview.
MR. BROILES:

And the bar committee is satisfied

as to his qualifications —
Q

All right, he has gone along —

MR. BROILES: — as to his residency in the State

12
of Connecticut and it seems clear under the rule of the
State of Connecticut that he is admissable.

This is what is

constitutionally required.
Q

Constitutionally required is what you say.

MR. BROILES:

No, I am saying that that is what

the rule of the State of Connecticut requires.

I'm not

saying that —
Q

I know, but what the Constitution requires is

that Connecticut must — if a person is otherwise qualified must let him take the bar exam whether or not he is a citizen
so, as I say, he could come from India or Ceylon or Nepal
or Uganda or Tanzania and be there long enough

for an

examination and to show he had gone to law school

and

Connecticut is constitutionally required to let him take the
bar exam and if he passes it, to admit him to the bar of
Connecticut and then he can leave the next night and never
come back.
MR. BROILES:
Q

Well, what is it, then?

MR. BROILES:
require that.

That is not my position —

— and the Constitution does not

The original question asked by you was, with

regard to this, was not the purpose to make sure that there
was a residency — the people were residents of the State of
which they were lawyers and in fact, the State of Connecticut
does not require more than what you have described.

If the

13
State of Connecticut were to require a six-month residency
requirement, that may well withstand the test of constitu­
tionality.

The New Mexico case which you recently denied

cert on —
Q

The issue in this case is whether or not

Connecticut can constitutionally require that a person be a
citizen.
MR. BROILES:
Q

That is correct.

And you have told us that it does not require

that it doesn’t require that he be domiciled in Connecticut.
Therefore, since it doesn't, then your constitutional claim
does come down, does it not, to what I suggest as my questions.
MR. BROILES:
Q

It does not.

Why not?

MR. BROILES:

Connecticut could require,

constitutionally, any —
Q

It could, but It hasn't, you told us.

MR. BROILES:

It has not.

In this case it comes

down to my client, on the Connecticut rule, qualified because
she was, In fact, in the Connecticut opinion of the bar
examiners, a resident under that rule.

That has been so

found and is not disputed, that Connecticut has no further
requirements other than domicile or intention to be a
resident in this case, yes, someone could come to Connecticut
and stay there and if the board was satisfied with that—
Q

He could come from Timbuktu an^so long as

14
he was there long enough for an interview and filled out
question 82, said he was a resident of Connecticut and
intended to stay there, then Connecticut wouldn’t require that
he be a citizen.
MR. BROILES:

Connecticut could change its rule

and require more by way of residency.
Q

I thought your claim was that Connecticut

could not constitutionally require that a person be a citizen.
MR. BROILES:

It cannot require a citizen.

It can

require more by way of residency than it does.
Q

But that is not the issue.

MR. BROILES:
Q

No, that is not the issue.

The issue in your case is whether or not the

Constitution compels Connecticut to allow somebody to take
its bar exam even though that person is not a citizen.

Isn’t

that what this case Is about?
MR. BROILES:
Q

That is what this case is about.

Isn’t it true that under the existing

Connecticut lav;, a man can catch a plane from Anchorage,
Alaska, change in New York, go to New Haven, take the exam
and will be admitted?
MR. BROILES:
yes, your Honor.
Q

That is the way the rule is written,

I did not write the rule nor do I say that —
And go right back to Anchorage?

MR. BROILES:

That is the statement of the rule of

15
the State of Connecticut.

That is not a constitutional

requirement in this case.
Q

And you mean to say that if somebody came from

Canada and did the same thing, he would be entitled to the
same discretion that the person from Anchorage had?
HR. BROILES:

Yes, if the

bar examiners were

satisfied that he met the residency requirement under the
facts that you state, he would be certified by the board to
That
that. / that is a constitutional requirement, I deny.
Q

Well, Mr. Broiles, basically what you are

saying is that if this sort of pugacious presence is acceptable
to the Connecticut bar examiners on the part of someone
coming from Alaska, as Mr. Justice Marshall posits, it is a
constitutional matter and must be acceptable in the same
circumstances except that the person comes from.Canada or
Japan.
MR. BROILES:

I am not sure I understand — if you

are saying that if he comes from Virginia, for example, to
Connecticut and establishes residency under the minimal
requirements of the State of Connecticut presently has, then
he should be able to do that with a resident alien status
from Canada.

Yes, I am saying that, because that is the

Connecticut rule, but I am not saying that this is a
constitutional requirement.

It is not.

They could establish,

I think, a longer residency requirement and stricter

16
standards for residency.
Q

But in no event may they condition it on

being a citizen.
MR. BROILES:

In no event may they condition it

on being a citizen.
Q

Mr. Broiles, looking at the other side of

this coin, what limitations, if any, are there on the length
of time that the petitioner may remain in the United States
as an alien?
MR. BROILES:

With regard to constitutional

considerations by bar examining committee?
Q

No, no, present law.

May an alien remain in

the United States indefinitely?
MR. BROILES:

I come in as a resident alien, a

permanent resident alien, may reside In the United States
indefinitely.

She is subject to loss of that right on

conditions that do not apply to citizens.

If she is guilty

of conduct that is proscribed by the federal statute, you know,
habitual drunkenness ■— that are spelled out in Immigration
Naturalization — she would be subject to deportation.

They

are certainly less stringent rules than one would expect of
a bar association so that were she guilty of those same acts
of misconduct, she should

certainly be disbarred before

she is deported but she Is permanently — has a right to be
here under the present statutory scheme

17
Q

That la because she is married to a citizen,

is it?
MR. BROILES:

No, your Honor, she in fact got that

status before she married a United States citizen.

The — by

virtue of the fact of marrying a citizen, she achieves one
thing that she did not have earlier and that is that she could
become a United States citizen in three years rather than
five years.

But she got her permanent residency status prior

to marrying a United States citizen.
I’d like to address myself to one inquiry raised by
the brief of the State of Connecticut and that is that
Graham versus Richardson does not apply in this case with
regard to the standard that the classification based on
alienage Is subject to strict judicial scrutiny and that the
State of Connecticut must show a compelling interest that this
classification is necessary to meet.
This is stated on page five of the brief of the
State of Connecticut where it Is held that no inquiry
beyond reasonableness is really needed.

The reason that an

alienage classification thus receives special scrutiny,
namely the aliens nonparticipation In government, fails here
because the nonparticipation is the purpose served by the
classification.
As I understand that statement, the State of
Connecticut is saying that Graham does not apply because of

18
the fact that the very exclusion of aliens from the process of
government is the purpose of the rule.

I would take it that

what they mean is that if aliens had the right to vote, there
would be no holding by this court that under the l4th
Amendment all such classifications are subject to strict
judicial scrutiny.
I would point out two examples where this is not
the case.

That is, that the franchise, or the right to vote,

is not the purpose for the strict judicial scrutiny rule.
Children cannot vote and to my knowledge, this Court has not
said that by virtue thereof all classifications with regard to
children are subject to the standard in Graham, a strict
judicial scrutiny of the necessary and compelling interest.
Secondly, convicted felons cannot vote.

I would be

surprised if this court would seriously entertain an attack
on the 1968 Crime Control Act gun provisions that govern
felons possessions of registered and unregistered firearms
on the grounds that they cannot vote.
The reason that classifications based on alienage
are subject to strict judicial scrutiny is because of their
analagous characteristic to racial
classifications based on sex.
to show' a compelling interest

classifications and

The State of Connecticut has
that is furthered by this

classification and that the means are necessary for this —
Q

Is it your position — v/ould your position
0

19
necessarily outlaw the exclusion of aliens from voting?
MR. BROILES:

It would not necessarily outlaw It,

but I would put it this way, your Honor.

The question would

be, could a prohibition, as all the states have, against
voting by aliens, withstand the test of Graham that it meet
a strict —
Q

What do you think about that?

MR. BROILES:

I think that it cannot.

I think that

under the holding in Graham, that the fact that an alien
suffers the disabilities must pay the taxes, must be subject
to all the laws of the government, will be a strong argument
and that a strong constitutional —
Q

And one that you think should prevail?

MR. BROILES:

I think that on the facts as I

understand it, it would prevail, yes, your Honor.
Q

If the voting restrictions were to be

sustained, I presume it might be connected with the idea of
excluding aliens from the processes of government and decisionmaking?
MR. BROILES:

I would think that that would be

one reason.
Q

And if that were to be sustained, you might

be in more fcx'ouble.

You would have a troublesome case here,

wouldn’t you?
MR. BROILES:

I would say It would make my case

20
more troublesome to answer that, yes, your Honor.
Q

It is a little strange to think that a

classification that Is made in the Constitution Itself in
many different provisions of the Constitution — I.e., between
citizens and other persons who are not citizens living in the
United States, is that that classification is constitutionally
suspect.

The 14th Amendment Itself makes that --makes those

classifications.

The 15th Amendment gives the right of the

franchise to citizens, not to persons.
The 14th Amendment gives some protections to
citizens that it doesn’t give to persons.

It gives some to

all persons and there are other places all through the
Constitution where you find that distinction and isn't it a
little odd, do you suppose, to be saying that that is a
constitutionally suspect classification?
MR. BROILES:

I'll have to answer that both with

a yes and no by some examples, your Honor.

I think there is

a difference under — even if the Court went so far as
Mr. Justice White has said that these rules might compel it.
There Is still a difference between an alien and a citizen.
The 14th Amendment talks about the privileges and immunities
of citizenship.

A citizen, by virtue of the 14th Amendment,

has the privilege permanently to reside in the state as a
citizen of that

state, no matter what his conduct may be,

and he is immune from the loss of his citizenship or from

21
deportation from the United States, no matter what his
conduct may be or what we may think of him.

That is not the

case, that is not a privilege or immunity of an alien.

An

alien is entitled only to due process and equal protection
of the laws.
Q

Well, he is entitled to those same rights as

against the state, isn’t he?
MR. BROILES:
process?

Equal protection of the laws and due

Or from deportation?
Q

Prom what you just said, yes.

MR. BROILES:

A state cannot take away — he is

entitled -- cannot have that taken away.
Q

Yes, the state can’t chase him out, anyway.

MR. BROILES:

The state could not chase him out.

Now, there — to —
Q

The state protection extends only to citizens,

the protection of the 15th Amendment extends only to citizens.
MR. BROILES:
of distinctions.
Q

There are jobs —
Well, there is this distinction —

MR. BROILES:
Q

I realize the Constitution is full

Yes?

Here is my point.

There are many other

distinctions, of course, as well, but precisely the one which
you are now telling us is suspect under the Constitution.
MR. BROILES:

Would have to meet the test that is

22
laid down in Graham of showing a compelling interest, yes.
That is not the case that has to be decided here.

What the

record might show with regard to voting is another matter.
What the record shows in this case with regard to attorneys
is quite different.
This case is one step removed from the decision
you must make in the case that was argued yesterday, Sugarman.
We do not concede that our client has the status of a
governmental official.
the government.

She is not asking to be a member in

She is asking to be an attorney in the

State of Connecticut.
The state seeks to analogize her to a governmental
official.

They seek to analogize her by virtue of the

position that she would

hold as an attorney in Connecticut,

as a Commissioner of the Superior Court.
The state argues this on what they call a "selfevident proposition" that after all, the government of the
State of Connecticut has a right to limit its positions to
citizens thereof.

In fact, the State of Connecticut does not

limit positions for attorneys or Commissioners of Superior
Courts to citizens of the State of Connecticut.
I am both an attorney in the State of Connecticut;
I am a Commissioner in the Superior Court.
the State of Connecticut.

I cannot vote in

I am not a resident of the State

of Connecticut and yet I have all of these positions that

23

they seek to deny my client on the grounds that she is not a
citizen.

The difference is that the State of Connecticut

does not compel citizenship of Connecticut.

The State of

Connecticut compels citizenship of the United States.
Q

What oath does a practitioner in Connecticut

take when - -?
MR. BAILES:

The practitioner9 as an attorney,

takes the oath that he will not be guilty of any malice or
take anybody's money without just representation or allow any
fraud to be perpetrated on the court.
The significant oath is called the"oath of the
Commissioner's Courtor the Superior Courts and that oath
is 3 "I will uphold the Constitution of the United States and
of the State of Connecticut so long as I remain a citizen
thereof."

That is the Connecticut statute, section —
Q

"So long as I remain a citizen."

MR. BROILES:

"So long as I remain a citizen

thereof."
Q

So the oath means nothing for an alien.

MR. BROILES:
yes.

The oath certainly means something,

It is a symbol that is willing to do just precisely —
Q

It only implies that as long as you are a

citizen.
MR. BROILES:

That is correct, your Honor.

Obviously, I am no longer a citizen thereof and still have all

24

of the positions of axi attorney.

That does not .make the oath

meaningless when I take it.
Q

Mrs. Griffiths would not, on your thesis,

would not be a citizen at the time she was admitted, if she
wore admitted?
MR. BROILES:
Q

That is correct, sir.

So the oath would have just what meaning?

MR. BROILES:

We have suggested that the very

statute in question provides for an alternative oath and that
she should be required to take the oath that she will uphold
the Constitution of the United States and the
Connecticut.

State of

The "so long as she remains a citizen thereof,"

obviously, she can’t assert that.

That can’t be a meaningful

part of the oath for someone who is not a citizen of either
one.
In the alternative, if the State of Connecticut,
which has not ruled on the possibility of a judge changing
this oath and the power to administer alternative oaths, is
vested in the judiciary — if they will not change the oath,
then under the argument, the oath would have to be
unconstitutional because it would just be another way of
requiring that all applicants for admission to the bar be
citizens.
Q

is this form of oath in here somewhere?

MR. BROILES:

Yes it is, your Honor.

I’m sorry,

25
the form of the oath?
Q

Yes.

I®. BROILES:

Is In the supplemental — Is in the

Appendix to the jirisdietional statement, page *14 of my -—
Q

Page 44?

MR, BROILES:

Page 44.

That is the oath of the

attorney.
Q

Thank you.

Q

Is there

any rule in Holland governing Its

citizens that they should not

take oaths of loyalty to

foreign governments or to foreign constitutions?
MR. BROILES:
the problem.

Yes, there is, your Honor.

That is

If my client takes the oath, as required under

the Naturalization Act, she will lose her Dutch citizenship.
Q

And so she — yes, but what if she — can

she swear to support the Constitution of the United States
consistent with the laws of Holland?
MR. BROILES:

Yes, she can, your Honor and has

stated throughout that she will take the oath —
Q

Now, what is the restriction in Holland, that

if you take an oath —* if you become a citizen of a foreign
state, you lose your Dutch citizenship?
MR. BROILES:
Q

That Is the only restriction.

You could nevertheless swear to support the

Constitution of the United States?

26
HR. BROILES:
Q

And the State of Connecticut.

Now, if Holland and the United States were

at war, now, I suppose by swearing to support the Constitution
of the United States, might be treason in Holland?
MR. BROILES:

If you are asking me to speculate

on that, there would 3eem to be that possibility, yes.
Certainly, if this oath were taken after the
declaration of war between the two countries, that would be
a strong presumption, that it would be taken before —
Q

So that her oath here, she prefers her

Dutch citizenship to American citizenship and that is pretty
clear.
MR. BROILES:
Q

That's true.

Which is — that is clear in this case and In

the time of war, her oath to support the Constitution irould
be somewhat less meaningful, I suppose.
MR. BROILES:

I take it she would really have to

make an election at that time, yes, your Honor.

We are not

saying the fact of alienage is totally irrelevant as a clue
that the bar character committee can consider in passing on
applications.
We are saying that across-the-board prohibition
against aliens does not meet the standard laid down in
Graham of furthering a compelling state interest.
Q

Well, what does alienage -have to do \vith

27

character?
MR. BROILES:

We think that alienage has very little

to do with character.
Q
character.

Well, yes, it is irrelevant to a person's
I mean, a person could have been a patriotic

German in World War II and had the finest character, but we
were at war with that country and probably wouldn't have
admitted somebody like that to our bar in between 1941 and
1945, but it has nothing to do with that person's character.
MR. BROILES:
agree with you.

I think alienage is totally irrelevant to

admission to the bar.
Q

In so — you know, I certainly tend to

Obviously, four other states do, too.

Irrelevant to character.

MR. BROILES:

Now, the question is

Well, I use the term "character"

possibly broader than your Honor does in that it seems to me
that under the decisions there are two general classifications,
competence and character.
Now, in Baird and Law Students1' Research Council,
what you classified under character included inquiries into
political beliefs and loyalty.

Nov/, what we are obviously

talking about here when we talk about citizenship and noncitizenship has something to do with allegiance, as
Mr. Justice White has averred to numerous times.

That is

what I mean when I say it falls under character.

We are

talking about the types of things dealing with loyalty oaths,

28
which is precisely what this court has dealt with, with
regard to admission to the bar.
that oath?

The answer is yes.

Can she conscientiously take
It has never been disputed

that she can conscientiously take the oath.
Q

Except that she knows and you know that in

one contingency, the oaths will mean nothing.
MR. BROILES:

She may elect United States* citizen­

ship on that contingency.
Q

I don't know what she will do.

She may not, too.

MR. BROILES:

Then, obviously, she will have her —

this government —
Q

You will never know, though, till it is too

late.
MR. BROILES:

Do you know in advance what you might

elect with regard to contingencies concerning wars in the
United States?

I don’t think there are any of us can predict

those contingencies forever in the future.

I think that is a

contingency not altogether unique to an alien or to a non­
citizen .
Q

Well, what Connecticut is saying is it has a

right to do, is to eliminate people with the peculiar sort
of contingency that your client might face.
MR. BROILES:

That's right.

That is what the State

of Connecticut is saying and —
Q

And it applies to everyone who happens to be

29
a resident alien.
MR. BROILES:
Q

It applies to all resident aliens.

It also applies to the resident alien who

has decided that next year I am going to take out citizenship.
MR. BROILES:
it applies to one

It applies to all — yes, your Honor,

x\rho has filed a declaration of intent to

be a citizen.
Q

Mr. Broiles, If the Graham case were not on

the books, would you be here?
MR. BROILES:

Yes, I would.

In fact, this case was

brought before any knowledge of the Graham case.

It was

filed in 1970, before Graham was decided by the three-judge
court and Graham was decided by this court after it was
appealed to the Connecticut Supreme Court.

It follows from

the Truax decision.
Q

So that in your opinion, you don't have to

rely on Graham?
MR. BROILES:

I don't see any inconsistency between

TRuax and Graham and I think those are the main cases that
interpret the 14th Amendment this way and I think the answer
to your question is, you do not have to rely exclusively on
Graham.
Truax was or was it not an equal protection case?
MR. BROILES:
Thank you.

Truax was an equal protection case.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Tiernan.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE R. TIERNAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR. TIERNAN:

Mr. Chief Justice and the members of

this Court:
The issue really revolves about this point, that the
applicant here is seeking admission to take the bar examination
in Connecticut, hopefully with the final expectation of
admission to the bar —
Q

Would you raise your voice a little,

Mr. Tiernan?
MR. TIERNAN:

Yes.

That she is seeking admission

to the bar of the State of Connecticut on her own terms, to
some degree at least.

When she was examined before the

committee, one of the committees which,

of course, acts as

an agency for the judicial department of the state, the
courts of the state in the procedure for bar admission which,
of course, appears in the

Appendix.

She was inquired of as

to her residence and so forth, beginning at page 30.
the transcript

This is

the hearing before the Committee on

Recommendations.
Now, when the question arrived as to her citizenship,
she

unequivocally stated that she was not and that she had

no plans of becoming one.
The inquiry and interrogation stopped at that point

31
by the committee.

The first question posed here by the

bench satisfies me that that is a natural inquiry and, to my
view, the first inquiry.

Why didn't someone ask why?

Now, of course, the first and basic requirement of
the Connecticut rules, which has been in effect for about a
century, is, first, that he is a citizen of the United States.
Just prior to that, there is a statement, "To enti­
tle an applicant to admission to the bar, except in section 12."
One might very well say, well, what is that exception about?
The exception 12 merely refers to the admission on
motion from other states by attorneys in the states of this
country.
Q

Would you tell me what requirements for

citizenship of Connecticut are?
MR. TIERNAN:
Q

What do you mean by that, sir?

How do you become a citizen of the State of

Connecticut?
MR. TIERNAN:

No, the citizen of the United States,

of course, in order to become a citizen — when you become a
citizen of the United States, of course, you become a citizen
of a state, apparently of residence, where you are.
There is no specific — every citizen of the
United States is also a citizen of a state and owes allegiance
to both, United States versus Lander 260 U.S. 377, a case
decided here in 1922.

32
Q

Well, so far as Connecticut requires, there is

no requirement that he be a citizen of Connecticut, is there?
MR. TIERNAN:
Q

No.

It is simply a requirement that he be a.

citizen of the United States.
MR. TIERNAN:

The only requirement Is that he is a

citizen of the United States and then the second question,
which was —
Q

Has to do with residence —

MR. TIERNAN:

That is right, Mr. Justice Stewart,

that is correct, that he is a resident of this state or intends
to become such resident.
Now, of course, that question was really not
followed at all.

Our inquiry following the unqualified

statement by this applicant before said committee that she
had no intention of becoming a citizen, that was —
Q

In the eyes of the law, if a man says, I

intend to become a citizen, is he allowed to be admitted to
the bar?
MR. TIERNAN:

Well, of course,the rule doesn’t

limit it just to — it says, an applicant to the admission to
the bar and of course only one of the steps is the citizenship.
Now, the question of whether a persons says "I have
filed declaration —"
Q

No, no.

My question is, he says, " I intend,"

33
the language of the rule says, "I Intend to become a
citizen."

Would he be admitted?
MR. TIERNAN;

That has not been decided, but I

presume that he \fould not until he evidenced by some direct
manifestation such filing declarations.
Q

Well, he files his declaration.

Would he

be admitted?
MR. TIERNAN:

That I could not answer under the

specific rule, but I have —
Q

Well, doesn't the rule say that?

MR. TIERNAN;
right.

As to residence, of course, that is

One comprehends the other.
Q

Right.

MR. TIERNAN;

Q

And I have no doubt —

And then, he becomes admitted and he with­

draws his application.

Is he still a member of the bar or

not?
MR. TIERNAN;

He Is admitted to what, your Honor?

To the bar or to the examination?
Q

To the bar.

MR. TIERNAN;

Well, he couldn’t be admitted to bar

under those circumstances.
Q

Until when?

MR. TIERNAN:
of the United States

Until he Is qualified as a citizen

34
Q

He has to then become a citizen before he

comes to the bar?
MR. TIERNAN:
Q

Yes.

But he can take the exam, on intent?

MR. TIERNAN:

On a declaration of intent.

Q

which I don’t think affects this

And —

case at all.
MR. TIERNAN:
Q

No.

How do you look at Truax against Raich?

MR. TIERNAN:
question.

Now, uh —

That's a very — that's a vital

That is the vital question.
May I just —
Q

Sure, go on.

MR.TIERNAN:
Q

Thank you verymuch.

Sure.

MR. TIERNAN:

The one thing that occurs to me is

the fact that this court does not have any machinery for
admission to the bar.

Presumably that, through the history

of this court, is because —
Q
be heard

Stay near the microphone if you want to

back here.
MR. TIERNAN:

Excuse me.

I have been accustomed to

being heard in the past.
Q

Yes, butwe alsorecord

MR. TIERNAN:

this proceeding.

Oh, I beg your pardon.

This court

35
derives its qualifications, to a great degree, in practicing
before this court, by state standards.

Presumably, because

they believe through the past, that they are proficient
enough to be accepted and, of course, the federal system
has no separate or distinct machinery for admitting people
to practice before it.
Now, one of the basic rules

of admission in this

court is that the applicant for practice before this court,
as today, must represent that they practiced in a state of
this country for a period of three years.
It would be difficult to understand how a person
could make a solid showing for permission to practice here
on that requirement, because, of course, up till a year — this
year there was no single state that unequivocally, by
decision, decided or found

that citizenship was not required

for admission to the bar.
Now, in reference to Graham —
Q

In that connection, Mr. Tiernan, you have

admission by motion in Connecticut, as I understood from your
prior remark.
MR. TIERNAN:
Q

That is correct.

Suppose — well, there are states today which

permit a person to be admitted to the bar without proof of
citizenship.
MR. TIERNAN:

Yes.

Yes, there are a couple.

36
Q

And if someone presented himself to the

Connecticut bar authorities with his proof of admission in
one of those states, would Connecticut admit him by motion?
MR. TIERNAN:

No, because under section 13 of the

rules, subparagraph three, one of the requirements in addition
to his practice in the other state is that he is a citizen of
the United States.

That is common to both nonresident or

those applying on motion and those applying directly.
Q

And yet here he could be admitted if he had

three years behind him?

MR. TIERNAN:
Q

Three years —

Three years of practice.

MR. TIERNAN:

Yes, three years plus the character

affidavits.
Of course, I take it that this issue is not similar
to the issues raised by the factual situation raised in
Graham and Dunn versus Blausteln voting rights, social
benefits in Graham because, of course, in that — in those
cases we have the situation where — with reference to
C-raham, which advanced that compelling interest, state
interest test, to be applied in aliens’ classifications.
Right there it seems to me that that case
distinguished in the situation there because of course the
financial integrity of a state wa3 involved, just as in
Shapiro, nothing about anything else.

That was a case where

37
they were trying to deprive people visiting the state for
welfare benefits on the grounds of no duration of residence
or citizenship and they said that the state had to show a
compelling state interest.
That is hardly to be, I think, compared with
admission to the bar because, of course, the reference that
was made to the brief concerning the special judicial
scrutiny required — as a matter of fact, the mere situation
in Graham in the voting case in Graham and Shapiro, the
right to travel

which, although it doesn’t appear

specifically in the Constitution, has been Inserted therein
by judicial decision and the fundamental right of travel
of people in this country was restricted, says this Court
in those cases.

But in the Graham case, there was a

discussion concerning one of the tests used in our history
of special interest and in that very case, Graham on page 37^,
*103, this court stated that although the special interest
test was rejected so far as the social benefits were
concerned — social benefit cases which, of course, GRaham
represented, this Court specifically said, ’’Whatever may be
the contemporary vitality of the special public interest
doctrine and other context after Takahashl, we conclude —”
so forth.
In other words, this very Court left open even the
application of a special interest test.

38
Now, Mr. Justice Marshall, you referred to the —
how about Truax?

Which, of course, is the case that,

obviously, when this country grants entrance and abode to an
alien, obviously, one follows the other.
The early efforts, of course, when this question
was raised, in this country, from a country that once had
many aliens when we were in the formative stages — when that
question was raised here, as in the Truax case, the Court
said it was limited to the right of an alien to indulge in
the common occupations of man or sometimes referred to as the
common, I believe, "industrial occupations."
That has always been interpreted, even by writers,
scholarly writers, law -writers, that that did not Include
the professions.
Now, incidentally, in this connection, efforts have
been made to add to that.
Q

Would you give me that "scholarly ^^riter?,,

MR. TIERNAN:

The Columbia Law Review

—

51

Columbia Law Review 10/26 in 1957, the title of which is,
"Constitutionality of the restrictions on aliens' rights to
work."
Q

My

question was the name of the scholarly

writer.
MR. TIERNAN:
for you.

I didn't have the name, your Honor,

39
Q

I couldn't find it, either.

MR. TIERNAN:

The name?

No, I couldn’t, either.

That is correct and that is why I didn't give you any name.
Q

3ut it is said —-

MR. TIERNAN:

No, it isn’t, it is a comment, I think.

No, It isn't
Q

It is a student comment.

MR. TIERNAN:
Q

I don’t know whether it was —

It is a student comment; that is all it is.

MR. TIERNAN:

Well, there wese others.

That was

just a —
Q

It xfas a scholarly student's comment.

(Laughter.)
But what can you point to me in Truax that

says

it is limited in

any

fashion at all?

And I think you

will agree that Chief Justice Hughes didn’t use broad
language unless he meant it.
MR. TIERNAN:
Q

Yes.

He said it was a denial of equal protection

for a state to draw the line between the alien and the
citizen in the matter of employment and right to make a
living.
MR. TIERNAN:

Yes, but of course, how can this be

considered as all-inclusive and have any meaning to the
14th Amendment?

40
Q

Pardon me ?

MR. HERMAN:

How could this be considered as being

all-inclusive for all forms of occupation, activity,
including the professions, when it is indicated classifications
are permissible.

They must be justified.

After all, even

bar admission rules must be within the framework of the
Constitution but how can we ever permit any classifications,
if such, so far as employment is concerned, if that is so
now?
Q

And do you agree that the State of Connecticut

could not say that redhaired people couldn't be admitted?
MR. TIERNAN:
Q

Of course.

MR. TIERNAN:
Q

I hope not.
Of course.

Uh, the —

Well, what is the reason that the aliens —

this is all aliens.

This is the — is it competence or is

it character or what is it?
MR. TIERNAN:
Q

Well, no, it is — uh —

What is it?

MR. TIERNAN:

Well, as a matter of fact,

Mr. Justice Marshall, I believe history records that when
Connecticut was saying no to aliens, they were saying yes to
women.

Nov;, I don't knov; whether that would be called —

and that was some time ago.
Q

I am only asking about aliens.

Why are they

excluded?

Why?
MR. TIERNAN:

Because, in the State of Connecticut,

the court has established by — presented, I should say, by
its decision, that because of the status and the position of
the lawyer in the state —- there are other conditions of
qualification that are required, citizenship, residency,
educational requirements — they say, the court stated, that
in order to have a system toward the administration of
justice and in the public interest In Connecticut, a laxtfyer
who is clothed with the right to command actions by authority
of the State of Connecticut in connection with his affairs
both private, both public and in his reference to
individuals, as a counselor —
Q

Do you mean that an alien is more dangerous

in his private life than a citizen?
MR. TIERNAN:
Q

No.

No.

Do you —

MR. TIERNAN:
Q

No.

No.

— say then, an alien is less competent

than a citizen?
MR. TIERNAN:
Q

No, I didn't say that.

Do you say that an alien has less character

than a citizen? '
MR. TIERNAN:

What you are trying to say is, an

alien is an irrational classification per se.

This court

42
has not said so. but you have the opportunity to say it
right now.
Q

WE11, I am waiting for you to give us a

reason why we shouldn’t say it.
MR. TIERNAN:
Q

Well —

I am still waiting for that reason.

MR. TIERNAN:

I am backing up the court in this

case in tvhieh I represent; in Connecticut, the court stated
that because of the position that member of the bar holds,
that citizenship is a requirement, that there is nothing
irrational about the state asking for that in accordance with
the precepts set down by the decisions of this court and in
the first place, as one said, just examine the duties of a
lawyer, his relationship both to the individual, the public,
his connection with the court, his involvement with the rules,
his involvement of the procedure and the changing procedure
and changing rules — all this Is connected with the
government —
Q

Am I correct that this applicant has two

law degrees?
MR. TIERNAN:

There are three degrees.

I think

one is —
Q

Well, two?

MR. TIERNAN:
degree from

There is no question she has a

43
Q

Wells Isn’t she qualified to understand the

rules?
MR. TIERNAN:
Q
the rules.

Oh, she — she —

Well, you said the lawyer has to understand
Well, she is qualified.

You don’t question that,

do you?
MR. TIERNAN:

I didn’t say she —■ It is obvious she

understood the rules because she so admitted in the transcript.
She was asked If she was aware of the rules and she said
yes, and she signed the affidavit of the application.
Q

I am still trying to get the reason.

She —
You

haven’t — at least haven’t satisfied me of any reason at
all except the fact that she Is an alien.
MR. TIERNAN:

Well, in the first place, If your

Honor please, the court stated, really, three things.

The

court stated that, first, a lawyer in Connecticut, as
generally stated, Is an officer of the court.
Secondly, that in Connecticut, in addition to
that, the attorney Is a commissioner of the Superior Court.
And in that connection, the commissioner of the Superior
Court of Connecticut has the right — has the right to sign
civil process suits and command executive officers to serve
those documents in the state and —
Q

Well, this man sitting beside you is now a

resident of Fort Worth, Texas and can go up there and serve

one right now.

Am I correct?

MR. TIERNAN:

Well, he can’t serve it.

He can

sign it, yes, your Honor.
Q

Couldn’t he?

MR. HERMAN:

Any member of the bar that has a

commission automatically becomes on the Superior Court.
Q

He can drop up there and serve one and go

back to Port Worth and that doesn't offend Connecticut at all.
MR. TIERNAN:
0.

I Uh ~

As a matter of fact, he could move to

Honolulu and come back and do

it.

Furthermore, he could

move to the Netherlands.
Am I correct that he could move to the Netherlands
and come back and do commissioner work?
MR. TIERNAN:

Well, of course, as long as he

returned — as long as he retains his position in
Con necticut *—
Q

Right.

MR. TIERNAN:

— whether known by the authorities

or not, in whatever connection, he has, of course, closed
with the rights of the office that he has.
Q

Would he lose it if he took out Netherlands

citizenship?
MR. TIERNAN:
obviously a

Well, of course, that would be

question that would have to —

Q

Would he?

MR. TIERNAN:

Under those rules?

Well, there is no rule here that says

that you can be a citizen of two countries and still be a
lawyer, and, of course —
Q

Well, if a person gives up his citizenship,

does he resign from the bar
MR. TIERNAN:

automatically?

If he gives up his citizenship,

what, sir?
Q

If he gives up his citizenship, his United

States citizenship,

does he lose his bar membership in

Connecticut?
MR. TIERNAN:
Q

Oh, no, there is no such provision.

So that this man x?ho is sitting here now,

Mr. Broiles, can go to the Netherlands, live in the Nether­
lands, take out Netherlands citizenship and he will still be
able to practice law in Connecticut?
Am I right or wrong?
MR. TIERNAN:
Q

By what test or standard do you mean?

Under the law in Connecticut, right now.

MR. TIERNAN:

Well, there is no specific provision

that covers any particular case, if your Honor please.
Q

Well, there is nothing in the law that says

once he loses his citizenship he loses his right to practice
law.
MR. TIERNAN:

Well, I assume that that can be

46
considered without any specific reference thereto.
Q

Well, I don’t see any —

HR. TIERNAN:

Then you get into the International

question or the federal question
I

of citizen — you know, may

just call attention of this Court to the fact that in

this particular case there was question raised at the
committee hearings as to whether or not there was any treaty
existing between the Netherlands and the United States and
the applicant said there was no treaty concerning reciprocal
rights of either national to practice in the state or country
of the other, but, actually, at that very time, there was
a treaty, and is, a treaty between the Netherlands and the
United States which, in declaring the national treatment of
the nationals of either country, specifically excluded, by
the protocol of that treaty, the professions.
Q

Is It in those treaties?

HR. TIERNAN:
Q

It was, after the treaties in 1956.

While I have interrupted you, Mr. Tiernan,

let me ask you one other question, which really isn’t your
case, but it still bothers me.
MR. TIERNAN:
Q

Yes.

Am I correct in my understanding that

Connecticut, in addition to requiring citizenship for
attorneys and physicians, also requires it for funeral
directors and embalmers and hairdressers and barbers and

47
sanitarians?
MR. TIERNAN:

Yes, that was listed in the original

court decision of the Supreme Court as a reference at the
Appendix.
Q

Is it a fact that the state does this?

MR. TIERNAN:

The statutes are still there.
?

Q

Did you include Marquesett?

MR. TIERNAN:

I did.

That is almost becoming moot

in Connecticut, but that is a fact that those statutes are
still there.
Q

Because there are no barbers — or?

MR. TIERNAN:

You see, I come from Neiv Haven,

Justice White,and the demand is lessening.
(Laughter.)
Now, with reference to the Belle!, Rogers versus
Belief, the question of dual citizenship, of course, raises
a problem.

This has been reiterated in the courts of this —

in this Court in the decisions of this Court and it is
impossible in the case of lawyers to imagine that a person
with dual nationality, dual citizenship, dual allegiance,
that
would be able to fulfill the tasks that/person has in
reference to the practice of law.
Q

Have we got dual citizenship Involved here?

MR. TIERNAN:

Well, it isn’t because, of course,

this applicant wants it this way.

Being a citizen of the

Netherlands —
Q

Well, I don’t

— she doesn’t claim dual

citizenship in any -—
MR. TIERNAN:
Q

No.

No.

Well, how is it in this case?

MR. TIERNAN:
is going; to have opts.

Well, she is getting around that.

She

She is going to be a citizen of the

Netherlands, her country of origin, and the right to practice
law in Connecticut and if that isn’t having it both ways, I
can’t imagine what is.
The fact Is that — also referred to here — In
this situation — is the case of Schware, the case to which —
it’s about the only case that set down the test of what is
necessary for the admission standards, reasonableness was
required and it is felt that here that the rule in
Connecticut is reasonable and rational with reference to the
admission of any candidate for the bar of Connecticut.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:03 o’clock a.m., the case was
submitted.)
