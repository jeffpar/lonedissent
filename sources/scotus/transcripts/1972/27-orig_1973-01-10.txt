That original complaint

At that time, Ohio claimed that the

boundary existed at the low

water mark on the north side of

the river, that is, on the Ohio side, as it stood in 1792,
which was the date at which Kentucky became a state.
Kentucky filed an answer and it claimed that the
boundary lay at the present low water mark on the north side
of the river, on -the Ohio side.

That, of course, was much

farther up on the Ohio shore than the old 1792 line because of
the new dams which have been put in on the Ohio River,
beginning back in 1890; the planning began, the dame were
erected.

That was done, and after about four or five months
study, a recommendation was made to the attorney general that
the effort be made -to ask this Court to admit an amendment
of the complaint in order to permit Ohio to make an argument

That was

And what we did was to add the first

count of the complaint, that is , alleging that the real
boundary between the two states lies in the middle of the
river.

And then there were some minor alterations in the

further parts of the original complaint.

That is, if the

Court disagrees with us on permitting us to amend the—or if
the Master were to find against us on the middle of the
river, then wa would still argue for the 1792 line.
And the third question involved is the question of
concurrent jurisdiction, which is, I think, irrelevant as
far as the present proceeding is concerned.
The Court referred our motion to the Master, and
that was argued before the Master in December, 1971.
April he filed his report making a recommendation.

recommendation was that our motion to amend be denied

So far, they have not even had the chance to

That statement is without any

And, of course, we do not

agree to it.

oral argument?
MR. HOWARD?

Of course# our pool ti.cn is that he

misread those cases.
Q

Yes, I understand that.

MR. HOWARD:

They ware not talking .about the

middle of the river at all or anything of that sort.

They

were talking only about the margin of the river, that is,
between the low water mark and the bank of the river.
Q

Would you take the position, Mr. Howard, that

the issue of acquiescence over a period of 150 years is
basically a factual one. that you would want to call witnesses
on and have a factual determination rather than just a legal
one?
MR, HOWARD?

Yes, that is right.

It could be a

legal one if there were some action on the part, for instance,
of the governor or the legislature of the state, which
actually did acquiesce.

Or as in Indiana cases.

There was

a compact between the two states.

But the Court directed

And the same thing is before the Court

right now in the Continental Shelf cases.

Those also depend

on the original California submerged lands case.

case but the dictum in the case would 'have to be overruled.
Q

The rationale.

MR. HOWARD:
Q

Well—

Whatever you can call it.

The reason for

giving judgment to the winner of that case would have to be—
MR. HOWARD:

No, sir, because the reason that land

was above the low water mark anyway and there was no reason
for the Court saying anything about the middle of the river.
He could have decided it simply by saying that this land lies

between the lew eater "«ark on the north sicle and the Indiana
banko

Consequently—
Q

Would you not have to disapprove or reject

that italicised statement on. page 5 from Handily?
MR. HOWARD?
Q

Yes, sir.

"But when, as in this case, one state is the

original proprietor," efc cetera.

That is the reason they gave for reaching

their judgment in that case?

I mean, there might have been

another reason but that is the reason they gave?
MR. HOWARD:
Yes.

Yes, that is the reason they gave.

Of course, our position is that Chief Justice Marshall

was a Virginian, of course, and nobody raised this question
of where the boundary line lay, was it in the middle of the
river or the north shore? so, he did not even go into it.
Later on when question of title came up in the
Worcester v. Georg-ia case, he had to go into it very
thoroughly, and what he said there is in direct conflict
With what he said in the Handly case.
I really think I would just be repeating what I
have said already if I go through, because questions that
have been addressed to me have brought out the main argument

that we are making.

AFTERNOON SESSION - It02 o'clock
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Famularo,

ORAL•ARGUMENT OF JOHN M. FAMULARO, ESQ.,
CN BEHALF OF THE DEFENDANT
MR. FAMULARO:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

mi ■

please' the Court:
Mr. Howard has fairly stated the fact:-.*. arr.ct histtry
of this case.
this point.

However, we wish to eraphas
First, we wish to point out that Kentucky lid

challenge, the sufficiency of the all
cause of action but that we did not do this in the form of
an affirmative defense.

We rather raised it as a point of

law much as a common law demur.

And that point was that

the allegations of the State of Ohio are immaterial.

That is,

if they are true, they in no way change the boundary which
was established by Congress long ago, based upon the cession
of Virginia and the acts of Congress thereto.
Secondly, we wish to point out that in the original
complaint of 1966 the State of Ohio conceded that the
boundary between the states of Kentucky and Ohio was the
low water mark on the northern shore as that mark existed in
1792.

They further conceded that the states involved in the

Ifandly6s Lessee v, Anthony case, that is, Indiana and
Kentucky, should control as between Ohio and Kentucky based
upon the identical title relationship of the parties.

Thus, they recognized that Handly was controlling
and should control as between Ohio and Kentucky*

And they

have recognised this for more than 150 years since the
decision in Handly*

At least it has been recognised to the

extent that they ware judicially aware of Handly and

yet

have sat by inactively for a period of at least 150 years:
until the amendment is now sought attempts
the boundary in the middle of the river*
he

dation

Master was correct for two basic reasons*

The first, reason

is what we refer to as the immateriality of anv alleged

k

effect in the title of Virginia where the boundary was
clearly fixed by Congress based upon the

cession of Virginia

and the acts of Congress*
Secondly» we submit that the Special Master's
recommendation was correct due to the judicial admissions
found in the 1366 pleadings and the judicial and historical
acquiescence upon the part of Ohio» which is undisputed*

Let

us briefly deal with the first allegation.
Ohio claims that the boundary is in the middle of
the river now» based upon an alleged defect in Virginia's
title due to various pre-Revolutionary War documents and
actions by the British Crown.
We submit that after the Revolutionary War all the
territories situated within the United States' was a part of

the United States and any claim or derivative claim of the
British Crown was clearly extinguished by the
Revolutionary War.
Once Virginia ceded the land situate lying and
being to the north of the River Ohio for the sole purpose of
creating new states and once the Sovereign United States
accepted this cession and the terms thereof and recognised
the sovereignty of Virginia over the entire river, any
defect in that title to the land north of the river is
clearly immaterial.
The only two parties involved, the Sovereign State
of Virginia and the Sovereign United States, based upon the
negotiations involved, recognized that the boundary was to be
on the northern show.

Certainly they had the authority to

act and did so, and the boundary was clearly established as
residing within Virginia on the northern shore and all the
land south of the river.

This was determined long before

the State of Ohio was ever created.

And Ohio is in no

position now to vindicate the rights of the province of
Quebec or to vindicate the rights of the Indians.

They can

only vindicate any rights that they have acquired since they
became a state, and we submit that clearly the boundary was
determined based upon the acceptance of Congress of the
Virginia cession.
It is that law that is the lav; of the Sovereign

not the law of any foreign political entity.

The Special

Master has not rejected this, as Ohio claims; and if indeed
Judge Forman did» this Court can certainly hold otherwise.
We submit that the cession of the Virginia and the
legislative enactments did indeed become the subject of
judicial interpretation.

In Handly*s Lessee y

Supreme Court judicially recognised and accepted th&
legislative enactments involved and resolve aha boundary
dispute reasoning to the language of the cession cl Virgini;;;
itself and also to the acts of Congress involved.
Q

Is not the central issue here whether an

amendment should be allowed at this time?
MR. FAMULARO:
Q

This is true» Mr. Chief

Justice.

Has not the Court historically been rather

generous in allowing amendments, particularly in actions
between the states?
MR. FAMULARO:

Certainly the courts have been

lenient in this regard. Your Honor.

However, we submit that

they have not been lenient in this regard or indeed the
factual allegations taken upon the sufficiency of their face
do not establish as a -matter of law cause of action.

And we

submit that any alleged title defect in Virginia*s land, as
we have previously pointed out in our argument so far is
clearly immaterial.

And to tie up the Court and to bring in

18

such an immaterial claim would in no way resolve the matter
or would in no way achieve the expediency which the courts
strive for.
Q

Do you have anything to suggest about the

scope of the factual matter that would have to be dealt with
if an amendment should be allowed?
MR. FAMULARO:

Without going outbid., tha recced,

Your Honor, suffice it to say that it would ba a totally and
completely burdensome task.

It would in all likelihood

truly invalidate a counterclaim, as was suggested in the
hearing before the Special Master.

This in itself would be

an onerous task in trying to compute all of the expenditures
over all the years.
immaterial, as

And where the allegation is completely

we submit it is, we submit that this Court

should not consider this and should not be burdened with this
task.

And the Special Master correctly so held.
Q

What the Special Master did here was tantamount

to allowing a motion to amend the complaint and then dismiss
any amended complaint for failure to state a claim for
relief because it was legally barred?
MR. FAMULARO:
Rehnquist.

Yes.

This is correct, Mr. Justice

Basically what the Special Master did was that,

reasoning more to the theory of acquiescence than to our
initial theory here of the immateriality of any alleged
effect in Virginia’s title.

19

Q

h sort of demurrer':;; approach, was it not?

MR. FAMULARO;
Q

Yes, it was. Your Honor.

And then he acted on that theory?

MR. FAMULARO:

Right.

He stated the theory of

acquiescence to give validity to this argument and to set
forth the rationale.
Q

It is a little hard to conceptualise.

in a

normal lawsuit—let us say I file a complaint alleging a
promise without consideration to give me $1,000.

As a

matter of law, that does not state a cause of action on its
face, because there was no consideration, no action,
reliance and so on.

You could still file that complaint,

but it would be dismissed, X suppose, on a morion to dismiss
or on demurrer.
MR. FAMULARO:
Q

This is true. Your Honor.

Assuming all the facts to be true, it simply

does not state a cause of action under the law.
MR. FAMULARO:
Q

This is true, Mr. Justice.

And here assuming all the facts to be true

it does not strite a causa of action under the law.

The law

in this case not being the general law, such as the law of
contracts, but the law that the boundary between Kentucky and
Ohio is the low water mark of the northern side of the Ohio
River.
MR. FAMULAROs

That is basically our contention.

20
Q
cl S

el

But still I suppose the complaint, at least

technics .c*$

logical, symmetrical matter, should have been

allowed, to be filed, should

not?

Just as I can go into

a trial court anc file an action alleging a pr

with<

consideration to pay me $1,000, and it may be absolutely no
good? it may not state a cause of action keen.isa vLere
no consideration or its equivalent.

But, nonetheless, 1 can

MR. FAMULARO:

No, it is not.

He based his upon

21
the theory of acquiescence.

However, we submit that he did

not reject this theory and clearly the—
Q

Absent a holding on the ground that we just

discussed just this moment, should not the complaint been
allowed to be filed, the
MR. FAMULARO:

Since this was an original proceadin

Mr. Justice White, X think the technical rules actually are
not followed and this Court looks to them for guidance.

If

indeed this were the typical lawsuit between the average
parties, then in all likelihood exactly what you are saying
would be correct.

But in the original proceeding where the

court strives to get the issues before it and tries to
eliminate any burdensome issues, which we submit that the
boundary in the middle of the river clearly is, it should be
rejected and this forms the basis of our contention.
Q

There was a case that I have just remembered

argued about my second or third day here on the Court back
in 1958.

It is reported in 358 U.S., page 64, California

against Washington.

And that was an argument on a motion to

file a bill of complaint, and it is a very short per curiam
judgment.
is denied.

The motion for release of the bill of complaint
And then the 21st Amendment of the Constitution

is cited, Section 2 of that amendment, along with three or
four or five decided cases under the 21st Amendment, i.e., on
the merits of the case.

But. we did not allow the complaint

22

to be filed and cited casea going to the merits of the
complaint rather than allowing the complaint to be filed and
then dismissing it on the merits»
MR. FAMULARO;

I think that is a sound—

Q

That was 358 U.S., page 64.

Q

Mr. Famularo, what is this counterclaim that

you mentioned earlier?

1 gather Kentucky, you said, would

hate to file if the amended complaint—’
MR. FAMULARO;

Yes, it would be a counterclaim

basically for expenditures over* all the years, Mr. Justice
Brennan, in excess of the middle of the river to the far side?
if indeed Ohio-—
Q

You would have to make that kind of record in

the event that Ohio should prevail and its claim to the middle
of the river?
MR. FAMULARO;
Q

That is right.

But would you have to make that kind of

record until actually Ohio had prevailed if it did?
MR. FAMULARO;

1 think to protect the record of the

case and to protect our interest, once the amended complaint
is allowed to be filed, then as a protective device for the
Commonwealth of Kentucky—■
Q

You would file the counterclaim, I gather, but

would you have to fry it until the issue of the location of
the boundary line was settled?

23
MR. FAMUL&RO:

Would v?e have to try the counterclaim?

No, in all li kelihood we would not, because the expenditures
for the area lying north of the river and to ::ha northern
shore.
Q

Mr. Famularo, to take Justice Stewart*n

hypothetical of a moment ago in a common law court where you
file a complaint that does not state a claim for relief as
an amendment, hut the court simply denies you leave to fils
it.

And you appeal and on appeal the court wore to say,

"wall, he should have been given leave to file this
complaint, but we see that it does not state a claim that
we would grant relief, even conceding the facts."

Would

•tile appellate court, do you think, reverse and say even though
it would have done yon know good, you should have been allowed
to file the complaint, or would it affirm on other grounds?
MR. FAMULARO:

It seems to me that to reverse and

say that they should have been allowed to file would be
going around the circle of the matter.

It seems more critical

that the court should and could look to the facts and take
judicial notice of any undisputed facts that

are in the

record and prohibit such a proceeding from developing.
Q

Would that not deprive the trial court of its

inherent right to permit an amendment to the complaint?
Inherent power, I should say.
Obviously it is an economical and efficient

24
proceeding, but litigation is not always efficient.
MR. FAMULARO:

Certainly the right of the trial

court to grant an amendment, Mr. Chief Justice, would be
infringed upon.

However, that r ighfc is not absolute, and

there are various motions to be filed for leave of court,

.n

which the grounds are spelled out, as certainly this Court is
aware, after the responsive pleadings are filed.

If that

motion or if that attempt to file the amended complaint
shows that as a matter of law nothing would be accomplished
by it, I do not think the rights of the trial court in this
regard are so abruptly encroached upon that as a matter of
expediency such could not be held to be dismissed.
Q

The very holding of the reviewing court in

this commonlaw hypothetical case, the very theory of the
appellate's court action, might put the party on notice as to
how he might appropriately amend his complaint.
MR. FAMULARO:

This is true.

However, if I had the

language of Mr. Justice Stewart's case before me, 1 might
be better able to answer this question.

Not having it, I can

only again state that I think for expediency in a matter,
especially an original proceeding-—

Q

I suppose the one basic difference is that we,

unlike an appellate court, in a state commonlaw system have
plenary power.

We are the original court here.
FAMULARO:

That is true.

And the uniqueness

25
of the original proceeding is something to be considered in
this case.
Q

Oftenf though, that cuts when your controversy

is between two states, as the Chief Justice suggested
earlier, to give considerable latitude

to the states to

have their claims determined when they are in controversy
with a sister state.
MR. FAMULAROs

This is true, Mr, Justice Brennan,

but we submit that on a close examination of the facts before
this Court, as little as they may be at this point, the
pleadings themselves establish, as we have pointed out, that
any defect in the land lying northwest of the Ohio River is
immaterial.
Q

Would you say the same thing if you were

defending the recommendation cf the Special Master on the
basis of the acquiescence on which he relies?
MR. FAMULARO:

I am going to get into that right

now and we will say the same thing.

We think that the Special

Master was correct in applying that, based upon acquiescence
of the State of Ohio, th'afc the motion for leave to amend
should be denied,
Q

Is acquiescence consisting, number one, of

150 years; number two, of the concessions made in the original
complaint?
MR. FAMULARO:

Exactly those two things, the

26

judicial admissions made in the 1966 pleadings, the
inactivity of over ISO years by the State of Ohio while
Kentucky has continuously exerted control over the river in
all of its dealings, although they are not specifically a par;
of the record»
Moreover, Kentucky’s legislature as early as 1810
attempted to alleviate the problem as to the boundary
question before Hardly’s Lessee was even decided.

Yet Ohio * s

legislature apparently has made no such attempts.

For 150

years Ohio has been satisfied in being avrare of the judicial
deterrd:r-.tion in Handly’r lessee v. Anthony and Indiana v.
Kentucky, but yet has made no attempts to clarify that insofar
as it relates to them.
They claim that they are not a party to those
litigations and therefore they are not bound by them.

Before

getting into the Master’s acquiescence theory, I would like
to briefly respond to that allegation.
To say that they are not bound by that in the
strict sense is correct.
submit that

They were not a party.

However, we

such a contention is certainly undermined by

thsir judicial admissions.

Certainly such a contention is

undermined by the lapse of time involved.

And finally such

a contention is undermined by the holding of the Special
Master that such a contention would create a checkered
river, contrary to the intentions of Congress and the

27

intentions of the State of Virginia and would bn totally
unascertainable.

No one would know where the boundary would

And, finally-—
Q

How would the checkfooard or however you

describe it, result follow?

Would you not have one rule on

the Indiana border and another one on the Ohio one?
MS. FAMULARO:

This would be true, but on the

river it would be extremely difficult to ascertain where
the boundary of Ohio stops or where the boundary of, let us
say, Illinois or Indiana starts.

For the average fisherman

or the average tugboat operator or the average beer
distributor on the river and a restaurant attached to the
dock, it would be hard to ascertain which is Ohio, which is
Illinois, and such would be a checkered fashion.
Q

Is that not true•in Mississippi between

Illinois and Missouri and just as hard there as here?
MR. FAMULAROs

It would be.

But such does not make

the result any more correct.
Finally, we submit that the report of the Special
Master was correct in recommending that the motion for leave
to amend be denied, based upon the judicial admissions and
based upon the judicial and historical acquiescence upon the
part of the State of Ohio.

Ohio's court--

Both the acquiescence and the judicial

admissions in this case, I suppose, took place under v
authority of this Court*a decision in Handly's Lessee, not

But the rationale of that case

This Court in the past has reconsidered

This is the only Court that Ohio can

of original jurisdiction but of an original and exclusive
jurisdiction.

There is no piece else that Ohio can go for

relief.
Certainly the Master in this case it going to

But should not

Ohio have an opportunity to ask us to reconsider the rationale
of -a previous decision?

After all, it would not be making

history for us to do that and to reconsider a previous
decision and to overrule it.
MR., FAMULARO;

We submit that Ohio, based upon its

long delay and more importantly based upon the continuous
dominion by the Commonwealth of Kentucky, should not be
allowed at this point to change its total theory.
Q

All this acquiescence and all this delay and

all this judicial admission was done under the compulsion of
Ohio’s understanding of the existing law in this Court.

But

should not Ohio be given an opportunity to ask us to
reconsider and review the existing law and maybe find that it

29
was erroneous in the first place and without a solid historic
foundation?
MR. FAMDL&RO:

We subia.it that such should not be­

d-one,. based on our first argument.

That even if thov had this

attempt, that it will fail as a matter of law, as the
Special Master heldf to stats a cause of action.
Q

Not because of any decision of this Court but

because of the action of the Congress—
MR. FAMULARO:

That is right.

And in no way has

that reasoning been detracted from by any decision.

In fact,

it was reaffirmed in Handly.
Q

In Handly that was the interpretation given.

MR. FAMULAROs

That is right.

And specifically

pose it could be.

The intentions of Congress?

I sup­

But again we fall back upon our first

argument that such would be to inject in this proceeding at
this time an immaterial point.
Q

Incidentally, what is going to happen to this

controversy between Ohio and Kentucky if we accept the
Special Master’s recommendation?
MR. FAMULAROs

If the Special Master's recommendation

was accepted, Mr. Justice Brennan, it would leave the
litigation in the state of the original complaint being filed

30

and our answer being filed»
Q

You still have to resolve the question of

where the low water mark is, whether it is 1712—•
MR. FAMULARO:

Or whether it is the present low

water mark as set up in an affirmative defense in our answer.

Q

May 1 ask what is the practical significance

outside of criminal and some other jurisdiction?

Has gas

been discovered up around Portsmouth and so on?
MR. FAMULARO:

Outside of the record, Your Honor,

my understanding of it if? there has been some minerals found
in and around the Henderson area f which is across from
Evansville, Indiana.
Q

That is Indiana.

I mean east of the Great

Miami River.
MR. FAMULARO2

The problems of licensing of boats

and of licensing of fishermen, hunters, the licensing and
taxing, all of these are posing critical questions that need
to be resolved in terms of the boundary.

And the dealings of

the Commonwealth of Kentucky, we think, have been consistent
with the boundary at the present low water mark, without
getting into that at this point.

Certainly those facts are

not a part of this record,
Q

Mo, that is the original lawsuit.

MR. FAMULARO:

That is right.

The basis of our acquiescence claim is that this

Court can certainly judicially notice the undisputed judicial
admissions—can judicially notice the undisputed judicial
admissions—of the State of Ohio and can judicially notice
the undisputed historical facts, that is, the continuous
dominion and control over the Ohio River by the Commonwealth
of Kentucky and the undisputed delay and inactivity and
silence by the State of Ohio.

Based upon the judicial notice

of this—
Q

You cannot say undisputed, can you?

MR. FAMULAROs
of law.

What is undisputed we say is a matter

The judicial admissions, as a matter of law, we

submit speak for themselves, and this Court can certainly
judicially notice them.
The historical facts, at least insofar as we have
stated them, that is, the continuous dominion by the State of
Kentucky and the silence by the State of Ohio, is an
undisputed fact, and this Court can certainly judicially
notice that.
Q

Supposing we can judicially notice it, does

it amount to any more than saying, "You have a great deal of
evidence which would clearly be admissible in support of your
view," as opposed to being conclusive on Ohio?
MR. FAMULARO:

Certainly we submit that it is more

than enough evidence to establish that any attempt of Ohio to
now say that the boundary is in the middle is improper at this

32
time., be it by a motion to dismiss or whatever.

that these theories and these ■

We admit

33

substantiate our views and as a matter of law entifcl2
Commonwealth of Kentucky to a ruling at this point, that
a matter of law they fail to state a cause of action.

They

cannot be overcome.
True, Ohio may have many other facts that they can
introduce.

However, those facts can in no way , we submit,

overcome that which has already been transpire-. d in the past.
Again, we fall back on our first argument, Mr, Justice
Relinquish, that the expediency of this matter in the original
proceeding should attempt to prohibit and avoid any such
circumvention of the most direct route.

Based upon this,

we submit that the finding of the Special Master was correct
insofar as it denied the motion for leave to amend.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you,

Mr. Famularo.
Mr. Howard?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH M„ HOWARD, ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF
MR. HOWARD:

Yes, sir.

May I make just a couple

of points on the estoppel and acquiescence?

That question

was raised in United States v. California, the first tidelands
oil case.

California claimed that the United States was

estopped from claiming title to that three-mile belt off the

33
California coast,

it claimed that the United States had

acquiesced in California's claims of title for years.
Nevertheless, the Court's opinion, written by Mr. Justice
Black, refused to accept that argument and discussed it afc
some length.
X think that seems to me to be controlling in this
part i cii 1 ar case.
The other point is, recently there has been a
number of bridges constructed between Ohio and Kentucky.
They were the subject of contracts between the two states.
The contracts provided that Kentucky would pay for the
bridge up to the low water mark on the north side of the
river, and Ohio would pay for the rest of it.
Ohio side.

That is on the

But the contracts also provided that nothing

said therein should be determinative of where the boundary
line lay.

That shows that Ohio was still maintaining its

position that the boundary line was not at the low water
mark.
Q

X guess those contracts were written after

the amended complaint in this case was offered, were they not?
MR. HOWARD?

X think some of them were written

prior to that, time, Your Honor.

X am not sure of that.

I

know some of them have been written after that.
Q

As I understood what you. told us about the

history of the litigation, this original complaint was filed

34
when?
MR. HOWARDt
Q

Sixty-six?

MR. HOWARDS
Q

1966,

Yes,,

Then by reason of a change of administration

or other reasons, people in your office looked at it. and
nd
it, and it was then and only then, back four or five years
after the original complaint was filed, that this theory was
discovered or evolved or whatever, that was the basis of the
amended complaint and that that was the first time.
MR. HOWARD;

May X say that the prior administration

was familiar with this argument.
Q

With the argument?

MR. HOWARD:
with this.

That is right.

They were familiar

They had the Vinton argument made to the General

Court of Kentucky back in 1848, which has been mentioned
right at the ©nd of our brief and is the best statement of
Ohio’s position.

They had that at that time.

have any faith in it.

They did not

They did not think that because of the

length of time that had passed that they would be able to
prevail on this Court to permit them to go ahead with that
argument.
We examined it and we take a different view of it.
That is all.

Two different sets of lawyers looking at it and

But I think—X am not quite sure about those
contracts, but I aa pratty sure there were scree of them that

were written before 1966.
Q

What kinds of proof would you have in mind

offering in support of a middle-of-the-river line?
MR. HOWARD2

We have lined up all the documentary

evidence which shows to me conclusively that Virginia had no
title on the north end, the west side of the river.
Consequentlyf the doctrine that Chief Justice
Marshall laid down in the Handly case did not apply at all.
He said that if one state ovms both sides of the river and
gives up one side, it retains the entire river.

But if two

states own the opposite sides of the river, then their
boundary runs to the middle.
Those documentary proofs of what happened prior to
the time of the Revolution show that Virginia, regardless of
what their original claim was under the charter, no longer
had any title on the north and west side of the river.

It was reserved for the use

And at the time of the Revolution upon the

Declaration of Independence, that claim passed directly to
the United States, not to any of the individual states at
all, because they had no claim to it at that time.

Q

What about the acts of the Congress in

36

recognizing the cession and accepting it?
MS. HOWARD?
