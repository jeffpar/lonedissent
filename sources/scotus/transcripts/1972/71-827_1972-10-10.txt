Your Honor.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

Very well.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF HUGHES TOOL COMPANY, ET AL.
MR. WRIGHT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court?
In the thirty minutes that we have, it is obvious
that neither 1 nor Mr. Tenney are going to be able to discuss
comprehensively all of the 11 issues on which the Court
granted certiorari on the petition and the cross-petition,
so we are going to have to let our briefs speak for us on many
of those issues.
Indeed, I consider my time to be somewhat less than
thirty minutes, because 1 am quite determined to close my
initial submission while there is still some time remaining for
rebuttal.
So, in this time that I have, I want to go immediately

4
to what seems to me to be the central overriding issue in this
case?

That I represent a corporation that has been ordered to

pay the largest money judgment aver entered under the antitrust
laws in a case that has nothing whatever to do with the
antitrust laws.
Whatever else ray client may have don®, my client did
not violate the antitrust lav/s, and even with all the benefits
that my friends from TWA have by virtue of the default
judgment, it is impossible to make out a violation of the anti­
trust laws,
r

••

There are three separate reasons, separate anet
independent, why this is not really an antitrust case.
In the first place, the conduct, the facts alleged
in the complaint, the facts proven by TWA in the damage hearing,
show conduct on the part of the defendants that as © matter of
law cannot be held to violate 'the Sherman or Clayton Acts.
Second, if there had been any antitrust violations
in this case, we would have a complete defense of immunity
under Section 414 of the Federal Aviation Act, because every­
thing that my client is shown to have done in this case was
done in the exercise, the normal exercise, of control of TWA
approved by the Civil Aeronautics Board.
And, third, even if there had been antitrust
violations, and they were not immunised, the damages that have
been awarded to TWA bear no relation to the supposed anti-

5

trust violations.

The damages are that certain aircraft,

jet aircraft, were ordered by Toolco, the parent company,
for its carrier subsidiary, TWA, a few weeks later than they
should have been? that Toolco subsequently decided -that TWA
should have only 47 first-generation jets and cut back the
initial order that had been for 63 first-generation jets,
but Toolco leased some of these aircraft to TWA for a period
pending permanent financing, and that leasing is a more
expensive way of acquiring aircraft than is purchasing them
outright»
And, finally, there is a small item that alleges
that Toolco disrupted Ganvair’s production, and so some other
planes came a little later than they should have.
Wow, what happened in this case, in my submission,
is this:

That at the end of the 1950cs, when the air carriers

were converting to jet aircraft, it was obvious that neither
TWA nor the parent company, Toolco, would be able, with its
own resources, to pay the many millions of dollars required
to acquire jets.

It was going to be necessary to finance

the acquisition of these aircraft by going to lending
institutions.
The Eastern lending institutions, the hanks, and the
•

insurance companies would not make that financing available
until Toolco, the owner of 78 percent of TWA, agreed to put
its stock into a voting trust.

The institutions controlled

6
the voting trust.
TWA.

They put in a. new board of directors for

They put in new management for TWA.

And the first

thing that the new management does is to bring the present
action against the owners and those who formerly controlled
the operation of TWA.
They chose to cast, the case in antitrust terms.
This gives them federal jurisdiction that they would not
otherwise have had, it gives them, if they are successful,
treble damages5 but I think that it's on the record, that
the principal motive for bringing the case on an antitrust
theory was that they were primarily interested in forcing
Tcolco to divest itself of its interest in TWA, and they
believe that divestiture v?as a remedy that they might get

.

in an antitrust case, though they could not get it in a
corporato management — mismanagement action.
QUESTION;

How does their motive bear on the issues

here?
MR. WRIGHT;

It bears in this way:

they wanted ultimately, Tcolco is out.

they got what

And it seems to me

not unjust, Justice Rahnquist, for us now to hold them
strictly to their antitrust claim, not to feel sorry that.
well, perhaps TWA simply picked a wrong theory. And it*s
?
7
like the plaintiff in Diaguardi v. Burning, with his homedrawn complaint, and we ought to strain hard to save him,
I think that they follow the course with their eyes

7
wide open, and that now they have to live or die with whether
or not the theory they chose was a legally viable one.
We think that, demonstrably, it is not.
I was interested in the document TWA filed last
weak labeled, "Memorandum in Response to Petitioners' Reply
Brief™ for two reasons!
First, in our Reply Brief our principal thrust had
been that after all of the hundreds of pages that TWA has
written in briefs, that the court below wrote, we still have
not been told (a) in what respect did Toolco and the other
defendants violate the antitrust laws, (b) what is the
immunity that you get when the CAB approves acquisition under
Section 408?
QUESTIONj

Of course, l*m sur®, Mr. Wright, before

we're through, that someone is going to suggest that perhaps
that should have boon searched out at an earlier date.
Before a default occurred.
MR. WRIGHT:

Mr. Chief Justice, I think that is just

what we had hoped would be threshed out at a much earlier
stage by following the course that we did, choosing not to
defend on the facts, and saying we are willing to stand or fall
on the legal position that we have in this case.
Now, the thing, the events since February 8, 1963
hav© been convoluted.

Obviously it’s not produced the

expeditious determination of the case that we thought that it

8
would.

But it seems to me that it would have been irresponsible

for my clients to have persisted in litigating the facts in a
ease of this sort# that would take so much time of the federal
court, when, in our view, the facts make-no difference
whatever*
Yes, Mr. Tenney, we8re willing to concede all that
you want to say about our motive and intent, because we
simply do not think that the bad motives that we may have had
hidden are enough to make an antitrust violation out of
conduct that does not violate the antitrust laws.
And we thought that w® could gat that legal issue
before the Court.

We expected to prevail on it very quickly.

We have rot prevailed quickly, we hope to prevail now, nine
years later.
But it interested me that in the memorandum in
response to reply brief, that TWh still does not undertake
to answer either of these questions. We still don’t know*
They say again, as they said in their principal submission,
that we have not disproved the fact that ve could not have
violated the antitrust laws in some way.

Well, we say,

how could we violate the antitrust laws, that we give you the
benefit of admitting all your factual allegations, and, I
conclude, ultimate fact as well as evidentiary fact, and
constrain them as liberally as possible in the light of the
damage hearing; but still it ought to be possible then to

leek at tha record and spell out some coherent theory on
which my clients could be held to have violated the antitrust
laws.
X think that cannot be done.
The second thing that interested me in that
memorandum is that they pick up the example that we posed in
both our earlier submissions about an acquisition of TWA by
Lockheed.

This time my friends call it a reductio ad

absurdm, and on the difference between the two sides on that
example# I am quite willing to stand or fall.

Because I think

that that is *a clear and decisive illustration of the
difference between our legal positions on the effective
CAB immunity and with a change in the facts it also becomes
a very interesting illustration of the difference between us
on the supposed antitrust violation.
The example# Your Honors will recall, is imagine
that in 1946# when TWA 'was on the verge of bankruptcy, that
nobody wanted to acquire the company, the carrier was about
to fail, except Lockheed.

And suppose that Lockheed said,

Okay, we’ll buy control, CAB, if you'll approve it.
The CAB knows that to allow a major manufacturer of
airplanes to acquire a carrier means that Lockheed will be
•the exclusive supplier for TWA? it recognizes that a vertical
integration of this kind is going to reduce competition.

But

the CAB says we’re required to look not just at antitrust, wa'r

10
required to look at the public interest, and we think that
the continued operation and solvency of TWA is so much in the
public interest that it justifies this incidental restraint
on competition.

And ■ so we at the CAB will approve the

acquisition and control, and just to make sure that Lockheed
doesn’t overstep, we’ll put a condition on it that Lockheed
can’t sell any planes to TWA without our CAB approval.

In

that way we’ll be sura that they don't fore© unnecessary
planes on TWA.
In the view of my friends, Lockheed, under those
circumstances, would be liable to an antitrust action because
it did exactly what the CAB knew that it was going to do,
said that it could do, because the CAB found that other things
outweighed the effect on competition.
We think, in that illustration, that the CAB
approval would be a complete grant of immunity.

TWA says

that to argue that it would immunise the antitrust violations
there is a reductio ad absurdum.
I think that the lines there are quite clearly
drawn.
.

But I would also vary the facts of my Lockheed
illustration.

Let’s suppose that Lockheed is a super

responsible corporate parent, and so it says to TWA, having
acquired control idlth CAB approval, —
QUESTIONS

Let us suppose it’s what kind of a

11
corporata?
MR. WEIGHTS

Super responsible.

QUESTION; Super responsible.
MR. WRIGHTs

Yes.

It says;

Much as we would love

to sell you Lockheed planes, TWA, if you tell us you want
Boeings and Convairs, fine? we want you to have exactly the
planes you want to have.
And TWA says:

Well, we really would like to have

some Boeings and Convairs. So Lockheed, using its money,
>

because TWA doesn’t have any, goes down the street to Boeing
and Convair and says, Sell us some planes.'
And these planes, Lockheed in turn then, either
leases or when it gets financing, it sells to TWA.

Now,

this would be much more of an antitrust violation on my
friends’ theories than anything than we have in our case,
where Tooleo is in fact not a manufacturer of planes, as
Lockheed of course is.
And yet my friends would still be able to say, Well,
but Lockheed forced TWA to boycott Boeing and Convalr, even
through TWA kept getting Boeing and Convair planes, because

^

Lockheed insisted you can only buy planes from us, and we’re
going to foe the conduit.
That’s what all the talk in this case, about boycotts
tying arrangements, exclusive dealings, are; that Tooleo was
the conduit.

It acquire planes from Boeing and Convair and

12
made them available to its subsidiary, TWA.
This* we think* with or without CAB approval, simply
is not a violation of the antitrust laws.

That for a parent

to acquire goods for its subsidiary, even for a parent to
decide what goods its subsidiary is going to have, how many
it's going to have.

We have here no restraint on competition

of the sort to which the antitrust laws are directed.
QUESTION; And if the parent goes to the trouble of
making the subsidiary promise not to get planes from any source
except through the parent, you say that's just beside the
point, that's just expressing what would happen anyway,
because it is in control.
MR. WRIGHT;

Is that the way you look at it?

That's exactly my submission, Justice

White.
QUESTION:

So that a parent, in these circumstances,

especially if approved by the CAB, can make the sub-promise
not to buy planes any place else, without any — no problem
under the anti-trust laws?
MR. WRIGHT: Well, since the subsidiary can't buy
planes in any instance without the consent of its parent,
it hardly matters whether you coerce this terrible-sounding
promise out of the subsidary.
QUESTION:

Well, maybe ultimately that's right, but

if you have a board of directors that runs the company, and
just what if it happens to vote to buy some planes somewhere

13
alse.

1 suppose it could unless it was under some contractual

promise to the parent.
MR. WRIGHT:
QUESTION:

I suppose it could, but I must say -—
You’re just assuming that obviously,

and maybe that’s quite right, that the parent will have control
of the board?
MR. WRIGHT:

If I control 78 percent of the

corporation, I’d be surprised if the board of directors
voted contrary to my wishes.
QUESTION: Well, yes, but the board of directors
might say, well, wa have obligations as directors, too.
MR. WRIGHT:
QUESTION:
MR. WRIGHT:

Yes.
To this corporate entity.
Yes.

And if we coerce our elected directors who control
the board to do something that is wrong, something that is not
in the interest of the corporation, then I say that of course
a corporate mismanagement action will lodge, obviously.
QUESTION:
MR. WRIGHT:

But not an antitrust action?
Not an antitrust action, yes.

That’s

fch& whole point of our case here.
I, of course, do not concede for a moment, as a
matter of fact, as differentiated from what my legal position
has to be here, I don’t concede that there was any mismanage­
ment on the part of Toolco.

But, legally, I'm in the posture

14
that I have to admit it.
QUESTION:

But there was the promise not to buy

planes anywhere?
MR. WRIGHT:

By default, that stands admitted, yes.

QUESTION: Given 100 percent ownership on the part
of a parent of a subsidiary, Mr. Wright, did you say, nonethe­
less, that the subsidiary could not be a plaintiff and bring
or state

a

claim for relief against the parent in the anti­

trust law?
MR. WRIGHT:

The subsidiary certainly could bring an

antitrust action or, if it x^ere not 100 percent owned, a
minority stockholder could bring a derivative action in its
behalf challenging acquisition of control by the parent.
But, so far as the cases that either side has been able to
produce, to go, that is the extent of it.
But my friends have not been able to cite a case
in xtfhich the challenge is solely to antitrust violations that
the parent is alleged to have committed to the harm of the
>

subsidiary, after a lawful acquisition.
I say, Mr. Justice Rehngui3t, I've been reflecting
on that question in the last few days, trying to see if 1
could hypothesize a case in which there might be such a case.
I

hesitate to say that it could not ever happen, but I’ve

been unable to think of an example in which the minority
would — the subsidiary would have an antitrust claim against

IS
the parent for activity after acquisition.
I can well imagine, of course, and I want to be
sure that this distinction is understood, I can well imagine
cases in which third parties might have claims that because
of the way the parent exercised its control of the subsidiary,
it —
QUESTION:
MS. WRIGHT:

There have been several cases.
Sure, and we have lots of cases of

that kind.
But that isn’t our case here.

We don't have Boeing

or Convair here saying, "We've been harmed by what — those
violations of the antitrust law that you've committed."

They

have, so far as the record shows, been perfectly content.
We have only the parent here — I'm sorry, only
the subsidiary here.
I revert, Mr. Chief Justice, to the question that
you put to me a while ago, because I do think that one of
the reasons this case has gone on so long and did not corae
to an end expeditiously as we had anticipated is because of
a misunderstanding of what the position was that Toolco took
on February 8, 1963, when it announced that it would not
defend further on the merits«

That has been made to have

overtones of contumacy, of scorning the process of the court;
and those overtones, in ray judgment, are quite unjustified.
I think that it is not only proper, it is responsible

16

for a party to avoid factual issues if you can and say, let's
simply stake it all on our legal test.
We know what we have done.

We know the facts.

We don't see any way that those

facts could possibly be made into a valid antitrust claim.
We don't see any way they could possibly prove damages.

Why

should we go ahead and spend years, while people use all .the
wonderful engines of discovery that the federal rules provide,
so that x«2 come up with thousands of pages of facts, when
ultimately the court is going to have to decide a straight
legal issue.
That was the position we took then, we think that
would have led to an expeditious termination of the controversy,
except for one very unfortunate thing, and that is the failure
of the District Court and then of the Court of Appeals to
give a proper reading to what effect a default has.
Those courts took the view that by inviting default,
as we certainly did, we had admitted the illegality of what
we had done and we admitted that our illegal acts caused
harm.
t

QUESTION:

Well, they treated it as though it was

a negligence case, in which the defendant stipulated
negligence and just vent to trial on damages, isn't that
about right?

A close analogy.

MR. WRIGHTs

I think that that is what they did,

and I think that that was giving it too much effect.

We

17
waived any right to dispute the facts.

But we think that the

cases, that are written over and over in your books, even
after a default a party still retains the right to challenge
whether what he has done is a legal wrong, much as the analogy
I put in the brief that a defendant in a criminal case who
pleads guilty may still appeal on the ground that the
indictment did not state a crime, that the law was
unconstitutional.
We think that the legal questions were still open,
and the example of the Section 7 claim in the complaint is
the bast illustration of that.

The complaint says that we

acquired the shares of their stock, that we did this to their
great damage, and it specifically states a violation of
Section ? of the Clayton Act.
But everybody has agreed that there was no Section 7
violation because, as a matter of law, we can't be held to
have violated Section 7 whan the CAB has said we could acquire
the stock.

This, at least, is the irreducible minimum that

CAB approval allows us.
QUESTION:

What wa3 it that you said that your

client said that renders the analogy of conceding negligence
and thus trying damages renders that inapposite hare?
MR. WRIGHT:

I'm sorry, I don't get the thrust of

the question.
QUESTION:

Perhaps I should do it more directly:

18

Why isn't this, then, what you rely on, to say that this is not
like a case of conceding negligence and just going to trial,
going to the trier,on damages?
MS, WRIGHT;

It would be like that only if we were

in a jurisdiction in which negligence is no lonqer a sufficient
basis for recovery.

So that we might admit the fact of

negligence by a default, but say, well, here, for this kind of
action you have to prove wilful and wanton injury, something
of that sort.
QUESTION; Well, of course, in the Chief Justice's
example it's stated that negligence was conceded.
MR. WRIGHT;
QUESTION;

Yes.
Your point is here you've never

conceded the violation of the antitrust laws.
MR. WRIGHT:
QUESTION:

That's right.
You've never conceded liability at any

point.
MR. WRIGHT;
QUESTION:

We've never conceded liability.
You conceded all the facts, but say they

don’t add up to antitrust liability.
MR. WRIGHT;
Justice Brennan.

That is precisely what we're saying,

That, as a matter of law, the facts that

their complaint alleges and that the damage hearing
established do not add up to an antitrust violation.
With the Court's permission, I would like to reserve

19
my remaining time for rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Very well, Mr. Wright.

Mr. Tenney.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DUDLEY B. TENNEY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF TRAMS WORLD AIRLINES, INC.
MR. TENNEY;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
I am her© on behalf of Trans World Airlines, TWA,
and 35,000 public stockholders.

According to defendants, they

have no claim to economic independence and no right to relief
under the antitrust laws.
This case is almost twelve years old now.
judgment below is the result of unaniinxtybelow.

The

The Special

Master, who was Herbert Brownell, the District Judge, Charles
Metamer, and two panels of the Court of Appeals have been in
full agreement.
Like my opponent, I am going to leave the facts
and the history of the proceedings to the statement in our
brief, which is very detailed, and which is documented to the
record, and which is, as to both the facts and the history
of the proceedings, pretty much the same as the courts below
saw.
I would also leave to our case the four questions
that are presented by cur cross-petition in No. 830.

The

questions in the cross-petition are pretty straightforward

20

questions of policy and statutory interpretation, and of
course we hope that the Court will agree with us on them? but
X don't think they need any special explanation.
Xn 827, the first two questions that this Court
granted certiorari on had as their subject the conduct of the
pretrial discovery during the first two years of this twelveyear-old litigation, and the entry of the default judgment
when the defendants, expressly refusing to obey court orders,
refused to proceed with either pretrial or trial.
In the petition and in the initial brief, the
defendants claim that this conduct of the pretrial proceedings
in these ways they were denied due process of lav;, a Fifth
Amendment point.
We haven't heard anything about that in the
brief or in the oral argument today.

The reply brief

reply
says

that this is all procedural underbrush.
But there is one point I would like to make about
it.

The defendants have had their day in court, their full

day in court on these points.
On March 8 of 1965 this Court entered an order
dismissing certiorari in No. 501 of that term.

That worked

to dispose finally the appeal the Hughes Tool Company had
taken from the dismissal with prejudice of its counterclaims,
counterclaims against TWA, as well as a number of other
additional defendants

21
That was a default judgment entered in favor of TWA* as
well as these counterclaim defendants, when the Tool Company
formally and expressly refused in open court to proceed with
pretrial or trial of the factual issues of the entire Titigation .
The same refusals that are before you on those
questions today.
In 501 this appeal presented the questions of
whether the pretrial proceedings had been properly handled
by the District Court* whether the discovery, as complained
of, were proper? vrhether the entry of the default judgment
was justified when the defendants refused to obey those
orders and announced that they would not proceed further.
Those are the first two questions before the Court
today,
The excuse for raising them again is that the scope
of the interlocutory appeal, 423 of that term, was restricted
to jurisdictional questions.

But a restriction on the

permissive interlocutory appeal is really beside the point.
Even if there had been no interlocutory appeal at all, if
the permission had been refused to take that appeal, 501
would have reached the discovery orders, the defendant's
refusal to proceed, and the entry under Rule 3? of the
default judgment, because of those events.
And as far as those questions are concerned, this

22
Court's order In No. 501 operate as a final order.
We think that, as a matter of judicial finality,
the principles that this Court has laid down is no reason to
look at those questions at any subsequent staqe of the
litigation.
And the Court of Appeals, of course, disagreed with
us on this.

They met again, they reviewed the record again,

they came out with a second unanimous decision that there was
no error in the pretrial proceedings, that the discovery
orders were proper, and that — and I’ll quote the 1971
opinion on this;

were less at stake in this litigation, the

propriety of the default judgment would not have

deserved

the full discussion we have afforded it.
The entry of the default judgment was inescapable
and virtually invited by Toolco.
I don’t believe any of the defendant's procedural
arguments in the brief need any further comment besides, of
course, what we have in our brief.
Now, as I see it, the defendants are presenting
two questions of substantive law, I suppose — I only see
two ~~ their antitrust defense and their CAB defense.
Those are the same questions that they reaised on the prior
interlocutory appeal.

They are still presented only on the

pleadings, or at least that’s the way they should be
presented.

There has still been no trial on the merits, and

23
it is still true now as it was in 1965 that the reason there
hasn’t been any trial is because defendants decided, a
responsible business decision, to prevent one in 1963.
But, as X hear them today, they are still denying
matters alleged in the complaint.

They are still arguing

their factual view of these matters that were at issue.
The conduit theory of the ordering of jets, that this was
solely for TWA.

They are denying that they tried to establish

themselves as the dominant factor in the supply of aircraft
to air lilies, that they seised the TWA market, imposed boycotts,
and prevented TWA from acquiring sufficient aircraft and
arranging financing so that they could do this, so that the
diversions of aircraft from TWA to its competitors had, as a
very specific purpose, the establishment of defendants as a
factor, a competitive factor, in the business of supplying
aircraft to airlines.
QUESTION:
MR. TENNEY:
QUESTION;

Mr. Tenney, —
Yes, sir.
— if this Court should hold that a

subsidiary does not have any post-acquisition antitrust
claim available to it under the lav/ against a parent, would
you think that was something that these petitioners couldn’t
raise, because of the default?
MR. TBNNSYs

No, YOur Honor, X believe that the

default does not preclude them from raising complete legal

24
defenses that are presented by the pleadings.
be barred from raising that point.

They would not

1 can't, I frankly can't

conceive of this Court coming to that conclusion, in light
of the history of its decisions.
QUESTION s Do you know of any cases from this Court
that have authorized that sort of a suit, where the
subsidiary is a plaintiff and the parent is a defendant?
MR. TENNEY;

Well, Your Honor, every derivative

suit that involves the antitrust laws, in which the subsidiary
sues its parent, clearly involves this matter.

There have

been several of them that the Court has denied certiorari
on.
QUESTION;

But there they're assuming the claim of

the parent, aren't they?

They aren't making a claim against

the parent? but merely assuming a claim of the parent?
MR. TENNEY:

No, they are derivative suits by

stockholders of a minority owned subsidiary.

Against the

parent.
QUESTION;

But if your opponent correct in saying

MR. TENNEY:

No, Your Honor, he's not.

I believe so, sir.

MR. TENNEY:

Of course not, Your Honor.

traced every element of damages that is the basis of our
damage award, to the conduct that is al.legecl in the complaint
as having been done by the defendants pursuant to their
illegal conspiracy in restraint of trade.
For example, six Boeing jets, six of the first jets
that went into service in this country., were diverted by the
defendants from TWA to TWA* s principal trans-Atlantic
competitor, PanAmerlcan.

when the purpose is to establish a — to establish the
defendants, through use of the TWA market, as a dominant
factor in the supply of aircraft to airlines.
It’s mismanagement also. . It's mismanagement involved,
and certainly TWA got badly hurt by its manager? but it got
badly hurt for purposes that its manager had on the outside.
And those purposes were anti-competitive.
There's a lot of -- there's a great deal of mis­
management involved in many antitrust cases.

But that doesn't

make them any less antitrust cases.

Answering the question of my brother

QUESTION:

Hehnquist you said you don't have a case that says that the

There are

QUESTION; Well, is that the point in this case?
MR. TENNEY:
this as the point.

Well, the defendants have presented

They’ve developed a new doctrine — it’s

new to me — undor the antitrust laws.

They've constructed a

doctrine applicable to what they call a parent-subsidiary
relationship that puts everything in that relationship outside
of the scope of the antitrust laws.

They say that as long

as the parent controls the subsidiary —
QUESTION;
is on you.

The burden is not on them, the burden

You allege the antitrust violation.
QUESTION; Right.
MR.TENNEY; The burden is on me at a trial to

establish the violations, Your Honor. There was no trial.
QUESTION; And it stands where the plaintiff is the
subsidiary against the parant.
MR. TENNEY;

That's also your burden.

As a legal proposition, it's my burden

to establish the legal proposition.

I think fchat’3 so, sir.

However, I believe that that is implicit in the
— all of the antitrust decisions of this Court.

I don't

31
believe that there is such a thing as an immunity for* a
parent's conduct with respect to a subsidiary,, and I suggest
that there shouldn't be»
First of all, I'd like to point out, Your Honor,
TWA is not just an incorporated division of Tool Company,
it is and it has always been an independent entity, organised
to provide public service as an air common carrier.

It had

13,000 public stockholders whan the suit was brought, and now
it's 35,000.
What was done to TWA in this case was to deprive
them of the jet3 that it needed to carry on its competitive
business in the air transport industry, an industry that Toole©
is not engaged in.

It vary nearly destroyed TW&.

If ever, for the economic purposes that the
antitrust laws are concerned with, separate corporations should
be considered as entities having independent economic
significance, then Toolco and TWA should be recognized as
having independent economic significance for antitrust
purposes«
QUESTIONt
MR. TENNEY;
QUESTION;

Mr. Tenney, —
Yes, sir.
— isn't it at least arguable that the

parent-subsidiary immunity, as you refer to it, isn't simply
♦

an arbitrary carving out on th® part of the petitioner, but
related in some way to the type of harm which Congress sought

32
to protect potential competitors from how far did it intend
to extend the protection of the antitrust laws insofar as a
person seeking treble damages is concerned?
MR. TENNEYs

I should not think so, Your Honor.

I have trouble believing that the public stockholders of a
subsidiary that is not a wholly owned subsidiary, and the
corporate entity in which they have invested, have been
intended by Congress to be deprived of the rights that they
would otherwise normally have.
I find nothing in the statute that suggests that.
After all, a corporation has a separate legal
personality, it has a separate economic personality in this
case.

The person's — the right of that legal person or that

economic person is the right that has been infringed, and
it is the right that is protected here.
Now, —■
QUESTION:
MR. TENNEY:
QUESTION:

Mr. Tenney, —
Yes, sir.
— would it make any difference to your

submission if Toolco had owned 100 percent of TWA?
MR. TENNEY:

Frankly I don't think that under the

Court's decisions that would give them immunity.

I think that

it makes a great deal of difference to the independence of
the — I think we have a much stronger case because it was
initially a 46 percent ownership, then went up to 70 percent

in the Fifties, and finally 78 percent.

1 think we have a

much stronger case to establish the independent economic
significance of -this enterprise.
Similarly, 1 think we would have a weaker case if
Toolco had had a division that was an airline and just
incorporated it, for example.
QUESTION:

But that's not our case.

I was going to ask you about that.

Suppose the CAB had allowed Toolco, after acquiring TWA, to
fold it into the parent and operate it as a division, and
these same acts had been conducted, would there have been
any violation of antitrust laws that could have been taken
advantage of by anybody except the United STafces Government
or some competitor of Toolco?
MR. TENNEY:

Well, if you have no person — a

competitor of Toolco, of course, could have taken advantage
of them.

If you would destroy TWA's legal personality by

merging it in, I don't quite see how a division could sue.
But as long as we have a separate legal personality,
as long as there is that legal personality that can sue, as
long as there is a body of directors, a controlling entity
capable of taking advantage of that independence, I see no
difficulty in their asserting their legal rights.
Now, I think that it*s interesting to notice that
today, more and more, some conglomerates and some other
corporate affiliates are starting to positively discourage

34

practices of preferential feeling, and require their units
to operate in the open market.
Now, to the extent that this is happening today,
and I think it is happening, I think that this is one of the
healthiest trends in American industry.

And it can only

have something to do with the influence of the general belief
today

and I believe it is a general belief —* that you

don't have any immunity from the antitrust laws just because
there is a corporate affiliation.

You are still subject to

the antitrust laws, and you have to behave.appropriately.
And 1 believe that if this doctrine of parentsubsidiary immunity were established, one of the most
important areas in which the antitrust laws have influence
today would be removed from that influence.
This isn't a simply foreclosure we're talking about.
I have to recall ‘that Toolco has, from 1961 to date, without
any interruption because of 'their default, or their statement
that they admit the facts of the complaint, they have
continued to deny that the foreclosure of the TWA market,
the seizure of the TWA market, was intended to, was a step
towards aotablishing themselves as suppliers of aircraft
to other airlines.
That is a fact alleged in the complaint.
How, go all the way back to the movie cases, and
X guess a lot before the movie cases, this Court has a whole

35
series of vertical integration decisions.

It says that

just because you have control over a subsidiary doesn't
mean that you can use your power over the market of that
subsidiary as a weapon in a broader market.
And I don’t see how you can remove the parent-

subsidiary situation from the scope of the antitrust laws
without taking a really tremendous step back from the whole —
maybe two generations of decisions,

tod I cannot believe

that it would be the desirable thing, let alone intended by

Congress.
Now, —•

If this Court accepted the argument

of petitioners that they can refuse discovery of issues of
this kind, refuse to proceed to a trial, and still be
entitled to — at a damage hearing — contest restraints of
trade, contest anti-competitive conduct, contest all those
things, if Your Honors accepted that, I think that you could
remand this case.

ultimata damage to the entire system of procedure that
civil practice has been based on now for thirty years and
perhaps even more*

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF HUGHES TOOL COMPANY, ET AL.
MR. WRIGHT:

May it please the Court:

It seems to me that, in an important respect, Mr.
Tenney has, by what he has said today, confessed error.

If

I have heard him correctly, he responded more than once,
in response to questions from the bench, that we are still
free at this stage, after default, to challenge whether or
not the acts pleaded in the complaint amounted, as a matter
of law, to a violation of the antitrust laws.

42
And that, it seems to ms, equally to correlate, is
exactly the opposite of the view that the Second Circuit
adopted at — I refer particularly to the discussion at pages
70nand 71 in 449 Fed 2d, appearing also in the record at
Appendix 2772, 2773, 2776, such statements as the following:
The default had the effect of admitting or
establishing that the acts pleaded in the complaint violated
the antitrust laws and that those acts caused injury to TWA
in the respects there alleged.
Again, there was no burden on TWA to show that any
of Toolco's acts pleaded in the complaint violated the
antitrust laws.
And again, the illegality of Toolco's arrogation

V
of all authority for allowing aircraft was, as we have said,
conclusively established by the default judgment.
So that it seems to me the case was decided by
both courts below on a theory that Mr. Tenney, I think quite ’
properly, has now conceded, to be unsound and contrary to the
decisions of this Court.
QUESTION:

Mr. Wright, assuming we agree with that,

should v;e do anything further than just to hold that and
remand the case to the Court of Appeals?
MR. WRIGHT:

It seems to me, Justice Stewart,

that's a question of judicial administration, and it would
really be presumptious of me to advise this Court.

43
QUESTIONi Well, since you do advise us through
your brief, by arguing all these substantive issues.
MR. WRIGHT:

Yes, and I would hope I gave you such

good advice that you might decide you could bring the case
to an end right now by simply saying "reverse and dismiss".
But ~~
QUESTION:

Well, couldn't you —

MR. WRIGHT:

I would agree. Justice Stewart, quite

seriously, that ordinarily it is a tremendous advantage to
this Court to have the considered opinion of the Court of
Appeals on a difficult question, and that there would be
valuable guidance, in this cas®, to have the Court of Appeals
enlightened as to the proper standard* than to review the
thousands of pages in the record, the hundreds of pages
in the complaint, and then say that these are violations or
not,

suggested, what's left to b© invaded below?
MR. WRIGHT:

Well, then the question would be the

substantive question: What i£ the effect of immunity?

Are

The second Circuit then would be deciding -those
issues on the merits rather than saying that Toolco is not

they would presumably not reconsider that if we didn't
decide it.

Thates the law of the case , from their point of

view, isn’t it?
MR, WRIGHT5 Right,

From their point of view it

is, and that's why it didn’t come in on the second appeal.

a very different factual setting than it was in 1564,

But, nonetheless, it’s been decided

in this case#

Well, it’s right now, at least.

MR. WRIGHT:

It is right, yes, Your Honor.

We would pray that the judgment balow be reversed.
Thank you, Your Honors, for your attention.
MR. TENNEYi

If it please the Court, in 1964 the

Court also decided this point, that the conduct charged in
the complaint violated the antitrust laws? that is why it
was not considered in the 1971 opinion.

There are two

Court of Appeals opinions here, and you have to look at them
both.

That was why we of course didn’t have to prove it,

they had already decided it.

on that, Mr. Wright?

No, thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
