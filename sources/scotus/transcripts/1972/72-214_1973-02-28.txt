ORAL ARGUMENT OF EARL E. POLLOCK ON BEHALF
OF APPELLANTS THE ATCHISON, TOPEKA AND
SANTA FE RAILWAY COMPANY ET AL.
MR. POLLOCK;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Within the past year this is the third case to
have coma before the Court, arising out of efforts to relieve
the critical shortage of freight, cars on the nation' s
railroads.
The other two cases, Allegheny-Ludlum and Florida
East Coast involved rules and rates intended to discourage
delay in returning cars.
This case involves railroad charges intended to
discourage the in-transit, inspection of grain and in that
way reduce the wasteful use of cars.
The new tariffs were published by the railroad
almost, exactly three years ago to become effective on
March 28, 1970.

But before the effective date the Interstate

Commerce Commission, acting under Section 15(7) of the Act

5
suspended charges for the maximum 7-month period provided by
the statute.

The suspension was voluntarily extended by the

affected railroads for an additional 6 months.
were finally put. into affect in May 1971.

The charges

After extensiva

hearings, the Commission found that the charges were just and
reasonable and also found that, the charges would make a
substantial contribution to the improvement of the national,
freight car supply.
The District Court, the court below, set aside the
Commission’s order.

In addition, without any request by the

plaintiffs to grant, such relief, without any discussion of its
authority to grant such relief, without, any finding of
irreparable injury, and indeed without, any injunction findings
whatsoever, the District Court, suspended the charges which had
then been in effect for over a year.
Thereafter, this Coux-t entered an order which stayed
the judgment below and which permitted the rates to go back
into effect.
Mr. co-counsel, Mrs. Christian, Associate General
Counsel of the Commission, will present the position of the
appellants and the United States on the District Court’s
suspension o£ the charges, while my argument will deal with
the District Court's decision on the merits of the Commission's
order.
Those tariffs impose charges for interrupting grain

6
shipments for the purpose of in-transit inspection.

This

service involves stopping a car loaded with grain while it. is
already en route, switching the car to a separate track at a
few locations in the country where the car is held forsampling and grading of the contents, waiting for disposition
orders from shipper or his consignee after he receives the
results of the inspection, and then eventually switching the
car back into the regular line haul movement.
The car delay resulting from this practice amounts
on the average to more than three days for each and every
inspection.

Now, this delay can readily be avoided by having

the inspection, if an inspection is desired, made either at
the point of origin or at the point of destination, after
delivery, or by omitting the inspection altogether as is
frequently done.
Historically, the nation's railroads have made
separate charges for providing in-transit, inspection service.
But in the Western District, unlike the East, which has been
doing this since 1963, these charges previously applied,
although with a number of very substantial exceptions only to
the second and subsequent inspections on any one grain
shipment.

The first inspection, in other words, was in the

Western District provided without additional charge.
This extraordinary practice grew out of a legal
requirement which no longer exists.

Until five years ago the

7
inspection of interstate grain shipment was required by
Federal law.

But in 1968, Congress repealed this requirement.

At the same time Congress authorized inspection on the basis
of so-called submitted samples.

The result of these changes

in the law is that under the law at present, any shipping
point in the country can also be an inspection point.
QUESTION:

Under this inspection requirement, did

the inspection have to take place while the grain was in
transit?
MR. POLLOCK:

No, Mr. Justice Stewart, it did not have

to ba dona while it was in transit.

But as the Commission

pointed out, because of prior practice and because of
convenience, the practice of in-transit inspection of grain
continued.
QUESTION:

But it wasn't a requirement.

MR. POLLOCK:

It was not required.

And in fact, one

of the principal reasons for the Commission’s decision in this
case is to stimulate the grain trade so as to

depart from

this practice in the light of the Commission's findings that
in-transit inspection is by no means essential.
QUESTION:

But it wasn't essential, as you just

told me under the old law.
MR. POLLOCK:

That's right.

It could have been done

the other way, but it was not.
The Court below found with respect to this 1968

8

repeal that, the primary purpose of the Congress was to effect
an increased utilisation of rail cars.

Nevertheless, in-transit

inspections continued in very large numbers, even after the
repeal , amounting, in 1969;, to over, or almost a half-million
inspections in just the Western District, alone.
Now, faced with this situation and an increasingly
critical car shortage, the Western railroads responded by
publishing the tariffs which are challenged in this case.
These tariffs impose essentially the same charge for the first,
in-transit inspection that previously applied to the second
and subsequent inspections.

The tariffs, of course, apply

only to grain shipments which are inspected while in transit.
There is no charge if the shipment is inspected at origin or
at. destination after delivery, or if inspection is avoided
altogether.
Before the Commission, the railroads even expressed
the hope that they would not have to collect one single cent,
of these charges, because the purpose

was to avoid the

inspection and not to raise revenue.
The Commission summarized its decision upholding
the charges in four chief findings.
Commission found that,

First of all, the

because of the repeal in 1968 and

because of other evidence of record, in-transit inspection
is no longer essential to the orderly marketing of grain.
The Commission found and said that this service

9
was entirely optional with shippers and with consignees and
that the basic responsibility of the railroads with respect to
transportation doss not require fchera to provide this service.
QUESTION:

Did the basic impetus, Mr. Pollock, for

these inspections come from the consignee or the shipper?
MR. POLLOCKs

Primarily the consignee, and indeed

primarily from the grain exchanges which are the principal
plaintiffs in this case.

Indeed, there is a considerable

economic advantage to these grain exchanges by virtue of the
in-transit inspection of grain since if the shipment is made
to a particular point for the in-transit, inspection at. that
point, the grain merchants in that particular area have in
effect a captive market with respect to that grain shipment.
The grain being there, it then becomes exceedingly difficult
for reconsignment of that grain to a distant market or to a
market which would require a backhaul on the transportation.
And indeed, it is this kind of dislocation, particularly among
the grain dealers and the grain exchanges which has brought,
forth principal opposition to these charges.
In other words, the Commission found that, this
service was purely an accessorial service, it. was a special
service and it was quit® unlike a service, for example, that
was needed for delivery of the goods.
Second, the Commission sustained the reasonableness
of the combination of the line haul rate and these inspection

10

charges.

The Commission pointed out that, under the tariffs,

the aggregate charges could never exceed the maximum reasonable
level determined by the Commission.

And the Commission,

reaffirmed the vitality of the maximum level, pointing out
that there was probably no segment of the country's railroad
freight structure that, had bean reviewed more frequently and
intimately than the one that has application to the movement
of grain.
Third, the Commission found that the inspection
charges themselves are just and reasonable because they were
less than tha cost of the service to the railroads.
And, fourth, the Commission found that the charges
would materially increase car utilization and that the
elimination of in-transit inspection of grain would increase
the number of available freight cars by several thousand
annually.
The Commission retained jurisdiction to determine
whether any funds derived from these charges should be used
to upgrade the railroad freight car fleets, and for this
purpose the Commission ordered the railroads to file periodic
reports showing just what was the actual operation of these
charges.

These reports dramatically confirmed the effective­

ness of these charges in reducing the volume of in-transit
inspections.

They also served to demonstrate, as the Commis­

sion found, the purely optional elective nature of the

11
in-transit, inspection service.

The reports show that the

frequency of such inspections before the charges became
effective was nearly two and a half times higher than the
frequency afterwards.

Stated otherwise, there has already

been in the short time that these charges have bean in effect,
a 60 percent reduction, and the frequency continues to decline
because of the economic incentive which these charges provide.
The most, recent report shows that there was only
about one in-transit inspection for every five grain shipments.
The Commission's findings were sustained by the
District Court, supported by substantial evidence.

But the

court set aside the Commission's order on the sol® ground that
the Commission did not adequately explain what the court
viewed as a departure from an allegedly long-established
Commission doctrine.
The court based this conclusion not on the
Commission's findings, but. instead on an expressly secondary
reason cited by the Commission for distinguishing a 1969
decision

Jy the Commission.

Entirely on this very slim reed,

just four sentences taken out of a 43-page report, four
sentences constituting little more than a dictum, the court
below held that the Commission had adopted what the court
called an evidentiary rule which is discriminatory per se
and that the Commission had thereby departed from its prior
decisions which require consideration of the reasonableness

12

of the aggregate charges in these service cases.
QUESTION:

What did it say about the Arrow case?

MR. POLLOCK:
Honor.

It said absolutely nothing, your

There was not one word in the court's decision concerning

Arrow or its authority to grant that, relief.

The only thing

that appears in the opinion is that in the very last sentence
of the opinion, Mr. Justice Douglas, after the court sets
aside the order, it. adds a sentence saying that the charges
are suspended until further notice and penaission of this
court.

There is no reference at. all to this very important

Arrow issue which my colleague, Mrs. Christian, will be
dealing with in greater detail.
QUESTION:

What if the District Court had held the

findings of the Commission were not supported by substantial
evidence and set them aside?

Then could it have enjoined the

rates under Arrow or not?
MR. POLLOCK:

No, your Honor, because all that we

would have in that case would be a situation where the
Commission had intervened with respect to carrier-made rates
and the entire 7-month period of suspension had expired.
QUESTION:

You say that the only thing that would

suspend the rates once the 7 months has expired is a finding
by the Commission that they were unjust and unreasonable.
MR. POLLOCK:
QUESTION:

That's right.

That's what, the —

Honor, while it is considering whether the court’s order is
appropriate.

that's exactly the structure that was set up and the delicate
balance which was established by Congress.

Mrs. Christian will spell ‘that out even more thoroughly.
I find that my time is up, and I am sure that Mrs.
Christian will deal further with that issue.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. BETTY JO CHRISTIAN ON
BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT INTERSTATE
COMMERCE COMMISSION
MRS. CHRISTIAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
As Mr. Pollock has stated, my arguments this
morning will be devoted to the second issue presented by this
case, that is, even assuming that the District Court correctly
reversed the Commission's decision on the merits and remanded
the case to the Commission for further proceedings, did it

15
nevertheless act. beyond the scope of its powers in ordering
that the rates themselves be suspended unless and until other­
wise ordered by the court?
On tills issue, I am speaking on behalf of both the
United States and the Commissionthe

It is our position that

order of the court, was beyond the scope of its powers.
Mr. Pollock has already stated the facts related to

the suspension issue, and I will not repeat them in any detail.
Briefly, these rates want. into effect on May 4, 1971, and
they remained in effect, until the Commission had issued its
original decision and during the entire pendency of this
judicial review proceeding.

It was over a year later in May

of 1972 that the District Court issued its opinion reversing
the Commission's decision and setting aside the rates.

It is

this portion of the order that, we believe is beyond the scope
of the court's power.
Resolution of this issue turns on Section 15(7) of
the Interstate Commerce Act as interpreted by this Court in
1963 in Arrow Transportation Company against Southern Railway.
Under Section 15, the right to initiate changes in their
rates is essentially a matter for the managerial discretion
of the carriers.

The Commission is empowered to declare the

rates unlawful oxily after full investigation.

The only other

limit upon the carriers8 right to initiate changes in their
rates is the provision of Section 15(7) which authorizes the

16
Commission in its discretion to suspend the rate for a maximum
period of 7 months.

The statute explicitly provides that if

the proceeding has not. been completed at. the end of the 7-month
period, the rates “shall go into effect."
In the Arrow case, this Court was faced with the
question of whether a District Court, would have jurisdiction
to itself suspend or enjoin the rates after the 7-month period
had expired, but before the Commission had issued its
original decision in the case.
not do so.

This Court, held that it. could

It stated at page 667 of its opinion that the

intention of Congress in enacting Section 15(7) was to vest
in the Commission the sole and exclusive power to suspend and
to withdraw from the judiciary any pre-existing power to grant
injunctive relief.

The only difference between Arrow and

this case is the stage at which the court has employed a
judicial suspension.

We do not believe that this is a

sufficient difference to warrant a different result.

In

other words, we believe that the reasoning of Arrow applies
here.
In the first place, the basic congressional policy
of Section 15(7) as confirmed in Arrow is to allocate between
the shippers and carriers the risks and burdens that are
necessarily associated with any proposed rat© change.
Inevitably, a carrier proposing a change in its rates wishes
to implement that proposal immediately, while the shippers on

1?
the othat hand would prefer to delay it until the lawfulness
of the rate has been finally determined.
The policy of Congress as adopted in Section 15(7)
was essentially a compromise.

It provided that during the

first 7 months the risks and the burdens on a proposed rate
change should be placed entirely on the carriers.
if the Commission

That £s,

chooses to suspend, the carrier cannot

implement its rate change and if the rates arte ultimately
found to be lawful, the carrier has no remedy, it can never
recover the lost remedies or the other lost, benefits of that
7-month period.
QUESTION:

Mrs. Christian.

MRS. CHRISTIAN:
QUESTION;

Yes.

Do you attach any significance to

Footnote 22 in the Arrow opinion?
MRS. CHRISTIAN:

entered here by the
These rates had been

The effect of the court’s order

was to change the status quo.

So the suggestion of a limited

power to maintain the status quo pending judicial review
simply is not this case.
We believe that the careful congressional balancing
of the risks and

burdens of suspension which this Court

held in Arrow, Congress intended to place on the carriers for
the first 7 months and upon the shippers thereafter subject
to the protection of a possible accounting and refund provision
of a reparations suit applies equally when the case is pending
before the Commission on remand as when it was pending before
the Commission in the first, instance.

In neither event, has

the lawfulness of the ratesbeen finally determined, and we
believe that the congressional policy is that once the 7-month
period has expired, the carriers are entitled to place their
rates into effect and to keep them in effect unless and
until the rates are finally adjudged unlawful.
QUESTION:

They have not —

I take it the courts don’t have that.

19

power, do they, to find rates unlawful?
MRS. CHRISTIAN:

This is exactly the point. I was

coming to, Mr. Justice Stewart.
QUESTION:

And until the Commission finds them

unlawful, the rates stay into effect, is that it?
MRS. CHRISTIAN:

That is correct, your Honor.

In

this case —
QUESTION:

What about my question to Mr. Pollock

Where the Commission upholds the rates as lawful and they are
in effect and the District Court finds that the judgment is
not supported by substantial evidence and sets aside the
Commission's findings, and let's assume the coyrt is quite
right that the Commission's findings weren't supported by
substantial evidence, or for other reasons were invalid.

They

still stay in effect, I gather?
MRS. CHRISTIAN:

Yes, your Honor.

If it is solely

a question of substantial evidence, it would be up to the
agency as to whether to decide the case on the present record
in which case they would be obliged to summarily find that the
rates have not been shown just and reasonable and to order
them cancelled, or to order a further hearing.
QUESTION:

You think that automatically follows

if the record remains the same, the Commission must then
automatically enter a judgment finding them unlawful?
MRS. CHRISTIAN:

I would not say automatically, your

20

Honor.

Certainly I can conceive of a situation in which a

court opinion makes it clear that under the legal standards
established by the court the ratas cannot possibly be
5

justified.

In. that situation the Commission would have no

alternative but to immediately enter an order —
QUESTION:

Can a District Court order the Commission

to find them unlawful unless the record is expanded?
MRS. CHRISTIAN:

I 'think that the court could not

“ order them to find the rates unlawful, but. certainly its
opinion could be written in such a way that under the court's
legal standards, the Commission would have no alternative
but to find them unlawful.

In that situation, the Commission

could simply enter an order finding in accordance with the
legal standards established by the court that the rates have
not been shown to be just and reasonable and ordering them
cancelled.

If it were strictly a question of substantial

evidence which might be supplemented by further evidence, then
there would be a matter for the discretion of the Commission
as to whether to permit the carriers to reopen the record
to offer further evidence.
QUESTION:

Can the court itself enter a refund order

contingent upon a finding of unlawfulness?

Let's suppose

that when the 7 months expire, the Commission doesn't enter
any order about a refund in the event of finding of unlawful­
ness

21
MRS. CHRISTIAM:

Certainly, in connection with an

appeal of the agency's final decision to court, the courts
and the agency have assumed that the courts have the power to
issue an accounting and refund order.

As a matter of fact,

this Court, issued an accounting and refund requirement at the
time that, it granted a stay of the lower court's judgment in
this case.

We have always assumed that the court does have

that power.
QUESTION:

Even if it can't find the rates unjust

and unreasonable or suspend them?
MRS. CHRISTIAN:

Exactly, your Honor.

Its other

equitable powers to impose conditions for the protection of
the shippers such as an accounting and refund provision are
not affected

in any way.

In addition to the congressional policy which I have
mentioned that the carriers be permitted to put their rates
into effect after 7 months and keep them in effect unless and
until they are found unlawful, we believe the Arrow decision
cited two additional policy reasons for denying the courts
the power of judicial suspension which we believe are
equally applicable when the case is pending before the
Commission on remand as when it is pending in the first instance.
In the first place, this Court pointed out that the
exercise of a judicial suspension power would interfere with
the primary jurisdiction of the agency.

And as I have just

22
pointed out in answering Mr. Justice White’s question, the
agency continuas to have primary jurisdiction to determine
the lawfulness of specific rates even though an error of law
has bean pointed out by the courts and the case remanded to
the Commission.

The actual determination of the lawfulness

of the rates is still for the primary jurisdiction of the
Commission, in the same nexus that this court found in Arrow
between primary jurisdiction and the suspension power applies
here as in the situation that existed in Arrow,
Secondly, this Court pointed out in Arrow that if
the courts were permitted to suspend, the result might be
different results to different shippers.

This same situation

could occur if the judicial suspension were permitted in
connection with the remand because, as this Court is aware,
any number of suits can be brought to set aside the same
Commission order in District Courts all over the country.
If those courts should reach different results, one sustaining
and the other reversing the Commission, and if the reversing
court were permitted to exercise a suspension power, then you
would have this same type of different results to different
shippers that this court was concerned with in Arrow.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Mr. Sweeney.

Thank you, Mrs. Christian.

23
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL J. SWEENEY, ON
*

BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. SWEENEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it. please

the Court:

Representing here the Wichita Board of Trade and
37 other grain industry groups which comprise in effect the
farmers in the Western United States, the country grain
elevator operators in that part of the country, as well as
the boards of trade on which grain is bought and sold and
many of the grain companies which

are the people who buy and

sell the grain.
First of all, this concept of inspection does not
explain itself.

What we mean here by inspection is a grading

of the grain in order to determine the quality of the grain
and the value of the grain.

Grain is susceptible to moisture.

It's susceptible to contamination of foreign material and
kernel content and thi? kind of thing.

So that to know that

you have a carload of grain doesn’t tell you anything about
what its value is or whether it can be used for human food
and things like that.

So you have to get a grade in order

to determine these things.
The practice over the years, as these gentlemen have
told you, and the young lady, has been to take this grade at
a market place, such as Chicago or Kansas City or Omaha.
The cars come in there.

The government-employed samplers go

24

out and they take the sample of the grain.

»

They run it down

to the Board of Trade, and it is inspected, analysed by
impartial government people and they say this carload is
number two yellow corn and it has so much moisture in. it, and
so forth.

At that point it becomes a salable commodity because

we know what, ws

have.

So the reason why the grain has been inspected in
transit has not been because of the Grain Standards Act, it
has been because this is the place to do it, this is where
the market is, this is the condition of the grain on the day
that

it is sold on the market, and this is where the

impartial inspection is available.
QUESTIONs

If it's in transit, that suggests that

it. was originally destined somewhere beyond this market,
doesn't it?
MR. SWEENEY:

No.

It's shipped to the market.

You

go from a country elevator to the market, say, to Omaha for
instructions and reconsignment.

After the inspection is made,

then whoever buys the grain says, "Ship it to Chicago," or
something like that.

You don't know who is going to buy the

grain until it is inspected.

That's the whole idea.

In

other words, when you bring it into a central grain exchange,
they can bring that sample before the Board of Trad© and
people all over the country, all over the world can bid on
that grain.

And in effect, the farmers gain the benefit, of

25
this total market.
And the other way to go is for the farmer to ship
his grain to Omaha to one of a handful, maybe half a dozen
elevators that are located there.
people.

He is at the mercy of those

He has to sell to them.
The other way he can go now is to ship it in there

and have it inspected and pay the $17, in which case he is
paying $17 extra a car for something that he has always done
and which is already paid for under the line haul rate itself.
QUESTION:

Ar© you suggesting there are no other

alternatives for solving the problem?
MR. SWEENEY:

Well, I think the alternative that

many people have suggested is that if the railroads are
really concerned about giving the shippers an incentive to
eliminate the grain inspection, the thing for them to do would
be to reduce their rates.

In other words, let's say the

rate is 20 cents from a point in Nebraska to Omaha -—
QUESTION:

Well, that is obviously an easy solution.

The carrier has no interest in the quality of that grain, has
he?
MR. SWEENEY;
quality of grain.

Th© carrier has no interest in the

However, by providing a service which is

of value, he is enhancing the attractiveness of the railroad
service.

But the point is that the carrier when they mad© the

20“cent rate, for example, they put into that rate 2 cents

\

26

specifically because of the costs of the grain inspection.
This was stipulated in the record.

If the rate was not a

full service rate, if the rats did not include the grain
inspection, that rate would be 18 cents.

So what. I am saying

to you is that if they want, to give them an incentive, let's
do what, they should do.

They can't, take away the service

and continue to charge us the full 20 cents.
QUESTION?

You agree with, I think it was Hr.

Pollock's comments, that the railroads lose money on tills
inspection, that the inspection process costs more than the
enhanced rats.

Do you agree with that?

MR. SWEENEY:

Well, if you are talking about, the

$17 car charge, the $17 approximates what it costs —
QUESTION:

No, I am talking about his generalization.

Do you agree with that?
MR. SWEENEY:

The railroad is not losing money on

grain traffic? they are making a very substantial profit.
For example, somebody put some evidence in that on the whole
they are making 150 percent of the direct costs.
QUESTION:

No, that wasn't my question.

MR. SWEENEY:
QUESTION:

I am trying to get your question.

Are they losing money on the inspection

process standing alone?

That is, so that they would rather

eliminate the whole process and from their point of view, they
argue that they would be better off.

27
MR. SWEENEY:

lie hasn't said they are losing money

on inspection process.

What, ha has said is that, part of the

total transportation as has existed has been a portion in the
middle whereby the grain has been inspected and it takes 3
days to do that.

And he said they are occupying our cars

for 3 days„
Now, if we can put something new into the tariff
that will discourage that, eliminate it, then we can free up
more cars and alleviate to some extent the grain car shortage.
This is the basic proposition on which they present their
case to the ICC.
QUESTION:

But there is no dispute that the carrier

isnot interested in this inspection business.

They would

just as leave get rid of it for once and for all.

Is that

correct?
MR. SWEENEY:

I don’t think that's correct, your

Honor, because if they want to do that, they would have
proposed and said, as of tomorrow, we will not perform any
grain inspections regardless of price.

They haven't done that.

They have said, we will continue to perform grain inspections,
but we will do it at an additional cost of $17 in addition to
our rates, which already pay us once for that.
QUESTION:

I understood Mr. Pollock to say that they

would just as leave stop the whole business.

What interest

does the railroad have in having the grain inspected?

What

possible interest, could they have?
MR. SWEENEY:

For example, he could have a lower

truck rate than the rail rate,and this many times happens,
and he can ship by rail nevertheless at a higher price.
Because when he gets to market, he is going to have the
advantage of the market place.
QUESTION:

So the inspection helps the carrier.

MR. SWEENEY:

The inspection helps the carrier to

get grain on his railroad instead of having that grain go
down the river on a barge, instead of going by truck.
QUESTION:

If on the other hand he is willing to

give up that great asset, you object to it?
MR. SWEENEY:
two reasons:

Yes, your Honor, we object to it for

.29

First of all, he is destroying the marketing
structure which we have built up over 50 years.

He is putting

a lot of people out of business that are involved in this
thing.
The second thing that he is doing is he is saying
to us, "I am going to take the service away from you as X
continue to charge you a rate which includes a specific cost
for that service.

We would have a much different, case if they

were here saying, "We took our rates and we took 2 cents off.
We've published separata rates." ,
Now this is what, has happened in the past.
why this case is such a crossroads.

That is

In the past where the

railroads wanted to put. rates in without inspection, they have
reduced their rate, they have said,

"We will drop from 20

cents to 18 cants, we will now give you an 18 cent rate which
you can use without, the inspection.
incentive."

We will give you an

And this is what has happened.

Now all of a sudden they have switched into this
new position.

They want to take away the grain inspection

and they want to keep the higher rates which compensate them
for it.

They can't have it both ways.

If they want, to go

down this other road, if they want, t.o come back next, week,
they can publish a new tariff and say, "Every rate in the
West shall be 2 cents lower whenever grain inspection is
waived."

This is the way that, they could have gone.

They

30

could have avoided all these problems.

They could have

about to the extent that they want.
do that.

But. they didn't, want to

They wanted to add a charge so that the man -who

takes the grain inspection has to pay for it once in the rate
and secondly with the $17.

And the man who is prevented from

doing it because he says, "I don't, want to add another $17,"
hs still pays the old -rate which included the compensation.
So the people that are using the inspection are
being deprived because they are paying double.
who don't use

The people

the inspection are being drsprived of a

service that, they are paying for right now, today.
QUESTION:

Do you figure it's tantamount to an

increase in the line haul rata?
MR. SWEENEY;

It certainly is, your Honor.

It's

increasing the total charges and in effect it's increasing the
line haul rate indirectly by reducing the service.

You still

pay the same price, but. you get less service for it.
QUESTION:

It's an increase in the total rate which

the carrier doesn't want.

It isn't very often carriers don’t

want increases.
MR. SWEENEY:

Well, your Honor, as we figure it,

they have collected between $4 and $S million a year on this,
so they have been getting money on this.
QUESTION:

I am just relying on what they represent

31

in the argument..
MR. SWEENEY:

I think if they are really sincere

and all they wanted to do was get. this goal of helping the
car supply, they would come out with a vary straightforward
proposition.

They would say, "We are going to knock two cents

off every rate as of tomorrow,if you don't taka your inspection,
you are going to save 2 cents."

This is what. I can an incentive.

What they have been calling an incentive is actually a
penalty.

They are saying, "You are already paying for it

once, tomorrow you are going to pay for it twice."

We can' t.

go along with that.
Unfortunately, the Interstate Commerce Commission
did.
Mow, we get to the question of why are the Interstate
Commerce Commission decisions reviewed at all by courts?

The

reason is because Congress put statutes, and they said,
"You can interpret these statutes, and you can apply them to
the facts, but you can't do it arbitrarily."
exactly what we have here.

And that's

We have an arbitrary decision.

We have a decision where the Commission was overwhelmed with
all this evidence and repetitive testimony, all this legislative
history

from the Grain standards Act about how important

car supply is and how this thing is going to help car supply.
So the Commissioners are sitting there and they have
got letters in their files, they have got complaint.3, they have

32
got. people criticizing them in the newspapers about the car
supply.

And really the problem is that the railroads just

don’t buy enough cars to replace the old ones.
15 years, they havs dropped 300,000 boxcars.
have over 600,000,
they talk about

In the last
They used to

Now they have got 300,000 plus.

So when

a saving hers of 3,000 cars a year or 6,000

cars a year, this is not. the solution to the car shortage
problem.

It's a small step in that direction, but it's not

the great solution

that, was presented.

Sc the Commission looked at. it. and they said,
is a car supply case.

"This

We are going to approve this thing."

And at. that point, they said, "We are not. going to file the
statute.

We are not going to look at this pile of evidence

over here.

We at the Commission know well enough what is

good for the public, what is good-for the railroads' car
supply.

We don't have to look at the statute."
Then \m have to look to the merits of the decision

with this background because this is really the background
on which the Commission decided the case.

When the Commission

came here, in their jurisdictional statement, they specifically
said to this Court that, they were not. going to ask the court,
to review the merits of their decision.

Apparently at that

time when they first, came here, they were convinced that
they couldn't defend their decision.
Now, in the last, few months something has happened.

33

They filed a brief and they are now trying to defend themselves
on the merits.

I am not. going to question their right, to do

that, but. I think it does show a little bit that there was a
certain lack of confidence in their own decision..
What, do you have to prove in a case like this?
You have to prove that the changes in the rates and charges
are just and reasonable.

This is Section 15(7) of the Inter­

state Commarce Act.
Wow, one bothersome thing when you have concepts
of just, and reasonable, it's somewhat, vague.
just, and reasonable rata?

And what, is a

Well, in this particular case, in

this particular Act, Congress put in specific standards that
ths Commission shall consider and determine what is a just and
reasonable rate.
Commerce Act.

The standards are in 15a(2) of the Interstate

One thing is that they must show that the rates

are at. the lowest cost consistent with the total service.
And the other thing is they have to show the effect on the
movement of the traffic, whether or not. the traffic would be
diverted.
So the Commission then had to come to grips with the
situation.

More specifically, within 3 months before these

tariffs were published, the District Court in Ohio had affirmed
a decision of the ICC in a transit charges case which was the
same kind of situation.

The Southern railroads decided that,

we have been providing transit, on cotton for a long time at the

34
lina haul rata.
$50 a car for it.

We will now add a charge of something like
That, case went, before the ICC, and the ICC

decided, one, you have got. to present costs for the through
movement, show us how much it costs to handle this traffic,
how much your cost is for the transit, and give us your total
revenue and your total cost.

Otherwise, we can't determine the

overall reasonableness of your proposal.
The other thing they said is that, there would be a
likelihood that you are going to lose a lot of traffic to
trucks if you raise your rate like this.
That case want to the District Court in Ohio and it
was affirmed by the District Court, and then went, to this
Court and was affirmed.
So here we are starting out and we are going to trial
in this case and the railroads have got to prove these things.
Yet they put in no evidence whatsoever on these issues.

And

this is how the case comes to the Commission and they are
sitting, trying to write a report which is going to find these
rates just and reasonable when the railroads have put no
evidence in on two issues that are spelled out by Section
15a{2).
Well, they had quite a job on their hands, trying
to do that.

Here is how they went about it.

They said,

"Well,

we don't have to follow the principles of the Southern
Transit case',' which incidentally axe the statutory principles.

35
They said, "This case is different, from the Southern, Transit,
case where we said you have to have total costs of the total
movement and show us how much money you are making on this
traffic before we are going to let you tack a charge on top
of it."

So they said, "Well, in this case we have got. thousands

of rates and a wide area.

And where we have a big job on our

hands like this, it's just too much to ask the railroads to
come

in with costs.

They shouldn't have to do that."

Well, of course the Southern Transit case

involved

rates throughout the South and involved all the railroads and
involved thousands cf rates.

So this distinction was, I would

say, spacious at this point.
I don’t know how strongly these people are defending
that in this case.

They talk about it as a dicta.

They walk

away,virtually a dictum. This Court many years ago in the
?
Aluminum Divisions case said that thars are means of meeting
it when you have got thousands of rates involved, present
typical evidence, and then with some kind of a sample show us
representative rates and that's good enough.
the business of the Commission is carried on.

And this is how
Every day over

there wa have got cases involving thousands of rates.

Nobody

throws up their hands and says, "There are thousands of rates,
so don't put any evidence in."

That’s not. true at all.

Where

you have got thousands of rates, the justification and necessity
for putting in these costs required by the statute is even

36

greater because there are more people affected by a case like
this.

They could have broken this case into 50 different

cases, 1st each railroad try their own case.
that, much less rates in each ana.

There would be

But because they all cons

together and all simultaneously tried to put this thing
across, it doesn’t take them out of the statute and relieve
them of the statutory burden of proof.
The other way the Commission went on this point is
they said, "Well, we find that vs back in 1934 issued a
decision on grain rates and in that, case we looked very
closely and we decided what a reasonable level of .rate would
be.

Now, if we take those rates and add to it every single

general increase we have had the last 40 years, we would find
that that total rate is still higher than what the shippers
would get here if they add the $17 on top of the rates that
they are paying today."
Nov:, what had happened is that the 1934 rates had
become obsolete.
today.

They no longer moved the grain traffic

If these were the only rates that we had in the

tariffs, the grain traffic wouldn't move by rail at all.

It.

would either be uneconomic or the barges and the trucks would
get it all.

There ±3 no question about that.

Thase rates

are as high as the sky.
So the Commission said, "Well, we've got. that, and as
long as the railroads haven't

exceeded those rates, which

37

their principal witness said are paper rates that, don’t move
any traffic, as long as they don’t exceed thos* rates, wa
find that, this is all right.”
QUESTION:

But that at least amounts to a finding

by the Commission, whether supported or otherwise, doesn't it.,
that even treating this as an increase in the line haul rate,
it's justified.
MR. SWEENEY:
rather than a finding.

I would treat, that as a conclusion,
The findings that are required under

Section 15a (2), the Commission shall consider the relationship
between the costs and the revenue.

Now, instead of doing

what they are supposed to do under 15a(2), they went off into
the wild blue yonder, and they say, "Well, we will consider the
fact, that these rates are not higher than the 1934 rates plu3
150 percent, over the last 40 years.”

They did not do what

the statute said.
We don’t deny that they have the right, to throw
this kind of language into a report and say, well, these rates
areno higher than the 1934 rates plus 150 parcant.

But that

doesn't excuse them in any way from fulfilling their function
under 15a(2) which says, "You shall consider the costs and
the revenues.”
today.

They have to consider the costs and the revenues

This is what it’s all about.

What's happening today?

How much is it costing to handle the traffic today?

They can't

just simply say, "We've got res judicata, we have a rate that

38
was decided 40 years ago."

There is no res judicat,a in

administrative law in Commission cases.
and they have got to get evidence.

They have got. to come

They have to decide it

v

on the facts.

They have to know how much profit are the

railroads making on these rates today?

Can they afford to

reduce the rate and give them a reduced seal® of rates
instead of adding something on top of them, on top of rates,
in many cases, which are rather high?
They tried to walk

They tried to get off the hook„

away from the statute by referring to an old decision.
Wow, if you stay with that for a moment, let’s say
they prescribed a rate in 1934 of 10 cents.

That rate today

is, say 25 cents, it's gone up 150 percent.

There was never

any prescription by the Commission that a 25-cent. rate is
just and reasonable.

In order to bridge this tremendous

leap from a 10-cant rate to a 25-cent rate, the Commission
said, "Well, over the years those cases have gone up in these
general increase cases, and therefore every time we have a
general increase case, this rate now becomes the new maximum
r easonable rate."
Well, that isn’t true at all.

They have been taken

to court after general increase cases where shippers and
groups of shippers have asked the court to review and say,
"Our rates are unjust and unreasonable with this 5 percent
increase."

The Commission and the railroads say, "That’s not

And the justness and reasonableness of the rates on

And this Court sustained

a decision of a District. Court, on exactly that, point, that
you can't even get a review of the justness and reasonableness
of the rates established in these general increase cases.
Now, they want to have the other side of the coin
and come back here and say, "Oh, yes, these rates are just
and reasonable.

They were established in

cases as just and reasonable."

Those two concepts cannot

live together, there is no room for both of those things to
exist side by side.

If they found them just and reasonable,

then they should have been reviewed.

I don't see how they

could find them just and reasonable if they never looked at
them.

All they look at in those general increase cases is

the total revenue need of the railroads, they need 5 percent
more money, and if they find that they do, they give it to
them,
I ought to say just something on this Arrow case.
We have here a special situation, and all this talk about
possible refunds gives us no help at all.

These people have

40

put in a charge which they want to be a barrier.

They have

coma into this Court and said that since the charge went in,
50 percent of these inspections no longer take place.

So that

on the shipments which they have precluded, nobody is going
to get a refund of $17 a car on a shipment

use it.

On the other 50 percent, what happened to the charge
is that it. was passed on to the farmer.

When the purchase

was made from the farmer, they deduct the freight rate and
the $17 a car.

That's taken right away from him.

to do with the shipment.

He is not
He has nothing

He will never get that $17 back.

Every day that this case goes on without restoring the
District Court's decree, the farmer is losing $17 on every
car that is inspected.
The other way he loses is that he is losing his
market.

He can't get this nationwide market that we have

been providing him.

So we have people going out of business.

We have grain .inspectors that have been fired.

We had this

whole system of marketing through grain inspection which is
being gradually destroyed and taken apart while the litigation
goes forward.
And the railroads understandably, and the ICC not
quite so understandably, say that no one can do anything about

41
it.

And they rely upon the Arrow case which said that, we

don’t want single judge courts doing a job before the ICC
decision which can only be done by 3-judge courts under the
statute after an ICC decision.
Wa submit that the railroads loss a case, they can
go to court,

get the Commission set aside.

And then they can

i

put their rates in.

On the other hand, the shipper should

have the same power.

They should have the same right.

They

shouldn’t be just going to .court to touch bases and to go back
to the ICC again.

They should be able to get. some substantial

relief while the case goes back to the ICC, bearing in mind
particularly that it isn't necessary for the court, to say
this is just and reasonable or it is not just and reasonable.
QUESTION:

What you are saying, Mr. Sweeney, i3 that

Arrow doesn’t apply then.
MR. SWEENEY:

Because Arrow concerned itself with

what could take place before the decision of the Commission,
what v/ould happen if the Commission doesn’t, make its decision
within 7 months suspension, if it takes them a year.

What

happens in that 5 months before the Commission has discharged
its function?

And they said we do not think that the court

should be taking a crack at this kind of a case before the
Commission in its primary jurisdiction has completed the
record and has made its findings.

At that point, as it was

noted in the footnote, the case belongs to the 3-judge courts.

It's up to them to decide, and it's up to them to decide
whether the situation is such that they have to grant some
kind of ancillary relief.
us ancillary relief.

And we asked that court to grant

We didn’t ask them to grant, the specific

relief that they did, but we asked them to order the ICC on
remand to iroraadiately have these rates cancelled.
QUESTION:

What do you say to Mrs. Christian's

argument that that footnote dealt only with the maintenance
of the status quo?
MR. SWEENEY:

Well, the status quo, your Honor,

is the last peaceable status prior to litigation.

In this

case that was prior to the publication of the rates. Prior ro
this controversy arising there was no inspection charge.
Now, because they have succeeded in maneuvering this case
that by the time they got to the courthouse the rates had been
in for a few months doesn't change the court's right to restore
the status quo.

The status quo existed before the case

started.
QUESTION:

You don't read the Arrow case as taking

the judges out of rate-making then, in broad terras, as the
opinion seems to read.
MR. SWEENEY:
one way or the other.

I don't think that affects rate-making
I think for a court to issue an

injunction like they did here, all they are saying is that you

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Irahoff.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM A. XMHOF, ON
BEHALF OF THE SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE
MR. IMliOF:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

44
til© Court:

My name is Imhof, I represent, the Secretary of
Agriculture,
The Secretary is represented here today because both
of the issues principally before the Court today are of
vital concern to farmers.

Farmers, after all, are the fellows

who are bearing this charge that w© have been fighting about.
The grain farmer in the West sells his grain to a country
elavator.

He receives the price that day at Minneapolis,

Chicago, less the cost of getting it there by railroad.
Historically, line haul rates included a stop for inspection
which facilitated the 3ame of the grain at the market.

Mow

the railroads have added a penalty charge over and above the
line haul rate for the inspection, and that penalty charge,
too, is deducted from the price the farmer receives for his
grain.

And this burden is especially bitter for the farmer

because he knows, and indeed our friends the railroads
conceded at. the hearing below, that, they were already collect­
ing for this inspection charge out of the line haul rate.
Therefore, the new inspection charge from a revenue standpoint
for the railroads is largely gravy.
Hovrsver, we are more greatly concerned, and I will
confine my remarks to appellant's attack upon the equitable
jurisdiction of District Courts upon review of ICC orders.
And this issue is of concern not only to grain farmers, but.

45
to farmars generally.

Farmers rely heavily upon rail

transportation, for both transportation, of their products
and also for their supplies.

Their livelihood sometimes

even their economic survival depends on there having available
rail transportation at reasonable rates.
Of course, what is their first line defense against
unreasonable rates?

It's the Commission.

But if the

Commission makes a mistake, if it approves a railroad-proposed
charge on less than the requisite amount of substantial
evidence, where should they go?

Until recently, it. seemed

clear enough that a shipper could bring 3uit. in a 3-judge
District Court which,if it sustained his charges about the
Commission's failure, could enjoin collection of the charge.
This was the view of the Alabama District Court and of the
Fifth Circuit, whose judgments you affirmed in the case, in
Arrow.

In this case, of course, it was the view of the

District Court in Kansas.

We believe it was also the view of

the District. Courts in California in the Cantlay case, and in
the District of Columbia in the Ad Hoc Commission on Consumer
Protection case.

I think we might note in passing that it

was also the view

of the Illinois District Court in the

Inland Waterways case which is relied upon by the railroads.
This Court reversed the District Court in that case, but
didn't question the exercise of equitable jurisdiction by the
District Court..

I think the District Court in that case did

46
go too far and foreclosed the discretion of the agency on
remand„

And that was the reason it was overturned by this

Court*
Just over two years ago, however, a District Court,
3-judge District Court in New York, declined to enjoin
collection of Commission-approved rates on the ground that,
the theory of the decision of this Court in
extended foreclosed such relief.

logically

The Small Shipments decision,

was, of course, pressed upon the Kansas Court, in this case.
But the Kansas Court declined to alter its judgment, and indeed
refused a stay of its judgment expressly because the farmer
who was bearing this inspection charge can be protected only
if collection of the charge is enjoined.
Appellants argue that the injunction issue is
controlled by Arrow and that, under Section 15(7) of the
Interstate Commerce Act only the Commission can suspend a
railroad rate, and then only for the statutory period.

they overlook the fact that the suspension provision in
Section 15(7) is confined by its own terms to the period
prior to Commission decision, and they also overlook the fact
that, in Arrow both this Court, and the lower courts were
careful to confine their holdings to the situation presented.
That is, where the Commission had not yet completed its
investigation or issued an order.
While both the District Court and the Court of Appeals

47
in Arrow denied the availability of injunctive relief at. that
stag©, both concluded that after final order by the
Commission approving railroad rates, the 3-judge court upon
review of that order has the power to enjoin the effectiveness
of the rates.

In affirming those judgments, this Court also

pointed out the judicial cognizance of the reasonableness of
rates is confined to review by a 3-judge court of the ICC order.
It

can’t take place before that.
We submit therefore that upon a fair reading Arrow

lends no support to appellants’ argument.
our conclusion.

This is not simply

We would refer your Honors to the decision

in the D. C. Circuit Court of Appeals which was referred to in
the decision of the Acl Hoc Commission on Consumar Protection.
We note also that in that case, the Court held injunctive
relief to be available notwithstanding that there was a
possibility of a motion for reconsideration before the
Commission.
The dichotomy drawn by the courts in Arrow and Ad Hoc
between the judicial role before and after decision by the
Commission approving rates is entirely consistent with the
statutory scheme.

The Congress provided for two situations.

The Arrow case dealt with one of them.

That was shippers

resorting to injunction prior to Commission decision and they
amended 15(7) to provide for that.
But in this case we are not talking about 15(7).

We

48
are talking about, the urgent deficiencies of it*, which
Congress provides espressly for judicial review of Commission
orders.

It created a commerce Court and transferred the

jurisdiction of that court in turn to the District Courts.
It had no intention at any time of restricting the equitable
powers of the Circuit Courts or the Commerce Court, in making
those transfers.
I think I would like to address a couple of specific
points which have been of interest to the Justices in the
arguments presented heretofore this morning.
QUESTION:

Before you do that, what is your answer

to Mrs. Christian's argument on status quo?
MR. IM1I0F:
QUESTION:
HR. IMHOF:

On Footnote 22, your Honor?
Yes.
First of all, I think we might argue,

we might well remember that the Court here did not. flatly
remand it to the Commission and lose hold of it.
retained jurisdiction over this case.

The court

So it is for all

practical purposes pending judicial review.

And Professor

Jaffa, at. least, has sanctioned that as a legitimate judicial
device to retain jurisdiction of a case.
QUESTION:

It certainly is anticipated that, the

Commission is going to take some further proceedings even
meanwhile.
MR. IMHOF:

Yes, your Honor, I suppose it would be.

49
Yes.
QUESTION:

Well, X would think so, if you say, "We

set aside your order because you

haven't, given decent

enough reasons„"
MR. IMHOF:
with directions.

I would assume it would be remanded

It was not. remanded with directions here.

The proceeding is not inconsistent with this opinion, yes.
So the answer would be, yes, your Honor.

Yes.

I would like to address perhaps your Honor's
question about the possibility of a decision being batted back
and forth between the reviewing court, and the Commission.

X

think if you logically extend the Commission's argument to
its fullest length, you are reviving the negative order
doctrine.

As you remember, the Commerce Court, produced the

decision in Proctor & Gamble, and in Proctor & Gambia this
Court, held that an order such as the one we are referring to
here is a negative order not subject to judicial review.
Of course, then injunctive relief was not available because
the court never even got jurisdiction over the order.

But if

you push their argument to its logical extent, I think we are
getting right back to the negative order doctrine.
don’t, believe this Court should take that, action.

And I
I don't

believe that this Court in overturning the negative order
doctrine in the Rochester Telephone case had any intention
of separating injunctive relief

QUESTION:

Wall, you agree the court, itself couldn't

hold the rates unjust and unreasonable, don't you?
HR. IMHOF:

I tend to, yes, your Honor.

Or do you?
I believe

that's it and I agree with that.
QUESTION:
MR. IMHOF;

You agree with that.
I believe it's the jurisdiction of the

Commission.
QUESTION:

And hasn't. Congress provided, or has it,

that the rates may not be suspended beyond 7 months until
there is a finding that they are unjust and unreasonable?
MR. IMEOF:

Until there is an order of the

Commission, your Honor.
QUESTION:

I submit that. that, is a very valid —

Yes.

Until there is an order of the

Commission that they ar© unjust and unreasonable.
MR. IMHOF:

Until there is an order of the Commission

in the proceeding pending at that, time before the Commission.
The judgment made by Congress was to keep the court, out of
the Commission's hair for whatever period of time it required
for the Commission to exercise initially at least its
primary jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

That period -So you say if the rates are in effect

and the Commission finds the rates just and reasonable, the
Commission itself could suspend the rates beyond the 7 months
pending judicial review?
MR. IMHOF:

If the rates were just and reasonable?

51

QUESTION:

Yes, if they found them just and

reasonable.
MR. IMHOF:
QUESTION:
MR. IMHOF:
QUESTION:
MR. IMHOF:

No, no, your Honor, X do not.
You don’t?
No.
Even though a court could?
A court, could suspend the rates if it

found that, the Commission's decision was not supported in your
example by substantial evidence.

Therefore, the Commission's

finding that the rates were just and reasonable would have
no support, it would be invalid.
*

QUESTION:

I know, but. that still leaves the rates

in effect under the 7 months rule.
MR. IMHOF:

Not once the court has jurisdiction over

the case, I would submit, your Honor, no.

I don't think you

can draw thi3 dichotomy between judicial review of an order
and equitable relief.

And I feel this matter is perhaps

disposed of in the footnote in the Rochester Telephone case
as to the forms of direction which would be available to a
court upon review of such an order.
QUESTION:
MR. IMHOF:
Honor.

I believe it's footnote 29.

Have you fully answered my question?
I am not sure if I did or not, your

I believe I answered the first part as to whether or

not the court is retaining jurisdiction pending judicial
review.

52
Mr. Sweaney has pointed to the casas indicating that,
the status quo can be restored,

And I submit to your Honor

that perhaps that would answer the second part.
QUESTION:

You associate yourself with that argument.,.

MR. IM1I0F:

With that argument, yes, I do, your

Honor.
Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Imhof.

Mr. Pollock, you have about 4 minutes left.
REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF EARL E. POLLOCK ON BEHALF
OF THE APPELLANTS ATCHISON, TOPEKA & SANTA
FE RAILWAY COMPANY ET AL.
MR. POLLOCK:

May it please the Court, may I first

of all point out that, much of the argument made by the
appellees hare bears no relationship either to the findings
made by the Commission, which I commend to your Honors, or
to the proceeding that was conducted before the Commission.
For example, Mr. Sweeney's principal argument hers concerning
the necessity of a cost analysis under Section 15a(2) was
never raised before the Commission.

And, of course, under

this Court's decision in Tucker and other cases is barred.
But more fundamentally, the appellees' arguments —
I think this gets perhaps to the crux of it. — fail to take
account of the nature of the rate-making function and the
Commission's role and discretion in performing that, function.

53

When it comes to carrier-made rates, there is,
contrary to the appellees * suggestion, no single rate which
is reasonable.

There is .instead a zone of reasonableness, and

this zona is located between a reasonable maximum and a
reasonable minimum.

And a carrier is free under repeated

decisions of this Court without a special permission from the
Commission to adjust its rates as long as those rates stay
within the zone of reasonableness and do not violate the Act.
Now, what did the Commission do here?

On the

basis of its own prior decisions and its particularized
attention year after year after year, decision after decision
after decision, the Commission reaffirmed the vitality of the
current maximum reasonable .level and said, thus, even if wa
add, even if we were to add these inspection charges to the
existing line haul rates, the resulting combination would still
not exceed the zone of reasonableness.
Furthermore, and in particular relation to Mr.
Justice White's earlier question, X think it is important, to
recognize that under the statutory scheme, carrier-initiated
rates are valid unless set aside by the Interstate Commerce
Commission and not vice versa.

In other words, under the

statutory scheme, a carrier need not get permission to
institute rates.

Instead the carrier has that right.

Congress

gave the carrier that right, subject only to the Commission
power to suspend the rates for this limited period of 7 months

54
and it. was on that basis that this Court in Arrow said that
that is the only exception made by Congress and neither the
Commission nor courts can intervene beyond that.
With respect to the optional nature of the inspection,
Mr. Sweeney has said that, this is absolutely essential.
look at the facts.

But,

At the present time only one inspection

is made for every 5 shipments, certainly indicating that it
is not essential.

Furthermore, in-transit inspection has

never taken place, as the Commission pointed out at page 15
of the appendix, with respect to all barge traffic carrying
grain, all truck traffic carrying grain, and now 80 percent
of the shipments by rail go without, any in-transit inspection.
It is for the Commission to determine whether this is a
necessity.

And the Commission found at page

56 and pages 17

through 19 of the appendix that it v/as not essential.

And

certainly this is not the forum to reargue the nitty-gritty
of rate-making issues.

If there is anything which is

committed to the discretion of the Interstate Commerce
Commission, it is this matter of determining what constitutes
a reasonable rate under established principles.
It is also instructive, I would say in closing,
that although both appellees now argue for the necessity of
the suspension power in courts, they do not. even see fit to
request such relief in the District. Court.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Pollock.

55

Thank you, gentleman,.
The case is submitted,
(Whereupon, at 11:53 o’clock a„ra., the argument in
the above-entitled matter was submitted.)
