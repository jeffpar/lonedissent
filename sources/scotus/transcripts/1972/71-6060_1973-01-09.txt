in Ho. 71-6060, Tacon against Arisona.
Mr. Hirsh, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT J. HIRSH, ESQ*,
OH BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
:

'. .

ie£

.... g ,

ease

Court:
If I could give the Court a brief recitation of the
facts in this particular matter, Mr. Tacon was a soldier at
Fort Huachuca in 1969, and in February of that year he was
arrested for unlawful sale of marijuana*

He was claimed to have

transferred a lid or an ounce of marijuana to an undercover
agent, and the result of:that arrest was a charge in the
Cochise County Superior Court in Southeastern Arizona*
Mr. Tacon was given appointed counsel.

He was released

on his own recognisance, released back to his company commander*,
and in the summer of that year, he had spent thee consulting
with the Court appointed attorney, and there was a continuance
granted at the Court appointed attorney’s request.
There was no time set after the motion for continuance
was made.

The trial judge didn’t set a time certain, and in

December 3.969 Mr. Tacon was discharged from the service.

He

called his Court appointed attorney and said, "Mr* Whitney,
I’ve got to go back to Hew York.

X am discharged from the

serviced
Mr. Whitney thereupon told Tacon, “That’s fine.

Give

me your address hack there and 31 «ill notify you «ken the trial
comes up. t:
On March 3rd ~~
Q

Were these conditions

—* on remaining within the

jurisdiction of the Court?

of

the

issues that «as raised in Cochise County at a hearing, and

the

ME. HIRSH:

only

Ho, sir, it wasn’t*

restriction that Tacon had

on him

That «as one

was that his orders had

bean'flagged, and Tacon testified at the hearing that he didn’t
knew the meaning of that, and all he understood «as that he
«as to remain at Fort Huachuca as long as he

xms 'in

the Amy,

but he didn't understand or didn’t have anyone toll him that
he couldn’t go back to Mew York.
The trial judge had

a

different belief as to that and

trial judge, in fact, had claimed that Tacon had violated his
trust and violated the bail arrangement by leaving the State,
although, I think, the record shows that Tacon did act in good
faith. "

.••;
When, he went back to Mew York, he called the court

appointed attorney in Cochise County, and also he had a Federal
charge that at that time was against him, and he called

the

ILS. Commissioner in Mogales, and the bail restrictions in the
Federal charge did specify that he «as not allowed to leave the

5

StaSe of Arizona without prior permission.
Taeon called t .a U.S* Commissioner, got specific,
expwcs permission to leave the State aad then went to Hew York,»
So the state of the record indicates that at least
he didn't have any good faith pie* for cause to believe that ha
was not allowed to leave the State of Arizona.
Q

Does the record show how he got hack to Mew York on

his own funds?
ME. HIRSH:

Ho, it does not: show that.

X assure that he bad some severance pay from the
service ot the service provided money to get back to Hew York.
Q

Was he a Hew Yorker when he entered the Army?
unless it has changed, the Amy lets you out where you

earns in.

So lie probably got back to Hew York at the taxpayers'*.

expense•
MR. HIRSH:

l m. almost certain that heme a Hew York

resident, but I don't have a specific recollection of it.
X know his family, during .the time he was In the
service; moved to Florida, and his mother was a Florida resident
at the time this particular case earns up for trial.
Q

Does the record show whether he consulted with his

lawyer before he left Arizona?
MR. HIRSH:

Yes, it does.

The Appendix shows that ««»

in fact, our hearing after the trial indicates that «■*? and the
attorney verifies this — that .Tacon called the attorney on the

6
phone and advised him that he was oo%? being discharged from
the aervice, told him he «as going to Sow York, and the at ton.;.-: :

said, "Fine, you just give me your address in Nau York In order
to enable me to locate you «hen the case Is called for trial."
So5 X think it is clear from the record that Tacon
did act in good faith «hen he «ent back to Mm York, and X
fairly «ell convinced he didn*t violate the ia% based mi my
interpretation of the facts.
Xn any event, ’lacon returns to EJ©« York, and on
March the 3rd, the trial judge,by minute entry,advises counsel
that the trial date is to be March 31, 1970.
The attorney *-<* the court appointed attorney «»
after receiving notice of the trial date, then «rites a letter
to Tacon.

tod in this letter, he merely states, ’*Your trial is

not-} set for March 31st.

X «ant you to be out in Bisbee at least

one week prior to the time set for trial."
That «as if.
if he «asn*t present.
Q

There «as nothing about trial in absentia
There «as no more said.

Xs.there any explanation for the long delay between

the alleged commission of the offense and the trial?
MR. HIRSH;

Court procedures in Arisona..

Sometimes

we have long delays in Arizona ~~ 'X shouldn't make admissions
like that, but there is no appafefent explanation.

It Is common,

at least in my county, t© have delays of a year or a year and
a half, depending on the court calendar.

If is not common in

1
Federal court.
q

It io common in our State court.

it t'?a3 a year "« more than a year
MR, HIRSH:

wasn't it?

Yes, sir.

They are trying to resolve

attempting to resolve

those problems right nos* to speed up the process.
In any event, Tacon — and I might add, the Arizona
Supreme Court opinion is in error and the Attorney General is
in error when they say that Tacon, by- that letter of March 3rd,
was advised that he would be tried in absentia.
This is the only notice that Tacon received from his
court appointed lawyer, that is, the letter of March the 3rd.
Tacon received this, he testifies, at around the 8th
or 9th of March, and he now has — finds himself with a short
time to get out to Arizona, and he lias no funds, at least this
is what he testifies to.
On the 28th, it is, of March, he attempts to call the
court appointed attorney.

This is on a Saturday, and he calls

the attorney in Wilcox, Arizona, at his home, and he is unable
to reach him.
He again calls on Monday, that is the first business
day after the weekend, and tells him, ”X simply don't have the
funds to get to Arizona.

I. don't know what to do.”

And the court appointed attorney — and I might add
on the 24th, County Attorney of Cochise County gets wind of the
fact that Tacon might not be available in Arizona for trial, and

6
the State is bringing a witness from El Reno. Oklahoma» to
testify and the county is anticipating spending some $1PGQ0
in order to see this witness gets to Cochise County.
The County Attorney then advises the judge that there
is some question about Tacon appearing at trial, and the judge
says, “Well/5— there is admitted entry and it is part of the
Appendix in this case.

The judge says, ”I£ he is not here,

we are going to try him in absentia.'3

There is admitted entry

to that effect.
The court appointed attorney is advised of this and
in the telephone conversation that occurs on March the 30th
tells Tacon -« this is the first time that Tacon is advised ~that if he is not present in Arizona the very next day that he
will be tried in absentia.
Q

!

Affirmatively advised to that effect?
MR. HIRSH:

Wells this goes to the issue of Waiver,

and X think it is the State's position that there was a knowing
and intelligent waiver of his right to be present, and the
waiver is fortified by the claim that Tacon was specifically
advised that he would be tried in absentia if he didn't appear.
That simply isn't the case at all and the fact of
the matter is that he was advised of the trial date by the
letter of March the 3rd, but that was the only notice he had
received in enough time to get to Arizona in order to be
present for trial.

9
In any event, the trial starts March 31st, the court
appointed lawyer appears before the court and advises the
court that there was- a telephone conversation with Tacon, but
Tacon didn’t have the funds to be present.
The judge who had apparently made up' his mind from
the week previous said, “You search the court; area and see if
this gentleman is around and if he is not around we are going
to try him in absentia, and 1 am tasking a finding now pursuant
to Arisona Rule of Procedure 231 that Tacon’s absence is
voluntary."
Our Rule provides that this finding is to be made at
the outset of the' trial, and we will get into the distinction
between Rule 43 in the Arizona Rule, but in any event, the
finding of voluntariness is made by the trial judge at the
start of the trial prior to commencement of trial that morning.
They go through the first day of trial, and, I might
add parenthetically, there was a confession extracted from
Tacon of questionable voluntariness,and this isn’t in the
record.

But they had Tacor?. locked up for three hours after the

sale was made and Tacon was crying and after three hours of
interrogation he finally confessed that he, in fact, had sold
the lid of marijuana to the undercover agent.
So that was at issue that second day of trial.

The

first day of trial they selected the jury and made opening
statements and examined the first witness, the one from El Reno.

10
And the second day, the State had Intended to present:
evidence of the confession

have a voluntariness hearing

outside of the presence of the jury.
The court appointed lawyer gets word after the first
night of trial that Tacon5 3 mother now finds out that Tacon is
supposed to be in Arizona, and the mother is going to provide
funds for Tacon to arrive in Arizona.
Q

Who did that word come from?
ML, HIRSH:

The way Chat the information got to the

mother was the result of a letter being sent to Tacon’s former
mother-in-law’s residence In Mew York, and the former mo the r«* in*
law then advised the mother in -** Tacon’s mother -- in Miami,
Tacon’s mother then called, I believe, Whitney, the court
appointed lawyer, and thereafter hired a lawyer by the name of
Bert Levy in Miami to attempt to negotiate with Whitney to see
that Tacon arrived in Arizona for trial,
Q

So that when Whitney came into court to make his

representation on the second day of the trial he had had no
direct communication from the defendant himself that he would
fas there?

is that correct?
Ml. HIRSH:

Yes, sir.

The only communication he had

had theretofore was the telephone conversation on March 30th,
and thereafter he didn’t hear directly from Tacon.

He heard

from the mother and then from the attorney in Miami.
Q

And the substance of the conversation on March 30th

11
was that he might be there or might not?
MR. HXR8H:

Ho-, the substance of the conversation

was to the effect that, ."Mr. Whitney* I want to be there.
intend to be there.

I

But X simply don’t have the funds at the

present time to get to Arizona, and would you see if you can gel:'
me a continuance.15
And Whitney said, r‘X doubt if I am going to be able,
in fact, X am sure I can’t
Q

This is on March 30th?
MR. HIRSH:

This is on March 30th, yes, sir.

This is on Monday, the first business day after the
weekend.
The reason he gave for not calling earlier was that
he just didn’t know what to do.

He thought — he was hopeful

that he would come into some money or something would happen
that would enable him to have the funds to arrive in Arirons
but his expectations simply didn't materialise<,
In any event, after the first day of trial, the judge
is now advised that there are funds available for Tacon to
arrive, there is a motion for continuance made and the judge
again made a second express finding at that time, denied the
motion for continuance, made a second express finding that
Tacon was voluntarily absent
Q

What was the motion, specifically?
MR. HIRSH:

The specific motion was a motion to

12
emifinue for one day In order to enable Tacon to be present
at ferial and in order to, X suppose, in part, controvert the
voluntariness of the confession.
Q

Did he. get there the nest day?
MR, HIRSH:

He got there on the third

he got there

the night of the second, which would be Thursday night.

The

trial terminated on April 1st, that was on a Wednesday*
Q

So that even if the motion had been granted it would

have been fruitless?
HR. HIRSH:

I suppose that if the judge had given

him one clay he would give him a day end a half, until Tacon
actually appeared,
Q

I don*t think the judge was that —

Well, 1 know, but the fact is that
MR. HIRSH:

Yes.

The continuance was for one day.

The motion was made «Q

Because the anticipation was that he could easily be

there by that time?
MR. HIRSH:

I expect that he had the hopes that Tacon

could arrive.
In any event, that motion was denied.
proceeded to trial.

The case

The jury went out and promptly found Tacon

guilty.
Tacon arrived Friday morning, turned himself in ~~
There was a warrant for his arrest, and remained in the Cochise
County Jail until he was sentenced some three or four weeks

The trial judge **•
Q

Was there another motion on the night of the second

day?
MR* HIRSH:

Ho, sir.

The second day, the trial terminated 9 and the jury
found Tacon guilty*
Q

They «ere out a very

time*

There «as no further motion to keep the record open

pending his arrival?
HR, HIRSH:
Q

Ho, sir.

Was there any statement that he «as going to testify,

or not?
MR* HIRSH:
representation*

Ho, X don't believe there «as that

I don’t see how the court appointed attorney

could have made that representation, and recalling the record .
Q

I didn’t say he should.

X just wondered If he did

make that -**
MR. EXRSH:

X believe that one representation that

was made was that he wanted to contest the voluntariness of the
confession.

I am sure that that's in the record.

That's not

in the Appendix, but it Is in the trial record.
Q

So he would have testified outside the presence of the

jury on that, X suppose.
MS. * HIRSHs

He would have testified that that

confession was involuntarily made, X believe,

y,•

Again* 1 wasn't trial counsel in the case, and X
know there was substantial question as to voluntariness that
was raised and the issue was resolved adversely to Taeon by the
trial judge, but at least: there would have been some chance
that that confession was excluded.
v might add that confession was replete with c: Lie;:;,:
of other crimes that weren't related to this — in feet, my
claim before the Arizona Supreme Court was that this confession
shouldn't have been admitted because there were irrelevant
material that showed that Taeon had engaged in other bad acts,
and it should have been excluded for that reason.

Q

Was there any request to delete the irrelevant parts

of the confession?
MR. HIRSH:
lot of experience*

Ho, he didn't.

This man did not have a

The record was not a good one.

Q

Has motion for a new trial ever been made?
MR, HIRSH:

Q

Ho, sir.

How about -•> does Arizona procedure provide any way

of collateral relief for the improper admission of a confession
in violation of the Federal Constitution?
Ml* HIRSH:

There is no specific procedure other than

appeal, that we have means of getting into court in Arizona —
we don't have a 2255 statute, or anything comparable in Federal

15
law, but we ggJ.I the petitions for coram nobis relief*
Q

Could fee raise the volw..f:a rinse.- eh his' confession

'by coram nobis.-, in the State court?
MU HIRSH:

'Cell, he could have raised the Issue, on

appeal.
Q

Could he raise the voluntariness and get an

evidentiary hearing?
i

MU HIRSH:
Q

•

I suppose he could, at this juncture*

Do you know why no motion for a new trial was made?
MR. HIRSH:

Yes, Your Honor.

It was not made because **- our position was the
burden was on the State of Arizona to affirmatively show this
man’s absence from trial was knowingly and voluntarily made;
and the State never presented hearing on this particular matter
and I don’t feel that for the defendant to now have the burden
of making a motion for a new trial and having the burden of
proving that he was absent is violative of his Constitutional
right and violative of the Constitution.
In order to have waiver, I think this Court has
long held the burden is on the State of Arizona or on the
Government to show-that waiver and show it by clear and
convincing evidence.
Q

But your motion might have been granted and instead

you have taken the burden of an appeal up here.
MR. HIRSH:

I doubt that in view of the trial judged

16
feelings towards this man

X doubt that the trial judge wouic

have granted any relief In this particular case*
0

Arizona Supreme Court wauld have granted-, relief if

your analysis is correct.
MR. HIRSH:

Well, the

we

issue was presented to the Prison® Supreme Court and, in feet,
the first time that anyone claimed fclsat there should have beer,
a motion for a new trial made was in the response by tie Attorna
General in this case that perhaps the defendant should have
made a motion for a new trial.
But the same issues were presented to the trial judge*
They were presented to the — X take that back.
presented to the trial judge.

They waren3t

They were presented to the

Arizona Supreme Court, arid the Arizona Supreme Court didnf t
mention our Rule 311 that provides for a motion for a new
trial.
The Arizona Supreme Court met the issue directly and
held that the absence of Tecon was voluntary,.that Rule 241
was Constitutional and that was the end of it.
So X think it is superfluous, number one, to have
made a motion for a new trial and, number two, X think that,
again, that would be at odds with the Constitution because it
would place the burden on showing waiver on the defendant.
And, again, that conflicts with all the principles that —

q

Weil, there you are assuming that on that motion the

conventional rule of putting the burden on the movant would
have applied; but if you had pressed that point in the trial
court, how do we nor know that the court would' not have
adopted your version of the burden of proof?
MU. HIRSH;

Well, of course, you can1t be certain.

X know this judge personally —
Q

that’s not what we are concerned about.
MS, HXSSH:

X understand that, Your Honor.

1 have doubts that he would have accepted that and
perhaps X was remiss in not making a request, but, as 1 say,
the issue as to whether or not that motion should have bean
made was never brought up, was never raised

in the Arizona

Supreme Court, and it is now raised for the first time by the
Attorney General here.
X think if the State wanted to interpose that argument
perhaps they should have raised it at some previous time.
In view of the fact that the Arizona Supreme Court
did resolve this matter on the issue, my position in this
particular matter -*» I might add,after the trial terminated,
there was a contempt hearing.
Tacon received a sentence of 3 to 5% years in the
Arizona State Penitentiary by this judge and a short time after
judgment was entered and sentence was passed he filed — directed
the County Attorney to file an order to show cause ~~ ordering
Tacon to show cause why he shouldn’t be held in contempt for

failing to abide by the eo-e:i:!e order, appearing at the time
specified in the minute entry.
That was my first appear
result of that was that we had an evidentiary hearing on the
fcion of whether or not Tacon wilfiilly and intentionally
absented himself from the jurisdiction.
Vie didn*t get into the Constitutional • question,
although the hearing was akin to the issue that’s before the
Court now.
V

The trial judge, after hearing all the evidence,
took the matter under advisement and it is — to this day,
he is still under advisement.

He never did rule as to »1 -flier

or not Tacon was held -- or should be held — in eon tempt for
his wilful failure to appear.
He did state — and I might add, state gratuitously
-** on the record that after Tacon — at the close of the hearing,
Tacon requested to make a statement to the court.
In the statement, he said, "Your Honor, I swear to
you that I intended to be present at trial.

I never intended

to absent myself and X swear to you that what X have told you is
the truth/1
And the trial judge at that time said, 'sMr. Taeon, I
can assure you that X am not impressed one bit with your
stated intention at this time/3

And that was the end of it.

We. took the appeal to the Arizona Supreme Court and it

use

age as a

judge made a finding,
Q

X suppose the judge has heard this is about as clear

a credibility finding an a Judge could make?
MR. HXESE: Well, again, I distinguish that, that
the issue just squarely wasn’t presented to the court.
And X think that when we are talking about a finding —
Q

He heard the witness and saw him and he. .heard all

the witness-* reasons and excuses —
MR. HIRSH:

X think that when we are talking about

an evidentiary hearing on the question of waiver, as to waiver
of a Constitutional right, 1 think there ought to be a little
more specificity than a judge*s reaction to witnesses*
testimony, and X think we are talking about, in fact, an
evidentiary hearing.

That’s what this Court has always mandated,

that an evidentiary hearing be eaade, and fchaf; specific findings
be determined by the Court.

And there were no specific findings,

X grant the Court that perhaps you can infer what the
findings might have been had they been squarely presented to the
court, but there were no such findings made and the Issue was
:

never squarely presented to the court.

X have no rag nay to be there, and until X do «— X fully intend

there is no other alternative-, in this-..matter,- then I think' they

Q

But you are saying again the State must furnish the

funds to bring him bask by extradition, for example*
MR. HIRSH:

He will have to be brought back under

compulsion and hie bail is going to be forfeited, and he is
going to be charged with bail jumping, If that jurisdiction has
a bail jumping statute, or he is going to be *Q

Is extradition normally used after a person is

indicted, or is it the function of extradition to get him back

HIRSH:

That’s the traditional function, hut they

extradite usa«ter those circumstances «here -** at least there

is a. claim for finding by authority that someone has violated
his bail agreement*
Q

Yew: position is that if the person says X have no

moneys, and he has no money to get back, that the State may

mt

try him until it dees something else?
I#*. HIRSH:

Q

That’s correct,.

You have to take that position in this case,

don71

you?
MR. HIRSH:

1 don’t have to,

I can be successful

claiming that there was no finding

this case

of

in

fact and

that the procedures in Arizona are incompatible with the
Constitution, that is the findings should

bo

made at the

termination of the trial, and that no such finding was made in
this case, and ask the Court to return this case for an
evidentiary hearing

and

a finding by a trial judge.

That to me, tour Honor, is not satisfactory,

I

don’t *~
Q

The fellow who uses all of his money to get as far

away as he

can

can just sit there until the State comes and

gets him, and not be tried ?

m.

Q

HIRSH;

It is like the witness that, perhaps «*

Was your answer, yes?

22
ME. HIESE:
Q

Yes, sir.

Meanwhile, the State has spent seme money getting

other witnesses there, as they did In this ease, did they not?
MR, HIRSH:
Q

They brought a mao from another penitentiary -MR. HIRSH:

Q

Yes, sir.

El Reno, Oklahoma.

Yes, sir.

At some substantial expense?
MR. HIRSH:

Yea, sir.

But you have to weigh that with the fact that

a man is not going to receive a fair trial if he is absent,
Q

Justice Whits suggests that puts a premium on

fugitivifcy by every parson once he Is charged, and puts the
burden on the charging State to take the time, trouble and
expense of bringing him back,.
MR, HIRSH:

If a person uses this claim of poverty

as a subterfuge to avoid returning to the State, I suppose these
are a lot of means that you can use to avoid going to trial —
it doesn*fc answer the question as to whether this person should
be constitutionally tried in absentia.
Q

The majority of defendants these days don’t need any

subterfuge on the issue of indigency, do they?
MR. HIRSH:

The other way to obviate that, resolve

that problem, would be to make, to have bail restrictions
restrict the individual to the State.

That would be another

way of resolving that problem, and in our Federal Court, we are

23
required

defendants

are required

*.

to call counsel once

a week*
Q

not, if he had left in violation of ball?

Q

That’s correct, but he still could not be

What do the terms, the restrictions in bail agreement:,

add to the problem?
MR* HIRSH:

Well, they might give the local court

more control over the defendant in the hopes that he will
abide by that bail arrangement, but there is nothing that can
ba dona —• the question is weighing the fact of trying someone
In absentia, with, in this particular Instance, a court
appointed counsel, in fact,

in most instances,

a court appointee

counsel, without that individual being present to be at the
trial, to make sure — to assure that there is integrity in
that trial, and make sure that court appointed counsel does
his job, as opposed to the State’s — the policy of proceeding
with the trial in the defendant’s absence»
Xb ia a weighing, S think it is a matter of policy•
Q

Could the motion to suppress the confession have been

made before this man left Arizona?

Q

Mo, sir»

You can’t make a pro «trial laotieh?

24
MEL HIRSH:

Ho, sir.

We donffc have any provisions, any procedural pro­
visions, in our State procedure,fco suppress confessions prior
to trialc
You can suppress unlawfully obtained evidence, but
as far as the voluntariness of a confession is concerned, that
has to be done at trial.
He don't have any specific rule, unless the trial
judge grants you permission to have that done prior to trial,
but we don't have any rules that enable that to be done pretrial.
Q

It Is a matter of discussion with the court?
MR. HIRSH:

It is not really — the custom is to do

it at the time of trial.

X have done it prior to trial, when

X have made special arrangements with the prosecutor and with

the court, but «**
Q

Was any attempt made to do that here?
MR. HIRSH:

Ho, it wasn’t.

X don’t know what the state of preparation of the
court appointed counsel had prior to the commencement of trial,
and, again, it is another reason to my mind that you have get
to strike a balance as far as policy Is concerned, and X think
the better one Is in favor of the defendant rather than in
favor of the — facilitating the State’s trial of an individual.

In reading their opinion -•> and they seem to be

concerned with the factual question of whether or not your client

the Buies of Criminal Procedure, 17 Arises© Revised Statutes,
rather than of any constitutional question.
MR, HIRSH:
raised.

The latter aspect of ray claim today wao

X would tell you that X read my brief and X believe

I might have conceded the constitutional validity in part of
231 because it had Just recently been ruled upon by our court9
but I did claim that the procedures used, that is the placing
of the burden on the defendant, was violative of his con­
stitutional right «*«
Q

The court doesn't deal with that.
MR* HIRSH:

They didn’t answer that question and

affirmed at least the implicit finding of the trial judge.
Q

And in your statement, in your brief, you do talk

about constitutional provisions Involved, but it didn't seem

to me that the Arlscma Supreme Court really dealt with whether
or not there was here a voluntary absence or an involuntary
absence-, which is, as a matter of fact, conceding all along
the constitutional validity of the provision and dealing with
the matter only as a question of fact.

26
MR, HIR.SB:

The latter issue as to the waiver aspect

arid the constitutional validity of the waiver la the Arisen®
Procedure was raisedQ

But not dealt with by the court.
®, HIRSH:

That issue was raised and argued-.

But not dealt with,

Andj therefore, if it wasn't — if under Arizona law,

That's my question.

And that would depend in part upon

Arlsona law, insofar as does it require you to raise it at the

Q

In any event, It sounds like a pretty good idea.
ME* HIRSH:

tess sir.

Sound principle of law.
X only have a couple of minutes and X would like to
tall the Court: — X haven* t gotten around to advocating my
position, and my position is,one,that Rule 231 is unconstitu­
tionally valid, that th© only time that a defendant should be
tried in absentia would be, one, where he expressly consents
thereto, or he makes an express waiver prior to trial, or unde:;
a Rule 43 situation, that is, where ha appears at the trial,
the start of the trial, and thereafter absconds or leaves
because there you at least have an inference that he consulted
with counsel, that he certainly knew about the trial, that he
was ready to try the case and thereafter leaves, or third,
disrupt —
Q

The day before he can * fc foe tried.
MR. HIRSH:

That would be my position, as a matter

of policy, and X think this Court has so held.

*£ you read the

line of cases up through Bias?» it has always been the position

29
of this Court that: the position is embodied in lluie 43«
And l think even if there is the situation where he

there still has to be a later determination ~~

It's a vexatious and a difficult one.

The follow with the money.

Can they try him or not?
MR. HIRSH:

My position would be they cannot, because

it is incompatible with the Constitution, with the defendant’s
right and necessity to be present at the trial.

have just stated to you, would be that at a minimum, if

And X am going to tell you what they have done on Rule 231 in
Arisons.
There was a recent case decided by our Supreme Court
that *- State, ...v, 'Pavis - - decided a day or two before this
Court accepted cert, in

my

petition, where they had given notice

to the defendant and he wasn't seen thereafter and he was
tried in absentia and no one had seen him — he had a court
appointed lawyer — and he was convicted, and X don't recall
whether he was sentenced, and that case was affirmed by the
Arisons Supreme Court, and apparently is the settled rule, in
Arigoaa, that all you have to do is give the basis of my case,
of Tacoa«
Q

On the basis that he was voluntary, as a matter of

fact?
HE. HIRSH:

As

a

matter of fact, and the presumption

that he had voluntarily absented himself arose as a result of

31
his being given notice of the trial date.

Q

Was that ease a 2011s titutional decision or did it

purport to be?

This decision doesn't, es X understand it.

MR, HIRSH:

X am almost certain that issue was

raised. An a matter of fact, it was certified to our Supreme
Court j as a special procedure we have in Arizona, and I am
almost certain the constitutional issue was reload in that
case, that again Rule 231 was attacked in the Supreme Court.
Whether they answered it in constitutional terms,
1 don't recall.
Q

If they decided it on the basis of your case, then

they did not decide it on constitutional grounds, federal ■
constitutional grounds.
MR. HXE.SE:

Q

Yes.

But you say they had to decide the federal question in

your case.
MR* HIRSH:
Q

Well, it was raised.

Otherwise, as Mr* Justice Stewart says, there is no

MR. HIRSH:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM P. DIXON, ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MS. DIXON:

Mr. Chief Justices and may it please the

Court::
In specific answer to the question of Mr* Justice
Stewart, the constitutionality

of

Arisona Rule 231 was conceded

fey Appellant before the Arizona Supreme Court in hie brief, and
as ho says in the subsequent argument,only went to whether or
not the evidence finding the voluntary waiver of presence at
trial was sound enough and overbearing enough to stand the
problem that all constitutional waivers have to stand.
q

1 wonder «*«> we don’t 'have, X suppose, in the present

record, the briefs that were filed In the Arizona Supreme Court?
MR* DIXON:
Q

That was my oversight.

It was nobody’s oversight, but I wonder if they could

fee supplied?

35

ME. 3D3DCOB:

They certainly could, if it would be

acceptable to this Court.
Q

If the Chief Justice is agreeable, X would like to

ask that they be.
MR* CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

It is not a requirement

that you do ordinarily, but we would like to have them in this

ease.
MR* DXX0H:
Q

X would like to submit them.

Can I **-

Is that the way you present your errors, or do you

specify errors?
MR. BIXOII:
Q

X don't understand you, Mr. Justice.

How do you get issues before the Supreme Court

of Prisons, in your briefs or do you specify errors ahead of
time ?
HR* DIXDE!:

In the briefs, is the way they are

Ho,you don't have a motion for a new trial with
any specifications of error or assignments of error*

You

Your brief to the Arizona Supreme

Court sets forth all of the questions which you want presented
to the Court.
Q

How about it.

Is there — do you know whether there

Is a rule in Arizona that the Appellate Court will normally
or always consider only questions which have been presented
below?

36

ME„ DIX0H:

That is the rule, Mr. Justice White.
recently,

and the Federal

Courts,

re

re

re

been considering Federal

Constitutional -questions when they are raised for the first
tine with them; but that rule is of long standing, that unices
it; is presented first to the trial court, to give the trial
court a chance to correct its own mistake, it will not consider
it on appeal.
As X say, they have been ignoring that tacitly in
recent decisions, when it has been a constitutional question
that is' first presented.
And X think rightly so, because otherwise they can
go to the Federal District Court on writ ofnhabeas, and there
is no question about it.
Ms case, for me at least, has been one that was
difficult to get a handle on in the beginning, and I think that,
was because of three particular reasons, the first reason being;
the claim

of poverty.

Poverty seemed to raise the constitutional

question that we had rms roughshod over somebody’s rights, over
sores poor person*8 rights.
X think also because of the claim that there had beer,,
no hearing on voluntariness, and than, finally, of course,
when X searched the record, we found that the trial judge made
no express decision after he had heard all of the testimony on
his motion for contempt.

Bui: really the only issues that this case could ever
present, whei

efore this Court or before the Ariadna S preme

Court, would be two.
One is the. coDSfcifeufcionality of Arise-:.-a*s Rule 231*.
And the second issue would fee dependent upon the resolution
of the first, and that would be,grai
coastltutiotsal 9 was these sufficient evidence before the Court
to sustain the finding, if only an -implied finding, which it
did make?
Q

Sufficiency of evidence
MR* DXXQJSS:

rule?

1 think it does, Mr, Chief Justice.

The only way I can read this ease, is to read it
as to whether or not there was a sufficiency of evidence here.
Q

Well, that's none of our business in a State case,

is it?
MR, DIXOM: That's correct.
Q

Unless there is an absolute absence oi evidence,

which would make it like Thompson v. Lew.
MR. DIXQS5:

This is correct.

Or unless we had a clear

one v?here the burden was on the State and the burden was
clearly not met.
This is part of the reason why I had such a difficult
time getting a handle to this.
Q
here?

Do you think there is no central question, presented

38
MR. DIXON;

Rot properly presented, Mr. Justice

Douglas.
I Chink it could have perhaps come before this Court
in a proper state, hut I don1C think it is properly before you
today.
Q

How could it have come here properly?
MR* DIXON;

Had the constitutionality of Arizona

Rule 231 been attacked either at the trial court or in the
Arizona Supreme Court, and it was not,
Q

Or by Federal habeas corpus.
MR* DIXON:

Q

Or by Federal habeas corpus.

Which, I take it, is still available?
MR, DIXON:

As a matter of fact, State habeas corpus

is still available, Your Honor.
Q

Because it wasn't presented, you think, in the

direct proceedings?
MR, DIXON:
Q

It is not available if it was, is It? In Arizona?
MR. DIXON:

Q

That's right.

I am sorry, I didn’t understand that.

Let’s assume you do present a Federal constitutional

question in the criminal case and it is rejected.

Then, may you

raise the same thing in State habeas?
MR, DIXON:
Q

No.

Unless there is —

You say the Federal question was presented to the

Arizona Supreme Court in the brief of petitioner?

39
MR. DiXOd:
Douglas.

Ho, I say it was not, Mr. Justice

As a matter of fact, the constitutionality of

Arizona Rule 231 was expressly conceded.

Unfortunately, that

did nut get in the record before this Court.
Q

is that the reason that you have before you now that

you are going to furnish to us?
MR. DIXON:

Yea.

Appellant does not argue with that proposition, nor
does he urge the Court to hold that Rule 231 is unconstitutionn
Q

On its face?

la that what it means', or as applied

or what?
MR, DIXON:

Perhaps this will answer it.

The thrust o£ this argument is premised then on
the fact that the evidence in this ease doe3 not clearly show
that appellant knowingly and intelligently waived his right to
be present at trial.
Q

That raises a federal question then, doesn’t it?

Those two things put together?
MR. DIXON:

Now, the first statement said he did not

question the constitutionality of the rule.

The second state­

ment said -~
Q

Would you read the whole thing.

Not the whole brief,

but that whole paragraph.
MR. DIXON:
Q

All right.

From the beginning?

I am not clear as to what you have been reading.

40
Isolated sentences or what?
MR. DIXQII; Well —
Q

Read the part that relates to the concession that

you said he made in his brief.
MR. DIXON:

All right.

uThe established rule ia this jurisdiction as to
criminal trials being held in absentia has been set forth by
this Court in State v. Taylor.

This Court, in interpreting

Rule 231 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure, held in that case
that a voluntary absence from trial by a defendant constitutes
a waiver of the defendant’s right to be present during the
trial of his case.

Appellant does not argue with that proposi­

tion nor does he urge the Court to hold that Rule 231 is un­
constitutional.5*
That’s the opening paragraph of Petitioner’s brief to
the Arizona Supreme Court on the constitutional status of
Arizona Rule 231.
Q

And then you proceed to say that the thrust of this

brief is that the question presented here is whether or not
there was in fact a waiver?
MR. DIXON2
Q

Yes, sir.

Counsel, if you are in a position to leave one copy

of that with the Clerk, we will have it circulated to ail
members of the Court, in ease you don’t have multiple copies
with you.

41.
MR, DIXON:

I am in a position to do it3 Mr, Chief

Justice, but X have put ray own ink. marks in it from time to
time.
Q

Vfe would want all the briefs, of course.
ML, DIXON:

Yes.

His, ours and his reply.
I have- no further formal argument,

X am available

for questions.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr, Dixon.

Thank you, Mr. Hirsh.
The ease is submitted.
You will undertake to leave copies of your briefs.
MR, DIXON:

Yes, sir.
4

We will get together and I will make sure the Clerk
has all the briefs that were submitted to the Arisons Supreme
Court.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

The ease is submitted.

(Whereupon, at 11:48 o’clock, a.m., the oral
arguments in the above-entitled case were concluded.)
