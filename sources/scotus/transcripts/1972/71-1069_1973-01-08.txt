MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs
next in No. 71-1069,

We will hear arguments

Associated Enterprises against Toltee

Watershed District.
Mr. Burgess, you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF HENRY A. BURGESS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. BURGESS:

Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the

Court:
This case is before this Court on appeal from the
mandate of the Supreme Court of Wyoming, affirming a judgment
which was entered by the state district court for Albany
County, Wyoming.

The mandate and the judgment of the state

court found that certain Wyoming statutes providing for the
creation of a watershed improvement district did not violate
the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the
United States Constitution.
This action was commenced by the Toltee Watershed
Improvement District, which is organized under the provisions
of the Watershed Improvement District Law of Wyoming, seeking
entry upon the lands belonging to Associated Enterprises for
the purpose of surveying and drilling a dam site preliminary
to the construction of a dam.
The lands involved are owned by Associated

4

Enterprises and are under a lease to the Johnston Fuel
Liners»

Johnston Fuel Liners as lessee was not allowed to

vote in the election which created the district.
Q

Mr. Burgess, where in the record is there a

finding by either the trial court or the Supreme Court of
Wyoming that Johnston Fuel Liners was a lessee from
Associated Enterprises?
MR. BURGESS;
G

It is in the appendix, Your Honor.

Whereabouts?
I

MR. BURGESS;
Q

[Pause, no response]

The reason I ask, I did not find it in your

stipulation of facts,

I found it in questions and answers

submitted in interrogatory form, but I did not find any
finding, at least in my study, either by the trial court or
the Supreme Court of Wyoming, that assumed it as a fact.
MR. BURGESS:

On page 19 of the appendix, there

is a stipulation of facts.

Paragraph three says that

Johnston Fuel Liners is not a land owner as defined by
WS 1957 and so forth.

Although given notice of the time and

place of the referendum, had no legal right to vote and did
not vote.

That was in the stipulations of facts.
This case was not actually tried.
Q

It was submitted

That does not sound to me like a stipulation

that Johnston Fuel Liners is a lessee from a property owner
in the district.

5
Q

At least they allege that Johnston Fuel

Liners owns cattle which grazes on the land.
MR. BURGESS:

That is correct.

They allege that

they are in possession of the land and then there is an
order and judgment from which the appeal was taken.

And on

page 24 in the interrogatories, interrogatory number three,
starting at the bottom of the page 23, we go down through
the interrogatories, the second interrogatory says that
they commenced using the land in 1959.

The use was

continuous since 1959 to the date of the answer of the
interrogatories.

Interrogatory number four says Associated

Enterprises purchased some cattle, in 1969 ran the cattle
on lands in the Toltec District.

Then in interrogatory

number five it talks about the lease agreement between these
two companies and the exchange of use of various lands.
Q
realise.

This is Johnston Fuel Liners' position, I

But how are we to know that either the trial court

or the Supreme Court of 'Wyoming accepted this position?
MR. BURGESS;

Well, X believe in the Supreme Court—

[pause]—-the order of intervention, of course, Johnston Fuel
Liners was not originally a party defendant and they were
allowed to intervene.

And in the motion it says that the—

this is again on pages 14 and 15 of the motion—that they
were a lessee.

And the entry of the lands upon Toltec, of

the entry by Toltec upon the lands of Johnston Fuel Liners

s
in interference with the movant8s rights to its use and
possession of the lands--that is on page 14 in the appendix.
Q

Why do you not go ahead.

I was just concerned

about the point.
Q

I notice, though, before you leave it, on the

top of page 25 there is the request in the interrogatory,
"Please attach all copies of leases between Johnston and
Associated Enterprises."

And then the answer is that the

agreement is reflected on the journals of the company and
that there is no single written lease document,
MR. BURGESSs
Q

This is just an occupancy of sufferance?

MR. BURGESSs
it that.

Correct.

1 would assume that you could term

The two corporations own lands which are

intermingled.

And one of them uses lands in one area and

one uses the other.

There is a monthly payment.

I would

take it that it is a tenancy which could be revoked at the
end of any annual period of time.
Q

Do you think that that might bear if it is a

tenancy of sufferance, an occupancy of sufferance, it might
be relevant to the consideration of their interest in voting
on the matter?
MR. BURGESS:

Yes, 1 would think that the interest

of any user of this land who occupies it, that his interest
is as great as the interest of any person who owns the title

7
to that land.

Secondly, of course, anything which affects

the rent which would be charged upon that land would also
affect a person who uses that land.
Q

Would you think the right to vote might be

different if it is a 99~year lease or occupancy of
sufferance terminable at will?
MR. BURGESS:

No, Your Honor, I think the right to

vote is something that is granted by the—-in this
particular case-"-by the particular act, and the act says
that a land owner may vote and all other parties are
excluded.

So, it would seera to me that if you are not a

land owner, it does not make any difference whether your
tenancy is one of sufferance for a year or for 99 years.

In

any event, you are excluded from voting.
Q

But in order to have standing to maintain your

constitutional issue, you have got to show that if the
Constitution were applied in the way you say it should be,
that your client would end up having a right to vote, do you
not?
MR. BURGESS:

Correct.

I understand that.

And

that is why the interrogatories and the order of the court—
the court did allow Johnston Fuel Liners to intervene, finding
perhaps not expressly but certainly by implication and a
general order that all of the facts and legal conclusions
necessary to enter the order are embodied in that order.

8
As I say, the case arises under the statutes
relating to the Watershed Improvement District.

The purposes

of that district, of course * are to provide for the
prevention and control of erosion,, flood water, sediment
damage, is to provide for the storage, conservation,
development, utilisation, and disposal of water and thereby
to preserve and protect land and water resources.
It is also designed,as the statutory purpose
states, to promote the health, safety, and general welfare
of the people of a state.
This district is formed by the written petition
being filed by land owners with the board of directors of
what is called a water and soil conservation district, which
board then determines whether or not in their opinion the
district would be feasible.

Thereafter, if it is determined

that it would be feasible, a referendum is had.
provides no

Our statute

qualifications for the voters except that you

have to be a land owner.
The land owner is defined by the statute as being
one who holds the legal title or is acquiring title by a
contract.

There i3 no qualification as to residence, a non­

resident land owner, one outside of the state, may vote.

A

minor may vote by a guardian, a deceased estate by an
executor, and there is no registration requirement.
Prior to the actual casting of a ballot, the land

9

owner must make an affidavit in which he states the number of
acres he owns.

He then votes.

And the ballots are counted

and in order to pass, the referendum must have voting in
favor of it a majority of the land owners who also represent
a majority of the acres.
So, in effect, the vote is weighted.

Now, then,

after the creation of the district, a board of directors is
elected to operate the district.

There are five of them, and

in order to be nominated, you have to be nominated by ten
land owners.
Upon the creation of the district, the statute
states it constitutes a governmental subdivision in the
state and a public body corporate and politic,

They have the

authority to levy taxes, make assessments, build structures,
accept grants, apportion benefits against irrigated lands.
They also have the authority to submit to the land owners a
proposition for the issuance of the bond.
Once again, only the land owners vote on the bond.
The vote must carry by two-thirds of the land owners voting
and those two-thirds must own a majority of the acreage.

So,

once again you have a weighting of the vote in comparison to
the number of acres owned.
In this particular case, it was argued of course in
the lower courts that the limiting of the voting franchise to
the land owners in the creation and maintenance of a

10

watershed improvement district violates the Fourteenth
Amendment Equal Protection Clause in that it creates an
unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious voting classification.
The second argument was that the weighting of
these votes by requiring a majority of the acreage is a
debasement of the votes of the people resident in the
district and the owners of small acreages.
Our Supreme Court held that while Wyoming has
always recognised the distinction between governmental and
proprietary functions of a legal subdivision and that this
was a legal subdivision, that a watershed improvement
district's

functions are primarily proprietary.

And then

they stated that the appellants in that case would fail to
show that the statute was unconstitutional and that the
classification, the burden showing the classification of
orders, was upon the appellant.
Our court also made the observation that there is
an overreaction to the decisions of this Court, both by
judges and lawyers, that the one-man, one-vote rule has now
been extended to a local specialised unit of government.
the Wyoming Supreme Court rejected the idea that it would
extend the rule to include such a water improvement
district.
Q

What if under Wyoming law a watershed

improvement district was to foe formed on the vote of all

And

II
registered voters within the proposed district?
MR. BURGESSi
Q

Yes .

MR. BURGESS:
Q

What if it were to be?

It

cobId

not be under our statute.

I know, but what if the statute just provided

that?
MR. BURGESS:
Q

I think it would be constitutional.

Why would it?

I do not know why your

corporate lessee should not demand, on the same argument,
the right to vote.
MR. BURGESS:

The corporate lessee in this case

would not have a right to vote if, as the Justice says, it
were upon the basis of an individual voting.
Q

I know they would not.

I said that they

would not have the right to vote under the statute.

But

would the statute be constitutional if it, like the present
one, excltided your corporate lessee from voting?
MR. BURGESS:

My understanding of the law is that

it would be constitutional.
Q

Why cannot the state then exclude it under

this statute?
MR. BURGESS:
Q

Sir?

Why cannot the state exclude your corporate

lessee under this statute?
%

MR. BURGESS:

We contend that it is an unreasonable

12
and capricious exclusion.
Q

I do not know why it would not be under the

other one.

You would have exactly the same interests.
MR. BURGESSs

What we are talking about here, as I

understand it in a sense, is the purpose of an election.

And

running counter and at the same time going along with that
is the question of the qualification of a voter.

I think

that when you vote—
Q

You mean you think you have a case here only

because they proceeded on the basis of land owners being
voters?
MR. BURGESS:
the vote.

And voting the acreage.

You weight

What you are doing is you are voting the number of

acres you own.
0

So, you say, therefore, since they proceed on

the basis of land owners, it is invidious to exclude lessees?
MR. BURGESS:

Right.

What we are talking about,

as I understand previous decisions of this court is people
and certainly not acres or corporations.
In the Cipri&no case you are talking about
striking down a statute which provided for the passage of
sewer bonds.

There is really no difference between this

case and that case, and one case of sewerage is what you are
talking about on a bond issue.

In this case we are trying to

13
Q

Mr, Burgess, who pays the bonds that have

been issued by your district?
MR, BURGESSs

The bonds are paid by the owner of

the land who benefits from the improvements made in the form
a dam and canals and ditches.
In the first instance, that is assessed against the
land owner.

He is the one who has the obligation to pay, the

taxes are collected by the county treasurer.

For failure to

pay the taxes, the lands are sold under the regular laws
relating to delinquency of taxes.
We contend that that payment in the case of a
lessee is passed over to the lessee in increased rents.
Q

Is the assessment based on the number of

acres?
MR. BURGESS:

It is based upon the value of

benefits on certain acres.

For instance, if a total project

would cost $100,000 and there is ten thousand acres, it
would be $10 per acre, would be the assessment.
Q

But the general public has no obligation

directly or indirectly to pay the bonds that are issued by
the district?
MR. BURGESS;
0

Correct.

You referred to a case involving the

issuance of sewer bonds.

Who paid for the interest and

MR. BURGESS;
Q

Property owners.

Only property owners?

MR. BURGESS;

Only property owners.

It is my

understanding that is Cipriano v, City of Houma.
In that, case they are talking about paying for the
bonds for the sewage.

In this ease, we are talking about

paying for the bonds for the purpose of getting the water.
Q

Is it your position that one must have an

interest in land by a lease or otherwise to be entitled to
voto, i or would you suggest that anyone who lived in the
district,, regardless of whether he had an interest in land,
also should be entitled to vote?
MR. BURGESS;

I would respectfully suggest that

anybody in the district has a right to vote.

I think that in

this day and age, the Government being as complex aa it is—
Q

But you do not have to go that far*

MR. BURGESS;

Ho, I do not have to go that f ar.

What is the priority on the use of water in

MR. BURGESS:

But what about if there is a conflict between

domestic consumption and irrigation?
MR. BURGESSs

We go on the doctrine of priority.

We have five preferred uses.

If you have a preferred use

which is subsequent in time to an irrigation right? the
irrigation right prevails.
However? the preferred right can by eminent domain
take the prior use lower on the scale.

It would have to be bought.

MR. BURGESS:

It would have to be purchased by

someone else.
Q

The improvement district does not acquire any

water rights of its own as a result of constructing this
facility? does it?
MR. BURGESS:

That is correct.

You have to file

16

with the state engineer, make a beneficial use of the water,
and then you get a water right.

But this is the facility in

the structure.
Under this the water district could file an
application to construct a dam and get what they call a
primary permit, which would authorise them to impound and
store 'within the dam for the benefit of the members of the
district the x^ater.
Q

But the water it does store in not for its

own benefit as such but simply for tha benefit of its
members?
MR. BURGESS:

Of the members, and it can also be

used for recreation purposes, fishing.
We submit that this is a case which probably was
raised by the dissent of Justice Harlan in which he said 2
believe in the Hadley case that this principle which was
handed down in that case applies to an irrigation district.
And for all the reasons enunciated by this Court in previous
cases, we feel it is only logical that this principle be
applied to the watershed improvement district acts of the
State of Wyoming.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Burgess.

17
ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRED W, PHIFER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR. PHIFERi

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
Possibly to give a little bit more background on
this case, the question that was raised about tenancy and
sufferance was raised in the Wyoming Supreme Court and was
specifically not passed on.

There is no written leas® in

this case, as the interrogatories shew.

This was a working

arrangement between two corporations to use the land.
What is not shown in the record, but I am sure
Mr. Burgess would concede, is that one man its -the primary
stockholder in these two corporations.
a man by the name of Eldon Johnston.

They both belong to
He has several ranches.

As you indicated by the record, Johnston Fuel Liners is a
trucking company which also owns cattle.
Q

And the boards are the same?

MR. PHIFER;

The boards are the same, yes.

There

is some differentiation in some of the minority stockholders
but—
Q

The stockholdings are not the same?

MR. PHIFER:

The stockholdings are not quite the

same but almost the same, Mr. Justice.
Secondly» in Wyoming there is a statute which
specifically provides that you are a tenant at sufferance

18
unless you have a specific written lease»

So, in this case

they are a tenant at sufferance, although the Wyoming Supreme
Court passed over that question when I raised it in ray
brief.
Secondly, with regard to the question on paying for
this, the district as originally formed, as the name would
indicate, on a watershed area, the drainage is all the same»
Then after the district is formed and after they
have decided that it is feasible to build a dam in a certain
location, then only the lands that are benefited below that
dam are assessed.

In other words, not all of the land that

is in the watershed district--much of it is mountainous
area.

This area in particular is an alpine area.

The

lowest elevation, I suppose, in the district would be 6,900
feet, running from there to about 7,200 feet.
arid area.

It is quite an

The dam is on. the North Laramie River, which is

a very small river.

Normally in the middle of the summer you

could step across it in places.
There is a large spring runoff, and it is the
purpose of this type of law in Wyoming to catch the spring
runoff so that it can be used later for irrigation.

The

meadows that are irrigated here will only grow hay, because
of the altitude and the shortness of the growing season.
There probably is 2,000 acres involved belonging to about
12 different families.

19

The production on these meadows is very limited,
again because of the fragility of the soil»
alpine soil^ mostly gravel»

It is very thin

It will produce a half a ton to

i

a ton of hay? with very good cultivation and some fertilizer
it might produce a ton and a half of hay.

Here again it is

not alfalfa, as Mr» Justice White would be familiar with from
his background in northern Colorado, but primarily wild hay»
It has no market»

This area is located about 60 miles from

the nearest town»

The hay is used primarily by the ranchers»

Q

For cattle»

MR. PHIFER;
Q

It is in the vicinity of—

MR» PHIFER;

So, it is in the vicinity of Laramie, Wyoming»

It

Q

It is irrigated pasture then?

MR. PHIFER;
Q

Irrigated meadows?

MR. PHIFER;
Q

hay?

You harvest the hay.

You pick it up.

MR. PHIFER;
Q

Yes.

Of course, you harvest the

MR. PHIFER;
Q

It is irrigated meadows»

You have to have it for winter.

And you bale it?

MR. PHIFER;

Oh, in most part they do not bale it

here, primarily because the meadows are too rough»

20

Q

But you keep the cattle there in the winter?

MR. PHIFER:

Keep the cattle there and feed them

there»
Q

In the winter?

MR. PHIFER:

In the wintertime.

This will provide only supplemental watery inci­

It would not bring any

Here again, to go back to the

question of who pays for this, once this question is decided,
if we are still constitutional, then appraisers are ordered
by the court to go out and appraise the land that will be
benefited, only the land that will bs under ditch.
Wow, the land will be classified by these
appraisers so that some of it will probably pay a little bit
more than others.

But for the total area of the watershed

district itself might be fifteen or twenty thousand acres;
the area that will pay for it is only the area that is
benefited, that would come under, I would say, under 2,000
acres of meadow.
In regard to the question on priority of water
rights in Wyoming, domestic consumption does come first, and
it can at any time condemn any other industrial or
agricultural water
very unlikely.

if it is necessary.

In this case, it is

It is located in a remote area.

There is under the provisions for setting up the

21

watershed law in the first place—Congress enacted specific
legislation making grants in aid to watershed districts to
build these sort of things in the interests of conservation
and particularly in the interests of flood control, and we
have a flood control problem here, nothing that menaces life
but it does cause damage, quite extensive damage, down the
river each year»
They grant about 50 percent of the cost of these
projects as an outright grant.

Then the other half of it is

loaned to the projects by the Farmers Home Administration.
Q

How did this case get started?

MR. PHIFER;

The case got started primarily right

after the district was formed? we asked permission to go on
to Johnston’s land to make a survey to see if the foundation
studies would be proper to build a dam.
Q

I take it Johnston must have voted against the

formation of the district.
MR. PHIFER;

He will obviously go on first.

He voted against the formation of the district,
yes.

Then he allowed us to go on his land and check to see.

Then, as it often happens with government projects, we had
inadequate data.
Q

There were other owners who owned more land

than he did in this?
MR. PHIFER;

Yes.

22
0

So f they outvoted him?

MR0 PHIFER:

Well,, actually the vote-—-there were

only three land owners that voted against it»
about 12 that voted for it«

There were

There are two large land owners

in the area? both of them voted for it.
Q

But, anyway, he got outvoted?

MR. PHIFER:
Q

He got outvoted.

If this lessee is entitled to vote, that is

not going to do any good, because he will have been outvoted
also, except what?

You have to get to the acreage limitation

as well as--.it has to be a nose count rather than an acreage
count.
MR. PHIFER:

I think that based on the decisions in

this Court, all of which are concerned with so-called
popular elections—I am not exactly sure what a popular
election is except that it is where we go into a voting
booth and it is a secret ballot and whether we are voting on
sewage bonds or anything else, it has a particular form to it.
And the decisions of this Court apply to popular elections
and they will stand unless there is invidious discrimination.
In fact, I think there is some language in some
cases of this Court that say once the popular election
process is chosen, then you must do so and so,
Q

How would this election have come out if, in

the first place, the rule had been to count the votes rather

23

■than the acreage?
MR. PHIFER:

It would still have passed, both ways.

But here is the thing.
Q

This is not a popular election.

Let us assume that you lose this suit.

MR. PHIFER:

If we lose this suit, the entire

Wyoming watershed law I think is unconstitutional.

Then

probably we have plans to go back—
Q

I am just asking, is this really a very live

lawsuit?

I beg your pardon?

What interests have the other side got?

10,000 acres to 50 different people.

the time the vote was held.
MR. PHIFER:

Yes, but I think it leaves it open to

Q

If you lose this lawsuit, there will be a new

vote; that is the point.

And you do not know how that is going

to come out.
MR. PHIFER:

We know how? the new vote will come

a majority in acreage both»

Are you going to say that only

lessees can vote and the land owner cannot if there is a
lease?

Or are you going to say both lessees and land owners

can vote?

If that is the case, Mr, Johhston would be allowed

to vote twice in this instance, because he owns the land as
one corporation; he is a lessee as another.
Q

He is a lessor, to put it in the first

instance.

MR. PHIFER;

Going back to this popular election

25
proposition, this is not a popular election»

There is no

secret ballot to start with, because they have to write down
how many acres they have so that we will know when we look at
their names at the counting of the ballots how many acres are
involved»

There is no age limit in this case»

residency requirement»

There is no

in fact, there is not even any

citizenship requirement nor is the vote limited to persons»
h Swiss corporation, if it filed to do business in
Wyoming, could own land and vote in this.

So, it has no

real comparison to a popular election which, to my mind,
distinguishes this from the whole line of cases on one man,
one vote.
Q

If you distinguish the cases where that—say,

there is really no difference between a land owner and a
lessee and there is not enough of a difference between a
land owner and a lessee to warrant excluding the lessee
simply because the land owner has the formal obligation to
pay the bill.
MR. PHIFER;

That is right, because actually, as you

have said in previous cases, the renter or the lessee ends
up paying the bill and increased rent at least

at the next

rent period.
Q

Do you accept that?

MR. PHIFER;

I do accept that, except that I am

afraid that the compelling state interest in this case is to

26

exclude lessees because it would leave the election open to
fraud, and that any land owner that was opposed to it could
bring in enough so-called lessees to entirely control the
election.
Q

But other than that, you have no answer to the

other?
MR. PHIFER:
Q

No, sir.

Mr. Phifer, Justice Powell asked Mr. Burgess

about the case of Cipriano.

Do you read Cipriano the same

way Mr. Burgess does as involving an obligation that was to
be ultimately paid only by property owners?
MR. PHIFER:

No.

I read Cipriano and all the other

cases, once you get into the bond election sort of process.
Everything that this Court had passed on before with regard
to school districts, sewer bonds, and so forth, the benefits
in those cases were such that benefited the entire
community.

Everybody in a sewer district is interested in

sewers, whether they own land and have to pay for the bonds.
Q

Regardless of who pays the bill?

MR. PHIFER:

Regardless of who pays the bill.

Everybody is directly affected by sewage disposal.

It is a

matter again of the health of the whole community.

And like

schools, whether you have children in school or whether you
own property, everyone in the community is directly affected
and directly interested in the benefits to schools.

27
Everyone in the community is not directly interested
nor directly benefited by a watershed district.

This is only

concerned with irrigation water„
I cannot differentiate too much between lessees and
land owners.

But you can certainly differentiate between

people who are summer residents , for instance ■, that would
own a cabin site in the watershed district or are employees
on ranches.

Another way of bodily controlling this election

would be to bring a multitude of employees in just prior to
election and allowing them to vote, because they are located
on the ranches.
Q

Would you not have that same possibility with

one-man, one-vote?

Somebody can go out and bring in a

thousand people.
MR. PHIFER;
Q

Well, here again—

Yes, yes, yes.

MR. PHIFER;

You do, Mr. Justice, up to the point

that they have to support them for about 30 days, 1 believe,
now under your—
Q

What prevents you from putting a residence

requirement?
MR. PHIFER;
Q

A residency requirement in here?

Yes.

MR. PHIFER;

Well, I think that it would be

unconstitutional to make a residency requirement here,

28
because here we go back to the matter of discrimination.

Is

the class which is excluded more directly interested in the
results than the class which is included?

And in this case ,

if you put a residency requirement in* all the corporations
that owned lands would be non-residents.
Q

All this man says is to let the lessee vote.

He does not say that the lessee that comes in today votes or
anything.
MR. PHIFER%

Mo, but the only alternative, I think,

to the present system, is a system that would put it back on
the old residency requirement.
Q

Do you know of any lessor who pays taxes

himself?
MR. PHIFER;
Q

Lessor?

Yes.

MR. PHIFERs

In our areas, yes, sir.

the taxes directly themselves.

They all pay

Generally speaking, the

leases—
Q

I mean, if you have got a lessor and a lessee,

who pays the tax?
MR. PHIFER;

Q

Well—

I know who signs the check, but who pays the

tax?
MR. PHIFER;

Of course, ultimately it goes back to

who is paying the bill, and the renters do.

29
Q

How many people are in this district?

MR. PHIFERs
Q

Probably 12 families.

What is wrong with letting 12 people vote?

MR. PHIFERs

Not a thingf except that they are not

the people who are directly interested in the election.
land owners are.

The

There are quite a few land owners who do

not live in this area.

For instance

,

neither one of the

corporations here actually headquarter here.

They 'would not

be classified as residents.
Q

But you said the difference between this and

the ether cases is that it is for the benefit of all the
people in the district.
MR. PHIFERs
benefit.

Yes.

The other cases are for the

I think service or bonds or bond issues—
Q

Is this net of interest to all of the people

in the district?
MR. PHIFERs

No„ sir.

It is only of interest to

the people who own or lease irrigated land.

It is not of any

interest to summer people, except for the remote possibilities
of fishing.
Q

Suppose there is a sewer for 12 families.

Would that be different?
MR. PHIFERs
Q

I beg your pardon?

A sewer, 12 farms.

MR. PHIFERs

That would make a great deal of

30
difference.

Because even if you are a ranch-hand, you are

interested in that.
Q

X do not see the great trouble with letting

12 people vote.
MR, PHIFER2

I think that if you limited it, again

as 2 said, to residents, then you would foe excluding a great
number of land owners who are directly interested in this,
and I think then it would be unconstitutional.
Q
against fraud.

I am only saying that you want to protect them
You are out her© bringing the thousand

people in here with leases.
MR. PHIFEEs

That is not in this case at all.

If lessees were allowed to vote and

if Johnston Fuel Liners is classified as a lessee when it has
no lease—
Q

Suppose you said bona fide lessee.

MR. PHIFER?

Bona fide lessees,again you can make

out 50 leases in an afternoon.

I think that a lessee's

interest is not different than the land owner’s.

I think

they both have a commonality of purpose in irrigation
ditches, so that they are not going to be voting at odds.
I think also that it is not fair for a lessee who
may be a tenant at sufferance or at least for a term of years
to be allowed to come in and push through a large expensive
project.

The payoff on this is estimated at 50 years.

And he

may be there a year or two and pull out and leave the landlord

31
with a three and a half or four dollar a year assessment to
pay on this project.
I agree that it does not seem on the surface to be
fair, except that you have t© draw the line somewhere.

And

7. think that it is more fair to draw the line against
lessees than it would be to set up a residency requirement
and draw the line against non-resident land owners who have a
very direct interest in both the benefits and the costs of
this project.
Secondly, 1 really believe this is not again a
matter of a governmental-Q

Do you 'think anybody could be persuaded to go

up in the backwoods of Wyoming and just stay there for the
purpose of voting?
MR. PHIFERS

Wo, I do not think so.

I am

differentiating here again, Mr. Justice, between—if the
lessees—•
Q

It depends on how good the fishing may be.

MR. PHIFER:

Yes.

Here again the lessees would not

have to come up her© if lessees were allowed to vote without
a residency requirement.

If there is a residency requirement,

I am not worried about fraud, because I do not think they are
going to move lessees into the area and make them stay there
a month to fulfill, let us say, a fractional residency
requirement.

It is a pretty remote and cold area.

32

But I do think that then you are probably
excluding a great many people who are directly interested in
the thing, that are non-residents or even non-citizens, nonpersons , as these corporations are, who should be allowed to
vote in it, I do not think you could devise a fairer system,
I do not believe there is any injustice here; no large land
owner can force through a vote on his small neighbors,
because it has to pass by a majority of the people.
Conversely, no group of small land owners could
come in and force a project against one large land owner
who would have the burden of paying for it, because it must
pass by a majority of the acreage.

And limiting it to land

owners, here again is the only logical way that it can be
done, I think.
Here again, I think this should be differentiated
from a governmental unit.

It is a governmental entity.

it exercises no sovereign power over the people.

But

It is more

in the nature of a quasi-private organisation or quaispublic.

It has the power to levy and collect assessments,

which almost any mutual company would have.

It has the power

to buy and sell real estate and personal property, and the
power to borrow money and sell bonds, which any private
corporation can do.

It does have the power to receive

government grants and loans, and I think the Lockheed
Corporation has that power also evidently.

And it has the

33

power of eminent domain.

There seems to be in counsel's

brief a great distinction made because of this granting of
power of eminent domain.
Every public utility has the power of eminent
domain.

So, I think this thing has much more in common with

private corporations than it does with any public
governmental entity.
Q

I know you were contrasting the situation

here with what you called a popular election and as you
rightly said, in a popular election generally there is a
vote and a polling place by secret ballot by individual
voters.

Since so many of these voters are corporations, how

is the vote taken?

Is it public?

Is it just done by

letter or how?
MR. PHIFER:

No, we have a meeting and they come in

and vote.
Q

Individual representatives of corporations?

MR. PIIIFER:

Individual representatives of the

corporations.
Q

Who, if questioned, show their authority to

represent the corporation.
MR. PHIFER:

Yes.

Of course, in this instance, this

is a small community; there is no question about who is the
owner of the corporation.
is no question.

He just comes in and votes; thex*e

And, of course, only one man would be

34
allowed to»
Q

But it is a public meeting?

MR. PHIFER:

Yes, it is an open meeting and there

is quite an involved due notice requirement here.

Every time

anything is done by this thing, by the watershed district,
due notice must be given and it must be posted at four or
five places prominent in the district, which is kind of hard
to do when the ranches are ten miles apart.
on the bridge post.

They post them

And it has to be advertised in the

newspaper in the area for three weeks, I think, prior to
that time.

So, there is good notice given.
Not only that, but because we anticipated that

there would be problems in the first place, we always sent
certified letters to every one of the voters, giving them due
notice of any elections.
Q

Actual notice by mail?

MR. PHIFER:
Q

Yes.

Mr. Phifer, where are these bonds marketed?

MR. PHIFER:

They only have one market, and that

is the United States Government.

The bonds as such are

merely security for the obligation under the FIIA loans.

It

would be interesting to see how they would foreclose on those
bonds if they had to, since almost all of the land involved
was privately mortgaged to insurance companies or to the
State of Wyoming prior to this time.

So, the bonds are an

35
overriding obligation on the watershed district, and they
would have quite a time collecting on them.
Q

Are they subordinate to the private debt?

MR. PHIFER:

They are really not a private debt.

They are a. debt of the watershed district itself, and the land
under assessment is of course subject to liens for assessment
and it might be subject to foreclosure by these.

But I think

the Government would have to step in and pay off a lot of.
insurance company loans before they could do it.

It is not

spelled out very well.
Q

How do you know that these assessments and the

liens they represent are subordinate to the private liens,
does the statute say so?
MR. PHIFER:
Q

Has it been adjudicated?

MR. PHIFER:
Q

No, the statute does not say so.

No, it has not been adjudicated.

Certainly this would not be true of an

ordinary tax lien?
MR. PHIFER:

I am sorry, I think you are right.

It would not be subordinate.
subordinate.
bond.

But the assessments are not

But the assessments do not represent the

The assessments are merely assessments made by the

district to help pay the bills of the district, and it could
not only be bonds but improvements in everything else, and
the assessments are an obligation owing to the district from

36

the land owner.

There is no other obligation from the

district fco the Federal Government for the loan except the
bonds.

And what their priority is, I have no idea.
Q

But occasionally one recalls, at least, cases

where the bond owner has sought an action against the
issuer to make the issuer take such action as it can by a
marshaling of assets to collect funds that may be available
to it but not directly to the bond owner,

I take it that if

a land owner fails to pay an assessment made by this district,
the district has the power to have the property sold to pay
the assessment under Wyoming lav?,
MR. PHIFER;

That is right.

Here again I do not

know what the priority of that would be.
Q

Prior to the insurance company lien, I would

think.
MR. PHIFER:

Yes, might be.

Thank you, gentlemen.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, Mr. Phifer.

Mr. Burgess, you have got about nine minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF HENRY A. BURGESS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. BURGESS;

Mr. Chief Justice and Court:

Several observations I would make.

One of them is

that I think we got a little bit outside of the record here
in discussing this district.

The fact of the matter is there

37
is some gerrymandering that went on here»

Johnston Fuel

Liners does have a number of employees who do reside in the
district»

Of course, they are not allowed to vote»
The site for their propsed dam would take in and

destroy much of the land of Associated Enterprises who, in
turn, have upstream dams»
Q

And what we are talking about—

You are pretty well outside the record too»

MR» BURGESS:

I will stop it, Your Honor, if you

do not believe it should go on»
people did not decide this»
land owners»

But the point is that the

It was said it was two big

And they voted the acreage»

That is how we are

here.
This business of voting, I can't visualize, as one
of the Justices said, anybody moving to the Laramie Peak
country with a lease just to vote.

And I am sure every

election case, which is brought before this Court has thrown
out to it this bugaboo about fraud and election»
problem in a small community like Wyoming.
we all think we are honest.

That is no

In the first place,

Secondly, the people come in and

they are pretty well known to their neighbors, and they are
there.
When you get all through looking at this case, I
think that historically these cases started on the quesion
of voting for a Congressman.

Then it got over to the voting

of a school trustee„ and then the county commissioner.

And

38
you keep going down and down and down into this spectrum of
local self-government»

And we contend that this principle

should also be extended into the lower unit of this
particular water improvement district.
Q

Your colleague said that the question of the

tenancy at sufferance was presented to the Wyoming Supreme
Court and was not decided.

It was passed by by them, which

I take it means that it would not make any difference to the
Wyoming Supreme Court in terms of its rationale, if this
were a wholly independent lessee with a lease for ten years.
MR. BURGES5: Correct.
individual.

Or even if it were an

And I would just like to point that out.

The

thing that this case™
Q

There are only 12 people involved?

MR. BURGESS:
voted for it»

I think there may be 12 families that

I am not sure of the exact vote.

three who voted against it, as I understand it,

There were
But there are

no families above the upper limit which are interested in
this, and of course they were not brought in.

If this is a

live issue in the community, it is a very live issues.
Q

Are those families up there lessees or land

owners?
MR. BURGESS:
Q

Both.

Will the land owners be allowed to vote?

MR. BURGESS:

Certainly they should be allowed to

39
vote.

But they weren‘t0

They weren0t even put into the

proposed boundary»
Q

Is that raised in this?.

MR. BURGESS:
Q

In this case there are 12 families involved?

MR. BURGESS:
Q

No.

Correct.

Why do you call this an election.

Everybody

sits around a living room and talks about something.
MR. BURGESS:

That is correct.

That is probably

what it was.
Q

That is an election?

MR. BURGESS:

Well, that is for this Court to

determine.
Q

If it was not called an election, would you

have any case?
MR. BURGESS:

I suppose not, except it is a

governmental and political subdivision of the state.
Q

That is right.

MR. BURGESS:

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 11:47 o'clock a.m. the case
was submitted.]
