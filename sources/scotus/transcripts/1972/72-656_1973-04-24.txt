Ml. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first today in 72-656, Logue against United States*
Mr. DeAnda.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMS DE AMM, ESQ., OK BEHALF
OF PETITIONERS
MR. DE ANDA:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This is a case arising under the Federal Court of
Claims Act resulting from the suicidal death of a Federal
prisoner confined in a State facility.
The District Court, in this instance, found both the
marshal-

and the sheriff, the State official involved, negligent,

found the marshal . negligent in not making arrangements for
constant surveillance of the deceased and found the sheriff
negligent for making inadequate — for having inadequate sur­
veillance procedures.
The Circuit Court approved the findings of the trial
court, but held that insofar as the marshal's
concerned that the marshal

negligence was

had no authority to control jail

functions and, therefore no duty of safekeeping of the prisoner,
and that Insofar as the sheriff was concerned that he was an
independent contractor,as defined under the Tort Claims Act,
and, therefore, the Government had no liability for his conduct.
Which brings us to the issue in the case, which is

4
whether or not the United States may exempt itself from liability
under the Federal Tort Claims Act for a negligent injury to a
prisoner by simply turning him over to a local jail*
This is extremely important because if this were the
law, first of all, you would have two standards, insofar as
persons in detainment are concerned; that is, Federal prisoners
in non**Federa! institutions would not have the benefit of the
Tort Claims Act remedies, nor would they have the rights of the
protection afforded by Section 40-42 and 40-86, which requires
the Bureau of Prisons to safely keep the prisoner and requires
the U.S. marshal . to safely keep his prisoners.
It would also result in a situation where actually,
in the usual case, where a man has been convicted of a crime
and is confined in a Federal institution has really more rights
than one who is simply charged with a crime and has not yet been
tried, because X believe the statistics show, that are in the
record in this case, the persons that are confined in State
institutions for the most part are persons who have not yet been
convicted of crimes.
As a matter of fact, I believe, the record was that
there were approximately 4,000 Federal prisoners in any one day
that are confined in State institutions of various types, and
for the most part, are waiting trial on different offenses.
The dissenting — there was a motion for a hearing
en oanc before the Circuit:, which was denied by the Circuit, out

5
there was a dissent: filed in that matter,and the nasis of the
dissent %as that the breach of the statutory duty on the part
of the marshal., occurred when the prisoner was confined in the
jail under circumstances that the marshal

knew were dangerous

and without taking specific precautions.
In other words, the dissent stated that really whether
or not the -- that this contract between the Government and the
Nueces County jail was really irrelevant, and that the marshal
himself was guilty of acts of negligence in taking this man
and turning him over to the sheriff of Hueces County without
making assurances that he would be cared for,knowing the very
peculiar and special circumstances that surrounded the case,
Q

Hr. DeAnda, would that oe negligence in selecting the

contractor, basically?
MR. DE ANDA:

No, sir, I don't believe — Mr. Justice,

I do not believe that negligence would be in selecting the
contractor. The negligence would be in — and the negligence
that the court found was in not ranking arrangements for the man
to — the arrangements that were necessary under the record to
keep the man safely.

That is, the marshal,

for example,

even

though he took the man into jail could have -- just as they
had a guard for him at the hospital after his first suicide
effort, could have had a guard for him to watch him and maintain
constant observation while the man was in jail.
Although the Government places a great deal of weight

b

on the inability of the marshal

to control things in the jail,

the truth of the matter is that everything that occurred in that
jail, when this man was returned, was done so with the blessings
and at the suggestion of the marshal..
Everything that the jailer did, the type of cell that
the man was put in, was all done because the marshal

wanted

it done that way, and the contract between the Government; and
the jail permits this.
There is real pressure in my mind that there is any­

thing approaching an infinite contractor situation here -In a situation of this type,because the regulations of the
Bureau of Prisons, as shown in the transcript, really leave it
up to the marshal

when a particular or unusual situation

occurs, specifically, either a medical situation or one
involving custodial problems that’s not the run of the mill case
where the sheriff is just simply babysitting with somebody that’s
in jail and charged with a crime, that he is to call the marshal
and find out what the marshal

wants done with, the man and how

he wants a particular situation handled.
Q

Well, is this an argument that even if the State

official — the relationship between the United States and the
State jail or prison was one of independent contractor, even if
it was, that under these circumstances it was negligent for the
marshal

to have lodged the man there without first making

certain that whatever the independent contractor did he did to

7
safeguard this fellow from committing — attempting suicide
again,

Is that it?
HR, DE AIIDA:

Yes, Your Honor, that’s exactly my

position.
In other words, in this particular case, the man
was removed from the hospital over the protests of the doctors.
How, the doctor did release the man, but he released the man
because he thought he had been ordered to do so by a Federal
judge.
That was the circumstances under which the man was
released from jail.

He was psychotic when he went in.

was psychotic when he went out.

He

There had been absolutely no

improvement or change in the prisoner’s condition, psychiatric»
ally, from the time he was put in jail to the time he was
taken out.

I am sorry -- in the hospital, Mr. Justice.
The medical testimony is that the man's condition,

mental condition, was exactly the same,

He had been placed

under some sort of drug treatment and had been administered
some medication which did help,
Q

Did the marshal

have any choice but,when he was re­

leased from the hospital, to put him in this very jail?
MR. DE AHDA:

Oh, yes, he had every choice in the

world.
Q

What could he have done?
121.. DE AKBA:

He could have left him in the hospital.

He coaid have been moved within 24 hours, according to -in an emergency situation.
In fact, the Federal judge had already ordered that
the man be confined in a medical facility, and he was returned
to the jail awaiting transfer, to Springfield, I believe, while
someone came to get him.
Q

But, locally, were the choices either to leave him

in the hospital or put him in this jail?
option?

Did he have any other

The marshal.
MR. DE AHDA:

Mr, Justice.
to put him,

I do not uelieve he would have,

I guess he could have put him anywhere he wanted
I would suppose.

But I do not believe that, from

a realistic standpoint, I think his responses would have oeen
Q

--

Well, there did exist a contract with this jail to take

these Federal prisoners, didn’t there?
ME. DE AMDA:

Yes, the jail had a contract to accept

Federal prisoners.
Q

Well, then, that did rather limit the marshall’s

options, did it not?
MR. DE AKJDA:

Well, it would limit him either to the

-- well, that’s what I said.
that that's correct.
Q

I think from a practical standpoint

It may be from a legal standpoint as well.

You are saying then the specific conduct of this

Federal marshall in these circumstances was itself negligence?
MR. DE AHDA:

Yes, Mr. Justice, in taking —

9
Q

This could oe true even if the conduct of the jailer,

into whose custody he delivered the man, was not negligent.

MR. i>E ANBA:
Q

This would be true.

And is it true in this case?
MR, DE ANDA:

Mo, it is not, because — the reason it

is not was the trial court found that it wasn't.

He found that

both were negligent in the matter.
Q
marshal,,

But absent this conduct of this particular Federal
you aren't asserting that the United States would

automatically be liable just because the jailer was negligent,
are you?
MR. DE AMDA:

Yes, that would be my second position,

Mr. Justice, that — this is what I think we are talking about
non-delegable duties, which I haven't discussed yet — but, in
other words, it is our position that the statute places a
mandatory duty on the marshal

to safely keep his prisoner,

and that he cannot delegate that -•
Q

But you don't need to get to that if the marshal's

specific conduct here was negligent in itself?
MR. BE AKBA:

I believe that's correct, Mr. Justice,

that you would not necessarily reach that point if we were
correct in what 1 have said here.

And the trial court did

find -» the trial court found that the marshal
Q

—

Himself was negligent?
MR. DE AHDA:

Himself was negligent in not making

10
arrangements for constant surveillance of the man.
Q

What did the District Court find with respect to the

marshal’s

decision to move him from the hospital to the local

jail?

Ml, BE AfflDA:

The court ..found that that was a

discretionary function and we did not appeal from that finding,,
Your Honor,
Q

Discretionary function for which there could be no

liability on the .part of the United States.
MR, BE

AM>A:

Under the Tort Claims Act.

Yes, he found that.
But, he did find that the marshal.,

having made that

discretionary decision, that then he had a duty to see that
proper arrangements were made, wherever he took the man, to see
that he was safely kept, in keeping — that he had a duty of
reasonable care, to see that the man was properly taken care of
and the marshal

admits in his testimony, the marshal

testified, the deputy marshals.

that

The United States Marshal

did not testify and had no actual knowledge of what transpired.
But the people there admitted that it would have seen wrong and
unsafe to take this man and place him in jail without constant
surveillance.
Q

Absent some affirmative conduct by the marshal',

though, your two positions then really run. together, that the
marshal

-*» that the United States, nor the marshal,

could do

11
its duty unless it participated in. the custody of this prisoner
after lie was delivered to this jailer?
MK,„ DE ANDA:

Well, it is our position, Your Honor,

that under the contract and under the practices that were
followed, as reflected by this record, that the marshal

did

have a great deal to say with reference to the keeping of the
man and the conditions under which he was kept ..
Q

Mr. De Anda, I’d rather understood your alternative

position to be this: the District Court found that Deputy
Sowers was negligent, in that he failed to make adequate
specific arrangements, specific arrangements for the care and
surveillance of the decedent in the jail, and that was met in
the Court of Appeals by the finding that he had no power to
make any such specific arrangements for the surveillance inside
the jail.
And I thought that if one should accept that holding
of the Court of Appeals, that,in fact, the marshal

had no

power whatsoever to control or to arrange or to provide for the
proper kind of surveillance in the jail, then, indeed, it was
negligence for him to turn him over to the jail.
IE. BE ANDA:
Q

Your Honor -~

To a situation where he had no control over the

proper kind of surveillance that the man was going to be given*
MR. DE ANDA:
out that the marshal

Your Honor, the Circuit Court points
had no authority over the internal

12
operations of the jail, and in the ordinary case, certainly,
that is true.
Q

And if that's true, then wasn’t it negligence, in

your submission, trying to turn him over to a jail where he
had no control over what was going to happen inside of it?
M&. DE ANDA:

Yes, it is my position, Your Honor,

that he did have a duty, knowing the man’s propensity for
suicide, that he could not just take him over and turn him over
to soffseone — it would be just like Judge Brown said, in his
dissent, “If this man was physically ill and was dying, Lie
couldn’t just take him down to the jail and throw him in there
and say that lie did no wrong because it was not a hospital and
he had no right to convert it to a hospital."
There is a place where the marshal

still has the

duty and the control of the prisoner and the absolute control
of the prisoner.

And that was in this instance, certainly,up

until he returned him to the jail without, I may add, the
jailer testified that all the marshal

told him to do was to

keep an eye on the prisoner, or words to that effect, rather
than a constant surveillance.
And the record also shows that the cell that the
marshal

selected was an isolation cell which was not surrounded

by bars, as you might expect, but was rather a sheet metal steel
cell through which holes had been punched the siso of a half
dollar, and which t:as in a solitary area of the Jail, and

13
surrounded by wire mesh enclosure, to boot.
So that no one could really keep an eye on this man
except the jailer when he made his rounds.

And this is what

the jailer testified and what the court accepted, nscause it
found that the marshal

made no arrangements for the constant

surveillance of the man, insofar as the situation in which the
man was placed in this particular custodial type situation.
Q

If he did have power to make the arrangements, he

was negligent, on your submission, in not making the proper
arrangements.

And that's what the District Court found.

If, on the other hand, as the Court of Appeals found,
he did not have any power to influence what arrangements were
made inside the jail, then he was negligent in putting this
man, knowing his condition and his propensity to commit suicide,
into that jail which he had no power to control.
alternatively?

Is that it,

At least on this branch of the case.

I know

there are other branches of it.
MR. DE ANDA:
Q

That would be a way of putting it, yes.

Well, isn’t your answer to Justice Stewart’s second

question another way of saying the non-delegable duty?
MR. DE ASfDA:

The non-delegable duty phase of it

comes in, Fir. Justice, when you have a situation — I believe
Judge Brown pointed it out in.his decision -- in his opinion,
excuse me — where the marshal

lias a specific statutory

duty and he lias a set of circumstances that he recognises to be

14
ultra"dangerous, unusual.

That in that situation 1 believe the

judge stated that the jailer, in effect, becomes an employee of
the Government for purposes of the Tort Claims Act.
words, that in accordance with the general
contract someone to perform

Tn other

law, you cfennot

certainly this is the law of

Texas ~~ that you cannot perform -- contract someone to perform
a statuto^ duty that, you have, and then when that person does
not perform it,or performs it in a negligent manner, and «reaches
a duty, that at that time you can say, well, this man was an
independent contractor and X have no — it is not my problem
any more.
That duty remains with the person upon whom it is
imposed until it is carried out,
Q

Mr, De Anda, what does your position leave of the

statuto, Section 2671, which reads, with some omissions, "As
used in this chapter," as used in this Title?

The term "Federal

Agency" does not include any contractor with the United States.
If doesn't leave very much of it, does it?
MR, DE AKDA:

Hell, Your Honor, if it were not a non­

delegable duty, Mr. Chief Justice —
Q
duties?

Where does the statute speak about the non-delegable
What section?
MR. DE ANDA:

Well, there is nothing in the statute

that speaks of non-delegable duties, any more than there is any­
thing in that statute that says that the aarr oal

has duty to

15
certainly keep the prisoner
«- by this contract

it has been abrogated by the

at least by the marshal's

right to

contract with the State authorities to keep the prisoners.
Q

What would be the situation if this man had committed

suicide while in the hospital?

Was the hospital a contractor

with the United States?
Ml, BE ANDA:

Well, Your Honor, the man was in the

hospital, and at that time the marshal
is no question at that time the marshal

had taken over.

There

was paying guards

around the clock while he was in the psychiatric ward to
take care of the man, except that he was only in there for
about a day, or perhaps a little less.
But, in that situation, if there were any negligence
involved -- and, of course, you would always have to have
negligence.

If there were any negligence involved, then, o£

course, I believe that the Government would be liable.
Q

That is, for example, if they had put him in the

hospital and just dropped the matter there, you then might
argue that that would be negligence in and of itself?
MR. DE ANDA:

I don’t believe there was any absolute

■*» the Government is not an insurer of this man’s safety.
The Government is required to use reasonable care under the
circumstances to see that he is safely kept.
If taking him into the psychiatric ward of the
hospital and providing him with physicians and other custodial

16
people to take care of him, would be considered reasonable care,
why then the Government would have discharged its duty, and the
man’s suicide then would have been just an unfortunate thing.
Q

Uh&fc is your practical situation in Texas insofar

as a lawsuit against the county is concerned?
DE AMM:

Testas

has passed a Tort Claims Act,

but it does not encompass within it -« if would not take care
of this situation.
Your Honor, I feel that there is a -« that this esse,
as it stands, and as our brief indicates, conflicts with the
Witt case, which is a Second Circuit case, in this sensei this
was not a

there was no written contract between the military

custodian and the contractor involved in that case.
This was a situation where the persons in custody of
the military barracks were farmed out, so to speak, to do work
for a private club, there in the vicinity, and the

• one of the

prisoners was injured through the negligence of the — through
the negligence of the contractor, and the Government tried to
escape liability in that situation by claiming that the con­
tractor was not an employee of the Government.
And the Circuit Court held in that case that there
was a duty on the part of the custodian -*» the Government
custodian — to control and employ the offenders in his care
and the fact that he was being transported back and forth by e
private individual did not permit the Government to escape that

17
responsibility, and held that the Government would have to
answer for liability in that particular case.
Is there any other question?
Q

I would be interested in your comment about the

Government's suggestion as between Deputy Bowers and Deputy
Jones.

As I understand, there were two involved.
And X think the Government's argument is that

whatever Bowers did or did not do, that Jones made up for it
with specific and definitive instructions to the jailer.

Do

you have any comment about that?
MR. BE AWDA:

Well, Your Honor, of course, both

these men are marshals.
I do not believe that the record supports this
position, really, because the jailer testified that he did
talk, to Mr. Jones.

This situation was a three-way situation
«

where Mr. Jones, the Chief Deputy, was talking to the jailer
and Mr, Bowers, the Deputy on the ground, was talking to his
immediate superior.
.*

But the marshals

*..4

~~ there is a conflict in the

testimony of Chief Marshal Jones and that of Mr. Lawrence,
the county jailer, in that the county jailer testified that the
only instructions lie got were to keep an eye on the prisoner,
to watch out for him, this type of language.
I think that the very important point *»« and the
Trial Court resolved that issue against the Government, because

18
the Trial Court found that it made no such arrangements, as
did the Circuit Court.
But the important thing, and the reason that they
found this, I believe, Your Honor, is that Mr. Bowers, after
talking to Mr. Jones, went to the jail and examined this place
where this man was to be lodged

and approved everything.

There was only, incidentally, one bunk in the cell,
so that common sense dictates that the marshal knew there would
be no one in there with this man, that he was going to be
isolated in this cell by himself.
Q

Does the record show how the suicide was committed?
I®. BE AHDA:

He hung himself.

He had tried to commit

suicide the day before,on the 23rd, Mr. Justice, by cutting his
wrist.

He was taken to the hospital and a long bandage was

applied to his arm to close that wound.
Q

He used the bandage?
Ml. DE AMDA:

Q

I beg your pardon?

He used the bandage?
MR. DE AHDA:

Yes, he used the bandage.

The cell was so fixed that it had these holes
everywhere, on the ceiling and on the sides, and all he had
to do, of course, was to affix the bandage to one of the holes.
It was in that way that he used the bandage to hang
himself.
Q

It was a KerXix bandage, whatever that means.
«

19
MR. DE AMDA:

Kerlix.

It was a very long bandage.

The doctors testified that the bandage would not have been
dangerous in the hospital because he was under medication,
he was in a room where he could not hurt himself.

But, appar­

ently, when the bandage was applied, it was not contemplated
that he would be removed to the jail.
Q

Of course, suicides take place in hospitals, too.
I take it you are not pinning your case on the

removal to the jail.
MR. DE AMBA;

You regard this as a discretionary act?
Yes, Your Honor.

He have to live with

that position.
I believe the marshal testified the suicides — or
attempted suicides were the chief cause of hospitalisation
among Federal prisoners in

-- awaiting trial in State facilities

I believe there is something in the record on that.
But there is no indication or inkling in the record
anywhere that this man could have successfully taken his life
had he remained in the hospital.
I don’t believe anyone does take that position at
all.
If there are no other questions, thank you.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Mr. Evans,

Very well.

20

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK L, EVANS, ESQ., ON BEHALF
OF THE RESPONDENT
1, EVANS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The Government’s position, simply stated, is this.
First, although the United States would be liable under the
Federal Tort Claims Act for injury to a Federal prisoner caused
by the negligence of a Federal marshal, the deputy marshals here
acted reasonably In accord with due care and they violated no
duty owed to Reagan Logue.
Second, because the United States had no right to
control the physical conduct of the jailers employed by the
county jail, the Government cannot be liable under the Tort
Claims Act for injury resulting from the negligent conduct of
those eraployees,
I think in light of Mr. DeAnda’s argument, that it
might be fruitful to start with a focus on the precise findings
that the District Court made with respect to both of these
points.
They appear in Volume 2 of the Appendix, at pages
608 and 609.
The important point to make, X think, is that Che
only Federal officer whom the District Court found to be
negligent was Deputy Bowers.
scene in Corpus Christi.

That is the deputy who was on the

And his negligence, in the Court’s view,

21
consisted solely of failing to make “specific arrangements"
for Logue*s surveillance while he was confined to the jail.
There is no finding that Sowers was negligent in
removing Logue from the hospital.

And, as Mr. DeAnda stated

here, the District Court found that to be a discretionary act
and that matter was not argued on appeal.
Moreover, there is no finding that any other Federal
officer was negligent in any way.
Q

What page are you reading?
MR. EVANS:

Q

This is page 608 and 609 of Volume 2.

Thank you.
MR. EVANS:

Second, at the top of page 609, the

District Court found that the jail’s employees were negligent
in failing to provide adequate surveillance while Logue was
confined in the jail.
The Court of Appeals did not disturb the District
Court’s findings of fact.

That is, it did not disagree that

Bowers had failed to make specific arrangements for Logue*s
surveillance.

If held, however, that in the circumstances

of this ease, that failure did not violate any duty owed to
Logue.
In our view, the record fully supports this holding
because it shows that the specific arrangements for Logue’s
surveillance, that is the arrangements that Bowers failed,
personally, to make were, in fact, made by Bowers supervisor,

22

Deputy Jones.
I think a little background might be helpful.
Q

Do you think there would have been a duty then for

the Federal Government to have made some arrangements when they
delivered the prisoner to the jail?
MR. EVANS:

I think that knowing that a man is

imminently suicidal, as they did here, that they had a duty to
take precautions to insure that he did not commit suicide while
he was in the jail.
Q

Yes,

And they had at least a duty to say enough to

the contractee.
MR. EVANS:
Q

That's right.

If you are saying that having a contractee insulates

the United States from liability for the contractee, you are
not saying that the United States must not tell the contractee
what his duty is.
MR. EVANS:

q

That’s right.

There is no question the marshal knew he had this

bandage *
MR. EVANS:

It is not,clear, from the record, whether

the marshal was aware of the type of bandage that had been
placed on the man’s ami.
Q

Well, didn’t he see it?
MR. EVANS:

Well, he saw it, but, you know, the

bandage -- it could have been, so far as it can be told from the

23

record, that it wasn't clear whether it was a gauze with tape,
or whether it was a wrap-around bandage, as, in fact, it was,
Q

But he did see it was a bandage.
Ml. EVANS:

He knew there was a bandage on the arm,

yes.
Q

And he saw the room lie was put in?
MR. EVANS:

Q

And there is no question about that?
MR. EVANS:

Q

Yes, he did.

That's right.

Is there any question that he could have left him

in the hospital?
MR. EVANS:

He could have left him in the hospital.

The decision was made to remove him from the hospital because
of the lapse of time that would be necessary to -- before he
could be transported to the Springfield, Missouri, Medical
Center for Federal Prisoners, where the District Court in Laredo
had ordered him to be sent, or was about to order him to be sent.
The order had not yet been signed when he had been removed
from the hospital.
Q

The record shows Chat he was in a hospital. —

And so, what £he marshal did was in between the

transfer from one hospital to another he puts him in a jail,
Is that right?
Ml. EVANS:
Q

That’s correct, Mr, Justice.

Does that make any sense at all?
MR. EVANS:

In the context of this case, it does.

The marshal was very conscientious ; the deputy on
the scene. Deputy Bowers was very conscientious to find out the
purpose of Mr. Logic1s confinement — hospitalization.

He

discussed it both with the admitting physician, and with the
physician who took over the case, the psychiatrist.
And the information he was given was that the man
was hospitalized because he was suicidal and there was some
danger that he might hurt himself.
He was not any longer hospitalised for any physical
or medical treatment purposes.

25

At that point3 the question came up when there was
going to be a lapse of ttoe,before he was to be transferred to
Springfield, what to do with, him in the meantime.
The marshal on the scene. Deputy Bowers, was concerned
that the security at the hospital was inadequate, and he
communicated that concern to his superior.
His superior said, well, let's seo if we can make
some kind of safe arrangements with the jail.

And if we can

~~ and if the doctor will release him, let's move him to the
jail.
Q

Was there any prohibition of the marshals giving

him the necessary protection in the hospital?
MR. EVANS:

There was a guard, full-time, while

Mr. Logue was in the hospital, but I must add that the record
shows that what the marshals refer to as "key control" was
very loose, and, of course, a man in a psychotic state,it is
not inconceivable he could overtake a single guard.
The kind of surveillance

-» the man was sitting

outside the room, as I understand it.

There was a window to

the room, and every now and again he*d look, but — if you
have a situation where key control is loose, where a man is
psychotic, there is always the chance that he can be overtaken.
The judgment, as 1 understand it, of the marshal's
superiors,was that where the security was inadequate, it would
be best, if possible, and if the doctor would release the man,

26
to put hia back in the jail.
Q

Primary responsibility was to make sure ha was held

and not his health?

ML!» EVANS:

Ho.

The principle point «■» and the

marshals reiterated this during the trials was the man’s
health and safety.
Q

Health and safety and put him in a hole like that?
MR. EVANS:

Well, the point was that there was no

need for hita to be in the hospital save to protect himself from
injuring himself, and the marshals had, I think, reasonably
assured themselves that he would be protected against injuring
himself if he were placed back in the jail.

There was no other

need for him to be in the hospital.
Q

Didn’t the District Court review all that and hold,

in fact, made a finding and a conclusion, that even if it was
a mistake in judgment, it was a mistake in judgment under the
discretionary provisions of the Federal Tort Claims Act for
which there could be no liability?
MR. EVANS:
Q

That's exactly right, Mr. Chief Justice.

And I understood Mr. BeAnda to concede that that's

out of the case because he did not file a cross-petition.
MR. EVANS:
Q

I understood him to say the same tiling.

And that leads to what?

By doing so, the marshal took

on the additional responsibility of seeing that the man. did not

27

e ornrni t s uic ide.
HR. EVANS:

That*a right.

As I was suggesting before,

I think that the marshals did undertake that duty and did
satisfy it.

It turned out that they didn’t foresee every

possibility, but,in our view,they did satisfy the duty that
they had under the circumstances.
And I think the circumstances are important to have
clearly in mind.

It was at the suggestion of Logue's physician

in the hospital, and with the help of Logue’s attorney, that
Bowers — that the Deputy on the scene again -- had arranged
for a court order committing Logue to Springfield, Missouri,
for a competency determination, and also for his safekeeping
during this period of his psychosis.
As I indicated before, it was because of the lapse
of time that was to be involved that they determined that
something had to be done with him in the meantime, and the
determination was made for reasons that I think are satisfactory
in the record, but in any event are within the discretionary
function aspect of the Act, that they ought to keep him at the
jail rather than at the hospital, if the jail's facilities
could be adequately prepared for a man in this person’s con­
dition.
Deputy Bowers' supervisor, Deputy Jones, who was
located in Laredo, telephoned the chief jailer of Nueces County
Jail.

He explained the situation in some detail.

He indicated

28
the man was suicidal, and asked whether -**
Q

Is that set of facts the subject of any finding of

the District Judge?
MR. EVANS:
Q

No, sir.

Isn’t that important?
MR, EVANS:

Well, it is important only in the sense

tint ho did not resolve those facts against us, as Mr. DeAnda
suggested.
Q

Yes, but he did find that there was no specific

arrangement made by Bowers with respect to certain things.
And you are saying that if there was a deficiency
it was made up by Jones.
We haven’t any findings about that.
MR. EVANS;

Well, this, in our view, is the essence of

what the Court of Appeals holding was.
In essence, what the Court of Appeals held was that
in light of all the circumstances on the record, the failure
of Deputy Bowers,by himself, was not a breach of any duty,
because the duty had already been satisfied, in effect, by his
superior, and satisfied by Bowers because Bowers was aware that
the duty had already been satisfied by his superior.
Q

Your position, I take it, is that this being a non­

jury ease, the Court of Appeals was in as good a position as
the District Court to make a finding on that subject?

MR.

EVANS:

I think that’s a reasonable interpretation.

29
Q

I don’t follow this, Mr. Evans.
The specific finding of the District Judge was that

the failure of Bowers to make specific arrangements for constant
surveillance constituted negligence.

MR. EVANS:
Q

That’s right.

And you now say that »•=* what as to the telephone

conversation between the jailer and Jones?

What's the

significance of that?
MR. EVANS:

Well, the significance is that Bowers'

superior, supervisor. Deputy Jones —
Q

What's the significance of
MR. EVANS:

his being supervisor?

Well, I am just relating him as what

his function was in the operating.

No significance to his

being superior.
Q

If Jones' conversation had not taken place, you

wouldn' t be here, I take it ?
MR. EVANS:

Well, we might be here anyway, but I

wouldn't be making the same argument.
Q

You don't concede then, you don't concede that

whatever it was that Bowers did by himself was negligent?
Absent Jones' conversation,
MR. EVANS:

Absent Jones' conversation, I might

make an argument, on the record, Mr. Justice, that he was not
negligent, but I think that we would be bound and the Court of
Appeals would be bound by the findings made by the District Court

30
Blit: iay point, Mr. Justice Brennan, to answer your
question, is that the finding as to what Bowers did and did not
dofin -die Court of Appeal’s view» — the finding that the
District Court made did not constitute negligence because there
was no duty that was breached thereby.
In other words, the legal question, as to what duty
was required of Deputy Bowers, was what the Court of Appeals
was addressing attention to, as I understand it,
Q

That everything that Jones did satisfied any duty,

and no matter what Bowers did was immaterial?
MR. EVANS:

That’s not exactly right.

Bowers was made aware by Deputy Jones of the conversa»
tions with the jailer.

Jones directed Bowers that since he

was on the scene to inspect the cell and to assure hiniself that
it was adequately prepared and that the arrangements that had
been made with the jailer would be carried out, and he did so.
Q

What are you doing with this finding that whatever

Bowers did or failed to do constituted negligence?
MR. EVANS:

Mr. Justice, 1 agree that we are not

suggesting that Deputy Bowers made specific arrangements for
the surveillance.
Q

Are you suggesting that Deputy Bowers was not

negligent ?
MR. EVANS:
Bowers

That’s right, w© are suggesting Deputy

31
Q

Even though the District Court found that he ms?
MR. EVANS:

Even though the District Court found that

he had failed to make specific arrangements, and that that
ms negligence.

He agree that he failed to make the specific

arrangements, but we do not agree that it was negligence,
and we think that the Court of Appeals properly held that there
was no duty to make those specific arrangements in the circum­
stances of this case.
Q

Mr. Evans, was Bowers’ supervisor ever a party to this
«

case?
MR. EVANS:

I don’t believe any of the marshals,

themselves, were made parties.

I think it was a suit just

against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act.
Q

As I have understood your argument, and I think your

brief, you excuse Bowers primarily on the ground that he was
entitled to rely on the advice and instructions from his
supervisor.
MR, EVANS:
Q

That's correct.

Now, if tiie supervisor had been sued, would you defend

him?
MR. EVANS:

Certainly, because in the circumstances

of this case, the supervisor made the necessary arrangements
with the jailer of the county jail.
jailer was that the man was suicidal.

Hhat he told the county
You have to prepare a

Take out everything from that cell that a man

could possibly use to hurt himself.

When he is brought back to

the jail, strip hfca down to his shorts, and keep someone watching
him.
How, he specifically suggested to satisfy the
observation part of his suggestion, that one or two trustees,
that is, favored inmates, be placed either in the cell with the
prisoner or right outside where they could watch him continually.
-

How, in those circumstances, if his instructions had

been carried out, and, incidentally, the chief jailer expressly
agreed and indicated that he would carry out those instructions
and suggestions.
If they had been carried out, it would have been

—

I won't say impossible for the man to commit suicide because
it is hard to say when a man truly intends to commit suicide
that it would be impossible for him to do it.

But it would have

been much more difficult under the circumstances.
Our point, basically, is that if there was a failure
here, the failure was not on the part of any of the Federal
marshals involved, all of whom acted reasonably, but rather on
the part of the county jailer.
Q

Now, that was Bowers who had that conversation, not

Jones?
Mi.EVANS:

No, that was Jones.

Jones had the

telephone conversation with the chief jailer in which he made
these explicit arrangements.

Bowers, at Jones' instructions,

33
personally visited the jail, inspected the cell, assured himself
that all dangerous objects had been removed, determined that
it was convenient for observation by the jail authorities,
and later when he brought Logue to the jail he again inspected
it, again determined that it was safe, had a conversation,
evidently, with the jailers there, instructed them again as to
what needed to he done in the way of surveillance and left.
Q

Was that evidence disputed anywhere?
MR. EVANS:

The only dispute was that the chief

jailer of the Nueces County jail testified ~~ I characterise
the testimony as somewhat hasy, but that may be a subjective
view of it «- his memory only was that he did what he thought
he had been told to do, which was to have the Qian placed in
the cell, but to check him only periodically.

What they had

done Is the chief jailer and his staff, when they had business
on the second floor of the jail where Logue was confined, would
look in on him.
Q

Was the District Judge requested to address a finding

on that subject at any time?
MR, EVANS:

I am not sure I can answer that.

There is an easy answer but it is —■ the proposed
findings are in the Appendix,

I am rust familiar enough with

them at this point to answer your question.
Q

Mr. Evans, I have looked from beginning to end again,

at this opinion of the Court of Appeals.

Jones is nowhere

34
mentioned.

Nowhere.
Mtf EVANS:

Q

That’s right,

How do you — look, at page 34, would you please, of

the Opinion.
I am looking at the Petition.
MR. EVANS:
Q

Yes, sir.

The paragraph that begins, "United States is subject

to suit,"and so forth.

Then, it goes down, "Me interpret this

section as fixing the status of the county jail as out of the
contract,"
MR. EVANS:
Q

That’s right.

"This insulates United States from liability under

the FTCA for the negligent act or omission of the jail’s
employees.

We find no support in the record for holding that

Deputy Marshal Bowers had any power or authority to control any
of the internal functions of the county jail.

The Deputy

Marshal, accordingly, violated no duty of safekeeping."
Now, where is any of that rested on any conversation
with Jones or any participation, whatever, of Jones in tills?
MR. EVANS:

I agree that it is not explicitly rested

on that, Mr. Justice Brennan, but in my view the final sense
of the paragraph you just read is the sense that I am focusing
on, and I aia supporting that by the reasoning that the Court of
Appeals didn't
Q

What it says is it disposes of the finding of the

35
District Court that. — about Bowers,by saying he couldn’t have
been negligent because he had no duty, rather than that he
had a duty but it was satisfied by Jones.
MR. EVANS:

That’s right.

That may be the way the Court of Appeals viewed it.
Q

But you conceded a moment ago, I thought, that

Bowers had a duty,
MR. EVANS:

Yes, we agree that Bowers had a duty.

I think what the Court of Appeals —
Q

Well, the Court of Appeals hasn’t considered the

case on the legal basis that you now are talking about.
MR. EVANS:
Court of Appeals.

Well, the case was presented to the

It is not clear from this opinion that the

reasoning that undorlies its decision is the same reasoning
that I am urging on this Court, but I don’t think that we are
foreclosed from making the argument to support the judgment of
the Court of Appeals.
Q

Right.

But It does involve a factual assessment

that’s normally not siade here.
MR. EVANS:

I would say that it,in a sense, involves

a factual assessment.
Q

Wot a constitutional factual assessment?
MR. EVANS:

Q

That's right.

Would it follow then the case should be remanded for

a determination — or for that assessment of facts?

36
i-®, EVANS i

I’m not sure that the assessment that it

is not clear has been made wasn't, in fact, made by the Court
of Appeals*
I don’t know that it is necessary for the Court of
Appeals to have expressly stated that it was viewing the
facts as I am suggesting the facts could be viewed.
record is there.

It is basically undisputed.

The

And,in ray view,

the judgment of the Court of Appeals can be supported by viewing
the record as it stends.
Q

In other words, you say we must read that last sentence

as a finding based on the totality of the record?

MR. EVANS:

That’s correct.

I think that if the Court of Appeals had summarily
affirmed, or sunsuarily reversed, without opinion, in a case
like this, I think we could be here making the same argument.
I don’t think that the failure to express precisely
the reasoning that we are urging is fatal.
Q

But, once having gone into the subject, and discussed

the activities of Marshal Bowers, it does leave

some problems

hanging in mid-air a little bit,doesn’t it?
MR.
Q

EVANS:

Well,

I

don’t see the problems.

If, indeed, they were relying upon the conversation

between Jones and the jailer, we have to surmise that the Court
of Appeals was referring to that.

MR.

EVANS:

I think that we can surmise that the Court

37
of Appeals was aware of what was in the record, and that was
clearly in the record.
I don'i know that it is ~~
Q

What they said made it irrelevant what was in the

record.
They looked at it as a lack of duty case no matter
what Bowers or Jones did.
You say it is not a lack of duty case.
MR.EVANS: Well, I think the
looking at it.

* that was one way of

I think what the Court of Appeals may have had

in raind was that to their view the District Court was suggesting
that the specific arrangements that Bowers neglected to make,
or failed to make, would have required him, personally, to
stand in the jail and watch the prisoner.

And I think, in

essence, what they are saying is that he had no duty to do that.
But, as X say, I think that the judgment can be
supported on the reasoning I am

urging, even though they

haven’t made it as explicit as X have.
X think we ought to turn to the second point here
which has to do with whether assuming the marshals, themselves,
were not negligent, the United States is nonetheless liable
for the torts of the jail’s employees.
In our view, the Federal Tort Claims Act forecloses
that kind of derivative liability, and the Government is liable
because the Government is liable under the Tort Claims Act only

38
for tbs torts of Fedora! employees*
The reasoning of that limitation is plain.
If the United States were held liable for the torts
of the county jailers, over whoa Government can exercise no
♦

direct supervision, the Government would face potentially large
financial burden that it would be unable to avoid by its own
conduct.
There are approximately 800 of these contract jails
in the country, housing on any given day some 4,000 Federal
prisoners.
The United States has no authority to place a Federal
officer in each of these jails to supervise the physical conduct
of the jail's operations, and I don't think the States would
permit it even if they had the authority to do it.
And even if there were such authority, the burden
would be immense,

lie are informed that in order to man a jail

around the clock, with just one Federal employee, would require
five employees per prison, taking into account vacations, holiday
and weekends, and so forth.
Q

Do they formalise these agreements?
HR. EVANS:

Yes, the contract in this case is in

Volume 3 of the Appendix, page 638 and following.
Q

And that's the standard form?
HR. EVANS:

Q

That's right.

What about Mr. BeAnda's argument that even under Texas

39
law, under Federal law, the united States had a ”non-delegaule
duty1’ here, that is couldn’t, in effect, turn over to the Stats
to perform?
MR, EVAKS:

I think the argument is foreclosed by the

language of the Tort Claims Act and by the decisions of this
Court.
The Act, itself, the provisions of which are set
forth at page 41 of our brief, and as Mr. Chief Justice Burger
indicated, applies only to negligence committed by an employee
of the Government.
This Court, as recently as last

term, and

uow in

Laird v. Elms held that the requirement is of negligence of
a Government employee and it has to be of a Government employee.
There is no liability without fault in this case, and that’s
in essence what a — under this statute — and that’s in essence
what a non-delegabI.e duty amounts to.
Even if a single Federal employee could be stationed
in each of these contract jails to insure that Federal prisoners
are handled properly, it would be impossible, 1 think, for an
officer who has no authority to hire, fire, discipline or
train the employees he was supervising to effectively deal with
the problem.
And, in effect, the Government would be what
Mr. DeAnda said he is not urging they be, namely, an insurer of
the safety of Federal prisoners.

And 1 don’t think that Congress

40
intended that result under the Federal Tort Claims Act.
Q

But this could be limited to where a person is in a

hospital as a result of attempted suicide and is said by the
hospital to be psychotic.
MR. EVANS:

You don't have 4,000 of those, do you?

No,sir, but the argument is, at this

point, slightly different, not directed specifically to the
decision to remove the man from the hospital, if that’s the
intent of your ~Q

That leads me to what really worries me: the oroad

language of the Court of Appeals opinion that, under no
circumstances, can the marshal be responsible.
X assume, from your argument, that you aren’t urging
us to go that far.
MR. EVANS:
Q

No, sir, l’m not.

Well, that’s what I am saying, that there’s a middle

ground that in a particular case there could be circumstances
where you have to do a little more, and it is your argument
that in this case they did that little more.

Is that your

position?
MR. EVANS:

That’s right.

The Act, itself, provides for two possible grounds
under which the jail’s employees could conceivably oe viewed as
Federal employees for purposes of the Act.
One is that the jail is, in effect, a Federal agency
for purposes of dealing with Federal prisoners.

That, it seems

41
to sae, is foreclosed by the provision Hr. Chief Justice Burger
mentioned a little while ago, it excludes contractors.
quite plain that this is a contractor.

It is

It functions as an

independent contractor over whose employees the Federal Govern­
ment has no right of physical control.
And that is the standard, under Texas law, for
whether a masfer-servant relationship exists.
Second, they have an argument that nonetheless the
jail's employees are, in effect, employees of the Bureau of
Prisons, which is, obviously, a Federal agency, under the
provisions of the Act that provide -- that define Federal
employees as those who act on behalf of the United States in
an official capacity temporarily in the service of the United
States.
✓

But, in our view, that provision is limited only to
those people who -- over whom the United States does have a
right to control.
And, an example of the kind of situations that would
cover is where you have a Dollar-a-Year man serving without

pay or where you have a loaned servant from the State, or
where you have a member of a Presidential Commission, and so

forth.
All of these people are under control of the Government
but they are not employees, so to apeak.
Finally, I think I ought to address the point that

42
Mr* Justice Blackmun alluded to* a holding in our favor in this
case would not foreclose a remedy for people in Logue's situa­
tion.
At the time of Logue's death, there was sovereign
immunity that would have protected the county and the State,
but the sheriff was, personally, liable, and is liable for the
acts of his deputies, namely, the county jailers.
And it la not an empty remedy because the sheriff is
bonded in amounts between $5,000 and $30,000 under Texas State
statutes, and the decisions in Texas have held that the surety
must pay for the negligent acts of a sheriff's deputy.
And, in addition to the State remedy, there is a
possibility of a remedy under the Civil Rights Act, Section
1983 of Title 42, which provides that anyone who is injured by
a State officer acting under color of State law, to deprive the
loan of his Federal rights, will be liable in a civil cause of
ac tion.
Q

I thought, Mr. Evans, I understood Mr. DeAnda to say

that there was no remedy under State law.
MR. EVANS:

Perhaps he can —

I think Mr* DeAnda addressed himself to

remedy against the county or against the State.
I am addressing myself -- 1 agree that there was no -it is not clear to me that the Tort Claims Act In Texas did not
waive that immunity as to governmental units.

But I am addressing

myself, specifically, to the sheriffs and his deputies who are

43

personally liable under the Texas law.
Q

Hell, perhaps he can clarify that on rebuttal,
