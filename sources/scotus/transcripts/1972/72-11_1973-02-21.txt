MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Me will hear arguments

now in No. 72** II, Palmore against United States.
Mr. Flegal.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK F. FLEGAL, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. FLEGAL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
On February the first, 1971, the District of
Columbia Court Reorganization Act became effective.
Among other things, that Act created the Superior
Court of the District of Columbia, a court whose judges hold
office for limited terms, and vested jurisdiction in that
court to hear and determine certain felony charges brought by
the United States of America against persons accused of
violating acts of Congress applicable exclusively to the
District of Columbia,
The courts below and the parties have tended to
call such acts local statutes.
On February 23rd of 1971, appellant was indicted in
the Superior Court for a violation of such a statute, the
crime of carrying a dangerous weapon, in this case a gun
without a permit having been issued in accordance with law.
Since appellant had previously been convicted of
another and an'unrelated felony, and that prior conviction is

k
not at issue here, the charge against him was a felony charge.
If convicted, he stood to face imprisonment for up to 10 years.
Prior to trial, appellant challenged the jurisdiction
of the Superior Court.
He claimed that he was entitled to have his case
heard and determined by a Constitutional court, that is, of
course, a court ordained and established in accordance with
Article 3 and presided over by a judge holding office during
good behavior.
Q

And this claim was based upon the fact that this was

a felony charge?
MR. FLEGAL:
Q

Yes, sir, it was.

In other words, he, at least implicitly, conceded

that he could have been tried on a misdemeanor charge, is
that right?
MS.. FLEGAL:

Yes, indeed so, sir;

We make a distinction here; and let me just briefly
allude to it nowsand then when we get to the argument address
it in full.
Historically, as this Court has dealt with in the
Article III jury trial cases, there has been a distinction
between minor or petty cases.
Historically, as this Court pointed out in the Klawits
case, 300 United States, English judges, prior to the adoption
of the Constitution »«* judges not of the general jurisdiction

of England -- held and heard and determined minor matters
involving up to one year imprisonment.
Congress has always assumed that to be the case in
the District of Columbia and, indeed, now has magistrates in
several States, non-Article III officers, hearing such minor
matters*
For purposes of our argument, we assume that there
is a class of matter, and we assume, although this Court has
never decided, that a misdemeanor and one year is the appro­
priate constitutional judgment.

There is a historical basis

for that.
Q

There may be a difference between a, quote, "petty

offense,” unquote, and a misdemeanor —
MR. FLEGAL:
Q

Indeed, there may, Your Honor.

Sut, in any event, whatever -MR. FLEGAL:

In any event, whatever --a felony is

our proposition in this case.
After that motion was overruled, the trial court
proceeded to consider appellant’s motion to suppress evidence,
which was based upon appellant’s Fourth Amendment contention
that the method by which police officers obtained the evidence
v *

in this case, the gun, was a result of an unreasonable seisure
of appellant’s person.
The court heard evidence, and I put aside for a
moment the details of that evidence so that it will be freshly

6
at hand «hen «e turn to the Fourth Amendment argument, Fourth
Amendment position, later in the argument, and, having heard
Chat evidence, overruled appellant’s objection.
Appellant elected to stand on the legal issue which
had been raised and,trial by jury having been waived, the trial
court found appellant guilty of the charge against him.

He

was subsequently sentenced to from two to six years in prison.
Execution of the sentence was suspended, except for ISO days
imprisonment, on condition of six years probation.
An appeal was taken to the District of Columbia
Court of Appeals and that court affirmed the judgment.
Thereafter, appellate review was sought in this
Court.
We sought a review by filing a notice of appeal in
the District of Columbia Court of Appeals and docketing a
jurisdictional statement in this Court.
On October 10, 1972, this Court entered an order
placing this case on its hearing calendar but postponing the
question of jurisdiction until the argument of the case on the
merits.
Accordingly, I turn to that threshold question.
Strictly speaking, of course, it is not a question of
this Court’s appellate jurisdiction, for all parties concede
that this Court has jurisdiction to review the judgment of the
District of Columbia Court of Appeals in this case.

7
The question is,rather, a statutory question, the
mode or the manner by which we should have invoked this Court’s
appellate jurisdiction.
It is our contention that when Congress, as it has
done in the District of Columbia courts, creates a local court
system and vests that local court system with jurisdiction to
hear local matters and provides that appeals from the highest
local court shall be taken to this Court in accordance with
the general provisions of Section 1257 of the Judicial Code,
locally applicable laws constitute a law of a State within the
meaning of 1257, subdivision (2).
For that proposition, we place, of course, principal
reliance on the analogous case of Balzac v, Porto Rico, decided
50 years ago, where Congress provided that judgments of the
Supreme Court of Puerto Rico would be reviewed in this Court,
in accordance with 1257,
And the issue in Balzac was whether or not a statute
applicable exclusively to Puerto Rico was thereby deemed to be
a statute of a State.
In a unanimous opinion written by Chief Justice Taft,
this Court held that it was.
Itow, it is quite true, as the Government points out,
that the legislature that had enacted the statute in Balzac
was a territorial legislature, not the United States Congress.
But that fact played no articulable part in this Court’

b
opinion.

Rather, the Chief Justice focused on the manifest

intent of Congress, a point, of course, which this Court
reiterated just last month in the Carter case, the intent of
Congress in enacting and providing for such a method of
review.
For reasons set forth in Balsac and articulated in
our opinion, we think this case is properly here on appeal.
At the outset, of course, by the filing of our
jurisdictional papers and again in our brief, we have invoked
in the alternative the certiorari jurisdiction of this Court in
the event that we are wrong.
But, of course, having the case here, whether by
certiorari or appeal, does not answer the question which was
raised and overruled in the trial court: was appellant entitled
to have his case heard and determined by a constitutional court?
Article III discussions tend frequently to become
academic, and there are subtle nuances in Article III issues,
and the parties have pursued those in their brief.
Q

You don't submit, or do you, that the answer to the

first question necessarily controls the answer to the second?
MR. FLEGAL:
the second.

It has nothing to do with the answer to

The first question is purely a statutory con­

struction issue.
Q

Whether it is an appeal or certiorari?
MR. FLEGAL:

Correct.

9
Q

And that’s basically a question unrelated to -MR, FLEGAL:

Completely unrelated.

It is the mode

of seeking review, the statutory mode, and it is purely a
question of statutory interpretation.
On the merits, however, it -Q

Does it turn on whether or not the statute is deemed

to be a statute of the State?
MR. FLEGAL:

For purposes of a statute, Your Honor,

not for purposes of Article III, Section 1, of the Constitution,
Q

Nevertheless, that's the question.
MR. FLEGAL:

That is the question, excuse me, of

course, that is the question on the first proposition in the
appeal as opposed to certiorari.
Q

And you suggest you would get different answers

under the two?
MR. FLEGAL:
Q

Indeed, I am, sir.

You do?
MR. FLEGAL:

I do get different answers, and I say

that because under the statute the question, of course, is
purely one of statutory construction — what did Congress
intend under Article III of the Constitution?
We have, of course, a constitutional issue, what did
the Framers mean?
And it is not conceded.

The Government does not

oppose the proposition that within the meaning of Article III

of the Constitution an act of Congress, albeit one applicable
only to the District of Columbia, is, of course, a law of the
United States.
That*s the only basis by which this Court’s appellate
jurisdiction from the beginning of the Republic with respect
to local District of Columbia matters, not otherwise involving
a constitutional issue, can be sustained.
Our proposition is that the Article III protection
for the independence of the Federal judge, that is the good
behavior tenure and the associated constitutional restrictions,
confer, of course, important rights on the judge, but principal,
and importantly and for purposes of this case, they also confer
rights and benefits and safeguards on the litigants.
Now, that is a proposition which the Government
contested at the outset of this case.

At the threshold stage,

the Government suggested that we did not have standing to raise
this issue.
They’ve abandoned that in their brief, and I think.
properly so.
This Court has addressed the meaning of the Goad
Behavior Clause,as it affects litigants, time and again.
And, while I donft want to belabor the point, I
want to emphasise two cases on which we principally rely, and
that i3, of course, the O’Donoghue case, where this Court
traced the meaning of Article III with respect to litigants.

11
In 0*Donoghue, this Court referred, for example, to
one of the specific complaints which the Signers of the
Declaration had made, the judges were being limited in their
tenure and having their salaries reduced a
And, in Q’Donoghue and aga.in in Lurk and in the
Court Martial cases and 0*Callahan —

q

He was a judge, was he not?

m.

FLEGAL:

O'Bonoghue was a judge, Your Honor,

However, Toth and 0*Callahan were litigants, as was Lurk the
litigant in the companion case, Glidden v, Zdanok.
And, in Lurk, this Court referred to the protection
designed in part for the protection of the litigant.
And that’s the protection which.we sought,
Q

That was Justice Harlan’s opinion?
MR. FLEGAL:

Your Honor.
Q

That was the plurality opinion, yes,

The plurality opinion by Mr. Justice Harlan,

It was not a court opinion?
MR. FLEGAL:

Hot a court opinion in Lurk,

Of course, it is Mr. Justice Black’s plurality
opinion in Toth, a court opinion in 0*Callahan, all dealing
with litigants and all referring to the right conferred upon
the litigant.
How, of course, there can be no contention here, as
was the issue in Lurk, that appellant did receive an Article
III judge.

12
The judge that presided at our ferial holds office for

15 years, not good behavior.

He is not subject to protection

from diminishment of his salary, and he is not answerable only
fco fche other branches of Government through fche impeachment
process.

He is answerable feo a commission, the Commission on

Judicial Disabilities and Tenure, which consists of five members
Three of them are appointed by the President of fche United
States.

The fourfen by fche Mayor-Commissioner of fche District

of Columbia who, in turn, of course, Is appointed by the
President.

And the fifth, Chief Judge of the District Court.
Any four members of the Commission have power, after

holding appropriate proceedings, to remove fche judge, and if
he is removed? if a Commission order is entered, his salary
instanfcly stops, pending his resort: fco judicial review.
Q

Is this statute somewhat like that of California

and some of the other States?
HR. FLEGAL:

Yes, quite like a State, Your Honor,

but, of course, totally foreign to Article III, fche review is
sought by filing a notice of appeal with Your Honor who is
thereupon called to designate a special three-judge tribunal
consisting of Circuit and/or District judges fco finally hear and
determine.
So fchafc^ the right we claimed.
Q

Are you suggesting fchat the Good Behavior language of

Article III could be implemented only by the process of

13
impeachment?
MR. FLEGAL:

At least with respect to the other two

branches of Government, Your Honor,.
It is not at issue in this case as to whether within
the Judicial Branch there ±q some power of superintendence of
the performance of lower court or inferior judges.
Our proposition is that the Impeachment Clause is the
only way the other branches of Government can oversee the
performance of judges.
Q

That is a basically unanswered question, isn't it?
Mil. FLEGAL:

Oh, of course.

Of course*

question which is not raised in this case.

And it is a

There is no

question here that the Judicial Disabilities and Tenure
Commission is a body of "good behavior" judges, but our
proposition turns on the other two branches of Government,
not the Judiciary, Your Honor*
Q

Well, even the first — even vis-a-vis the other

two branches of Government, it is not wholly established —
MR. FLEGAL:

It is not a wholly established

principal, that's right.
Q

It is conceded that these are not Article III

judges.
MR. FLEGAL:
Q

Precisely, Your Honor.

And, since it is conceded, there is not any need for

you to spend any time proving it, I suppose.

14
&R. FLEGAL:

The question then arises: are we

entitled to this right?

If

Article III safeguards and benefits mean anything,

if the Founders did not accomplish

a

fruitless act, insofar as

litigants are concerned, then, of course, we contend that the
felony class of case has to be included within these protections
In other words, if anyone is to get these benefits,
other than, perhaps, judges, if any litigant is,

a

felony

litigant must have them, because no otter place that we can
conceive would rise to greater constitutional dignity.
Perhaps otters, perhaps constitutional questions
would be similar, but nothing would be higher.
Then, why, according to the courts below and the
Government, are we not entitled to this constitutional
protection?
The Government suggests that there is no requirement
in Article III that Congress afford this constitutional right
to any litigant.
And the Government supports this proposition by
suggesting that with respect to at least any one of the
enumerated legislative powers of Congress, and this is an
argument which is not limited to the District of Columbia,
either in the District or in the several States, Congress may
create a so-called legislative court, a non-constitutional
court, and thereby deprive us of the benefits and safeguards to

IS
which this Court has repeatedly referred.
Q

Slow, you emphasise these benefits and safeguards, but

those are benefits and safeguards that most of the citizens of
most of the States do not have.
MR* FLEGAL:

Reecisely.

It is not a Fourteenth

Amendment benefit and safeguard, at ail, Your Honor, and we
don't contend that it is.
Q

That's what made me wonder about your great emphasis

on it, since most of the 200 million people in the country are
subject to it.
ME. FLEGAL:

Right.

Our contention, of course, is

that the original Constitution and certain protections in the
first ten amendments, for example, Grand Jury indictment,
Article III and Sixth Amendment trial by jury, are, of course,
rights which are afforded litigants when the Federal judicial
powers are brought to bear, not necessarily required under the
Fourteenth Amendment in the States.
We make no contention that there is anything
fundamentally unfair in the Fourteenth Amendment sense about
having judges with limited tenure..
Our proposition is the Framers gave a right in
Article III beyond that which Fourteenth Amendment due process
would require to bo afforded.
Government says that because under the Supremacy
Clause Congress could arguendo require State courts to hear and

16

determine Federal felonies, that's the end of the Inquiry,
If they can require this case to be heard in a
State court, the Government argues, then, of course, a State
court judge, following up on Your Honor’s proposition, would
not hold life tenure, and why are we entitled to it?
I suggest the distinction which Your Honor's question
focuses is precisely the falacy of the Government's argument»
In the first place, when a State court hears a
case, whether or not that case arises under State law or
arises out of an act of Congress which the State is enforcing
under the Supremacy Clause, the State is exercising the State's
judicial power, not the judicial power of the United States,
aid Article III, by its terns, is a limitation on Federal, not
State, judicial power.
And, taking one step further, the proposition that
was addressed by the Chief Justice's question, the Government's
position puts Federal courts on the plane of the Fourteenth
Amendment.
The Government's argument, carried to its logical
extension, create

a non-Article III court because you could

require a State court to do it, means that any right that a
Federal defendant lias that a Fourteenth Amendment defendant
in the State court does not have, could be deprived.
And 1 don't think that's the law.

I don't think the

Congress can deprive a Federal litigant of a Grand Jury

17
indictment, even though a State may not have to provide it,
or of an Article III jury or of an Article III judge.
What, then, does the Government argue beyond that?
The Government relies, of course, on the Legislative
court cases.

The Government says that there is a Judicial

power outside of Article III which is coextensive with that
conferred in Article III»
This Court has never so held*

This Court has never

so held.
In the permanent part of the United States, this
Court has always carefully looked at the nature of the matter
being adjudicated by the so-called Legislative court, and if
that matter was a subject for which the litigant had no right
to claim judicial determination, if it was subject to being
disposed of by exercise of another power, Legislative or
Executive, then the Court has said it is permissible to have
the matter adjudicated in a Legislative court.
There has never been even a piece of dicta in one
of this Court's Legislative court cases which would suggest
that a non-Article III court could hear and determine a felony
and impose a felony punishment.
Q

Back in the days when what are now the interior

States of the United States were territories, some of them,
Utah, and so on, the territorial courts out there, of course,
tried felonies, including capital offenses.

Were those all

ia
Article HI judges?
Ml, FLEGAL:

It is an interesting question on theory,

Your Honor*
Justice Harlan, in his plurality opinion in Gliddan
v. Zdanok, said yes they were, that they were Article III

judges exercising Article III judicial power, but exempt,
because of the peculiar temporary status of the territories,
from Article Ill's tenure requirement.
What does that mean? Maybe I knew what ifc meant when
I «*•

<
Ml. FLEGAL:

; j

■ .s

I think what it means, Your Honor —

I think what Justice Harlan had in mind was the nature of the
matters they were determining were the kind of matters, includ­
ing felonies, which could only be adjudicated by an Article III
court.
Therefore, they had to be exercising the judicial
power of Article III.
Q

A circular argument, isn't it?
MR. FLEGAL:

That's right.

He then said, however, because of the temporary
status of the territories they were exempt from the "good
behavior" clause, that more recently this Court in the Garter
case and back in Q'Donoghue said they weren’t Article III
judges at all.

They were always Article IV judges exercising

the power conferred upon Congress under the Territories Clause,

19
the Acquisition Clause, outside of, and this, we think, is
the important point in this case —
Q

How, in fact, were those judges nominated and

appointed and what tenure did they have?

And what guarantee

did they have?
MR. FLEGAii:

Various proposals had been used in the

different territories, Your Honor.

Sometimes the President

appointed and Congress confirmed, and other times local
legislatures or the territorial governor confirmed the
territorial judges, but they all sat for limited terms of
office.
At the present time, we have several kinds of
territorial judges.
Those of Puerto Rico are appointed by the President
with the advice and consent of the Senate and hold their offices
during at least statutory good behavior, and,yet, as the
Government has pointed out in its brief, out in Samoa, for
example, the President of the United States appoints the
officer or the official to exercise the judicial power.
But the critical point; and why we distinguish the
territorial court cases,is all of those have dealt with
temporary necessity out in non-permanent parts of the Federal
Union.
Q

Like Samoa?
Ml. FLSGAL:

Yes, Your Honor.

20
Q

When did we buy Alaska from Russia?
MR. FLEGAL:

Oh, 'way back, Your Honor«

(laughter)
Q

They continued in that temporary status for, what,

100 and some years?

m.

FLEGAL:

Right.

Perhaps X should have prefaced my statement as
constitutional temporary status.

In other words, the first

three Articles of the Constitution, which include the States
and the District of Columbia, that's the permanent Union,
then the territories may or may not join that Union, either as
States or perhaps under some other arrangement, but until they
do they are not constitutionally permanent.

We can sell the

territory, relinquish it, return it to another sovereign, and
so forth.
Q

Mr. Flegal, if you follow Justice Harlan's analysis

in Glidden v. Zdanok, the litigant in these territorial courts
-- I mean, presumably, the sentences imposed on them were
rather permanent, rather than temporary, and —
MR. FLEGAL:
Q

Indeed so, Your Honor,

And they were exempt from having their rights

enforced in those cases.
MR. FLEGAL:

They, indeed, were, Your Honor.

The litigants in the territorial court cases did not
get the constitutional benefit we seek here.

21
Hot», this Court lias rejected* however, the territor**
ial court argument whenever it has been made to deprive a
District of Columbia litigant of a constitutional right.
I go back, for example, fco Callao v. Wt 1 son.. the
first case in this Court dealing with the constitutional rights
of the citizens of the District of Columbia.
That case involved Article III, Section 2‘s trial
by jury, and the Sixth Amendment trial by jury, and the argu­
ment was made the District of Columbia is like a territory,
there is plenary legislative power, you don't get the con­
stitutional right.
This Court rejected that argment.

It rejected the

territorial analogy in holding that Judge O'Donoghue's salary
could not be reduced during his tenure in office.
And, as recently as last month, this Court distin­
guished the territorial courts created under Article IV from
the District of Columbia courts created under Article III.
Q

That was for purposes of the Civil Sights Act.
Mi* FLEGAL:

Yes, yee.

So that the point I am

making is whether they were Article

IV

courts, exercising

Article IV powers, and thereby the litigants were not
entitled to claim an Article III right, or whether as Justice
Harlan suggested in his plurality opinion in Gliccen, they
were exercising Article III power but exempt from the "good
behavior” tenure.

It does not have controlling bearing on this

22

case.
Now, what then is left?
What is left, of course, is the plenary legislative
power of Congress over the District of Columbia.
And, in the course of discussing the territorial court
cases, I have already outlined, of course, our position on that.
The District of Columbia is permanent. This Court
has already held that each time a constitutional right was
claimed to be denied because — to a litigant ~~ because the
District of Columbia was somehow unique, this Court has
rejected that argument.
Q

Is there an example of the territory other than the

District of Columbia dispensing with a constitutional right
that this Court has approved?
MR. ELEGAL: No, not that I know of, Your Honor.
Q

Well, then, what's your point?
MR. FLEGAL: My point is that the District of

Columbia has — the citisens of the District of Columbia
before the Federal Courts, have all of the rights of the
original constitution and the amendments.
Whether or not the territorial litigants were
deprived of the right we seek here, by virtue of a Fourth
Amendment theory or an Article III temporary status theory,
we don't think is determinative.
Q

You still have

and I suppose you will demonstrate

23
that the law that we have at issue here — or that the
statute that was being enforced is the law of the United
States.
MR. FLEGAL:

Yes, indeed so, because, of course, that

is central to our proposition.
The Government has not argued otherwise, but let me
just briefly address that right now, Your Honor.
The earliest —
Q

This Is to show that you are talking about an

Article III power.
Ml. FLEGAL:

Article III power, of course.

Because

if our case did not arise under Article III, we haven’t got
any -Q

And to do that it has to arise under a law of the

United States?
MR.

FLEGAL:

That’s correct.

The only power

that we seek to invoke here is the law of the United States.
So there is nothing to do with any other of the matters to
which the judicial power extends.
It has been repeatedly held, both in decisions of
this Court and in decisions of the early District of Columbia
courts. Going back as early as 1805, an opinion which Chief
Justice Marshall

participated while sitting on Circuit, that

laws applicable exclusively to the District of Columbia are
laws of the United States.

Indeed, they must be so, or this

24
Court could not review a local mattes; as it has historically
done,that was not otherwise presented with a constitutional
issue«
As recently, for example, as 1965, I believe it was,
this Court decided, purely on a basis of statutory construction,

a tax matter arising out of the District of Columbia taxing
statutes.
Of course, the only power this Court would have to
construe that statute — and it was not a constitutional claim,
it was a statutory claim — would be if that statute wa3 a law
i

of the United States.
The first chief judge of the local courts in the
District of Columbia, Chief Judge Cranch, —
t

Q

Why do you say that?
MR. FLEGAL:

Why do I say that this Court could not?

Because no other power in Article III would purport
to give this Court the power to construe a statute that was
not a statute of the United States, a law of the United States
•» m*

Q

To construe it? What about in diversity cases?
MR. FLEGAL:

Well, in diversity cases, of course,

then you have a power — the ease arises — the diversity of
citizenship — the status of the parties confers jurisdiction
to deal with the case in controversy at issue between thorn
regardless of the nature of the suit.

25

But the District of Columbia v. General Motors,
which is the case X refer to, was not a diversity suit.

It

came to this Court with no other basis for Article III
jurisdiction except the construction of the statute.
We have collected in our brief similar cases which
go bach through the 19th Century, and we have cited in our
brief from the very first territorial court case, incidentally,
American Insurance Company v. Canter, the statement of
Mr, Justice Johnson, who sat on Circuit, on that case, that if
laws applicable exclusively to the District of Columbia are
not laws of the United States, this Court, the Supreme Court,
has no power to review them.
And, in the course of that argument, he rejected
that proposition and said laws applicable exclusively to the
District of Columbia are laws of the United States,
The question, then, finally arises: is there
something in the plenary legislative power given Congress
under Section 17, rather Clause 17, of the Article 1, Section
8, the so-called plenary power over the District of Columbia,
that somehow relates to. the constitutional right at stake
here.
lie say not.

We say not for two reasons.

First, that plenary power is not limited to the
District of Columbia.

That's the power that provides not only

for exclusive legislation over the seat of Government, but also,

26
of course, Federal enclaves and forts out in the several States,
So that this argument is not strictly limited to the
District of Columbia,
Beyond that, this Court has always held — and X
think correctly — that when you are dealing with the exclusive
and the plenary legislative power of Congress, that may mean
Congress is free of any other restriction in Article X, but it
does not exempt Congress from other provisions in the body or
the Bill of Rights of the Constitution.
Q

Didn't the Framers go to some pains to single out

the District of Columbia, the seat of Government, in defining
the plenary powers that you are talking about?
MR. FLEGAL:

Indeed, they do,sir.

And the pains they went to is embodied, of course, in
Clause 17 of Section 8 of Article I, and that is the plenary
legislative — and I underline that word "legislative" power «—
given Congress.

Q

Mow, when

we

think of a State having legislative

power, does that not include the power to create courts?
MR. FLEGAL:

Q

Oh, clearly.

If a State —

The legislative powers of the Congress include the

power to create courts and define the jurisdiction of the courts
MR. FLEGAL:

Q

Clearly.

And the tenure of the judges.
III. FLEGAL:

That's where we disagree.

Our propositio

27
is the District of Columbia, of course, is not a State.
The seat of Government was a State at one time.
It was Maryland and Virginia.

It. was seceded to and exclusive

Federal jurisdiction attached in. 1801 under the Secession
Act.
At that point, Congress is not, strictly speaking,
a State legislature.
This Court has already held that Congress is bound
by provisions which don't bind a State legislature when dealing
with local matters.
I refer again to the Fifth Amendment Grand Jury
indictment and the Article III and the Sixth Amendment right
to a jury trial.
A State legislature is not bound by those provisione.
Congress, when acting and legislating locally for
the District of Columbia, is.
Q

Well, what you are arguing now is that a defendant

has the same right to an Article III judge on the same
constitutional level as the right to be indicted by a Grand
Jury and all the others?
MR, FLEGAL:

indeed, so.

We are claiming the same safeguard that this Court
referred to in the Court Martial cases, starting with Toth,
Callahan, Lurk, Q'Donoghue.
This is a right of the Federal litigant.

This is the

28
right we claim.
Indeed, we think the Colts case, which is 282 U.S.,
cited in our brief, is directly on point.
In that case, in a local case arising out of the
District of Columbia, this Court squarely held that a local
litigant was entitled to the safeguards of Section 2 of
Article III, the jury trial.
There is no reference in the Colts case to the
Sixth Amendment, purely Section 2, Article III.
Q

Mr. Flegal, under your theory, could Congress vest

the appointment of judges in the District of Columbia in anyone
other than the President of the United States?
MR. FLEGAL:

Yes, under the Constitution, Your Honor,

the appointment of officers of the judges can also be vested
in the President alone without confirmation or in the head of
a department.
Q

That i9, if they are inferior officers under that

Section of the Constitution?

What leads you to say that such

judges could be treated as inferior officers, as that term is
used in Article II?
MR. FLEGAL:

What leads me to say that, Your Honor,

is there is nothing else in the appointing part of Article IX
that distinguishes judges from those inferior officers.

In

other words, Article II reads that "unless Congress shall by
law otherwise prov5.de" the President shall appoint and the

29
Congress shall give their advice and consent»
But, by lav;, Congress may vest the appointment of the
inferior officers in the President alone or in the head of a
department.
How, the final, of course, question, raised by this
case is whether or not we were entitled to have our motion to
suppress granted by a constitutional judge or by a non-con­
stitutional judge.
That is a separate issue and it is an issue equally
dispositive of this case, for on this record, without the
evidence we sought to have suppressed, there is no evidence to
support appellant's conviction.
That requires, of course, that we turn briefly to the
facts.

They are not in dispute.
At the trial court, appellant and his witness gave

a different version of this encounter than did the police
officer.
We have not contended on appeal, and we do not
contend here, that the trial judge was bound to believe our
witness.
Rather, our position is on the police officer's
version of the events appellant's right to be free from
unreasonable seizures was violated.
What were the facts?
Appellant was driving a car at about 8:00 o'clock in

30
the evening on the 600 block of T Street, in downtown
Washington.
At that point in time,
traffic ordinance.

he

had violated no law, no

He had no apparent equipment defect, and

there is no contention, there has been no contention in any
court below and there is no contention here, that the officers
were possessed of any articulable facts to show that he had
been, was, or was about to be engaged in any criminal conduct»
This was a matter of a specific finding by the Court
of Appeals.
Two plainclothes officers assigned to the Special
Operations Division of the District of Columbia Police
Department, decided that they would stop appellant for, what
has been described in this record as a spot-check or a traffic
check, or,in one place, a rental agreement check.
They turned on their red lights and their siren and
they forced appellant to the 3ide of the road.
Appellant produced a driver's license and was asked
to return to the car and obtain a copy of his rental agreement
form -- and I interject here the officers have claimed that
they knew this was a rental agreement car, rather a rental
car because of the special serial numbers on the license plate.
An officer was thereupon engaged in discussing with
appellant an apparent discrepancy in the expiration date of
his rental agreement when a fellow officer who had been on the

31
passenger side of she car

shining a flashlight into the

interior, discovered the gun, seised the gun and arrested
appellant.
Our contention is at the moment appellant was
stopped, at the moment he was stopped, for this license spotcheck, his Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable
seizures had been infringed.
It is important to point out that in this case there
is no Congressional statute which, on its face, purports to
authorize police officers to stop citizens for purposes of
inspecting either driver*s licenses or motor vehicle registrations.
The statutes do require that citizens carry both of
those documents while they operate a car and the driver’s
license statute does require that a citizen display that
license to a police officer, but it does not specifically
provide that the officer is entitled to stop in order to ask
for the display,
Q

You say the police officer could not spot-cheek for

driver's licenses in the District?
M. FLEGAL:

Our position is that a police officer,

acting without standards set out by somebody, either the
legislature, perhaps the Commissioners of the District of
Columbia, or at least the higher officials in the Police
Department, he cannot be left to his own discretion to pick

32
anybody else that he wants out for a spot-check.
And I cay that for this reason.

On this record, the

officer who made this spot-check, said that "I have no basis,
I have been given no instructions as to how or whom I should
stop.

I Chink it is up to me to pick people out and I pick

rental cars, because I think a lot of them are overdue.

X

want to see if the man can prove that it is not overdue
because it is a crime if it is overdue."
He also referred to the fact that on another
occasion a fellow officer had found $6,000 worth of narcotics
in a rental cart
Leaving it to the unfettered and unarticulated
standards of the police officer on the corner simply poses too
great and too unreasonable a restriction with the right of
free movement.
We don’t see,in contempoary urban society, any great
difference between walking down the street and driving —
Q

Except that you have to be licensed to drive down

the street and you don’t have to be licensed to walk.
FiR, FLEGAL:

Oh, clearly, clearly, but I am talking

in terms of justifiable expectation of privacy.
You may well have to submit to reasonable and perhaps
spot-checks, but the question is

not is it a spot-check.

where we think the court below made the mistake.
is is this a reasonable spot-check?

That’

The question

33

And we say when it is done on an individual basis
by a police officer given no standards by anybody, stopping

them for his own reasons, that's what makes it unreasonableu
I think I should call to the Court's attention a
case which was decided in the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania,
and we were unable to include it in our brief, although we
will shortly do so in a formal amendment — we only got the
opinion yesterday.
The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, the case is
Commonwealth v. Swanger, has since squarely so held.
It is simply unreasonable for police officers,
acting on their ora, to stop for spot-checks.
In the Pennsylvania case, if anything, there was a
much more compelling State requirement, because Pennsylvania
had a statute.
The case is based squarely on the Fourth Amendment,
squarely on the principles in Terry.
Q

Suppose the Police Department came to the conclusion

there were a great many unlicensed drivers driving unsafe
cars and so they decided to check every fiftieth car that a
policeman could see during his hours when he wasn't otherwise
engaged?

Would you think that would be all right?
MR. FLEGAL:

That gets to be a closer case to

reasonable, Your Honor, because now you have had a responsible
determination by the Police Chief or the Traffic Chief, whoever

34

ho is.

You have given the police officer on the comer a

basis to do it, so he is not doing it because he thinks rental
cars are overdue or because there might be narcotics, and you
have told him how to do it.
Q

But you think a random check is not permitted?
MR. FLEGAL:

Hoi: random where the basis for the random

selection is Left to the individual judgment of the officer.
That is the narrow point we make on this case.
We have nothing to argue here about what would happen
if the Police Chief said every fiftieth car, or today is
yellow cars, or something of that nature.
That's the next case.

But our case is leaving it to

the unfettered judgment of the officer on the corner.

And

we think, and we think this record shows that it simply runs
too high of a risk -Q

What if tiie Department said, "Check all rental cars

because" — let us assume they had concluded that rental agencies
were being very lax about requiring people to produce a driver's
license — and so the order is, "Check all rental cars."
MR, FLEGAL:
Q

For drivers' licenses, and so forth?

For everything.
Ml. FLEGAL:

case again.

All right.

They've got a basis.

That becomes a different
They've given the officers

some standards, and perhaps you would have a different case.
I think it is important here to add one other factor,

35
and that Is that in this case the only safety matter,really,
is the driver’s license.

It was not even set forth to the

officer as a basis for the stop.

That document was produced

at the outset of the stop, returned and appellant was not
free to go, at that point in time.
In other words, this officer, on this record, is
using his power to make traffic checks to see whether or not
you can prove a rental car is overdue, and, of course, as the
officer has also conceded, they have a list of overdue and
stolen cars, and this car was not on that list.
Q

I suppose your position xjould have to be the same

on the search and seizure, if upon stopping the car and
finding — coming close to it, they saw a small child bound
and gagged in the back of the car.

They couldn't 3eise the

child and release it, could they?
MR. FLEGAL:

Oh, of course.

Our proposition in this

case, Your Honor, is what they initially did.

We make no

contention that if they had a right to stop appellant under the
circumstances shown on this record, that what they did
thereafter made it unreasonable.
Our contention is they could not, under the circum­
stances of this case, stop him at the outset*
Q

How is the gun that they found in the car any

different from anything else they might find in the car?
MR. FLEGAL:

I am sorry.

Perhaps I didn°t understand

36
Your Honor’s question.
Q

I said that when they ran his flashlight, if that’s

what it was,in the back seat, found that there was a person,
a body, let’s say the body of a dead person all tied up, on
the way to Chesepeake Bay or some such thing.
How, they can’t do anything about that?
MR, FLEGAL:

Your Honor, the Fourth Amendment

doesn’t say they can’t do anything about it.

It says that

if you infringe the defendant's Fourth Amendment rights in
getting to the position and stopping the car, then you can’t
introduce that piece of evidence.
It doesn't mean, of course, you can’t release the
child —
Q

You can’t introduce that body and charge this man

with some crime?
MR* FLEGAL:

My position would be the same.

position would be the same.

My

The admission of the gun or the

admission of the body does not make a distinction.
For this reason, it is our position that the judgment
below should be reversed.
And, with the Court's leave, I’ll save my remaining
time for rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Mr. Solicitor General.

Very well, Mr. Flegai.

37
ORAL ARGUMENT OF EROT N, GRISWOLD, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR. GRISWOLD:

Me. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
As Me. Flegal has indicated, there are three
separate questions in this case, and I shall discuss them in
the same order in which he did.
The first is the question of this Court’s jurisdic­
tion of the appeal which was taken here.

That, I think,

divides into two parts.
And I would make a somewhat different answer to
Sir. Justice Stewart's question about this than Mr. Flegal did,
because I think one of those parts is identical with the con­
stitutional question presented with respect to the District
of Columbia Court system.
For, if it should be concluded, as I hope it will
not, that criminal cases in the District of Columbia can be
heard only by Article III courts, then these tribunals are
not courts, for they do not meet the requirements of Article
III, particularly as to tenure.
The judges of these courts are appointed for 15
year terms.

They don't serve during a period of good behavior.

This Court has only appellate jurisdiction in cases
such as this, and If the tribunal below is not validly
established it is not a court, and this Court has no

38

jurisdiction to review its decision.
The remedy in such a ease would appear to be by
writ of habeas corpus in the District Court of the United
States for the District of Columbia,
But if the tribunal below is a court, then we have
left the question which is discussed in the briefs.
Congress has power to regulate the appellate
jurisdiction of this Court, and has done so in Section 1257
of Title 28 of the United States Code.
It is paragraph 2 which provides for appeal to this
Court to review a decision, quote, "rendered by the highest
court of a State," close quote, where there is, quote, "drawn
in question the validity of a statute of any State on the
ground of its being repugnant to the Constitution, treaties,
or laws, of the United States, and the decision is in favor
of its validity,"
How, these words alone would, of course, not be
sufficient to support jurisdiction here, for we had neither
a decision of the highest court of a State nor do we have ini

volved the validity of a statute of any State„ since the court
below is one established for the District of Columbia by the
Congress, and the statute whose validity is questioned
was not enacted by a State but by Congress#
The first of these matters is taken care of in the
statute itself by an amendment which was enacted as a part of

39
the District of CoitMbia Court Reorganization Act of 1970,
and it is printed on page 4 of our brief at the end of our
printing of Section 1257.

It added a paragraph there which

provides that for the purposes of this section, the term
"highest court of the State” includes the District of Columbia
Court of Appeals.
So that half of the problem is resolved, but there
still remains the question whether the decision below involves
the validity of a statute of any State.
Can those words be construed to apply to
a statute which was passed by both Houses of Congress, signed
by the President, and was never considered by the legislature
of any State or, indeed, of any territory?
If Congress meant that, it could have said so.
It knew how to do that in this very Act, for it did provide
in Section 172(c)(1) of the Act, adding Section 1363 to Title
28 of the United States Code, that laws applicable exclusively
to the District of Columbia should not be considered, quote,
"laws of the United States," close quote, or, quote, "acts of
Congress," close quote, for the purposes of that provision.
Congress made no similar provision for a special
modification of the plain words — plain meaning of the words
statute of any State

in Section 1257(2),

Reliance is placed on this Court’s decision in
Balzac v. Porto Rico, decided in 1922 in an opinion by Chief

40
Justice Taffci
But that decision is clearly distinguishable.

In

the first place, there was a considerable history to the
statutory provision involved there.

It is too complicated to

give in detail here, but it is readily apparent, from reading
the opinion, the interrelation of then Sections 237 and 246 of
the Judicial Code, the statute with respect to Puerto Rico was
linked to the provision with respect to Hawaii, and Congress
had said that it wanted review here which was comparable to
that in cases coming from the States.
On that basis, a statute passed by the Legislature
of Puerto Rico was held to be a statute of a State for the
purpose of what is now Section 1257, taken In the light of other
statutory provisions then in force.
But here, we do not have a statute passed by a
territorial legislature or any other outside body.

The

statute here was passed by Congress itself, after extensive
consideration there.
Congress has never provided for appeal from decisions
sustaining the validity of its own statutes, and there is no
reason for forcing a construction on the statute here to reach
that result.
If that were done, defendants-: in the B.C» courts
could question the validity of every provision in the D.C.
Criminal Coda.

The validity of the statutory provisions against

41
murder or burglary, for example, and then when their con­
tentions were denied by the court below, they would have a
right of appeal to this Court, if the validity

of

the statute

was sustained.
The position for which we contend seems to be
sustained likewise by this Court’s recent decision in
Fornaris v. Ridge Tool Co. in 400 ILS,

It begins on page 41,

and the jurisdictional question is decided in a long footnote
on page 42.
There are some things about that footnote which are
not crystal clear to me, but, among other things, the Court
did not cite the Balsac case, which would seem to have had
some relevance, but the Court does make it perfectly plain
that for purposes of appeal from the United States Court of
Appeals, a statute of Puerto Rico is not a statute of
the United States.
I should think, therefore, that the Fornaris case,
together with the language of the statute itself, should lead
to the conclusion that this Court has no jurisdiction of the
appeal.If there is a court below which can be reviewed here,
and I think there is, then the papers should be considered by
the Court as a petition for certiorari.
I will turn next to the second, and in some ways
the major question involved here, although all are important.,
the question of the constitutional validity of the District of

42
Columbia Court Reorganisation .Act.

In

approaching this question as other questions, the

Constitution should, of course, not be thought of as a
mathematical equation or as some kind of a computer program.

As

it lias been said, in largest part, the Constitution

is not a charter of liberties, but a blueprint for a Federal
system of Government, and the District of Columbia is in some
ways the keystone of the Federal system.
Marvelous as was the work of the Founding Fathers
in Philadelphia in 1787, there were some things that they did
not fully foresee or spell out in detail.

And it has been

this Court's task to work these problems out.
This particular area of the interplay of Article III
and Article I has a sort of academic flavor to it, and it may
be an understatement to say that it ha3 not always received
wholly consistent treatment from this Court.
Decisions have been made by divided Courts, sometimes
without a majority, and statements can be found in the opinions
to support almost any position.
I have, myself, been burned once in this area.
In 1929, this Court decided E& parte Bakelite Corporation in
279 U.S., a unanimous decision, with the opinion written by
Mr. Justice Vandervanter who was an acknowledged authority on
constitutional procedure, and I would have to differ with
Mr. Flegal when he said there wasn’t even a dictum which said

43

that there could be Article 1 courts in the District of
Columbia,because that opinion discussed the opinion in
ess ten so, and concluded that the courts of the District of
Columbia were Article 1 courts.
How, it is true that the issue in the case was the
status of the then Court of Customs Appeals, and so it,
therefore, is a dictum and not a decision, but it was the
clearest sort of considered dictum.
These courts were then known as the Supreme Court
of the District of Columbia and the United States Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia.
The case also considered the Court of Claims.
And, for clear and cogent reasons, based on long
outstanding precedents, the court found that all of these
tribunals were validly established under Article 1 of the
Constitution.
It was only four years later that the case of
O’Donoghue and of Williams

came before this Court.

I was then a junior in the Department of Justice
and was one of those who wrote the brief for the United
States in these cases.
The question was whether the judges of these courts
were protected by the provision in Article III which aays
that the salaries of the judges cannot be reduced during their
term in office.

44
Under the circumstances, we did not brief the
question extensively, but relied on the comprehensive treatment
In the Bakellte case*
As things worked out, this Court’s Bakellte
decision proved to be a slender reed as far as the District
of Columbia was concerned, for Judge O’Donoghue was held to fee
entitled to his salary.
Judge Williams was not so furtunate, but he was
vindicated more than thirty years later with the aid of an
intervening Act of Congress establishing both the Gourt of
Claims and the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals as Article
III courts.
The sands have been shifting in this area, but I
do not think they have shifted enough, or that they should be
shifted enough to invalidate the District of Columbia Court
Reorganisation Act.
The approach in this field, it seems to me, should
be that suggested by Mr. Justice Harlan in an opinion he wrote
in an analogous case.
The case was Reid v. Covert, involving the validity
of a trial by Court Martial of a woman who had murdered her
Air Force husband at an air base in England.
His words,which I do not cite as authority but only
for their indication of an approach to this case, were directly
applicable to trials overseas.

45
As applied to this case, they would read:

"In other

words, what Ross and the other cases hold is that the par­
ticular local setting, the practical necessities and the
possible alternatives are relevant to a question of judgment
on questions such as these."
And, he continued, "X think the above thought is
crucial in approaching the cases before us.

Decision is easy

if one adopts the constricting view that these constitutional
guarantees, as a totality, do or do not apply."

r

i ■-

But for me, the question is which guarantees of the
Constitution should apply in view of the particular c ire um-~
stances, the practical necessities, and the possible alternative
which Congress had before it»

The question is one of judgment,

not of compulsion.
In considering this question of judgment, we note that
there is surely no constitutional requirement that all Federal
cases, all Federal criminal prosecutions, must be heard by
Article III courts.
The Constitution establishes no inferior Federal
courts at all, but leaves that entirely to Congress»
In Australia, for example, there are no Federal
courts.

All Commonwealth criminal prosecutions are conducted

in the State courts.

We might well have such a system here.

Except for a period of one year, Congress provided
no Federal courts with Federal question jurisdiction until 1875»

46
Even today, many Federal question eases cannot be
heard in Article III courts if they do not meet the jurisdic­
tional amount established by Congress.

caF.es

That means that these

must be heard by State courts, almost none of which meet

the Article III test as to tenure and non-reduction of salary.
From the very earliest days of the Republic, Congress
provided for the trial of many criminal cases in State courts.
These are listed and cited in the two articles by Charles
Warren, which appear on page 29 of our brief, and I would like
to make a correction here.
Wear the bottom of page 29 is cited the article of
Charles Warren in 37 Harvard Law Review.

It says page 49, and

then on the next line 54?-55.
When I came to look at page 54-55, I couldn't find
anything about this, and the correct reference should be 70-71.
As recently as Testa v, Katt. decided shortly after
World War II, the Court held that the States must entertain
suit3 arising under a Federal statute, the Price Control Act.
As long ago as 1828, Chief Justice Marshall recognissc
the necessity of legislative courts.

In American Insurance Co.

v. Canter, that case involved the validity of a judgment
rendered by a territorial court in Florida, the judges of which
— and they are referred to in the opinion as a notary and
five jurors, but apparently the notary
years.

was appointed for four

47
The great Chief Justice held that the judgment was
valid, saying that the Florida court could not receive Article
III judicial power, but that it was a legislative court
validly established by Congress under its power in Article I
and in Article IV, Section 3, tp, make laws for the property
and territory of the United States.
It was a necessary basis for this decision that the
requirements of Article III are not applicable to such courts,
And in the intervening years, there have been many
examples of such courts.
When the Territory of Orleans was established
in 1804, its judges were given four-year terms, and this was
generally the case during the whole process of developing the
Western Territories of the United States.
This is true today of the Commonwealth courts in
Puerto Rico, and of the local courts in Guam and the Virgin
Islands.
In American Samoa and the Trust Territory of the
Pacific, there are today judges for whom the statute simply
says that they are designated by the President,and he can,and
he recently has,simply changed the designation and put in
another person as the judge in American Samoa.
This Court has many times entertained appeals from
these outlying courts, without any question as to their valid
e stablishment.

Reynolds v. United Btotea,in 98 U.S., was on error
to the Supreme Court of the Territory of Utah and the cruel
and unusual punishment case, Weems v» United States, in
217 U.S., was on a writ of error to the Supreme Court of the
Philippine Islands, not an Article III court.
Q

Didn’t we have a case within the last five or sis

years from the Canal Zone, involving a destruction of property
down there?
MR. GRISWOLD:

Yes, Mr. Justice, but the case was

here on review of a judgment of the Court of Claims.

The

question arose in the Canal Zone but it — if we are thinking
of the same case — it was a suit in the Court of Claims to
recover from the United States on the ground that the United
States had seised the building as part of the defense of the
Zone.
I*.;*-'-",*-'ft1

Q

During disorder down there.
MR. GRISWOLD:

I have looked for cases from the Canal

Zone that got to this Court.

There are many which have come to

the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, and a good many which were
petitioned for certiorari and have been filed and denied, not
on jurisdictional grounds, but I couldn’t find one which had
been entertained on the merits from the Canal Zone.
Q
tenure?

How are the judges in the Canal Zone?

What is their

How are they appointed?

MR. GRISWOLD:

All I can tell you is it is not life

49
tenure.
Q

I know they are usually from Kentucky»
(laughter)
MR* GRISWOLD:

Whether it is four years or tea

years ~Well, now, besides the territorial courts, there
were for many years consular courts, held to be validly
established in in re Ross in 140 U.S.
Now, very likely the Ross case would not be followed
now because there weren’t really judges there, just consular
officers, and they acted as prosecutor, judge and jury, at
least formally.
The objection to In re Ross is essentially one of
due process, though, and not of Article III,and this was taken
care of in 1906 when there was established a United States
Court for China, with power to review consular decisions and
to handle all of these cases for all of China,
The judge of this Court, and I can tell you this,
Mr. Justice, the judge of this Court was appointed for ten
years and he could be removed by the President for cause the
statute said.
For many years, the judge was a man named Lubingeer
and I used to see him from time to time in Washington„
apparently, he wasn’t too busy in China.

He did a good deal

of legal writing, including some about the United States Court

50
for China.
I have not been able to find that any ease from that
court came to this Court for review, but there is at least one
reported review of a criminal case in the United States Court
of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, this is Biddle v. United States
in 156 Federal, not F. 2nd, 156 Federal.
for taking money by false pretenses.

It was a prosecution

The defendant was con»

vieted and sentenced to a year in the jail in Shanghai and
on appeal this was reversed, not because of any defect in the
court but because the Appellate Court concluded that the facts
alleged in the charge did not constitute false pretenses.
Now, these instances are enough to show that Federal
questions, including criminal charges, need not be inevitably
heard only by courts which are established with Article III
guarantees.
State courts do not meet that test.

There were

United States criminal prosecutions in State courts in the very
early days of the Republic,
Territorial courts do not meet that test.
Consular courts don't meet the test.
I might even add that regularly established United
States courts do not meet that test when a judge sits under
a recess appointment.
Yet, I am unaware of any decision which says that a
judgment rendered in such a case is invalid because the Article

51
III guarantees have not been met.
Now, it can be said, well, there is a special
constitutional provision about recessed appointments, but so
is there a special constitutional provision with respect to the
territories of the United States and with respect to the
District of Columbia.
Q

Does your position inquire of the overruling of

0?Donoghue or not?
MR. GRISWOLD:
Q

No, not at all.

Because ?
MR. GRISWOLD:

Because we have today the United

States District Court and the United States Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia Circuit, which not only are,
undoubtedly, but as I will show a little later are by the
express statement of Congress, Article III courts.
Q

You say these are just different courts and judges

than were involved in 0 * Donoghue ?
MR. GRISWOLD:

These judges,here, of the Superior

Court are of a different court and of a different quality of
judges than those involved in 0 * Donoghue.
In 0fDonoghue, the District Courts of the United
States for the District of Columbia, the judges perform
essentially the same function that the District Court judges
do throughout the country.
Q

And you think that these particular courts and judges

32
involved here would have passed muster under Q'Donoghue, if
the}/ had been before the court in Q'Donoghue ?
MR. GRISWOLD:

I feel fairly sure of that,

Mr, Justice, although it is a long time ago and it is a hard
field to be sure of anything in.

At the time 0*Db,noghue was

decided, there was either the Municipal Court of the District
of Columbia or the Court of General Sessions,

I don't know

when the transition was made to that which had extensive
jurisdiction, including criminal jurisdiction —
Minor cases.
MR. GRISWOLD:
one year.

I think limited to imprisonment for

But imprisonment for one year, as a number of this

Court's decisions hold, is taken quite seriously, and there
was no intimation that those courts were Article III courts,
were anything but Article I courts.
«

My question doesn't go so far as Mr. Justice White's,
Does your position require, do you think, at least some with­
drawal from some of the language in 0;Donoghue ?
MR. GRISWOLD:

Mo, Mr. Justice.

I do not think so

at all.
I don't think that O'Donoghue was dealing, A, with
inferior courts in the United States, nor with courts which
were given solely local jurisdiction,
Mow, it is said by Mr. Flegal that this case is
different from all the ones I have mentioned,

It involves a

53
district, within the confines of the United States, now
embracing an area which was once within the State of Maryland
and subject to all the constitutional guarantees.
Of course, there was no guarantee in Maryland that
the judges of the State courts, having jurisdiction over the
general run of crimes, would have guarantees like those provided
by Article III, and except for four States today, c^r State
judges who handle all the ordinary criminal and civil business
in the country, do not have such guarantees.
But the District is in the United States, not outside
of it, and, therefore, it is said the Article III guarantees
must apply,
I find it hard to see why there is any basis for a
"therefore" there, because it i6 perfectly plain that the
constitution is and always has been applicable to the incorporated territories, as so decided by this Court, and that
many provisions of the Constitution are applicable to the
unincorporated territories as was involved in We eta v, United
States,
The insurer in the American Insurance case was an
American corporation and it lost its cotton,and Reynolds was
an American citizen, and he was convicted of bigamy by a court
which did not have Article III guarantees, and that conviction
was affirmed by this Court.
With respect to the

54

Q

Was bigamy a felony?
MR. GRISWOLD:

I assume it was.

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

With respect to the District of Columbia, it was
for many years thought, and generally understood, and I say that
without any hesitation,

it was for many years and generally

understood, I think right down to the day the 0IDonoghue case

.

was decided, that all of the courts here were established
under Article I.
It was on that basis that they were given various
administrative powers.

It was felt, going back to the very

earliest decisions of this Court, that Article III courts
could not be assigned non-judicial functions, and it was on
that basis that it was felt that all of the District of
Columbia courts must be Article I courts because they appointed
members of the school board and they reviewed decisions of the
patent office which did not result in final judgments, and they
did various things which it was then understood that Article III
judges could not do.
Certainly this Court understood that they were all
Article I courts when it decided the Bakelite case in 1929.
Mow, the Bakelite case is perhaps somewhat underplayed here..
It is fairly far back in the stream of history on this thing,
but the Bakelite case represented an understanding which, I
think, was general over a period of 50 or 75 years.
It was only under the pressure of a salary reduction

55
question, which conceivably might have affected the result,
that this Court saw a new light in 1933, and that light was
not bright enough then to iluminate the Court of Claims.
Moreover, from the beginning, there have always
been Article I courts and judges in the District, Justice;®
of the peace, Police Court, Municipal Court, and, more
*

recently, the Court of General Sessions, courts with limited
jurisdiction, to be sure, but surely exercising judicial
power, including substantial jurisdiction in criminal cases.
And if the judicial power of the United States can
only be given to Article III courts, those courts and all
the acts under them were surely invalid.
It is said that the District is different from the
territories because they were transitory, while the District
is permanent.
It is not clear why this makes a difference under
Article III.

Article III doesn’t say anything about transitory

or permanent.
But as to the transitory jiature of the territories,
we have had Puerto Rico and Guam and American Samoa now for
75 years, and the Virgin Islands now for more than 55 years.
It is said that they are distant, but it takes only
a couple of hours to get from here to

— get from Washington

to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, and there is instant
communication with all of these places.

56

The people there are eitisens of the United States,
no less and no more than those of the District of Columbia,
Moreover, the Government of the District is not
changeless.

There is a great deal of current talk about home

rule,and changes in Congress may mean that this is more likely
f

than it once was.
There is also talk about Statehood,

There would be

a considerable problem in achieving changes such as these if
it should be concluded that they should be brought about if
more than 50 judges on the two courts below, in this case,
had to be provided for life.
And it should not be overlooked that this statute
was enacted by the Congress as a result of a clear crisis in
the District Court of the United States for the District of
Columbia, which was simply overwhelmed by the volume of its
criminal business.

Practically all of the judges were sitting

on criminal cases all of the time and the ordinary work of
the District Courts could not be carried forward, and the
Congress provided this means greatly to expand the number of
judges in the District of Columbia assigned to deal with local
crimes and civil matters of the same sort that are dealt with
by State courts in the States.
It would be a bit bisarre, if the District of Columbia
became a State, to say that the 50 judges of these too courts
below must be given life tenure if the State court judges

57
established by the State under Statehood, trying the same
kinds of cases, would not have to have Article III guarantees.
The Congress expressly grants — the Constitution
expressly grants the Congress in Article I, Clause 17, power
to exercise exclusive jurisdiction in all cases whatsoever.
And,really»what could be more comprehensive?
jurisdiction,in all cases whatsoever9

Exclusive

over the District that

is accepted as the seat of Government of the United States.
This Court has said that this is a plenary power.
There is no doubt that the District is different from other
parts of the country, both legally and practically.
Until recently changed by Constitutional Amendment,
residents of the District did not have that most elemental
right in a democracy, the right to vote.

They still have

no representation in the Senate and no voting representation
in the House, though these bodies pass •

the laws that govern

the District and levy the taxes that are applicable here.
Congress has always had special powers here, and has
always exercised them.
In this case, it moved expressly under Article I,
the very first section of the District of Columbia Court
Reorganisation Act, Section 11-101, and this, unfortunately,
us not printed in our brief.

I think it should have been, and

I want to bring it particularly to the Court's attention.
The very first section provides as follows

58
Q

May I have that number again?
MR. GRISWOLD:

Q

Section 11-101.

Thank you,
MR. GRISWOLD:

Of the D.C. Gode, that would be,

of the Court Reorganisation Act in the B.C. Code.
It provides that the courts of the District of
Columbia are as follows:
"Established under Article III:
"1) The Supreme Court of the United States;
2) The United States Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit; 3) The District Court of the United States."
And, then continuing, quoting the statute:
"Established under Article I:
"1) The District of Columbia Court of Appeals;
2) The Superior Court of the District of Columbia,"
Thus, Congress made it explicit that it knew it was
acting under Article I, that it intended to act under Article
I and that Article I was the basis for the authority which it
was seeking to exercise in establishing the two courts below
in this case.
(Whereupon, at 12:00 o'clock, noon, the oral argument
recessed, to reconvene at 1:00 o'clock, p.m., the same
day.)

59
AFTERNOON SESSION
(1:00 p.m.)

MR* CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Solicitor General,

you may proceed.
MR, GRISWOLD:

Before resuming the main thread of

my argument, I would like to refer to a memorandum which
Mr. Flegal has quite properly filed with the Court, calling
attention to a new edition of the Hart and Weschler case book
about Federal Courts and particularly to a paragraph of a note
which appears on page 397 of that note.
I would like simply to suggest to the Court that they
read the entire note and not just that paragraph on page 397.
Among other things, Mr. Battar, who is the author of
this part, says, in paragraph 1, *’ Notice that the line'of
argument made above does not in itself assert that Congress
has unlimited power to assign Federal judicial business to
Federal legislative courts.

It simply asserts that Article III

does not rigidly preclude Congress from exercising some
flexibility in allocating that judicial business and that
Congress may make a particular allocation to a non-Article III
tribunal if functional considerations serving a valid legisla­
tive purpose justify it, and it there is adequate provision for
judicial review."
Well, here, there is provision for judicial review
in all cases to this. Court which is an Article III court.

60
And then, I would like to say that nothing in our
position requires the Court to overrule or to disapprove any­
thing decided in the Q*Donoghue case.

The courts there were

held to be both Article XXI and Article I courts, but there
was nothing there which held that Congress could not create
courts, under Article I, to deal with local matters only.
Q

This may be a reference to (inaudible), Mr. Solicitor

General, but do you think the majority of the O’Donoghue court
would have decided this case the way the District of Columbia
Court of Appeals did?
MR. GRXSHOLD:

Mr. Justice, if I may put it this way,

I think the majority of the court that decided the Q’Donoghue
case, if it were here in 1973, would decide this case the way
that X suggest.
In 1933, when they were deciding it, they didn’t have
the history that had developed.

The courts established the

declaration of Congress that it was creating these courts under
Article X.
If all of those provisions had been before the court
in 1933, then my answer would be yes, that they would have
accepted these.
Let me — I mention some of the practical problems
before Congress in legislating here, the difficulty of giving
life tenure to 50 or 60 judges, which were needed, but there
is al£3G another practical problem, that of phasing in the

61
judges under the old system Into the new.
The judges of the Court of General Sessions had not
been appointed as Article III judges and a

means of making the

transition was to establish Article X courts.
And, then, we do not contend that Congress could
create courts generally under Article I to sit all over the
country, though I would refer to the United States Tax Court,
which again, Congress has avowedly created under Article X,
without life tenure, and it does sit all over the country, but
it has no criminal jurisdiction.
Congress could not displace the Article III courts
in the States by establishing Article I courts with general
jurisdiction, or by a series of Article I courts under the
Commerce power and the taxing power and other powers.
Our position is simply that Congress has broader
powers over Governmental organisation in the District than
it has in the States.
Now, let me turn to the final subject involved in
the case, the question of the seizure.
This is one of considerable importance to the
Government, and I hope that I have not left it buried under
a mass of technicalities in presenting the other questions
involved.
The basic question is whether a policeman may make a
selective stop of a motorist for the purpose of checking his

52
driver’s license and registration certificates»
The District of Columbia law requires an operator
to have these papers in his possession, or in the automobile,
and that must mean something.

It is not just ceremony that

he is to have the papers in his possession.

They are to be

there so that they can be shown on proper occasions.
Unless they can be checked by police officers, there
is no way to tell whether motor vehicles, which are surely
dangerous instrumentalities, are being validly operated.
Here, the check was when the police officer could
fell from the license plate that the car was a rental car.
He knew that many rental cars were held overtime, which is
unlawful, or were stolen.
In this case, the whole rental agreement did, indeed,
indicate that the car was overdue, though this was straightened
out when inquiry was made.
There is no allegation that the police officer acted
improperly, that is, in a violent or a viciousimanner.
Q

Could the judgments of the Tax Court be reviewed

here correctly?
MR. GRISWOLD:

They could be since 1970 when it was

established as a court,
Q

Yes, but before that when it was an Article I court?
MR. GRISWOLD:

It is an Article I court now and they

can be reviewed here, just as territorial judgments can be

63
reviewed.
Q

Because, even though it is not an exercise of

Article III judicial power that they are exercising?
MR. GRISWOLD:

The Court tea always held that it is

an exercise of judicial power in that there is appellate
jurisdiction to review the decisions of the territorial courts
established under Article I.
Q

So, we have, then, we have jurisdiction here, then,

over District of Columbia court judgments, whether those courts
are exercising judicial power or not?
MR. GRISWOLD:

Wo, only if it is exercising judicial

power, but regardless of whether it is under Article III or
Article I.
Q

All right.

Whether or not we are exercising an

Article III judicial —
MR. GRISWOLD:

That is correct.

Prior to 1971, Mr. Justice, the Tax Court “«-in the
first place, it was the Board of Tax Appeals, and then it
was established as a Tax Court — but because of a curious
history, the statute expressly provided that it is an independent agency in the Executive Branch of the Government, and that
lasted until 1970.
And, during that time, it was quite clear that this
Court could not review a decision of the Tax Court, Indeed,
there is a case back 30 years ago involving a certificate from

a Court of Appeals with respect to a question from the lass
Court, and, incidentally, X may say this Court was always very
careful never to remand a decision to the Tax Court.

It always

remanded it to the Court of Appeals for remand to the Tax
Court,
But, here, there was nothing discriminatory in this
stop.

Many citizens would welcome it as evidence that the

police were doing their duty.
Incidentally, the Statute of the District of
Columbia does not say that a policeman may stop a car, but it
does say that expressly, that any individual to whom has been
issued a permit to operate a motor vehicle shall have such
permit in his immediate possession at all times when operating
a motor vehicle in the District and shall exhibit such permit
to any police officer when demand is made therefor.
This case, we think, is like the Biswell case where
people were licensed to deal in firearms, and this Court held
that they were subject to inspection, indeed, said that if it
is to be effective and serve as a credible deterrent, unannounced
even frequent, inspections are essential.
If a motorist chooses to drive pursuant to a license
for which he has applied, he does so with the knowledge that
he may be required at any time to establish that he is doing
so in conformity with the law.
Under the circumstances, such checks pose, at most,

65
only limited threats to the motorists' privacy, and no threat
which is not justified by his acceptance of the license and
the operation under it.
I note that persons who wish to enter this courtroom
have to submit themselves to an inspection which includes the
opening of parcels and the opening of ladies* handbags.
I would not suppose there was any question about
that, and X see no basis for question in the light of the
District of Columbia Statute with respect to the request for
licenses in this case.
If the stop was proper, the protective action of
Officer Morrissette in looking to see if there were any
weapons available, wa3 clearly proper under the general
rationale of Terry v. Ohio, and the search should be sustained.
If the Court reaches the merits of the case, die
judgment of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals should be
affirmed.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Solicitor

General.
Mr. Flegal, we will allow you six minutes, enlarging
your time a little bit.
MR. FLEGAL:

I appreciate that, Your Honor.

66
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK F. FLEGAL, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. FLEGAL:

It seems to me that the one central

point that is now involved in the ease, as the positions of the
parties have crystalised, is whether or not the citizens of
the District of Columbia stand on a different footing, insofar
gs Article III safeguards and protections are concerned, from

citizens in the several States«
He think the answer to that dispositive question is
no.
He rely, first, upon the fact that the Constitution
required the District of Columbia to be carved out of the
several States.
Q

The District does stand on a different basis with

respect to the powers of Congress.
MR. FLEGAL:

Oh, clearly, Your Honor.

The legislature which enacts the laws for the
citizens of the District of Columbia and, of course, those who
come into the District of Columbia, is Congress, or whatever
local legislature —
Q

And it is a question of how far that difference

extends in this case,I suppose?
MR. FLEGAL:

That is a legislative difference.

suggest it has no extension to Article III safeguards and
protections.

He

As I was indicating, the District of Columbia had
to be cawed out of the several States.
That was a factor which this Court found dispositive
in the Q'Donoghue opinion upon which we place heavy reliance,
and I would respectfully disagree with the Solicitor General,
but I think if Appellant does not prevail in this case, at
least some of the language, some of the Article III theory,
of the rights and the benefits set forth in the O'Bonoghue
\

.

,

opinion, would have to be rejected or retreated from.
Q

Did you read the seventeenth clause of Section 8,

Article 1,

the legislative power of Congress over the District

is narrower, is less broad, than the legislative power of a
State in creating its own organs of Government?
MR. FLEGAL:

Precisely, Your Honor.

And the difference is the difference between the
Fourteenth Amendment which is the States' Federal const!tutIonai
restriction on a State legislature and the Bill of Rights and
the original Constitution on Congress.
Q

You say it is also narrower than the power over a

territory?
MR. FLEGAL:

Yes, indeed so, sir.

Indeed so.

And I say that because this Court has so held.
Many rights which citizens of a State and which do
not fetter a State's legislature's judgment, the Seventh
Amendment right to a trial by jury in a civil case, the Sixth

Amendment, an Article 111 right to a jury trial in a criminal
case, and the Fifth Amendment Grand Jury right, are applicable
to local offenses in the District of Columbia.
To chat extents we submit -Q

And in the territories.
MU. FLEGAL:

And in the territories, Your Honor,

depending upon whether or not the territory has been incorporate 1
or not and whether it is deemed fundamental, or not.
Those are —
Q

With respect to territories, you needn’t have an

Article III court, is that it?
MR. FLEGAL:

It has been assumed, Your Honor.

I know of no case in this Court which has ever
squarely so held.
Q

It still wouldn’t make any difference to you?
MR. FLEGAL:

Your Honor,

It would make no difference to me.

lie would subnit that the citizen before the

Federal court in the District of Columbia charged with a felony
is entitled to precisely the same constitutional rights and
safeguards as a citizen charged for a Federal felony before
a Federal tribunal in one of the several States.
And we think the Framers did accomplish something
by the “good behavior” clause of the Constitution, something
benefited to the litigants.
Q

You are giving the residents of the District of

69
Columbia something more than residents of Maryland and
Virginia.
MR. FLEGAL:

I am giving the residents of the

District of Columbia precisely the same as I would give the
resident of Maryland, that is —
Q

Let me put it to you this way, there are felonies

in the State of Maryland or in the State of Virginia, as to
which the residents of those States or any person apprehended
there and charged, would not get an Article III court, isnft
that true ?
MR. FLEGAL:
Q

Correct.

Indeed so, Your Honor.

So, in that sense, you are suggesting that the

residents of the District of Columbia get something that
residents of no other State have.

MR.
tribunals.

FLEGAL:

When tried before their StaM

>•., v

They get precisely the same when tried before the

Federal tribunals.
Q

Except to the extent there is comparable tenure in

Massachusetts and several other States.
MR, FLEGAL:

Several other States.

But that is a

question — a fact on which we place no reliance for our
proposition.
What we are saying is the citizen in the District of
Columbia gets rights which the State court would not have to
afford him sitting in Maryland, the Grand Jury indictment, the

70
jury, and we submit: the ”gaod behavior” judge.
Q

Or even if the State Court was trying for a Federal

crime.
MR. FLEGAL:

That's the arguendo assumption, Your

Honor, of the Government’s.

We think that goes too far and

that there are serious problems if Congress ever passed the
hypothetical legislation that the Governcaent State court
argument rests upon.
This Court has confronted some of those problems in
the Seventh Amendment context, with State courts trying Federal
civil actions, and has, in some cases, the Federal Employer
Liabilities Act, and so forth., He implied as part of the
remedy some part of the Seventh Amendment jury protection, but
that is not our argument.
We assume,arguendo with the Government, that if
State Courts could constitutionally try Federal crimes,
Fourteenth Amendment protections would apply.
Our proposition is purely a limitation on exercise
of the Federal judicial power.
If the Court has no further questions, tie submit that
the judgment of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals
should be reversed, either with directions to remand this case
for a new trial before a constitutional court, or, in the
..I

alternative, to reverse and remand for either a new trial or
a judgment of acquittal excluding the evidence which we challeng

t

Thank you, Your Honors.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Flegal.

Thank you, Mr. Solicitor General.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at i:!5 o'clock, p.m., the oral
arguments in the above-entitled case were concluded.)
