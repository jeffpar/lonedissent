MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Korman, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD R. KORMAN, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR, KORMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice.

May it please the

Court:
The United States appeals from a judgment of the
District Court for the Eastern District of Neiv York striking
down as unconstitutional an act of Congress which required
the payment of a $50 filing fee as a condition to a grant of
a discharge in bankruptcy.
The District Court held that the statute and the
orders in bankruptcy promulgated by this Court which provide
that the filing fee may be paid out over a period of nine
months — up to nine months in installments after the filing
of the petition — were unconstitutional as applied to an
assetless debtor who alleged that, due to his poverty, he was
unable to promise to pay the filing fee, even In installments.
Although the District Court ordered that the
discharge be granted, he indicated that the obligation to
pay the $50 filing fee should survive the discharge and be
paid when and If the petitioner in bankruptcy was able to
afford it.

4
The District Court also held that the Federal In
Forma Pauperis Statute, 28 United States Code 1915(a) i-ras
inapplicable here since Congress plainly manifested Its
intent to abolish In Forma Pauperis proceedings in bankruptcy
and substitute in its place a system of installment payments.
The United States Intervened in the District
Court to defend the constitutionality of the statute and the
District Court granted a stay of the order of discharge
pending the resolution of.this appeal.
The briefs and the opinions below understandably
dwell on what It Is that this Petitioner In bankruptcy has
been deprived of as the result of his inability to pay the
$50 filing fee, but I think it is important that the Issues —
I think that the Issues raised here can be seen in their
proper perspective only by first examining what it Is that
Congress has given an Indigent, assetless Petitioner in
bankruptcy despite his inability to pay this $50 filing fee.
Initially, It must be observed that no longer as
far as an indigent debtor is concerned, this Is no longer a
filing fee that we are talking about.
Under the statute, the Petitioner in bankruptcy
may file his petition without paying any fee at all,
provided that he Indicates how he proposes to pay that
filing fee in Installments for up to six months and the period
may be extended for yet an additional three months.

5
Nov;, that filing of the bankruptcy petition
carries significant legal consequences.

He is automatically

adjudged to be a bankrupt and as a result, all of his
earnings following the filing of the petition are exempt
from his creditors and so what Congress has, in effect,
said to an assetless debtor, said, "If you feel that you
have earnings that you want to immunize from the reach of
your creditors, you can file your petition.

You will have

up to nine months to pay and as those earnings which you
expect and anticipate come in, you will pay up this $50
filing fee over a period of up to nine months.” J
,

j-

And 1 should point out that in actuality, the
filing fee, as far as assetless debtors go is really $40.
$10 goes to the Trustee and since there is an assetless
debtor, there is no need for a Trustee.
On the other hand, if -— as this Petitioner
alleges —- he does not anticipate any incomej he doesn’t
anticipate sufficient income to pay out this $50 or $40
at a sum of about a dollar a week, then Congress may
rightly inquire why it is that he needs this discharge to
begin with.
That is, the discharge becomes meaningful only
when the possibility of additional assets and Income becomes
a reality and when those additional assets become a reality,
then the $50 filing gee does not present any impediment at

6
a.li to such an assetless debtor.
Q

This men was on Welfare, right?

MR. KORMAN:
Q

That is correct.

And if 1 understand Welfare correctly, you

get enough money to live on, period.
MR. KORMAN:
Q

That is correct.

Well, where is he going to get $60?

MR. KORMAN:

What I am saying. Justice Marshall,

if he doesn't, as he says, expect to get any income, his
Welfare benefits are exempt from his creditors so that what
he is saying is, ,!I want a discharge."

The reason a person

wants a discharge is so that any future earnings, nonexempt
earnings —*
Q

Some time after six months..
•

MR. KORMAN:

••**-**

,

'•'*•

•

Well, what, in effect Congress is

saying is that when you need it, come and we will let you
file your petition and when those earnings that you expect
and want to immunize become a reality, as those earnings come
in, you can pay us out this $40 over a period of six to
nine months.
On the other hand, if he appears on January 1st
and he says, "I don’t expect to have any income for the next
six months,” why is it, the Congressman may rightly ask why
it is that this gentleman needs a discharge to begin with.
Q

On the other hand, why is the reason he can’t

7
get it?
MR. KORMAN:
Q

Because he doesn’t have $50s period.

MR. KORMAN:
Q

Right —

That is the only reason.

MR. KORMAN:
Q

Congress has decided —

That is correct.

That is the only reason.

MR, KORMAN:

Correct.

Congress has decided that

those who benefit from the operation of the bankruptcy
system ought to contribute a small portion' of the cost of
operating it.

As a matter of fact, while the Congress

initially intended that the bankruptcy system be selfsufficient and self-supporting, because of the increased
costs and the failure of Congress to increase the fee, the
bankruptcy system is now running at a deficit.
But nevertheless, Congress has a legitimate interest
Q
year.

The deficit is around a million dollars a

It is a great big deficit, Isn't it?
MR. KORMAN:
Q

That's a big one.

MR. KORMAN:
Q

That is correct.

It is.

But for many years it did —

MR. KORMAN:

It did operate up until I believe

1968, it operated at a substantial surplus.

At the moment it

is operating at a deficit and Congress is, in fact,

8
considering now that it is operating at a deficit, perhaps
repealing It.

But this decision to abandon In Forma

Pauperis petitions in bankruptcy which was made in 19^8 was
based on a Congressional finding of what happened during the
years when their In Forma Pauperis applications were
available.
What had happened was, in those years, while you
couldn't get In Forma Pauperis treatment in bankruptcy, the
referees were paid and received their salary only out of the
fees that they actually collected.

The referees, then,

would allow the petitioner to file his petition but simply
refuse to grant them th® discharge until they were paid.
What Congress found is that in almost every case,
given a period of time in which to pay out the filing fees,
they were almost invariably paid and so Congress said, that
seems to us to be a much better procedure for handling these
In Forma Pauperis petitions.
ruptcy file his petition.

Let the petitioner in bank­

We will give him up to nine months

to pay and theh he can obtain his discharge.
In essence, this was really a reasonable substitute
for the In Forma Pauperis proceedings and, in practice, it
does not operate harshly.

In practice, the only test of

whether you get a discharge or not is need.
That is, if you need the discharge because you
expect income, you can file your petition without paying

9
anything and as that Income which you anticipate comes in,
you can pay out this filing fee.
On the other- hand, if you as the petitioner, do
not expect to have any income to pay this $50, then you really
don't need the discharge and, in effect, Congress is really
saying our bankruptcy courts are overburdened as it is.

When

you need the discharge we will give it to you.
Now, I think this legislative program Is a perfectly
reasonable effort on the part of Congress to compromise
between on the one hand, the indigent debtor and on the
other hand its desire to see that' those who benefit from a
particular legislative program contribute to its cost.
I-think, clearly,, there is a rational basis for
this classification and, certainly, no basis to strike It
down on equal

protection grounds as the District Court

apparently did and as a matter of fact —
Q

Did you say that the District Court — and I

just reread it, sort of glanced over its decision again —

I can't find it in here — that the District Court held that
the $50 fee was not itself dischargeable in bankruptcy and
would remain —
MR. KORMAN:
Q

— the liability of the debtor?

MR. KORMAN:

Q

That is correct.

That is correct.

I ju3t didn't see that in its opinion

10
MR. KORMAN:

I think it is near the last page or

two in its opinion — which the District Court said that.

I

think that is an implicit recognition of the reasonableness
..'I 5 ; V

of the statute and, indeed, I don't think that it is clear
that the District Court did not find that this statue and
this classification was

unreasonable and 1 don’t understand

my adversary here to argue that with me.
Q

Well, it is just a question then of when

the

discharge comes, before or after the payment?
MR. KORMAN:
Q

That is correct.

But sooner or later he is going to have to

pay.
MR, KORMAN:

That is correct, although I don’t

know where the District Court thought he had the power to so
provide.
Q

I wonder, since you have now been interrupted,

since Congress has left it up to this Court in its general
order in bankruptcy to deal with the problem of installment
payments, whether or not an amended general order, a new
general order could deal with this problem in this case or
at least go far toward it?
MR. KORMAN:

I — I don’t think that is the case

because I believe the statute provides that you don’t get
the discharge until you actually pay the fees out in
installments.

11
Q

I thought you were talking about the statute

enacted in — what year?
MR. KORMAN:

The 1946 statute which I believe

appears at page 30 of our brief which provides that the Court
shall grant a discharge unless satisfied that the bankrupt
has failed to pay the filing fees required to be paid by
this type of court.
Q

Provideds however, that in cases of voluntary

bankruptcy —
MR. KORMAN:

No, provided the fees may be paid in

installments but the first ~
Q

If so authorized by general order of the

Supreme Court of the United States.
MR. KORMAN:

That is correct.

What I think the

Court can do is extend the period of time, make it a year
for the installments, but I don’t think the court —
Q

Could make it ten cent a year, I suppose.

MR. KORMAN:

Well, I suppose that is so‘.

There

is no limitation as I see it in the statute on the time
al3.otted for the petitioner to make the payments.
• ....v.», s'. .

Q

But you don't think that the court would

have power under this statute by general order to say that
there cou3.d be discharge prior to the payment of Uhe whole
*

:

'•

v- *

*V

$50?

MR. KORMAN:

No, I wouldn’t think so in the

12
particular portion of the statute that I refer to, the
Section 14C8 which appears right at the top of page 30.

Q

Yes.

But if you. string out the time for

paying the installments and keep the injunction against
suits in force3 you really, in effect, have a discharge.

MR. KORMAN:

That is correct and in effect, what

Congress, as I tried to point out earlier, in effect.
Congress is giving the indigent, assetless debtor the benefits
of the discharge while he pays out the money that is
involved here, a rather small sum.
Q

Well, is this case really worth arguing much

about?
MR. KORMAN:
Q

Well, I think there is —

I mean, if you can collect the fee some time,

or if you can extend the time and, in effect, get. a discharge
if...

by — you give

him two years at ten cents a week"' before

he gets his discharge.

MR. KORMAN:

Wo11, I

are

think what we

struck down as unconstitutional.

question.
•

.

I think that Is a serious

I realize that conceivably under the orders of

this Court the period of time in

• -

i. . J'■

:r {.V'

which a person has to

r-'iK-\

>\ '

pay it out could be extended for quite a lengthy period.
Nevertheless9 there may be a purpose on the part of Congress
as a matter of social policy merely to say that before you

13
get this particular benefit you muet contribute to the cost
of the operation of the bankruptcy system and, of course,
there Is an incentive where the petitioner Is getting Income
to get his discharge ultimately and I don’t think that if
he actually has the money and the

income is coming in, he is

not going to deliberately stall the payments of the money
and, of course, the court has discretion under this to put
a stop to any efforts on the part of the debtor where It
appears that he Is deliberately stalling and delaying the
payments.
Q

'

As a practical matter, aside from these

constitutional questions, when aid if — as Justice White
has suggested — the creditors are off of this man’3 back,
is It economically feasible to pursue a $50 item?
MR. KORMAN:
Q

Well —

On behalf of the government?

Mil. KORMAN:

I think at the moment that Is

precisely what Congress is studying, whether that is
economically feasible.

It is not economically feasible in

the sense that we can go out and check each and every case
to determine whether the petitions that are filed that are
requesting In Forma Pauperis treatment are true.

In effect,

In almost every case we have to accept all these allegations
as truthful.
Q

If you know, would you refresh my recollection

14
on either» policies or regulations of the Department of
' *. 1

Justice with respect to claims under certain amounts.

In

times past, has the Department not had a cut-off and said
we will not concern ourselves with claims under $100 or
under $200 or some fixed amount?
MR. KORMAN:

That may be, but I am just not certain,

your Honor.
The District Court held — did not hold, nor does
my friend here argue that this classification is unreasonable
or that it involves invidious discrimination.

What the

District Court held is that the government was required to
meet a compelling interest standard, relying on cases such
as Shapiro versus Thompson and we submit that those cases
are wholly Inapplicable here.
Those cases employ the compelling interest standard
where a particular classification infringed upon a fundamental
'■■*•**

i

constitutional right.

*

We are not dealing here with any

fundamental constitutional right.

Congress could repeal the

entire bankruptcy statute tomorrow or the discharge provisions
tomorrow without raising so much as a constitutional ripple.
What we have here is simply a benefit that is
provided by Congress and it is clearly improper to hold
that Congress must meet a compelling interest standard.
Q

Qf course, no state is constitutionally

required to have statutes permitting divorce, I suppose.

15
Isn't that true?
MR. .KORMAN:

Well5 I would qualify that by saying

that after Bo idle and perhaps Griswold versus Connecticut»
a state might not be able to wholly, arbitrarily deny a
divorce.

I would think that they —
Q

I don’t think there is anything.

I don’t

remember anything in Bcddle offhand that said a state has
to have provision for dissolution of marriage.
MR. KORMAN:
Q

Well, —

I remember that one state — I think It was

Mississippi — for years did not have any divorce laws.

You

had to — maybe in South Carolina, one of those states — you
had to get a special act of the state legislature to have a
divorce and I don’t know that anybody ever attacked that
situation from a constitutional point of view. —It was a
good many years ago.
MR. KORMAN:

I think that Is true.

I think in

Boddie there is a rather lengthy discussion of what is
involved in a divorce.
Q

Yes.

MR. KORMAN:
Q

As Justice

Harlan pointed out —

Yes, you know what It involved In a

MR. KORMAN:

divorce.

— you know it involves the dissolution

of a rather fundamental human relationship,
Q

It does indeed and a state might determine

16
that It Is not going to permit the dissolution of that
fundamental human relationship.
Q

Was it not central to Boddie that this was a

relationship which could not be dissolved in any other way
excpet by judicial action?
MR. KORMAN:

That is correct.

I think there were

two aspects of the Boddie holding* as there must be, since
Boddie was clue process» was decided under the due process
clause of the Fourteenth Amendment which, of course, provides
that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty or
property without due process of law. Due process required in
court,
/a hearing in court, as Mr. Justice Harlan held for the
Court, then it must have been because he decided that the
right to the dissolution of this fundamental human relationship was of liberty within the meaning of the Fourteenth
Amendment’s due process clause and v;e have the liberty

Yflfchin the meaning of the

due process clause and the state

saying that the only way you can get this essential liberty
ia to come into the courts.

You can’t write your spouse a

i,

letter and say we are divorcing.

You can’t agree to it.

So, in effect, what the state was saying in
divorce cases is that In order to get this fundamental
•

t

. ...

interest, this liberty under the Fourteenth Amendment, you
must come into our court, said Justice Harlan.
.

Under those
:.*•

■.

j.

circumstances the state could not condition the right to this

17
fundamental — right to dissolve this fundamental human
relationship.
Q

The debtor and the creditor can ---

MR. KORMAN;
creditor can.
debt.

That is correct.

The debtor and the

Theycan get together and compromise the

The debt can be simply discharged by operation of the

statute of limitations where there is no action taken to
enforce it and that is not a wholly unlikely situation.
Nobody is going to go after an assetless debtor.

They are

not going to waste as much as a nickel to attempt to enforce
their claim against him and as I read the petition in
bankruptcya he doesn’t really allege that anyone has
threatened suit against him* that he is being harassed — he
does say he is being harassed by his creditors, but the
harassment that he speaks of is simply in the way of
references with respect to his character rather than any
legal proceedings against him.
Q

So that —

Do you assume that people on welfare are not

harassed by creditors?
MR. KORMAN;
welfare are not.

No, I am not assuming that people on

I am assuming that people who are assetless

and who have as little as this petitioner claims that he
has — it would be somewhat foolish of a creditor to waste
his money in an attempt to invoke the judicial process to
obtain funds.

18
Q

I didn't say "judicial processj"

I said

"harassment," telephone calls.
MR. KORMAN:
Q

That may he true but I --

Lawyers' letters., everything you can name.

Welfare people are always harassed by creditors.

You recognize

that or not?
MR. KORMAN:

Yes.
»

Well, the harassment that I was speaking of was the
real situation of whether it would be likely that a debtor —
a creditor would bother, in effect, to go after him in a
judicial proceeding and attempt to get any money from him
since he is not working and he obviously has no assets.
And as a matter of fact, I think one of the major
debts about which this petitioner complains is a $1,000 debt
to the Metropolicat Life Insurance Company which he claims
they say he stole from them and therefore they have an
action of conversion against him.
Now, the New York statute of limitations for actions
f'

'

I

In conversion is three years.

According to the petition, this

conversion, act of conversion alleged act took place In
May of 1969.

Probably he has been discharged already by the

operation of the statute of limitations so that, unlike
Boddie — and I think there are two essential distinctions
here, both crucial points in Boddie.

In the first place, the

state has not monoploised the means of dissolving this

19
debtor-creditor

this particular relationship.

dissolved by the parties themselves.

It can be

The debt can be

compromised and, Indeed, it could be discharged simply by
inaction of the creditor over the period of time until the
statute of limitations runs out.
And in the second place, as far as an assetless
debtor goes, certainly the right that is involved here hardly
approaches the Importance and significance, the right of an
individual to decide whether he Is going to live with
another person In the institution of marriage and, indeed, the
right to remarry again and so that on those two essential
grounds, we feel that Boddle is inapplicable here and, Indeed,
I would point out that the District Court, although it
decided Boddle a good deal, did not really rely on the
language in Justice Harlan’s opinion but relied instead on the
concurring opinions

and on Justice Black’s dissent from the

denial of certiorari in the Garland case, which was a case
In which the First Circuit upheld the $50 filing fee and
this Court denied almost immediately after the decision in
Boddle and this opinion of Mr. Justice Black of the District
Court I believe decided, in effect,

unequlvocably stated that

he objected to the reasoning of the majority opinion in
t

'

Boddle.

And I think that it is quite clear that there is

very little in Boddle when it Is sounded in the context of
this case that supports Petitioner’s contention — the

20

Petitioner of bankruptcy's contention here.
Q

Mr. Korraan, on page 5 of the Appendix, as I
s *!:

read the Respondent's affidavit, he does state that one of
the reasons he wants to be able to file a petition 13 t.o
relieve creditor harassment so I suppose youwQuld have to
concede that there is harassment In fact and contend that it
may be a diminishing factor and at any rate it could be
settled in some other way.
MR. KORMAN:

1 think it is a diminishing factor.

I

think when read in context, when you look at the next sentence
that follows that.

The kind of harassment he was talking

about is the fact that Metropolitan Life Insurance Company,
whenever he gives that company as a reference to seek
employment, says to the prospective employer that this fellow
was a thief.

Now, how a discharge in bankruptcy is going to

help him, I don't know but if you look at page 13 of the
brief, what It says is that since Metropolitan-- now, if he
gets the discharge, says he, it is true that Metroploifcan
•\

will still continue to tell the prospective employers that
he is a thief, but, says he, since Metropolitan did not
appear before the referee to contest the debt, Appellee's
discharge in bankruptcy will not only erase this debt but
will hopefully remove the unwarranted stigma that operates
as an albatross around his ;neck because,

he says, Metro­

politan will have to explain why it is they did not appeal

21
in the bankruptcy court to contest the discharge.

I think

that is just plain silly.
Q

Mr. Korman, on that point, you said about when

he gets the money, that is when he could pay the $50 and
he should not file bankruptcy until he gets the money.
MR. KORMAN:
Q

Until he anticipates getting it.

Now, on this Metropolitan thing, assume it

is not barred by the statute and assuming Metropolitan next
year reduces that to a judgment, what can he do about that
20 years later when he gets enough money to go into
bankruptcy?
MR. KORMAN:

Well, as soon as he gets a job or is

offered a job he can come in and file his bankruptcy
petition and that will, in effect, immunize his earnings
after the petition is filed.
Q

How can he get a job with a $1,000 judgment

on him?
MR. KORMAN:

Well, I assume that — thinking about

it as a practical matter — if an employer was offering him
a job and said, "Well, you have this $1,000 judgment
against you, I’m not going to hire you."

He can say, "Well,

if that is the only impediment, I’ll file a bankruptcy
petition tomorrow and that will resolve the problem."
Q

I see.

Q

Mr. Korman, the petition states that the

22
Petitioner was falsely discharged by the insuran.ce company.
Does the record show whether or not he brought any action
against the insurance company?
MR. KORMAN:
Q

No, it doesn’t.

For false discharge?

MR. KORMAN:
Q

No, it doesn't.

Is that listed as a contingent asset in the

list of assets in bankruptcy?
MR. KORMAN: * Well, it was listed as a debt that
he wanted to have discharged.
Q
wouldn't it?

Well, I know it could have cut both ways,
Couldn’t it have been an asset in terms of a

i

damage suit against the employer alleged falsely to have
discharged him?
•v. ■"

•

t

MR. KORMAN:

Well, I don’t know, Mr. Justice Powell,

if New York allows such a course of action,
Q

I don’t know, either.

Q

There is nothing in the record on it.

MR. KORMAN:

I am not familiar enough, quite

frankly, with whether under the bankruptcy law such a
contingency vfould be considered an asset for the purposes —
Q

There is nothing in the record on it, I take

it?
MR. KORMAN:
Q

No, there is not.

But he probably couldn’t pay the filing fees

23
to bring such a law-suit, anyway.
MR. KORMAN:

Well, as I recall, there is a general

/

and former corporate statute.

We are dealing here with an

exception to that statute which is based on a Congressional
finding that there is simply another and a better way to
deal with the problem of In Forma Pauperis applicants in
bankruptcy proceedings and that better way is simply to

have

the assetless debtor file his petition and pay it out in
installments, that the filing of the petition Is based on
the need for the discharge, it Is

based on the assumed

expectation of earnings.
For these reasons, we would ask that the judgment
of the District Court be reversed.
Q

Was the issue here whether the District Court

could require repayment or prepayment?
MR.’KORMAN:

The District Court said that the

general and formal —„
Q

Well, what precipitated the argument, the case?

Was there a demand that he prepay the fees?
MR. KORMAN:

Yes.

You can’t get the discharge in

bankruptcy until you pay the fee.
Q

I know, but I thought the question was the

problem was precipitated when

he wanted to file his

petition?
MR. KORMAN:

When he filed, right and he said that —

24
Q

Well, do they have — is it the practice in

the District to require prepayment —
MR. KORMAN:
Q

Either prepayment or --

— to take the petition?

MR. KORMAN:

That is correct, either prepayment or

a statement of indigency with a plan to prepay the —
Q

Well, he filed the petition saying he was an

indigent.
MR. KORMAN:
Q

That is correct.

And the District Court would have demanded

that, except for its holding of unconstitutionality, would
have demanded prepayment — wouldn’t have taken the petition
at all, is that it?
MR. KORMAN:

.

•

Mo,, it would have demanded prepayment

or a statement of how he proposed to pay in installments.

He

said that he could make no promise to pay in installments.
Q

So the actual rule is, you may file and if

you propose installments, you may file and have the process
go forward, but before you get your discharge, you have to
pay.
MR. KORMAN:

That’s right, and you get all of the

advantages,
Q

You have the injunction in it.

Q

Mr. Korman, you have not, unless I missed it,

dealt with the argument under the Statute 28, United States

25
Codes Section 1915(a).
MR. KORMAN:

The reason that I had not,

Mr. Justice Stewart, is because I don't believe that it is
that the holding of the District Court is contested.
legislative history is rather clear on the issue.

The

It clearly

Indicates the intent of Congress to abolish In Forma Pauperis
proceedings for bankruptcy.
Q

And that law was enacted when?

MR. KORMAN:
Q

Every court —

19*16, I believe.

And when was 1915(a) last addressed by

Congress, do you know?
MR. KORMAN:

I don’t know.

I know that there was

a general In Forma Pauperis statute in effect in 1898, when
Congress initially provided for In Forma Pauperis treatment
in bankruptcy and I think probably the fact that Congress
felt it needed a special statute for the Bankruptcy Act
initially would indicate that congress was not of the view
that the In Forma Pauperis statute applied to bankruptcy
proceedings.

But as a general matter, It is quite clear

from the legislative history and every court, Mr, Justice
Stewart, even the courts that have struck the statute down,
ha\?e held that the general In Forma Pauperis statute —
Q

I know, that has been the holding, but wouldn’t

you agree that the plain language of 1915(a) covers this?
MR. KORMAN:

Yes, I would have to agree that the

26
plain language does seem to cover it if you don’t consider
the particular legislative history involved here.
Q

Well, the general or at least the old-

fashioned way of statutory construction was that if the
plain language was clear, that was the end of it, you didn’t
look at the legislative history.
MR. KORMAN:
Q

Well, there was the —

I grant you, that is a little bit out of style.

MR. KORMAN:

Well, but the language of the statute

clearly indicates that Congress did not want the discharge
to be granted until the filing fees were paid.

That is the

legislative history and the rules of this Court, I would
add, the Orders in Bankruptcy, which were based on the
statute, so read.

It said, ”No discharge

until the filing

fees are paid,” and the legislative history clearly —
Q

But that assumes the ability to pay.

MR. KORMAN:
Q

Well, it assumes —

And the 1915(a) assumes the existence of a

pauper who is not able to pay.
MR. KORMAN:

The rules assume — do not assume an

ability to pay initially, that is —
Q

No. but — an ultimate ability to pay.

MR. KORMAN:

— in fact, you have to show you are a

pauper in order to get this benefit of installment payments
and I think Congress clearly would be somewhat— it would be

27

somewhat silly for Congress to say, you have to show you are
a pauper.
Q

Well, it would not be the first time that

Congress had done a silly thing, would it?
MR. KORMAN:

Well — ah — no, it wouldn't.

I'll —

but it would, in any event, be somewhat silly for Congress to
say that you have to file a — you have to make a statement of
indigency before you can get the benefit of

an installment

payment and then, on the other hand, contemplate that a
general In Forma Pauperis statute would apply and you wouldn’t
have to do anything except file the petition and the affadavit
of indigency.
Q

How broadly has 1915(a) been applied in the

District Courts, do you know?
criminal cases.

I don't, really’. ' We .see it in

I wondered if in bringing or defending

civil cases —
MR. KORMAN:

I think it has been applied broadly

except in this area where all of the lower courts almost
unan — I don't know if the decision is the other way — have
held that the general In Forma Pauperis statute is
inapplicable here.
Q

Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OP KALMAN FINKEL, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OP THE RESPONDENT
MR. PINKEL:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
It is ironic, considering the broad purposes of
the Bankruptcy Act, that Appellant would argue that Mr. Kras
was just a little too poor to be entitled to a bankruptcy
discharge,
I would like to briefly focus on Mr. Kras' financial
plight and its relationship to the Bankruptcy Act.

Mr. Kras

can be characterized as a man who is down on his luck.

He

was last steadily employed in 1969 for an Insurance company.
Premiums that he had collected were stolen from his home.
Basically, he was discharged from his job and he was
basically accused of stealing the premiums.
Each time he went to apply for employment, bad
references of the insurance company followed him.
his debts began to accumulate.
creditors.

Meanwhile,

He was harassed by

He found himself of public

assistance and

his v/ife was home taking care of a handicapped child.
This is a man who could be characterised as
completely frustrated and a failure.

He sees no way, other

than a discharged in bankruptcy, to extricate himself from
his present plight.
bankruptcy discharge.

This man is a natural candidate for
Congress, in enacting the Bankruptcy

29
Act, understood that one of the most fundamental liberties
an Individual has Is his right to earn a livelihood and they
recognised that on some occasions a man becomes so overwhelmed
by debts, so harassed by creditors, that he becomes
immobilized, that he has nowhere to turn.
Congress enacted the Bankruptcy Act, not in the
narrow reading of what Appellate says, not merely as economic
relief.

The interest of society at large i3 at stake.

They

wanted not only to relieve the man of his debts, freedom
from creditor harassment; they were interested in emancipating
him from his debts and giving him an opportunity to start
afresh.
:<£
Well, isn't he emancipated when the Injunction

For all the

that you are now presenting to us?

MR. F1NKEL:

been no stay.

That petition

There would have

The only reason there is a stay in this case

30
is that the United States District Court declared the fee
unconstitutional.
Q

would you assume or do you know whether some

bankruptcy petitioners file there petition, file a statement
that they will pay $1 a week or some such thing arid then, in
.fact, not be able to live up to that?
MR. FINKEL:

Yes, there are situations where,

perhaps, that has happened, but in this particular case and
in many other cases where we represent clients, they cannot
make that promise and there is an initial fee of $10 that
they also

do not have, that has to be paid Immediately.
Q

Well, more accurately, I suppose what you

mean is, they eanrt make the promise with any reasonable
expectation of performing it?
MR. FINKEL:

Well, they don't know.

These are

people who are, you know, with debts and creditor harassment
and they need something dramatic to give them a chance and
that dramatic gesture is what the purposes of the Bankruptcy
Act is, to tell them that he is discharged.
personally has another chance.

The man is —

The United States Government

makes a laughing matter of it, but he has a chance to somehow
be personally vindicated.
He has been accused of being a thiof.

If — and as

happened, the insurance company does not come into the
bankruptcy court, that debt will be discharged.

Personally,

31
he will feel vindicated.

Now, in fact, he may still receive

bad references from Metropolitan but that personal vindication
will have huge psychological Implications for that individual,
his ability to earn a living, to become rehabilitated and
perhaps a productive member of society and the mere stay
just does not accomplish that result.
Q

And the discharge v:on’t decide whether or not

he was a thief, will it?
MR. FINKEL:

Or have any bearing on it?

Well, it will in one sense because if

the insurance company had any evidence whatsoever* that he
committed a fraud, that debt would survive the discharge in
bankruptcy and, therefore, had they come into the bankruptcy
court and proved their claim, that would survive.

The fact

that it does not survive now gives him a sort of personal
■

vindication.
Q

How much was involved in the loss of premiums?

.... •:

Q

.

The generality of creditors don’t waste their

time on such claims with people of that kind.

Isn’t that true?

32

MR. FINKEL:

\

I don’t knew.

I would say no, your

Honor, It is not because the majority of bankruptcies that
we have today are individuals and that is the reason there
is a huge financial deficit in the system — are individuals
with incomes of less than $4,000 who are subjected to
creditor harassment and creditors do go after them and after
judgments.

Some of them, by the way, are the full judgments.

That, today,the reason that the system is not any longer selfsufficient — self-sufficient since 1969 is that, if not a
majority, many petitioners are people with gross income of
less than $*1,000.

Consumers.

The bankruptcy court has now

become what it was hopefully designed to be, a court for
consumers also, not only for business people and these
consumers have less than $4,000 in gross assets and they are
harassed, there are judgments against them, even though the
creditor should know that these people do not. have huge sums
of money.
In fact, I should also point out that 'Congress
never intended — there i3 no evidence at all .--- that Congress
intended that an individual such as Mr. Kras should be denied
a

bankruptcy dischax^ge or that he was too poor.
What happened, under the In Forma Pauperis provision

basically, the "referees were- extorting money from the
because •..
In'digents. They were making these people pay / that went into
their fees.

Where they got them, some couldn’t pay and they

33
didn't get the discharge.

Others paid and Congress, in order

to eliminate this inconsistent and unjust result, set up a
system of installment payments.

But there is no legislative

finding or Congressional finding that an individual who is
too poor for discharge is now entitlted to a statutory right
to a discharge*.

There is no such finding in Congress.

In fact, today there are many people that we have
to turn away because they do not have the filing fee and
Legal Aid does not have any funds for it and they cannot
promise.

Prior to this case, we turned away many people in

our trial office before this suit was brought because there
was just no funds available and there was no way that they
could promise to pay within six months and then you have to
get another extension for three months, so it is not quite
nine months.
But this Individual is caught in a vicious cycle
and because he is so overwhelmed, so harassed, ha has nowhere
to turn, it is difficult for him to 3eek employment.

He is

defeated and that is exactly what the bankruptcy law was
designed to do, was to say, forget the debts, forget the
creditor harassment.

Now vie are giving you an opportunity to

start all over, to rehabilitate yourself, feel free.

And

maybe then not only will his debts be forgiven, but they will
be forgotten.

He will forget all of the — you know, the

hardships that he had and he will be able to uplift himself

3

b<

and try for a job.
Q

What was the nature of his employment?

MR, FINKEL:

He was a salesman for the insurance

company and after that he was only able to find —
Q

Odd jobs?

MR. FINKEL:
Q

Odd jobs equalling about $600,

Except for this psychiatric overlay, or

psychological overlay, is he ablebodied?
MR. FINKEL:
Q

Yes.

Does the record show whether he has tried to

get employment?
MR. FINKEL:

Yea, the record indicates1 the Petitioner

has, that he has applied not only within New York City, but he
has

gone outside the city to seek employment and the bad

reference of Metropolitan, he claims, have followed him
outside New York City.
Q

Of course, that is going to follow him after

bankruptcy, isn’t it?
MR. FINKEL:

Yes, it

probably will follow him but
. - >V

once it is dlschargedj, there is — I think he has a better
chance of bringing a civil action against them and he has a
better chance of explaining it to an employer that Metropolitan
didn’t see fit to come into court and protect that interest
and really prove their case and that maybe It is a false
accusation

35
Q

You feel that an employer will be impressed

with that approach?
MR. FINKEL:

I think it may.

I just don't know.

But I think it has — I think personally his personal sense
of vindication — that is very important — will have an
impact on his ability to perceive and obtain employment.
Q

Of course, what you are arguing is psychology,

here.
MR. FINKEL:

That is what happened in

It was not the amount in controversy.
The fee here is much larger than the former

Pauperis application of the trial or the appellate court,
under 1915.

Their fees are only $15 and $25 for a poor person

and here we have a much greater check on the man’s actual
poverty in the form of Pauperis 1915

there is hardly a check

to determine whether the mail is truly an indigent.
Q

Have you given any thought to whether or not

f

"v . - -

this Court, in .a general order, solved this situation, as
authorised by Congress?
MR. FINKEL:

I gave it a thought about ?0 minutes

ago when your Honor asked that question.

I would.say that

regardless of how small the fee is, which is the only power
this Court would really have, because I think the statute
.

'

-

-

mandates a certain fee prior to discharge and. regardless of
how long the period will be, it will still be insufficient and
*

. .._t*

contrary to the real purposes of theBankrupfccy Act.

The man

should have his discharge if he cannot pay it without any
f

if

payment because he is being denied his opportunity to be

37
heard.
Now, in Boddle,
Q

-

While I have interrupted you, I am curious,

are you In Forma

Pauperis in this Court?

MR. FINKEL:
Q

if I could just address myself

Yes, sir.

I was just curious.

You have a very nicely

printed brief here and I wondered where the monejr came from
to print that?
MR. FINKEL:

Yes.

It comes from the United States

Supreme Court.
Q

Very good.

MR. FINKEL:

We are In Forma Pauperis in the

United States Supreme Court.
Q

Do you attack the District judge’s Indication

that the fee may be collected later?
MR. FINKEL:

No, your Honor, we don’t know where

this authority is, but we have no trouble with it because
as long as —
Q

So he comes out of the bankruptcy with this

debt?
MR. FINKEL:
comes out with some

He comes out with this debt and he
debt to the Federal Government of

$150 in taxes and a few other debts, but he comes out with
complete discharge.
Q

All right.

Okay.

Whatever his discharge

38
covers, he has got it?
MR. FINKEL:
Q

But it doesn't cover this debt?

MR. PINKEL:
of the order.

Right.

Well, we did not object to that part

It was inserted and we didn’t object to it.

I don’t know, upon consideration, vre might in the future, but
as of now we hay© accepted that it would survive as long a3
he has the discharge papers.
Q

Mr. Finkel, one other question, does your

argument carry us logically to the conclusion that there should
be no fees — maybe no fees constitutionally imposed in every
or any assetless estate?
MR. FINKEL:

•

■

Your-Honor, I would-say that, taking

Boddie, this case can be distinguished from all filing fee
cases that come within Boddie because this individual, although
it Is not an absolute monopoly, the state has interposed a
statutory fee and there are no realistic alternatives for
Mr. Kras.

He cannot offer anything except for his claim.
With respect to the broader question, your Honor,

I would answer you, yes, unequivocally, that I feel that all
filing fees that bar Indigenfcs access to court in the first
Instance, should be struck down as relatively depressive.
is
I don’t say that/to be found in the narrow reading
of Boddie but I do say it is to be found in the substance of
t^

due process on the right to be heard and that that Individual

39
right

goes back thousands of years.

On the Roman

was a

waiver of filing fees. Almost 500 years ago

law there
in the

statute of Henry the Vllth there were provisions for waiver
of filing fees for indigent plaintiffs in civil cases.
There were also provisions for counsel.

On the

criminal side we feel there is much more that will bear
access.

We have allowed them — we have given them all of

the intrumentalities necessary to vindicate their legal rights,
from counsel through transcript of the minutes.
On the civil side* what we are basically
about

is get access to court- which I feel — and .1

talking
think the

Constitution mandates — Is part of the substance; of dep­
ressive and even though the common world* they never moved up,
there was disparity between the ideals and realities of
the system of justice, as Professor McGuire pointed out in
his classic article almost 50 years ago, most of the problems
were administrative.

The courts had no way to ferret out the

meritorious from the frivolous claims, no way to determine
who was really an indigent, who was

more affluent.

Today, we don*t have that problem administratively.
Many courts already have waiver of filing fees.
i

f

Administratively, tjhere can be a provision, perhaps,
an affadavit of merit.

If the indigent is represented by
y

counsel, that affadavit can be more thorough and.more
f

extensive.

There are provisions for recoupment in case of

40
recovery.

There are provisions that the debt can survive.

There are penalties for perjury that the cost will not be
that high.
Buts your Honors, regardless of what the cost is, I
ask your Honors to consider the other side of the coin5 the
cost in loss of personal freedom for an individual that does
not have his day in court is immeasurable.

The social coats

to a society where there is no lack of respect for the
'Judicial system is staggering.

It is the civil courts of

the United States that an individual has the right to defend
his
all things that are dear to him,/life, liberty and property
and part of our Anglo-American heritage of fairness and
equal justice under the law is that it should be a meaningful
concept and not a mockery.
I think the time is ripe for this Court to declare
that a man’s right to be heard should not be dependent upon
the sise of hl3 pocketbook.

And I would ask that the Court

consider going beyond a narrow reading of Boddie and a
broader reading of the due process clause for initial access
to the Court, to strike down all filing fees that stand in
the way of the indigentfs right at least to get into court
as a first solution.

Q

Mr. Pinkel, you have emphasised now in this

last — these recent observations at least three or four
times the initial access — barrier to initial access.

There

is no barrier to initial access in bankruptcy, is there?
MR. FINKEL:

Yes, there is.

There is the barrier

that a man will have to sign an affidavit that he will promise
to

pay $50 in six months that he may not be able to pay.
Q

If he Is in court — he is in court and has

access when he signs that affidavit, isn't he?
MR. FINKEL:

He is in court when he signs that

affidavit but it would be totally meaningless.

It will be

an empty promise.
Q

It

may be meaningless, but you really

haven't denied him access.

You have furnished him a way,

just as in Boddle the access was conditioned on an affidavit.
And in all the courts an affidavit of the proper posture,
MR. FINKEL:

Well, your Honor, I define access to

mean that the individual is in court and the reftfpf He seeks
he. can obtain without any financial barriers.

That is the
• !

way I would define initial access to court.

i"'.

The fact that

he is in and he cannot receive any relief is to me, meaning­
less .

First, he is not really in.

The petition; will not be

considered at all unless he makes that promise and I am not
sure that there are very few debtors that will be willing
to sign a sworn affidavit that ir. six months they know they
* ***•••*. *

.

are going to have $50 to pay..
Q

Well, isn’t the history of it in fact, though,

that most indigent applications — petitioner in bankruptcy

do sign the affidavit now, the overwhelming majority of them?
MR. FIHKEL:

No, your Honor, we don't know — and I

checked with our offices, the thousands and thousands of
people that are turned away.

You can only see the petitions

before the court, the ones that the people promise, but the
thousands of poor people who are turned away by legal services
offices because they don't knot* that they will have a Job and
refuse to sign that and there is no other way it could be
paid and they just don't receive their discharge.
Once you are in court that is only a minor amount
that the people who need a bankruptcy discharge — there are
.

; • *

'-siiff

thousands of other people who need the discharge but do not
receive it.
Q

Well, isn’t the very fact of the deficit that

is being incurred a result of the nonpayment by people who
•V

promised to pay.
MR. FINKEL:

I would say no, your Honor, .1 think it

is JuBt the added expenses.

It is$4.5 million ih 1971»

$2.5 million a few years ago.

I don't think it has anything

.to do with it or not that much.
Q

You don’t think that posture contributes to

that?
MR. FINKEL:

Contributes, but negligible, and not

to override the individual’a,you know, right to be there.
There are no statistics at all from the government

showing in any way what the loss would be.
whatsoever.

There are none

We have waited for those statistics and every

one of the briefs to show us in documentation.

What they

have argued is that everybody who pays an installment will
now come under In Forma Pauperis.

That may not be so.

In fact , in the companion case in the Southern
District that we broughtP after we lost* the referee
decided against us, the individual obtained employment and
now he has promised to pay the fee.
Thank you.
Q

Mr. Finkel, would you agree that your client

probably cannot force Metropolitan to come in and defend
the merits of its accusations against him in.the bankruptcy
court if Metropolitan does not present evidence o? fraud,
that debt would be discharged along with all the others,
but Metropolitan’s failure-to appear at all wouldn’t, for
example, be res

.Judicata against it in an action by your

client, say, for slander or some action of that sbrt.
MR. FINKEL:

Absolutely not,

the fact that —

that is one of the factors that will bd looking'forward.

If

Metropolitan has' not come in — we did have our meeting of
creditors and the creditors, and the creditors did not show
up.

The only thing that now stands in the way of the

discharge is the fee.

We’ve gone through the entire period

and the individual is unable to pay the fee.

Either he gets

discharged or his petition gets dismissed.

That is the state

we are In right now in this law suit and therefore, when he —
the fact that Metropolitan did not come in and this debt
is discharged will give Mr. Kras an opportunity to possibly
turn around and positively sue them and

use this as part

of his proof.
Q

But it is not an adjudication on the merits?

MR. FINKEL:

No, that is not adjudication on the

merits except that it has been discharged and they did not
come in to prove fraud.

That is the most, I think, we can

say about it.
Q

I think you haven*t, at least in your brief,,

didn't place any reliance at all on this statute.
MR. FINKEL:
Honor.

Well, in the lower court we did, your

It was rejected.
Q

And the lower court turned you down?
v ;r,\

MR. FINKEL:

We feel that although 1915 is very

broadly construed, there is —

where

there Is a specific

government statute versus the general statute — the specific
one covers it and ws do acknowledge that they did specifically
overrule, abolish In Forma Pauperis statute.
Q
Forma

Which statute came earlier?

I know the In

Pauperis statute goes v/ay, way back but

MR. FINKEL:

Well, in 19 —

■ i •? ’
Q

— in fact, there was a bankruptcy law back in

45
the early 18th or 19th century.
MR. FINKEL:

Yes, but at the time they abolished

In Forma Pauperis, for bankruptcy In 1946 and 1948, there
already was 1915 on the books end they passed what would be
installment fees which the lower courts have considered it
and I thought they were right, held that that covered the
point and therefore, bankruptcy is not within 1915.
Q

You are in a better position than I am to

know this, has 1915(a) been given very generous application
in the courts generally?
MR. FINKEL:

Yes, 1915 — other than the bank­

ruptcy discharge, I know of no other federal filing fee that
doesn’t corns within 1915.
Q

You mean, both as a plaintiff and as defendant?

MR. FINKEL:

Both as plaintiff and defendant, on

appeal, both civilly and criminally.
Q

In any kind of a proceeding —

MR. FINKEL:
q

In any kind of —

— obtainable in a federal court!?

MR* FINKEL:

Yes, we’ve received It ftiahy times

remained static in a period of rising costs?

Q

/

I supposes it is a--matter of common knowledge

that a $50 'filing fee might have supported a particular
clerk's office 50 or 100 years ago and wouldn’t pay for the
lights under present conditions.
MR. FINKEL:

Today the bankruptcy deficit is so

47
enormous — I was about to say that it is negligible to the
relationship to the $50 fee.

It is $4.5 million and in 1969

it was self-sufficient, so it :Ls over the last four years that
there has been this increased deficit and the filing fee I
don’t think is the responsibility because people have been
paying the $50 or else they haven’t been getting in, so they
have collected their fee and those who haven’t paid just
didn’t get into court until, you know, a few district courts
declared the statute unconstitutional.
ME. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Finkel.

Thank you, Mr. Korman.
The case is submitted,
(Whereupon, at 11:39 o’clock a.in., the case
was submitted.)
