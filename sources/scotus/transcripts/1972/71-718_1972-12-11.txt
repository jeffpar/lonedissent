P ROCEEDIN G S
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in Ho. 71-718, McGinnis against Royster.
Mr. CoXodner.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL COLODNER, ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. COLODNER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The issue in this case is, What is the role of
federal courts in examining state statutes which relate to
the internal in-prison

administration and what is the

scope of this role within the Equal Protection Clause.
The appellees in this case are inmates of state
prisons.

Each of them was arrested and spent time in the

county jail prior to trial because they could not post bail.
The appellee Mr. Royster had been indicted for burglary and
had spent 11 months in jail in 1S65 and 1966.

Mr. Rutherford

had been indicted and convicted of robbery in the first degree.
He had spent eight months in jail in 1966.
Under provision Section 230, subdivision (3) of
the Correction Law, he received no credit for good behavior
for this period of pre-trial incarceration.

He did receive

credit for the amount of time on his full sentence that he
spent there, but he was not allowed to earn good behavior
time.

Q

How does a state institution go about

evaluating the good behavior of a man who is not in their
custody?
MR. COLODNER%

There is no way for the state to

evaluate the good behavior of a man who is not in their
custody.
Q

But you want credit for it even though they

have no way of evaluating it? is that not the essence of
this case?
MR. COLODNER;

The essence of this case is that

plaintiffs say that they wish to be credited for this time,
and the state contends—
Q

Would this be an irrebuttable presumption

that during the 11-month period his behavior was good as
defined by the state institution?
MR. COLODNER;

If we were to accept the reasoning

of the district court judge, we would have to have an
irrebuttable presumption to that fact.
0

There is no way—

Even though his behavior might have been

such as in the state institution, it would be rated as verybad.

You concede that, I take it, that might be the

consequence.
MR. COLODNER;

That is true.

But the real problem

that this case presents is that the concept of good behavior
in a county jail over and apart from the supervisory problem

5
and the evaulthion problem, is totally different from the
concept of good behavior in a state prison after someone
has already been convicted and is now part of a
rehabilitation program as in fact amenable to rehabilitation.
If someone in roe county jail when he is arrested is presumed
innocent, there seems to be no need—certainly there is no
need for the state or the county or any political entity to
institute a rehabilitation program for someone who is
presumed innocent and is presumed to have no need for
rehabilitation at all.

It is only after he has been

convicted that not only does the state presume the need but
the individual inmate now is in the proper .ttitude to
presume that he can be reformed and rehabilitated.
Q

la there any classification process at the

detention level as at the state level when they get into the
penitentiary?

Do they undertake to classify people within

categories of either skills or psychological—
MR. COLODKERs

Your Honor, there is aa orientation

to a receiving center-q

No, in the jail I am speaking of.

Q

Hr

Colodner, going through, the mathematics

of this argument, I take it that what it comes down to, the
difference between you and your opposition, is one-third of
the jail time.

I think mathematically this is where the

algebra comes out.

That's all you are arguing: about.

ME. COLODNER5

Welle we are arguing about at most

two or three months.
0

Well, it is one-third of the jail time.

I am

sure algebraically this is what it comes out.
MR. COLODNER:
Q

About one-third of the jail time.

Let me ask you—not only about, 1 think it is

one-third of the jail time.
MR. COLODNER;

Is there a possibility of mootness here?

MR. COLODNER;

Okay.

There is no possibility of mootness

Q

Rutherford has already had his date come and

q

Well, is this true as to all named members

of the class?
MR, COLODNERs

Yes.

Well, the two named members

of the class are also pre-1967 prisoners.
Q

But do they not have their date? one of them

already has passed and the other one is coming up in a
month?
MR. COLODNER:
Q

That is true.

Certainly probably before this Court can

decide the case.
MR. COLQDNER%

That is true, but we have the

situation, as this Court faced in Dunn v„ Blumstein, we
have a statute, the enforcement of which is capable of
repetition yet escaping review.

Of this group, 1 world say at least

two to three hundred are affected by this very provision,
because anyone who is arrested or has committed a crime, say,
subsequent between 1963 and 1968, say, and it was a serious
crime, it was a murder or a robbery in the first degree, or
they were a multiple offender, every single one of these
people would be affected by this law and would not have
reached their minimum date at all.

are not raising the question of mootness.

We cannot raise the question of

declared unconstitutional.
Q

Yes, but is that the answer to it if all

MR. COLODNER;

Then our basic problem would be as

court awaiting the disposition of this case, involving someone
who comes right under this statute.

MR. COLODNEE:

The basic problem that really happened with this

MR. COLODNER:

He would have to wait until the

maximom of his sentence or depending on how much good fciraa
he would earn on. that sentence,
Q

Is that the only consequence of good time

under the New York Penal Cede, Mr. Colodner, is it determines
the initial date on which you first go before the parole
board?
MR. COLODNER:

That is the only consequence of

good time on the minimum sentence, which is the only thing
at issue in this case.

There is good time on the maximum

and this is where the district court really missed the
conception.

perform well.

It is saying, "You

You show a. positive attitude, and we will give

you a chance to be released very, very early.”

And it is

the balance of these two concepts which is ..really at issue
here, and we are dealing with the minimum sentence, and this

II
is the rehabilitative concept.
Now, as I pointed out in my brief, historically
there has always been a distinction between what was called
commutation for good conduct and compensation which was for
positive performance,

And the whole history of the New York

correctional scheme tries to strike a balance between the two
until finally in 1931 the two are consolidated.

In fact, at

one point they used to actually pay people for compensation,
and then they finally reduced sentence for compensation.
Now specifically in the statute there is a reduc­
tion in sentence for both good conduct and for the efficient
and willing performance of duties assigned.

So* good time

is certainly more than a question of whether you are bad or
good as the district has stated.

It is not a question really

of saying whether being bad or good is a primary function
end rehabilitation is a secondary function.

They are equal

functions under the statutory scheme.
Q

To what extent is rehabilitation actually in

existence in New York?
MR. COLODNBRj

Well, rehabilitation is in existence

to this extent—
Q

It is something we are working toward, is if

not?
MR. COLODNERs
Q

Definitely, Your Honor.

Why should a man’s release be dependent on

12
something that is just ephemeral?
MR. QOLODKERs

Your Honor, we.do not know to what

extent rehabilitation is really the full role of the prison
or the role of society.

We have set up a system to enable

the state correctional authorities to evaluate an individual’s
particular performance in a particular program.
Q

Who evaluates it?

MR. COLODHBRs
First

f

There are two mean:-: of evaluation.

,

there is the Department of Correction which evaluates

him under very, very strict standards.
Q

And how many people does he acme in contact

with who evaluate him?
MR. COLODNSR?

Well, first of all there is a time

Q

How much do you have in Attica'?

MR. COLODWSRs

1 am not familiar with the situation

in Attica, Your Honor.
Q

Well, you are talking about the whole state.

ME. COLODMERg

That i.s true.

But the fact—Your

Honor, the fact that rehabilitation may not be successful
and the New York State Department of Correction is not going
to stand before this Court and say that we are successfully
rehabilitating every prisoner who comes there does not. mean
that the state cannot try to set forth a statutory scheme
o,nd attempt to rehabilitate, and if the scheme is not
successful, to try a new scheme.
Q

If I understand this man's -complaint, it is

.not about rehabilitation or what have you?

t is about using

a standard by which he loses a third of his time.
all he is complaining about.

That is

14

MR, COLODNER°
Q

That is correct

„

Your Honor,

Audi your answer is that he is los ing because

you have this very «elaborate rehabilitation program? am I
right or wrong?

MR. CGLODHEr,;

He is losing this because we have

a very—not an elaborate—but we have a system of evaluation
of a. -prisoner's performance in a state correctional program*,
and this is very important-Q

Did I hear you say that there were no

rahabilitation programs?
MR, COLODNERs
program

If there were no rehabilitation

at all, I think it would still be the same; it’

would be the same for. other reasons.

Because you have a man—

you are releasing him not only at the minimum date but some­
times they

set a date all the way at the lowest possible

date this man can get out.

And the correctional scheme set

up under this law is that they are going to let him out twothirds of that date* which means even lower than the lowest.
They have to evaluate the man, and it is perfectly reasonable
for the state to set up a system that says* "We are not going
to consider time spent in an institution when we have no
chance of evaluating him."

Maybe this is

not the perfect

system* but Equal Protection does not require that we have
the perfect System.

And one of the ha sic problems with the

opinion of the court below is that it said*

"Nee?* wait a

15
second state.
system.-'5

I do not think you are putting in the best

.and so the district court, the majority below said,

"Let me show you how to do it," and he showed how we can
basically have a better evaluation by the parole board in
the state prisons, how we could transfer the records from
the county jails, and we can set up the system that way.
That might be true, but the Constitution does not require
that the state do this.

There is nothing unreasonable about

the statutory scheme which is set up right now.
State prisons and county jails are completely
different.

County jails, for the first part, offer nothing.

They are purely detention centers.

There is certainly not a

fact in this record to show that they offer anything; and it
would be impossible for the state to set up a system of
evaluation or rehabilitative program in an institution where
people are presumed innocent and could not be subject to it.
in fact, if they were compelled to participate, we would have
a Thirteenth Amendment problem.

And also where the sentences,

where the amount of time spent in the county jail is so
abort comparatively that if you were going to set up any sort
of a meaningful program or even have any meaningful
evaluation, it would not be worthwhile to look upon two or
three months in an institution when nothing can really be
accomplished within that space.
Nowf it must be remembered that the evaluation by

16
the Correction Department is dual evaluation here,

First,

the Correction Department certifies to the Parole Board that
this man is now ready to be considered for release, and this
is certainly something the Legislature can do.

The opinion

of the court below argued strongly that the Parole Board
has a lot of discretion and so it does not really matter.

But

a state legislature certainly has the power and the right to
draw a line and say, "Up to a certain point, Parole Board, you
are not allowed to make this evaluation, because we have
made a legislative determination that a man has to spend a
particular amount of time in a particular program."
And this evaluation—and I left out Section 214 of
subdivision (4) of the correction law—is a very serious one
because it involves a complete redetermination of the
inmate's attitude, of his progresst and this is made by
officials, the director of prison industries, the physician,
the warden, the director of education.

This is a serious

evaluation and it cannot be done by considering time in a
county jail.
What essentially happened here was that the district
court ignored everything.

In fact, the district court

acknowledged that oh, there certainly are differences and, yes,
there are different goals and, yes, you really cannot
rehabilitate people in county jails.

But it means that the

primary basis for this statute was whether someone was good

17
or bad, and. that is it.

And this totally ignored the

differences that I have stated, that the primary basis for
the release on good time on the minimum sentence is a
rehabilitative function, not a custodial function,
And then the.district court said, "Well, assuming
that there are"—Q

As I read the opinion, the opinion was this

is not to serve a rehabilitative function at all but the
overriding consideration is the granting of good time
reductions, maintenance of prison discipline.
MR. COLODMER2

X do not know where the district

court gets that reasoning from because—
Q

Where do you get your reasoning from?

MR. COLODNER:

From the very language of Section

233 of the correction law.

Good time is awarded for good

conduct and for the willing and efficient performance of
duties assigned.
Q

It is two concepts and they balance.
But is it important for you to decide which

one is the primary as long as the district court did not
deny that the other reason was part of it?
MR. COLODNERs

Absolutely not.

In fact, the

district court fccltnolwedged it and said if it was the sole
and exclusive reason, "State, I would agree with you,”

But

the district court decided, from my reading of the opinion,
that since it was not the sole and exclusive reason, we only

18

go by what the primary reason is, and this is. totally in
conflict with the decisions on this

Court in Equal Protec­

tion o
Q

This is what the court said*

Defendants

0

contend that good time is granted as an incentive to the
inmate—the defendants being you—-to participate in these
prison rehabilitation programs.

Since county jails are not

equipped to provide such services, there is no basis for
granting good time severing»

If it were clear that the

awarding of good time was based solely and exclusively on
an evaluation of an inmate’s performance in such programs,
so endemic to the state prison system, the denial of good
time for jail time might be understandable»
does not appear to be the case»

However, this

Rather, it seems that the

overriding consideration—now, the three-judge court said
the overriding consideration in the granting of good time
reductions is the maintenance of prison discipline»

And you

quarrel with that?
MR. COLODNER:

I certainly do quarrel with it»

First, of all—
Q

And your answer to it is the statute cannot

be re d that way?
MR» ROhODNER:
Me pc

The statute cannot be read that way»

in affidavits to the effect that this was not the

vvv.'pc 3 at all, that there was much more purpose than the

19
award for custodial behavior.
Q

You also say that the statute should be

Upheld as an effort to serve the non-overriding purpose of
the statute?
MR. COLODNER:

A statute should be upheld to serve

whatever purposes it is passed for.

We cannot make

considerations as to whether something is primary or
secondary.

If that were the case, any judge ' can

look and

decide to see what—or any court can look and decide to see
which one he would like best and then pick it out and then
try to gear and restructure the state system according to
whether he thought it was the primary basis or the secondary
basis.

And in fact—
Q

You say that is what the rule should be under

the Equal Protection Clause?
MR. COLODNERj
Q.

Definitely.

Maybe some other clauses, primary and

secondary, have some relevance?
MR. COLODNER %

Whatever other clauses there are, I

do not know, but certainly not the Equal Protection Clause.
For instance, let us assume that good behavior is the
primary basis here and that evaluation is a secondary basis.
Why could not the legislature then repass' the same-statute and
pm: - little addendum at the bottom and say, "We think that
relabilitatior is the primary basis"?

This is exactly what

20

the Court dealt with in Palmer v. Thompson.
look to the motive of the legislature.

And so we do not

We look to see

whether there is any state of facts that can conceivably
justify the classification.

If we find a state of facts,

that is the end of the judicial role.
0

How long have you had time off for good

behavior in New York?
MR. COLODHER:
Q

Pardon?

Excuse ma?

How long has New York given time off for

good behavior?
MR., COLQDNERs
Q

Under this particular scheme—-

How long has New York-—

MR. CQLODNER;

Since the turn of the century,

Your Honor.
Q

And how long have you had a rehabilitation

program in New York?
MR. CQLODNER; We have had a developing program
since the turn of the century.
Q

You really say that?

MR. CQLODNERs

Yes.

In this particular field of

prison administration, the standard which has to be used is
the rational basis standard, because we are dealing with what
is a vary sensitive area.

We have to balance both the needs

of the prison insofar as the needs of the inmates are
concerned and the needs of the prison structure are concerned

21
versus the needs of society, which is paramount to whether
someone is going to be released prior to the lowest part of
his sentence.
There are no known solutions to this problem.

And,

as Mr. Justice Marshall points out, there may bs problems as
to whether rehabilitation succeeds or not.
a very open science.

And penology is

For this is the very area, because of

the openness of this field, where the state has to have
broad discretion, just like this Court stated in Jefferson
against Hackney in the welfare area, which is also a very
open question in terms of what is the proper solution.

The

state cannot be put in a constitutional straitjacket in
dealing with how we are going to set up a very complex
system of awarding good time.
As is illustrated by the history of this statute,
sines the turn of the century we have been constantly
changing our statute, sometimes putting good time on the
minimum, sometimes on
•stf

he maximum, sometimes on indeterminate

term, sometimes on definite terms, trying to strike a balance
And..the state should be allowed to do this.
G

Do all the people involved in this case get

jail time for their-MR. CGLODNSR;
Q

Everyone gets jail time.

They get credit for the time—

MR. CCLODNERs

That is right.

22
Q

—they sit in jail»

MR. COLODNER:
Q

They do not just get good time for that jail

MR. GOLOOKERs
Q

That is right»

Mr. Colodner.

MR. COLODNER:
Q

That is right.

Yes»

The opinion of the three-judge court, it is

at 61A of the Appendix? states that under certain
circumstances the state does grant good time credit for
pre-sentence detention»
MS. COLODNER:
Q

That is right, Your Honor.

Would you explain the circumstances under

which that occurs?
MR. COLODNER:

Good time is granted on the maximum

sentence»
Q

Just on the maximum?

MR. COLODNER:

No, there are the—on the maximum

sentence because, as I pointed out, the difference between
a. custodial component on the maximum and the rehabilitative
component on the minimum makes it a more effective
disciplinary device on the maximum.

Good time is also

awarded for jail time on penitentiary sentences? these are
sentences for misdemeanors of less than one year.
the evaluation' is not that sensitive.

Here again

We are dealing with

23
short sentences, with much less serious crimes, and with the
very practical problem that the county jails are overcrowded
and they want a faster turnover.
Q

So the good time for pre-sentence detention

is allowed only with respect to the maximum and only where
this ultimate sentence is less than a year?
ME. CQLODNER;

That is right.

It is under the

old law.
Q

Even though the one person who gets the time

would be in the same jail .as one who does not get the good
time?
MR. COLODNERs

I do not think that there is a

comparable situation there.

yes, that is true.

I do not know whether you can—

If someone—now, if you are comparing

someone with both people who are convicted of felonies,
there is no comparable situation.

Neither of them get good

time.
R

That, is right.

MR. COLOBNERs

Neither of them.

Neither of them.

But if you are

someone who is convicted of a misdemeanor as opposed to
someone v?ho is, let us say, indicted for both—
Q

Yes.

MR.

COLODNERs —the misdemeanor would get credit

for good time.

Q

And they both might be in exactly the same

24
jail.
MR. COLOBNERs

Exactly the same jail.

But it makes

no difference in those terms, because when you are dealing
with a misdemeanor, the state legislature has set up a
system which is purely custodial; it is a very short sentence.
And 'they are willing to give him as much time as they wish
to give him without trying to set up a program for
rehabilitation.
Q

There is no

question to you, and you may develop the point as you. wish»
Suppose that there was a pre-trial detention of a man in a
jail in Prance subject to extradition to this country and
it took six months to get him extradited out of France back
to Mew York for trial under the extradition treaty; would you
make the .same arguments there that you are making here?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF G. JEFFERY SORGEf ESQ,,

.

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. SORGE;

Your Honor, I believe it would be very

difficult to really answer that question if it refers to a
penal institution in France.

I doubt very much that the

state penal institutions in New York . State would be in a
position to judge whether a person has behaved properly in a
penal institution in France, whether there are any programs.
They would really not be able to evaluate any type of program
in France.

I believe that a better example might be, let us

say, if a person was detained in New Jersey and he is
extradited from Hew Jersey.
Q

Let us make it Alaska.

MR. SORGE;

Okay, Alaska, another State of the

Do you think it is any easier to evaluate

what is going on in

a

local jail than it is on what is going

on in. a jail in Hawaii or in Alaska?
MRo SCRGE:

Yes, I do, Your Honor.

I believe it

is much easier, just because the location of the jail-.X
believe also it is indicated that the ultimate jurisdiction
of all jails is under the Department of Correction, so there
is obviously an intertwined aspect here where—
Q

Xf they are holding the man in Alaska,

pre-trial detention, they are acting as an agent of the
State of hew York, are they not?
MR, SORGE:
Q

Yes, they are, Your Honor,

Or Paris, Prance.

MR. SORGE;

X agree, Your Honor.

Ana I think this

would boil down to the position that really'—which is the
position we maintain and maintained throughout this entire
case—that it does not really matter where they are detained;
it just matters, you know, what good time is actually
credited for,

The Attorney General in his argument alleges

that the good time is granted as an incentive for participa­
tion in the rehabilitative program.

We believe that there

are more than sufficient examples in the district cmart'3
opinion and in our brief to show that this is not the purpose
of a good time reduction.
Q

You mean no part of the purpose at all?

28
MR. SORGE:
Q

Yes, Yotir Honor.

This is the—

I thought what I road to your brother

earlier from the majority opinion at least accepts, 1 thought i
the idea that there was something overriding about
maintenance cf prison discipline, but that did not pr e. elude
the rehabilitation objective that your brother spoke about.
MR. SORGE:

I believe that if Mr. Justice would

refer to page 59a of the . Appendix, here the court considers
the differences between the county jail and the state
prisons.

And 1 believe it is stated there that whatever the

differences are, it does not matter because these are not
reasonably related to the purposes of the statuteV

In other

words, the three-judge court is not contesting on any
differences between the two jails.

They are just stating

merely that whatever the differences are, these differences
are relevant because these differences are not equated with
giving good time.

And in that light, Your Honor, I would

submit that this Court did not concede that there were
differences and did not state that these differences
attributed to giving good time.
And X would like to just pose an example.

While

the—
Q

Then it is your position that the only

purpose at all, sir, by the statute, exclusively, the only
single purpose, is the disciplinary one?

29
MR. SORGE:

Your Honor, it is extremely difficult

to say whether the only purpose is just for the discipline.
I believe that the court has—
Q

If a purpose is the rehabilitation one, then

are you not in some trouble?
MS. SORGEs
Q

If the main purpose is?

If a purpose, not the main purpose, a purpose.

MR. SORGE:

I do not believe so, Your Honor,

because, as the district, court stated, the overriding
consideration in this case is disciplinary.
Q

1 know it did.

MR. SORGE:
Q

Now, X believe—

Suppose rehabilitation were a subordinate

purpose.
MR. SORGE:

I believe that just by the examples

cited in the district court's opinion and in the examples
cited in our brief, there are very many situations where an
inmate does not have available any rehabilitative facilities
whatsoever, yet he still gets good time credit.

And I think

in a situation there we can see clearly that the rehabilita­
tive facilities have absolutely nothing to do with granting
of good time, because there are absolutely no rehabilitative
facilities.
Q

You go further then than the district court,

I take it, because I read the district court’s opinion the

same way Mr. Justice Brennan does, as saying that rehabilita­
tion is a subordinate function and- that its opinion is based
on that.

You say that it really is no function at all?
MR. GORGEs

I believe that if you take the state

prisons themselves, Mr. Justice, there might be a subordinate
position.

However, X would repeat that the overriding

consideration is the disciplinary aspect of it.

However, in

other situations which corae under the jurisdiction of the
state Department of Correction, we can extend this argument
even further, saying that the rehabilitative facilities have
absolutely no relationship to the granting of good time.
.It would be a twofold argument.
with Your Honor.

So,

At one time X am agreeing

At the same time, I believe that the

logical extension of this is that in very many situations it
does have no relationship to the statute.
Q

X gather you agree 'that the Equal Protection

test here is the rationality test of Danclridge, not the
compelling interest test?
I®. SORGEs

Yes, 1 do realize that, Your Honor, and

I point out that the district court, in contradiction to the
Attorney General’s argument, also recognised the various
standards imposed by Dandridge.

They stated first that the

Equal Protection Clause requires only that the state’s
practice be rationally based and free from invidious
discrimination.

They also stated that while certain

individuals might be; substantially harmed by any form or
type of discrimination, that this will be okay if there is
a valid governmental objective»

However, I believe that the

important aspect of this is the court’s comment immediately
after this, and this is found on page 59a of the Appendix»
The court, after citing these two principles and after, 1
believe, showing .clearly to this Court that the lower court
was aware of their duty, the court stated that they would
not countenance any artificial distinctions rot reasonably
related to this statute, and 1 think this is the crux of the
problem here.

The court has determined that the justification

presented by the Attorney General in this case ere not
reasonably related to the statute and are purely artificial
distinctions„
The Attorney General, Your Honor, has stated that
the district court has totally misapplied the Equal Protection
standard.

And the reason they misapplied it, number one, is

that they did not challenge the Attorney General's argument
that there is a difference between the facility's purpose
and usage of the state jails versus the local penal
institufcions.
We submit that the state hats considered these
differences, as we stated before, and they found out that they
ware not reasonably related -to the statute.

The manner in

which they arrived at this conclusion is by looking at the

32
legislative intention.
was with several.

And the manner in which they did this

In the first case, the fact that good

time is a disciplinary device in the state penal institution
was readily conceded by the Attorney General.
Also we find that in New York State court-—-this
is :ui the case os Peres v. Polletts, which is cited at page
8 of our brief and on page 60a of the Appendix—this Court,
while upholding the constitutionality of the statute,
arrived at the same conclusion, that good time is in effect
a disciplinary device.,
Also we find that while this case refers solely to
the provisions of Section 230, subdivision {3}, which draws
a distinction between the county inmates who are subsequently
sent to the state and persons who are not so detained prior
to being sentenced.
The courts of New York have also considered the
following subsection.

This is 330, subdivision (4), and

this concerns the maximum release date.
There is- a very clear distinction between the two
sections as far as the language which is employed.

The Court

will notice that in subdivision (3) the legislature—
Q

Are you relying on Perez v. Pollette as a

■construction of 233 limiting its purpose to the disciplinary
objective?

MR» SORGEs

No, Your Honor.

I submit it to this

33
Court that that gives an indication of what the state5s
purpose is as far as that section is concerned.

That is

the limited purpose that X am citing that case*
Q

Except what it says is the policy underlying

attitude and conduct of prisoners should improve if they ara
offered an incentive for good and productive behavior,

Iiv.it

at the same time the fact that reductions can be withheld
will inhibit bad conduct,
MR. SORGEs
Q

That is the language, is it not?

Yes. Your Honor.

May I say again, is this an interpretation of

the statute?
MR. SORGEs

X believe that is an interpretation of

the statute, but I think at the same time we can find out—
Q

Meaning an interpretation to what effect?

MR. SORGE:

1 believe this is an interpretation

that shows the legislative intent of the statute,
Q

That this was the only intent?

MR. SORGE:

It is very difficult to say whether

this is -idle only intent, because the case does not, you know,
expound upon that factor really.

However, there are other

considerations that the Court should look at when they look
at the legislative intent, not only one case; that was
decided by the court.

As I was explaining before, the

difference between subdivision (3) and subdivision (4) of

34
the section note on 230 of the New York Correction Law,, it
draws a clear distinction between in one case the pre-trial
detention of prisoners as far as good time on their' minimum
sentence is concerned and pre-trial detention of prisoners
as far as their maximum or conditional release date
state pent! tenti ary .
The

first subdivision, subdivision (3) specifically

states that this good time should foe determined on the
amount of the minimum sentence, less jail time»

Subdivision

(4), however, does not refer to jail time whatsoever.
In People v. Deegan and the case of Paul v. The
Warden of Suffolk County Jail, which is found in the
Appendix at page 60a and also at page 8 of our brief, this
very issue of whether jail time should be included or
excluded in the computation of good time to be provided in
the determination of the maximum sentence was raised.

And

what was the argument by the state in both of those cases?
In both of those cases the state argued that there are
differences between the county jail and differences between
the state jails.

There are differences in purpose, usage,

and facility, and in both of those cases the courts rejected
the state argument.

And I believe that is very important

to show the legislative purpose there.
Another example.

penal institution after being transferred from the county

Instead, he is penalised for

Proceeding.

There are two boards.

This is what they call the Superintendent

The .Superintendent Proceeding is a proceeding

that is used whenever there is a disciplinary action taken
against a prisoner in a state prison.

This action arises

whenever there is misbehavior involving a danger to life,
health; security or property, or in a case where there is
persistent minor violations against the rules of the prison.
This is a very elaborate procedure which starts
where a report is filed by one of the sheriffs or one of the
guards on the floor.

This report is subsequently forwarded

to what they call the Adjustment Committee.
Committee reviews the report.

The Adjustment

The Adjustment Committee may

take three actions.

It may recommend reappraisal of the

prisoner's program.

It may recommend nullification of the

report.

Or it may take what they call Adjustment Committee

Action.

Adjustment Committee Action, very briefly, is an

36
action where they discuss a problem with the persons who are
involved r the inmates and the guards on the floor, et cetera.
And after this adjustment Committee rules on this case, then
they take further action.

They may confine a person in his

cell or they may confine the inmate in a private housing
unit or they may take away specific privileges.
Up to this time, you must realise

that there is

absolutely no provision for taking away good time.
is taken away subsequently.

Good time

They have to go through further

proceedings to get to the point where they can actually take
away good time.
After the Adjustment Committee has made their
ruling, only until there are persistent violations after
that could they possibly refer this to a Superintendent’s
Proceeding.

At a Superintendent’s Proceeding, if one is

had, we have a formal procedure of due process where a
person is represented by an employee of the state prison.
Q

Are yon talking about administrative

remedies?
MR. SQRGE:

Yes, exactly, Your Honor.

administrative remedies really, Your Honor.

Not

This is an

administrative procedure for taking away good time.

There

are only two procedures that we can find for taking away good
time.

This is one of them,

And 1 am using this example

merely to show the disciplinary and the punitive nature of

37
this f to show that the factor of good time is based upon
good behavior.
Q

Would there have been any discretion in the

administrators to grant good time in this case?
MR. SORG'S %

x am not exactly sure if 1 understand

your question. Your Honor.
Q

As far as-*-

1 will put it this way.

Does the statute

require the discrimination to which you are objecting?
MR. SORGEs
Q

Section 230, subdivision (3) dees, yes.

It just requires it; it is not a matter of

an administrative application—
MR. SORGEs

Oh, definitely not.

The statute states

specifically that—
Q

The prison administration would have no

discretion whatsoever to vary from the statute?
MR. SORGEs
Q

Ho, X believe they would not.

Your view of the matter would require, would

it not, that the state institution give credit as though the
man’s behavior had been of the highest order even though that
might be contrary to the fact?
MR. SORGEs

If it is contrary to the fact, all they

have to do is look at the file sent from the county jails
which indicate what jail time should be credited to the
person and also gives a portfolio of the defendant’s actions.
Q

Are you suggesting that those files are a

complete substitute for their own observations and their own
standards in the state institution?
MR. SORGE:
is concerned.

Yes, Your Honor, as far as good behavior

I do not believe that you have to have a vary

complicated procedure to determine whether a person has been
faithfully abiding by the rules of a specific penal
institution.

1 do not believe that there should be a

difference in the location of the detention facility, as far
as good behavior is concerned.
Q

And you would carry this again in the

hypothetical 1 gave you, if he were in the prison in Hawaii
or Alaska?
MR. SGRGEt
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

But. you would not undertake to carry it

beyond out continental boundaries, I gather?
MR. SORGEs

I just believe that it might foe a little

bit too complex, and I am not prepared to argue that issue.
There is a very good possibility that it would apply equally
to that jurisdiction also.
1 believe also, while we are returning to the

Superintendent’s Proceeding, here we have one example,
administrative action or procedure which is definitely
punitive in nature.

It is definitely a disciplinary board in

nature which takes away good time.

In response to this, the

Attorney General has stated that there is another board.

39

This is a Time Allowance Cortsnittee*

And he states that the

Time Allowance Committee considers more than just the
behavior of the inmate while in prison in determining whether
good time should be allowed or not.
And I would like to state the—specifically I would
like to quote from a statute which determines or which directs
exactly what the purpose of this committee is.

This is found

on page 60a of the Appendix and also recognised in the
Appellant's Brief on page 6,

They state that in regard to

this board; whether they should allow good time or not/ they
say the board shall have discretion of withholding the good
time allowance asP and I quote, "a punishment for offenses
against the discipline of the prison or penitentiary in
accordance with the rules hereinbefore mentioned, reduction
credited to a prisoner in the first instance in his account
by the warden, as provided in Section 230, shall stand as the
reduction allowed unless withheld wholly or partly by the
board as punishment as above provided."
I believe this purely shows and clearly shows the
legislative intention that the reduction of good time is a
punishment for bad behavior in a prison.
There are very many situations where good time is
credited to other persons in different situations, such as
good time is credited to both misdemeanants and felons serving
definite sentences in county jails, and this is very

40
important? because the language referring to these
individuals? which is Section 250 of the Correction Law?
states that good performance or .good time shall be credited
based upon the defendant's behavior? conduct? and his
efficient and willing performance of duties in that count”/
penitentiary.

It is exactly the same language as contained

in Section 230? subdivision (3).

And I believe that this

would undermine the Attorney General’s .argument that any
difference in usage? purpose? or availability of facilities
in the county jail versus the state penal institution is a
determinative factor in deciding gooc2 time.
And in this regard? I would like to use another
example.

While we are considering mainly the local county

jails as pre-trial detention facilities? there are other
pre-trial detention facilities in the State of New York.
They do not have the—I believe? Mr. Chief Justice? you asked
before whether they had a pre-trial facility which really
was not detention? which was a minimum security facility—
they do not have any such thing in New York.

However? they

do have two other facilities for pre-trial 'detentions.

If

a person is found to be criminally insane- and not competent
to assist his attorney in presenting a defense to its case?
then he may be certified to various state institutions in the
State of New York.

These are state institutions for the

mentally retarded.

They have two such state institutions.

41
One under the jurisdiction of the Commissioner of Mental
Hygienes the second one is under the jurisdiction of the
Commissioner of Correctiong the person involved in this case»
The Coznmissioner of Correction has jurisdiction ever two
such facilities.

These ©re Mattawan State Hospital and

Dannemora State Hospital.

And while a person—may 1 just

Mr. Sorge.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF G. JEFFERY.SORGE, ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OF. THE APPELLEES , RESUMING
MR. SORGE;

Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Courts
Immediately prior to the luncheon recess of this .
Court, 2 was describing how the county jails are not the only
pre-trial detention facilities in the State of New York.
There are other detention facilities, one of which are the
state hospitals for -the persons who are mentally incapable of
standing trial.

These state hospitals are under the

jurisdiction of the State Department of Correction.
Q

But you would not apply good behavior

standards to people confined in those circumstances
ordinarily would you?
MR. SORGE;

Your Honor, not only are these pre­

trial detention facilities, however, they are also facilities
which receive inmates who are transferred from the state
prison to the mental institutions.

And for the period of

time that these mental patients stay in these institutions,
the State Commissioner of Correction does grant them good
time.

So, I believe that they-—

Q

Is that a reasonable thing to do?

You would

hardly take a person who is confined because he is mentally
incompetent and hold him to the standards that yon would hold
normal people,
MR, SORGE:

Yes, Your Honor, but they are not really

applying these standards because he is being confined due to
a mental problem.

They are commuting this because he has

been transferred from a state prison where he has already
been subjected to an indeterminate sentence and then sending
him to these mental hospitals.

So, he is still under the

custody of the Commissioner of Correction.
While the Commissioner of Correction does give the
good time credit for a person who has been transferred from
the state prison- we submit that there are different usages,
purposes, and availability of facilities in the mentaj
hospitals.

We believe it is obvious there is a difference

between the mental hospitals and the state jails.
But to counter this argument, the Attorney General
has stated at page 7 of his reply brief that it is difficult
to see how this diminishes the validity of Section 230,
subdivision (3), "These are two classes of inmates who have
been transferred to state institutions that have programs
specifically designed for their specialized needs,

willing

participation and performance in these treatment programs
under state supervision would certainly call for the awarding
of good time."

44
1 would submit he this Court readily that this is
quite a cogent argument,
the Attorney General,

However, I would pose a question to

If these facilities do programs that

are beneficial to the inmates and if they do believe that
these programs meet the specialised needs of the inmates,
then why does not the Commissioner of Correction give good
time credit for the amount of time that a person spends in
these exact facilities if it is pre-trial confinement?
do not give good time on this period of time.

They

So, I believe

that the different types of programs is not related to the
giving of good time, and I think this is a specific
example which points that out clearly.
Q
would not

Assuming that it was wrong in that area, that
be any basis for the holding here, would it?

MR. 3GRGS:
basis, because

I believe it would be somewhat of a

I believe, in the first place, it shows the

practice in New York State.

In the second place, I would

argue that it is at least an indication of the state's
intention.

I believe also that we find there is supposedly

a uniform scheme, you know, granting the commutation of a
person's sentence, and I believe that this would also have
an effect on that.
I believe that this presents a definite conflict
in the state's practice.

Secondly, we have other examples

which present similar examples of conflict.

For example.

45
person has already.been sentenced and has been received
in a state prison, if he is subsequently transferred back to
a county jail for a post-conviction remedy and remains in
the county jail until that post-conviction remedy is
completed, then transferred back to the state prison, he gets
good time credit for the amount of time that he spent in the
county jail.

So, here he is being detained in exactly the

same facility as are the persons that are discriminated
against under Section 230, subdivision (3).

However, as a

matter of policy of New York State, he is getting good time
credit for that.
I submit to this Court that this is an incredible
inconsistency, and I believe that the explanations just
submitted to Mr. Chief Justice would apply equally here.
Here is an indication of the intent of the legislature, et
cetera.
Lastly, the Attorney General has argued that the
district court 'misapplied the standards of Equal Protection
in that it did not consider their argument that good time
should not he reduced from the pre-trial detention period
because in effect it reduces the amount of time that a
parole board has to consider whether a person whould be
eligible or not for parole.

I submit that the district court

did in fact consider this proposition.
On page 63a of the Appendix, the district court

46
came out in extremely strong language as a matter of fact.
It stated that the fears of the Attorney General in this
case

are wholly illusory,

i believe this is a very clear

statement of the position of the district court.
Thank you very much, Your Honor.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;
MR. OOLODNER%

Thank you, Mr. Serge.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERe

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY MICHAEL OOLODNER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. COLODNER;

I would like to answer two of the

contentions raised by the attorney for the appellees.

First

of all, there is a certain amount of play in the institution
between people who are once sent to state prison and then
for various reasons have to be sent to institutions.

And one

of the examples raised is someone who has to return to the
county jail because he is contesting a post-conviction
proceeding like coram nobis the validity of his sentence, and
he might remain in this county jail for a few days or a few
weeks, depending on how long it takes.
Certainly we are not going to say that these people
are not to be awarded good time, because in the course of
their program in the state prison they have to leave for a

short instance.

In fact, if we did deprive these people of

good time, we would be raising serious constitutional
problems about a denial of: access to the courts if an inmate

in state pr

on knew that if he wanted to utilise a state

post-conviction remedy but would also be losing good time,
he might be deterred in utilising that remedy.
Q

Of course, he might be confined to county

jail temporarily for some other reason.
MR. COLODNER;

That is true.

As a pros '.r felon or defense witness for
somebody else.
MR. COLODNERs

They ore all possibilities.

The'

Kb.at if someone

Could you get. good time?

I Would also like to add one more thing.

Before

lunch the argument was made that the Time Allowance Committee
operates solely as a punitive entity.

It does not at all.

The Time Allowance Committee is what gives credit for good
time.

This is an evaluation that takes into account the

entire institutional experience of the inmate, not whether
he has been good or bad.

In fact, in the Superintendent's

Proceeding that was mentioned, previously, which in purely a
punitive action, the Time Allowance Committee can re credit
any time subtracted by the Superintendent's Proceeding when
the date—

G

Pardon ne«

This argument does not? on your

submission as I get it, that under subdivision (3) there is
no discretion to consider jail time at all, is there?
MR» COLODNER:
Q

Wo, that is—

And what you are talking about is the;

procedure which deals with the only situation in which it
may consider good time, namely, time spent in the prison.»
MR, COLODNER:
Q

That is right»

Is that not right?

MR» COLODNER:

But my point X am making in this

argument was to show that the time spent in prison is
evaluated from a rehabilitative standpoint and not necessarily
only from a punitive standpoint.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
