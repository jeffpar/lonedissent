MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No. 71-1043, Heller against New York.
Mr. Anolik.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF IRVING ANOLIK, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ANOLIK:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
In this case, Your Honors, just to orient the Court
briefly, on July 29, 1969, Inspector Smyth

went to the

Garrick Theatre in Greenwich Village and saw a movie, which
is the subject of litigation before this Court, "Blue Movie,"
and apparently felt it was obscene.
with the prosecutor’s office.

He then communicated

And on July 31, 1969,

together with Judge Arthur Goldberg, no relation to any judge
of this Court, he returned to the theatre, and Judge
Goldberg and Inspector Smyth

saw the film again,

At that point, after the film was completed on the
31st of July, Judge Goldberg forthwith signed a search and
seimjre order, without a hearing of any sort whatsoever,
and also issued warrants for the arrests of Mr. Heller,
petitioner here, and two other employees of the theatre.

As

it turned, out, of course, two of the three arrests should
never have occurred, because before the beginning of trial
by concession of the District Attorney, those two arrests—

4
those two individuals were dismissed in the case f because
they should never have been arrested.
The issue as to whether or not there should have
been an adversary hearing is preserved in this record.

It

is the position of the petitioner that in a First Amendment
sxtuation that we have here, the general rule appertaining to
search and seizure cannot be followed, that an adversary
hearing is essential to protect vital First and Fourteenth
Amendment, rights.
Q

You mean an adversary hearing to determine

obscenity vel non?
MR. ANOLIK:
Q

That is right.

Not -just probable cause.

MR. ANOLIK:

No.

To determine obscenity vel non.

That is correct.
Because first of all, we do not have a clear and
present danger here as we might if a person possessed
munitions or narcotics, something of that sort.

Indeed, we

know from various cases and even from the history of this
case before the New York courts, that there was sharp
disagreement as to whether this film was even obscene, and
we do not, unlike the prior case, do not for a moment concede
that this was obscene.

In fact, we do not think it was.

And indeed in the intermediate appellate court, the Appellate
Term of the Supreme Court, the decision was two to one, with

5
Justice Markowitz dissenting, and the New York Court of
Appeals, the Chief Judge and another judge dissented and
held or said that the film was not obscene,

Fo, we have a

real sharp issue as to obscenity, but I want to pass to what
I consider to be an even mere paramount issue.
The problem that we face here is that once this
film was seized and the print taken—
Q

Was it the only print?

MR. ANOLIK:
Q

Yes, the only print.

Does that appear clearly in the record?

MR. ANOLIK:

No, it

does not.

It does not appear

clearly in the record.
Q

Then how do you assume it?

MR. ANOLIK:

I can only say you asked a question

and it has been told to me.

The District Attorney has taken

the liberty toward the end of his brief to go outside the
record to tell you what his experience has been with respect
to subpoenas, and I ask this Court to accept it or reject it.
Q

Like the picture in the previous case, is this

also showing in Washington?
MR. ANOLIK:
know.

I real3.v do not know.

I really do not

However, let us assume, Justice Brennan, that arguendo

it is the only print, because I do not want to go—
Q

You do not think that makes a difference?

MR. ANOLIK:

It makes a difference—-no, I do not

6

think it makes a difference at all.
Q

The only print what, that is in existence?

MR, ANOLXKs

Apparently the only one in existence.

Could there not he another question whether

Q

there is more than one print that might be available to this
man?
MR. AHOLIK:

Apparently there was no other

available to this man, but we have an overriding problem
here.
Q

Is that clear in the record?

MR. ANG3LIK:

No, it is not clear in the record.

I am asking the Court to assume arguendo, however, that that
is the—
Q
questions.

You appreciate why we are asking those
You recall in both A Quantity of Books and

Marcus the end result there was to take everything right out
of circulation.
MR. ANOLIK:

I know that.

However, we maintain

that the seizure of a film must be equated with the seizure
of a mass quantity of books.
Q

Whyv if there is another film available?

MR. ANOLIK:

Let us assume there is another film

available, Justice White.

The deterrent effect of an

immediate arrest for showing that other film casts a chilling
effect and an impossible burden.

7
q

Marcus and Quantity -lid not hold that the

man could not be arrested right then.
MR. ANOLIK:
Q

That issue has been up many times.

MR. ANOLIK:
Q

I realise that.

I realise that.

Why is there any more chilling effect in

connection with movies?
MR. ANOLIK:

Because of the fact that movies can

be shown to a large audience.

In other words, it is the

size of the audience that must be the criterion and not the
item.

The District Attorney, indeed, in his brief says on

page 35 that this Court should consider the seizure of a film
equated to the seizure of one book, and we do not subscribe
to that and indeed the—
Q

And yet you would not. even have to argue if

the record showed that actually this was the only print in
existence.
MR. ANOLIK:

Unfortunately that was never actually

developed in the record.

I did not try the case.

It was

not actually developed in the record, Justice Brennan.

But

to say that another print of the film is available I think
actually begs the issue here, because it is the adversary
proceeding, the adversary hearing, that we are addressing
ourselves to at this time, and we think that is a very
important issue and we are leaving aside for the time being

8
whether or not it is even obscene.
Q

If this were in fact the only copy of this

film in existence? would that not be such a unique
proposition that it would have been made the subject of
some inquiry at the trial?
MR. ANOLIK:
Q

Perhaps it would, Mr. Chief Justice.

Are there very many films of which there is

only one copy in this area?
MR,. ANOLIK;

Ho.

I would say that it is quite

unusual for a film to be produced where there is only one
print.

That is quite unusual.
Q

Is this the kind of film that—

MR. ANOLIK:
Q

This is a low-budget—

I mean, does it run the ordinary booking

procedures?
MR. ANOLIK:

As far as I know, it was shown in only

one theatre in New York.
number of theatres.
this was being shown.
picture.

This was not syndicated through a

It was only at the Garrick Theatre that
Apparently it was a low-budget

The quality of the film is not even good.

I think

that is conceded in the record.
Q

Is this a Warhol?

MR. ANOLIK:

It is a Warhol film, but it is not

like some of his others which are being syndicated around
town, such as "Heat" and things of that sort.

This is a

9

different type and this was apparently issued through a
corporation of which he was one of the owners of the stock.
There would not be much profit in it if there

Q

were only one copy, would there?
MR. ANOLIK:

There probably would not be.

There

may have been copies on the West Coast; that is a possibility.
That is a possibility.

But, nonetheless, the seizure here

amounted to what we considered to be a violation of the First
Amendment.

The problem that arises, of course, is that the

film itself is seised, and it is true that the District
Attorney argues that a motion to suppress can be promptly
made.

But he casts a burden the defendant to make such a

motion and says that were the burden otherwise--*in other
words, if an adversary hearing had to be held before you
could see the film, then a defendant could delay such an
adversary hearing and delay justice.
right around.

But you can turn that

The District Attorney asked this Court to

assume that the District Attorney or other prosecutor would
never delay such a proceeding.

That is not at all evident.

We .are not dealing with Hew York County alone.
with an overriding consideration here.
on tHe' part of a prosecutor.

We are dealing

There could be delay

But more important than that,

when we deal with the First Amendment situation such as this
where we have a theatre with 299 seats—and this, incidentally,
is a closed theatre, this is not a theatre such as in Rabe

10
or in the Roaden case where maybe you can see something from
the road„

Mr. Heller, who testified—who happens to be an

attorney, incidentally-"testified that there was a sign in
the lobby of the theatre that the film was marked ”X/' that
no one under 17 would be admitted and indeed he said they,
including him, enforce the rule that no one apparently under
IB was admitted»

There was no complaint received by any

member of the public»

This was a situation where the police

apparently protecting some unknown and anonymous person or
arrogating to themselves the right of censorship over a
film decided to look at films and "We’re going to seise this
film»"

That’s about the sxsse of it»
And we maintain that the problem of not holding the

adversary hearing in essence means that the prosecutor can
arrogate to himself the right to seise film and to put the
theatre out of business, because most theatres book films
let us say for three, four days, a week or so.

It is not that

easy once the film is seised suddenly as happened here, to
suddenly get another replacement film»
in

fact.

It is quite difficult,

The arrest of the personnel is quite a traumatic

effect as indeed two of the three arrests here should not
even have occurred.

And the net result is that not only do

you have an economic loss to the owner of the flira, but you
have a tremendous economic loss to the movie house, the
exhibitor.

11
Let us consider the situation where a prosecutor
perhaps not as liberal as some decides that a particular
movie is offensive.

That prosecutor, if he follows the

procedure here, can hand pick a judge—and, incidentally,
there is nothing,in the record hare on® way or the other as
to how Judge Goldberg was chosen to corae down to court.

So,

we have a right at least to speculate that maybe this judge
was hand picked, brought down, and he issued this forthwith
warrant.
If Judge Markowitz, for example, who dissented in
the Appellate ‘Perm, had been used as the magistrate, there
would not have been a seizure, there would not have been an
arrest.

Indeed, this case might not even have been up here.

So, we have that dangerous situation in a First Amendment
case, whereby the District Attorney can decide, perhaps
subject to certain ethics of course—and we do not maintain
that all prosecutors necessarily have the ethics of the Hew
York County District Attorney’s Office.

But the fact remains

that the magistrate came down there and forthwith issued
this search and seizure order and arrest order.
Q

Do yon know whether that is a standard

procedure?
MR. ANOLIK:

1 understand that since this situation

has occurred and in view of Befchune Amusement Park in the
Second Circuit and Astro Films in the Second Circuit and,

12
indeed, decisions in the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, I
believe the procedure in New York County is that they do get
adversary hearings now, apparently recognizing it is a serious
question as to whether they should or should not»

This is

the case which apparently would crystallize whether or not
they should continue doing it, but I am sure Mr. Friedman
will be able to speak more authoritatively as to what the
actual procedure is.
But, be that as it may, in the brief of the District
Attorney he says that Judge Goldberg and Inspector Smyth
did not see or do not recall seeing signs that this was
restricted to people over 17 years of age and that the film
was marked "X."

Mr. Heller testified under oath that that

was in fact the case, and there is nothing to contradict that
in the record.

Merely the fact they did not recall seeing

it certainly is not contradiction.
Q

Is there testimony in the record of Judge

Goldberg and Inspector Smyth
MR. ANOLIK:
Q

or is that just in the brief?

That is in the record.

It is in the record.

MR. ANOLIK;
Inspector Smyth

Judge Goldberg testified and so did

testify.

As a matter of fact, Justice

Rehnquisfc, there was an attempt to cross-examine Judge
Goldberg as to what criteria he used to determine why this
was obscene,

and, indeed, perhaps to determine if he was

13

even familiar with the standards laid down fay this Court in
Roth and other cases.

Because I do not think we have a right

to assume that lower court judges necessarily are always
conversant with the standards laid down by this Court®

In

an adversary hearing, at least these matters could be called
to the attention of these jurists to determine are you in
fact judging this seizure by the standards set down by the
Supreme Court of the United States or some visceral reaction
that you are motivated by®
Q

Your concept of an adversary hearing then

would be where the counsel for the defendant would have a
right to cross-examine the magistrate?
MR. ANOLIK:

At least to cross-examine the

complainant, b® he a magistrate or Inspector Smyth®
Q

I take it that Judge Goldberg hare was not a

complainant; he was basically in the position of-—
MR.ANOLIK:

He was the magistrate who issued the

search warrant? that is correct®
Q

You are saying that in your concept of an

adversary hearing, defense counsel would have a right to
cross-examine someone sitting in Judge Goldberg's position?
I®. ANOLIK;

No.

I would say that the party at

least who is in the role of the complainant—the problem with
this case, Justice Rehnquist, is that Judge Goldberg became
a Prosecution witness, so to speak, in this case, saying that

14
he determined that the film was obscene.

And to that extent,

having become a witness at the trial, counsel at least tried
to determine what standards he held applied, and they did not
permit cross-examination as to that question.
I am not saying that necessarily in all cases 1
would say that where a detached impartial magistrate issues
a search warrant that you have a right to cross-examine him
as to why he did it.

If 1 am interpreted as saying that, I

did not mean to imply that, Justice Rehnquist.

1 am saying

that at least as a complaint in this case, Inspector Smyth—
at least to that extent,cross-examination at least should be
permitted and an opportunity to call to the attention of the
magistrate the precedent and the holdings of this Court and
perhaps the courts of New York as to what the definition of
community standards are, what the definition of obscenity is,
under the Roth test and other tests.

That at least should

have been permitted and ought to be permitted in any First
Amendment situation case.
Q
Appendix here?

Is a copy of the search warrant in the
I do not seem to be able to find it.

MR. ANQLIK;
Q

That is our position.

I thought it was reproduced.

Perhaps it is.

Goldberg did find.

I was wondering what Judge

He did not find that this movie was

obscene as a matter of fact.

What did he recite, that there

was probable cause to believe that--

15
MR. ANOLIK%

That if it would follow the usual

search warrant situation, it would say probable cause to
believe that a search warrant should issue, and he applied
a Fourth Amendment standard to a search and saisu-'-e situation.
That is what would obtain here.

And that is the situation

which no doubt motivated Judge Goldberg.

We maintain that a

Fourth Amendment standard may not be applied in First
Amendment situations such as this.
Q

Mr. Anolik, when you talk about adversary

hearing, what do you conceive this to be?

I gather that

certainly one element has to be that there has to be a
judicial determination that the film is or is not obscene.
MR. ANOLIK:
Q

That is correct.

And for that purpose, what kinds of proof

would the city have to adduce and what kind of proofs and
defense would you adduce?
MR. ANOLIK;

Would this be a full-scale trial?

It would certainly be a full-scale

hearing.
Q

I asked full-scale trial.

MR. ANOLIK:
Q

Oh, yes.

When you are talking about a determination

vel non, I suppose nothing short of that would suffice, would
it?
MR. ANOLIK:

Q

I would say not.

What does that mean, that, you could introduce

16
all kinds of expert testimony bearing on—
MR. ANOLIK:
Q

Yes.

And the city would have to have also--this is

the city, is it?
MR. ANOLIK;

This is the State of New York, Your

Honor, for the County of New York»
Q

The state would have the burden of proving

obscenity in the first instance?
MR. ANOLIK:
Q

That is correct,

And by what, preponderance?

MR, ANOLIK:

I would say they would have to prove

it by the standard appertainable to a criminal prosecution.
Q

Beyond a reasonable doubt?

MR. ANOLIK:
doubt.

That is right.

Beyond a reasonable

I do not think preponderance—
Q

You mean that because the object of seizing the

film is to get evidence to support a criminal prosecution?
MR. ANOLIK:

The object of seizing the film here is

to in effect take the film away, out of the possession of the
individual.

While it is true that is evidence, we maintain

they must proceed by subpoena, and of course with a subpoena
you can make a motion to quash a subpoena.

But in a First

Amendment situation, we would ask for nothing less than a
full adversary hearing,
Q

I understand that.

I am interested in why

1?
you suggest.it has to be beyond a reasonable doubt.

Is it

that it is connected with a possible criminal prosecution or
even if ifc is not, you would still say it had to foe beyond
a reasonable doubt?
MR. ANOLIK.

No.

If it is an innunction, then 2

would say a preponderance of the credible evidence might be
sufficient.
Q

What you are saying is that there must foe a

full-scale adversary criminal trial to determine whether there
should be a full-scale adversary criminal trial.
MR. ANOLIK:

I would say that the standard that

you would use—
Q

Is that not what you are arguing?

MR. ANOLIKs

In effect, I would say, although it

seems to be rather tautological to say that, I would say in
effect that would have to be our position.
Q
position?

Thera is no escape from it, is there, on your

You want a trial to see whether there should foe a

trial.
MR. ANOLIKt

I would say that perhaps we could use

a different standard, because as I understand it, a standard
as to, for example, a fair preponderance might be sufficient
to see that at least some gross miscarriage of justice has not
occurred.
Q

Then you are backing away from your response

18

to Justice Brennan»
MR, ANOLIK:

I would be prepared, as 1 say» to

at least reanalyze the standard of proof in view of the way
you have set the question» Mr, Chief Justice.

I would be

willing to at least see—
Q

Do not let my questions mislead yon.

I just

want to hear your answers.
MR. ANOLIK:

It is my position» as I say» that

nothing less than a full adversary hearing where proof beyond
a reasonable doubt is obtained should be had.
Q

I take it that if the tryer applied the

beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard and determined obscenity
and then a criminal prosecution ensued» you would still
insist the state had over again in the criminal trial to
prove obscenity beyond a reasonable doubt.
MR. ANOLIK:

I would say that, of course» would

seem to be a situation where you would have a jury trial
perhaps on a different scale,- because there you would be
trying

an individual.
Q

The standard for the decision of the jury would

have to be obscenity beyond a reasonable doubt* would it not?
MR. ANOLIKs

Yes» but the point is in the one case

you are judging the film itself.

In the other case you are

judging whether he promoted obscenity.

It is a little bit

different standard there, because at Section 235.05 it deals

19

with promoting obscenity»
standard that
Q

So* it is a little bit different

we are dealing with.
Mr. Anolik* assuming that they follow this

procedure and they seize the man who is shoing the film* who
is the owner and he is also the operator* and you have this
full-adversary hearing and you lose there and you have a
second trial—-you have the trial—-and you waive the jury
please tell me the difference between the first hearing and
the second.
MR. ANQLIK:

The first hearing would determine

whether the film itself—
Q

I am talking about what happens.

MR. ANQLIK:

What happens?

In the first hearing

there would be a determination as to whether the film itself
is obscene under appropriate community standards.
Q

In my case there is no question that the man

showed it •
MR. ANOLIK:

That ha showed the film?

Oh* no doubt

about that.
Q

In the second case what other evidence would

you put in that he showed the film?
MR. ANQLIK;
Q

No* no* I think that x</e—

What else would you put in?

MR.ANOLIK;

I think you would have to show that he

had knowledge and intent.

20

Q

To do what?

MR. ANOLIK:
words j. we

To show an obsceno film.

In other

maintain that there is at the basis of a criminal

statute at. least that degree of due process which would
require the state to establish that this man knowingly and
willfully—
Q

The state showed they went in the place and

they found the man up in the place in the projection room
running the camera and they also saw him picking up the
money and there was nobody there but him.

Wow, what else

do you have to show?
MR. ANOLIK;

I think you would have to show some

intent.
Q

How?

MR. ANOLIK:

That, for example, this man in good

faith believed this was not an obscene film because—
Q

He has already testified at the other

hearing.
MR. ANOLIK;

He has testified, that is right.

But

he was not the subject of the otherhearing.
Q

Oh, he was not.

MR. ANOLIKs

We maintain that it is the film itself

which is the criterion of the other hearing.
Q

Suppose

in my hypothetical they start this

adversary hearing the day after the picture is shown,

21
adversary hearing, and the other hypothetical is they start
his trial on the merits the day after the hearing, the
difference being what?
MR, &NOLIKj

The difference being that in the one

case—
Q

I mean practical difference,

MR, ANOLIKs

Yes,

In the one case we are testing

out whether or not the film itself should have been seised,
whether or not it is in fact obscene.

Let us assume the

court then decides that contrary to the position of the
defendant, that they hold that the film was obscene.

The

issue then is, Did he promote—if he pleads not guilty, it
may be that he was found in the projection room, it may be
that he was found taking money, but that would not automatically
presume him guilty.

Having pled not guilty, he would be

entitled to a trial as to his oi*m role,
Q

What I am worried about, is this not just

like some narcotics cases when you as defense counsel lose
the motion, to suppress, you loss your case?
MR, ANOLIKs

No, I would not think so.

Because in

narcotics cases, there again there has to be some element of
criminal intent and knowledge, because frequently a person
found in possession of heroin and there is a chemical
analysis and there is absolutely

no doubt that the matter is

heroin and that he was found with it and he sold to an agent;

22

that does not mean he is not entitled to a trial on the merits.
Q

As a practical effect.

MR. ANOLIKs

As a practical effect?

1811 say this,

that I have soon cases, Justice Marshall, where there have
been disagreements or acquittals of defendants, notwithstanding
the fact that in a motion to suppress they lost the case cold.
Q

I would not push you to number them.

MR. ANOLIK: ' No, there are not too many of those.
X would have to agree, there are not too many of those
because you were taking the narcotics field.

But why do we

not take some other situation where we are not dealing with
anything as dramatic as narcotics, where we are dealing with
something,perhaps the possession of an unleaded gun or the
possession, for example, of material—
Q

I limited mine to that because X do not think

the others apply.
these two.

I am unconvinced of the difference between

X am only limiting ray questions to,. Do you

insist that they be beyond a reasonable doubt?
MR. ANOLIK:

Your Honor, as I said, if you noted,

I was willing to backtrack a little bit on that aspect.

X

would say that I perhaps should adopt a standard of a fair
preponderance for that purpose and insist upon beyond reason­
able doubt for the purpose of trial.

As I say, upon

analysis. Justice Marshall—and if you would give rne an
opportunity perhaps to amend my rather adamant position

23
previously, that perhaps upon reflection a preponderance
test should be used in the initial hearing and reasonable
doubt in the trial proper.
reasonable situation.

That would be perhaps a more

But an adversary hearing, however,

of some sort must of necessity be held, we maintain, to
protect a First Amendment right.
Q

Mr. Anolik, how do you visualize this

adversary hearing?

The movie would have to be there, would

it not?
MR. ANOLIK:
the point is this:

The movie would have to be there, but

It should not be in the possession of

the District Attorney, because let us say that we won the
suppression hearing? they said it should not have been
seised.

Under New York law, the District Attorney could

appeal that and retain possession of the property until it
goes through the appellate process.

He is not required to

return that film, because that is true in all search and
seizure cases.

The District Attorney can appeal forthwith

if he says he cannot proceed with the case.

And, therefore,

he retains possession of that until it goes through the full
appellate process.

We do not have a concomitant right of

appeal if the suppression is not granted, because we would
have to either plead guilty and then appeal or else we have
to go through a full trial and then appeal

from- a judgment

of conviction before we could appeal that question.

24

That brings me hack to my question.

How do

you visualise that the prior adversary hearing would work?
Would there he a subpoena first?
MR. ANOUK5

Yes, a subpoena.

And we maintain the

subpoena is perfectly all right because there is a contempt
power behind it.
Q

A subpoena duces tecum.

MR. ANOLIK2
Q

To the theatre owner.

MR. ANOLIK:
Q

That is correct, for the film.

That is right.

would take the film away from the projection booth and deprive

Q

I have not quite finished my question»

Your

submission is that there be a subpoena and that the
Constitution requires that the hearing foe very, very prompt
after the theatre owner shows up in response to the subpoena

Q

That is correct, right»

—and then let us assume that the magistrate,

after the adversary hearing, finds that this probably is or
this prosecution has sustained its burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence that this is obscene, and then
what happens?
MR. ANOLIK:

Then, it is true, he is going to be

film.
Q

I would have thought you would say that the

Constitution requires that nonetheless the film be returned
to the theatre until or unless there has been a criminal
conviction.
MR. ANOLIK:
criminal conviction?
Q

I am sorry»

Did yot* say before the

I misunderstood your question.

I am talking about this adversary hearing that

you say the Constitution requires.

I am trying to find out

what it is from you.
MR. ANOLIK:

If it is only after the adversary

hearing, they would have to wait for a conviction on the

27
merits, we would maintain, before that was done.
Q

So, although there is a finding by the

magistrate that the preponderance of the evidence shows that
this is an obscene film, then you say that after such a
finding the Constitution requires the film be returned to the
theatre.
MR. ANGLIK:

Your Honor, we would have to say, to

take a consistent position, that until there is a finding of
guilt by a court, that the film, it being a First Amendment
property right we are dealing with, should not: be seized at.

We do not believe that a clear and present danger

situation requires that it be seised,
Q

All these cases and these briefs talk about

an adversary hearing, and I have a very great deal of
trouble visualizing what-—
MR. AKOLIK:

We would use a standard of a fair

preponderance of credible evidence.
Q

Then there is a finding that by a fair

preponderance of the evidence the film is obscene.

Then you

say the Constitution then requires the film be returned to the
theatre?
MR. ANOLIK:
Q

Immediately or very promptly.

MR. ANOLIK:
Q

That is correct.

As promptly as possible.

And then if the case comes to trial, then

28

what happens?
MR, ANOLIK:

Again through subpoena it is displayed

to the court and until there is a finding of guilty, it
should not he seized.
Q

It is subpoenaed, though, .and then displayed

to the finder of the fact, the jury or the trial judge.
MR. ANOLIKs
Q

That is correct.

And then, assuming it is a criminal trial,

the man may be punished but the film never does get seised,
does it?
MR. ANOLIK:

Eventually, if it is deemed to be

obscene after a trial on the merits, beyond a reasonable
doubt, then I presume they could seise it because technically
it would be contraband.

It would technically be contraband

at that point.
Q

Mr. Anolik, suppose it were feasible for a

copy of the film to be reproduced promptly, say by an
independent lab under circumstances that would assure that
there was no tampering with the film and that your client
therefore could have the original back in 24 hours, say.
Would that satisfy your First
MR. ANOLIK:

Amendment position?

I would say so.

You mean, like a

videotape or something of the film?
Q

Yes.

MR. ANOLIKs

Yes, that would probably satisfy it.

29

Q

This would avoid having the duplicate trials

that you were discussing,,
MR. ANOLIKs

That is correct.

Thank you, Your Honor.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr, Friedman.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEWIS R. FRIEDMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The state has, as this Court has held many times,
a valid important interest in the prosecution of obscenity
and in the enforcement of the obscenity laws.

And that is a

state interest which may be vindicated in any number of ways.
The state has a number of alternatives open to it.

And the

Court has also held that if there is an important
governmental interest which might incidentally limit
protected speech, that the Court must weigh the interest of
the state on one hand and the procedures used so that the
incidental effect can be minimized, and that it is this type
of balance that must be decided in any given situation.

And

what have we here?
We have here a situation where the state has
chosen to use its penal statutes, its penal provisions, which
impose a penalty for the prior showing of the film.

That is,

they do not aim at the future showing but only at the showing

30

that occurred at some point in the past, at some act
defendant has already performed«

And in the course of

enforcing this valid state interest of imposing the penalty
for the past showing, the state of necessity must have
evidence.

And in order to obtain evidence, there are two

choices at this stage.

The state, in the case of a film,

must have*—can have testimony of someone who has seen the
film and testifies to its contents, or it can have the film.
If a person who has seen the film tries to testify, the
problems of proof are in many cases overwhelming, and 1
believe that as the summary of evidence which we have given
in our brief indicates, any testimony concerning "Blue Movie"
would have bean very hard to discern by the trial of the
fact.

It is a type of movie which can be seen in its

entirety—I am sorry, which must be seen in its entirety—-as
the only way to ascertain what this movie is.

The description

is very difficult to do and even counsel with a great deal of
leisure have had difficulty attempting to summarise it in any
useful form,
Gix^en this problem, why should the state be
relegated to less than the best available probative evidence
of a crime?

Why must the state raly on secondary evidence,

which is really in a case of this sort worthless.

Because in

this case, I would submit, that a finder of fact would have
had an almost impossible task in figuring out what "Blue Movie”

31

was about.
They say the state has chosen the penal sanction,
and I mention that because that distinguishes in large part
many of the prior cases in this Court where states have tried
a civil injunctive remedy--that is, where the state has
attempted to prevent future showings.

What we are doing here

is enforcing our right against past showings.
Q

It is true—

You did take the film out of circulation.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Your Honor, the film did not have

to be withdrawn from circulation in order to—
Q

You seised it, did you not?

MR. FRIEDMAN:

We did seise the film and in partial

answer of a question Mr. Justice Marshall had asked before,
the film is currently in this Court's custody actually.
was delivered to the Court by the District Attorney.

It

We still

have the film.
Q

Would it not have been enough for your purposes

to subpoena it for the trial?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Your Honor, the subpoena route is

not as simple, I submit, as ha3 been suggested by my
adversary.

The subpoena rule has raised many serious Fifth

Amendment problems where the prospective defendant is
subpoenaed to produce a document in his possession, which is
incriminating.

And, as a practical matter, we have been

subjected to collateral proceedings every time we ever tar led

32
the subpoena route.
Q

By the time of the trial, the film would have

finished its showing and been out of the jurisdiction
anyway.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

That is correct.

And I think the

contempt power is not a very effective one, for this reason.
As has been mentioned several times here, films are on a
schedule of circulation.

And if the current distributor has

a contract right which limits his right to possession to a
very limited period of time, he may well have a defense to
any contempt procedure.
Q

Ordinarily does he get more than one print?

MR. FRIEDMAN:

The individual distributor generally

would have one print, although-—
Q

Is that the sort of distribution method this

film was subject to?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Your Honor, I presume that each

person who had this film had one print in his possession.
record does not tell us.

The

But that more than one print exists

I think is just facing the facts of commercial distribution
of any film.
Q

I know, but that does not mean much if there

is not a second print available tc this exhibitor, does it?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

We do not know if there is a second

print available to this exhibitor.

We do not know what the

33

terms of his distribution agreement were.
of this in the record# Your
Q

He never put any

Honor,

Let us assume that there were two copies

readily available to him and you could have one of them but
he could go on showing the other.

If all you want is

evidence# just having one copy but letting the other one
show would satisfy your need# would it not?
MR, FRIEDMAN:

Yes, it certainly would, Your Honor,

There are a number of situations where films have shown in
several theatres# even within the city# and we have seized
one print for evidence»

But the problem is this and it is a

very practical problems

The seizure of that first print will

effectively tell any defendant who is represented by
competent counsel that perhaps he ought not to show the film
in the future but not because we are preventing it but
because practicality of law enforcement is that the penal
sanction having been invoked as to one showing, the man runs
a risk of subsequent prosecution as well as subsequent
seizure,
Q

What is the significance of that?

MR, FRIEDMAN;

The point is# Your Honor, that the

were fact that the film is not shown again# even if he had a
second print available, it would necessarily be because the
state would seise it but because the man might be well
advised not to show it.

34
Q

That is a little different situation than

when you effectively preclude him from showing the film.
Q

Each exhibition is a new crime,, is it not?

MR. FRIEDMAN:

That is correct, Your Honor.

I do

not recall offhand the situation where we have actuallyprosecuted multiple counts for every repeated showing.

But

I can bring to this Court's attention a case which is currently
pending in the courts of New York County in which we have
started a prosecution, and this prosecution was started by
the same route as was used here, the issuance of a search
warrant on August 17, 1972.

On August 18th, the judge who

ordered the seizure directed the film to be returned to the
distributor.

That film is in the hands of the distributor.

It has never been produced in court to this date.
the calendar for yesterday.

It was on

It was not produced yesterday.

The distributor is showing it since the time of the seisure,
I believe published reports have shown that about $400,000 in
gross has been taken in in this picture.

It is a film

showing at several theatres in New York.

The prospect of

the defendant being charged with multiple counts has maybe
not dissuaded him, although the statute of limitations has
not yet run in that case.
Q

I know, but from Marcus and Quantity, until

you decide obscenity, you are not supposed to take
effective steps to preclude circulation, are you?

35

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Your Honor, but the problem is this--

and that is why I refer to this case involving a film called
"Deep Throat/’ which I believe is referred to in one of the
briefs for amicus curiae in this matter, motion in brief
which has not yet been accepted by the Court, in that case
the defendant has no incentive.in conducting a hearing.

There

is no interest on this defendant's part to have this case come
to a hearing at all.
We have made every effort, Your Honor-—this matter
has been on the calendar on six occasions by ray count, and
yet we cannot force the case to a hearing.

But why?

Because the exhibitor who is commercially exploiting the film
will not in any way cooperate with prosecution.

And I think

that some of the suggestions made by my adversary are
perhaps suggestions of fantasy, because there is no
cooperation.

There is a reported case in the official

reports which we cite in our brief in which an adversary
hearing was attempted in New York County.

That was our last

attempt, and that also went on for six weeks.
Q

I thought Mr. Anolik suggested to us earlier

that because of some decisions of the .Second Circuit, you
are actually providing adversary—
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Q

How many?

Your Honor, I believe three have

MR. FRIEDMAN:

To my recollectione there have been

Q

'What form did they take?

MR. FRIEDMAN;
on through the summer.

The first one was in 1970.

It went

We served the defendant a notice of

an adversary hearing to be held the next day.

The upshot of

that was that six weeks later—
Q

Before whom s a magistrate?

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Before a magistrate.

Six weeks

later there were three days of testimony given by defense
experts.

Two weeks after that, the judge handed down an

opinion.

And six weeks after that there was a motion for

reargument on the question of the prior adversary hearing.
Our experience in that case led *as to litigate this case
through the state courts-—
Q

You say there have been two other instances?

MR. FRIEDMAN:
Q

Are they different or are they the same?

MR. FRIEDMAN:
mandamus proceeding.
Q

Yest Your Honor.

One terminated in an Article 78

It never went to a full hearing.

What kind of case did the state put in in this

first case?
MR. FRIEDMAN:
Q

The film.

Nothing but. the film?

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Nothing but the film.

37
Q

And then rested?

MR. FRIEDMAN:
Q

And then rested.

And then the defense put on expert testimony,

is that it?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

That is correct.

The third case

referred to is "Deep Throat,'4 which has not yet come to a
hearing.

We have tried.

Indeed it is this problem that

faces us in the Second Circuit

which prompted our office to,

in response to the certiorari petition, to suggest that
Court hear this case.
Q

If there is a due process right to some kind

of hearing, adversary or otherwise, do you suggest that that
right can yield to the fact that some judges in New York do
not get on with the trial of their cases?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Your Honor, our proposition is this.

The state stands ready to give the man an adversary hearing
immediately,forthwith on the seizure.

At the time of the

seizure, the man is brought, before a magistrate.

If he wants

a hearing, he can have a hearing because the state's whole
case is available.

Q

That is, the film is before the Court.

Why do you not have the hearing?

The judge

will not schedule it and hold it, is that it?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

No, Your Honor, I think Justice

Harlan in his dissent in Quantity of Books remarked that 11
clays was a reasonable time for defendant to request to prepare

38

Q

I guess he is entitled to some time.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

He is entitled to time.

And the

He is entitled to counsel, to

Q

That is for the state judges, not for us, to

MR. FRIEDMAN;

Your Honor, if the First Amendment

mandates an adversary hearing, then I submit that what we
have is the Sixth Amendment mandating a delayed adversary
hearing.
What about that procedure, does it still

MR. FRIEDMAN:
Q

Kingsley Bocks.

MR. FRIEDMAN:
Q

Kingsley Books.

Yes, Your Honor, it is now-—

Did that not require a hearing within a day

or something or a procedure within two days?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

That is correct, Your Honor.

That

procedure was not applicable to films in the first instance.
Q

Yes, X know, but-—

MR. FRIEDMAN:
Q

Oh, is it now?

MR. FRIEDMAN:
to films.

It is now.

It has been amended to be applicable

To my knowledge, no proceeding under that section

39
has been-Q

As X recall, that requires a hearing within

what, one day or something?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Yes, Your Honor, and as the eases

before this Court have indicated, those hearings also go on
for months, that although the hearings are required., the
defendants request time? and in Kingsley Books they consented
to the injunction pendente lite to provide time to prepare.
But our experience with obscenity defendants has not been
that of dissent to delay.
Q

If they ask for more time and the court

grants it, that is too bad fox' the state, but that is it,
isn’t it?
MR. FRIEDMAN:
Q

Well—

Are not films subject to a different approach,

in any event, to licensing?
MR. FRIEDMAN:
Q

In advance.

MR. FRIEDMAN:
Q

Not in New York currently.

Not in New York currently.

I know, but consti tu ti©na1ly that could be--

MR. FRIEDMAN:

The court has said yes, although I

believe the current state of the law has been to---they have
been repealed, I believe, in every state but I am not sure,
as a result of this Court’s decisions which have cut down
the procedure.

40
Q

We never said in Freedman that there could

not be—
MR,, FRIEDMANj

No, Your Honor.

But in Freedman

t.ha Court said that a temporary removal of a film from
exhibition for a limited period, pending rapid state
proceedings was permissible.
Q

why does that not still obtain?

MR. FRIEDMAN:

In a case of this type—-and that is

what I see here—this man has shown the film in the past.
He lias not been prevented from showing it in the first
instance, as in the censorship case.

He has shown the film

for several days.
Q

But if yon take the other approach and prevent

him from showing it in advance, then there is some pressure
on him to get on with the hearing, and then it is the state
that starts dragging its feat.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

That is correct, Your Honor, except

that in these instances, and all we can speak of is the
experience, and I think that the experience has indicated
that the state is ready to cooperate and conduct a hearing.
But to follow out the analogy on the censorship case, in a
censorship situation, a limited period of delay, however short,
the cases may differ, but a limited period is permissible.
That is all that the state is raally seeking here, is prior
to a judicial hearing—

41
Q

Now that you have amended that Kingsley Books

statute, is there any reason you do not resort to that
instead of this

type-—

MR, FRIEDMAN:

The first answer, Your Honor, is

that the amendment, I believe, became effective in August of
1972.
Q

That is a good reason.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Secondly, I have been told that the

effectiveness of the Kingsley Boohs statute is somewhat
limited because it is in a book situation.

It had been a

very cumbersome procedure to serve and hold in abeyance-—
Q

It is an injunction procedure, is it not?

MR. FRIEDMAN:

It is a purely civil injunction

procedure which is now contained in the Civil Practice
Act, the Civil Practice Lav; and Rules.

It is no longer part

of the criminal procedure statutes in Hex*? York.

But in a

situation here, we are only asking for a seizure for a
limited period, a very limited period, until there can be a
hearing.

We wanted a speedy hearing, because there is no

reason for these cases to remain in the court structure at
all.

If the film is seized inadvertently—and really that is

what we are talking about, we are really just talking about
the possible effect on the First Amendment if a film is
improperly seised in the
should be returned to

first instance.

Those films

circulation forthwith.

But if a film

42
is properly seized after a hearing, a state may hold it.
Sven under A Quantity o£ Books,, after a full adversary
hearing or in a ease of this sort, after a trial, the state
may validly maintain custody of the film.

Indeed an

injunction could issue after a trial such as in this case.
Q

If there is a determination of obscenity, that

takes it outside the First Amendment.
MR. FRIEDMAN:
Q

Therefore, it can be treated as-—

MR. FRIEDMAN:
Q

That is correct.

As contraband or—

Whether it is contraband or not—-■

MR. FRIEDMAN:

—or nuisance or whatever the

appropriate rubric might be under the particular jurisdiction.
Eufc the point is here there has been a hearing.
Q

Is there anything that prevents you from

going—I am talking about the District Attorney----from going
from judge to judge through about 30 judges till he finds
one that agrees with him?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Is there anything to stop that?
Your Honor, there is nothing to stop

it? but there is nothing to stop it in any search warrant
case.

In any case in which the court has multiple judges

who have concurring jurisdiction, there is nothing to prevent
judge shopping for the purposes of trial.
a judge must foe selected.

Somehow or other

As a practical matter, the only

thing I understand New York law would require is that if there

43
were multiple applications for a search warrant, he must
indicate to the magistrate you apply to the history of the
prior application.

That is, each magistrate must know that

you have gone to someone before.
Q

You testified—I think I heard you correctly—

that if it is found out that it was obscene, then that makeseverything all right.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

I would not justify judge shopping,

Your Honor.
Q

No, but I mean—

MR. FRIEDMAN:
Q

Except as a necessity—

What prompted my question was once the hearing

does determine that the picture is obscene, however it was
seised and under whatever conditions, that is nothing at all.
MR. FRIEDMAN:
Q

Well, to the extent that—

Which is not my idea of search and seizure.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

No.

No.

The question is what is

before the magistrate on a question of search arid seizure.
And in Hew York the magistrate has seen the film, which is
all the evidence there really is, from the prosecution's
point of viet?.
Q

For a minute on

search and seizure, if you

make an illegal search and you find a million pounds of the
purest of heroin in the world, the fact that it is pure
heroin does not protect it, doss it?

44
MR. FRIEDMAN;
Q

Not at all, Your Honor,

Do you want to make that true here too?

MR, FRIEDMAN:

Your Honor, we are not trying to

vindicate a search by what—Q

But you are vindicating the procedure of

property which allegedly is under the First Amendment protec­
tion.

Allegedly.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Allegedly, Your Honor, but we have

in this case—and I think it is realistically true in all
of these cases—we have had a search and seizure- where a
magistrate has seen the evidence and has found the film to be
obscene.

Now, there is some question as to what he found,

and I just would quote from the judge who issued the warrant,
and this appears in the record:

"I had seen the film and if

was and is my opinion that that film is obscene and was
obscene as I saw it then under the definition of'obscene,* !>
That is in quotes, Section 235.00 of the Penal Law.
Q

That is obscene under the state law of New

York.
,

MR.. FRIEDMANi

Under the state law of New York,

Your Honor, and I think as we set forth the state statute
at the outset of our brief, X think the Court will see that
that is as close a paraphrase as the legislative draftsmen
were capable of doing of the threefold task this Court has
announced in its prior decisions on obscenity.

The state

45
statute is—
Q

My silence does not give approval, but go

right ahead.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Your Honor, I think that that

question is one which can be seen from the statute itself,
that the state has codified what it—
Q

Well, why should we have this hearing other

than the fact that it takes time?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Why not hold the hearing, Your

Honor?
Q

Yes.

Other than the fact that it takes time.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

After a magistrate has seen the

film, we run a substantial risk, and it has been mentioned
several times today, of alteration of a film.

We run the

risk of a film disappearing, as it will, and these are not
imaginary.

I think there are

some concrete examples

referred to in our brief where it has occurred.

And the

remedies of contempt are not very practical if the film itself
is gone and the original version is not available for
comparison.

The hearing process itself will have to be held

sooner or later.
Q

Why go through any hearing?

just go and seize it?

Why do you not

You did go through the trouble of

getting a magistrate.
MS. FRIEDMAN:

That is correct, Your Honor.

46
Q

If all you say is true, why did you worry

about getting a magistrate?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Your Honor, because the Fourth

Amendment requires that there foe a neutral and detached
magistrate who ascertains that there is grounds for seizure,
and this Court has suggested in Marcus that the First
Amendment is read into that r which might suggest that the
magistrate must have as close to firsthand knowledge of the
material to be seized as possible in order for him in his
judicial role to make that decision.

That is why the

magistrate is required in this seisure a3 in any other.
Q

And this man has been without this film for

how long now?
MR. FRIEDMAN:
Q

At this • stage three years.

What?

MR. FRIEDMANs

Three years and four months, to this

data.
Q

And that does not give you any p.rofolem?

MR. FRIEDMAN s

Your Honor, there has been a final

adjudication beyond a reasonable doubt that this film was
obscene.

And given that final adjudication, ended 48 days

after the seisure, the state may validly seise and hold that
film.

It is not protected once'—
Q

Forever?

MR. FRIEDMAN:

I would see no reason why not.

47
Q

Would that apply to a book?

MR, FRIEDMAN:

The solo copy of the book that is

seized, certainly,
Q

It would apply to a book even if it was the

only book, it was the only copy?
MR, FRIEDMAN:

That is correct, Your Honor, and

a final adjudication of obscenity has been made.
Q

Then it could be kept forever?

MR, FRIEDMAN:
Q

Or as a matter of fact destroyed?

MR. FRIEDMAN:
Q

That is correct.

That is probably true, Your Honor.

And that gives you no

First Amendment

problems?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

No, Your Honor, as long as the

»

state has—
Q

Do you mind if it gives me some?

MR., FRIEDMAN:

That is why we are here.

The problem

is that the Court has held that the First Amendment does not
protect obscenity, and at some stage a decision must be made
in one form or another whether a matter is obscene or is not.
And in this situation, we have a finding beyond a reasonable
doubt by, in this case, a non-jury trial, a three-judge
trial, and that is a final judicial determination of the
obscenity of the film.

Of course, it is subject to review

on appeal and where the film returned or destroyed is a

48

practical matter, the Court would be unable to review it.

It

is for that reason that the film, as I say, is in the custody
of the Court Clerk's Office at the current time.

But once

that determination is made—
Q

We would not have that problem in the case we

had earlier, because if somebody destroyed it, we could just
go down the street here in Washington to see it.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

If it is the same film, Your Honor,

and I believe the Attorney General from Kentucky indicated
he had not seen it to
Q

see if it is the same film.

That is right.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

And I would submit that if the

Court chooses to see "Blue Movie," it would be very difficult
to ascertain if this was the same film.
Q

Does the New York statute have any permission

for destruction of material when finally adjudicated obscene?
MR. FRIEDMAN:
Q

Not that I am aware of, Your Honor.

I am just interested—after the adjudication,

what is the basis upon which you are entitled to keep the
material?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Your Honor, to return it at any

stage creates as many problems as the retention of it.
Q

Usually these statutes provide for its

destruction.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

There may be a statute in New York,

Your Honore that I am unaware of,

X just indicate that to

my knowledge there is none;- and# as a practical

matter in a

case which—
Q

You mean—

MR. FRIEDMAN:

If the film is gone, the precedential

value of the case is very often gone with it.
Q

Is there not some statutory provision under

which you keep it?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

The statutes are vague at best as

to the right to retain or destroy evidence at the expiration
of a case.

As a general matter, heroin is fungible and not

necessarily valuable after a case is disposed of. It is
generally destroyed.
Q

You do not return it to the defendant.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

We certainly do not return heroin to

the defendant.
Q

But if you do destroy it, you do not knew

whether that is done under statutory authority or just—
MR. FRIEDMAN:

I presume there is a statute

regulating the police property clerk which governs that.

But

as a practical matter, I think the Court is aware there is a
substantial problem in obscenity cases of the bar or anyone
else knowing precisely what the item that .has been adjudicated
is, and that the objects are usually retained for as long as
it is possible to keep them in some form of intact state or

50
another so as to provide that insight for further study.
that in most cases, and certainly in most obscenity cases

So

,

the material that has been seized has been held for years
and years.
Q

Is there not some place in Brooklyn that has

a "library" on it; is it the federal or the state?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

I believe the State of New York was

in the process of setting one up.
actually did.
Q

I do not know if they

The value of a library of obscenity-. I did not mean to use the word library.

MR. FRXEDM&Ns

I think that is the way it has been

popularly described.
Q

That is right.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

But the point we face here is that

the state's effort that New York has adopted of requiring the
magistrate to actually see the material is one which walks,
we think, in fair middle ground between the seizure by an
untrained officer who sees a film and then seises it, and
a procedure where perhaps, if the state is lucky, a hearing
can be held prior to the time the film is removed from the
jurisdiction and the adversary hearing approach in the limited
cases in which we have tried it has been very tmsuccessful.
And I do not blame the judges in Mew York for this purpose.
It is in fact the nature of the obscenity business, which
puts the incentive of delay and obstruction on the defendant.

51
Q

Who is in charge of the calendar in Haw York?

MR, FRIEDMAN:

Your Honor, it is the judges, but

r*Jie defendant5 s Sixth Amendment right to counsel is generally
what has been interjected, and I think not unjustifiably,
where counsel needs time to prepare»

Certainly he needs time

to prepare.

He has to get experts„

He has to see the film.

Expertis have to be contacted.

They have to see the film.

A lengthy period of time is required.

If a full-fledged

hearing, as Mr. Anolik has suggested, be held, if that is
what an adversary hearing is—and, Mr. Justice Stewart, X
do not think anyone has really defined what it is, because
4.ha courts just simply say either one is needed or it is not
and. leave it to 'the states to work cut what they were.

But

lx a hearing is required, then the problem of delay is forced
in-„o the hearing process by the Sixth Amendment, if nothing
else, not even bad faith.

It may even be good faith.

But

there must be delay.
Q

If it were the other way, then the state could

seise and hold, pending what you say is necessarily a period
of time for preparation.
MR. FRIEDMANs

If the person who had custody of the

film requires a time for preparation, if he wants the time,
■dien should the state return it to him during that period,
and that is the practical effect of the question, because we
are ready for a hearing once the film has been seised and is

52
before the court.
Q

I suppose yon might say too that although

frequently defense counsel

in criminal cases will want

delay in the actual trial of the action, they may not insist
on delay for a preliminary hearing,
MR. FRIEDMANs

No, they may or may not, depending

on how it suits the strategy of the particular defense.

But

the question is whether the state must be put in a position
where delay is a matter of right, and I think that the Sixth
Amendment would make it a matter of right.

So that it is

particularly appropriate in this instance where in a movie
case the state's only proof is the film,

More than the film

would not be required, we submit, and that can be held at
the movie theatre when the man is arraigned promptly.

We

have courts operating from nine in the morning until
midnight every day: hearings can be held.

But who should

have the burden of initiating it after a judge has seen the
film and has made a determination?

Because we submit that

it is the judicial presence and not the adversary's presence
which i3 the crux of what this Court has tried to say in
Marcus and A Quantity of Books.

That is, there must be a

magistrate who has made a specific determination on a
specific film, and as to whether he must hear argument or not
we cannot tell.
Q

1 suppose the word ”adversary,“ appeared first

Q

Yes, Your Honor.

—ordinarily connotes, does it not, a contest?

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Yes, but the problem of how much of

a contest—even the Court of Appeals in this case, in its
opinion, seemed to treat it as being a question of argument
as opposed to a question of proof.
Q

What you are doing now, with the magistrate

going to the theatre, that is nothing in the way of a contest.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

That is correct, Your Honor.

But

it does bring the—
Q

To that extent, if the principle of Marcus

and Quantity of Books applies in this situation, to that
extent surely your procedure is deficient.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

If it is a full contest at that

stage which is required.
Q

Here there is no contest at all.

MR. FRIEDMAN:
Q

That is correct.

Whatever the contest may be, I just suggested

that I think Marcus and Quantity of Boolts does suggest there
has to be some contest.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Your Honor, the reading the New York

courts have taken 2 think is a reasonable one.

And that is

that the Constitution in the seizure of possibly protected
material requires more than an officer's statement as to

54
probable cause»

And if a magistrate bringing the judicial

mind to the question of obscenity has made a determination
which for all intents and purposes must be a prima facie
determination, not—
Q

And an ex parte one.

MR. FRIEDMAN:
Q

It may be ex parte—

That is what it is.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

It may be ex parte but that does not

necessarily make it deficient, because in deciding the ques­
tions of obscenity there are no questions of fact in the
sense of an informant type of search warrant case.

be drawn?

From that film, what inference can

And to require the defendant’s presence with

counsel and conceivably experts and we really do not know
what else at this stage, would be an unreasonable burden of
a valid state interest, a valid state interest which this
Court has upheld in saying that the prosecution of obscenity
laws may be continued.

So that we submit that the New York

practice under which a magistrate sees a film prior to the
issuance of a warrant for allegedly obscene material is
constitutionaliy sufficient,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
The case is submitted.
