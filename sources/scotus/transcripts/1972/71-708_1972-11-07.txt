ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN V. BOMSE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. BOMSE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and mav it please the

Court:
The issue which we confront here today is whether
tenants at a larqe, privately owned apartment complex have
standinq to challenge practices of racial discrimination bv
their landlord, under either the 196 R Civil Rights Act, ^itle
8 thereof, or 42 USC, Section 1982, a statute principally
interpreted by this Court in its 196R decision in Jones v,
Myer.
The petitioners here are both Negro and white
residents of Parkmerced, a

3500-unit apartment complex in

San Francisco, California.
They filed a lawsuit under Title R and under 19R2,
alleging that Parkmerced was generally responsible for
practices condemned by both of those statutes,

in refusing

occupancy there to members of the Neqro race and other
minority races.

Their action was against the landlords

A

responsible for that discrimination.

Motions to dismiss were

made in the district court on a variety of grounds, and the
court granted those motions, limited, however, to the ouestion
of standing, which is before this Court todav.
The case then went to the Ninth Circuit Court of
Appeals, where the decision of the district court was affirmed,
again limited solely to the question of standing.

We sought

certiorari, and that was granted by this Court.
It is our submission today that the decision below
should be reversed, and the petitioners held to have standing,
in view of the language of the relevant statutes, the clear
policies which they embody, and the national commitment which
I think none of us would reasonably gainsay or minimize to
eliminate racial discrimination from housing, not only
because that of itself is a crucial oroblem to our nation
today, but because it quite clearly infects our national
life in a variety of other circumstances.
To recall only the most obvious one, the terribly
divisive national controversy over busing as a means of
eliminating segregation, separation of the races in the
schools, in large part is a product of the fact that the races
in this country live apart.

That fact has been too well

documented to really be disputed here.

It’s been documented

by the United States Civil Rights Commission, in its notion
that we are indeed moving towards two societies,

they're not

speaking merely in a social or any intangible sense.

We live

apart.
So what is in issue here is whether the commitment
which petitioners submitted, embodied in the laws in issue,
Title 8 and 1982, is going to be broadly or narrowly upheld.
We submit it should be the former.
We trust that any inquiry on the question of standing
begins and, at least some members of this Court would suqqest,
ends with the question of whether there is injury in fact.
That is a test which, at least as I read the cases, is the
constitutional or Article III cases in controversy one.
But I don't think that there is a qreat dispute
here over injury. This Court has noted in numerous recent
cases, including most recently Sierra Club v. Morton, that
there are interests beyond mere economic oneSf
judicial protection.

which merit

In Sierra Club, the Court referred to

the environmental questions there in issue

as an important

ingredient of the quality of life in our societv.

It’s

language which was also used in a very well-reasoned opinion
of the Third Circuit involving Title 8 in part, Shannon vs.
HUD, in which the Third Circuit suggested, that persons who
are neither going to be displaced nor live in a federally lowfunded housing area would, nonetheless, have standing to
challenge what was obviously going to disintegrate the
quality of their neighborhood because of the effect which

fi

those practices had upon the quality of their dailv life.
Here the petitioners submit that beina compelled, as
a result of defendant’s practices, to continue to live in
Parkmerced under unlawful conditions of segregation, constitutes
a very real injury to the quality of their daily life, and an
injury which, we submit, undeniably merits protection„
In an effort to flush out the rather hare-bones
allegations of our complaint, which of course must be taken as
true in the posture of this case, we submitted it in the
•

•

district court, and it’s part of the record here, an affidavit 0f
Dr. Alvin Poussaint, associate dean of the Harvard Medical School.
Dr. Poussaint,

v;hose clinical practice has been quite

broad in this area, sugqests indeed that persons livinq in
an environment such as Parkmerced, or any environment that’s
artificially segregated, suffer real injurios, injuries which
may or may not lead to clinical symptoms, injuries which may
or may not result in personal damage, even economic damage.
But injuries which, nonetheless, are very real.
QUESTION:Would you suggest, then, that a person
living in northwest Arkansas, where there is present only one
race, are-suffering deprivation of ,the kind you have
suggested?
MR. BOT^SE; Well, X don’t think I can answer that,
Mr. Justice, in the abstract.

We would suggest that there

is no right under the Constitution, or at least none has vet

7
been recognized by this Court, per se, to live in an integrated
environment.

The only right we’re asserting here is the

right to live in an environment which is not artificially
segregated as a result of practices affirmatively proscribed
under Title 8 and 1982,
Now, if your cruestion goes to the issue of whether
or not a person in Arkansas might have standing to challenge
practices of racial discrimination at Parkmereed, I would
suggest, no, unless on some set of facts, which I can't
hypothesize, he could allege the type of individualized
grievance injury which the statutes in Question were intended
to protect,
QUESTION:

Well, I read Dr. PouSsaint’s affidavit,

and it seemed to me it would be equally applicable to the
Eskimo who lives only among Eskimoes, or someone living in
Africa, living only among Blacks,

MR. EOMSE: There are, of. course, injuries which the
«

Constitution and the laws are simply powerless to redress.
Under our system some people are rich, some are poor, some are
black, some are white-? those are not things which are the
province of the law, nor need thev concern us here,
only question is if injuries result as the result of
practices which are proscribed by federal law, shouldn't the
persons who were injured have a forum in which to seek redress

for them?
And that's the only issue which is involved here.
When -QUESTION: What I meant when I interrupted you there.
There is a companion case, is there not, involving those who
allegedly have been denied entrance to Parkmerced?
MR, BOMSE: There is another case in which ■—
QUESTION:

What is the status of that case?

MR. BOMSE: That case is now pending before the
district court.

It is in the discovery phase of the

litigation.
QUESTION: They were not instituted simultaneously?
MR. BOMSE:
ously, at all.

No, they were not instituted simultane­

The plaintiffs* counsel in the two cases are

the same, as has been pointed out.
The issue that goes beyond the mere question of
injury is:

Are these plaintiffs, these petitioners, proper

parties to challenge, or to seek redress for the injuries that
they suffered under Title 8?

It may, indeed, be a concept,

as we've noted, of zone of interest, if that test applies;
of reviewability, if that test, which I understand to be a
minority view on this Court at this point, applies.

It may,

indeed, if we're under the generalized language of Article III,
in Flast vs. Cohen, be a question of nexus of some sort.
But, however one approaches that, it seems to us,

and we .would submit to the Court, that these plaintiffs who
have both privity of estate and privity of contract with
their landlord, and whose terms and conditions of tenancy
are unquestionably affected by their unlawful practices, are
within the contemplation of Title 8, and within the
contemplation of 1982, and accordinq.lv have standincr.
Recall the languaqe of Title 8.

It begins with the

explicit declaration that it is the policy of the United
States to provide, -within constitutional limitations, for
fair housing throughout the TTn.ited States.

In terms of

standing, it defines a person aggrieved as anvone who claims
to have been injured by a discriminatory housing practice.
There’s a broad arsenal of remedies provided.
QUESTION: But isn't that something which must he
read with the other sections, provisions of the statute,
which, expressly the statutory scheme is to see that all
citizens will have the same right

to inherit, purchase, lease,

sell, hold, and convey real and personal property.
Now, under which part of that statute do you say
the petitioners here fall?
HR. BOMSE:

Now, Hr. Chief Justice, I take it you’re

referring us now to 1982 as opposed to Title 8.
QUESTION: Right.
HR. BOMSE:

Under 1982, again we must he aware that

we have two classes of plaintiffs.

Some are Negro tenants at

in
Parkmerced.

Unquestionably they are beinq denied, at least

on our view, the rights which are afforded to white citizens
to lease and hold property.

White citizens are not forced to

live apart from other members of their race.

Black citizens,

Negro citizens are.
QUESTION:

I'm speakincr now of the petitioners who

seek standing, under which part of that particular statute do
you say they come?

That is r are they being --- are the

petitioners, not someone else, are the petitioners beinq
denied the right to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold or
convey?
MR. EOMSE:

Mr. Chief Justice, I meant to respond.

We do have two petitioners here, Mrs. Carr and Mr. Embrev,
who are Negroes.
But as to the others, we suggest that in terms of a
standing inquiry, the inquiry is whether or not, as a proximate
result of practices proscribed by 1982, which you just read,
they are directly injured.

That was the thrust, as we read

it, of the Court's holding in the Sullivan case.

It's the

thrust also of the district court's decision, which we've
cited to the Court, in Walker v. Pointer.
White persons can be injured and can therefore
have standing under Article III as a result of discrimination,
as in Sullivan, as in Walker, as in the earlier case of
Barrows v. Jackson, which are not directed against them.

It's

II
the injury that they suffer, and the interest which they have
in redressing that injury, which grants standing under 1982,
In terms of the companion statute, under which \</e are
here, Title 8, the language is even more clear»

We are

seeking to redress injuries which the petitioners suffered,
this is a case involving personalised allegation to injury,
we claim to have been injured as a result of discriminatory
housing practices proscribed by the Act.
Now, if we go beyond the language which both our­
selves and the Office of the Solicitor General, who will be
before the Court in a moment, think is quite clear in support
of our standing, if we go beyond that to the legislative
history we again find, I think, although no comment at all as
to who should or should not have standing beyond the language
of the Act, we find two principles, which I submit militate
strongly in favor of petitioners* standing here.
The first is the continuing recognition of the fact
that racial discrimination is a pernicious evil throughout our
society.

Senator Mondale, who was the principal author of the

bill, noted, that we must show that we do not intend to live
separately in this country, but that we intend to live
together.
That is what this measure is all about.
Now, the second thing that we derive from the
legislative history is the fact that Title VIII was intended

12

to do something about that discrimination, not only at the
behest of a Negro individual who is denied housing, is
intelligent enough to perceive that he’s been denied it
because of his race and diligent enough to pursue it., but
at the behest of a group of tenants as well, as long as they
are personally injured by those practices.
That's what this statute is all about.

It's about

the right —■
QUESTION: But that's the question, I believe, whethe
they suffered the kind of injury that's contemplated to give,
to afford them standing.
MR. BOMSE:

Yes, I would agree with the Court.

I

think that is exactly the question,
QUESTION:

But is it — that doesn't — certainly

the statute must mean something more than having their
feelings hurt; something of substance, isn't it?
MR. BOMSI*.: Well, I think we’ve come in terms of the
analysis of standing in this country to know that there are
injuries beyond economic ones, which merit judicial protection
aesthetic values, environmental values, spiritual values;
all have been held properly justiciable or proper as a basis
f or finding injury, to assert standing.
The question here is not some mere intangible
dissatisfaction, but it is real damage to one's associational
right, which we interpret to be injury to the quality of one’s

13
very daily life.

I can think of no injury, indeed, which is

more substantial or more worthy of judicial protection.
Unless we are willing to take the view that Title VIII says
to the Negro and to other minorities:

Housing discrimination

is your problem, if you want to come in to our neighborhoods
and live there, fine? but it isn't a problem which affects
anybody else, nobody else can be injured by it.
I think that's a notion which we've discredited
in this country, and I think it's a notion which this Court
has regularly rejected, which other courts have regularly
rejected.
This Court, ten years ago, in Bailey v. Patterson,
noted the standing of passengers in a public transportation
system to seek non-segregated treatment.

Regularly, it has

been held that white students as well as black have standing
to contest practices of discrimination, practices which
injure them, because they are deprived of non-segregated, nonseparated education.
I think we have come, and I certainly think we
should come to the point in terms of racial discrimination, to
recognize the fact that there are real injuries and direct
injuries, and cognizable injuries which are suffered at any
point where a person is, as the result of unlawful practices,
deprived of the right of non-segregated treatment.
QUESTION:

Mr. Bomse, in a statutory case like this,

14
how much help do you think you can get from related
adjudications as to standing under other statutes or perhaps
on constitutional questions?

It pretty much boils down to

what Congress meant in this particular statute, doesn't it?
MR. BOMSE:

Well, I think that that is of course

true, but one must presume, I think, that Congress had in
mind the interpretation that has been given to the term
"persons aggrieved”. The view that has been taken by
enforcement agencies, such as the EEOC, under Title VII,
interpreting the analogous term "persons aggrieved" there.
And I think when they chose to use that language
in Title VIII in 1968, they presumably were well aware of what
this Court had interpreted the term "persons aggrieved" to
mean, and what other courts had interpreted the term "persons
aggrieved" to mean.
So, in so far as we derive anything from that
history, I think it certainly supports our standing.
We would finally submit to this Court that the
standing of tenants should be recognized because they are
going to h© perhaps the most effective advocates of any
racial discrimination in large apartment complexes.

They are

people with a real continuing interest in those problems.
They live -Uiere.

It's a continuing situation with them.

QUESTION: Well, those might be good reasons to
urge upon Congress for specifically granting them standing,

15

but do you suggest that the utterances of some of the prime
authors support that view?

Didn't Senator Mondale himself

indicate that, as an illustration in response to a question,
that what this statute was about was that when a man wants to
buy a particular piece of property or lease it, this statute
is to help him get it, and —
MR. BOMSE: Yes, but the fact that that is one thing
it is about does not, in my view, suggest that it is not about
something else.

Senator Mondale was not at that point dis­

cussing the question of who had standing.

And I'll frankly

admit to the Court, as I think the respondents would as well,
there is no legislative history on the precise question of who
has standing.

All we must do is look to the language that is

used, look to the intent of the statute, and look to what
Congress was attempting to accomplish when it enacted it.
I think that all of those things point very strongly
in this case to the fact that standing should be recognised.
QUESTIONt

But didn't Senator Hart's language

address itself directly to this point when he said that:

as

these provisions now stand,they reveal a congressional
intent, a clear congressional intent to permit and even
encourage litigation by those who cannot afford to redress
specific wrongs aimed at them because of the color of their
skin.
Doesn't that indicate that, at least at that point,

16

he was talking about standing and said it's limited to the
people who are themselves wronged by exclusion?
MR. BOMSEj

I do not think so, Mr, Chief Justice.

I think that in that case again he was talking about the fact
there should be broad enforcement, should be enforcement by
persons who are directly injured, or enforcement at their
behest when they cannot afford it. But it was not suggesting
in any way that petitioners here should not have standing.
QUESTION:

Now, this related litigation that you

mentioned in response to a question, will that litigation —
is that litigation such in its scope that all of the relief
sought here could be accomplished there?
MR. BOMSE: We can’t tell at this point.

Certainly

the relief which petitioners seek for their own personal
injuries cannot be.

For example, Mrs. Carr has been told

that her child should have greater contact with minority
persons, that he has been psychologically disadvantaged by
the lack of that.

Now, if that's an injury that's cognizable

under the statute, she should be entitled to seek redress for
t hat quite apart from any relief which would be granted in
the Browbridge case.
It's the question of the right of any person who
has been injured to seek redress for those injuries, quite
apart from the right which other persons have.
Thank you

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Wallace.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE, ESQ.,
FOR THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR. WALLACE;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
In the view of the United States, anticipated a
little bit in Mr. Justice Rehnquist's question, this case
presents a quite narrow question of statutory construction,
and in answering that question we believe this Court can put
aside more far-reaching problems of standing to litigate
constitutional issues, or to enforce statutes that do not
expressly provide for a right of private action and do not
contain a provision conferring standing on a defined class of
persons.
In the Fair Housing Act of 1968, Congress has
specified two methods of private enforcements

one providing

for recourse to the conciliation efforts of the Department of
Housing and Urban Development before suit is brought; and the
other authorising direct action in the courts.

And the Act's

standing provision, which is reproduced on page 2 of our
brief, is, in the words of the Court of Appeals, very broad,
Certainly the language is broad enough to cover the
petitioners here.

They are within the literal terms of the

provision, and they have alleged economic injury to them­
selves, injury in their social relationships, and injury to

18

their reputation through the practices that the Act forbids,
that they alleged have occurred here, whether their claims of
injury can be substantiated remains to be tried, if this
Court holds, as we believe it should, that they have a right
to have these claims heard.
QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, the words to which you are

referring are "Any person who claims to have been injured" on
page 2 of your brief?
MR. WALLACE: That is correct.

That is the standing

provision.
QUESTION:

"Any person who claims to have been injured'5.

MR. WALLACE:

"— by a discriminatory housing

practice within the meaning of the" —
QUESTION:

Right.

I suppose if you read those

words literally, as you suggest we should, anybody, that
would give anybody standing; because any person could claim
to have been injured,
MR. WALLACE: Well, we don't suggest, though, that
the literal reading is the end of, but it certainly is the
beginning of the interpretation.
QUESTION: Would you agree that literally those
words would include anybody who claimed —
MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

They would confer standing on any one.

Anybody ccming from a different city,

and claimed to have been injured?

19

Ha could make that claim; obviously

MR. WALLACE:

there'd be great difficulty in substantiating that claim in
those circumstances.
QUESTION: Well, —
MR. WALLACE: We do not take the position that any
person can complain, nor has HUD in its administration of the
statute applied the terms that literally.

But HUD has

consistently entertained and processed complaints by persons
s imilar to those — similarly situated to those here.

Not

only the complaints of petitioners Trafficante and Carr, but
complaints by others. HUD officials estimated to me that a
little more than ten percent of their initial complaints and
inquiries, they would guess around 12 percent come either
from — come from whites who are either tenants in apartment
complexes that they claim is discriminating, or who are
customers of housing developers that they claim are
discriminating.
QUESTION:

To pursue that, Mr. Wallace, would it

be necessary that they be even residents of the same State,
let alone the same city?

If they claimed the injury.

We’re

talking about standing now, not talking about evidentiary now,
MR. WALLACE:

Under the literal terms of the

provision, it would not be necessary.

As the statute has

been administered, HUD has found concrete content for those
literal terms in soma of the practicalities that are inherent

20

in the subject matter with which Congress was dealing, and
in the legislative history of the Act, which we believe
corroborates the way the government has been applying the
provision.
We have recounted in our brief that some of the
difficulties encountered, both in our own experience in
investigating and finding witnesses for our pattern-in-practice
suits, and in the experience of the NAACP legal defense fund,
recounted to you in an amicus brief in this case, which we
commend to the Court's attention, in developing private
litigation.
We have reviewed in our brief some of the difficulties
experienced with those persons who have been turned away or
rejected as applicants, who often are not in a position to
know why they've been turned away, who have to satisfy their
housing needs elsewhere without awaiting the outcome of
litigation, and who often do not wish to force their way
through litigation into a place where they've been made to
feel unwelcome.
On the other hand, tenants' organizations have long
been in the forefront of litigation on this subject, as is
recounted in the book by Simon on Dorsey v. Stuyvesant Town,
cited ir. the petitioners' brief.
And we believe this is because of the continuing
nature of the injury that they suffer, and the fact that that

21

injury can often be more effectively redressed in the courts
than the injury to a rejected applicant who has had to
scitisfy his housing needs elsewhere.
And, significantly, this injury to incumbent
tenants was recognized and discussed in the Act's legislative
history, as we recount in our brief, repeated references were
nude in the floor debates to the discrimination experienced by
a black naval officer when he attempted to rent an apartment
in a certain building, and to a letter from one of the
building's tenants expressing his shame and outrage that this
had occurred.
It is true that the predominant concern expressed
in the legislative history was with the plight of those
turned away.

And the Court of Appeals mistakenly, in our

view, relied on expressions of that concern to reach the
conclusion that was not expressed in the legislative history,
the Chief Justice has read some excerpts from it, that only
those individuals, or the Attorney General with his limited
resources, could sue.
There \>ras a subsidiary but recurrent theme in the
legislative history, which we have set forth in considerable
detail in our brief, and that theme was that blacks and whites
alike are harmed by being forced to live in racially segregated
neighborhoods, and that the ham to both races would be
alleviated by the Act

22
QUESTION;

Mr. Wallace, if the Court were to grant

to these plaintiffs standing, plaintiffs who were deprived of
the right to live in an integrated community, as I understand
their language here, how can we define "community" in a way
that will place some limits on the concept of standing?
MR. WALLACE; Well, of course, the only issue before
the Court in this case involves complainants who themselves
are living in a particular complex or development that they
claim has been discriminating, and where they have that close
identification with the particular development or community
such that — I think there’s a reasonable expectation that
their reputations could be injured, and the like? certainly
if you posit the case of a man running for political office
you could see instances where there would be very real
injury to a man's reputation and economic interests.
When you get to the question of. What about the nextdoor neighbor, couldn’t he perhaps be similarly injured?
That’s an issue that needn't been reached here.
has not had complaints of that kind.

HUD itself

HUD has adopted

regulations which, in their standing provision,

practice the

1 anguage of the statute.
QUESTIONj Well, we would have great trouble, wouldn’t
we, in trying to decide this Case and say it does include a
tenant at Parkmerced under the standing clause, and try to
give some principal reason for it, without saying that it

23
either does or does not include a man three blocks away?
MR. WALLACE % Well, I think the thrust of this aspect
of the legislative history is that Congress believed that
whites and blacks are injured by being forced to live in
artificially segregated neighborhoods, and if someone comes
forward and shows that injury, HUD officials have said to me
that they believe that that would be within the terms of their
regulations a person who has standing.
This question is not arising either in complaints to
HUD or in the courts, and I don't see any reason to anticipate
it.

It's much more likely that someone living in the complex

will be in a position to have the knowledge to complaint.
QUESTION? But let me follow through.
the words "particular complex".

You've used

If standing were applicable

to the particular complex, is it also applicable to the complex
across the street?
MR. WALLACE:

If the complex across the street is

discriminating, within the meaning of the Act?
QUESTION:

Yes.

Would these plaintiffs have standing

to complain about the complex across the street?
MR. WALLACE; Well, that question is not in this
case.

As I've been saying, there is reason to think that

anyone in the neighborhood who is injured would have standing,
considering the thrust of this aspect of the legislative
history and the breadth of the language Congress used.

But

24
this seems to be largely an academic question.

HUD has been

receiving 2500 complaints a year under this statute.
of the complainants are in this category.

None

They’re not likely

to have the requisite information to make such a complaint.
And it’s much more likely that the real injury that would
motivate a complaint would be felt by someone more directly
associated with the complex where the discrimination was
occurring, whether it's an apartment development or a develop
ment of tract homes.
QUESTION: Well, you can see I'm troubled as to the
limitations of this? that would be the next case, probably.
QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, do you rely on Section 1982

on the standing issue, or do you address yourself only to
Title VIII?
MR. WALLACE:

In our brief we discussed only the

question under Title VIII,

We do have one footnote, which

indicates that we think that the Negro petitioners seem to
come within the terms of 1982, to the extent that they are
complaining that they are victims of tokenism in living in
this large development where their race is discriminated
against.
QUESTION: So you think there’s standing under both,
both statutes?
MR. WALLACE:

So they have standing at least on the

same terras as white persons, in that sense.

And we've

25
suggested that that seems to fit the language of 1982.
Of course, our principal concern is with our
responsibilities for administering Title VIII, and with the
complaints that HUD has been entertaining, and that the holding
of the court below seems to imply HUD is not empowered to
entertain or process.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Kilmartin.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD J. KILMARTIN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT METROPOLITAN LIFE INS.
MR. KILMARTIN;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
We have here under consideration today what I believe
is an extremely practical problem rather than an emotional
problem that has been presented.

Neither of the defendants

would deny that segregation or discrimination is a pervasive
evil.

But that is not the question presented.
As I indicate, we have nothing but a practical

problem:

Is this Court going to authorize tenants of an

apartment complex, incumbent tenants, to sue their landlord
for injuries which they allege arise out of the Civil Rights
Act of 1968 and the Civil Rights Act of 1866?
Thi3 Court has never gone that far before.

And, I

submit, should not in this case.
I further submit that the decision of the Ninth
Circuit was absolutely correct.

26

I believe, preliminarily, before considering the
question of standing, we should put the interest of the United
States in focus.

The contentions of the United States track

and parallel almost exactly that of the petitioners, but I
believe that their motivation for joining with the petitioners
is different; and I believe that's reflected in their briefs.
Their briefs assert that they have a very small
Civil Rights staff, and an evan smaller housing staff? and,
therefore, they need whatever help they can get from the
private sector.

And that is certainly understandable.

If they do have, indeed, a small staff and are overworked,
they should have assistance of the private sector.
However, we submit that denial of standing to these
plaintiffs is not going to detract one whit from the
enforcement, or from the assistance legitimately available
to the United States in this type of case.

There’s a complete

arsenal of federal authority provided by Title VIII, which is
applicable to this kind of a situation.

The implementation of

national policy in providing fair housing will not be
affected at all; as partial proof of this, I refer to the case
that Mr. Justice Blackmun referred to, and that is Burbridge
vs. Parkmerced Corporation.
While that case might not be a blood brother to this
case, it's certainly a first cousin.

It was filed just 15

days after the district court dismissed this case for lack of

27

standing.

It was filed by the same attorneys as are

representing the plaintiffs here.
identical allegations.

It has virtually

Whenever we appear in the district

court, the plaintiffs in this case are there to observe, and
it would be folly to assume that they are not in fact related.
In each of those cases, in that case, rather, the
plaintiffs are five Negroes, one married couple, and three other
individuals, each of whom claims to have been the direct
victim of discriminatory housing

practices? that they applied

for apartments and that, for some reason or other, they were
refused.
QUESTION:

Is there any question but that they have

standing?
MR. KILMARTIN:

None whatever, Your Honor.

not challenge their standing in the lower court.

We did

We are

proceeding with that case, discovery proceedings are pending,
and, in fact, a trial date has been set.
April 29th, I believe it is.
in the interim.

The trial date is

With certain pretrial dates

And so that case will be disposed of shortly.

In addition, it purports to be a class action.
And while it has not qualified as such as yet, under Rule 23,
it is proceeding in that context, and it is anticipated that,
in due course, a motion to qualify it as a class action will
be filed.
I*d like the Court to keep in mind what the

28
plaintiffs have asked this Court to do, and what they've
asked the district court to do.

In their prayer for relief,

they asked the court to fashion a decree, an injunctiye
decree, which would be virtually binding on no one, except,
perhaps, the defendant.
This distinct possibility occurs.

Keep in mind

that this action is not a class action;'this is an action by
individuals and individuals alone who sue in their own right,
and in their own right alone.
And if I might state at this point, parenthetically,
because I think it’s important, in response to the petitioners'
contention that somehow incumbent tenants are the ones that
should assert the rights under this Act, I will advise the
Court at this time that there were six plaintiffs.

There were

two plaintiffs that filed the suit, and there were four
individual plaintiffs in intervention, together with an
unidentified committee.
The four individual plaintiffs have since long
departed

Parkmerced,have moved their tenancy, demonstrating

the inherent transiency of tenancies, and I can fail to see
what stake they would have in the outcome of this controversy
at this time.
While we haven’t raised it, it might well be moot as
to those four tenants, who no longer live there.

One of them,

as a matter of fact, has moved as far away as Rio de Janeiro.

29

They would lack the personal stake in the outcome of the
coatroversy, which this Court has required in its decision in
Baker vs. Carr.
If, however, getting to trial on a case such as this,
the defendants won, that is, if the defendant landlord won the
case, it certainly wouldn't be binding upon the next individual
who would come along and assert his personal value preference —
a phrase used by this Court most recently in Sierra Club vs.
Morton^
Whether his grievance would be real or imagined, he'd
have the right to assert it, because there would be no res
judicata effect to a decision such as this.
If, on the other hand, the plaintiffs were granted
any measure of relief, it certainly wouldn't be binding upon
the next group of plaintiffs who wanted to come in and assert
what they thought was the proper racial mix of Parkmerced or
any complex.
And it's with that background, Your Honors, that
we proceed to the question of standing.

We just do not feel

that Congress ever envisioned that kind of profound disorder
in creating certain rights and remedies in the housing field.
As we've indicated, and I think as both sides
concede, the standing issue in this case is not at all complex,
in fact it's quite simple.

The length of the briefs and the

plethora of cases that have been cited on the subject demon-

30

strate, in my judgment, one thing, and that is the futility of
attempting to assign to a statute a task or a burden that it
was never meant to carry. And I think that is the thrust of the
petitioners' position here.
They are trying to derive from Title VIII standing,
where none was ever intended, and the statute simply won't
carry it.

Stripped to its essentials, the issue is simply

this: Did Congress intend that plaintiffs such as this, that
is, incumbent tenants, have standing to complain of the policies
of their landlord?
We submit that it clearly did not,
QUESTION:

Mr. Kilmartin, —

MR. KILMARTIN:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

— let me put this hypothetical to you.

It's Mrs. Carr here who is a member of the minority race, isn't
she?
MR. KILMARTIN:

Yes, she is, sir.

QUESTION: Suppose that there were some vacant
apartments and she had a dependent relative whom she would
like to have come in to the complex, and the admission of
that relative was refused? would this be beyond her rights
under the statute?
MR. KILMARTIN:
new, yes, it would.

I would say, as the statute stands

But certainly the dependent relative

would have every right to assert his or her rights under this

31

statute so that if in fact a discriminatory practice was
practiced against that person there would be a remedy for it.
There would be a remedy under both federal and State law, as
a matter of fact.

California has a comprehensive public —-

or fair housing statute of its own, as well as this.
QUESTIONS

But it it vrould withhold it from Mrs.

Carr, even though this were her dependent and she could show
it to be much more convenient, less expensive to have her at
hand rather than across town?
MR, KILMARTIN:

I would say, Your Honor, that the

statute would not extend to that situation.

But once again I

believe it would be academic, because of the fact that the
person himself or herself would have direct rights under the
Act, and could obtain the apartment.
QUESTION;

I suppose, if Mrs. Carr, in that illustra»

tion, were so disposed, again coming down to the practical
matters you spoke of earlier, all that would need to be done
to assure standing would be to join the dependent relative
as a plaintiff? isn’t that so?
MR. KILMARTIN; That’s correct.

That's correct.

QUESTION; And then, there being one plaintiff with
standing, there probably wouldn't be much profit in people
challenging standing of other plaintiffs?
MR. KILMARTIN: That's correct, Your Honor.

Or Mrs,

Carr could take her dependent relative down to the office of

32

HUD to initiate administrative proceedings under 810 of the
Fair Housing Act.
itod if that failed, then that relative could file
an action either in federal or State court, under Section 812.
The Solicitor General has alluded to the fact that
the only thing involved in this case is two or three tenants,
a nd we do not go beyond that.

But the problem has much greater

dimension than that, it has a very significant effect upon
f-V

landlords, and, as a practical matter, the decision of this
Court is going to go far beyond, if it grants standing, far
beyond these individual tenants.
I would like to give you just a thumbnail sketch of
what Parkmerced is, because you probably — maybe some of you
have seen it, maybe not.

It is a large, 3500-apartment

complex of tower buildings and garden apartments, located on
about 150 acres in the southwest portion of San Francisco,
It's near Lake Merced,
Immediately adjacent to it, to the north, is San
Francisco State College, and its campus, which has in the
neighborhood of 20,000 students. About a half a mile to the
n orth of that is another complex, totally — an apartment
complex totally unrelated to Parkmerced, called Stonestown.
Immediately to the south, within a mil, is another
large complex of apartments, several thousand, called Westlake,
Immediately to the east of Parkmerced are hundreds

33

of single-family dwellings.
We submit that within a one-mile radius of Parkmerced,
and we don't even have to go to Arkansas, but there would be
nothing, if this Court granted standing to these tenants, to
prvent the person in the house across the street from asserting
his views, or the apartment dweller in the next complex, or,
perhaps, even the State College student, who spends eight hours
of his day each day immediately next to Parkmerced.
We

submit that that would be a logical extension

and a logical consequence of granting standing to this type
of plaintiff in this case,
X would like the Court to keep in mind that the thrust
of the plaintiffs' arguments are that they are denied inter­
racial association.

That is not one of the rights that is

protected by the statute.

They allege that their injuries

are social and professional, in that they are deprived of the
right to benefit from association with different races.
But the complaints are silent on these points.
There's no allegation in any complaint that Parkmerced,
Metropolitan Life or the present owner, Parkmerced Corporation,
has a gate at the door and blocks any business or social
visitor for these plaintiffs from entering his apartment, or
coming to visit him, or- from associating with him in any
way.
The complairt is devoid of any such allegations,

34

and the challenge that they are denied interracial association
simply fails.

The streets of Parkmerced are public, although

tho development is private,and anybody that wants to come
there can come at any time and visit any tenant in any
apartment, as long as he is, of course, invited by the tenant
himself.
So there is absolutely no interference with free
interracial association, nor is there any allegation to that
effect in the complaint.

In the case of Data Processing vs. Camp, Mr. Justice
Douglas started out with the phrase that:

generalizations

about standings to sue are largely worthless as such.

And I

believe that is certainly true. And I think this case
demonstrates it.
However, we start with, in every standing case, the
Article III case or controversy test, the Article III case
or controversy requirement.
I want the Court to understand clearly here and
now that what the petitioners' counsel said and what the
Attorney General implied is — implies in their briefs, that
is, that these people have suffered injury in fact and were
therefore automatically over the hurdle of Article III, is
simply not so. We do not admit that.
As this Court pointed out in Sierra Club, and as I
read Sierra Club, the injury in fact that is necessary has to

35
be a cognisable injury in fact.
It is not, as the Chief Justice suggested, just a
%

racial slur, an insult, a broken leg, or anything else, but
it has to be a cognizable injury in fact, under the statutes
that are being discussed.
That being —
QUESTION:

You said Congress could have conferred

standing here had it desired to do so?
MR, KILMARTXN:
that at all.

No.

No, Your Honor, I don’t suggest

I suggest that all of the arguments that have

been presented by the petitioners should be addressed to
Congress, if they want to grant standing to people such as
these.

And I would assume the constitutionality of such,if

it were passed, under this Court's holding in Jones v. Mayer.
QUESTION: Then, would you state again, or just
very briefly, some of your case or controversy argument?

I

don’t believe I fully apprehended what you meant by it.
MR. KILMARTIN:

Yes.

In Data Processing, as well

as other case, but Data Processing zeroes in on it, as I
understand it and as I read it, the first inquiry is:
a case or controversy?

Is there

And to find that there is a case or

controversy, you have to have an injury in fact to the person
complaining.

That's the first inquiry.

But, as this Court pointed out, in Sierra Club, it's
not just an abstract injury in fact, it has to be an injury

36
cogxiizable under the statutes that are under discussion.
And in this case those statutes are Title VIII and Section
1982.
And we submit that the injuries asserted here, the
injuries in fact that are asserted by these petitioners, are
not the injuries contemplated by Title VIII or 1982, that
they —
QUESTION: But didn't I understand Mr. Wallace to
suggest that the HUD entertains complaints of this kind of
injury?

Under this statute.
Am I wrong about that?
MR. KILMARTJN:
QUESTION:

HUD entertained these complaints?

Entertains complaints of this kind.

Didn't he tell us that?
QUESTION:

For administrative relief.

MR. KILMARTIN: Well, — yes, he did say that, Your
Honor.
QUESTION: Well, at least that agency, at least,
thinks that this kind of conplained-of injury is an injury
that comes under that.
MR. KILMARTIN:

Well, I think there is more

committed to HUD under Title VIII than is committed to private
plaintiffs, Your Honor.
QUESTIONs

And I think that's the answer.

I see.

MR. KILMARTIN: They have great powers.

They have

37

investigate powers, for example.

I think that HUD is

empowered to investigate just about any complaint that comes
into its office.

And they have subpoena power.

They don't have much enforcement povrer, but they do
have a lot of powers to investigate for the purpose of
recommending to Congress —
QUESTION: Well, one of their complaints, as I
gathered it, is that Congress hasn't supplied HUD and the
other establishments with enough manpower to do the job, and
that's why they want the aid of private attorneys general, as
it were.
MR. KILMARTIN:

I think that’s the thrust of their

argument. Your Honor; and that's what I mentioned at the
outset of my remarks.

But they will not be denied the aid of

the private sector, in my opinion, one whit by denying standing
to these plaintiffs.

Because, as demonstrated, the minute

these plaintiffs fail, there is always the Burbridge type of
plaintiffs who will be collected and will file a suit.
And, in those cases, the case such as Burbridge, you
have issues that are real, that are live; not just abstract
contentions such as the petitioners present here.

But you

have real, live issues.
For example, inthe Burbridge case, the complaints of
discrimination are subject to rectification.

They can sit

down, these tenants can sit down with the landlord and they

38
can talk across the table and, as was the case in this
situation, they were all offered apartments.
QUESTION: But supposing, Mr. Kilraartin, that the
Burbridge plaintiffs sue to enjoin unlawful discrimination
under the Act, and it turns out that in fact there was no
unlawful discrimination against them.

And yet these plaintiffs

knot*? of another refusal on the part of Parkmerced which was an
unlawful discrimination?
Now, presumably, these plaintiffs could redress
that unlawful discrimination, whereas the Burbridge plaintiffs
d idn’t.

Am I not right in that?
MR. KILMARTIN:

By "these plaintiffs", you're

referring to the Trafficante ones, Your Honor?
QUESTION: Right.
MR. KILMARTIN:

I would say no, that their redress

would be to go and collect the plaintiffs who had been
discriminated against, and let them file an action on their
own, in their own name.
QUESTION: But I mean if this type of lawsuit were
aliwed, some actual incidents of discrimination would be
redress that might not be picked up under the Burbridge type
suit.
Because not every guy who is discriminated against
is necessarily going to sue.
MR. KILMARTIN: That's correct.

That's correct.

39
We believe, Your Honor, to achieve that result
you would have to have a standing statute far beyond what we
haxi1© in this case. We think 1982 is clear on its face, and
I believe that this Court, in its decision in Sierra Club,
posited the meaning of that section quite clearly when it
said;

Hurd vs. Hodge

— that's an earlier decision of the

Court — squarely held therefore that a Negro citizen

is

denied the opportunity to purchase the home he wants, solely
because of his race and color, has suffered the kind of
injury that 1982 was designed to prevent.
That is the person directly affected, and not the
person who is on the other side of the legal coin, so to
speak, attempting to assert the rights of somebody else»
And inTitle VIII, I believe it is even clearer,
because when you track the sections of Title Vffi and correlate
them, it seems to me crystal-clear that the only ones, and
as held by the Ninth Circuit and the district court, the only
ones who were the intended beneficiaries of that Act were
the persons who were directly discriminated against.
And I refer the Court specifically to those portions
of the Act, 3610, 3602(f) and 3604 and 3612,
QUESTION;

I notice that 810(a), which is the

language we're talking about —
MR. KILMARTIN:

Yes, Your Honor.

QUESTION;— is talking about a person who may do

40
what:?

Who may file a complaint with the Secretary.
And it’s only in the event that the Secretary is

unable to do anything about it that, then, that person may
commence a civil action.

MR. KILMARTIN: That's right.
QUESTION;

Well, it does seem to me that we’ve
f

got an administrative interpretation, if I correctly understand
Mr. Wallace, on the part of HUD, that the very people that
we’re talking about here, who are plaintiffs, qualify to
file complaints with the Secretary.
MR. KILMARTIN: Well, Your Honor, —
QUESTION: And if they are, then it seems, logically,
the statute means that they also have standing to bring suit
• %
whan those things happen, the Secretary has been unable to
obtain,voluntary complaints, and so forth.
MR. KILMARTIN: Well, yes.

I think, though, to put

it in proper context, we would have to know exactly what HUD
did with such complaints. And what they intended to do with
them, or what they tried to do.
Their conciliation and persuasion powers are virtually
unlimited in this area.
QUESTION: Well, that may be, but if you're right ~~
and the court of appeals below is right — it would seem to me
HUD ought to refuse to accept complaints under (a), of tenants
like these petitioners.

41
MR. KILMARTIN: Well, I — that’s up to HUD, Your
Honor.
QUESTION: Am I not right?
MR. KILMARTIN:

I think —

QUESTION: That’s what (a) talks about, filing com­
plaints with the Secretary.
MR. KILMARTIN: That's right, but I think that HUD
could accept — to illustrate by exaggeration — KUD could
accept an employment contract.
QUESTION: Well, maybe they could, but they wouldn’t
have to, if the court of appeals is right, I suggest.
MR. KILMARTIN: That's correct.

I suggest that

also.
And I'd like to draw the Court's attention to the
specific provisions of 3610 and 3612, which, when authorising
suit, state that the suit may be filed to enforce the rights
granted or protected by this subchapter; and 3612, the rights
granted by section 3604 may be enforced by civil actions.
The rights granted, not just any old right, but the rights
granted by 3604.
The rights granted by 3604, which are at issue in
this case, are (a) the right to rent an apartment without
being discriminated against because of race, (b) the right to
have a landlord not make a misrepresentation to you that the
apartment is or is not available, and (c) the right to rent

42

the apartment on the same basis as anybody else and receive the
same services.
Those are the rights that this Act creates? those
are the rights that this Act protects? those are the rights
that are not involved in this action.
Thank you, Your Honor,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Shea.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT M. SHEA, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT PARKMERCED CORP.
MR. SHEA:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court s
My primary concern this afternoon will be to discuss
the question of the liability of the Parkmerced Corporation
as a successor in ownership of the Parkmerced apartment
complex to Metropolitan.
However, I would initially like to make a remark
concerning standing.

Of course it is clear, and I don't believe

it has been specifically adverted to as yet, that if this
case goes forward at the behest of these petitioners, the
very persons discriminated against themselves will not be
bound or affected.
So, presumably, under a statute which has a
relatively short statute of limitations, and which is cast in
terms of specific discriminatory housing practices, in order
to prevail, these plaintiffs, although their complaint contains

43

no specific allegation of specific wrongful conduct, will
have to prove that Mr. A ca:rae to the premises, made an
application and was wrongfully excluded? and E and C.
None of those people is present.

Moreover, may I

point out to the Court that, under Section 3604 of the statute,
in describing a violation in refusal to rent, the statute
specifically requires a finding as to the bona fide, the good
faith, of the applicant for an apartment.
Well, it seems particularly inappropriate that
plaintiffs who are not themselves in the excluded group should
be permitted, or even called upon, to litigate the good faith
of those not represented or bound by the action.
Indeed, the decision would, to that extent, lack
finality*
There was a question from the Court as to —
QUESTION:

Are you saying — let me interrupt you

there -- are you saying that these plaintiffs would not make
out a case if they established a general pattern, they must
prove specific cases?
MR. SHEA:

Yes, sir.

Mr. Chief Justice, the ability

to sue in respect of a pattern or practice of discrimination
is rested —
QUESTION:

That's limited to the Attorney General,

isn't it?
MR. SHEA:

Indeed.

And I am paraphrasing the

44
statutory language, if he reasonably believes that there has
been a pattern or practice of resistance to the full enjoyment
of rights.
Now, a private plaintiff who phrased a complaint in
precisely those terms would necessarily not be entitled to
proceed.

The private action rights and remedies under the

statute are limited to those brought within 180 days of the
specific discriminatory housing practice complained of.

And

otherwise limited.
We do not contend, as our brief makes clear, that
an appropriate private plaintiff, who complies with the
requirements of Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure, may not maintain a class action and represent
broad — and maintain broad relief.

But that's not this

case.
There was a question from the bench as to the power
of Congress to enact legislation which might provide
plaintiffs in petitioners' position standing.

I believe

that there is no question that that could be done, and call
the Court's attention to the provisions of the 1964 Public
Accommodations, Civil Rights Act, which, in its terms,
provides that citizens are entitled to public accommodations
which are free of segregation and discrimination.
There's no question that a plaintiff, any citizen
who encounters a condition of segregation or discrimination,

45

can sue under that Act.
I might note that the Act also limits the remedy
to injunctive relief without damages.
Now, in the 1968 Civil Rights Act here at issue
there is no comparable language.

And the remedies afforded to

the private plaintiff include damages, penalty damages as well
as the right to recover attorneys' fees in appropriate
instances,
Turning to the main thrust of my talk today,
Parkmerced Corporation purchased the properties after, some
months after the complaints at issue here were filed,

Park­

merced Corporation is a special-purpose corporation, created
for the purposes of acquiring the property.

It had no connec­

tion with the alleged acts of housing discrimination attributed
to Metropolitan, and it was joined after the suit was commenced
under Federal Rule 25 as a party defendant.
QUESTION:

Mr. Shea, at that point, there's something

in the record, perhaps in the pleadings, that in 1970, of some
6600 people in the complex, one-half of one percent were non­
white .
MR, SHEA:

I have no reason to question that

statistic, sir.
QUESTION: Does the record show whether the situation
is the same today?
MR. SHEA:

I suppose it doesn't show that, does it?
The record — there is no record other

46

than the complaint and ancillary papers, Your Honor.

I can

assure the Court that while there may have been some changes,
1 do not think the Court is justified in assuming that there

is a materially different complex of tenants within Parkmerced.
Now, as to the successor-in-interest position, I
should point out that under familiar concepts of law,
ordinarily, a private entity is not liable for the conduct
of another unless it somehow has contributed to, conspired
in, or otherwise become involved in the conduct itself which
is a violation.
None of these factors applies to the case of
Parkmerced Corporation.
As to the pleadings in the case, the pleadings
simply assert that Parkmerced Corporation had notice of the
charges at the time it bought; and, secondly, upon information
and belief that Parkmerced Corporation, in the two weeks
which has elapsed from December 21, 1970, when it purchased
the property, to January 5, 1971, when an amended complaint
stating a cause of action against Parkmerced Corporation was
filed.

In that two-week period, that they had not made

substantial changes in the operations of Parkmerced,
Thirdly, upon information and belief, the assertion
was made that Parkmerced intends to continue the employees
in their real estate office and not to make changes in
policies

47
How, the latter allegations, incidentally, are, by
terms of the complaint itself, based upon public information
type letters sent to tenants advising them of the transfer,
which, in effect, said, we've been happy to have you and we will
continue with operations as before.
In their briefs, the petitioners attempt to main™
tain the position that Metropolitan and Parkmerced Corporation,
notwithstanding the complete separation of interests between
them, which we have made explicit in our brief, are somehow
involved in a joint venture.

This is wholly inaccurate.

First of all, Metropolitan provided mortgage
financing and has committed to provide additional mortgage
financing.

These obligations are represented in the mortgage

in a side-letter agreement.

Indeed, the letter agreement

itself is so detailed as to belie any suggestion that the
lender, Metropolitan, was in any way involved in the future
operating decisions which would result in mortgage
liability, additional lending by it.
Finally, there's an assertion that Metropolitan
has — in petitioners' brief, that Metropolitan has retained
the power to appoint a property manager.

This is simply not

correct.
Metropolitan, as a mortgage lender and as lessor,
under the ground lease, which is here at issue, has the power,
for cause only, to require that Parkmerced give up the

48
management of the premises, and in such case upon, indeed, a
failure of Parkmerced properly to manage the premises,
Parkmerced would select from a list provided by

Metropolitan

the new manager.
It simply is not a reservation of control of
Metropolitan.
QUESTION:

Mr. Shea, isn't this a matter for the

trial court and not this Court?
MR. SHEA:

Sir, the essential question before the

Court is the adequacy of the pleadings as against Parkmerced,
Now, of course, this Court will not reach the
issue of the successor's liability if it decides tne standing
issue.
QUESTION:

Well, what pleadings are before us,

other than the complaint?
MR. SHEA:

I beg your pardon, sir?

QUESTION: What pleadings do we have here?
MR. SHEA:
QUESTION*

You have the complaint —
— that will allow us to pass on all of

these factual points you are producing?
MR. SHEA:
QUESTION:

Your Honor, the —
Is there anything in the record that

shows anything about Metropolitan appointing a property
agent, one way or the other?
MR. SHEA:

Yes, indeed.

49

QUESTION:

How is that there?

MR. SHEA:

The amended complaint against Parkmerced

Corporation, filed at the time we were joined, contains
allegations —
QUESTION: And aren't they accepted as true at this
-;posture?
MR. SEEA:

They are accepted as true.

However,

their substantiality, in light of the facts otherwise appearing
of record, I think is appropriately measured by this Court.
The documents comprising the relationship, the financial lease
and other documents comprising the relationship have been
submitted in the record of this case, which has been trans­
mitted to this Court,
QUESTION:

But, Mr. Shea, how do you get those in

the record, if the case was dismissed on the basis of the
insufficiency of the complaint?
MR. SHEA:

Your Honor, the petitioners themselves

secured the documents, and they were submitted to the trial
court as pertinent to the motion for judgment, to dismiss the
case, on the grounds of lack of standing.
QUESTION: So the trial court virtually treated this
as a motion for summary judgment rather than a —•
MR. SHEA:

It could be so regarded.

It

wasn't

adverted to as a problem by the trial court, and has been
•treated as if dismissal were solely upon the pleadings.

50
However, as you will note in the briefs of the
parties, liberal reference has been made to these documents
of lease and contract.
Now, I'd — in compressing

the remaining points of

my argument, I’d like to point out to the Court that again
practicalities must govern.

If tenants in this position are

permitted to maintain a suit containing general allegations,
and then, in the fact of the general allegations, without
specific reference to any facts, require that a successor,
unconnected with the wrongs, be compelled to litigate in
furtherance of the possible prospect of affirmative relief,
you’ve provided the tenant group, be they in good faith or bad,
with a tremendous weapon to use to impair transfers of
property and to impose their will and their conditions
upon the successor purchaser.

Who,

I

remind the Court,

has done absolutely no wrong.
He simply has notice of charges which the predecessor
owner denies.

And there are no specific allegations at issue,

a nd there’s nothing he can investigate and determine.
The mediation/conciliation process is frustrated
by suits of this generality.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Thank you, gentlemen.
The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 2:51 o’clock, p.m., the case was
submitted.]
