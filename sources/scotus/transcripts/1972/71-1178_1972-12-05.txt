P ROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 71-1178, Gulf States against the Federal Power
Commission.
Mr. Hughes, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF BENNY HARRY HUGHES, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. HUGHES:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
There has been extra time allotted in this case as
you will note and with your leave, sir, we have made agree­
ment for Petitioner to take 15 or 20 minutes initially and
then the Federal Power Commission counsel will take 15
minutes and we reserve time for closing, the balance that is
left.
In the briefs of this case, you have before you a
very broad argument and many allegations that are beyond the
actual record in this case.

There have been subsequent

proceedings before the Commission discussed at length in the
briefs and If this court should find need or reason to review
those proceedings, I would urge you to requisition the entire
record and not limit your review to the selected samples that
have been presented.
If I may, I would like to try to focus on the
specific FPC order that you have before you in this case.

Gulf States Utilities Company Is a utility subject
to regulation by the Federal Power Commission in its
issuance of securities under section 204 of the Federal
Power Act.

In 1970, Gulf States filed an application to issue

bonds for cash at competitive bidding under the rules of the
Federal Power Commission for the limited and undisputed
purpose of repaying

outstanding maturing short-term notes

that had been previously authorized by an uncontested order
of the Commission itself.
The cities filed objection to this, alleging for the
most part various past activities over a period of 1964
through 1970 and I believe that you xvill find their
allegations are fairly summarized in the opinion of the
circuit court.

For the most

part, these were all past activities

and to my review, the only current activity that was covered
in the allegation was possibly the continuing negotiations
that were going on between Gulf States and the administrator
of the Rural Electrification Administration.
The cities did not allege any discrimination.

They

did not allege or raise any specific violations of part two
of the Federal Power Act.

They did not ask that the

Commission review any anticompetitive aspects of the
refinancing itself.

They merely asked that the Commission

review these past historical acts which they alleged and

5
grant them

some form of remedy or relief.
At this point, the Federal Power Commission did not

turn its back on these allegations.

Over Gulf States’ protest

and objections the Commission accepted the petition to
intervene for the purposes of considering the allegations of
the cities.
In its order, it reviews those allegations and It
discusses the problems that it was having relating those to
the specific purpose of this securities issue.

It then

proceeded — and you will note in the Appendix — to the
petition on page 36-A In its order in finding six.

It

specifically found that the matters asserted and activities
alleged were irrelevant to the refund of a short-term
Indebtedness theretofore authorized by the Commission.
I submit to you that the narrow issue in this case
rests upon that finding and I submit that it is not incorrect
as a matter of law.

It was supported in the record and in

reason for these reasons:
First of alls it was then and still is our
contention that the allegations that were made to the extent
they were true3 we committed no unlawful act but whether that
Is true or not, there is still no material relation between
any activities during a prior period and a negotiation going
on with a government agency and the public issuance for cash
at competitive bidding of these bonds and the use of that

6
money to repay the short-term notes.
Looking at it either way, by the terms of the
very order itself, in order C on the same page that I called
your attention to, the Commission ordered, as it customarily
does, that the use of proceeds and the purpose of the issue
be limited to what is authorized and that was the repayment
of the notes.
So by the very order itself, unless the company
were to violate the order of the Commission, for which there
is independent recourse, unless it is to violate the order,
the Commission itself ordered a result that provided that the
proceeds could never

reach any purpose other than the

repayment of the short-term notes.
Looking at it from the other side, whether the
notes

were

paid off or not, the short-terra maturing notes,

whether they were paid off or not, had no effect on the past
activities and had no effect on whether the company
continued or did not continue

negotiations with the REA.

So I urge you that the record supports in reason
and in fact the irrelevancy finding and it is my position
that that is dispositive of the case.
The court of appeals remanded the case to the
Federal Power Commission with order to proceed with more
consideration.

It is apparent from the court's opinion
written
that it was the force of the Denver opinion^y Justice Brennan

7
and the high duty that Justice Brennan spoke of for the
Interstate Commerce Commission in that circumstance that
impelled the court to pass right by this finding of the
Federal Power Commission and place that duty or at least
some obligation to go farther on the Federal Power Commission.
In turn, the sheer force of the remand caused the
Federal Power Commission to assume that it did have broader
responsibilities and the very next financing on the basis of
the same allegations of historical activity, the Federal
Power Commission launched a full, broad investigation of the
anticompetitive activities of these three companies that were
alleged to have done wrong, still without any particular
indication of a remedy that the Commission could offer or a
particular violation of any provision of part two of the Act.
I point out again that in the subsequent proceedings
at this point the allegations were still the same and the
force of the circuit court opinion in creating a duty which
we do not believe exists in the Federal Power Commission is
our reason for being here, in addition to the reason which I
stated earlier which we believe to be error.
We submit that Denver case was improperly applied
here.

Even if — even if the high duty that Justice Brennan

spoke of in the Denver case were transferred in kind to the
Federal Power Commission, even so, the Denver case or any other
opinion of this court requires the

Commission to act upon or

8
consider matters deemed properly to be irrelevant or
immaterial and that was the case here so our position is that
Denver does not even support this case or apply to it , let
alone compel the result.
I would like to speak, though, to the point of
what the duty of the Federal Power Commission might be in
general,

under Section 204 of the Act, with regard to

any competitive activities.
What if the allegations here were relevant?
Our position, which we have taken in the brief and
argued at great length on the basis of the legislative
history is that the Federal Povrer Act in section 204 does
not extend nor require the Federal Power Commission to
examine matters beyond financial concerns.

We have argued that on the basis of legislative
history and I won't attempt to recite all that to the court
at this time.

That is our position and it is stated in the

brief and we rely on it.
But even if that were not true, where do you go
from there?

There is certainly no mandate in the Federal

Power Act in section 204 or anywhere else.

There is no

mandate in the Sherman Act as there was in the Denver case.
We find no other mandate that the FPC, under
section 204, has any obligation to enforce the Sherman Act
or even really consider it under section 204.

9
The next step and the most that I think could be
said is if you reach for authority like the McLean case, the
court might say, well, at least without more, the Federal
Power Commission simply cannot Ignore anti-competitive
consequences.

It can't ignore them without more,

I believe that that would be the next progression.
As applied to section 204, I point out to you, and
I believe that it is completely consistent with the Denver
case, as applied to section 20any

duty that the Federal

Power Commission might have to investigate anticompetitive
aspects would be solely related to the object — that’s the
statutory word — the object of the issue at hand and I would
like to emphasize that object.
In the Denver case, the Immediate object was to
issue stock to a person, the context being that It, by its
very immediate object, raised an anticompetitive aspect which
the parties conceded existed.
At this point, your Honors, I’d like to defer to
FPC counsel for awhile.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Hughes.

Mr. Forquer.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEO E. FORQUER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FORQUER:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

10

1 propose to devote a brief time to the legislative
history of section 204 of the Federal Power Act and the
relationship of that section to the Denver and Rio Grande
case.

It is the position of the Federal Power Commission

that the purpose of section 204 was the protection of the
consumer and the investor by the prevention of any impairment
of the company's financial

integrity and its ability to

perform its public utility responsibilities.
Now, as the original Senate bill was introduced
it provided for Commission consideration of certain specific
purposes, all relating to the use of funds for public utility
purposes and provided that the securities issued thereunder
would be for no other purposes.
The Senate Committee, when it reported out the bill,
changed the section to follow language substantially from
section 28 of the Interstate Commerce Act.

They called

attention to that fact and said that it was rewritten to
attain greater flexibility and workability and would have
been possible under the original section.
The Respondents and the Amicus take the position
that this completely turned around the original purposes of
the bill as introduced and now required

the Federal Power

Commission to go into a great number of things which would
not ordinarily have been Included.
I suggest to the court that the workability and

11
flexibility which the committee liras referring to was more
lilcely not to confine the Federal Poxirer Commission to A, B,
C and D in certain strict purposes and no others, but to give
them a flexibility in consideration of types of financing
arrangements or purposes for financing which would still come
within the general purpose that was originally intended but
not limit them so greatly.
Now, in that connection, the Senate Committee in
reporting out their bill and in their analysis of section 204
said that control over the capitalization of operating utilities
is plainly an essential means of safeguarding the public
against the unsound financial practices which make impossible
the proper and most economical performance of public utility
functions.
I suggest to the court that the committee was there
indicating that they had not changed from the original purpose
of the bill that was introduced to relate primarily to public
utility purposes and the financial integrity of these
utilities.
The House Committee

kept the same provisions and

in their report they simply said that approval must be given
if the issue is for a lawful purpose consistent with the
proper performance by the applicant of service as a public
utility.
Based on this legislative history, it is the position

12
of the Federal Power Commission that allegations of anti­
competitive conduct are not appropriate for consideration
in approving the issuance of securities.
There is one further thing I might point out, that
when the Committee changed the provision with respect to
Issuance of securities, they did not change the provision in
the Public Utility Holding Company Act with respect to the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
Q

Mr. Forquer, if you will help rue out, and

maybe I am asking a question I shouldn't ask, but initially
the FPC opposed the granting of cert in this case, did it not?
MR. FORQUER:

That is correct.

They — and I think

the Solicitor General’s filing indicated that tirhile we felt
that the decision of the court below was incorrect, that we
could live with it because the Commission took advantage of
the court’s saying below that you don’t need to try it
immediately and before you permit any authorization of
securities and the Commission has since that time treated
matters of this kind as a complaint and set them for hearing
as they have done in subsequent proposed issuances of Gulf
States.
Q

Do I take that to mean that you feel now you

can’t live with it?
MR. FORQUER:

No, we feel that it is wrong and

when this court granted certiorari we wanted to present our

13
arguments to show that we felt that the result reached by the
court below was not correct.

We had a number of matters

pending which we wished this court to review and simply
didn’t think that this would discommode us as much as some of
the others.
I would like also to point out to the court that
the issuance of securities by public utilities, subject to the
jurisdiction of the Federal Power Commission, do not come to
the Federal Power Commission in all cases.

The very act

which we are talking about provided that if the utility was
organised and operating in a state under whose laws security
issues are regulated by a state commission, they could get
approval by the state regulatory authority and need not come
to the Federal Power Commission.
A vast majority of the public utilities in this
country now obtain their security issuance approvals through
that provision.

Furthermore, any utility subject to the

Public Utility Holding Company Act must get approval from the
Securities and Exchange Commission and in the same case below
the court ruled that no consideration need be given to any
competitive allegations by the Securities and Exchange
Commission.

We agree with that.

The practical effect, however, other than the
deferral of any action on the anti-trust and an allowance of
immediate security issuance is such that the utility would

not be able to meet its responsibilities to its customers
if, in fact, the Commission estopped in its tracks and said,
"You cannot authorize the issuance of securities pending a
completion of a review of antitrust and the possibility of
relief thereunder.11
We suggest that the Commission has broad powers
under the operating functions of the utilities and that it
is more appropriate and more consistent with legislative
history for the complainants to come before the Commission
and point out the relief they want in order to cease these
anticompetitive effects.
I want to turn now to the Denver and Rio Grande
case to which Mr. Hughes averred and which is the main
reliance of the parties here in asserting that the Commission
must consider anticompetitive effects.
*

Nov*, in the Denver and Rio Grande case, the
Greyhound Corporation bought, I think it was 20 percent of
the stock of the Railway Express Agency and came before the
Interstate Commerce Commission under 20-A of the Interstate
Commerce Act, the one after which 20H of the Federal Power Act
was patterned, and asked for approval of that acquisition of
stock.
Nov;, under section five of the Interstate Commerce
Act, they also have to come in
involved.

if there is control

Now, 20 percent of the stock might or might not

15
involve control and this court faced both of those problems
but they said the Commission could defer action on the
section five pending consideration of further stock
acquisitions which were included in the agreement between
these two regulated carriers but the court was

troubled

most and said the significant question which the ICC must
face is whether it is in the public interest that the REA
continue to be owned by other transport companies and
specifically by Greyhound.
Now, I should like to point out to the court that
if we had a REA-Greyhound situation under the Federal Power
Act , the acquisition of stock by one utility from another
utility, that under a wholly different section of the Act,
section 203, that the acquiring utility must come in and get
the approval of the Federal Power Commission before they can
consummate the transaction.
This is the same section which provides for
comparable approvals for mergers, consolidations, matters of
that kind which probably more openly than anything else
raise questions of anticompetitive conduct and antitrust
violations.
The Commission has always, in those cases,
considered, discussed and made findings with respect to the
anticompetitive situation that exists so that basically, in
summary, it is the position of the Commission that the

16
legislative history of section 20*t indicates that the
Commission's authority there was

directed to the financial

integrity and the proper functioning of a public utility and
that if porpositions are raised with respect to the
acquisition of securities9 such as was true in the Denver
and Rio Grande case9 that the Commission can and must take
care of it under section 203;, they must and will consider
anticompetitive effects of that

acquisition.

We suggest further that if there are anti­
competitive considerations involved in these matters that the
complainant should come before the Commission and specify
the relief they want and ask for action under one of the
provisions with respect to Interconnections, with respect to
undue preferences or discriminations, with respect to rates
which are too high.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. McDiarmid.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT C. McDIARMID, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT CITIES
MR. MC DIARMID:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the court:
I've been listening all morning to the arguments
that have been made by the industry and by the FPC in
support thereof and what this really comes down to is a very
sophisticated, very serious argument but the real analogy is

17
the classic carnival shell game.
Now, in this case, the PPC and

Gulf States are

together playing one shell game and Gulf States is playing
another one on the side.

The trouble with this shell game i3

that it is that it is called, "Jurisdiction, jurisdiction,
who has got the jurisdiction?" and everybody says, "No, we
haven't got it."

You go up and you turn over a shell and

there isn't any there.

It is somewhere else.

Now, the problem with this is, what we are dealing
with here is the nation's largest industry in terms of
finances, compared to coraparitively small city and publiclyowned systems who cannot stand the legal fees and consultant's
fees involved in playing this kind of a shell game.

Maybe If

eventually vie persisted in doing everything the PPC says we
would do, we would find the magic jurisdiction somewhere or
another, but I can cite for you several areas where vie have
tried precisely what they say and where they then say, oh, no,
we were wrong somewhere else.

A classic example, I suppose, is the Elbow Lake
Otter Tail

situation.

Novi, that is not my case, but I do

know that Elbow Lake vient to the PPC and said, "Look, Otter
Tail is doing all these services for other people.
wheeling for other people.

They are

We want them to interconnect with

us," and the PPC said, "Well, we’ll order them to Interconnect
but as to the rest of this, this is none of our business.

We

18
haven’t got any authority.

No jurisdiction.

Go look some­

where else.”
The government may assume Otter Tail didn’t have
the finances to take that case to the court and the government
did.

Now that they have won, the FPC says, "Oh, no, no, no,

this is really our responsibility after all and, really, we
want to look at it."
*

Well, this is the sort of thing which just really
cannot be sustained.

Now, what is involved here is the

electrical industry.

The electrical industry obtains a

great deal of money every year from its rate payers.

They are

required to pay it day in and day out for the electrical
energy which they furnish.
It used to be at the time that the 1935 Act — the
Act here involved was passed — that there was an assumption
which Dosher De Vene, whose testimony is relied upon by
everybody, shared and, indeed, relied on directly, when the —that when an electric utility which obtains land by eminent
domain, the use of the power of the state, requires payment
by use of the power of the state, when it

puts in its

transmission lines, when it puts in its generation, then it
*

is under a public utility obligation to serve all on an
equal basis.
It used to be thought that there was a public
utility obligation to serve at wholesale if somebody chose to

19
be served at wholesale if somebody chose to be served at
wholesale and Dosher De Vene at page 5^1 of the House hearings
referred to a number of cases which he assumed as being the
law, one of which is a case called North Carolina Public
Service Company against Southern Power Company 282 Fed 837
and I commend that case to your attention for an explanation
of what the general thinking was at that time.
Now, what we have here, the facts in this case,
are a situation where these three

companies, Gulf States,

CLE Co and the Louisiana Power and Light, had amongst them­
selves and with others, some very good cooperation
arrangements.

They coordinated amongst themselves. They
of them
transmit for each other, although some/prefer to call it
purchase and sale at the same time.
energy.

They exchange economy

They do all the things that were before this court

in the Gainesville case, the things that came out of
coordination.
And on the other side we have two cities, small
cities I might say, the Louisiana Electric Cooperative and
we have one chemical company.
Now, over a period of years LEC and we had gone to
these companies and we had said, "Look, you have this very
nice arrangement.

It will save you money

if you let us in

on it because we will be there to add to the reliability
the same kinds of things you can."

of

And their response was to

20
tell us to go fly a kite, but politely.
As a result of this, the LEG determined to put in
its own generation and transmission system,obtained
authorization from the Federal Government so to d.o and was
immediately hit with a series of lawsuits, x^hat appear to us
to be outright lies and misrepresentations now that we see
what happened and the presentations to public officials sub
rosa with a whole panoply of things which any company with
enought money to spend on attorneys' fees and the desire so
to do can come up with and the result of this was to stall.
The loan could not be granted while the litigation was
pending.

The companies knew this.

They made sure that there

was litigation pending at all times.
Now, after even they no longer had the gall to go
back and argue to the district court that which they had
been thrown out of the Fifth Circuit twice on, what did they
do?

They went out and they obtained supposedly independent

plaintiffs to bring the same action in state courts and
federal courts.
Q

This is all in the record, I take it?

MR.MCDIARMID: Well, your Honor, we have learned
more and more about it since then.

Soms of it was in the

record.
Q
the record.

I would suggest you confine yourself to

21
MR. MC DIARMID:

Yes, your Honor, it is mainly in

the record.
Q

Well, stay in the record, if you will.

MR. MC DIARMID:

I’ll try not to go outside it,

your Honor.
Now, true, the society has an interest in main­
taining the right of access to courts but there is a counter
vailing interest

which the society has always maintained

and In most states it Is called "jeopardy in maintenance,
barritry, abusive process."

There is that opposing.

There

is a limit to the degree to which you can use the courts.
Now, in effect- —
Q

Now, what has all this go to do with the

issues in this case?
MR. MC DIARMID:

Well, your Honor, I am trying to

explain what has happened and I take it that one of the
issues is —
Q

Well, what is the issue in the case?

MR. MC DIARMID:

The basic issue in this case,

your Honor, is whether or not the Federal Power Commission
under section 204 is required to look at uses, the proposed
uses of moneys which it authorizes, to see whether or not
those uses are illegal, anticompetitive or Inconsistent with
the purposes of the Federal Power Act.
Now, one of the arguments that has been made

22
effectively here is that the antitrust laws do not apply to
thi3 Industry or to this kind of thing and therefore the PPC
is not going to bother.
To a certain degree, I think, I am trying to
answer that argument to explain as best I can that as we see
it, yes, the antitrust lav/s do apply either of their own
force or through the Federal Power Act to the kind of
conduct we are talking about here.
It is a subtle question, your Honor.
The short of all of this was that these companies
managed to effectively kill our pool and thereafter refused
to provide for us the same services or similar services
which they were providing to themselves and to others.
Now, this particular phase of this hassle began
when Gulf States filed an application for authorization of
$30 million in long-term securities.

Now, Gulf States said

when it filed this that it intended to use this $30 million
to pay off a

portion of an $80 million authorization which

had been granted the previous year.
What Gulf States has not told you, and what the
Commission refused to concede until it was passed by the
court below, to furnish in writing, was that the grant of
this $30 million in long-term bond authorization freed that
much more authorization under the short-term financing so
that instead of having $80 million of financing authorization

??-A

as they had previously had, they now had $110 million in
financing authorization.
Now, the regulations under the Federal Power Act
require that when you submit an application for approval of
financing, you spell out with some particularity what it is
you intend to spend it on and, unfortunately, at this time,
simply
Gulf States/said they intended to use this to pay off some
of their short term bonds.

The previous statement had been

that they intended to use it for general corporate purposes
plus some of the construction which they specified.
We said we thought quite consistently with the
purpose of the statute and the statutory language, that
statute section 204 requires that the FPC look at and approve
the purposes for which the proceeds of this financing will
be utilized and we said, although

Gulf States has not com-

plied with the usual regulatory requirement of spelling out
what it is they wish to use it for, we believe that Gulf
States Intends to use some portion of this $30 million
additional as they have In the past been using it for the
suppression of our pool, continued suppression of our pool.
Now, the FPC went off on the grounds that they
didn’t see — apparently went off on the grounds that they
simply did not believe that the additional — that the
complete authorization would be

110 instead of 80.

They

apparently went off on grounds that can be read as saying

23
>ic)

that there wouldn’t be no additional money available to
Gulf States and therefore didn’t make any differences which
might have been reasonable if so, but, as later turned out,
and the Commission has effectively confessed error on that
issue, that that is not the case.
So we are brought, effectively, to the issue of
vrtiat the statute requires.

Now, the FPC has left this

section of the statute relatively unused.

As you all know, a

new statute has certain priorities and the FPC assigned
priorities at the beginning to other issues which were
probably much more pressing in terms of the immediate impact.
The FPC did not do anything at all of any signifi­
cance under section 204 until the Pacific Power and Light
oase, a noncontested case where the issue was raised by
Commissioner Morgan to whose dissenting opinion I would refer
you with considerable pleasure.

This is really the first contested case under this
section of the statute and the FPC continues to take the
basic position that as for matters of its own convenience it
does not wish to look at the issues the statute refers to it.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will resume at this

point after a recess for luncheon.
(Thereupon, at 12:00 o’clock noon, a recess was
taken for luncheon until 1:02 o’clock p.m.)

24

AFTERNOON SESSION
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You may resume,

Mr. Me Diarmid.
MR. MC DIARMID:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

At the conclusion, this morning, I was at the point
where we had gone to the FPC and we effectively told the FPC
that we had had a

pool.

The companies had insisted on

killing our pool, absorbing one of the members of our pool
into their pool against its will and building transmission to
lock It in and a number of other things we thought were
illegal and we thought the Commission had some responsibility
to look at the purposes of the financing to see whether any
of that financing was going to be used to continue the anti­
competitive purposes which the companies had theretofore been
spending their money on.
Now, the court of appeals correctly found that
there is a statutory obligation upon the FPC under section 204
to examine the purposes for which this money was to be spent,
this additional money and to ascertain whether those purposes
were compatible with the public interest for a lawful object.
The court of appeals vrent one step short, we think,
in suggesting that the FPC might allow a particular financing
to go through in its entirety, even though there was a
question as to some part of it because that necessarily means
that the anticompetitive purpose for which a particular

25
amount of money was going to be spent would be carried out
and that there would be no recourse.
Now* the statute we think is clear enough for
reasons which we

explained around pages 28 and 29 of our

brief.
The FPC in Gulf States suggested that there are
alternative means which we should follow, including a triple
damage action which we had reason to explain to you this
morning in the Otter Tail case can become extremely
expensive, long, and not very helpful.
The nice thing about section 204, so far as we are
concerned, intervenors is concerned, is that it is virtually
the only place in the Federal Power Act where the companies
have any incentive to cooperate in an expeditious result.
Mr. Justice Brennan some years ago in the case called
LP and Elegance Tibideau commented in dissent that these
companies had a strategy of delay which was being
successful beyond their wildest dreams and that, we think,
has been plainly proven to be the case.
In section 204, as the court below found, the
FPC has ample authority to allow those portions of a
financing as to which there is no contest to

go through, to

be finished, to be done with, the company to be protected
and to retain those issues as to which there is an issue for
resolution and this kind of a proceeding is one, virtually the

26

only one at thl3 point in which we can see where there would
be a possibility of getting expeditious decision.

Now, the record in this case is devoid of facts
and the FPC has not taken any action to develop it.
at this point upon our unsupported allegations.

It rests

We think at

this point that the unsupported allegations we have made —
sworn allegations I might say — but it turns out that they
are nowhere nearly as strong as they should have been but we
want the opportunity to see about that.

When Gulf States

builds transmission to preempt the LEC plant, do we offer
LEC, not for us?

Not for the pool?

We think the Commission

ha3 a responsibility to look into that under section 20*!.
Now, a good deal has been said about legislative
history.

The legislative history of section 204 is, in a

word, pretty minimal.

What happened was, the

PPC, in 1935,

introduced as Title II of the Public Utility Act, what is now
parts two and three of the Federal Power Act and it Is
necessary to look at the entire legislative history of the
Utility Act at once.
Most importantly, what happened was that the FPC
Introduced a bill which would have given it substantial
control over all interstate aspects of an electric utility
company's business.

It would have required it to become a

common carrier under the supervision of the Federal Power
Commission.

It would have required it to do quite a number

27
of things which were later changed and the most — the
easiest way of understanding what was done, I think, is to
examine the marked-up committee prints of the bills together
with the House and Senate reports.

The prints are available
they
at the Federal Power Commission library and/are very helpful
about things like that.

I would commend them to your

attention.
Importantly, however, ifhat happened is that the
committees determined to amend this statute which had
initially given the Power Commission even more responsibility
than it has under the Natural Gas Act in the power industry
to significantly abrogate the protections that had originally
been proposed that the Commission would offer, leaving other
things to common law; leaving some issues completely
unanswered but when they did so, they drastically changed
section 204.
Now, there is plenty of legislative history which
shows that the purpose of section 204 was to prevent stock
or bond issues for purposes inconsistent with the public
interest.
Q

Mr. McDiarmid, let me interrupt you a moment.

You indicated you were reserving twenty minutes for
Mr. Shapiro.

You are impinging into his time now.

MR. MC DIARMID:

I'm sorry, your Honor.

I thought

I had fourteen minutes — in which case I would be very olose.

28
If that Is the ease, I'll quit rapidly, sir.
The section 204, however, was changed and
strengthened drastically and It is quite obvious, I think,
that the court will have to address itself to the flow of the
legislation on the questions that have been raised.

I think

that would be easy enough to do when looked at.
The important question however, I think, has been
eluded by the Federal Power Commission.

It is, what if the

application for financing here had said what we think it
meant, that the company intended to use these funds for
Illegal purposes of any sort, illegal purposes to buy elections,
illegal purposes to build transmission for particular reasons
which are anticompetitive, Illegal purposes to subsidise
law suits, and I think that is really the question that has
to be answered, what if the application had said that on its
face,

rather than just the cities coming in and saying that

they were sure that that was what the purpose was.

I believe

that is what the case might have been.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Shapiro.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HOWARD E. SHAPIRO, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF AMICUS CURIAE
MR. SHAPIRO:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the court:
The United States appears as amicus curiae in this
case because of its belief that federal regulatory agencies

29
must consider the national policy in favor of competition
under the public interest standards of the statures they
administer.

The test for when they must do so has been

stated concisely by the court of appeals.

It is whether there

i3 a reasonable nexus between the anticompetitive objections
raised under the public interest standard and the agency*s
responsibility.
Before turning to the particulars of the relationship
between section 204 of the Power Act and competitive policy,
I'd like to make one general observation.

Our national

economic policy postulates a free economic market in which
there occurs industries for particular aspects of their
activities, limited direct government regulation.

Congress

therefore legislates against the background of the statutes
which protect that free economic market

and by free

economic market, I mean one which is free of private
restraint.
Nov/, there is no antithesis between competition on
the one hand and regulation on the other.

Competition seeks

to achieve the optimum allocation of the resources in the most
efficient way at the lowest cost.

The antitrust laws prevent

private restraints which would interfere with this process.
Direct regulatim does precisely the same thing.
precisely the same ends.

It seeks

Administrative regulation and

antitrust policy are therefore directed at the same

30

objective.

They are therefore complementary to each other.

Now, this i3 exemplified in this court's decisions.

For

example, in the El Paso Natural Gas case under the antitrust
laws, a merger approved by the Federal Power Commission was
set aside on the ground that it violated antitrust policy.
The

decree entered in that case nevertheless provided that

after the divestiture was ordered by the district court, the
Federal Power Commission would have to consider the transfer
of the assets involved

under the public interest standards of

the Natural Gas Act.
Similarly, in the Denver and Rio Grande case,
which is more pertinent here, this court considered directly
the relationship between the public interest standard of
section 20-A of the Interstate Commerce Act and anti­
competitive allegations.
Now, the Denver and Rio Grande case is of crucial
importance here because section 20-A of the Interstate Commerce
Act Is almost literally section 20k of the Power Act.
Congress simply took section 20-A, made certain modifications
in it that actually strengthened It and incorporated it into
the Power Act.
Section 204 and section 20-A give their respective
Commissions continuing oversight over securities issued by
the companies that are regulated.

The language of the

statute makes this absolutely clear.

The companies must go

31
to the Commission for authority to issue securities .

Those

securities must be for a lawful object and compatible with
the public interest.

That is the statutory language.

Both

agencies are given broad powers to condition the securities
issues, issue supplemental orders consequent to their issue
and to control both the securities issue and the use of the
proceeds.

All that is in the statute.
In Denver and Rio Grande, this court construed

section 20-A to require consideration of competitive factors
by the Commerce Commission when approving a securities issue.
Now, Denver and Rio Orande did not turn on the responsibility
of the Power Commission — of the Commerce Commission to
enforce section seven of the Clayton Act or on its
responsibility under section five of the Commerce Act to
approve and exempt acquisitions of control among carriers
from the antitrust laws.

In that case, the court will recall,

the government argued that the acquisition involved — which
was an acquisition by Greyhound of stock of the Railway

Express Agency — the entire competitive question under
section 20-A could be postponed to see what would happen
with respect to further acquisitions of the stock.
»

This court held that such a deferral was
inappropriate because the issuance of the securities was
part of an agreement for cooperation and coordination between
the companies Involved.

This agreement was alleged and

32

would have a direct and severe Impact on competing companies
and it was this program in biding a memorandum of under­
standing not to bear acquisition of the stock which
represented the competitive issue that was of such public
concern.

All this Is made clear in part four of the Denver

and Rio Grande Opinion.
Now, the court of appeals here adopted a pragmatic
test for determining when there is an obligation to consider
under the public interest standards.
Q

Mr. Shapiro?

ME. SHAPIBO:
Q

Yes, your Honor.

I hate to interrupt, but couldn’t you make the

same argument when the case is taken up on remand?
MR. SHAPIRO:
Q

When this case is taken up on remand.

Umn-hmn.

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, the holding of this case, your

Honor, was that the Power Commission has to consider, under
the public Interest standards of section 204 the competitive
allegations which have been raised by the cities.

The

Petitioners here object to that and say, no, the Power
Commission doesn't have to consider these matters under
section 20-A — under section 204, rather.
Q

Shouldn't it all still be argued out?

MR. SHAPIRO:

We don't believe so, not if this

court reverses the court of appeals decision under section 204

33
because that was all that was all that was before the court
of appeals.

No, I saidp if the court did not reverse, but

let it stand, couldn’t you still make all this argument?

has been objected to.

MR. SHAPIRO:

Commission which will terminate the anticompetitive conduct
that is alleged to relate to this.
Q

Yes, but the Federal Power Commission

considers the antitrust implications,feels that whatever
implications there are overridden by the public interest in
having securities issued and they issue the securities

Could you or could you not enjoin the issuance of the

securities over the approval — contrary to the approval of
the FPC if you were successful in proving that it was part of
an antitrust conspiracy?
MR. SHAPIRO:

If we were successful?

IF it were

established that this was part and parcel, an intimate and

35
essential part of It, then —
Q

I’ll put it this way, you wouldn’t think there

would be anything contrary to the statute, contrary to the
proper relationship between the two statutory schemes, to
allege in your complaint that issuance of the securities was
part and parcel of the antitrust scheme and should be
enjoined?
MR. SHAPIRO:

That is right, your Honor.

Vie trould

not consider such an allegation inappropriate in a proper
case.

Now, this has been made clear before.

Commission under section 204 had no power to exempt anything
from the antitrust laws.

It has it3 own responsibility to

The defendants say,

The security matter hasn’t been taken

to the PPG yet but it will be, or it is there and it isn't

There would still be room for a primary jurisdiction

final on the antitrust action, I take it?
MR. SHAPIRO:

There would be room for the argument

and, of course, this —
Q

And so my question Is, would you say that It

would be appropriate to stay the antitrust case pending the
completion of the PPC proceeding, even though whatever the
PPC said would not be a final action, anything conclusive in
the antitrust act.
MR. SHAPIRO:
Honor.

I would have to answer noj, your

As we understand the doctrine of primary- jurisdiction,

an antitrust case will be stayed pending a decision by a
regulatory agency

altogether or where there’s a clear and irreconcilable
conflict.

We concede that.

Of course, at least the antitrust action might

be absolutely made unnecessary by an agency action if you
let them act first.
MR. SHAPIRO:

And frequently this will happen as a

matter of Irresponsible administration.

You still think it wouldn't be appropriate

to stay the antitrust act?
MR. SHAPIRO:

No, your Honor, In most of the cases,

and of course, you have got me

in a hypothetical and that is

very difficult.
Q

Yes, but It is also very relevant to this

case.
MR. SHAPIRO:
Q

I agree.

The —

Then you are from the Antitrust Division?

MR. SHAPIRO:

Very much so, your Honor.

In most cases it is the underlying conduct, not

38
simply the issuance of the securities that the antitrust
division is concerned with, as in this case.
Q

Yes, but you are here on a securities case.

MR. SHAPIRO:
Q

Yes.

That is the only issue in this case, is

issuing securities.

Now, you can’t ~~ well, what is the

Antitrust Division's Interest then, in this case?
MR. SHAPIRO:

The Antitrust Division’s onterest is

actually promoting the examination of these competitive
questions by the agency In part in the hope that we may have
the agency eliminate for us the competitive Issue so that
there won't have to be an antitrust suit and this may happen.
This is why the arguments about —
Q

But you would still say it would be an abuse

of discretion for a district court to stay an antitrust
action pending agency action?
MR. SHAPIRO:

I would — given the fact that we are

ordinarily concerned with the underlying conduct, not the
securities Issue as such, I would say yes.
Q

But you are concerned vfith a securities issue

here.
MR. SHAPIRO:
Q

But the reason —

That is the only thing that brought you into

this case.
MR. SHAPIRO:

But the securities issue is the —

39
according to their allegation, the cities' allegations — the
securities issue is what opens up the competitive problem for
the PPC.
Q

I agree with you, Mr. Shapiro.

I agree with

you one hundred percent.
MR. SHAPIRO:
Q

And —

Hence I asked my question.

1®. SHAPIRO:

Yes.

The anticompetitive conduct,

however, is more than the securities.
Well,

very briefly summarizing, then, the court of

appeals has used what I call the "reasonable nexus test."

It

examines the allegations against the agency's responsibilities.
It applied this test both to the PPC and to the Securities
Exchange Commission which operates under a different statute
and it concluded that the PPC had a definite responsibility
here because it was responsible for the operations of the
power company.
It concluded that the SEC on these allegations
did not have a similar responsibility.

Its decision was very
It pointed out that

to the extent that the allegations might raise questions of

.. .

Interlocking control or structural affiliation, operational
affiliation among companies of the kind that the SEC is
responsible for, that question would be reserved for
another day and considered.

40

All the court of appeals really decided here was
that the FPC had an obligation under the

securities

issuance provisions of the Power Act, to consider these
anticompetitive allegations and to make for itself a
determination

as to whether or not it should — there was a

sufficient nexus for it to go forward.with a fullscale
investigation.
Q

Are the licencees under the Atomic Energy

Commission Act?
MR. SHAPIRO:

Under section 105 of the Atomic

Energy Act, your Honor, the Atomic Energy Commission has a
statutory obligation to consider antitrust factors and must
refer the matter to the Antitrust Division.

Now, this is a

more specific example of Congresses —
Q

To your Antitrust Division?

MR. SHAPIRO:

Yes, your Honor.

This is a more

specific example of Congresses concern with the pervasive
application of the antitrust laws to these questions in the
power industry.

They made it explicit in the Antitrust Act.

They have used the broad term "publio interest" against the
background of antitrust law in the Power Act and the Public
Utility Holding Company Act is, as this court has said,
permeated with concern over competition.
Now, there have been some «—
Q

Mr. Shapiro, I hate to keep interrupting you

but in this case the question I asked you, could it ever be
involved in the securities?

Thi3 primary jurisdiction

questions could it ever be involved in a securities case in
the sense that the Federal Power Commission never orders the
issuance of the securities, does it?
MR. SHAPIRO:

That’s right.

It just approves it?
In fact, this Is

characteristic of most of the administrative process.

The

administrative process does not leave the initiative, by and
large, with the agencies.

It leaves it ivith the companies

and the regulatory agency simply exercises a veto power.
Notv, If the FPC approves the transaction,, the companies don’t
have to go through with it.

There Is no problem of direct

conflict between the command of the FPC and a possible
command of an antitrust law.
Q

Unless, I suppose, the FPC forbade it and the

antitrust court ordered it, which you could hardly Imagine
it ever would, as a matter of remedy.
MR. SHAPIRO:

In a securities Issuance context, It

is pretty remote.

Well, we have touched briefly on — I should touch
briefly on some of the practical problems, because this Is
one of the things the power Commission has been very
concerned about but as was brought out by Justice Blackmun’s
question, the power commission has stated it can live xvith
this decision.

It just doesn't like

The court of

42
appeals was very careful not to encroach on the power
commission's responsibilities here.

It left the entire

question up to it to explore in the first instance and it
also pointed out the broad discretion the agency has.
It can hold hearings.
subject to further investigation.

It can approve in part,,
It has, under the statute,

very broad powers to issue supplemental orders.

It may even

devise relief as the court of appeals suggested on the
basis of recurring applications to the agency and it
certainly need not hold the hearing in every instance.
How it proceeds is a matter for its sound
discretion and this will depend on the showing that is made
before it.
Now, there is another argument related to this.
The

utility companies have argued their subject to a

multiplicity of litigation or in a multiplicity of forms.
Well, if the competitive allegations have a
reasonable nexus to the agency's responsibilities, whether
it is the SEC or the ICC or the power commission, the
agency's consideration may make unnecessary or may simplify
proceedings in other forums.

If, for example, an appropriate

condition Is — the need for an appropriate condition is
established In this case, some of the anticompetitive problems
may be eliminated entirely and there may need be no need for
an antitrust suit

43
By making antitrust policy so pervasive, we think
the Congress intended that competitive considerations should
be considered in every forum to whose responsibilities they
are relevant.

To the extent that the FPC imposes conditions

under section 204, the commission is simply implementing its
public interest obligations.
Q

Mr. Shapiro, I guess I am a little bit out in

the wilderness, though, in respect to the practical effects
of this, suppose

conditions are Imposed?

Those conditions

really affect only this particular issue, do they not?

So

that the company is free to use other funds if it wants to
engage in these practices.
MR. SHAPIRO:

Yes, your Honor, that Is correct, but

the section 204 is broad enough in scope to permit the
issuance of supplemental orders and if the commission has
found that past financial

authorizations have been used to

advance the anticompetitive conduct which it finds with,
respect to a particular issuance, It could issue supplemental
orders directed at those proceeds.

The statute specifically

gives it power over the use of proceeds.

And then there would always be the Antitrust

Division.
MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, that really is our argument in

The regulatory agency forms a kind of a first

line of defense and at the very back of It all in reserve are

the antitrust courts.
Q
how

But aren’t you saying in effect, then, that

a utility company spends money on particular public

relations programs

litigation is a matter for day-to-day

regulation by the commission?
MR. SHAPIRO:

To some extent it is, your Honor.

For example, the SEC has a responsibility with respect to
political activities.

The Public Utility Holding Company

Act expressly forbids any utility subject to SEC’s
Jurisdiction to finance or to contribute to political
campaigns or political parties so there is a political
responsibility there.

The Power Act similarly gives very

sweeping powers in specific areas.

While it is not all-

pervasive in the sense of completely ousting the free market
function in the electric industry, there are specific areas
where the power commission has responsibility over rates,
preferences, discrimination, some powers over interconnection,
although these are not comprehensive and some powers over
even accounting.
Q

Somewhere in the court of appeals’ opinion,

I could not put my finger on it right now, there was some
discussion of the power of the commission to eliminate, avoid
hearings If they considered the objections frivolous or
insubstantial.

What are the parameters?

Do you think there

is an adequate definition of parameters of that power?

45
MR. SHAPIRO:

Within the limits of the Issue before

the court of appeals, yes.

This appears at page 22~a of the

Appendix for the Petitioner and there the court of appeals
explained that the commission need not hold a hearing if the
contentions by the intervenors were too insubstantial or
barren to indicate the existence of substantial anti­
competitive issues.

It expressly declined, however, in the

next paragraph, to determine noitf what is involved by the
requirement of reasonable nexus which it had developed
because it thought that that should be explored by the
commission in the first instance.

This was an example of

the court’s restraint in taking care not to encroach on the
commission’s responsibility.
Thank you, your Honors.
Q

Mr. Shapiro, in the event that this went

back to the Federal Power Commission under the mandate of the
court of appeals and that commission decided that under the
language of the court it would not hold a hearing because
it regarded it as insubstantial or peripheral, could that
order of the commission be then reviewed by these intervenors
in the court of appeals again?
MR. SHAPIRO:

Yes, your Honor and they would have

the advantage of having the commission address the issue
more directly than it did here since in this case the
commission apparently thought that it didn't have the

46
ability under section 204.

It has argued that it made a

factual determination but the court of appeals found that
there was no basis for that.

In fact, the commission

declined to make specific what the grounds of its decision
were when the cities applied for rehearing.
Thank you, your Honors.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BENNY HARRY HUGHES, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. HUGHES:

I would like to go back and clear up

one factual point that has been raised earlier about the
effect of the repayment of the short term notes in this
case.

The short term authority and proceeding is described

in a footnote in our petition to this court.

The essence of

the short term offer was that the utility company could have
at any one time outstanding an aggregate of not more than
$80 million.

Thus, when the $30 million bond proceeds were

used to repay these short term notes, the situation was then
not that the company had any new borrowing authority but it
would then be in a position to reissue more short term notes

47
under the limitations and subject to the already-existing
uncontested order of the commission for the purposes
expressed in it,
I would also like to comment on something that was
said just a few minutes ago and that is that, as I said
earlier, the net effect of the circuit court opinion In this
case was clearly to impose some responsibility on the FPC to
consider any competitive matters, even though in this ease,
which I would consider the easy case, the PPC had found
Irrelevancy to the short term proceeding.
Nevertheless, the court carried the strong duty
from Denver through and the PPC has in turn responded to it.
I’d like to discuss for a minute what duty the commission
might have.
As vie have urged earlier and in our brief, to
repeat, It is our position that 204 is a very narrow section
and that the PPC does not have a duty similar to the broad
duty In Denver.

But let me say that if that were not true,

as I said this morning, 204 still limits the responsibility
of the Federal Power Commission to the object of the
issuance.

I want to emphasize that ’’object."

Here, in this

case, the object is the repayment of authorized securities.
What if our application had instead been to issue bonds for
cash at competitive bidding so there was no competitive aspect
to that side of the transaction.

The use of the proceeds was

48
for the purpose of construction rather than the repayment of
short term bonds.
This commission has no certificating authority.

If

this court makes the Federal Power Commission responsible for
the effects and consequences of the fulfillment of that
object, to construct a transmission line, if the Federal
Power Commission is made responsible for the effects and
consequences, whether they are anticompetitive or whathaveyou
of the actual construction of that line, then the Congressional
denial of certificating authority would have been nullified.
If the denial of certificating authority to this
commission is to mean anything, it must mean that there is a
narrowing of the responsibility of the commission in the
expenditure of funds.
Now, if the commission does have some duty to
consider anticompetitive activities, then I would assert
that it only had a limited duty with regard to the immediate
object, the Denver case, the issuance of securities in and
of itself, the immediate object was a questionable object.
Here, the repayment of short term notes previously authorized
I don’t consider questionable.
I further submit that with the duty of the
commission so narrowed under its statute, it was not an
abuse of discretion for the Federal Power Commission, in a
pure financing transaction, to narrow the scope of 204 as it

did in Pacific Pov/er,
There has been a great deal made in brief and here
today about the similarity of section 20-A and 204.

One or

two sentences in 204-A are the same; a few sentences in the
next section.

Section 20-A is a long section.

It is quite

different and if we were to take notes of the similarities
I think we must also take note of the differences.

I’d like

to emphasize a few of them.
First of all, the Federal Power Commission’s power
over securities is not plenary nor exclusive.
words are used in section 20-A.

The ICC has a plenary

exclusive power under section 20-A.
204.

Those specific

That wasn’t adopted in

Further, the language of 204 does not adopt section

20-A language requiring notice nor investigation so we do
have, I believe, a clear case for a much narrower section in
this act.

I believe that it is undisputed in this case that

the primary duty of the Federal Power Commission is to assure
the public low-cost reliable service and maintain financial
integrity in the industry.

That is the primary responsibility

under 204.
The FPC has determined that to fulfill that
obligation is extremely important, that an expeditious,
efficient money market or market for securities be maintained.
It is not in the public Interest, they have determined, to
delay.

It will cost the public money.

50

Thus I submit to you that the FPC was well within
the bounds of its expertise and proper discretion in narrowing
the scope and if it is to be responsible, at least for the
immediate object, then it is certainly still not an abuse of
discretion to exclude speculative and consequential anti­
competitive matters.
I believe that this narrow approach to 204 which the
FPC in its discretion has adopted, is proper for many reasons
I have expressed and one more which I believe that this case
amply illustrates.

The cities have indicated in their brief

that what they wanted was wheeling.
subject discussed this morning.
adopt Mr. Handler's approach.

You have had that

I believe it is clear.

I

Our conclusion is the same.

The Federal Power Commission has no authority to order
wheeling.
They wanted wheeling and they have also in their
brief confessed that the principal reason for wanting to
U3e section 204 proceeding was simply to take advantage of
the time frame pressure of that proceeding, both on the
Federal Power Commission and on the utility company.

I

believe that this case illustrates the vulnerability of
section 204 and if the Federal Power Commission has a duty
to consider these anticompetitive matters, which I assert it
does not, if it did, to require it to consider them with
regard to matters beyond the immediate object, would

51
frustrate the intent of this section 204, go beyond its
language and go straight and override an expert determination
by this commission that an expeditious market is necessary.
Thank you.
Q

Mr. Hughes?

MR. HUGHES:

Before you sit down, you referred a

moment ago to the timeframe pressure —
MR. HUGHES:
Q

Yes, sir.

— in financing.

The court, as I recall, in

the opinion below made a passing reference —
MR. HUGHES:

Yes, sir.
*

Q

— to the same subject.

Would you elaborate

on that and try to draw the distinction between the timeframe
as presently existed under the FPC practice with respect to
financing and how you visualize that timeframe would be
affected if the order of the court below stands.
MR. HUGHES:

I’ll try, your Honor.

The utility

industry, because of the approach of the Federal Power
Commission to the marketing of securities, has been able in
the past to schedule the marketing of its securities with a
view to a particular offering date.

The Federal Power

Commission requires our company to — and I believe all
subject to its jurisdiction, to submit to competitive
bidding.

To facilitate that bidding, we try to get as close

as we can to the date where we want to hit the market to

52
get the best interest rate and then we start these administrative procedures.

A date for sale is scheduled.

As you

may or may not know, the principal market for these utilities
securities are institutional investors.

They schedule their

purchasing according to the time frame that is set up.
If this time frame were delayed or interrupted by
an extensive Federal Power Commission proceedings in pursuit
of anticompetitive rabbits, the bonds would not be able to
go to market in accordance with their schedule.

Whether they

would go to market six weeks later, six months later, a year
later, would be a function of the proceedings but whether or
not the same buyers would be there and what they \vould pay
is another question that the Federal Power Commission has
satisfied itself would subject the industry to additional
cost, risk of the market and an additional marketing cost
in that the marketing would not be as efficient.

The under­

writers would perhaps have to sell twice and their selling
costs would be substantially enlarged, all of which would go
to the public.
Q

What about the railroads under 20-A?

Do

they experience the same difficulties?
MR. HUGHES:

I do not know, sir, but it is my

Impression —
Q

I take it that they should, if what you said —

MR. HUGHES:

I'm not sure, your Honor, that there

53
has been a case since the Denver case where it is experienced.
I would point out, as we did in our brief that as best we can
determine, the securities marketing in the railroad business
right now is substantially different than that in the
utility business.
Q

You mean in volume?

MR. HUGHES:

In volume and in purpose.

As I

understand it, the bulk of that market right now is replacing
equipment.

The utility market is a ballooning market for

tremendous volumes.
Q

I suppose there is a difference in public

acceptance, too, is there not?
MR. HUGHES:

I believe the rates indicate that, sir.

Thank you, sir.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 1:^9 o’clock p.m.„ the case was
submitted.)
