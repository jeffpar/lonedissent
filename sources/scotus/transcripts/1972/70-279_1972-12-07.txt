PROCEEDING S
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

now in Wo. 70-279» United States against Florida East Coast
Railway.
Mr. Huntington, you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SAMUEL HUNTINGTON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. HUNTINGTON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case is here on direct appeal from a threejudge District Court sitting in the middle district of Florida.
The District Court enjoined the enforcement of Inter­
state Commerce Commission rules describing an incentive element
to be added to the daily rentals that one railroad pays to
another for the use of its boxcars.
The basic question presented is whether the Commission
should have afforded the appellee railroads an oral hearing
prior to promulgating the rule.
The incentive per diem rules here in issue were
promulgated under Sec. 1(14)(a) of the Interstate Commerce Act.
That section authorises the Commission, after hearing,
to establish reasonable rules with respect to car service,
including the compensation to be paid for the use of freight
cars.

4
Under a 1966 amendment to that section, the Commission
may, in fixing that compensation, prescribe an incentive
element to improve the use of existing cars and to encourage the
acquisition of new cars.
Freight car shortages have been a serious and recur­
ring problem throughout most of this century.
In recent years, the Commission, with the strong
encouragement and support of Congress, has been moving on a
number of fronts to combat this problem*,
Just last term, in the Allegheny-Ludlum case, this
Court upheld two

car service rules promulgated by the Commission

under Section 1(14)(a).
Those rules govern the return of unloaded freight
cars to their owners.
The instant rule-making proceeding was initiated by
the Commission in 1967 after an earlier proceeding had been
dismissed for want of sufficient evidence.
In initiating this proceeding, the Commission ordered
the railroad to participate in a nationwide study of freight
car shortages.
During an eleven-month period in 1968, over 32,000
reports were filed from freight stations througout the country
that were filed from about 2,600 freight stations throughout the
country.
Each report listed for a given day, at a given station.

5
one, the freight cars ordered by shippers for delivery on or
before that day; two, the number of cars available at that
station for placement to shippers; and three, the number of
cars actually delivered to shippers during that day*
Extensive field audits were conducted by Commission
personnel to assure that the reports were filed and filled
out correctly, and also to assure that they did not reflect
overordering of cars by shippers.
The collected data were put on magnetic tapes and
were available to the railroads.
In December, 1969, the Commission issued an interim
report containing an analysis of the data collected from the
study and proposing a rule establishing the scale of incentive
per diem charges for plain boxcars.
In appendices to the report, the Commission described
in detail the methodology employed by the study and set forth
a series of tables and graphs showing the results of the studies
-- the study for plain boxcars*
The study showed that there were deficiencies in
placements of freight cars with shippers throughout the year,
but that the deficiencies were most severe during the heavy
traffic months from September through February each year*
The study also revealed that at the same time that
deficiencies were reported by some freight stations, surpluses
of cars would be reported by other stations frequently on the

6

same railroad.
Analysing this data, the Commission concluded that
at least during the peak period from September through February
each year, the surpluses were not sufficient, so that the
railroads could be expected to eliminate the deficiencies
simply byusing their boxcars more efficiently.
The Commission thus concluded that the existing
supply of plain boxcars was inadequate.

It,thus, proposed the

Incentive per diem rules to be applicable during the six months
heavy traffic period of each yea?:.
'sn. ify'i

*

.

v -.. *

Now, the proposed incentive rules were designed by
the Commission to do two things.
First, they were designed to improve the utilisation
of existing cars, and, second, they wore designed to provide
funds to those railroads who earned more per diem income than
they paid out with which to purchase new freight cars to augment
the national supply.
Q

Would the purchasing railroads own the new freight

cars outright?
MR. HUNTINGTON:

Yes, they would.

The interim report noted that proposals were tentative
and invited the railroads to submit verified statements of fact
and briefs with respect to the proposals.
The Commission ordered that any party requesting
an oral hearing should set forth in detail its need for an oral.

7
hearing and the evidence it intended to adduce.
In response to the interim report, numerous railroads
filed verified statements and briefs, some supporting the
proposed rules and others opposing them.
Several railroads requested oral hearings, including
both appellees here*
Seaboard, in its statement to the Commission,primarily
argued that the Commission should not impose incentive charges
on plain boxcars without also imposing them on specially
equipped cars.
Q

What weight, if any, should be given here and now to

the fact determinations of the District Court? Or at least a
mired fact and law determination that — relating to prejudice?
MR* HUNTINGTON:

Well, in our view, it is not so

much a question of fact as it is a question of the proper
standard to be applied in determining prejudice.
Our primary argument on that point, which I will
come to in due course, is that the District Court simply
applied the wrong standard*
Well, Florida East Coast did file two verified
statements setting forth its position under the rules in some
detail, and it also requested an oral hearing, and it specified
four factors which it intended to show at the oral hearing,
and I will also discuss those*
In 1970, in April 1970, the Commission entered its

8
final report and adopted the rules virtually la the same form
as had been proposed in the interim report.
The Commission specifically answered and rejected the
policy argument advanced by Seaboard and Florida East Coast
for not applying the rules to them, and it also rejected all
the requests for oral hearing on the grounds that no party
had showed prejudice.
Both Seaboard and Florida East Coast then brought
actions in the Florida District Court, and the District Court
set aside the Commission's order for failure to hold oral
hearings.
Mow, appellees base their claim to an oral hearing,
in addition to on the provision of Section 1(14(a), they place
their claim on Section 5(56)(d) of the Administrative Procedure
Act.
That section provides that in rule-making, quote,
"an agency may, when a party will not be prejudiced thereby,
adopt procedures for the submission for all of part of the
evidence in written form.11
Appellees claim that they showed prejudice in their
submission to the Commission.
Before reaching this issue, though, there is a
threshold issue of whether Section 5(56)(d) applies at all to
this rule-making proceeding.
Mow, Section 5(53) of the Administrative Procedure Act,

9
sets forth the basic procedural requirements for rule-making »
And Section 5(53)(c) requires agencies to give
interested parties, quote, "an opportunity to submit written
data, views or arguments, with or without opportunity for
oral presentation» "
Clearly, this was done in this case by the Commission.
Section 5(53(c), however, goes on to state that,
quote, "when rules are required by statute to be made on the
record, after an opportunity for agency hearing, Sections
5(56) and 5(57) apply, instead of this subsection»"
How, Section 1(14)(a) of the Interstate Commerce Act,
under which the incentive rules here were promulgated, requires
a hearing, but it nowhere states that the Commission's decision
must be on the record of that hearing»
How, unless the on-the-record requirement can be
inferred from the context of the statute, Sections 5(56) and
5(57) of the Administrative Procedure, would not apply to this
case.
How, this precise issue was decided by this Court in
the Allegheny-Ludlum case last year.
In the applicable passage, this Court stated, 7%te do
not suggest that only the precise words on the record in the
applicable statute will suffice to make Sections 5(56) and
5(57) applicable to rule-making proceedings.

But we do hold

that the language of fcheEsch Car Service Act, Section 1(14) (a),

10
is insufficient to invoke these sections,
Q

Could your opponents come back and argue that because

of the 1966 Amendment and its language,saying that the
additional determination should be made upon these considera­
tions, that that is an implied requirement?
Ml* HUNTINGTON:

Well, they do, and our response to

that is that the 1966 Amendment simply builds on what was there
before, and it does require the Commission to take into account
certain factors before imposing an incentive element*

But it

in no way suggests that in considering those factors, the
Commission must do so only on the basis of the record.
The hearing requirement, whether you are considering
a proceeding as in Allegheny-Ludlum, under the first part of
the statute, or whether you are considering incentive per diem
proceedings under the second part, the hearing requirement is
the same.

And that requirement is imposed in the very begin­

ning of the statute,
In short, we believe that the Allegheny-Ludlum
holding is controlling here.
But, I would like to turn now to the second part of
our argument which assumes that Section 5(56) does apply to this
proceeding.
In that event, the Commission was justified in
doing away and not holding oral hearings unless appellees had
established before the Commission that they would be prejudiced

11

by the absence of an oral hearing.
The critical question here then is what showing is
necessary to establish prejudice and did appellees make that
showing?
In our view, there are two basic tests that a
request for an oral hearing must meet to establish prejudice,
and, getting back to your question, Mr. Chief Justice, we
would maintain that the District Court did not apply these
tests.

Therefore, its finding of prejudice was based on an

erroneous standard and it not a finding of fact which this
Court should refer to.
The first, and most obvious, test is that the request
must show a need to establish facts at an oral hearing that
could not be adequately established through written submission.
Both appellees have failed to meet this initial test.
Florida East Coast’s basic opposition to the rule
stems from the fact that it is located on a peninsularand
terminates far more plain boxcar traffic than it originates.
And, because a lot of the traffic terminates in the southern
part of Florida, as the verified statements it submitted show,
the railroad must continue to pay per diem charges until it can
get the unloaded boxcars back to the northern part of its line
and onto a connecting railroad,
Florida East Coast argues that because it owns
sufficient plain boxcars to satisfy the limited needs of its

12
shippers for plain boxcars, and because it operates an
efficient operation and generally returns empty cars as fast
as it can, the incentive per diem rules would neither prompt
it to purchase new cars nor result in the faster return of
freight cars and therefore the rule shouldn't be applied to
them.
While these arguments show that the application of
the rule may not be in Florida East Coast's best interest, they
do not show that an oral hearing was necessary to establish
these facts.

In fact, these facts

I

have just outlined were

set forth in verified statements in some detail submitted by
Florida East Coast.
Aftd the Commission's final report shows that it con»
sidered the arguments advanced by Florida East Coast, these
policy arguments, and considered the verified statements, but
concluded that an

exemption from the incentive rules for

all terminating roads would not be in the public interest.
Mow, Seaboard’s basic opposition to the rules is
based on its ownership of a large number of specially equipped
boxcars to which the rules do not apply.
Although Seaboard did not submit any verified state­
ments, it has made no showing that it could rot have established
this fact.by written submissions, and that it has made no
showing that an. oral hearing was necessary here.
Mow, perhaps recognising that an oral hearing was not

13

necessary to establish the adverse effect of the rules on them,
both railroads argue that an oral hearing was necessary to
cross-examine Commission personnel on the preparation and
analysis of the freight car study.
Here, too, hoxjever, appellees could have challenged
the Commission’s conclusion from the study by written submissions
and arguments.
The appendices to the Commission’s interim report
set forth in plain terms the methodology of the study.
Ho one has suggested that this methodology was un»
sound.
I would like to quote from a verified statement
submitted by the Penn Central.

This is on page 151 of the

Appendix, where the Penn Central concedes the study data
appears to have been gathered by recognized methods of
sampling and statistical techniques.
Penn Central then goes on to quibble with the con­
clusions reached by the Commission.
I don't understand appellees to suggest that the
statistical methods used here were inappropriate.

What is

challenged are the Commission’s conclusions from the tables and
graphs that the incentive per diem rule should be adopted to
improve the utilisation and supply of freight cars.
They challenge the analyses that the Commission made
from the data and the Commission’s conclusion that there was

14
indeed a national shortage of freight cars, and that the rules
are reasonably adopted to combat that shortage.
Well, if appellees believe that the conclusions
are unsound, their remedy is not to cross-examine Commission
personnel who assisted the Commission in analysing these data
as part of the decision making process. Their remedy is to
analyse the data on their own*
As I stated before, the data were available to them
and, on the basis of their own analyses, to argue against the
Commission conclusions.
Or, for that matter, they could start with the
Commission tables and graphs in the interim report and argue
that the Commissiones conclusions based on that data were
inappropriate.
Q

What if they wanted to challenge the underlying

data itself?
MR. HUWTIHGTOM:

Well, they have not chosen to do

that other than to -- well, I will backtrack a little bit -«
Florida East Coast does challenge the way in which part of the
data was obtained, and that is when 1 said that the reports
submitted to the railroads requires each freight station to
list the number of cars ordered by shippers for placement on
or before the study date.
Florida East Coast maintains that it is unreasonable
to include in the orders orders which were received on the study

15

day for placement: 'chat day.
And, this, 1 think, can properly be construed as
an attack on the method of the study.
I think the Commission recognised that this, perhaps,
was a deficiency in the study.

In fact, they proposed a

further study in 1969, which was opposed by both railroads in
which they would have remedied that particular point and they
would have only listed as orders orders received by the
beginning of the study day for placement on or before the
study day, and would not have included orders received on the
study day for replacement that day.
But, to the extent that Florida East Coast wants to
establish that, that's conceded that there is a deficiency
there.
Well, the second basic test that a party must show
as you will remember, I said there are two tests -- the
second basic test fcheymzsfc show to establish prejudice from, the
absence of an oral hearing, is to show that the facts it
desires to establish at an oral hearing are material and have
a reasonable chance of influencing the Commission in reaching
this decision.
And, with respect to their asserted need to cross»
examine Commission personnel, both appellees have completely
failed this test.
.Seaboard has failed to indicate in any way what facts

16

it would wish fco establish»
Florida East Coast, on its part, did list what it
hoped to establish»

One thing it hoped to establish was this

24 hour business about freight cars ordered for placement on
the study day»
The other facts -- and I put facts in quotation
marks — that it wished to establish were, one, that the
deficiencies reported in the study "may not" be affected by
the supply of cars in other regions; two, that the addition
of new plain boxcars "would not necessarily" reduce the
number of deficiencies; and, three, that no one could tell
exactly how many boxcars were needed.
I believe it is highly unlikely that the establish­
ment of these facts would have surprised or impressed the
Commission.
The Commission, throughout its report, does not
contend that they are operating on a perfect set of data here,
or that they can guarantee that the rules they are adopting
will, in fact, work.
What they are saying -■* what the Commission did say
is that we have this valid statistical evidence, that in our
best judgment this evidence shows that there is a shortage,
and in our best judgment the proper way to go about it is by
trying these incentive rules.
The Commission said that the rules were designed, and

17
I quote, to test whether a financial incentive can be employed
to augment the car fleet.
This is in the nature of an experiment.
The Commission at several points said that the
proceedings would remain open and that the rules could be
revised in view of the experience of the railroads after they
had been in effect.
Q
this?

Mr. Huntington, what are the practical aspects of
Suppose that the Court rules that the oral hearings are

required?

Do you have any estimate s.s to delay factors and

this kind of thing, that might ensue?
MR. HUNTINGTON:

Well, I think, had it ruled —

at this point, the rules are in effect against »- apply to
every railroad in the country, except Florida East Coast and
Seaboard, so a remand would just involve those two railroads.
So, I cannot say that the delay would be a matter of
tremendous significance to the entire country, but these
hearings do drag on, and if it gets into a battle of expert
witnesses over the proper interpretation to be given a set of
data, I believe there could be quite a substantial delay.
Q

You mean by that, years or months or —
MR. HUNTINGTON:

Q

I think probably years.

Rut you don’t anticipate, or do you, Ekany intervenors

and their participation, and this kind of thing?
MR. HUNTINGTON:

Well, I would like to backtrack on

18
what I said a minute ago.
I think we have stated in our jurisdictional state­
ment that if oral hearings are held, the other railroads would
be likely to seek to intervene* and that the whole proceeding
probably would be reopened, and it might be a very protracted
,roceeding indeed.
Q

Because it is rule-making, they wouldn’t be bound

b;’ their failure to themselves?
MR. HUNTINGTON:

I think that might be one factor.

Au>ther factor is the Commission’s statement that the proceeding
woild remain open.
In fact, I understand from the Commission that
there are petitions before the Commission right now seeking
to .«open the proceeding and seeking to modify the rules.
Q

Did I understand from your reference that only these

two loads would be involved, has the rest of the railroad
country accepted the Long Island decision?
MR. HUNTINGTON:

Yes.

The rules have been applied

since 1970 to the rest of the railroads in the country.
(}

In the Allegheny case, how many railroads were

actually appearing?

I have forgotten.

MR. HUNTINGTON:

How many were appearing?

Well, there were a group of railroads, the AAR, the
American Association of Railroards; there was the shipping
interest —

19
Q

Multiple parties?
MR. HUNTINGTON:

Yes, there were multiple parties

and numerous verified statements and the proceedings went on
for some time.
Q

And some of the railroads in Allegheny were satis­

fied with the proceedings of the ICC, were they not?
MR. HUNTINGTON:

Some of them were, yes.

There the issue was not procedural.

The issue was

the underlying reasonableness of the rule.
Well, finally, we suggest that if the Court agrees
with us that an oral hearing was not required here, the Court
should affirm the Commission's order outright without remanding
to the District Court for consideration of other issues.
Now the District Court, in deciding that an oral
hearing was necessary, did not reach several other issues
raised by appellees.
And these issues are, basically, whether the
Commission complied with all the requirements of 1(14)(a),
whether the rules are reasonable, and whether Florida East Coast
should be exempted as a terminating road.
Now, the reason we suggest that a remand is not
necessary is we believe that these issues are not substantial.
He believe that a reading of the Allegheny-hudlum opinion and
a reading of the Commission reports, and keeping in mind the
very limited scope of review which the Allegheny-Ludlum case

20
underscored, that the rules should be simply upheld in their
entirety by this Court»
And, then, finally, for the redsons set forth at
pages 28 to 30 of our brief, and I wonft go into them here,
we urge that appellees should be ordered to make restitution
of the incentive charges that they would have paid other
railroads but for the restraining order and injunction entered
by the District Court»
In conclusion, we respectfully submit that the
judgment below should be reversed.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Layne.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF A. ALVIS LAYNE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. LAYNE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I represent the Florida East Coast Railway Company.
With the consent of the Court, Mr. Hollander of the
Seaboard Coast Line Railroad and.I will divide fc:he time
available to the appellees, and we hope to avoid repetition
in our arguments.
I shall undertake to discuss whether the Commission1s
order is required to be made on the record of a hearing, that
is, whether the parties were entitled to an oral hearing,
under Sections 5(56) and 5(57) of the Administrative Procedure

Act.

21
I will also discuss whether the Florida East Coast
was prejudiced by the denial of its request for hearing and
oral argument, a request to cross^examine Commission agents
on their audits and studies, and the request to subpoena
Commission experts fco present testimony to contradict the
basic facts assumed and asserted in the Commission’s report
imposing incentive per diem charges on the railroad industry
and on the Florida East Coast.
Mow, Sections 5(56) and 5(57) of the Administrative
Procedure Act are applicable, we think, because the Commission
action in fixing compensation to be paid for the use of freight
cars is quasi-judicial action.
Like agency actions considered in Morgan, a rate
case, the Ohio Bell Telephone case and the division cases
which this Court has recently decided in north-south divisions,
the Commission order must be based on the record of a hearing,
The nature of the Commissions action in this case,
that is to say you must pay another railroad so much for the
use of its equipment, in freight car compensation proceedings,
distinguish this proceeding from the Commission’s order
prescribing operative rules, and that1s the rule that was
involved in Allegheny-Ludlum,
Q

Mr, Layne, is your claim based on something outside

of the Administrative Procedure Act, or is it based on the
Administrative Procedure Act alone?

22

MR* LAYNE:

On two, Mr* Justice Rehnquisfc.

1 would say that the Administrative Procedure Act
itself, as this Court noted in AlleghenyHLudluat.would say
that the scope and nature of the hearing required to discharge
the duty in this case, in this kind of instance, fixing
compensation, is within 5(56)and5(57)and the hearing to which
Section 3,(14) (a) refers must be a hearing on the record*
I would go farther, however, and say, as the Courts
have said in, for example, Palmer v„ United States* dealing
with compensation for freight cars, that the fixing of
compensation that one railroad must pay to another railroad
for the use of a car, which it must accept, to further the
through movement of freight, is a judicial action and that
you are entitled to due process in the fixing of that.
And, like this Court’s decision, for example in
Londoner v, Denver, 210 U.S., concerned with a taxation
problem, if that compensation is to be imposed, we are
entitled to due process*
So I would say that beyond the question simply of
the Administrative Procedure Act, yes, we are entitled **«*
Q

You have a Constitutional —
MR. LAYNE:

Oh, yes, I say that there is also,

beyond the Administrative Procedure Act, a due process issue.
Q

You had a good deal of process.

have enough.

You said you didn’t

23
MR. LATOS:

That's right.

But, of course, in Londoner v. Denver., 210 US, the
Supreme Court, this Court, said, no matter how brief, no matter
how informal, you cannot relegate someone simply to the filing
papers.

They must have an opportunity for oral argument and

they must have an opportunity for

an

oral hearing, orally to

present theft material.
Q

Let me over-simplify it.

And I think I am asking the

same question Justice Rehnquist did.
If we agree with the Solicitor-General that 5(56) and
5(57) do not apply, then it does not follow, in your view* that
you necessarily lose the case?
MR. LAWE:

No, because I think the next question

arises as to whether you can — the Commission can be invested
with the kind of power that it exercised in this case to take
the money, or as it has been somewhat popularly said in the
railroad industry, a kind of a reverse

Robin Hood effect.

You rob from the poor and give to the rich railroads so that
rich railroads can buy more cars and they can have the poor
railroads pay for them.
Q

While I have you interrupted, let me ask you the

same question I asked Mr. Huntington.
If we go along with your position here, what is the
practical effect in your view of prolonged hearings, delays,
and the like.

After all, this problem has been with us a long

24
time*

MR, LAYNE:

Certainly.

question of delay is minimal,

And I think that the

I think that the Interstate

Commerce Commission is empowered and has full authority,
both under the Administrative Procedure Act, its own rules of
practice, and its statute, to regulate the content and control
the time of and the extent of hearings,
I do not think that what I requested would have
delayed the Interstate Commerce Commission in its disposition
of this case.
Q

But, of course, if Florida East Coast can request

oral argument, presumably 200 other railroads can too and by
then you are talking about a rather significant delay,
MR. LAYKE:

If those railroads could show that the

failure to grant them a hearing prejudiced them, as the Florida
East Coast Railway showed to the Court below and, as X hope
to show

to this Court, then, I think, they would be entitled

to that hearing.
Q

You say that the delay factor there ought not to

prevail over their claims —
MR, LAYKE:

Certainly not.

And this Court's

repeatedly said it shouldn't.
Q

Would that kind of participation be limited to the

people who are involved in this case or all the affected
railroads ?

25
MR. LAYNE:

Well» I should think, when we started out

with this case, it would have been limited to people in this

ease.
But, to be frank with you, Mr. Chief Justice» the
Interstate Commerce Commission has had a petition pending
before it since July 17, 1972, by a number of railroads,
including among the® the largest creditor railroad*

The

largest one to receive incentive per die®, asking the
Commission to reopen this because of the failure of incentive
per die®.
How, I don’t know what they will do with that.
Q

Is there any chance that the problem would be solved

by the time the hearings were over?
!■©.. LAYNE;

There is no shortage, sir.

A committee of Congress in September 6, 1972, reported
that there was no such thing as a shortage.
There is a great deal of mythology, as well as
msthodology, about this.
I think, and a number of railroads have testified
since that time, that there is now no shortage of boxcars.
As a matter of fact, there is a surplus of boxcars.
Not because they were purchased.

Boxcars have continued to

decline.
Q

Does the ICC agree with you?
MR. LAYNE:

I don’t know whether they do or not.

They

26
haven*t taken any action on the materials that have been filed
with them*
As 1 said, they were filed in July , 1972, asking
them»because there was no shortage, to reopen the proceeding;,
to change the incentive per diem* to eliminate it, or at
least modify it, and no action has been taken,
1 can * t tell whether they agree or disagree,
Q

But, I take it, implicit in your position,that you

have just taken, is that absent the shortage, surely these
rules are invalid,
MSt. LAYWE:

Certainly.

But I thought that I would be able to prove before
the Commission some of the things that I held were essential
to their taking action in the first place, if they had given
me an opportunity to do so.

Let me talk for a moment.

Let me just conclude our argument on this question
of what we are entitled to by way of a hearing, and say that
we think the statute itself sets up standards and requires
findings, and that statute prohibits, for example, the
Interstate Commerce Commission from making an incentive per
dim applicable to any type of car the supply of which is
adequate.
Wow, surely, it was open to me to demonstrate that
under any measure of adequacy that there ms an adequate
supply of the plain boxcars to which the Coasaission referred and

27
to which it made incentive per diem applicable.
And that's what I attempted to do*
Now, we say that the statute requiring these con­
siderations clearly indicates that the Commission must make
findings and that those findings are quasi-judicial in their
scope and character.
We also say that this is supported not only by the
statute but,by the legislative history of this section of the
statute,

it is supported by the Commission's own determinations.,
This proceeding was not started without reference to

5(36) and 5(57).

The Commission said that it was complying

with Sections 5(56) and 5(57) when it initiated the proceedings*
It initiated them under those sections and it
purported to decide them in compliance with those sections of
the Administrative Procedure Act,
It is only for the first time in this Court that it
is claimed that 5(56) and 5(57) and the hearing requirements
of those sections do not apply to this proceeding.
Now, let me turn for just a second to this question
of what I attempted to do by way of evidence.
I attempted to subpoena Commission personnel
familiar with and expert in freight car supply,allocation and
movement, people whoa the Commission had themselves testified
in prior proceedings,, the testimony of persons that had been
offered as witnesses in prior proceedings on these very points.

28
And X offered

and

X

wanted to prove with that

testimony that the standard of adequacy that was applied by
the Commission in this case was improper, was not right, that
it was an unreasonable one, and I wanted to do it with expert
testimony,
I couldn't do it with my own expert because every
expert that testified that it was a railroad was referred to
by the Commission as,’'that is an opinion of a railroad official,58
You will see it in their report.
I wanted to present the testimony of a nonrailroad
official with nationwide experience with respect to this
matter,
Q

Not Florida East Coast.
You mean you wanted to find out from him what his

interpretation of the word "adequate” was?
MR, LAYNE:

No.

I wanted to ask him what an

adequate supply would be and whether a railroad could respond
to a request for a — whether in hia expert judgment, a
supply could be termed adequate, whether you could measure the
adequacy of a supply by saying you must report that car, you
must place that car on the day it is ordered, which is the
standard that the Commission applied in this case,
I also wanted to have that person testify, those
people testify, that if you apply a standard, that you should
furnish the car on demand on the day it was requested, that
such a supply of plain boxcars would be so great — mind you,

29
this is at ail stations, all locations, throughout the United
States, this kind of a standard would apply»
The supply would be so great that you would have so
many boxcars, you would have so many cars that the traffic
wouldn't move on the railroad» You couldn't get an engine on
a railroad.
Q

Isn't the problem largely one of having the right

kind of cars at the right place when they are needed, not
necessarily what the total picture is?
MR.

LAYME:

of

course, obviously.

And this is what

I was trying to prove, and what 1 was trying to reach and get
at in proving.
How, the next thing — X expected, threfore, to
present expert testimony.
Q

It was not available to me.

Hhy couldn't you use your own experts?
MR.

LAYHE:

Because I had no such expert with nation­

wide experience.
And the expert outside the railroad industry that
would know about this was precisely the same people that the
Commission had had testify on these same points in prior
proceedings, and I had every reason to know how they would
testify because I had copies of their testimony, or at least
X had indications of their testimony.
How, they had presented their own experts on this
same point, as long ago as 1947, to give these very self-same

30
kinds of opinion evidence to support their action»
I didn’t have any wide tern of that.
My 15 minutes has expired.
Thank, you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Thank you* Mr. Layne.
Mr. Hollander.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD A. HOLLANDER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF TEE APPELLEES
MR. HOLLANDER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The Seaboard Coast Line raised three questions
before the Jacksonville Court.
We said, first, that there was a lack of a proper
hearing, and Mr. Layne has covered that subject.
I simply want to say that

I

agree with points which

he raised.
We also charged, in the Court below, that the ICC
had failed to comply with the requirements of 1(14)(a), and
then we said that the Commission's conclusions lack sufficient
evidentiary support.
The Court below found for us, as you know, on the
hearing issue, and for that reason said that it would not,
and in fact it did not discuss the other contentions.
In its reply brief, the Government has said that these
other issues are not substantial, and, of course, we disagree

31
with that.
Mr. Huntington, in hie argument today treated lightly,
if at all, with the other issues»

He should not, 1 submit,

because he is asking you to overturn the lower Court* s decision
and to reinstate the decision of the ICC.
How, Section 1(14)(a), as certainly you know by now,
is three sentences in length»
dealt

The first one, the one you

with in Allegheny-Ludlum, is from the 1917 Esch Gar

Service Act.
We are talking about the other two sentences that
were the result of Public Law 89“430.

And those sentences

tell the ConEBission what factors they must consider in
determining the payment of compensation.
Q

Was the 2nd Circuit case

was Judge Friendly —

was that a three-judge court, too?
MR. HOLLANDER:
Q

Yes, it was. Your Honor»

Was Judge Friendlyvs opinion in conflict with the

Florida court?
MR. HOLLANDER:

It was not, Your Honor.

The only —
Q

Well, was it in conflict only on the record question?
MR. HOLLANDER:

It was not, Your Honor, because of

this reason.
X was going to join Long Island in that proceeding ,
had my papers all ready when the attorney for the Long Island

32
called me and told me that he had stipulated with the Govern­
ment to a single very limited issue, that is, whether in the
Long Island circumstances they were entitled to a hearing*
And I was not willing to go to the District Court
before Judge Friendly —
Q

Bid Judge Friendly decide the on-the-record question

or not?
MR* HOLLANDER:

He decided very definitely that

5(56) and 5(57) govern*
Q

But you don1t think that was in conflict with

Allegheny-Ludlum because it deals with different sections of
the Act?
MR. HOLLANDER:

For the reasons stated by Mr* Layne*

that’s correct, yes.
I am, of course, now talking about these other
points, and I say that the Court below had it reached those
points, which it did not, would have found in our favor.
I am pretty confident about that because I use as
a starting point the Commission’s own 1967 incentive per diem
decision, the one that Mr. Huntington mentioned to you a few
moments ago.

The decision which led up to the one which is

involved here.
That 1967 decision,itself, demonstrates in the
Commission’s own words that what it did here was arbitrary and
was not rationally supported, and, of course, Section 706 of

33

the Administrative Procedure Act, says that a reviewing Court
ought to hold such a decision unlawful.
The 1967 decision,which is in 332 ICC, listed a
number of specific factors which the Commission felt it had
to consider in deciding upon incentive per diem compensation,
and which weren't considered here. And it . concluded in that
proceeding, after extensive hearings, and, incidentally,
including oral hearings in which ICC personnel were examined,
that Incentive per diem would not improve operating practices,
nor would it lead to more efficient U3e of cars, nor would the
building of more cars be generated.
That's what the Commission said.
Without considering those factors which it said in
1967 it had to look into and which I submit 1(14)(a) says it
must look into, it decided here, in the case now before Your
Honors, that it wouldn't examine into those factors, and it
did a complete about face and prescribed incentive per diem.
How, insofar as car ownership is concerned, ray
railroad, my company, is a creditor road.

It bought and built

boxcars as the ICC directed to meet the needs of shippers on
its lines.
Particularly prejudicial to us, then, was the
Commission's decision that sometime In its entire consideration
of the proceeding, and without in any way warning us la the
convening notices that it would confine incentive per diem to

34

plain boxcars* fco standard boxcars.
This was done after concluding in the 1967 decision
that for much transportation the standard boxcar has been
replaced, that equipped boxcars frequently are used for the
same purpose as standard boxcars, and, after telling us in
such decisions as the one you reviewed in Allegheny-l.udlum
that any failure on our part to acquire cars to meet the needs
of shippers on our lines would be unconscionable, fco use their
word .

'
Again, we did tailor our car fleet, but in equipping

boxcars, they no longer could be designated plain boxcars,
and they don't, therefore, qualify for incentive* So in the
netting out of incentive per diem, we will be called upon to
pay over to other railroads, one of them our major competitor,
large amounts of money, and, of course, our overall freight
car program, which we think has been pretty good, is going to
suffer.
Q

You had 90 days, didn't you, after receiving the

interim report, in which to make objection on the grounds of
the inadequacy of the originating notice, if you wanted to.
MR. HOLLANDER:
all, it was 60 days.

Let me say several things.

First of

We did respond.. We did object on grounds

which I have just been

stating, and, furthermore, I would like

to submit the proposition to this Court that what I received in
the interim decision was a fixed anticipatory judgment and I

35
don’t think it was ever meant to yield to any facts that we
might submit later on.
He started studies in order to try to dispute some
of the things that the Commission had raised.

We asked for

more time to do it and the Commission wouldn’t give it to us.
Within two months time, it had come out with its
final report, which was the same in all practical respects
as its interim report.
Wow, Section 1(14)(a), tells the Commission again
that it must consider all factors affecting the national
freight car supply.

It didn’t do that; as again I said in

its 1967 decision, it told us it had to.
And if the Court below had gotten to that question,
which it did not, I am confident that it would have sustained
our position.
Now, you heard Mr. Huntington a few moments back say
that what the Commission did was an experiment.
his word, that's the Commission’s word.

That's not

They said what it

was doing here was an experiment.
In experimenting, it is going to take millions of
our dollars, not as a penalty for doing something wrong, but
simply to give to other carriers for seasons over which we have
no control.
And I submit to Your Honors that there is no law
that permits the ICC to do that, particularly in the absence of

36
due process.
Q

Mr. Hollanders as a matter at least of theoretical

operatioris you are not required to use any other carrier’s
freight cars, and you are not required, are you, to lend your
freight cars to anyone else?
MR. HOLLANDER:

Let me say. Your Honor, that we are

required to use other railroads1 boxcars.
You see, we originate freight on our line.

We use

the cars which we have bought to meet the needs of our shippers.
They go out and they head west, for example, and when we turn
those cars over to our connecting lines, going west, they
must take those cars.
Similarly, on cars coming east, south, onto our
line, we must take them.
We may not have any need for them, but we must take
them with the load.

We must deliver the load, but immediately

upon the taking of those cars, at our junction, we are at
once charged with incentive per diem, which, as you know, is
something over and above the regular .'..per diem.

This is a

penaltygainst us for no wrong which we have done, except to
follow the Interstate Commerce Commission’s directive to
acquire cars to meet the needs of the shippers on our line.
How, of course, what the Commission is asking us
to do now is don’t do that.
equipped boxcars.

Forget the idea of buying

Apply your revenues to the purchase of plain

37
boxcars which somebody else needs.
Let me take a moment to say, too, in arguing that
there is no support for the Commission’s conclusion, or
little support.

There is no support at all, not one bit,

in the record, that the use and movement of cars would improve
as a result of incentive per diem.
And the Commission never even bothered to look into
the question of how the weak debtor railroads were going to
be able to afford the additional investment for cars which the
ICC concluded in its decision would be acquired by them because
of this incentive per diem rule.
Now, Mr, Huntington, in ansi ering your question,
Mr. Justice Blackmon, spoke of 2% years of experience now
before the Commission in this Incentive per diem experiment,
and he mentioned,and so did Mr. Layne, there are pending
petitions before the Commission.
The first one was filed in July.
heard from the ICC.

Not a word has been

There have been a great many filed since

then.
Over 20 railroad, including the Penn Central, in
fact, have asked the ICC to abandon this incentive per diem
concept because of the fact that it simply isn’t working.
In fact, the Government itself — I have in front of
me the Government petition, the petition of the Department of
Agriculture, which says that the national fleet of boxcars is

38
still shrinking 5 and it says that the Commission ought to
reopen this proceeding to see if, in fact, there is a plain
boxcar shortage*
Q

Mr* Hollander, lead me on a little further.

Both

you and Mr* Layne have spoken of this petition to reopen having
been pending since July*

Now, thatrs four and a half months

ago —
MR, HOLLANDER:

There have been a series since

July up until September.
Q

Well, is that a long period in ICC experience?

Or is it a very short one?
MR. HOLLANDER:

Take me on.
If there is a critical shortage of

boxcars, I would say they should have acted immediately upon
some suspicion that this experiment is not working.
It is more than two or three months, Your Honor.
It is two or three years now.
we have

They have the same figures that

that show that there has been a constant decrease in

the number of plain boxcars in the railroad's fleet, a constant
decrease after incentive per diem went into effect,
There are 45,000 less plain boxcars in the fleet
today than there were when incentive per diem went into effect*
And this has been a steady decline.

This was known to the

Commission in the first year after it put this experiment into
order, into work.

And, the Commission itself, in its order,

said that it was going to take a look and if it didn’t work then

39
it would reopen it and take another look at it.
And it has been 2\ years and the Commission simply
has not done that.
My time is almost up and 1 want to point out to
this Court what it has said in a number of eases, most
recently, to my knowledge, in the B&Q case in 393 US, which
involved the division of revenues, that it is not going to be
led off by a base of so-called expertise, to use your word.
And you were not, you said, going to bridge the gap
by blind reliance on expertise.

And that is precisely what

you are being asked to do here.
And it will not do for the Commission to come to you,
as it .has done in its jurisdictional statement, and tell you
that it was moved to a decision by an impatient Congress,
a Congress which told the Commission that it had enough facts
in its record to go ahead and make a decision.
I submit that the Commission must, in fact, have
that necessary information, and it did not here»
Thank you very much for your attention.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr» Huntington, you have

about three minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SAMUEL HUNTINGTON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. HUNTINGTON:

I would first like to correct one

statement I made in response to a question by Mr. Justice

40
Rehnquisto
The Commission does not concede that the method of
reporting orders on its study was deficient.
And this point is addressed in a response to an
inquiry by the railroads while the freight car — while the
study was being done.
And that response is found at pages 189 to 190 of
the Appendix, and I will simply refer the Court to that.
On the existence of the shortage and on most of
Mr. Holander's points about whether the Commission did, in
fact, comply with the standards of Section 1(14)(a), I refer
the Court to the interim report and» specifically, to pages
66a to 70a of the jurisdictional statement appendix.

Thatrs

the critical part of the interim report, and it is in
Appendix A, and there the Court analyses in considerable detail
and shows exactly the steps it goes through in concluding that
there is a shortage and that the rule should be adopted to
combat that shortage.
To the extent, of course, that there is further
evidence that now maybe the shortage isn't as bad, or maybe
it is worse, of course, that can be submitted to the Commission
now.
I would also like to point out that the ~~ in
addition to these petitions which are now pending, the American
Association of Railroads did petition for modification of the

41
rule some time ago, asking that the funds collected from the
incentive per diem charges be available for leasing cars in
addition to purchasing new cars*

And the Commission now has

that and will probably come out with a decision in the not too
distent future.
Finally, in response to a point Mr, Justice White
made, the A1legheny ■-Ludlum case, and this case involved
■11*

precisely the same section of the Interstate Commerce Act,
and the same hearing requirement, it is the third and fourth
word in the Section 1(14)(a), and, therefore, we say that the
requirement should not be different in one proceeding than it
is in this proceeding.
Thank you,
ME* CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case Is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 2:45 o’clock, p,m,, the oral arguments
in the above-entitled case were concluded.)
