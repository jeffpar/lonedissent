PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No. 71-6516, Braden against Kentucky.
Mr. Hood, you may proceed whenever you are ready
now.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID R. HOOD, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. HOOD:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the court:
This case presents the question of whether or not
a petition for a writ of habeas corpus may be brought in a
judicial district other than that in which the petitioner is
presently confined.
The facts of the case are as follows.

Petitioner

Braden is incarcerated in the State of Alabama pursuant to an
Alabama State prison sentence which he does not here contest.
What he complains about is the right of the State of
Kentucky to continue to exercise control over him by virtue
of a detainer which It has lodged with the State of Alabama
pursuant to a 1967 Kentucky indictment.

Petitioner, in an

Alabama prison, is complaining here of a Kentucky detainer
filed in Alabama.
The Petitioner went Into the United States District
Court for the District of Kentucky and the district court
finding, one, that it had jurisdiction and, two, finding that

4
the Petitioner’s rights for a speedy trial had been violated
under the teaching of Smith against Hooey, granted relief.
The State of Kentucky then appealed to the Sixth
Circuit Court of Appeals, alleging, as it has alleged in the
district courts, that the District Court of Kentucky was
without Jurisdiction to entertain the petition for writ of
habeas corpus.

The Sixth Circuit appointed counsel and when

it heard the case it decided, based upon a decision of its
own some few weeks earlier, White against Tennessee and
based upon its understanding of Ahrens against Clark decided
by this court in 1948 that, indeed, in its view, the Kentucky
court was without jurisdiction.
Petitioner here contends that the Sixth Circuit was
in error both in regard to the decision in this case and in
regard to its previous decision in White against Tennessee
and at the same time contends that Ahrens

against Clark

should not be extended to petitioners — that is, if it is to
have remaining vitality and efficacy at all — it should not
be extended to petitioners who are seeking relief other than
immediate release from their present confinement.
When Ahrens against Clark was decided in 1948, the
reach of federal habeas corpus, the panoply of remedies that
were available, the kinds and quality of circumstances that
could be redressed were not as full a3 they have come to

be

enunciated and articulated and developed by this court since

5
1948.
Two classic examples are, of course, presented by
Peyton against Rowe, a case in which this court held that a
habeas petitioner could complain about a future restraint,
a restraint imposed by a prison sentence he had not yet
begun to serve and, secondly, a second example is the example
most pertinent to the facts of thi3 case, the teaching of
Smith against Hooey, that a habeas petitioner may complain
against a foreign state which

seeks to lodge a detainer

against him on account of its desire to bring him to trial.
Now, those kinds of circumstances necessarily
contemplate that the respondent against whom the petitioner
has his essential grievance will be in a different
territorial district than that which embraces the petitioner
pursuant to a state prison sentence which he is presently
serving and, again, on the facts of this case, about which he
may not complain*
Petitioner urgers that within the respective
jurisdiction language of 28 U.S.C. 2241, the statute which
was construed’and interpreted in Ahrens against Clark, does
not speak to nor define jurisdiction in what Mr. Justice
Rutledge, dissenting in that case, called "the jurisdiction
in the fundamental sense."

And, indeed, other cases of this

court teach that whatever the language means it does not
speak to jurisdiction in the fundamental sense and there are

6
several cases which illustrate that.
First of all, Ex Farte Endo, which was decided by
the court prior to Ahrens against Clark, dealing with the
same statutory language and a case which was reaffirmed in
Jones against Cunningham, stands for the proposition that a
petitioner who — represents circumstances in which a
sic)

petitioner may secretly, even though not within the district
the Hirota case also authored by the author of Ahrens
against Clark again stands for and teaches us that the
statutory language is not an invariable restriction on a
habea.s petitioner who seeks to petition other than in the
district in which he is presently confined.
Now,

Petitioner has reviewed and wishes not here

to rereview the legislative history of the 1867 habeas
corpus statute, the statute in which the language within
their respective jurisdictions was first introduced and
language which has continued on down through the history of
the habeas statute since 1867.
We have urged in our brief that the legislative
history — and I heard in a previous argument legislative
history in another context characterized as brief.
imagine briefer legislative history.

I can't

But the brief

legislative history of the 1867 statute is at least as
consistent with a construction that it was the territorial
presence of the respondent rather than the Petitioner which

7
the legislature had in mind in 1867.
In short, what the Petitioner contends is that
there are circumstances, given the reach of decisions since
the decision of Ahrens against Clark, in which a continuing
rigid application of the jurisdictional tests of Ahrens
against Clark would be inimicable to and be an, in effect,
restraint upon a curb upon the full reach of decisions of
this court, Peyton against Rowe, Smith against Hooey, and
other cases which contemplate that what we have called in
our brief, which contemplates the real respondent interest,
the real party against whom the petitioner grieves, will be
outside the state,
Now, there may be circumstances in which, on
account of the petitioner being in one jurisdiction and the
ultimate source of the custody about which he complains being
In another territorial jurisdiction, there

may be circum­

stances In which the petitioner is presented with a forum
choice and, again, I think that the facts of this case are
illustrative of perhaps just such a case.
We are here, of course, to defend the forum choice
:v of the Petitioner, that is, his Kentucky forum choice but at
the same time giving the lodging of the detainer in the State
of Alabama, we are, I think, and we acknowledge, necessarily
contending that he could have as well filed his petition with
the Alabama District Court.

8
Q

They issued a container in Kentucky?

MR. HOOD:

The container was issued out of

Kentucky and has been lodged with the Alabama —
Q

But the issuor is in Kentucky?

MR. HOOD:
Q

That is exactly right.

And you would like the detainer cancelled

unless they triumph?
MR. HOOD:

Well, vihat — the

essential relief we

seek, your Honor, doesn't run to the detainer as much as it
does to the indictment.

The genius of the Petitioner here

is that he has gone to the source of his difficulty.

Unlike

Nelson against George, he complains his essential grievance
is not about the consequences of his detainer.
Q

But if habeas corpus has got something to do

with custody, there the only custody you can talk about with
respect to anybody in Kentucky is the kind of custody that a
detainer imposes on him.
MR, HOOD:

Yes, and that is, I think, especially

pertinent to the possibility of filing in Alabama but,
certainly, here the custody, as I say, the custody issue is
out of Kentucky.
Q

But that habeas corpus does have something to

do with custody?
I®. HOOD:
Q

Indeed it does and it has —

So what kind of custody are you trying to

9
to be free from as a result of this
MR. HOOD:

habeas corpus action?

Trying to be free from the kind of

custody that is implicit in the issuance of a Kentucky
indictment, the kind of freedom — the kind of restraint on
freedom that was discussed by this court in Smith against
Hooey, the kind of alteration in the present circumstances
of his Alabama tenure in prison which are implicit not only
in a detainer but implicit even absent a detainer in the
issuance of an indictment by a Kentucky *— by —
Q

So you would still be here if there was no

detainer issued at all?
MR. HOOD:

Indeed I would.

I would be here to

defend the right of this Petitioner would go to Kentucky
and to their complaint of the issuance of —
Q

And you would be here on a habeas corpus

action?
MR. HOOD:
Q

Yes, sir.

Rather than the 1983?

MR. HOOD:

I would be here prepared to defend

Kentucky even absent a detainer as an appropriate forum for
the filing of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.
Q

And habeas corpus is a proper vehicle?

I®. HOOD:

I think that it is and I think that is

what Smith against Hooey

teaches and I think that the

custody does mean something and I think that the kind of

10
custodial presence that is contemplated by the statute that
was contemplated and discussed by this court in Strait
against Laird is certainly present in the State

of Kentucky

There is custodial presence in California in the Strait
against Laird.

Surely there is custodial presence in

Kentucky on the facts of this case as given the issuance
of an indictment.
Q

There are two things, assuming, one, the

detainer is lifted and he is out of jail in Alabama, would
you still have a right of action?
MR. HOOD:

I think I would have a right of action

and, pursuant to question, Mr. Justice White, I think that
the appropriate form of the action would be to go into —
Q

Well, what would be your action?

MR. HOOD:

We11, in Klopfer against North Carolina

we had someone —
Q

I’m talking about this case.

MR. HOOD:

I am talking about this case as well,

your Honor, because —
Q

What would it be?

You’d ask for habeas

corpus?
MR. HOOD:

I would ask — I would ask for habeas

corpus *
Q

And how is he detained?

MR. HOOD:

Well, he is detained in the same — he

11
has the same kinds of restraints on his freedom and suffers
certain disabilities not suffered by the public generally.
Q

Then am I correct that you take the position

that any time an indictment is issued, a man is entitled to
habeas corpus?
MR. HOOD:

Well, I think that the teaching of this

court is that an outstanding untried indictment represents
a sufficient restraint on one’s liberty to be tested by
habeas corpus, yes.
Q

You do?

MR. HOOD:
Q

That is my position and I think —

You realize — do you agree you don’t have

to go that far?
MR. HOOD:

I realize that on the facts of this

case that I don’t have to go this far, but I seek, your
Honor, to be responsive to your question and that is my
answer.
Q

Supposing that you had brought this action

in Alabama challenging the Kentucky detainer and the State
of Kentucky didn't appear in Alabama and you simply had an
adjudication between the Alabama custodian and your client
and the court ruled in your favor, the Alabama court, on the
speedy trial issue in Kentucky?

Now, I take it, all you could

get would be relief from the Alabama detainer in that action?
If your man shows up again in Kentucky, the Alabama court's

12
adjudication wouldn’t bind the State of Kentucky as to its
right to try him.
MR. HOOD:

The thing I don’t understand about your

hypothetical, Mr. Justice, is whether the action that you
contemplate in Alabama against whom would it have been
brought ?
Q

Well, you were the one that suggested

Alabama being an appropriate forum.

I presume the Alabama

custodian.
MR. HOOD:

Well, I think that the — I think that

not only — I think that not only the detainer but I think
that the indictment itself can — could perhaps be tested in
Alabama although at least as to that I certainly wish not to
be pushed that far and that pushes at least two steps beyond
the facts of this case.
Q

Well, certainly the State of Kentucky wouldn’t

be bound if it didn't appear in the Alabama proceedings,
would it?
MR. HOOD:

Well, that is the question, I think the

interesting question on your hypothetical would be whether
or not there is sufficient custodial presence of the State
of Kentucky in Alabama such that they could be served and
could be made to answer, again, for the teaching of this
court in Strait against Laird, finding although ultimately
in Indiana, and Indland commanding officer finding the

13
requisite custodial presence in California.
Q

You says though* there might be custodial

presence In Alabama then* not merely by virtue of the force
which Alabama would give the outstanding detainer, but by
virtue of the fact that Kentucky had Indicted the man?
MR. HOOD:

Because there is — there are effects

of the outstanding Kentucky indictment which are being felt
and imposed upon the petitioner in Alabama in prison, given
the nature of an outstanding indictment and what it does to
rehabilitation.

In short, the kinds of factors that were

discussed by this court In Smith against Hooey, the negative
effect on rehabilitation and all of the other Implications
of prison life.
Q

Well, certainly, of course, he can raise his

speedy trial defense ultimately if and when he is ever
tried in Kentucky, I take it?
MR. HOOD:
Q

He can ultimately raise it.

Yes.

MR. HOOD:

But, under the decision of this court,

he need not wait and assert that as a defense.
Q

Nov;, thus far, you haven’t mentioned his

Kentucky escape.

Do you have any comment on this, as to how

it affected the fact situation here?
MR. HOOD:

Yes.

My comment is that it speaks not

at all to the jurisdictional question but only speaks, If at

all to the Petitioner's entitlement to a speedy trial.

It

was a contention which was urged by the State of Kentucky
in the district court and was considered

by the district

court judge as mentioned In his opinion and to the extent that
it weighs and was weighed and, as I say, does not affect the
appropriateness of the Petitioner's jurisdictional choice
only, if at all, it speaks to whether or not he Is entitled
to relief.
Q

Well, if you insist that habeas corpus is

a proper remedy, and In Kentucky, what about exhaustion?
MR. HOOD:

Well, I think that the remedies that

would be exhausted are Kentucky remedies and those are the
remedies that he exhausted here.
Q

Like what ?

MR. HOOD:

Well, he went into Kentucky and filed

and requested a speedy trial.
Q

And?

MR. HOOD:
Q

Made two demands.

I mean, what did he do, he filed a motion?

MR, HOOD:

Yes, he filed a motion to the trial

court, two of them, as a matter of fact and then ultimately
took the case to the highest Kentucky court, all the

while

asking for his right to a speedy trial.
Q
a speedy trial?

And on the

grounds of federal entitlement to

15
MR. HOOD:
Q

Asserting all the while —

So he has been denied, right up through and

down through the courts?
MR. HOOD:

Exactly and of course, it is Kentucky

where he should exhaust those remedies.

It is Kentucky which

should defend on that issue and defend, incidentally, most
appropirately and most conveniently in Kentucky rather than
in Alabama.
Q

Of course, going back to my question of the

escape, but for the escape, he would have no Kentucky problems
at all, would he?
had a speedy trial.
MR. HOOD:

He would have been tried.

He would have

He wouldn't be complaining.
Well, I think In a but for causal sense,

that is probably true, although I don’t think — I know of no
doctrine of waiver.
thereafter.

He tfas indicted in 1967, arrested shortly

He did escape and went to California.

Some

weeks later he was held in Alabama and available to Kentucky
and has been available to them ever since and the notion that
having once had him and having escaped, he is not now
entitled to a speedy trial is a doctrine, is a ruling that —
Q

Of course, I don't understand Kentucky

saying that he was not entitled to a speedy trial.

They

have that mountain to cross later, if and when they ever
determine to try him, do they not?
MR. HOOD:

I think that is precisely what Kentucky

16
says.

The state will,

of course, speak to that.

I can

think of nothing else that they are saying with regard to
the escape because it escapes me how the question of his
flight to California pertains to the appropriateness of his
jurisdictional choice.
Q
before.

Let me back up.

Perhaps I misunderstood you

I thought you said that if he had an indictment

outstanding in Kentucky and was not in custody in Alabama
at all, he could challenge the Kentucky indictment in
Alabama by habeas corpus.

Did I really understand you to

say that?
MR. HOOD:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I think you

really did understand me to say that and I hope that you
also heard me say that you also heard me say that I think
that that is at least two steps beyond the facts of this
case.
Q

Well, suppose, and I am not so sure that it

is not relevant, suppose he is in Alabama because he doesn’t
want to go to Kentucky where they will arrest him on the
indictment and take him into custody and he wants to test out
the indictment without being in custody and without having
to put up bond if he is available?

Do you really think habeas

corpus could conceivably go that far?
MR. HOOD:

Excuse me, your Honor.

I have misunderstood for my part.

I think that

I think the two things

17
have gotten put together.

I think that what I — I Intended

to say no more than that If he was at liberty, he could go
to Kentucky even though at liberty and in Kentucky petition
for a writ of habeas corpus.
What I additionally said was it is my position that
while in prison in Alabama, even though there wasn’t a de­
tainer, it is my position that he i^ould nonetheless be able
to petition for a writ of habeas corpus in Alabama because
of the consequences of the Kentucky Indictment on his
Alabama prison tenure.

The two things that got put together

were, number one, his being at liberty and number two, his
then wanting to go to Alabama and no, if I may rerespond to
your question, your Honor, I don’t go that far.
Q

But you are still maintaining, apparently —

and I am not sure this is relevant to this case — that the
indictment can be tested in a habeas corpus proceeding,
absent any custody, anywhere?
MR. HOOD:

I think that is what Klopfer teaches

with regard to the amount of restraint, to the amount of
custody which is implicit in an outstanding indictment and
under that circumstance, as I just said but a moment ago, I
think that he could go to Kentucky and I think that he could
contest that kind and that amount and that quality of
restraint in Kentucky by habeas corpus.

I say that, not only

in reliance on Klopfer, but when X put Klopfer —

18
Q

You do not because you do have a detainer

out against you
you

which you allege, at least, is causing

troubles in Alabama.
MR. HOOD:

But I thinlc the reason to face up to

the issue is that I don’t think that the circumstance that
Kentucky has issued the detainer should instruct us —> should
be the tail that wags the jurisdictional dog because even
without the detainer and the reason we get to the issue at
all is because even absent the detainer, I think it makes -—
it is an easier case on the fact of the petition.
Q
is a remedy.

Well, also, what you are really interested in
I mean, what you want Is the indictment

dismissed, not the detainer cancelled.
MR. HOOD:

Precisely and with or without a

detainer, the place to do all of that and the United States
District Court to address itself to that question, it seems
to me, is Kentucky.
Your Honor, I do have some time left and with your
permission, I would reserve it.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Hood.

Mr. Famularo.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN M. FAMULARO, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. FAUMLARO:
the court:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

19
The Petitioner has fairly and adequately stated the
facts of this case.

However, we do wish to emphasize that the

Commonwealth of Kentucky returned this Petitioner from the
distant State of California and that he would have received
his speedy trial but for his own conduct.
In this proceeding, the Petitioner seeks —
Q

If you agree with his statement, what have

you to convince me that he would get a speedy trial?
MR. FAMULARO:

That he would get a speedy trial,

your Honor?
Q

Yes.

MR. FAMULARO:

Well, first of all, it is our firm

contention that, based upon this factual distinction between
this Petitioner and the cases which Petitioner has cited for
his right to a speedy trial, certainly distinguished this
case from that one.

In addition to this, we submit that by

his conduct he has foreclosed or precluded from asserting
at this time and at Kentucky expense again, his right to

a

speedy trial.
Q

When can he ask for It?

MR. FAMULARO:

We submit, your Honor, that he can

ask for it at the expiration of his sentence or, if he is to

3eek relief, he must seek relief —
Q
sentence?

And that would be true if it was a 50-year

20
MR. FAMULARO:
Q

Your Honor, I —

Aren't you really taking the position that

because he escaped, he lost his right to a speedy trial
forever?
MR. FAMULARO:

No, your Honor, we are not saying

that he lost it forever.
Q

Well, what do you say short of that?

MR. FAMULARO:

We are saying that he has lost it

at his whim and at his demand and at this time and at
Kentucky expense again.
Q

Certainly, if we bring him back —

How long was he gone?

MR. FAMULARO:

He was gone approximately two

years, your Honor, before he made — or at least one year
before he made a subsequent demand.
Q

Well, how long was he gone before you

brought him back?
MR. FAMULARO:

He was indicted in 1967 and x*as

brought back in the latter part of 1967.
Q

Less than a year?

MR. FAMULARO:

Yes.

Yes, your Honor, he was, from

California.
Q

Well, then how much longer would he have to

wait for a speedy trial appointment?
MR. FAMULARO:
Q

I think he is presently serving the —

I said no under your rule how long would he

21
have to wait after that?
MR. PAMULARO:
continuous circuit.

The Jefferson Circuit was a

He could have obtained his trial at that

time, your Honor, and if he had —
Q

Well, why

MR. FAMULARO:

wasn't he tried?
He wasn’t tried due to his escape.

He was not subject to our —
Q

I thought you said you brought him back to

Kentucky?
MR. FAMULARO:

He escaped before we could afford

him the speedy trial which he demanded,
Q

But you never brought him back, did you?

MR. FAMULARO:

Yes, he was in the Jefferson County

jail awaiting trial, which was set, presumably, for the
next day.
Q

And then he escaped from jail?

MR. FAMULARO:

And then he escaped, yes, your

Honor.
Q

And do you say now, when can he raise the

question of speedy trial?
MR. FAMULARO:

We are saying that if he is to

raise this argument, under existing law, he may seek
relief in the district of confinement which I'll get to later
but he may raise this argument at the expiration of his
sentence.

Now, I realize that this may seem like a harsh

22
result, Mr. Justice Marshall, but it is no more harsh than
the expulsion of a defendant from the courtroom by his
conduct and this court has held that this is no violation of
his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation.
Q

I would assume that you would get your

uniform agreement that while he is not in custody, he cannot
raise the speedy trial point when he is not available.

I

would assume a lot of people would agree with you on that.
But he is available and he has been available for how many
years?
MR. FAMULARO:

For approximately three years in

Alabama, your Honor, four years.
Q

And at any time, Alabama could try him?

MR. FAMULARO:
Q

Kentucky could try him, your Honor.

I mean Kentucky — at any time.

MR. FAMULARO:

Yes, your Honor, but we think this

remedy also overlooks the fact that Kentucky has fulfilled
its speedy trial obligation.

We submit that by bringing the

Petitioner back, we have fulfilled our Smith versus Hooey
obligation.

Petitioner has cited no authority for the

proposition that we must afford him a speedy trial as often
as he can escape and we are certainly aware of none.
Q

Well, he hasn't escaped but once.

MR. FAMULARO:

Well, we submit, your Honor, that

that factual distinction is very relevant in this proceeding

23

Q

It would make no difference to you if he

escaped from Alabama., would it?
MR. PAMULARO:
Q

No, your Honor.

Would that total it for six more years?

MR. FAMULARO:

I don't know as it would total it

for six more years because under our argument, it is totalled
at least now, at demand, under our theory, until the
expiration of his sentence and certainly he would probably be
extradited to Alabama to serve that sentence, the remainder
of that portion.
Q

Do you mean that even at the expiration of

his sentence and then Kentucky brings him back and puts him
on trial, do you say he has waived his speedy trial claim
entirely?
MR. PAMULARO:

No, your Honor, he would still have

his due process rights which he is always going to have.

The

requirements which this court set forth in Barker versus
Wingo would certainly be capable of being raised at that
time.
Q

You mean he has only waived it during

this

time?
MR. PAMULARO:

He waived his right to demand a

speedy trial at this time and at state expense, your Honor.
He had not waived his right to a fair trial.
submitting that at all.

We are not

He certainly always has his right to

2H
a fair trial and he can attack that detainer — I mean.,
attack that indictment at that time, at the time that
Kentucky brings him back.
Q

Is this the claim that Kentucky made when he

asked for a speedy trial in Kentucky and and then the denial
was appealed?
MR. FAMULARO:

This is true, your Honor.

We made

this argument in the Sixth Circuit and the United States
Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit did not decide it
upon this issue.
Q

They decided it on the jurisdiction.
Yes, but In the state courts, I understood

from counsel that he had asked for a speedy trial.

It had

been denied in the state courts and he had appealed It to the
highest court of Kentucky.
MR. FAMULARO:

My recollection is, your Honor, that

that was not brought up in the district court.

Now, I was

not on the case at that time but in looking at our response
to the show cause order filed in the district court, I do not
recall seeing that we raised the argument of the waiver.

In

fact, It was not until I got the case in the United States
Court of Appeals for the —
Q
court.

Yes, but I am not talking about the district

I am talking about the state courts.
MR. FAMULARO:

state court.

No, this has not been raised in the

The waiver has not specifically been considered

25
by the Kentucky Court of Appeals.

Kentucky has taken the

view that this defendants this petitioner, is precluded or
foreclosed from asserting this right at this time.
Q

Yes, but what did your state courts do?

MR. FAMULARO:
Q

Our state court --

As we understand it, when he had tried in the

trial court to get a speedy trial and it was denied, he took
an appeal to some Kentucky appellate court.

Now, what

appellate court was that?
MR. FAMULARO:

What he did in that proceeding, your

Honor, was brought a mandamus action against the circuit
court.
Q

He brought that in what court?

MR. FAMULARO:

In the — well, first in the

Jefferson Circuit court and then that was denied.

He

appealed that denial of the writ of mandamus.
Q

Well, now, why — what was the basis of the

denial in the circuit court?
MR. FAMULARO:

I am certain, your Honor, that it

was summary and I am certain that the Jefferson County
officials were probably of the opinion that they had brought
this man back once and that they were —
Q

What was the ground of the denial of his

applicaion for mandamus by the court?
I®. FAMULARO:

J

It was summary.

There were no —

26
Q

Then he took an appeal from that denial to

what court?
MR. FAMULARO:

to the Kentucky Court of Appeals,

which is our highest court.
Q

And what was the basis upon which it denied?

MR. FAMULARO:
Q

Again, it was a summary order.

What claims did he make in that court?

Speedy trial?

I'm sure it must have been, that he

had a federal right to a speedy trial.
MR. FAMULARO:
Q

I’m certain it was, your Honor.

And what was the Kentucky — whether they

read an opinion or not in the court — what did your office
or what did the Attorney General of Kentucky, what was his
claim in the Kentucky court?
MR. FAMULARO:

I think we filed a general response,

your Honor and —
Q

And took the same position as you are taking

here?
MR. FAMULARO:

Took the same position as we are

taking here and that in addition to this, we thought this
court was without jurisdiction to — vie 11, at that point we
did not raise the habeas corpus, but we did —
Q

Let's assume that he had filed the petition

for certiorari from that denial?
MR. FAMULARO:

That would have been an appropriate

27
Q

The day after we decided Smith against Hooey?

MR. FAMULARO:

I think, your Honor, that that may

have indeed avoided many of the conflicts with which we are
faced today*
Q

Well, would Kentucky have made the argument

then that he was not entitled to mandamus because he had
escaped once?
MR. FAMULARO:

Yes, your Honor, I think we would

have made that argument because we do —
Q

If they had asked for cert and it had been

granted in argument here, you would have said Smith against
Hooey notwithstanding, you don't get the same result here
because he has escaped once?
MR. FAMULARO:

I think — yes, your Honor, we

submit we would have raised that argument because we
consider it an extremely important equitable consideration
in this regard.

As I stated, the Petitioner has cited no

authority that a state must go through the administrative
burden, must go through the possibility of escape, which
always looms in the background of a multi-state habeas
corpus, and in addition to this, must go through the costs
of transportation which are indeed, today, being thrown
upon states in an abundance.
Q

He'll go to court someday, won’t he?

MR. FAMULARO:

Yes, your Honor, he will, but it is

28
our contention that at that point it will at least, in all
likelihood, if there is a conviction returned, it would be
a

one-way sentence, a one-way trip.
Q

Wouldn’t it cost you more then than it does

now, the way prices are going up?
Wouldn’t you save money if you bring him
Q
brought back.

back now?

There is some confusion up here about being
You have used this term three or four times.

He was brought back from where?
MR. FAMULARO:

From the State of California,

Mr. Justice.
Q

And was that were he was arrested originally?

MR. FAMULARO:

He was arrested in California,

apparently subject to the return of our indictments.

He was,

at the time of the return of our indictments, a fugitive.
But he was brought back to Kentucky after being found in
California on the Kentucky indictments.
Q

You mean the California arrest was after his

escape?
MR. FAMULARO:
Q

It was before?

MR. FAMULARO:
Q

No, it was before.

It was before his escape, yes.

So when you say he was brought back you

merely mean that he was brought back for ultimate trial?
MR. FAMULARO:

That’s right.

29
Q

And thereafter he escaped.

MR. FAMULARO:
Q

That’s right3 your Honor.

Where did he escape to?

Id. FAMULARO:

That’s when he escaped to Alabama,

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, and was subsequently apprehended there.
We submit that in a proceedings such as this, there
must be a balancing of interest.
Q

Before you go to that, counsel, I realize

you can’t speak for the State of Kentucky on every aspect of
this, but why isn't every consideration, whether you take
fairness or practical matters, why don’t they all dictate
the swiftest trial possible while the witnesses are available
for both the prosecution and the defense?
MR. FAMULARO:
your Honor.

I think that argument is very valid,

At the same time, as I pointed out to

Mr. Justice White, the Petitioner has not waived his right
to demand a speedy trial — I mean, his right to demand a
fair trial and at that time, at the time of Kentucky’s
subsequent trial efforts, if, in fact, we do try him, it
could work to his advantage as well as ours.

He has not

waived his right to a fair trial.
Q

Well, doesn’t the public Interest suggest

that he should be tried —
Id. FAMULARO:
Q

—

Public interest does dictate —

laying aside what your Constitutional

30
rights are, doesn’t the broad public interest suggest that
he be tried as 3wlftly as possible?
MR. FAMULARO:

Yes* your Honors this is true, but

in light of the unique facts of this case, the public must
also raise the question of governmental officials, how many
times must we try to try the man?

At some point it must

become no longer feasible to even try to try this man and,
certainly, by his subsequent —
Q

Of course, that isn’t getting any better by

the day, is it?
MR. FAMULARO:

No, it’s not, your Honor.

I realize

this and I realize that the constitutional rights certainly
are clear in the regard of a speedy trial.

But at the same

time, we clearly submit that the factual distinction between
this case is something that cannot be overlooked.
Q

But is this correct, that he just started last

March serving another ten-year sentence in Alabama?
MR. FAMULARO:

Petitioner has cited that.

Cer­

tainly he will make reference, I presume, and answer that
question in his rebuttal.
Q

I wonder if this — does that bear on it?

don't know how long an Alabama ten-year sentence means in
terms of actual service, but probably seven or eight years,
still.
MR. FAMULARO:

I would presume it would, your

I

31
Honor, that is about the •—
Q

In Kentucky —

MR. FAMULARO:
Q

In Kentucky it would be —

So you wouldn’t have to try him until then,

seven or eight years from now.
MR. FAMULARO:
Q

This is true, your Honor.

Has Alabama refused to bring him back?

I

suppose you haven’t asked.
MR. FAMULARO:

No, your Honor, we haven’t asked

pending the deciding of this court of the Ahrens versus
Clark case which I would now like to get into at this time.
Q

Do you have any reason to think Alabama would

object to having him taken to Kentucky for trial?
MR. FAMULARO:

I have no reason to think that

Alabama would object, your Honor.
Q

At the same time —

Are you both parties to the Uniform Act?

MR. FAMULARO:

No, we are not.

If we were, I

presume this problem would not exist.
Q

Mr. Famularo, you keep saying that this man

is going to get a fair trial.

My question is, can he get a

fair trial thirteen years after indictment?
MR. FAMULARO:
Q

Your Honor, under the requirements —

Fair trial.

MR. FAMULARO:

— set forth in Barker versus

Wingo, if the state has not met its requirements, then it

32
will not be tried anyway.
Q

But you keep emphasizing, whatever comes, he

is going to get a "fair trial."

Then X assume you mean that

he would not be tried?
MR. FAMULARO:

I assume in that case, your Honor,

he would not be tried.
Q

Well, why hold the retainer?

MR. FAMULARO:

We submit that on the unique factual

considerations of this case and in light of the fact that
they are both still valid indictments and have not been
declared to the contrary by any court of law.

Until they

were or until he raised his right to a fair trial at the
appropriate time —
Q

Well, he has raised the speedy trial point

twice.
MR. FAMULARO:

But he has not raised any attack

upon his right to a fair trial and he could do that at the
time that we subsequently attempted

to try him.

If I may at this point get into my second reason
for not overturning Ahrens versus Clark.
Congress has vested authority in it under the
article three, sections one and two of the United States
Constitution to ordain and establish courts and with this is
the power to fix and limit jurisdictions.
so held.

This court has

We submit that Ahrens versus Clark interpreted that

33
the the district of confinement was the proper district in
which to bring any habeas corpus petition as presented in
the instant case.

Congress has clarly set jurisdiction in

the district of confinement and this court so held in
Ahrens versus Clark.
The

majority opinion in that case was concerned

with x*here the petitioner is.
importance.

That was the place of

Both the majority and the minority recognized

the various evils of an unlimited type jurisdiction where a
disinterested judge in Florida might call before him a
Vermont prisoner serving time on a Vermont sentence in a
Vermont jail and this was the evil that Congress sought to
remedy and at the same time, Congress considered the various
policy considerations which are present in the habeas
corpus and that is the possibility of escape, the-burden and
costs of transportation.
Now, we recognize that this court in Nelson versus
George left open its judgment
continuing

on the question of the

vitality of Ahrens and in that case, it commented

upon the propriety of a legislative amendment to remedy this
situation.
We wish to point out to the court that a legislative
amendment is presently pending in Congress.

We are also

aware of the case of Schlanger against Seaman which stands,
apparently, in opposition to Ahrens.

However, we submit that

34
Schlanger was decided on an erroneous premise and that
premise was that Ahrens had decided that there was a
territorial limitation upon the person of the respondent.
We submit that Ahrens did not make this decision
because it was not called upon to decide it.

It was brought

into the District of Columbia District Court.

The Attorney

General was the respondent.

Certainly he was within the

jurisdiction of the court.

There was no need to make this

decision if they had jurisdiction over him.

It was only the

question as to whether or not he was a proper custodian
and as we pointed out in Ahrens, the place of confinement
was felt to be the proper jurisdiction under the limitation
which Congress had in fact imposed upon section 2241.
There are also other factual differences between
Schlanger but the problem Is brought to a head in Strait
versus Laird, where a dissenting opinion of this court
stated that In fact the doctrine set forth in Schlanger had
truly been emasculated in the Strait opinion.
Therefore, It is our firm belief that jurisdiction
is fixed in the court of confinement.

The Petitioner claims

that this places him in a situation of having a remedy with
no relief.

However, we think that this overlooks a federal

declaratory judgment action.

It overlooks his Civil Rights

action under 1983 and it overlooks his rights __
Q

Well, what would the declaratory judgment

35
action be under, if not 1983?
MR. FAMULARO:

This is true, your Honor, it would

be brought under 1983 in all likelihood to declare the rights
and interests involved.
Q

Are you sure that you would prefer

a 1983 --

welcome a 1983 action as compared with an habeas corpus
action?
MR. FAMULARO:

Well, there are practical problems

involved in both of those, your Honor, but we submit that
based upon the intent of Congress in fixing jurisdiction and
based upon the policy considerations which Congress
considered at that time and which this court considered in
Ahrens versus Clark, then jurisdiction is fixed there and
until Ahrens is overruled, which we submit it should not be
done because to do such would be to allow an adjudicatory
expansion of the legislative restrictions imposed in this
area by Congress.
We also wish to point out that the Fifth Circuit
does not, in essence, say that the district of confinement is
not a proper form.

The case cited by the Petitioner, May

versus State of Georgia , only remanded for a reconsideration
as to whether or not a sufficient demand had been made upon
the Georgia authorities.
Q

But if he turns around and brings a 1983

action where prisoners may, in this situation, sue under 1983,

36
there would be no requirement for exhaustion.

The state

courts of Kentucky would not get first crack at it9 would
they?
MR. FAMULARO:

This is also true, your Honor.

We submit, therefore, that if this court decides
that jurisdiction truly resides in the district of
confinement, the Petitioner will obtain his relief.

He will

have his detainer quashed if, in fact, the federal judge
in the nature
sitting there assumes that there is jurisdiction/of an in
rehm proceeding, which we submit there are both logical and
legal reasons for allowing the district court to treat this
there♦
Just as a divorce proceeding may proceed in the
could
absence of a spouse, so, too,/a federal judge sitting in
Alabama determine the status of the Petitioner insofar as it
is affected by the actions of Kentucky and the status of his
rights insofar as they are affected by the

Commonwealth of

Kentucky and render a decision even to the extent of
nullifying the prosecution if, in fact, Kentucky has not
made good faith efforts and, under the Federal Supremacy
Clause — Kentucky —
Q

Mr. Famularo, does this contemplate

Kentucky would be a party to that proceeding?
MR* FAMULARO:

It would not be a party in the in

persona sense,your Honor, but we think that it would be a

37
party in the sense that —
Q

In some sense it would be concluded although

not appearing, by the result?
MR. FAMULARO:

Your Honor, in the nature of an in

rehm proceeding, we submit that it would mean this, yes.
Q

Where do you get your in

MR. FAMULARO:

We found no cases

point in this, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

rehm analogy here?
specifically in

However, we think

there are both logical reasons found In this.
This case involves the speedy trial situation.

It

is unlike the postconviction proceedings where Kentucky law
may have to be applied and where there may be numerous
witnesses.

This is a speedy trial case.

That federal court

sitting in Alabama can certainly determine if Kentucky has
made good faith efforts to secure him.

They can determine if

this Petitioner had in fact made good faith efforts to
secure his trial and they can render a ruling..
We submit that there is legal basis for this
contention found in the broad language of section 2243 of
Title 28 and we submit that that language is broad enough so
as to enable us to construe it so as to authorize estraterritorial jurisdiction in this regard.
Q

It seems to me that the contention that you

are urging in that sort of statutory construction would be
a far more sweeping tampering with the language of Congress

38
than our taking another look at Ahrens against Clark.

MR. FAMULARO:

We submit that it would not, your

Honor3 because it would not work in a dual way.

The

expansion would not be in Kentucky but would be in the
district of confinement, which this court had interpreted in
Ahrens versus Clark that that is the place of jurisdiction
and, certainly, I think it would fulfill the intent of
Congress.
22*13 does not speak of terms of territorial
limitations upon the respondent but is broad and we submit
that it would not be tampering as much as trying to overrule
Ahrens.

Certainly, Ahrens needs its continuing vitality.
We submit that this court in Nelson commented upon

the propriety of the legislative amendment.

Congresses

inaction in this regard certainly may be deemed as a tacit
approval of the interpretation given by this court in Ahrens
versus Clark.

This court has recently recognized Congresses

tacit approval by its inaction in the Baseball Antitrust
situation.
Q

That was fifty years or more and it is only

a year since the legislation on the Nelson George case has
been —
MR. FAMULARO:

This is true, your Honor, but

Congress ha3 at least been aware of the problem which has
existed since Peyton versus Rowe.

39
Q

Well, it would be more accurate to say maybe

two or three members of Congress are aware of it.

It is

in the Judiciary Committee in a subcommittee.
MR. FAMULARO:

This

is true, your Honor.

But, certainly, some portion of Congress must have
been aware of it since 1967 because that is when the problem
has become critical, and 1968 in light of Peyton versus
Rowe and Smith versus Hooey.
Q

Well, you don’t suppose all 531 members were

aware of it in the case of the baseball situation?
MR. FAMULARO:

They probably were not, your Honor,

and certainly that is not a dispositive argument, but we think
it at least is analagous in this regard.
Thus we submit the jurisdiction clearly lies in
the place of confinement.

If this court so finds, the

Petitioner will receive his relief, the intent of Congress
will be met, the policy considerations will be met and at the
same time there will be no expansion of the limitations
which Congress has placed upon the Jurisdiction in this
regard.

Rather, there will be a proper relief in a proper

form in a proper manner.
Q

Could I ask you if the state has anything to

say about the proceeding that he brought in the Court of
Appeals of Kentucky for mandamus to force a speedy trial?
Is there any objection by the state that that was not the

40
proper remedy to be sought there?

Or is that the way a

person goes about trying to get a speedy trial in the State
of Kentucky?
MR. FAMULARO:

That is not normally the way, I

don't think, your Honor, because the writ of —
Q

Well, he filed a motion first in the trial

court, didn't he?
HR. FAMULARO:
Q

This is true.

And then he brought the writ of mandamus in

the State Supreme Court?
MR. FAMULARO:

Wo, he brought it first in the

circuit court, whic is the lower level.
Q

And then he appealed the denial?

MR. FAMULARO:
Q

He appealed that denial —

Oh, he did?

MR. FAMULARO:

— to

the state's highest courts.

X think that will bear it out, Mr. Hood.
Q

It wasn't then a motion in a criminal case?

MR. FAMULARO:

No, it was not,your Honor.

It was

the extreme relief of mandamus.
Q

It is on page 8 of the record.

Q

Well, in any event —

Q

It cites the opinion.

It says,

"appeal to

the court of appeals of Kentucky, both demands were denied."
That is in the district court.

Hi
Q

Well, in any event, my question is, does the

State of Kentucky here, it doesn’t contend that he has any
other remedy In Kentucky courts that he has not exhausted?
MR. FAMULARO:

No.

No, your Honor.

He has

exhausted his remedies insofar as Kentucky is concerned.
Q

Until and unless he is brought to trial.

MR. FAMULARO:
Q

That's right.

Under Kentucky law, if the motion were made

now demanding an immediate trial or dismissal, would
Kentucky trial court have the power under Kentucky law to
dismiss the Indictment if it was not tried within thirty
days thereafter?
MR. FAMULARO:

There is no — it certainly would

have the power, your Honor — there is no written timespan
involved.

We have no cases in this regard.

I think that

the requirements as set forth by this court in Barker would
certainly be considered and upon a consideration of them,
the trial court could dismiss the indictment.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Hood.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID R. HOOD, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. HOOD:

Mr. Chief Justice and may It please the

Court:
I rise only to a few factual matters.

First of all,

H2
pertinent to the question last under discussion, I think that
I can report and I think that the record reflects that the
Petitioner has exhausted all of his state remedies.

He has

exhausted it in a way which not only is appropriate to
Kentucky procedures, but which has never been objected to by
the

State of Kentucky.
Q

And I gather it is true, Mr. Hood, that no

opinions have been written, no reasons stated x*hy the denials?
MR. HOOD:

In every Instance he has urged his

right to a speedy trial and in every instance he has relied
upon the teaching of this court in Smith against Hooey and in
every instance he has received a summary denial.
The second factual matter is yes, indeed, it is
true, Mr. Justice Brennan, that he does yet have ten years to
serve.

He just

began this spring to serve a ten-year

Alabama sentence.

Third, with regard — I think it was to your
question, Mr. Justice White — both Kentucky and Alabama
have signed the Uniform Extradition Act.

The Act that they

have not signed is the Uniform Agreement on Detainers.

There

would be no problem in returning the Petitioner from
Alabama, if Kentucky made such a request and, indeed, as
Kentucky concedes, it made no such request.
Finally, with regard to the assertion that this
matter will soon be cured by Congressional action.

As near

43
as we are able to determine, to try and follow the history
of HR3804, it has been referred to subcommittee, subcommittee
three of the House Judiciary Committee has taken no action on
the bill and therefore it appears to be dead.
I don't think that we should and I don't think we
need to wait for that kind of relief.

I think there is too

much judicial business to be done and too many petitions to
be disposed of and to be disposed of in what we contend is
a vastly more efficacious way if the

strict rule of Ahrens

against Clark is relaxed.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
(Thereupon, at 2:4l o'clock p.m, the case
was submitted.)
