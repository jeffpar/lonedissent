OM BEHALF OP PETITIONER UNITED STATES
MR» GMIMOW.i

May it please the Courts

In the present fluid state of our l&w, courts
spend a good ’deal of time going over
the situation in this case.

old ground.

That is

The case is here on certiorari

to review a judgment of the Court of Claims.
The suit there was begun by the -administrators
of the. estate of Rose Mason, who was a restricted Osage
Indian.

Acting pursuant to this

Court's decision in

Wust vv Oklahoma Tax Commission, 334 0.8., the Oaaga agency
of the Department of the Interior filed an Oklahoma estate
tax return on her estate and paid the tax due.
The claim in the suit in the court below is that
this payment, though in conformity with a decision of this
Court, conceded to be squarely in point and not overruled,
was in fact a breach of trust, because the United States
should have known that the west, cash would be overruled by
this Court.

Tho CoBit of Cloires so held and hold -the Unitae

States' liable to the estate for the amount of the tax paid.
Q

Could it not be somethihg lees than that,

Mr. Solicitor General, that there was enough of a question
about the West case that some precautions might have been
taken?.
MRo GRISWOLD:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, 1 think

that is true, but t suppose that is almost always true with
respect to a trustee if there is a decision 20 years old
and maybe there are various things which might hava
happened and he ought to present it to a court again.

1

think that the question of the duty of a subordinate agency
of the United states to question decisions of this Court
ought not to arise: to the dignity of a breach of trust,
at any rate, that is the issue in this case.
Q

Mr. Solicitor, does the record show the

approximate size of the decedent's estate?

I take it the

state tax was abort $8,000, which would indicate a vary
substantial estate:, as I recall state inheritance tax rates
MR. GRISWOLD:

I believe that the iteuts are

indicated on page 6 of the appendix, and they would appear on
a quick addition'
estate.

to 'come to about $125,000 far the

Osage head rights, $48,000; securities held in

trust, $15,000; surplus trust funds, $48,000?' and two other
items.

On a quid adding X get something like a hundred

and twenty, hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars, on

5
which the tax paid was §7,700.

*

Th© United States brought. Oklahoma into the case
as a third-party defendant,

And the court below also held

that Oklahoma was liable to the United States in the
amount of th© tax-,

Both Oklahoma and the United States

have sought review of this decision, and I shall appear for
20 minutes and Mr., Dunpan represen tin? Oklahoma will use
the other ten Minutes.
In order to determine whether the Unitad Statas
committed a breach of trust, it will be necessary to review
some decisions,

There are three decisions of this Court,

which are particularly relevant.
The first of these, decided 30 years ago,
Oklahoma Tax Commiesion v. United States, in an opinion
by Justice Black dealt with restricted Osage property.

And

although the United States appeared 'there and vigorously
contended, as is shorn* "by th© brief filed, that the
restricted Osage property was not subject to Oklahoma
inheritance tax, this Court reviewed the situation,
concluded that there was nothing in the Osage allotment
act which established a tax exemption and directly held
that the restricted property was subject to Oklahoma
inherttance tax,
Justice Murphy was one of the dissenters in that
oas».

But just five years later there came up £he case of

6
West

This t?a@ known to the appropriate officers of

They acted accordingly, and they

ought to be sbl© to rely on a decision of this Start which
has not been overfilled nor even remotely questioned her®.
In this connection, I would

like to call,

attention to the decisions of this Court just three weeks
ago yesterday in iicClanahan v. Arizona _Stnte Tins
Commission- and Moacalero Apache Tribe y,

m

Not only

do these cases show the extreme complexity ansi uncertainty
of the field of state taxation of Indians, but in the
Meacalero case this Court on page 11 cited Oklahoma Tam
Commission v. United States and Squire v. Caposman in the
same paragraph, indeed back to back it might be said.
Oklahoma Tax Commission was the cast on which the
West decision is based.

And it hardly seems likely that

this Court three weeks ago contemplated that Squire had
overruled Oklahoma Tax Commission.

Squire is a case toT&©

dealt with, of course, but it is a federal income tax case
involving & very special kind of income tax, a capital
gains tax-'imposed on the realisation, of

most of the value

of the Indianaf property-by the sale ©£ the timber which

10
gave it its value»
Oklahoma.

Ce^Riasion and -West involve a state

inheritance tax, often treated differently from an income
tax, as in the case, for example, of the federal estate
tax as applied to the transfer of state and municipal
bonds, where the income is not taxable but the Court,
over a period of 75 years has held that a transfer tax op
death can properly be collected.
Also a responsible officer in the Osage agency
in Oklahoma might have understood and felt t&dl acted
accordingly.
By appropriate standards of the law of trust,
this was not a breach of trust, we contend, -sad the United
States should not have been held liable for complying with
a decision of this Court.

The liability imposed here is so

novel that we have; not bean able to find trust decisions
directly in point*

But w© have cited Professor Scott's

treatise, and we believe it supports our position that the
Court of Claims went too far- in finding liability here.
Of course, if the United States is liable, we
support the decision below in holding that Oklahoma is
liable to indemnify the United States as a third-party
defendant,

In private practice, when such a conflict of

That is not.so easy in public office.

We have only limited authority to retain outside courself

particular problem.

which would resolve this

This has not been dona.

It has been.suggested that the Solicitor General
might ask various interested agencies of the Government to
file briefs or fee incorporate the views of different
agencies in a single brief.

It is not clear, -though, that

this would always meet the responsibility of the Solicitor
General to this Court; for one of the functions of the
Solicitor Gfe.-irrai. X suppose, if? to reconcile aad adjust
divergent views of Government-officers and, so far as

12
possiblei to present a single view to this Court.
This area' can be one of great difficulty.# for
there are often widely divergent views with respect to
Indian problems, expending on whether one looks at It solely
from the point of view of the Indians or whether he seeks
t© deal with and. reconcile as far as possible many
competing governmental interests, such as the taxing power
or the law of governmental instrumentalities or the
responsibility for the enforcement of crimina! law.
Xn many cases it has been possible to work these
things out and to present a unified view.

That was done,

for example, in McClanahan and Mescalero.
In other eases, the difficulties have been acute,
as in the hqv.a Caliente case, where the Court asked the
Solicitor General to state his views and ha did so, though
endeavoring to make it plain that his view was not shared
by some other officers of the Government.
In this case, we have filed a brief in which we
have endeavored to state both sides as fairly and evenly as
possible without taking an official position*

Consequently,

on this final question, X ask the Court to consider .the
materials in our brief..

If the time has come when West

should be overruled, this Court is the place ;?here that
action should be taken.
If the West csss can still stand, it would fas

13
helpful if this Court would state that fact and in terms
which would indicata whether the decision is applicable to
federal income and estate taxes as well.
Q

Mr. Solicitor General, even if it were

overruled, I take it your position would be, nevertheless,
the liability was erroneously—
MR. GRISWOLDs

Yes, Mr. Justice.

Our position

would be that it was not a breach of trust to comply with
an outstanding unqualified decision of this Court, as to
which this Court had never indicated in any way the
slightest doubt and as to which only three works ago it
seemed to regard—Q

So, you would press for reversal here, even

if we were to overrule West.
MR, GRISWOLD:

We would press- for reversal even

if you were to overrule it.
Q

Would West taka with it Oklahoma Tax

Commission in 319 O.S.?
MR. GRISWOLD:
Q

Would West—

Would overruling West take with it

Oklahoma Tax Commission?
MR. GRISWOLD;

I would think so, Mr. Justice.

I

have never been able to see any distinction between the
restricted property in this case and trust property, and I
think that the Court in the West case regarded Oklahoma

14
Tax

Commission as the clearer and controlling authority.

<3

But a state privilege to tax would not mean

the federal® -would have to.

And, as a matter of federal

tax policy, the Federal Government would not need to impose
its taxes-MR, GRISWOLDs

Hot necessarily, although it is

quit® clear that the actions which have been taken by federal
executive representatives have been taken based on a view
that the approach in Squire weakens the West ease.
Q

But 1 would suppose that if -Congress

expressly said in so many words that federal estate taxes
still applied to Indian property, that that would, be the
end of the matter.
MR. GRISWOLD:

Congress could say so.

There is

not the slightest doubt Congress has not said so.
Q

It is a matter of administrative application

of the existing estate tax.
MR. GRISWOLD:

Influenced, Mr. Justice, by

impressions created as to whether this Court in Squire so
impaired the West case that it ought, not to ba followed.
Thera is no view from Congress as to whether the tax-—there
has been no action by Congress in this field from the
beginning and certainly not since Oklahoma Jgfct Coauaissioh
and Meet were decided.
Q

Certainly there has never been any indication

that Congress' disagreed with either West or Oklahoma,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL C, DUNCAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER STATE OF OKLAHOMA
MR. DUNCAN;

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:
As the Solicitor General has pointed out, this is
a very difficult situation which both the United States
Government and the State of Oklahoma finds itself in today.
The State of Oklahoma is in a particularly
difficult position because, as the Solicitor General
indic&fces, under the Court of Claims decision, if the United
Statos is found tc be liable for a breach of fiduciary
relationship, then, the ultimate responsibility for the

16
payment of this breach tests with the State of -Oklahoma.
.Since 1947 the State ©f Oklahoma has gone about
colla sting the tar. in question in conformity with this
Court's decision in West-G

Do you know how much tax is on the barrelhead

at issue here for Oklahoma?
MR, DUKCSHs

Yes, sir.

Of course, in this

particular ease, Mr. Justice, I think—

Indian estates so similarly situated $ although we have not
been able t© arrive at a figure, we anticipate it. is in
excess of several million dollars, depending, of course,
upon what time frme might ultimately be applied.
The Court of Claims, in deciding the case, did
say that as of 1967 or 1968, when the Ross Mason case came
about, that the Federal Government breached its fiduciary
relationship at that time.

It did not apparently foreclose

the possibility that under different circumstances they
might go back even to An earlier period of time; some time,
.1 guess, would have to be necessitated by the advent of
the Canpman case in 1954, could not go back prior to that

a possible severe tax refund consequence if the Court of

.17

Claims decision is allowed to stand.
Q

Mro Duncan, suppose that the United States

in this case had taken the position that it would not pay
the inheritance tax, what would Oklahoma have done?
MR, DUNCAN:

' I think that we would have had to

taken the United States to court in reliance upon the West
decision.
Q

So, you do feel that West is correctly

decided?
MR. DUNCAN:

I think that the practicality of the

situation would require the state to have taken the
Government to court with regard to West.

Whether or not

West should be considered good lav/, should this Court
decide otherwise, would not place a severe burden upon the
State of Oklahoma, if we are talking about prospective
actions only.
Q

The reason I asked this last question is

because I think I did not find In your brief any statement
to the effect that you felt that West was a correct
decision.
MR. DUNCAN:
Q

Well--

A lot of trust properties have expired, have

they not?
MR. DUNCAN:
Q

Yes, sir.

So that timewise it-is of limited significance.

18
X mean, it is not going to g© cm forever.
MR. DUNCAN:

No, that is correct.

I checked and

1 believe there is in the neighborhood of 550 present
restricted Osage Indian estates at the present time, or
Osage accounts at the present time, that slight become
involved in future—
Q

Do you have any idea what they aggregate#

Mr. Duncan?
MR. DUNCAN;
Q

In the future or in the past?

The existing ones.
*

MR. DUNCAN:

No, sir, I do not.

With regard to

the past, we do not have any information because the past
has been paid through the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the
Department of the Interior to the Oklahoma Tax Commission,
as would any other astata tax be paid.

And the Oklahoma

Tax Commission has not seen fit in the past to segregate
this money or even have a specific accountancy, accounting
of the monies collected from the Osage estate.
If some rule is set down where Oklahoma would bo
liable for all this in the past, even 196? or 1968, we would
have to go back and rely on the records of the Department
of the Interior as to what—
Q

Mr. Duncan, following up on Mr. Justice

Bi&ckaiun*s question, I can certainly see. why the Solicitor
General of the United.States feels :itself in e difficult

19
position here, since it is both a fiduciary for the
Indians and representative of the United States»

I too

was surprised to see that the State of Okla'hbrea did not'
take the position that West is rightly decided.

not a trustee for the Indians»
very capable counsel.

Yen are

The Indians presumably have

You have a decision in favor of your

state that says you are entitled to tax.
MR, DUWCAH%

Mr. Justice, I am sorry if we gave

%

that impression.

We feel that the West decision is .good

law at the present time.

The only point that the state

was trying to make in its brief was if the court wishes to

change that ruling or feels that West should no' longer be
the' state of the law, it should not impose the burden
upon the State of Oklahoma for the past actions of the
Federal Government in collecting the tax for the breach of
duty thereon.
We feel that until this Court says otherwise,
that the West decision must be considered good law.

We d©

not feel the Capoeman case*—although the rationale perhaps
is different in the Capoeraan case—we do not feel' that it

had a direct, overruling affect on the West decision and
that the West would still be the correct interpretation.

And certainly had not this come about, we would still be
making every attempt to collect the tax.
Q

At least in theory in this case, we do not

20

need to decide anything more than what you just argued, do
we, in order t© decide in your favor.

That until or unless

the West ease is overruled, it is to be considered the law,
period, without expressing any view on whether or not—
without either overruling it or affirming it; is that not
correct?

That is what your argument is.
MR. DUNCANs
Q

Yes.

Not that the West case should be- overruled

or not be overruled.

But simply that until it is overruled,

it is the law that, has to foe followed, and the Court of
Claims was wrong in not doing so.
MR. DUNCAN:

Yes, Mr. Justice, that is of course

what we argued at the time before the Court of Claims.
Q

In theory we

would not need to say anything

more in order to decide in your favor in this case.

We

would not have to say whether or not the West ease should
be overruled or it is going to be overruled.

And certainly

we would not have to reaffirm it in order to decide in your
favor.
MR. DUNCANs

I believe that is correct.

The only

question that I think might foe is whether or not you have
overruled it.

Of course, 1 think respondents

take the

position and the Court of claims takes the position that
this Court has overruled the case- insofar as—
Q

Eroded or undermined if or whatever.

21
MR, DUNCAN:
Q

Y@S, sir.

But nobody claims that it has been expressly

overruled,

MR. DUNCANj

No, that is correct.

And of course

we argued this before the Court of Claims, but they did not
accept this argument.

It is interesting to note that with

regard to this undermining or eroding of the West decision
the Court of Claims also' relied upon a number of cases the
Solicitor General has referred to, including the Internal
Revenue ruling which Oklahoma was not a part to or had no
part in, and which the .State of Oklahoma takes the position
that these ruling-3 by an inferior court cannot in any way,
although they are expressions of an interpretation by that
court or that agency with regard to these ancillary tax
questions, they in and 6£ themselves cannot possibly
overrule a decision of this Court.
Q

All you need to say is that as of the time

this case was heard in the Court of Claims it was a good
law; West was a good law.
MR. DUNCAN:
Q

That is right.

It was the law.

It was the law.

MR. DUNCAN:

Q

Yes, sir.

It was the law of this Court.

MR. DUNCAN:

Q

That is all you have to do.

It was the law.

You do not need any more than that, do you?

22
MR. DUNCAN:
Q

No.-

Do you have, a statute of limitations on

refund of inheritance taxes?
MR. DUNCAN:

Yes, Your Honor, 68-OS, Section 227,

provides for the general time in which a refund can be
claimed.

It is a one-year statute of limitations when it

is a mistake' of law, a question of law, and three years on
a question of fact.
However, there is a provision. Subtitle 2; it
provides that

estate tax must be questioned at the .time of

the payment, and this would fall under that category.

So,

at the time they would have had to have contested under -the
Oklahoma statute at the time that this payment was made.
Q

Is Oklahoma Tax Commission^ ;■/. Tostas: Company

in 336 U.So also involved here, implicated here?
MR. DUNCAN:

Of course, you referred to it in

your opinion in Metcaler© when—although it was not a pert

ORAL ARGUMENT OP CHARLES A. HOBBS, ESQ.,

MR. HOBBS;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
One point brought out by the Solicitor General I
would like to reply to «immediately, and that is, he ref©.;, rad
to the conflict of interest in the Government whan it comes
tc representing questions of Indian rights as are raised in
this case.

Ha said that sometimes it is possible to solve

the problem by reaching an accommodation between the
divergent views of the agencies of Government.

That is &

perfectly correct, tenable way to handle divergencies
among the various agencies which are not. trustees of the
Indians.'

But once you see the Government wearing the hat

6k trustee of the Indians, there is no substitute for a

24
sapar^t® voice cpoo'iing for the Indians.»-

This could be done

by hieing special counsel or it could be done as the
Solicitor General referred as presenting two different views
in one brief, and that was done in the.Stevens case in the
Ninth Circuit last year, one of the most recent cases
construing Capoemn in a ray inconsistent with West.

Q

Does that really solve in a technical sense

the conflict problem?

Because the special counsel would

still foe speaking for the United States, the sante United
States that is trustee; is that not so?
MR. HOBBS;

The same problem occurs in the public

defender area where the Government employs both sides of the
fence there.

But I think we are used to accepting the

divergent loyalty of both sides of the counsel there, and I
think that could grow up with respect to Indian rights.
Our basic thema is that the West case y;as good
law—well, never was good law but was entitled to foe followed
until 1956 when Capo-.-ruan overruled it.

You do

Q

Did the brief ask that, it be overruled?

MR. HOBBS:

I do not know, Your Honor.

It iss my

recollection of a reading some time ago of the brief that
we did not ask that it be overruled, • It was not necessary
to get into that.

It would have been easy to leave that,

for a later day, today.
But. to exclude ray point, we say the;-CSoVermaont
has breached its fiduciary duty by not talcing action after
19:36 to test the validity of .West and see if it still was
good law.

Certainly there were good minds who thought that

it had undermined the West case.

And if the duty did not

accrue then, it certainly accrued at some point over the
years up to the time when it actually paid the tax in this

30

oaae.

There wero sevaa oases decided by the .lower court

the spirit of those cases in the 1930‘s and 1940's which
include West and Oklahoma Tax Coa-uig s lop»

Tray tid not

hole, so out loud, but by comparing the language, it is
perfectly plain that the parallelism was inconsistent.

There

were parallel cases but inconsistent.
Q

1 suppose it would be possible to decide that

the Government perhaps did have an obligating to begin
testing through litigation after 1936, even though this
Court were to decide that West was .still good lew.

There

you would have a breach of duty but no damage resulting
from it.
MR. HOBBSs

Correct.

We would take that position.

The. duty of the Government became more and more pronounced
as the years want on and these lower cases fcspt ticking
off anti-West decisions.

They paid the tax in two bites.

The first bite wac; September, '67.

Then the Bear track

case, which was another case we had brought involving
federal death taxes, which cannot be distinguished from
West, w© is&y? neither can the income tax cases, »e say.
ht any rate, in the Beartrack case the Government
gave up and agreed to a refund, paid the refund, and the
Ink*rnal Revenue.- iJorvice subsequently held that it would
.not collect federal death taxes anymore.

After that, tho

31
Government sti.ll pays Oklahoma tba death tax in this case»
We say by that tins all the halls are ringing and the
watchman should have awakened and done his duty and did not.
But should you find there was no liability for
failure to bring suit and nevertheless reached the West
case in this case, then it is ag-.-arely, brought before you,
we think.

Should you disagree, it will be before you a

couple of years later,

When you decide that West is; no

longer good law, if you do, at that moment the 'Government
.has a duty to file suit for refund.

It can do so.

2fc is

not subject to the Oklahoma statute of limitations.
is settled law.

That

And, therefore, it could go back and

collect all of the refunds that were erroneously paid,
especially erroneously paid after the Capoesaan case.
There it a question as to how much money is
involved here.

We happen to know something about.that»

Oklahoma has a budget.
us a budget.

The Oklahoma stats authorities sent

And for the fiscal year ending IS63,- the

budget would be $1,1 billion.

Of the revenues to cover

that, «even hundred million will ha raised by Oklahoma from
its own sources, and four hundred million

,%/ill be given

to it by tha Federal Government.
Of the seven hundred'million raised by Oklahoma
from its 'own -sources,' largely taxes, $15 million comes from
’ death' tax^s isr* Oklahoma,

of the fifteen-million there is

32

no breakdown to 3!vw how much was Os-ga property.,

But the

Osage agency has advised that

Okleiioraa has been collecting taxes for 24 years.

And sc?

if you assume that the §26,000 a year it sr tttrtgsj, vs
come to $624,000.

'That would be e» total refund of all

estate taxes ever paid.
Q

Would there he other tribes floe ll.a Oso,.go

involved?
MR. HOBBSj

Osage is extremely unique. ' They are

the .only tribe in Oklahoma that still has a reservation.
To me it would not; necessarily be true that other tribes
would have a change in their tax situation.
I have not studied it.

I 'am .not nree.

But Osage is the onlv one with a

reservation in Oklahoma.
I would like to give some of th* hislpxical
background, because I think the Court should have this

The Internal Revenue Service

It is still good law.

It said,- after reviewing the

situation and finding that these properties ware taxable,

"However, should any of these properties not be

That is a rule of leap we say,, that; is still, good.

will show you why in a minute—that the

Osssge property and the Creek property in the other cnsa

Had this Court realised

that: federal taxea would not lie—and it later held that
in C&poeaan—why then it is a fortiori that it would not
have, held that state taxes lie.

It is an error to allow

state taxes if federal taxes do not lie.

Here is what the Court saw in

It saw a governmental under taking-'-when

this tribal property had been broken up and distributed to

This

is vital to'our case

United States, taught to menage Ids own affairb, and

and be as competent as anybody else.
•

In the meantime, this property was to be held in

trust uhdiminishee by any claims.

A simple Indian is$ at

the mercy of loan sharks and speculators who want to buy
his land.

Congress knew this, and so it made the land

inalienable.

No charges or encumbrances wore to be pieced

on this lend.
Q

But this Indian has died.

MR. HOBBS:

Mr, Justice Bl&ckmun, there should

be no question that the death is not significant in the
impact of this tax exemption.

The exemption carries forward,

bridges the death, and goes until the heir becomea
«

competent.

This : s clear from the language of the General

Allotment Act, which says that the United Statos shall hold
this land in trust for the Indian or, in case ha dies, his
heir until he becomes competent.

And it is also expressly

so in the Osage Allotment Act.
In our brief in the footnote on page 11, we cite
four <../ the many references to the concern that Congress
had for the heirs

37
Furthermore, the Wegt and Oklahoma Tax Commission
oases,, when they my, "If this property is exempt from direct
tax, then it Is exempt frora death tax," sort of forecloses
that question, we feel.

We feel that Capoeman has proved

that these properties are exempt from direct faxes and that
therefor© under West and Oklahoma. ‘fax Commlscica,, without
any overruling at all, they are still good law when they
say that therefore no death tax.

So, we do not think that

death is relevant here.
But back to the General Allotment Act.

The

trust relationship, the termination of the trust when the
Indian became competent, the freedom from charge or
-encumbrance, this Court held in Capoetnan, may wall be
sufficient to support the tax exemption.
And then there was more in the Capoeman case.
The General Allotment Act wee passed in 1387.

The

©sages were not allotted—and, incidentally, the ©sages
were left out of the General Allotment Act by a flukeGeneral Allotment Act was supposed to apply to all Zndi
in the country, with a few exceptions.

And those

exceptions were the Indians who held their land in fee.
And the Osages wars believed to own their land in fee
because they were in Oklahoma.
But, v,v like any other tribe i*. Oklahoma . they
did not.

Their i; mcir were in trust.

And therefore the

The

38
Oaages were not under the General Allotment
th.ir Court held that; when the

Acts

In 1903

tv a&r&i Allottves/v Cat .eisafiists

hand fro® levy, attachment. or charge or encumbrance, that
■mea.ro tax exemption.

That woe the

Rickert e;vre in .1903«

The next thing that happens, is- that in 1906
Congress amends the General Allotment Act,, and it says
that—for the first time adds the idea that tb& trust
period earn end sooner than the 25-years extended if the
Indian becomes competent sooner

than, that time,

And it

says that after he reaches the point of competency;. has
trust will end and he gets his land, ©n:5 all res cricti cns
as to alienation and taxation ara lifted.
This implies that Congress thought that the land
was free of tax up to that point end well so,

only C :c»

yearo ago this Supreme Court, in 1903, had hcC.o vcot .
restriction on alienation added up to a tax s:o .yCie-n,.

Co.

Congress' assumed on very good authority in 1906 that the
restriction on alienation was the equivalent of

tax

exemption.
When we come to the Gsag© Allotment Act,, also in ■
1906, we have Congress very much aware of all this ht the
time.

Congress says of the Osage property,

will be.allotted to the individual Osages.

‘The tribal land
They will pick

160.acres of land, and that is. going to be tax exempt."

The rest of tfcai.v Caed, which eetCv-S be ssveral hundred

39
acres, Congress said would foe taxable»

Congests expressly

said that this land -would foe taxable.
The implication is

say the Osage property is taxable, than' it is net.

Whc-n it

came to the minerals, it was not vise just, to divide up
the minerals alone- with the-surface rights.

So, what- they

did was they took the whole mineral estate as if it were a
{

single body or reservation, held it in trust for the Osage
tribe, and allotted the minerals by allotting head rights
to the individual

03ages.

Each hee.d right, just like tlie General Allotment./
Act, was to foe inalienable until the Indian bacizme
competent.

The parallelism is -compelling.
Congress also permitted still another tax.

In

1919, this Court had held that because Congress had not
authorised an Oklahoma gross production tax, no such tax
could lie.

That is an important case.

It is holding that

silence in this context means no taxes»
So, Oklahoma then went to Congress and persuaded
Congress to pass a statute expressly authorising the
Oklahoma gross production tax, and Congress did sc in 1921.
And from that day to this, Congress or Oklahoma -has
collected, and no one has challenged’it, the gross
production tre: on all tb/o !■oaf riohfc m:<.acrj,:cr.„

based on this.

What I meant to say war-

Perhaps.

The state, ir order to tax, jurat, number onef

find jurisdiction? and, number two, must find congressional
intent to permit.

Whereas, in the case of a federal tax

you need only find congressional intent to permit.

You do

not have the jurisdictional problem.
Q

The Court in West said you had to find an

express exemption.
MR. HOBBS;

Capoeman said you did not have to find

an express exemption.
Q

MR. HOBBS s

True.

I would like to make one final quote from the
MsscT&lcro case, which also supports our position.

Where is the jurisdiction to

impose the tax in this case?

Osage is the only reservation

MR. HOBBSs

It is not so alleged.

The Solicitor General suggests that,

that is not -alleged in the record, hut it. is a fact.
Q

If it is not in the record, you can hardly-

in any event, if it is not in the record, it means that
you have not relied on it up till now.
MR. HOBBS:

That is right»

We have not relied

on it.
