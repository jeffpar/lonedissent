MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

first this morning in 71-1417, Booster Lodge tlo. 405 against
the National Labor Relations Board, consolidated with No.
71-1607, National Labor Relations Board against the Boeing
Company.
Mr. Dunau, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF BERNARD DUNAU, ESQ.,
ON BEIIALF OF BOOSTER LODGE NO. 405, ETC.
MR. DUNAU;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
There are two questions in this case.
One, where a union rule prohibits a member from
engaging in strike-making — strikebreaking, may that rule be
thoroughly, reasonably, and validly interpreted to require
that an employee who is a member of the union at the time the
strike began is required to observe the existing union
obligation he had to restrain from strikebreaking for the
duration of that strike notwithstanding his resignation in
the midst of the strike.
The second question we have is whether the Labor
Board is empowered to determine the reasonableness of the size
of a union fine imposed against a member for engaging in
strikebreaking.
These two questions arise in these circumstances;

4
Boeing and Booster Lodge have a collective bargaining
agreement.

It expires on September 15, 1965.

is reached.
18 days.

The next day a strike begins.

No agreement

The strike lasts

On October 3 an agreement is reached; the strike

ends.
There were 1900 employees in the unit that was
struck.

Of these, 143 returned to work during the course of

the strike; 24 never resigned, they retained their membership
throughout the strike, but engaged in strikebreaking; 119
did resign, of these 119, 61 returned to work after their
resignation and 58 returned to work before their resignation.
All, without regard for whether they resigned or
when they returned to work, were found guilty at their internal
union proceedings;

that they had engaged in misconduct in

violation of the Machinists Constitution, which defines as
misconduct of a member, accepted employment in any capacity
in an establishment where a strike or lockout exists, as
recognized under this constitution without permission.
Those accused that appeared for trial apologized
and pledged future loyalty to the Union were in substance
fined fifty percent of their strikebreaking earnings; what
they earned from the struck employer was the measure of their
fine, one-half was the fine.
Those who did not appear for trial and were found
guilty were fined a flat sum of $450.

5
This case came before the National Labor Relations
Board on a complaint which alleged that the imposition of the
fine, which were court collectible, the Union sought the right
to two court proceedings, and did institute court proceedings
to collect these fines.
The claim before the Board was that the imposition
of fines constituted restraint and coercion of the employees
in the exercise of their right to refrain from concerted
activity for mutual aid or protection.
The cMm divided into two parts:

as to those

employees who never resigned; and as to those employees who
resigned but engaged in strikebreaking prior to their
resignation.

It was said that the restraint and coercion

resided in the unreasonableness of the size of the fine.

It

was too large, and therefore it was restraint or coercion.
The Board dismissed that part of the complaint.
It said, given the validity of the Union rule against strike­
breaking, the size of the fine was not its business, it was
the business of a State court on a suit to collect or set
aside that fine; the State court would decide whether or not
the fine was too large.
As to the second claim, the complaint alleged that
those who engaged in post-resignation strikebreaking, no fine
in any amount could be levied against them, and so the
restraint and coercion with respect to people who engaged in

6

post-resignation strikebreaking was that any internal Union
discipline by way of a court collectible fine was of itself
restraint and coercion.
The Board held that it was.
agreed with that determination.

The Court of Appeals

The Court of Appeals disagreed

with the Board's determination that it had no power to
determine the reasonablness of a fine; and both questions are
here on the Union's petition and the reasonableness of fine
issue on the Board's petition as well.
QUESTION:

Mr. Dunau, does the Union have the right

to discharge, dismiss from the membership of the Union an
employee who doesn't pay his fine, or is their only remedy
the power to go into the State courts to collect it?
MR. DUNAUs

With respect to a person who did not

resign, the Union can do a number of things:

it can expel

him? it can fine him and say that the penalty or the sanction
for not paying the fine will be expulsion; or it can do as it
did in Allis-Chalmers, and was validated in Allis-Chalmers,
it can sue in court for the collection of a fine*
With respect to a resigner, it can do virtually the same
things.

It can say:

because you engaged in prior strike­

breaking, you will never again be admitted to membership in
this union.

Or it can say:

we will fine you, and until you

pay that fine, we will never again admit you to membership in
this Union*

Or it can do as it did in this case:

it can sue

7
in court to collect the fine.
How, no one, as I understand it, contests the Union’s
power to debar the fellow who engaged in strikebreaking,
notwithstanding resignation; defining it’s a sanction for
enforcement of a fine as saying, You will pay or never be
readmitted to the Union.

The entire controversy centers here

on the court collectibility of the

fine, and that, it seems

to us, is tiie identical question which was before the Court in
Allis-Chalmers.

The sole difference being that in Allis-

Chalmers, the worker retained his membership; here he resigned
in the course of a strike.
Our question is whether we can have a Union rule which
says, if you are a member and the obligation to refrain from
strikebreaking attached at the commencement of a strike, can
we require, as a condition of resignation, you can resign but
the one obligation you cannot shed by resignation is your
obligation to refrain from strikebreaking for the duration
of the existing controversy.
QUESTIONs

Any —

Mr. Dunau, it may not be important, but

I'm a little fuzzy on one or two facts here.

Do we know

whether each fined member voted in favor of the strike, as
we did in Granite State?
MR. DUNAUs

Ho, sir.

We do not know, and we can

never know, because under the Machinists Constitution the
decision whether or not to go out and strike is taken by

8
secret ballot.

At the time this strike was called, it

required a three-quarter vote in favor of the strike, by
secret ballot, and the whole notion of a secret ballot is
that we shall not know who voted for or against the strike.
*

QUESTION*

Does the record show whether each person

fined her© initially participated in the strike?
MR. DUNAU;

I believe the

record will show that,

Your Honor.
Well, now I have to withdraw that.

I think the

record will show that most did, I'm not sure whether all of
them did.

There may be a handful who returned to work on the

first day of the strike, but without checking the record more
closely than I now have a recollection of, I could not say.
But most of them did go out and then resign in the
course of the strike.

But I cannot say whether all participated

in it.
QUESTION:

One last question.

I take it it does

show the date of the respective resignations?
MR. DUNAU*

Yes, sir, it will show when the letter

of resignation was sent.

It may show when it was received.

The Board holds that resignation is effective i^jon the Union's
receipt of the letter of resignation.
I don't think there's any question about the
operative fact, namely, that as to a substantial number they
engaged in strikebreaking prior to resignation — as to a

9
substantial number, they engaged in strikebreaking only after
their resignation was effective.
Now, we have a preliminary question in this case, of
i

the interpretation of the provision in the Union Constitution
barring strikebreaking.
from strikebreaking.

It says that a member shall refrain

It doesn't say what happens when,

in the course of a strike, a member

resigns.

You have two ways, one has two ways that one can
interpret that prohibition.

It can say, one can say that a

member is barred from strikebreaking notwithstanding
resignation; or one can say a member is barred from strike­
breaking except following resignation.
As between those two interpretations of a Union
prohibition against strikebreaking, it seems to us at least
fair and reasonable to say, given the fact that it is a Union
prohibition against strikebreaking, given the fact that the
whole purpose of a rule against strikebreaking is to keep a
man from returning to work during the course of a strike, that
the fair and reasonable interpretation of that rule is that
it means that a member who was a member when the strike began
is required to refrain from strikebreaking for the duration
of that controversy*
QUESTION:
review here?

Mr, Dunau, what is the nature of our

I take it the Board found against you on that,

and the Court of Appeals found against you on that*

Is it

10

simply a preponderance of the evidence?

Would you have to

show that there was no substantial evidence to support that#
or do you treat it as a conclusion of law?

How do we get at

it?
MR. DUNAUj

I suppose# since the Board tells us that

what it is doing is interpreting a contract# and the
conventional formulation as I understand it is that the
interpretation of a contract is supposed to be a question of
law open to unrestricted judicial review# that we are free
here to decide whether the Union's Constitution is fairly and
reasonably interpreted to bar strikebreaking.
None of us have focused on Your Honor's precise
question# namely, given the Board's interpretation# what
is the scope of judicial review with respect to that
interpretation.

And I suppose that none of us have focused

on it because the Board has never said that this is not a
fair and reasonable interpretation of the Union prohibition.
What it has said is that you cannot have such an interpreta­
tion.

That the Union's authority over a member is limited to

the time that he was a member, and that# ipso facto# once he
resigns, the Union's authority over him is at an end.
If that is correct, if that is the way they read
any Union Constitution# as I read their decision# if that is
correct# one never reaches a question of how do you interpret
this prohibition# no matter how reasonably and fairly it is

11
interpreted as a matter of reading the prohibition, you cannot
have that interpretation because there is a superseding,
according to the Board, rule of contract law that the authority
of the Union over the member ceases on resignation? hence,
this rule, even were it explicit, as explicit as the Machinists
made it. in September 1972, when it amended this prohibition,
to

tate, in turn:
"Resignation shall not relieve a member of his

obligation to refrain from accepting employment at the
establishment for the duration of the strike or lockout if
the resignation occurs during the period of the strike or
lockout or within 14 days preceding its commencement."
That gives, us •— no one — any problems of inter™
pretation; it is now absolutely explicit.
As I read the Board's decision, they will say:

As

a matter of contract law you cannot have that kind of
restriction, because your authority over the member ceases
with the resignation; therefore, there can be no post­
resignation implication of continuing obligations to perform
any part of the Union obligation.

And it is that on which

this litigation has centered as a matter of how do you read a
Union Constitution?

Do you say that once resignation occurs,

every obligation, ipso facto, stops?

If that is the way you

read it, then our prohibition cannot apply.
QUESTION:

It's also a definition of the word

12
"member", isn’t it?

Once you resign, you're not a member,

you're a former member.
MR. DUNAUs Which presents the problem whether you
are — if you are a former member — or put it, rather, this
ways

if during the period of membership, if the condition of

acquiring and retaining membership is that on resignation a
particular obligation will endure beyond your resignation,
can tli at be interpreted —
QUESTION: Beyond your membership.
MR. DUNAU:

Yes.

— beyond your membership, can a

particular Union obligation subsist beyond your membership.
The Board says no as a matter of contract law.
We think that has to be wrong as a matter of contract law.
Because if it is not wrong as a matter of contract law, we
could not, in September '72, have amended our constitution
to say that:

following resignation, nevertheless the

obligation to refrain from strikebreaking shall subsist.

It

seems to us that as a matter of how one reads the relation­
ship of a member to a union, it was said as well as I know it,
in Section 65(3) of the British Industrial Relations Act of
1971:

"Every member of the organization shall have the

right, on giving reasonable notice and complying with any
reasonable conditions, to terminate his membership of the
organization at any time."
We are saying that a reasonable condition on resigna-

13

tion is that a fellow who is a member of the Union at the time
the strike began shall, for the duration of that strike,
respect his obligation that he had to refrain from strikebreak­
ing.
QUESTION*

Regardless of how long the strike goes

MR, DUNAUs

Yes, sir, regardless of how long the

on?

strike goes on, because the whole notion, it seems to us, of
strike solidarity is that the majority decides when to strike
and the majority decides when to stop striking, and that the
whole point of strike solidarity and concerted activity for
mutual aid and protection is that the unit as a unit determines
its destiny for good or ill, not any individual.
QUESTION*

But that was the rationale of, what was

it, the First Circuit in Granite State, and that was rejected
by this Court last December, wasn't it?
MR, DUNAU:
it, which said*
Union rule.

On a basis of decision, as we understand

we reject that where there is no limiting

We take it to mean, therefore, that when the

Court decided to hear this case on the resignation issue, it
wanted to decide a question of what do you do when there is an
existing Union rule; and that is what we have in this case.
We have a rule against strikebreaking, which we
think are reasonably and fairly interpreted to bar resignation
— not to bar resignation, to bar strikebreaking

by a resigner

14
for the duration of the existing controversy.

What he does

in any future controversy, we cannot treat him in any way
except as a man on the street? but when we have a rule that
says that for the duration of an existing strike you will
respect the obligation you undertook as a member, that we
think was the question reserved in Granite State, that we
think is the question which is presented here.
And with respect to —
QUESTION:

Would you make any distinction, Mr.

Dunau, between members of unions who are members as a matter
of compulsion and those who are members as a matter of choice?
MR. DUNAU:

We make no such distinction, Your Honor.

In this case it happens that every member was a
member by choice, because the collective bargaining agreement
explicitly stated that every non-member could join or could
not join the union as he saw fit; every person on employment
was told, you have a free choice to join or not to join;
therefore, every one who joined joined because he wanted
membership.
But that is this case.

We make no distinction

with respect to employees who are required under a union
security agreement to acquire membership, even they are
voluntary members in the sense of being full members,
because all a union security agreement can do is obligate
the person to pay his union dues and initiation fees, every

15
other obligation of membership is his to acquire if he wants
it, there is no compulsion on him to acquire that membership.
QUESTION? Well, can he be a member but reject this
provision with reference to strikebreaking?
MR. DUNAU?

If the Union is willing to enforce

against him the obligation of a contract to pay his dues and
fees, that is the limit of it.

If the Union is willing to say,

Okay, we will take you only on that basis, the Union can do
that.

Or it can say to the fellow, You will become, a full

member or not be a member at all.

In that event, he doesn't

even pay union dues or initiation fees.
But it is his choice as to whether he adopts the
full obligation to Union membership or does not.
QUESTION?

Do you define those who resign, to use

your phrase, as men in the street?
MR. DUNAU:

I don't know what the usual phrase means,

Your Honor.
QUESTION?
men in the street.

You said that he's just like any other
These men who resign, are they in that

category so far as the Union is concerned?
MR* DUNAU?

So far as the Union is concerned, once

they resign, subsequent to the termination of that strike,
they are like any other member in the street, indeed in this
case —
QUESTION: Except that they can't work.

16

MR. DUNAUs They cannot work for that employer for
the duration of the strike.
QUESTIONj But the man in the street can, is that it?
MR. DUNAU:

You're correct.

QUESTION: As any other man in the street can?
MR. DUNAU:

That is the price difference, Your Honor,

between being a Union member subject to the obligations of
the Union membership and not being a Union member.
QUESTION:

He's not really a member, he's a former

member.
MR. DUNAU:

He was a former member, and the question

here is whether we can bind a former member for the duration
of a strike to his obligation to refrain from strikebreaking.
Under the Machinists Constitution it takes a three-quarters
majority vote to call a strike.

If you want to terminate the

strike, it takes a majority vote of the people who are
participating in the strike.

That we think is the democratic

means by which we achieve both freedom and unity.
The majority rules.
QUESTION:

Is the termination vote a secret vote,

too?
MR. DUNAU:
138 of the record:

Yes, Your Honor.

It appears on page

"A proposal to settle or declare off an

existing strike must be presented at a regular or called
meeting of a local lodge, or a meeting of the members

17
affected (as the case may be), and decided by majority vote,
by secret ballot, of the members involved."
How, the Executive Council of the Union, of the
International Union, reserve the authority to discontinue a
strike notwithstanding the wishes of the employees; but their
authority is limited to saying;

If we think this strike

should be over, we will stop paying strike benefits.

But they

cannot otherwise affect the continuation of the strike.
But the men themselves can call it off by a
majority vote, by secret ballot.
Now, if we are right, that we can interpret our
prohibition against strikebreaking, to pertain to find a
member who resigns, and it*s for the duration of the strike,
and if we are right that as a matter of contract law, the
association of law;

An association, a labor organization,

any voluntary association can reasonably condition the
circumstances under which resignation can be effectuated;
we have only one other question left in this case:

Is it

a violation of Section 8(b)(1)(A) for a Union expressly or
impliedly to say that a fellow who is a member when the
strike begins will stay — will respect his obligation to
refrain from strikebreaking?
As to that, I think the best place to begin is the
wording of the proviso themselves, the proviso excludes from
restraint or coercion, this paragraph shall not affect the

18

right of a labor organization to prescribe its own rules with
respect to the acquisition or retention of membership»
And when we say that the condition of resignation
is that you will refrain from strikebreaking for the duration
of the existing strike, that is a rule with respect to the
acquisition or retention of membership. That is all it is.
And that is expressly reserved to the Union and carves out
from any notion of restraint or coercion.
'• QUESTION:

Now, you are placing this, as X take it,

as a matter of contract law?
MR. DUNAU:

No, sir. At this point I'm placing it

as a matter of what the statute allows us to do.

If, as a

matter of contract law, we cannot do it, then that is a
question of our lack of authority under State law to have
this kind of a restriction.
QUESTION;

Well, is it not the combination of the

section of the statute you just referred to and the contract
that's made pursuant to that?

That is, when the man joined

the Union, he has a contract obligation — at least I have
understood that to be your argument — a contract obligation
to comply with those provisions of the Union about not
breaking the strike,
MR. DUNAUs

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

So that has it been not — coming back

to my original question — at least a combination of the

19
statute and the contract made pursuant to that statute?
MR» DUIIAU8

Yes.

And if one wants to look at it

that way, the first question we have to answer is:

Do we have,

with respect to the contract between the Union and the member,
a contract which says that the member on resignation will
refrain from strikebreaking?
If we have that, the next question is:

Is there

anything in the National Labor Relations Act which bars that
kind of a contractual restriction, that kind of a contract;
and for us the answer seems to be right in the words of the
proviso, namely, that we can prescribe our own rules with
respect to acquisition or retention of membership.
It seems also to us to be quite in keeping with the
rationale of Allis-Chalmers, with the whole notion of union
solidarity, namely, that the reason you can collect, impose a
court collectible fine against a member for engaging in strike­
breaking is that that is necessary in order to maintain the
cohesion of the Union as an affective organization, as an
organization which can prosecute strikes; that is the whole
meaning of majority rule, centering your economic power so
that the majority controls.
If, in order to further that end, we can impose a
court collectible fine against a member, what is the difference
in rationale, in terras of preserving strike solidarity when
we are reaching out for the defector; either case, whether he's

20
a resigner, a strikebreaker, or a resigner member.

Our

concern is identical, namely, that a fellow who is a member
when he starts out on this enterprise shall at least respect
his obligation to refrain from strikebreaking,
QUESTIONs

Well, if this is the rule, then, as to

acquisition or retention of membership, to us the statutory
language, then what we're really on to is that you cannot
resign during a strike?
MR. DUNAU:

No.

QUESTION:

That's what it has to do with; it

doesn't have anything to do with acquisition or retention of
membership,
MR, DUNAU:

It means that you can resign.

QUESTION:

Well, then, —

MR, DUNAU:

But that obligation of membership

which inheres in being a member you cannot shed.
same thing —
QUESTION:

It's the

• *<•I have very great difficulty in seeing

what that has to do with acquisition or retention of membership,
within the meaning of the statute.
Unless

unless you argue that what you may say is,

that you cannot resign during a strike.
MR. DUNAU:

Well, —

QUESTION: Which would have to do with acquisition or
retention of membership

21
MR. DUNAU:

We are putting it, then, the same thing,

I think, in inverse order.

You are free to resign every

obligation of membership except that which inhered in
respecting your obligation to refrain from strikebreaking; or
if one wants to put it the other way, if one wants to say
that you cannot resign during a strike, then surely one can
say you can resign during a strike but you cannot shed that
part of your obligation which —
QUESTIONi The greater includes the less*
MR. DUNAUs

The greater includes the less.

If we

can say you cannot resign at all, we can surely say you can
resign but you're required to observe the pre-existing
obligation to refrain from strikebreaking.
QUESTION: Would this apply in the situation where a
member is — this is outside of this case, of course — where
a member is permitted not to join the union if he pays the
equivalent in a contribution for dues, he then has no
obligation wider the constitution, I take it?
MR. DUNAUs

That's correct.

If the only thing that

he's undertaking to do is to pay his union dues and fees, he
has not undertaken any obligation of union membership, and
therefore we cannot enforce against him any obligation of
union membership.
So that the fellow who wants, in the words used in
Allis-Chalmers, who wants to be a limited member, to pay only

22
dues and fees, as to that kind of a fellow, the union has no
claim with respect to his fealty, he has not undertaken any
obligation of union membership, he can engage in strikebreaking
to a fare-thee-well because he has not undertaken to refrain
from strikebreaking,
QUESTION*

Bo employees have that option under

this contract?
MR, DUNAUs

Under this contract they have the option

not to join at all, if they join they have the option that
every member in this country has, every employee, to pay only
dues and fees and undertake no other obligation of union
membership.
Now, that did not happen in this case.

There is

nothing in this case to show that every employee who joined
did not join and become a full member.
But anyone who wants to limit his obligation is
free, under the statutes of this country, to limit his
obligation. The Union, in turn, is free to say*
don't want limited members.

Sorry, we

In which case, that person pays

neither dues nor undertakes any other obligation.
But if the Union says, We want your money, but you
don't have to have any other obligation of membership, that
is possible.

And what is obviously the most overwhelming

situation in this country is that the person who pays his
dues also acquires full union membership; in that event we

23
think he is subject to the entirety of union obligation and
that means, we think, that for the duration

of an existing

strike, he’s required to refrain from strikebreaking.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Thank you, Mr. Dunau.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NORTON J. COME, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD
MR, COME:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the
V

Courts
The Board is in the middle in thi9 case, in the
sense that we agree with the Union that the reasonableness
of the fines that were levied on members is not for the Board
but for the State court.
But we agree with the company that, with respect to
the fines that were imposed on the resignees being violative
of 8(b) (1) (A).
Let me turn to that issue first.

We’re now talking

about the fines that were levied on employees who resigned
from the Union for work done after their resignation.

We

believe that Granite State, which this Court decided in
December, requires the conclusion that those fines violate
Section 8(b)(1)(A) of the Act.

In Granite State, the Court

held that the Union’s authority to impose a court collectible
fine on a member for a breach of a valid Union rule is co­
terminus with the contract of membership between the Union and

24
its members, and thus when a member lawfully resigns and
thereafter engages in conduct which the rule proscribes, the
Union commits a violation of 8(b)(1)(A) to levy a court
enforcible fine on him.
Finding no provision in the Union’s Constitution or
By-laws which limited the circumstances under which a member
could resign, the Court in Granite State concluded that the
Union members were free to resign at will* and that their
right thereafter to return to work was protected by Section
7 of the Act, which gives the employees, including Union
members, not only the right to engage in Union activities,
but the right to refrain from engaging in such activity.
♦

Now, the Board: found here, and the court below
agreed, the Union's Constitution and By-laws in the present
case, like those in Granite State, contain no express
provision limiting the circumstances under which a member
could voluntarily resign from the Union.

And Union Business

Agent Higgins confirmed this at page 111 of the Appendix,
when he pointed out that there was no provision in the union's
Constitution whereby a man could resign by letter.

The only

way that he could resign was involuntarily, in the sense that
if he fell in arrears in his dues the Union could suspend
him, or he could get a withdrawal card if he left the industry,
or by death.
But there was no provision by which he could volun-

25
tarily resign.

And, as a matter of fact, consistent with that,

the Union, as Higgins acknowledges in his testimony, ignored
the letters of resignation when they came in, treated these
employees who sought to resign just as though they continued
to remain members of the Union.
Now, the Union contends, however, that unlike in
Granite State here they have a constitutional provision
which obligates a former member notwithstanding his resigna­
tion to refrain from abandoning a strike which was called while
he was a member.
Now, whether or not a constitutional provision which
expressly prohibited a member from resigning during a strike
or which expressly committed him to adhere to a strike,
notwithstanding a mid-strike resignation, would be valid for
purposes of

—

QUESTION: The Board, I gather, hasn't dealt with
this?
MR. COME: The Board has not passed on that question,
and we do not think that it is presented in this case. That
will be the third case, Your Honors, after this case and
Granite State.
QUESTION:
MR. COME:

Then it may come up under the —
— new constitutional provision of the

Machinists contract, which, being enacted in 1972, obviously
could not have served notice on the employees here in 1965

26
that this was the obligation that they were assuming when they
joined the Machinists in 1965.
QUESTION:

Of course the Court in Granite State

spoke generally of a constitutional provision, did it not?
Generally.
MR. COME: That is correct, Your Honor.
However, let's take a look at this constitutional
provision here, which is set forth at page 142 or 143 of the
Appendix.
It talks about improper conduct of a member.
says:

It

"The following actions or omissions shall constitute

misconduct by a member", and then you get down to "Accepting
employment in any capacity in an establishment where a strike
or lockout exists".
On its face, this provision is applicable only to
a member, it does not provide that the obligation to refrain
from strikebreaking continues, even after the member has
resigned from the Union, nor is there any indication that the
Union ever informed its members that it interpreted this
provision as being applicable even after the member resigned,
nor is there any indication that the employees ever thought
when they joined the Union that they were buying this kind of
an obligation.
As I indicated earlier, the Union simply ignored the
letters of resignation, because in its view you couldn't resign

27
from this Union.

As a matter of fact, it was not until after this
Court decided Granite State that the Union began to really
argue that it had a specific provision in its constitution
which obligated a member to refrain from strikebreaking even
after he resigned from the Union.

Because if you look at the

Union's petition, at page 12 in the case, the issue which the
Union poses in the petition is whether a member is bound for
the duration of the strike by the group decision to strike,
irrespective of whether he was individually opposed to that
group decision.
And the distinction that they try to draw between this
case and Granite State was that in Granite State you could
show that each of the employees individually voted to strike,
whereas here, since there was a secret ballot to strike,
you couldn't show that they, that each one voted; but,
nonetheless, whether he voted for it or not, he was bound by
the group decision to strike.
What was the reason for this?

The reason was

because, in a strike situation, it is only reasonable, in
view of the reliance factor that each employee that goes to
strike depends upon the support of his fellow employees, it's
only reasonable, in view of the reliance consideration, to
imply a commitment on the part of one and all to see the
strike through

28
Now, that's essentially the very same sort of
reliance consideration which this Court in Granite State said
is not enough to constitute a waiver of the employee's
Section 7 right to forego abandoning the strike if he finds
that he cannot stick it out.
Now, there are sound reasons for this Court's
Granite State view, which I submit is controlling here.

The

basic reason is that Section 7 of the Act gives the employees
the right to resign from the Union and thereby avoid Union
obligations; and a waiver or qualification of a statutory
right must be clear and unmistakable.
The contract between the member and the Union, the
Union Constitution, is analogous to a contract of adhesion,
in the sense that the member really has no choice as to the
terms that are presented and therefore if he is going to be
deemed to have waived his Section 7 rights, the provisions of
the constitution or the by-laws must be clear and unmistakable.
We submit, from the terms that I read to you, that
r*

is not the situation here.
And thirdly, there is the consideration that this
Court pointed out in Granite State.

Events after the calling

of a strike may have unsettling effects, leading a member who
voted to strike to change his mind.
We submit that a member should not be deemed as
giving up his freedom to protect against the serious hardship,

29
unless, at least, there is clear evidence that he knowingly
waived that right.
We submit that on this record the Board and the court
below were justified in finding that there had not been such
waiver.
Now, with respect to the fines that were levied on
the members who either did not resign from the Union or that
portion of the fines that are allocable to the pre-resignation
work activity of those who did resign, we submit that those
fines are not violative of Section 8(b)(1)(A) on the
authority of this Court's decision in Allis-Chalroers♦
To be sure, the fines in Allis-Chalmers were conceded
to be reasonable in amount, so, therefore, this Court did not
specifically pass upon the reasonableness point that we have
presented in this case, but we submit that the logic and
reasoning of the Court's decision in Allis-Chalmers supports
the Board's conclusion that the reasonableness of the amount
of the fine is not a matter for the Board but for the State
court.

It does not go to the question as to whether or not

the fines which, apart from reasonableness, would not violate
8(b) (1) (A) are brought within the ban of 8(b) (1) (A) .
QUESTION*

Do you have any idea of what percentage

of these situations are dealt with in the suit in the State
court as compared with making reinstatement in the Union
conditioned upon payment of the fine?

30

In other words, in most of the situations, does not
the Union simply says
your fine.

If you want to be reinstated, you pay

And therefore there is no State court jurisdiction

action in most of them; or is that evaluation wrong?
MR. COME; Well, I think that court collectible
fines are not the major form of Union discipline.
QUESTION: As a practical matter, why would a Union
go to the trouble of bringing an action in the State court
when they have such a simple remedy for collection, namely,
to say We won't reinstate you until you pay the fine.

No

lawyer's fees, no delay, no problem.
That's really a hypothetical route, isn't it?
MR. COME:

No, it's not a hypothetical route, because

there are enough of the cases so that you cannot say that it
is an academic matter, and as this Court pointed out in AllisChalmers, with respect to some unions where membership rights
don't mean very much, expulsion is not a very effective
remedy for breach of a union rule*
So I can't say that it is an academic matter,
although it is not the major form of discipline.
QUESTION: What if the union rules required a fine of
five times the amount of wages earner, would you think the
Board should not concern itself with that?
That's hypothetical, of course, because no union
does so.

But I'm addressing to the point you make in your

31

argument.
MR. COME: The Board's position is that Congress did
not give it that power.

Now, it might make good policy for

the Board to handle it, but this is a judgment that —
QUESTION:

Mr. Come, didn't we, at the time Allis-

Chaimers was argued, am I not right there was an amicus who
argued in connection with a fine of $20,000 —
MR. COME: That is correct.

There was an amicus

brief that was filed by, I think, someone in the entertainment
field, that was bringing to the Court's attention a fine of
that amount.
But let me explain briefly why I think the Congress,
at least up to now, has kept the Board out of this field.
Of course Congress is free to amend the statute if it wants
to change its mind on this score,
QUESTION: So that it's your position, then, that it
is a matter of power not of expertise in the Board?
MR. COME: That is correct.
QUESTION:

I think that —

You feel the Board could handle this if

it had the power so to do?
MR. COME: Well, I think that the courts are more
expert in this matter than the Board, because they have been
handling it for years.

It also turns on the kind of equitable

considerations that the courts are better equipped to handle
than the Board

32

But — so from that standpoint I think that the
courts are better suited to it.

I don't want to say that

it’s impossible for the Board to handle this thing, because
we all know that there is a genuis in administrative
innovation; if we had to deal with it, we'd have to assume
the burden.
But I believe that Congress kept the Board out of it
because — for several reasons, one of which is that they
thought that the courts were better equipped to handle it.
QUESTION:

Now, Mr. Come, the only reason, as I

understand it, that these fines are alleged to be unreasonably
high is that they violate 8(b)(1)(A) of the Act,

Isn't that

right?
MR. COME:
QUESTION:

That is correct, sir.
Now, what criteria would you suppose

that a State court would apply in gauging the reasonableness
vel non of these fines?
The criterion is whether or not — the whole claim
is that they were so unreasonable that they violated 8(b)(1)(A)
of the National Labor Relations Act as amended; and doesn't
the Labor Board know a good deal more about that Act than your
— than the mine-run of State trial courts?
MR. COME: That is correct if the question were whether
it was a violation of 8(b) (1) (A) , —
QUESTION:

Well, that is the only question, isn't it?

33

MR, COME;

But if I am correct in my submission,

that Congress did not intend the reasonableness of the amount
of a court collectible fine to be a relevant consideration in
determining whether the fine is violative of 8(b)(1)(A), then
the fact that it is unreasonable in amount doesn’t make it
violate 8(b)(1)(A), it may violate —
QUESTION:
MR. COME;

What?
— State common law —

QUESTION: What possibly could it violate in the law,
if, after due process, the Union procedure, the fine of X
dollars was levied, and under Allis-Chalroers that can be
collected in a State court; what possible criterion could a
State apply to fay it's unreasonable, when the only claim
that’s ever been made in this case is that it is unreasonable
by reason of, and only by reason of, 8(b)(1)(A) of the
National Labor Relations Act, as amended?
MR. COME:

But if — if we are sustained in our

view that this does not violate 8(b)(1)(A), it will then have
to go to the State court —
QUESTION:

Under what criterion? What will they

be asked to apply to measure whether it’s reasonable or
unreasonable?

There's no claim that it's unreasonable except

in terms of 8(b)(1)(A).
MR. COME; Well, but the defense that the employees
are, will be asserting in the State court cases, or suits that

34

have been brought to collect the fine, will weigh the issue
that the fine is inequitable or usurious or unreasonable, under
the State -QUESTION: This has nothing to do with usury.
MR, COME: All I know, Your Honor, is that there are a
number of State court cases in which the question of the
unreasonableness of the fine has been raised as a defense to
the suit to collect the fine —
QUESTION:

I know, but what is there, what measure

is the court — we’re assuming by hypothesis, by assumption,
that it was a due process, union, internal union procedure
that resulted in the imposition of a fine of X dollars.

The

only attack upon its amount has been under the Act, under the
Act.
Now, the State court is not, certainly with all the
pre-emption cases on this book, you say a State court has
the expertise to decide that question under the Act, and that
the Labor Board does not,
MR, COME:

Your Honor, I hate to be repeating myself,

but —
QUESTION: Well, I’m repeating myself, too.
MR. COME:

I submit that the State court would not

be deciding this question under the Act,
QUESTION: Well, what would it be deciding it under,
then?

35

MR. COMEs

It would be deciding whether or not to

fine a man, to use the Chief Justice's example, five times his
M» «•»

QUESTION:

His what?

MR. COME:

"" strike earnings, violates —

QUESTION: What?
MR. COME:
QUESTION:

Violates what?

— State law.
Would it take into consideration its

own notions of labor policy in making that determination?
MR. COME:

With respect to this issue, it would, if

it is not a matter for the Board to consider under Section
8(b)(1)(A) of the statute.
QUESTION:

I'm finding it hard to square with

prior arguments the Board has made on pre-emption in this
Court.

When we have State courts undertaking to restrain a

union on even grounds that it's necessary to control violence
and damage to property, the Board, I thought, consistently
takes the position that the Congress has pre-empted this
whole relationship.
MR, COME:

Not with respect to violence, Your Honor.

It depends upon whether or not —
QUESTION: We are confronted with the arguments
frequently, even in claims of violence.
MR, COME:

Well, let me see if I can just outline

very briefly that considerations that we think lead to the

36
conclusion that we do not have power to get into the
reasonableness of the amount of the fine»
This Court recognized in Allis-Chalmers that the
Taft-Hartley prohibitions against restraint and coercion had
to be interpreted in the light of the repeated refrain through­
out the debates on 8(b)(1)(A) and other sections, that
Congress did not propose any limitations with respect to the
internal affairs of unions.

Aside from barring enforcement

of union's internal regulations with respect to it.
QUESTION;

Well, I know, Mr, Come, but didn’t we

also say# and I'm looking at 195 of the Allis-Chalmers opinion,
whether 8(b)(1)(A) proscribes arbitrary imposition of fines
for punishment of disobedience of a fiat of the union leader
are matters not presented by this case upon which to express
those views.
Didn't we put to one side, perhaps, the very
question that's presented in this case?
MR. COME*

I thought I indicated that the Court did

not decide that question.

I'm just trying to show you —

explaining why —
QUESTION*

Well, perhaps then I misunderstood.

I

thought the Board was relying primarily on Allis-Chalmers, in
its recorded position.
MR, COME; Well, we're relying on the reasoning of
Allis-Chalmers.

The fine in Allis-Chalmers was conceded to be

37
reasonable in amount.
QUESTION:

You did not have that problem.
Well, that suggests, by the use of the

word "reasonable” —
MR. COME!

Yes„

QUESTION:

— perhaps suggested that if it were

unreasonable we might have a different case under 8(b)(1)(A).
MR. COME:

You left it open, as we read it.

I'd like

to explain why the considerations that were advanced in Allis»»
Chalmers however would lead to the same conclusion with
respect to the open question.
Now, the fines here were levied for breach of a
union rule against strikebreaking, a rule which the Court, in
Allis-Chalmers, said was not only to serve a legitimate union
interest but was compatible with the policy of the National
Labor Relations Act,
They were imposed for working while the employees
were members of the Union, so you don't have the Granite State
problem that you have on the first part of this case.

They

were not sought to be enforced by unacceptable means, namely,
violence or affecting the man's job rights.

The only means

used was a court suit, a means which the Court in Allis-Chalmers
and in Scofield recognized was a legitimate means; and which,
we submit, will provide the member a full opportunity to
contest the reasonableness of the fine.
Now, to require the Board to determine whether the

38

amount of the fines is reasonable would bring it inevitably
deeply into the area of internal union affairs, much more
deeply than Congress entered with Landrum-Griffin, because
in Landrum-Griffin, in 1959, they enacted a provision that
said that you can fine and suspend and expel a member, and
enacted only procedural safeguards that limits the use of
that power.
Now, the court below here, at 29-A of the Appendix,
directed the Board to take into account such factors as:
the compensation received by the strikebreakers? the level of
strike benefits made available to the striking employees? the
individual needs of the person being disciplined? the detri­
mental effects of the strikebreaking upon the effectiveness
of the strike effort? the length of time of the work stoppage?
the strength of the particular union involved? the availability
of other less harsh union remedies? and other similar
considerations.

And the court —

QUESTION:

No matter what you're saying, I gather,

Mr. Come, that Congress wanted the Board to stay out of the
internal affairs of the unions —
MR. COME: That's correct,
QUESTION:

— and to get into the question of the

reasonableness of the fine is to get your neck into the
question of internal union affairs, and that violates the
congressional policy?

39

MR, COME; That is correct, Your Honor.
QUESTION: But it’s all right for a State court to
get an arm into that?
MR. COME: Because Congress, and this Court too, in
both All is-“Chalmers and Scofield, pointed out that the extent
that Congress has not gotten into this area, and it was a very
limited intrusion, the matter of union discipline is a matter
for the State court, where it was traditionally and has been
traditionally handled.
So we have a very —
QUESTION:

So the State courts often, when they

thought the union membership discipline was too harsh, they've
taken steps to set it aside, is that it?
MR. COME: That is correct, Your Honor.

And I

submit that if you get in on the reasonableness of the fine,
there's no way that you can rationally stop getting — having
the Board inquire into the fairness of the procedure followed
in imposing the fine.

You have to get into questions as to

whether or not the member should have exhausted his union
remedy, which gets you even further into internal union
democracy.

And it is -QUESTION:

Yes, Mr. Come, in this case, as I recall,

the trial examiner did determine what he thought were factors
entering into the reasonableness of these fines*

Did he not?

MRi COME* The trial examiner did, and he came up with

40

the conclusion that a fine that was more than 35 percent of
straight-time earnings and more than 80 percent of overtime
earnings would be unreasonable.

And the Board, of course, did

not pass on the propriety of his evaluation, because they
found that they were not empowered to do so.
But I submit that examining his opinion indicates
perhaps better than anything else the reason as to why this
matter should be left in the first instance to the State
courts, because to come up with a standard is going to be
very likely to give you a situation that is divorced from the
realities of the particular strike situation.
He made the judgment, for example, that the fine
had to be left in total deterrent.
essence of

Now, these are the very

internal union democracy.

Whether forgiveness

should be a factor, the union here, for example, reduced the
$450 fine to 50 percent of strikebreaking earnings, which
the court below found was reasonable.
For those who appeared and begged forgiveness, as
it were, whether there’s a particular hardship that warrants
special adjustment, these are things that have to be handled
on a case-by-case basis and to promulgate a broad rule, we
submit, bears little relation to reality.
QUESTION:

Mr. Come, if it appeared, and apparently

we haven't anything in this record and perhaps none of us has
any means of knowing at this time; but if it appeared that

41
80 to 90 percent of all the fines were collected by a
restriction that there would be no reinstatement to the Union
member to membership until he paid his fine, leaving only 10
percent or so to collection in the State courts, then all this
discussion about State courts recedes in importance, doesn't
it?
Because in the 80 to 90 percent of the hypothetical
situation no one is reviewing the reasonableness.
MR. COME:

Oh, I don't — I wouldn't agree with

that, Your Honor, because I think that even where the only
penalty is expulsion from the Union, or suspension from Union
membership for failure to pay the fine, you will find suits
where the individual would contest the reasonableness of the
fine or the fairness of the —
QUESTION: Where would he contest it?
MR, COME:

In the State court, because it would be

his —
QUESTION: Well, I’m thinking of —
MR. COME:

— if he's being deprived of his member­

ship in the Union, that is a valuable right that in many cases
may affect his job, and I didn't mean to suggest that the only
court suits attacking the fairness of union discipline are
those where the union seeks to enforce a fine, as in suits
to contest other forms of discipline as well,
QUESTION:

Mr, Come, you said a moment ago that you

42

thought this matter should be left in the first instance to
the State courts.

That suggests there is a second instance

somewhere else.
MR. COME:

If I did, Your Honor, I misspoke myself?

I meant to say in the first instance to the union, in the
sense that they would be empowered, I believe, to require
exhaustion of internal union remedies.

Then if —* after those

had been exhausted, the court would have the right to review
what the union has done,
QUESTION»

But the question of exhaustion, I take it,

would be a matter of State law? is that it?

If the State

didn't want to follow that doctrine, it xvouldn’t have to?
MR, COME: That is correct? that is correct.
QUESTION:

Mr. Come, is it, then, basically your

position that an extremely high fine, an unreasonably high
fine, however one might define it, let's begin with the
supposition it's an unreasonably high fine, would simply not be
a violation of 8<b) (1) (A) ? is that it?
MR. COME:

Yes, Your Honor.

Yes, Your Honor.

And I would like to point out, if I may —
QUESTION:

$100,000 fine on somebody who worked for

two days would simply -- would not be a violation of anything
in the National Labor Relations Act? is that your position?
MR. COME:

Yes, it is, Your Honor.

And I'd like to, if I might, — I know I'm going

43

over for a moment — point out that everyone seems to agree
that if that $1G,000 fine were merely enforced by suspension
or expulsion from union membership, the proviso of Section
8(b)(1)(A) would clearly take it outside of the
QUESTION:

Of acquisition or retention?

MR. COMEj

That is correct.

So that the only point

for bringing the Board into the picture is because it's going
to be court enforcible, and that is the point at which the
court, I submit, certainly has more expertise than the Board
has to do it,
QUESTION;

But I still do not —

MR, COME: But not as a violation of 8(b) (1) (A),
QUESTION:

Yes.

But that was the only claim in this

case,
MR, COME: That is right, but all that means is that
if we win here, they will not be able to charge it's a viola­
tion of 8(b)(1)(A),

They will have to charge it's a violation

of something else,
QUESTIONt

What else?

MR. COME:

It might violate Landrum-Griffin, I

don't —
QUESTION: And it's your — well, I understood you to
say that it's your position that an extremely, grossly,
unreasonably high fine, by assumption, violates nothing in
the National Labor Relations Act, as amended.

Is that your

44

position?
MR. COME:

Nothing in —* it does not violate

Section 8(b)(1)(A), yes.

tion over that.
MR. COMEj That is correct, I —
QUESTION:

So it must mean that it doesn't violate

Title I, which gives you remedy —

I

QUESTION:

In court.

MR, COME:

— in court; the Board has no connection

to that,
QUESTION: Right.
QUESTION;

So that a suit by the union against a

member, a former member, in the State court, when the former
member raises his defense, this might not be collectible
because it violates the National Labor Relations Act; the
court is moved to say — what?

The court's supposed to rule

on that defense by striking it?
MR. COME:

Well, if the Board is sustained here, in

our position here, yes.
QUESTION: Well, does the court have any power to
rule on that?

45
MR. COME: As to whether or not the matter would be
pre-empted or not?
QUESTION:

Well, does it have power to rule on it?

I mean, if you don't have any power, surely the
court won't.
MR, COME:
QUESTION:

Yes,
So it's supposed to rule this does not

violate 8(b)(1),
MR, COMEs That's right, but of course it would be
applying a decision by this Court which would define what the
rules are that govern the application of 8(b)(1)(A),

Yes, but when?

MR. COME:

If we got it —

QUESTION:

No, you have actually ruled — did the

Yes.

I think you are saying this is on a

different basis than usual.
MR. COME: Well, I don't know that we are talking
about the same thing here.

I don't —

QUESTION: Well, all right,
MR. COME:

The Board's position, when they apply

the rationale pf their Aero-development case in here, is that
they do not have the power to determine that a fine violates
8(b)(1)(A), a fine levied on a member just because of its
excessive amount.

The Court of Appeals disagreed.

QUESTION:

Is that a piece of statutory construction

MR. COME:

Yes.

or what?

QUESTION: What is that?

The Board's construction of

the Act, or are you saying something, it's just something
beyond your power?

out and not decide whether this violates 8(b)(1).
MR. COME: The Court can stay in it, as it was before
8(b)(1)(A) was enacted.

Not determining whether it violates

8(b)(1)(A), but whether it violates State law.

That would

be the question.

Mr. Lang.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SAMUEL LANG, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE BOEING COMPANY
MR. LANG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and way it please the

Court:
The individual employee who is not specifically
represented by counsel here would ask whether the words
"'refrain from concerted activity" in a strike situation should
be so narrowly construed as to put him completely at the
mercy of the power struggle between the employer and the Union,
which may last for 18 months or more; as frequently has
occurred.
It seems to me that in the realistic world of this
individual employee and his Union, which is often as powerful
or more powerful than his employer, unless the statutory
language "refrain from concerted activity" gives him some
freedom of range, then when he and some of his fellow
employees make an attempt to bring the strike to am end,
that is, when they engage in concerted activity to refrain
from continued participation in the strike, and a fine is
levied of $1,000, $2,000, $5,000 — and these are commonplace;
they are not only not unusual, they're commonplace.
After the admonition,* if you try a back-to-work

49
movement, we’ll get you", he and his fellow employees in that
.*
movement are fine one, two or five thousand dollars for that
concerted activity, that is a violation of the Act in the very
plainest terras.
QUESTION;

What evidence, Mr. Lang, do you point

to in the record, other than the fact that 119 more or less
employees went back to work?

What evidence of concerted

activity other than that do you —
MR, LANG;

There is not in this record here, sir,

but the jurisdiction attaches with the allegation.

Once it

is alleged that the fines were levied for this concerted
activity of returning to work, of opposing the Union, of
strikebreaking, then it is the Labor Board's ballgame.
the Labor Board’s province.

It's

And it may not be disturbed by

any other tribunal.
Now, the Board may find that there is no violation
of 8(b)(1)(A) because of the evidence; it may find that the
fines were uniformly imposed; that they were regularly
handled; that due process was accorded to all the parties;
all of the criteria which it may establish and which may stand
the test of time and which may be uniform for all fines, and
there it is in a peculiar position to establish uniformity.
The Board may dismiss the 8(b)(1)(A) charge, as it has dis­
missed thousands of 8(a) (1) and 8(a)(3) charges.

But it hears

the evidence, it considers the case, when the allegation is

50

made.

And that is the thing of paramount importance here.
Until the Board hears the evidence once a charge of

8(b)(1)(A) has been filed, it cannot tell whether it is a
violation of the Acty it cannot tell whether the fine is
excessive for the concerted activity,that is the crux of the
matter, which I believe has to be decided by the Court.
My reading of Allis-Chalmers, in the problems it
presented to the Court, which was somewhat divided in its
analysis of the legislative history of 8(b)(1)(A), leads
me to believe that were it not for a special factor in that
situation, and which is here present also, the case would have
been decided differently.
That special factor is quite relevant to a decision
in this case.

In weighing the balances, in balancing the

interests between the employees as a whole and the individual
employees, both having interests and rights under the Act,
the Court decided that the erosive effect of permitting
members to escape penalty, wholesale, any time they desired to
go back to work, would operate against the purposes of the
statute.
That one single thought pervades the majority
opinion in Allis-Chalmers.

Were it not for that, I believe

that the clean language which gives the employee the right to
refrain as well as to engage in concerted activity would have
been interpreted to allow him to refrain at any time.

51
But I believe Allis-Chalmers should be limited to
that interpretation, should be limited to that narrow rule,
and should be limited to the period of membership.

Otherwise,

unions would be able to subvert the plain meaning of the
statute by writing 8(b)(1)(A) virtually out of it, insofar as
strikebreaking situations were concerned, despite whatever
hardship might come to an employee.
In fact, the language by which the Union in this case
sought to repair its constitution by a subsequent amendment
would freeze the employee forever, since he couldn't effectively
resign ~ and I don't care what words they use, whether it's
resignation or obedience to a rule which carries the same
effect as continued membership.

But the amendment to this

constitution would not allow this employee to go back to work
without severe penalty, penalties which might destroy his
opportunity for employment, because he might be discharged for
garnishment, or he might lose his home, he might lose all his
possessions, he might be replaced in the meantime and lose his
job entirely.
This amendment would prevent him during the period of
the controversy for a foreseeable period prior to the strike
from going back to work, and then when the controversy ended,
if it were a union shop contract, he would be frozen again
for the duration of the contract.
I don’t read the statute or the practicalities of

52
labor relations the way that my brother representing the
Union does.

I read Section 8(a) to provide that an employer

may, without violating the statute, enter into a contract which
requires union membership for the duration of that agreement.
That's the language of Section 8 — the proviso of Section
8(a)(3).

And while we don't have it in this particular case,

in this case we have a very unusual type of provision, from
my long experience in labor relations, which, instead of
requiring the employee to join within thirty days, as is
usually the case, allows him not to join and to remain free
of union membership.
But, except in right-to~work States, the contracts
are legion, almost universal, requiring membership, with all
of the concomitants of membership and all of the requirements
of membership.
I can't concede of any freedom of action on the
part of an individual, who frequently must let — more
frequently than we read the fine print of insurance policies,
is totally ignorant of what is going on between his employer
and his employee in matters of this kind and his Union in
matters of this kind, and is totally ignorant of the fine
print of union constitutions, which often contain 100 and more
pages of fine print.
In fact, it's notorious that unions have an
extremely difficult time obtaining attendance at meetings.

I

53

can't conceive of the individual, caught up in this world,
having any freedom at all under this statute, any freedom
under this statute in strikebreaking situations, which are
the most crucial to him, unless he has the right to get out
from under when the going gets tough.
And I cannot conceive of a rational rule which
allows a union, by hocus-pocus and fancy language, to keep
this employee under its thumb, no matter how meritorious,
no matter how much credence we should give to the tern
"solidarity".

There must be, if 8(b)(1)(A) means anything at

all, if the statute means anything t all; and Taft-Hartley
was adopted in 1947 primarily for the benefit of the
individual.
I can't conceive of his not being allowed to get
out any time after a contract expires.

Just as he has the

right any time a contract expires to go to the Board and file
a petition for decertification to get rid of the union.
So far as interference with the internal affairs
of the Union is concerned, the Union complains, on the one
hand, that the Board shouldn't do it; and, on the other hand,
asks that the courts be allowed to do it.

That poses a

question, since we all agree that somebody should do it, to
the extent of protecting this individual; that poses the
question* Who is the best qualified to do it?
And if the Labor Board, with all of its expertise

54
in thousands of strike situations, has any business in this
field at all, that is if it has any authority to entertain
the question of whether or not an employee may be fined,
then it has the business to decide all of it*
In case after case, the Board does not get only
those cases, only those situations where employees have not
resigned and therefore can follow All is «-Chalmers, in case
after case there will be employees who have resigned, and
employees who have not resigned.

Moreover, as to those who

have resigned, there will be problems requiring interpreta­
tion of the language, even of this amendment in this case,
as to what it means? so that the Board cannot escape dealing
with the problem of fines.
The question is, is it going to deal with that
problem piecemeal?

Is it going to handle just this little bit

and say the rest belongs to the courts?

Or is it going to

be required to do what I think is its duty, to handle the
whole ball of wax and dispose of the whole ball of wax, one
way or the other.
That seems to be the rationale of this Court,
running from Garner v. Teamsters through Garmon v. San Diego
and all the other pre-emption cases.
is a case of pre-emption.

I don't say that this

I say it is, as a practical matter,

tied to a clear legal right that all of this belongs to the
Board, including the decision as to whether or not the fines

55
are reasonable.
QUESTION:

Mr. Lang, under your theory, supposing

the Court were to agree with you, and after we decided the
case the Union brings an action to collect the fine in the
State court, can the State court entertain that action?
MR, LANG:

I think that as in — I'm not sure of

tiie answer; but I would say that at the very least once the
Board decides that the fine is reasonable, it could be.
enforced in the same manner in which a — well, that decision
would be binding upon the State court for collection, since
the Board itself has no collection powers it can't, it can't
tell an employee to pay the fine,
has very broad remedial powers.

I don't know, maybe it
Perhaps the Board could say,

the fine is reasonable, pay it.
But even if it couldn't do that, once it decided
that the fine was not unreasonable, and that's the way I
prefer to put it, that the Board's power should be limited
to finding that the fine is not excessive, because it would
be the excessive nature of the fine for discriminatory
reasons, for discriminatory purpose, that would cause the
violation.
Once the Board found that the fine was not
excessive, then the collection, if it had to go to State court,
would be automatic. The State court would have no power
except to enforce a judgment, as it would a judgment in another

56

jurisdiction.
QUESTION;

So the Union would almost be forced to

first bring an action before the Board# to get a kind of a
declaratory judgment that the fine was reasonable before it
could go into the State court?
MR. LANG;

It wouldn't be the Union that would bring

the action# it would be the individual who is fined# who could
go# counsel-free# without the heavy expense of having to go
into court.

He could go to the Board and file the 8(b)(1)(A)

charge on the basis that the fine was discriminatory —
QUESTION; But supposing he doesn't do that# supposing
the Union simply brings the action in the State court without
ever — without any prior proceedings on the point before
the Board?
MR. LANG:

Then I think that the Court would have

to say we don't have jurisdiction# it must go to the Board.
QUESTION: So then# as a practical matter# if the
Union wants to collect its fine, it's got to first go to the
Board and then to the State court —
MR. LANG:

In one way or another, yes.

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

The Court of Appeals, of course, dealing

with the discriminatory situation you mentioned, would
always have review powers.
MR. LANG;

Yes# sir.

QUESTION: And I suppose when you refer to a discrim-

57
inatory situation, that if, out of 119 people involved here,
they had admitted the reasonable fines as to 110 of them but
picked out nine and had much larger fines, then the Board should
review a claim that they were being subject to a discriminatory
fine because they were the leaders of the return-to-work movement,
or something of that kind.

Is that the kind of discrimination

you're talking about?
MR, LANG:

Yes,

Yes, sir.

The trial examiner dealt with it, the Board didn't.
The Board said it didn't have the power, or authority to deal
with the question of reasonableness of the fine,
I think that the Board should do in this case what
it does in 8(a)(3) cases, what it does in cases of unfair
labor practices against employers, it should draw inferences
from all the facts.

It should reach out, as broadly defined

an unfair labor practice against a Union, particularly in a
situation of this kind where there are very sensitive
problems involved, it should reach out to find out whether or
not there is an unfair labor practice, just as broadly as it
reaches out in cases involving employers,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Thank you, Mr. Lang.
Mr, Dunau, you had run out of time, but we extended
Mr, Come's time here, even though he was aiding and abetting
your position, but 1 have a question or two to put to you,
if you don't mind.

58
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BERNARD DUNAU, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF BOOSTER LODGE NO. 405, ETC.
MR. DUNAU;
QUESTION 3

I would be delighted, Your Honor,
I suppose there are somewhere between

1,000 and 2500 courts of general jurisdiction in the systems
of the fifty States, but, in any event, it's a very large
number.

Doesn't your position and that of Mr. Come's open

this whole area to very great disparity of evaluating these
union fines, in those cases which would get into the State
courts?
MR. DUNAU:

It doesn't open the area, Your Honor;

the area has been open ever since unions have been administer­
ing internal union discipline.

As a matter of the right of a

union member under his constitution with the union, as a
matter of State law, every State court in this country has
been, from the time a union has imposed discipline and a claim
has been made that the discipline has been arbitrarily imposed,
State courts have been deciding just these questions.
QUESTION:

How many of your particular Union here,

your clients, in the past year, or in any year, how many
cases got into State courts on strikebreaking fines?
MR. DUNAU:
how many got in.

I can't say, Your Honor.

I have no idea

I know one fact which we ascertained,

because we wanted to know, in view of the Court of Appeals
determination, that not only was the Board in this business,

59

but that you could not have a rule which eliminated — you
could not have an exhaustion rule, you could not require the
member to exhaust his internal union remedies.

We wanted,

therefore, to find out how many times in the course of a twoyear period we have had internal union appeals.

We found

out that we had had 42 internal union appeals, of which 15
pertained to strikebreaking or picketing activity, and that
with respect to those internal union appeals we reversed about
half of what the local lodge did.
So that if the Board is to do its business, it’s
either going to have to decide you don’t have to exhaust your
internal union remedies, in which case you throw away a
whole body of law which we have always taken for granted, or
it decides you had no excuse for not exhausting your remedies,
or you had an excuse for exhausting your remedies, in which
case you're completely within the interstices of internal
union affairs.
In other words, there is no way of considering an
issue of the reasonableness of a union fine without getting
into the internal business of the union.
Well, if that's what Section 8(b)(1)(A) requires,
fine, that's what it requires.

So it requires a really

different fundamental question»

Is it a violation

of Section

8(b)(1)(A) to impose an unreasonably large fine?
Now, there are two places in this

statute that one

60

can look to for an answer to that question:

one# the words

"restraint and coerce"; are you restraining and coercing by
imposing an unreasonable fine?
But we know you are not restraining and coercing
when you impose a reasonable fine, because that’s what
Allis-Chalmers is all about.
do?

So what does a reasonable fine

The whole purpose of a reasonable fine is to compel a

total restraint from strikebreaking during the course of a
strike.
There is no point to a fine which does not completely
restrain strikebreaking, so that restraint exists by virtue
of a reasonable fine.

It won't add any more restraint by

making the fine unreasonable.

What you do when you say the

fine is unreasonably large is not that it restrains or coerces;
any fine restrains and coerces,

and there's no point to it if

it doesn't restrain or coerce.
What you say when a fine is unreasonable, if you tell
a man it's $2,000, you're going to pay it because you engaged
in strikebreaking, and the State court has figured out that
this man has got take-home pay of $50 and ten children, no
State court is going to enforce that fine because no State
court is going along with the collection of a $2,000 fine
against a man who has $40 in take-home pay or $100 and ten
children.

But that has nothing to do with the fact that you're

enforcing a rule against strikebreaking.

61

Exactly the sarne results would obtain, whether you
were enforcing any union rule.
QUESTION:

But what body of law would the Court

apply, to do what you say -MR. DUNAU:
QUESTION:

State law, Your Honor.
— they inevitably will do.

MR. DUNAU: State law.
QUESTION: State law saying what?
MR, DUNAU:

That in the interpretation of the

constitution between a union and its member, part of that
constitution says that a union will not arbitrarily impose
discipline, an unreasonably large fine is the arbitrary
imposition of discipline, it is therefore forbidden as a matter
of State law.
*

question:

Equity;-or —? -

MR. DUNAU:

Certainly, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Equity.

But this is going to be a suit for

money damages, it*s not in equity.
MR. DUNAU:

Well, I suppose that most courts have

combined equity and law courts; but I don’t care about that.
QUESTION;

But isn’t the answer the exact same

common law that that State applies before the enactment of
the Federal law?
MR. DUNAU:

Exactly, Your Honor.

And the whole

purpose, aside from saying you can’t have any restraint or

62

coercion out of an unreasonable fine that you don't have out
of a reasonable fine, because the whole purpose of a reasonable
fine is so that you will not engage in strikebreaking, you
don't add restraint and coercion by an unreasonable fine.
You go to the proviso.

The proviso deliberately says you

will not impair the right of a labor organization to prescribe
its own rules with respect to the acquisition or retention of
membership.
Now, what does it mean to say you will be able to
prescribe your own rules?

It means that if you have a rule

and it's violated, you can impose internal union discipline
to enforce it, and that's part of the game, it's no part of
the Board's business.
QUESTION:

You think, then, it's better, it's

more cohesive and consistent with the whole history of the
Labor Act to have the courts assisting different States doing
this instead of one policy by the Board itself?
MR. DUNAU:

Let me answer that question, Your Honor,

by telling the Court precisely what happened in David O'Reilly,
which is the case in which the Board said it had no power,
and it has no power because it's not a violation of Section
S(b)(1)(A) .

Were it a violation of Section 8(b)(1)(A), there

would be all the power in the world.
In David O'Reilly, the man engaged in strikebreaking,
he was a member and he remained a member, so we have no

63

resignation issue in that case.
in strikebreaking.

He was fined $500 for engaging

The fine of $500 was equivalent to his

take-home pay from his strikebreaking earnings.

So the fine

said, you engaged in strikebreaking in violation of the rules,
your penalty is:

give up your strikebreaking earnings.

That case was taken by the union, the local union
there, into a California court to seek a judgment to recover
the $500 fine.
employee:

In that court the issue presented by the

the fine is unfair and tin reasonable.
?

There were two proceedings in the Knightsen trior's
court in California, and two appeals.

We finally got a judg­

ment which said, The fine for $500 is reasonable.

The

judgment became final and unappealable, and it was paid.
Okay.

That is the situation in the State court.

It had a State suit to collect.
was unreasonable.

It had a defense the fine

It rejected the defense.

The judgment

was entered, and the judgment was satisfied.
What does the Labor Board do now with that
situation?
The Ninth Circuit says, Go back and determine
reasonableness.
There are only three alternatives:

one, the State

court had no power to consider the issue of reasonableness,
because that is pre-empted to the Labor Board,

If that's

what you had, you have a totally impossible situation.

64

If the question is before the Board, it cannot
render judgment in favor of the union for collection of a
fine.

You want to collect the fine, you have to go to a

State court, and you're told, Sorry, the State court has no
power to determine an issue critical, essential to your
recovery of a fine.
Conceivably, then, what you could have is that,
first, you get a determination out of a Board that the fine
is reasonable.

That will take you five years.

And then you'll

institute a suit in the State court to recover it, and then
you'll have additional defenses in the State court.

That makes

no sense as a matter of dealing with this specific subject.
There is an alternative:
jurisdiction.

you could have concurrent

The Board can decide it; the State court can

Fine.
If you have concurrent jurisdiction, ordinarily it

ends by the proceeding — the proceeding which ends the suit
and determines its disposition by collateral estoppel or
res adjudicata; that's it.
If that’s what we have, then in the California case
the Board has no business in it any more, because there's been
a final, unappealable collective judgment, it's res adjudicata.
So whether the Board decides the issue or the court
will depend on the happenstance, the utter happenstance of
whose proceeding ends, first, or you can have it, as we think

65

we should have its

it’s a State court matter, it was decided

by the State court in David O’Reilly? that's where it begins,
that’s where it ends.

That’s the way we’ve been administering

union discipline in this country since we’ve had unions, and
union discipline.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 11:46 o'clock, a.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.]
