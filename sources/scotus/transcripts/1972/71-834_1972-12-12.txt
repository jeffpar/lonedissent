■Mr. Collins, you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD B. COLLINS, JR.
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. COLLINSs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it. please

the Court;
This case is here on appeal from the state courts
ox Arizona where appellant filed suit to recover state income
tax withheld from her income.

She claims that the Stats has

no jurisdiction to collect its income tax from her on the
ground that she is a Navajo Indian who at all relevant times
lived and worked.within the boundaries of the Navajo Indian
reservation.
The state courts of Arizona denied her claim despite
an unbroken line of decisions by this Court ‘that States have
no jurisdiction over the reservation affairs of Indians.
This Court first interpreted the constitutional
relationship between the States and Indian tribes in 1832 in
the case of Worcester v. Georgia.

Mr. Chief Justice Marshall's

opinion reviews .in detail the constitutional provisions that
relate to Indians and concludes that plenary authority over
Indians is conferred by the Constitution on the Federal
Government and that state laws can have no force or effect on

4
Indian reservations.
Subsequent decisions of this Court modified that
decision in one area where the affairs of non-Indians only are
involved on an Indian reservation and where the Indians are
not directly involved at all.
In addition, Congress has exercised its plenary
authority on certain occasions to grant to the States
authority over reservation Indians.
QUESTION:

Mr. Collins, orient me a little bit.

Are there vast sums involved in this test case, or is it.
mainly principle that we are talking about?

I realise how

important principle is.
MR. COLLINS:

Your Honor, the actual amount of tax

that appellant sought to regain was $16.20.
QUESTION:

Are there other sums other taxpayers

are concerned with?
MR. COLLINS:
a class action.

Your Honor, she filed the action as

It. never reached any decision as to whether

it was properly a class action under State procedures in the
State of Arizona.

I am sure that the Court decision bears

on thousands of Indians in the State of Arizona.
has nearly 100,000 Indians.

Arizona

Most of them live on reservations,

and I think it affects them all.
QUESTION:

Does the record show precisely what her

work was that produced the income that was taxed?

5

MR. COLLINS:

I don't believe so, your Honor, because

the matter was decided on a motion to dismiss.
stands alone as an allegation of fact.
on the reservation.
QUESTION:

The complaint

She worked for a bank

I don’t know that that’s in the record.
One last question.

Has the tribe itself

ever levied an income tax to members of it?
MR. COLLINS:

No, your Honor, the tribe has in effect

a sales tax, but it has no income tax.
QUESTION:

Thank you.

MR. COLLINS:

The decisions of this Court were

summed up in the only treatise on Indian law ever produced,by
Mr. Felix Cohen in 1942.

He stated:

"State laws generally

are not applicable to tribal Indians on an Indian reservation
except where Congress has expressly provided that State
laws shall apply."
It follows that Indians and Indian property on an
Indian reservation are not subject to State taxation except
by virtue of an express authority conferred upon the State
by Act of Congress.
It is our contention that that rule applies here,
that Arizona has acted in contravention of that rule, and
that this Court should reverse on that account.
Now, that rule doesn't apply to all Indians.

There

are Indians who were never placed under Federal protection,
never got a reservation.

There are other Indians over whom

6

the Federal protection has been ended by Congress, beginning
with Oklahoma in the late 19th century.
are still fully under Federal protection.

But. the Navajos
In 1868 the United

States entered into a treaty with the Navajos under which
the Navajos agreed to peace under the protection of the United
States and the reservation was set aside for their exclusive
use.

The treaty specifically provides that outsiders cannot,

enter the reservation without permission of the Navajos with
the exception of Federal agents.
In 1912, 44 years later, Arizona was admitted to the
Union.

However, the United States honored its treaty

commitment to the Navajos by conditioning that admission in
the Arizona Enabling Act on the express ground that Arizona
agree that the reservation’s Indian affairs remain under
the exclusive control of Congress.
In 1949 Congress passed a bill which would have
ceded

concurrent authority over reservation Indians in

Arizona — over the Navajos to the State of Arizona.

But

President Truman vetoed the bill expressly because he objected
to that provision.

And today the Navajos have a comprehensive

tribal government which rules territory in three different
States.

It has a full court system

that adjudicates all

civil matters arising between Indians on the reservation and
all misdemeanors as to Indians on the reservation.

It has

an appellate court that xules as to questions of lav/ as does

7
this one.

It has a bar with Navajo advocates who practice

before the courts*

It has its own police system.

It. has many

regulatory functions that deal with the things that are
important to the Navajo people, such as stock raising,
business licensing, and the like.

A long list of regulatory-

services are provided by the tribal government that are
comparable to those provided by state and local governments
elsewhere.

We detail these in our reply brief.
And it does tax its people.

There is a gross

receipts tax on sales on the reservation, in effect a sales
tax.
The governmental functions on the reservation that
are not tribal sire by and large federal.

All health care is

delivered by the Federal Government through the United States
Public Health Service, roads are built by the Federal Govern­
ment, and so forth.

The Navajos are poor, the federal services

are important to them at this time.
Now, we have argued three grounds, independent, legau
grounds,for reversal of this case.

I intend to address

myself essentially to one of them, the one set out really
in Mr. Cohen’s rule that I cited earlier.

That dispute

focuses on the 1959 decision of this Court in Williams v. Lee.
That case also involved the Navajo Indians.

In that case a

non-Indian brought suit against a Navajo couple in the state
courts of Arizona

based on a reservation-incurred death.

The

8

Navajos moved to dismiss on the ground that the tribal
government alone had jurisdiction over the cause of action.
The Arizona Supreme Court denied that claim,, ruling that
because no Act of Congress expressly forbade the state court
jurisdiction, the state court must have jurisdiction.
the very claim Arizona makes here.

That’s

We are just having a

renewal of the same dispute.
In that case this Court unanimously reversed the
Arizona Supreme Court, in an opinion which forcefully renewed
the Federal protection over reservation Indian governments.
This Court referred to the treaty between the Navajo people
and the Federal Government in these terms:

"Implicit in

these treaty terms was the understanding that the internal
affairs of the Indians remain exclusively within the juris­
diction of whatever tribal government existed."
Now, the Court went on to acknowledge that decisions
of this Court had applied state laws in Indian reservations
to the affairs of non-Indians and recited the cases where
that had been done,

and to that extent that the old case of

Worcester v. Georgia had been modified.

However, in the very

same sentence the Court said, "The basic policy of Worcester
has remained,"

in other words, the policy that the affairs

of the Indians themselves on the reservation are under
exclusively Federal and tribal authority.
This Court also emphasized the meticulous control

which fcha Congress has exercised over the years over reserva­
tion Indian affairs.

The Court, stated that Congress had

acted consistently upon fcha assumption that the States have
no power to regulate Indian affairs on reservations and that
when Congress has wished the States to exercise the power,
it ±3 granted them the jurisdiction which Worcester v, Georgia
denied th© States.
Mow, in the face of this unbroken string of
decisions, the Arizona court below essentially tried to avoid
the affect of the decisions on two grounds:
First, the court below dealt with this Court’s
decision in Williams v. Lee by distinguishing -- creating
a distinction, I would say, between the affairs of the Havajo
tribe and the affairs of individual Navajo Indians.

The

Court seems to say that if the State invasion does not cripple
the tribal government, that it's O.K.
However, this Court has on many occasions ruled
that the affairs of individual Indians on reservations are
subject to the jurisdiction of th© tribe and not the States.
In The Kansas Indians, a 19th century case, this Court
expressly ruled that the State of Kansas could not tax
individual Indians in that state.

The affairs of th© tribe

were not involved at all.
QUESTION:

What kind of a tax was Kansas trying to

levy' -there, Mr. Collins?

10

MR. COLLINS:
QUESTIONs

That was a property tax, your Honor.

Property tax.

MR. COLLINS:

Yes.

In a much more recent case
QUESTION:

A personal property tax?

MR. COLLINS:

I think there were both personal

and real property in that case.
In a much more recent case in Kennerly v. District.
Court of Montana, the Montana Supreme
sort of ruling.

Court made the same

It said that a personal death of an individual

Indian is not a tribal affair.

This Court overruled that

decision in this Court's opinion in Kennerly v. District Court.
of Montana.

And of course,

And, of course Williams v. Lee

itself really involved the personal affairs of an Indian.
The tribe wasn’t party to the case.

All the tribe did was

provide a court where the Navajo contended the matter should
have been heard.
Now, the language in this Court’s opinion in
Williams v. Lee

that Arizona relies on is what the briefs

refer to as the infringement test.

It reads:

"The question

has always been whether the State action infringed on the
right of reservation Indians to make their own laws and be
ruled by them."
We suggest that Arizona has badly distorted the
meaning of that phrase.

Of course the phrase begins with

11
"The question has always been..."

It is not a nsw rule.

In

other words the Court was referring to the time-honored rul©
that reservation Indians are entitled to govern their own
affairs.

Furthermore the Court states, "...make their own

laws and be ruled by them."

We suggest what that means is

the laws that th© Indians make rule rather than state laws.
QUESTION :

Do these Indians vote in Arizona

elections?
MR. COLLINS:
QUESTION s

Yes, your Honor.

Are there any reservation Indians in the

Arizona State legislature?
MR. COLLINS:
QUESTION :

There have been in the past?

MR. COLLINS:
about.

There will be shortly, your Honor.

I believe one occasion that X know

Thera may have been more.
QUESTION:

And there will be one or more in the

new legislature next month?
MR. COLLINS:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, that convenes next year.

So that while they have self-government,

they also participate in the government of the State of
Arizona by exercising the elective franchise.
MR. COLLINS:

That’s correct.

They do participate

in the State government and there is a certain amount of
interaction between the reservation affairs and State
affairs’ that has been authorized by Congress.

Our contention

12
is that it’s up to Congress to adjust that relationship.,
not

up to Arizona.

Ifc*s

Whenever Congress has wanted to adjust

that relationship, it has done so in detail.

Congress has

specifically said that the States can levy certain taxes
against reservation Indians, but not the tax that’s at issue
here.

And we suggest that Congress, I think, can be appealed

to with any question of adjustment of the relationship.
QUESTION:

I assume back in the days of Worcester v.

Georgia they did not vote.
MR. COLLINS:

Is that a reasonable assumption?

Y©s, your Honor.

They didn’t vote

because they weren’t considered citizens.
QUESTION:

They had no part then, as Mr. Justice

Stewart has just suggested, in the overall government.
MR. COLLINS:

That’s correct.

The Indian citizen­

ship was granted by Act of Congress in 1924.

But since that

time this Court has repeatedly ruled on the question of
Federal protection over Indians and has repeatedly rejected
the contention that citizenship ends the protection.

It’s

up to Congress to end it specifically, and it hasn’t been
done implicitly in soma Act like the Citizenship Act.
Now, the subsequent decision of this Court in
Organized Village of Kake v. Egan had a sentence in it which
paraphrased some of the decisions of this Court in earlier
decisions of this Court, including Williams v. Lee.

And that

sentence has also been seized upon by the Arizona court and

13
some other stats courts in an effort to infer that somehow
the door is open to State application of their laws on
Indian reservations.
We suggest that that sentence has been taken out
of context and raisread.

The Kake case involved Indians

not on the reservation who had no comprehensive tribal
government, did not rule any distinct territory, and therefore
was quite different from the Navajos.
QUESTION:

What is the extent of your claim?

Are

you making the same claim if Arizona sought to tax a reservation Indian on income earned outside the reservation?
MR. COLLINS:

If the income were earned off the

reservation, your Honor, I think that the question would be
one of what sometimes is termed taxing jurisdiction, a due
process issue.
QUESTION:

What would be your position? .

MR. COLLINS:
particular facts.

I think it would depend on

Taxing jurisdiction decisions go into the

question of benefit-burden theory of taxation, how much
services are received, and that sort of thing.
QUESTION:

You wouldn't be making the argument you

are making here?
MR. COLLINS:
QUESTION:

No, sir, I would not.

I would not —

You wouldn't think your argument here

would be valid in that case.

14
MR. COLLINS:

I think that the Indians, based on

the argument I am making here, would be entitled to the same
kind of consideration as prevailed in other cases where courts
have considered taxing jurisdiction over non-residents,
essentially

that kind of situation.

I think those kind of

issues would govern that situation.
QUESTION:

And would this argument cover a member

of a tribe who lived off the reservation?
MR. COLLINS:

No, your Honor, not at all.

If the

tribal member lives off the reservation, he is subject to
State jurisdiction.

I think that's long and we're not

suggesting otherwise.
QUESTION:

Even though he earns his income on the
4

reservation?
i

MR. COLLINS:

Well, that just turns around the

taxing jurisdiction question.

That makes the tribe have to

justify his taxing jurisdiction, I think, if that occurred.
But those cases involve the interaction of two
taxing jurisdictions in a way, you know, of cities taxing
commuters, and that kind of question of taxing jurisdiction.
There is a discussion of that issue in one of the amicus
briefs.

But I don't think it's relevant to the main question

here.
QUESTION:

And as well as vote, does the State

furnish various services to the tribe?

Education or —*

15
MR. COLLINS:

The State furnishes a very minor

amount of services to the tribe, your Honor.

I live in

Window Rock on the reservation, and the schools there — this
is not in the record, your Honor, but if this is a relevant
issue, we have pointed out the matter should be remanded
because it's not of record as to either side.

But I live

The school budget in our school district

where I live is about 20 percent State supported —
QUESTION:

Well, the voting thing isn't part of the

MR. COLLINS:

Well, that's a matter of decisional

There is a decision of the Arizona courts

that reservation Indians can vote in the State.

That is

cited in the briefs.
But I would say maybe 10 percent of the support for
education on a reservation comes from State sources overall,
perhaps 10 percent of the source of welfare money.
about it.

That's

There aren't many other State services of any

significance on the reservation.

And furthermore, those

reservation schools are educating non-Indians.

I mean, I

could have children in the reservation schools and I pay
State taxes.

This issue doesn't concern me.

QUESTION:

Do you get any support for your schools

from Apache County or Navajo County in addition to the State?
MR. COLLINS:

There is a real property tax levy,

16

your Honor,that's local.

Thera are real property interests

on the reservation that are taxable.
is taxable under the State system.

Indian mineral production
And Apache County

administers that, but the source of money is all on the
reservation.

There isn't any money that comes from off th©

reservation supporting reservation schools from Apache County.
QUESTION:

But does Apache County with whatever

source it may have contribute something to the financing of
schools on the reservation?
MR. COLLINS:

Yes, it does, your Honor.

If you

mean in the sens® that Apache County derives money from
reservation resources and reapplies it to th© reservation, yes,
that's correct.
I think that the importance of the difference
between this case and th© Court’s decision in Organized
Village of Kake v. Egan is shown by the fact that later on
this Court ruled in Warren Trading Post Company v. Arizana
Tax Commission that again the Navajos are entitled to selfgovernment.

There were other issues in that case, but the

Court distinctly renewed the commitment to the protection of
the Navajo's government.

And, of course the Supreme Court of

Minnesota has ruled contrary to the Arizona courts in a
decision that we think was correct.
I think that an important point is to consider the
implications of the State's positior here on the Indians

17
themselves.
First of all, the State’s posit5.on — they
acknowledged that Williams v. Lee is right.
it’s a decision of this Court.
that

it should be overruled.

They have to;

They haven’t contended so far
Now, that means that sometimes

they don't have jurisdiction to apply their laws on the
reservation.

Now, they say sometimes they do, and we have

a constitutional question each time you decide.
this is very productive of litigation.

Obviously

I mean, each case has

to be taken to an appellate decision.
Well, that's not too serious a problem, but consider
the situation, the uncertainty that is created for reservation
Indians.

There he is sitting there and he receives a letter

from some State bureau in Phoenix that tails him he must do
something because state law requires it.

And he has to

decide whether that state law under constitutional principles
that they suggest apply conflicts with his tribal law in some
way or other.
Well, that uncertainty
warranted.

seems to me to be not

I don't think this Court intended to create that
i •

t'

kind of uncertainty when it decided Williams v, Lee.

And

that’s why we contend that Williams v. Lee has been misread.
HR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

point at 1:00 o’clock.

AFTERNOON SESSION
(1:00 o’clock)
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Collins, you may

continue.
ORAL ARGUMENT (RESUMED) OF RICHARD B. COLLINS,

JR.

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. COLLINS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and nay it please

the Court:
At the time we adjourned, I v:as pointing out that
the implications of Arizona's position create great uncertainty
for reservation Indians.

Each Indian must decide at his

peril whether in a particular situation applied to him
whether the state law -that's being applied conflicts with
tribal authority.
And the third implication of the State's position
is — the way the State views this law the State can pick
and choose when to come onto the reservation.

Now, we see

them trying to tax where it’s to their advantage.

Congress

offered States in Public Law 280 the opportunity to assume
a broad range of jurisdiction of some sort..* In return the
States were to assume certain burdens such as the burdens of
manning the courts and police that had been borne by the
Indians and the Federal Government.

It's clear that

Congress' intent was that the burden of these services be
borne by tine State.

And Arizona is attempting

avoidance of

20

that, intent of Congress.
QUESTION:

If Arizona had accepted that Congressional

offer, would that have authorized it to tax, do you think,
Mr. Collins?
MR. COLLINS:

Justice Rehnquist, that question I am

fully aware is the central question of the*case to follow
*

.

.

this one, and I am not certain of the full reaches of Public
Law 280.

Since it's going to be fully argued by competent

counsel in that case, I would prefer not to comment on it.
But it just seems to me clear that in the absence of compliance
with Public Law 280, it’s absolutely clear that Arizona lacks
jurisdiction to tax.

The full reach of that Act is an

important question.
c

QUESTION:
in this area?

Can Congress impose'duties on the States

What's the scope of that power, if it has

that power?
MR. COLLINS:
QUESTION:

It —

I got the implication that Congress

could not require a State to supply these services with at
the same time taxing them.
MR. COLLINS:

I think what Congress does is,

Congress by virtue of its protection of the Indians provides
substantial services, quite large services which are detailed
from this Court's opinion in Warren Trading Post Company v.
Arizona Tax Commission, that Congress has suggested in

21

certain cases, Public Law 280 is one example, and the
termination laws of the 1950*s are another, that Federal
protection be withdrawn.

But that leaves the Indians as

ordinary citizens of the State with no Federal protection,
no Federal services.

That means the States have to provide

normal services to them that they are not now providing.

In

that sense the Congress can impose a duty on the States, yes.
QUESTION:

Tic. Collins, I believe one of the State's

contentions is that if we accept your proposition here that
Indians, at least for this purpose, are a discrete group who
are not subject to State taxing power, then when the Indians
are seeking the benefit of the equal protection clause to
assert, that the State has treated them in a discriminatory
manner, logically the State could say, well, you know, more
or less by their own choice they are different and we can
treat them differently.
MR. COLLINS:

Do you have any response to that?
Your Honor, I think that the economic

relationship between the tribes and the States is controlled
by Congress.

I think on the other hand, Congress has made

Indians citizens to the States and they are entitled to the
rights of citizens.
This is gone into in detail in our reply brief to
which I refer for a complete.answer.

But our position is

that there might be some question about that.
Government provides broad services.

The Federal

If those were withdrawn,

22

the equities might be grossly altered.

But as things stand,

the State provides very little services to the Navajos.
State has limited taxing authority from the Navajos.
economic thing is in pretty good balance.

The

The

I think the State

is trying to upset that.
I think if a radical change were coming, it has to
come from the Federal Government because it's the Federal
Government that’s providing the services to keep that economic
situation in balance, and it’s up to Congress to change this.
It's up to Congress to order the arrangement.
But I do answer your question yes, I think they are
citizens of the States and entitled to the rights of citizens.
QUESTION:

Your theory is basically one of pre-emption,

I suppose, in a sense.

It isn't a Federal instrumentality

theory or anything like that?
MR. COLLINS:

I think pre-emption would be a proper

word, your Honor, yes.
QUESTION:

They just occupied the field, and that

the thrust of the law is that the States shouldn't burden.
MR. COLLINS;
QUESTION:

I think the thrust —

It!s statutory.

It’s purely a result of

Federal statutory law.
MR. COLLINS:
Constitution.

No, your Honor, I think it's the

I think that Worcester v. Georgia rules that

under the Constitution Indians' affairs are pre-empted by the

23
Federal Government..
Wow, the courts have subsequently ruled that —
QUESTION:

Yes, but — and it's beyond the power of

Congress to — well, it couldn't be beyond the power of
Congress to submit them to State law.
MR. COLLINS:
that, sir.
States,

No, sir.

Congress can — I agree with

Congress has the power to cede jurisdiction to the

and it has repeatedly and in detail done so.

I think

Mr. Sachs© for the United States is going to elaborate on
some of the particular laws that are relevant here.
QUESTION:

It's constitutional in the sense of

supremacy.
MR. COLLINS:

Ah — I believe, your Honor, that the

Court's opinions have referred to several constitutional
provisions:

The Indian commerce clause, the treaty power,

*

and the supremacy clauses all combined leading

to the rule of

Worcester v. Georgia —
QUESTION:

Is that your same argument here with

respect to inheritance taxes?
MR. COLLINS:
QUESTION:

State inheritance taxes?

Yes, I would.

And distinguish the Oklahoma case on

the grounds that non-reservation Indians were involved there?
MR. COLLINS:

Non-reservation Indians and Indians

receiving full services from the State were involved in those
cases.

And that's all the difference in the world.

If they're

24
not on the reservation, they're not entitled to the protection
of the Federal treaty, and so forth.
QUESTION:

Are there any Indians on reservations

that don't have tribal governments?
MU. COLLINS:

A few, I think, on very small reserva­

tions, your Honor.
QUESTION:

Would you make the same argument about

them?
MR. COLLINS:

I think that it's open to contention

that, some of this Court's decisions have depended on there
being a tribal government in existence.
would apply.

I'm not sura how they

It happens in fact that most of the small

reservations are now under Public Law 280 and are governed by
that law specifically.. Arizona has never complied with
Public Law 280 and the States that have not are States with
large reservations where there are tribal governments by and
large.

So I'm not sure that question exists in reality.
QUESTION:

I am just trying to find out whether your

theory has anything to do with drying up resources for tribal
governments.
MR. COLLINS:

Yes, your Honor, it definitely does.

I mean, the Navajo tribe is quite interested in this case.

It

filed a brief in support of the jurisdiction —
QUESTION:

Well, if there wasn't a tribal government,

the question might be different, then.

25
MR. COLLINS:
might be.

It. might b©„

I’m not certain.

I would suppose it

That's a question I can't answer

definitely.
In conclusion, we want to urge that we are not.
asking for a change in the law.

We are asking that this

Court reaffirm its historic commitment to the self-government
Indian reservations, and furthermore that this Court end the
uncertainty that has been created by what Arizona has dons and
a couple of other States in trying to interpret other
decisions of this Court as s\,l lowing this invasion of the
Indian jurisdiction.

We are talking about what we contend is

a subtle area of jurisprudence.

The prior decisions of this

Court and Acts of Congress make it clear that, the Arizona
court below was wrong and should be reversed by this Court.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

-Thank you, Mr. Collins.

Mr. Sachse.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF HARRY R. SACHSE, ESQ.
FOR THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR. SACHSE:

Mr. chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The United States agrees with Mr. Collins1 position
in this case.

I want to try to clarify the position as we

see it and then to emphasize the amount of congressional
activity that there has been in this area of the law and the

26

impropriety of allowing a State unilaterally to obtain juris­
diction within an Indian reservation where Congress has not
authorized the State to obtain that jurisdiction.
In our view, it has been the law for many years that
in the absence of a congressional authorization, or in some
situations the consent of the tribe itself, State lav/s,
including tax lav/, not limited to State tax laws, including
State tax laws, have no applicability to Indians within an
Indian reservation.

This has been the literally hornbook law

as we point out in our brief with a quotation to Mr. Felix
Cohen’s hornbook.
It is also, in our view, the real, holding of
Williams v. Lee.

What1s happened is that the Court in the Kake

case which had nothing to do with tribal, with reservation
Indians, had to make a one-sentence paraphrase of William v, Lee.
And the Arizona court seized on that one sentence paraphrased
to try to make Lee, as one of the amicus put it, to turn it
on its head and make Lee be a decision that allows the States
to act without congressional authority within an Indian
reservation, whereas in fact the Lee decision is exactly the
opposite.
The language that I think is the clearest statement
of Lee is the opinion — the whole case, of course,

the opinion

of Justice Black — but at page 220 of 353 U.S. in which
Justice Black said, "Congress has

... acted consistently

27
upon the assumption that the States have no power to regulate
the affairs of Indians on a reservation."

Then Justice Black

cites four or five statutes that are based on this assumption
and concludes significantly, "When Congress has wished the
States to exercise this power, it hs expressly granted them
the jurisdiction which Worcester v. Georgia had denied them."
I think that's a sound basis for the decision in
this case, and if we adopt the view of the Supreme Court of
Arizona, it will be opening up a can of worms as to what
laws do and do not apply to Indians within Indian reservations.
Wow, I want to use the time that I have to bring
to the Court's attention a number of individual statutes where
Congress has chosen whether State laws should apply within
Indian reservations and to emphasize the particularity with
which Congress has acted in this respect.

I will start with

tax laws, but the picture is equally clear with general laws.
QUESTION:

Mr. Sachse, I take it then that your

position is based primarily on statutes rather than the
Constitution?
MR. SACHSE:

Our position is that the Constitution

gave Congress full authority over the affairs of Indians, that
Congress has exercized that authority both through — Congress
and the Government — through treaties and through setting
up executive order reservations, that Congress further
exercised the authority in the terms of the Enabling Acts °£

28
the Western States, that it has further exercised that
authority by from time to time providing small bits of
jurisdiction for States within Indian reservations, and that
there is no room —
QUESTION:

Sir?
You say Congress, the Constitution has

given Congress general authority over the affairs of Indians.
Would you say that Congress could prohibit a State from taxing
or criminally dealing with a non-reservation Indian if it so
chose?
MR. SACHSE:

I don't know.

I don't think so.

certainly that issue is not presented in this case.

And

I think

the first law that one would have to look at would be the
Enabling Acts of the States and see to what extent

the

States disclaimed jurisdiction.
Now, Congress has, as to Indians who don't live on
reservations, held that they can only be tried in Federal
courts.

18 U.S.C. in defining Indian country doesn't —*
QUESTION:

Does your position leave room for the

State to tax non-reservation Indians?
MR. SACHSE:
QUESTION:
MR. SACHSE:

Yes, it does.
Income tax, inheritance tax?
Our position is that we think its correct

that as to reservation Indians, you start with the assumption
that the State laws have no authority over those Indians, at.
least as to matters of income that they have earned on the

29

reservation.

As of non-reservation Indians you start with

the proposition that they can be taxed like anyone else.

If

they can show a particular statute that gives them the tax
exemption, they then have a tax exemption.

For instance, there

are many non-reservation Indians who live on allotments.

In

Squire v. Caposman, this Court held that the allotment creates
a tax exemption.
QUESTION:

And that would go, I suppose, for reserva­

tion Indians earning income off the reservation, going off
the reservation to work.
MR. SACHSE:

The State*could tax that income?

I would think so.

I don91 know.

I

don't want to state a Government position on that issue.
Certainly if the income is earned off the reservation, it is
quite a different case from this case.
QUESTION:
tax, too, wasn't it?

Squire v. Capoeman was a Federal income
It wouldn't necessarily carry over to a.

State income tax.
MR. SACHSE:

No, except in a fortiori sense, that

the Federal Government traditionally has had greater taxing
powers over Indians than the States because there is no
jurisdictional problem with the Federal Government.

more precis© about what you mean?

Would you be

Here I take it it was a

So the State isn't asserting its process on the reservation.
Do you mean legislative jurisdiction?
MR. SACHSE:

Yes, sir, I mean legislative jurisdiction,

I mean the application of State laws to Indians within an
Indian reservation.

That’s what I mean by jurisdiction.

MR. SACHSE;

Because non-

Indians on the reservation, you don't have any problem with,
is that it?
MR. SACHSE;

Well, with non-Indians on the reserva­

tion, the situation, as you know, was presented in Kahn in a
petition before the Court now that this Court has not acted
upon, Kahn v. Arizona Tax Commission.

In our view that's a

much more difficult case. If Worcester v. Georgia stood in
its original strength, then Kahn couldn't be taxed either.
And if a reservation itfer© an absolute Federal enclave in which
the State* can have no authority against anyone including nonIndians, he couldn't be taxed either.

But we admit that

31
Worcester has been weakened to the point of allowing State
jurisdiction where it applies solely to non-Indians within the
Indian reservation.
So I don’t know what I would do if I ware a judge
deciding the case or —
QUESTION:

Unless there was some spacific Federal

statute that —
MR. SACHSE:

Unless there was some specific Federal

statute authorizing.
I think in the time that I have left which is not
too much, that I would best mention a few of these special
statutes.

For instance, in 1929, I believe it was, Congress

decided it would be a good idea to allow the State motor
vehicle fuel taxes to apply to sales of motor vehicle fuel
whether it was on any sort of Federal reservation or not and
whether it was sold even by a licensed trader or not.
specifically authorized that tax.

And it

And from that date on

without decisions of the.Court or any kind of serious problem,
the States have been able to collect, a motor vehicle tax with
congressional authority within Indian reservations.
In 1939 when Congress — at a time when military
bases were being built around the country — 1940, I believe
it was actually — when Congress considered whether it. wanted
to allow State income taxes and State sales taxes to apply
within Federal areas, is the word that, was used, debate on this

32
Act which is called the Buck Act, debate on this Act was
vary clear that some congressmen proposed that it should apply
within Indian reservations, too.

The Department of the Interior

objected to that and wanted to have Indian reservations
totally excluded from the Act, and the conclusion that Congress
arrived at was to put in 4 U.S.C. 109 which say3, "Though the
States may assess income tax within Federal areas, these shall
T

not apply to Indians not; otherwise taxed," the standard
phrase for Indians living within a reservation or on Indian
country.
We don't say, we are not trying to undo the footnote
in the Warren Trading Post case that says the Buck Act didn't
apply to Indian reservations.

But if it doesn't apply to

Indian reservations, it was a conscious choice by Congress
not to authorize the imposition of State income tax to _
Indians within Indian reservations.
Similarly, Congress has authorized the taxation of
mineral interests within Indian reservations.

But in doing

so it did it with particularity and only authorized the
taxation of mineral interests on unallotted tribally held
lands and then provided that the State taxes could not create
a lien on the land.
Away from the area of taxation — I don’t, think I
need to discuss Public Law 280 here.

That, of course, is the

basic statute in which Congress authorised States to exercise

33
a broad jurisdiction, though also with broad limits within
Indian reservations.
But I want to point out just one particular statute,
a very limited statute that was cited in -the Kake case.
25 U.S.C. 231.

That's

Congress in the 1930's decided that it would

be a good idea to let State health authorities enter Indian
reservations and to allow State truancy officers to enter
Indian reservations.

Obviously, they considered it took a

congressional act to do this.
did it in a particular way.

But when Congress acted it
It authorized the Secretary of

the Interior to allow these Federal officers to enter, it
didn't direct him to do it, it authorized him at his discretion
to do it.

It directed him if he does this to write his own

rules and regulations to determina the extent to which State
officers could come in.

And further, as to the truancy part

of it, it specifically provided that this could only be done
with the consent of the tribal government if there is a
tribal government over the area in question.
Now, w© submit that this is the way the States
should obtain jurisdiction within Indian reservations if
■

• ».

they are to obtain it, it should be by congressional act, and
though it's not up to me to say so particularly, I think the
congressional act should also require consent of the Indian
tribe, because when the reservations were created, whether
by treaty or by Executive Order, it. was certainly the assumption

34
that the States would have no jurisdiction within those
reservations under Worcester v. Georgia which was the ruling
law then.
QUESTION:

I am still wondering whether your

position rests on the fact that there are specific Federal
statutes from which you infer congressional intent to exclude
the States from the reservation in tills case, to exclude —
HR. SACHSE:
that.

I don't til ink it rests entirely on

* s

QUESTION:

Well, than, are you saying that absent

a specific Federal statute granting the power to tax, the
Constitution requires the State to stay out of the reservation?
Is that it?
MR. SACHSE:

I would agree with that except for the

word "Constitution."
QUESTION:
MR. SACHSE:

Well, that's a big except.
I think the Constitution combined with

the treaties made with the Indians and the Enabling Acts of
the States requires the States to stay out of Indian reserva­
tions without congressional approval.

But to me, that's not —

I have trouble envisaging this with the Constitution without
thinking of the factual situation that we would apply it to,
namely, the existence of am Indiam reservation.

And the

Constitution didn’t order the Federal Government to create
Indiam reservations

35

QUESTION:

If there were no Federal statutes oil'the

question, only the Constitution, could the State tax?

I

would gather you would say no,
MR. SACHSE:

I would say if the Indian reservation

existed, it would have to exist by executive order or by
statute or by treaty.

And if it existed in any of those ways,

the State could not tax within that Indian reservation without
the consent of the Federal Government,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Winter.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES D. WINTER
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR. WINTER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it. please

the Court:
The issue in this case is whether or not the State
of Arizona can impose its income tax on income of a Navajo
Indian earned on the Navajo Indian reservation, that particular
Indian residing on the reservation.
Now, there are a number of cases involving the
question of Federal income tax liability of Indians residing
on reservations, and those cases have been decided in favor
of their tax liability.

In the Oklahoma Tax Commission case

although that was an inheritance tax case, nevertheless, the
decision referred to the income tax cases, and State and
Federal income tax liabilities were there equated.
There is the Leahy decision involving the Oklahoma

36
income tax.

This cas© was decided in the 1930’sf and in many

ways it is similar to the situation that we have today .
Although the opinion is short, the briefs throw considerably
more light on the subject.

The Osage Indians had a reserva-

tion, they had a treaty with the Federal Government, they had
a tribal government.

As a matter of fact, the United States

Congress had passed the law providing for State probate
jurisdiction in regard to the Osage before this case was
decided, which is an indication that they had a viable tribal
government.
Now, in that particular case the Court upheld the
State taxation.

It appeared to the Court from the opinion

that since the Indians received the income and were free to
dispose of it as they wished, that there was no reason why
they shouldn’t be taxed on it.
QUESTION:
MR. WINTER:
QUESTION:

Where did they earn the income?
I beg your pardon?
Where did the Indians earn the income in

the Leahy case?

In

other words,- if the Indians had to pay this tax to the State
of Minnesota, then they would be less able to pay a tax, I
suppose, if the tribe should levy a tax.
At any rate, this decision certainly in this respect

38

is in conflict, with decisions in cases like Gravas, v. New York
and. Helvering v. Gerhardt which involved the questions of
whether or not. State employees had to pay Federal income
taxes and whether or not Federal employees had to pay State
income taxes,

In those cases, the Court concluded that the

fact that an employee of a State government or the Federal
\

Government had to pay income taxes to the other government did
not impose any sort, of substantial burden on that other
government.
So we have a test, a practical test, of substantial,
interference with essential governmental function.

The Court/

in the Brun case obviously did not. apply that test.
Now, one other factor is involved in this connection.
This tax has been imposed by the State of Arizona since 1957
at least when an Attorney General opinion in the State of
Arizona was rendered on that subject, and if this tax really
infringed upon the self-government of the Navajo Tjribe, it
would seem that we should have heard about it before now.
NOW, —

MR. WINTER:

according to a Governor's study that was just completed.
QUESTION:
MR. WINTER:

Income tax.
Yes, your Honor, income tax.

But

that’s all reservations in the State, and the Navajo reservation,
of course, has most of the Indian population in the State
because, although the State may have 125,000 Indians, 80,000
or 90,000 of them live on the Navajo reservation.
It’s our position that Williams v. Lee which was
cited by counsel for the appellee is distinguishable from
feliis case because it did involve infringement upon the right
of self-government of the Navajo Tribe.

That case involved

the jurisdiction of the courts, and tnere the Court, concluded
that the State courts did not have jurisdiction over what ware
essentially tribal matters, matters relating to the liability
of a Navajo resident of the reservation in connection with a
transaction entered into on the reservation» ancf that for the
same reasons and for the additional reasons a procedural point
was involved* we

think the Kennerly case is also distinguishable

Now, various arguments have been raised by the
appellants that

express congressional authorization

was required in order for the State laws to apply on the
reservation.

This is an extremely narrow question.

I think

that the United States has already conceded in regards to the
Kahn case

State laws may apply on Indian reservations to

third persons

41
Now, I think that State laws as a practical matter
do apply on Indian reservations when you are talking about
certain benefits, even benefits that are not conferred by
Federal statute or by contract under the Johnson-0'Malley
Act, and I am talking about such things as the right to vote.
When a Navajo Indian votes on a Navajo reservation in a
State election he doesn't vote under tribal law or Federal
lav;, he's voting under State law.
Now, the case of Kake v. Egan set down what v/e
i

considered the rule to be that Stats laws do apply on Indian
reservations with two exceptions —- that they do not infringe
upon the tribal government of the tribe

or if they do not

infringe upon any rights which were granted by an Act of
Congress.

This is certainly in line with what this Court has

held before in Surplus Trading Company v. Cook

I believe

it was dictum to the effect that State laws have restricted
application on Indian reservations, meaning that they do have
application.

And I think by restricted applications the

Court was referring to

the exceptions such as the Indian
And these laws cannot apply if

they are in conflict with Federal laws.
Then in New York v. Martin where the Court said that
in the absence of treaty obligations or Federal statutes,
the State laws do apply on Indian reservations.
Now, it is our position that no Act of Congress

42
prohibits application of

State income taxes to Indians.

The

first statute that comes to mind in this connection in
chronological order is the State Enabling Act of the State of
Arizona, and because there has been considerable confusion
about the language, I would just like to read the language
that, has been the subject of dispute in this connection.
“That the people inhabiting said proposed State do
agree and declare that they forever disclaim all right and
title to the unappropriated and ungranted public lands lying
within the boundaries thereof and to all lands lying within
said boundaries owned or held by any Indian or Indian tribe,
the right or title to which shall have been acquired through
or from the United States or any prior sovereignty and that
until the title of such Indian or Indian tribe shall have been
extinguished, the same should be and remain subject to the
disposition and under the absolute jurisdiction and control
of the Congress of the United States."
These are what we refer to as a disclaimer in the
absolute jurisdiction and control provisions.

Wow, they

don't refer to Indian reservations, although subsequently in
the Enabling Act Congress did refer to Indian reservations,
but they refer to Indian lands.

And the reason for that

distinction, as was pointed out in the Draper case was because
in the General Allotment Act of 1887 Congress provided that
Indians living off of reservations could obtain some

43
unappropriated public lands that would be subject to the same
restrictions as lands that were obtained under allotments.
It was the desire of Congress at the time that Arizona was
admitted to the Union to protect the rights of the Indians in
these lands.
States.

And this Enabling Act is like that of many other

And this language was used, Indian lands ware

referred to, for that reason.
in doing it.

There was no ambiguity at all

And I think that this is confirmed by a number

of State court decisions on the subject as well as the more
recent

decision of this Court in Kaka v. Egan.
Now, Public Law 280 was enacted in 1953.

At that,

time the policy of the Federal Government was to get out of
the Indian reservations, or it was the termination policy.
And because this was the concern at the time, the provisions
of 280 provided for State assumption of jurisdiction.
Now, there was also some confusion at that time
about what the State Enabling Acts meant.

This confusion is

indicated in a letter that we have quoted from and that was
in the committee reports.

It's in our brief.

acted partly to clear up this confusion.

So Congress

They wanted to

provide a procedure so that the States would not consider
these Enabling Acts to be a stumbling block, so that they
would assume a full measure of jurisdiction so that the
Federal Government could be relieved of all responsibility
for it as soon as the Indians were ready for this.

Public Law

44
280 did not* deprive the States of any jurisdiction that

they

already had.
Now, the Civil Rights Act of 1963 amended Public Law
280 in effect to require tribal consent to State assumption
of jurisdiction.
There is one more item, and that's the treaty of
1868.

That treaty has nothing at all in it about the tax

liability of the Indians.

It was in 1871 that the Government

decided that the Indians were an internal problem, that
there would be no more treaties with the Indians.

And it

would not seem fair to distinguish between the Navajos and
other Indians because the Navajos have a treaty that says
nothing about taxes.
implied.

Immunity from taxation is not to be

If Congress had intended to except 100,000 Navajos

in Arizona from income taxes, they would certainly have said
so in clear and unmistakable language.
Now, the Navajos are an unusual Indian reservation.
There are about 16 or 18 Indian reservations in the State of
Arizona, and the Navajos are not representative, they are an
extremely large reservation.

They have more resources than

the average reservation does, so they certainly require lass
assistance than the other reservations do, because some of the
reservations are so small that they are hardly an economical
unit, an economical governmental unit.

Some of them may only

have a few hundred acres and a few hundred Indians on them and

45
they can't provide—they can't receive the services from the
Federal Government that the State would provide for them, and
they are obviously not able to furnish those services them­
selves .
But even the Navajo Indians require many services
from the State.

I don’t regard it as important, but counsel

for the other side mentioned, and I am reluctant to mention
it.

because it's outside the record, but nevertheless, accord­

ing to the information from our Governor's report, the
financial picture that he presented of the relationship of
the Indian and the tribe is not at all accurate.

The State

does have a very substantial stake in the sense that the
State spends a lot more money on the Indian reservation than
it gets back out of them, and the total runs into millions of
dollars.
Now, the income tax on net income is a very fair
tax.

The rate structure of the Arizona State income tax is

a low one.

It runs from 1.5 to 8 percent.

It's an extremely

fair way to balance the burdens of State government.
QUESTION:

Counsel, all of those are very good

arguments on the economic theory of why they should be taxed,
but they don't reach the statutory basis or any constitutional
basis, do they?
MR. WINTER;

That is true, your Honor.

I was only

mentioning them because it had been mentioned before and ever

since the Warren Trading Post case, we have felt that, the
State does make provision for the Indians on the reservation.
And, of course the State’s role has greatly grown.

But, I

agree.
I have no further arguments, your Honor, unless the
Court has any questions.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Thank you

very much.
I think your time is up but if you have something
important?
REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD B. COLLINS, JR.
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. COLLINS:

Excuse me, your Honor, I thought I

had a minute.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Your friend used it up,

but we will give you a few anyway if you have something on
your mind.
MR. COLLINS:

I have only about two or three

sentences, your Honor.
May it please the Court:
In reply to Mr. Justice White's question about the
Constitution.

We definitely do think it’s a constitutional

allocation of power and that the establishment of a reservation
is all the Federal Government formal involvement necessary.
I think Mr. Sachse said that.

47
The Leahy case and other Oklahoma cases are in
Oklahoma where there is a law like Public Law 230 and has been
and was at the time of the Leahy case committing jurisdiction
to the State.

It .wasn’t the same as Public Lav/ 280, it may

not have the same scope, but it certainly doesn’t apply to the
Navajos.
And, finally ~~
QUESTION:

It says the tax there was on the individual

share of tribal income.
MR. COLLINS:

It was on a mineral share from an

allotment, I believe, your Honor.
QUESTION:

It says the individual share of income

on property owned by the tribe.
MR. COLLINS:

Your Honor, it’s on what's called the

Osage mineral shares which have been ruled to be personal
property of the individual Indian.

I agree that they are

formally shares in the tribe's mineral income, but the shares
are inheritable by one Indian from another.
QUESTION:

That way.

MR. COLLINS:

And finally — one more sentence.

Excuse me.
QUESTION:

Am I right in remembering that in the

Leahy case, somewhere in the course of that opinion, I think
in a footnote, the distinctively different Oklahoma situation
was mentioned

48

MR. COLLINS:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.

That's correct.

And it is a distinctively different

situation^ at least by its specific statute, a predecessor,
Wcisn3 fe it, of th© more generalised 280?
MR. COLLINS:

That's our point, your Honor, that

the Oklahoma situation has no application her® because it’s
subject to special laws that don’t apply to Arizona.
QUESTION:
Judge

I would assume that the former Chief

of the Court of Criminal Appeals of Oklahoma paid

income tax, becuase he was Choktaw Indian, but he was also
the Chief Judge.

So I assume he paid State income tax.

And

I don’t see where it has got anything to do with this case
at. all.
MR. COLLINS:

I agree with that, your Honor.

I had one more sentence, which is that we contend
that as an alternate kind.-of decision, this Court has construed
Public Law 280 to be ruling in this case in the Kennedy case.
I don’t have time to go into that, but it's in the briefs.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, gentlemen.

above-entitled matter was submitted.]
