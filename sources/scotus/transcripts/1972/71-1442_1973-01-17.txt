PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first this morning in No. 71-1^2, Colgrove against Battin.
Mr. Skedd, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LLOYD J. SKEDD, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SKEDD:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
The Montana District Court adopted a rule in
September, at least it was filed in September of 1971
requiring all civil cases to be tried before a six-man jury.
This case was a libel.
Q

Six-man jury?

MR. SKEDD:
Q

Six man or woman, six persons.

Six persons?

MR. SKEDD:

Yes, your Honor.

The plaintiff that

I was representing objected to the six-man jury.

We went to

the circuit court and the circuit court refused to mandate
the judge and we are here now on certiorari.
The questions that we have are simply that one,
the six-man jury — six-person jury — adopted by the local
district court for local rule offends the Constitution, the
Seventh Amendment and the second argument being that the
six-man — or six-person — jury offends the rules of civil
procedure

if

Now, in regard to the first argument then, the
constitutional argument, the Seventh Amendment, of course,
provides that in civil cases over the sum of $20, title to
a jury has that common law.
Now, the word "common law" is used twice in that
particular

section and, as was pointed out in note 30 in the

Williams versus Florida.

We believe that that reference to

the common law at that time when it was adopted means that
there is a constitutional right to twelve persons on the jury
unless there is a stipulation as provided by the rules that
were adopted which were forwarded by this Court to Congress.
Now, Capitol Traction versus Hof

decided in 1399

that a twelve-person jury was a common law jury.

It is

well-documented in that case and as far as I know that Is
still the law,

the laiv as pronounced by this Court and

for a district court to adopt a local rule overruling a
decision of this Court seems to me to offend and be
■. >■

• r.

irregular.
The second portion, then, of the argument relating
to the rules,

rule one under the provisions — under the

act of Congress, that is 28 U.S. Code section 2072, and
adopted by this Court provides that these rules shall govern
the district courts.

The rules of civil procedure recall

when they were adopted in *63 and at

that time there was

some question by members of this court as to whether or not

5
they should be adopted because of the question of juries but
at any rate, they were adopted and rule 48 of those rules
provides very clearly

— and I don't see how it could be

read otherwise — that the parties may stipulate to a jury of
less than twelve persons.
Now, in this case, the parties did not stipulate.
Both parties wanted a twelve-man jury.

In rule 48 it does

not say nor imply that the court — the local court — may
say, you take less than

twelve jurors.

not stipulate to eleven, ten, eight.

For example, you could
You are bound by cur­

rules at our court thirteen-D, the six-man rule, to six
jurors.

You couldn’t stipulate to three.
We believe that that was not the intent of the

rule and we believe that Congress in passing on those rules
had definitely in mind a twelve-man jury.
Q

Well, why Is it they weren't stipulating

three or four, even under your local rule?
MR. SKEDD:

The rule thirteen-one says "A civil

jury shall consist of six.”
Q

What if you had offered to stipulate to

four before Judge Battin?

Do you think he would have

turned you do\m on the basis of that rule?
MR. SKEDD:

Well, I am confident that Judge Battin

would agree, gentlemen, but the rule itself i3 what I am
speaking of, your Honor.

It states that "It shall consist of

6
six persons."

It think it does away effectively at least

with a stipulation above the number six — seven, eight, nine,
ten, eleven or twleve.
Q

You and your opponent were both willing to

stipulate to tv/elve, I take it?
MR. SKEDD:

Yes, your Honor, we made the motion

for a twelve-man jury and the court, of course, said, no, we
are going to trial with a six-man jury, as provided by the
new rules.

In the circuit court, the Ninth Circuit court,

the opponents, the defendants, joined with us and said that
they wanted a twelve-man jury at that time.

But there have

been many briefs filed in this that are much deeper and
better than I can write them by the Civil Liberties unions
and others.

They have them

with regard to whether or not

a six-man jury Is a fair cross-section of the people.

I

mean whether or not you are not losing some rights by taking
a six-man jury.

They say there is evidence now written by

Professor Ziegler — or whatever his name is — that
conclusively shows that with twelve men you get a more
diverse representation than you would vrLth six.
Q

You'd get a still larger one if you had fifty.

MR. SKEDD:

That is right, your Honor and whether

or not in these times they state in their brief and I believe,
the amount of jurors should be increased rather than
decreased to get a fair representation is a good question

7
but that, as the Court said in Williams — in Williams they
said they leave it to the legislature.

They leave it to

the legislature and to the Congress to determine the policy
of the number of jurors and I think that is a proper
allocation with after many people testifying after much
evidence taken rather than adopting a local rule and saying
you have a six-man jury, by doing that.
Q

Mr. Skedd, was any point made in the Ninth

Circuit as to whether this kind of issue was properly
raisable by mandamus?
MR. SKEDD:

No, there was not, your Honor.

As a matter of fact, the

court stayed — the

district court — stayed the trial of this case until the
mandamus one way or the other would come down.

That xms filed

in October of 1971 and the circuit court handed its dedision
down in March and because of this petition and because of
the proceedings had here with regard to six-man juries in the
federal courts in the State of Montana, without stipulation
they haven't tried any six-man juries as far ,as I know but
our position then is that Congress authorised and allowed
this court to adopt rules for the district court if this
court proposed the rules of Congress, assuming the
constitutional problem is all right, then it would be
properly presented and become a part of the force of law.
This Court dould do it and Congress reviews it

8
within the ninety days but certainly a local court by local
rule cannot overturn a federal rule properly presented by the
Court.
We say that this case should be returned 3uch that
the petitioner is allowed to have twelve men hear him and
try his case.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Skedd.

Mr. Crowley.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CALE CROWLEY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. CROWLEY:

Mr. Chief Justice and gentlemen

of the Court:
It is obvious from reading the majority and the

concurring and the dissenting opinions in all of the cases
which have considered both the Sixth and Seventh Amendments
that you gentlemen have a far deeper and broader appreciation
of the constitutional history than we

do and there will be

no rehash.
There are a few very brief highlights that I think
are essential to shed light on a point which is not covered
in my brief and which I think you gentlemen should consider
in deliberating in this case when we come to it.
Now, I like very, very much the description of an
impartial jury under the American tradition that you find

9
In the Ballard ease and I think we can start out xvith these
two basic assumptions that the selective consistency as
well as the qualification competency of a jury is vital and
essential as ingredients of a fair and impartial jury and
having those two points in mind, let's go back for a few
minutes to the period of time between the miracle at
Philadelphia and the date of September 2*1 of 1789 when the
Federal Judiciary Act was first enacted and the date of
September 25 of 1789 when the Bill of Rights was adopted.
Now, we all know that at the original convention
because, apparently, of two things, the great fear of our
people of concentrating an overall federal control that
might result in new tyranny against them and probably more
importantly because of the great differences in jury
practice that existed between the states, they could not
agree on any single federal standard of jury consistency
so nothing was done.
And then came the great hue and cry throughout the
land.

Our people wnated the protection of the Bill of

Rights in writing.

They didn’t want to rely on promises

of legislation and the like and that was accomplished, at
the First Congress.
Again we find that at that time, because of the
fear of centralized federal control, all efforts in the
promulgation of the Seventh Amendment to provide that the

10
jury shall be as It was heretofore or It shall have the
requisites as they were before, were defeated and that first
Congress, bared down to its barest fundamental essential in
simple and unambiguous language, the preservation of the right
in these words, "In actions at common lav/, the right of trial
by jury shall be preserved," and we have to then construe
that what they did and what they rejected, with the language
that we find in that First Federal Judiciary Act.
Now, there were three places in that act where they
specified clearly three sections that issues of fact shall
be tried by a jury and then we come to the all-important
section 29 of the Federal Judiciary Act which I think has
to be construed along with the Seventh Amendment and keeping
in mind these two elements, these two vital ingredients of
selective consistency and qualification competency that we
are all agreed upon.
Now, subsection A of the Federal Judiciary Act, of
section 29, provided that in cases punishable by death the
trial shall be in the county where the offense was
committed and if for any reason it is too inconvenient to
hold the trial in that county, the trial shall be held at
some place in the district and twelve petit jurors shall be
summoned from thence.

The only place in the Constitution

and the only place in the Federal Judiciary Act that you
find the number of tv/elve and it was confined to actions of

11
crimes punishable by death and then we go to subsection Bs
which I think is of great importance to you in your
deliberations here.
Now, keeping in mind that the traditional American
Jury up until that time consisted solely of twelve white male
citizens and keeping in mind the fear that our people had of
the — of devising a centralized federal consistency that
would be controlling overall and the differences in
practices, they provided in the Federal Judiciary Act and
Jurors in all cases in the courts of the United States shall
be designated by lot according to the mode of forming Juries
therein now practiced so far as the laws of the same shall
render such designation practicable and the Jurors shall
have the same qualifications as are requisite for Jurors by
the laws of the state of which they are citizens and shall
be returned from time to time so as to have an impartial
trial.
There are our two ingredients of selective
consistency and qualification competency in there,

no set

federal standard because they couldn't agree on it in the
Seventh Amendment.

All they could agree on in the Seventh

Amendment were the preservation of the basic right to a trial
by Jury and nothing more.
Now, speculate vrith me for one moment.

Let's go

back to the time this provision was enacted in the Federal

12
Judiciary Act.

Supposing one or more of our states at that

time had had the enlightened foresight to provide in their
state law all persons born or naturalized within the
boundaries of this state shall be citizens and entitled to
the same privileges of amenities and to the same due process
of lav/ and to the equal protection under the law of life,
liberty and property and qualified to serve on juries.

Can

there be any doubt that in any one of those states the jury
would have

consisted as described in the Ballard

case of

both men and vvromen regardless of race or color or sex?
Can there be any doubt in view of construing the
reason for paring the Seventh Amendment dov/n to its barest
fundamental essentials and the language of this Federal
Judiciary Act, that the people in that Congress contemplated
that there were differences in selective consistency and
there were differences in qualification competency and

at

the same time provided for potential changes and for the life
of me, if you can change the quality competency of a civil
jury, I can't see where the number twelve is a sacred ccw
that should be preserved for posterity.
Q

Do you know of any examples where, in the

states or otherwise, where there were juries of less than
twelve citizens at the time the Constitution was enacted?
MR, CROWLEY:
material available to

Sir, I don't know.
us —

Our — the

13
Q

What do you do about the statute which says

that — which seems to indicate that Juries shall — in the
federal courts ~ shall be as they were at common lav; and
under the amendment?
MR. CROWLEY:

I don't think the Seventh Amendment

says that.
Q

Well, the

Seventh Amendment doesn't, but

a statute does.
MR. CROWLEY:
Q

Oh, you mean this 28 —

Yes, 2072.

I suppose that is a controlling

limitation on the power of the courts to make their own
rules.
MR. CROWLEY:
Q

Isn't it?

MR. CROWLEY:
Q

Well, all I can say is —

I agree with that.

And so we must deal with the limitation that

the Juries shall be left as they were at common lav;, even if
the Seventh Amendment doesn’t require it.
MR. CROWLEY:
Q

That is a possibility.

Well, is it or not?

What do you do with that

statute?
MR. CROWLEY:

Well, we get back to this.

I don't

know that there was any consistency in the essentials of
the oommon law Jury.

I know that you have twelve.

But I

can’t find any place, I mean in my reading, which says, which

Is proof that there was any Intention at any time to continue
twelve as the number.
Q

Well3 let’s assume that you are right under

the amendment, assume you are quite right as far as the
requirements of the Seventh Amendment are concerned,, but let’s
assume Congress came along and said juries in
courts shall be twelve.
MR. CROWLEY:
Q

the federal

There would be twelve, we’d say.
We would be —

They haven’t said that.

The Congress has said

juries shall, in civil cases, shall be as they were at common
law.
MR. CROWLEY:

If that is the interpretation of

that congressional statute, I —
Q

Well, what is your interpretation of it?

MR. CROWLEY:

I just don’t import that therewas

at that time any consistency, any detailed consistency and
I am not sure, your Honor, that such a law by Congress, if the
Seventh Amendment was not intended to impose those conditions,
I am not sure that that would be a binding restriction.
Q

Well, certainly, Congress under Article three

has power to create lower federal courts and I suppose that
it would follow from that Article three power that it would ~
MR. CROWLEY:
clause.

Plus the necessary appropriate

I’ll have to go over this, your Honor.
Q

— have power plus the necessary and

15
appropriate clause would have power to say how trials In
those courts would be conducted.
MR. CROWLEY:
Q

I’ll have to go along with that.

That is implicit in the rulemaking structure

under which the federal rules of civil and criminal
procedure were enacted, Is it not?
MR. CROWLEY:
Q

I’ll have to concede that.

Those are enactments, ultimatelys of

Congress, were they not?
MR. CROWLEY:

Yes, even though they are promulgated

by this Court, they are In effect -G
Q

They have no effect —

MR. CROWLEY:
Q

— In behalf of Congress.

— without the acquiescence of Congress.

MR. CROWLEY:

That is right.

I would like to make one comment, if I may in
connection with the discussion about cross-section of the
community.

The billings division of our court consists of

some twenty counties

and there is a total of 186,000 people

there of which 93,000 come from one county and I neglected
to find out how many qualified jurors there are from that
whole group but I don’t think it would be unfair to suggest
maybe a figure of 50,000.
Now, we will call a trial calendar of from one to
five cases and out of that 50,000 people they will select a

16
trial panel of from 30 to 65 total panel jurors and then
from that 30 to 65 people., we will select either the twelve
or the six-man jury as the case may be and there isn’t any
doubt, of course, that if you were simply comparing the
twelve and six to a selection out of thirty-five that you
would have more of a cross-section out of the twelve and six
and again, I am no mathematical Einstein but I would be very
much surprised if it were computed mathematically by percen­
tages, that the difference between the six-man and the
twelve-man insofar as a cross-section of that 50,000 is
concerned would be anything but miniscule,
I think this bugaboo of cross-section is more
fiction than fact.
Q

You are now addressing yourself to the

wisdom rather than to the statutory or —
MR. CROWLEY:

Well, these are commented on in the

Amicus briefs, your Honor, and I just wanted to make that
point.
The same thing with respect to statistics.

I had

the opportunity last summer at the circuit conference of
the Ninth Circuit Court, to asked Professor

Zeisel point

blank whether or not his statistics would have any

valid

application to jury practice in a place such as Montana
and I posed to him these basic facts.
Montana, areawise, is the fourth largest in the

17
Union.

You can put most of the New England states and part

of New York In our boundaries.

We have got a total of

675,000 people in all that area.

Five or six of our

communities are big cities, most of which is 70,000, will
have more than half of that total amount and I will go into
a county to try a case which is as large in area as
Connecticut or Delaware and maybe even approaching Maryland
and I’ll have a total population of from 1,600 to 2,500
people who are rural, farming, agricultural estate and I
posed those facts to the Professor and asked him if there
had ever been any study made that would correlate or validly
apply as statistics to a state such as ours and he said no.
He said "Our statistics are drawn from the large
metropolitan areas"and so on, so that I don’t think that is
a good reason here.
Q

Mr. Crowley?

MR. CROWLEY:
Q

Montana is one judicialdistrict.

MR. CROWLEY:
Q

Yes, sir.

Yes, the whole district.

And where does thedistrict

MR. CROWLEY:

court sit?

Well, we have it then divided into

six divisions, your Honor.
Q

Six.

MR. CROWLEY:

And in the Missoula division,

Judge Russel Smith was the senior acting judge.

In the

18
Butte division, retired Judge Murray, who still handles all
matters in retirement when that court sits, and then in
Billings there are Judge Jamison and Judge Battin and
Judge Battin is the junior acting judge.
By the way, in that connection, the connection of
«*>

talking about statistics, another —
Q

Yes, but now, you said there were six

divisions.
MR. CROWLEY:
Q

Yes.

And you have so far identified —

MR. CROWLEY:
Q

Yes, then we travel.

Judge Battin -

Then the others move.

MR. CROWLEY:

Judge Battin will take care of the

Great Palls division and the Billings division.

Judge Smith

will take care of the Missoula division and the Northern
Havern division.

Judge Murray takes care of the Helena

division.

Well, and then Battin takes care of the Helena

division.

So they do move from division to division.
Q

And the jurors are drawn in any division

just from the division?
MR. CROWLEY:

That is right, sir.

Well, I wanted to make this point, too.

This rule

for Montana is not the product of pique or frustration of
any federal judge who is
the contrary.

way behind on his calendar.

Quite

This rule was devised by those four men with

19
great legal and judicial talent who were born and raised in
Montana.

Three of them went through our Montana law school

and they know Montana like the back of their hands.

I

would accept their judgment over any jury statistics from
any law school in the country.
Q

Mr. Crowley?

MR. CROWLEY:
Q

Yes, sir.

The petitioner relies on Capital Traction

Company and says in effect in his brief that the court there
held that the Constitution guarantees, in the federal civil
cases, a jury of twelve people.
MR. CROWLEY:
Q

What is your view on that?

I don't agree with that statement.

Well, will you — would you analyse that?

MR. CROWLEY:

I know that in the Capital Traction

case the court said that by way of dicta that we infer or
we accept or we assume that a jury shall be twelve.

But I

don’t think that that was the gist of the holding in that
case at all.

As I recall it, Congress had enacted a statute

applicable to the District of Columbia which provided that
they could have a trial by jury in a justice case and the
petitioner there objected and the statute also provided
that in the even that they lost in the justice courts, then
they would have their right of appeal to the court of
record, providing they posted a bond and that that was the
decision of that case that there was no justice court of

20

common lav; and the rules really had no application.

They

did say in that case, by way of inference or acceptance or
assumption or whatever it may be, that a civil jury should
be twelve.

There is no doubt about that.
Q

And they said it several times.

MR. CROVJLEY:

Yes, sir.

But that issue was never

the issue that was to be decided in the case.

It was never

studied and never reviewed from the standpoint of whether that
was or was not the fact and I find no evidence that I can
find in any of the material that I have read that the first
Congress or the Constitutional Convention ever has said in
so many words that our Juries shall be twelve.

I think that

is something that you have to decide all anew, regardless of
the dicta that there was in any of those cases.
There were two or three cases as I remember it,
your Honors, where they made that same assumption, the
American Fisher and Capital Traction and Springfield cases I
remember In particular.

But those were all dicta and they

were simply assuming that that was what was intended.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Crowley.

Do you have anything further, Mr. Skedd?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LLOYD SKEDD, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SKEDD:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

21
I just have two remarks:
One, I agree with my friend and colleague,

Mr. Colgrove, that we have fine judges.
to get the idea I don’t.

I don’t want anyone

They are my friends and we think

they are competent and good.
However, our friends the judge — judges of this
district do not see fit to publish the fact that this rule
was going to be set out.

As a matter of fact, Mr. Crowley is

on the rules commission that we had for the district court
and in August or whenever it was adopted — we don’t know —
it was effective September the 1st, 1971 — we found out
about it or I found out about it on September the 27th at
the final pretrial conference when we were going to trial that
it had been adopted.
It was not announced such as they did apparently in
Minnesota to see how the bar accepts it.
Whether or not I find that the greater majority, in
fact, nearly all of the lawyers in Montana at this reading
are opposed to the six-man jury but Capital Traction — my
second remark — Capital Traction said that — as I read it —
that what that case does is determine what is a common lav;
jury under the Seventh Amendment,
Q

My borther Poivell is certainly correct in

pointing out in his questions that that was not the issue
in that case, was it?

22

MR. SKEDD:
Q

Well, that was a — the court —

Nobody in that case had tried to have a jury

of less than twelve.
MR. SKEDD:

No, I think that was the District of

Columbia, but —
Q

It was, indeed, from the District of Columbia

and the issue was not whether or not there could be a jury of
less than twelve, was it?
MR. SKEDD:
Q

No.

They just added that in.

So anything that the court said was technically

dicta.
MR. SKEDD:

Yes, in Roman numeral III of the

court’s decision.
Q

Right.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 10:38 o'clock a.m., the case was
submitted.)
