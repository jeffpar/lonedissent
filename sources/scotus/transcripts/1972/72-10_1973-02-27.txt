PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments now

in No» 72-10, Moor against County of Alameda.
Mr. Greenberg.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD M. GREENBERG, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. GREENBERG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
For purposes of this appeal, the facts arc not
really in dispute in this case.
What happened, essentially, is that on May 15, 1969,
our clients, David Moor in one case and the plaintiff William
Donovan Rundle, Jr., in the other case, were shot by an
Alameda County deputy sheriff in connection with, the Peoples
Park disturbances in Berkely.
Subsequently, a suit was filed -- actually, two
suits -- against the deputy that shot our client, his superior
officers for their own acts, and the County of Alameda.
The concern here is only with that aspect of the case
against the County of Alameda*
What's involved here are three separate and distinct
concepts of Federal jurisdiction*
The first, the Civil Rights Acts

jurisdiction,

the second pendent jurisdiction, and the third diversity
jurisdiction.

4
The diversity jurisdiction issue relates only to
the Moor case.

It has no application whatsoever to the Rundle

C0 B0 v

Of these three issues, we would submit that the
clearest example of error by the court below is in connection
x-sith the ruling on the diversity issue.
For over 100 years, this Court, Courts of Appeals,
District Courts and at least two District Courts within the
Ilinth Circuit, have consistently held that political sub­
divisions of a State, such as the County of Alameda, are
considered citizens of the State for diversity jurisdiction
purposes,
For some unexplained reason, we have the rather
anomalous result that, x$ifch respect to California counties,
they are presently not considered citizens of California for
diversity jurisdiction purposes,
Q

Is it your position that, regardless of the relation­

ship of a county to a particular State,it should be one rule
throughout the country?
MR. GREENBERG:

Barring at least a circumstance

which would show that the State is in essence the real party
in interest in the case, correct;
And I can’t think of a political subdivision, such
as a county, in any State in the Union where that would be the
case.

5
Consistently, in every cose we have researched on
the point, it has always been that the county is separate
and distinct from the State.
Taking this case, for example, anyone who is familiar
with California law and California politics, would have to
concede that the State of California is not the real party in
interest in this case.
No liability is being sought against it.
procure a judgment, it won't be liable for it.

If we

Indeed, it is

not even a party in interest, let alone a real party in
interest.
So, for those reasons, I would urge on the Court
that, even if we are successful with respect to the Civil
Rights Acts

jurisdiction contention or the pendent jurisdic­

tion aspect, or both, that the Court also reverse the diversity
aspect jurisdiction holding.
I know for a fact that it has had serious effect,
for example, on out of State contractors who wish to sue
counties with which they contract in the State.
As a result of the holding in this court, there is
no diversity jurisdiction.

The county is not a citizen, and

there is just no explanation given for that rule,
Q

It arose in kind of an offhand, casual, way, I

gather, in the Ninth Circuit, originating with a brief opinion
by the late District Judge Mathis.

It was accepted by the Ninth

&
Circuit and then everything else was built on that.
MR. GREENBERG:

There are really only two opinions

by the Ninth Circuit that even enunciate that point.

One is

the Miller case which was a pro per case, and then our case,
in which it was cited as authority.
I think one could search both of those opinions in
vain to find any reasoned analysis as to why,in essence, the
court feels that the State of California is somehow the real
party in interest in our case,

And that's really what you

have to conclude to conclude it is a State agency.
Q

In the other cases -- and you are quite correct,

in my understanding, that there are many of them -- which do
hold that a county is a citizen for diversity purposes, is
there any analysis of the particular relationship between the
county and the State in the -MR. GREENBERG:

Well, I would cite two clear

examples of the two district courts within the Ninth Circuit
who have refused to follow the Ninth Circuit holding, the
Oregon case and the Arizona, in which at length analysed the
nature of the county and showed, quite conclusively, that it
wasn't the State of Oregon or the State of Arizona.
There are other cases cited in our brief which also
engage in this kind of analysis.

Indeed, some of them say

that’s the kind of analysis you should make when a claim is
made that the particular defendant is, in essence, a State

7
agency.
No such analysis was made here.
We have briefed at length, in our brief, all of the
powers and functions of the County of Alameda that distinguish
it from the State of California.
I think both the county and the State would be
surprised if they found out they were considered one and the
same,
Q

Why is the State not a citisen of the State?
MR. GREENBERG:

Starting with the Eleventh Amendment,

you can’t sue a State -**
Q

That’s a different reason.

1 mean, in one case, you

would be saying there is an affirmative defense based on the
Eleventh Amendment.

In the other case, you are saying there

is not the basic prerequisite for jurisdiction.
MR. GREENBERG:

I think that this Court has held ,and

many courts have held, that a State cannot be a citisen of
itself.

That’s a firmly established rule that we don’t even

question in this case.

We are not here contending that the

State is even a party, let alone the real party in interest.
We will live with that holding.
Q

Part of your assertion is that the county is not

equivalent to the State, even though it is a subdivision of the
State.
MR. GREENBERG:

That’s correct.

The State is clearly

8
not the real party in interest in this ease.
Turning next to -Q

What about corporations chartered by the State?
MR. GREENBERG:

They have long been held to be

citizens of the State for diversity jurisdiction purposes,
and the most recent enunciation by the California Supreme
Court has said that counties are quasi-corporations of that
nature.
Turning next to the Civil Rights Acts

jurisdiction

aspect of our appeal, I think you have to take it step by
step.
The first question is, does Section 1983 allow for
the doctrine of re. s pond la t superior?

That’s the first basic

question.
If one was to look at Hesselgesser v. Reilly,
McDaniel v, Carroll, Lewis v. Brautigara, clearly, it seems
that conceptually there is such allowance.
An additional case, which I would add, which is not
cited in our brief but which specifically discusses this point
is a case called Hill v. Toll, 320 Fed. Sup, 185, at pages
188 and 189, which involved Pennsylvania law.
Briefly, the court there addressed itself specifically
to the respondlat superior concept and said, in essence,
as regards this case, we note that the well settled doctrine
of yespondiat superior Is not expressly abolished by Section

9
1983» nor doss the legislative history make it clear that
Congress intended the doctrine not to apply to Section 1983*
Further, the salutary reason for Che doctrine’s
application to common law torts, i.c., the furnishing of a
deep pocket from which a claimant can collect, argues just 03
forcefully for its application to the cause of action created
by Section 1983.
And, conversely, we find that it is nowise less
appropriate to apply responrilat superior to Section 1983,
than to common law torts.
Accordingly, we now decide, consistent with
traditional injunction, that remedial statutes are to receive
a liberal construction, that respondiat superior is impliably
a part of the Civil Rights Act.
Now, once you accept that premise, you next look to
the source of that vicarious liability,
We are not here arguing today that the source of
that liability is Section 1983,
We are not here arguing that the source of that
vicarious liability is any other Civil Rights Act Federal l«r5
Rather, we are saying the source of that vicarious
liability is the California Tort Claims Act.

State law.

Just as the source of the sheriff’s vicarious
liability in Hesselgesser, the sheriff and surety's vicarious
liability in McDaniel, and the sheriff's vicarious liability in

10
Lewis, wore State law.
Q

Mo difference.

Are there some California cases that hold also that

the county may not be a plaintiff?

There must

he,

for

purposes of diversity jurisdiction,
I®. GREENBERG:

To ray knowledge , no case has been

cited to us and —• as a result of the Tort Claims Act, the
law says the county can sue and be sued,

We presume that when

it says a county can be sued, can sue, it means it can be a
plaintiff,
Q

Yes.
MR. GREENBERG: As well as defendant.
Specific authorisation was given in 1963 by the

California law for that.
Now, turning then to the source of liability, two
rather anomalous results would occur If the defendant’s
position is adopted.

They are as follows.

Up until 1963, California law was that the sheriff
was vicariously liable for the torts committed by his deputy.
A case called Reynolds v. Legman, 138, Cal.Ap.2d,
586, specifically held that.
When the Tort Claims Act was enacted in 1963, Section
820.8 was enacted,which specifically says that one public
employee cannot be vicariously liable for the acts of another
public employee, rather it is the employing public entity.
Now, the whole policy of the Tort Claims Act was

obviously to place ultimate financial responsibility where it
could best be realised, and to allow the party injured by a
public employee opportunity for meaningful redress.
Yet, if we adopt the defendant’s position, while
California sought to increase the likelihood that a plaintiff
might recover for the wrongs of a public employee, we would hav
the opposite effect in this case, because we would say, in
essence, that while we could have sued the sheriff vicariously,
under cases such as we have discussed, somehow we can’t sue
the county.
Q

Does the California Tort Claims Act have an exemption

or exception with respect to governmental discretionary
functions?
i®. GREENBERG:

No, and in this case, there would be

no such exception that would apply.
Q

Nell, do they have any in the Act itself?
HR, GREENBERG:

Q

If there

Is there one comparable to the Federal Tort Claims

Act, for example?
HR. GREENBERG:

Not to my knowledge.

Second, the logical result of the defendant’s
position is simply not only that a Federal court cannot impose
that State created liability, but because Congress did not
intend public erifcities to boar this ultimate liability, that
a State court can’t even impose it and, indeed, a State can’t

12
pass such a law.
And, yet, I cannot imagine that the defendants are
here even taking the position that California, as a matter of
its law, doesn’t have the authority, power, or what have you,
to pass a law saying that its public entities will be
vicariously liable for the torts of their employees, including
Civil Rights Act violations.
That’s a State law determination.

That’s a policy

determination.
And, the only next question then becomes,can a
Federal court also impose that State created liability?
To that, wo look fco 1988 in Section 1343.
How, 1988 is not a jurisdictional section.
doesn’t create any cause of action.

It

It doesn’t confer any

jurisdiction.
Title 28, 1343, confers jurisdiction on the Federal
courts to enforce, and, in the words of it, I believe, "any
act of Congress which is provided for the protection of civil
rights,”
Looking at Section 1988, if it is not an act of
Congress,

I

don't know what it is.

And if it wasn’t designed for the protection of
civil rights, I don't know what it was passed for.
It clearly falls within that language.
And, thus, there is no violation to Monroe, to 1983,

13
or to any other civil rights act provision, by saying that
the Federal court can utilise 1988 in the fashion it was
intended and have jurisdiction to impose that State created
liability.
This, then, brings me to the final jurisdictional
contention wo make, and, which is perhaps the most difficult.
That is, if we assume arguendo that, by some quirk,
1988 doesn’t mean what it says, that the California Tort Claims
Act can’t impose this vicarious liability, but can, at the same
time, impose vicarious liability for the State battery or
State negligence wrongs committed by the public employee,
can the county be joined as a pendent party on the pendent
State claims that are otherwise before the Court?
How, in a sense, we have something like an AstorHonor type analysis, because you do have a Federal statute which
can be construed along with pendent jurisdiction, really, to
bring about the result of joining the county.
But, taking it just in the abstract, for the moment,
we are concerned here xdfch the concept of judicial power, not
discretion,
There is no opinion from this Court that we are
aware of that has precisely discussed the joinder of a pendent
party.
The trend since Gibbs has been certainly that
pendent jurisdiction can be utilised, that the considerations

14
and policy which led fco Its liberalisation, they were further
liberalised in Rosado, and if the criteria otherwise
available for pendent jurisdiction, there is at least the
power fco join, perhaps, a pendent party.
How, in the Courts of Appeals, the Second, Third,
Fourth, Fifth and Eighth Circuit Courts of Appeals have
expressly recognised this judicial power.
The Sixth Circuit, by implication, lias recognised
this power.
Yet, the Minth Circuit stands alone.

It is the

only circuit,fco our knowledge, to expressly hold that pendent
jurisdiction does not allow for the joinder of parties, only
claims.
Taking this case, for the moment.

If we look to

the traditional test, does the claim arise out of a common
nucleus of operative fact?

Clearly, there isn’t even an

additional fact involved with respect to the county's Usa­
bility, because it is vicarious and dependent solely upon the
liability of the individuals.
Q

If you are right on the diversity jurisdiction point,

you don’t reach this, do you?
MR. GREENBERG:

That’s not correct.

Diversity is only in Moor.
One must get fco Civil Rights Act jurisdiction and/or
pendent jurisdiction —

15
Q

Pendent jurisdiction.
MR. GREENBERG:

That’s only in Moor., is it?

No, that’s in both.

Pendent jurisdiction, if we are correct on diversity
in Moor, then,in theory,the Civil Rights Acts

jurisdiction

contention and dependent party jurisdiction aspect taay not
have to be reached, although there would be an open question
as to whether or not, as to the Federal causes of action.
If the county was joined on diversity, it could —
there would still be potential liability.
Q

However,

What’s the other case?
MR. GREENBERG:

Randle.

They are companion cases.

They were consolidated for appeal.
Q

Say again, if you were right on

your diversity

point, then you don’t have to reach any of these other questions
in Moor, is that right?
MR. GREENBERG:

With the possible exception of 1988,

Civil Rights statutes.
Q

Why?
MR, GREENBERG:

Because

the diversity jurisdiction

question would leave open whether or not the county was
vicariously liable for the Civil Rights Acts,
Q

The whole question?
MR. GREENBERG:

That's correct.

one would not have to reach it.
Q

Oh,

And, in that sense,

Q

Why would we have fco reach in Bundle T assuming

we agree with you on your diversity question.
MR. GREENBERG:

Either or both.

The Civil Rights

Acts jurisdiction and -Q '

Because finding diversity jurisdiction in Moor

doesn't answer either question?
MR. GREENBERG:

Mo.

They are separate cases.

The plaintiffs in Bundle are California citlaens.

The

plaintiffs
Q

So there is no possibility of -- to find diversity

in their case?
MR. GREENBERG:
argued.

It was never even raised, never

Both of these people were shot at the same time, in

the same place, and perhaps with the same shot.
That's why the two cases were brought together.
They involve all of the same issues factually with respect
to ultimate liability,
The only distinction that Moor has is he is an
Illinois resident, and, as a result, we were able to raise the
diversity jurisdiction issue.
But Bundle has to be resolved by either a resolution
of Civil Rights Acts jurisdiction and/or pendent party juris­
diction.
Q

Would deciding

in your favor in one of those give

you all the relief to which you think you are entitled?

17
Clearly, If we decide on the basis — well, if ,you
decide that there is Federal jurisdiction, under the Civil
Eights Acts, then you really don}t have pendent party joinder
any more.

You just have traditional pendent jurisdiction

joinder, because now you are joining claims against whom you -~
a party -•*
Q

You already had a party in your 1983 action*
MR. GREENBERG:

Q

Right.

You must be suggesting you have to reach, in Randle,

pendent party, if you treat Moor as a proper diversity case.
MR. GREENBERG:
Q

Correct.

And then you have to get to the pendent party to

bring Ruadle in, if you lost out on the 1988 question.
MR. GREENBERG:
Q

To bring the county in,
MR. GREENBERG:

Q

Correc t.

Pardon?

To bring the county in.
MR. GREENBERG:

To bring the county, correct.

There are otherwise -- there are pendent State claims
now pending against the deputy and the other individuals.
Q

But just saying you can join a party through pendent

jurisdiction doesn’t tell us what kind of a claim that party
might have?

MR,

GREENBERG:

Ho.

One would think you would

clearly have the State law claims.

18
Q

Well, is that all you are saying?

Are you saying

that you can join the Federal claim?
MR. GREENBERG:

I asa saying, as follows, in this

order*
The scope of the Civil Rights Act covers both the
Federal and State claims*
There is no dispute that it covers the State claims,
and, for some unexplained reason, the defendants have not
briefed, in their brief to the Court, any argument that the
California law does not also cover the Federal claims.
So, perhaps, they have abandoned that.

'I don’t

know,
However, true pendent party joinder, in one sense,
would be only joining the county on the pendent State law
claims, without regard to the Federal claims.

Because, once

you say that the county also has vicarious liability for the
Federal claims, then, 1 think, you are clearly within —
you have to deal with 1588 — then you get into an independent
basis of Federal jurisdiction through 1343, because now you
are talking about imposing the vicarious Federal liability.
Q

Mr. Greenberg, if you prevail in Moor on diversity,

and also prevail on the pendent party point, why haven’t you
got everything you want?
MR. GREENBERG:

Oh, I'll have everything 1 want

whether --if X prevail on diversity and Civil Rights Acts

19
jurisdiction or pendent party,
Q

llo, pendent party only.

I sua asking you if you

prevail on diversity and your pendent party point, what more
do you want?

Why do you have to have Civil Rights jurisdiction

You've got the State law, then, don't you?
MR. GREENBERG:

Vicarious liability

It is all State law vicarious

liability that's being imposed*
Q

Well, don't you have enough?
MR. GREENBERG:

Correct.

If I could get the county

into the case.
Q

Mr. Greenberg, I suppose it is beside the point, but

would it have been possible for you to get everything you want
in a State court action?
MR* GREENBERG:

Theoretically, yes, because there

is concurrent jurisdiction of the Civil Rights Acts.
Q

I had missed the last —
MR. GREENBERG:

But, I think, we have tried to

explain to the Court in our brief that, given the nature of
this case, which involves Federal constitutional rights, if
there is a type of case that really should be brought in a
Federal court, 1 would think this is the type, and I don't
think

X think -- this Court has said before that merely

because you can go to the State court isn't grounds for denying
your choice of a Federal forum for adjudication of your
Federal constitutional rights.

20
Q

That’s trua, of course, in almost all theso eases,

but at least you wouldn’t be up here battling jurisdiction.

MR, GREENBERG:

Ko, but I might have been suosoarily

thrown out in the State court altogether.
Q

Mr, Greenberg, if you are right about State court’s

power under pendent jurisdiction, that’s a matter of power,
would you not still have the problem of whether or not the
court in its discretion did not have wide discretion in
refusing to exercise the power in a particular case?
MR. GREENBERG:

Mo question about it, tl^at if we

concede that the power exists, the next question is discretion.
However, I think any fair reading of the District
Court’s opinion in this case will show that it never reached
the discretionary aspect.

It specifically said the issue

is not one of discretion but rather lack of power.
The District Court further said he intimates no
view on how he would decide the case, if he was possessed of
the power, but because of Hyraer v. Chai, the Ninth Circuit
opinion, which specifically said there is no power for that
joinder, the District Court never reached that.
There would not be discretion, however, with respect
to Civil Rights Acts jurisdiction, if we are correct.
I reserve the rest of my time.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Mr. Davis.

Very well, Mr. Greenberg.

21
ORAL ARGUMENT OF FETER W. DAVIS, ESQ,3

ON BEHALF OF
«I?,. DAVIS:

Mr.

THE RESPONDENTS

Chief Justice,

and nay it please the

Court:

I think

the

analysis

of this issue must first

with plaintiff’s concessions, which
cannot state a cause of action

start

ere that ho has not ano

against the County of Alaiccda

under any Federal law.
He is only asking this Court to have a Federal court
hear State law, California causes of action against the
County

of.

Alameda,
And he is asking the Court for an expansion

Federal

of

jurisdiction in three regards.
Ho is asking the Court to incorporate an entire body

of California law through 1988, and then pretend that that’s
an act of Congress,within the meaning of Section 1343.
Re is asking the Court to expand the concept of

pendent jurisdiction to bring in a party defendant, not other­
wise before the court, against when;: no Federal cause of action
has been stated, just because there is a related cause of
action in the court against other parties.
And, third, in the Moor case only, he is stating that
there is diversity jurisdiction because the County of Alameda
is a "citizen" within the meaning of diversity jurisdiction,
Section 1332.

22
Taking the 1988 argument first, which is the most
difficult one, I think that there are at least three major
objections to bringing in a State body of law under that
section for the purpose of giving the Federal court juris­
diction of the State law cause of action.
First, from the language of the section itself, and
from

the reported decisions, it does not appear that Section

1988 was intended to create a cause of action»- in fact,
plaintiff concedes this — or intended to confer jurisdiction,
or intended to do any more, really, than provide supplementary
damage remedies to the District Court on a cause of action,
a case over which it already has jurisdiction against the
party over which it already has jurisdiction.
And the language of the section says, in itself,
statutes of the State wherein the court '‘having jurisdiction
of such civil or criminal causes held, shall be extended to
engovern said courts in the trial and disposition of the cause.'5
We submit that Section 1988 should not be used to
wholesale incorporate State law causes of action for torts of
any kind or vicarious responsibility —
Q

In 1983, in the light of Monroe and ?ape, there

could be no action against the county —
MR. DAVIS:
‘

Q

That's correct.

-- and, therefore, since there is no jurisdictional

proceeding against the county, you can't bring In 1988 to infuse

23
California law, is that it?
MR. DAVIS:
Q

Yes.

There is no Federal cause of action.
MR, DAVIS:

There is no Federal cause of action.

He is talking about bringing in a State law cause
of action.
Q

That's what 1 said.

There is no Federal cause of

act5.on under 1S83 against the comity,
MR, DAVIS:
Q

Right.

And they have admitted that.

Under Monroe and Parc.

And your argument, now, is that, therefore, there
is no jurisdiction in the sense required by 19SS before you
can draw on State law.
MR. DAVIS: That’3 correct,
I am saying that 1343 requires an act of Congress
and that's the jurisdictional statute.
And, using 1988 to incorporate an entire body of
State law, is not an act of Congress.

It is an act of the

State legislature.
Q

All right.
MR, DAVIS:

And, in addition to that, the. thing

it has not met at all, the arguments that you cannot use 1983
simply by its own terms,where there is an adequate remedy,
the Federal remedy is adequate, and you cannot use it to bring
in any inconsistent State law.

And, both of those considerations

24
are present here*
It has been pointed out in our brief and it is
pointed out by petitioner in his brief, what California did
in this ease, instead of providing for the direct liability of
public entities in this type of situation in 1983 suit, they
said that, where the employee requested, the county must
defend and indemnify the employee under Government Code
Sections 825 and 895,
In other words, it is an indirect assumption to
get at this principle of deep pocket, if you will, or provide
a responsible defendant.
And that has been done in this case, as alleged*
The county is conducting the defense of all the
employees.
Furthermore, it is also pointed out that the
employees have their own insurance of $200,000, or more.
Now, the argument raised here has been that the
employees are judgraent-proof.
And 1 submit that petitioners have been less than
candid with the court in tanking that kind of an assertion
because it is quite obvious that they — the defendants —
the individual defendants are not judgment-proof in any sense
of the word.
And plaintiff's remedy is perfectly adequate, under
Section 1983, 85, 86, against the five individual defendants.

25
And, that precludes application of State lav) under
Section 1988.
Furthermore, it has been held in Monroe, the
legislature, when it passed the 1871 Act, intended to exclude
public entities.
Now, the argument is made here that, well, if the
1981 Congress were transported to the 21st Century or the 20th
Century, and in light of the fact that son?e municipalities
and States have conditionally waived sovereign immunity, they
would have intended something different or passed a different
act.

But that’s not the point.
As was held in Rios v, Lynskey, what we are looking

at is what they intended at that time, and they intended at
that time to exclude public entities.
Their motive in doing so is not relevant to statutory
interpretation.
I think that point is very clearly established in
Monroe and I think it is binding here.
To bring in, then, the public entity through 1988,
is in derrogation of the intent of Congress.

It is clearly

against what Congress said they wanted to do at that time,
that is, exclude public entities.
And, for that reason also, then, 1988 could not be
used to incorporate this body of State law.
And, I would refer the Court also to the brief of the

26
District of Columbia in a related case of District of Columbia
v. Carter, which was recently reversed by this Court.

And,

he discussed at some length the motives of Congress, and there
are several references there.
X didn’t brief this at length because it was in his
brief and X didn’t want to duplicate it.
Finally, I would point out that Honroe has been on
the books for something like 12 years now, and in the interim
Congress has enacted several major Civil Eights legislations,
and has not changed the rule, and they have been asked to do
so.
And, I think, that is indicative of the situation.
I don’t think this Court should now try and change
the rules of municipal liability and civil rights actions.
If Congress wants to do so, then, that is up to them.
All right, second, as to the issue — I should point
out one other thing, too.
There really isn't any reason to make this kind of
a change.
Plaintiff not only has a remedy in State court, he
has acted on it.
There is a case pending in the State court with the
identical issues.

In fact, the complaint is identical.

Who were the defendants in that?

theoretical remedy at all.

It is not a

It is a very practical remedy

which he has taken advantage of.
Q

Who is the plaintiff?
MR. DAVIS:

Rundle.

Plaintiff Moor filed the claim, but maybe due to the
small sise of the case did not file a complaint.
Under California lav?, you have to file a claim first
and then file a complaint after its denied, if it is, and
that was done in both cases.
But a complaint was only filed on behalf of one
of the two plaintiffs.
Q

That is, under the Liability Act applicable to

municipalities and counties, you have to file a claim ffrsfc,
before you sue?
MR. MVIS: That is correct,under the Tort Claims Act.
Q

You mentioned this liability insurance earlier.

Enlarge a little on that, will you?
The county doesn't carry any —
MR, MVIS:

Outside of the record, all of the

individual defendants are Individually insured for, I believe
it is, $200,000 for one Injury or $500,000 or $800,000 for
all injuries.

28
There is individual insurance applicable- to all of
them.
And, that is in addition to the county having to
indemnify and defend the employees when they are requested to
do so.
low, this does not apply to punitive damages.

This

is to compensatory damages also.
And, as to the —
Q

Compensatory damages only?
MR. DAVIS:

Yes.

*

Typically, as a rule, it does not apply to punitive
damages, and the California Tort Claims Act so states.
Q

Is that a substitution for liability of the municipal

corporation or is it in addition to that?
MR. DAVIS:

In the case of a Federal Civil Rights

Act, X would take a position that it is in substitution for.
In the case of an act under the California Tort
Claims Act, it is in addition to.
Q

That's why the county is joined in the State court

action; I take it it's a proper party under California State
law?
MR. MVXS:

That's correct.

He is sued in California under California Tort Claims
Act, and joined to the county,
low, there are some issues as to whether the county

29
is responsible directly, under the Civil Rights action and
the State action, but since the county is a party anyway
under the State action, it makes no practical difference,
and that issue has not been asserted by the county so far
because it is of practically --of no significance at all.
The other thing I think it is appropriate to point
out is that, as has been discussed before, the -- It makes
more sense in a lot of ways to go at the indirect assumption
of liability and require in Federal Civil Rights cases that
the individual employees be located and served,
And, in my own experience, I found this to be true.
And this was pointed out by the court in Rie3 v. Lyaskey in
the Seventh Circuit, that when you bring in an individual
defendant, and you make him a defendant, and you take his
deposition and you make him attend the trial, it has a very
profound effect on him.

It has a very sobering effect on him,

win or lose,
Whereas, if you allow plaintiffs to sue an
amorphous public entity the individual employees do not seem
to feel so responsible for their own actions, that there is
somebody out there that's going to take care of this, and
they don't have to worry about it.
Q

That leaves the alternative of suing them both, and

achieving both —
MR. DAVIS:

Well, that's also possible, but9

30
as a practical matter, if you allow suit against the public
entity, you don’t get suits against the individual as often.

Q

Didn't you say the counties are joined with the

policemen in the State action?
MR. DAVIS:

In this particular case, they are, but

in many, many cases they are not.
Q

They just sue the county.

Clear up one thing for me.

You said the insurance

does not cover punitive damages.
Does the obligation of the county to indemnify the
employees cover punitive —
MR, DAVIS:

Ho, it specifically excluded under

Section 318 of the Government Code,
Q

And the Tort Claims Act, I gather.
MR. DAVIS:

Q

That’s part of the Tort Claims Act, yes

In other words, if it is something that generates

punitive damages, the policeman is on his own frolic.

Or the

employee is on his own?
MR. DAVIS:

That’s correct, the feeling being that

punitive damages are not to compensate but to punish and that
they won’t punish unless the individual defendant, himself,
feels them.
In other words, they would have to be awarded
against him, individually.
To answer one of your earlier questions, Chief
Justice Burger, there is a discretionary immunity section -»

31
Q

Could you raise your voice a little?
MR. CAVIS:

Q

I am sorry.

I think if you get more nearly the center of that

microphone,*
MR. DAVIS:

I am sorry.

There is a discretionary immunity section in the
Tort Claims Act, being Government Code Section 820.2, in
response to your earlier question -Q

Is it essentially like that of the Federal Act?
MR. DAVIS:

Q

Yes, Your Honor, it is.

Well, are you suggesting that might reach all police

action by the county?
IE. DAVIS:

In this case?

Ho.

But I do suggest it does reach a considerable amount
of the claims against the superior officers.
One final issue on this point, and that is whether
California does provide a direct right of action.
And, I think that it can most clearly be seen that
it does not by reference to the California Law Revision
Commission statement which was referred to by plaintiff in
his brief.
Q

What difference does that make right here?
If you are right so far, docs it make any difference?
MR. MVXS:

Yes.

Ho, it does not.

If I may, though, Mr. Justice White, read.

32

5’The issue relevant to the present study, of course,
is whether public entities, notwithstanding their immunity from
direct liability, under the Civil Rights Act, should assume
financial responsibility (whether through payment of insurance
premiums to protect their personnel, or through assumption
of payments of judgments against such personnel) for violations
by their police officers of that Act.
HBy analogy to suggestions offered earlier,it is
believed that considerations should be given to adoption of
statutory procedures under which entities in California would
be required to assume ultimate financial responsibility for
such torts of their police officers."
And, that's precisely what they did under Section
825 and 895.
How, plaintiff says they did not specifically
exclude 1983 actions.

But you have to recall that this is

in the wake of kfonroe v. Pape, and, as they discussed there,
the legislature knew they were already excluded.

There

wasn't any reason to make a supra or an extra exclusion for
that point.
Uhafc they did do is provide, through 825 and 895,
to defend and indemnify in such actions, instead of having the
public entity a direct defendant in the Federal court.
There is also the point present here that putting
the public entity directly into a Federal 1983 action would

seriously complicate the jury instructions. I believe, that
would be present in the case.
As 1 pointed out in our brief, there are a large
number of defenses and immunities that are applicable under
the California action, which then would become present in the
Federal case as to the entity.
Mow, petitioner properly points out that under the
pendent jurisdiction claims against the employees, some, but
not all, of these defenses would be present anyway.
It seems to me that you are going to have a situation
where you arc going to tell a jury that as to the Federal
causes of action you have these three defenses applicable,
and as to the State law causes of action, you have these four
or five others applicable, as to the employees.
But, as to the public entity, you have sisj others
applicable whether it is a State law or Federal law cause of
action, and then you are going to tell the jury that the
public entity can only be held liable vicariously through the
State.
And the jury is going to say, "Hhae are you trying
to say?"
It is a ridiculous situation.

And it is an

unnecessary situation to overly complicate the case.
X feel that a jury given that kind of instructions
cannot pos slbiy follow the law.

34
Q

How, let’s see.

This is an argument addressed to

the second point of pendent parties?
MEL DAVIS:

That would also be an argument

addressed to the discretion issue on the pendent parties, but
I think it is an argument that’s present here, when plaintiff
says he wants to bring in State law causes of action whole­
sale through 1988.
I think it is not only unnecessary, but it is
unwise.
Q

What about diversity?
MR. DAVIS:

On Mr, Moor?

Diversity is a problem,

I think, logically -Q

But you would agree it’s not a question in Bundle's

case?
MR. DAVIS:

That’s correct.

I think, logically, as pointed out by the
Constitution statutes of the State and by the County of Marin
case cited, that a county is simply a public —
Q

Let me get it straight.

If they say there is

diversity here with respect to Moor, and assume that you
won in Handle, could Rundle1s case be pendent to Moor's?
Your argument would take care of that, too, I suppose.
MR. DAVIS:

That’s close to the situation in

Hatridge.
You mean if the county is properly in the Moor case

35
under diversity, are they then pendent, because the cases are
consolidated?
And, I agree, that makes
Q

a much

tougher case.

If you are wrong on diversity, then, does -- do we

have to face up to —

BUR, DAVIS:

Yes, X would take the position that

it*s ».> even though it makes more sense in that situation than
in the instant situation, I think that it still is an extension
of pendent jurisdiction which is not authorised.
Q

In the discretionary sense, ought we decide that

here?
If you are wrong on diversity, should we decide
the pendent question hero?
MR, DAVIS:
Q

The pendent question, correct, yes.

I know, but should we decide it here or should we

send it back?

If you are wrong on diversity, should we 3end

it back and let the court below decide it?
MR. DAVIS:

You’d have to decide whether there is

power, in any event.
As to whether there is discretion, I think that the
Ninth Circuit has said that, as a matter of discretion, they
would keep it out, clearly, and they also indicated they felt
the District Court thought that it should be kept out, as a
matter of discretion, and I agree with that.
Q

It is my understanding that in order for there to be

36
diversify jurisdictions ali of the plaintiffs have to be of
diverse citizenship from all of the defendants»

And once you

have plaintiff and defendant who do not have diverse citizen­
ship, diversity is defeated.
Q

They are separate suits, aren’t they?
MR. DAVIS:

They are separate suits but they have

been consolidated.
Q

Does that mean you destroy Federal jurisdiction?
I mean, you would throw the case out on diversity,

entirely, then, if that were true.
MR. DAVIS:

That point has not been argued, but it

makes sense to mo and I would agree with it, that if the
cases are consolidated, then, there would not be complete
diversity since *■Q

You have a defendant and a plaintiff from the same

State, citizens of the same State, then you don't have diversity
jurisdiction?
MR. DAVIS:
Q

That is correct.

Neither party moved for consolidation, did they?
Didn’t the court do it for convenience, or what?
MR. DAVIS:

These were all assigned,under the

related case rule, to the same judge.
Q

Related.

Does that mean every time there is a

related case you destroy Federal jurisdiction?
MR. DAVIS:

No, but I believe the cases were also

37
consolidated,
Q

By whom?
HR. DAVIS:

X believe ~~ X am sorry, Your Honor,

I am a little shakey on the record, but I believe that it was
a motion of plaintiff.
Q

How can you consolidate a diversity case with

another case and then thereby defeat the diversity case?

How

can you do that?
HR. DAVIS?

Federal jurisdiction is limited and if

the case falls within or without the purview of the juris­
dictional statutes, the chips have to fall as they may.
Q

But if cases are consolidated, don’t they each stand

on their individual merits?
MR, DAVIS: Conceptually, I don’t know what the
difference is between two individual actions with identical
complaints, except for the diversity point in one, which are
consolidated, and one complaint that has both in it.

And, under

the -Q

They were consolidated in one complaint?
MR, DAVIS:

Consolidated in one action, with two

separate complaints which say the same thing.
Q

Well, that’s a lot different.
MR. DAVIS:

Is it really conceptually different,

as a practical matter —
Q

I am not talking about conception.

I am talking about

38
actually.
Well, did they each have a separate docket number?
ME. DAVIS:
Q

Yes.

Well, aren’t they then individual cases?
MR. DAVIS:

Technically, 1 think that they are,

except -Q

Wouldrr t

the fact that they are consolidated for

the purpose of convenience defeat one on diversity?
MR.. DAVIS:
Q

I think that it is possible.

Well, suppose «e both sue General Motors for some­

thing and I -- mine is on diversity, yours is not.

So they

consolidate the too cases and throw me out of court?
Q

Well, that may be so, but if I want to come in and

say I am pendent and say I want to be part of this lawsuit,
that’s different, isn't it?

Then you are in one lawsuit.

It is not just a question of consolidation you are claiming,
if you are claiming you are pendent.

You can't have it both

ways,
MR. DAVIS:

I think in your case, Mr, Justice White,

that’s very true.
Q

Did anybody argue the Sfcrawbridge v. Curtis fc>oint in

the lower courts, their complete diversity of plaintiffs -MR. DAVIS:

On a consolidated issue, no.

But, of course, jurisdiction can be raised at any
point, and could be raised by this Court.

39
On the pendent jurisdiction point again* 1 think
that, again, we have to start with the rather axiomatic
propos —
Q

You started fco say something about in California a

county is simply, and at that point something else Intervened.
Bo you want to finish that?
MR. DAVIS:

I think that in California, whatever the

situation might be in other States, the California law makes it
clear that a California county is simply a subdivision of the
State, and has whatever powers the State delegates Co it,
low, as against the State, the county has no powers,
whatsoever, as has been made clear in the cases cited.
In other words, if the State wants to take property
away from the county, they just simply do it.

No compensation,

nothing.
As to third parties, the county stands in the shoes
of the State, and that’s also in the cases.
For example, in the one case mentioned, the county
took some action which should properly have been taken by the
State, and the court said no, the county is simply an agent of
the State, stands in the State’s shoes and is perfectly capable
of taking this action.
Now, when you are talking about citizenship, which
is what we are talking about under 1332, and I would oppose
that to the concept of State,as in the Elet*enth Amendment, I

40
think this is something different*
I fail to see how you can say that a county is a
citizen of the State under those circumstances*
Xt seems to me you have to make some basic divisions
between Government and citizens.

And the kinds of things that

are given to citizens, like the power to hold property, and
like the power to vote, are not in the county, under any
stretch of the imagination.
Q

(inaudible) San Francisco -~
MR. DAVIS:

No, not as to the city.

Cities are different.

Cities are entirely different

in California than counties.
Q
counties?

Arc you saying that this is unique to California
And do you think that this is behind the Court of

Appeals for the Ninth Circuit's decisions in this area, even
though not articulated?
MR. DAVIS:

I think it must be.

At least In this case, all of these arguments were
presented to the court, and they refused to change their earlier
ruling and insisted that California counties are different.
Q

As I understand your argument, your major premise,

that there is a relationship between the State of California and
its counties, whatever it may be other ways, which makes the
county simply an alter ego of the State ~~
MR. DAVIS:

Makes it not a citizen of the State.

41
Q

All right, not a citizen.

Mow, has that over been

said by -the Hinth Circuit?
Mo DAVIS:

They have said just what you said.

They have not gone on at great length and explained why.
Q

Ordinarily, of course, we accept here, as you know,

what a Court of Appeals says as State law, but are we in that
position with this one, on this issue?
MR. DAVIS j

The plaintiff has pointed out authorities

to the effect that whether it is a citizen or not is a matter
of Federal law, and not State law, although, of course, you'd
look very properly to the State law to determine that question.
Q

So far, everything you've told us about California

counties, I think, could have been said about the counties in
any State that I know about.

You haven’t told us anything that’s

uniquely characteristic of California counties.
MR. DAVIS:

I am not sure what the status of counties

in other States is.
Q

I am not 3ure, certainly, with respect to every State,

but the States I am familiar with are just as you've told us
California is, are creatures of the State.
MR. DAVIS:

The decisions I‘ve read haven't given

any greater analysis to this, either, including Cowles.

They've

just said, they look at some language like corporate and that's
as far as they go, and they say, okay, must be a citizen
because a corporation is a citizen.

42
I find that, I think a little more analysis is in
order.

I think that the concept of a citizen could apply to

a. municipal corporation* And I really don't have much difficulty
with that, because they are different, they are not a sub­
division of the State. They are a corporation, which does
govern, but they hold their own property.
rights.

They have their own

A county doesn't have that in California.

I think it

is a different entity.
It seems to rao, logically, difficult -Q

Who owns the county courthouse in California?

What

entity owns it?
MR. DAVIS:

According to the County of Marin case,

it is owned by the State.
If the State says, "That's our courthouse.

We are

going to sell it tomorrow," they can do it.
The judges are State, for example.
county — it is Superior

They are not

Court in and for the County of

Alameda, and they are called Alameda Superior Court judges,
but the analysis of the situation indicates that they are State
judges.

They are paid by the State and are responsible to the

State.
Q

Your cities are not creatures of the State?
MR. DAVIS:

Cities are creatures of the State under

different constitutional provisions and under different legis­
lative provisions, and they have different powers and different

43

duties than the counties.
Q

Did you say cities are incorporated?
MR. DAVIS:

Q

And counties are not?
MR. DAVIS:

of the word.
Q

Yes.

I don't think — not in the same sense

Ho.

Doesn't the county put up part of the judges1

salary, or does it come entirely from the State?
MR. DAVIS:

I am not sure, Justice Rehnquist* but

I believe that —I was told that they were paid by the State.
I haven't really researched the point.
Q

I am sorry.

Are your school districts citizens, for purposes of

the diversity clause?
MR. DAVIS:

’ School districts, assuming that they

are all the same, and I don’t know that, would be, again, a
legislative creature only.

Nothing, enacted under different

laws -Q

So, your answer is yes?
MR, DAVIS:

Q

San Francisco would be under Monroe end Pape,
MR* DAVIS:

on that.

Probably would be yes.

I am going to have to back up a minute

It just occurred to me there are two or three cities

and counties and San Francisco is one of those.

So, San

Francisco happens to be an exception that comes under both.
In this case, it is not.

The County of Alameda is

44
completely separato from any of the cities and municipalities
within the county,

I believe Los Angeles is the other.

As to the other rights that have been enumerated,
for example, the right to sue or be sued, the State has the
identical right.
I don’t see how that can ?:eally be a distinction
between whether you are a citizen or not.
In fact, all the rights that are talked about here
are State rights that are delegated to the count}?.

So, how

does that make the county a citizen of the State?
I feel it does not.
On the pendent point then, I feel that there is
a major difference between joining causes of action among
a defendant already subject to

Federal jurisdiction and

between bringing in a defendant into the Federal court on a
State law cause of action,when there is no Congressional or
constitutional authority to bring that particular defendent
in.
I can readily appreciate the reasoning in Gibbs,
which is judicial economy and expediency, but I think that one
of the very few checks on the Federal judiciary today is the
power of Congress to define jurisdictional limits of the
District Court.
And I would respectfully suggest that this Court
should go slow in extending, on your own, the concept of

45

jurisdiction to include another party, not previously in front
of the court.
X think that there is also merit to Mr. ShackmanTs
argument, in 20 Stanford Law Review,. that State questions should
be left to the State courts in many cases.

And X think in

this particular case, Chief Justice Burger brought up the
discretionary immunity point.
There is the point of Section 820.4 of the Government
Code which says there is no liability to a public employee in
exercising due care in tho enforcement of lav? except for false
arrest or false imprisonment.
I think that these are questions that are difficult
questions that should be left to the State courts and not to
the Federal courts.
As Mr, Shackman points out, if the State court makes
an error, this Court can review it.
Xf the Federal court makes an error, the State lias
absolutely no opportunity to review that or to correct the
error.
And X think there are some very good reasons why
it should not be extended in that regard.
But, basically, I think we are talking about a
separation of powers problem, and X think that you are going
to have to draw the line some place on what kinds of claims can
be brought into Federal court when there is no Congressional

46
authority for that*
And I would draw the line here, when you are talking
about bringing in another party who is not already in front of
the court, and that is the situation here*
t think the ninth Circuit was correct in these
points, and X would like to suggest that their action should
be affirmed*

Don’t they claim that if Moor is a good diversity

You couldn’t make the

No.

Rundle must stand or fall on

the Civil Rights Acts and pendent jurisdiction points.
Q

As soon as it became pendent, there would no longer

be jurisdiction of the Federal court, isn’t that correct?

47
MR. GREENBERG:

Oh, no.

The whole concept of

pendent jurisdiction implies that a court has jurisdiction -~
Q

Yes, but the whole concept of diversity jurisdiction

is that all the plaintiffs are diverse in citizenship from all
the defendants, and, if they are not,there is no jurisdiction
of a Federal court.

Except some Courts of Apreals have

sure gotten around that point, and pended some claims of
citizens of same States once they had jurisdiction of the entire

A second point that I think we should dispel

13

that if the Court will look at the opinion attached to our

case, you will see that discretionary acts is not even an issue.
The court has completely rejected those for these individuals.
Number three, -Q

According to that, you said that Ninth Circuit is

responsible for consolidating these cases for appeal only.
When, as, and if you should get back, you mean you are going to
undertake, if you can, to try these cases entirely separately?
MR. GREENBERGi
that's their posture.

At the moment, that is correct, and

They are separate cases to be tried

separately.

They have not been consolidated for trial or

for any other purpose except this appeal by the Ninth Circuit
in its order, at our request, to bring the cases on.

Of course, they will especially be tried separately

No question about that.

MR. GREENBERG:

No, the State court action, Your Honor, was filed

In 15 Am. Jur, Trial, Section 26, at pages

For that reason, we wanted to protect our client.

A former associate of ours did some research in the
area and concluded that we had no problem a3 to diversity so
we filed the Moor case only in the Federal court.
However, because of the unknown factors in Rundle

The Federal case has been the case.

We have filed

Q

There are two Federal cases, Rundle and Moor,

Right, but we are talking about

Rundle because it's got the companion State case.
Q

MR. GREENBERG: I would hate to think that our client

in Rundle would be prejudiced by our seeking to protect him and
to obviate,the very thing that we are trying to obviate, having
to go to two courts with the same case,

Q

I say you would have avoided all this had you gone

full steam ahead on the State side.
MR. GREENBERGj Just as in any pendent jurisdiction
case or diversity case, I suppose.
Sure.

We had that option, but we chose the Federal

forum because we felt we would get — there are many factors
which dictated our going into the Federal forum, and I would -de jure —■ there were balancing factors.
You could get to trial faster in Federal court,

There were many factors.

The Federal judiciary was much more familiar with
the Civil Rights Acts, we thought»

the county, it is just a falacy.

The same defenses which are

available to the county are available to the individual employee
defendants.
We have to satisfy our right to sue the county in
order to sue the individuals.
These same instructions are going to be a part o£
this case.
And, with respect to insurance, there is nothing in
thi3 record which shows that these employees have insurance of
any sort.
I can tell you, as a fact, that the officer that
shot my client is making approximately $8,000 a year and doesn^t
have any insurance, to our knowledge.
The county carries insurance.

They are the only ones

we know of that carry insurance, aside from Sheriff Mattigan who
has a smaller bond of some $25,000.

51
But there is nothing in this record showing that
these dependents are financially able to respond to the kind of
judgment we are seeking in this case.
Q

Hone whatsoever.

Or the contrary.
MR. GREENBERG:

But they are not.

was never raised as a point.

Ho, this . really

Indeed, I think, common sense

would say that the deep pocket in this case is unquestionably
the county.
Moreover, under California law, in order to sue
other counties —
Q

Isn't the Government basis, as far as the record

is concerned, that the counties are usually richer than
anybody, any individual?
MR. GREENBERG:
Q

I think that's a fair assumption.

That's your argument, and that's all you've got.

You have no evidence on that,
MR. GREENBERG:

True,

Ho, and perhaps the Court can take judicial notice
of it, that the county has a deeper pocket than the deputy that
shot ray client.
However, with respect to another important reason
for a judgment against the county, in California, if you want
to sue other counties who participated in a particular act,
you must get a judgment against one county.
In connection with the Peoples Park disturbances,

52
there were a number of counties involved in that situation.
Only if we procure a judgment against the County of
Alameda, can we then sue these other counties, which we would
intend to do*
And finally, on Congressional intent,
I have found nothing that even remotely indicates
that Congress intended not only not to impose liability, as a
result of the Sherman Amendment to Bates, not only did not
intend,as a matter of Federal law, to impose liability, but went
further and said, "He intend to preclude a State from imposing
vicarious liability on its public entities,"
1 think that kind of Congressional Intent is pure
fabrication.

It is not found in the debates and it's not found

in Monroe.
Q

It is found in the decision in Monroe v, Pape, isn’t

it?
MR. GREENBERG:

Mo.

Monroe says,and Monroe was

concerned only with 1983 liability, Footnote 2 of that opinion
makes clear that the only section that was before the court

~~

and the court held that on the basis of the Sherman Amendment
debates, Congress did not intend to impose liability by virtue
of 1983.
Q

Didn’t the court also say that a city was not a

person, within the meaning of 1983?
MR, GREENBERG:

That’s correct, within the meaning

53

of 1983, for purposes of Imposing Federal liability*
Q

Right*
MR, GREENBERG:

That’s not our position here»

He

say there is nothing in Monroe and nothing in the Congressional
debates, or any other place that we know of, which cays that
Congress also didn’t — intended to preclude a State, as a
matter of its law, from imposing that liability.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Greenberg.

Thank you, Mr. Davis.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 2s31 o’clock, p.ni., the oral
arguments in the above-entitled case were concluded.)
