MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

We will hear arguments

next in 71-673* Executive Jet Aviation against Cleveland, and
others.
Mr. Bostwick, you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PHILLIP D. BOSTWICK * ESQ.*
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. BOSTWICK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
This case, on certiorari to the Sixth Circuit,
calls upon this Court to resolve an irreconcilable conflict
between the Third Circuit and an opinion in the court below.
The issue presented is whether the federal courts
have maritime jurisdiction over airplane crashes in navigable
waters where the tortious conduct is alleged to have occurred
on land.
The facts in this case are virtually undisputed.
The petitioners are the owners and operator of a corporate
twin-engine jet aircraft,' known as the Falcon.

They and

their aircraft were prepared to take off from the Burke
Lakefront Airport at Cleveland, Ohio, in July of 1968.

Burke

Lakefront is owned and operated by the respondent. City of
Cleveland, Ohio, and is built on a fill in the navigable
waters of Lake Erie.
On the day in question, the aircraft was piloted

4
by two pilots, and had a crew of one stewardess.

It was

prepared to take off to pick up passengers in Maine»
Theire is some question in the record as to the
clearance given to the pilots before takeoff.

It is our

position that the questions of negligence and contributory
negligence not being before this Court, those matters are
irrelevant; however, they have been raised in the respondents'
\

briefs»
In any event, there is no question about the fact
that the pilots did not see —■ could not see the other end of
the runway before takeoff, could not see that the last third
of the runway was covered by a flock of sea gulls, and did
receive a clearance for takeoff from the Air Traffic
Controllers in the tower, from respondent Dicken, who was
employed by the United States Government.
The aircraft took off.

Shortly after liftoff, the

pilots noticed for the first time a sea of sea gulls.

perimeter fence and broke the barbed wire of the perimeter
fence.

And there is an appendix of photographs to this case

which shows the damage done to the vehicle and.the fence, and
the birds on the runway, for whatever use it may be to the
Court»
In any event, the aircraft continued in flight and
impacted in the navigable waters of Lake Erie,

When airborne

again it impacted a second time, where it sank in what has
been undisputed as navigable waters, something of a depth in
excess of 45 feet.
There is also a photograph, I believe it's photograph

The pilots and the stewardess miraculously were not injured or
killed.

They exited from the aircraft, and a small craft

picked them up.

The Coast Guard came.

There was an effort

made to put a line around the aircraft and pull it towards
shore, and the place where they succeeded in dragging it is
the second X on the photograph,
QUESTION; This was a jet, right?
MR. BOSTWICK:

It was a jet, yes, sir.

It was a

corporate jet, a small Falcon jet, owned by Executi\*e Jet
Aviation, and used for purposes of transporting business and
other persons on business,
QUESTION;
the crew?

Were there any other persons aboard but

6
MR. BOSTWICK: The crew were deadheading, if the
Court please, to pick up some revenue-paying passengers at
another airport.

It had been positioned at Burke Lakefront

Airport.
The aircraft was salvaged, after remaining sub­
merged in the lake for two days.

Skin divers were used, a

contract barge was used, and the aircraft was raised.

It

was dropped back into the lake during raising, and additional
damage was done.
In any event, when it had been retrieved from the
lake, after over two days, the extensive water soaking to
the expensive avionics and navigational equipment, the
instruments, and to the interior of the aircraft, the impact
damage which had been done to the fuselage of the aircraft
by the two impacts with the lake caused the aircraft to be a
total loss.
And there is no dispute in this case of two factss
one, that the aircraft did crash in navigable waters of Lake
Erie; and, two, that as a result of that crash in the lake,
the aircraft was totally destroyed.
Two actions were brought by the petitioners in the
federal court in Cleveland.

One against the United States,

under the Tort Claims Act, alleging negligence of the Air
Traffic Controllers in clearing the aircraft for takeoff.
Because diversity was not existent between the

7
petitioners, a Columbus, Ohio,, corporation and ihe City of
Cleveland, the owner and operators of the airport, a second
action was filed in federal court against the City of
Cleveland and Respondent Dicken, also a resident of Ohio,
alleging admiralty and maritime jurisdiction.
are virtually identical.

The complaints

A motion to consolidate for

discovery and all purposes, including trial, was made by the
respondents.
The City of Cleveland moved, nearly three years ago,
to dismiss the second action on the ground of no subject
matter jurisdiction.
The district court, after six months, decided that
there was no subject matter jurisdiction for two reasons?
One, the locality of the tort was over land.

The district

court relied on a Sixth Circuit case entitled Wiper v. Great
Lakes Engineering Company.

As an alternative holding, the

district court found that there was no maritime nexus between
the wrongs alleged in the complaint and any maritime
commerce, navigation, or service, relying on the Sixth Circuit
case of Chapman v. Grosse Point Farms.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

I think we’ll resume at

that point after lunch, counsel.
MR. BOSTWICK; Thank you very much.
[Whereupon, at 12:00 noon, the Court was recessed,
to reconvene at 1:00 p.m., the same day.]

AFTERNOON SESSION
[Is 01 p.ra.]
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

Mr. Bostwick, you may

continue.
MR. BOSTWICK; Thank you, Your Honor.
The court below in this case, with one judge
dissenting, affirmed the holding of the district court in so
far as the court had ruled that the locality of the tort was
over land.

However, in so doing, it did not follow its own

cases, but said this case was controlled by three cases from
this Court, decided in 1928 and 1935.

Minnie v. Port Huron,

Smith & Son v. Taylor, and The Admiral Peoples.
The court below said that it was not necessary to
reach the question of maritime nexus,having found that the
locality of the tort was on land.
It's our position — our argument is twofold, and
it is that there is an irreconcilable conflict between the
opinion of the court below on the question of the locality
of the tort in this case and the Third Circuit's ruling in
Weinstein; and we urge that this Court resolve that conflict
by adopting the Weinstein rule.
We also urge that as to the question of maritime
nexus, this Court follow the course that it took in 1914 in
Atlantic Transport v. Imbrovek, and find that if anything more
than the locality of the tort is required, that the relation-

9

ship between this tort and maritime affairs was quite
sufficient.
Turning first with regard to locality of the torts
The Sixth Circuit in this case, relying upon the three cases
chat I just mentioned, found that the rule was, as to the situs
of a tort, that the situs of a tort is where the negligence
becomes operative or effective on the party, not where the
damages or the major portion of them are sustained.
Under this legal rule, the court found that the
negligence became operative when the birds first went through
the engine and caused the loss of power to the aircraft, and
that that occurred over the runway? therefore the locality of
the tort in this case, the court found, was on land.
In so doing, the Sixth Circuit said that this ruling
did not conflict with the Third Circuit decision in 1963,
in Weinstein v. Eastern Airlines, found at 316 Fed 2d.
We respectfully submit that that portion of the
court's opinion is unsupportable.

The facts of the Weinstein

case, one of the 150 cases to reach the federal courts,
arising out of the Boston Harbor tragedy in the early 1960's,
are virtually identical to this case.

In the Boston Harbor

tragedy, the facts of which are reported in Rapp v. Eastern
Airlines, an Eastern Airlines Electra took off from Logan
Airport, and six-tenths of a mile from the takeoff end of the
runway it ran into a flight of starlings.

The birds were

10

ingested into the engines, which were jet engines, driving
propellers; 50 to 100 dead birds were found on the end of the
runway.

The birds caused an immediate loss of power, and

the aircraft crashed thereafter in the navigable waters of
Boston Harbor 47 seconds after liftoff.
The libelants brought libels in admiralty, and the
respondents claimed that there was no jurisdiction.

The

district judge, Judge Van Dusen, found that the stuff of
admiralty concerned vessels; that in the absence of any
legislation by Congress concerning aircraft crashes in
navigable territorial waters, that the admiralty did not
have jurisdiction.
On appeal to the Third Circuit, the Third Circuit
reversed that narrow view.
In an opinion written in 1963 by Chief Judge Biggs,
which has been cited and quoted for nearly a decade thereafter,
the Third Circuit held that "concepts of admiralty tort
jurisdiction could not and should not remain static and
unchanging.”
In a review of the lav/, the court noted that the
first aircraft crash cases arose out of the Death on the High
Seas Act, and that the same arguments had been made, to wit,
that the Act did not apply to aircraft crashes.

That view

had been rejected.
Now, in this first case of the crash into territorial

11
navigable waters, Chief Judge Biggs found that the applicable
precedent from this Court was The Plymouth, and that the
historic view of this Court, indeed, as expressed against by
this Court last term in Victory Carriers v. Law, was that the
locality of the tort determined whether or not it was of a
maritime nature.
In determining where a tort occurs, Chief Judge
Biggs looked at The Plymouth, a case from this Court, which
held that a tort occurs where the damages are completed or
a substantial amount of the damages are completed? and The
Plymouth held that the maritime jurisdiction depends upon
the locality where the injuries or the substantial portion of
them take place.
Having concluded that The Plymouth was the applicable
authority, the Third Circuit found that even though the alleged
negligence in the Boston Harbor tragedy was alleged negligent
maintenance on land and defective design of the aircraft, that
the, quote,"disastrous effects", close quote, of that tortious
conduct had occurred on navigable waters.

That is to say,

the crash itself, the damage to the aircraft, the injury and
the death to the passengers therein, had occurred on navigable
waters.
It therefore found, in a case virtually identical
to this on a factual situation, that the tort occurred in
navigable waters and therefore it was a maritime tort.

It was

12
argued to the Third Circuit that a maritime nexus was also
required in addition to locality, and that no nexus should
be found in a case in which an aircraft, which was headed from
Boston to Philadelphia, virtually all over land, had crashed
fortuitously in the waters of Boston Harbor.
That view was rejected by the Third Circuit on the
reasoning that there is an analogy between aircraft which go
down in navigable waters and ships which sink in navigable
waters.

And they found that there is a connection, there is

a similarity, and that the dangers to person’s property are
the same when an aircraft crashes in navigable waters.
Therefore, they assumed, for purposes of argument,
that if there was such a locality plus requirement, that it
was present in that case, and therefore they held that there
was maritime jurisdiction.
Certiorari was denied by this Court.
That case has been followed and cited in nearly a
decade, since it was passed down.
QUESTION:

That means that if you fly from New York

or Washington to Miami or Palm Beach, Florida, at varying
times you’re under admiralty, maritime jurisdiction or under
conventional common-lav? jurisdiction?
MR. BOSTWICK: Well, Mr, Chief Justice, —
QUESTIONn

If you’re out over the sea, a good deal

of the time on that trip, aren’t you?

13
MR. BOSTWICK: We believe that the jurisdictional
point arises if there is a crash on that flight.

There was

sorae discussion in the early days of aviation concerning
whether the airspace above the entire earth as well as the
sea was subject to maritime jurisdiction, but, as a matter of
fact, the Federal Aviation Act is based upon the commerce
clause, and the regulations which affect aircraft passing
over States and over water and land is based upon that clause.
But where there is a crash on that flight, whether it is beyond
one marine league from the shore, whether it is 2400 yards
off the Florida coast, as was the case in Kelly, or whether
it is next to the Miami Airport, to the closest navigable
water on takeoff or landing.

If the crash occurs in navigable

water, it is our position that this Court should find and
enunciate the following rule:
That when an aircraft crashes in navigable water,
tort claims arising therefrom are cognizable in admiralty.
The reason we urge that is that we believe it to be the
more practical, the simpler, and the more just and efficient
rule for aviation cases.

And we — it is our position, and

it was so held by the Third Circuit and stated, we think,
artistically by Judge Edwards in the dissent in this case,
that we believe that -— excuse me, let me start over again,
my syntax is a little too long.
QUESTION;

Let me interrupt you right there.

What

14
would logically follow from that sort of a holding, other
than just the law governing the crash?

Would you have a

doctrine of unseaworthiness or unairworfchiness or airplanes
where, say, a crew member sli-ped, without there ever being a
crash, if it happened over water, that he would have a claim
under the Seas Shipping vs» Sieracki, and that sort of case?
MR. BOSTWICK; Well, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, what
would follow, we say, is that the general maritime law would
be applicable, and that, as has gone on for the past thirty
years in those aircraft crashes beyond a marine league from
the shore, the Death on the High Meas Act would be applicable.
QUESTION; But what if you don't have a crash at all?
Supposing just while the plane is navigating over Biscayne
Bay, coming into Miami, some crew member slips and falls —
nothing ever happens to the plane except it lands at Miami.
But if that slip and fall occurs over navigable water, does
t hat mean it's an admiralty type of injury?
MR. BOSTWICK: There is a case like that, Your Honor,
it's D'Aleman, it*s a Second Circuit case; I believe it's
cited in the government's brief.

And a person did suffer a

fright on a flight from Puerto Rico to the United States
over water and died thereafter, and it was held to be in
admiralty.
And I would refer the Court to the analogy of the
Congress making crimes which occur in/aircraft over navigable

15
waters within the maritime jurisdiction.

It is

in fact,

the injury which occurs on or over navigable waters which
makes it a maritime tort, and brings into play che general
maritime law.
And that, in effect, —
QUESTION:

What about crashes on bridges?

MR. BOSTWICK:

You mean an aircraft crashing on a

bridge, Your Honor?
QUESTION: No, an automobile crash on a bridge, over
navigable waters.
MR. BOSTWICK: Well, we don't believe that this
Court is going to be required to rule on the automobile
cases in this case.

We believe that a holding in this case

that when an aircraft crashes in navigable waters, the
tort claims arising therefrom are within maritime jurisdiction,
does not call upon this Court to decide that case.

In fact,

there is a case of an automobile driving off of a pontoon
barge in —
QUESTION: That's right.
MR. BOSTWICK:

— in New Orleans, and the car that

was going from the ferry to the land was in admiralty, and the
one going the other way was not.

And, in fact, there's a

myriad of decisions —
QUESTION: Well, what would your holding be for the
car that drives off the bridge into navigable waters?

16
MR. BOSTWICK: Well, for the car that drives off the
bridge into navigable waters, if the person is killed —
QUESTION;

Let's assume he’s hit.

He’s hit on the

bridge and he's —• damage done to the car and some damage to
him, but off into the water and he's hurt more.

He doesn't

die.
MR. BOSTWICK:

If the person were injured in the

water, we believe it would be a maritime tort. But, again,
we respectfully state that it is the nature of the aviation
activities here which cause us to urge the present ruling upon
the Court.

We are not urging a rule upon the Court in

automobile cases, and I'm not trying to duck the Court's
question.
However, in a —
QUESTION: Well, I don't know that —* I don't know
how you'd limit the principle if the plane crashing in
navigable waters raises a maritime issue, I don't know why
ail automobile wouldn’t also.
MR. BOSTWICK:

Do you?

I'll be as specific as I can, if the

Court please.
*

QUESTION:

Mr. Bostwick, right on that, you have as

one of your important premises, if not major premises, that
the airplane is supplanting seagoing ships as the major
means of transportation.
Now, when you go to Key West these days from the

17
mainland of Florida, you travel over something like 60 to 90
miles that was once traversed by boats, and now there’s a
great causeway and you're over — not just over an ordinary
navigable stream, you're over the sea, the Atlantic Ocean* the
Caribbean and the Gulf»
Now, your premise would certainly make an automobile
which hits the railing and goes down into the water a maritime
case, wouldn't it?
MR. BOSTWICKj Well, if the Court please, I believe —
the government has urged that this Court use this case to
fashion a locality-plus rule.

For once we agree with the city,

the respondent, the City of Cleveland, in the view that that
is not required in this case.

We believe that a holding in

this case concerning aircraft crashes in navigable waters
does not require the Court to make a statement about the type
of hypothetical which has been presented. And it leaves the
lower courts free, in a situation where a swimmer is injured
in 13 inches of t^ater, where there's a rear-end collision
on a pontoon barge between two automobiles waiting for a
ferry.

It leaves the lower courts free to continue to decide

those few —- and I emphasise the fact that they are few — to
decide those few cases, if they so decide, on a locality-pivs
basis.
We do not believe that this case raises the .localityplus question, and that the hypotheticals concerning the

IS
automobiles

need to be decided because of the ruling in this

case that aircraft crashes in navigable waters bring about
maritime tort claims.
QUESTION:

It’s strictly on a locality basis?

MR. BOSTWICK: The locality basis has to do with the
aviation cases because, assuming arguendo there is a plus
required, that it is present in the aviation cases.

We do

not believe that it's present only in those cases where the
aircraft is being used, as it was previously used, like a
vessel or whether 90 percent of its flight has been over
water as opposed to 5 percent over land,
QUESTION: What's the plus?
MR. BOSTWICK: Well, that's, if the Court please, a
good question and I've been unable
QUESTION: Well, I thought I understood you to say,
Mr. Bostwick, that if there is a locality-plus, it satisfies
you.

What is it?

What is the plus?

MR. BOSTWICK:

Oh.

Excuse me.

We believe it to be

t he same plus stated by the Third Circuit in Weinstein and by
the dissenting judge in this case, that is, the relationship
between a downed aircraft in navigable waters and the perils
that occur to the pilots and the passengers and the analogy
to a downed ship.
In other words, there is nothing fortuitous to a
man who is drowning in navigable waters, whether he got there

19
because his boat tipped over or because his airplane crashed
in it, just off the shore.

There's an analogy between the

salvage problems, the navigational problems in the channel.
QUESTIONS
too.

Well, those are true of automobiles,

I mean, the guy can drown if he drives off a bridge into

navigable waters.
MR. BOSTWICKs

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I am not

talcing the position that an automobile is necessarily outside,
an automobile crash in which people are killed going off a
bridge is necessarily outside of admiralty jurisdiction.

And,

as I say, there are some cases in which admiralty has taken
cognizance over automobile cases.
But I respectfully do not believe the Court needs to
reach that here by holding that in aviation cases there is —
that the tort claims arising out of crashes in navigable
waters —
QUESTION:

Well, Justice Brennan, though, asked you

what is the plus here, and, as I understand your answer, it's
that because the aircraft went down in navigable water, the
people in the aircraft confront basically the same problem
that people going down in a ship confront.
And I wish to add the comment that I don't think
either of those problems are distinguishable from the people
who are in a car, about to drown in navigable water.

If

there's going to be a plus that separates aircraft from

20

automobiles, there's got to be some, other than what you've
said.
MR. BOSTWICK: Very well.

And, as a matter of fact,

the court in New Orleans agreed and found that the injuries as
a result of drowning, and that the horror that goes along
with seeing your husband drown meant that an automobile
crash into navigable waters was in admiralty.
So, therefore, I am not taking the position that
the automobile case is not in admiralty.
QUESTION:

Mr. Bostwick, 7-*

QUESTION: Assuming that the car is going over the

QUESTION: And what law would apply?
MR. BOSTWICK: General maritime lav/ would apply —

21

QUESTION :

To the automobile accident up on the

bridge?
MR. BOSTWICK: To the automobile accident, in xv'hich
the car goes into the navigable water.

I thought that that was

your question.
QUESTION?

Yes.

But the accident occurred up on the

bridge.
MR. BOSTWICK: Oh, well, —
QUESTION:

And he is struck, and as a result of being

struck by the other car he went over into the navigable
water.

Now, who's at fault?
MR. BOSTWICK: Well, it’s our view that if the person

died as a result of being in navigable water, then the fault
would be determined by the general maritime principles, which
utilize comparative negligence and have a cause of action for
wrongful death.

And there is, I might say, an additional

distinction about -—
QUESTION:

But it certainly wouldn't be decided

whether or not it's got grease on the step, to make it
unseaworthy; you couldn't decide it on that basis?
MR. EOSTWICK:

No, sir,

I wish to reserve a few moments in rebuttal, but
in answer to your question, Mr, Justice Rehnquist, the aircraft which fly over navigable waters, as distinguished from
automobiles, do have a maritime plus in that the majority of

22
the passengers which used to travel by boat now travel by
air,, and there is a need, there is a vast number of aviation
accidents because of the number of airports built and around
navigable waters, and the number of accidents which occur in
and around the landing patterns.

There is a large number of

aircraft crashes in navigable waters and territorial navigable
waters, and we believe that they present a problem which has
been solved by the lower courts under Weinstein, and that that
rule is the proper one which should be continued and ratified
by this Court.
QUESTION:

Well, that’s the position the government

takes, isn't it; isn't that the nexus the government suggests
for the maritime connection?
MR. BOSTWICK:

Well, it's my understanding . that the

government would find that in some aircraft crashes, for
example, the plane that lands in the water on the flight from
Washington to Chicago but which lands in Lake Michigan,
fortuitously, that that would not be a maritime nexus, not a
maritime case, because —•
QUESTION:

Yes, but a flight from Chicago to

Washington, D. C„, that happens to go into Lake Michigan,
isn't much of a substitute for a steamship to Washington.
MR. BOSTWICK:
Honor.
QUESTION:

Yes.

It's no substitute at all, Your

23
MB. BQSTWICK: But the fact of the matter is that
people who are faced with possibly drowning in Lake Michigan
meet the same perils as anyone else in navigable waters.
QUESTION;

Well now, you've got a different nexus

now.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Solicitor General.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERWIN N. GRISWOLD, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. GRISWOLD;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
I think that this is the first time that I have ever
been a proctor in admiralty, to which I was admitted some
years ago.
Let me start by restating the facts of the case,
which are illustrated by this chart, which appears in the
brief for the City of Cleveland it is Plaintiffs' Exhibit 4^
in the case.
North is to the right, which is perhaps a little
misleading; but if I tilt the chart to the side, then the
lettering is hard to read.
The plane started here at the runway, at the gate;
came to the end of the 6 Left runway and started down the
runway to the northeast.
At this place where it says "Rotate Area", that is
airplane language for takeoff.

What you do is rotate the

24
nose of the plane, and the takeoff was between 2800 and 3,000
feet, down the runway.
The bird area was between 3600 feet and 6200 feet?
but before the plane had left the end of the runway, the
control tower had said, "Caution, birds on end of runway",
and that appears on page 14 of the record; and then had added,
"It looks like there are a million of them,"
Now, the plane started down, nevertheless, and took
off at 2800 feet. When it took off, the birds flushed into
the air.

The plane hit the birds in this area, over land?

as Mr. Bostwick has said, 314 dead birds were found on the
runway, on land; and the engines of the plane were filled with
ingested birds.
The plane immediately lost power.

The pilot

endeavored to take what steps he could to get out of the
situation.

He hit the perimeter fence of the airport here,

and a truck which was parked at the end of the airport; and
this statement on the exhibit, "E MeA" is Mr. McAvoy's
initials, which he put on the exhibit to indicate that that
is the point where the truck was hit.

All of this, of course,

is on land.
By this time the plane is almost hopelessly
disabled, and it was a miracle that it finally came through
and the three persons on board came out.
These dotted lines are the course of the plane after

25

hitting the truck.

They, too, were put on the exhibit as the

testimony of Mr. McAvoy.
QUESTION

Who is Mr. McAvoy?

MR. GRISWOLD;

Mr. McAvoy is a witness for the

plaintiff.
And the plane finally came to rest in the water
here, and this "E McA S" is Mr. McAvoy's testimony that that
represents the place where it came to rest.
I may point out that this is the Cleveland breakwater
here, all of this is inside the breakwater.

That does not mean

that it is not navigable water, but it is not the high seas on
the lake, so to speak.
Now, there is a reference in the briefs to the fact
that the plane came to rest a fifth of a mile from the end of
the runway.

That is literally true, this being the end of the

runway, and it's a fifth of a mile to there.

But it was only

30 or 40 feet from land to the north that the plane came to
rest.
It’s clear that the damage to the engines was done
and completed before the plane hit the water.

It is also

clear that there was substantial damage to the airframe, from
hitting the fence and the truck, and the birds, before the
plane hit the water.
QUESTION;

Mr. Solicitor General, where did you say

the aircraft was when the tower warned that there were a million

26

birds?
MR, GRISWOLD;

The aircraft was here at the end of

the runway, at the beginning of the runway, before takeoff,
QUESTION;

And it had not commenced its run?

MR. GRISWOLD;

I'm sorry, sir?

QUESTION; The aircraft had not started down the —
MR. GRISWOLD; The aircraft had not started into the
air at the time the warning was given.
QUESTION; Could the flight have been aborted?
MR. GRISWOLD:
QUESTION:

Well, —

That is — I mean by that —

MR. GRISWOLD;

— the flight need not have started

at all.
QUESTION:
the pilot?

Well, I mean — was that the choice of

It could not have been aborted by the tower?
MR. GRISWOLD:

Yes, the tower could have instructed

them not to go off.
QUESTION:

I mean, if he was talking about a million

birds, that —
MR. GRISWOLD:

That, after you have given the

pilot the information, there is quite a bit of practice in the
air industry that the decision is up to the pilot, —
QUESTION: Well, that's what I —
MR, GRISWOLD;

~~ not to the control tower.

This has not been tried in this case.

I suppose

27
this bears on the question of comparative negligence, which
might be relevant in admiralty," and contributory negligence,
which would be relevant if it is not in admiralty.
Wow, the district court in this case dismissed the
libel in admiralty.

It found that it is manifest that the

alleged negligence became operative upon the aircraft while
it was over the land, and it added that whether it came down
upon land or upon water was largely fortuitous.
And the Court of Appeals affirmed on the ground that
the tort occurred on land.

It said in its opinion that "the

alleged tort ... occurred on land", even though the plane fell
into navigable waters shortly after takeoff from the airport,
and that no right of action is cognizable in admiralty.
QUESTIONS

What did you —■ what do you understand,

then, their meaning when they say that the tort occurred on
land?

As I understand it, of the three events here, two of

them occurred on land and one on water.

One is the alleged

negligence, i.e., the failure to tell them not to take off.
That was obviously on land.
No. 2 was the infliction of the initial damage by
the birds and by the fence and so on,

And that occurred on

land.
And only the third occurred on water, which was the
eventual loss of the airplane.
MR. GRISWOLD:

Well, I would say No. 3 —

28

QUESTIONS

Were they talking about No. 1 or No. 2

when they said that tort occurred on land?
MR. GRISWOLD:

And No. 3 is hitting the

QUESTION: Wellr I include that with the birds.
MR. GRISWOLD:

— fence and truck.

Perhaps.

Yes,

that is perfectly —*
QUESTION: Well, they were talking about No. 1, i.e»,
the negligence, or were they talking about No. 2?
MR. GRISWOLD:

I don't know, Mr. Justice, I suppose

that's a part of the issue in this case.
QUESTION: Well, I was just wondering what — how
you understood the district court and the Court of Appeals.
MR. GRISWOLD:

There are two defendants here, one,

the City of Cleveland, who Mr. Crocker represents, and the
other, the tower controller, an employee of the Federal
Government, whom I represent.

Mr. Crocker has generously

given all of the time to me, but I am in a very real sense
representing the City of Cleveland as well as the airport
controller; and Mr. Crocker relies more heavily on this
question of where was the tort than I do, and I'm sure that
the Court will give careful consideration to his brief.
This was the ground upon which the Sixth Circuit
Court of Appeals decided the case, and it relied primarily on
three decisions.
Now, I know it is perfectly easy to go through this

29

Court's admiralty cases, over a hundred years, and find a case
such as the one Mr. Bostwick referred to, The Plymouth, which
rather refers to the consequences rather than to the point of
impact.
The three cases which the Sixth Circuit relied on,
Smith & Son v. Taylor, Minnie v« Port Huron Terminal Company,
and finally The Admiral Peoples, are all cases in which the
Court made the decision between admiralty and non-admiralty
turn on the point of injury, in the sense of the point of
impact.
In Smith & Son v. Taylor, a longshoreman was standing
on a stage which rested on a wharf and projected a few feet
over the water. He was struck by a sling loaded with cargo,
which was lowered over the side from the ship, and knocked
into the water.

And the Court held that that was the — the

tort was on land and not in sea, and there could be no
maritime recovery.
The next case, Minnie v. Port Huron Terminal Company,
is almost exactly the converse; and The Admiral Peoples is a
gangplank case, a slip and fall.

He slipped and fell on the

gangplank and hit the wharf, and that was held to be a ship
injury because the slip and fall was on the gangplank.
Nov/, the only case that really deals with this kind
of an accident is the Third Circuit's decision in Weinstein vy
Eastern Airlines, and I v/ould like to point out that, though

30

that decision is certainly doetrinely inconsistent with the
Sixth Circuit, no facts appeared in that case which are
anything like the facts which have been shown here with respect
to the injuries on and over land.
For the Weinstein case arose on a motion to dismiss,
*

and the libel said that shortly after the aircraft had
become airborne, by reason of the negligence of the respondents,
and by virtue of their respective breach of warranty, said
aircraft crashed into the navigable waters of Boston Harbor,
period.
And that is all the allegation there is; there is
no allegation there that anything happened on or above the
land, and the issue arose on the exceptions of the Eastern
Airlines.

The facts averred in the libel do not constitute a

cause of action against Eastern Airlines, Inc., within the
admiralty jurisdiction of this Court.
I would like to devote the — I think the factual
situation is clear to the Court, and the bases of the decision
below appear clearly in its opinion, and we rely on that; but
I would like to devote the rest of my argument to the broader
question:

Should admiralty law apply to an airplane crash

of this sort?
By that I am not waiving the place of the tort
argument, I am seeking to present a broader ground.
The only reason that I can think of for bringing

31

this within admiralty is a purely verbal one, namely that
admiralty applies to the sea, or, in this country, to inland,
navigable waters? and this plane landed in the water, ergo,
admiralty jurisdiction.
But even on a verbal basis, if we start by saying
that admiralty relates to ships, then this case does not
involve a ship, ergo, no admiralty jurisdiction.
Obviously, both of these approaches are essentially
formal.

I'm not suggesting at all, of course, that admiralty

must be confined to exactly what it covered in 1787 or 1789?
obviously the Constitution should be construed so as to
accommodate new developments.

Admiralty took in steamships

when they came, and admiralty was rightly extended to the
inland navigable waters of the United States, xvhich were
something not paralleled in Britain.
Similarly, the Constitution gives Congress power
with respect to an army and a navy, and no one questions that
that applies also to an air force.
But it does not follow that admiralty should extend
to every tort which occurs on water, if this tort did occur
on water, and specifically it does not follow the admiralty
jurisdiction should be found to extend to airplane accidents
of the sort involved here.
There is no decision of this Court saying that any
sort of airplane accident is within admiralty jurisdiction.

32

There are not even any decisions of this Court applying the
Death on the High Seas Act to an airplane accident.

Thus, this

Court will not have to overrule any of its decisions, or make
any break in its established lav/, if it comes to the conclu­
sion that airplane accidents, at least of the sort involved
here, do not come within admiralty jurisdiction.
*

The leading case to the contrary is the Weinstein
case, a careful and thoughtful opinion by Judge Biggs.

However,

it's perhaps worthy of note that Judge Van Dusen was the
trial judge in that case.

He decided to the contrary, and

Judge Van Dusen is now on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals.
Indeed, there was a certain amount of what laymen,
at least, might regard as lawyers playing games, in the
whole Eastern Airlines situation.

The crash occurred in

Massachusetts, but that State has a narrow wrongful death
statute, with a limit on recovery fixed at $20,000.

So the

suit was started in Pennsylvania, where there is no such
limitation.

And the Court of Appeals held there was admiralty

jurisdiction.
After that, though, counsel apparently gave further
thought, and feared that the court in admiralty might
find that the Massachusetts statute was applicable, because
of the strength of these place of the tort decisions.
And so suits were then brought on the law side of
the Pennsylvania court, based on diversity of citizenship,

33

which was easy to do because you can appoint a non-resident
administrator, and the suit was not based on the tort but was
based on breach of a contract of safe carriage, as to which it
was held that the Pennsylvania law applied.
And this is what was sustained by the Court of
Appeals in a four-to-three decision in Scott v. Eastern Airlines
company.
This Court denied certiorari in both of the Third
Circuit cases, but that is as far as it has gone on this
problem.
Why should not admiralty law apply to all torts
which occur or indeed come to rest on navigable water?
may as well ask the opposite questions

One

Why should admiralty

law apply to all such torts, when they have nothing to do with
ships?
There is a fundamental difference between ships and
airplanes, apart from the fact that ships float on the sea
and airplanes go through the air.
stay in the water.

This is that ships always

Of course they can go aground, but the

water puts them there? and .they can be put in drydock, but
it's appropriately been held that since they float there,
that that’s within admiralty jurisdiction.
The sea is the nourishing source for a ship, but an
airplane is based on the ground.
land as over sea.

It flies equally well over

Whether it ever goes over the sea and

34

when it is over navigable waters it is largely fortuitous,
has nothing whatever to do with what, by analogy, we call che
navigation of the airplane.
Let us take the case of a plane which flies from
New York to San Francisco.

It leaves the airport and circles

over navigable waters as it picks up its westward course.
Then it crosses the Hudson River, a navigable waterway, and
after a while it crosses the Ohio River, and then the
Mississippi, and then the Missouri.

In due course it crosses

the Upper Colorado River, and the Great Salt Lake, both of
which have been held by this Court to be navigable.

It

crosses the Sacramento River, and then comes down across San
Francisco Bay, at a point where the water is very shallow,
perhaps it circles over the Pacific Ocean before coming in
for a landing,.
Does it make any sense to say that tort liability
is a matter of State law, except in the cases where, if there
is a crash, the plane chances to hit a waterway, navigable
by ships, within a State?

If it bounces on the shore and

comes to rest in the Mississippi River, which is essentially
what it did here, then .it’s a matter for admiralty juris­
diction.

Despite the fact that the whole venture bears no

relation whatever to maritime commerce.
Yet that was the situation in the Eastern Airlines
case, the plane came to rest a few feet in the water, in the

35

Boston Harbor; that's the case here, where admiralty juris­
diction is claimed to rest on the place where the plane stopped,
after a land activity.
QUESTION:

I suppose, too, Mr. Solicitor General,

you could have an approach to the Washington airport that
would bounce the airplane off of the Potomac and onto dry land
on the runway, if it missed by a few feet?
MR. GRISWOLD:

That would be the converse, and

presumably that would not be in admiralty if it stopped on
dry land.
The problems which can be encountered if one takes
t he verbal or formal view that admiralty jurisdiction extends
to everything that happens on navigable waters can be
illustrated by a number of decisions in the lower courts.
Some have already been referred to here, in the autos that
fall off of bridges; but there have been cases on this,
A district court in Florida has held that a suit
by a swimmer, who was struck by a surfboard, is within
admiralty jurisdiction.

A district court in Tennessee has

held that an injury to a water skier is within admiralty
jurisdiction.
Other courts have gone the other way.

A district

court in Vaw York has held that a woman who was injured by a
submerged object while bathing at a public beach cannot main­
tain a suit in admiralty.

36

And the court below has held, in other cases, that
a swimmer who dove from the municipal dock into 18 inches of
water, alleging negligence in failing to construct guard
rails and post warning signs, could not maintain a suit in
admiralty.
And in another case where the decedent fell from a
dock and was drowned, the court held there was no maritime
jurisdiction.
Finally, in Gowdy v. United States, an electrician
was injured while repairing the machinery inside a lighthouse
on a breakwater.

He brought a libel in admiralty, and this

was dismissed because the injury bore no relation to maritime
commerce or navigation.
This Court denied certiorari in both — two of these
Sixth Circuit cases, which perhaps evens the score from the
two denials in the Eastern Airlines case.
Apparently the earliest case involving an airplane,
which crashed in navigable waters, was decided in 1914, nearly
sixty years ago.

That was the Crawford Brothers Wo, 2, and

that's the name of an airplane, not of a ship.
That was a libel in rem for repairs to an airplane
which fell into Puget Sound,

An intervening libelant

asserted a salvage claim, and the Court held that there was
no jurisdiction in admiralty, saying "they are neither of the
land nor sea, and not being of the sea, or restricted in their

37

activity to navigable waters, they are not maritime."
Now, reference may well be made to the Death on the
High Seas Act, which was enacted in 1920, the text of which
appears on page 21 of our brief.
There is no reference in that statute, or in its
legislative history, to airplanes.

It applies — it is a Lord

Campbell’s act, changing the common law so as to provide a
cause of action for wrongful death, in its terms, occurring
on the high seas.
Congress made the Death on the High seas Act
applicable, quote, "On the high seas, beyond a marine league
from the shore of any State," thus indicating rather clearly
its understanding that the laws of the States were applicable
in territorial waters, which is what we have here; and that
there was no need to extend admiralty jurisdiction to them.
Many courts have held, and I think rightly, that the
Death on the High Seas Act applies to airplane accidents.
Air crashes do come within the literal language of the
statute, where the ultimate impact of the crash is on the
high seas.
It is true that Congress said that suit under the
Death on the High weas Act should be in admiralty.

As to

deaths on or in connection with ships, this is of course
clear, and within traditional admiralty jurisdiction.
Congress was not thinking of airplane accidents when it passed

38
this statute.

There was no need for it to extend admiralty

jurisdiction to airplane crashes causing death, for it would
have had ample power to provide for recovery for wrongful
death in air accidents under its power to regulate interstate
and foreign commerce, and not to mention the broad powers which
can be found in the Curtiss-Wright decision of this Court.
When the statute is properly extended to airplane
accidents, it may well be that it should not be construed to
mean that such suits are actually in admiralty, but, rather,
that Congress prescribes that the recovery, though at law,
should be as if in admiralty, somewhat as the State law was
applied by this Court as a part of federal law in the marine
case decided a year or so ago.
That is, with the measure of recovery in such
things as comparative negligence, to be determined by the
standards of the admiralty rules.
As long as the law stays in its present state, we
will have innumerable, fruitless, borderline problems such as
this.

And results in particular cases will be fortuitous

and understandable only to the most intricately minded
lawyers.

There will be disputes as to where the tort

occurred, the doubts about the question that Mr. Justice
Stewart asked me, and whether the controlling factor is
where the impact occurred, which made it inevitable that
the plane would crash, or yrhether the question on which

3S
jurisdiction turns is where the plane came to rest.
As I see it, there are several ways in which the
question can be disposed of.

First, the Court can hold, as I

think it should, that airplane crashes having no connection with
a ship do not come within admiralty jurisdiction.

As 1 have

said, this Court would not have to overrule any of its
decisions to reach such a result, and such a decision would
be in accord with current, modern British law.

There is a

British statute which provides that His Majesty, by order and
counsel, may provide the court and the rules which apply to
airplanes, and the only order, that has ever been issued is
that actions by or against an airplane, with respect to
salvage, pilotage, and towage shall be in admiralty? but
nothing else.
And those three items, it makes a certain amount of
sense to have it in admiralty.
QUESTION;

Under this first proposed test, Mr.

Solicitor General, do I understand correctly that you would
say if a plane was flying from New York to London and crashed
in mid-Atlantic, on account of somebody’s negligence, that
admiralty there would have jurisdiction?
MR. GRISWOLD;

My position on this is that that

would not be in admiralty.

But that even in international flights,

such as that across the Atlantic or across the Pacific, that
would not be in admiralty, even though the —
MR. GRISWOLD: That is the position which I am
seeking to advance to the Court —
QUESTION:

Okay.

MR. GRISWOLD:

I misunderstood,

— and the one that seems to me to,

when you get all through with it, to work out the most
satisfactory,

I can think of no reason why there should be.

Airplanes are not ships.

When the admiralty developed,

ships had no power of their own, they were large structures
floating on the water, subject to the vagaries of winds and
tides and currents, and always subject to the risk of
collision no matter how careful the master or the pilot
might be.
It was in this situation that the rules of
comparative negligence developed in admiralty.

No one

contends that airplane crew members are entitled to maintenance

41
and cure, or that they are wards of the admiralty.

I know of

no case applying the admiralty doctrine of general average to
an airplane, nor is the lav? of limitation of liability
applicable to them. After all, an airplane after it's
as
crashed i3 about/worthless — in the water, is about as
worthless as anything can be.

A mortgage on an airplane is

not a maritime contract, and a suit on such a security interest
cannot be brought in admiralty.
Having gone so far to recognize that airplanes are
not ships, and they are not within admiralty jurisdiction,
it might be well to hold that they are not within admiralty
jurisdiction for tort purposes, thus eliminating a number of
fruitless line-drawing problems, if airplanes are held to be
within admiralty for some purposes and not for others,
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Solicitor General, in your

brief you say, In our view an aircraft may be said to bear a
significant relationship to maritime commerce and navigation
only when it is performing functions previously performed
by ships, or vessels.
MR. GRISWOLD:
goes beyond the brief.

Yes, Mr, Justice, my oral argument
I have allowed the processes of thought

to take effect, and *i—
QUESTION: Yes.
[Laughter.]
QUESTION: Well, I must say, we all misunderstood

42
your argument and so on*
MR. GRISWOLD s

As I have worked on this case ,

I have found myself less willing to stand on that ground
which is the broad ground of the Sixth Circuit? and as it
became more clear to me that there is no decision of this
Court that has to be overruled, qualified, the Court has
never dealt with the problem.
QUESTION: Well, the only thing is you do have to
ignore the plain words of the congressional Act to do —
MR. GRISWOLD:

No, Mr. Justice.

QUESTION: Why not?
MR. GRISWOLD: Because the —
QUESTION:

It says "in admiralty", doesn’t it?

MR. GRISWOLD:

And Congress may well have power to

extend it to admiralty,
QUESTION:

Well, it does say "in admiralty".

MR. GRISWOLD: All right.

But Congress didn’t have

the slightest idea that it was talking about airplanes when
it passed that statute.
QUESTION: Well, that may be so, but you still say
the Death on the High Seas Act applies.
MR. GRISWOLD:

I say the Death on the High Seas

Act applies because Congress ~ because it makes sense to
apply it to all the circumstances, and Congress has power to
enact it under the foreign commerce power, even though it

43

may not have had power to do
QUESTION;

Yes, but you would say to the total Court

that this action may not be in admiralty?
MR. GRISWOLD;
QUESTION;

I am —

And the Congress says it should be.

MR. GRISWOLD;

My basic argument is that — it’s

not presented in our brief ~ that this does not fall within
the admiralty power.
QUESTION;

And nowhere in the tort law , with

respect to aviation, has nothing to do with admiralty?
MR. GRISWOLD;

Unless perhaps the airplane hits a

ship, which
QUESTION;

How about a seaplane?

MR. GRISWOLD; A seaplane is another matter.
QUESTION;

I —

It’s like a sea gull, isn't it?

[Laughter.]
MR, GRISWOLD;

No, but hydroplanes is another matter.

If this were done, all the nitpicking involved in
this case would be eliminated if the crash occurred in
territorial waters as was true of the crash here, the law of
the State would apply, as would be the case if this plane
had ended up on the end of the runway.

If the crash occurred

on the high seas, the State courts would have jurisdiction,
or the federal courts might have jurisdiction in diversity
cases, or Congress could extend jurisdictiongenerally to the

44
federal courts, since interstate or foreign commerce is
necessarily involved.

The Death on the High Seas Act would

be applicable.
I'm troubled about the word "admiralty” in the
statute.

If there was a non-fatal crash or if there was a

suit with respect to loss of property, the courts could fashion
a common law remedy, or Congress could legislate if that was
thought necessary»
Now, my time has expired, but my second alternative
would be to say that this case only involves territorial
waters, and at least as far as territorial waters is
concerned, it is not admiralty.

As to the international

flight to London, the Court could either hold or leave open
the question whether crashes outside the limits of any
State are within admiralty jurisdiction.
My third ground would be essentially that of the
Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, and that taken in our brief,
that there must be some kind of a maritime nexus which we
contend is not adequately found merely by reason of the
fact that the crash comes to rest in the navigable waters,
and, finally, the Court could hold that:

yes, it is

admiralty, but the important place, if it is admiralty, is
where the impact takes place.

Here the impact was over the

sine qua non, the event beyond which there was no way to avoid
the crash, occurred over land, and it was on that ground that

45

the court below decided the case„
It seems to me that the Court is confronted here
with something,in a sense, a little like the situation
presented by The Genesee Chief, where the Court extended
admiralty to the inland waters.

Here we have a new means of

transportation, we have two generations of experience with
it? nothing has indicated any reason why it is useful or
desirable or necessary to have it in admiralty, and the
Court might well provide, might well decide that neither
within the history nor the proper scope of admiralty should
airplane accidents of this sort be held to be within
admiralty jurisdiction.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Bostwick, we'll

enlarge your time a little here? you'll have five minutes.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PHILLIP D. BOSTWICK, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. BOSTWICK:

Thank you very much, Your Honor.

I'll

be very brief.
With regard to a few of the questions concerning the
facts and the allegations of contributory negligence, I just
would like to clear up that in an unsworn statement the
Air Traffic Controller did say that he said to the pilots:
"It looks like a million birds", or words to that effect.
However, there is no tape recording in this case from the
tower, for an unknown reason, and it is undisputed that the

46

pilots did not acknowledge hearing that transmission and
asked for a further clearance for takeoff, and it is
uncontradicted that on the second clearance the Air Traffic
Controller simply said, "Cleared for takeoff", without any
reference to the birds at all.

And I think it is clear beyond

doubt, under the regulations, that the Air Traffic Controllers
do have the power to hold aircraft on the runway when there
are dangers on the duty runway.
Now, with regard to the legal points raised by the
Solicitor General, X would just simply state that it is true
there are no decisions by this Court concerning aircraft
crashes in navigable waters.

As the judge pointed out in the

dissenting opinion, there are, however, about thirty years'
worth of decisions in the lower federal courts concerning this
very point, both under the Death on the High seas Act, the
personal injury cases, property damage cases, cases within the
general iparitime law, under the general maritime law within
the territorial navigable waters.

Without exception, every

one of those cases holds that the tort claims arising out
of the crash of an airplane in navigable waters is
cognizable in admiralty.
The case in the court below is the only case, to
my knowledge, other than Judge Van Dusen's decision, which
was reversed in Weinstein, holding that such a crash is not
cognizable in admiralty.

47
Therefore, I know that this Court is aware of that
line of precedent.

I also know that if is conceivable this

Court could now enunciate a totally new rule, without regard
to those lower court decisions.
QUESTIONS

But isn't it wholly consistent with the

cases that hold that if you fall off —• if you're knocked off a
dock into navigable waters that it's not an admiralty case?

And we would urge that, because of the

very playing of games, which was referred to by the Solicitor
General, and the very complexity and the need to have
pre-litigation concerning jurisdictional questions and
questions of which substantive law is applicable, that this

48

Court should not follow that rule. This Court should
enunciate a rule such as found in the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure, to reach the just, speedy, and inexpensive
determination of the litigation on the merits, that there should
be a rule which determines these questions of jurisdiction in
applicable substantive law, without regard to metaphysical
phrases such as xfhere causes of action arise, where torts
occur, where the impact occurs? these —* this language, which
is found in the longshoremen and harbor workers' compensation
cases, we say, has no place in the future of aviation and
space activities, and we would rest primarily on the decisions
of the Third Circuit in Weinstein, and on the dissenting court
judge in this case.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Thank you, Mr. Bostwick.
Thank you, Mr. Solicitor General.
The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 1:58 o'clock, p.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.]
