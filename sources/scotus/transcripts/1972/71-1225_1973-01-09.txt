HR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGEE:

We will hear argumentis

next in No. 71-1225, Gagnon against Scarpsl11,
Mr, Plats.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM A. PLATE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. PLATE:

Mr. Chief Justice, «and may it please the

Court:
I might mention that my client pronounces his name ir
the French way.

It is Gahyn-on.

This case commenced, actually, on July

9,

1965s when

Gerald Scarpelli was convicted in Wisconsin of armed robbery in
Racine County, and was placed on probation for a period of
seven years in the custody of what was then the State Beparfcmers
of Public Welfare, which has control of all probationers and
parolees! In the State of Wisconsin,
He was also,at the saiae time, sentenced to a tern
of 15 years in the Wisconsin State Psrison and execution of the
sentence was stayed pending the 7 years probation.
He was permitted to leave the State of Wisconsin ’ .
pursuant to the interstate compact for out-of-state parolees
supervision and go to the State of Illinois where he resided.
His residence ©as in a suburb of Chicago and ha ©as employed in
another suburb of Chicago.
He was accepted for supervision by the Cook County

4
Probation Department, pursuant to the interstate compact, on

Angust 5, 1963.
On Friday, August 6th, the following day, a home in
Deerfield, Illinois, which is a northern suburb of Chicago,
and is quite, some distance both from Scarpeill’s residence and
from his place of employment, was burglarised during the daytime,
in the morning, and news of this came to the Department of
Public Welfare which saw a news article in the Chicago Tribune
which contained a photograph ~~ contained two photographs,
including one of our probationer, Scarpelli, and also a state­
ment which he gave to the Assistant State's Attorney of LakeCounty Illinois, in which he made a full confession of his part:
in the burglary.
The co-defendant *-*• or the other burglar -« was also
his co-defendant in the Wisconsin robbery of which he had been
previously convicted.
X think Frank Kleekner, the other burglar in Illinois,
was not at that time convicted in Wisconsin.
leaving the burglared premises.

Kleekner was shot

Scarpelli, however, escaped

and was not taken into custody for some little time.
Q

Now, are you describing the conduct which led to the

revocation -&R. PLATZ:

That is what X am describing now, the

conduct which led to the revocation.
Wow, at that time in Wisconsin, the law was that these

5
was no right fco a hearing on revocation of probation.
Our law on probation was- exacted in 1909, two years
after our parole law.
The parole law had placed parolees

in the custody

of the old Board of Control,which, later became the Department
of Public Welfare, and two years later, in 1909, the Legislature
enacted the probation law under which the courts could either
impose sentence and stay execution thereof and place them on
probation under the custody and control of the same department
which had control of parolees and under the same rules and
regulations, or could withhold sentence altogether and place
them on probation.
In the case of Scarpsill, It was a case of the
sentence being imposed and execution stayed.
How, originally, in Wisconsin, the probation law
required that before probation be revoked, there be a hearing
the law said a personal hearing «** full investigation and
personal hearing.
In 1947, that provision was removed in the course of
the revision of the statute and there have been no hearings
since then.
This Court, in E'scoe yiri Zeyfest, held that there was
no constitutional right to a hearing on revocation of probation.
Q

Have there been no hearings since then?

I suppose

there have been, oerhana in hearing^ since Morressey v. Brewer,

6
haven *fc there ?
MR, PLATg:

Yes, Your Honor, and since before that,

too, but what X mean i3 up until the time of this case there
have been no (inaudible),
How, this case was commenced in the Federal Court
in December 3,968, which was over three years after the
revocation, and it took quite 0 while.

It was 1970 before

it was decided in the court ~~ in the District Court.
We lost in the District Court.

We appealed to the

Circuit Court of Appeals, and we lost there.

Xt took almost a

year for that to be decided.
We applied for certiorari in this Court, which was
granted at the end of June.
Counsel now takes the position that the case has
become, moot, because the original seven years of probation
«*• calendar years — has expired.
I filed a reply brief, answering this claim of moo tries; 9,
and In order to have more time to discuss the merits I would
really prefer to leave the mootness to my reply brief,
1 consider that the case is not moot, that we have
a right

if we have committed constitutional error — we

have a right to correct it and to correct it now even though
the original seven calendar years have expired.
Actually, at the time this matter was before the
Court of Appeals» the probationer Scarps Hi had been released

1
on parole to meet a Federal charge and had already been tried
Federally and «as then in Terre Hante in a Federal institution
and he thereafter «as release.1 or parole frc

:he

: ei

institution, and X am not sure I know just «here he is now,

hut «e have a string on him and can get. him back for a hearing
if «e have to.
Q

The essence of your mootness argument is that the

sentence has sir or seven years
MR. PLATZ:
Q

More to go.

— and he may have parole revoked again.
MR. FLATZ;

That is right.

On the basis of the rule which this Court has laid
down whereby the States have the right to correct their
errors, in ease -«* and on Federal habeas corpus, of course, the
rule 13 that the court makes such order as law and justice
require and it does not require that there be an absolute
discharge of the defendant.
Mow, at the time, as X say, we ««* this man was
rather summarily revoked on the strength of what he had done
and his admission. . On the record, there is no question that
he made the admissionsttp the State* s Attorney*8 office in
Lake County, Illinois.
In his traverse, he admits he made the admissions fco
the attorney. —* fco the Assistant State *s Attorney — but ha
takes the position that he did so on the basis of some

s
statements having been'made'to him that, of course, the
Wisconsin authorities would never he informed of this and

ad been killed escaping from

ary,

at no one would be'hurt if he rone to admit his part in it,
and he would be let out on low bail, and all that, which —
but he does not in any way deny that he made the statement*
The complete statement is set forth in the Appendiss
in this case and you will readily see that it contains plenty
of corroborative detail from which the Department would have
a right to believe that it was true and correct*
How, however, the question before the 14strict Court
was whether he was entitled to a hearing and, if sc?, whether ha
was entitled to be represented by counsel.
At the time we asked for certiorari, we intended to
raise both those issues here.

However, the Morrissey case

has effectively defeated us so far as the right to the hearing
itself is concerned because X cannot distinguish Morrissey frets
this case, although Morrissey involved parole and this one
involves probation*

Havertheless, the two are in law in­

distinguishable because our probationers are handled exactly
the same aa parolees.
There is one slight exception, but nothing that
would make a legal distinction.
. So, 1 am here now only on the question of the right
to counsel.

9
However, X would ask this Court:, if you can do so,
to clear up one thing for us.

Xt is very difficult for us to see how

m can

apply

strictly the Morrissey rule* to these ou£«o£~State supervised
eases.
In the first place, the preliminary hearing which
is mandated by Morrissey is going to be rather difficult to
— that's for lunch, isn't it?
(Whereupon, at 12:00 o'clock, noon, the oral
argument in the above-entitled matter was recessed, to
reconvene at 1:00 o'clock, p.m.s the same day.)

m. CHIEF

JUSTICE

BURNER:

Hr* Plats, you may

continue *
MS, PLATE:

May it please the Court.

I «as speaking of the interstate compact cases,
I suggest, Your Honor, that the Morrissey rule
has created a special problem in reference to those cases,
and, of course, to any case «here the probationer or paroles
lias absconded and «here his violations have occurred outside
of the State in which he «as on probation or parole.
Q

About the facilities that are involved in the

interstate compact, that is, assuming you had two States «ho
«are parties to that interstate compact, as between Illinois
and Wisconsin, you tsouldnrfc really have a problem, would you,
if you use the facilities and personnel of the Illinois system
to execute the function placed on it by Morrissey?
MR, PLATE:

Well, I don’t know that we have any

right to ask Illinois, under the compact.
provide for that.

The compact does not

The compact provides only for Illinois to

supervise our people and to report to us on what they have been
doing.
Q

It does not provide for them to hold hearings.
What specific part of Morrissey are you saying «***
MR, PLATE:

Well, actually, X suppose both, parts.

Both the preliminary and the —

% vtL
■*
*&•

Q

Well, in che preliminary are you talking about «hen

somebody is taken into custody, before he can be moved back
to the prison he has to have a hearing — seme kind of a
preliminary hearing?

It doesn't require a hearing before you

can put him in custody at that point.
ML Hi3Z:

Mo, thatrs tree.

2t does not require a

hearing before ho can be held in custody at that point.
Q

Well» «hat if you don* t have a compact with a State

and one of your probation or parolees goes to another state ami
is

and absconds, absconds and he is arrested there?
MR. HATEj

Well, «hat wa would have to do then would

he to issue a parole revocation warrant, charging him —
q

Yes.
MR* PLATE:

— charging him with absconding and

find out whether he will waive extradition, and if he will not
waive extradition -«
Q

So you are in no worse shape under Morrissey than

you have always been*
MR* PLATE:

That is true, except only for the fact

that — if you let m bring him back.

The only problem ms

that under Morrissey we then have to hold a hearing after we
get him back here on what it was that he did in Illinois or
wherever he was being supervised, and we may have to produce
the witnesses.
Q

Yes, but to extradite you would have to ehm some

12
kind of *»*• make some' showing, wouldn't you?
ME» PLATE:

WeIX, the only showing that we have to

make for extradition is the fact that be has been charged and
convicted -*
Q

But you would have eo?ae • sworn statement, or somethin-;;;,

That would ordinarily be sufficient to provide probable cause
for some official act.
MR. FLATZ:
Q

Yes, that’s right.

there is no evidentiary hearing involved, is there?
ME* PLATE:

Wot for extradition, no.

Q

Wo*

Or for the preliminary hearing in Morrissey.

Q

Morrissey is not an evidentiary hearing.

Q

For the first step.

Q

It is probable cause here.

It has been said

explicitly that this could be done in the most. informal way,
by statements of the parole officer »■*
MR. PLATZ:

In other words, if I understand Your

Honor correctly, then that m would be permitted, having returned
the man to Wisconsin in the extradition situation, to use just
statements that we would have obtained from the State where the
violation occurred, is that right?
Q

For what purpose?
ML PLATE;

For purpose of determining probable cause*

to hold him for violation of his probation or parole.
Q

Wall, no one of us can give advisory opinions.

13
I don’t know if you arc aware of that.,
MR. FtATZ:

Ho, 1 understand.

That’s right.

But then we still are eonfrotrted with, the necessity
of an evidentiary hearing for final action at which w® may hav©
to produce the witnesses who are in a position to testify to
what it was he did in that other State.
was
How, this may either he :1b a case where he/supervised
outside of the State that put him on probation or parole or
it may be in a situation where he has absconded from that State
aiid gone to another State where he got into some further
trouble, which did not, however, wind up with the conviction
of crime.
If it wound up wish a conviction of crime, I assume

that he would not be permitted, under the Morrissey Rule to
litigate that,
Q

lie would just establish that by «•»

That certainly is clear.
MEL PLATS:

In Scarpelli’s case, we had bis ccn«

feeslon, which probably would have had to be proved by inducing
one of the witnesses to the confession to come to Wisconsin
about it, X suppose, had the rule been' in force at the time
when Scarpelli violated it.
Q

Hot necessarily in person.

Parole hearings &m be

conducted on Interrogatories or any other such method.
MEL. FLATZ;

Well, if m can do it on interrogatories,,

that would be very helpful, of course, because we can’t «*■ s§e

have ao process whereby. we could get the witness to Wisconsin
from Illinois, for example, assuming he is unwilling to come.
Illinois is close, of course, but we’ve got people
at much greater distances than that.
Q

X have forgotten from, your briefs.

How many States

are in the interstate compact?
MR. PLATZ:

X think, just about all of them are nor-,

including Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, Sistrick of Columbia,
I think just about all of them are in it.

o

.......

provisions of the interstate compact to extend these additional
-services.
MR, PLATZ:

That may be, and, as a matter of fact, the

Council of State Governments is working on it and has proposed
a bill,which X have examined and X don’t think much of it,
because it seems to me to be quite insufficient for the purpose.
and X have so notified the Council.

X hope they can work out

some tiling better than they already have.
But so far at least, m are thrown more or less on
our own resources to comply with Morrissey in the interstate
cases.
Wow, coming to the question of counsel, and par**
tlcularly if we have to have counsel for the preliminary and
if the preliminary is to be held in another State and if
counsel has to fee appointed at public expense, this is going to

13
cause all kinds of problems* if the counsel lias to bo appointed
in a foreign State to represent a man who is not realty their
boy

at

Q

all, he*s ours.
Counsel at the probable cause hearing?
MR* PLATE:

At: the probable cause hearing, yes*

if there has to fee counsel at the probable cause hearing.
How, ?: would like to drop that and go on to the
«usSiam of counsel at the final hearing.
Q

X gather that final hearing is the on© before the

full parole board.
MR. PLATE:

Yes, except that in our situation the

Parol© Board doesn^t hear it, Your Honor.
Q

Who does?
BE. PLAWZ:

for that: purpose.

We have had to retain hearing examiners

We have had one for the last two years and

have no» added another one.
Q

And what kind,of hearing at that stag© do you read

Morrissey is required?
MR. PLATE:

We at that stage hold a hearing at which

evidence is taken to determine whether or not there has been
a violation and to determine whether or not the violation
warrants a revocation.
Q

Wnat rules of evidence do you follow?
MR. PLATE:

applicable in court.

Well ~~ not the rules of evidence
X think they admit anything that's

16

considered to fee relevans and probative.
What about affidavits? What about hearsay?
MS* PLATS,*

This would all be received *

However, m understated under Morrissey that if the
probationer or parolee says fee Barits to be confronted with the
people «ho have given information against hiss* then they have

What about the burden of persuasion?
Mi, PIATZ:

I don’t know whether that question

really has come up, . She question is «■*
Q

Morrissey never suggested beyond a. reasonable doubt,
MR. PlAl’Z:

Ho? Chat*3 right mid we don’t want to

apply my such burden either,
Q

You don’t consider it as a criminal proceeding

either?

MR* HA1Z; Ho, sir, wa do riot, We consider that
the question is whether the Bureau of Probation and Parole
in recommending revocation has acted arbitrarily and capriciously.
And, if not, then whether the violation which has
been established is ground for — actually justifies and
warrants the revocation.
Mow, on that point, of course, we run into another
si-'i© issue and that is what else can be considered - -besides this

particular violation?

ME.

that

is right.

VIMZ*.

He may rely on a great many things.

And certainly these files contain a great deal

of the man's history and matters which are officially known to
the department and known particularly to the Bureau of Probation
and Parole which is part of the department.

These things are

all known, not only personally, but on the record of the
department.
Q

That is,the matters which a judge can consider in

sentencing are coextensive with the matters which the parole
board can «« may consider properly on revocation -MR. PLATZ:

Yes, except, again, I mention it is not

the parole board.

The parole uoard grants parole in Wisconsin,

it does not revoke.
Revocation is initiated oy the Bureau of Probation
and Parole, which is a separate organisation.

It is the

organisation within the department which supervises the
probationers and parolees and which initiates the revocations.
The revocations, actually . the:.Signature on the
paper which makes the revocation final and gives it effect is
that of the Secretary of the department, and he acts, of
course, upon the advice of his people who are employed for
that purpose.
Starting with the Bureau of Probation and Parole,
then — now, of course, it has to go to the Examiner and the
Examiner then reports to the Assistant Secretary who reports
to the Secretary.
Q

What guidelines are there?
MR. PLATZ:

Guidelines?

Well, they are in writing.

I am sorry I am not aole to give them to you veroatim what
they are.
Q

But they do have printed guidelines?
MR. PLATZ:

Q

Well, they do have guidelines.

1 mean guidelines as to what is considered suf­

ficient for revocation of parole?
MR. PLATZ:
loose, though.

X would have to admit they are pretty

In other words, the agent has to decide on the

basis of what he knows auout this man, whether the time has
come when the man has to be taken off parole.
Q

Now --

If the man talks back to him, would that be grounds

enough?
MR. PLATZ:

If he talked back to him?

I don't

think so.
You see, what may oe sufficient in one caco is not
sufficient in another.
For example, a man may be convicted of another
crime.

In many instances, this would result in a revocation.

In a great many, it will not result in a revocation.
Q

But aren't there many that do not -«■ many revocations

that do not include conviction of crime?
MR. PLATZ:
Q

There are some, yes, surely.

And what guideline do you use for those?
None, am 1 correct?
MR, PLATZ:

I can’t say that.

I wouldn't say there are none.

No,

But neither can I give you what they are.

I am not that deep enough into it, and this record, of course,
doesn’t go into that.
Q

Here was a case

I suppose a probation officer is in a little bit

different position than a sentencing judge since he may have
been supervising the man on a week to week or month to month
basis over a period of years, and may have a closer acquaintance
«“Iri* that particular man than a sentencing judge would just on

/Jj
the basis of his probation officer's report
MR» PLATE:

That is right.

X would say that the

type of thing that he considers is pro'baoly very much the same
But, what I am concerned about is does all this have to ue
proved at the hearing,or can we take into account these facts
which are known officially to the department?
Q

Suppose you have an alleged commission of another

offense -» another crime, but the, as you call him, parole
agent, or whatever he may be, who has

oeen

supervising him

over a couple of years has overlooked as not justifying
revocation a number of infractions, for example, of the­
re s trie tions.

He shan’t leave the State and he’s left the

State two or three times.
has.

And that’s the kind of record he

And your question is, I suppose, whether, on the revoca­

tion, hearing, may that kind of evidence bear on the record to
be made at the revocation hearing.
*MR0 PLATE: - That could be an example, yes, that
sort of thing.
In other words,

the whole record this man has made

over the period of his supervision.
Q

Is your statement that the power to revoke or the

evidence that you may base revocation on is similar to that

a

judge may rely on when he is sentencing?
What becomes of confrontation then?

just sort of unregulated hearsay, a lot of it,

X mean that is
isn’t it?

21
MR. PLATE:

That’s what it is in Court, Your Honor

That’s what this.Court said was all right way back in
William? v. Hew York
Q

1 just wondered to what extent Morrissey is not

tenable any longer in a revocation hearing?
MR» PLATE:

That’s what I am asking this Court.

Is it tenable or isn’t it?

And if it: isn’t, why isn’t it?

If a court can act on that kind of information, then why
can’t the department which compiles the Information which is
considered good enough for a court to act on, why can't the
department act on it?
0

Well, the Morrissey opinion didn’t address itself

*>• »

MR. PLATE:

No, it didn't.

It did not.

That's

right, and that’s what we would like to know.
Q

Did it indicate a modification of Williams v. Hew

York?
MR. PLATE:

Ho, it did not.

It did not.

But it

did say that one of the questions that has to ue decided on
the basis of the hearing is whether the violation is suf­
ficiently serious to justify a revocation.
Q

Unless you think Morrissey requires confrontation

your interstate problems are negligible.
MR. PLATE:

That is true, but it does seem to me

that Morrissey requires confrontation if demanded by the

22
defendant

by the probationer or parolee

unless the

Examiner finds that to require confrontation 'would be dangerous
I am sorry 1 am not able to go into further what
I **« but I hope I have it well covered in my brief*

MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Plata.

Mr. Coffey,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM M. COFFEY, ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR. COFFEY:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:

I would very briefly like to first address myself
to the contention of the respondent that this matter is moot.
July 9, 1965, Gerald Scarp©111, on his plea of
guilty, was sentenced to 15 years in State penitentiary.
That sentence was stayed and he was placed mi
probation for 7 years.
That probation was ultimately revoked by the State
of Wisconsin, Department of Health and Social Services, in
September of 1965.
Q

That was within the 7 years, wasn't It?
MR, COFFEY:

It was within the 7 years, Your Honor,

but Scarpelli had filed a writ of habeas corpus in the State
of Wisconsin Supreme Court arid later in United

States

District Court, claiming that his probation was illegally

23
revoked in that he had not been granted a hearing prior to
revocation of that probation.
The United States District Court held Scarpelii's
claim to be valid9 held that he was entitled, as a matter of
constitutional law, to a hearing prior to any revocation of
his probation,
It also held that he was entitled to be represented
by counsel at that hearing.
The State of Wisconsin appealed that decision to
United States Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit, and the
District Court was affirmed.
In the interim period, the Wisconsin Supreme Court
also decided that as a matter of constitutional law that
Scarp©111*3 probation was illegally revoked in that he was
entitled to a hearing.
Q

Under whose constitution?
MR. COFFEY: The Federal Constitution, Your Honor.

Q

And did they purport to be following, or did they

consider themselves in any way bound by the 7th Circuit holding?
MR. COFFEY:

Mo, they did not.

I do not believe

there is anything in the Wisconsin opinion **• the Wisconsin
Supreme Court opinion -*» that you can. interpret as saying that
we are bound by the decision in Hahn v. Burke, and Hahn had
been the first case deciding he had a right to have a hearing.
Wisconsin has a statute that says that any time you

24
place a man on probation, during that term of probation, you
may modify the terms and conditions of probation and you may
extend the period of probation supervision.
Now, no matter how this Court resolves the right to
counsel issue, Scarpa 111 is entitled'or.was entitled to a
hearing prior to the revocation of his probation.
No one in the State of Wisconsin took any action
to extend Scarpa1111s probationary period,

'.oral

revocation of that probation, we contend, cannot operate to
extend that period of probation.
Q

You aren't abandoning your claim that he has a right

MR. COFFEY:

No, X am not, Your Honor.

X am just

talking first about the moot decision,
Q

The counsel issue la here, isn't it?
1®. COFFEY:

My position if the case is moot and

How can it be moot if the counsel issue is

validly here and you haven't abandoned it?

was

And there is

going to be a hearing at which you claim they have a right
to counsel.
Q

I guess the answer is you want to win the case for

your client and if it is moot and you win it that way you
will take that?
MR. COFFEY:

That is correct, Your Honor, in that

it would bo nay position that they can * t hold that theory.
You went into Morrissey v. Brewer in effect even
though you don't have a right to counsel.
ME. COFFEY:

That’s correct.

So X can go back to Wisconsin now and argue> l?tooka
yc-u had from •*- 7 years from July 1963 5 as of July 9, 1972,
the seven years has expired, you didn’t extend the probationary
period.

You no longer have any authority or control over this

man to give him a probationary «—°
Q

Is that under a Federal or State law?
MR. COFFEY:

Q

Which, Your Honor?

That proposition you just advanced.
HR. COFFEY:

There is no authority whatsoever in the

laws of the State of Wisconsin £0 extend this man’s probation..
Q

What makes it Federal law?
MR* COFFEY:

It is not a Federal law.

As a matter

of the operation of the State law, his probation wasn’t
extended.

His 7 years are up, and, therefore, no one has

extended that probationary period «»
Q

We know that the Wisconsin Supreme Court may not

say that for the purposes of that statute on this set of facts
it was extended?
MR. COFFEY:
not self-executing.

X don’t believe ~~ the statute is

Q

Don’t you have to

do you have to say that

pD£z±zr.c*ity. Brewer is retroactive to corns out with that
result?
HR. COFFEY:

X don't know the answer to that.

You

may very well have to.
0

Well, if you have to, Morrissey v. Brewer said it

wasrt51 re troact ive.
HR* COFFEY:

Correct*

But the position I am taking

is that the State of Wisconsin is not here contending that
Scarpelli is not entitled to a hearing.

They are not here

contending that Hahn v. Burke * which was decided by 7th
Circuit Court of Appeals, isn't the law.
Q

Did Morrissey involve probation or parole?
MR* COFFEY:

Morrissey involved parole.

Hahn v.

Burke,which is out of the 7th Circuit, involved probation.
Scarpelli involves probation.
Q

Is Scarpelli out now or is he confined?
MR. COFFEY:

Scarpelli is out.

He is presently out,

X believe, on both State and Federal parole.
Q

And your position is he’s out, just as if had

served an expired sentence, in effect, and was freed at the
end of that sentence?
MR* COFFEY:
Q

That’s correct.

Or put it another way, he’s out in the same legal

posture as though his parole had never -** his probation had

27

never been revoked»
MR. COFFEY:
Q

That’s correct.

In fact or law»
MR. COFFEY:

Correct.

The revocation was illegal and, therefore, nothing
told the running of it.

The seven years have ex|

the question is moot.
I'll leave the mootness question for a moment to go
to counsel.
In Morrisseyo this Court held that due process
required a hearing prior to the revocation of parole.
The Court's decision is based on the determination
or the finding by this Court that this is a procedure or a
proceeding where an individual, if he loses his freedom,
even though conditional, suffers a grievous loss, and,
therefore, due process applies.

The question is, what

processe is ,due?
In Morrisseys the Court recommends -*» suggests
that it is constitutionally mandated for a parolee that the
procedure include a written notice, a disclosure of the
evidence against parolee, an opportunity to be heard in
person -**Q

A disclosure of evidence or a recital of the

ultimate facts —
MR. COFFEY:

A recital of the conditions he is

28
alleged to have violated and the basis on which
Q

Not the evidence against him?
ME, COFFEY:

1 am sorry, and the basis on which

you claim he violated conditions of his parole, an opportunity
to be heard, to present witnesses, documentary evidence, the
right to confront and cross-examine witnesses, with the
exception that you don’t have the right of confrontation if
there is

a

determination that it is a danger to the witness.
He is entitled to a neutral and detached hearing

officer, and he is also entitled to a written statement of
the evidence relied on and the reasons for revoking the
pa?;ole.
Mow, to grant that right to parolees and to
/■’j

recognise that a parolee is entitled constitutionally to that
kind of a hearing, suggests that there is no real distinction
or difference between probationers and parolees, and, in fact,
with a parolee, you are dealing with someone that has been
in the Institution, that has served a sentence and the
question is just whether he is going to be returned.
With the probationer, you are dealing with a person
who has never been in the inaitufion.
And in Wisconsin, the judicial determination made
at the time someone is placed on probation, is that the person
1® not likely again to commit crime and is not a threat to
the community, and, therefore, should not suffer the penalty

29
of incarceration.
0

If he, in fact,•commits some crime, what happens to

ail these theories?
MR. COFFEY:

At least at the moment probation is

granted, that's the determination that is made.

Subsequent

events may prove that to be erroneous as subsequent events
prove many things erroneous.
Q

But probation, by and large

or at least «** if

you put it: another way ***• probation is granted to first
offenders as the largest single class of all probationers,
isn’t that correct?
MR. COFFEY:

1 believe that would be accurate, yes.

And then, this is an individual who has never been
put in the penal institution.

So xm believe that all of the

reasoning and alt of the rationale of Morrissey and parolees
applies with equal force to the probationer and that tue same
hearing requirements should be required in terms of the
probationer as in the parolee.
The question in this case is if Morrissey is
extended to probation revocation proceedings, and the same
type of hearing, as is set forth in Morrissey, is required
in probation revocation proceedings, does that mean also that
the individual is entitled to be represented by /counsel,
either counsel of his own choosing — retained counsel that is,
or court appointed counsel?

30
So X thinkj on the basis of some decisions,
Goldberg v. Kelly, and the like, of this Court, there could
he an argument made that the person that is in the position
to retain his own attorney, under the precedents of this Court,
is clearly entitled to be represented by counsel, am! the
only really open question is -whether the Indigent is entitled
to fee represented by appointed counsel?
Q

Does Wisconsin permit lawyers to be present at

revocation hearings?
MR, GOPFBY:

Yes, they do, Your Honor.

It is

interesting that Scarce111 arises in Racine County.

For 5

S years prior to Halm v. Burke,or any of these cases, the
State of Wisconsin, Milwaukee County, which is the meat
populous county in the State by a large number, is a city of
the first class

*■« in Milwaukee Comity, for 5 or 6 years,

prior to 197.0, probation violators were given a hearing and
a lawyer.
The only places you didn't get a hearing and a lawyer
i

were in counties outside of Milwaukee County.
However, since"these cases, the Wisconsin Supreme
Court has decided that both probationers and parolees are
entitled to hearing, and they also have decided that they are
entitled fco be represented by lawyers, and that they are
entitled fco fee represented by court appointed lawyers if they
cannot afford to hire their own.

31
Q

Thia is based on the Federal Constitution?

Wisconsin Supreme Court*s decision?

The

Or under the Wisconsin

Constitution?
ME. COFFEY:
Q

Under the Federal Constitution*

Is the Bug Process Clause of the Wisconsin

Constitution essentially the same as the Federal?
MR. COFFEY: Yea, It Is, Your Honor.

Xfc is almost

word for word.
Q

Did they, decide under the Due Process Clause or

under the Sixth Amenuasont?
Id.:..' EE/FEII:

tidier the Ere Freeoer Clause, Your

Honor.
Q

Just right aesross the board on all oases?
ME. COFFEY:

Well, what happened is -** it mis kind

of a long involved procedure.
Hahn v. Burke, as decided by the 7th Circuit Court
h

of Appeals, said you had a right to a hearing In a probation
revocation ease.
After Hahn v. Burke, the Wisconsin Supreme Court
decided State ex rel. Johnson v. Cady, and said that ’
■.

probationers and parolees were entitled to hearings -prior to
the revocation, but they were not entitled to court appointed
counsel.

Then, Scarpa111 was decided by the United States
District Court and then by the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals,

I think you could draw that distinction,

MR. COFFEE:

X assume that if this Court rejects

*.

the argument that counsel is required at probation or parole
revocation proceedings* that the Wisconsin Supreme Court may
very well reevaluate its position.
Q

Since it depended on the Federal Constitution »1®L COFFEY:

1 think that they decided It is a

matter of Federal Constitutional law.

But in the sequence

X thought you said »• of

these Supreme Court cases in Wisconsin, there was a stage
where they said there was no requirement to appoint counsel*

MU C(WF3&:

1 think also important is the ABA recognises

the function of a lawyer — the role that the lawyer can play **and the ABA ininlmun standards for criminal justice, the
standards relating

to

probation.

The American Bar Association recommendation is that
people facing probation revocation ha provided with counsel,
and they state the central task of ascertaining whether the
prisoner has committed the acta alleged and measuring the acts
proven against the standard to which he was obliged to conform,
is precisely the business of the criminal trial itself, «her©

36
the sight to the assistance of counsel has fcson recognised

It would seem patently at \mv with the. central
concept of procedural justice to deny to a parcor?, with his
liberty at ©take the opportunity to hear and meet the
specific charge against him with the benefit of counsel.
Xn this case, in Wisconsin, as X am sure in moat
other places, Gerald Scarpelll was on seven years probation.
Gerald Scarpellt could have done sir years, eleven months and.
ten days on probation, and he could then have had his pro­
bation revoked and a fifteen year sentence executed, and ho
would have received no credit for the six years and eleven
months, and whatever number of days, it was he was on pro*»
batlon, because it is dead time.
Whan a man is facing the possible loss of fifteen
years of his life in a very substantial period of incarceration
in a penal institution, it saens to me that if you are going
to give him a hearing, which I think is and should be
constitutionally mandated and required, that to make that
hearing meaningful and to have form- 'and not just to have form
*

but to have substance to the hearing, there has to be counsel
involved.

3?
X

think that this

Court pointed out in Chief Justice

Burger's opinion in Morrissey the person running the hearin
and the people that set up the rules and procedures can see
to it that the hearing in conducted to only issues that are
germane and relevant to the determination as to whether
probation should be revoked.
Q

Since you are relying on Due process Clause# you

are nevertheless saying — or are you saying —• that a© an
invariable principle# or an invariable rule# you mmt have
counsel at probation and parole revocation hearings?
MR* COFFEY:
Q

Yes, sir.

Is it possible, Counsel, that the processes of

* probation and parole will *- could

get m

weighted down with

burdens that as a policy decision the States might say for
themselves, apart from the Federal Government, that it is just
too difficult to get this kind of a program working, and so
we will abandon it?

2s that

M&* COFFEY:

&

possibility?

X would only state,! can only state in

response. Chief Justice, that, yes, X think, sure, there is

a

possibility of that if the persons that set up the procedures

and conduct the hearing allow them to become too cumbersome
end too* much like a criminal trial, yes, but: X don’s think
thane 1b any need for that, and X don’t think that’s what
anyone is asking for or requiring.
X think also

«MS*

38
Q

You &on*t think lawyers . appointed lawyers will'

turn these proceedings into criminal trials or make them as
close to that m possible?

Me COFFEY:

2 suggests. Mr. Justice White, that

criminal lawyers will do what they are permitted to do, and
If you have a hearing essaminer or you have a procedure adopter,
for a particular State that will allow the criminal lawyer
to turn it into criminal trial, he may very well.

But I suggest

that X think Morrissey makes it clear that that7a not the
procedure or the requirement this Court is setting upland
that it is the obligation or the duty of those persons that
arc setting up these procedures to see to it and conduct those
hearings in a way that they don*t become criminal trials.
Q

2£ the State of Uisconsin9 for example, created a

corps or staff of lawyers attached to thee© Institutions of
confinement on a permanent basis and just by rotation furnished
them as counsel, would that satisfy the due process claim to
counsel?
MR. COFFEY:

X think, Your Honor, any time you

provide legal counsel and it is effective, yes, it .satisfies
the due process claim.

’

. ,

I also think that has bean suggested in Argegsingeg
and probably also in Morrissey *»« she University of Wisconsin
Law School — they have a clinical program sat up at Waupun,
the State institution.

39
Q

Do you think those have to he lawyers admitted to

practice or can they be trained personnel* short of being
lawyers admitted to practice law?
MR. COFFEY:

X, personally» would have no difficulty

with trained persons other than lawyers conducting the hearings
cr representing the defendants » as long as someone was in a
position to determine whether or not a man had a defense or
anything in mitigation of the violation that is alleged to
have been committed.
Q

Other than just legal argument3 which you have

presented to uss is there some empirical consideration that
you might advert to?

Are there some studies made that

indicate that probation parole revocations are particularly
unreliable or that there have been grave miscarriages of
justice» or is this just a deductive approach that due
process requires hearings, due process requires lawyers, and
so on?
MR. COFFEY:

Q

Hr. Coffey, you have given us your subjective

evaluation and these things are sometimes helpful, your
own evaluation based on your ctm experience, but from that
same experience, would you say that there is -ray evidence that
probation and parole officers tend to be prosecution minded,
that they are trying to get people off the street and back
into institutions, or is the contrar;
HR. COFFEY:

I would think, Mr. Chief Justice, that

there are (probably as many answers to that question as there
are probation and parole officers.
X don’t mean to stand here and suggest that any
large percentage of probation and parole officers are in a
hurry to put people back in Institutions, but probation and
parole officers are human, they are subject to the same
deficiencies as the rest of us, there are personality conflicts

Q

Isn't it a widely accepted proposition In the

community of professional probation and parole people that
every return to the prison represents a failure of the
supervising officer?

Isn't that a known standard?

a great deal of power, and they don’t have a lot of guidelines
