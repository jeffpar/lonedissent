PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Me will hear arguments now

in Mo, 71-1523, Hunt against McNair.
You may proceed now, Mr, Figg.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT MeCORMICK FIGG, JR,, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
ME. FIGG:

This is an appeal from the judgment of

the Supreme Court of South Carolina which upheld against
a challenge, under the First Amendment of the Constitution of
the United States, a transaction between the State of South
Carolina and the Baptist College At Charleston made under a
1969 statute entitled the Educational Facilities Act.
The transaction on behalf of the State was to be
conducted by its Educational Facilities Authority which this
Act provided should be the State's Budget and Control Board.
That Board is composed of the Governor, the State
Treasurer, the Controller General, and two legislative chair*»
men e:t officio.

It is the core of the State Government.

It

is the governing board of the State's departments of Finance,
Property and Personnel and the Act gives it these duties
which I shall refer to, quote, "as an incident of its functions
in connection with the public finances of the State," unquote.
The Baptist College at Charleston is an activity of
the South Carolina Baptist Convention and it is chartered to,
quote, "operate a Baptist liberal arts college for educational

4
purposes," unquote.
It manages the affairs of the college in trust for
the South Carolina Baptist Convention.

And the courts below ha

found that it is a religious activity, and that the question
is properly raised in its case under the First Amendment, even
though they didn’t agree with our view of the decision.
Under this transaction, what is happening here is
that the State, under its own constitution, cannot give a grant
to a religious insifcution to construct a building or a facility
even though it is of a neutral purpose, because its awn con­
stitution prohibits direct or indirect aid to

a

sectarian

institution.
And our court has said that that means that no
State funds can be given to a religious institution.
It undertakes, therefore, to authorise the Budget and
Control Board which, as I say, is the core of the State Govern­
ment, to issue South Carolina State revenue bonds which would
give the purchasers immunity from Federal income taxation

on

the interest, and thereby benefit the institution.
To that extent, it enables, in other words,
borrowing on behalf of the college to be at a lower rate of
interest than would otherwise apply.
And it uses, in order to accomplish this, the format
of legislation under which what were commonly known as selfliquidating projects

were authorised back in 1933 and 934 and

5
by other acts under which electrical systems and water works
and whatnot were financed out of the earnings of an operation
and out of the profits, the fees, that were derived from the
consumers,
Q

Did they ever default on a revenue bond to the extent

that you could call that a default?
MR. FIGG:
Q

Ho, no.

In this case?
In the experience of the State, if you

happen to know?
MR. FIGG:
Q

If our State has ever defaulted?

Yes.
MR. FIGG:

On the contrary.

Our Supreme Court has

made the statement, in one case, that in this enlightened age
the State would not allow one of its revenue bond issues to
go into default even though it is not technically liable on
them.

And we’ve never had a default on a revenue bond issue,

of the electric or the water works or the others.
How, the State did have one revenue bond issue
issued on what we call the South Carolina Public Service
Authority, the Sam T. Cooper Hydroelectric Project, but those
bonds have been paid out of the operation of an electrical
system and the charges to consumers.
Now, this Is a little different, though, from the
usual self"liquidating project, because here they do not let
the project issue the bonds and then pay off out of its

6
operation because the project is the college.

And the college

issuing revenue bonds would not be able to give the purchaser
the tax immunity which the State can give.
So what the State does is to take a conveyance from
the Baptist College of a part of its campus, then it leases it
back at an agreed rent -- leases that campus back at an
agreed rental — and that rental is, of course, calculated to
pay off the principle and interest of the bonds which the State
has issued.
Now, the Act provides that this authority, the
Budget and Control Board, that is the State Government’s core,
issue and sell to the public State of South Carolina general
revenue bonds payable principle and interest only from the
rent to be received by the Board under the lease.
And those proceeds, as I said, are to be spent in a
general program because it is not just for religious colleges.
It is for all non-public colleges in the State and for
religiously neutral facilities, just buildings and facilities.
But in order to make the bonds saleable, the State
Board is empowered by this Act to fix and revise from time to
time and charge and collect fees and charges for the use of and
for the services furnished by the project.
So that while the bonds are issued pledged against
the rents, the rents will never change because you don’t need
to raise or lower the rents.

The rent is calculated to be the

7
amount required to pay off the bond issue.
What the Board has to do with, in seeing that the
rent is paid is to have to do with the adequacy of the fees
and charges for the use of the project. Just as in an electrica
project the project itself would raise or lox*er the rates»
here, the State assumes by legislation and responsibility in
that regard.
In fact, the Act says that a bond holder can compel
the authority to exert that power to fix and revise from time
to time and charge and collect fees and charges for the us©
of the project.
Q

Mr. Figg, raay they also cut expenses in order to be

sure that the net rental is —
MR. FIGG:

I don't know that they are specifically

authorised to do that, but they are commanded to see that
enough fees and charges are charged by the college to pay the
maintenance, the repair and the operation of the college.
That’s the first group that is to be taken into account in
fixing and revising the fees and, then, next, pay the
sufficient to pay the principle and interest on the bonds.
Ordinarily, of course, you would think that rent came
in operating.

That shows you the language here is more

referrable in its wording to an ordinary self-liquidating
project, but it does point up the fact that the income —* the
funds that are pledged for these bonds are these student fees

8
and charges, not just the rent, because there would be no
rent.

If the fees and charges are not adequate, the rent

wouldn’t be paid.

If the fees and charges are too high and

the student body is cut down, perhaps the rent wouldn’t be
paid.
If the college got discouraged, perhaps the project
would cease.
What would happen then?
We think the State, under a power given to operate
these projects, would have to step in for the bond holders and
see that the religious activity is operated.
Q

What are the practicalities of this?

Why can’t this

college do this itself?
MR. FIGG:

Well, just as all other colleges do,

Mr. Justice, I think it can and I think it’s an annual
performance, especially in these days of changing cost, it’s
been an annual performance that student fees at virtually all
institutions are not only fixed every year but are fixed higher
every year.

The requirements have been going up, and, of

course, to some extent, that affects the patronage.
Q

Iteow that, but what I am trying to get at is what

is the reason for the South Carolina legislation* what brought
it into being?

Were the colleges unable to do this kind of

thing?
MR. FIGG:

The reason was that the colleges, I suspect

9
were having trouble from the fact that» not being public, their
tuition fees have been larger and, therefore, their student
patronage has been smaller.
And the State has interested itself because of that
fact.

It has been recognised by this Court to be a public

purpose to stimulate education and the State is undertaking,
I suppose, to protect itself against having to take over the
load that has been carried by some 21 private colleges in
South Carolina.
Q
statute,

Now, you are here asking us to invalidate the
Would you throw the whole statute out?
MR. FXGC:

I would think that our position,under the

First Amendment, is that what involves the State Board, that
is, the Board of Budget and Control, in guarding against
i

default on these bonds, we think that it has to keep itself
informed, to oversee to an extent the fiscal operations of
this college.
We think that it is too late when default has
occurred.

We think that it has a duty,if not spelled out in

so many words, so strongly implied by the powers that are given
to the State Board in respect to the payment of these bonds,
we think it has a duty to see that the student fees and
charges are at all times going to be calculated to keep that
rent coming in in the amount that will discharge the bonds.
If this were an ordinary self-liquidating project,

10
the college alone would, in the first instance, fix its
income, and then if that weren’t sufficient, as I recall, a
trustee would be appointed by the court to operate the
project and to adjust the fees so that the project would pay
out.

And this is the normal setup, I believe, of a self-

liquidating project.
Q

Let me repeat my question.
MR. FIGG:

Q

Yes, sir,

You are asking us -- well, you are attacking the

statute here,

What I am asking you is, in your theory, does

the entire statute fall or would you be content if certain of
the powers granted were rejected?
I®. FIGG:

Well, I would think that the unconsti­

tutional parts of the statute, if it is unconstitutional, are
those under which the duty is either expressly or by implica­
tion or the function is put upon the State Board to fix and
adjust from time to time the charges.
Q

You do not claim that the State lending its credit

is unconstitutional in the sense that by lending its credit
the institution gets a much lower interest rate on its bonds,
and that degree of benefit you do not content is unconstitu­
tional?
MR. FIGG:

We do not contend that.

So you are going strictly on the entanglement theory
rather Chan any benefit theory?

11
MR. FIGG:

That's right, Mr. Justice.

We think it is strictly an excessive entanglement
propositiori.

We think that the. two things that we

ask the Court,or submit to the Court, are entanglement of an
undesirable nature, under the First Amendment„
One is that the State should busy itself with the
operating affairs of a religious activity to be sure that it
pays off bonds issued in the narae of the State.
And the other is that it be under the eventual
possibility of having to take over and operate it because it,
in effect, is the operator of the project when you apply a
self-liquidating piece of legislation to it.
Q

Your response prompts the question -- hypothetical

question — if you will permit it.

Suppose the State, having

made the judgment that you suggested earlier, the State made
the judgment that rather than build two new universities,or
three, it would offer to these colleges in the State that they
would build needed buildings on their campus or near it and
lease these buildings to the church-related college.

Straight

leasing arrangement.
Would you think that that was unconstitutional?
MR. FIGG:

It wouldn't seem so under the First

Amendment, as I understand the holding of this Court in
the Tilton case,
Q

You think this is pretty close to Tilton, then, if

12
you had that approach?
MR. FIGG:

That’s right.

And I think that if the

State of South Carolina hadgiven these people the money to
build this and walked away and forgot about it, as the
Government did in Tilton except for the covenant against
religious use, I think that it would have been valid under the
First Amendment.
Our State couldn’t do that because of its own
constitution.
And so, this has been the approach, to adapt the
ordinary self-liquidating project legislation to getting around
its own constitution which prohibits it from doing what the
Government did in the Tilton case.
So that —
Q

Before you go on, I think you said that there were

twenty-one private colleges in South Carolina Chat benefit or
have the right to benefit from this fund, or this Board.
I take it from what you’ve just said in response to
the Chief Justice’s question that if you had a non-sectarian
college you wouldn’t be here.
MR. FIGG;
Q

That’s right.

What percentage of the student body at this college

is Baptist?
MR.- FIGG:

Certainly not all.

student body would be mostly Baptist.

I believe that the
I would say the majority

13
is Baptist:.

Sixty percent, I am told by my colleague who is

better acquainted with the affairs of the institution than 1
am.
Q

No restriction on taking non-Baptists, then, 1 take

it?
MR. FIGG:
Q

None at all.

I would like to ask you another question, since I’ve

interrupted you.
The record may show it, but 1 don’t recall it.
You referred to the responsibility of the State, as I under­
stood you, to fix the fees charged students in order to assure
that revenues are sufficient.
Is that the way the statute reads or does the
indenture merely impose covenants on the college itself to fix
fees that are adequate to service the debt?
MR. FIGG:

On page 41 of the jurisdictional state­

ment, which is where the Act itself is set out, under Subseetio
(1), it reads, "The Authority may fix,revise, charge and
collect rates, rents, fees, charges for the use of and for the
services furnished or to be furnished by each project and may
contract with any person,1 and so forth, “in respect to it.
Such rates, rents, fees and charges shall be fixed and adjusted
in respect of the aggregate or rates, rents, fees and charges
from such projects, so as to provide funds sufficient with
other revenues, if any, (1) to pay the cost of maintaining,

repairing and operating the project, and each and every portion
thereof to the extent that the payment of such cost has not
otherwise been adequately provided for; (2) to pay the principle
of and the interest on outstanding revenue bonds under the
Authority issued in respect of such projects,as the same shall
become due and payable in (3)," and so forth.
0

I see that now,
MR, FIGG:

fforth,

And then it provides, "such rates," and so

"shall not be subject to supervision or regulation by

any other department, commission, board," and so forth,
"other than the Authority."
Now, the other place for fixing of rates and fees is
on page 36.
"The Authority is given the power to determine the
location and character of any project to be financed, to
construct, reconstruct, model, maintain, repair, operate,
lease as lessee or lessor," and so forth.
And then it is to'designate a participating in­
stitution for higher education as its agent to determine the
location and to build it and operate it, and, as the agent of
Authority, to enter into the contracts for any or all of such
purposes, including contracts for the management and operation
of such projects,»
So the authority legislatively given is to the —
the power legislatively given to the Authority Is to do all of

15
this and to constitute the college as its agent in accomplish!»
its construction, its operation, its financing, its fee
charging, and everything else.
And then (f), to issue bonds.

That®3 the bond

section.
And, (g), generally, to fix and revise from time to
time and charge and collect rates, rents, fees and charges for
the use of or for the services furnished or to be furnished by
a project, or any portion thereof, and to contract, and so
forth*

And to establish rules and regulations for the use

of a project.
How, I am not sure that all of that language would
be in just those words if the Act had been tailored for this
particular transaction,
I think that what has occurred is that language of
fee.ordinary self-liquidating project statute has been put in
here and the Authority, thereby, has been endowed with the
powers of Che ordinary operator of a self-liquidating project.
And if it is going to do what the statute says that
it is empowered to do, and if the bond holders, under Subsectioi
(n) of the Act,have a right to go to court and get an order
that it do, it has got to be well posted on the daily and the
monthly and the yearly affairs of this college.

It has got to

do what the ordinary responsible project would do for itself
in overseeing the operation.

16
And, wo submit that this whole fee provision, these
fee powers, after all, fixing fees is a continuous process.
There is no formula for it.
Q
action?

It involves estimates -•

Mr. Figg, what is your client’s standing in this
How does he claim he was harmed by this statute?
MR. FIGG:

He is a citi2en and taxpayer whose

interests would be affected
Q •

If you prevail, you are not going to prevent the

expenditure of any tax monies, are you?

If you prevail and

simply get some of the restrictions taken off, presumably no
tax monies are going to be saved.
MR. FIGG:

I think the -spending of tax monies has

been avoided by this process.
Q

You concede there is no aid — your complaint is

not that there is aid being given in violation of the Religion
Glauses?
MR. FIGG:

There lias been no aid given in violation

of the First Amendment.
Q

There has aid been given.

It just isn’t in

violation?

MR, FIGG:
Q

It is only entanglement that you are concerned about?

MR. FIGG:
Q

I don’t think so,

What is the entanglement?

Ho, I say you are only concerned about the en-

tanglement.

Then, going back to Justice Rehnqttis£s question,

17
how does the entanglement produce a standing platform for your
clients?
MR, FIGG:

Hell, we would say, if Your Honor please,

I suspect that we don’t have a standing problem in this case
under the State procedure.

If there is a standing problem

under the First Amendment, then it arises for the first time
in this Court.

That question hasn’t been raised below and

the court below considered the plaintiff had standing, I
believe.
on appeal.

In the Circuit Court, the question wasn’t raised
It wasn’t raised the first time this case came up

to this Court, and it hasn’t been raised on the second time.
Q

Well, maybe if there is a standing question, or if

there was a standing question, perhaps there isn’t one any more.
ML FIGG;

That could very well be.

I must confess

that I haven’t given too much thought to the question of
standing because before I entered this case the Court had bean
satisfied on the standing of the plaintiff and the question has
never come up, and we didn’t anticipate that that would be.
As I’ve tried to make plain, I don't see anything
but an entanglement question, but I do think that the respon­
sibility is put upon the State Government.

I would think that

this plaintiff who has brought his complaint as a citizen and
a resident of the State of South Carolina, the State has
recognized that he has some Interest in its operation here.
Its courts have recognized that interest.

And I think it could

IS
very well be that his interest in the *»- since this is a
controversey between one of its citizens in the State of South
Carolina as to whether it is violating the fundamental law of
the United States as well as of the State which he first
challenged; ~ - he challenged both -- that this Court could very
well consider that it is the standing between the citizen and
his Government, rather than a monetary standing under the First
Amendment,
I am not sure that the First Amendment is necessarily
a monetary question,

I think that question goes beyond,

perhaps, the amount of taxes he might have to pay or any other
question.
And, to conclude, if Your Honors please, the
entanglement of fixing fees, we think, which involves the
previous yeafs surplus or deficit, the amount of maintenance
expected, the repairs, insurance, the depreciation, salaries,
wages, supplies, rent, and so forth, that all of that has
got;

to be taken into account by the State in advance of the

fixing of fees.

Default is to be guarded against and not

awaited before the State would take action in discharge of these
statutory duties.
And, in the event that the college proved unable or
unwilling to continue, then we think that in the end the fact
that the State would have to see to the operation of this
religious activity to pay off the bonds, in itself would produce

objectionable entanglement between Government and church
activity.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Figg.

Mr. Sinkier,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF HUGER SINKLER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. SINKLER:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I certainly hope that the appellant here is regarded
as having standing because this case does have some significanee, not only in South Carolina

but throughout the United

States,
This type of statute, this particular statute, was
adapted from the Massachusetts statute.
You have similar statutes in New Jersey which
yesterday filed an amicus brief, late in this case, which I
hope Your Honors will entertain.
There are similar statutes in Ohio, that I know of
because I have had correspondence with bond counsel out there.
And quite a number of bonds have been issued in the State of
New York.
We were lucky enough to have, somehow or other,
foreseen from the trend, the dissents perhaps, what might
happen in Tilton and Lemon in dissents, so when we started
this case in 1970 we raised this First Amendment

had the

20
question raised.
This is a declaratory judgment suit -Q

What do you mean when }?ou say you had the question

raised?
MR. SINKLER:

Well, because, as bond counsel, it is

our duty to see that all possible questions involving the
constitutionality of the Act were properly presented and
disposed of before people would be invited to buy bonds based
on the statute.
Q

The statute had serious implications.

But it takes adversary litigation -MR. SINKLER:

This is adversary litigation of the

test suit variety which is quite frequent in all State courts
to determine questions of constitutionality of statutes.
We felt that this did raise serious questions.
There have been countless millions of dollars of bonds sold
in this particular area.

None can be sold now as a consequence

of the pendency of this litigation.
While it is not particularly significant to the
Baptist College because this litigation lasted so long they
came along and financed most of their -- got most of their
most of their problems with a private loan — they still have
an application before the Board — it is important to the
twenty-seven colleges that -- other colleges in South Carolina
which need this type of help,
Q

Are you employed by the State?

21
MR. SINKLER:.

In this particular case, we’ve been

associated -- we were actually originally employed -«•
Q

But you are representing the Governor?
MR. SINKLER:

yes.

At the request of the Attorney General,

With his permission and at his request.
Q

So you are speaking for the State?
MR. SIWKLER:

Taking the position of the State, yes,

in urging you to hear and decide the case in favor of the State,
Wow, to get to the merits, I would like to go back
a bit and explain the nature of this transaction because it
is not the ordinary self-liquidating type of revenue bond that
really gained its prevalance in the '30’s, at a time when my
friend and I served in the South Carolina Legislature together
and had a lot of those statutes.
This is comparable to the normal industrial develop­
ment revenue bond which have been going on and 1 think gained
their ascendancies in the ’bO’s,
What happens here is this.
It makes this lease with the college.

The Authority takes title.
In this lease, it sets

up the covenants which the college has got to perform.

It

then mortgages the project to a trustee bank, and at the same
time assigns to that trustee bank its rights under the lease.
So that, actually, the State is nothing more nor
less than a conduit.
Wow, the statute spells out what the State could do,

22
but actually once this contract is made the State steps aside.
The trustee bank takes over just as in the case of all indus­
trial development bonds, so that the bond holder looks to the
trustee to enforce his rights, not to the State.
Q

Then, you are saying that the trustee bank cannot

be an agent of the State in any way?
MR. SINKLER:
the State

It may be deemed to be an agent of

in the sense that it is exercising — but it is

actually really acting in a fiduciary capacity.
I think a trustee is in one sense an agent but it
is an agent, not at that stage, for the State.
for the bond holders which it represents.

It is an agent

That*s its primary

duty, because the trustee bank receives the money, pays it
out and, under the indenture,forces the rights and remedies of
Che bond holders.
That’s, frankly, a routine type of financing in the
industrial revenue bond field and in this college type of

field.
Q

This record contains no trust instrument of any kind?
MR. SINELER:

I don't think it contains -- does not

contain the trust instrument, but what it does contain are
rules and regulations that the State Board adopted following
Tilton.
In those regulations, it prescribes that there shall
be a lease and it prescribes that there shall be an indenture,

23
a trust indenture.
I think you will find those on

let me see if 1

can pick up my -- beginning on page 47 in the Jurisdictional
Statement, are the regulations relating to the functioning of
the Authority which spell out just exactly what takes place.
So that, as I see it, in the, in Tilton, there was
an outright grant of money, but there was also the covenant
not to violate the religious

make use of the property for

religious purposes.
Me have to do that in a slightly different way
because we are not granting money and we can’t make the
institution pay us back.

Me’ve given them nothing. There

is nothing to take back.
So what we do is to subject that property to a
covenant that will not be used, and so long as the institution,
or any voluntary grantee of that institution, owns

this proper

if can’t use if for religious purposes.
Now,that part of our regulations and the holding —
the plurality holding in Tilton,seem to me to be identical.
The only difference here is that we are not granting
money, we are really taking advantage of a provision in the
Internal Revenue Code to give these people tax exempt bonds.
Now, that’s actually rather significant.

On a

million dollars, you can save at least 2%.
When this college, actually, refinanced most of Its-"

?

24

the money that it originally wanted to get.
The application is now cut down from
noted that to the Court

and we

from about $3-^ million to about

$1 million.
Q

Mr. Sinkler, may I interrupt you just a minute?
Have bonds actually been issued by any denominational

college in South Carolina, under this —* ?
MR. STICKLER:
Q

This is the first?
MR. SINKLER't

Q

Not in South Carolina, no, sir.

This is absolutely the first.

Right.
MR. SINKLER:

But they have been elsewhere, sir.

They have been elsewhere, and I thinlc the fact that in New
Jersey, for some reason or other, their litigation stopped
on the remand, didn't come back up, I think they are really
twin cases.

So they filed a petition yesterday to file an

amicus, which X hope you all will grant.
Q

X think you said at the outset, Mr. Sinklar, also,

there is an Ohio case or was that just correspondence -MR. SINKLER:

Some of the people out there had talked

to me about the fact -- I don't know whether there is an Ohio
case testing the validity of your statute or not.
don’t know that, sir.

1 really

I should know the answer to that and

I am sorry I don't, but you might look because I am sure that
bonds have been issued in Ohio, New York, that 1 know of.

25
Massachusetts
Q

3

I am practically certain --

The New Jersey decision came here before, did it

not?
ME, SINKLER:

Yes,

You treated South Carolina and

New Jersey exactly alike.
Q

Mew Jersey Supreme Court sustained -MR. SXMLER:

Just the same as South Carolina, about

the same effect.
Their statute, they say they vary their procedure,
if you*11 notice, in their amicus brief, they use — and they
may be a little better, frankly, it might be a little less
entangling.
I think it is a distinction without a difference.
Me use this lease and you assign the rights to the
lease to the trustee bank and you take it over there.
In Mew Jersey, they use the loan agreement approach,
which we have used in other types of financing in South
Carolina, but not in this,
Q

Mr. Sinkier, do you agree with what I understand to

be your adversary’s explanation of a controversey here that
the dispute is whether the credit shall be pledged with or
without the condition,that neither of you dispute that it’s
proper to pledge the credit of the State in this type of
situation?
.MR. SINKLER:

Me 11, I think, as

I

understand it, and

26
1 hope I understand it, he simply alleges that the machinery
or device that we have employed, viz., the lease in the State
agency which has these powers which are all translated into
the lease agreement.

He claims that involves entanglement

which is forbidden under the decisions of this Court.
Q

If you were to prevail, what sort of relief ought

he to get?
MR. SINKLER:

He should get very narrow relief, I

would think, Your Honor.
I would simply say that I don't see anything wrong
with the thing except the fact that he might — you might want
to say that the State Board could not do these things, but I
think, the Stage Board ought to be allowed to supervise a lease
agreement which would contain all these covenants.
Q

Mr. Figg's argument pus2led me for a moment because

I thought, as Mr. Justice Rehnquist's questions implied, that
perhaps he was just saying strip out the entanglement features
and let the rest of the statute stand.
The relief he asked for in his complaint -- I am
looking at page 10 »•* is an order declaring that the Act herein
above mentioned is unconstitutional, null and void
That sounds to me as if he is saying by reason of
excessive entanglement the whole statute must be declared
unconstitutional.
. MEL SIMLEK:

I think that is his basic position.

27

Q

Isn’t there a difference between the position he

has asserted in these briefs and the somewhat modified position
that he took in oral argument here today?
MR. SIMILER:
Q

It impressed me that way, your Honor*

Let's assume, we rejected your opponent’s position

that there was excessive entanglement and put aside the
question of aid that he says isn’t involved in this suit,
There would still be the question there, wouldn’t there?
MR. SINKLER:

Question of what, sir, I didn’t

understand.
Q

......

Qf lending Che. States credit*.
MR, SIMKLER:

The State’s credit is not -- is

lent specially,in effect.
Q

,

Ail the States —

Bo you think there is no benefit from lending the

States credit?
MR. SIMILER:

Oh, lending the States — the fact that

the State is the borrower and not the college amounts to about
— is worth at least 2% per million dollars per year,
Q

So this is a substantial benefit.
MR. SIMILER:

Q

Sure, it’s a substantial benefit.

So, as bond counsel, even if your opponent lost, you

would still have to wrestle with that issue in terms of whether
the bonds are valid or not?

MR, SINKLER:

Oh, the State Supreme Court has held

that this statute doesn’t get involved on State constitutional

Zo

grounds.

1 would assume that if there is no entanglement or

First Amendment question, we could go right along with it.
Q

1 donTt think that was Mr* Justice White’s question,

Mr* Sinkier*
It was, as X understand it — at least X would like
to ask the question — if there is State aid here, some kind of
aid, as you said, there is a definite benefit to the insti­
tution, then isn't there a question, or may X ask it, is there
a question here whether, independently of the entanglement
features,this statute violates, by reason of the aid features,
the First Amendment?
MR. SIKICLER:

By reason of the aid, which is getting

back to the action the Court took in Wilson v. Essex, that
sort of -- Oilman, X guess it was, the Ohio case, well, X
think there you have to go back to the first and second
premises which you examined these statutes under —
Q

Yes, but I would think, as bond counsel, you would

want the whole thing decided.
MR, SXNKLER:

Of course X do.

Of course X do.

I gathered that the thrust of his attack was sufficient to
bring the whole First Amendment into play,
Q

Do you think the issue was raised in the lower courts2
MR. SIMKLER:

It certainly was raised.

I think if

you will read the opinion —
Q

tfes it decided by the South Carolina court?

29
MR. SIMCLER:

Precisely, sir.

precisely.

Let me see if I can —
0

They decided that the extent of aid lent was not

violative of the First Amendment?
MR. SINKLER:

They said that the action taken was

not violative of the First Amendment.
Q

And the appellant, your opponent, didn’t bring that

part of the issue —
MR. SBJELER:

Yes.

He brought it all here, but I

think he laid special emphasis on the fact —» certainly the
object of the statute is a secular one because its purpose is
to help the individuals throughout the States, not to help
the individual, and even in Wilman v, Essey. where the Ohio
Statute was giving money to the parents of children who went
to parochial schools, the three-judge court which you all
approved upheld, recently, held that that object was perfectly
valid.
And then the question of whether its principal or
primary effect will advance or inhibit the schools down there,
I suppose there are more religious schools

— I think the

actual breakdown,if you are interested, is there are nineteen
four-year colleges, of which twelve have Baptist, Episcopal
or something,
Q

May nondenominational colleges issue bonds under this
MR. SIHKLER:

Mo.

30
Q

Hot a single bond has been issued under this?
MR, SIHKLER:

under this,
Q

Hot a single bond has been issued

We have been litigating for three years,

X understood Mr* Figg’s litigation position in this

Court **“ and he will correct me later, if I misunderstand it
*>*• was that the State gets a substantial benefit, the State
gets an aid by being relieved of having to enlarge its State
colleges and in exchange it gives this, quote, "aid or
assistance by lending its credit to these colleges.33
MR, SIWKLER:

That*s correct, sir.

They do get —

the State does get the benefit of not having to build
additional £our~year schools,
Q

But what he objects to is the entangling relation­

ship . MR. SINKLER:
of his argument, sir.

Well, I think that is the emphasis
I think, perhaps, he has suggested that

the whole thing is bad anyway under the First Amendment,
I think the First Amendment question *•- to answer,
I think it was, Mr, Justice White, 1 think if the Supreme
Court decision is in one of these things.
in the Jurisdictional Statement.

I guess it is

And the last time it went

back to the court they very carefully —

I

think that decision

begins on about page 15, yes, of the Jurisdictional Statement,
They specifically pass on these three questions.
I don't think,if you look at the substance and not

31
the form of this transaction» you will see that the State is
simply the conduit and the aid that they are giving is to —
because those bonds will foe State of South Carolina» they
will have tax exempt status permitted under the IRS, Section
103, and, as a consequence, save these institutions substantial
sums of money.
Q

Mr. Sinkier, suppose you had a default on a bond

issue like this?

What would happen?

Who would enforce the

rights of bond holders?
MR. SINKLER:
Q

The trustee would do it.

Would the State do anything?
MR. SINKLER:

The State would presumably be a party

and presumably would join in the prayer of the trustee.

I am

sure that the State would not want to see any bonds issued.
As a matter of fact, even industrial development
bonds, which are really industrial bonds, rather than the
State, our same body reviews the financial standings — the
figures of those companies — before they approve bonds.
Q

Would the truetee or the

State go to the college and

say, “Look, you must raise your fees and tuition — ”
MR. SINKLER:

The trustee would do it.

In other

words, the rights of the State, under the lease agreement,
which is the document which prescribes that rates and charges
shall be sufficient to pay when due principle, interest,
redemptiora premium, if ' any*

32
They are assigned to the trustee, just as in the
ease of the industrial development bonds.
transaction.

It is all one

It all happens at the same time.

You, first of all, make your conveyance.
your lease.

You make your trust indenture.

Next,

And the trust

indenture not only mortgages the property itself, but has an
assignment in it of the leasehold of the State.
So that the trustee, at that time, takes over
everything.

The State stands aside.

And the State has been

in the transaction for a few hours, at best, because all of
these things are, in theory, done simultaneously, as Your
Honor knows.
Q

What about that language Mr. Figg read about the

Authority has to find out all of this and must do it itself?
MR. SIMLER:

I don’t think the statute says that.

I think Mr. Figg was arguing that the statute meant that the
Authority had to do that.

X don’t think the Authority has to

do that.
Q

He read from it.
MR* SIMLER:

Maybe I misunderstood him.

Oh, paragraph (1) of the Act.
That simply says that the Authority may exercise
those powers.

It is not mandatory on the Authority to do that.

As a practical matter, the Authority would do that through the
lease, but, as I say, the lease is assigned to the trustee, so

33
the State steps out.
But, actually,, this entanglement — actually, what
would happen would be that whoever, the bond holder himself or
the trustee for the bond holder, was willing to act would go
to court and ask that the covenants be enforced, or that the
mortgage be foreclosed.
Because, as I pointed out —
Q

What about the Act that’s before us?
MR. SIWSCLER:

The Act does —

The Act doesn't say you shall do that.

The Act simply says, if it please, Your Honor, that those are
powers that may be availed of.
Let me see if I can — well, I think, you go back to
page 39.

Thirty-nine says the Authority may.
Then the resolution — you talk about the resolution,

which, of course, is also one of the working papers at the
time of the transaction.

Its tetta3 are set out on page 39,

as to what it can do and what it can't do.
But, actually, you could strike this paragraph II
out of the Act and not hurt anything, as I see it, because you
can do it all in the lease or in your resolution.
Q

It says if there is a default and foreclosure —
MR. SINKLER:

That's just a straight, regular

mortgage foreclosure.
Q

Yes.

And then the school can be operated as a

religious school thereafter, can it?

34
MR. SIMKLER;

Well, no.

The Act says that neither

the school, nor any voluntary transferee,may do this.
Mow, you say the college lets the mortgage get
foreclosed with the idea that —
Q

That’s an involuntary transfer, now.
MR. SIMKLER: — that it would get some third party

to buy it and then sell it back.
Q

That’s the point made in your opponent’s brief.
MR. SIMKLER:

That would be collusion that the

courts could upset.
I mean that is a collusive transaction.
You couldn't premise a decision here on the -«•
Q

Well, let 's say we are not collusive.

Let us say

we are a non«collusive buyer who wanted to operate this as
a religious organisation which, in the meantime, has had all
this. State support.
MR. SIMKLER:
Q

That's a pretty farfetched —

Isn't that the argument made in the brief of your

brother?
MR. SIMKLER:

Yes, that's the argument made in the

brief.
That’s a point, but we had to have the forcelosable
mortgage to be able to sell the bonds, from a practical stand­
point.

And that's the reason that was put in there with that

recognition.

35
I think that1s so remote and, actually, if the
college went ahead and mortgaged the property now people could
use it for anything, but I think that in this particular case,
and I suppose it is a bad way to pattern statutes on particular
cases but the college was really in financial trouble when
this thing started.

It is fortunately not in it now.

It had a very valuable tract of land that would be
security and one or two underwriters in Hew York looked at it
— and that was one of the things —
So this forcelosable mortgage with --free of the
covenant— is security to the guy who buys the bonds.
Thank you, Mr. Justice.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.

Do you have anything further, Mr. Figg?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT McCOSMICK FIGG, JR., ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. FIGG:

If you will indulge me for a couple of

moments, Your Honor.
I did not intend to cut down the attack that was
made in the original complaint on this litigation by the
position I took here today, but the Tilton case was decided
since this complaint was drawn and I am not sure it would have
been drawn this same way *»»
Q

I gather that, Mr. Figg, if one were to think that

independently of the entanglement features one thought that the

(/

36
aid, in and of itself, was a violation of the Establishment
Clause, you would advance that argument?
MR. FIGG:

I thought it was until we tried to apply

the Tilton case to this case, I thought the aid itself
and we contended in the first argument in the Supreme Court
of South Carolina ~~
Q

You are not going to give it up, based on Tilton,

are you?
MR. FIGG:
Q

Didn’t intend to give.it up.

In any event, the issue is here for us to decide.
MR. FIGG:

What we were trying to do here was to

accommodate ourselves to the entanglement theory because I
believe both the Walz case and the Tilton case have been
decided since this complaint was drawn and presented to the
Circuit judge,
Q
here

Can you tell me what makes this college involved

, questionable under the First Amendment?
You say it is a Baptist College.

What makes it

a Baptist college?
MR. FIGG:

Well, it is chartered to operate a

Baptist liberal arts college.

Its trustees are appointed by

the South Carolina Baptist Convention.
Q

But it lias an open admissions policy?
MR. FIGG:

Q

It operates —

It has an open admissions policy.

Are all of its faculty Baptist?

37
MR. FIGG:
Q

Ho, neither its students nor its faculty.

Is any student required to take any course in

religion if he doesn’t want to?
Ml.- FIGG:
any course.

I don’t think they are required to take

They merely offer a Baptist offering, but I knot?

this that when, I believe, that counsel in this case were
arguing at one time that it wasn't a Baptist activity, and
I think that the South Carolina Baptist Convention called them
on the carpet, didn't they, and told them it was.
(laughter)
Q

Has some court in this case decided that it was in

the sense that —
Ml. FIGG:

Yes, the Circuit judge said it was at

least in part a function of the South Carolina Baptist
Convention.
Q

They give them capital.

Does that make it a sectarian institution in the

sense that aid to it will support religion?
Ml. FIGG:

Well, the Baptists think that it is a

religious activity of theirs.
Q

X don't care — how about under the First Amendment?
MR. FIGG:

Well, I think that this institution is

an activity of the Baptists of South Carolina and I believe
that they think, regardless of this application for assistance,
that governmental interference with what they are doing here
would be a violation of the Federal constitution.

They think

3b
that this is a religious activity.
Q

That wouldn't bind the Court, or us, would it?
MR, FIGC:

Mo, it wouldn't bind the Court, but it

is some evidence of what they think they are doing
Q

What do you think, makes it a suspect under the

First .Amendment, the connection between this institution and
the Baptist Church?

What practical things mice it suspect in

your mind?
MR. FIGG:

Because it was created to include in

its curriculum some religious courses and offerings and
instruction and preparation to be a Baptist preacher.
Q

They do teach religion there — the Baptist faith?
MR. FIGG;

Q

What they think is the Baptist approach —*

And produce Baptist ministers?
MR. FIGG:

That's right.

They have courses that

lead up to being a Baptist minister.
Q

Mr. Figg, they don't give degrees in Divinity at

this college, do they?
MR. FIGG;
Q

I thought you just said they did.
MR. FIGG:

Q

I don't believe they do, Mr. Justice.

No, I say they give courses,

They give courses, but they get ministers out of

that?
MR, FIGG:

Well, I am not -- this is a fairly new

educational institution, isn't it, and it hasn't yet developed

39
to the point that X think the Baptist intended it to develop.
Q

Let me take another approach.

Some of these schools

have requirements that the Board or percentage of it be members
of the denomination.
Is that true here?
MR. F1GG:

Does the record disclose this?

The Board of Trustees here is named by

the South Carolina Baptist Convention.

Now, they don't have

to be Baptists, but they are appointed — the whole Board
and to operate it in trust for the South Carolina Baptist
Convention,
Q

Maybe, this answers, in part, Justice White1s

inquiry, then.
MR. FIGG:

And when they got the charter, they wrote

in there that to operate1 a Baptist liberal arts charter.
Wow, they are in —
Does the record show what degrees are offered at

Q

this college?
MR. FIGG:

X don't believe it does, Mr, Justice.

The only other observation I wanted to make was —
Q

Baptists could never support and pay the expenses

of a college that wouldn't be suspect under the First
Amendment?
MR. FIGG:
Q

Wo.

If they hadn’t done it?

It is just impossible for a church to pay the

expenses of a college without being suspect under the First

S3

40
Amendment ?
ME, FIGG;

Mo.

1 think they could contribute to

it.
Q

Well then, what is it that makes it — makes this

college a Baptist college?
MR. FIGG:

To me, it is because they think it is.

1 take that as evidence that they’ve accomplished
what they set out to do.
Q

Is that the most you have to say about it?
MR, FIGG;

Q

That's all I know, Your Honor.

I suppose you might add to that their power to

select the governing board*

I suppose that’s central to your

position,
MR. FIGG:
Q

Naming the Board of Trustees.

Even if they include Catholics and Presbyterians

and Methodists, and a lot of other people.
MR. FIGG;

That’s right.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Figg.

Thank you, gentlemen.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 2:12 o’clock, p.m., the oral
arguments in the above-entitled case were concluded.)
