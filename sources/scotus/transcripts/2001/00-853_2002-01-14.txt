ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD BLUMENTHAL

We'll hear argument

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
GENERAL BLUMENTHAL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
This case is about the meaning of the term,

11

prison conditions, and the reason it is here is because

12

the Second Circuit misinterpreted that term contrary to

13

the purposes of Congress and the meaning given that term

14

by this Court.

15

In fact, Congress adopted this Court's language

16

when it passed the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1996

17

and adopted the meaning of that term given to it by this

18

Court in a line of cases, Preiser v. Rodriguez, the

19

Bronson case, McCarthy v. Bronson, and Wilson v. Seiter,

20

that very clearly include single episode and excessive

21

force cases, which the Second Circuit Court of Appeals

22

excluded in its decision.

23

conditions, to exclude those kinds of single episode and

24

excessive forces instances of misconduct by prison

25

officials.

It interpreted the term, prison

QUESTION:

What's the universe of conditions and

2

nonconditions that you would suggest?

3

considerable discussion in the brief about the distinction

4

between 1983 suits and habeas corpus suits.

5

draw the line there, would you, or would you?

6

GENERAL BLUMENTHAL:

There was

You would not

Preiser v. Rodriguez draws

7

the line between habeas corpus petitions on the one hand

8

challenging the fact or duration of confinement and the on

9

the other hand conditions of prison life, or conditions of

10

his prison life, as it refers to the petitions that we

11

think are the universe that would be included in 1983

12

actions.

13

be regarded as conditions of confinement cases.

14

Virtually any conditions of prison life ought to

QUESTION:

Well, can you give me an example,

15

under your theory, of a case that is not covered by habeas

16

corpus, but that also are not a condition of prison life

17

which is a 1983 suit?

18

your theory?

19

When could a 1983 suit lie under

GENERAL BLUMENTHAL:

Our position would be that

20

all of those 183 lawsuits ought to be subject, are subject

21

to the exhaustion requirement.

22

whether it's --

23

QUESTION:

There are no exclusions,

You can't think of any suit brought

24

by a prisoner that is not controlled by the term,

25

conditions, unless it's a habeas corpus suit?

1

GENERAL BLUMENTHAL:

Well, if it were completely

2

unrelated to prison life -- an example might be, for

3

example, a lawsuit against a State tax commissioner, for

4

example, just to take one that seems relevant in light of

5

the earlier argument today, where the prisoner is claiming

6

that he's been denied a refund to which he's properly

7

entitled, and --

8
9
10

QUESTION:

You're saying that all Eighth

Amendment claims under 1983, which is what most of the
prison cases are.

11

GENERAL BLUMENTHAL:

12

QUESTION:

All --

They claim that they've been deprived

13

of a constitutional right because they have been sentenced

14

to prison and the conditions of that prison, whether it's

15

an isolated beating by a guard or anything else, are

16

unduly -- are cruel and unusual?

17

GENERAL BLUMENTHAL:

Yes, Justice Scalia.

All

18

Eighth Amendment constitutional claims, indeed all

19

constitutional claims under 1983, this Court has never

20

established a hierarchy among such claims regarding

21

excessive force claims as deserving greater priority, so

22

that they ought to be spared the exhaustion requirement.

23

In fact, it is specifically said in Wilson v.

24

Garcia that, for example, on statute of limitations

25

questions there ought to be uniformity, and certainty, so

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

as to avoid the kind of litigation that also was the

2

purpose of Congress in passing the PLRA, and that is

3

really one of the key points here.

4

QUESTION:

That's an easier line.

What you're

5

saying is that the minute you begin defining a universe of

6

conditions which is smaller than the 1983 suits --

7

generally we have a whole jurisprudence that has to be

8

tested and create satellite litigation, et cetera, and I

9

understand that.

I'm just wondering if your definition is

10

prevailing, Congress would have used those words,

11

conditions.

12

involving prisoners, period.

13

It would have just said all 1983 suits

GENERAL BLUMENTHAL:

Justice Kennedy, Congress

14

used that term because it was used by this Court to

15

describe a category of the universe as set forth in

16

Preiser and again in McCarthy v. Bronson, where the court

17

faced a similar issue under the Magistrates Act, the

18

nonconsensual referral of petitions to magistrates, and

19

said that all of these cases, 1983 cases are, indeed,

20

conditions of confinement cases, and Congress wanted to

21

use that language and that meaning given by this term so

22

as to avoid corollary or, as you put it quite well,

23

satellite litigation that, in fact -- in fact has been

24

spawned in the Second Circuit by the Nussle case, and we

25

see it, for example, in Royster v. United States, which is

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

before this Court on cert, where excessive force is no

2

longer even involved.

3

It's a particularized instance, as the court of

4

appeals referred to it, of denial of the documents, legal

5

documents that the prisoner claims he is entitled to

6

receive, and courts then and now would have to decide what

7

kinds of cases are excessive force, if they are mixed with

8

other cases that may not be excessive force, if they seem

9

to involve in some respect ongoing conditions --

10

QUESTION:

You can certainly find some Eighth

11

Amendment claims that have nothing to do with excessive

12

force, I think.

13

earlier this term, a case called Molesco, which came from

14

the Second Circuit.

15

Litigation Act, but what happened there was that the

16

prisoner had a heart condition, he ordinarily was allowed

17

to use the elevator to go up to the sixth floor cell, this

18

day the prison attendant said no, you can't use the

19

elevator, so he walked up the stairs and had a heart

20

attack.

21

A case comes to mind that we decided

It didn't come here under the Prison

Now, that case was brought under the Eighth

22

Amendment. I take it under your view that if it were a

23

prison litigation action he should have to exhaust

24

administrative remedies.

25

GENERAL BLUMENTHAL:

Exactly, Mr. Chief Justice.

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

He ought to be required to exhaust because in that case,

2

for example, the prison administrator could and might well

3

make adjustments to the facilities, might do retraining,

4

different decisions on hiring, in fact, disciplining --

5

QUESTION:

General Blumenthal, on the other side

6

of that is the argument that Nussle makes that he said

7

that the guards told me if I report what they did they

8

would kill me, so are there assurances -- you said the

9

value of -- no risk to the prisoners, this is going on, so

10

that they can cure it.

He says, if I told they said they

11

were going to kill me.

Are there assurances in the system

12

that there isn't going to be retaliation of someone who

13

makes an internal complaint?

14

GENERAL BLUMENTHAL:

Certainly in Connecticut's

15

system, Justice Ginsburg, there are such assurances, and

16

in the joint appendix at 11 and at other places there are

17

requirements for confidentiality, for example.

18

requirement for an informal contact or request.

19

There is a

In the Connecticut system, the commissioner

20

entertains, personally reads, is on the floor and, indeed,

21

there is the requirement that the lieutenant make two

22

rounds every day, that a captain make one round, that he

23

be or she be accessible in those circumstances, and that

24

protection be provided, and that is, as a matter of fact,

25

one of the advantages of exhausting, because it assures

1
2

timely, prompt attention.
QUESTION:

General Blumenthal, I don't really

3

understand this.

4

you tell somebody through an administrative internal

5

procedure we're going to kill you, but it's perfectly okay

6

to go to a court directly.

7

exhaust administrative remedies.

8

exhaust administrative remedies.

Was the threat that the guards made, if

We just really want you to

QUESTION:
that's okay.

But if you go right to the court,

Is that realistically what the threat was?

12

GENERAL BLUMENTHAL:

matter what, don't you?
(Laughter.)

16

QUESTION:

17

GENERAL BLUMENTHAL:

You can't --

GENERAL BLUMENTHAL:

I would think so.
And it was never verified,

of course.

GENERAL BLUMENTHAL:

was more general.

my experience.

1

GENERAL BLUMENTHAL:

Well, they're learning,

2

Justice Scalia, and part of the claim here was one of

3

retaliation, but it --

4
5

QUESTION:

Was he still in prison when he

brought this case?

6

GENERAL BLUMENTHAL:

He was in prison when he

7

brought this lawsuit.

He waited for 3 years.

He waited

8

until literally 3 to 5 days, depending on whether you look

9

at the complaint or whatever, until the statute of

10

limitations was about to expire, and then he went to

11

court.

12

It was not a timely, emergent, exigent plea for

13

help, and if there had been a real threat physically to

14

him, the prison administration would have afforded a far

15

more effective means of protection than going to Federal

16

court and seeking some remedy -- and by the way, he sought

17

money damages.

18

injunctive relief -- than going to Federal court and

19

seeking some remedy far in the future.

20

He didn't seek any protection or

The excessive force claim -- and I want to be

21

very frank about it -- is intertwined with the single

22

episode contention on which the court of appeals also

23

relied, and in our view the excessive force claim, the

24

threat of physical harm, is a more difficult one because

25

it's raised in this Court's cases, in Hudson v. McMillian,

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

and Farmer v. Brennan, which deal with the element of

2

proof, the elements of proof that have to be provided to

3

make out a claim, with the standard of intent that has to

4

be shown.

5

QUESTION:

You acknowledge they do draw this

6

distinction between prison conditions and excessive force

7

cases?

8
9

GENERAL BLUMENTHAL:

They do, Justice Kennedy,

but only for the purpose of the standard of proof or

10

intent, and this Court has made that distinction very

11

clear in Crawford-El v. Britton, which is cited in the

12

briefs at 523 U.S. 574, and particularly at 585 the Court

13

draws the distinction, because in Crawford-El it is saying

14

that a heightened standard of intent need not be shown,

15

should not be required in order to protect prison

16

officials from frivolous lawsuits or from discovery.

17

And the Court says we have a law that will do

18

that, we have the PLRA, and it says about the PLRA, most

19

significantly, and I'm quoting from 585, most

20

significantly the statute draws no distinction between

21

constitutional claims that require proof of an improper

22

motive and those that do not, so the Court there -- and it

23

goes on to say, if there is a compelling need to frame new

24

rules of law based on such a distinction, presumably

25

Congress either would have dealt with the problem in the

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

reform act, or will respond to it in future legislation.

2

What the Court is doing there is saying, and it

3

does so after a footnote that cites Farmer, and refers to

4

the Eighth Amendment, that is to say, footnote 7, we don't

5

mean that prison conditions should exclude the excessive

6

force claims simply because we have said in Farmer and

7

Hudson v. McMillian that under the questions presented

8

there they would do so, so the Court I think as answer --

9

this Court has answered that question, and --

10

QUESTION:

11

GENERAL BLUMENTHAL:

12

Is this the citation to Crawford-El?
Crawford-El is 523 United

States 574, and I have been quoting from 585.

13

QUESTION:

Thank you.

14

GENERAL BLUMENTHAL:

And 597.

The quote was

15

from 597, but I want to make clear, in fairness, that

16

quotation is not central to the holding of the case, which

17

I mentioned earlier.

18

draws so as to in effect provide reassurance that the

19

Prisoner Litigation Reform Act will do the job of

20

eliminating frivolous litigation as, indeed, it did in

21

1997a(c), where it provided for dismissal of actions that

22

are frivolous, malicious, or seek monetary damage from an

23

official who is immune, and it uses the term, prison

24

conditions.

25

It is a distinction that the Court

In fact, prison conditions is also a term used

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

in 1997e(f), where there's a reference to the pretrial

2

proceedings that can occur by means of video, or

3

telephone, or other telephone communications technology.

4

There is no reason that the term, prison conditions, in

5

those sections of the statute, ought to exclude excessive

6

force cases or single episode instances of misconduct and,

7

indeed, it would do violence, it would be directly

8

contradictory to the purposes of Congress, which were to

9

reduce the volume of litigation, particularly frivolous

10

litigation, to give prison administrators a chance to

11

correct errors or mistakes and to reduce the interference

12

of Federal courts in prison administration, and to provide

13

a better record if there is going to be resort to the

14

Federal courts.
With the Court's permission, if there are no

15
16

further questions I'd like to reserve the remainder of my

17

time.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF IRVING L. GORNSTEIN
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS
MR. GORNSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
For four reasons, actions that challenge

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

particular instances of unlawful conduct such as excessive

2

force are actions with respect to prison conditions that

3

must be exhausted under the PLRA.

4

First, in three cases, this Court has used the

5

terms, prison conditions, or conditions of confinement, to

6

refer to particular instances of unlawful conduct and, in

7

one of those cases, McCrary v. Bronson, it applied the

8

term to a single episode of excessive force.

9

reason to think that Congress intended any narrower

10

There's no

meaning here.
Second, the purposes of the exhaustion provision

11
12

are to give prison officials an opportunity to resolve

13

problems within the prison by themselves, and to reduce

14

the enormous volume of prison litigation in Federal

15

courts.

16

absolutely no reason to distinguish between actions that

17

challenge particular instances of unlawful conduct such as

18

excessive force and any other sort of prisoner complaint.

19

Prison authorities in fact have a particularly strong

20

interest in resolving complaints about staff misconduct on

21

their own, and grievance procedures are fully effective to

22

do that without any need for significant Federal court

23

litigation.

24
25

In terms of those two purposes, there's

Third, as this Court has recognized, it is
extremely difficult to administer a line between isolated

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

episodes or particular instances and more systematic

2

practices, or actions undertaken pursuant to a policy.

3

Any effort to do that would generate substantial

4

additional litigation on a threshold collateral issue when

5

Congress' goal was to reduce the amount of judicial

6

resources devoted to prisoner complaints.

7

And finally, creating an exception for

8

particular instances of unlawful conduct has the potential

9

to create an enormous loophole in the exhaustion

10

requirement.

11

the Second Circuit to retaliation claims, to confiscation

12

of property claims, and it has the potential and

13

capability to be applied to a wide variety of prisoner

14

complaints that are directed at the actions of individual

15

officers.

16

Already, that exception has been applied by

It is very unlikely that the Congress amended

17

this exhaustion provision for the express purpose of

18

making sure that a dramatically increased number of cases

19

would have to go through the exhaustion process, would

20

have simultaneously cut out that large category of claims

21

that could benefit from the exhaustion process.

22

QUESTION:

Could you tell me on your point 1,

23

you cited the case where excessive force applied to --

24

prison conditions applied to a single incident.

25

that case?

What was

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. GORNSTEIN:

2

QUESTION:

3

McCrary v. Bronson.

And was that pre or post enactment of

the litigation reform act?

4

MR. GORNSTEIN:

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. GORNSTEIN:

That's preenactment.

Preenactment.
And in that case was a

7

construction of the Magistrates Act that had nonconsensual

8

referral in cases involving conditions of confinement, and

9

the Court interpreted the phrase, Conditions of

10

confinement, to embrace single incidents, including

11

excessive force, and rejected an alternative construction

12

that is similar to the one adopted by the Second Circuit

13

here that prison conditions refers to systematic

14

practices, and it did so for the same reasons, really,

15

that you should reach the same conclusion here.

16

The Court said that the purpose of that act was

17

to reduce the workload of Federal courts, and that would

18

further that purpose, and it said that trying to draw that

19

distinction between individual actions and systematic

20

practices would provoke -- generate a whole new round of

21

litigation, when what we're trying to deal with here is

22

something that's trying to save time.

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. GORNSTEIN:

25

What about Hudson and Farmer?
Hudson and Farmer show that the

term, prison conditions, can be used in a narrower sense,

16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

and that context matters, but here the context was in

2

defining the substantive elements for proving a particular

3

kind of Eighth Amendment violation, and the substantive

4

standards for proving a claim really have nothing to do

5

with whether a claim should be exhausted.

6

The context we have here is an exhaustion

7

provision, and the purposes of exhaustion, as I have said,

8

are to give prison officials a chance to act first to

9

solve a problem and to reduce the volume of litigation

10

and, in light of those purposes, it simply makes no sense

11

to adopt a narrower meaning.

12

adopt a broader meaning that comes from Preiser v.

13

Rodriguez, and McCrary v. Bronson, and Wilson v. Seiter.
QUESTION:

14

Instead, the Court should

Of course, still in all, even in

15

Hudson, I guess, drawing a distinction between continuing

16

prison conditions and single incident prison conditions,

17

or single incidents that aren't prison conditions, still

18

involves you in the same problem of satellite litigation

19

that you say would be one of the horrible effects of

20

adopting the same interpretation in the present case.

21

mean, that didn't stop us from coming out that way in

22

Hudson.

Maybe it should have, but it didn't.
MR. GORNSTEIN:

23

I

Justice Scalia, two responses to

24

that.

One is that the line that was actually drawn in

25

Hudson as I read it is not between single instances and

17
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

systematic practices, it's between excessive force claims

2

and everything else, which is -- does still have its

3

difficulties in administration, but maybe not quite as

4

challenging as single instances versus systematic

5

practices.

6

The other difference is, we're talking about

7

applying something at the liability stage to make a

8

determination on whether there has been liability enough,

9

as opposed to, what do we do right at the outset of

10

litigation when somebody comes in with a complaint, it's a

11

threshold question, and generating additional litigation

12

about that on a threshold question on a collateral issue

13

it seems to me is something that you would want to

14

generate less litigation about, generally speaking.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN R. WILLIAMS

19

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

20
21
22

MR. WILLIAMS:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:
When Congress enacted the Prison Litigation

23

Reform Act, it did so on the heels of at least three

24

decisions by this Court which clearly defined the term,

25

prison conditions, to exclude excessive force cases and

18
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

those cases start, of course, with Wilson v. Seiter, which

2

expressly held, and I will quote, the very high state of

3

mind prescribed by Whitley does not apply to prison

4

conditions cases.

5
6

QUESTION:

What was at issue in Wilson v.

Seiter?

7

MR. WILLIAMS:

Well, of course, that was a

8

medical indifference case, deliberate indifference case

9

involving the distinction between a single incident and

10

multiple incidents, and to the extent that the Second

11

Circuit, post Nussle, has gone on to attempt to draw a

12

distinction of that kind, we do not defend it.

13

distinction which I think is applicable here in defining

14

the term, prison conditions, is excessive force cases

15

versus all other types of cases, other than -QUESTION:

16

The

So on the other side of the line so

17

far as you're concerned would be a number of single

18

incident types of thing that did not involve excessive

19

force?

20

MR. WILLIAMS:

Yes, indeed.

I think the

21

distinction is one that this Court has made it absolutely

22

clear the distinction is between -- has to do with the

23

mens rea that's required.

24

sadistic, intending to cause pain, that's not a prison

25

condition.

If the mens rea is a malicious,

If it is, however, deliberate indifference,

19
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

that is a prison condition.
QUESTION:

But why would Congress have made that

3

distinction and said that one -- the kind of cases you're

4

refer -- shouldn't exhaust administrative remedies whereas

5

the other one should.

6

certainly draw a definitional line, but why would Congress

7

have said case A exhaust, case B don't?

8
9

It doesn't -- I can see -- you can

MR. WILLIAMS:
different.

Well, excessive force cases are

They've always been different under this

10

Court's jurisprudence.

11

are already built in to avoid frivolous litigation in the

12

excessive force context.

13

There are many protections that

For example, the standard itself, cruel,

14

malicious, sadistic, is a very tough one to meet.

15

Leatherman, of course, did not remove or excuse getting

16

away with just notice pleading.

17

pleading, so that when you combine the requirement of fact

18

pleading with the high standard that has to be met there's

19

a very -- it's a very rare case that will pass a 12(b)(6)

20

motion if it's an excessive force case in the first place.

21

QUESTION:

Second,

It required fact

Isn't the answer to your argument,

22

though, the answer that Mr. Gornstein gave a moment ago

23

when he referred to the significance of context?

24

issue before the Court involves a distinction among

25

different kinds of prison cases, then we can certainly

If the

20
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

understand the distinction when we say conditions are

2

different from particular incidents, and if you refer only

3

conditions, you're meaning to exclude particular

4

incidents.

5

But if we're trying to draw a distinction

6

between prison cases and all kinds of -- all other kinds

7

of 1983 cases, which was the case when Congress passed

8

this statute, then I suppose it does make good sense to

9

use prison conditions in a much broader sense to cover

10

everything that might come out of prison litigation to

11

distinguish it from other kinds of 1983 cases, and isn't

12

that the answer to your argument based on our use of the

13

term in certain cases?

14

MR. WILLIAMS:

I think that's more a policy

15

issue than a statutory construction issue, and I think

16

that this is just a simple case of statutory construction.

17

QUESTION:

But the -- I mean, Mr. Gornstein's

18

argument is kind of a compared-to-what argument.

He's

19

saying, when you use the phrase, conditions, what are you

20

comparing the conditions against?

21

against other kinds of things that happen in a prison, or

22

are you comparing them against other kinds of cases that

23

might be brought under 1983, and the answer is possibly

24

going to be quite different, depending on which context

25

you're in.

Are you comparing them

21
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. WILLIAMS:

Well, I think the context in

2

which this Court has used it, and therefore in which

3

Congress is presumed to have used it, is the latter.

4
5

QUESTION:

The cases that, including the one you

cite, the Government cites for the opposite proposition.

6

MR. WILLIAMS:

7

QUESTION:

I think --

The cases say, and they have loads of

8

language there which seem to say it, that Wilson v. Seiter

9

and three other cases did focus on the issue of single

10

incident versus affecting several people.

They all

11

decided that single incident is within the meaning of

12

prison conditions or the like.
Senator Biden on the floor says, if you pass

13
14

this law, you are going to sweep within it excessive force

15

cases, and nobody denies it, all of which from the most --

16

and the language, the language admits of Justice Souter's

17

suggestion, and he provides a purpose.
So taking all those things together, why isn't

18
19

the law in this case precisely along the lines he

20

suggested?
MR. WILLIAMS:

21

There's no doubt that the cases

22

involved do not see a principal distinction between single

23

incident and multiple incident cases.

24

where the Second Circuit in the post Nussle cases has gone

25

wrong.

I don't defend that.

That, I think, is

I think that the distinction

22
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

is the one that this Court has always drawn, which is

2

between the excessive force mens rea, which is cruel,

3

malicious, sadistic, intending to cause pain and nothing

4

else, on the one hand --

5

QUESTION:

That's only excessive force?

6

QUESTION:

That's only excessive force?

7

QUESTION:

I see somebody in dire need of

8

medical attention and I sit there smiling cruelly --

9

please, get me a doctor.

10

MR. WILLIAMS:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. WILLIAMS:

That is exactly --

You call that excessive force?
That's -- no.

13

indifference.

14

exactly what we're talking about.

This Court has often said that.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. WILLIAMS:

17

QUESTION:

18

There -- it's -- indeed --

It has nothing to do with the things

you were saying, then, cruelty, and savagery, whatever.
MR. WILLIAMS:

20

QUESTION:

22

That's

Well --

19

21

That's deliberate

Well, the term is --

You can be just as cruel and savage

without applying excessive force, if you do it right.
MR. WILLIAMS:

The -- we can have words mean

23

whatever we want them to mean, but this Court has made it

24

clear what it means when it refers to excessive force, and

25

that is the mens rea that we were just talking about

23
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

which, after all, comes from Judge Friendly's seminal

2

opinion in Johnson v. Glick.

3

That, however, is not what we mean when we talk

4

about prison conditions, and this Court has made that

5

clear, and made it clear at the time Congress enacted the

6

PLRA, and I think that the important distinction between

7

the PLRA and the Magistrates Act is that when the

8

Magistrates Act was passed, all they had -- and that's

9

what this Court held in McCarthy v. Bronson, all they had

10

to guide them on the meaning of the term was Preiser, and

11

so following Preiser, of course, that's what it meant, and

12

that's why they used it that way in the Magistrates Act.

13

But after this Court decided McCarthy and

14

Brennan, this Court then went on to address the issue,

15

focus on the language, and explain this very distinction

16

that I'm arguing for here, and it was after this Court had

17

done so in three cases, one after the other, that Congress

18

then passed the PLRA.

19

QUESTION:

That's what I don't understand.

Now,

20

I didn't realize this.

You're conceding, I take it, that

21

an individual incident is a prison condition, as long as

22

it isn't an excessive force incident, and at that point,

23

although maybe there are three cases that say this -- I'll

24

read them -- why would anybody want to say that a single

25

incident refusing to feed a prisoner, a single incident

24
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

refusing to give him medical assistance, a single incident

2

refusing to let him take exercise in fact is a prison

3

condition, but a single incident of hitting him is not?

4

MR. WILLIAMS:

I can't speak for Congress'

5

intention, but I can speak for the meaning of the words as

6

they've been defined by the Court, and there is an obvious

7

distinction under this Court's cases.

8

talking about when we talk about statutory construction,

9

and that's why I say that this is not a grand policy case.

10
11
12
13

That's what we're

This is a traditional -QUESTION:

Well, but we're also talking about

reaching a sensible result.
MR. WILLIAMS:

Well, the sensible result is the

14

result that this Court has often reached in the past,

15

which is to say to Congress, if this is what you want to

16

do, do it in the way that you're supposed to do it.

17
18
19

QUESTION:

But it really isn't quite that clear

what Congress wanted to do as between these two views.
MR. WILLIAMS:

Well, of course, if Congress is

20

ambiguous, then we go back to the default position, and

21

the default position is, we go back to dictionary meaning,

22

and this Court held in McCarthy v. Bronson that if you

23

just look to the dictionary definition of the term, prison

24

conditions, you're not talking about excessive force

25

cases, and in McCarthy this Court said, however, we don't

25
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

use the dictionary definition because when the Magistrates

2

Act was passed Congress is presumed to have been looking

3

to Preiser, but once Congress gets mushy, as they really

4

are in the PLRA, because some sections use the term prison

5

conditions, some sections don't, and that's even true in

6

the title 42 amendment, so --

7

QUESTION:

Mr. Williams, there's a case that has

8

come up in various forms where violence, random violence

9

is what characterizes the prison system.

There was the

10

litigation in Alabama, where the State Attorney General

11

said, this, the atmosphere in this prison is jungle-like,

12

and this Court said it in Dosset v. Rawlinson.

13

you put those cases?

14

it's pervasive in the prison, not just one beating by a

15

guard.

16

Litigation Reform Act, even though you're talking about

17

the kind of conduct that pervades the entire institution?

18

Where do

Those are excessive force cases, but

Would those cases come outside the prison

MR. WILLIAMS:

I'm not sure that this Court has

19

ever told us exactly what the mens rea is that must be met

20

in such a case, and I think that will be the answer to the

21

question when that case arises.

22

in any given pervasive violence situation, then the

23

necessary mens rea remains the Johnson v. Glick one, then

24

that's an excessive force case and it's not a prison

25

conditions case.

If this Court says that

26
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

On the other hand, if this Court says that the

2

necessary mens rea is simply deliberate indifference, then

3

it is a prison conditions case.

4
5

QUESTION:

Well, it's hard to say it's

deliberate indifference when you're beating up on someone.

6

MR. WILLIAMS:

If you're suing the individual

7

guard, of course, you're dealing with an instance of

8

brutality.

9

question of where the warden issues a decree.

10

What I was thinking of is the more interesting

QUESTION:

The warden knows that this is going

11

on.

It's not deliberate indifference, because it's a

12

jungle-like atmosphere.

13

MR. WILLIAMS:

If the warden is aware of it and

14

is tolerating it, then it becomes policy, and then this

15

Court is going to have to say, well, what's the standard

16

of liability for the warden?

17

indifference or is it the Johnson v. Glick?

18

I don't believe this Court has told us.

19

QUESTION:

Is it deliberate
I don't know.

I would think that just the usage,

20

ordinary English, what the words mean, when a condition

21

pervades a prison, then it's a prison condition.

22

MR. WILLIAMS:

Well, I think that that gets off

23

into the single incident versus multiple incident issue,

24

and I prefer to think of it in terms of the mens rea, and

25

I can conceive that an argument might well be made, and in

27
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

fact I would be happy to make it, that where it is so

2

pervasive that the warden is charged with actual knowledge

3

of -- there's the municipal liability cases under 1983 --

4

that he's charged with knowledge of it, then I would say

5

that the Johnson v. Glick standard applies, and it's not a

6

prison condition, but you could make the other argument

7

just as well.

8
9
10
11

In any event, it's an easy line to draw so that
we will know, the district courts will know in any given
case where it falls on the line of -QUESTION:

Why in the world would Congress --

12

you can give us no inkling of why Congress would sit down

13

and say, whether there has to be exhaustion of

14

administrative remedies ought to depend upon what state of

15

mind the actor is going to be held to?

16

conceivable connection between those two issues, and

17

that's what you're saying they did, that they left it up

18

to the future law of this Court as to what mens rea will

19

be required, and if on the one hand the mens rea is going

20

to be, you know, just deliberate indifference, then you

21

have to exhaust, and if it's intentional cruelty you don't

22

have to exhaust.

23

MR. WILLIAMS:

Why is there any

I would think that the reason for

24

that, if Congress had a reason, is that Congress knew that

25

because of the very high bar this Court has a record in

28
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

excessive force cases, combined with the fact pleading

2

requirement, that the concerns Congress had about

3

frivolous litigation and undue meddling of the district

4

courts in their business are already met by existing law,

5

and therefore the PLRA need not be concerned with it and

6

indeed, I think just about everybody agrees that the

7

concerns of Congress in enacting the PLRA was precisely

8

those two things, neither of which readily fits the

9

excessive force model.

10

QUESTION:

But if you have a guard who is

11

sadistically beating people, certainly that seems to be

12

the sort of thing that might easily be corrected, at least

13

for the future, by exhaustion.

14
15
16

MR. WILLIAMS:

But that, again, is a policy

question, Chief Justice.
QUESTION:

Well, it is, but when we're trying to

17

figure out what Congress really intended here, I think one

18

shies away from a distinction which is perfectly

19

technically sound but doesn't seem to have anything to do

20

with what people thinking about the desirability of

21

exhaustion would have thought about.

22

MR. WILLIAMS:

Well, when you look at the entire

23

PLRA, and I was a little dismayed in preparing for oral

24

argument to realize that the entire PLRA isn't in the

25

joint appendix to our briefs, but when you look at it in

29
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

its entirety, the presence or absence of that phrase,

2

prison conditions, is quite interesting.

3

For instance, in title 42, prison conditions do

4

not apply to the attorney fee cap.

5

to prisoner suits, and similarly the distinction that

6

there can be no monetary award for emotional distress

7

unless it's accompanied by physical injury, those are

8

prisoner suits, not prison conditions cases.

9

Rather, that relates

When you look further, section 807, the lien

10

provisions under the act, again, there's no prison

11

conditions limitation, so clearly Congress had in mind

12

that there are some kinds of suits by prisoners where it

13

wants to impose more stringent limitations and others

14

where it wants to impose some limitations but not the

15

whole panoply of limitations.

16

QUESTION:

But here the prisoner suits, it

17

happens to be the caption for the provision.

18

the text prison conditions but the caption is prison

19

suits, isn't it?

20

MR. WILLIAMS:

They use in

Yes, it is, and then in the

21

context of the section they go on and draw the

22

distinction.

23

it's just prisoner suits about prison conditions, so I

24

think we really get no place in particular from the fact

25

of the caption.

Sometimes it's all prisoner suits, sometimes

1

QUESTION:

What would we do with a case where

2

the prisoner said, these guards are beating up on me, and

3

the reason they are is that this prison doesn't give

4

guards any training, doesn't supervise them, so my 1983

5

suit is against the guards that beat me up, but they're

6

also against the officials in the prison who are

7

responsible for training and for monitoring?

8

to go to --

9

MR. WILLIAMS:

Those have

They go two different directions

10

and, of course, as we know, that is common place in

11

prisoner's suits, that they have multiple counts, multiple

12

claims, and some of them are dismissed early on, some of

13

them go a little bit farther, and so forth.

14

nature of prison litigation in this particular case, the

15

suit against the guard for beating him up would not

16

require exhaustion and would go forward.

17

conditions claims obviously would have to be exhausted,

18

had they not already been exhausted.

19

QUESTION:

That is the

Prison

Suppose I believe that policy was

20

relevant, would I then be right to think that the isolated

21

beating case is perhaps the strongest case where you

22

should require exhaustion, for the reason that the prison

23

doesn't want such a person on its payroll, and if the

24

prisoner is right, they'll find out about it fast and get

25

rid of him

MR. WILLIAMS:

No, actually, the difficulties of

removing a civil servant who has --

3

QUESTION:

Oh, but I'll take action.

4

MR. WILLIAMS:

When you combine all of his

5

Laudermill rights with all of his rights under the

6

collective bargaining agreement, moving that guard or

7

taking meaningful disciplinary action against him is not

8

going to be necessarily that fast.

9

Of course, what you can do quickly is move the

10

prisoner to another unit, but then you deal with what we

11

know to be the reality of the prison guard grapevine, so

12

that there's not an easy solution.
QUESTION:

13

You say that a prison guard who

14

maliciously beats up on people is just there to stay, so

15

to speak?

16

MR. WILLIAMS:

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. WILLIAMS:

Well, one would hope not.

One would.
But the fact of the matter is

19

that, like all public employees, they enjoy a number of

20

due process protections and, like most public employees,

21

they also enjoy union protection.
QUESTION:

22
23

Many of them are not public employees

any more.

MR. WILLIAMS:

QUESTION:

I'm sorry.

Many of them are not public employees

any more.

That's one reason some States have moved to

2

having private companies manage prisons.

3

MR. WILLIAMS:

4

QUESTION:

5

I agree.

I agree.

That is true.

In those cases there wouldn't be a

problem in getting rid of a guard.

6

MR. WILLIAMS:

Well, there's probably still a

7

pretty effective union contract.

8

pretty powerful force and, indeed, in this case that was

9

present.

The guards' union is a

There were the references to the fact that the

10

guards' union was involved in a big dispute with the

11

Governor of Connecticut, who happened to be a friend of

12

Mr. Nussle, so that that was present.

13

The attempt by the State to take the title 18

14

definition and move it over to title 42 I think is equally

15

unsuccessful.

16

the code is one reason why Congress certainly wouldn't

17

have attempted to adopt it.

18

code, title 18, that deals with different issues from

19

those which Congress was dealing with in its title 42

20

amendments.

The fact that it's in a different part of

Indeed, it's in a part of the

21

Most importantly, of course, it is explicitly

22

limited by its terms to section 802, that is, title 18,

23

and is not applicable elsewhere and, as this Court held in

24

the Vermont Agency of National Resources case, that at

25

least suggests that it is inapplicable to title 42.

33
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Also of great interest, and I think not

2

addressed in the briefs, is that section 803 has its own

3

definition section, just as section 802 does, but in the

4

section 803 definition the term, prison conditions, or

5

conditions of confinement, is not defined, but

6

interestingly, in section 802 and in section 803 there is

7

a definition of the word, prisoner.

8

precisely the same, but the words appear to have the same

9

meaning.

10

The words aren't

Now, why would Congress find it necessary to

11

define prisoner in section 803 when they'd already done so

12

in 802, unless it was because they took seriously the

13

limitation in 802, that the definitions there were limited

14

to section 802?

15

So I think that the attempt by the petitioners

16

to borrow the section 802 language and incorporate that

17

into section 803 simply won't work, and what we are left

18

to fall back on is the statutory construction arguments

19

which I have previously made.

23

I hate to say it, but I think I'm out of time.

17

criminally investigated, not guards involving this

18

incident, but some who have committed the kinds of acts

that Mr. Nussle might complain of.

20

effective administrative remedies that can be applied to

21

protect prisoners, and it is in the interests, may I

22

respectfully suggest, of the State to do so to eliminate

23

absolutely no evidence in the legislative history or

elsewhere it intended to carve out or make an exception

13

for single incident excessive force cases and, indeed, the

evidence is all to the contrary.

McCarthy v. Bronson was a single incident,

single episode of excessive force, but this Court said

that it was included in the term, conditions of
