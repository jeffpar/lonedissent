ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES W. DABNEY

11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. DABNEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case concerns how far the Federal Circuit

12

can properly go in taking jurisdiction to the exclusion of

13

the regional circuits.

14

In its recent construction of its appellate

15

jurisdiction, the Federal Circuit has effectively taken

16

the position that the defendant's answer containing a

17

patent counterclaim acts like a super removal petition.

18

The Federal Circuit says that if the defendant in a non-

19

patent suit files an answer that includes a patent

20

counterclaim, that pleading automatically removes the

21

plaintiff's non-patent suits from regional circuit

22

jurisdiction and transfers it to Federal Circuit

23

jurisdiction.

24
25

According to the respondent, that same pleading
automatically has the effect of changing the substantive

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

law governing non-patent claims in the plaintiff's non-

2

patent suit from regional circuit to Federal Circuit law,

3

and the decision below demonstrates that these principles

4

apply even when a judgment is entered which doesn't

5

address patent law at all.

6

The petitioner respectfully submits that the

7

decision below is antithetical to what the Congress had in

8

mind when it established the Federal Circuit.

9
10

QUESTION:

Well, Congress did want patent law to

be uniform, didn't it?

11

MR. DABNEY:

12

QUESTION:

Congress --

I mean, that's why it placed the

13

jurisdiction in the Court of Appeals for the Federal

14

Circuit.

15

MR. DABNEY:

One -- Mr. -- Your Honor, one of

16

the Congress' objectives in establishing the Federal

17

Circuit certainly was --

18

QUESTION:

And to the extent that you then allow

19

the other courts of appeals to deal with patent claims,

20

you're defeating that uniformity goal.

21

MR. DABNEY:

Your Honor, the Congress in

22

enacting 1295, according to this Court in Christianson,

23

establishes not that every case in which a Federal patent

24

claim is raised automatically goes to the Federal Circuit.

25

This Court in Christianson held -- this Court in

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Christianson addressed the question, how do we know if a

2

case belongs in the Federal Circuit?

3

specific question raised in Christianson.

4

That was the

Citing the legislative history of 1295, this

5

Court answered that question.

6

exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Circuit, this Court

7

held, in the same sense that cases are said to arise under

8

Federal -- under Federal law for purposes of Federal

9

question jurisdiction.

10

QUESTION:

Cases fall within the

Mr. Dabney, has the Federal Circuit

11

held that whenever there's a patent claim in a -- in a --

12

a patent issue in a counterclaim, it has jurisdiction?

13

must it be a compulsory counterclaim?

14

MR. DABNEY:

Or

The Federal Circuit has held in the

15

DSC Communications case that permissive or compulsory, it

16

doesn't matter.

17

QUESTION:

It doesn't matter.

18

QUESTION:

But in this case --

19

QUESTION:

In this case, it was compulsory.

20
21

Right?
MR. DABNEY:

Your Honor, it is far from clear

22

that the counterclaim in this case was in fact compulsory.

23

The -- and the -- and the Court can see that most clearly

24

by looking at the answer that was actually filed in this

25

case, which appears on pages 94 to 98 of the lodging.

The

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

one thing that's conspicuously absent from the answer

2

filed in this case was any counterclaim for trade dress

3

infringement.

4

Well, if this was --

QUESTION:

But did -- did the court of appeals

5

say in this case that the -- the counterclaim was

6

compulsory?

7
8

MR. DABNEY:
that.

The court of appeals did not say

There's absolutely nothing in the decision --

9

QUESTION:

We're not talking about the trade

10

dress claim.

It was the patent infringement counterclaim

11

that was in question.

12

MR. DABNEY:

The respondent has taken the

13

position that the patent counterclaim that it filed in

14

this particular case was compulsory within the meaning of

15

rule 13.

16

No court has passed on that question that -QUESTION:

Did it not arise out of the same

17

transaction and occurrence which under the rules is

18

interpreted broadly?

19

MR. DABNEY:

The subject matter of that

20

counterclaim was, at the time it was filed, the subject of

21

another pending proceeding.

22

this respondent was under any legal duty whatsoever to

23

assert that patent counterclaim at any believable risk to

24

itself.

25

QUESTION:

And it is far from clear that

Suppose that respondent who started

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

his own show in the -- in the CIT -- when the defendant in

2

that case turns up as plaintiff in Kansas District Court

3

-- was it?

4

The -- the district court here?
MR. DABNEY:

At the time that the present action

5

was commenced, the plaintiff in this action was one of

6

three named people whom the respondent was trying to get

7

an investigation started against.

10

QUESTION:
forum was.

No.

I just wanted to know where the

The forum that the plaintiff is suing in is in

the Tenth Circuit.

11

MR. DABNEY:

Correct.

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. DABNEY:

14

QUESTION:

15

Suppose the plaintiff in the suit in New York

And it's in Kansas.
That's correct.

Okay.

16

then brings that same claim in the district court in

17

Kansas and says, court, please consolidate these two, and

18

then you don't have a counterclaim.

19

consolidated for adjudication.

20

case.

21

MR. DABNEY:

22

QUESTION:

You have two claims

Suppose that were the

Yes.

Then, I take it, the judgment is

23

rendered.

There's a patent claim, not a counterclaim, but

24

a claim, and then the jurisdiction is in the Federal

25

Circuit.

Is that right?

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. DABNEY:

That is a hypothetical situation,

2

different from this case.

3

district court has an arsenal of remedies to decide

4

whether that should or should not be the outcome in that

5

case.

6

QUESTION:

I would suggest that the

I'm asking you a question that puts

7

together two claims, not counterclaims, two claims.

8

district court has made the judgment that these arise out

9

of the same transaction and occurrence and therefore

10

consolidates them because it makes sense in terms of

11

judicial economy.

12

consolidated cases.

13

appeal go?

14

Okay.

They are processed as

There's a judgment.

MR. DABNEY:

The

Where does the

I -- I would say in practice that

15

would depend in large measure on the sequence in which the

16

matters are tried, whether they are tried at the same

17

time, whether they are tried separately.

18

QUESTION:

Yes, they are tried at the same time.

19

MR. DABNEY:

Tried at the same time?

I believe

20

that under the question that this Court has not accepted

21

expressly under question 2, it would be open to both sides

22

in that situation to request that the district court enter

23

judgments which would preserve regional circuit

24

jurisdiction over the plaintiff's non-patent suit in the

25

first case.

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

They're both plaintiffs.

2

MR. DABNEY:

I understand.

And no one in this

3

case -- there's no question in this case as to what the

4

appropriate disposition would be of any claim for patent

5

infringement or any judgment adjudicating any such claim.

6

If the question had come up --

7

QUESTION:

Are you suggesting in -- in response

8

to my question that they would -- these two cases that

9

have been consolidated would then be split apart for

10

purposes of appeal and one claim would go to a regional

11

circuit and the other to the Federal Circuit?

12

MR. DABNEY:

It would be open to the parties to

13

that litigation in -- where they're both plaintiffs and

14

they both have filed claims, to request the entry of

15

judgments if they felt it was in their interest to do so,

16

based on the outcome of the trial.

17

QUESTION:

Well, you're assuming they could have

18

separate judgments under 54(b).

19

is here?

Is that what your point

20

MR. DABNEY:

Yes, Your Honor.

21

QUESTION:

22

But if there were a single judgment which did

Yes.

23

include the patent claim, then I think you'd say the

24

appeal would go to the Federal Circuit.

25

MR. DABNEY:

Not -- not necessarily.

2

QUESTION:

Come on.

Give us a little bit.

Surely, surely in that case.

3

QUESTION:

Well, why not?

I mean, what are you

4

giving up in your case by agreeing to that?

5

understand that.

6

MR. DABNEY:

I don't

I think it's important to

7

understand that when a -- when a person comes to court and

8

asked for a court to vary the rights and obligations of

9

parties, seeks judicial relief, what that person comes to

10

court with is a bundle of rights.

11

is what he's asking the court to vindicate.

12

has never said that that bundle of rights, the plaintiff's

13

right to choose who's going to decide that claim, and what

14

law is going to govern that claim, can be changed at all

15

automatically by something the defendant pleads or by how

16

the --

17

QUESTION:

18

kind of a basic question here?

That's his suit.

That

This Court

May I -- may I interrupt and ask a

19

MR. DABNEY:

20

QUESTION:

Certainly.

It seems to me that you could prevail

21

on either of two theories, that -- that the counterclaim

22

should be ignored for purposes of selecting the appellate

23

court to go to, or you could say that in this particular

24

case, you got a 54(b) judgment that had -- was totally

25

unrelated to patent claims and therefore, in this case,

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

regardless of whether we agree with Aerojet or the rest,

2

you should prevail.

3

But you seem to be arguing that even if the

4

counterclaim had been decided and adjudicated on a patent

5

issue, that you -- it would be the same case.

6

MR. DABNEY:

7

QUESTION:

That is correct, Your Honor.

You're not relying on the fact that

8

-- that there was a severance of the non-patent claims

9

under -- with a 54(b) finding, that it was a separate

10
11
12
13
14
15

claim.
MR. DABNEY:

That would provide a narrower basis

for reversal.
QUESTION:

But you're not asking us to rule on

that basis.
MR. DABNEY:

Well, we did in the petition, but

16

the Court declined to accept question 2 in the petition.

17

What Your Honor asked me was specifically question 2 in

18

the petition for certiorari.

19

QUESTION:

I see.

20

MR. DABNEY:

And the Court did not accept that

21

question before the Court.

22

question of whether or not the plaintiff's well-pleaded

23

complaint continues to govern the basis of arising under

24

jurisdiction in the Federal court.

25

Hence, we're up on the broader

In Christianson, to decide this case, the Court

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

need look hardly beyond 486 U.S., page 814.

Right then

2

and there the Court was faced with the question, how do we

3

know if a case properly belongs in the Federal Circuit?

4

And the Court held, we know that because Congress has told

5

us the answer.

6

the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Circuit in the

7

same way that they are said to arise under Federal law for

8

purposes of general Federal question jurisdiction under

9

1331.

What Congress said is, cases fall within

The cases are legion which say that what a

10

defendant pleads in its answer, whether it's an

11

affirmative defense or a counterclaim, is irrelevant to

12

whether a case falls within the original arising under

13

jurisdiction of the Federal court.

14

QUESTION:

In the -- in the context where

15

there's a great concern about Federal-State relations,

16

cases lodged in the State court being lifted out of that

17

State court and put into a Federal court, this context is

18

totally different.

19

it's a question of which appellate forum it goes to.

20

it seems to me that you can't just say that what arising

21

under means in the original jurisdiction context it

22

necessarily means when we're talking about an exclusive

23

appellate forum for a case that's colored Federal totally.

24

There's no State element in it.

25

MR. DABNEY:

It is an entirely Federal context, and
And

Your Honor, I would say two things

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

in response to that.

2

In the first place, that was exactly the

3

argument which the respondent in Christianson made.

4

footnote 2 of Christianson, the Court expressly recited

5

maybe our arising under jurisprudence is irrelevant in

6

this case since, after all, we're only deciding whether

7

the Seventh Circuit or the Federal Circuit should decide

8

this antitrust case in which the district court

9

invalidated a number of patents.

10

In

And citing the legislative history that the

11

Congress chose, for better or for worse, to make the

12

referent of Federal Circuit jurisdiction the same as the

13

referent of district court jurisdiction under 1331 and

14

1338, under the page and in the passage that I just read,

15

this Court I believe specifically considered and decided

16

that notwithstanding that the outcome in this type of case

17

is simply which of two Federal courts of appeals will hear

18

a case.

19

has decided that the referent of Federal Circuit

20

jurisdiction is the same.

A couple of years later, the Federal Circuit

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

looked at the issue again in Aerojet and it wrote an

2

opinion saying these are different.

3

dealing with a defense, an issue, a question, and in

4

another case, we've got a claim.

5

which court of appeals it goes to, maybe the court is --

in Aerojet is saying we have to qualify Christianson's

7

reasoning if not -- not its result.

8
9

MR. DABNEY:

In one case we were

And for purposes of

Justice Ginsburg, in Aerojet, the

Federal Circuit stated, among other things, that the

10

traditional prerogative of the plaintiff to choose his law

11

and to choose his court applies only to the trial court

12

level.

13

case had fully exhausted his right to choose his court and

14

to choose his law because he had access to a district

15

court forum.

The Aerojet case said that the plaintiff in that

This Court -- this case demonstrates how that

17

rationale of Aerojet is mischievous and dangerous and

18

incorrect.

19

change in the Federal Circuit's approach to what law it

20

chooses to apply in cases such as this, and it is the

21

Federal Circuit's choice of law approach, adopted in the

22

late 1990's, which has given birth to this entire action.

23
24
25

Since Aerojet in 1989, there has been a sea

QUESTION:

When you say choice of law, you're

not talking strictly about patent law, I take it.
MR. DABNEY:

Absolutely not.

This -- it's

4

MR. DABNEY:

5

QUESTION:

Precisely.

It's not like am I going to choose

6

the law of France or the law of Oklahoma versus the law of

7

New York.

8
9

MR. DABNEY:

That's absolutely the case.

And

the Federal Circuit, being a co-equal court of appeals, is

10

fully entitled, I suppose, to fashion its own liability

11

rules and apply them even to claims over which it has only

12

nonexclusive or pendent jurisdiction.

13

it has given rise to great incentives, which the

14

respondent has attempted to avail itself of in this case,

15

to get a case into the Federal Circuit and take advantage

16

of the different law of the Federal Circuit on a non-

17

patent claim.

18

But by doing that,

So, I would suggest to Your Honor that this

19

Court has never wavered from the idea that a person who

20

comes to court seeking relief -- there's a lot of

21

uncertainty in litigation.

22

clients all the time whether they should or should not

23

bring suit, where they should bring suit, how they should

24

bring suit.

25

else is uncertain in litigation, the one thing you know

I'm called upon to advise

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

is, number one, if you bring a suit, you have -- you are

2

absolute master to decide what law you're going to rely on

in your complaint.

4

law of California in my complaint, that's my choice.

5

the plaintiff specifies the law of the Tenth Circuit or a

6

judgment of the Tenth Circuit, that is the plaintiff's

7

choice.

QUESTION:

That's your claim.

If I specify the
If

That's a little odd, don't you think?

We are talking about one law, a Federal law.

It is not

10

quite the same as talking about the law of California, the

11

law of Nevada.

12

the Federal Circuit so that you would reduce the number of

13

disparities in -- in Federal law?

MR. DABNEY:

Well, early in its history the

15

Federal Circuit seemed to be more mindful of that type of

16

conflict than it is today.

17

It's very important that Your Honor understand.

18

In the Midwest case, which fomented this whole thing, the

19

1999 Midwest case, that was a case that involved not just

20

Federal law claims, that was a case that involved claims

21

under Iowa State law.

22

case was considering whether or not a plaintiff could

23

properly claim trade dress protection for the shape a boat

24

trailer winch post.

25

Alderson Reporting Company

1

just under the Lanham Act, but under Iowa State law.

2

QUESTION:

3

Federal Circuit has asserted that where you have a State

4

claim, that it's going to apply Federal law to that State

5

claim.

MR. DABNEY:
Midwest case.

The Federal Circuit --

QUESTION:

That is exactly what it did in the

Mr. Dabney, we're all quite close to

I think perhaps we can hear you even if you don't

speak so quite so loudly.

11

(Laughter.)

12

QUESTION:

You -- you are saying that the

13

Federal Circuit said we have the right not only to

14

determine what is an answer to a Federal issue, but we

15

have a right to tell Iowa what the law of the State of

16

Iowa is?

17

That would be astonishing.
MR. DABNEY:

I invite Your Honor to look at

18

pages 1564 and 65 of volume 175 of Federal 3rd, and Your

19

Honor will read there that the Federal Circuit reversed a

20

summary judgment under Iowa State law on the ground that

21

in its view the Federal patent law doesn't limit any claim

22

that can be asserted under Iowa State law.

23

the district court erred in not holding that Iowa State

24

law could protect the shape of a trailer winch post.

25

QUESTION:

And therefore,

Mr. Dabney, would you heed my

admonition?

about the Federal Circuit saying, well, if it's a Federal

MR. DABNEY:

I am not questioning that that is

12

what the Federal Circuit is currently doing, and that it

13

-- it -- I'm not questioning it has the power to do that.

14

QUESTION:

May I ask this -- just a question

15

about the history of what we've got before us?

16

correct in believing that until the Federal Circuit

17

changed its view and started to apply its own law to non-

18

patent issues as opposed to applying other circuits' law

19

when the case arose in another circuit, the bar generally

20

was totally happy with the rule that the counterclaim

21

would -- counterclaim alleging a patent claim would be

22

sufficient to give appellate jurisdiction to the Federal

23

Circuit?

25

MR. DABNEY:

Am I

I cannot say that that is a fair

characterization of what the bar generally holds.

I

Well, may I ask a question?
Certainly.

Not -- not your case certainly, but

23

we had a case called Cardinal Chemical Company v. Morton

International in 1993, which seemed to say that a patent

law counterclaim could serve as an independent basis for a

district court's original jurisdiction.

MR. DABNEY:

That's not how I read Cardinal

Chemical, Justice O'Connor.

4

QUESTION:

Okay.

5

MR. DABNEY:

Cardinal Chemical was a straight-

6

up patent infringement case.

The defendant in that case

7

asserted two -- at least two things in -- in response to

8

the claim of patent infringement.

9

Cardinal Chemical said, your patent is invalid, and

The defendant in

10

therefore I'm not liable.

11

nowadays, the defendant in Cardinal Chemical says, I also

12

want a counterclaim for declaratory judgment that your

13

patent is invalid.

14

so that if you, the plaintiff, decide to pull the plug on

15

your suit, I can stay in court on my counterclaim.

16

that was what came up and that was the issue.

17

And then, as many defendants do

One of the reasons why I want that is

And

However, it's very clear that since at least

18

1990 the source of a district court's power to hear a

19

counterclaim like that is in 1367, supplemental

20

jurisdiction.

The district court unquestionably --

MR. DABNEY:

Not -- absolutely not.

1367.

So -QUESTION:

What is -- what is -- taking a case,

Mr. Dabney -- and this has come up I think again and again

2

MR. DABNEY:

Yes.

But in that situation,

3

Justice Ginsburg, you're not talking about nullifying a

4

plaintiff's choice of law and forum through the -- the

5

assertion of a well-pleaded complaint.

6

asserts a defective complaint and shouldn't --

7

QUESTION:

If a plaintiff

The question I asked you is you said

8

that what had been going on for years before there was

9

1367 codified, all of a sudden that independent Federal

10

claim, be it an antitrust claim, a patent claim, suddenly

11

becomes shrunken to a supplemental jurisdiction rather

12

than having its own jurisdictional peg.

13

MR. DABNEY:

I don't know that the legal

14

significance of the source of a district court's power to

15

act in that situation has ever been a subject on which any

16

legal consequences followed so that the body of law that

17

developed on that would have any precedential significance

18

in this situation.

19

The fact -- the critical distinction between

20

this situation and the one Your Honor is positing is that

21

in the situations Your Honor is talking about, you're not

22

talking about a plaintiff who had a well-pleaded complaint

23

who he prevailed on being ousted of his chosen court and

24

forum.

25

of a counterclaim in that situation sheds any light on

I don't believe that the appropriate disposition

into the district court because that's where it belongs?

3

I just don't understand why the rule that would apply to

4

the district court carries over to the specialized court

5

of appeals if you are, in fact, dealing with a patent

6

claim that's been adjudicated.

7

MR. DABNEY:

This Court has held and the -- the

8

congressional choice of the arising under referent for

9

Federal Circuit jurisdiction clearly recognized that there

10

will be many, many times when patent law questions and

11

patent law issues, including the issue of validity, will

12

be decided not just in the regional circuits, but in the

13

State courts.

14

Would it really have mattered in Lear v. Adkins

15

if the defendant in that case hadn't just said, the

16

contract is invalid because the patent is no good and

17

there's no consideration, if it had filed a counterclaim,

18

as was done in Cardinal Chemical and said, I want a

19

declaratory judgment that the patent isn't valid?

20

legal consequence should follow from that.

21

No

And in the real world, Justice Ginsburg, if a

defendant really is concerned about maintaining its access

It

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. GOWDEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In light of the colloquy that we've had, I want

24

to make a preliminary point and then a couple other

25

starting points.

25
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

The first is that there's absolutely no issue

2

that the Federal Circuit has failed to follow this Court's

3

precedents and, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out

4

previously, correctly anticipated this Court's holding in

5

Christianson.

6

And to respond to a question that Justice

7

O'Connor raised, in the Cardinal case, this Court did say,

8

in this case Cardinal properly invoked the original

9

jurisdiction of a district court by way of its patent

10
11

counterclaim.
QUESTION:

Mr. Gowdey, do you think the court of

12

-- the Federal Circuit's opinion here is entirely

13

consistent with footnote 2 in our Colt opinion?

14

MR. GOWDEY:

15

QUESTION:

16
17

In the which opinion, Your Honor?

In -- in our Christianson v. Colt

Industries?
MR. GOWDEY:

I think -- I think that the

18

position that the Federal Circuit has taken this Court is

19

completely consistent with Christian v. Colt.

20

QUESTION:

And -- and with footnote 2 therein?

21

MR. GOWDEY:

Yes.

And -- and I say that because

22

of the reasoning and the procedures and the -- and the

23

considered exhaustive review that the Federal Circuit made

24

in Aerojet or the Christian v. Colt case.

25

their Aerojet decision saying that the question was of

MR. GOWDEY:

That is absolutely correct, Your

Honor.

6

They -- they looked --

7

QUESTION:

But it does seem to be unlikely, does

8

it not, that where the counterclaim raising the patent

9

issue hasn't been dealt with and what we're dealing with

10

is an appeal from this injunction which was rendered in

11

the plaintiff's suit below -- why should the CAFC get into

12

it at all?

13

MR. GOWDEY:

Because we should look at

14

jurisdiction for an appellate court at the time of the

15

pleading stage of the case, Your Honor.

16

pleading stage, you have the complaint and you have the

17

answer and counterclaims --

QUESTION:

And at the

I would think it would have to be

19

considered also in light of what's happened in this case.

20

I don't see why you would be so limited necessarily.

21

seems so odd that this appeal would go to the Federal

22

Circuit.

23

MR. GOWDEY:

It

I -- I don't think it's odd, Your

24

Honor.

I think that you have to establish appellate

25

jurisdiction at the beginning of a case so that as a case

proceeds, if there are interlocutory appeals that -- that

2

are going to happen, where is it that they should be

3

properly directed?

4

-- as to that.

5

if you look under 1338 and 1295, talking about civil

6

actions and claims, the jurisdiction of a Federal Circuit

7

should -- should be decided by what claims are pled.

8
9
10

And there should not be a conundrum as

And if you look at the claims in the case,

QUESTION:

Well, what case of ours do you think

most strongly supports your view of this jurisdictional
question?

11

MR. GOWDEY:

I -- I think you have to look at

12

Christian v. Colt and the fact that in that case, the

13

decision said it should be adapted to 1338.

14

Aerojet decision that comes along after that and its

15

exhaustive review of Christianson makes clear that -- that

16

you should look at claims.

17

the patent situation --

18

QUESTION:

I think the

And as you're adapting 1338 to

Mr. Gowdey, I -- I think Aerojet

19

makes a whole lot of sense if -- if the issue before the

20

-- the court there and the issue before us here were what

21

makes sense.

22

right.

23

Then -- then Aerojet may -- may well be

But -- but it seems to me that the issue really

24

before us is what does section 1295 mean.

What was it

25

understood to mean when it spoke of a claim arising under

29
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

any act of Congress relating to copyrights and trademarks?

2

And that's a different question.

3

history known to every first-year law student that a case

4

arises under a certain law, if the well-pleaded complaint

5

invokes that law and does not arise under that law if --

6

if a counterclaim invokes it, I find it hard to believe

7

that anyone would interpret the statute, written with that

8

magic language, in any other way.

9

And when you have a long

Now, it -- it might well be the case, as you

10

argue, that another disposition is more sensible for the

11

Federal Circuit.

12

Congress said, and the -- and the whole issue is whether a

13

claim arising under an act of Congress isn't magic

14

language that -- that the whole legal community has known

15

for many years, which means you have to have a well-

16

pleaded complaint invoking it.

But we have to deal here with what

17

MR. GOWDEY:

18

QUESTION:

19
20

Well --

And that's what I think we said in

Christianson.
MR. GOWDEY:

Well, in Christian v. -- in

21

Christianson, however, there was no counterclaim.

That --

22

that issue was not before the Court.

I think looking at the Aerojet decision and looking at the

25

review that it made of Christianson is important for this

QUESTION:

There were --

Not just Aerojet, but I would like

3

you to pursue that because my understanding is the same as

4

Justice Scalia's.

5

to the Chief Justice's question, that footnote 2 applies.

6

I take it that means we now have an issue that does not

7

just concern patent law.

8

jurisdiction.

9

You started out by saying, in response

It concerns all of Federal

You then said we look to what is filed in the

10

11

12

Again, all of

You then say that all these other cases involved

13

a well-pleaded complaint and an answer.

14

involves a well-pleaded complaint and a compulsory

15

counterclaim.

16

MR. GOWDEY:

17

QUESTION:

This one, though,

Yes --

I agree.

So, I look up Wright and

18

Miller, and Wright and Miller says it is not sufficient

19

for the Federal question to enter the case as a

20

counterclaim asserted by the defendant.

21

just make that up.

that point I think QED.

where you -- and there is no issue of federalism here.

12

13

Federal district court in Kansas.

QUESTION:

Then you're -- you're now defeating

15

your first concession which was with footnote 2 in

MR. GOWDEY:

But once you tell me that this

32
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

involves all cases of removal, I suddenly get quite

2

nervous about departing from well-settled law.

3

MR. GOWDEY:

Then -- then I must retract it.

It

4

does not -- it does not involve all cases of removal.

5

This is a patent case, and -- and I think we're talking

6

about patent issues and whether the Federal Circuit has

7

proper jurisdiction of claims in a case involving patent

8

issues.

9

QUESTION:

Well, then that means we interpret,

10

under your view, arising under in different ways in the --

11

in the patent statute and in -- in the Federal

12

jurisdiction statute.

13

MR. GOWDEY:

I -- I think that arising under is

14

not to be interpreted in a different way, but I think as

15

this Court said in Christianson, that it should be adapted

16

to 1338.

17

1295, Congress was interested in getting as many patent

18

claims to the Federal Circuit as it could.

19

It should be adapted to 1338 because, under

QUESTION:

But certainly Christianson gave no

20

intimation that the phrase, arising under, should be

21

interpreted differently in the statute conferring

22

jurisdiction on the Federal Circuit as it has

23

traditionally been in 1331.

24

MR. GOWDEY:

25

QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.

Is there a difference in interpreting

33
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

a different way and adapting?

2

MR. GOWDEY:

I -- I think it's a question of --

3

of looking at claims that are pled in a case.

If -- if

4

you look at the second point of Chief -- Chief Judge

5

Markey in Aerojet, he was -- he was taking a -- a look at

6

claims.

7

out earlier, has its own separate, independent

8

jurisdictional base under 1338.

9

patent claim comes in under 1338 with its own

And a patent claim, as Justice O'Connor pointed

Once you find that a

10

jurisdictional basis, under 1295 that is an appeal-

11

directing mechanism that Congress put into place.

12

And -- and I think that if you go again to

13

Aerojet, as Chief Judge Markey pointed out in his first

14

reason for why the patent counterclaim should be

15

considered arising under and give appellate jurisdiction,

16

had that counterclaim been filed as a complaint, there's

17

no question that -- that Federal Circuit jurisdiction

18

would have been invoked.

19

QUESTION:

But that's -- you can say that by

20

analogy to 1331 too, that although you can have a -- a

21

compulsory counterclaim will not change the result there.

22

It still goes to Federal court if -- if the well-pleaded

23

complaint doctrine is applied.

24

compulsory counterclaim could have been in its own right a

25

case of Federal question, but that doesn't change the

MR. GOWDEY:

It does not change the rule.

I

3

believe, Your Honor, you're talking about removal cases.

4

And certainly if -- if you have --

5

QUESTION:

But why does it make a difference if

6

we're talking about removal cases?

7

is exactly the same.

8
9

MR. GOWDEY:

Because the language

Because I think in a

Federal/Federal situation where there is no federalism,

10

there is no issue with respect to States' rights and

11

States' claims.

12

reading of 1338 or 1295 where you -- where we're concerned

13

about somehow taking away the essence of -- of a State

14

court to deal with State court actions.

15

not talking about that.

16

think, even go there.

17

And -- and we're not talking about a -- a

And -- and we're

This Court does not need to, I

We're talking about a situation where you have a

18

Federal question that has been properly presented in a

19

Federal court.

20

-- a patent counterclaim comes in that has its own

21

separate jurisdictional base under 1338.

22

then is, from an appellate standpoint, has Congress set up

23

and dictated an appellate-directing mechanism with 1295?

24

And I think they have.

25

said, as long as jurisdiction was based in whole or in

Original jurisdiction has been applied.

A

The question

And they recognized when they

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

part under 1338, that not all of the case would have to be

2

patent cases.

3

It could be part of it.

And once you have the nexus between a district

4

court having original jurisdiction under 1338, 1295

5

directs that that appeal -- for the patent cases, 1295

6

directs that appeal should go to the Federal Circuit.

7

I -- I think the basic purpose of -- of the

8

well-pleaded complaint rule was -- was to avoid the -- the

9

sort of State/Federal conflicts.

Since that's not here,

10

then there is -- is no reason to say that there should be

11

a compelled disregard of -- of counterclaims.

12

Congress' intent was to get as many patent claims as

13

possible to the Federal Circuit, again --

14

QUESTION:

And where

But you -- you can say, I think, that

15

when Congress used the term, well-pleaded complaint, its

16

intent was to have the same sort of analysis as there is

17

in 1331.

18

20

MR. GOWDEY:
same.

I -- I think the language is the

Congress didn't use it -- Congress

didn't say well-pleaded complaint.

22

arising under.

It said -- it said

23

MR. GOWDEY:

24

And I think, as this Court said in Christianson,

25

Yes, Your Honor.

by adapting that under 1338, there are -- there is a way

36
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

to accomplish both the jurisdictional goals and the intent

2

of Congress of getting patent claims --

3

QUESTION:

But you are giving arising under a

4

different meaning for appellate purposes.

5

including the counterclaim, a different meaning from

6

original jurisdiction where, as Justice Breyer read,

7

everybody agrees that for original jurisdiction purposes,

8

counterclaims don't count.

9
10
11
12

MR. GOWDEY:
QUESTION:

You are

I -- I think --

You're suggesting they do count for

appellate jurisdiction.
MR. GOWDEY:

I'm suggesting that they do, and

13

I'm suggesting that Congress recognized that in 1295 where

14

-- where, unlike petitioner, I -- I think when -- when a

15

plaintiff comes into court, clearly he has his choice of

16

-- of what Federal court to go to, what State, and so on.

17

Under 1295, once you have patent claims in a case, I think

18

Congress set up an appellate-directing mechanism that --

19

that does not make it a litigant's choice.

20

where it goes.

21

QUESTION:

It defines

Suppose you did do that, which -- I

22

mean, suppose you took Justice Stevens' concurring view in

23

Christianson, which was a view that would come closer to

24

doing what you want.

25

the -- look at the case after it's decided in the district

It would make sense.

You'd look at

37
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

court to see where -- whether there's a patent claim.

2

You'd still lose here, wouldn't you?

3
4

MR. GOWDEY:

Well, I think Justice Stevens

actually goes farther than we need to go because --

5

QUESTION:

Well, why farther?

6

go just as far as he went.

7

went.

You went just as far as he

You look at the whole thing after it's decided.

8

MR. GOWDEY:

9

QUESTION:

10

Because I would

Well --

Now, how could you go further than

that?

11

MR. GOWDEY:

Well, I'm saying he -- he went

12

further.

13

even look at -- at Federal Circuit jurisdiction being --

14

being shown where you have amended a complaint later on,

15

that you could get a patent issue under that -- in at that

16

point.

17

He -- he's saying, I believe, that you could

In -- in this case here, there was a patent

18

issue that came in at the pleading stage.

19

that's the distinction that I -- that I would see.

20

why I'm saying you don't have to go so far as -- as to say

21

you look at the well-tried case.

22

QUESTION:

And so that --

Was there patents issue adjudicated

23

at all here?

24

the 54(b) judgment, was on trade dress alone?

25

That's

And there was not a judgment.

MR. GOWDEY:

The judgment,

There has not been a patent ruling

1

yet, Your Honor.

2
3

We didn't get that far.

QUESTION:

We haven't --

So, there's not only the no judgment,

but no adjudication?

4

MR. GOWDEY:

No adjudication, not even any

5

discovery, Your Honor.

6

patent case that has, in essence, a -- a very young one,

7

that has not gotten very far except for the fact that we

8

have this preliminary injunction from Judge Brown in

9

Kansas.

10

QUESTION:

So -- so, we have a patent -- a

I think it would be consistent with

11

Justice Stevens' opinion to say you look to see what was

12

adjudicated.

13

if what was adjudicated was the patent claim, whether it

14

were a claim or a counterclaim, then that's what should

15

count.

16

then that's what should count.

His concurring opinion suggests that.

And

If what were adjudicated were a trade dress claim,

17

MR. GOWDEY:

1338, however, talks about civil

18

actions, and civil actions goes -- goes back to a

19

description of being all claims for relief.

20

that you should look for the claims that are made for

21

relief at the time the case is -- is being pled.

22

the point at which I think you should have appellate

23

jurisdiction being decided so that as interim or

24

interlocutory appeals happens, you know appellate court it

25

goes to.

We would say

That is

39
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

If you waited until you -- you saw what was

2

actually tried in a case and, as Justice Stevens

3

suggested, you waited even to see if the -- if a complaint

4

would be amended subsequently after the pleading stage,

5

earlier -- earlier disposition of interlocutory orders

6

might go somewhere else, and appropriately so.

7

QUESTION:

If the district court has to decide

8

which of two different circuits' laws you're going to

9

follow, I guess he knows what the case is going to look

10

like at the end -- or she.

11

doesn't because the trial doesn't know which circuit to

12

follow, so he doesn't know how it's going to come out.

13
14

MR. GOWDEY:

Maybe -- maybe the trial judge

Well, but if -- Your Honor, if --

if --

15

QUESTION:

It's a circular analysis.

16

MR. GOWDEY:

If -- if you're looking at the

17

claims that are pled at the pleading stage, the district

18

court judge will know what appellate court will -- will

19

apply certainly under the Aerojet rule, which -- which

20

again would -- would place appellate jurisdiction at the

21

Federal Circuit if you have a well-pled patent

22

counterclaim coming in at the pleading stage as part of

23

the defendant's answer.

24
25

QUESTION:

But you will -- you will have the

situation then in which the district judge is -- is going

40
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

to have to defy the law of his circuit on a -- on the non-

patent issue.

3

MR. GOWDEY:

Perhaps that's a more difficult

4

question.

5

6

of appeal, certainly would make an effort to apply the

7

appropriate regional circuit law to non-patent issues.

8

I think the Federal Circuit, being a sister --

QUESTION:

Well, the claim is -- and I -- I will

be candid to say I'm not in a position to -- to evaluate

10

this claim because I haven't gone back and looked at -- at

11

many of the cases on it to find out what's really going

12

on.

13

Circuit is not doing that.

14

But I mean, the claim is made that the Federal

MR. GOWDEY:

Well, I think the Federal Circuit

15

is making an attempt to look at its -- its historical base

16

for decisions with respect to those issues that relate to,

17

in effect, patent law issues.

18

coming from the Federal Circuit, they're making an attempt

19

to apply law of their own where they find either there --

20

there is conflict or where there has not been a well-

21

grounded set of policies or law to decide an issue.

22

the regional circuit has laws that are not affecting

23

patents, my reading is the Federal Circuit is applying

24

regional circuit law in an appropriate way as they see fit

25

from panel to panel.

Now, the way I read cases

That's what it used to do.

they -- you think it's still doing that?

MR. GOWDEY:

You say

It's still

I think they are, and I think as

6

measure, it's a relatively young court.

7

around half of its lifetime since 1990.

QUESTION:

Aerojet has been

Well, I understand at the time

Aerojet was decided, they did that.

But I thought there

10

was a recent -- in the last year or 2, they had taken a

11

different view and were applying their own law as opposed

12

to the Tenth Circuit law in this case on the non-patent

13

law issues.

14

MR. GOWDEY:

Certainly in Midwest, they -- they

15

were -- they were taking a look at trade dress law because

16

of the interrelationship trade dress has on the Lanham Act

17

with patent issues.

18

looking at new law and saying where there is an

19

interaction of laws and holdings with respect to patent

20

issues, that that is an area that they -- they can and

21

perhaps should get into.

22

QUESTION:

To that extent, they certainly were

But that seems somewhat inconsistent

23

with the last part of 1295(a), which in effect says that

24

when it's a non-patent law issue, they -- the 1291 and the

25

1292 and 1294 shall apply.

2

MR. GOWDEY:

Are you talking about the exception

of 1295, Your Honor?

3

QUESTION:

Yes.

4

MR. GOWDEY:

Certainly that's a two-part

5

exception, and where you have other claims pending, you

6

can still have jurisdiction under 1338.

7

QUESTION:

Okay.

So, now the trial judge has to

8

say, well, there may be two circuits involved here.

9

is my own circuit and it's not related, and so the Federal

10

Circuit won't control, but if it's somehow related to the

11

patent claim, then the Federal Circuit would -- so, this

12

-- this is a further metaphysical exercise.

13

is great for the legal profession actually.

14

(Laughter.)

MR. GOWDEY:

This -- this

It keeps all well employed, Your

Honor.
I -- I think that where -- where there are

18

issues that relate to patent law, certainly they -- they

19

will be looking to Federal Circuit precedent to help them.

20

Where there are non-patent law issues, it's the regional

21

circuit law that can and should control.

22

think that as the court develops in time, there will be --

23

there will be a larger body of law that -- that will help

24

district circuit judges in that regard.

25

And -- and I

As respects this case, however, where -- where

Alderson Reporting Company

1

we have a patent counterclaim, I think the Aerojet

decision and looking at what went on before Christian --

3

Christianson, looking at -- at the Christianson decision

4

itself and the analysis that that court did with Chief

5

Judge Markey speaking for the whole court en banc, very

6

carefully and thoughtfully gives a legitimate basis for

7

why a Federal Circuit should have jurisdiction over cases

8

where there is a well-pleaded compulsory counterclaim at

9

the district court level.

10

Chief Judge Markey also noted at 895 F.2d at

11

742, in all events, the Supreme Court did hold in

12

Christianson or in any other case that for all cases and

13

circumstances only the complaint and never a counterclaim

14

can serve as the basis of district court jurisdiction.

15

And under section 1295, the basis of district court

16

jurisdiction is for this Court an appeal-directing

mechanism.

MR. DABNEY:

Alderson Reporting Company

1

Justice Kennedy, there is no difference between different

2

interpretation and adaptation.

3

would call for this Court to retreat from Christianson and

4

to adopt some special interpretation of arising under

5

unique to 1338(a) that deviates from the arising under

6

language as it was clearly adopted by Congress in 1295.

7

The respondent's position

Secondly, with regard to the question of -- of

8

Federal Circuit choice of law, what Mr. Gowdey stood here

9

-- I just would call -- call Your Honors' attention to

10

page 94a of the joint appendix which is the district

11

court's opinion in this case in which the district court

12

says, Vornado -- that's the respondent -- contends that

13

this change in the law exception is met because in Midwest

14

Industries, the Federal Circuit expressly rejected the

15

Tenth Circuit's Vornado I holding, ruling instead that a

16

claim for trade dress protection was not barred by the

17

fact that a product configuration has been claimed as a

18

significant inventive element of the patent.

19

its ruling in that case, the Federal Circuit abandoned its

20

prior practice of applying regional circuit law on

21

questions involving the relationship between patent law

22

and other Federal law rights and said, quote, henceforth,

23

we will apply our own law to such questions.

24
25

As part of

There is no doubt whatever that the Federal
Circuit has recently and radically changed how it

Alderson Reporting Company

1

adjudicates trade dress claims, and it was the opportunity

2

to try to take advantage of the -- of the Federal

3

Circuit's view of trade dress protection which was before

4

the Court in the TrafFix case, and rejected by the Court

5

in the TrafFix case, which drove the case that's currently

6

before the Court, which isn't to say that the Federal

7

Circuit can't do that.

8

legitimacy could have been before it, even as a matter of

9

common sense, Justice Scalia, in derogation of clearly

But by doing that, whatever

10

expressed congressional intent, in 1989, the Federal

11

Circuit has done a 180 degree U-turn in its approach to

12

its choice of law in these matters.

13

a critical underpinning of the Aerojet principle has been

14

completely wiped out.

QUESTION:

And therefore, the --

You're -- you're telling us that this

is unqualified.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. DABNEY:

My time is up.

May I answer

Yes, briefly.
The Federal Circuit has taken the

12

position that Federal patent law does not create any right

13

to copy or use anything, and therefore, it was wrong for

14

the Court in Midwest to say that Iowa State law could not

protect that.
