ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. DREEBEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

Respondent pleaded guilty with counsel by his

11

side after having been advised at least twice earlier in

12

the proceedings of his right to the assistance of counsel

13

at all stages of the proceedings.

14

nevertheless, set aside his guilty plea on the ground that

15

the district court, during the guilty plea colloquy, had

16

failed to advise respondent of his right to the assistance

17

of counsel as required by rule 11(c)(3) of the Federal

18

Rules of Criminal Procedure.

19
20
21

The court of appeals,

The court of appeals decision is wrong for three
reasons.
First, the court of appeals erred by applying a

22

harmless error rather than a plain error standard of

23

review to the district court's violation of rule 11.

24

Respondent had not objected in the trial court to the rule

25

11 error, and therefore the standard of review is that for

1

claims which were not preserved below, rather than claims

2

that were.

3

Second, the Ninth Circuit applied an incorrect

4

standard for determining whether a rule 11 error affects

5

substantial rights within the meaning of the harmless

6

error and plain error rules.

7

view that unless the defendant could be shown to have

8

knowledge of the precise aspect of rule 11, that the

9

district court had failed to inform the defendant about

The Ninth Circuit was of the

10

the guilty plea must be set aside.

11

under this Court's cases is whether the error had an

12

effect on the outcome of the proceeding, which in this

13

case means whether the error had an effect on respondent's

14

willingness to enter a knowing and voluntary guilty plea.

15

The correct standard

And finally, the Ninth Circuit erred by

16

confining its analysis of whether the error in this case

17

warranted reversal to the record of the guilty plea

18

colloquy itself, failing to look at other portions of the

19

official record that illuminated whether the defendant

20

actually had knowledge of the information that the

21

district judge had failed to provide to him.

22

case, the district court, through its magistrate judges,

23

had advised respondent, both at the initial appearance

24

after respondent was arrested and at the arraignment after

25

respondent was indicted, of his right to counsel at all

In this

stages of the proceeding.

Respondent executed a waiver of

2

rights form in which he acknowledged receiving and

3

understanding these rights, and the district magistrate

4

judge asked respondent at the arraignment whether he

5

understood these rights.

6

looked to the entire record to determine whether the rule

7

11 error in this case warranted reversal, it would have

8

concluded, even under its own standards, applying harmless

9

error review and asking whether the respondent knew the

If the court of appeals had

10

information that he had not been told during the rule 11

11

colloquy, that respondent, indeed, did have that

12

information and, therefore, entered a valid guilty plea.

13

QUESTION:

Mr. Dreeben?

14

QUESTION:

I'm not sure how your points two and

15

three quite fit together.

16

at -- to see the outcome of the proceeding, would it have

17

been different?

18

should confine yourself just to the record.

19

your point two is whether or not, you know, all the

20

circumstances -- this was a wise plea that he would have

21

-- that he would have entered -- it seems to me you might

22

be going outside the record in order to determine that.

23

And I -- and I have some question about your point two,

24

anyway.

25

Your point two is that you look

I think it goes too far.

proper inquiry into whether an error affects substantial

proceeding.

4

look to is the guilty plea itself.

5

appeals, in determining whether that standard is met, must

of course look at the record.

7

And in this case, the relevant proceeding to
Now, a court of

The difference between the position of the

8

United States and the position of the court of appeals is

9

that the court of appeals says the only record that's

10

relevant is the rule 11 guilty plea colloquy itself.

11

Nothing else matters.

12

QUESTION:

That -- that I understand.

But if

13

you're going to -- if your -- if your test under two is

14

whether or not he would have entered the plea, it seems to

15

me that that's a difficult inquiry to make if you confine

16

yourself just to the record even if it's the whole record

17

and not just the rule 11 colloquy plea itself.

18

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, it is -- it's a difficult

19

inquiry to make if there is no information in the record

20

that sheds light on it, and in that instance, the party

21

that bears the burden of proof will probably lose, which

22

is why it matters whether the standard is plain error

23

review, in which the defendant bears the burden of proof,

24

or harmless error review, in which case the Government

25

bears the burden of proof.

1

But in this case, the claim of the rule 11 error

2

is that the defendant didn't get, at his guilty plea

3

colloquy, information that he had the right to counsel at

4

every stage of the proceeding.

5

that the defendant, in fact, got that information, not

6

once but at least twice, at earlier stages of the

7

proceeding, and he had counsel by his side when he pleaded

8

guilty, not once but twice, it is untenable on this record

9

to suggest that the guilty plea would have come out any

Since the record shows

10

differently if the judge had complied with rule 11 in

11

every relevant respect.

12

QUESTION:

Mr. Dreeben, if we answer what is

13

your second question in your petition, not as outlined

14

this morning, the second question being, do you look to

15

the entire record or just the rule 11 colloquy, if we

16

answer that question in your favor, look to the entire

17

record, is it necessary to get into the two anterior

18

questions that you outline, that is plain error versus

19

harmless error, and this one that troubled Justice Kennedy

20

that you don't list as a question in your cert petition?

21

MR. DREEBEN:

Justice Ginsburg, I believe the

22

Court can reverse the judgment based solely on a favorable

23

resolution for the Government of the third question

24

presented it; that is, if the Court does look to the

25

entire record in this case, then I believe that the Ninth

1

Circuit's judgment is incorrect even if it were correct on

2

the other two points that I've outlined.

3

But there is a conflict in the circuits over the

4

question of whether harmless error review or plain error

5

review does apply in these circumstances, and the

6

Government sought review on that issue in order to have

7

this Court resolve the conflict.

8
9

QUESTION:

But if the -- if that is an academic

question -- that is, if you could argue, as I think you

10

do, if you look at the whole record -- then it doesn't

matter what standard you apply, harmless error, plain

12

error.

14

It's clear that this defendant was advised of his

MR. DREEBEN:

That is true, and the Court could

15

resolve the case solely on that basis.

16

would leave unarticulated in this Court's jurisprudence

17

the precise approach that lower courts should take when

18

rule 11 errors occur.

19

QUESTION:

If it did so, it

Well, alternatively we -- we could

resolve it just on the basis of your third point.

That would be a resolution on what

petition.

But -- but we can certainly resolve

8

it on several of the questions without resolving the other

9

ones.

10
11

MR. DREEBEN:

It's certainly possible to do

that.

12

The second question, which we did not present

13

separately, but I believe is fairly included within our

14

first question, the definition of what is an effect on

15

substantial rights for purposes of a rule 11 error, is a

16

question that the Court doesn't need to resolve in this

17

case, but it is an important analytical tool for

18

understanding what lower courts should do when confronted

19

with rule 11 errors.

20

on it would be useful.

QUESTION:

Which is more important?

I mean, if

22

-- if we're going to be very parsimonious and -- and not

decide any more issues than we have to, which -- which is

-- does the Government think is the more important issue

in the case?

The advisory committee notes to rule 11 make

clear that the harmless error rule that was added to rule

If that was the only thing that was intended

MR. DREEBEN:

Why did they just pick one?
Justice Souter, I believe that the

reason that the drafters picked just one is that the

The

1

violation in this case was of rule 11(c)(3), which

enumerates for the defendant the various rights, not a

4

defendant has at the trial.

MR. DREEBEN:

QUESTION:

I see.
And those rights --

And that one is applicable whether or

not he's represented.

9

MR. DREEBEN:

Correct.

That -- that rule is a

10

response to this Court's decision in Boykin v. Alabama

11

which held that if the record is entirely silent on

12

whether the defendant entered a knowing and intelligent

13

plea, a court of appeals on direct review cannot uphold

14

it.

15

And in response to Boykin, the drafters of the

16

rules wanted to provide a prophylactic buffer to make sure

17

that there could be no valid claims, either on direct

18

appeal or on collateral review, that the defendant pleaded

19

guilty without a sufficient understanding of the rights

20

that he would have at trial if he had gone to trial.

21

11(c)(3) walks through the right to counsel, the right to

the right to a jury trial.

finish up by saying, so if it's up to me, I wouldn't do

4

They usually

If the defendant goes through that and he elects

5

to go without counsel, he's subject to all the same

6

procedural rules that anybody else is, and it's true that

7

he won't probably do a very good job at protecting his own

8

rights, but once he decides to act as his own counsel,

9

he's not given a free pass to escape from those rights.

10

Now, if the judge doesn't give the advice

11

required by 11(c)(2) and we can't show that he has gone

12

through a thorough and adequate Faretta colloquy elsewhere

13

in the proceedings, then I suspect we're going to lose

14

that case because a felony trial without counsel is one of

15

the few errors that gives rise to a per se presumption of

prejudice without any further showing, and it would be

almost impossible for us to show or for the defendant to

fail to show that he's entitled to plead anew.

MS. KNOX:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This Court has repeatedly held that pleas of

4

guilty will not lightly be set aside when they are

5

carefully and lawfully taken.

6

from Brady and McMann to Bousley and Hyde is that pleas

7

are taken with care and discernment befitting the grave

8

and solemn act that they are.

The premise behind cases

9

The Government today proffers rules that would

10

allow pleas to be taken in almost meaningless formality,

11

taken in casual and sloppy proceedings with omissions,

12

variances, and errors which could not be remedied.

That

13

is not what the advisory committee did in rule 11.

It is

14

not what this Court has supposed in refusing to set aside

15

pleas later, and in some circumstances, it is not

16

consistent with the Constitution.

17

Our position is that plain error is never

18

applicable to review of a rule 11 violation on direct

19

appeal, and that a rule 11 variance, which goes directly

20

to the voluntariness or intelligence of the plea is always

21

prejudicial unless the record of the plea colloquy shows

22

that the requirements for an intelligent and voluntary

23

plea were met.

As to the right to counsel at trial, it could --

there could be something that happens at the rule 11

colloquy that would, in fact, put the defendant on notice

that he has that right.

QUESTION:

What's something?

7

MS. KNOX:

For example, when the court gives him

8

his right about confronting and cross examining witnesses,

9

it could be given to him in the context of his attorney

10

doing it.

you went to trial, you would have the right through your

12

attorney to confront and cross examine the witnesses

that it's harmless review, assume the burden is on the

Government to establish harmlessness, but that they may

3

look at the entire record, not just to the plea colloquy,

4

that if we look at the entire record, we must conclude

that the error was harmless?

6

MS. KNOX:

Absolutely not.

7

QUESTION:

Why not?

8

MS. KNOX:

Because in this record we have two

9

proceedings that occurred months before the taking of Mr.

10

Vonn's pleas.

Both of those proceedings were mass

11

advisements.

There was nothing personal between the

12

defendant and the court.

QUESTION:

There was no real attempt to

was actually preparing for trial a week earlier?

thought this case was scheduled for trial and they were

actually preparing for the trial.

22

MS. KNOX:

It is in the record that it was

23

scheduled for trial.

It is also clear from the record

24

that there was somewhat of an ongoing discussion, perhaps

25

disagreement, between defense counsel and Mr. Vonn as to

QUESTION:

So, the record is

Is there any evidence on the record

to the effect that his defense counsel had said to him, by

6

MS. KNOX:

No.

QUESTION:

Okay.

9

Can't we draw an inference

from the fact that there is no such thing on the record?
MS. KNOX:

No.

You know, I have -- defendants

and judges who are familiar with the system.

13

familiar with exactly how the system worked.

14

extremely odd to all of us sitting here today that a

15

defendant who has an attorney at all pretrial proceedings

would have any reason to think that his attorney was going

17

to disappear for trial.

believe that kind of thing.

Whether they

what is clear from the record is that there was a

disagreement about the defendant.

whether he would plead.
