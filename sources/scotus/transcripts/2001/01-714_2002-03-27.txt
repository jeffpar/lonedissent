ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS R. LEE, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

8
9

Mr. Lee.

MR. LEE:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

for most of the history of the census of the

10

American population, that census has been conducted by

11

means of an actual count unaltered by any methods of

12

statistical estimation.

13

of 1790, James Madison noted that this was the way

14

required by the Constitution and ever since then, that

15

requirement has been implemented by Congress in the Census

16

Act.

17

Census Bureau acted unlawfully in departing from that

18

longstanding historical tradition by using the method of

19

estimation called hot-deck imputation in the 2000

20

apportionment count.

21

apportionment count was comprised of actual data compiled

22

by census enumerators in two phases.

23

sent to all addresses on a master address file, and

24

second, as many as six follow-up visits.

At the time of the first census

The question presented in this case is whether the

99.6 percent of the 2000

1

Imputation added an additional .4 percent to that

2

count, 1.2 million statistically generated persons were

3

added to the apportionment count by means of a statistical

4

estimate.

5

the 620,000 addresses that the Census Bureau was unable to

6

enumerate are assumed to have estimated to have the same

7

number of occupants as their next door neighbors.

8
9

The basic essence of the estimate was to say

QUESTION:

Mr. Lee, I would like to ask you to

address early on whether this injury that Utah alleges to

10

have suffered is redressable in any fashion.

11

happened since the census was taken.

12

presumably has drawn districts and has gone quite far down

13

the road in reliance on the census.

14

turned over the numbers and so forth.

15

redressed, do you think, now?

16

MR. LEE:

Things have

21

both in Franklin and in Montana with regard to --

22

One of them would be a redressability

but I don't know that we have really addressed the

2

redressability issue fully in prior cases.

3

Utah have made its challenge? When is the earliest time

4

Utah could have challenged this imputation business?

5

MR. LEE:

When could

It would have been impossible, Justice

6

O'Connor, for Utah to have brought a challenge prior to

7

the census.

8
9

QUESTION:

Well, why is that? I mean, you knew,

did you, that the Census Bureau planned to use it?

10
11

As North Carolina indicated --

MR. LEE:

Yes.

We certainly had constructive

knowledge.

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. LEE:

But you wouldn't have had an injury.
We wouldn't have had an injury, and in

14

fact as the Census Bureau itself indicates, there would

15

have been no way even to have anticipated that imputation

16

would have had this effect.

17

QUESTION:

Well, you have no incentive to bring

18

a challenge until you know that you are losing a

19

congressional seat, I suppose.

20
21

MR. LEE:
one of the problems.

That's exactly right.

And that was

It took us some time to get

1

the numbers from the Census Bureau, specific state by

2

state numbers, in order to be able to determine whether in

3

fact this was a method that impacted Utah, and as soon as

4

we got those numbers, we brought this suit within a few

5

days.

6

QUESTION:

Well, was there a window of time

7

between completion of the census and the submission of the

8

numbers to the President where you could have sued? How

9

long was that period of time?

10

MR. LEE:

That was, the time line is that the

11

Secretary must submit the numbers by the end of the

12

calendar year to the President, and then the President

13

must submit those numbers within seven days after the

14

first day of the Congress.

15

was that we didn't have those numbers at that time.

16

Census Bureau had not released again state by state

17

imputation numbers until well into March of 2001, and it

18

was within a few days after that that we brought this

19

suit.

20
21
22

QUESTION:

The problem, Justice Kennedy,
The

Well, if you prevail, what's supposed

to happen?
MR. LEE:

The remedy that we are asking for,

23

Justice Kennedy, is simply a declaration and an injunction

24

to the Secretary of Commerce directing the Secretary to

25

issue a new apportionment count free of

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the statistical estimates that we believe are unlawful

2

under the Census Act and under the Census Clause of the

3

Constitution.

4

QUESTION:

Well, what's supposed to happen under

5

the Act? I mean, I went back and read the Act last night.

6

And that's geared to certain automatic apportionment, and

7

that in turn is geared to the delivery of the numbers by

8

the date specified.

9

then the President comes with different numbers.

So let's assume the Secretary and
The Act

10

doesn't have any provision in effect for self-adjustment,

11

does it?

12

MR. LEE:

And I think, Justice Souter, that's

13

effectively North Carolina's argument.

14

time deadlines set forth in the Census Act that somehow

15

stand in the way of reviewability here.

16

argument that was raised and rejected in Franklin.

17

Franklin opinions, Justice O'Connor's opinion for a four

18

justice plurality on that point, says that if this Court

19

agrees with the Plaintiffs in this case, we may presume

20

that the President of the United States will conform to

21

our decision and will in fact issue a new apportionment

22

count that is consistent with the law as we clarify it.

23

By the same token --

24

QUESTION:

That there are

That is an

I will presume that, too, but

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that was four justices, and there wasn't a specific

2

discussion of what is supposed to happen under the

3

statute, even assuming the President sort of takes counsel

4

from our opinion.

5

MR. LEE:

And the other opinion in that case,

6

Justice Souter, that also addresses this issue was Justice

7

Stevens' concurring opinion, for a separate four-justice

8

concurrence on this issue, and his analysis was in fact

9

that the statute would require the President to conform to

10

a revised count that the Secretary might present in

11

conformity to a decision of this Court.

12

QUESTION:

Well, that's what he said and as you

13

know, I joined his opinion.

14

majority, either.

15

us whether in fact the position that some of us took that

16

first time is in fact correct? Why will they, I mean, it

17

seemed so to me at the time but it's a real issue in this

18

case, as to whether the statute which is geared to

19

delivery of information at certain times can in effect

20

reverse itself.

21

MR. LEE:

But that didn't have a

So isn't it incumbent upon you to tell

The other point that Justice Stevens

22

made in his concurring opinion, Justice Souter, which I

23

think is critical on this issue, is that the time lines

24

under the statute can be

25

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

understood only to trigger, only with regard to the issue

2

of ripeness.

3

that a time deadline for executive action under a statute

4

means that you, you must -- it makes no sense to think

5

that those deadlines are a bar to judicial review.

6

fact, what we usually think of when we look at a statute

7

that has deadlines is that once those deadlines have

8

passed, then executive action is at an end, there is a

9

ripe claim that may be brought and then it's appropriate

10

In other words, it makes no sense to think

In

for the federal courts to step in.

11

QUESTION:

But those are not cases where after,

12

after the deadline provisions, you have a, a basic change

13

in, in the court's role, that after the deadline in this

14

case, you are going to have to, the court is going to have

15

to issue an opinion that purports to bind the President.

16

Which is, you know, a significant step.

17

MR. LEE:

Yes.

I think that the opinion does

18

not need to purport to bind the President, and as the

19

Court indicated in Franklin, there is no need for the

20

order to go to that point.

21

QUESTION:

Well, but I mean that's, that's even

22

worse.

23

some good may come out of it.

You want us to decide something on the ground that

that this satisfies the redressability requirement.

Let's assume that the President, were interested

in implementing our orders.

would present those same numbers, that same revised

It does not in

It is not a, it is not a, a binding order in the

QUESTION:

Well, it does bind the parties in a

7

certain extent.

It's just, there is no action required as

8

a result of it.

There is no mandate saying you must do

9

this.

10

MR. LEE:

That's right, Mr. Chief Justice, and I

11

think that that's consistent again with Justice O'Connor's

12

plurality opinion in Franklin.

13

QUESTION:

We have never held that a declaratory

14

judgment will issue where the Court has no power to compel

15

the action that the declaratory judgment describes.

16

mean, you cannot get jurisdiction by saying well, you

17

know, we have no power to, over this person to compel any

18

action, but we are just going to declare what the law is

19

because this person, you know, might follow it.

20

think that's a basis for jurisdiction.

21

MR. LEE:

I

I don't

Well, Justice Scalia, but I think

22

there are two alternative theories.

1

Stevens' approach in Franklin, and Justice Stevens'

2

approach in Franklin in fact, is in fact that the

3

President is required to conform with revised numbers.

4

But the Secretary might represent --

5

QUESTION:

But you are actually taking a

6

position also that whether or not the President would

7

respond, at least the Secretary would have a duty to do

8

something in response to our order.

10

MR. LEE:

That's exactly right.

QUESTION:

Is it quite common that in suits the

11

President is not named, and the Secretary is.

The final step, Justice Ginsburg, in

16

this process, is for the clerk of the House of

they are entitled to after clerk receives the revised

and either under Justice O'Connor's approach or under

Justice Stevens' approach in the Franklin opinions, we can

to this Court's order.

QUESTION:

MR. LEE:

Well, the actual enumeration clause of

the Constitution would require an actual count, and --

13

QUESTION:

Okay.

But what, supposing that the

census people have, they see a house, and they see a car

in the driveway, but they can never find anybody home, and

16

17

best.

18

They do their

Do they have to say nobody lives there?
MR. LEE:

Yes, they do, Mr. Chief Justice, and

19

one of the reasons is that the mere fact that there are

20

lights on and cars there doesn't tell us that this is

21

anyone's usual place of residence.

22

vacation home.

1
2

isn't it a permissible inference for the census takers?
MR. LEE:

Well, at some point a census taker may

3

make a conclusion, if it's based on information specific

4

to an individual household, may make a conclusion that a

5

household is in fact occupied.

6

the Census Act requires, Section 195, is -- what the

7

Census Act prohibits, rather, is the use of information

8

specific not to that individual household but specific to

9

an entirely different household for the purpose of drawing

10
11

Our position is that what

an inference.
QUESTION:

Okay.

Would you, on that theory,

12

would you agree that although they may not impute a number

13

beyond one, it would be fair for them at least to count it

14

as one? Because they start out as I understand it with a,

15

in effect a report from the post office saying, you know,

16

this is a house at which somebody lives.

17

kind of hearsay just as good as, let's say, the next door

18

neighbor's hearsay at least to the extent of saying

19

somebody lives there and they can count one person?

20

MR. LEE:

So isn't that

Justice Souter, they don't start out

21

with the proposition that this is a house and somebody

22

lives there.

They start out with the

25

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

proposition that this is an address.

2

QUESTION:

Well, doesn't an address usually mean

3

somebody lives there, at least if we can establish that

4

it's a residential neighborhood?

5

MR. LEE:

Not necessarily, for a number of

6

reasons.

Number one, you have got the seasonal home

7

problem.

It may be no one's personal, no one's usual

8

place of residence.

9

Number two, you have got the problem that some

10

things that look like homes and that are in residential

11

areas actually turn out to be businesses.

12

QUESTION:

What percentage of homes in the

13

United States when they take the census turn out to be

14

vacation or second homes?

MR. LEE:

I don't have that number handy off the

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

that imputation assigns occupancy not only to units,

2

Justice Souter, that are known to be houses.

3

QUESTION:

That's saying that they are doing it

4

bad.

5

suppose they have learned with experience that an old age

home that has two bedrooms in each apartment and that has

7

a sign out in front that says "full," has two people.

8

in each bedroom.

10
11
12

We have to assume they are doing it good.

I mean,

One

And now they learn something about this

It's an old age home.

It has two bedrooms.

And

the sign in front says full.
Now, can they make the assumption that this too
has two people in it?

13

MR. LEE:

14

QUESTION:

I think not.
Not.

Now, why not? Can they make an

15

assumption that if the pizza man delivers pizza to the

16

place and people eat the pizza, i.e., at least it

17

disappears, that there is someone in the house? Can they

18

make that assumption?

19

MR. LEE:

20

QUESTION:

They cannot, Justice Breyer.
They cannot make the assumption about

21

the pizza man.

22

4

QUESTION:

And by the way, there is a sign in

front that says this is not a vacation home.

5

(Laughter.)

6

MR. LEE:

7

those circumstances, then we'd have information.

8
9

Then I suppose -- I suppose under

QUESTION:

Fine.

But --

Once you are down, once you

are down that road, then you are then -- then I can easily

10

construct examples where the imputation is absolutely as

11

strong.

12

you are not against imputations, you are against weak

13

imputations.

14
15

I mean, I just did that with my old age home.

MR. LEE:

No.

So

I'm against sampling because

that's what the statute prohibits.

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. LEE:

You have to take that position.
I think it's important, though, to

18

answer your question, Justice Breyer, to go back to the

19

baseline of the House of Representatives decision.

20

holds that a method proposed by the Census Bureau in 1997

21

is a method of sampling.

22

is really a narrow statutory question presented here and

23

it is, is this particular method meaningfully different?

24

And the

It

25

17
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

answer is that it is not.

2

It is not under the statistical understanding of

3

the term sampling.

4

that the appellees are proposing here is a definition that

5

would nullify this Court's decision in the House of

6

Representatives because the two methods simply are not

7

distinguishable.

8

definitions and explain why that's true.

9

It also is not because the definition

Let me talk about the appelees'

The definitions that they propose say that

10

sampling is limited to methods that are employed as a last

11

resort, only after an initial effort to enumerate the

12

whole population.

13

neither one of the methods that's at issue here would

14

follow sampling, and so that effectively is an argument

15

if they could find somebody there, they would just

2

automatically say yes, that person counts? Without

3

inquiring as to whether it's a vacation home or not?

4

MR. LEE:

Well, if they know that there is

5

somebody who is living there, they have to find out

6

whether the somebody who is living there lives there as

7

his usual place of residence, or that person doesn't count

8

in the apportionment count. But what's going on --

9

QUESTION:

But under the imputation method as I

10

understand it, the assumption is made that if a house is

11

there, that it is a residence, and a second assumption is

12

made that the number of occupants will be that in a

13

general geographic area of other homes.

MR. LEE:

That's right.

Is that right?

sense in which this particular method of imputation is a

method of sampling.

Sampling is taking

I'm curious both in your argument

here this morning and in the brief, I think both parties

seem to assume that the key question is whether or not

this is sampling.

statistical methods of adjustment are permitted just so

13

Do you take the position that other

That is permissible under our theory.

16

That's the use of proxy data that the Bureau currently

17

engages in and Mr. Chief Justice, that would be

18

permissible.

19

QUESTION:

But the Act refers both to sampling

20

and to other methods of statistical adjustment.

21

to me sampling is a way to gather the data, and what we

22

are talking about here are statistical assumptions made to

evaluate the

2

lose if we say this isn't sampling.

3

MR. LEE:

Well, there may be another way to get

4

there, Justice Kennedy, but my understanding under the

5

statute is that Section 195 prohibits the statistical

6

method known as sampling.

7

other statistical methods that are not, that don't amount

8

to sampling, and the quality assurance example that I gave

9

I think is one of those examples that would be permitted

10
11

That may suggest that there are

under the statute.
But all methods that take information from a

12

part, from these 620,000 addresses that are occupied, to

13

make an inference about the rest of the population, the

14

620,000 addresses that we don't know anything about, those

15

are methods of sampling and again you really cannot

16

distinguish this method in any meaningful way from the

17

method that was struck down in 1997.

18

difference is that instead of 620,000 addresses about

19

20

anticipated that there may be many more.

QUESTION:

Yes.

2

only one inference is being drawn from a sample of one,

3

and that is at least a tremendous difference in degree,

4

and I suppose it's a difference in degree that would be

5

likely to have an effect on accuracy.

not distinguish this method from the method struck down in

11

QUESTION:

Well, it wouldn't in a literal sense

12

if you were simply making one imputation at a time, but

13

you were making a long series of imputations from the one

14

sample, in this case, the one house.

15

one imputation made one time, and it involves not so much

17

You can characterize it not only as based on a principle

of selection, but you can, you can characterize it on, on

Under the 1997 plan, it's clear that the Census

You have the statistical definition,

is, that your definition applies to all inference.

involves looking at the houses that returned the form,

It seems unfair to Utah, though, to

Here's why it's

Because the unfairness is so great for the

If it had been determined by the Bureau itself

or through litigation that imputation could not be used in

8

means other than imputation to ascertain the enumeration

of those established residential addresses whose records

10
11

were damaged, missing or incomplete.
There are in North Carolina approximately 16,000

12

households that are established residential addresses on

QUESTION:

Mr. Dellinger, you have recognized

12

that your argument is, as stated, that the position of

Utah that can't project what the returns will be, does not

have, does not qualify as an aggrieved person at the only

15

moment in time when it can say that it's aggrieved.

17

Because time is running and I think we grasp your position

that it's too bad they are not aggrieved because they have

to come in in the beginning and not at the end.

QUESTION:

Are you sure they were not aggrieved

at the beginning? I'm surprised that you -- I mean, is it

not an aggrievement for the State of Utah or for any state

that its districts are distorted? Even if it doesn't lose,

6

you know, congressmen to another state, isn't the

7

distortation of the districts within that state a

grievance of that state?

MR. DELLINGER:

That is a very helpful answer,

10

and that is not -- a very helpful suggestion.

SOLICITOR GENERAL, DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

11

ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL APPELLEES

12

GENERAL OLSON:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:

15

about a tiny fraction of damaged, discrepant or missing

16

population data for the past five censuses.

The Census Bureau has consistently

QUESTION:

Do you agree that that's a

18

statistical methodology or is it just a method of making

19

deductions from circumstantial evidence?

20

GENERAL OLSON:

We agree that it is a

21

statistical methodology, Justice Kennedy, and it's very

22

important in that context to focus on the words of the

23

statute.

24

statistical method known as sampling is the one

The words of the statute are that the

2

That statement in the statute suggests that

3

other statistical methods are not prohibited by the

4

statuted, and that one particular statistical method, that

5

is the one that is known as sampling, which is in quotes

in the statute, which imports that it's a term of art that

was known by Congress to be a term of art.

the Wisconsin decision which was unanimous decision by

20

this Court just six years ago, distinguishing the sampling

23

described on pages 4 and 5 of the Respondent's brief,

to on those pages of the Supreme Court, this Court's

2

unanimous decision just six years ago as being an entirely

3

different thing.

4

We would go back also to the fact that this

5

Court unanimously held in that case that the Constitution

6

vests virtually unlimited discretion in Congress

7

respecting the manner in which the census shall be

8

conducted, and that Congress has delegated its broad

9

authority to the Secretary to take the census in such form

10

and content as he shall direct.

11

exercised that discretion by passing it on to the

12

Secretary with the one limitation with respect, with

13

respect to one statistical method known as sampling.

14

Now, the Congress has

Now, at the same time, the Secretary was

15

proposing the prohibition of the sampling method; with

16

respect to the apportionment of the census in 1957, the

17

Secretary was planning the 1960 census, which was the

18

first computerized census and the first time that the

19

imputation method which we are talking about today was

20

used.

21

that hot-deck imputation was sampling, because the very

22

next census three years later imputation was being used in

23

that census.

24

and 2000.

So it's obvious that the Secretary did not believe

And it was used again in 1970, 1980, 1990,

case.

It is widely understood in the industry that

sampling is a collection of, a collection technique

6

whereby a sample, a fraction of the whole population is

9

It seemed to me that a metaphor that might be
considered outside the context of population gathering

10

would be if the Court asked the library of this Court to

11

ascertain the number of books, to conduct the number of

12

books in the Court's library, and the, but sampling was

13

not permitted to do that, so that the librarian could not

go to every third shelf, multiply, count the books,

15

multiply by three and get the census.

16

librarian went to those shelves and counted every

17

particular volume and found that there was a space here on

18

that shelf, a space this big on the next shelf, and a

19

space this big on another shelf, for example, the

20

imputation would be saying well, all the books or the

books right next to this are this size, and therefore that

And, but wouldn't the deference to the agency, even if

there is to be some, potentially be outweighed by a

within the meaning of the constitutional requirement, and

given, given that constitutional doubt, we think the wise

course is to interpret the word sampling as including,

4

including this?

5

GENERAL OLSON:

Justice Scalia, not only the

6

Wisconsin case, but the other decisions of this Court

7

which have considered census have suggested that the

8

framers of the Constitution by using the word enumeration

9

didn't mean a particular method by which the census would

10

be conducted, nor did it wish to constrain both the

11

Congress and whomever the Congress may delegate to --

12

QUESTION:

GENERAL OLSON:

QUESTION:

GENERAL OLSON:

Even sampling, presumably.
Presumably.

Possibly.

Pretty accurate sampling, you know?
Possibly, Justice Scalia.

that's nowhere close to that and this is not remotely

QUESTION:

19

GENERAL OLSON:

Is this remotely estimation?
This is not remotely estimation.

This is drawing an inference with respect to one

isn't it estimation? You estimate that there are so many

2

people in this house because the house next door to it has

3

that many people.

4

You don't call that estimation?

GENERAL OLSON:

In each of these cases, Justice

5

Scalia, the words can be changed and added to, but the

6

process by which the framers analyzed this in framing the

7

Constitution, the very first House of Representatives was

8

assigned according to an estimation, and the words actual

9

enumeration were used to compare an actual count, an

10

effort to find the actual number of people by indulging in

11

a process --

12

QUESTION:

That's why I asked about estimation.

13

You say there is a difference in an estimation and a

14

deduction, I suppose.

GENERAL OLSON:

What I think the Constitution

and courts with respect to the term actual enumeration, is

an effort to go out and find a count.

argument is that since enumeration doesn't mean anything

2

except census, sampling would be okay.

3

GENERAL OLSON:

From the standpoint of the

4

Constitution, I think a reasonably good argument could be

5

made and the Government has in the past made it, that

6

sampling if it is consistent with the process of an

7

attempt to find an actual count utilizing sophisticated

8

accurate and nonmanipulatable techniques --

9

QUESTION:

Surely the term actual, though,

10

before the word enumeration, narrows the idea that, what

11

might otherwise be an enumeration.

12

GENERAL OLSON:

I believe it does and I think,

13

Chief Justice, the District Court in this case

14

distinguished actual enumeration from the conjectural

15

apportionment that actually occurred in the Constitution

16

itself with respect to the first House of Representatives.

17

What we are talking about here today, though, is

18

an effort to, an effort to produce extremely conscientious

Can I ask you a

question about the standing issue? I know that you in your

Franklin has decided it, because four justices thought

that there was standing on one basis, and four thought

accept the import, not only of the Franklin and the other

decision that we referred to, but also if this Court

decides that the process was unconstitutional or

inconsistent with the statute, the President will accept

and the next President tells his Solicitor General, I will

not accept it, then we come out differently.

GENERAL OLSON:

Well, if, for that reason, if

4

Mr. Chief Justice, the Court decides that that is not the

kind of result that this Court can issue, because of that

6

possibility, we'll accept that result as well.

7

(Laughter.)

8

GENERAL OLSON:

9

But we think -- we think it

is very unlikely for that to occur, because it is quite

10

clear that the Constitution intended to give considerable

11

flexibility, did not want to freeze in a system the

12

ability of the Government.

QUESTION:

Mr. Olson, you are saying we can

presume the President will obey the law?

GENERAL OLSON:

Yes, Justice Stevens.

What happens after that? He transmits

19

yet?

20

GENERAL OLSON:

I'm not sure of the answer to

that question.

no.

QUESTION:

GENERAL OLSON:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

7

There is no evidence that the framers of the Constitution

8

wanted to bind themselves to a particular method of

9

counting people.

All of the evidence suggested that what

10

the framers wanted to do was to have a reasonably reliable

11

accurate, reasonably accurate count of the citizens in the

12

manner that the, that Congress would determine.

13

in the words of this Court has delegated all of that broad

14

authority to the Census Bureau.

Congress

The Census Bureau, conscientiously using a

16

technique that they have been using consistently for 50

17

years with the awareness of Congress, the General

18

Accounting Office, oversight committees and the actual

19

awareness of this Court, as reflected in this 1996

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS R. LEE

3

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS.

4

MR. LEE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

I have

5

just two or three quick points.

6

briefly the record on an important issue.

7

respect to the Solicitor General, the record does not

8

indicate that the majority of the imputations here were in

9

units known to be occupied.

10

The first is to clarify
With all due

The Bureau's memo at page 445 of the joint

11

appendix indicates that fully 69 percent of the units

12

subjected to imputation were the kinds of units that

13

Justice O'Connor's questions directed us to be concerned

14

about, units where after as many as six visits, census

15

enumerators were not able to determine whether the unit in

16

question was a valid occupied housing unit and not a

17

duplicate, not a seasonal home, not a home that happens

18

not to be occupied.

19

Second, I would point the Court to another

20

unanimous decision that this Court has handed down with

21

regard to the census, and it's the Montana decision, and

22

I'd like to read a brief quote from Montana and explain

23

how important I think it is here.

I'd like to just close by saying a few brief

11

words about the constitutional question here.

12

Justice, to go back to your question about the word

actual.

14

because it's not just that the word enumeration is defined

15

to mean an actual count and not an estimate.

16

this was a term of art.

17

was used consistently in the founding era, both in

18

colonial assessments of population when they reported

19

their populations to boards of trade, and also in Great

20

Britain throughout the 18th century.

Not only that, but the framers of the

James Madison said not only is it permanent and fixed, it
