ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL PETITIONERS

9
10
11

MR. FELDMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Confronted with the problem, an undisputed

12

problem, of severe violence and drug crimes and other

13

crimes in public housing, Congress enacted the statute at

14

issue in this case.

15

housing leases must provide that any drug-related criminal

16

activity engaged in by a public housing tenant, any member

17

of the tenant's household, or any guest or other person

18

under the tenant's control shall be cause for termination

19

of tenancy.

20

household may possess and occupy Government property,

21

property that is largely financed by the Federal

22

Government.

The statute provides that public

It sets forth the conditions by which the

23

HUD has construed that statute, in accordance

24

with its terms, to authorize termination of the tenancy

25

when the drug-related criminal activity by one of the

4
Alderson Reporting Company

1

named persons occurs without regard to the tenant's

2

knowledge or control.

3

QUESTION:

Do you have any question about the

4

respondent's standing to contest the provisions that -- of

5

a lease that's made between HUD and the housing --

6

MR. FELDMAN:

The -- what happened in the

7

district court in this case, if I can just answer it this

8

way, is there was a -- we suggested that the court should

9

abstain, and this whole thing should be litigated in the

10

local courts in the unlawful detainer action.

11

refused to do so on the ground that this was in part an

12

administrative procedure action against HUD and that HUD

13

wouldn't have been a party in the local court.

14

wasn't raised further on appeal and we didn't raise it in

15

our petition for cert.

16
17

The court

That issue

I'm not sure if that answers the question or
not, but -- in any --

18

QUESTION:

Is the -- is the issue jurisdiction?

19

MR. FELDMAN:

No, I don't -- I don't think it is

20

jurisdictional.

21

cause of action under the APA, for example, is not -- is

22

not a jurisdictional issue, nor is abstention.

23

The question about whether there's a

Anyway, HUD has construed the statute in

24

accordance with its terms, to authorize termination of the

25

tenancy when there's drug-related criminal activity

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

regardless of the tenant's knowledge or control.

2

court of appeals read into the statute a limitation that

3

is nowhere expressed or implied with any of the words that

4

Congress used, that a tenancy may only be terminated when

5

the tenant knew or had reason to know of the drug-related

6

criminal activity.

7

The question --

MR. FELDMAN:

Yes.

But there's no -- but this

13

contracts historically has been that contractual terms can

14

be violated without regard to any inquiry into the state

of mind of the contracting parties.

It's a civil contract.

MR. FELDMAN:

I'm not sure -- well, under

20

21

Federal knowledge -- ignorant owner defense under the

22

Federal forfeiture statute.

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. FELDMAN:

25

There is now generally a

Was that -State -- in the United States --

in Bennis against Michigan, I don't think there was such a

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

-- there was such a provision.

2

But I think the key point is this is completely

3

different from forfeiture.

Forfeiture involves someone

4

who has a property interest that the Government had -- has

5

nothing to do with and the Government is given the right

6

to take that property interest.

7

tenants never had a property interest in occupancy of

8

their -- of their apartment in violation of the lease.

9

And this is a case in which the Government is saying this

This is a case where the

10

is our property and we're going to let you use it under

11

certain -- use and occupy it under certain circumstances.
QUESTION:

12

Is it your position that the

13

Government can place any terms and conditions whatever on

14

leases as long as it doesn't violate some other

15

constitutional provision like the First Amendment?

16

MR. FELDMAN:

17

QUESTION:

Yes, I think that is our position.

And so this is a condition that the

18

Government has the right to impose.

19

position?

20

MR. FELDMAN:

21

QUESTION:

22
23

That's right.

Is that your basic

And --

Then you don't need reliance on

Bennis at all.
MR. FELDMAN:

No, no.

Our position is this is

24

fundamentally different from forfeiture.

Forfeiture

25

involves tens of millions of leasehold and fee interests

QUESTION:

It's

This is the Government's

It is saying, you can use the

I guess I'm still -- I guess I'm

11

still puzzled by why a tenant can sign a lease and then

12

challenge it.

13

that Federal law that binds the housing authority is

14

somehow invalid?

15

if the housing authority agrees?

16

MR. FELDMAN:

I mean, what's the -- is -- is he saying

And how does he have standing to do that

I think that the tenant's position

17

-- I suppose the tenant -- you'd have to ask my opponent,

18

but I think the tenant's position here is that this lease

19

provision which embodies the -- the HUD rule of -- the

20

rule that Congress enacted concerning that there was no

21

innocent owner defense, that that is itself not authorized

22

by Federal law or not permitted by Federal law and

23

therefore was an invalid condition.

24

what their position is.

25

QUESTION:

I assume that that's

The position of the Government in --

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

in saying that any misuse by any guest, whether on or off

2

the premises, will result in a forfeiture does seem to

3

operate in a rather draconian fashion in some of the

4

examples we've been given in the briefs.

5

why the Government wants to take such a -- an extreme

6

position even though it lawfully could.

7

MR. FELDMAN:

And one wonders

I think most -- I would say that

8

most of the examples that are given in -- that are given

9

in the amicus briefs supporting respondent are ones that

10

are based on third-hand hearsay, and I'm not sure that

11

they're accurate accounts of those events, but -QUESTION:

12
13

Well, but if they are, they sound

pretty draconian.
MR. FELDMAN:

14

I think the underlying point is

15

that Congress was facing a very serious problem, and it

16

had essentially three choices.

17

going to have a Federal zero tolerance policy and that's

18

all.

19

public housing authorities with this tool, a contractual

20

provision that permits them to get people out when there's

21

a serious problem or -- or when -- when it's necessary to

22

ensure the peaceful enjoyment of the premises by the other

23

tenant.

24

circumstances you can and can't evict, and then left it up

25

to the -- it would be leave -- left up to the courts to

It could have said, we are

It could have done what it did, which is vest local

Or it could have adopted a code of under what

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

see whether the particular facts satisfy that code or

2

don't satisfy that code.

3

I think Congress took the only course that was

4

workable.

If they -- if Congress had gone farther and if

5

Congress had enacted the statute that the court of appeals

6

thinks it enacted, then it would not be much of a tool for

7

public housing authorities because in each case, the

8

question, for example, of the tenant's knowledge would be

9

litigated.

The tenant would likely deny knowledge.

10

household members would deny knowledge.

11

wouldn't -QUESTION:

12

The

The whole thing

Mr. Feldman, how can you say that's

13

so when the district court -- the injunction was he's

14

drawing a line between on premises and off premises.

15

the injunction doesn't cover anything that happens on the

16

premises.

17

So, it's only the cases where the third person does a drug

18

deal or whatever off premises.

19

parking lot, another case in a bar.

20

the premises, there is no case being made.

21

nobody is saying that -- at least as I understand it, that

22

the district judge didn't go far enough.

23

And

As far as that's concerned, the eviction holds.

MR. FELDMAN:

And we had one case in the
But as far as inside
There's --

That -- that's correct.

But the

24

problem is that in fact drug-related criminal activity

25

that occurs, for example, in the parking lot of a housing

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

project can be more threatening to the peaceful enjoyment

2

of the premises by the other tenants than what would --

3

might occur in the apartment.

4

that occurs nearby.

5

And the same with conduct

I think the point is that Congress was faced

6

with it and public housing authorities were faced with the

7

problem of very serious violence that the court of appeals

8

said that public housing projects in many areas had become

9

war zones and drug markets.

And they wanted a -- a

10

practical, effective way to be sure that public housing

11

authorities can take those households that are causing the

12

problem and remove them and replace them with other

13

households of the many, many households who are on the

14

waiting list and who wouldn't cause the problems.

15
16

QUESTION:

But you say this is -- a housing

authority may not must.

17

MR. FELDMAN:

18

QUESTION:

That's correct.

And I think in your brief, as well as

19

in Judge O'Scannlain's opinion for the original panel,

20

there was a suggestion that the housing authority should

21

be equitable in the way it administers it, that it

22

shouldn't evict every time it theoretically could.

23

question to you is, in recommending that kind of equitable

24

discretion to be exercised, do you envision that to be an

25

unreviewable discretion or would there be court review of

And my

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the housing authority's determination, say, in these cases

2

not to exercise equitable discretion?

3

MR. FELDMAN:

I don't think there would be

4

because I think Congress -- the way the scheme works is

5

this is a provision in a lease which is a sort of

6

contract.

7

contracting party may enforce its lease -- its lease

8

provisions -- Congress was surely aware of that -- when it

9

wants.

And there is -- the law of contracts is that a

And ordinarily whether it's a Federal contract, a

10

government contract, or a private contract, the court

11

doesn't inquire into what are the reasons why you're

12

enforcing your -- your lease provision here.

13

inquire -- or your contractual provision.

14

inquire has the contract been breached or has it not been

15

breached.

16

workable way for this scheme to work.

They just

They just

And I think again that that was the only

17

Now, in some instances, there may be a public

18

housing authority faced with some of the really extreme

19

conditions that came out in congressional hearings and

20

that are discussed throughout the papers here that may

21

decide that a zero tolerance policy is the only way to

22

assure that this -- the drugs are going to be cleaned out

23

of the housing unit and that the housing -- the households

24

that are causing the problem are going to be replaced with

25

some of the other ones on the waiting list that won't

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

cause the problem.

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. FELDMAN:

4

Do I understand -There -- there might be other

cases where that's not appropriate.

5

QUESTION:

But you did take the position that

6

here and now with this, that the housing authority should

7

not evict automatically, that they should do it on a case-

8

by-case basis.

9

Or am I wrong in saying --

MR. FELDMAN:

I think what -- well, you know, I

10

hesitate to say yes to that because I think what -- our

11

position is that the housing authority has the discretion

12

to enforce these provisions or not, and there may be cases

13

where zero tolerance policy is necessary or required, in

14

which case that's what they should do.
QUESTION:

15

But the discretion is unreviewable

16

and in the -- in the final analysis, as I understand your

17

argument, it doesn't have to exercise any discretion at

18

all.

19
20
21

It can zero tolerance across the board.
MR. FELDMAN:

They -- it could say zero

tolerance across the board.
QUESTION:

And if -- if you say it's reviewable

22

by the courts, talk about an unworkable system.

23

would be it.

24
25

MR. FELDMAN:

That

That's correct because you -- with

respect to the particular issue of knowledge that's at

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

issue here, as I said, it's going to be very hard for a

2

housing authority, which is not a criminal prosecution

3

agency -- they're in the business of running housing --

4

housing developments, not prosecuting crimes -- to prove

5

who had exactly what state of mind or who had what level

6

of control.

7

Indeed, both respondents in the court of appeals

8

suggest that if the tenant -- even if the tenant knew, if

9

the tenant couldn't control the drug-related activity,

10

that that would also be a defense.

11

some cases, allow exactly the families and the households

12

that are causing the biggest problem for the -- for their

13

-- for their neighbors and for the truly innocent tenants

14

to remain, and there would be nothing the public housing

15

authority could do.

16

Well, that would, in

But I think, in general, what Congress wanted

17

was to give public housing authorities a tool that would

18

be actually useful in remedying the very serious problem

19

of not only drug -- drug-related criminal activity but

20

other criminal activity in public housing units.

21

The underlying principle really is one of

22

household-wide responsibility.

No one -- no one suggests

23

that if the -- everybody agrees, let me put it that way,

24

that if the tenant is -- engages in drug-related criminal

25

activity, that the whole household can be removed from the

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

unit.

But in a very real sense, although the legal

2

relationship is between the housing authority and the

3

tenant, the practical relationship is they're giving that

4

whole household the right to occupy the Government

5

premises.

6

in that household has used -- has engaged in criminal

7

drug-related activity, that person is liable to be removed

8

from the tenancy because it -- that person violated a

9

lease term.

10

And it's just the very same rule.

QUESTION:

It's whoever

Mr. Feldman, how do you answer that

11

the statute doesn't say anything about the duration of

12

time or the place?

13

let's say the grandson could have dealt with drugs 5 years

14

ago or could have done it in L.A. and this housing project

15

is in Massachusetts.

I mean, the hypothetical that the --

MR. FELDMAN:

16

In terms of time, I think that

17

there -- generally the statute doesn't say anything about

18

time, and I think it would be open to HUD to fill in a --

19

in a gap, although certainly a very broad period of time

20

would be -- would be suggested.

21

short --

22
23
24
25

QUESTION:

It wouldn't be a very

But you're saying the part of the

unreviewable discretion is it could be 5 years ago.
MR. FELDMAN:

That's -- that's correct, but that

-- that -- it was not -- the issue of time and place --

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

and let me say place is addressed in the statute because

2

Congress -- originally it said on or near, and Congress

3

amended in 1996 to say on or off.

4

know is that place is not something that was relevant.

5

So, the one thing we do

And again -- actually if I can turn to place for

6

a second, you could have a drug crime that occurs 3,000

7

miles away, and ordinarily -- and I think it would never

8

be -- I don't know of any case where anyone has been tried

9

to be evicted.

It's a very theoretical possibility that

10

anybody would be.

11

was trying to import drugs and bring them to that person's

12

unit in the housing complex, it would be highly relevant.

13

And what Congress intended was that public housing

14

authorities have the tool to take care of the problems

15

that they saw.

16

are engaged in drug crimes 3,000 miles away or 20 years

17

before.

18

But if that crime was that that person

They're not evicting people who are -- who

Respondents rely and the court of appeals relied

19

on the forfeiture provision.

I've already said that the

20

forfeiture raises a completely different issue.

21

fact that -- it is true that Congress added leasehold

22

interest to the forfeiture statute in it -- when it --

23

when it rewrote this statute in 1990, although it didn't

24

substantively change the terms of the statute.

25

think the -- it's very express innocent owner defense

And the

But I

16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that's in the lease -- in the forfeiture statute contrasts

2

very sharply with the absence of not only any such defense

3

but even any word that suggests such a defense in this

4

statute.

5

The doctrine of in pari materia, which they

6

appeal to, can sometimes be used where you have a

7

particular term in a statute that in a closely related

8

statute is either defined or, by context, has a very clear

9

meaning and the same meaning then is -- is imported.

10

quite a different thing here where -- this is a -- the

11

forfeiture statute is entirely different from --

12
13

QUESTION:

It's

Well, it runs up against expressio

unius too, doesn't it --

14

MR. FELDMAN:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. FELDMAN:

Right.

-- as a -Right, and -- and I think in this

17

case where there's no word in this statute that requires

18

that -- that requires interpretation and the context that

19

you're trying to take the meaning from is quite a -- an

20

entirely different context, I don't think that that in

21

pari materia is soundly applied.

22

the contrast between the statutes clearly points out

23

Congress' -- what Congress intended.

In fact, I think just

24

The -- the -- you know, I'd add that this --

25

this -- the rationale of this statute ensures not only

17
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that there's the maximum incentive for tenants in public

2

housing to ensure that their household members and they

3

themselves are not engaged in drug-related activity and to

4

find out about that activity rather than remaining

5

ignorant, but in the end, it ensures that households in

6

Government subsidized housing who are a threat to their

7

neighbors or who may be a threat to their neighbors in the

8

view of the public housing authority, that they are

9

removed and that -- and replaced with others of the many

10

families who are on the list who would not pose such a

11

threat.

12

Finally, the court of appeals also relied on the

13

doctrine of constitutional avoidance, but this statute is

14

clear and there's no warrant for applying that doctrine.

15

And in any event, there isn't any serious constitutional

16

problem with interpreting it as HUD has.

17

tenants have a property interest in their lease, that is

18

-- that entitles them to the right to the full procedural

19

due process protections before the lease is terminated,

lease are.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GARY T. LAFAYETTE

11

ON BEHALF OF THE PRIVATE PETITIONERS

12

14

MR. LAFAYETTE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In response to Congress' enactment of

15

1437d(l)(6) and HUD's regulations, the Oakland Housing

16

Authority revised its lease to properly reflect the

17

changes that had taken place with regard to the HUD

18

regulations.

19

instances.

20

revised the occupants' responsibility statement, and then

21

it revised what is known as the tenant agreement to

22

maintain a drug-free environment.

23

And it specifically did that in three
It revised the lease at paragraph 9(m) and it

In each instance, it -- it advised each tenant

24

and requested each tenant to sign a statement

25

acknowledging that they clearly understood that if this

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

type of conduct took place within their apartment or off

2

housing authority property, that they could be subjected

3

to a lease cancellation.

4

In this case, we came forward with four

5

individuals whose leases were canceled because of this

6

particular type of activity.

7

position is it was necessary for it to take the action

8

with regard to each one of these particular individuals

9

because of the conduct that they were participating in or

And the housing authority's

10

the conduct of individuals in their households were

11

participating in, which conduct which posed a significant

12

risk of injury to other members of the housing authority

13

and to the community in which these particular

14

developments are located.
QUESTION:

15
16

Mr. Lafayette, how big a problem is

this in this housing authority?
MR. LAFAYETTE:

17

It's a -- it's a significant

18

problem.

One of the things that we've pointed out in our

19

moving -- in -- in our merits brief was that this is a

20

housing authority that has approximately 8,000 individuals

21

who are scattered in 3,308 low income to moderate income

22

housing units.

23

year, there were 700 felony arrests for drug-related

24

criminal activity in or near Oakland Housing Authority

25

property.

From 1998 until November of this past

Significantly, between January 1, 2001 and

20
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

November 6, 2001, the number of felony arrests was 250 for

2

drug-related activity.

That's a significant sum.

3

One of the things that I think is also

4

significant is that this is a housing authority that does

5

not necessarily have large housing development complexes.

6

A number of its developments are smaller units.

7

example, in the Hill and Lee cases, those are individuals

8

who resided in -- in a development that is approximately

9

eight units, eight units in a neighborhood that is

For

10

comprised almost exclusively of single family dwellings.

11

When these individuals participate in this drug activity

12

in the front of that unit, it is not only affecting the

13

members of the housing authority community itself, it is

14

affecting the general community at large and all the

15

individuals there.
And significantly we need to point out that we

16
17

responded there not because we happened to be driving by,

18

but the response was -- was premised on a complaint being

19

made.

20

happening is this housing authority is responding to

21

complaints made by residents, and one of the things that

22

we point out is this housing authority has been subjected

23

to litigation by -- being made by its residents demanding

24

that the housing authority take more affirmative action

25

and steps to address these issues of drug and drug-related

And that's part of the record.

So, what's

21
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

activity.

2

In -- it seems to me -- to me that there is no

3

issue that in each one of these particular cases there was

4

just cause for the housing authority to go forward and --

5

and to exercise this discretion reasonably and that it did

6

so.

7

the question of whether or not it is exercising

8

discretion, and we always point the Court to the case of

9

Pearlie Rucker because that's a case where the housing

10

authority initially proceeded with termination of that

11

lease and, in the process of doing so, came to understand

12

that the individual in the household who was participating

13

in the drug activity, Gelinda Rucker, was a person who had

14

actually become incarcerated and therefore no longer posed

15

a risk of injury to the remainder of the housing authority

16

or the community.

17

point discontinued its efforts to dismiss that -- to

18

terminate that lease.

19

actually filed, there was no longer a pending dispute

20

between the housing authority and Pearlie Rucker who was

21

the -- who was the tenant responsible for that lease.

22

And one of the things that -- that seems to appear is

QUESTION:

Realizing that, the agency at that

And at the time this lawsuit was

But that was not required of the

23

housing authority, and if they had gone and said, well, we

24

don't care that circumstances have changed, out you go,

25

that would be unreviewable.

22
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. LAFAYETTE:

That would be unreviewable.

And

2

the reason for that is the housing authority needs the

3

discretion to act where it believes it is necessary for it

4

to act.

5

authority has come forward with that position.

6

without that discretion, a housing authority would be

7

strapped to look for and to document events that require

8

it to move or compel it to move or would set some -- would

9

meet someone else's satisfaction of when it should move.

10

And those things may not be present from the information

11

that it might have before it.

And in each one of these instances, this housing
And

The -- and one of the things we think that --

12
13

that Congress recognized, that housing authorities are not

14

as well equipped as are the Federal Government in order to

15

respond to these types of issues, particularly with regard

16

to the loss of additional funds to cities.

17

mind, it is significant that this housing authority has

18

responded in the way that it has responded.

With that in

We -- we have -- have listened to the Solicitor

19
20

General's discussion this morning, and we are in accord

21

with regard to the position that he has taken with regard

22

to what Congress intended and how Congress went about

23

evaluating the various needs of residents of public

24

housing.

25

One of the things that I think that needs to be

23
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

clearly stated is that the housing authority itself does

2

not benefit from a statute like this because the housing

3

authority is only going to take that apartment unit and to

4

re-lease that apartment unit out to someone else who is in

5

need of low income public housing.

6

has this provision in its lease because, one, there --

7

it's required by the HUD regulations, and number two, it

8

needs to be able to provide its residents with safe and

9

decent housing, which is what this is really all about, is

10
11

The housing authority

how it goes about providing safe and decent housing.
QUESTION:

Do you take the position that you

12

could have this provision in the lease even without the

13

Federal statute?

14

MR. LAFAYETTE:

There is nothing that restrains

15

us from putting this provision in this lease before that.

16

And in fact, prior to -- though not part of the record,

17

prior to this provision being enacted by Congress, there

18

was a similar provision in the lease itself.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

8

MR. RENNE:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:

9

In this case, as we've heard in -- in the

10

argument of HUD is that HUD says, by reason of this lease

12

it is the judge and jury as to whether or not innocent

13

tenants, such as the -- the respondents who are before

the role of any landlord in a landlord-tenant situation,

does it?

purposes of the injunction, was the -- the off premises.

And I respectfully submit it's not a final judgment that

likelihood of success.

He was addressing what's the

Admittedly -- and I don't -- I think we all

8

recognize that if there's an offense on the premises, the

9

likelihood of a innocent tenant defense being successful

10

is far less, but in the case where you have someone, like

11

the three female respondents in this case who are long-

12

time tenants who have had no problems -- and certainly the

13

Oakland Housing Authority is not arguing they had problems

14

with them -- and you have a grandson who smokes cigarettes

15

in the parking lot, and HUD takes a position -- and

16

Oakland Housing Authority takes a position that we can

17

apply some kind of collective guilt because, regardless of

18

what the Government wants to say and characterize it as a

19

contract action, the end result to these three respondents

20

and the innocent -- innocent members of the household is

21

to throw them into the streets.

QUESTION:

I -- I frankly don't understand your

5

interpretation of a HUD regulation anyway.

6

7

MR. RENNE:

You just

The -- the question is -- and I

8

think the contract question is way circular, that if -- if

9

Congress did not mandate that it's an automatic eviction

10

with no opportunity to present any kind of a defense, if

11

Congress didn't mandate it, the fact that it's in the

12

lease doesn't change it.

13

question is did section 1437d(l)(6) -- did it mandate?

14

And it would be the only section of the lease.

15

QUESTION:

You still have to get to -- the

Well, but I'm not sure you're correct

16

in your argument there, Mr. Renne, because perhaps you --

17

if you had a prohibition against that sort of a thing in

18

the statute, certainly HUD would be bound by it.

19

no -- no provision one way or the other, certainly that's

20

something that HUD is entitled to interpret, and it has

21

interpreted it by its regulations.

22

MR. RENNE:

But with

The -- but it's also, in its

23

regulations, said that the tenant has a right in the

24

eviction court to present equitable and legal defenses.

25

QUESTION:

But as Justice O'Connor said, you

Alderson Reporting Company

1

never let it get to the eviction court.

The -- it wasn't

2

litigated as to whether the lease should be revoked or

3

not.

4

to put this provision in its lease.

All that was litigated was whether HUD had a right

5

MR. RENNE:

I respectfully submit, Mr. Chief

6

Justice, that is not what they litigated.

They litigated

7

that they did not have a right to terminate -- to

8

terminate an innocent tenant, not to put that in their

9

lease.

That -- there's nobody saying that they can't put

10

the provision in their lease.

11

and nobody is disputing that there is a serious problem of

12

drugs in public housing, and we aren't -- we aren't

13

suggesting anything to the contrary.

14

the respondents and the way they're being treated by the

15

Oakland Housing Authority are making them victims as well.
QUESTION:

16

The question is -- and --

But I suggest that

Well, but they're being treated in

17

accordance with the provisions of their lease.

And you

18

ordinarily can't come into a court and say, gee, you know,

19

you're putting these tenants out on the street if in fact

20

they've breached their lease in a way that permits the

21

landlord to do that.

22

MR. RENNE:

But again, with all due respect,

23

that's assuming the answer, and that is that the lease

24

does say that you can't present an innocent tenant

25

defense.

And again I go back to --

QUESTION:

Well, that's a different -- now that

2

Ninth -- that's -- finally you're talking about something

3

the Ninth Circuit talked about, and it seems to me that

that's just absolutely dead wrong.

6

kind, which makes it crystal clear that there is no

innocent defense.

MR. RENNE:

that the tenant has any choice in a public housing

situation in which the -- the only choice of housing they

11

have is public housing, to say that somehow or other they

12

have agreed to a provision which Congress didn't require.
QUESTION:

13

Well, but -- but now -- now you're

14

skating away from the point where we were finally at

issue.

16

but now your answer is, well, even if it did, it

shouldn't.

responsive to my point.

19

You said the lease doesn't provide this, and --

I mean, that's just -- that's just not

MR. RENNE:

My -- Justice Kennedy, what I was

20

saying is that section 1437 of the -- of the statute

21

didn't require the language that they are putting in.

22

QUESTION:

But under -- under your theory, you

23

have to show not just that it didn't require it, but that

HUD could not, as an administrative agency, interpret it

25

to allow that.

MR. RENNE:

2

QUESTION:

And I believe -It seems to me your argument -- when

3

-- when you have to argue that point, the argument, as I

4

regard the Ninth Circuit opinion, is just extremely weak.

5

MR. RENNE:

I address that in three ways.

One

6

is that I believe that when you look at the circumstances

7

under which that section was passed in conjunction with

8

881, the forfeiture statute, you look at the -- what

9

little comments were made by any committees that were

10

addressing it, and when you look at the alleged rationale,

11

none of them support HUD.

12

accept HUD's interpretation, we respectfully submit that

13

it raises serious constitutional issues.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. RENNE:

But even more basic, if you

And precisely what are those issues?
The due process issues, Your Honor,

16

in that what they are threatening to do is to attach

17

punishment and collective guilt, and in American

18

jurisprudence, we always put individual --

19

QUESTION:

If you're -- you're saying if you're

20

-- if you're evicted from a tenant -- as a tenant from a

21

public housing, you are, A, punished, and B, you're found

22

collectively guilty?

23

MR. RENNE:

You are certainly being punished,

24

and Rucker being thrown out in the street is certainly

25

being punished.

proceeding in the country punishes the tenant.

supposedly violated and the eviction court has found,

based upon all the evidence that it hears, that eviction

is appropriate.

QUESTION:

Well, we're just going in circles,

QUESTION:

You -- as I understand the provision

Mr. --

11

that you object to, it -- it says, in effect, the -- the

12

tenant who signs the lease is going to be the guarantor

13

that there will be no drug activity in the apartment or by

14

other people who are -- are inhabitants or even people who

15

come to the apartment, going to be a guarantor.

16

saying that that kind of a guarantee provision is simply

17

forbidden by the Constitution?

18

MR. RENNE:

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. RENNE:

Are you

Under these circumstances, yes.
Why?
In -- for the same reason that I

21

believe this Court has at least indicated in -- in dicta,

22

that when you are essentially seizing what is property,

23

particularly somebody's home, you must afford them due

24

process including --

25

QUESTION:

Well, we're -- now, you're talking

40
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

about procedural due process, and there's no claim here,

2

as I understand it, that the tenants were denied

3

procedural due process.

4

that substantive due process forbids this kind of a

5

guarantee provision, and when I say why, I'm asking you

6

why substantively does due process forbid.

7

MR. RENNE:

I understand your argument to be

And substantively is that you are --

8

you are punishing without any guilt and without allowing

9

the tenant to establish that he or she is innocent.

MR. RENNE:

QUESTION:

17

MR. RENNE:

18

QUESTION:

In the public housing situation.
Is that your position?
That is correct.
Then you're challenging something

19

that you have, as I see it, no standing to raise in this

20

Court because I looked back at the district court's

21

opinion, and what it said as to conduct occurring in the

22

tenant's union -- unit -- it didn't say, well, we just

23

won't extend it preliminarily.

24

such circumstances appears rationally related to a

25

legitimate public housing goal and constitutional.

It said, eviction under

It was

Alderson Reporting Company

1

a ruling on the merits that as far as the in premises

2

setting is concerned, it was constitutional.

3

arguing that that's not the case, and I don't see how you

4

can argue that when you haven't filed any cross appeal

5

ever.

6

MR. RENNE:

And you're

Well, with all due respect, Justice

7

Ginsburg, the cases in this Court have said that

8

respondents are entitled to rely on anything that would

9

affirm the judgment below.

10
11

QUESTION:

But the judgment below that's being

affirmed deals only with off premises.
MR. RENNE:

12

It's the Ninth Circuit judgment that

13

is being attacked, and the Ninth Circuit does not limit

14

itself in terms of the arguments that it raises and it --

15

conclusions it reached -QUESTION:

16

Are you not making a distinction

17

between a judgment and an opinion?

18

affirmed was the judgment of the district court.
MR. RENNE:

19
20

I mean, what was

What was affirmed was the

preliminary injunction.
QUESTION:

21

Yes, and that preliminary injunction

22

was only with respect to off premises activity, and that's

23

all that the Ninth Circuit affirmed.
MR. RENNE:

24
25

Yes, I don't disagree with that at

all.

42
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

But the rationale of the Ninth Circuit opinion

2

applies with equal force because the only thing they had

3

before them is whether or not the district court had

4

abused its discretion in the grant of preliminary

5

injunction.

6

But continuing to address the -- the due process

7

is that all we are saying is that these tenants have a

8

right to establish that they should not be punished by

9

reason of somebody else's conduct without a showing --

10

QUESTION:

Well, I -- I realize that's your

11

position, but in order to maintain that position on a

12

substantive due process basis, you've got to say, I

13

suppose, that there's no reasonable relationship between

14

this kind of guarantor of conduct provision and the kind

15

of drug problem which I presume it is conceded the

16

Government can deal with.

17

a pretty obvious substantial relationship between them and

18

that's why your argument doesn't seem to have any sort of

19

intuitive plausibility to it.

MR. RENNE:

And it seems to me that there's

Can you address that?

Well, I don't think that -- when you

21

say it seems to be obvious, with all due respect again, I

22

would say they talk about deterrent.

23

Ms. Pearlie Rucker who took steps to assure that there

what the problems were, and as far as she knew, knew

Under the lease she assured the housing

saying she was blameless.

12

blameless, but she didn't do what she had committed to do,

caused that place to be a drug area.

that, saying we're going to let you in here if you assure

us that no one who resides in the -- in the premises that

18

we're giving you under this program will be the source of

19

a drug problem.

20

What's unconstitutional about that?

MR. RENNE:

I suggest that we took -- we take --

21

compare it to the forfeiture statute where we have

22

specifically -- Congress has mandated that in the

23

forfeiture situation where the drug offense can be -- on

24

the premises can be horrible, it can be a very serious

25

drug offense, and they cannot forfeit the tenancy.

that it's being used.

this is a good deal less because it's not even her

Why is this any different?

In fact,

It is a condition of giving her this benefit.
MR. RENNE:

That's not

And so, you're not talking

Well, 881 talks specifically about

public housing leases as being subject to forfeiture.

14

you are -- in those contexts you're talking about the

identical situation that under the forfeiture statute

to come in here and we don't have to show she knew

of a drug problem in the facility.

MR. RENNE:

evicted by reason of the fact that they're subject to

It relates to

And as the amicus briefs point out,

10

spousal abuse which violates the criminal law.

11

all we're saying is they have to have a chance to go to

12

the eviction court and present that to the eviction court

13

so that the eviction court has a right to deal with

14

whether or not there is good cause.

15

And -- and

And it's interesting in the -- in the statute

Good cause is the thing the eviction court

I'm suggesting that if -- if what HUD wants is

The question of -- as to the relationship of --

22

of Federal law and the -- the Federal law that waives --

23

that permits HUD to waive the grievance procedure in the

24

housing authority and say you can just go to the eviction

25

court -- and that law does provide that HUD has to -- it

49
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

can only permit that if it can ensure -- assure that the

2

eviction court gives you full due process rights to

3

litigate whatever issues there are.

4

Federal law does guarantee you the right to have all of

5

your defenses litigated in the eviction proceeding if HUD

6

is going to grant such a waiver, which it's done in 47

7

States.

8
9
10

QUESTION:

And in that sense,

And the eviction proceeding is in the

State court?
MR. FELDMAN:

Yes, but what Federal law doesn't

11

do is say that there's any particular defenses.

12

question of what the defenses are that you have to have

13

the full right to litigate, that's a question of -- of

14

substantive Federal law.

15

As the

Now, in this case, the statute makes clear I

16

think that serious -- that drug-related criminal activity

17

is cause for termination of tenancy, and HUD has construed

18

it to mean that.

19

Now, the question then about -- the only

20

possible source for a defense would be State law, and the

21

question about for State law defense would be does that

22

conflict with either the Federal statute or the purposes

23

Congress was trying to achieve.

24

for a State court to disagree with the balance that

25

Congress struck when it -- when it passed the statute.

It wouldn't be possible

50
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

So, the only question would be, therefore, if you have any

2

State law defenses, they would have to be ones that don't

3

conflict with the judgment that Congress made that

4

eviction under 1437d(l)(6) is for serious -- it's for drug
