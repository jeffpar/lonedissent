CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Mr. Goodman.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HAROLD I. GOODMAN

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. GOODMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

This c case brings up for review a fairly

11

straightforward but nonetheless essential question as it

12

applies to Federal practice and procedure, namely, whether

13

or not notice pleading is sufficient with compliance with

14

Rule 8(a)(2), or whether or not the rule requires some

15

element of fact pleading to overcome a Rule 12(b)(6)

16

motion to dismiss.

17

VII national origin and an age discrimination case under

18

the ADEA.

19

Sorema, his former employer.

20

district court claiming that that firing was based upon

21

his national origin -- he's Hungarian -- and his age.

22

was about 51 at the time.

23

It arises in the context of a title

Mr. Swierkiewicz was fired from his job by
He brought suit in the

He

He pled that there was no valid reason for his

24

discharge.

He pointed to the fact that he himself had

25

incurred a history over 2 years of discrimination based on

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

his national origin and his age, coming from 1995, when he

2

was demoted from his position as chief underwriting

3

officer, through and including two successive years where

4

he was the victim of continuous discrimination by being

5

excluded from meetings, business decisions, and isolated

6

and denied any career growth.

7

The Second Circuit, affirming the Southern

8

District of New York, concluded that conclusory

9

allegations of discrimination, what it referred to as

10

naked allegations, were insufficient.

11

be proved, proved via a complaint, because it adopted as a

12

pleading standard this Court's elements of a prima facie

13

case in McDonnell Douglas v. Green.

14
15

QUESTION:

Some facts had to

You don't deny that some facts have

to be stated, do you?

16

MR. GOODMAN:

17

QUESTION:

I do not.

I mean, can I come in just with a

18

complaint that says, I have been unlawfully discriminated

19

against by my employer, who is -- and I name the employer.

20

MR. GOODMAN:

I think if you did not identify

21

the adverse action, there would not be sufficient

22

information alleged to be able to sustain a motion for

23

dismissal.

However, even in that --

24

QUESTION:

That was contained here?

25

MR. GOODMAN:

They --

Absolutely.

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

You would have to also allege,

2

wouldn't you, that you were discriminated against because

3

of your race, or because of your nationality?

4

MR. GOODMAN:

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. GOODMAN:

Absolutely.

And you again say that was done here.
Five times in the complaint.

Five

7

times, so that while I absolutely agree that sufficient

8

information must be pled, a) to put a defendant on notice,

9

what is this claim all about, so I can begin the

10

investigative work of defending it and responding via a

11

responsive pleading, and ultimately so that the case can

12

have res judicata effect so that we know what the claim is

13

that normally, as this Court's precedents unanimously and

14

consistently have said, notice pleading, and more

15

particularly, simplified notice pleading is more than

16

enough.

17

So we contrast what the Second Circuit did with

18

three critical barometers.

The first and most critical

19

are these Court's precedents, starting, of course, with

20

Conley in 1957, a case brought under the Railway Labor Act

21

claiming that the union did not fairly represent the

22

interests of African American conductors and porters.

23

Justice Black, writing for the Court, said, the

24

allegations were entirely general, but in response to the

25

union's argument that more specificity, some specificity

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

As

1

had to be alleged, the Court wrote, the law requires

2

unions to represent minorities on the same basis as

3

nonminorities.

4

That --

QUESTION:

Mr. Goodman, why do you start with

5

Conley v. Gibson rather than Dioguardi v. Durning.

6

thought that was always the classic.

7

MR. GOODMAN:

I

Dioguardi is my favorite case,

8

simply because it has been authored by then Judge and

9

later Chief Judge Clark, who was the reporter for this

10

Court's advisory committee.

11

the argument the Government made in opposition to the

12

complaint, which was a pro se complaint, was simply that

13

some facts had to be alleged to support the plaintiff's

14

claims that the Government a) had undersold his medicinal

15

tonic, and b) had lost two cases of his medicinal tonic,

16

to which Judge Clark said, no, the time for ascertaining

17

the facts under the new Federal system, then 6 years old,

18

was through discovery, and if the case was nonmeritorious,

19

through summary judgment, but it's enough that this pro se

20

litigant simply said, you deprived me of my goods, you

21

undersold my property.

22

indeed, in Conley -QUESTION:

23

It was decided in 1944, and

That is the leading case and,

That's the leading case?

I would

24

think you might say a case from this Court were a leading

25

case --

1

MR. GOODMAN:

2

QUESTION:

3

Well --

-- as opposed to one from the Second

Circuit.

4

(Laughter.)

5

MR. GOODMAN:

I do, indeed.

I do, indeed, and

6

that's why I started with Conley, but it is interesting

7

and, I think, prophetic, that footnote 5 of Conley cites

8

Dioguardi with approval.

9

Now, in Conley the Court rebuffed unanimously

10

the claim that some specificity had to be embossed upon

11

the complaint.

12

unanimous court then through Chief Justice Burger rebuffed

13

claims by Ohio that the National Guard and the Governor of

14

Ohio, who were defendants, were sued on a 1983 damage

15

claim with only the bare allegation that the National

16

Guard had done wrong and was responsible for the deaths of

17

the plaintiffs in that case, rebuffing unanimously the

18

argument that some facts had be pled.

19

aside that holding and that case of the Sixth Circuit and,

20

indeed, said, you do not need to do it in a complaint.

21

Notice pleading, as we pointed out in Conley, is more than

22

sufficient.

Had that been the end of the trilogy, it would

25

have been enough, but, as this Court knows, just 9 years

1

ago, 8 years ago, in 1993 in Leatherman, again confronted

2

with a similar issue in a 1983 municipal liability case,

3

the Court had to decide whether or not some facts were

4

essential to a 1983 failure-to-train case under Canton.

5

The decision of the Sixth Circuit, which was accepted on

6

review, had said in no uncertain terms the complaint here

7

alleges no facts, none, to support the failure-to-train

8

case.

9

unanimously said no.

In response, the Court, through the Chief Justice,
We meant what we said in Conley.

10

Rule 8(a)(2) is sufficient if a plaintiff provides

11

information that puts a defendant on notice of the claims.

12

That's all that's required.
If, today, we had to revise the rules there is a

13
14

process for doing that and that might result, for 1983

15

purposes, in a revision to Rule 8(a)(2) such as that

16

9(a)(2), which now only requires particularity in cases of

17

fraud and mistake, might have a third entry for

18

particularity purposes, a 1983 action, for example, or

19

here.

20

Court's committee and its adoption of rules and those by

21

Congress, it was felt that a title VII case or an age case

22

ought to also require particularity, that would be the

23

time and that would be the place to do it.

24
25

If, upon proper review and the process of this

But I submit that there are two substantial
other reasons for reversal here, and they are bedded in

is -- you refer on page -- in paragraph 31 of the

context, I think, of this case, for two reasons.

11

QUESTION:

I thought it

didn't challenge the genuineness of the -- of that paper,.

15

could the judge look at it in deciding the case?

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. GOODMAN:

20
21
22
23

I think in some instances, yes,

In this instance.
Not in this, because it raises all

sorts of questions of credibility and inference.
Mr. Swierkiewicz, for example, referred to a
hostile work environment.

resolve all instances in favor of the plaintiff.

that's referred to in the complaint and ruling on the

3

sufficiency of the complaint?

4

MR. GOODMAN:

I think so.

I think so.

I think

it depends, though, on the substance of the document.

I'm

assuming that authenticity, for example, is not in

9

plaintiff and not to the defendant.

I'm assuming that all inferences in the document

Assuming that, and

10

also assuming that the underlying document is essential to

11

the case, then, I think, under the case law it may be

12

considered by the district court.

13
14
15
16
17

QUESTION:

Well, it must be essential, if you

refer to it in your complaint.
MR. GOODMAN:

Yes.

That's why I answered the

question yes.
QUESTION:

In the Rule 16 conference can the

18

judge say, I've looked at this pleading, and it passes

19

under the Federal rule, but I think discovery would be

20

expedited if you made it much, much more complete.

21

to file an amended complaint setting forth the allegations

22

and the reasons for your injury in much more detail.

23

he do that?

24
25

MR. GOODMAN:

I want

Can

I think it is permissible, but

largely an abuse of discretion if the court has stated,

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

which was implicit or explicit, Justice Kennedy, in your

2

question, that the complaint satisfies Rule 8(a)(2).

3

the complaint were deemed so vague and ambiguous, to quote

4

precisely rule 12(e), a defendant could make that motion

5

to flush out much more factual, or more information, or

6

regarding either liability or damages, but I would say

7

except in the most egregious case a sua sponte direction

8

by a district court who has said, it is my view that your

9

complaint satisfies 8(a)(2), it would be precisely what

If

10

Rule 8(a)(2) and the simplified notice pleading

11

requirements were intended to avoid, which was a lot of

12

litigation up front to avoid a disposition on the merits.
QUESTION:

13

So then the other option is for the

14

judge to allow discovery to go forward but on a limited

15

basis and keep control of it that way?
MR. GOODMAN:

16

Absolutely and, of course, the

17

revisions to the rules, both in terms, for example, of the

18

number of interrogatories, the number of depositions, have

19

gone a considerable way towards that effect in any event,

20

but the district court has considerable latitude to add to

21

that.

22

QUESTION:

Mr. Goodman, I think this case in a

23

way puts notice pleading to the test.

In the form

24

complaint that you referred to involving an automobile

25

accident, you know, ordinarily automobile accidents don't

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

happen unless there's been some negligence on the part of

2

one party or the other, but you get hit with a car, and

3

you know, have reason to suspect there was some

4

negligence.

5

But people are fired, people are not promoted

6

all the time, without any necessary implication of

7

wrongdoing, and something seems wrong that when you're

8

dismissed you can say, I was dismissed because I'm a

9

Hungarian, without having any evidence whatever, and can

10

bring a complaint and then use the courts essentially as

11

an investigatory arm to find out whether you indeed do

12

have any basis for complaining.

13

MR. GOODMAN:

I think it just seems --

I think there are two responses to

14

that.

15

bought in bad faith, as an officer of the court the

16

plaintiff's law him or herself would be exposed to

17

damages, so there's got to be some sort of good faith at

18

the outset in making that kind of allegation.

19

First of all, if the complaint is frivolous or

QUESTION:

So the lawyer must know something

20

more than the mere fact that I was fired, and I think I

21

was fired because I was a Hungarian.

22

lawyer has to ask the client, why do you think you were

23

fired because you were a Hungarian?

24

that was the reason?

25

MR. GOODMAN:

Presumably the

What makes you think

2

QUESTION:

And if you can tell that to the

lawyer, why can't you put it in the complaint?

3

MR. GOODMAN:

The question is whether or not you

4

must put it in the complaint, and for purposes of this

5

Court's precedents, and again I come back to Conley and

6

Scheuer and Leatherman, the only way that they must be put

7

in the case, with all due respect, is if Rule 8(a)(2) were

8

amended, or Rule 9(b) were amended, and if --

9
10

QUESTION:

You're certainly not required to

plead the evidence in support of your charge.
MR. GOODMAN:

11

Exactly, and that was my last

12

point, and I'll end with it, and that is that the decision

13

of the district court here in effect conflated elements of

14

evidence with elements of pleading.
McDonnell Douglas v. Green was a recognition of

16

what we all know to be true.

17

Hungarian, you are black, you are a woman, you are

disabled.

McDonnell Douglas did.

way, circumstantially, to come to the same result.

22

is what a plaintiff needs do to overcome summary judgment

23

or to prevail at trial.

It doesn't work that way.

That's what

might, Justice Scalia, much of that evidence is not known

As this Court has held just last term in Reeves,

6

the key to the evidence frequently is in the hands of the

defendant:

You need discovery for that.

In this case, the complaint

It was nine pages long, wasn't it?
Yes, it was.
Can you necessarily say that's a

short statement?

MR. MINEAR:

Well, obviously the length of the

2

complaint will vary on the degree of complexity of the

3

case, but I think that simply underscores the fact that

4

this complaint was more than ample in setting forth the

5

necessary elements of a complaint.

6

What's important about the complaint in this

7

case is, it did identify both the adverse action that was

8

involved and also allege that the adverse action was the

9

product of a prohibited discrimination.

That was

10

sufficient to put the employer on notice of the basis for

11

the complaint, and provided a basis for relief if proved

12

at trial.

13

The Federal rules do not require that a party

14

include additional facts that go beyond this, including

15

what the employer calls here an inference of

16

discrimination.

17

conditions of mind, for instance, can be averred

18

generally, and that includes matters such as intent and

19

motive, and the Federal rules certainly do not require

20

that the parties set forth all the elements of a prima

21

facie case under McDonnell Douglas v. Green.

22

Rule 9 makes clear that elements of

As petitioner's counsel has pointed out, that

23

ruling of the Second Circuit basically confuses the

24

requirements for pleading a complaint, and the evidentiary

25

burdens that a plaintiff would bear at trial in proving a

QUESTION:

Suppose a person simply feels -- he's

It's good.

That's it.

All right, so they

How could a judge refuse discovery on

MR. MINEAR:

Very simply, the complaint in this

20

situation presents an issue of fact.

Was there, or was

21

there not discrimination, and the Federal rules

22

contemplated the mechanism for resolving that issue was

2

How does the judge refuse discovery in my case?
MR. MINEAR:

It may be that a complete refusal

3

of discovery is not appropriate, but what's important here

4

is that Rule 16, which deals with pretrial conference,

5

coupled with Rule 26, regulating discovery, and Rule 56,

6

dealing with --

7

QUESTION:

So then, what the Second Circuit is

8

actually saying is, since the judge can't refuse discovery

9

in my case, let's go back and look and see what the cause

10

of action is, and the cause of action is such that my case

11

doesn't really fall within it.

12

figure out what they're driving at.

13

like that.

14

MR. MINEAR:

I mean, I'm trying to
It must be something

Well, I think that the problem the

15

Second Circuit discerned is, as Justice Scalia pointed

16

out, it's very easy to allege discrimination and, in fact,

17

it can sometimes be very difficult to prove it as well.

18

The Federal rules deal with the situation by providing a

19

mechanism, by providing a procedure.

20

needed to put the parties on notice of what the --

21

QUESTION:

The complaint is

Does the complaint, Mr. Minear,

22

require you under the Federal rules to put in all the

23

elements of a cause of action in order to survive a

25

MR. MINEAR:

Your Honor, no, it does not, and in

fact this was one of the aims of the advisory committee in

2

1938, when we revised the rule, to get away from the code

practice of requiring the facts of the cause of action all

That led itself --

QUESTION:

That's why these rules religiously

6

avoid determining cause of action.

plead the elements of a cause of action.

MR. MINEAR:

That is exactly right, and I think

that principle is clearly enough established to be

10

Hornbook law.

11

with this on page 13 of our brief.

12

You do not have to

We cite a selection of the cases that deal

QUESTION:

May I ask you one question?

In

13

paragraph 31 of the complaint, they refer to this

14

memorandum as outlining the plaintiff's grievances and

15

requesting -- outlining grievances, then the memorandum

16

was put into the record by the defendant and the judge

17

reviewed the memorandum and thought it didn't really show

18

any discrimination.

19

counsel concedes that there's nothing in the memorandum

20

from which an inference of age or national origin

21

discrimination can be made, and if that were true, would

22

that provide any basis for a 12(b)(6) motion?

23

MR. MINEAR:

He said at oral argument plaintiff's

Well, if I can break down this

24

question and answer it in several parts, first of all we

25

agree it may well have been abuse of discretion for the

21
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

district court to have considered this memorandum rather

2

than converting the motion to summary judgment where

3

questions of fact and -- rather than having to take all

4

the inferences, giving all of the inferences to the

5

plaintiff, the facts could be waived with regard to the

6

meaning of that memorandum.

7

We think that if the memorandum in fact provided

8

no basis for this suit whatsoever and it was the only

9

basis on which the plaintiff had premised is claim, then

10

that might, in fact, be fatal to the complaint, but that's

11

not the situation here and, in fact, there are inferences

12

that can be drawn from that memorandum, such as the

13

reference to a glass ceiling, that could be read favorably

14

to the plaintiff to support his cause of action.

15
16
17

QUESTION:

You'd have to allow discovery anyway

before you could rule under 12(b)(6), right?
MR. MINEAR:

Under the circumstances of

18

considering this memorandum, I think it makes it very

19

difficult not being included in discovery, and I that

20

means that it should be converted to a summary judgment

21

motion under Rule 12(b)(6).

22

QUESTION:

Yes.

That's the difference,

23

basically, between a 12(b)(6) motion and a motion for

24

summary judgment, is that the 12(b)(6) is just on the

25

basis of the pleadings, and the summary judgment is,

22
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

presumably you can consider affidavits and depositions

2

that are taken outside the pleadings.

3

MR. MINEAR:

4

QUESTION:

That's exactly right, Your Honor.
That's exactly what I meant, that you

5

couldn't get rid of the case on the basis of summary

6

judgment without allowing discovery, so there's basically

7

no way to prevent being subjected to discovery on the

8

basis of a claim by somebody who just suspects, with no

9

reason to suspect, that he has been fired because he's

10

Hungarian.
MR. MINEAR:

11

I think that's not, strictly

12

speaking, true in this sense, that the way Rule 56 is

13

structured is that if the defendant makes the motion for

14

summary judgment the plaintiff is under an obligation to

15

come forward with the facts sufficient to indicate there's

16

a triable issue.

17

facts, it can request discovery at that point.

If the plaintiff does not have those

18

24

MR. MINEAR:

1

Is there some verbal formulation that floats around the

2

legal world, in the legal world that helps me?

3

MR. MINEAR:

I think the benchmark for the

4

complaint is whether it provides the employer fair notice

5

of the action.

6

That's how the complaint --

What is the standard of confidence,

7

the standard of belief that the plaintiff and the attorney

8

must have before starting the action?

the state of mind of the plaintiff to determine is bona

implicit in the good faith, there have to be some

objective basis for the good faith belief?

6

MR. MINEAR:

Well, I'm not sure if we can fine-

7

tune the standard here to that degree.

I think the

8

important point is that these facts, these issues can be

9

promptly tested through summary judgment, and summary

10

judgment is designed to deal summarily with those cases

11

which are not substantial, that are not substantial.

12

There may be a requirement of some level of

13

discovery, but the district court, who is -- has the tools

14

available to structure discovery, can limit discovery to

those issues that are in fact -- provide the --

tell by looking at people whether they're lying or not,

MR. MINEAR:

I just can tell.

For a lawyer, I think that would be

an insufficient basis on which to go forward.
QUESTION:

Mr. Minear, what is the status in

22

today's trial where -- it's a long time ago, but we used

to make -- see a lot of complaints where facts were

looking at the memorandum, because the complaint alleges

that the memorandum outlined the petitioner's grievances

MS. BRODY:

MS. BRODY:

We were not asking the petitioner to allege

We were only asking him to make good faith

QUESTION:

Sorry, then I'm confused, because

8

I -- you don't -- an inference isn't the kind of thing

9

that you allege.

An inference is the kind of thing that

10

you make, so you must be saying he has to allege facts

11

that would give rise to an inference, or if you -- are you

12

saying that?

13

MS. BRODY:

14

QUESTION:

That -- facts, factual allegations.
That would -- you have -- he has to

15

allege certain facts that would give rise to an inference,

16

all right.

17

MS. BRODY:

18

QUESTION:

That is correct.
What he did allege was, he alleged as

19

a matter of fact over 2 years people who he alleges were

20

factually less qualified and were either younger or not

21

Hungarian obtained all kinds of advantages that he did

22

not, and then he was fired because of his grievances, and

23

a fair reading is that is both a factual allegation, and

24

grievance refers to what he called -- said earlier in the

25

complaint, so why don't those facts give rise to an

inference that his -- what he said was the conclusion?

this continuing violation theory.

are two separate acts here.

That is correct.
And they say it was, and so there's

an issue of fact.
MS. BRODY:
unreasonableness.

But it's not a matte of

It's a matter of, there's one act which

10

is time-barred, and there's a second act, and you could

11

not link them, especially in this particular case, where

12

the allegations relating to the so-called demotion are

13

totally directed to the demotion and don't carry over into

14

the termination of an employment.

15

QUESTION:

But if even one of them was a good

16

claim, it shouldn't have been dismissed.

17

that neither the demotion nor the termination is

18

sufficiently pleaded?

19

MS. BRODY:

Are you saying

The demotion claim cannot be

20

considered because it's time-barred.

The petitioner did

21

not file an EEOC charge issue within 300 days of that act,

22

so that is something that is an unfortunate event in

23

history, as has been stated by the Court in Rix, and it

24

cannot be used to bolster a claim that occurred, or that

25

might have arisen 2 years later.

The fact that an

2

that was discriminated, was discriminatory 2 years prior

3

to the act that is the subject matter of the complaint,

4

doesn't mean that the second act is also discriminatory,

5

and they cannot be combined and put together --

6

QUESTION:

Well, why not?

I mean, it doesn't

7

mean, of course, that it is, but it is evidence that it

8

is.

9

MS. BRODY:

Your Honor, in certain situations

10

such as a harassment case where there is -- are continuing

11

acts of discrimination that occur, that might be

12

appropriate, but in a case like this, where separate and

13

discrete acts are being alleged, and the first act was

14

completed in 1995 -- nothing more happened after that --

15

there is no reasonable basis for linking these two acts

16

together and basing the termination on the demotion

allegations.

19

plaintiff to base a present claim on a time-barred claim,

and that --

21

In fact, to do so would really circumvent

QUESTION:

Well, does he nowhere allege that his

22

firing was because he was Hungarian, or because he was --

23

because of his age?

MS. BRODY:

He makes the conclusory allegations

that I was terminated because of my national origin and

age, but that does not -- that alone is not sufficient to

2

sustain the claim, a claim, and that is what this Court

3

has stated in Conley, in which it emphasized that the

4

plaintiff had to set forth the grounds on which the claim

5

rests.

6

I believe that this Court also has endorsed that

7

view in the other 12(b)(6) cases that it has considered,

8

such as Rix, such as Sutton, which Justice O'Connor went

9

through and analyzed the statutory elements of the claims

10

to determine whether or not the claims had met them.

1

provisions of the collective bargaining agreement were

2

violated and other specific information which is not

3

required, so that if you look at all of the complaints

4

that have been considered by this Court and even by the

5

circuit courts, you see that each of those complaints are

6

sufficient on their face and they contain more than enough

7

allegations to state the elements of the claims.

8

QUESTION:

But unfortunately you don't have any

in which we find a complaint insufficient because it does

10

not contain that detail.

11

mean, you might well say all these cases in which we've

12

approved going forward with the litigation stated a lot

13

more, but what you need is a case where we approved

14

granting the 12(b)(6) motion because there was not enough

15

detail.

16

MS. BRODY:

17

QUESTION:

18

MS. BRODY:

I mean, that's what you need.

I -That's hard to find.
I think the case that we have, the

19

best case that we have to refer to is the Sutton case,

20

where the Court looked at each of the allegations of the

21

complaint, determined whether or not the plaintiff was

22

disabled, and refused to accept the conclusory allegation

23

that the plaintiff made that she was disabled.

24

QUESTION:

It wasn't because the allegations

weren't sufficiently detailed.

it didn't state what the Court regarded as a violation of

the statutes.

MS. BRODY:

QUESTION:

That's correct.
I mean, that would be like saying in

6

this case, well, even if he were -- his age and national

7

origin were motivating factors in the decision, that

8

doesn't violate the statute, you have to do something

9

more, and I suppose maybe you could argue that, that

motivation isn't enough, it's got to be the sole cause, or

11

something like that.

of inference, some sort of suggestion, some hint of

21

There is notice that the complaint is that I was fired

22

because of my age and my national origin.

why I mentioned Dioguardi v. Durning, because even if it

2

for the Second Circuit, which is why I find it very

3

puzzling this Court reached the result it did.

4

MS. BRODY:

Your Honor, if you look at the

5

Dioguardi complaint you will see that all of the elements

6

of the claim are alleged in that complaint.

7

QUESTION:

What do you mean by elements?

I

8

thought it was, indeed, Hornbook law that you are not

9

required under the Federal rules to plead the elements

10
11

that constitute a, quote, cause of action?
MS. BRODY:

That is correct, Your Honor, but

12

there has to be something in the complaint that goes to

13

the heart of the claim and, in a discrimination case, the

14

heart of the claim is the discrimination.

15

contract case, the heart of the claim is the breach, and

16

if you identify the contract, you identify the breach, you

identify the injury, you have satisfied the elements, or

MS. BRODY:

It goes on for several pages, but

the facts do not support the conclusion, that is, the

10

factual allegations, and there are factual allegations in

11

this complaint, and interestingly, petitioner doesn't

claim that he doesn't have to allege that he was a member

13

of a protected class, he doesn't claim that he doesn't

that he did not have to allege that there was an adverse

at the four corners of the complaint and determine whether

there were any other allegations in it.

No, but you're arguing this case as

title VII claim that you establish a prima facie case, and

15

I don't think it is.

16

MS. BRODY:

Your Honor, I believe under

17

McDonnell Douglas if you're going to base your claim on an

18

inferential case that you do need to allege and prove the

elements of the prima facie case.

Alderson Reporting Company

been used frequently, and neither the court of appeals,

2

the district court, or the respondent here is suggesting

3

that a petitioner or plaintiff must allege facts or set

4

forth evidence.

5

basis for making allegations, and if you look at all the

6

discrimination cases that have come before this case,

7

going back to McDonnell Douglas, there has always been an

8

allegation of some inference of discrimination, and

9

that --

10

All he has to do is have a good faith

QUESTION:

I've never seen an allegation of an

inference.

I've only seen an allegation of facts, and I

bring this up again because now you say he doesn't have to

facts.

24
25

You're talking about a failure to allege certain

MS. BRODY:

Yes.

Allegations are based on

facts, and I think that you have to make allegations which

42
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

have some factual basis in order to go forward with the

2

case.

3

QUESTION:

Well, in addition to what he said, he

4

also said that everybody else, and he names about 10

5

people, who were dismissed were dismissed for cause and

6

given severance benefits, but he was dismissed without

7

cause and wasn't given severance benefits.

8

seems directly related to the dismissal and, moreover,

9

reading it in light of what he said before, he alleges as

Well, that

10

a conclusion that this shows I was dismissed without

11

severance because of my nationality or because of my age.

12

Why aren't those facts that give rise to an inference, at

13

least as much as, I was in an accident and therefore he's

14

negligent?

15

MS. BRODY:

Because those allegations alone are

16

insufficient in that he does not allege the national

17

origin of any of those individuals, some of whom could be

Hungarian.

of those individuals who were terminated and allegedly

said that he was dismissed from his employment because he

was Hungarian and because of his age, what more than what

4

I've just said ought he to have alleged to have complied

5

with the bare minimum?

6

MS. BRODY:

What he ought to have alleged is the

kind of allegation that is alleged in McDonnell Douglas,

8

that is alleged in McDonald v. Santa Fe, that is alleged

9

in Rix.

All these allegations in all these cases raise --

QUESTION:

11

But McDonnell Douglas I don't think

12

was ever meant to be a pleading requirement.

It was a

13

way, as Justice Scalia said, to survive summary judgment

14

and get to the jury.

used --

complaint need only allege a conclusion in order to

proceed with discovery and summary judgment and trial --

17
18

QUESTION:

This count, Rule 11 -- this person

was represented before the district court, right?

19

MS. BRODY:

20

QUESTION:

Correct.
In fact, the same counsel, and there

21

was a representation to the court made by the attorney

22

under Rule 11 that says there's a good basis in law and

23

fact for this charge.

24
25

MS. BRODY:

Does that count for nothing?
That does count for something, but

the problem which we're addressing here is that there are

45
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

not sufficient allegations in this complaint which

2

indicate that discrimination has anything to do with --

3

QUESTION:

And the best case you have for that

4

is the statute of limitations case, which is an

5

affirmative defense that, if the time is up, that's it.

6

There's nothing -- you could have all the beautiful facts

7

in the world, so that statute of limitations, you can

8

answer the complaint with that and get summary judgment on

9

this spot, or even, arguably, 12(b)(6), but you have given

10

the statute of limitations as the only pleading case.

11

others were all cases that plaintiffs won, and you're

12

searching for language that you can pull out of them to

13

say, ah, but in other circumstances they would have lost.

14

MS. BRODY:

The

I think that if you look at McDonald

15

v. Santa Fe Trail you will see that the Court there

16

utilized McDonnell Douglas on a 12(b)(6) motion, and it

17

examined the allegations in the complaint there to

18

determine whether or not the plaintiff had alleged facts

19

which could give rise to an inference of discrimination.

20

That was one of the issues in McDonnell Douglas, and that

21

is a case where this Court applied McDonnell Douglas and

22

required an inference of discrimination.

23

QUESTION:

24

MS. BRODY:

25

What case are you referring to now?
That is the case, McDonald v. Santa

Fe Trail Transportation.

1

QUESTION:

That was a dismissal under 12(b)(6)?

2

MS. BRODY:

That was a dismissal on a 12(b)(6).

3

The other case that I would refer the Court to

4

is Baldwin County Welcome Center v. Brown, which is a case

5

where this Court held that a right-to-sue letter issued by

6

the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission did not

7

constitute a complaint because it did not comply with Rule

claim.

to have a document that's entitled, Complaint, in order to

of the claim could be stated.

2

QUESTION:

3

I'm confused.

The right-to-sue

letter would have come from the EEOC.

filed it.

10

But that was not the plaintiff's

That was a notice from the EEOC.
MS. BRODY:

Well, the plaintiff called that his

pleading, and he proceeded on that as his pleading.
QUESTION:

11

May I ask you just one question, as

12

having studied the complaint as carefully as you have?

13

you interpret the charge that your client was

14

discriminating against this person because he was

15

Hungarian, or because he was not French?
MS. BRODY:

16

Do

Your Honor, that's an excellent

17

question, and I think there has been a use of these terms

18

very loosely.

19

arguing is the latter point, that he was discriminated

20

against because he was not French, and I believe it was

21

because he was not a French citizen.

22

these other individuals in the company were French

23

national.

24
25

I believe that what he petitioner is

He alleges that

In his EEOC charge he makes clear that he
regards them as French citizens and, in fact, one of them,

1

one of these French nationals is actually of Greek

2

heritage, so the discrimination that we re talking about

3

here is really not based on national origin at all.

4

based on citizenship and, as this Court knows from

5

Espinoza, that is not covered by title VII.

proper basis for a discrimination claim.

MS. BRODY:

Yes, Your Honor, that is correct.

11

QUESTION:

Well, I thought you gave that to us

12

as an example of where McDonnell Douglas had been applied

13

at the pleading stage to dismiss the case on 12(b)(6)

14

grounds.

15
16
17

MS. BRODY:

Oh, Your Honor, I may have misspoke

on that, but the Court -QUESTION:

So all of your cases, then, are cases

18

in which the plaintiff surmounted the 12(b)(6) hurdle, and

19

there's language in that -- you -- for this mythical case

20

that hasn't yet occurred.

21

MS. BRODY:

Your Honor, I think that Rix, I

22

think that Evans, and I think that Sutton area 11 cases

case and indicate the kind of notice that is required,

I thought when you -- there is

12

evidence outside the four corners of the complaint, then

13

you can bring it as a Rule 56 summary judgment motion, not

14

a 12(b)(6) motion, so technically that, if you're supposed

15

to look only to the complaint on a 12(b)(6) motion that

16

should not have been considered.

17

MS. BRODY:

Your Honor, I think that it is

18

universally recognized that if a document is referred to

19

and relied on in the complaint, it is regarded as being

20

incorporated into the complaint, and it's proper for the

21

Court to look at it on a 12(b)(6) motion.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF HAROLD I. GOODMAN

2

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

3

MR. GOODMAN:

Just to follow up on Justice

4

Ginsburg's comment about McDonald, on the very point

5

raised, the complaint was sustained and not denied.

6

427 U.S. 283, footnote 11, the Court held that there was

7

no requirement for particularity as defendant had

8

requested, and thus sustained the complaint.

9

At

Second, and last, in 1953 the Ninth Circuit

10

recommended to the advisory committee that Rule 8, too, be

11

amended to add this phrase at the end, namely the

12

statement in the complaint shall contain facts

13

constituting a cause of action.

In 1955, the court's

14

advisory committee rejected it.

It said that it only

15

requires a general statement.

16

Thank you.

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:
