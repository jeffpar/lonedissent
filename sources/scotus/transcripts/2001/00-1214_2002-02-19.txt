ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM H. PRYOR, JR.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. PRYOR:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
30 years ago in Argersinger v. Hamlin and then

11

more than 20 years ago in Scott v. Illinois, this Court

12

established the principle that, under the Sixth and

13

Fourteenth Amendments, a State is not obligated to provide

14

an indigent defendant in a misdemeanor case court-

15

appointed and taxpayer-funded counsel, provided that the

16

defendant is not actually imprisoned upon conviction.

17
18
19

8 years ago in Nichols v. the United States,
this Court reaffirmed that principle.
The Supreme Court of Alabama distorted this

20

well-established and workable rule and held that a

21

probated or suspended sentence, which actually liberates a

22

defendant to return to free society, nevertheless triggers

23

a right to court-appointed and taxpayer-funded counsel.

24
25

There are three arguments that I would like to
address this morning.

QUESTION:

Do you -- do you concede that the

2

State can never impose the original sentence of time in

3

jail?

4

MR. PRYOR:

Your Honor, obviously that is not a

5

court -- a question that this Court has directly addressed

6

in either Argersinger or Scott.

7

QUESTION:

Our best reading --

I'm asking whether the State of

8

Alabama concedes that it can't ever impose that original

9

sentence.

10

MR. PRYOR:

Our reading of Scott is that -- that

11

we cannot activate the suspended sentence.

12

that Mr. Fried, as an amicus, certainly has a plausible

13

reading that would allow the court to activate that

14

sentence.

15

back to the original offense and that the court --

In our judgment, that original sentence relates

QUESTION:

16

We acknowledge

What -- what happens in Alabama if --

17

if a -- a criminal defendant is convicted of a misdemeanor

18

and placed on probation and then violates probation?

19

that enable the State to impose the original sentence for

20

violation of the probation?
MR. PRYOR:

21

Yes, ordinarily it would.

Does

But for

22

the problem presented involving an uncounseled defendant,

23

it would allow the State to activate the suspended

24

sentence.

25

QUESTION:

Well, then we're jumping probably

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

ahead into what you're going to tell us, but while we're

2

at this point, it seems to me that if -- if you say that

3

the sentence cannot be reimposed, you're saying that the

4

State courts are in the position of imposing a sentence

5

that is something of a rouse.

6

courts in this position?

7

very sound for us to tell the State courts, well, you go

8

ahead and tell these people that they can -- might be put

9

in prison, but that that won't really happen.

Why should you put your own

I -- I just don't think it's

10

me that that's your position.

11

MR. PRYOR:

It seems to

Well, there's still a risk of

12

imprisonment, the same risk of imprisonment, under our

13

reading of Argersinger and Scott, that -- that is

14

accompanied with the judgment of a mere fine.

15

has the power to enforce any judgment as an essential

16

aspect of the administration of justice through the power

17

of contempt.

18

QUESTION:

Every court

But you're -- you're treating the

19

contempt proceeding, in effect, as a separate proceeding

20

then, and I take it, though I'm not sure that I remember

21

this from your briefs -- I take it that on -- on your view

22

of the way the scheme ought to operate in the contempt

23

proceeding, before there could be any confinement on a

24

finding of contempt, that counsel would have to be

25

provided then if -- if the individual is indigent and

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

didn't waive it.

2
3

MR. PRYOR:

That's -- that's correct, Justice

Souter.

4

QUESTION:

So, it's the separate counseled

5

proceeding that distinguishes your case from -- from the

6

case that Mr. Fried argues for.

7

MR. PRYOR:

That -- that's correct, Justice

8

Souter.

And -- and at a minimum I would say, although I

9

don't think the Court has to ever address this question

10

because there's been no violation of probation -- at a

11

minimum the State would have the same power to enforce its

12

judgment that it would a judgment of a mere fine which

13

this Court held squarely in Scott does not trigger a right

14

to court-appointed --

15

QUESTION:

From your point of view, General

16

Pryor, what does the State gain as -- as opposed to what

17

the Supreme Court of Alabama said, by following --

18

following your -- your line of reasoning?

19

Justice Kennedy said, it -- it imposes a sentence, but a

20

sentence that everybody knows can't be enforced.

21

MR. PRYOR:

I think as

The State gains the powerful tool of

22

probation to rehabilitate an offender that the State

23

believes is a good risk, a risk to return to free society

24

who can be rehabilitated, depending on whatever mechanisms

25

of probation have been adopted by the trial court.

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Meanwhile, the State is preserving its scarce judicial

2

resources to incarcerate more dangerous offenders and

3

provide counsel in more serious cases.

4

QUESTION:

But what -- how effective is

5

probation going to be if there isn't the threat of -- of a

6

sentence in case of probation violation?

7

MR. PRYOR:

I think at a minimum, the probation

8

is going to be as effective as a judgment of a fine

9

because the State is going to still have the flexible

10

power of contempt, whether civil or criminal in nature, to

11

ensure that its orders are followed and -- and will

12

continue to exercise jurisdiction of the probationer

13

during that period of probation.

14

QUESTION:

Is it the -- is it the case in

15

Alabama that probation cannot be imposed without a

16

suspended sentence?

17
18
19

MR. PRYOR:

That is correct.

Technically that

is how probation is imposed, Justice Souter.
QUESTION:

Wouldn't -- wouldn't we have at least

20

a more candid system or wouldn't the interaction of

21

Argersinger and -- and the Alabama system, as you view

22

Argersinger, produce a more candid system if -- if we took

23

the position that, no, they can't impose a suspended

24

sentence, and Alabama would then presumably amend its laws

25

so that probation could be imposed without imposing a

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

suspended sentence, and you on your view would have your

2

-- your contempt remedy.

3

-- the two systems wouldn't be producing this kind of

4

silly effect of -- of a sentence which everyone realizes

5

as such cannot be imposed.

6

MR. PRYOR:

We wouldn't be -- in effect, the

Alabama certainly has the freedom to

7

adopt I think either system without running afoul of the

8

Constitution, which is the -- the issue before this Court.

9

Although it might make more sense and not seem as silly to

10

impose probation without going through the mechanics of -QUESTION:

11

Well, is -- is there any State which

12

imposes probation without a suspended sentence that you

13

know of?

14

MR. PRYOR:

I know from the amicus brief of the

15

National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers that

16

there are some States that impose, in fact, pretrial

17

probation, that that is something that --

18
19
20

QUESTION:

How about post-trial, after a

conviction?
MR. PRYOR:

I just don't know.

I know that

21

there were several States that were cited in Shelton's

22

briefly correctly that -- that used the same mechanism

23

that Alabama does.

There were several cites --

24

QUESTION:

General Pryor --

25

QUESTION:

Well, what -- what authority would --

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

would the State have to -- to put somebody on probation

2

unless -- unless it is the suspension of -- of a judgment

3

of incarceration?

4

saying you're going to be on probation?

I mean, can a State just go around

5

MR. PRYOR:

6

QUESTION:

Well -It seems to me the only -- the only

7

reason it -- it has that grip over the person is that --

8

is that it has a right to incarcerate him.

9
10

MR. PRYOR:

The States certainly view that as an

effective mechanism in most -QUESTION:

11

I'm not sure there's an alternative

12

to it.

13

can put on probation whomever they want to put on

14

probation.

15

I'm not sure you can just pass a law saying judges

MR. PRYOR:

I think that -- that the Alabama

16

legislature has the inherent power to define what a

17

sentence is, whether a sentence is a fine or whether a

18

sentence is imprisonment.

19

would have the flexibility to define a sentence -- one of

20

the sentencing options as -- as probation.

21

QUESTION:

And in fact, I think the State

I take it what they would do on that

22

scheme would be to say, upon conviction of offense A, the

23

court may impose probation, and if the conditions of

24

probation are violated and are shown in a separate trial

25

or proceeding to that effect, the violation itself can be

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

punished.

That would be the way the scheme would work,

2

wouldn't it?

3

MR. PRYOR:

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. PRYOR:

That's correct.
If -- if Alabama wanted it.
If Alabama wanted it.

But -- but

6

this is really -- in my judgment this would be elevating

7

form over substance because the -- the effect is the same

with whichever system Alabama wants to adopt --

General Pryor, explain to me how some

other States approach it.

condition that the -- the defendant abide by certain terms

and conditions.

MR. PRYOR:

And if -- if the defendant then

It's a deferred prosecution on

Is that how it works?

16

If I understand correctly,

I believe the -- the brief listed 23

States.
QUESTION:

Well, these are pretrial diversion

23

programs which have been very helpful in the drug context,

24

but they're extremely expensive to administer.

25

MR. PRYOR:

Absolutely.

Absolutely.

And -- and

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

many States may very well feel that -- that there's

2

something almost unseemly about using this kind of

3

bargaining process before you have adjudicated guilt or

4

innocence, and -- and the State certainly should have

5

the --

6
7
8
9

QUESTION:

Well, why is it any more unseemly

than the ordinary plea bargain?
MR. PRYOR:

Because at least in the -- in the

case of the ordinary plea bargain, the defendant comes

10

forward and admits the wrongdoing.

There's an indicia of

11

reliability there for the State that's not present in this

12

kind of pretrial system.

13

their system to adjudicate innocence or guilt may find

14

that that's a -- that the system that Alabama has is a

15

preferable system.

And -- and the States who trust

16

QUESTION:

But Shelton was not given any

17

pretrial diversion.

He was convicted, was he not?

18

MR. PRYOR:

That's correct, and Alabama doesn't

19

have it in this context except with respect to drug

20

offenders.

21

QUESTION:

General Pryor, I can understand a

22

line between a fine and any kind of confinement, and

23

probation may involve no immediate incarceration, but it

24

does involve what could be very significant restraints on

25

the person.

So, isn't it more logical to draw the line

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

between money only on the one hand and confinement, be it

2

in jail or under terms and conditions of probation?

3

MR. PRYOR:

Justice Ginsburg, I'd say no for a

4

couple of reasons.

This Court has recognized that

5

imprisonment is an intrinsically different form of

6

punishment that has special constitutional significance.

7

The probation system is one that is meant more as

8

rehabilitation and not as punishment to give an offender a

9

second chance in free society.

And -- and even with the

10

judgment of a fine, as I mentioned earlier, there -- it --

11

it is accompanied by the risk of imprisonment should the

12

defendant willfully refuse to pay that fine.

13

that context, in the judgment of -- of a fine, there is at

14

least that risk, the same risk that would exist under the

15

regime that we propose.

So, even in

16

I do not discount the fact that probation has --

17

can have serious restrictions on liberty, but it's not the

18

-- the deprivation of liberty, the loss of physical

19

liberty, that is, physical confinement that this Court has

20

held triggers a right to court-appointed counsel under the

21

Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments.
QUESTION:

22

Under your view, if you enforced the

23

jail sentence through the contempt mechanism and reached

24

the same result, I take it you now have a second jury

25

trial.

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. PRYOR:

Well, I guess it would be dependent

2

in part on the nature of the contempt proceeding.

3

civil contempt, if it's a direct contempt or an indirect

4

contempt, but if it's criminal contempt, I would imagine

5

-- I say that.

So,

For more than 20 --

If it's just 5 days, that's not equivalent to

MR. PRYOR:

15

They're not

Oh, absolutely.

That's absolutely

16

right, although I would argue that -- that the threat of

17

imprisonment is still enough to give the probationer an

18

incentive to follow the orders of the court.

19

absolutely correct that there is a material difference

20

between activation of the probated sentence in this case

21

and the use of -- of the criminal contempt remedy that's

22

provided by the code of Alabama.

23

that.

24
25

It's

There's no doubt about

The -- what is at stake in this case is -- is
the use of probation, a valuable tool for the States that

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

allow them the freedom and flexibility again to ensure

2

that scarce judicial resources can be preserved for more

3

serious cases to provide counsel and to incarcerate more

4

serious offenders.

5

If there are no further questions from the

6

Court, Mr. Chief Justice, I'd like to reserve the balance

7

of my time for rebuttal.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES FRIED

11

ON BEHALF OF THE AMICUS CURIAE

12
13
14

IN OPPOSITION TO THE JUDGMENT BELOW
MR. FRIED:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

15

First, if I might just refer to the deferred

16

prosecution point, which was raised by Mr. Duke in his

17

amicus brief and in one of the questions.

18

a red herring because, as Mr. Duke points out, the

19

deferred prosecution requires the consent of both the

20

prosecutor and the defendant.

21

prosecutions we have here are usually not consented to by

22

the defendant.

23

I think it is --

24

QUESTION:

25

I think that's

Obviously, the kind of

Why -- why is that a red herring?

Because I got from your brief the impression that the --

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the -- there's a practical problem that a lot of States do

2

without giving people lawyers.

3

thousands of cases say, go plead guilty.

4

some light sentence that won't involve prison, but then

5

they attach to that a suspended sentence.

6

wondered is, well, isn't the solution to this to say --

7

it's called pretrial diversion or pretrial probation or

8

they call it different names, but to say if you violate

9

the condition, what happens to you is not prison, what

Perhaps thousands and
We'll give you

And what I

10

happens to you is the trial that we haven't yet given you

11

with a lawyer.

12

practical matter in a lot of these States in a lot of the

13

cases to which you referred.

14

And I thought maybe that works as a

MR. FRIED:

It -- it does work.

For instance,

15

we use it a great deal in the Commonwealth of

16

Massachusetts where there is a quite different rule from

17

-- from the Argersinger rule where in Massachusetts we say

18

if there's a risk of imprisonment, you must get a lawyer.

19

And a number of States have that rule which is perhaps why

20

they also have the deferred prosecution.

21

I say it's a red herring because what we're

22

considering today is not the very best possible system but

23

what is the constitutional minimum.

24

brief on Nichols is not in order to show that Nichols

25

somehow resolves this question in favor of allowing the

Our emphasis in the

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

probated sentence and in favor of allowing it then to be

2

activated on violation, but rather Nichols shows that the

3

question is an open one.

4

then neither does Argersinger.

5

and it's a mistake the Alabama Supreme Court made to treat

6

Argersinger as having resolved this question.

7

Nichols doesn't resolve it, but
And I think it's a mistake

Argersinger made quite clear that there is a

8

continuum here all the way from mere due process, which

9

was the law prior to Gideon, to a criminal -- to the right

10

of a criminal defendant having a counsel in any criminal

11

case.

12

Court recognized had a certain arbitrariness, and it

13

picked it for reasons of practicality and fairness.

14

those considerations of practicality and fairness require

15

no more than that there be counsel if the person is

16

sentenced immediately then and there to prison.

17

And it picked a point.

It picked a point which the

And

The fairness aspect is, as the Illinois court

18

pointed out, that in these cases the defendant carries the

19

key to the prison in his own pocket.

20

in prison is a matter of his choice whether or not he

21

violates the terms of the probation.

22

Whether he ends up

That's why I think Mr. Duke enters two more red

23

herrings into the argument.

The stay on appeal.

24

Obviously in a stay case, the keys are not in the pocket

25

of the defendant, but in the pocket of the appeals court.

16

1

And the 30-day or $30 prison which is executed

2

immediately, in those cases the fine is either an illegal

3

fine under the -- this Court's decision in Bierdon -- the

4

person doesn't pay because he cannot, and that is itself a

5

constitutional violation -- or once again, he is

6

imprisoned because he chooses not to pay.

7

that is the fairness point.

8
9

And once again,

The keys are in his pocket.

That is a reasonable place to draw the line
because of the very important practicalities.

The

10

practicalities are the literally millions of misdemeanor

11

cases, the very large number -- it's hard to say exactly

12

what the number is -- the very large number of

13

probationary misdemeanor sentences, and the fact that

those probationary sentences overwhelmingly are intended

This system, as simply a constitutional minimum,

allows the States the flexibility which this Court from

the beginning, from Argersinger on, has recognized.

You do allow the possibility that

Ganyon talks about that in terms of due

But the issue with the revocation

It would just be whether he violated a term of

That is correct.
Not against the crime itself.
That is correct.
Well, it would -- it would also

cover, I take it, whether or not the plea was voluntary

22

and knowingly made originally.

23

MR. FRIED:

That could be brought up.

Nothing

-- nothing precludes bringing that up.

What you have is a

Well, is it your view that at the

probation hearing you reexamine the validity of the

6

MR. FRIED:

The -- Alabama is a good example of

7

what is open at probation.

In most jurisdictions, oddly

8

enough, not in Massachusetts -- in most jurisdictions, the

9

court on probation is free to impose new -- the revocation

10

proceeding -- new conditions, the sentence that has

11

already been imposed, or a lesser sentence in light of all

12

circumstances, and it mentions specifically

Yes, but all those alternatives

At least in a typical case.

QUESTION:

Do we have any idea of the 1.4

million to 1.8 million people who are on probation for

misdemeanors, of what percentage of those cases the -- the

MR. FRIED:

I

We try -That's a rather -- yes.
We try to infer that in the brief.

19

It's -- the statistics are not kept in a transparent or

20

useful way.

21

It may be in the hundreds of thousands because as -- as we

22

explain in our brief, there are a very large number of

23

persons on probation who did not have lawyers, and given

24

Argersinger, we may assume that they were misdemeanors.

25

So, it's a very large number.

But it may be in the hundreds of thousands.

20
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

But the number of persons who are actually

2

incarcerated for breach of those conditions is quite

3

small.

4

becomes quite practical to offer an attorney to help in

5

that condition, but really I think very confining and

6

perhaps with a perverse effect to require it as a

7

constitutional minimum in the much larger -- very much

8

larger number of cases where the matter is first

considered.

10

It's in the thousands.

And that's why I think it

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM H. MILLS

17

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

18
19
20

Mr.

MR. MILLS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
It obviously is apparent here that both the

21

petitioner and the respondent come to this Court relying

22

on the same authority, the -- primarily the Argersinger

23

and Scott cases.

24
25

It seems that the State is taking a rather
shallow view, in our judgment, of the Argersinger and

21
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Scott cases both as to their background and how

2

Argersinger is -- is implemented and the effect of that

3

implementation.

4
5

QUESTION:

Do you agree that neither of those

cases squarely control the outcome here?

6

MR. MILLS:

It -- it would be my position that

7

Argersinger does by the -- some of the pronouncements that

8

it makes.

9

QUESTION:

Certainly the holding does not.

10

MR. MILLS:

11

And it would further be my position that -- that

12

the Scott case has something to say to us about this issue

13

also, although the holding -- the -- the facts certainly

14

do not coincide with this case.

15

The holding does not certainly.

It seems to me that the background of the

16

Argersinger and Scott cases, of course, are the -- the

17

Powell v. Alabama, Gideon v. Wainwright series of cases.

18

And in those cases, it seems that the Court has

19

established the purpose of the Counsel Clause which if we

20

-- if we reduce to its barest terms is this.

21

of the Counsel Clause is to prevent, to the extent humanly

22

possible, the conviction of the innocent in an adversary

23

proceeding.

24

in Powell v. Alabama and what Justice Black said in Gideon

25

v. Wainwright, that what is to be done is to eliminate the

The purpose

That seems to be what Justice Sutherland said

1

risk that the innocent may be convicted.

2

And when we come to the Argersinger case,

3

although the -- the Gideon case had -- had spoken of this

4

as being a -- or nobel idea was the -- were the words used

5

-- but I believe spoke of counsel for every defendant in

6

every case as being a constitutional ideal.

7

Argersinger, the Court was faced with the argument of

8

practicability and expense and -- and the other arguments

9

that -- that the State makes in this case, that the

I think in

10

mandate can't be absolute, that there must be some

11

accommodation to those arguments.
And in Argersinger, it -- it seems that the

12
13

Court made those accommodations.
QUESTION:

14
15

only?

Okay.

16

Amendment to that.

And if we include --

Well, the Court basically said, fine

We're not going to extend the Sixth

Now, here we have a State that says, well, we

17
18

know we can't enforce the sentence.

19

tiger.

20

I mean, we'll -- we'll maybe have proceedings, but we --

21

we can never enforce the sentence.

22

should we be concerned here?

23

It's a toothless

We'll say probation, but it -- we don't mean it.

MR. MILLS:

In light of that,

Well, that -- that puzzled me

24

somewhat when the State made that concession in its reply

25

brief that this was in -- in effect a sham sentence.

And

23

1

I see no authority in the law of Alabama or any other

2

State that I'm aware of that authorizes a court --

3
4

QUESTION:

Well, if that's the case, what do we

think about this?

5

MR. MILLS:

Perhaps we're dealing with a sham

6

sentence.

7

Court treated it.

8

this Court or any other court, an authorization for a

9

trial court to enter a sentence that can't be enforced.

10

And perhaps that's the way the Alabama Supreme
But certainly there shouldn't be, from

QUESTION:

Would you just clarify one thing for

11

me?

Did the Alabama Supreme Court endorse that view, or

12

is that the Attorney General?

13

MR. MILLS:

That's the Attorney General's view.

14

What the Alabama petit court -- Supreme Court did was

15

merely strike the sentence.

16

QUESTION:

I guess whether you strike it or not

17

is a matter of State law, isn't it?

I mean -- I don't

18

know what the remedy should be for a sentence that's not

19

-- not an enforceable sentence and the person writes it in

20

the -- the judge writes in the book, suspended sentence.

21

And the State and everyone else, let's say, agree that

22

that isn't a lawful sentence.

23

says, erase those words.

24

that was a matter of Federal law or what you do under

25

State law when a --

That it be struck rather than just

left to lie there unenforceable.

5

MR. MILLS:

I'm not sure they articulated in

6

those terms, but their -- their basis for reaching the

7

decision they reached was the Federal cases that deal with

8

the right of counsel.

9

QUESTION:

One of the things that didn't happen,

10

we know for sure, in this case was that an offer of

11

counsel.

12

court's part or does Alabama not provide assigned counsel

13

for indigents in -- in a misdemeanor like this?

Was that merely a -- an inadvertence on the

MR. MILLS:

14

Perhaps it was inadvertence, but the

15

-- the Alabama rules of criminal procedure have that as a

16

part of the -- the processing of any -- any case.

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. MILLS:

19

QUESTION:

In any misdemeanor?
Any criminal prosecution, yes, sir.
All right.

So that if -- if there

20

had been -- if there were an offense in Alabama that

21

carried as much as a 1-day sentence, the State would

22

provide counsel for an indigent, at least if requested?
MR. MILLS:

23

Not -- not in those terms.

Not -- I

24

believe the Alabama rules say where constitutionally

25

required.

And of course the --

25
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

So, they're not providing counsel in

2

these cases now because, I take it, the State's position

3

is it's not constitutionally required.

4

MR. MILLS:

5

QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.
At what point do they regard it as

6

being constitutionally required?

When the sentence can

7

exceed 6 months or what?

8

want to know -- I want your response to the argument that

9

there's going to be a -- a great practical difference if

What -- what I'm getting at is I

10

we say now you may not impose sentences like this at all,

11

even though they're merely suspended.

12

the practical difference is.

13

MR. MILLS:

I want to know what

From the -- the wording of the

14

Alabama Rules of Criminal Procedure about appointment of

15

counsel at the present time, I would assume that the trial

16

judge must go through the process outlined in Argersinger,

17

that is, make the pretrial determination of whether

18

imprisonment is a likely punishment in this particular

19

case, and if -- if so, appoint counsel.

20

counsel is not appointed.

21
22
23
24
25

QUESTION:

If not so,

Well, any imprisonment?

1 day of

imprisonment?
QUESTION:

Isn't that what the Federal --

Argersinger requires?
MR. MILLS:

I think that's what Argersinger

says.
QUESTION:

Okay.

But Alabama, in other words,

is not doing something eccentric in this respect.

4

MR. MILLS:

5

QUESTION:

That -- that's correct.
The -- the only difference then

6

between the cases in which -- misdemeanor cases, for

7

example, in which counsel is offered, if an individual is

8

indigent, and counsel is not offered are cases in which

9

the judge says in advance I'm not going to put this guy

10
11
12
13

away at all even if we convict him.
MR. MILLS:

Presumably that's the process that's

being followed.
QUESTION:

Now, do you have -- do you have any

14

basis to tell us what practical difference it would make

15

if the judge said, well, I may impose a suspended sentence

16

and therefore I will have to offer counsel because I read

17

Argersinger as requiring that?

18

difference that would make in practical terms?

19

cases would counsel have to be offered and potentially

20

provided for where it's not being offered and potentially

21

provided for now?

22

MR. MILLS:

Do you know what
How many

I don't have any data that would --

23

would support that, but it -- but it would seem that if

24

the trial judge makes the pretrial determination that any

25

sentence, whether -- whether immediate or suspended, is

27
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

warranted or may be warranted in this particular case,

2

that counsel should be appointed -- of course, that's the

3

position.

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. MILLS:

6

QUESTION:

I understand that.
That's the position.
Mr. Mills, there is one thing that I

7

think is a piece of information that -- that is in the

8

record, and that is that most non-indigent misdemeanors

9

appear in court without counsel.

So, the position that

10

you're urging is kind of a superior justice for the

11

indigents.

12

at the end of the line, there may be any jail time,

13

although most people who can't afford counsel do not have

14

counsel in cases of -- of this kind.

Counsel, you would say, in every case where,

MR. MILLS:

15

That perhaps is correct.

I suppose

16

my response to that would be that that's -- that that's a

17

free choice that the non-indigent makes.
QUESTION:

18

Isn't it true also -- isn't it true

19

also, at least according to some of the statistics quoted,

20

that frequently these cases are not prosecuted by lawyers?

21

They're simply prosecuted by the arresting officer.
MR. MILLS:

22

That happens occasionally in

23

Alabama.

It used to happen a lot.

24

rare at the present time.

25

That does happen.

It's -- it's fairly

But -- but that does happen.

28
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

And, of course, in -- in Alabama, all

2

misdemeanors, except those that are initiated by

3

indictment, the first trial is in a -- a district or

4

municipal court where there's no jury trial.

5

trial, if there is a right to jury trial, comes only by a

6

-- an appeal and a de novo trial in the circuit court,

7

which is an administrative problem.

8

-- as a philosophical problem.

9

most misdemeanors are -- are being tried in courts where

And the jury

I don't see that as a

It's -- it's still the --

10

there is no jury, certainly all of them in the first

11

instance or most of them in the first instance.

12

It seems that the petitioner's position

13

overlooks the fact that -- that the Sixth Amendment is --

14

is prophylactic rather than curative.

15

ideal is to prevent the convictions, not to do something

16

about them after they occur.

17

Now, its -- its

Now, let me jump right quick to -- to the point

18

that Argersinger deals with it somewhat in that way.

19

Argersinger is what we might call an outcome-based

20

analysis of whether there's a right to counsel.

21

and to that extent, maybe it's -- it's curative rather

22

than prophylactic.

And --

23

But if -- if it is to be outcome-based analysis,

24

certainly it ought to be the -- the total outcome not just

25

the immediate outcome, and if a suspended sentence results

29
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

in incarceration, when the probation is revoked, that

2

certainly is a part of the -- of the outcome that

3

Argersinger was -- was dealing that the trial judge is

4

required to make some decision on before trial even

5

begins.

6

So -QUESTION:

Do you suppose it would be

7

constitutional for the State to offer the defendant at the

8

outset the promise of imposition of a suspended sentence

9

if counsel were waived?

10

MR. MILLS:

If knowingly waived, I don't see a

11

constitutional problem with that.

12

happens in fact.

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. MILLS:

And I'm sure that

Is that done sometimes in Alabama?
It -- it is.

It is done.

And, of

15

course, this is -- this is the distinction between the --

16

the pretrial diversion mechanism that was addressed

17

earlier and a trial.

18

pretrial diversions are by definition.

19

QUESTION:

Most pretrial -- perhaps all

Well, put in its raw form, if the

20

judge said, now, if -- if you agree not to have a counsel,

21

I'll agree not to impose a jail sentence, that -- that

22

wouldn't be permitted.

23

MR. MILLS:

24

QUESTION:

25

I mean -Yes, sir, and it seems if --

I assume.

Correct me if I'm wrong.

I assume it wouldn't be permitted.

Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. MILLS:

I think that's correct.

In fact, I

2

think that's what Argersinger requires.

3

Argersinger requires a trial judge to assure the defendant

4

who goes to trial without a lawyer that he's not going to

5

get jail sentence.

6

somewhere down the line, the judge has given him a false

7

assurance.

8
9
10

I think

And if he can receive a jail sentence

But --

QUESTION:

The -- the jail sentence would not be

for the original crime necessarily but perhaps just for
breaking probation.
MR. MILLS:

11

Well, I couldn't speak to all

12

jurisdictions, but certainly under Alabama law, there

13

would be no -- no way to impose a sentence for breaking

14

probation.

It would either be the original sentence --

QUESTION:

15

Well, that's what I mean.

But the

16

reason this -- the original sentence now becomes effective

17

is because he broke probation.

This, of course, is correct.

This

different?

6

MR. MILLS:

Why should the two cases be

is if the suspended sentence is imposed, a person is being

imprisoned because he committed a crime.

QUESTION:

That would

And if the fine -- if the fine is

imposed, the fine is being imposed because the individual

willfully refuses to pay it where he has the ability to do

15

so.

16

QUESTION:

Well, is the -- is the difference

17

that you're making willful?

the conditions of suspension are not willful and refusals

Argersinger?
MR. DUKE:

Because Argersinger, Mr. Chief

Argersinger explicitly

MR. DUKE:

The -- the studies that I've seen

suggest that in misdemeanor -- petty misdemeanor cases,

11

frequently the -- the people are offered a lawyer in a --

12

in a group and it's suggested that most of them don't need

13

lawyers because they're not going to jail.

14

But I submit, Justice Breyer, that the -- that

15

the real red herring in this case is treating this as a

16

petty offense.

This is not a petty --

17

QUESTION:

And it's not offense because?

18

MR. DUKE:

Because the authorized sentence in

19

this case was 1 year, which made the jury trial right --

20

guaranteed him a right to a jury trial under the Sixth

21

Amendment, and because this was a criminal prosecution.

22

QUESTION:

Now, I think what you're saying is that the

4

another ground, but I'm not sure it -- it fits within the

5

question presented.

6

MR. DUKE:

Well, I submit it does, Mr. Chief

petty offense.

Scott dealt with the question of

question here that -- that this Court should not allow

11

itself to get embroiled in it to repeat the mistake is to

12

treat this as if this is a trivial case because -- or to

put it this way, at some point someone has to ask the

question how is it that this defendant in this case had a

Then -- then I urge the Court to at

to counsel in a serious offense where, as in this case,

the defendant has a constitutional right to jury trial.
Let me just briefly quote Justice Powell, joined

16
17

18

Wherever the right to counsel line is to be drawn, it must

19

be drawn so that an indigent has a right to appointed

20

counsel in all cases where there's a right to a jury

21

trial.

22

right to a jury trial becomes meaningless.

With respect to the -- the argument that Mr.

convicted of a crime and sent to jail, without providing

This Court --

I mean, in Nichols, after all, we had

but it would be consistent with his position that counsel

be provided in that subsequent proceeding.

MR. DUKE:

And that may

Yes, but the crucial difference is

10

that the defendant under this proceeding that Mr. Fried is

be sent to jail without his guilt ever being determined in

a criminal trial in which he was represented by counsel.

Right.
Then it goes to say, we tell

12

everybody to the trial court vacate that aspect which

13

imposed the suspended jail time.

14

We reverse and we tell them to vacate.

Those are two things.

As to the first, we reverse that aspect, the

15
16

State of Alabama agrees because they were there arguing in

17

the Alabama Supreme Court that a real suspended sentence

18

that meant something could be imposed, and here you're

agree with that.

8

that is because Mr. Mills said something that I think is

9

correct when he said that the Alabama Supreme Court struck

11

and what I contend is a misapprehension of Federal law.

Now, I wanted to address one of the concerns

raised by Justice Souter as to the practicality.

There

20

are some aspects -- some statistics we know as to the

21

practicalities that are helpful, but I will admit we don't

22

know everything that we need to know.

23

are approximately 115,000 misdemeanors each year in the

24

State of Alabama.

Those are addressed in our reply brief,

25

the yellow brief.

We know that approximately 25,000 of

We don't know from

2

the administrative office of courts in Alabama how many

4

We also know in Alabama -- this is not addressed

in our brief, but I checked it with -- with information in

Let me ask you one more question.

14

And I -- I don't imagine your statistics show this, but I

15

want to pass it up.

many of those were fine-only cases, not suspended

17

sentences, but fine-only cases, and B, how many of those

19

MR. PRYOR:

20

QUESTION:

Out of the 115, do we know, A, how

Were -- were?
Were motor vehicle cases because the

21

motor vehicle cases take you out of this problem, I

22

assume, in fine situations because if the fine isn't paid,

23

the motor vehicle -- I mean, the -- the motor vehicle laws

24

simply provide a -- a purely civil administrative means of

25

And if they are a

47
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

substantial part of the 115, then the -- the fear of what

2

this will do, in fact, is somewhat -- the Alabama Supreme

3

Court's view is -- is somewhat lessened.

4

those numbers?

5

MR. PRYOR:

No, I don't.

Do you know

But -- but I do know

6

that 2,100 lawyers to take -- when we have 25,000

7

supervised probation and some number in excess of that of

8

unsupervised probation, still means that it's a daunting

9

task.

10

Justice Ginsburg, the point that you raised

11

about the cost of counsel not being incurred by more

12

affluent defendants I think is relevant from this

13

standpoint, when you consider that it is reasonable then

14

for the State to preserve its own resources, just as a

15

more affluent defendant would -- would preserve its

16

resources not to incur the cost of counsel in this kind of

17

circumstance.

18

As to the argument that Argersinger would

19

require the trial judge to inform the defendant that a

20

sentence of imprisonment will not be imposed because

21

counsel is not being appointed, that is not what

22

Argersinger or Scott require.

23

merely deprive the trial court of that remedy upon

24

conviction, but there's no requirement that the defendant

25

be informed of that.
