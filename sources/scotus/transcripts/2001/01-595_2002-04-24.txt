ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. OLSON:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

11

The Ninth Circuit has created a new

12

constitutional rule for guilty pleas that is neither

13

required by the Constitution nor warranted by this Court's

14

previous decisions.

15

complicate and expose to collateral attack confessions of

16

guilt which -- which account for approximately 95 percent

17

of all convictions in the Federal system and to stifle the

18

market for plea bargains, which this Court has described

19

as an essential component of the administration of

20

justice.

21

Its inevitable effect would be to

The Ninth Circuit held that an accused cannot

22

enter a valid guilty plea unless he is first given all

23

evidence in the prosecutor's possession which would have a

24

reasonable probability of discouraging him from pleading

25

guilty.
3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

The Ninth Circuit's rule, new rule, is not a

2

logical extension of the Brady -- Brady v. Maryland, which

3

is premised on concern over the constitutional fairness of

4

criminal trials.

5

only when necessary to ensure a fair trial.

6

Brady itself, the Court was explicit to point out that it

7

-- that decision was premised on the avoidance of an

8

unfair trial to the accused.

9

have expanded upon or interpreted or explained Brady, have

10

been even more specific with respect to the limitations on

11

the scope of Brady.

Brady and its progeny require disclosure
In fact, in

The subsequent cases, which

12

In U.S. v. Agurs, the Court said the prosecutor

13

will not have violated his constitutional duty unless his

14

omission is of sufficient significance to result in the

15

denial of a fair trial.

16

Something similar was said in U.S. v. Bagley.

17

Brady's purpose is not to displace the adversary system as

18

the primary means by which truth is uncovered.

19

not deprive a defendant of a fair trial, there is no

20

constitutional violation.

21

QUESTION:

If it did

Can we get to your main argument

22

about Brady, that is, Brady in all its aspects is a trial

23

right, not a pretrial right, in view of the plea agreement

24

in this case, which represents that you have already

25

turned over the prime Brady material and the only question

21

And so my question is, isn't that, at

MR. OLSON:

You do have the

The answer to that, Justice

22

Ginsburg, is that both in the Sanchez decision and in this

23

case, the Ruiz decision, the Ninth Circuit went further

24

and made it clear that it was applying the rule that it

25

applied in this case to all exculpatory material which, if
5
Alderson Reporting Company

further in the direction of the defendant, which often

happens.

7

sort to a defendant.

8

than that and made it clear that the rule that it was

9

enunciating applied to all exculpatory material, including

10

impeachment material, and that is the rule that's going to

11

be applicable in the Ninth Circuit.

Now, the undertaking that was made in the

Prosecutors frequently will decide, for one

But the Ninth Circuit went further

12

So, even if this Court determined to limit its

13

decision to the -- the narrower scope, as articulated in

14

the second paragraph of that proposed agreement, we'd be

15

back here next year because it's quite clear what the

16

Ninth Circuit intends to do with its rule.

MR. OLSON:

No, it was not, Mr. Chief Justice.

23

This was a -- simply a -- a draft agreement which was, in

24

fact, prepared in response -- as a result of and in

25

response to the earlier Sanchez decision, which -- which

occurred to me to --

MR. OLSON:

It's -- it's not in the record,

7

Justice Scalia, but it's my understanding that it's

8

something that is -- is developed particularly to deal

9

with the Sanchez case which the Ninth Circuit had already

10

decided, and the presumption that the Ninth -- the Ninth

11

Circuit's Sanchez decision went so far and not as far as

12

the -- that that covered the impeachment material, but not

13

other exculpatory material in the reverse.

14

So, however inartful this is, it was not in

15

response, Mr. Chief Justice, to a court order or any other

16

legal requirement, nor does it purport to articulate what

the law is.

it would ever be a justification to depart, that a

of the program to get a two-level departure.

So, how -- how do we get to your issue and what

20

do I do about those two things which seem tremendous

21

blocks?

22

MR. OLSON:

The Ninth Circuit -- let me answer

23

the jurisdictional point first.

The Ninth Circuit

24

perceived that it had jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C.

25

3742(a)(1).

Yes, in violation of law.

So, I

I'd say, what law?

MR. OLSON:

And -- and that the Ninth Circuit

7

perceived that the district court felt that it was barred

8

by law from departing --

9
10
11

QUESTION:

There isn't much I can find in this

record that says that.
MR. OLSON:

And -- and that the Ninth Circuit

12

felt that because this was a constitutional right that the

13

defendant was -- had that was being withheld from the

14

defendant because of the -- of the circumstances of this

15

case, that the -- the district court erroneously presumed

16

that it was prevented from going in a -- in a direction

17

that the Ninth Circuit felt that it could go.

18

And I think that then ties in with your second

19

-- your second question with respect to the sentencing

20

guidelines and section 5K2.

21

Ninth Circuit felt -- and it's not very clear, but -- and

22

-- and the Government is not objecting to the -- the way

23

the Ninth Circuit exercised jurisdiction at this point and

24

is not opposing the court's decision with respect to

25

jurisdiction at this point.

The Ninth Circuit felt that under section 5K2 of

2

the sentencing guidelines, this would be a -- mitigate --

3

the -- the entry into the so-called fast track program was

a mitigating circumstance of a kind or a degree not

adequately taken into account by the guidelines in

formulating the guidelines.

14

jurisdictional blocks to me.

15

We'll get to

But these look like tremendous

MR. OLSON:

It -- it -- I think the answer to

16

that latter point with respect to the individual

17

consideration is covered by the fact that this particular

18

program, under the circumstances of this district, are --

19

they may be -- it may be frequently occurring, but it's

20

individualistic in the sense that entering into this

21

program alleviates a substantial amount of work and -- and

22

provides a substantial benefit to the prosecutor in that

23

district without which the prosecutor may not be able to

24

enforce the law on all of the responsibilities of the law.

25

This is one of the most busy districts of the
10
Alderson Reporting Company

United States because of the tremendous number of

2

narcotics crimes coming in across the border, multiplied

3

in a sense by the number of immigration violations that

4

take place.

5

circumstance in that district.

6

So that this was an individualized

Now, one could quibble about the appropriateness

7

of that, but that's how the Ninth Circuit perceived it.

8

It perceived that it had jurisdiction on that basis, and

9

we're not objecting to it.

10

It seems clear that not only, therefore, that

11

not -- that this right is not required by or implicit

12

within Brady, but that the language of the Court's

13

decisions interpreting Brady make it clear that Brady is

14

not supposed to go that far, that it only has to do with

15

the rights at -- at trial.

16

Furthermore, the solution that the Ninth Circuit

17

proposed with respect to this is both overly broad and

18

underly inclusive.

19

it was and as the respondent contends it should be, with

20

the potential of innocent persons pleading guilty, the

21

test itself, which is set out in the court's -- the -- the

22

Ninth Circuit's opinion on page -- I think it's 15a of the

23

appendix to the petition for certiorari.

24

through the page, the court says, the evidence is material

25

under the test announced in this case if there is a

If the Court was concerned, as it said

reasonable probability that but for the failure to

2

disclose the Brady material, the defendant would have

3

refused to plead and would have gone to trial.

4

In other words, the test is not couched in terms

5

of the potential innocence of the defendant or the risk

6

that a defendant was -- was innocent.

terms of the tactical decision a defendant might make with

8

respect to whether or not to go trial.

of risks involved in the -- in the defense of a case, a

18

criminal case, and -- and there are risks and benefits and

19

burdens and evaluations that must be taken into

20

consideration.

The standard -- the standards for

are set forth in the -- the U.S. Attorneys Manual.

19

requires prosecutors not to bring a case unless they

20

22

That's not a

The constitutional standard is set forth in the

1

-- this Court's decisions with respect to the right to

2

counsel, the right to trial, the right to intelligent

3

information with respect to that.

4

Rule 11, which is a -- which is a joint product

5

of the courts and the -- and the legislature, sets out

6

elaborate procedures pursuant to which a Federal judge

7

will inquire with respect to the basis for the plea,

8

explain the rights that the defendant has violated, and

9

specifically requires the Federal court to find that

10

there's a factual basis for the plea.

11

Now, so that what I was saying was that is the

12

remedy, the so-called remedy, that the Ninth Circuit has

13

come up -- is -- is under-inclusive to the extent that if

14

it's concerned about -- it's over-inclusive to the extent

15

that it's concerned about innocent people pleading guilty

16

because it doesn't go to the -- the factual innocent.

17

goes to the tactical decisions, the rolling of the dice,

18

with respect to what are the chances of winning or losing

19

in court.

20

QUESTION:

It

Is this true, Mr. Solicitor General,

21

that the rolling of the dice concept can apply to an

22

innocent defendant as well?

24

who were going to identify him.

25

there, but there was somebody there who looks a lot like

3

and based on their own denial -- he doesn't have an alibi

4

And he gets an offer of a plea bargain, a very short

6

sentence.

about the lawyer trying to figure out what the odds are.

9

And so they've got a choice of either taking the

I don't suppose there's anything unethical

MR. OLSON:

Well, no, there's nothing unethical

about the lawyer trying to figure out what the odds are.

10

In fact, rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Criminal

11

Procedure give fairly elaborate rights of discovery to the

12

defendant's counsel.

13

judge will inquire with respect to whether there's a

14

factual basis for the plea agreement.

15

And at that plea agreement, the

In fact, the judge in this case specifically

16

addressed that question to the defendant, asked the

17

defendant is it, indeed, true -- asked the defendant and

18

then the counsel interceded and said, yes, she was

19

bringing in her car 60 -- 60 pounds of marijuana.

this, the plea bargain will go down the drain.

what the lawyer is supposed to do there.

5

MR. OLSON:

Now, I

Well, I don't -- I'm not sure

6

either.

It would all depend upon the circumstance.

There

7

is -- there is a possibility that this Court's recognized

8

in the Alford decision a possibility of making a plea

9

which is -- which is not incompatible with a defendant's

10

assertion of innocence.

11

the defendant is the one who will know more than anyone,

12

the prosecutor or anyone else, whether the defendant is

13

guilty.

14

QUESTION:

But I think that in most cases

Right, but I'm assuming a case in

15

which the defendant knows he's not guilty, and

16

nevertheless, there's a risk that, because the odds are so

17

heavy if you get convicted, you go away for 20 years.

18

you have a 16-month plea bargain, you may want to not take

the chance.

4

it makes it somewhat more fair in that mine run situation

5

to understand what are the chances of being convicted if I

6

do go to trial.

As you were saying, it balances the system and

MR. OLSON:

8

QUESTION:

9
10

And therefore, it

Well -That would be the argument, I think,

the other way in terms of fundamental fairness.
MR. OLSON:

And I would answer that in two ways.

11

In the first place, I think the Chief Justice answered it

12

by referring to the Brady v. United States case.

13

QUESTION:

So, you'd have to say that you're

14

right, that that isn't what Brady said.

But in taking --

15

taking into account the reality of the criminal justice

16

system, where 85 percent of the people plead guilty, and

17

the prosecutor is armed with this tremendous don't plead

18

guilty or else sentencing system, that this creates a kind

19

of basic balance that -- in terms of fairness -- I'm

20

trying to get the argument out.

21

MR. OLSON:

I understand, Justice Breyer, I

22

understand what you're saying.

And there's a certain --

23

there's a certain logic to it.

But if that is -- if that

24

was the case, then the Ninth Circuit's rule is under-

25

inclusive because if the defendant really wants to know

what the best chances are, rather than the exculpatory

2

material or the impeachment material, what he is going to

3

want to know is the inculpatory material.

4

the point about the other -- other prosecutions that are

5

being held over the defendant's head.

to know what -- well, what evidence do they have on the

greater offense that they're about to charge me with,

because I'm going to take my chances now and plead to this

lesser included offense.

And you made

So, if the Ninth Circuit wanted to accomplish

11

what you're talking about as the thrust of your question,

12

it would have gone -- and I suspect that it will --

13

QUESTION:

Well, you -- you wouldn't want it to

14

go further, would -- would you, General Olson?

15

would not want us to adopt a rule that encourages -- that

16

enables innocent people to more intelligently plead guilty

17

when they're innocent?

18

MR. OLSON:

19

QUESTION:

No.

You -- you

I'm not --

I mean, it seems to me we should do

20

everything to discourage people who are innocent from

21

pleading guilty.

22

MR. OLSON:

QUESTION:

I -- I -What kind of a legal system is this

where we're going to design our rules to encourage guilty

people to plead -- or innocent people to plead guilty?

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

It's crazy.

2

MR. OLSON:

This Court -- this Court has said

3

that it's perfectly appropriate in the adversarial system

4

for the prosecutor to find legitimate ways to encourage

5

guilty defendants to plead guilty.

6

Now, we -- you're absolutely right.

QUESTION:

It's --

We're worrying here about innocent

8

people, and we're trying to encourage them to plead guilty

MR. OLSON:

But there's --- is even contemplating such --- Justice Scalia --- such action, it seems to me.

22

drafted a rule for a hypothetical situation not involving

includes the vast number of people that are indeed guilty,

25

and under-inclusive because it doesn't provide a remedy --

Usually it is, in the Federal court systems -- that
So, you are faced with the

20
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the best remedy which we would definitely not encourage,

2

but I would suggest would be the next step, possibly from

3

the same circuit, with respect to giving additional

4

information.

5

And it would be inconsistent not only with that,

6

but it would be inconsistent with what this Court has said

7

over and over again with respect to the value of competent

8

counsel, the fact that certain chances have to be taken,

9

that a defendant is not entitled to set aside a plea

10

because he may have misconstrued the weight or balance of

11

the prosecution's case, or there may have been mistakes of

12

law.

13

fact, it was a misconstruction of whether or not the

14

defendant would -- could be -- could be put to death if

15

the defendant went to trial.

16

recognized that there are those balances in the system.

17

In one -- in -- in Brady v. the United States, in

So, this Court has

But what the -- what we urge upon the Court is

18

that there are so many protections, including the

19

discovery right, the fairly exhaustive --

20

QUESTION:

The discovery right would cover --

21

you did say there were some things that a defendant

22

perhaps would not know, and one of them you mentioned in

23

your -- in your brief is if you rob a bank and you don't

24

know whether it's FDIC insured.

25

How would that -- how would that come out pretrial?

That kind of information.

21
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. OLSON:

That would -- that would come out

2

through rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Criminal

3

Procedure, which is set out in the appendix, I think 3a to

4

5a, of our brief on the merits.

5

pretrial considerable discovery rights to find out those

6

sorts of things, and if the defendant is not sure and,

7

after consultation with his counsel, wishes to go to

8

trial, there's -- the Brady rights do kick in at an

9

appropriate time to allow the defendant to prepare for

10
11

The defendant is given

trial.
What I'm saying is that -- that the combination

12

of the constitutional rights to trial and -- and

13

confrontation, the constitutional rights to counsel, the

14

-- the statutory rights to discovery, the statutory

15

obligations on a judge to make sure there's a factual

16

basis for the guilty plea, the obligations -- and we have

17

to assume under -- as this Court suggested in the

18

Mezzanatto case, a -- a good faith behavior by our public

19

officials that a prosecutor is not going to withhold

20

evidence in -- on -- where it knows that the -- this is an

21

innocent defendant.

22

especially in the context, as this Court has said over and

23

over again, that the best person to know whether there's a

24

factual basis for a plea of guilty is the defendant

25

himself or herself.

Those are ample assurances,

22
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

I will say one more thing that is -- that seems

2

to me important with respect to the -- this -- the posture

3

in which this case comes.

4

that there is a constitutional right -- and we think that

5

neither this Court's decisions nor the Constitution would

6

lead the Court to that conclusion -- the constitutional

7

right could be waived.

8

defendant cannot, even if the defendant wanted to, plead

9

guilty.

10
11

If this Court were to determine

The Ninth Circuit said that a

Knowing that the defendant was guilty, the

defendant could not waive the right.
Now, that has several implications.

It -- it

12

creates problems for the criminal justice system.

The

13

Brady -- the Brady right that the Ninth Circuit would

14

engraft on the system here would force prosecutors to

15

develop cases and use resources at the defendant's

16

initiative, on the defendant's time table.

17

turns Brady -- the right, from a fair trial right into a

18

fair trial preparation right.

It creates --

19

With respect to certain types of cases, it would

20

compromise conspiracy cases, racketeering cases, organized

21

crime drug cases, white collar cases where there may be

22

substantial warehouses full of documents.

23

many prosecutors won't be preparing their case for

24

determining what witnesses they're going to use until

25

they're ready to go to trial.

In other words,

Once they -- if they had to
23

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

disclose this information on the defendant's time table,

2

which the defendant -- if this rule were adopted by this

3

Court, the first thing a defendant would do is offer --

4

say, "I'm thinking about pleading guilty.

5

everything in your files."

6

Give me

Now, a prosecutor in complicated cases is not going

7

to want to do that and -- and will refuse to engage in

8

that process or will -- once -- once it does so, there's

9

no more incentive for the -- for the prosecutor to enter

10

into the plea bargaining process.

11

damaging to the benefits of the defendants over and over

12

again that's received the benefits of the plea bargaining

13

system, which this Court has sanctioned and encouraged.

there's a societal and individual interest in the accuracy

of such convictions that's paramount.

And Ake indicates

The system that we have now, as has been

5

discussed already this morning funnels cases into plea

6

negotiations, and the -- the Court has said that's not a

7

bad thing, but it -- still, it funnels everybody, the

8

guilty and the innocent, into the same sort of result.

9

Innocent people are provided the same substantial and

legitimate incentives to plead guilty as guilty people

11

are.

12

And if I could return to Justice --

13

No.

I -- I object to that.

I -- I

don't think our system ever encourages or, indeed, even

permits an innocent person to plead guilty.

guilty to make sure that, indeed, the person is guilty.

18

There is nothing in our system that encourages or even

allows an innocent person to -- to plead guilty.

would be horrified if -- if there were something like

that.

individuals who are innocent do receive the same

incentives to plead guilty.

17

from various State courts at pages 10 to 11 of the brief

where individuals pled guilty where substantial material

And you are representing a guilty client and

MR. HUBACHEK:

the posture of the case, as has been discussed, is that

7

there -- this is a sentencing issue where there's a

8

request for a departure based upon the -- this fast track

9

program.

Ms. Ruiz didn't participate in the fast track

10

program because she objected to the term of the plea

They'll have to look into their witnesses, get

And under the present system, particularly in

17

drug offenses, what that means for many, many, many

18

people, guilty and innocent -- let's say guilty -- they're

19

going to go away for very long times.

20

we're transforming this system into something like a

21

European system where you can't take guilty pleas, and

22

it'd be somewhere in the middle.

23

And, anyway, the Constitution doesn't requirement --

24

require it and it would work out the worse, they say, for

25

a lot of defendants.

And therefore,

I mean, it -- it's

12

impossible for him not to know whether he was acting in

14

giving him, this innocent person, this information is to

QUESTION:

Is there -- is there any precedent

outside the Ninth Circuit that says Brady is an immediate

7

turnover right and not a preparation for trial right?

8

MR. HUBACHEK:

Yes, there is.

The Second

Circuit has adopted this rule since 1988, and again, while

10

the Solicitor General has come forward and indicated there

11

are numerous potential down sides to this type of

QUESTION:

material as well?

15

MR. HUBACHEK:

16

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

Let me go back to a variant of

17

Justice Scalia's question.

It seems to me that your

18

strongest argument is the argument that does focus on the

19

-- the supposedly innocent defendant.

20

argument that I think is strongest with respect to that

21

category is the argument that those who enter Alford pleas

22

obviously are not doing so because they want to plead

23

guilty, despite their protest of innocence, they're doing

24

it because they think they face such terrible odds that,

25

in fact, it's better for them to collapse at the beginning

And -- and the

and get it over with.

2

with exculpatory, including impeachment evidence, they are

3

less likely to do just what Justice Scalia says we, after

4

all, as a system don't want them to do.

5

And if these people are presented

My question is, do you have any indication that

6

there is such a rash of unintelligent Alford pleas going

7

on that we should modify the entire system to respond to

8

this risk of Alford pleas that, in fact, would not be

9

entered if the disclosure that you ask for were given?

10

MR. HUBACHEK:

I don't have an -- an empirical

11

study that shows how many such guilty pleas are entered.

12

I've cited on pages 10 to 11 of the respondent's brief a

13

number of cases in which there are potentially innocent

14

people who have pled guilty, individuals who didn't know,

15

for instance, that a witness saw the tire blow out on the

16

car before the car crossed over the median, indicating

17

that that person -- that the tire blowout, not the

18

person's driving was responsible for the accident.

19

Another case, the Gibson case, where the

20

prosecutor was actually told by the main identification

21

witness that she was changing her story, and that wasn't

22

turned over to the defense.

23

In the Lee case, a situation where the

24

individual was charged with an offense and told that there

25

was an identification, and it turns out that the -- the
35
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

witness misidentified him and that then the -- the witness

2

was later shown, before a preliminary hearing, a picture

3

of the defendant.

4

this risk exists.

5

So, there are cases out there in which

And if I could, I think that the -- one of the

6

problems I guess in getting across the point is that I

7

think the Solicitor General has misstated the import of

8

the Ninth Circuit's test.

9

solely a -- you know, we want to give you all the cards so

The Ninth Circuit's test is not

advice.

Well, but even -- even if you're

going to be applied and applied with your gloss, it can't

I think that the Hill v. Lockhart test, when specifically

the Hill case was discussing when defense counsel fails to

22

MR. HUBACHEK:

It -- it would expand it.

That's

correct.

However, it would expand it in only a narrow

MR. HUBACHEK:

Can I get a grasp of that by

I -- I can't direct you, Justice

18

Breyer, to any particular rule change proposals that are

19

out there.

20

Our argument is based upon the notion that

21

everyone agrees that the defendant is entitled to -- to

22

material exculpatory evidence at trial under the Fifth

23

Amendment and also that the -- that the Sixth Amendment

24

requires defense counsel to find material exculpatory

25

evidence to use at trial.
41
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Now, the -- the Sixth Amendment also requires

2

counsel to locate material exculpatory evidence before the

3

decision to make a plea is -- is made.

4

that is is so that it will be a plea that's worthy of

5

confidence.

6

Brady is -- is essentially the same as under Strickland.

7

We want a -- a proceeding that's reliable.

8
9

And the reason

And that's -- ultimately the standard under

Under the current state of the law, if defense
counsel fails to find a piece of material exculpatory

10

evidence, that guilty plea is then, therefore, going to be

11

unreliable.

12

exculpatory evidence is unavailable to counsel, but in the

13

possession of the prosecution, that conviction is

14

considered to be reliable even if the defendant doesn't

15

get the benefit of it.

16

But if the same piece of -- of material

So, what we're proposing is -- is that there is

17

a complementary action of -- of both the Fifth and Sixth

18

Amendment rights pre plea and during the trial and that if

19

there is going to be an overlap in the Fifth and Sixth

20

Amendment rights it's got to be at -- where the interest

21

that those rights protect is at its highest, and that is,

protecting the innocent from pleading guilty.

MR. HUBACHEK:

With respect to the -- the --

2

with respect to the Fifth and Sixth Amendment claim that

3

we've made, the Second Circuit has also found a different

4

theory under which the -- the Court could find a Brady

5

violation, and they've indicated that the failure to turn

6

over Brady information is essentially otherwise

7

impermissible conduct under the Brady v. United States

9

States, and I think that the Ninth Circuit's analogy to

So, Mr. Chief Justice brought up Brady v. United

10

Hill v. Lockhart and the Miller v. Angliker impermissible

12

United States v. Brady would preclude.

13

QUESTION:

But -- but, you know, to say we'll

why it's impermissible.

exculpatory information.

argument divorced from a materiality argument.

No.

Do you

No, I don't because there is

a materiality requirement in Hill v. Lockhart.

9

QUESTION:

How do we judge that materiality at

11

dealing with counsel, you can at least say, well, if -- if

12

they had been aware -- regardless of how the case would

have turned out, there's a way in which it makes sense to

say that if they had been aware of this kind of evidence,

they would have said we're going to trial.

-- the soundness of the verdict, the soundness of a

22

result.

know everything that would be in the case.

standard, and the -- and the effectiveness of counsel

say anything that would have had any tendency to exculpate

is a nonmateriality standard.

MR. HUBACHEK:

Well, Justice Souter, on page 16

11

of our brief, we have a block quote from Hill v. Lockhart,

12

and I really think that the test that was discussed in

Hill v. Lockhart covers the -- the concerns that Your

Honor is mentioning today.

15

Lockhart concludes by saying that in -- in the case of

counsel failing to discover material exculpatory

information, which is essentially the same type of problem

that we're talking about here, it says that ultimately the

assessment will depend in large part on a prediction

whether the evidence likely would have changed the outcome

But that is a different -- I mean, it

6

necessarily is a different standard from the Brady

7

standard of materiality which we have now.

8
9

MR. HUBACHEK:

Well, the Brady standard for

materiality, as was explained in Kyles, derives from

10

Strickland.

11

standard from Strickland.

12

Is it not?

Hill v. Lockhart also derives its materiality

QUESTION:

So, I think it's --

Well, let's go back to my question.

13

They -- they may have a common ancestry, but in fact they

14

are not identical tests because they are applied in

15

circumstances that are by definition very different.

16

MR. HUBACHEK:

Well, I -- I think that it's an

17

easier application post trial, but it's still the same

18

test that -- that's -- that we're being asked to apply in

19

the plea situation because Hill v. Lockhart says, look, if

20

counsel doesn't find the key piece of evidence and you

21

plead guilty, then we're going to go back and look and

22

see, well, what would have happened at a trial if you had

23

that key piece of evidence.

intelligently, we've got to know what the trial would have

2

included, won't we?

3

that the disclosure has got to go to, in effect, the

4

inculpatory evidence, or it means at the minimum, number

5

two, that the State has an opportunity to come in and say,

6

we'll tell you what the inculpatory evidence would have

7

been.

8

this context, it's not material.

9

And that either means, number one,

This is what we would have put in, and judged in

One way or the other, either -- either the

10

necessary implication of your test or the -- the

11

implication that the State would have a right to respond

12

to it, it seems implies that in order to apply your rule

13

before trial, a -- a court, reviewing one of your claims,

14

would have to make a judgment about the -- the

15

significance of the evidence in the context of -- of an

16

entire trial, a whole evidentiary record that can be --

17

that can -- can be anticipated.

MR. HUBACHEK:

Hill v. Lockhart requires.

know that trial decisions are -- are often made without

a different -- that's a different standard from Brady

MR. HUBACHEK:

QUESTION:

General Olson, you have 4 minutes remaining.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON

6

Hill is a plea case.

Thank you, Mr. Hubachek.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

7

MR. OLSON:

8

What the respondent is proposing and what the

9

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

Ninth Circuit adopted is an unworkable and undesirable

10

rule to solve a nonexistent problem.

11

by the facts of this case.

12

pages in the respondent's brief cite some cases in which

13

theoretically it might be that some driver who crossed the

14

line earlier might create a problem, but that is not this

15

case.

16

evidence in the record that would show that there's a

17

significant problem here.

18

And it's illustrated

The footnote or the -- the

And there's no empirical evidence or any other

QUESTION:

The --

Mr. Olson, would you address again

19

the jurisdictional problem here?

20

the district court judge had discretion about what

21

sentence to impose and could have -- and did exercise that

22

discretion, do we have to be concerned about --

23

MR. OLSON:

I mean, if -- if in fact

I think that is not an easy

24

situation, but I think that the Ninth Circuit believed

25

that however inartfully the district court expressed it or
52
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

incompletely the district court expressed it, that the --

2

that the district court was saying it didn't feel that it

3

had the capacity or the ability under the law to depart,

4

that it didn't have the discretion to do so.

5

the Ninth Circuit decided.

6

Ninth Circuit --

7

QUESTION:

could mean that, I suppose.

9

but it could --

11

MR. OLSON:

We argued otherwise to the

I guess this is not a proper case

8

10

That's what

I wouldn't put it that way,

It could mean that.

That's how the

Ninth Circuit -- Circuit perceived it.

12

QUESTION:

I'd even attempt not to say anything

13

about it, so long as I was not certain that there was no

14

jurisdiction.

15

MR. OLSON:

We -- we believe that we -- after

16

looking at it carefully, we've decided that the Ninth

17

Circuit probably was right under the circumstances,

18

although you could argue it the other way, and that this

19

-- this is an issue that is presented clearly with respect

20

to the -- the legal standard that's been adopted to the --

21

by the Ninth Circuit and which is in play today.

22

The -- the respondent says, well, pleas are

23

proceeding apace in California notwithstanding -- or in

24

the Ninth Circuit, notwithstanding the decision in this

25

case.

There is no evidence in the record to suggest that
53
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

this hasn't created a problem, and in fact, I'm informed

2

that there are cases that have not been brought and cases

3

that have been dismissed because of a concern about

4

complying with the rule in this case, because once that's

5

done, those cases are -- are potentially over with.

6

the fact is there's no evidence either way.

7

But

Justice Breyer, you raised some questions about

8

whether we would be constitutionalizing a rule which would

9

change Jencks and change the discovery rules.

There --

10

there -- on page 26 of the Government's brief, we talked

11

about the fact that there have been efforts to change and

12

accelerate the discovery requirements and that those have

13

been soundly rejected for the very reasons we've been

14

talking about here.

15

because there's very much concern over the safety of

16

witnesses when those statements are produced earlier in

17

the case.

18

quite consciously that those statements don't have to be

19

produced until the witness is actually called in trial for

20

that reason.

21

And the Jencks standard is what it is

And that's -- Congress has made that decision

Let me finish by saying that with respect to

22

Hill v. Lockhart, that's a case involving a requirement

23

that a defendant have, under the Sixth Amendment,

24

competent counsel within the range of -- of competence

25

expected for counsel in criminal cases.

That's a Sixth

54
Alderson Reporting Company

1

Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel.

2

not a -- a constitutional right to effective assistance of

3

the prosecution in deciding whether to plead guilty or

4

not.

5

It is

What we have in this case is a rule which is not

6

required, which -- which would cause considerable

7

problems.

8

which is important to the administration of criminal

9

justice in this country, and affect the finality of guilty

10

pleas, which is an important consideration as well.

11
12

It would undermine the plea bargaining system,

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Thank you, General

Olson.

The case is submitted.
