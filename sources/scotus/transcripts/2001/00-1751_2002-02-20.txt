ORAL ARGUMENT OF JUDITH L. FRENCH

ON BEHALF OF THE STATE PETITIONERS

10

12

MS. FRENCH:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
In 1995, the Ohio General Assembly responded to

13

an unprecedented educational crisis by enacting the Ohio

14

Scholarship and Tutorial Program.

15

decisions, especially Mueller, Witters, and Zobrest, and

16

in light of this Court's teachings, most recently in

17

Agostini and Mitchell, the Ohio program is constitutional

18

because it offers a neutral program that offers true

19

private choice to parents.

20

Under this Court's

First, the principle of neutrality.

There are two

21

criteria that determine where the benefits will go under

22

QUESTION:

Well, do you -- you don't take the

position that that guarantees constitutionality, do you?

3

MS. FRENCH:

4

QUESTION:

5

MS. FRENCH:

6

QUESTION:

We do not, Your Honor.
Okay.
We have a two-pronged approach.
You take it as a necessary condition,

7

but not a sufficient condition?

8

MS. FRENCH:

9

We do, Your Honor.

We offer both

neutrality and true private choice, but even beyond the

10

basic elements of neutrality, there are a number of

11

provisions within this program that guarantee that it's

12

open to all-comers, both in terms of students and schools.

13

First, the program requires schools not to

14

discriminate based on race, religion, or ethnic origin,

15

that ensures that even a religious school may not

16

discriminate in favor of students of their own religious

17

faith.

18
19
20

QUESTION:

And you think it would be

unconstitutional if it didn't have that -MS. FRENCH:

Not necessarily, Your Honor, but it

21

certainly goes to the neutrality of the program, but even

22

beyond the --

23

QUESTION:

Well, why does it matter?

I mean, if

24

they're proselytizing, doesn't it make good sense for them

25

to admit anybody who may come along, and yet the

MS. FRENCH:

We, of course, Your Honor, do you

agree that they're proselytizing.

6

the parents, not at the behest of the Government, and

7

perhaps I should move to the second prong, then, and talk

8

about --

QUESTION:

10
11

MS. FRENCH:

Whatever proselytizing

Well -- go ahead.
And talk about the true private

choice that is at issue here for the parents.

12

QUESTION:

Well, but I take it that the first

13

part of your argument as demonstrated is to try to show

14

that there are certain indexes, indicia of neutrality.

15

MS. FRENCH:

16

QUESTION:

17
18

Correct.
And you just -- and you tick them

off.
MS. FRENCH:

Yes, Your Honor.

Yes, that there

19

is the Nondiscrimination Clause, and secondly that there

20

is a cap on the number of students that -- who are already

21

in the program, and the limit on the number who can

22

continue in the program.

QUESTION:

What percentage of the students in

MS. FRENCH:

Well, there are 57,000 students,

Honor.

QUESTION:

MS. FRENCH:

In 1999 the number was 3,700.

It's

now about 3,4 --

12
13

About how many thousand get

scholarships, 2,000?

10
11

About 4,000 of them get scholarships.

QUESTION:

So it's about 10 percent of the

student body?

MS. FRENCH:

Yes, Your Honor, a little less than

15

10 percent, but all the students in the Cleveland School

District are eligible.

true private choice available for receiving the benefits.

2

Here, Cleveland parents have a number of alternatives

available to them.

4

Schools --

5

They can stay in the Cleveland Public

QUESTION:

May I ask you a question about

6

private choice which is a very important part of the case?

7

Supposing you had a situation with a small community that

8

had one public school and one religious school, and they

9

would pay for the voucher to go to the religious school if

10

the family on its own private choice wanted the child to

11

go to the religious school.

12

in that case?

13

MS. FRENCH:

14

QUESTION:

15

MS. FRENCH:

16

QUESTION:

Would that save the program

I think it would, Your Honor -Yes.
-- given -- if -- of course -So in this case it's irrelevant,

17

really, that there are four or five choices available, as

18

long as there's a free choice either to go to the public

19

school or to go to the religious school?

20
21

MS. FRENCH:

Well, we have a number of choices

within the traditional public schools, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

But they're not -- it's not necessary

They are not necessary, Your Honor.

the entire -- viewed as a whole of the program.

2

instance, in Rosenberger, Justice Powell's decision in

3

Witters --

4

QUESTION:

For

In Witters, there's such a dramatic

5

difference between a choice from the great universe of

6

colleges and universities, what a particular student will

7

choose, and here, the difference -- you just explained to

8

Justice Stevens that maybe it doesn't matter.

9

difference is that in fact there is only one alternative,

The

10

if you don't take account of the community schools, the

11

suburban schools say no, they don't want any part of this,

12

private schools can't make it on that low tuition, so in

13

fact, isn't it true that something like 99 percent of the

14

students who were receiving these vouchers are in

15

religious schools?

16

MS. FRENCH:

That's currently true, Your Honor.

17

That number has fluctuated over the years of the program.

18

It's fluctuated a great deal from 1995 to this year.

19

That's true.

20

QUESTION:

May I ask why we don't take account

21

of the availability of the community schools in analyzing

22

this program?

23
24
25

MS. FRENCH:

We would like the Court to take

very much account of the community schools, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

The court below didn't do that.

MS. FRENCH:

2

QUESTION:

3

Is that an option, in fact, to the

parents?

4

MS. FRENCH:

5

QUESTION:

6

That's correct, Your Honor.

Very much so, Your Honor.
And the tuition assistance would be

provided if the selection were for a community school?

7

MS. FRENCH:

There would be no tuition

8

assistance, Your Honor, only because they are public

9

schools, so there's no need for a scholarship there.

10

Parents can choose a traditional public school, they can

11

choose a tutoring grant if they're in a public school,

12

they can choose a magnet school, they can choose a

13

community school, or --

14

QUESTION:

And if a community school is

15

selected, no additional money then is provided, as would

16

be provided if the religious school were selected?

17

MS. FRENCH:

That's true, Your Honor.

If the

18

parent chooses a community school, because it's considered

19

a public school, there is no money exchanged.

only --

QUESTION:

It's

Have some of the private nonsectarian

schools in the city become community schools?
MS. FRENCH:

They have, Your Honor.

two schools in particular who in 1997 chose to be

community schools rather than be in the scholarship

2
3

QUESTION:

Because they get more money.

Because

they get more money.

4

MS. FRENCH:

In part because they get more

money, and in part because of the uncertainty of the

6

litigation.

7

a result of the litigation that's been going on in some

8

form since 1995.

Are slots available in the community

Can you get a tutoring grant if you

go to a community school?
MS. FRENCH:

Yes, Your Honor, you can.

As long

19

as you're in a public school, and that would include

20

community or magnet schools, you're eligible for a

QUESTION:

2

the public school system is deplorable.

3

there of these community schools, of whether they are a

4

better choice to educate the child than the regular public

5

schools?

6

MS. FRENCH:

What evidence is

I would direct the Court to two

7

places in the record, particularly the joint appendix.

8

One is the affidavit of Mr. Puckett, which is at 157a,

9

which simply describes what a community school is, the

10

number of schools that are available, the number of spaces

11

that are available.

12

Peterson, at approximately 98 of the joint appendix, a

13

very lengthy affidavit that describes the different kinds

14

of options available and what their benefits are.

15

There is also the affidavit of Paul

The benefit for a community school is, it is

16

considered a public school.

17

accountability that might not be there with respect to a

18

private school, but for a parent who's looking for an

19

alternative to the public schools, that might be a good

20

option for them.

21

QUESTION:

There is some amount of

Is there a description of the precise

22

community schools that are participating in the program,

23

and the quality of education in those schools?

25

MS. FRENCH:

There is to the first part of your

question, Your Honor, and that's in Mr. Puckett's

affidavit, of just describing what the schools are, why we

2

have them in Ohio.

3

just for Cleveland.

that was implemented in 1997, and was specifically

5

complemented by the district court in a desegregation

6

order relating to Cleveland as an option for Cleveland

7

parents.

8

10

It's a State-wide program.

QUESTION:

It's not

It's actually a State-wide program

Is there information in the record

available about the quality of the religiously affiliated
schools?

11

MS. FRENCH:

There are a number of studies that

12

have been done both in Cleveland and with respect to other

13

scholarship programs, Your Honor.

14

specifically to, again to Mr. Peterson's affidavit at 105

15

to 107 in the joint appendix.

16

QUESTION:

17

I would point

I mean about these particular schools

in the program.

18

MS. FRENCH:

Yes, Your Honor, in general the

19

scholarship program, not just specifically the religious

20

schools, but the voucher, or the scholarship program as a

21

whole, as to whether the students are showing academic

22

achievement or, you know, significant results beyond that.

23

Yes, there are, but not specific, again, to the religious

1

schools, when the State calculates the funding that goes

2

to the community schools, it takes account of the number

3

of students that go to the community schools, I take it?

4

MS. FRENCH:

5

QUESTION:

6

Oh, yes, Your Honor.
And there's a figure of something

like $5,000 --

7

MS. FRENCH:

8

QUESTION:

9

MS. FRENCH:

Yes.
-- per student.
Right.

It's not quite that.

$4,500 to $5,000.

It's

10

calculated on the basis of the normal State aid number

11

that a public school would receive for educating a child

12

and, again, it's a per capita kind of number.

13

QUESTION:

Does the same amount of money per

14

capita go to a community school as would go to the regular

15

public school?

16

MS. FRENCH:

Yes, Your Honor, approximately.

17

There's a slightly different amount, but it's

18

approximately the same as the State aid number.

19

QUESTION:

May I ask you if this Court would

20

have to overrule the Nyquist case to support your

21

position?

22

It certainly points the other way, doesn't it?
MS. FRENCH:

It does point the other way, Your

23

Honor, but we think that there are a number of

24

distinctions which this Court has drawn between the

25

programs at issue, say, in Mueller and Witters that
14

distinguish it from the New York program at issue in

2

Nyquist.

3

The New York program took a class of

4

beneficiaries, that is, the students already within the

5

private schools, and offered them a benefit.

6

program approaches the problem very differently.

7

approaches the problem from all of the schoolchildren in

8

Ohio, or in the Cleveland Public School System, and offers

9

them a benefit which --

10
11
12

QUESTION:

The Ohio
It

How does that change the legal

concern about the Establishment Clause?
MS. FRENCH:

Well, this Court has pointed to

13

specifically footnote 38, where the Court reserved

14

judgment in the Nyquist decision for programs that offered

15

a benefit, the specific example was scholarships there,

16

and offered to a broad base of beneficiaries without

17

regard to the nonpublic or public or nonsectarian,

18

sectarian nature of the institutions benefited, which is

19

precisely what is happening here.

20

QUESTION:

Well, but doesn't that simply then go

21

back to this neutrality point, and you're saying because

22

it's neutral, in the sense that it's offered in an even-

23

handed way, query -- your friends on the other side

24

dispute that, but just accepting that categorization,

25

because it's neutral in that sense, that's a distinction
15

1

which ought to make a difference in the result.

2

But as you agreed earlier, the neutrality that

3

you're talking about is a necessary condition, but it's

4

not a sufficient condition of constitutionality, and at

5

the end of the day, I think what's bothering me about

6

Nyquist and, I suspect, Justice O'Connor, too, is that

7

Nyquist depended not merely on a question of neutrality,

8

but on the effect, and at the end of the day, the effect

9

is a massive amount of money into religious schools in

10

Nyquist, a massive amount of money into religious schools

11

here.

12

That, I think, is the sticking point here.
MS. FRENCH:

We, of course, disagree, Your

13

Honor, that there is a massive amount going to religious

14

schools as a result of something that the Government is

15

doing.

16

It's true, it's very true -QUESTION:

Well, your adding a term as a result

17

of what the Government is doing, which is a separate issue

18

as to what the significance is of the private choice, but

19

the effect that Nyquist was concerned with, and the effect

20

that I think has been shown here, is a substantial amount

21

of money, aid to the schools themselves, in relation to

22

the amount of money spent on the program, and in those

23

respects the two are identical.

24

MS. FRENCH:

25

Well, in that respect, Your Honor,

there's no question that there is money that is ending up

1

in religious institutions, because that's what the parents

2

have chosen, but that nondiscrimination provision that I

3

spoke of earlier did not exist in Nyquist.

4

schools at issue in Nyquist could discriminate based on

5

religion, and that, of course, means that the program, the

6

New York program was not open to all-comers.

7

QUESTION:

The New York

Well, Miller also made the point, I

8

think, that where the parents do the choosing, as they did

9

not do in Nyquist, it was a different ball game.

10

MS. FRENCH:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

In

11

Mueller, of course, the percentage of religious schools or

12

the number of parents receiving benefit because they paid

13

QUESTION:

Here, the difference would be,

however, that according to respondents the choices are

MS. FRENCH:

That's true, Your Honor, but in

Mueller the Court did address that concern, as Justice

Powell said in his concurrence in Witters, that it didn't

matter that there was only one person, Mr. Witters, using

the money for seminary, for the Inland Empire School of

only one child or one parent, set of parents for a child

I suppose part of the design of the

MS. FRENCH:

19

QUESTION:

Absolutely, Your Honor.
May I ask you about your suggestion

that in Nyquist, it's a difference when the parents do the

choosing, but who chose where the children would go to

Did the parents make the decision?

it's different in that we fall under the question that was

QUESTION:

Of course, the amount of money is

MR. YOUNG:

Your Honor, there is a difference,

3

MR. YOUNG:

Thank you, Your Honor.

There is no

4

governmental endorsement of religion in this program, and

5

there are several reasons why there isn't.

6

Your Honor, reason would be the amount of money that is

7

spent, first of all, on a public school education, which

8

is approximately $8,000, the amount of money paid for a

9

community secular education, $4,500, and the maximum

10

amount provided to a family that selects a nonpublic

11

school, $2,250.

The first,

12

So if -- the first thing you look at is the amount of

13

money that is spent depending on the nature of choice made

14

by the child, and the preference, the -- in that instance

15

is clearly a preference for the secular schools.

16

Secondly, Your Honor, if you look at the

17

history, as well as the context of this particular

18

program, this program was adopted because of one of the

19

most serious educational, public school crises in the

20

United States, and I think anyone trying to determine what

21

was the Government doing, was it endorsing religion, no.

22

The Government was trying to permit low income

23

educationally disadvantaged children who were trapped in a

24

failing system to exercise an alternate choice.

25

So I think any person -- the Cleveland district

has been in litigation, Your Honor, for some 20-plus

2

years, in Federal court, because of the difficulties that

3

have been encountered in the public school system.

4

think anyone looking at this legislation as it was adopted

and as it was implemented would conclude that there is

certainly no Government endorsement of religion.

QUESTION:

Well, there's really no record on the

MR. YOUNG:

record in affidavits in terms of the creation of the

community schools, the transfer of the two secular

14

scholarship schools to community school status.

15

children who were enrolled as scholarship pupils in the

scholarship secular schools just transferred when those

schools became community schools, so this legislation

clearly enabled the same children, the same low income,

GENERAL OLSON:

That's correct, Justice

O'Connor, but the Court has made the point in connection

19

with those types of programs that there's a significant

20

difference between a direct aid program, where funds are

21

going from the Government to the school, as opposed to the

22

private, genuinely independent, purely private choice

programs where the choices are being made by individual

the best education for their children.

you think these alternatives are essential from a

constitutional point of view, or would you make the same

argument if there were merely the one choice, religious

school or the private school?

GENERAL OLSON:

I think applying the standards

12

this Court has adopted, that if the criteria are

13

neutral -- and I'm answering -- I'm saying yes.

The criteria is neutral.

QUESTION:

Why don't we -- why don't you --

2

well, I know why you don't stress, but why shouldn't we

stress as one of those facts the bottom line of 96 percent

of the kids taking the tuition aid, or taking it in

6

GENERAL OLSON:

7

QUESTION:

Well --

And doesn't that suggest that there

8

is perhaps something specious about this notion that it's

9

a matter of wide-open choice here?

In practical terms,

10

the money is going to end up where it ends up, and the 96-

11

percent figure is pretty persuasive.

12

GENERAL OLSON:

That was the same factor in the

13

Mueller case, and one of the other cases that has been

14

cited, the Court said that is not of constitutional

15

significance.

16

We're not going to --

QUESTION:

Oh, I'm asking you a question about

17

practical significance, and why do we eliminate that fact

18

from our judgment about what in the real world seems to be

going on?

20

GENERAL OLSON:

Because those choices this Court

21

has said are the result of purely private choices, and

that that will not be associated by a reasonable observer

with a governmental decision.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS SIMMONS-HARRIS, ET AL.

MR. CHANIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Under the Cleveland voucher program, millions of

6

dollars of unrestricted public funds are transferred each

7

year from the State Treasury into the general coffers of

8

sectarian private schools and the money is used by those

9

schools to provide an educational program in which the

10

sectarian and the secular are interwoven.

11

that, if those funds are properly attributable to the

12

State, the program violates the Establishment Clause.

13

It is

a given

We submit that the answer to that attribution

14

question is yes, and it is yes because, regardless of the

15

decision that individual parents may make, it is

16

inevitable, it is a mathematical certainty that almost all

17

of the students will end up going to religious schools

that provide a religious education --

QUESTION:

I don't understand either point, to

tell you the truth.

I mean, if you want to look at what

7

thing?

9

MR. CHANIN:

Your Honor, this Court has always

been program-specific in its financial aid cases.

In

10

Nyquist, the Court looked at three separate programs under

11

the one statute, viewed them all in independent terms, and

12

viewed them all independently of whatever else was going

13

on in the New York City Public Schools and New York State.

QUESTION:

But I'm not sure that's proper.

That's what I'm asking you.

of the options open to the parents in having their

17

children educated?

18

MR. CHANIN:

Why should we not look at all

Because what that does, Your Honor,

19

is, it mixes together programs that are quite

20

qualitatively different in both function and purpose.

21

magnet schools, the charter schools, the tutorial program,

22

those are all ways in which the State is attempting to

discharge its basic legal obligation to provide a public

education for all of its students.

Mr. Chanin was saying, you had a determination sometime

under Ohio's own constitution.

say that the inner city parochial schools, which spend

What I am saying is that in the midst of

Ohio's efforts, which are almost completed, to resolve

11

whether Mr. Justice Scalia has the answer or not, the

12

great core problem of public education in Ohio, in the

13

midst of that, they come slicing across this situation,

14

having held their own system unconstitutional in 1997, and

15

they create this voucher program.

16

Well, there we are.

We're served up with a

17

voucher program, so we look at it, and looking at it, we

18

have argued, and Mr. Chanin has sufficiently covered that,

19

that it is unconstitutional, and we think their effort to

20

defend it is somewhat slap-dash, especially, for example,

21

when they try to defend proselytization in a few hasty

22

paragraphs, overturning 50 years of precedent, as they

23

would hope, and saying proselytization with Government

money is okay, where we say that the law since 1948 has

25

been to the contrary, and that's because this voucher

11

Thank you, Mr. Frankel.

MS. FRENCH:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, I

have four points.

13

First and foremost, the Ohio supreme court

14

upheld the constitutionality of this program under the

15

Establishment Clause, and approved its use as one solution

16

for solving the problem in Cleveland and for any school

17

district that might find itself in a similar unfortunate

18

situation.

Second, it appears that respondents have either

20

ignored or do not accept the last 20 years or so of this

Court's jurisprudence.

Finally, it is apparent from the Court's
questions and respondents' arguments that the Ohio general

assembly had a number of competing and conflicting

11

considerations before it in the face of and in an

12

environment of an educational crisis it needed to solve,

13

and to solve quickly.

14

It didn't take too much money away from the public

schools, but gave enough for a limited program that is

targeted to the most needy, the poorest of the poor, the

low income students who would not otherwise have choice.

the decision of the Sixth Circuit and uphold this program.
