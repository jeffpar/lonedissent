CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

The National Labor Relations Board.

Mr. McCortney.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RYAN D. McCORTNEY

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. McCORTNEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The issue in this case is whether the award of

12

back pay to an undocumented alien who never was legally

13

present or legally authorized to work in this country

14

conflicts with this Court's holding in Sure-Tan or with

15

this country's immigration laws and policies.

16

In Sure-Tan, this Court held that the

17

discriminatees in that case must be deemed unavailable for

18

work and the accrual of back pay therefore tolled during

19

any period when they were not lawfully entitled to be

20

present and employed in the United States.

21

The Sure-Tan Court's back pay limitation is

22

consistent with INA's dual requirement that to be employed

23

in this country an alien must be both legally present and

24

legally authorized to work.

25

requirement, the board contends that Castro is entitled to

Despite this dual

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

back pay even though he never was legally present or

2

legally authorized to work during the back pay period.

3

The fatal flaw in the board's position lies in

4

its adherence to its physical availability doctrine.

The

5

board contends that this Court denied back pay to the

6

discriminatees in Sure-Tan only because they had left the

7

country and were physically unavailable for work.

8

board is right, the Sure-Tan discriminatees could have

9

illegally reentered the country to establish physical

If the

10

presence and to commence the accrual of back pay.

11

However, such reentry would violate the immigration laws

12

of this country and be contrary to this Court's holding in

13

Sure-Tan.
QUESTION:

14

Have the immigration laws changed at

15

all in any relevant respects since our decision in Sure-

16

Tan?
MR. McCORTNEY:

17
18

IRCA in 1986.
QUESTION:

19
20
21

Yes, Your Honor, the passage of

And what relevant changes did IRCA

make?
MR. McCORTNEY:

IRCA was an amendment to the INA

22

that made the employment, the knowing employment of

23

undocumented aliens unauthorized from the employer's

24

perspective.

25

QUESTION:

And is it correct that when Sure-Tan

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

was argued, IRCA, if that's the way you pronounce it, was

2

being considered by Congress and the Government in its

3

argument told us that if IRCA had been passed, back pay

4

would not be available?

5

MR. McCORTNEY:

6

Recognizing, as it must, that this Court in

7

Sure-Tan conditioned the accrual of back pay on legal

8

presence, the board contends that the Sure-Tan Court

9

sought only to deter the discriminatees from illegally

10
11

That's correct, Your Honor.

reentering this country to claim back pay.
QUESTION:

Well, when you say conditioned it on

12

legal presence, I mean, in fact they were not present.

13

mean, the people in that case were still out of the

14

country, weren't they?

15

MR. McCORTNEY:

16

QUESTION:

17
18

That's correct, Your Honor.

So you have to acknowledge that it

was dictum.
MR. McCORTNEY:

Well, Your Honor, I would not

19

call it dicta only because the Court set forth the

20

conditions upon which the discriminatees might receive

21

back pay if they were to legally reenter the country.

22

I

QUESTION:

That's right, but it only had to say

23

one condition in order to decide the case.

Namely, you

24

had to be in the country, and it went on to say, and in

25

addition you have to be available to work, but that is

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

really unnecessary to the decision.

2

MR. McCORTNEY:

Well, the threshold condition

3

was legal reentry, and that was the starting point of the

4

analysis.

5

would have to establish at the back pay hearing --

If they were to reenter, then of course they

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. McCORTNEY:

8

QUESTION:

9

Mr. McCortney --- legal authorization to work.

If that is so, then why did the Court

make the comment on page 901 of the opinion in

10

footnote 11, talking about the board has said it will make

11

it an arbitrary number of weeks, and the Court said the

12

board has never attempted to impose a back pay award that

13

the employer must pay regardless of the actual evidence as

14

to such issues as the employee's availability to work?

15

All of that would have been unnecessary if it were just

16

this blanket rule, right?

17

MR. McCORTNEY:

Well, Your Honor, I think in

18

footnote 11 what the Court was addressing was the minimum

19

back pay award of 6 months that the court of appeals had

20

imposed and the board had adopted, and then the board

21

tried to defend that award by arguing that it had in other

22

cases had estimates of back pay, despite the fact that the

23

discriminatee was unable to establish with any certainty

24

the probable length of the back pay period.

25

I think the Court there was simply saying that,

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

look, you don't even go so far as to provide any showing

2

of proof as to how long these discriminatees would have

3

worked before their apprehension by the INS, but we don't

4

read that to mean that had those discriminatees in Sure-

5

Tan remained in the country, that they would have been

6

entitled to back pay, because they wouldn't have been

7

legally present and legally authorized to work.

8
9
10
11
12

QUESTION:

Well, if the opinion in Sure-Tan we

think equivocal, if it's a wash either way, what is your
principal argument for reversal here?
MR. McCORTNEY:

Assuming that Sure-Tan is

equivocal?

13

QUESTION:

Yes.

14

MR. McCORTNEY:

That the board's award of back

15

pay conflicts with the immigration laws and policies of

16

this country as embodied in the INA and IRCA.

17

QUESTION:

Well, what do you say the argument

18

that the board makes that even if the dictum in Sure-Tan

19

were a holding as you say it should be treated, that the

20

statute has changed the landscape, and that the board's

21

rule in effect is in aid of the statute, because the board

22

is saying the illegality on the part of the employer comes

23

when the employer knowingly employs these people despite

24

knowledge of their illegal character, so in effect we're

25

going to say that the obligation to pay back pay stops

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

when the employer knows that the alien in fact is

2

illegally there.

3

Up to that point, however, we're going to follow

4

a different policy.

We're going to make the employer pay

5

back pay because otherwise we would make it very easy for

6

employers.

7

employers to ignore the law by, in effect, winking at

8

illegality on the part of the workers, so the board is

9

saying, sure, the statute changed the legal landscape even

We would, in fact, create an inducement for

10

on your reading of Sure-Tan, and we've come up with what

11

seems to be a sensible way of implementing it.

12

your response to that?

13

MR. McCORTNEY:

What is

Your Honor, just the mere

14

prospect of receiving back pay in this case encouraged

15

Castro to extend his illegal stay by more than 4 years and

16

to continue using --

17

QUESTION:

Well, I think you're right, but the

18

board is saying, yes, there's that inducement on one side,

19

but there's a very powerful employer inducement if we come

20

out the other way, and although I don't think the board

21

put it in these words, I take it the board is saying, we

22

think the employers are going to make a rational decision

23

about inducements more clearly or more obviously than

24

employees, the illegal aliens might do, so we're going to

25

prefer the inducement or the policy that is going to have

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the strongest effect on the employers.

2

permissible choice for the board to make?

3

MR. McCORTNEY:

Isn't that a

No, Your Honor.

The board's

4

authority here is to enforce the provisions of the

5

National Labor Relations Act to the extent that they do

6

not conflict with the immigration laws and policies of

7

this country, and --

8
9

QUESTION:
it both ways.

But the board is saying we can't have

No matter which way we go, something we do

10

would provide an inducement to violate the immigration

11

laws.

12

to go is to concentrate on inducements on the employer.

13

We think probably the best way to get where we want

MR. McCORTNEY:

Your Honor, I don't believe that

14

those, the deterrence of the employer to -- that knowingly

15

hires illegal aliens or employs them, that awarding back

16

pay is necessary in light of the sanctions under IRCA that

17

now subject employers that do so to civil and criminal

18

sanctions, and so --

19

QUESTION:

Wouldn't it also be the case that if

20

the employer, by reason of this inducement, hired --

21

supposed inducement -- hired somebody whom he knew at the

22

time of the hiring to be an unlawful, an illegal alien,

23

even applying the board's rule, he wouldn't have to pay

24

any back pay.

25

MR. McCORTNEY:

That's correct, Your Honor.

Alderson Reporting Company

1

QUESTION:

What is -- here -- I think Justice

2

Souter is -- we said in our cases just what Justice Souter

3

said, I take it, INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, quoting what Sure-

4

Tan says.

5

practice in his dealings with an alien, notwithstanding

6

the alien's illegal presence in this country.

7

with that.

8

may accordingly be imposed by the board to further the

9

public policy against unfair labor practices.

10

An employer can be guilty of an unfair labor

You agree

Retrospective sanctions against the employer

Now, those -- that's what the Court said.

Now,

11

this is a retrospective policy, a retrospective sanction

12

of a compromise variety only for the period where the

13

employer is not committing any labor law, any immigration

14

law violation in order to further the labor policy.

15

doesn't this fit within the two sentences that I just

16

described?

17

MR. McCORTNEY:

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. McCORTNEY:

20
21

Because --

And if this doesn't, what would?
Your Honor, what it doesn't

address is the violation of the INA.
QUESTION:

I'm sorry.

What the Court said in

22

the sentences I read is, retrospective -- I take it,

23

retrospective sanctions can be assessed by the board.

24

Now, are we -- now, I want to know, if they

25

Why

can't do this, what can they do retrospectively, or is the

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

sentence I just read you by this Court wrong?

2

MR. McCORTNEY:

Your Honor, I think what the

3

sentence means, at least my reading of it, is that

4

retrospective sanctions may be imposed, but not

5

necessarily, and --

6

QUESTION:

Fine.

7

QUESTION:

What other rules are there, is

8

what -- what other retrospective sanctions are there?

9

QUESTION:

Yes.

11

QUESTION:

Can the board fine the employer?

12

MR. McCORTNEY:

13

QUESTION:

10

14

Thank

you.

No, Your Honor.

What else can the board do to punish

the employer for the unfair labor practice?
MR. McCORTNEY:

15
16

Yes, that's correct.

A cease and desist order, as in

this case, with the threat of contempt sanctions.

17

QUESTION:

That's a prospective --

18

QUESTION:

I would have called that prospective.

19

QUESTION:

-- sanction, isn't it?

20

MR. McCORTNEY:

21

QUESTION:

22

25

So you really don't have any

explanation for that language.
MR. McCORTNEY:

23
24

Yes.

All I would say, Your Honor, is

that -QUESTION:

Which is, I suppose your explanation

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

is that that's as much dictum as your opponent says Sure-

2

Tan was.

3

MR. McCORTNEY:

That's correct, Your Honor.

4

QUESTION:

So it's a wash, right?

5

QUESTION:

Well, if that's the explanation, I

6

take it that Sure-Tan was dealing with a case where the

7

employer did know in respect to the sanction that the

8

employee, the alien, was illegal, so Sure-Tan did not

9

consider the kind of sanction here at issue, which is a

10

sanction that applies only to the period where the

11

employer did not know that the employee was an illegal,

12

hence the employer was not violating the immigration law.

13

MR. McCORTNEY:

It still doesn't address, Your

14

Honor, the fact that the illegal presence and the use of

15

fraudulent documents and working without authorization is

16

a violation of the INA.

17

QUESTION:

Is it unlawful?

That's the question

18

I was going to ask you.

19

is it only the employer who is violating the law when he

20

hires, with knowledge, an illegal alien, or is it also the

21

case that an illegal alien who deceives an employer by

22

providing a false green card and who then draws pay when

23

he's illegally in the country, is that unlawful?

24

MR. McCORTNEY:

25

QUESTION:

Is -- under the immigration laws,

Yes, Your Honor.

Now, I know --

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

I thought --

2

QUESTION:

-- the use of the green card is, but

3

is the working and getting pay unlawful under the

4

immigration laws?

5

MR. McCORTNEY:

6

QUESTION:

Yes, it is.

I thought IRCA itself enacted a

7

provision making it illegal for aliens to provide false

8

documentation to get employment.

9

when Sure-Tan was decided, was it?

10

MR. McCORTNEY:

That wasn't in the law

Yes, it was, Your Honor.

In

11

fact, let me just explain that 18 U.S.C. 1546 was already

12

on the books, that prohibited the use of fraudulent

13

documents for immigration purposes, and when IRCA came

14

along it amended the INA but added 1324(c), which also

15

prohibits the use of fraudulent documents to obtain

16

employment, so at the time that Sure-Tan was decided, you

17

had the following laws in this case that were violated by

18

Mr. Castro, regardless of IRCA:

19

illegally in violation of 8 U.S.C. 1325, failing to

20

register as an alien within 30 days of his entry, a

21

violation of 8 U.S.C. 1302, using fraudulent documents to

22

obtain employment, a violation of 18 U.S.C. 1546,

23

remaining in this country illegally and working without

24

authorization, a violation of 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(5), which

25

was formerly 8 U.S.C. 11 --

entering a country

Alderson Reporting Company

1

QUESTION:

Now, did IRCA add provisions and

2

impose obligations on prospective employers to require

3

them to review the documents and make sure that they

4

appear to be regular on their face?

5

MR. McCORTNEY:

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. McCORTNEY:

8

QUESTION:

9
10
11

Yes, Your Honor.

And that was a new provision?
That was a new provision.

And is there any allegation in this

case that the employer failed to comply with that?
MR. McCORTNEY:

No, Your Honor.

It's

undisputed.

12

QUESTION:

It's --

13

QUESTION:

May I ask if your position would

14

apply if this were a violation of the Fair Labor Standards

15

Act instead of the labor act?

16

underpaid the employee, would he have a right to back pay?

17

MR. McCORTNEY:

If the employer had

Your Honor, I -- in the amicus

18

brief of the States they seem to equate back pay under the

19

NLRA with back pay under the FLSA when they're two

20

different things.

21
22
23

QUESTION:

Back pay -I understand they're two different --

I just want to know what your position is on that.
MR. McCORTNEY:

No, we would not advocate at

24

all, and we have not, taking wages away from undocumented

25

aliens that have been earned for work already performed.

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

Even though they -- it was a crime to

2

do any work?

3

that everything that this person did on that job, from

4

presenting the false documentation on, was unlawful, so

5

why should he be paid anything for unlawful activity?

6

You're making a distinction between the Fair Labor

7

Standards Act and the NLRA, but your theory, I think,

8

would cover both.

9

Why -- if you're sticking with your theory

MR. McCORTNEY:

Well, Your Honor, we give

10

certain rights and benefits to undocumented aliens that

11

are already in this country, and we do that to level the

12

playing field between undocumented aliens and American

13

workers so that unscrupulous employers won't prefer

14

undocumented aliens over American workers.
QUESTION:

15

Well, furthermore, just from the

16

standpoint of equity, I suppose the employer has

17

benefitted from the services in the case that Justice

18

Ginsburg puts, and there's --

19

MR. McCORTNEY:

20

QUESTION:

Absolutely.

-- no benefit here save, arguably,

21

from the illegal labor practice, but there's no benefit

22

for work received.
MR. McCORTNEY:

23
24
25

Honor.

That's absolutely correct, Your

In fact -QUESTION:

Would you clarify one thing for me?

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. McCORTNEY:

2

QUESTION:

Sure.

Do I understand that if the employer

3

and the employee both know of the illegality, that then

4

there's no back pay?

5

MR. McCORTNEY:

6

QUESTION:

7

Yes, Your Honor.

It seems to me that's absolutely

upside down.

8

MR. McCORTNEY:

9

QUESTION:

Well, Your Honor --

The -- and of course, you don't --

10

this is the Government's position, you don't have to

11

defend it, but in other words, as I understand the

12

Government's -- once the employer knows that there's a

13

violation and continues it, he's no longer liable for back

14

pay.

15

That's a strange calculus.
MR. McCORTNEY:

Well, Your Honor, that's the

16

problem with the rule, is that it in some ways rewards the

17

unscrupulous employer in Sure-Tan and penalizes the

18

innocent employer, as in Hoffman.

19

employer knowingly hires an illegal alien, then whenever

20

some kind of union organizing drive comes along and say

21

gee, we can get rid of them, and we know they're illegal,

22

and we're going to terminate them, then they can report

23

them to the INS right from the outset --

If the unscrupulous

Mr. McCortney --

QUESTION:

Well, the difference is --

1

3

MR. McCORTNEY:

-- get him departed, and cut off

back pay.
QUESTION:

The difference is, of course, that if

4

the employer knowingly hires this alien, he's subject to a

5

lot of other penalties under the immigration law.

6

MR. McCORTNEY:

7

QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.

Take an employer who, you know, all

8

he does, he says, I've checked their cards, I've checked

9

their cards, the cards say they're here legally, and he

10
11

runs some God-awful sweat shop.
Now, your theory, there is no remedy under any

12

law against that employer but for a prospective remedy,

13

and so everyone gets one bite at that apple.

14

QUESTION:

15

though, doesn't he?

Well, he has to pay for the sweat,

16

MR. McCORTNEY:

17

QUESTION:

18
19

Absolutely.

And it's pretty low cost, because

he's violating every labor law under the sun.
QUESTION:

If, indeed, the worker, under this

20

scheme you're proposing, there's no doubt that the

21

document -- undocumented alien works, he's going to get

22

paid for the work.

23

MR. McCORTNEY:

Absolutely, Your Honor, no

doubt, and we have never advocated -QUESTION:

OSHA violation, and we're -- as I said in answer to

4

Judge -- Justice Ginsburg's question, we recognize that

5

undocumented aliens are given certain rights and benefits

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. McCORTNEY:

9

What about title VII?
Under title VII, if it's back

pay exactly like back pay under the National Labor

10

Relations Act, where it's unearned wages for work not

11

performed during the back pay period, then that would be a

12

problem.

13

QUESTION:

Suppose the allegation is, they kept

14

me in this entry-level job, although I was qualified for

15

the next step, because I was a woman and they never

16

promote women.

17

she wants to be paid at the rate she should have earned

18

absent sex discrimination.

19

That's the charge, and she wants back pay,

MR. McCORTNEY:

In that situation, Your Honor,

20

if it were discovered that the illegal -- that this person

21

was an illegal alien --

22

QUESTION:

Make it just like this case.

23

MR. McCORTNEY:

Then there are other remedies

24

available under title VII to effectuate the policies of

25

the act and to enforce compliance.

Here, title VII, which -- would that

MR. McCORTNEY:

It would be -- if -- in your

7

situation, you would get back pay, and let me explain the

8

difference in this case.

9

remedy is that the very nature of the remedy creates a

The problem with the board's

10

duty to mitigate, which in turn requires and encourages

11

the illegal alien to seek interim employment, thereby

12

committing further and new violations of the immigrations

13

law.

14

QUESTION:

So in title VII, if she were laid

15

off, say, because they laid off all the women before they

16

laid off any men, so she would also have a duty to

17

mitigate in those circumstances, would the result be

18

different?

19

MR. McCORTNEY:

No.

When there's a duty to

20

mitigate which requires them to seek interim employment,

21

that is where the rub is, but under title VII, under,

22

like, the National Labor Relations Act, there's a whole

23

array of other remedies available to enforce compliance.

Punitive damages, you can -- compensatory damages,

QUESTION:

bracket title VII with the FLSA.
MR. McCORTNEY:

Yes, because I --

15

notwithstanding Justice Scalia's very good example that I

16

don't find that appealing, that there is a way that this

17

Court can distinguish between the National Labor Relations

18

Act, which is remedial in nature, and all these other

19

State and Federal discrimination laws that have punitive

20

features to it that are not dependent on the undocumented

21

alien's ability to work in this country.

22

QUESTION:

Well, I don't have any doubt that

23

there are other ways for us to distinguish this, and it

24

may very well be that if this were an original matter with

25

us we wouldn't have struck the balance where the board

20
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

did, but you've got the element here, the added element

2

here of the board's decision, and I suppose we owe some

3

kind of respect to it.

4

the extent to which we owe deference is not, perhaps,

5

clear, but we've got to give some consideration to it,

6

haven't we?

7

MR. McCORTNEY:

8

QUESTION:

9

Given the confusion of statutes,

Well, Your Honor --

If I could just supplement that, do

we owe any deference to the views of the Attorney General

10

of the United States, who is responsible for enforcing

11

these -- both statutes?
MR. McCORTNEY:

12

Your Honor, I don't believe so.

13

Under -- we're looking at a remedial statute under 10(c)

14

of the NLRA, and the only deference that the board is

15

entitled to is, if the remedy that they order does not

16

conflict with the immigration laws and policies of this

17

country.

MR. McCORTNEY:

In what way, Your Honor?

There

was a back pay hearing, there was a underlying unfair

labor practice proceeding.

QUESTION:

MR. McCORTNEY:

That the employer was found to

The

No, I mean, there was an

administrative order to pay, wasn't there?

10

MR. McCORTNEY:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. McCORTNEY:

Yes.

That's what I thought.
But the administrative law judge

13

did find -- did not award any back pay to Castro because

14

it conflicted with -- Sure-Tan had found that it

15

conflicted with IRCA.

16

QUESTION:

But the board did.

17

MR. McCORTNEY:

18

QUESTION:

Yes.

19

QUESTION:

I guess you're quite right that if

Yes.

20

the board's award violates the immigration law, that's the

21

end of the case.

22

MR. McCORTNEY:

23

QUESTION:

That's correct.

You win.

But suppose that the

24

immigration law doesn't forbid that award in terms, but

25

its policy would, in fact, be hindered, while the labor

1

law, actually the policy is furthered, though it doesn't

2

insist on this kind of award, wouldn't we defer to the

3

board when it seeks to reconcile, or the Attorney General

4

when they seek to reconcile the policies of the two

5

statutes?

6

MR. McCORTNEY:

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. McCORTNEY:

9

No, Your Honor.

Because -I respectfully disagree, and

this -- in Sure-Tan this Court said in devising remedies

10

for unfair labor practices the board is obliged to take

11

into account another equally important congressional

12

objective, to wit, the objective of deterring unauthorized

13

immigration that is embodied in the INA.
QUESTION:

14

Well, that goes back as far as

15

Southern Steamship Company, where you're talking about the

16

mutiny statute, that the board can't just go ahead without

17

any reference to competing statutes.
MR. McCORTNEY:

18

Well, Your Honor, I would agree,

19

if the board's remedy conflicts with the policies of

20

another statutory scheme, then it's -- they're owed no

21

deference.
QUESTION:

22

The board did take that into account,

23

though.

I don't remember what they did in this case, but

24

in the case where the board explained that it was, indeed,

25

taking into account the policy of the immigration laws and

23
Alderson Reporting Company

2

It was affirmed on appeal.

3

out its reasoning for taking this position.

4

MR. McCORTNEY:

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. McCORTNEY:

The case where the board laid

The APRA Fuel case?

Yes.
Okay.

Your Honor, the

7

fundamental problem with this case is that this Court

8

stated in Sure-Tan that the objective of the INA is to

9

deter unauthorized immigration, and that a --

10

QUESTION:

But let's go back to one thing it

11

also said in Sure-Tan, which is that the court of appeals

12

here made an estimate without any evidence as to the

13

period of time these employees might have continued

14

working before apprehension by the INS, and that sounds --

15

working before apprehension by the INS, that sounds very

16

close to what the board did in this case?

17

MR. McCORTNEY:

Well, Your Honor, also in Sure-

18

Tan, in the last sentence of the remedial section of the

19

opinion it states, by directing the board to impose a

20

minimum back pay award without regard to the employee's

21

actual economic losses or legal availability to work, the

22

court of appeals plainly exceeded its limited authority

23

under the act.

24

actual losses that was the problem, it was the fact that

25

the discriminatees were not either legally present or

It made it clear that it wasn't just

24
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

legally authorized to work.
QUESTION:

So then, what do you make of the

3

condition about the period between the violation and when

4

the employees might have continued working before

5

apprehension by the INS?

6

MR. McCORTNEY:

Your Honor, I don't know,

7

because the discriminatees in that case were -- left the

8

country the same day their employment terminated.

9

QUESTION:

I'm not talking about the outcome of

10

that particular case, where they were in Mexico, but a

11

case where they were here, and the question was, how much

12

back pay, and there's a reference to not a flat 6 weeks or

13

6 months or whatever, but a time period from the unlawful

14

employment practice until one would expect the INS would

15

pick up these people.

16

MR. McCORTNEY:

Your Honor, again I think that

17

is consistent with the other language in the Sure-Tan

18

decision which is repeated over and over again about legal

19

availability to work, and being legally authorized to

20

work, and why would the Court use that language if it

21

didn't have to?

22

So I -- getting back to the policy of this that

23

underlies the immigration laws of this country, it is to

24

preserve jobs for American workers.

25

illegal entry that takes jobs away from American workers.

It is not the act of

25
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

It's the act of working in this country without

2

authorization that takes jobs away from American workers,

3

and I would submit that the continued presence of an

4

illegal alien in this country poses a greater threat to

5

American jobs than an alien who enters this country

6

repeatedly, because the latter presupposes that the alien

7

has been physically absent from the job market for a

8

period of time.

9

If the -- under the board's scenario, the Sure-

10

Tan discriminatees could have reentered on a tourist visa

11

and be legally present and not legally authorized to work,

12

and under that scenario they're clearly not entitled to

13

back pay because it violates 1182(a)(5), that sets forth

14

the terms and conditions on which aliens can work in this

15

country and those that can't.

16

The same would be true of aliens who enter the

17

country on a student visa, or who overstay their visa and

18

work without authorization, so whether you have an alien

19

that enters this country illegally and works without

20

authorization, or who enters this country legally and

21

works without authorization, both takes jobs away from

22

American workers, and both violate the INA.

we have a massive problem of illegal immigration, if

12

that's how the INS feels about this.

13

MR. WOLFSON:

I must disagree with that, Justice

14

Scalia, and the point is, as the board recognized both in

15

this decision and in the APRA Fuel decision which preceded

16

it, the essential problem is that there is, as the board

17

pointed out, an inseverable connection between illegal

18

immigration, the availability of jobs, and poor working

19

conditions for employees for -- that illegal immigrants

20

are wiling to take in the United States.

21

Now, Congress enacted IRCA on the premise that

22

there was very little that it could do about the wage

differential and the difference in levels of employment,

24

unemployment that was drawing illegal immigrants to the

25

United States in search of jobs.

That is, the board

might permissibly conclude that an undocumented alien

should not be any better off than an authorized worker by

I

1

do know that the board has concluded that undocumented

2

aliens may be included within the bargaining unit, and

3

indeed, in both Sure-Tan -- in Sure-Tan itself I believe

4

they were included in the bargaining unit.

5
6

QUESTION:

And that doesn't induce illegal

immigration?

7

MR. WOLFSON:

8

QUESTION:

Well --

It seems to me that's a far more

9

direct link than the very tenuous idea that you have that

10

there's going to be more illegal immigration because they

11

know they're going to get back pay.

12

saying is that a union can, I suppose even knowingly, use

13

illegal aliens on the workforce to organize the employer,

14

knowing that by doing that the alien will still be

15

entitled to back pay.

16

from any calculus, from any equitable calculus in your

17

brief.

18

quite puzzled by it.

19

Here, what you're

That seems to me completely missing

I just -- and since it's a more direct link, I'm

MR. WOLFSON:

Well, I don't know -- I would

20

suggest that the more powerful inducement towards illegal

21

migration is the availability of the job, union or no.

22

That is, even if the union is willing to include

23

undocumented workers in its bargaining unit, there still

24

has to be a job for that worker, and it is the employer

25

who is fundamentally in control of that matter, and it is

35
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the employer --

2

QUESTION:

Mr. Wolfson, in these cases we're

3

only talking about a situation where the employer, and

4

presumably the union, too, doesn't know, because if the

5

employer knows, then the employer's obligation is to

6

dismiss that person, as I assume it would be the union's,

7

too, but in all these cases the issue comes up only

8

because the employer didn't know of the illegality, isn't

9

that so?

10

MR. WOLFSON:

Well, in this case the employer

11

did not know.

Now, there are cases, I have to say, where

12

the employer does know, such as the APRA Fuel Corporation

13

that was referred to, and in that case what the board has

14

done is, it has said that the board -- the board has

15

ordered reinstatement on condition that the undocumented

16

alien put himself into a situation where he can obtain

17

reinstatement legally.

18

does the board order reinstatement of an employee who

19

everybody knows is undocumented.

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. WOLFSON:

That is, under no circumstances

But not back pay.
It does order back pay up to the

22

point where either the employee is reinstated, or it

23

terminates at a reasonable -- if the employee fails to put

24

himself in compliance with the immigration laws and become

25

qualified, the board cuts off back pay as of the end of a

36
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

reasonable period.

2

QUESTION:

That is consistent -Even though the employer -- I thought

3

that the rule was, as soon as the employer knows of the

4

illegality we're not going to allow any back pay from then

5

on.

6

MR. WOLFSON:

Well, that is because in a case

7

like this, what the board is doing is affording the

8

employer the benefit of its general, after-acquired

9

evidence rule.

10

QUESTION:

If he knows about illegality from the

11

very beginning, then we will --

12

MR. WOLFSON:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. WOLFSON:

Well, in a situation --

We will order back pay?
Yes, because in a situation like

15

that the employee -- the employer is not well-situated to

16

claim the benefit of the after-acquired evidence rule,

17

because it cannot claim that it wouldn't have hired the

18

alien anyway.

19

To use an example --

20

QUESTION:

21
22

So you have two people violating the

law, instead of one.
MR. WOLFSON:

Well, there are two people

23

violating the law here, Justice Scalia.

I mean, the

24

board -- I mean, there aren't two people violating the

25

immigration laws, but the employer did violate the

37
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

National Labor Relations Act, and the board is quite

2

properly --

3

QUESTION:

From the time of his initial hiring

4

up until his violation.

5

when both the employer and the employee are violating the

6

law, we're going to -- you're asking the courts to give

7

their benediction to this stark violation of United States

8

law by awarding money that hasn't even been worked for.

9

I -- it's just something courts don't do.

10

MR. WOLFSON:

I mean, but what you're saying is

Well, the board is charged with

11

the responsibility of developing a workable implementation

12

of the National Labor Relations Act pursuant to its

13

authority under section 10(c).

14

must take into consideration the policies of the

15

immigration law, but there is no --

16

QUESTION:

In doing so, it of course

What it's doing, though, really is

17

kind of odd, because the result is that back pay awards to

18

illegal workers are likely to be greater than to legal

19

ones under this board's policy, and that's so odd, and it

20

gives the illegal alien an incentive to try to phony up

21

more documents and to extend for the longest possible time

22

the charade that the worker is here lawfully, and that's

23

surely strongly against the policies of the immigration

24

act at the very least.

25

MR. WOLFSON:

The problem, Justice O'Connor, is

38
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that the immigration act, the policies come down on both

2

sides.

3

I mean, yes, they obviously discourage illegal

4

immigration and obtaining of jobs by illegal immigrants,

5

but they also very strongly operate on the employer, and

6

the fundamental premise on which Congress enacted IRCA was

7

that it was the employer's -- the employer had a very

8

strong and natural economic and competitive incentive to

9

hire illegal workers, and it is that -- it is -- the

10

board's concern, in this case I think quite properly, is

11

that if back pay were removed from the equation the --

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. WOLFSON:

14

me.

Well, but you --- Congress's attempt to -- excuse

I'm sorry.
QUESTION:

15

You say it comes down on both sides,

16

and it makes certain acts by illegal immigrants illegal,

17

the entry, and it makes certain acts by the employer

18

illegal.

19

law.

20

it comes down on both sides.

21

law I could see your point, but the employer was not

22

violating the law.

23

Here, the worker, the alien was violating the

The employer was not violating the law.

MR. WOLFSON:

So you say

If both were violating the

That is correct, Mr. Chief

24

Justice, but the board is attempting to fashion -- the

25

board doesn't know in advance which employer will violate

39
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the law by hiring undocumented aliens knowingly and which

2

will not, or which employer will, you know --

3
4
5

QUESTION:

So you say this is a prophylactic

rule?
MR. WOLFSON:

I think that the board is

6

fashioning a rule that is implementing Congress' policy

7

objective in IRCA across the board.

8
9

QUESTION:

But shouldn't remedies be looked at

after the fact, let's find out who violated what and then

10

fashion the appropriate remedy?

11

MR. WOLFSON:

Well, the Court has not said that

12

the board has to only fashion its remedies in a case in

13

which the precise situation -- you know, in the precise

14

situation into which it's dedicated.

15

In a case called NLRB v., I think, 7-Up Bottling

16

Company the Court explained that the board can make its

17

back pay calculations for the purpose of across-the-board

18

rules rather than just the employer to which -- that is

19

before the board itself, and the point is, even though

20

this employer, even though there's no evidence that this

21

employer violated IRCA when it -- nonetheless the board, I

22

think, could quite reasonably say, well, if -- or if there

23

is a flat rule that employees will never get back pay when

24

they are terminated in violation of the National Labor

25

Relations Act, employers then will pick up on that rule

40
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

and they will say, okay, now I can get away with it

2

because there's not going to be any remedy for any

3

employee, and this is a very large --

4

QUESTION:

They won't get away with it.

They're

5

subject to prosecution for -- if they know that it's an

6

illegal --

7

MR. WOLFSON:

It's not just the problem of their

8

knowing that they're illegal hiring.

There also is the

9

paperwork obligations, the verification systems, and I

10

think there is a very real concern that an employer who

11

knows that there's not really any monetary price to being

12

lax in hiring, in checking whether illegal aliens are

13

hired would say, well, on the one hand I just have the

14

civil violations for violating the paperwork concerns.

15

the other hand, the labor of undocumented aliens is in a

16

very real sense much --

17

QUESTION:

But it's just not reasonable --

18

QUESTION:

Why should the board be responsible

19

for making sure that the employer documents his material

20

about illegal aliens?

21

MR. WOLFSON:

On

I don't think that -- it's not

22

that the board is implementing IRCA, Mr. Chief Justice.

23

It is that its policy here is consistent with the policies

24

that I've been discussing.

25

QUESTION:

Well, here's the thing.

When an

41
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

employer reviews documents and concludes that they're

2

valid and the person is lawfully here, then the employer

3

isn't going to get some advantage of hiring some illegal

4

alien because the worker will have to be paid and given

5

benefits as though the worker were legally here, so

6

there's no incentive for the employer under those

7

circumstances to give a bum deal to the employee.

8

QUESTION:

None at all.

9

QUESTION:

But there is an incentive, it seems

10

to me, for the employee to continue to conceal the facts,

11

the facts that he's here illegally and has no right to

12

work, and that the documents are false, and the board's

13

rule fosters both those --

14

MR. WOLFSON:

But one does have to take into

15

account I think what would be the consequence of an

16

opposite rule, that is, no back pay for an undocumented

17

alien, and there is, I think, a very serious consequence

18

that a flat rule that said something like, 7 million

19

undocumented workers just simply get no back pay at all if

20

they are in this country illegally and not employed.

21

That is a very large class of people to

22

basically say, you are just without a remedy under the

23

National Labor Relations Act, and there may be

24

implications for other Federal labor laws as well, and --

25

QUESTION:

But why should they be used to

42
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

organize a bargaining unit --

2

MR. WOLFSON:

3

QUESTION:

4

Because it --

-- if they're illegal employees?

I'm

baffled by that.

5

MR. WOLFSON:

Because it -- well, because the

6

labor laws benefit everybody, and it's not just -- I mean,

7

they are -- when I say they're organizing a bargaining

8

unit, obviously they are -- there may be -- in this case

9

there were other citizens and authorized aliens who are

10

interested in organizing for the purpose of vindicating

11

their rights under section 7 of the labor relations act.

12

The Court pointed this out in Sure-Tan, where it said it

13

is appropriate to include illegal aliens within the

14

definition of employees, because all the workers are in it

15

together.

16

QUESTION:

I would have thought, Mr. Wolfson,

17

that when you said, you know, there are 7 million illegal

18

aliens in this country, that what you would follow that

19

with is not, that's an awful lot of people not to give

20

back pay to.

21

with, we have to do something to reduce this massive

22

number of 7 million illegal aliens.

I would have thought you would follow it

23

MR. WOLFSON:

24

QUESTION:

25

And what --

And what you don't want to do to

reduce it is to give them back pay.

43
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. WOLFSON:

Now, there is no question that

2

there is a serious problem of illegal immigration, and the

3

INS and the Attorney General dedicate substantial

4

resources to attempting to resolve that problem.

5

On the other hand, Congress without question

6

recognized when it enacted IRCA that this was a many-

7

faceted problem, and one aspect of the problem was that

8

there was a natural magnet in drawing illegal,

9

undocumented workers here in the wage differential, and

10

that employers were willing to give jobs, and that it

11

should not be cheaper for an employer to hire an

12

undocumented alien than it is to hire -QUESTION:

13

Okay, but the argument, Mr.

14

Wolfson -- every time -- and I understand that argument.

15

Every time you make that argument, it seems to me the

16

answer comes back, there are other ways to go against the

17

employer.

18

criminal actions against the employer, and so on, so that

19

the answer always is the effort to discourage employers

20

from hiring illegal aliens doesn't depend upon the back

21

pay.

22

You can fine the employer, you can bring

I thought the board's position was strongest to

23

counter that when the board says, there's kind of the gray

24

area in which it's not clear that we can prosecute.

25

evidence of what the employer knew at the relevant time is

The

44
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

not leaping out at us, and so what we are trying to do is

2

to fashion a remedy for those cases in which it's not

3

practical to prosecute, but which we know perfectly well

4

in the real world employers are winking at the likelihood

5

that they're employing illegal aliens.

6

that we want to provide the inducement for by forcing back

7

pay.

Is -- am I giving the board too much credit?

8
9
10

That's the group

MR. WOLFSON:

I wouldn't say that the board has

limited -- it certainly hasn't limited its remedy to that
situation -QUESTION:

11

Well, why then, in the question --

12

why in the question -- because I have exactly the same

13

question.

14

that the Government presented it says, whether an order to

15

pay back pay to an employee who was discriminatorily laid

16

off, but only up to the date on which petitioner

17

discovered that the employee was an undocumented alien,

18

whether that kind of order is lawful.

19

the question presented.

20

That's exactly what I thought.

In the question

That's how you saw

Now are you telling me that what I'm supposed to

21

decide is a case I really didn't think I had to decide,

22

which is, what happens if the board awards back pay to

23

others, such as those whom the employer has always known

24

were illegal?

25

MR. WOLFSON:

We are not suggesting that the

45
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Court has to decide that case here.

2

in opposition to the cert petition we pointed out that

3

that was a different set of cases, the set of cases under

4

the APRA --

5

QUESTION:

Indeed, in our brief

Well, if it's a narrow question, just

6

what Justice Souter said I had taken to be the precise

7

rationale for the narrow set of cases we're supposed to

8

decide.

9

what he was saying, and I'm seconding it.

10
11

Now, maybe that's all not so.

QUESTION:

That, I think, is

Clearly you haven't missed your

opportunity.

12

(Laughter.)

13

MR. WOLFSON:

Justice Breyer, my point is that

14

the board in a case -- the board did rely on its APRA Fuel

15

decision in this case, but what it held in this case was

16

that an employer, once an employer learns that an alien is

17

undocumented and therefore he cannot be hired, and in

18

addition that the board accepts that that employer would

19

not have hired that alien and would have discharged the

20

alien when it found out that he was undocumented, then the

21

employer should surely get the benefit of the after-

22

acquired evidence rule that is applied in many, many kinds

23

of Federal labor laws, including the Age Discrimination

24

Act, for example.

25

QUESTION:

Once you adopt that rule, however, it

46
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

seems to me that the asserted benefit to the immigration

2

laws that you're claiming this rule has disappears.

3

no disincentive to any employer, because the only employer

4

who would get the benefit of the rule that you don't get

5

any back pay would be the perfectly innocent employer who

6

hires someone not knowing that the person is an unlawful

7

alien.

8
9

It is

How are you possibly deterring anybody?
You're trying to deter the employer who hires an

immigrant, apparently with this in the back of his mind:

10

I know this guy's an immigrant and I can commit an unfair

11

labor practice upon him.

12

that's high in the mind of any employer, but assuming it

13

is, you still have to assume, if he's going to be

14

deterred, that he knows that the person is an illegal

15

immigrant, but this rule only applies to people who don't

16

know.
MR. WOLFSON:

17

I'm rather skeptical whether

Well, whether or not -- he may not

18

know in the face of having clear, irrefutable evidence

19

before him.

20

somewhat lax in his compliance with the obligations of the

21

verification system, because --

On the other hand, he may be induced to be

22

QUESTION:

23

him for that, then.
MR. WOLFSON:

24
25

Well, get him for that, then.

Get

Well, that -- of course, that's

not --

47
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

But your -- isn't another way to

2

describe the class you're dealing with is, he may not know

3

in the sense that the Government can prove that he knew,

4

but there is a class of employees as to whom the evidence

5

is not clear, and it is that class that we want to provide

6

the negative inducement for.

7

MR. WOLFSON:

Isn't that the answer?

I think at a, I would say at a

8

minimum that is the answer, and the board cannot know in

9

advance --

10

QUESTION:

Why should the board take over

11

responsibility for those provisions that are basically

12

immigration law provisions?

13

MR. WOLFSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, the board does

14

not view itself as enforcing the immigration laws.

15

think the question is, is this particular order

16

inconsistent with the immigration laws, or is it

17

consistent, and for some of the reasons that are being

18

expressed here, all that we are saying is that it does

19

not -- it is consistent with them.

20
21
22

I

Surely there is no direct conflict with the
immigration laws.
QUESTION:

The board -What you just agreed to in your

23

colloquy with Justice Souter does contradict the

24

immigration -- I remember when this statute was passed

25

about what the responsibility of the employer was.

It was

48
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

a clear provision of the statute that all the employer has

2

to do is check the papers.

3

the employer to look behind the papers and see whether

4

it's forged.

5

It isn't the responsibility of

Now you're saying, ah, but there are some

6

employers that maybe, yeah, you know, they complied with

7

the provision of the law, they looked at the card, which

8

is what the -- there was a big fight over that.

9

is -- investigatory responsibility is going to be placed

10

on the employer, and the answer was basically none, just

11

look at the documentation, and now you're saying, but some

12

employers, we think they should have known better, and

13

we're going to impose on this class of employers and, as

14

it turns out, on a lot of others, liability which they

15

shouldn't have.
MR. WOLFSON:

16

How much

They don't have any liability

17

under IRCA.

I mean, nobody is suggesting that the board

18

can impose a liability under IRCA, but there is a concern,

19

I think, that if en employer is totally exempted from back

20

pay, a back pay remedy under another Federal labor law,

21

that that does -- that does work an inducement on the part

22

of the employer to hire illegal aliens.
QUESTION:

23

Do no more than what the statute

24

requires.

Check the documentation.

If the documentation

25

is there, and valid on its face, he's entitled to proceed.

49
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

That's what the fight was about, and that's how the

2

immigration law came out.

3

MR. WOLFSON:

I do want to touch a bit on Sure-

4

Tan, which I haven't had much of a chance to discuss.

5

Our -- we have submitted in our brief that we think that

6

the facts of the Sure -- of the situation in Sure-Tan

7

really make it quite distinguishable from this particular

8

case.

9

that the condition that the Court explained and put on a

In Sure-Tan, first of all I do want to point out

10

reinstatement and back pay remedy, those did originate in

11

the Seventh Circuit, and no party to this Court challenged

12

that condition, that reinstatement and back pay had to be

13

conditioned on the employee showing that he was legally

14

authorized to be present and employed in the United

15

States.

16

Now, the Court perceived that what happened in

17

Sure-Tan was essentially the employer was being forced to

18

say to the employee, you have a guaranteed job and a

19

paycheck waiting for you right now, so come back to the

20

United States right now and pick it up.

21

obviously is a very powerful lure to an employee to

22

migrate back to the United States if there is no condition

23

that the employee show that he is authorized.

24
25

I mean, that

We submit that the incentives work quite
differently in a case like this where the employee does

50
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

remain in the United States.

Congress did enact IRCA on

2

the assumption that illegal, undocumented alien employees

3

in the United States were at the very bottom of the wage

4

scale, they were likely to remain here as long as they

5

could get any job that was available, and as against that,

6

we submit that the inducement to violate the immigration

7

laws that petitioner suggests by the prospect of waiting

8

around after years of litigation for the prospect of some

9

kind of back pay award at the end of the day is quite

10

minimal, and all the courts that have looked at this under
