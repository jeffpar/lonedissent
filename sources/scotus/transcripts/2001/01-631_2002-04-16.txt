Mr. Thompson.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LARRY D. THOMPSON
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. THOMPSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This Court has held in several decisions that

12

the police questioning of individuals is a legitimate and,

13

indeed, vital law enforcement technique.

14

below ignores this Court's teachings as to when a police-

15

citizen encounter on a bus may violate the Fourth

16

Amendment and may constitute the seizure of the passenger.

17

The decision

Police-citizen encounters have proven to be

18

effective law enforcement techniques in the area of drug

19

and weapon interdiction.

20

important in today's environment with respect to the

21

protection of passengers in the Nation's public

22

transportation system.

23

These encounters are also

This case is controlled by this Court's decision

24

in Bostick and the court below incorrectly applied the

25

Bostick test to these facts.

1

QUESTION:

Mr. Thompson, isn't it so that in

2

Bostick the police did inform the passengers that they had

3

a right to refuse consent?

4

MR. THOMPSON:

That is correct, Your Honor, but

5

also in Bostick this Court clearly pointed out, on remand

6

to the Florida Supreme Court, the factors that the Court

7

should evaluate in terms of determining whether or not the

8

encounter was coercive or otherwise inappropriate.

9

two of those factors are important here that would put

10

And

into context what the court below considered.

11

For example, this Court pointed out to the

12

Florida Supreme Court whether or not there were guns

13

pointed and noted that there were no guns pointed in a --

14

in the Bostick case.

15

Florida Supreme Court that -- whether or not there was the

16

existence of threatening language, and none of that

17

existed in the case below.

18

QUESTION:

This Court also pointed out to the

Well, I -- I suppose that the advice

19

that you have a right to decline the request applies --

20

and I -- I take it you could read Bostick this way;

21

perhaps you disagree -- to whether or not the -- the

22

consent was actually given as opposed to whether there was

23

a coercive environment.

24

MR. THOMPSON:

25

That's correct, Your Honor, and

as the Bostick Court pointed out with respect to the test
4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

to be applied is whether or not, under all the

2

circumstances, the police conduct communicated to a

3

reasonable person -- and that presupposes a reasonably --

4

a reasonable innocent person -- whether or not the

5

passenger could have refused the officer's request to

6

consent or otherwise have terminated the -- terminated the

7

encounter.

8

There is really nothing remarkable about the

9

facts of this case when you look at this Court's decision

10

in Bostick and compare Bostick with this Court's decision

11

in Robinette which clearly pointed --

12

QUESTION:

My question, Mr. Thompson, was your

13

opening statement was that the Eleventh Circuit had ruled

14

in direct conflict with this Court's precedent.

15

applying a totality of the circumstances test, that's one

16

circumstance that was present there, is not present here.

17

So, whether the Eleventh Circuit erred is for us to

18

determine today, but I do think it's a bit much to say

19

that they -- they just disregarded this Court's precedent.

20

MR. THOMPSON:

If we're

Your Honor, the Eleventh Circuit

21

considered factors that were unlike the factors that this

22

Court in Bostick believed were important in determining

23

whether the police conduct at issue was coercive.

24

moreover, Your Honor, the Eleventh Circuit incorrectly

25

applied the legal principles that this Court formulated
5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

And

1

with respect to the facts of this case.

2

For example, the Eleventh Circuit noted the

3

importance of Officer Hoover at the front of the bus and

4

pointed out that his presence might lead a -- a passenger

5

to believe that he or she could not leave the bus.

6

this Court in Bostick clearly pointed out that the -- in a

7

-- in the context of a bus interdiction effort, whether or

8

not the passenger could leave the bus was the wrong

9

question.

Well,

The question was whether or not the passenger

10

-- whether or not the police conduct communicated to the

11

passenger whether or not they could refuse the consent

12

requested or whether or not they could just terminate the

13

questioning of the police officer.

14

QUESTION:

Well, it's -- it's true that the --

15

the issue of whether someone could leave the bus or not is

16

-- is not really an issue that -- that focuses the

17

question, and we said so in Bostick.

18

follow from that that it was irrelevant in Bostick or that

19

it's irrelevant here that there was an officer stationed

20

at the front of the bus.

21

totality of the circumstances test, wouldn't you agree

22

that that is one relevant fact to consider in trying to

23

reconstruct the atmosphere and decide whether or not it

24

signaled to the -- to the person searched the -- the

25

possibility of just ending the encounter?

But it doesn't

If we're going to have a

1

MR. THOMPSON:

Yes, Your Honor.

That -- it is

2

one relevant fact to be taken into consideration with the

3

other factors, but here the officer stationed at the front

4

of the bus -- at the front of the bus really did not

5

communicate, nor did Officer Lang who was doing the

6

questioning -- did not communicate that -- to any

7

passenger that he or she could not terminate the

8

questioning.

9

QUESTION:

He did -- nobody said, you can't

10

leave the bus.

But isn't it a fact that a passenger would

11

take into some consideration that there was an officer

12

stationed at the front of the bus?

13

MR. THOMPSON:

14

QUESTION:

15

He wasn't keeping people out,

apparently.

16

MR. THOMPSON:

17

QUESTION:

18

Your Honor --

Excuse me.

It's -- it's a relevant fact in

determining the coerciveness of the atmosphere, is it not?

19

MR. THOMPSON:

Your Honor, not in this case.

20

The court below and the Eleventh Circuit acknowledged in

21

-- in their findings, if you will, that the -- the aisle

22

was not blocked, the exit was not blocked.

23

QUESTION:

In fact,

Let me -- let me try a -- a different

The fact that the officer at the front of the

occupying the driver's seat.

are satisfied.

This

Now, that may or may not be dispositive of

11

anything, but it is a relevant fact on the question of

12

coercion and voluntariness.

13

MR. THOMPSON:

Isn't it?

Your Honor, the presence of the

14

officer at the front of the bus is a factor, but in the

15

context of these facts and if -- in the context of this

16

Court's decision in Delgado where you had armed agents

17

surrounding the factory, and this Court held that simply

18

because the factory workers could not leave without

19

passing those agents --

20

QUESTION:

I agree with you.

You're -- you're

21

absolutely right there.

The -- the point that I'm making

22

is that you can't go through this kind of analysis and

say, well, this fact is irrelevant.

25

That shouldn't have been considered.

This shouldn't have

That fact was irrelevant.
It was a relevant

fact.

2

Delgado reference, is a different question, but it's a

3

relevant fact, isn't it?

4

What it all adds up to, as you suggest by the

MR. THOMPSON:

It's a relevant fact, but the

5

factors to be considered and the factors that this Court

6

clearly announced in -- in the Bostick case were factors

7

that were threatening, factors that were otherwise

8

coercive, like pointing a gun.

9

Your Honor, the Eleventh Circuit even noted that there was

In this particular case,

10

no evidence that any of the passengers saw that this

11

officer was armed.

QUESTION:

The -- the other two officers were I

know, but was there -- was it clear that the person

18

kneeling in the driver's seat was an officer?

MR. THOMPSON:

He was casually dressed, Your

Honor, and it's not clear from the record as to whether or

21

not he was a police officer.

Yes.

They all entered as

QUESTION:

Well, I mean, I -- what -- I don't

know what that -- why should that make a difference.

somebody shows me a badge and he's casually dressed, I

know he's got a gun, or he's going to be fired.

13

Let me -- let me ask you this.

If

Would it be

14

appropriate in your view for this Court to write an

opinion in which we say that citizens have certain

obligations to know their rights and to assert their

rights?

18

law lives in the consciousness of the people.

19

searched.

That's what makes for a strong democracy.

The

And people
If they

Should we write that in an opinion?
MR. THOMPSON:

Well, that follows on with the --

23

the clear test that this Court announced in Bostick, and

24

the test was, Your Honor, whether or not the police

25

conduct commuted anything -- communicated anything to the

citizens and these passengers as to -QUESTION:

What about the proposition as I -- as

3

I've stated it?

4

there's a good answer for it -- then I'd just say, well,

5

we have to distinguish Miranda at least.

6

on a contrary assumption.

my mind as I'm asking the question.

Because if you say yes -- and I think

MR. THOMPSON:

Miranda is based

That's what's running through

Well, here -- here the -- the

citizens -- some citizens did refuse Officer Lang's

10

request, and what -- what you posit is -- is really the

11

guts of what is going on here.

12

Your Honor, many of the citizens -- most citizens went

13

along with the police questioning in -- in this particular

14

-- these particular bus interdictions, and they -- and

15

they were happy to do so.

16

many of the bus passengers appreciated his efforts in

17

coming onto the bus.

18

-- of safety.

As Officer Lang testified,

Officer Lang testified that

They -- it made them feel a sense of

And here citizens generally do know their

20

rights, and here the police did not communicate anything

21

to these passengers that would indicate that they had to

answer, that they were required or otherwise compelled to

23

answer Officer Lang's questions.

24
25

QUESTION:

Did any other case that we considered

involve a body pat-down, not just a request to look at

him and said, okay, we'd like to search you too.

MR. THOMPSON:

I imagine he would feel some

He took

But Drayton said nothing throughout

the whole encounter.
MR. THOMPSON:

Drayton's -- Drayton's consent,

as the district court found, was clear and unambiguous.

19

He raised his hands off of his thighs, Your Honor.

20

was nothing that Officer Lang said to Mr. -- or said to

21

Mr. Drayton or had said to Mr. Brown that would have

22

indicated that Mr. Drayton could not have terminated the

23

questioning or that he could have refused consent.

24
25

There

And as this Court noted -- as this Court noted
in Bostick, the fact that a lawbreaker knows that the

1

search is going to uncover contraband or is -- knows that

2

the search is going to uncover drugs does not make the

3

consent involuntary.

4

QUESTION:

Well, it doesn't make it involuntary,

5

but it -- it does suggest perhaps that there is an

6

ambiguity here as -- as against your claim that there was

7

none in Brown's consent because -- and correct me if I'm

8

wrong on the facts, but I -- I think the first request to

9

Brown was -- or maybe to the two of them together -- can I

10

look at your -- your luggage, your bag, whatever they had

11

pointed to, and they said, sure.

12

sure because they knew there was nothing in it that was

13

going to be incriminating.

14

-- in the luggage and he found nothing.

15

And I presume they said

So, the officer looked in the

Then he turned to Brown and said, mind if I do a

16

pat-down, or whatever the phrase was.

Well, that's the

17

search that's in question here, and I would have thought

18

that at that point Brown was in the situation in which the

19

reasonable citizen would have thought I'm damned if I do

20

and I'm damned if I don't.

21

he's thorough about it, he's going to find the -- the

22

drugs.

23

permission to him to -- to look in the -- in the bag, he's

24

going to know that there must be something on me that

25

wasn't on the bag.

If he pats me down and he's --

If I say you can't pat me down, having just given

And -- and, therefore, it seems to me
13

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that the -- that Brown at that point was by no means in a

2

position in which he had a kind of free choice to say yes

3

or no.

4

Have I got the facts wrong?

5

So, it sounds to me as though it is ambiguous.

MR. THOMPSON:

You have the facts, but your

6

conclusion, Your Honor, I would differ with because in --

7

in the situation both individuals pointed to the bag.

8

There was nothing in Officer Lang's request to Mr. Brown

9

that would -- that would -- that -- that would send or

10

communicate to Mr. Brown that he could not have refused

11

the request.

12

that would indicate to Mr. Brown that he could not have

13

otherwise terminated the questioning.

14

There was nothing in Officer Lang's question

QUESTION:

Why some of the --

Well, you don't agree, I hope, with

15

the -- with the proposition that there would be no reason

16

to decline the pat-down search except the reason that he

17

had something incriminating on him.

18

that you've -- you've acceded to the luggage search, which

19

is a much less intrusive search, does not show that --

20

that you have something to hide when you -- when you

21

decline to -- to have a pat-down.

22

agree that a consent to a luggage search is a lot less

23

difficult to obtain than consent to a pat-down?

24
25

MR. THOMPSON:

I mean, the mere fact

Don't -- don't you

search is not necessary to the Bostick inquiry.

1

QUESTION:

Well, I think you're -- I think

2

you're missing my point.

Justice Souter was suggesting

3

that having acceded to the luggage search, the only

4

plausible reason for objecting to the pat-down would be

5

that I have something on me that is incriminating.

6

-- I acceded to the luggage search because I knew there

7

was nothing incriminating.

8

innocent citizen could agree to a -- a policeman's search

9

of luggage but not agree to a pat-down?

And I

agree --

But don't -- don't you think

the most probable inference is the inference I gave you?

16

MR. THOMPSON:

No, Your Honor.

You have --

17

again, you have to understand this Court's holding in

18

Bostick and that is the --

19

QUESTION:

The holding in Bostick, if I remember

20

it, was that the Florida Supreme Court was wrong in

21

adopting a per se rule and left open the question of

22

whether there was a seizure in that case.

23

right?

24
25

MR. THOMPSON:

Yes, Your Honor.

Isn't that

But in this

particular case, the reasonable person, as this Court
15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

said, presupposes a reasonable, innocent person.

2

Lawbreakers sometimes agree to be -- agree to be searched,

3

knowing that the drugs are in their luggage or on their

4

person, for a number of reasons, sometimes as -- as these

5

gentlemen did.

6

want to send some kind of message that they indeed have

7

the items in question.

8

They do this for any number of reasons, hoping that the

9

police officer will not search them and go away.

They want to be cooperative.

Mr. Thompson, you -It has nothing to do with --

Excuse me.

-- that the police -- you were about

15

to say when the police go over the line.

16

here they did nothing that would imply that consent or

that -- that the search was required of the citizen.

-- can -- can you give a description of when the police

19

would step over the line?

QUESTION:

For

That -- that was a custodial

interrogation, wasn't it?

11

MR. THOMPSON:

12

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

And the -- the physical custody would

13

have had that -- that effect of -- of causing the person

14

to believe that he had no choice.

15

MR. THOMPSON:

Absolutely.

Here you have

16

unstructured, rapidly developing police-citizen

17

encounters, and what is important here --

18

QUESTION:

And you have a request and a

19

response.

And the response is that there is no objection

20

to the search.

21

objective consideration of the highest importance.

And it seems to me that that is an

MR. THOMPSON:

QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.

May I ask, Mr. Thompson, do you

regard this primarily as a seizure case or a search case?
MR. THOMPSON:

This is a seizure case, Your

1

Honor.

That's the -- the court below decided this case

2

under the -- under the Bostick test.

3

the Eleventh Circuit urged the Bostick test, and this is

4

-- I would submit that this is a seizure case.

5

QUESTION:

Both parties before

Do you think it always would follow

6

if you concluded that there was no seizure, that there was

7

necessarily voluntary consent to the search?

8

MR. THOMPSON:

9

QUESTION:

10

If there was no seizure?

Right.

MR. THOMPSON:

It -- in this Court's test in

11

Bostick, the Court merged the voluntary issue and the

12

voluntariness in with the -- in with the Bostick seizure

13

analysis.

14

together and are related.

So, I would say that -- that the two are merged

QUESTION:

16

have a case in which you could -- the officer could say to

18

the man, you're perfectly free to get off the bus anytime

19

you want to, but I'd like to -- to search you first, and

20

may I do so?

21

search was voluntary even if there had been no seizure.

22

It seems to me that could be a scenario that would make

23

sense.

24
25

It doesn't seem to me that
It seems to me you could

And then the question would be whether the

It's -- it's hard to -- in the

context of these bus -- police-citizen encounters on a

bus, it's hard to really see the distinction between the

2

voluntariness test and the seizure test.

3

QUESTION:

But it does seem to me the passenger

4

might have two different thoughts.

One, I better not get

5

off the bus.

6

wherever we're going.

7

off the bus, but it just doesn't make any sense.

that's one inquiry.

The second inquiry is, do I want to

10

two separate questions.

11

MR. THOMPSON:

It seems to me they are really

I don't know, Your Honor, but I

12

-- I would posit here that we do not really need in this

13

particular case to -- to understand the full extent of the

14

scope of the voluntariness test because the court below

15

clearly decided this case under Bostick and as a seizure

16

case.

QUESTION:

A seizure of the person or seizure of

the contraband?

MR. THOMPSON:

The person, Your Honor.

If we were writing on a blank slate

2

of course, you can ask citizens to cooperate?

that's a very desirable thing.

eliciting voluntary cooperation and nobody is under

compulsion.

9

What would be the objection to saying, policeman,
Certainly

But in those closed,

You don't have to be

What would be the objection to that?

MR. THOMPSON:

Well, as this Court noted in

10

Bostick, Your Honor, just because the police-citizen

11

encounter happens on a bus, there's no reason to establish

12

some kind of per se rule.

13

QUESTION:

Well, I assume Congress could enact a

14

statute like that, couldn't it, for Federal officers?

15

Couldn't Congress prescribe that whenever Federal drug

16

agents enter a bus, they -- and to conduct a -- a search,

17

they shall make such a statement?

18

MR. THOMPSON:

19

QUESTION:

20
21

I -- I don't know --

You would have no problem with

Congress doing that, would you?
MR. THOMPSON:

22

Honor, here that --

23

QUESTION:

I would -- I would say, Your

It might.

It might be bad policy.

24

And my question was are there policy objections to -- I'm

25

not saying what the constitutional rule is.

I understand

1

those arguments.

2

find out if that would cause a practical problem or not.

3

I'm just, for my own benefit, trying to

MR. THOMPSON:

I can think of three reasons.

4

Your Honor, this Court has consistently held that we --

5

you do not want to saddle law enforcement officers with

6

some kind of bright line test in Fourth Amendment cases.

7

That's very important here when I would submit that

8

Bostick is an appropriate vehicle to determine the

9

validity of consent.

10

In these particular cases, it's -- it's very

11

difficult.

12

developing situation, and warnings would not be --

13

You have an unstructured, rapidly evolving and

QUESTION:

And one of the difficulties with --

14

with a warning is, you know, Miranda was supposed to be a

15

bright line test where, you know, we didn't have to argue

16

about anything.

17

deciding whether somebody introduced -- was interrogating

18

and that sort of thing.

19

requirement like that, it's just another layer of

20

litigation.

21

Well, we had at least 60 or 70 cases here

MR. THOMPSON:

So, if you have some sort of a

Absolutely, Your Honor, and I

22

would direct the Court's attention to a case that was

23

cited in the Government's brief, United States v.

24

Stephens, where there was some appropriate warning, and

25

the court -- the Ninth Circuit in that particular case
21
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

said that the warning confused the passengers, intimidated

2

the passengers.

3

But --

QUESTION:

Well, I assume the other policy

4

objection is, the underlying premise of Justice Breyer's

5

suggestion is the Government has some obligation to teach

6

everybody about their rights.

7

sweeping proposition.

8

MR. THOMPSON:

9

QUESTION:

10

And that's a -- that's a

I would agree.

Especially when it's not required by

the Constitution.

11

MR. THOMPSON:

12

QUESTION:

I would agree, Justice --

May I ask you what significance, if

13

any -- I don't know if it's significant or not -- do you

14

attach to the fact that, as I understand it from the court

15

of appeals opinion, that this officer had made similar

16

requests several hundred times and only five or six people

17

had ever said no?

Is that relevant at all?

18

MR. THOMPSON:

19

Some people did say no.

20

QUESTION:

It is not relevant, Your Honor.
Most people --

You don't think that suggests that

21

perhaps most people thought they had an obligation to

22

answer?

23

MR. THOMPSON:

Well, Your Honor, as this Court

24

-- as this Court held in Delgado, simply because most

25

citizens cooperate and most citizens agree with the
22
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

officer's request, that's no indication that the consent

2

at issue is involuntary.

If there are no further questions, I would like
to reserve the remainder of my time.

QUESTION:

Ms. Spivey, we'll hear from you.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GWENDOLYN SPIVEY

8

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

9
10

Very well, Mr. Thompson.

MS. SPIVEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

This Court should reaffirm Bostick in its

12

entirety.

We are not arguing that advice should be

13

required.

Rather, we think that Bostick got it entirely

14

right with the language that advice is a factor

15

particularly worth noting.

16

would ask the Court to remand to the court of appeals, as

17

it did in Bostick, so that it can reconsider.

18

If Bostick is revised, we

I believe the key to this test -- and I don't

19

mean to sound presumptuous.

20

I think the key is that the Eleventh Circuit really was

21

trying to give voice to the seizure or -- and the consent

22

test, as set out in Bostick.

23

Court wrote -- it focused on what the police conduct --

24

conduct would have communicated to a reasonable person.

25

Having thought long and hard,

In Bostick at U.S. 437, the

And in Washington at 1357 and Guapi at 1395,
23
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

what the Eleventh Circuit focused on -- it said, it is

2

enough that the circumstances themselves would indicate

3

that the search can proceed only if consent is given.

4

I believe that the Eleventh Circuit parallels Bostick's

5

use of the word -- that focused on what does it

6

communicate with their use of the word indicate.

7

indicate necessarily refers back to -- it expressly refers

8

back to the circumstances, which is the totality.

9

So,

And

And while courts tend to focus most commonly on

10

whether or not advice was given or not given, I think

11

there are any number of acts or omissions that focus on

12

the police conduct --

13

QUESTION:

That -- that I think is true, but

14

could -- if their point is that if -- if you were to take

15

your case, this case before us, and say under the present

16

law and the test that you're enunciating, that you do have

to tell the passengers what I suggested earlier -- tell

Alderson Reporting Company

All right.

MS. SPIVEY:

So, what is -- can you

In a -- besides

He did not address -- he did not make any

factual findings as to the actual encounter.

And --

The freedom-to-leave test actually is

you're not free to leave the bus.

The district court said that -- he made a global

2

MS. SPIVEY:

No, Justice Scalia, I don't agree

3

with the first part of the question because the district

court made no findings whatsoever regarding the specifics

5

of the actual encounter or exchange between the -- the

6

defendants and the -- or the police officers and

7

individual passengers.

QUESTION:

ask for findings that were that detailed?

10
11

Did you ask for findings -- did you

MS. SPIVEY:

The trial -- neither trial counsel

for the Government nor the defense did, Your Honor.

12

But the district court then said there's nothing

13

coercive about this encounter, and I believe that's an

14

ultimate legal conclusion which, when the court of appeals

15

applied the correct test from Bostick, reached the correct

16

result.

17

QUESTION:

As far as Drayton is concerned,

18

there's nothing in the record other than that he lifted

his hands from his lap.

words, and so his consent rides on that gesture and what

21

it meant.

22

MS. SPIVEY:

Is there -- he didn't utter any

Yes.

Yes, Justice Ginsburg, that

23

is correct.

And I think it's clear under Schneckloth and

Bumper that mere acquiescence -- and that was -- is not

25

sufficient.

And that's why I was saying I think that the

police conduct can be either acts or -- and/or omissions.

not waiting on an answer.

a question, do you mind if I conduct a pat-down, and you

MS. SPIVEY:

I think that's a classic example,

Your Honor -- after you've just watched the other

passenger arrested and hauled across the top of you,

11

that's a classic example of mere acquiescence to a show of

Of course.

MS. SPIVEY:

But that's not ignoring them, Your

MS. SPIVEY:

I don't think -That -- that doesn't make sense.
I don't think a reasonable,

6

passenger sitting next to him as anything but a classic

7

example of a show of authority.

8

In -- in response to your question, Justice

9

Kennedy, to the Government earlier, I think that putting

10

the burden on the citizen shifts the -- the burden is on

11

the Government in every case to prove that the encounter

12

is consensual and that any consent given is voluntary and

13

is uncoerced.

14

And I think --

QUESTION:

The question is whether or not the

15

Government also has the burden to educate citizens as to

16

their rights in every encounter, whether or not there

17

isn't some obligation on the part of the citizen to know

18

and to exercise his rights or her rights.

19

MS. SPIVEY:

Justice Kennedy, I believe that

20

that ignores the demographic realities of the reasonable

bus passenger.

22

most bus passengers are economically disadvantaged, and

they don't know who their Congressman is or the Governor.

So, you want people to travel on

4

You think that's better for passengers.

MS. SPIVEY:

Certainly not, Your Honor.

looking at.

The question they looked at is whether the

circumstances here were so coercive that no reasonable

3

person could have given a consent that would have been

It's footnote 6 at page 8a.

They

12

And I think that is -- was their attempt to go

13

to the element of was this -- was this a coercive

14

environment.

15

which focuses on the police conduct and what it would have

16

communicated and I -- and then the consent test, which is

17

at 438, which focuses -- under Schneckloth includes a

18

focus on the personal factors, factors personal to the

19

defendant.

20

that those factors personal to the defendant were not

21

determinative because we're looking at a little higher

22

level of analysis as to whether this environment was so

23

coercive.

24
25

It distinguishes it from the seizure test

And I think that's why the Court here said

I do agree that in the context of your average
bus case, it's a very short encounter, very brief.

The

testimony was that in 15 to 20 minutes, the officer could

2

engage with two to three people.

3

5 to 10 minutes per person.

4

that the factors relating to seizure and the factors

relating to the -- the consent tend to be conflated, and

so it is sometimes sort of hard to sort out.

QUESTION:

Why -- why don't you agree with that?

asked when -- when you were responding to Justice Stevens

and you said, well, ultimately sure, anybody who gets

these warnings, with a teaspoonful of brains, is going to

17

And -- and it seemed to me that maybe the -- the

answer to the problem is there are some situations in

19

which if you don't give the warning, it does get to the

20

point of -- or is virtually a -- a coercive situation per

21

se, and it may be that there's no easy answer in those

circumstances.

23

If you don't let them know that they have a
