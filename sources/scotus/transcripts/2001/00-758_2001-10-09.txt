ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. GARRE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

11

For decades Federal employers and the Merit

12

Systems Protection Board have engaged in the common sense

13

practice of considering an employee's prior disciplinary

14

record in deciding what punishment is appropriate for

15

subsequent misconduct.

16

to do so, even when a prior disciplinary action is subject

17

to a pending labor grievance, although in that context,

18

the board permits the employee to collaterally attack the

19

prior actions in proceedings before it.

The settled practice has long been

20

In this case, the Federal circuit --

21

QUESTION:

If there is a collateral attack, the

22

employee says, look, I filed a grievance and it's pending,

23

what then is the burden of proof by the Government

24

employer?

25

MR. GARRE:

The Government employer bears the

1

burden of proving the action by a preponderance of the

2

evidence.

3

statute.

4

evidentiary focus of the hearing is on whether the

5

Government has proved the charges resulting in the adverse

6

action.

That's the standard that's set out in the
Now, that -- that burden of proof -- the

Here those charges --

7

QUESTION:

But what -- what is it with regard to

8

the prior offenses, if you will, that have -- for which

9

grievance procedures have been filed?

10

How is that then

addressed?

11

MR. GARRE:

Under the longstanding framework,

12

which is established by the board's Bolling decision, the

13

employer has to prove the fact of the prior action, and he

14

has to -- and the employer has to prove that it was

15

preceded by certain procedural protections:

16

the employee received advance notice of the action;

17

second, that the employee had an opportunity to respond to

18

the charges before the supervisor, as well as by a higher

19

authority within the agency; and third, that there was a

20

record --

21
22
23

QUESTION:

first, that

Does that just mean somebody higher

up the ladder in the employing agency?
MR. GARRE:

It does, and that's -- and that's

24

the same type of challenge that is framed in the early

25

stages of the grievance process.

It's an independent

1

authority than the supervisor.

2

In this case, the notice of removal was -- the

3

proposed notice was made by the respondent's supervisor,

4

but the -- the actual notice of decision was entered by a

5

labor relations specialist who -- who was in a different

6

district, independent from the supervisor.

7

QUESTION:

Well, what if the final action, the

8

decision to terminate the services of the employee -- what

9

if it had been based on the commission of some prior

10

failure as an employee and the grievance procedure had

11

proceeded and it had been determined that it was invalid?

12

MR. GARRE:

In that circumstance, the board has

13

held that it would be inappropriate to rely on that action

14

to defend the subsequent action.

15

a prior action is proved to be unreliable, there's no

16

basis for the Federal circuit's rule which presumes that

17

prior disciplinary actions are unreliable and effectively

18

presumes that employers act in faith when they take

19

important disciplinary actions --

However, until or unless

What happens --

25

action was improper.

As to one, it had already been

1

MR. GARRE:

That's correct.

And -- and that can

2

happen, but it doesn't undermine the legitimacy of prior

3

actions that have not been overturned.

4

And in addition, the board has a reopening

5

mechanism which permits employees to bring to the

6

attention of the board any new evidence, including any

7

evidence that a prior disciplinary action has been set

8

aside.

9
10

The grievance is not a step in the decision
making of the prior disciplinary action.

actions, whether or not they're -- they're subject to a

4

If a grievance does proceed and it proves

5

successful, then the board has a procedure by which it can

reopen an appeal and reconsider the appeal --

QUESTION:

What's the answer to my question?

My

question was -- should I repeat it or you have it?

MR. GARRE:

My understanding is that even when a

grievance is proceeding, the board would -- would proceed

11

with the processing of its appeal.

12

QUESTION:

My question is take the present

13

situation.

14

they're going to fire the person because of bad thing A

15

because there are previous disciplinary things, X, Y, and

16

Z.

17

Now, they fire the person because of A, and then they go

18

to the arbitrator who's doing X, Y, and Z, and the board

says, arbitrator, stop everything, cancel the proceeding,

don't continue because she doesn't work for us anymore.

still be stopped at the option of the arbitrator, and

there's nothing the employee can do about it.

In civil litigation generally, when

there -- when there's a proceeding that's dependent on a

procedure is for the second proceeding to be held at

abeyance pending the appeal of the first.

followed that model, then we could say, yes, the employer

could take the disciplinary step, but while that's being

challenged, the MSPB must hold its case in abeyance until

MR. GARRE:

It's -- it's very problematic.

But

2

first of all, the general rule applied by the Federal

3

courts in the collateral estoppel effect is the fact that

4

a prior case is on appeal doesn't prevent a court from

giving the underlying case collateral estoppel effect.

But -So that you don't have the -- the

anomaly of giving effect to a judgment that has been

14

MR. GARRE:

There are several problems with the

15

abeyance rule adopted by the Federal circuit, which is

16

essentially the narrow rule which is hypothesized by

17

respondent.

18

First and most fundamentally, the Civil Service

19

Reform Act limits the Federal circuit's scope of review to

whether a legal ruling of the board is arbitrary,

21

capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise contrary

22

to law.

did not cite any provision.

2

Secondly, as a policy matter, the abeyance rule

3

is very problematic.

4

would frustrate Congress' intent to streamline the

5

administrative appeals process --

QUESTION:

The abeyance rule, first of all,

Why -- why, if the agency action goes

If, as, and when the prior grievances are

overturned so that the MSPB would no longer have those to

rely on, then the remedy could be reinstatement with back

pay.

18

employee is placed in a non-duty/non-pay status when she's

19

removed by the agency, she continues to fill a permanent

20

slot on the agency's rolls, and if the abeyance rule is

21

going to require agencies to keep the employee in that

22

position for months, if not years, on end, that's

23

problematic from the employer's perspective.

MR. GARRE:

The -- the employee is placed --

board, she continues to fill that slot.

9

can replace her position with -- with temporary workers,

Now, the employee

10

but nevertheless, from the employer's standpoint, he's

The abeyance rule creates other problems.

simply to come up with a streamlined arbitration procedure

so instead of taking months and years, it's going to take

a month?

4

MR. GARRE:

I think they have tried, but the

5

fact is that in the Postal Service, there's currently

6

126,000 grievances pending in that process, backlogged.

7

And the fact is that grievances are taking as long as

years, not in every case, but certainly in many cases,

9

they're taking years to be processed through arbitration.

MR. GARRE:

the agency bears the burden of proof to prove -- of proof

agency action that is subject to section 706 review under

2

the APA, but that is not the right analogy, we

3

respectfully submit.

4

The right analogy would be to on-the-record

5

adjudication under section 554 and 556 of the APA, the

6

situation where an agency simply levels charges.

7

don't do anything about them, those charges will become

proof, then you become the defendant in -- in the MSPB.

If you

You -- you have the ability to put the Government to the

12

For example, in Jackson v. Veterans

the Federal circuit described it as follows:

review, an employee places the agency in the position of a

Right.
As I understand it, the Federal

circuit here said this was not in accordance with law.

And I was puzzled at that because they didn't seem to

point to any law.

6

MR. BRANDS:

Well, that is true, and perhaps the

7

brevity of the -- of the discussion by the court of

8

appeals can be explained on the ground of the fact that

9

the Government did not respond to any of respondent's

10
11

arguments in the court of appeals.
But the basic answer here is that what is not in

12

accordance with law about how the MSPB treats prior

13

disciplinary actions is that it disregards -- it

14

arbitrarily disregards the burden of proof.

15

QUESTION:

Well, but you -- you say it's not in

say it arbitrarily disregards the burden of proof.

3

MR. BRANDS:

That's precisely correct, although

4

as I said, in two situations that is a burden of proof

5

that should be very easy to discharge.

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. BRANDS:

Yes, and I understand.
It's only in that third situation.

8

And note that the Government cannot rely on collateral

9

estoppel in that situation because it is well established

10

-- it's hornbook law -- that -- that when something is

11

reviewed de novo, it is not subject to collateral review.

12

For example, Wright and Miller say that in section 4433.

13

QUESTION:

Well, but if -- if you're talking

14

about judicial proceedings, I don't think those rules

15

would necessarily carry over to this sort of rather low

16

level administrative proceeding.

17

MR. BRANDS:

Your Honor, far be it for me, of

18

course, to -- to argue that collateral estoppel should

19

apply, but the MSPB, for example, has applied collateral

20

estoppel to prior final arbitral orders, and we don't

21

necessarily see anything wrong with that.

22

that if the Government later comes before the MSPB and

23

points to a prior that was upheld by an arbitrator, it

thereby -- it thereby discharges its burden of proving

that the prior conduct actually happens.

And we think

We don't think

that in a situation where that prior is being reviewed de

charged in that prior disciplinary action actually

4

occurred.

5

QUESTION:

Well, but to say that the prior is

reviewed de novo, I'm not sure that that is an entirely

7

accurate statement because it was a prior that was left

unchallenged, I take it, at the time.

MR. BRANDS:

No, Your Honor.

All three priors

10

here were, in fact, under review at the time that the

Government pointed to them as -- as --

QUESTION:

So, your statement then is limited to

the sort of prior which is under review.
MR. BRANDS:

That's -- that's precisely correct.

We're not saying that the Government, when -- when

charging an employee with misconduct, may not point to

that prior, but when it comes before the MSPB, it must

discharge its burden of proof.

there is a prior here, as well as the current conduct,

situation because if the -- if the employee thought that a

preponderance did not exist, then he or she would probably

have taken it to the MSPB or to an arbitrator.

MR. BRANDS:

Well, it actually said it twice,

2

Your Honor.

But the reason why we believe that's what it

3

said is the Douglas analysis means that the MSPB in any

4

given case must ensure that there is a fit between the

5

punishment and the crime.

6

looks at the gravity of the particular offense, but it

also looks at other aggravating circumstances.

Government could simply come in and say, we got this one

these 19 others have never been proven, but you have to

What -- what happens in a disciplinary action is

that the Government -- a supervisor will simply charge the

misconduct, and then from there, it goes through these

22

grievance steps that are simply nothing other than another

finally, it will go to an arbitrator, and that is the

QUESTION:

Well, the agency adjudicator -Surely the agency has to find, by a

preponderance of the evidence, that the employee was

been leveled in the past rather than now before the agency

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE

13

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

14

MR. GARRE:

Thank you, Mr. Brands.

The Federal circuit ruling in this

15

case is not based in any way on the burden of proof

16

applied in board proceedings.

17

argue before the board that the -- that the board was

18

applying the wrong burden of proof in challenging or

19

considering her prior actions.

20

And respondent didn't even

Respondent's reliance on the Douglas case is a

21

little bit odd because that case was followed by the

22

Bolling case and scores of other precedents which

23

established the framework by which the Merit Systems

Protection Board considers prior disciplinary actions,

25

even when they're subject to grievance.

The board allows

action, and then it -- it allows the employee -- in

That -- that comports with the employer's burden

It's supported by decades of

citing to any provision of -- of law or anything else.
