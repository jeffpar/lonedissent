ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES BOPP, JR.,

7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

8
9

MR. BOPP:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

Like most states, Minnesota selects its judges

10

through periodic popular elections.

11

speech is severely restricted, the people are denied

12

access to the information they need to make an informed

13

choice.

14

elected officials, Minnesota's Announce Clause, as now

15

interpreted by its supreme court, goes too far resulting

16

in elections without campaigns.

17

And when candidates'

While state court judges are different from other

QUESTION:

Could we find out from you just what

18

the Announce Clause prohibits that isn't already

19

prohibited by the Pledges and Promises Clause, as it's

20

been interpreted?

21

MR. BOPP:

Yes, Justice O'Connor.

The Announce

22

Clause prohibits, according the decision of the Eighth

23

Circuit, any general -- allows general discussions of the

24

law, while it prohibits any implying of how a person would

25

rule -- a candidate would rule, on an issue or case before

1

the Court.

2
3

QUESTION:

How does that differ, then, from the

Pledges or Promises Clause?

4

MR. BOPP:

The Pledges and Promises Clause

5

prohibits any pledge or promise that -- other than

6

faithful performance of duties in office.

7

between "announce," the plain language of the clause, and

8

"pledge or promise" -- "announce" is simply making known,

9

is one of the formulations of the Eighth Circuit, or

10

implying; while "pledging or promising" is making a

11

commitment on how you would rule in a future case.

12

QUESTION:

The difference

But you think the Announce Clause,

13

even as interpreted by the Eighth Circuit to be the same

14

as the ABA canon, goes beyond that?

15

MR. BOPP:

Well, Your Honor, there is one aspect

16

of the current 1990 ABA canon that has -- was not

17

discussed by the Ninth Circuit or by the ABA brief.

18

that --

19

QUESTION:

And

And where does that appear in your

20

brief?

Where is the ABA canon we're talking about?

21

is it?

I want to look at it while you're talking about

22

it.

23

MR. BOPP:

Where

I do not have a reference to the ABA

24

canon, Your Honor.

I apologize.

The ABA canon states

25

that a -- the 1990 ABA canon states that a candidate may

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

not make statements to commit, or appears to commit in

2

deciding cases, controversies, or issues likely to come

3

before the Court.

4

seem to imply that the 1990 canon was similar, if not the

5

same, as the 1972 canon, they did not discuss the

6

difference between the words "announce" and "commit."

7

While the ABA and the Eighth Circuit

"Commit," if you look in the dictionary, says

8

"pledge."

9

narrow under plain --

10

And, thus, the 1990 canon appears to be more

QUESTION:

Well, the Eighth Circuit did say that

11

it was -- that Minnesota's provision is the same as the

12

ABA canon, right?

13

MR. BOPP:

It did, Your -- it did, Your Honor.

14

QUESTION:

And the ABA canon prohibits

15

candidates, judicial candidates, from making statements

16

that commit or appear to commit a candidate.

17

MR. BOPP:

Yes.

18

QUESTION:

And that looks very much like the

19

Pledge or Promise language.

20

should interpret this.

21

MR. BOPP:

I -- I don't know how we

Well, one of the problems, Your

22

Honor, is that the January 29th opinion of the Minnesota

23

Supreme Court interpreting the Announce Clause adopted the

24

Eighth Circuit opinion and its interpretations.

25

QUESTION:

Right.
5

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. BOPP:

Unfortunately, the Eighth Circuit had

2

conflicting statements about the scope of the

3

interpretation that it was announcing.

4

QUESTION:

Well, you were -- you appear to be

5

arguing, in your brief at least, that the Announce Clause

6

is unconstitutionally vague.

7

MR. BOPP:

Yes, Your Honor.

8

QUESTION:

Is that your argument you're making?

9

MR. BOPP:

Yes, we are.

10

QUESTION:

But did you make that argument below?

11

MR. BOPP:

Yes, we did, as to the interpretation

12

proffered in the district court, adding the words "likely

13

to come before the Court."

14

Honor, is that the Eighth Circuit sua sponte added other

15

glosses to this canon, even though it was not advocated by

16

any of the parties.

17

QUESTION:

18

But where we are now, Your

You didn't include a vagueness

challenge in your petition for certiorari, did you?

19

MR. BOPP:

Yes, we did.

20

QUESTION:

Is it in the question on which we

21
22
23

granted cert, do you think?
MR. BOPP:

No, but it is encompassed within the

violation of the First Amendment that we allege.

24

QUESTION:

But I wouldn't have thought vagueness

25

was a First Amendment issue.
6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. BOPP:

Well, in the context of First

2

Amendment protected speech, a -- something that chills

3

First Amendment speech, because of -- it is a vague rule,

4

and therefore does not provide a bright line necessary for

5

the exercise of that speech, that it constitutes a First

6

Amendment violation.

7

QUESTION:

One of the statements of the Eighth

8

Circuit -- and I don't have the citation to the brief; I

9

have the citation to the Federal Third -- 247 F.3d 881.

10

It says that the Announce Clause applies only to

11

discussion of a candidate's predisposition on issues

12

likely to come before the candidate if elected to office.

13
14
15

MR. BOPP:

That is one of the three

constructions.
QUESTION:

If we could -- would you agree that

16

that's perhaps the narrowest of the three constructions?

17

I want to find what might be the most likely statement to

18

survive review and then have you discuss that, because I

19

take it that you would not be

20

even that is constitutional.

21

MR. BOPP:

-- you would not agree that

It is not the narrowest, Your Honor,

22

because it uses the word "issue."

23

formulations --

There are other

24

QUESTION:

Yes.

25

MR. BOPP:

-- in the Eighth Circuit case where
7

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

they use the word "decide a case," such as on page 45a of

2

the petition -- the petition appendix.

3

candidates from, quote, "implying how they would decide

4

cases," end of quote.

5

appendix to the petition, say that, quote -- that the

6

canon, quote, "applies only to discussions of a

7

candidate's predisposition on issues," as you've quoted,

8

and then finally concludes on page 53 with the statement

9

that it prohibits candidates, quote, "only from publicly

It prevents

And they also, on page 52a of the

10

making known how they would decide issues."

11

conflicting interpretations of --

12

QUESTION:

So we have

Well, let's take the -- let's take

13

the last one.

I take it, if that were the authoritative

14

narrowing constructing that were before us, you would

15

disagree with its constitutionality.

16

MR. BOPP:

Yes, Your Honor.

17

QUESTION:

Would you agree that that would be a

18

constitutional standard if it were part of a code of

19

judicial ethics that applied to the judge after the judge

20

was on the bench?

21

MR. BOPP:

No, and -- but I believe that this

22

canon does apply to judges once they are elected and on

23

the bench.

24
25

QUESTION:

Well, are judges, after they are on

the bench, subject to, all of the same rights that they
8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

have before they go on the bench, insofar as making public

2

comments?

3

MR. BOPP:

No, they may be limited in a number

4

of different ways, Your Honor, that are necessary to

5

advance compelling interests.

6

QUESTION:

Well, why is it that, if an election

7

is in July, the State can, under your view, not prohibit

8

statements in June before he's elected, but they can

9

prohibit the statements in August, after he's elected?

10

MR. BOPP:

Well, Your Honor, the First Amendment

11

applies -- has its most urgent application in campaigns

12

for election, and it is -- and while both judges and

13

judicial candidates may be limited in their speech, it has

14

never been held that simply announcing your views on a

15

disputed legal or political issue constitutes an

16

indication of partiality such that would justify, for

17

instance, recusal or disqualification.

18

QUESTION:

But I thought you said it would be

19

okay.

Then maybe I didn't understand your answer.

20

thought you said that the kind of limitation that Justice

21

Kennedy referred to would be all right for sitting judges,

22

that you could prohibit sitting judges from letting their

23

views be known on any controversial issues.

24

MR. BOPP:

25

your understanding.

I

Well, then I misspoke, if that was

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

QUESTION:

Like the incorporation doctrine or

substantive due process and so forth --

3

MR. BOPP:

Canon 4 --

4

QUESTION:

-- you think you could prohibit

5
6

judges from discussing those matters.
MR. BOPP:

No.

Canon 4 -- and in fact, Canon

7

4(b) of the Minnesota canons encourages judges to propose

8

changes in the substantive and procedural law, even

9

individually.

10

QUESTION:

Sitting judges -- sitting judges run

11

for election.

So whatever rights the contender would have

12

in an election, I assume that the sitting judge who was

13

running for reelection would have those same rights, in

14

your view.

15

MR. BOPP:

We believe that they should.

16

QUESTION:

Because the sitting judge could not

17
18

be restricted, could he or she, in a way?
MR. BOPP:

Well, sitting judges are restricted,

19

for instance, from commenting on pending cases that are

20

pending before them, quite properly.

21

talking about stating general views about the law.

But here we are

22

QUESTION:

So sitting --

23

QUESTION:

You wouldn't object to candidates

24

being prohibited from commenting about particular cases

25

either, would you?
10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. BOPP:

No, I would not.

2

QUESTION:

I didn't take your objection to be

3

that you say, you know, that there's a case pending in the

4

courts, if I were appointed, I'll tell you how I would

5

decide that case.

You --

6

MR. BOPP:

We --

7

QUESTION:

-- wouldn't permit that, would you?

8

MR. BOPP:

We believe that that can properly

QUESTION:

I thought you gave examples, or your

9
10

be --

11

-- one of the briefs gave examples of commenting on

12

specific decisions that had been rendered by the Minnesota

13

Supreme Court, and you said that restraint on that comment

14

was impermissible.

15

MR. BOPP:

Yes.

16

QUESTION:

Am I not right?

17

MR. BOPP:

Yes.

18

QUESTION:

So you're making --

19

QUESTION:

That was a past case.

That is our position.

That was a

20

distinction you're making between past cases and pending

21

cases in the court that are likely to come before you if

22

you're elected.

23

MR. BOPP:

Yes, I -- the First Amendment

24

protects discussion of past cases.

However, the Eighth

25

Circuit opinion only allows discussion of past cases while
11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the enforcement authorities, specifically the Office of

2

Lawyers Professional Responsibility, had previously said

3

that you could criticize those opinions.

4

QUESTION:

Well, supposing that -- supposing

5

that Minnesota -- the Minnesota Supreme Court had

6

announced that its Fourth Amendment was more protective

7

than the federal Fourth Amendment and a candidate running

8

for that court saw that several cases, the evidence had

9

been suppressed in Minnesota courts, the defendant was

10

acquitted, so he said, "I think we should go back to the

11

idea that our Fourth Amendment is the same as the federal

12

Fourth Amendment."

13

rule?

Would that be permitted under this

14

MR. BOPP:

Under the Announce Clause?

15

QUESTION:

Under the Announce Clause.

16

MR. BOPP:

Not if it's considered implying how

17
18

you would rule in a future case.
QUESTION:

But do we know that -- do we -- is

19

there any mechanism for getting a clarification?

And the

20

big problem in this case is this is a frontal attack, and

21

so we have no specific examples.

22

think this would fit, and I think that wouldn't fit."

23

there any mechanism in Minnesota for seeking

24

clarification?

25

Court's current rule is, indeed, the ABA's 1990 rule?

And you can say, "I
Is

For example, whether the Minnesota Supreme

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. BOPP:

You can seek a private advisory

2

opinion that is not binding on either the office or the

3

board.

4

suit was filed regarding other matters, and they declined

5

to provide that advice.

And petitioner Wersal sought such an opinion after

6

QUESTION:

Mr. Bopp, I would assume your answer

7

would be that if it's too fuzzy for us to understand what

8

it means in order to rule upon its constitutionality, it's

9

also too fuzzy for a judicial candidate to know what it

10

means in order to conform his conduct to it and,

11

therefore, unconstitutional.

12

MR. BOPP:

Yes, sir, Your Honor, not only to

13

candidates, but this canon binds the family members, the

14

supporters of the candidate.

15

viewed to violate this construction -- this new

16

construction of this rule, then the candidate, him or

17

herself, is subject to discipline or removal from office.

18

QUESTION:

If they say anything that is

Well, I still want to make clear your

19

position.

Your position is -- is that the judge can,

20

after the judge's election, be disciplined, sanctioned for

21

certain remarks that he could not be sanctioned for before

22

the election.

Is that correct?

23

MR. BOPP:

No, Your Honor, and if I gave you

24

that impression, I apologize.

25

QUESTION:

In other words, the rule -13

MR. BOPP:

QUESTION:

-- post and pre-election, the

MR. BOPP:

The rule --

5

QUESTION:

-- to speak are the same.

6

MR. BOPP:

The rule is the same.

3

rights --

But I think

7

the point I was making was that once a judge assumes

8

office, there are restrictions on, for instance, his

9

ability to discuss a pending case that is not imposed upon

10

a lawyer that is not involved in the case in any way.

11

QUESTION:

Well, do you claim --

12

MR. BOPP:

So then --

13

QUESTION:

All right.

Then your position is

14

that there is a difference as it applies to pending cases

15

as to which a sitting judge has to -- to which a sitting

16

judge has been assigned.

17

MR. BOPP:

Yes, there are specific ethical

18

QUESTION:

And --

19

MR. BOPP:

-- canons that apply in that.

20

QUESTION:

And that's all.

21

MR. BOPP:

And that's appropriate --

22

QUESTION:

Now --

23

MR. BOPP:

-- an appropriate limit.

24

QUESTION:

-- are there limits on what the

25

candidate can say?

Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. BOPP:

Yes.

I --

2

QUESTION:

And those are what?

3

MR. BOPP:

It's in the realm of Pledges and

4

Promises.

5

sitting judges or not, and that is that a candidate for

6

judicial office shall not pledge or promise certain

7

results in deciding a particular case or issue in a case

8

without regard to the law or facts of the case.

9

It would apply to candidates whether they're

QUESTION:

Suppose he said, "There are a lot of

10

criminal cases pending," and, to take the Chief Justice's

11

hypothetical, "we've gone too far in interpreting the

12

Fourth Amendment, and I'm going to be more strict."

13

your view --

14

MR. BOPP:

I think that's a --

15

QUESTION:

-- that could be prohibited.

16

MR. BOPP:

No, that is allowed, Your Honor,

In

17

because he's not promising certain results in a particular

18

case.

22
23

25

That is, again -QUESTION:

He says, "I promise when these cases

come before me, this is what I'll do."
MR. BOPP:

Then that is a pledge or promise of

an outcome.
QUESTION:

And in your view, that can be

prohibited.
MR. BOPP:

Yes, because there is a -15

3

QUESTION:

Well, I'm surprised you take that

MR. BOPP:

Well, Your Honor, there is a public

view.

4

perception of the impartiality of the judiciary that I

5

think properly can be taken into account.

6

QUESTION:

Well --

7

MR. BOPP:

And I think this rule announces a

8

rule that is consistent with the judge's obligation to

9

decide cases in accordance with his or her role.

10

QUESTION:

Well, that's an extremely fine line

11

you're drawing, it seems to me, because I think a moment

12

ago, in response to my question, you said that a candidate

13

would be prohibited, and wrongly prohibited, under your

14

view -- on your view of it and from saying that Minnesota

15

should adopt the federal Fourth Amendment standard rather

16

than the more liberal Fourth Amendment standard that the

17

Supreme Court of Minnesota hypothetically had it.

18

that a candidate ought to be allowed to do that, but he

19

isn't under the Minnesota rule?

20
21

MR. BOPP:

You say

He is not, under the -- well, to the

extent that we know what the Announce Clause means --

22

QUESTION:

Yeah.

23

MR. BOPP:

-- with this conflicting formulations

24

under the Eighth Circuit opinion, talking about cases or

25

issues -- talking about, implying, or making known -- to

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the extent that we know the rule, it would appear that

2

such a statement would be prohibited --

3

QUESTION:

And you --

4

MR. BOPP:

-- because it would imply what he

5
6
7
8
9

would rule in the future.
QUESTION:

And you say that the First Amendment

prohibits that?
MR. BOPP:

No, I'd say the First Amendment

protects talking about prior decisions.

10

QUESTION:

What about --

11

MR. BOPP:

And one of the problems is we're

12

talking about the rule -- the Minnesota rule versus --

13

QUESTION:

Yeah.

14

MR. BOPP:

-- other proposed rules.

15

QUESTION:

But if --

16

QUESTION:

What about comment on a -- by a

17

candidate who is not yet a judge on a case which is then

18

pending before the court?

19

prohibit the candidate from saying, "I've been reading

20

about this case.

21

believe so and so should be convicted, and I think the

22

sentence ought to be the following."

23

consistently with the First Amendment, prohibit that kind

24

of a comment?

25

In your view, can the State

I know what the evidence is, and I

MR. BOPP:

Could the State,

Well, there would seem to be, under

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Gentile, more leeway for a lawyer not in a pending case to

2

discuss a pending case.

3

QUESTION:

What's the answer to my question?

4

MR. BOPP:

I think -- I think it could not be

5

prohibited.

6

QUESTION:

In the question that the Chief

7

Justice asked, suppose the judge said, "I pledge and

8

promise that if you elect me, I will vote in every Fourth

That's

10

a pledge and a promise, which I thought your argument

11

started out saying you accept that the pledge or promise

MR. BOPP:

I do, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

-- that you can't go on that to the

views you've held your whole life over the incorporation

6

MR. BOPP:

Yes.

And while judges certainly have

views, and they announce these views in numerous different

8

ways, if they are binding themselves not to have an open

9

mind and to decide a case in advance, then that is a

10

violation of the oath, and that type of pledge or promise

11

should be and can be prohibited under the First Amendment.

12

QUESTION:

Is this different from that?

That

13

is, I read through the Minnesota Bar Association's brief,

Now, if that's what they're trying to

do -- do you agree that is what this is trying to do?

with it is that the ABA suggested that "commit" means the

okay for a sitting judge to make known to the public his

view on something like the death penalty when he does it

in an opinion and, therefore, that can be out there.

6

MR. BOPP:

Yes, it is --

Subject to criticism, indeed.

MR. BOPP:

Yes --

him in an election cannot let be known what his view is on

MR. BOPP:

It is perfectly appropriate for a

judge to do that in an opinion or in speeches or a law

review article.

15

QUESTION:

In speeches?

You mean the judge

16

could go out and -- a sitting judge can go out and make a

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

13

MR. GILBERT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

try to clarify some of the questions and answers that have

16

been provided as to what the construed rule in Minnesota

that the rule only prohibits candidates from --

Alderson Reporting Company

That

1

is the narrow construction of this Eighth Circuit opinion.

2

That is the construction that's being applied by the two

3

boards that I represent, and that is the construction that

4

has been incorporated in an authoritative order by the

5

Minnesota Supreme Court.

6

QUESTION:

What about the example I posed to

7

your opponent?

Someone says, "I think the Minnesota

8

Supreme Court's ruling on the Fourth Amendment, the state

9

Fourth Amendment being broader, is wrong, and I -- if you

10

will elect me as a judge, I would try to change that

11

around."

12

MR. GILBERT:

Your Honor, this is where the

13

record is very clear as to what Mr. Wersal has done.

14

in response to your question, the candidate could

15

criticize a prior decision of a judge, but could not say

16

as to a future case how that candidate would decide the

17

case.

18

And

And that's precisely -QUESTION:

So let me put that to the test.

If I

19

say, "I think the decision of the Supreme Court of

20

Minnesota two years ago saying that the Fourth Amendment

21

-- state Fourth Amendment protected more than the federal

22

Fourth Amendment is wrong," he could do that, but he

23

couldn't say, "If you elect me to the Supreme Court, I

24

would carry out my view."

25

MR. GILBERT:

Well, that would be a future case.
28

12

pages 86 to 91, they contain the actual statements that

13

Mr. Wersal made as part of his campaign.

15

MR. GILBERT:

If you look at the first

about his judicial philosophy.

First of all, he talked

What does that mean?

He said,

Does that dichotomy make any sense at

already precedent in the State of Minnesota.

that's the point.

MR. GILBERT:

Your Honor, that's the point.

It's more than that.

that does not, within the language that the Supreme Court

has adopted, it does not imply how he will vote on that

whether he's going to overturn it.

can say and what Mr. Wersal said -- if you look at the

Minnesota Supreme Court, he said just as you indicated,

reading from?

MR. GILBERT:

If you look at pages -- page 36,

for example, of the -- this is of the Joint Appendix -- he

says, on abortion, "The Court ordered the State must use

23

24

contrary.

25

This is under the topic of "Examples of Judicial

4

But then he goes into greater detail on page

QUESTION:

But is the statement at page 36 that

you read -- is that proscribable under the State's rule?

5

MR. GILBERT:

No.

And that's the point.

What

6

has happened here, Your Honor, is that there was a

7

complaint filed against Mr. Wersal for all of this

8

campaign material.

9

Board, Marcia Johnson, in an opinion, on pages 20 and 21

And the then-director of the Lawyers

10

of this appendix, said that the statements made by Mr.

11

Wersal are not proscribable.

12

rule is narrowed.

13

And that's even before the

And if you look at page 21, the executive

14

director said specifically that Mr. Wersal can criticize

15

prior decisions of the Court.

what the Board on Judicial Standards did in --

And that's consistent with

May he also, at the same time as they

criticized the decision, say, "I do not believe in stare

MR. GILBERT:

Yes.

He can't, because that

is -QUESTION:

going to rule on the case then?

it's still -- the distinction is --

3
4

People might be able to imply from it, but

QUESTION:

Might be able to imply that I don't

believe in stare decisis and I think this case is wrong.

5

(Laughter.)

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. GILBERT:

Pretty clear, I think.
No, and I understand what you're

8

saying, Your Honor.

The distinction that's made, if you

9

look at all the cases that have dealt with this issue, is

10

a distinction between past cases on one hand and then

11

pending and future cases on another.

12

QUESTION:

As long as you're silent on your

13

views on stare decisis, that's a fine distinction.

14

you do reveal your views on stare decisis, that

15

distinction is meaningless.

16

MR. GILBERT:

Perhaps.

But if

There could be other

17

issues that come up in terms of a case that would be a

18

vehicle to overturn particular decisions -- standing,

19

things of that kind.

20

QUESTION:

So now you're saying there's a

21

distinction between issues and cases.

And I'm saying

22

you're categorically stating your view about a particular

23

issue, as the Chief Justice's example states, and you also

24

categorically state, "I think stare decisis has no place

25

in constitutional adjudication."

Can he do that?

Now, what would happen if, instead of

2

very fine line, assuming that it's in good faith.

3

MR. GILBERT:

Your Honor, the Board on Judicial

4

Standards or the Lawyers Board would have jurisdiction

5

with respect to a violation which sounds like a technical

6

violation, as you describe it, and could impose some

7

discipline, but I would suspect that discipline would be

very minute, if at all --

QUESTION:

Could a state --

-- under those circumstances.

-- make a violation of the provisions

you described a criminal offense?
MR. GILBERT:

No, Your Honor.

These are not

criminal statues.
QUESTION:

But could a state do it under the

First Amendment?

proposition, that can -- a state can impose a civil

sanction, but not a criminal sanction?

Is there any authority you have for the

I'm not aware of any authority

that would allow a criminal sanction for such a thing.

QUESTION:

Can I ask you one other question?

QUESTION:

That's not my question.

Is there any

to impose a civil sanction but not a criminal sanction on

QUESTION:

This is a technical question, but the

sentence you started out reading from the Eighth Circuit's

opinion is not identical to the ABA canon.

if this rule differs from the ABA canon and is stricter,

one could say there's a less restrictive alternative,

namely the ABA canon.

Do I assume that, in fact,

10

Minnesota does mean it's indistinguishable from ABA canon,

which is what the ABA says?

12

How do I deal with that?

MR. GILBERT:

Or what your opponent says?

Your Honor, our position is, just

as the ABA indicated, that our rule is the functional

construction that they are going to place on their clause.

QUESTION:

Whatever that is.

12

MR. GILBERT:

Well, this construction, Your

Honor, is, for all practical purposes, identical to the

commitment clause.

And --

Mr. Gilbert, may I ask -Yes.

-- a question based on what you said

about stare decisis?

You say -- have said consistently

19

you can discuss your judicial philosophy.

20

wouldn't one's position on stare decisis fall under

21

judicial philosophy?

22

MR. GILBERT:

QUESTION:

Well, why

I think it would, Your Honor.

So that -- so you're changing back

24

then, because you said a while ago that stare decisis --

25

if you said, "I think that decision about the Fourth

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. GILBERT:

Your Honor, you can put them

together.

5

conclude from that what the ramifications would be if that

6

particular candidate came to the Supreme Court, for

7

example, on what the candidate would do with respect to

8

that decision -- whether the candidate would overturn or

not.

I think the question was, could someone then

how he's going to vote and, therefore, would not be --

12

MR. GILBERT:

MR. GILBERT:

-- would not be acceptable, right?
Yes, Your Honor, with the

distinction being to protect the integrity of the

16

judiciary.

17

QUESTION:

Well, let me ask about that.

You

18

know, in evaluating whether a state has demonstrated the

19

kind of significant interest necessary to abridge speech,

20

it seems to me we have to look at the entirety of the

21

state law to see what interest it's pursuing.

22

I, frankly, am absolutely befuddled by the fact

23

that Minnesota wants its judges elected -- that's its

24

constitutional provision -- and then enacts statutory

25

provisions that are intended to prevent the electorate
40
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

from knowing, even by implication, how these candidates

2

are going to behave when they get on the bench.

3

to me a total contradiction.

4

like a legislative attempt to simply repeal Minnesota's

5

constitutional provision providing for the election of

6

judges, which is a neat and easy way to get rid of it if

7

you can't do it by plebiscite.

8
9

It seems

And, indeed, it looks to me

Why does it make any sense to vote for a judge
in an election, a judge who is not able, even by

10

implication, to tell the electorate what kind of a judge

11

he would be?

12

MR. GILBERT:

Well, but, Your Honor, that's the

13

fallacy in that statement, is that a candidate can tell

14

the electorate what kind of candidate they are.

15

thing that the candidate cannot say -- it's a very limited

QUESTION:

-- if that indicates a

disqualification or a lack of temperament for the bench,

what kind of judges they want.

QUESTION:

Why is that any worse than litigants

3

who come before a judge who's already sitting and who has

4

said in a prior opinion that he thinks the Fourth

5

Amendment in Minnesota should be interpreted the same way

6

the federal Fourth Amendment is?

7

MR. GILBERT:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. GILBERT:

Why --

Because in --

-- is that any different?
Because in a prior opinion, due

10

process was accorded, because the judge actually heard the

11

argument of the litigants, heard the facts and the

12

applicable law.

13

QUESTION:

You mean a judge can't have an

14

opinion without hearing from all sides and going in briefs

15

and so forth?

16

MR. GILBERT:

17

QUESTION:

18

Absolutely.

Well, what if -- even if he gives a

speech, does he have to first have this sort of vetting?

19

MR. GILBERT:

Not at all, Your Honor.

The only

20

-- again, the limited restriction here is that the -- a

21

judge cannot -- I'm sorry -- a judicial candidate cannot

22

prejudge a future case, cannot say, "I think this statute

23

over here is unconstitutional," or, "I think, in consumer

24

fraud cases, that anybody who wins is entitled to punitive

25

damages."

2

whether it is a significant State interest, because you

3

have a constitution that says, "We're going to have

4

judicial elections."

5

but as long as that's in your constitution, I find it hard

6

to believe that it is a significant State interest of

7

Minnesota to prevent elections from being informed.

8
9

See, I just question

Now, that may be a very bad idea,

MR. GILBERT:

Well, again, Your Honor, we're

trying to weigh the different interests.

I am sure you

10

wouldn't suggest that the State doesn't have a compelling

11

interest in the integrity of the judiciary, and that is a

12

competing interest that is being weighed here, and that

13

results in the commitment clause that the ABA has adopted

14

and the parallel provision that has been construed

15

narrowly by the Eighth Circuit, which, again, only forbids

16

or prohibits a judge saying, "I'm going to decide this

17

particular issue this way in the future."

18

QUESTION:

So you're saying the public doesn't

know enough in order to determine whether a judge has the

20

requisite qualifications for office.

21

MR. GILBERT:

Your Honor, I'm not saying that

22

the public knows or doesn't know.

The concern is what

23

happens if that candidate is elected, and then you or any

other litigant comes before that candidate, who is now a

judge, and tries to litigate the issue that the judge has

MR. GILBERT:

the judicial candidate would support.

Because we didn't have the

interpretation that was later adopted --

Right.

-- by the Eighth Circuit.

What

Counsel says is that the new vagueness issues that he's

10

raising are a consequence of the opinion which your

11

Supreme Court has adopted, the Eighth Circuit's opinion.

12

MR. GILBERT:

Well, we -- Your Honor, you're

13

correct.

14

opinion that's being appealed here.

15

petitioners have done is, they have refused to acknowledge

16

that narrow construction.

17

that the Minnesota Supreme Court has now authoritatively

18

adopted that as a state court construction.

19

of the matter is, as well, that the Eighth Circuit already

20

opined on what the standard is, and that issue was not

21

raised by them, in terms of vagueness.

However, the Eighth Circuit opinion is the

whether it's, it unconstitutionally impinges on the

2

freedom of speech.

3

of speech is that you cannot -- you cannot chill speech by

4

having a prohibition that is not clear.

5

that this is a separate issue from the First Amendment

issue at all.

And one of the principles of freedom

7

MR. GILBERT:

8

QUESTION:

9

I don't think

Well, they have not --

We have lots of cases like that,

about chilling speech because it's not clear what the

10

coverage of the prohibition is.

11

MR. GILBERT:

Your Honor, in their petition,

12

though, they have not made those kinds of arguments

13

specifically as to --

14
15
16

QUESTION:

They certainly did in the reply

brief.
MR. GILBERT:

They have in the reply brief, but

17

not in the petition, which was the question that was asked

18

previously.

19

court has been really clear in the Broadrick v. Oklahoma

20

case, for example, and the Colton v. Kentucky case, that

21

sometimes rules and statutes -- and, frankly, all the

22

time, rules and statutes are not conducive to mathematical

23

precision, that there are going to be, as the Court has

24

said, germs of uncertainty in how these laws are applied.

25

And these laws are going to be applied based upon facts

And as to vagueness, I should say that this

1

and circumstances.

2

it's really significant that we don't have any facts and

3

circumstances as to what Mr. Wersal wants to say.

4

QUESTION:

And in this particular case, I think

Well, I think you could set up a

5

system where you get advisory opinions, but I don't know

6

that we've ever allowed that to be done in the First

7

Amendment area.

8

MR. GILBERT:

9

QUESTION:

Oh --

"Please may I say this?"

You know,

10

you submit what you want to say, and somebody tells you,

11

"Yeah, okay.

12

contrary to our approach to the First Amendment.

13

You can say that."

MR. GILBERT:

That's certainly

Well, Your Honor, I don't -- Your

14

Honor, first of all, I'm not a proponent of what

15

that.

16

consideration in upholding the Hatch Act against

17

constitutional attack, because there was the ability of

18

people who had questions about the application of the

19

statute to actually go to an advisory board and get an

20

opinion.

21

But in Letter Carriers, that was a critical

Similarly here, both of the boards that are

parties to this case do provide advisory opinions, and

they provide them on short notice, as well.

it is a consideration in terms of if there is a close

So there is

I'm not suggesting it's a substitute, but

2

to how that particular situation would be interpreted,

3

they can go to the boards and ask that question.

QUESTION:

from the board?

8

MR. GILBERT:

9

If somebody wants to give a speech in a

Well, they actually do advisory

opinions over the phone, Your Honor, on very short order,

10

and they could do it in a matter of hours or days,

11

depending upon what the needs are.

12

QUESTION:

Mr. Gilbert, you brought out that

13

this is not just a question of the candidate informing the

14

voter, that behind all of this is a litigant who's going

15

to be in a future case.

16

Suppose, to take an example that Mr. Bopp provided in his

17

brief, the judge -- or the candidate is campaigning "Tough

18

on Drunk Driving."

19

come before this judge, now elected, and I say, I want him

20

to recuse, he said he's tough on drunk driving.

How does it work in Minnesota?

And then I'm a drunk driver, and I

21

MR. GILBERT:

22

QUESTION:

Are you asking in the --

Would there be, under Minnesota law,

23

a grounds to say, "I don't want that judge, because he's

24

announced in the election that he's tough on drunk

25

driving"?

One distinction I would like to make here -- oh,
I'm sorry, Your Honor.

No, I don't think so, Your Honor,

Mr. Bopp,

you have three minutes remaining.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES BOPP, JR.,

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9

MR. BOPP:

Your Honor, I don't think this is a

10

matter of mathematical precision.

11

itself, states two different formulations of the rule.

12

They say, quote, "It is clear that the clause applies to

13

statements about how they would decide, quote, issues, end

14

of quote, on pages 1 and 47.

15

quote, "clear," end of quote, that the announced clause

16

applies to statements about cases.

17

12 and 37.

18

State's own formulation of its scope.

19

The State brief,

And then they say it is,

And that is on pages

The rule is not even clear in terms of the

speeches.

up the board or the office for an oral opinion which is

24

not binding on them about whether or not they can answer a

question on the radio.

It is hardly a remedy for a candidate to call

1

And, finally, it is undisputed that the people

of Minnesota want an impartial judiciary.

Governor Arnie

3

Carlson, at Joint Appendix page 247, said -- who's a

4

State's witness -- that people do not want judges who are

pre-committed.

statements, who would appear to be partial, risk defeat at

It is, therefore, unconstitutional.
