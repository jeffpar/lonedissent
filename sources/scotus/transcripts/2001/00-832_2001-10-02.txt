ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS IN NO. 00-843

9
10

MR. FELDMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

Under the Pole Attachments Act, the FCC is

12

required to regulate pole attachments to ensure the rates,

13

terms, and conditions for those attachments be just and

14

reasonable.

15

The question presented in this case is whether

16

two particular types of attachments are covered by the

17

act.

18

The first is an attachment to provide cable

19

television service and commingled Internet access.

That

20

means that over that particular wire at the particular

21

time is traveling both cable television service and

22

Internet access at different frequencies.

23

The second type of attachment at issue is an

24

attachment used to provide wireless telecommunications

25

services.

The FCC determined and the most natural reading

2

of the act requires that both types of attachments are

covered.

provision, defines a pole attachment as any attachment by

a cable television system or provider of

talking about now is on page 205a.

QUESTION:

Is it in your brief?

12

MR. FELDMAN:

I'm sure it's in our brief also,

13

but it's not -- it's not separately set forth in an

14

appendix there.

QUESTION:

Go ahead.

16

MR. FELDMAN:

But the -- and the section I'm

17

referring to now is section 224(a)(4).

18

pole attachment means any attachment by a cable television

19

system or provider of telecommunications service to a

20

pole, duct, conduit, or right-of-way owned or controlled

21

by a utility.

QUESTION:

MR. FELDMAN:

reasonably construed to mean the -- the network of -- of

QUESTION:

Now, is -- is Internet access part of

a cable television system?
MR. FELDMAN:

The FCC hasn't reached a

20

conclusion on that yet because what the FCC concluded --

21

and I think what the most natural reading of the statute

22

leads to the conclusion as well -- that if an attachment

23

is an attachment that's used to provide cable television

24

system service, the fact -- or it's used by a cable

television system, the fact that it's also used for

something else doesn't exclude that attachment from the

really do not understand about this case is how the

MR. FELDMAN:

I -- I wouldn't quite put it that

way.

I think what the commission did, if you look at

paragraph 33 and 34 of its order in this case, is what

4

they said is --

place to start with is 87a at paragraph 33.

That's of our

What they say is, several commentators suggested

10

that cable operators providing Internet service should be

We disagree.
And then they cite a prior order, the Universal

It doesn't matter.
QUESTION:

The FCC has no jurisdiction.

Well, but the issue is here not

whether the court of appeals was right; it's whether the

commission was wrong.

MR. FELDMAN:

Right, but the rate issue was --

the -- the court of appeals did not -- did not address --

18

and I don't even think was presented to the court of

appeals -- what the proper rate is to apply.

The question is whether the FCC has jurisdiction

over these attachments at all, and these are attachments

QUESTION:

We cannot

I don't think that that's correct.

Doesn't it make sense for us to say

because, depending on whether your jurisdictional basis is

that may -- the result in this case could be dependent on

that.

MR. FELDMAN:

that its basis for jurisdiction is (a)(4), which is the

Then that -- then that

forces -- in other words, you're saying the agency made it

clear that it was neither (d) nor (e).

MR. FELDMAN:

No.

That's not quite right.

You can infer -- you're right.

You

can infer that -MR. FELDMAN:

I don't know -- I'll tell you what

11

the agency said.

What they said was it's not (e) based on

12

this past precedent, which Congress has now asked us to

13

look into and we're now looking into it once again.

may change our mind, but as of now, it's not (e).

QUESTION:

MR. FELDMAN:

We

But it could be (d).
And they said it could be (d)

17

because we're not -- we don't have to decide whether it is

it's covered under the terms of (d).

But if we

1

they're acting under the general just and reasonable

2

power, then we've got to decide another issue.

3

to decide whether, in fact, there's anything left under

4

the general power, and if we decide that and say the

5

answer is no, only then do we get to the question whether

6

this -- whether this is a proper jurisdictional exercise

7

under (d).

We've got

And we should not have to go, it seems to me,
through that sort of byzantine reverse decisional tree

10

when the agency itself could tell us up front what it was

11

acting under.

12

on this part of the case, the wise thing to do would be to

13

vacate, send the thing back, and say, tell us -- you know,

14

come to grips with us and tell us what you believe you're

15

operating under and we'll review that.

They were quite clear that it wasn't

MR. FELDMAN:

Right, but the question of then

21

whether it's (d) or not is -- just has to do with the

22

question of what the right rate is.

23

100 percent clear on was this is an attachment by a cable

1

QUESTION:

Mr. Feldman, are you saying that it's

2

an academic question what the precise rate is when we're

3

dealing with a court of appeals decision that says that's

4

irrelevant because there is no authority at all in the

5

FCC?

6

MR. FELDMAN:

And I'd like to address that.

I

7

think that the point is that is not a -- even almost not a

8

-- probably not a possible reading of the statute, and

9

certainly not the one that the FCC -- once the FCC adopted

10

a contrary one --

11

QUESTION:

So, you're asking us to say that the

12

FCC does have authority.

13

it falls under is for another day.

14

MR. FELDMAN:

15

QUESTION:

Which particular rate category

That's right.

But the basic question is does it

16

have any authority to come up with a just and reasonable

17

rate at all.

18

MR. FELDMAN:

19

QUESTION:

That's correct.

And I would --

But it's also the case that we are

20

being forced to decide an issue which, if the agency were

21

clear and came out and said it's (d), we wouldn't have to

22

decide.

23

MR. FELDMAN:

I -- I don't think that that's

24

right because whether the agency says it's (d) or not, the

25

fact is that (a)(4) covers this.

And let me -- let me

13

1

give this as an illustration.

2

QUESTION:

3

Well, yes, but that's the -- that's

one of the issues.

4

MR. FELDMAN:

I realize that, but that -- that

5

issue, it seems to me, is not a difficult one.

If you

6

look at (d), for example, (d) -- Congress knew quite well,

7

when it was dealing with rates, not when it was dealing

8

with terms, conditions, or mandatory access, which are

9

also at issue in the statute -- when it was dealing with

10

rates, it was quite clear this subsection -- that's (d)(3)

11

-- shall apply to the rate for any pole attachment used by

12

a cable television system solely to provide a cable

13

service.

14

Now, if Congress wanted to limit the -- the

15

coverage -- the general coverage of the act, it could have

16

used exactly that same language, and in (a)(4), it could

17

have said, the term pole attachment means any attachment

18

by a cable television system used solely to provide cable

19

service.

20

For purposes of the rate, it did want that to govern, and

21

it had a reason for doing that, which I can go into.

22

But Congress actually made a distinct choice.

QUESTION:

I can give you -- I can give you

23

another -- another plausible explanation.

24

it's -- it's to my mind the most plausible explanation.

25

think Congress divides the world -- the world -- of what

That's the only reason people

Then when it got to prescribing the rates, what

5

are you going to do with something that overlaps between

6

the two?

7

for telecommunications.

8

solve that question by, in the first rate section, saying

9

if it's cable only, it has this rate, and if it's

You can provide one rate for cable, another rate
What about one that is both?

You

10

telecommunications, which is everything else, including

11

the mingling of telecommunications with cable, it's

12

another rate.

13

explanation of why Congress put cable only in the later

14

section and in the earlier section just talked about cable

15

because it thought anything else that cable does will be

16

telecommunications.

17

That would be a perfectly plausible

MR. FELDMAN:

Well, if Congress thought that --

18

again, the result of -- of if that were true could be that

19

the (e) rate might apply to this thing, but it would still

20

be that the (e) rate applied.

21

-- that these attachments are not protected at all.

22

It would not be that this

And I would add that in 1996, when Congress

23

passed this statute, the FCC had already determined in

24

several cases that a cable attachment that's also used to

25

provide data transmission services was still an attachment

protection of the Pole Attachment Act.

change any of the relevant language that was important for

that decision.

10

It still left it the pole attachment means

I mean, I would add if the -- whatever the FCC

11

is to -- is going to determine about what the Internet

12

access is, whatever they would determine about that, the

attachment would still be an attachment by a cable

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER D. KEISLER

2

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER IN NO. 00-832

4

MR. KEISLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

5

The central feature of the provisions of this

6

act that define its scope, sections 224(a)(4) and (b)(1),

7

is that the threshold question of whether an attachment is

8

covered by the act turns on the nature of the facility not

9

on what service is provided over that facility.

Section

10

(a)(4) defines pole attachment as any attachment by a

11

cable television system.

12

system is a defined term in the act.

13

subsection 7 defines a cable system as the physical

14

equipment that constitutes the cable network.

15

QUESTION:

And, Justice Scalia, cable
Section 522,

It's on --

You say the attachment of a cable

These wires which are attached

5

Now, it's -- it's not the case I think, Justice

6

Scalia, that Congress could have divided the world solely

7

into cable services and telecommunications services

8

because there are lots of services that don't fit either

9

definition.

Telecommunications service is the offering of

10

telecommunications, which is defined in section 153 of the

11

act as the transmission of information of the user's

12

choosing without change in the form or content.

13

Internet access, the commission has found,

14

changes the form of the information.

An Internet service

15

provider engages in something called protocol conversion

17

18

19

service.

So, it is not a telecommunications

The commission correctly found that.

20

And applying telecommunications service

21

regulation to everything that's not a cable service would

22

mean applying a whole host of legacy telecommunications

statutes and rules to a whole sector of the economy that

has always been unregulated, information service

And, Justice Souter, I don't think a remand to

it arbitrary or capricious or contrary to law for the

commission to resolve the case the way it did.

12

commission's legal interpretation of section (a)(4) is

13

correct, that it applies to any attachment by a cable

14

television system, and a cable system includes wires that

15

commingle Internet access and video programming, then it's

not arbitrary or capricious or contrary to law for the

commission to resolve the case the way it did.

19

If the

consequences that determines again whether a whole host of

regulations that go well beyond the Pole Attachment Act

will be applied to this service.

MR. KEISLER:

9

It means --

If that selection of the (d) rate is

MR. KEISLER:

It could only be wrong in two

circumstances.

14

the ground that the commission erred in finding this

15

wasn't a telecommunications service.

16

because it was arbitrary and capricious for them to

17

exercise their authority under subsection (b) to choose

18

this particular rate rather than another rate.

19

nobody has sought review on that question before the court

20

of appeals or before this Court.

It could be wrong if this were a

The sole claim that respondents made in their

And that can't have been Congress' purpose.

3

Congress has always understood that the cable wire into

4

the home is potentially capable of carrying many, many

services other than simply television programs.

6

why they were so careful to define cable system as a

facility designed to provide cable services which include

video programming, not which are exclusively video

programming, but which include video programming.

That's

There

MR. STEINDLER:

2

QUESTION:

Right.

-- whereas for those areas that are

3

within its special expertise, cable and

4

telecommunications, Congress has specified the rates.

5

if it's beyond that in areas that you don't know squat

6

about, you can -- you can pick whatever rate you like.

7

QUESTION:

I'm glad you agree with that.

But

I just

8

wonder what's so odd about Congress giving regulatory

9

authority to set just and reasonable rates to a regulatory

10

agency and then taking out two areas, it happens to be,

11

that the industry is particularly interested in and

12

negotiating a specific formula, while leaving others --

13

I've seen it a thousand times in regulatory statutes --

14

leaving others for the agency to proceed under normal,

15

ordinary, just, and reasonable rate setting authority.

16

MR. STEINDLER:

I think another answer -- and

17

again, I do want to return to the wireless issue because

18

it does tend to get lost in the shuffle here.

Another answer is this.

This is not an ordinary

agency case.

Okay.

If you turn to the definition of utility, which

is in -- at the beginning of the statute, 224(a)(1) on

proposition in the pre-'96 era -- in the pre-'96 statute

-- that if you're a cable company in the telephone

MR. STEINDLER:

Well, Congress has talked sort

of out of both sides of its mouth about the Internet.

13

wants to promote it on the one hand, indeed.

14

wants to be sure that it keeps its hands off the Internet

MR. STEINDLER:

Let me -- the answer is yes, and

it comes in the definition of a cable system.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS IN NO. 00-843
MR. FELDMAN:

I think it might be worthwhile to

18

point out that the -- the FCC's construction of the act is

19

entitled to deference and is at least a reasonable

20

construction of the act.

21

But let -- let me go to the -- the point that

22

Mr. Steindler was just making.

Congress, in 1978 as a

23

premise of this act, decided that the telephone companies

24

and the utilities had a lot of -- and we cite the -- the

25

committee report that makes this point -- had -- had

poles.

4

everybody used everybody else's poles because everybody

5

had to get a complete network to all the houses.

6

Some owned -- the utilities

They had a longstanding agreements by which

Now, under -- so, therefore, that is why

7

Congress did not include the so-called ILEC's, the old-

8

fashioned telephone companies, in this act.

9

had access to poles.

They already

They either owned them or had

10

agreements with longstanding arrangements with -- with the

11

utility -- electric utilities.

12

On the other hand, there were CLEC's, which are

13

new entrants in the telecommunications business.

14

were protected by the (e) rate regardless of whether they

15

do or don't provide Internet access.

16

Those

Similarly, cable companies, the FCC decided,

17

should be protected by the (d) rate similarly so that if

18

they provide Internet access, they're not penalized

19

thereby and kicked off the pole.

rule and under the Eleventh Circuit's decision, if a cable

company provides Internet access, it's off the pole.
