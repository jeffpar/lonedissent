CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

now in Number 00-1831, United States v. Sandra Craft.

Mr. Jones.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. JONES

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. JONES:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

10

The question in this case is whether the Federal

11

tax lien that applies by operation of law to all property

12

and rights to property of a delinquent taxpayer attaches

13

to the interest of that taxpayer in a tenancy by the

14

entirety.

15

for 10 years, failed to file a Federal income tax return

16

and accumulated a Federal tax obligation of approximately

17

half a million dollars.

18

The taxpayer in this case was an attorney who,

At the time the taxes were assessed and the

19

notice of tax lien was filed, the taxpayer owned a real

20

property in a joint tenancy by the entirety with his wife.

21

He then conveyed his interest in that property to his wife

22

for $1, and when his wife then sought to sell the property

23

the tax lien appeared in the title record.

24
25

QUESTION:

Now, tell us about the fraudulent

conveyance proceeding.

Does the fraudulent conveyance

1

holding, or finding, make no difference one way or the

2

other?

3

the property -- you can -- well, if it was a fraudulent

4

conveyance, you can pursue the property, and if it wasn't,

5

the lien is still there anyway under your theory.

6

the way it works?

7

If it was a fraudulent conveyance the husband has

MR. JONES:

Is that

I think that we would say that the

8

lien, the question of the validity of the lien is the

9

first question.

If the lien is valid you don't need to

10

address the fraudulent conveyance question.

11

haven't presented the fraudulent --

Indeed, we

QUESTION:

Right.

13

MR. JONES:

14

If the lien were not valid, it would still be

-- conveyance question in this case.

15

possible to go after property in certain circumstances if

16

there had been a fraudulent conveyance, but on this record

17

we're not challenging the determination that as a matter

18

of State law there was not a fraudulent conveyance, except

19

for this fraudulent enhancement portion that the court

20

awarded.

21

QUESTION:

Mr. Jones, as part of the background,

22

how did it come about that it's only the taxpayer who has

23

the liability?

24

an innocent spouse?

25

Did she file separate returns, or was she

MR. JONES:

In this case, the taxpayer is the

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

husband.

The husband was an attorney, and he filed no

2

return, and when -- there's two ways for this issue to

3

come up.

4

only a separate return.

5

return that they are jointly and severally liable for the

6

tax obligation, so if, as in this case, the taxpayer

7

simply files no return at all, then the obligation is

8

exclusively that -- the tax obligation is that of the

9

nonfiler, in this case the husband.

Either spouse may file either no return, or file
It's only when they file a joint

10

Indeed, Judge Ryan pointed out in his separate

11

opinion that the decision of this Court, of the court of

12

appeals is very amenable to abuse, because on this theory

13

both spouses can earn income, neither of them can file a

14

return, or they can both file a separate return, and then

15

they can put all of their real and personal property in a

16

tenancy by the entirety, including stocks and bonds in

17

States like Michigan and Maryland, and claim a complete

18

exemption of all of their property from Federal tax

19

obligations.

20

Now, in --

21

QUESTION:

22
23

-- some penalties for failing to file

a return?
MR. JONES:

There are some penalties, but the

24

penalties, like taxes, have to be enforced against the

25

property of the taxpayer, and if the taxpayer is allowed

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

to exempt all of its property in this fashion, then

2

there's literally no way that the taxes can be enforced

3

through civil procedures.

4
5

QUESTION:

MR. JONES:

7

QUESTION:

9

Are

there any criminal procedures for --

6

8

What about criminal procedures?

I --- failure, continued failure to

file -MR. JONES:

Of course, if you file a return,

10

then you're not exposing yourself to any criminal

11

obligations, and if you don't file a return, it would

12

be -- I'm not familiar with a statute that makes that a

13

crime by itself.

14

connection with some intent to conceal, but just the fact

15

that you didn't file -- I'm not -- frankly, I'm not --

16

even though I come before the Court on tax cases, I'm not

17

an expert on criminal tax matters, but it's my impression

18

that that would not by itself be a crime.

Now, it may be that it's a crime in

Now, the Federal tax --

QUESTION:

21

We'd better not let the word get out.

I thought that it was a crime, but I'll check.

QUESTION:

MR. JONES:

I'm simply not --

Do we know as a matter of fact what
Did she not file also?

Did she file a

QUESTION:

I don't know whether she was required

Yes, I know.

It involves the half-

I was just curious how

that came about.

12

MR. JONES:

I don't believe the record reflects.

13

Now, the comprehensive text of the Federal tax

14

lien reaches not only all property of the taxpayer but all

15

rights to property of the taxpayer, and this Court has

16

consistently held that this broad text shows a plain

17

intent to reach every type of interest that a taxpayer

18

might have in property, and two terms ago in the Drye case

19

the Court summarized these holdings and said that the

20

Federal tax lien reaches every species of valuable,

21

legally protected right or interest of the taxpayer, and

22

the simple question that we have before us today is

23

whether a taxpayer who has an interest in a tenancy by the

24

entirety has any valuable legally protected interest in

25

the property.

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

Well, of course, isn't the issue

2

whether the taxpayer has a legal interest in the property?

3

Isn't that the issue?

4
5
6

MR. JONES:

That is the underlying issue in this

case.
QUESTION:

And the other side says no, there's

7

this mythical entity called the marriage, or something

8

like that, is the owner.

9

MR. JONES:

Well, it's a real entity.

There is

10

really a marriage.

It's just that the property interests

11

are, in fact, owned by the individual spouses, as I can

12

explain by going through what rights a tenant by the

13

entirety has under the applicable law in this case, which

14

is Michigan law.

A --

15

QUESTION:

16

rights owned by the taxpayer.

17

MR. JONES:

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. JONES:

20
21

But are any of those rights legal

Yes.
That's the basic question.
Yes, and indeed, in fact, the

supreme court in Michigan has so held.
Let me just describe these rights that the

22

taxpayer has.

The individual owner of the -- each spouse

23

in a tenancy by the entirety has the right to occupy and

24

use the premises, has the right, with the consent of the

25

other spouse, to mortgage or sell it, and under section --

QUESTION:

Wait, wait.

Strike that one.

2

mean, that's -- the marriage can sell it.

3

the consent of the other one is just to say --

4

MR. JONES:

QUESTION:

6

I

I mean, with

This is --- tenancy by the entirety.

It's the

marriage that sells it.

7

MR. JONES:

That is exactly the interest that

8

the taxpayer had in the Rodgers case in a homestead

9

estate.

He could not sell his properties separately from

10

that of his spouse.

11

with the right, with the concurrence of the spouse, and

12

what the Court held in Rodgers -QUESTION:

13
14

He could only mortgage or sell it

But he had a legal interest in the

property.

15

MR. JONES:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. JONES:

Yes, he did.
He did.
Yes, and if I might go on, there are

18

more interests involved.

19

stop there, we can't stop there, because the taxpayer in

20

fact has greater interests than the ones we've already

21

described.

22

I mean, even if you wanted to

Under section 557.71 of the Michigan Code, which

23

is quoted at page 41 of the joint appendix and page 3 of

24

our reply brief, each spouse in -- since 1975 each spouse

25

in Michigan has had the right to equal portion of the

Alderson Reporting Company

1

income from the property, that is, the interest, the

2

dividends, the rents, to the profits, and is entitled to

3

half of the proceeds on the sale of the property.

property on divorce, and has a right of survivorship that

gives him the fee simple, absolute --

QUESTION:

Each

Presumably the Government could get a

lien on any of those things if they ever came into being.

9

MR. JONES:

They are in being, and that's what

10

the supreme court of Michigan pointed out in Dow v. State.

11

The court held that these significant interests in

12

property possessed by each spouse are property for

13

purposes of the constitutional Due Process Clause, and

14

that each spouse must separately be given notice of any

15

action affecting their significant property interests.

16

QUESTION:

Given notice by whom?

17

MR. JONES:

18

with respect to the property.

19

Due Process Clause you have to have notice and an

20

opportunity to be heard if there's property affected, and

21

what the court said is that these significant -- I'm

22

quoting.

they have separate rights.

was somebody suing the tenants by the entirety, or --

How did that case come up?

MR. JONES:

My recollection is that it was a

the income and half of the proceeds on the sale is an

ordinary kind of right to money.

QUESTION:

Mr. Jones, you're not asserting

that

6

the Government's lien gives it any greater right than he

has, so the recitation that you had, you're not saying

that the Government lien means that they could preempt her

Would the case be any different if

19

that transaction you just referred to hadn't taken place?

20

Would the Government's case be weaker?

21

MR. JONES:

The Government's case would be

22

significantly different if the sale had not occurred.

23

Then we would presumably be waiting to see what happened,

24

or we would under Rodgers be attempting to bring a

25

foreclosure case.

We haven't attempted to do that here

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

because we didn't need to do it and, in fact, we rarely

2

do, and while I'm on the foreclosure issue, let me point

3

out that Rodgers held that a joint interest can be

4

foreclosed notwithstanding that neither spouse by

5

themselves force the sale of it.

6

What the Court explained was that Congress

7

specifically provided in 7403 of the code that the

8

foreclosure applies to the entire property, and that in

9

that sale the rights of the innocent spouse are protected

10

and, indeed, the court, the district court has discretion

11

not even to order a foreclosure if it so chooses.

12

QUESTION:

But --

13

QUESTION:

Well, let's assume you do foreclose

14

because we find that, indeed, the husband has a property

15

interest in the tenancy by the entirety, so you foreclose.
Now, I guess some of his interest you've just

16
17

pointed out is a right to half of the income from the

18

property, but surely his most significant interest is that

19

he is entitled to half of the whole property if the

20

marriage dissolves, right?
MR. JONES:

21
22

Or of it's sold, and he's entitled

to all of it if he's the survivor.
QUESTION:

23
24

okay.

25

these contingencies?

Right.

These are all contingencies,

How do you -- you foreclose -- how do we value

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. JONES:

2

QUESTION:

3
4

This -What do we -- we have people come in

and say how stable the marriage is, or what?
MR. JONES:

This Court discussed that exact,

5

what the Court called the practical reality in the Rodgers

6

case, and gave a detailed example that I think took three

7

or four pages of the Court's opinion in Rodgers,

8

explaining how you would value the respective interests of

9

the parties.

10

Let me also suggest to the Court that there is a

11

very thorough and thoughtful decision of the district

12

court in New Jersey in United States v. Jones in 1995 that

13

discusses the circumstances when discretion would not be

14

exercised to allow foreclosure of tenancy-by-the-entirety

15

property, and the Court concluded that there were

16

circumstances which that case was one, where instead of

17

foreclosing on the property, the property rights of -- the

18

United States would simply be put in the position of

19

holding the right of survivorship of the delinquent

20

spouse, and in addition, the right of that spouse to half

21

of the rents would be recognized immediately on behalf of

22

the United States.

23

The foreclosure remedy, I've heard cases

24

describe it as a drastic remedy.

Well, I don't know if

25

it's drastic, but it's a remedy that doesn't have to be

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

exercised, and that there are cases that explain

2

circumstances when it's appropriate in the court's view

3

not to do so.

4
5

QUESTION:

But in your view, you always value

the taxpayer's interest at 50 percent?

6

MR. JONES:

No.

I think in the Rodgers -- well,

7

if the property's been sold, yes.

If the property hasn't

8

been sold, and we're talking about in a foreclosure

9

context, I believe the Rodgers court goes through the

10

example of the varying life expectancies of the two

11

tenants, and which one -- and I believe what the Court in

12

Rodgers said was that each of them should be treated as if

13

they have a life estate plus a right of survivorship, and

14

the Court explains how that could well -- I think in the

15

facts of Rodgers resulted in only 10 percent of the

16

proceeds being applied to the husband's interest and 90

17

percent being retained on behalf of the spouse, but -QUESTION:

18
19

But there must be a foreclosure to

that extent?
MR. JONES:

20

There -- that was a -- I believe

21

those were hypothetical facts that the Court discussed in

22

Rodgers.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

Mr. Jones, during the continuance of

the marriage can either spouse force a sale?
MR. JONES:

No, and that was the point made in

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Rodgers also, that in any kind of joint tenancy -- by the

2

way, I should emphasize --

QUESTION:

But I thought joint -- I may be wrong

4

in this.

5

into a common tenancy by the action of one --

6

I thought a joint tenancy could be converted

MR. JONES:

I misspoke.

It's not in every joint

7

tenancy.

8

they can't be forcibly sold by one and, indeed --

9
10

QUESTION:

MR. JONES:

Correct, and that that was the case

in Rodgers --

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. JONES:

15

During the continuance of the joint

tenancy.

11
12

It is a common feature of joint tenancies that

Okay.
-- where the homestead right could

not be -QUESTION:

16

But I take it from your earlier

17

answer that there is, in tenancies by the entirety there

18

is no such legal means of converting that tenancy into a

19

tenancy in common which then can either be the subject of

20

a forced sale or petition, is that correct?
MR. JONES:

21

I believe that's correct, and I

22

believe it was also true in Rodgers of the homestead

23

estate, which is a common -- which is also a common

24

estate.

25

In fact, in this Court's opinion in Jacobs in

16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

1939, where the Court said that we were not -- the Federal

2

tax laws were not bound by the ancient fictions of

3

tenancies by the entirety, the Court pointed out that a

4

joint tenancy and a tenancy by the entirety create the

5

same rights.

6

marital unit, and the Court held in the Jacobs case, as it

7

had held 9 years earlier in the Tyler case, that that

8

feudal fiction or ancient fiction did not bind the tax

9

provisions, that the tax provisions were to be implied in

The only difference is the fiction of the

10

light of the actual rights of the tenants and not based

11

upon the artificial rules of State law, and then in Irvine

12

and in Drye just two terms ago this Court, in interpreting

13

the term, property, and rights to property and Federal tax

14

legislation and in the lien statute said that we look to

15

the realities of the taxpayer's right, and we're not

16

struck blind by legal fictions of artificial --

17
18
19

QUESTION:

But the realities of taxpayer rights

depend on State law, don't they?
MR. JONES:

The realities of the taxpayer's

20

right are drawn from State law, but we're not supposed

21

to -- I mean, in the words of the Court, let the

22

artificial rules of State law blind us to the realities of

23

those rights, and let me give you --

24
25

QUESTION:

Well now, what's the difference, do

you think, between the artificial rules and the realities?

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. JONES:

Well, this Court has said that

2

difference can be seen in tenancies by the entirety, that

3

the realities are that the tenants -- I mean, it is a

4

fiction.

The respondent admits it's a fiction.

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. JONES:

7

Well -The word fiction is what is implied

here.

8
9

Every --

QUESTION:

You say it's a fiction.

What do you

mean by it?

10

MR. JONES:

What is a fiction is the idea that

us down this path, the court made what are now clearly, I

think, two errors under this Court's precedents.

8

first error that the court made was to say that we own --

9

that this question about what's property or a right to

In that case, which started

The

property is solely a question of State law.

11

14

law.

17

The Court made that clear in '56 in Bess, emphasized

Now, the other thing that Hutcherson got wrong

18

right from the beginning was this idea that you -- that

19

the fiction of State law is controlling, and I'm -- what

20

the court said is, the interest of a tenant by the

21

entirety in the property cannot be subject to the Federal

22

lien because, in the words of the court, that interest is

23

like a rainbow in the sky, or like the morning fog rising

24

across the valley.

25

Well, once we get past the metaphorical fog,

fictional rainbow.

rights, the rights to receive money, and in this case the

4

tenant had a right to receive half the proceeds of the

Okay, well, that's --

QUESTION:

-- the community's reliance on

decisions that have been given by the Federal courts.
MR. JONES:

The answer -- I believe the answer

13

to your question is no, that there is no embedded reliance

14

on this principle because, as we pointed out in our brief,

15

even in Michigan there is an express caution given by the

16

State bar to title examiners saying that, in light of the

17

1975 enactment of this statute that gives each spouse an

18

equal right to all of the income and profits from the

19

property, that the State bar advised title examiners that

20

they could not give an opinion that the interest of an

21

individual spouse was not subject to the lien.

22

Moreover, in 1983, I believe it was, this Court

23

had a discussion about the status of tenancy by the

24

entirety under the Federal lien, and the majority opinion

25

in a footnote questioned these older cases, so I do not

23
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

think that a title examiner, especially in Michigan, would

2

be able to say that he had upset settled expectations.

3

QUESTION:

So this case involves only Michigan,

4

and if you have States that do not provide that the --

5

each spouse has an interest in the income, it might be a

6

different answer.

7

MR. JONES:

There is, indeed, a narrow basis

8

that you just described for resolving this case, and it

9

would be an appropriate way to resolve the case because we

10

have the fund -- we have here the voluntary -- the sale,

11

with the proceeds available for distribution, so we don't

12

have to reach the broader question of whether the

13

existence of the right of survivorship, which is an

14

undisputed personal interest, is sufficient for the lien

15

to attach and, a la Rodgers, be subject to a foreclosure

action.

MR. JONES:

The Government's lien attaches to

the interests of the contingent remaindermen, and there

from a Spendthrift Trust is subject to the Federal lien.

valuable, legally protected interests in each spouse, that

by calling it a -- a something else, that the lien

wouldn't apply, and that's exactly what the Court

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

MR. SUTTON:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

9

There are some serious misunderstandings about

10

the meaning of Michigan law which go to the heart of the

11

proper resolution of this case under Federal law.

12

of all, the Government has relied very heavily on a 1975

13

Michigan statute that says, spouses in a tenancy by the

14

entirety have equal rights to rent and income and to

15

profits.

16

quoted.

17

First

That's section 1 of the statute that I just

If you look at page 209 of that statute in the

18

Sixth Circuit appendix, regrettably not in your appendix,

19

you'll see that the second section of that statute says

20

that only applies to tenancies by the entirety created

21

after 1975.

22

statute is utterly irrelevant.

23

designed primarily just to deal with what happens when the

24

tenancy ends, that is, when there's a divorce, just to

25

make sure that both spouses have a right to the property.

This tenancy was created in 1972.

that the rights to proceeds, once you have proceeds as a

spouse, that somehow that means the tenancy is over and

the creditors, Federal, State, city, private, can get at

Mr. Sutton, how does it differ from

the thing, like a Spendthrift Trust, or like what was

involved in Drye?

11

that State could touch that inheritance, the Federal

12

taxing authorities could, so there are many situations

13

where the property is exempt from reach, even where the

14

State doesn't call it property, calls it something else,

15

but the elements of what the person had leads the Federal

16

authorities to say this is the property of so-and-so, as

to disregard them if it wishes and, notably in the estate

have an opportunity to correct.

I think it would be very difficult, because of

the fact that under Michigan law the property ownership

you're right, they still have joint interests.

just as they are in Michigan, which is to say, it's an

have to follow.

16

Then there was a big discussion about law of the case and

were relying on law of the case, law -MR. SUTTON:

Alderson Reporting Company

a tax avoidance concern lurking here, why is it in 1990,

when Congress passed the Fair Debt Collection Act --

that's the Federal fraudulent conveyance statute -- why

did it specifically exempt tenancy by the entirety

property?

happened in this case and the Federal Government would

have nothing to say about it.

Under that law today you could do exactly what

I suppose, if you follow the -- your

rationale to its furthest extent in a State such as the

10

one Justice Ginsburg referred to in which business assets

11

can be held in tenancy by the entirety, a husband and wife

12

could hold a -- have a closely held corporation by the

entirety and, on your theory, they wouldn't even be liable

for income tax because it would be the entirety alone that

would be liable.

MR. SUTTON:

Under section 61, which is the

provision of the Internal Revenue Code that taxes

property, income from tenancy by the entirety property is

still taxed.

position to cite any cases for this point, the point that

I'm going to make, so you're going to want to check me on

it, but I don't think there's any doubt that when it comes

to income from tenancies-by-the-entirety property, the

they're still -- you're still taxable.

14

serious doubt about it is, at least so far as the States

15

that Justice Ginsburg's example referred to, there also is

an inconsistency between the fact that we have no doubt,

Well,it's a

-- they're very

different concepts and maybe it's important, particularly

21

in light of Justice Breyer's comment about this just

22

seeming to be a fiction, there's a real function behind

23

this concept, and the function is that, while the tenancy

24

is premised on this nice notion of two hearts beating as

one, the fact is that doesn't always happen, and the whole

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

that it precludes one spouse unilaterally from destroying

Keep in mind, that's exactly what happened in

is the factor that creditors under State law can't get a

land, you just hold it from the king, and you have feudal

obligations unless you pass along the seasons.

that's -- if we're going on the theory of the thing --

7

MR. SUTTON:

Doesn't the

For all I know,

I mean,

I really hope I can clarify this

8

because I do think it cuts the heart of this case.

Most

9

States that don't have tenancies by the entirety do have

10

joint tenancy, so that really is the key comparison, and

11

as to those States, when you have a joint tenancy, first

12

of all they are divisible interests.
If they're divisible interests, that means one

13
14

spouse unilaterally can incumber and in some instances

15

sell that right, whether it's a future right, the right of

16

survivorship, or a present right with respect to some

17

interest in the property, so that's the whole point.

18

whole point is, in those States people have decided to

19

marry, buy property together, but yet from the beginning

20

one spouse unilaterally could destroy or incumber the

21

property.

MR. SUTTON:

I would submit, Your Honor, that

when it comes to the tax lien statute the Court has said

several times that Congress did not define the words,

property, rights to property belonging to.

We look first

But is it a question of Federal law,

8

and as a policy matter we generally look to State law?

But isn't that itself a question of Federal law, the

10

extent to which we're going to look to State law?
MR. SUTTON:

11

Well, Your Honor, I had thought

12

that you take the State law's property interests as you

13

find them in the 50 or 51 jurisdictions, depending on how

14

you want to look at it, and then, depending how the

15

States --

16

QUESTION:

But for tax purposes, I'm just

17

wondering if at bottom it isn't, in fact, a question of

18

Federal law.

19

MR. SUTTON:

It is a question of Federal law

20

what the, quote, consequences of those State law

21

definitions are, but let me give you, I think, a good

22

indication of this, and it relates to a hard issue raised

23

by Justice Ginsburg.

24

where it was a joint bank account, which is clearly a much

25

harder case, not presented here.

What about tenancy by the entirety

about the marital home.

But in National Bank of Rodgers, which was about

3

a joint tenancy, the Court said in a 5-4 decision that you

4

could levy on one person's joint bank account.

5

that?

6

right to all of the money in the account unilaterally,

whenever he wanted it, and if he misused it, that was

8

simply to be a fight among the other joint tenants.

Why was

Because under State law, the taxpayer, or he had a

Justice Blackmun in writing that decision made

10

it crystal clear that that case turned on the fact that

11

under State law the taxpayer had a unilateral right to

take all the proceeds.

13

differently, that the only way you can take out the

14

proceeds is with the consent of the spouse, there's --

Your point is, I take it, that in this case State law

MR. SUTTON:

QUESTION:

15

MR. SUTTON:

Yes.
All right.
To use the sticks in the bundle

16

analogy, every interest under State law in Michigan

regarding this tenancy, each stick has to be exercised two

18

by two, not one by one, but every one of them is two by

19

two, husband and wife, and certainly not three by three,

20

which is what the Federal Government is saying here.

23

QUESTION:

But it is for the Federal Government

to determine to what property the lien extends.
MR. SUTTON:

I couldn't agree more, Your Honor.

24

I mean, not -- I wouldn't say the executive branch.

I

25

mean, in the 1971 Benson decision they admitted that the

Alderson Reporting Company

1

lien does not cover tenancy by the entirety.

2

at that 1971 decision, they admitted in that case it

3

doesn't cover it, so this is not an administrative

4

deference situation at all, but the Federal Government,

5

through Congress and the President, does have a right to

6

extend it.

7

if we could go back to thinking about --

8

If you look

I will admit, it's not going to be easy, and

QUESTION:

Their point to the contrary is

9

basically, you're right, or assuming you're right, it's

10

still definite enough to get at, and you really violate

11

State law policy there only if you sell the property, you

12

see, but as long as -- and, indeed, if they sell it on

13

their own, that's their problem.

14

becomes a question of how the judge will enforce the lien,

go in and say, don't force me to sell the property, et

MR. SUTTON:

question.

I think what I hear you saying is that boy,

this is just a lien, they're just placeholders, it doesn't

They can't do

Prior to the lien, she had a right to make a

12
13

decision not with the Federal Government about how to use

14

this property, but with her husband, and a classic tenet

15

of lien law is you get no more lien rights than the debtor

16

had, and you've got a situation here where they're 1)

17

trying to act as a spouse, but 2) dictating how this

property ought to be used, when that was a decision that

19

under Michigan law only the two spouses could make

together.

I want to go back to a point that I went over a
little bit too quickly.
QUESTION:

The consequence --

I'd just like to ask you one question

24

about Michigan law in origin, because you said this goes

25

back to 1866, so it was probably before the Married

Women's Property Act, so -- at least in some States it

2

was, so whatever rights there were to control and make

3

decisions, they were all in the husband at that time.

4

MR. SUTTON:

Most of the Married Women's

5

Property Acts, almost all of them were passed before 1866,

6

so first of all that defect, I would call it, in the old

7

tenancy simply was no longer true, and even in some States

8

where that continued, it was still this, I guess it's jure

9

uxoris concept, that it wasn't the husband as an

10

individual having an opportunity to do this, it was the

11

husband acting on behalf of the wife, but that just isn't

12

true under Michigan law.

13

interests in the property, as proved by the fact of what

14

happens on a divorce.

They still have these equal

15

The point I glossed over and I wanted to make

16

sure was understood, the issue here is not just whether

17

the lien attaches to the tenancy, I would submit that

18

under Michigan law, if a lien does attach, it destroys the

19

tenancy, so we have a situation where a unilateral act of

20

one spouse has destroyed the tenancy by operation of law

21

under Michigan.

22

It becomes a tenancy in common that destroys the

23

right of survivorship, and that also means because there

24

are now divisible interests in the property that one

25

spouse, unilaterally again, can incumber the property and

contention.
