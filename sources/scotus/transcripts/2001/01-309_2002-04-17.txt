CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

now in Number 01-309, Larry Hope v. Mark Pelzer.

Mr.

Jones.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CRAIG T. JONES

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. JONES:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

10

Under United States v. Lanier, the law was

11

clearly established for purposes of qualified immunity

12

when it gives officials fair warning that their conduct is

13

unlawful.

14

laid out by prior law applies with obvious clarity to the

15

conduct in question, even if the rule arises from a case

16

involving different facts.

17

The fair warning standard is met when a rule

The materially similar facts requirement of the

18

Eleventh Circuit is an unwarranted gloss upon the fair

19

warning standard, just like the fundamentally similar

20

facts requirement which this Court unanimously rejected in

21

Lanier.

22

emphasizes similarity of fact over clarity of ruling.

23

It is an impermissible gloss because it

QUESTION:

And what should be the rule that you

24

say was violated here?

If we write out the opinion, we'd

25

say the rule that the officer should have known is, and we
3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

have to fill in the blank.

2

MR. JONES:

What is that rule?

The rule established by the Eleventh

3

Circuit's own precedent is that it is unconstitutional to

4

punish an inmate through the use of restraint, and

5

restraint is punitive if it goes beyond the point in time

6

which is necessary to quell a disturbance or immediate

7

threat.

8
9
10

QUESTION:

Does the include solitary

confinement?
MR. JONES:

No, Your Honor.

Restraint involves

11

total physical immobility coupled with the pain and

12

discomfort attendant to that.

13

QUESTION:

14

proposition?

15

MR. JONES:

16

QUESTION:

17
18
19
20
21
22

And what case establishes that

Well, there is a -Any physical restraint is unlawful.

What case establishes that?
MR. JONES:

Physical restraint, the precedents

speak of physical restraint to a fixed object.
QUESTION:

Yes, and what precedent in

particular?
MR. JONES:

Gates v. Collier is the first case

23

of a body of law which has developed in our circuit,

24

Justice Scalia.

25

decision which was binding upon the present Eleventh

Gates v. Collier was a 1974 Fifth Circuit

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Circuit and it held that a variety of forms of corporal

2

punishment --

3

QUESTION:

That's my problem.

It was a whole

4

variety.

5

I recall that case, there are a number of instances of

6

brutality against prisoners, and the holding of that case

7

was that that was cruel and unusual punishment, but I

8

don't recall that case saying that any single one of the

9

many instances that the case recited, one of which was

10
11

They didn't say that any single one.

I mean, as

physical restraint, would qualify.
MR. JONES:

Your Honor, the Fifth Circuit

12

decision in Gates affirmed a district court decision which

13

specifically enjoined each and every one of those

14

punishments, and the fact that --

15

QUESTION:

And you think that amounts to a

16

holding that any single one of them would have violated

17

the Eighth Amendment?

18
19
20

MR. JONES:

Yes, Your Honor, if used punitively,

that is correct, and -QUESTION:

But the court ordered stopping each

21

and every one of those measures.

22

of the injunctive degree, not just a combination of them,

23

but each one?

24
25

MR. JONES:

Wasn't that the nature

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

This was not

a case where the court viewed the totality of the
5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

circumstances and said that the conditions constituted

2

cruel and usual punishment and ordered the State of

3

Mississippi to build a new prison.

4

the State was specifically enjoined --

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. JONES:

7

QUESTION:

This was a case where

Did the reasoning follow that line?
Well -Was the reasoning of the opinion, did

8

it examine each one individually and say each one

9

individually was cruel and unusual?

10

MR. JONES:

It examined a variety of practices,

11

and those practices were discussed in a subsection called

12

corporal punishment.

13

multiple holdings does not make it any less important in

14

clearly establishing the law, otherwise a case could only

15

clearly establish the law if it had a single holding.

16

fact that Gates v. Collier drew multiple bright lines as

17

opposed to a single bright line did not make --

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. JONES:

20

QUESTION:

The fact that Gates involved

The

Do we need -Yes.
In this case, do we need to get into

21

the issue, Mr. Jones of what this Court's holdings amount

22

to on this subject, or are we just limiting ourselves to

23

the Eleventh Circuit, perhaps the old Fifth Circuit?

24
25

MR. JONES:

With respect to the underlying

constitutional violation, or with respect to qualified
6
Alderson Reporting Company

1

immunity analysis?

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. JONES:

With respect to each.
Well, Your Honor, this Court has

4

never squarely addressed the constitutionality of

5

continued restraint as a form of corporal punishment.

6

has acknowledged in decisions that restraints can be

7

harmful.

8
9

QUESTION:

It

I suppose one would have to do that,

yes.

10

MR. JONES:

11

QUESTION:

Yes, that's correct.
Are you relying on anything beyond

12

the restraint itself?

13

recited, the facts include leaving the individual in the

14

sun without a shirt on, and not giving him bathroom

15

breaks, and pouring water out in front of him to taunt

16

him.

17

I mean, in the facts that have been

Are you relying upon those features?
MR. JONES:

Not as -- not for the proposition

18

that the law was clearly established, with regard to those

19

facts.

20

the damages suffered by the

21

Those facts are certainly relevant on the issue of

QUESTION:

--

Well, do we have to assume that the

22

facts as alleged are true for purposes of deciding whether

23

summary judgment is appropriate?

24
25

MR. JONES:

Based -- Justice O'Connor, based

upon the grant of certiorari by the Court, the issues
7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

raised in the petition, and the grant, I think that is

2

correct.

3

QUESTION:

I would assume we -- I gather we just

4

assume those are correct for purposes of evaluating the

5

summary judgment question.

6

MR. JONES:

7

QUESTION:

8

And the Eleventh Circuit decided

there was a constitutional violation?

9

MR. JONES:

10
11

I think that is correct.

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
And there was no cross-appeal on

that.

12

MR. JONES:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. JONES:

That is correct, Your Honor.
So do we take that as a given, too?
I think that this case is like

15

Saucier, where the Court acknowledged that the first step

16

be the inquiry of whether there was a constitutional

17

violation made out by the facts.

18

circuit court.

19

QUESTION:

That was resolved by the

Well, that gets back to the Chief

20

Justice's question, and I'm wondering again if the Court

21

writes the opinion giving you the judgment that you seek,

22

isn't it necessary for us to say, a) this law was clearly

23

established, and b) it is a correct interpretation, a

24

correct exposition of the Cruel and Unusual Punishment

25

Clause, so we are -- it would be a rather odd holding for
8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

us to say, well, this was established in the Eleventh

2

Circuit, but we're not telling you whether or not that was

3

right.

4

MR. JONES:

Well, I think, Justice Kennedy,

5

because the certiorari was only granted on the second part

6

of the Saucier test, that is, on the clearly established

7

inquiry, the Court could limit its ruling to the issue of

8

whether the law was clearly established and whether,

9

specifically whether the Eleventh Circuit applied the

10
11

proper standards in determining whether -QUESTION:

Well, maybe Justice Kennedy is

12

suggesting that it's fairly included within the question

13

granted, that it's quite impossible for a judge to say

14

that it does or does not violate a clearly established

15

constitutional principle if he doesn't think that it

16

violates a constitutional principle at all, clearly

17

established or otherwise.

18

one sort of wrapped up in the other?

19

MR. JONES:

20

is fairly included.

21

QUESTION:

I mean, isn't -- doesn't -- the

Yes, Your Honor, and I think that it
My point is that -I take it your position, though, is

22

that all we have to decide is whether the substantially

23

similar standard is the proper standard, and if we say no,

24

it's not, that's like Lanier, which was -- what was it? --

25

substantially identical, I guess, wasn't it, something
9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

like that?

2
3

MR. JONES:

The verdict was fundamentally

similar --

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. JONES:

6

QUESTION:

Fundamentally, yes.
--in Lanier.
And if we say that that gloss, the

7

substantially similar gloss was wrong, what you want us to

8

do is simply vacate and send the thing back, or do you

9

want us to go further and say, no, in fact, there -- we

10

determined that there can be no sovereign -- that there

11

can be no qualified immunity here, because if we have to

12

go the second step, then we have to get into the issue, it

13

seems to me, that Justice Kennedy has raised.

14

MR. JONES:

Your Honor, I believe that the

15

first -- the issue of whether there's a constitutional

16

violation is fairly included within the questions which

17

were granted by the Court.

18

QUESTION:

All right.

Now, if that's what we're

19

going to get into, so we will determine what the violation

20

was and then get to immunity with respect to that

21

particular violation, we won't confine ourselves simply to

22

the substantially similar verbiage, then I go back to my

23

earlier question, and I take it -- and I think you've

24

answered it, but I want to make sure I understand you --

25

for purposes of determining whether there's a
10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

constitutional violation, you are not arguing, I take it,

2

that we should take into consideration the particular

3

circumstances of the day, the heat, the shirt, the

4

bathroom breaks, the water, is that correct?

5

at is the restraint itself?

6

MR. JONES:

All we look

Yes, Your Honor, because the conduct

7

of these defendants was to restrain this man as a form of

8

punishment.

9

QUESTION:

And some of the allegations of the

10

facts have been questioned, and one point was about the

11

lack of bathroom breaks.

12

pleadings -- the pleadings didn't allege lack of bathroom

13

breaks, and how does that get into the cases if the other

14

circuits didn't mention that either?

15

MR. JONES:

There's nothing in the

Well, I think it got into the case

16

because the respondents wanted to argue the case rather

17

than the law.

18

QUESTION:

But that had not been found below,

19

and it hadn't been even asserted in the complaint, is that

20

correct?

21

MR. JONES:

Yes, that is correct, except to the

22

extent that the affidavit of the plaintiff was referenced,

23

I think incorporated by reference into the pleadings.

24
25

QUESTION:

And the plaintiffs affidavit said

that specifically, that he wasn't allowed bathroom breaks?
11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. JONES:

The plaintiff's affidavit is that he

2

was left on the hitching post for 7 hours, and the fair

3

inference that can be drawn from that is that he was

4

restrained for 7 hours without breaks, and there's

5

certainly no evidence rebutting that with respect to the

6

second incident, which he was on the hitching post.

7

The first incident he was on the hitching post,

8

there is evidence that he was given one bathroom break,

9

and he was taken down that incident only after 2 hours,

10
11

which in itself is -QUESTION:

That, we got into that.

That is, I

12

think, disputed even as to the first instance because I

13

think that the State said he had been offered other breaks

14

but he had declined them.

15

another argument that was made about the background, if

16

we're going to get anything beyond the hitching, that the

17

particular officers' names were not involved in some of

18

the worst aspects of that.

19

Well, that's one thing, and

That is, the officers that are named defendants

20

here didn't tell Hope to take off his shirt, and didn't

21

pour water in front of him and have the dogs drink it.

22

Those were other people who are not named defendants, and

23

you don't contest that, do you?

24
25

MR. JONES:

I do not contest that reading of the

record, Justice Ginsburg.

QUESTION:

They didn't keep him on there for

7 hours, as far as we know.

3

charge of how long he would stay there?

4

MR. JONES:

Do we know that they were in

We do not know that, Your Honor,

5

although we do know that it was their expectation that he

6

be restrained indefinitely.

7

indicate that -- including the published case of Austin v.

8

Hopper, indicate that inmates were routinely left on the

9

hitching post for the remainder of the day.

10

QUESTION:

Findings in other cases

You say indefinitely.

According to

11

the prison policy, they were kept on until they agreed to

12

go back to the work crew without disrupting it, so that he

13

could have been released at any time that he said I'm

14

ready to go back on the work crew and do the work, right?

15

MR. JONES:

16

QUESTION:

17

Justice -That's what the prison policy says,

anyway.

18

MR. JONES:

QUESTION:

Well -Now, is the contention in this case

20

that he was prepared to -- you see, I don't understand

21

what they could have done.

22

policy of having work crews.

23

that's cruel and unusual punishment, right?

24

MR. JONES:

25

QUESTION:

Here is a prison that has a
You don't contend that

That is correct.
And the allegation is that this

Alderson Reporting Company

1

prisoner refused to work in one case, and disrupted a work

2

crew in another case, and according to the prison

3

policy -- I mean, you have to do something when he does

4

that.

5

to go back to prison, he says yes, that's exactly what I

6

want.

7

To take him back and say, oh, you know, you've got

What was the prison supposed to do?
MR. JONES:

Well, Justice Scalia, in both

8

instances he was being punished for fighting.

9

QUESTION:

11

MR. JONES:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. JONES:

He was

Disrupting the work crew.
For an altercation.
Okay.
An altercation which subsided at the

14

work site, which was miles away from the prison property,

15

and after he -- in each instant after he was restrained

16

and subdued, and whatever disruption he was a part of had

17

abated, he was put into a van for 20 minutes without

18

incident, another 20 minutes were spent transporting him

19

to the facility without incident, he was then walked

20

without incident, without the necessity for the use of

21

force, to the post.

22

QUESTION:

And the work rules were not brought

23

up by the State.

The Eleventh Circuit said specifically,

24

we are not going to consider these work rules because they

25

were never put in the district court record as a reason
14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

for the officer's behavior in question.

2

MR. JONES:

That is correct, Justice Ginsburg,

3

and if they were in the record, the evidence would also be

4

they were not followed, which was also consistent with the

5

finding of the Middle District of Alabama in the case of

6

Austin v. Hopper.

QUESTION:

8

as the fact?

9

of Larry Hope?

Do we take the fact in the second affidavit

10

MR. JONES:

11

QUESTION:

12

Quickly, what are we supposed to take

Yes.
Okay.

There's nothing about bathroom

breaks in that.

13

MR. JONES:

That is correct, but the critical

14

time element here is the time it took them between the

15

time that the disruption had abated and the time that they

16

decided to punish him for past conduct which had occurred

17

an hour earlier and 10 miles away.

18

time element, not the amount of time --

19

QUESTION:

You say it's critical.

20

critical?

21

instantaneously or never?

22

That is the critical

Why is that

circumstances.

You say no kind of restraint is

they need to restrain him to maintain order and discipline

at the scene of exigent circumstances, that's perfectly

proper.

Or to make him go back to work.

You

8

say that that issue is not in this case.

You say that

9

there's not in this case the fact, contended by the State,

10

that the only reason he was restrained was to get him to

So we should leave open -- even if we

ORAL ARGUMENT OF AUSTIN C. SCHLICK

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

8

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. SCHLICK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

An official is immune from personal liability

12

for violating Federal rights unless the violation would

13

have been clear to a reasonable officer.

14

the governing legal standard does not itself establish a

15

violation, the practical inquiry would be whether the

16

violation was established by case law is not

17

distinguishable in a fair way.

18
19
20

QUESTION:

Where, as here,

What, in your view, is the governing

legal standard that you just referred to?
MR. SCHLICK:

The overarching standard would be

21

the Harlow v. Fitzgerald, where the law was clearly

22

established.

23
24
25

The --

QUESTION:

Well, I thought -- you're not

talking, then, about a substantive standard?
MR. SCHLICK:

In that, in the particular context

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

where one looks to case law, this Court's decision in

2

Saucier v. Katz uses the formulation whether the facts

3

were distinguishable in a fair way, and that would be an

4

appropriate gloss as well.

QUESTION:

Now --

I mean, we start with a prohibition

6

for substantive law, the prohibition against cruel and

7

unusual punishment.

from there, or up from there, whatever you want to call

it?

10

Then how do we work ourselves down

MR. SCHLICK:

Yes, Your Honor.

We would urge

11

the Court in this case to take the case on the terms on

12

which it was briefed and decided in the Eleventh Circuit,

13

that is whether the law they applied in the Eleventh

14

Circuit in 1995 clearly established the violation.

15

that context --

16

QUESTION:

In

Then we don't get into the question

17

of our own view whether -- what the law might, or the

18

result might be in this case?

19

MR. SCHLICK:

Even under that approach, the

20

first step would be to ask whether this Court's decisions

21

themselves gave clear notice, and the answer to that in

22

our view would be no.

23

Collier decision that these officers had fair warning, had

24

clear notice.

25

QUESTION:

It's only because of the Gates v.

So then the result could be one thing

1

in the Eleventh Circuit and another thing in the Fourth

2

Circuit?

3

MR. SCHLICK:

Yes, the -- it could be.

This

4

Court hasn't definitively decided whether, when it takes a

5

qualified immunity case, it should analyze the case in

6

light of its own law solely, or whether it should give

7

greater weight to the relevant circuits.

8

think it would give most guidance to the lower courts to

9

analyze the case as the Eleventh Circuit did.

10

QUESTION:

In this case, we

But what is the standard that the

11

officers should have been aware of, first in the Eleventh

12

Circuit, and then, assuming that we think we -- that this

13

case presents either the necessity or the proper

14

opportunity for us to say what the national standard ought

15

to be, what is the standard at a more specific level of

16

abstraction than Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause that

17

we should be dealing with?

18

MR. SCHLICK:

Justice Kennedy, let me address

19

the Eleventh Circuit first.

In the Eleventh Circuit, the

20

reasonable officer would have looked to the Gates v.

21

Collier decision, noted that it held that it violates the

22

Eighth Amendment to punish an inmate by handcuffing the

23

inmate to a fence for a prolonged period of time, or cell

24

bars for a prolonged period of time, or forcing him to

25

maintain an awkward position for a prolonged period of
19
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

time.

2

The reasonable officer -QUESTION:

Even if -- do you maintain that the

3

issue of whether it was done only to get him to return to

4

the work crew is not in the case?

5

MR. SCHLICK:

6

QUESTION:

Yes.

We have to assume that he was just

7

put on there to punish him, and he couldn't have been

8

released if he had said I'm ready to go back to the work

9

crew?

10

MR. SCHLICK:

Yes, Justice Scalia.

The Eleventh

11

Circuit we think correctly explained that's not a fair

12

inference from the record as we must take it.

13

In the Eleventh Circuit, the reasonable officer

14

would -- could not have concluded that there is a

15

constitutional difference between handcuffing an inmate to

16

a fence or a cell bar and handcuffing an inmate to a metal

17

pole.

Accordingly --

QUESTION:

For purposes of punishment?

MR. SCHLICK:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. SCHLICK:

22

QUESTION:

For purposes of punishment.

You have to add that.
Yes, Your Honor.

And you're content to have us hold

23

these officers liable when a few years down the line we

24

may find that the Eleventh Circuit's opinion was wrong?

25

MR. SCHLICK:

Your Honor, we don't suggest a
20

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

view one way or the other on liability.

2

suggesting that to grant qualified immunity at this stage

3

of the case was improper.

4

second question --

5

QUESTION:

We're simply

That brings me, though, to the

Well, I understand, but I mean, they

6

would be stripped of their qualified immunity even though

7

the Eleventh Circuit's opinion was wrong, and we find it

8

to have been wrong when we finally confront that issue.

9

MR. SCHLICK:

I think that suggests Justice

10

Kennedy's second question, which was, absent Gates, how

11

would the case be viewed, and in that situation --

12
13

QUESTION:

And don't you think we have to reach

that?

14

MR. SCHLICK:

No.

No, we don't think so, Your

15

Honor, because it wasn't included in the petition or in

16

the questions on which this Court granted certiorari, and

17

really it hasn't been squarely faced by the parties,

18

because the State is defending the Regulation 429 rather

19

than the facts that must be taken as true in this case.

20

QUESTION:

Well, it's not defending Regulation

21

429, according to you.

22

he is released as soon as he agrees to go back to the work

23

crew without disruption.

24
25

MR. SCHLICK:

Regulation 429 as it reads says,

That's right.

My point, Justice

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

QUESTION:

So regulation 429 is not in the case,

according to you.

3

MR. SCHLICK:

-- is that the respondents have

4

briefed the case as if they were acting in compliance with

5

Regulation 429, which is not in our view how the case must

6

be taken.

7

Now -QUESTION:

At least the case in the Eleventh

8

Circuit, because it wasn't in the case.

9

case before the district court.

It wasn't in the

It was -- in the district

10

court it was just restraint as punishment.

11

this being a temporal measure to get him to go back to

12

work doesn't show up till the Eleventh Circuit, and the

13

Eleventh Circuit rejects it because it wasn't raised in

14

the district court.

15

MR. SCHLICK:

16

QUESTION:

17

The idea of

That's correct, Justice Ginsburg.

So the regulation is not before us,

you're saying.

18

MR. SCHLICK:

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. SCHLICK:

That's correct.

Okay.
To answer Justice Kennedy's second

21

question, how would this Court address the issue if Gates

22

v. Collier did not exist, in that case, a reasonable

23

officer -- the question would be, what would a reasonable

24

officer -- what would have been clear to a reasonable

25

officer.

The reasonable officer could have made a
22
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

colorable argument that the appropriate analysis is the

2

deliberate indifference standard established by this

3

Court's decision in Farmer v. Brennan, that standard being

4

whether the officer was deliberately indifferent to a

5

substantial risk of serious harm.

6

The reasonable officer could further have

7

concluded that neither the May incident in this case nor

8

the June incident in this case presented a substantial

9

risk of serious harm.

10

QUESTION:

So you think deliberately indifferent

11

is a sufficient standard for the imposition of liability

12

without more specificity.

13

their specific acts can be challenged under the general

14

standard of deliberately indifferent.

15

MR. SCHLICK:

All officers must be aware that

Yes, we think it would be

16

sufficient to establish a substantive violation of the

17

Eighth Amendment, although as the facts must be taken

18

here, qualified immunity would attach, because there's a

19

colorable argument that the threshold was not crossed, but

20

I'd want to say that this Court has not resolved whether

21

it's this deliberate indifference standard or rather the

22

Hudson v. McMillian test, the excessive force test of

23

whether force was used maliciously and sadistically to

24

inflict harm, and that is an unresolved question, is,

25

it's -- that is that very absence of certainty that would
23
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

be most relevant absent the Gates v. Collier decision.

2

this --

3

QUESTION:

In

Suppose I think that I have to reach

4

the question of whether it would violate the Constitution,

5

not just whether the Eleventh Circuit said it would.

6

you think it would violate the Constitution to make the

7

inmate stand in a corner, to immobilize him to that

8

extent?

10

MR. SCHLICK:

You would need to know more,

not --

11

QUESTION:

MR. SCHLICK:

13

Do

To go stand in the corner.
Not in all instances, no, Your

Honor.

14

QUESTION:

So what makes the difference is, you

15

say stand in the corner, and I'm going to handcuff you,

16

and that's the difference between cruel and unusual, and

17

not cruel and unusual?

18

MR. SCHLICK:

The relevant considerations,

19

Justice Scalia, would be the degree of pain and the threat

20

to the safety of the inmates.

21

QUESTION:

It's not necessarily the degree of

22

pain.

23

not much more than standing in a corner.

24
25

Being handcuffed to some immobile object, any --

MR. SCHLICK:

The overarching question of

whether the pain was wanton and unnecessary would focus on
24
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the degree of pain, the penalogical justification, and the

2

threat to the inmate's safety, so you would need to know

3

the facts that bear on those inquiries.

4

In this case, as I've said, the Eleventh Circuit

5

decision of Gates v. Collier was directly on point.

6

provided sufficient certainty for the officers here, and

7

it was correct in that as applied to these facts, under

8

this Court's decisions, there was an Eighth Amendment

9

violation.

10

QUESTION:

It

I didn't understand your last

11

statement.

You say, it would depend on the facts, the

12

degree of pain, the circumstances. I thought your argument

13

for the proposition that any physical restraint as a form

14

of punishment is bad.

15

MR. SCHLICK:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. SCHLICK:

18

21

That --

You're not.
It's the petitioner's position,

but not a position of the United States.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NATHAN A. FORRESTER

2

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

3
4

MR. FORRESTER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

5

In the last 15 years, at least eight Federal

6

master judges and eight Federal district judges in Alabama

7

have read the law to hold that handcuffing a prisoner to a

8

restraining bar or to a similar stationary object does not

9

violate the Eighth Amendment.

10

QUESTION:

Have they discussed Gates?

I didn't

11

go to look at the district court opinions, though you

12

cited them, but did those opinions discuss Gates?

13
14

MR. FORRESTER:
pointedly cite Gates.

15
16

No, Justice Souter, they didn't

QUESTION:
Circuit precedent?

17

Did they just ignore the pre-Eleventh
I mean, how did they get by without --

MR. FORRESTER:

Primarily they refer to the

18

subsequent authority in Williams v. Burton and Ort v.

19

White, and I don't think that we can presume that they

20

stargazed and ignored it, or that they just thought that

21

case really had been largely superseded by this subsequent

22

clarifying authority.

23

QUESTION:

What was the subsequent clarifying

24

authority?

Gates was a specific injunction.

25

It said, we
What came

26
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

after from the Eleventh Circuit that modified that

2

injunction?

3

MR. FORRESTER:

Well, the proposition for which

4

petitioner's amici wish this Court to read Gates and say

5

that our respondents should have read Gates is this very

6

broad proposition that any form of restraint as a form of

7

punishment is unconstitutional, although that proposition

8

has clearly been narrowed not just by the Eleventh

9

Circuit's rulings and rulings in Williams v. Burton and

10

Ort, which indicated that certainly in an excessive force

11

context you could restrain a prisoner for a period of

12

time, but also by this Court's rulings in Wilson v. Seiter

13

and Whitley v. Albers, and the clarifying ruling in Farmer

14

v. Brennan, where this Court indicated that the fact that

15

a restraint was possibly objectively problematic is not

16

enough to create an Eighth Amendment right.

17

be --

18

QUESTION:

There had to

If we are assuming the fact as

19

alleged, as it was used here, not to quell a riot, not to

20

keep things calm in an interim, but as a means of

21

punishment -- because that's what I understood the

22

injunction in Gates was, not, you couldn't use restraints

23

in a temporary situation, but that you could not use it

24

strictly for punishment purposes --

the Court's entitled to take judicial notice of it,

over his head, standing up, and given no water, except

2

All right, that's his allegation.

5

Now, introduce any regulation you want, why
doesn't that create an issue for trial?

the most important fact there is that he could have gotten

off the bar --

QUESTION:

I don't see anything, all right, that

he said that was so, and I don't see anything where
anybody in the record said that was so.

MR. FORRESTER:

12

QUESTION:

The regulation --

So what is the regulation?

Did you

13

move, did you say -- did you say -- I don't see in these

14

papers in front of me, say that the reason we're entitled

15

to summary judgment is, it was ordinary practice to let

16

the person go off, and then you'd cite that, and here

17

they're following ordinary practice.

I couldn't find anything like that.

what he's alleged -- keep a person chained with his arms

think would be ordinary common sense on that -- at least,

This is a 1994 case.

QUESTION:

And it seems to me exceedingly

3

careless for the counsel who was appointed not to bring

4

that to the magistrate judge's attention.

5

MR. FORRESTER:

Your Honor, in 28 years since

6

Gates v. Collier, no Federal court of which we are aware

7

has ever read it for the broad principle that petitioner

8

now seeks to read it in this case.

context of Gates v. Collier that the officers there were

QUESTION:

17

MR. FORRESTER:

The State

Well, Your Honor, it's not clear

18

that they didn't write it up, and furthermore it wasn't

19

respondent's responsibility.

20

QUESTION:

Whose burden was it -- whose burden

21

would it be to show an entry in the activity log?

After

22

all, the prisoner doesn't -- is not the custodian of that

23

log.

24

just as it was brought forward with respect to the first

25

instance?

Isn't it the State's obligation to bring it forward,

and just couldn't find it, and these three respondents,

They weren't responsible for keeping it because they

he was left on the bar, either.
MR. FORRESTER:
QUESTION:

Correct, Your Honor.

Which makes me wonder whether it was

11

your burden to bring in the regulation or, rather, whether

12

it was the burden of the plaintiff to show that these

13

defendants, when they put him on the bar, knew that he

14

would be left on the bar for 7 hours, and if that was

15

their burden, it seems to me it's not up to you to

16

volunteer the defense which is in the public record, that

17

in fact, if the prison policy was followed, he wouldn't

18

have been left there for 7 hours as soon as he agreed to

19

go back to the work crew.

20

QUESTION:

But it's your position, I take it,

21

that so long as the regulation was in place so that he

22

could go back to work, that the State could legitimately

23

keep him --

24

MR. FORRESTER:

because there's a regulation that says he can go back to

work.

22
23

25

That's your position?
MR. FORRESTER:

No, Your Honor.

The regulation

clearly entitles him to regular water and bathroom breaks.
QUESTION:

But the allegations are that he was

not given water and not given bathroom breaks.

We take

Alderson Reporting Company

those allegations as true for purposes of a summary

judgment motion.

3

MR. FORRESTER:

No, Your Honor, he did not

4

allege, ever, nor present evidence that he was denied a

5

bathroom break, and he did not allege that he was denied

6

water.

7

these two other defendant, nondefendant officers, who are

clearly not these three respondents, deprived him of water

and -- you know, in acts --

12

He simply said that during one 3-hour stretch

QUESTION:

-- certainly in the hot sun for 3

hours without water is fine.
MR. FORRESTER:

That's fine?

If it is being done because he

13

has refused to work -- and I would hasten to add, Your

14

Honor, this is --

15

QUESTION:

But we have nothing in the record, as

16

I understand it, to indicate that.

17

as I understand it, is that's what the regulation makes

18

clear, that that's why they were doing it, but the

19

regulation is not on the record, and I don't see any basis

20

upon which a United States district court is required to

21

take judicial notice of every State's prison regulations

22

if the State doesn't want to put it into the record.

23

MR. FORRESTER:

Your position on that,

Yes, Your Honor.

I mean, I

24

would note that even in the absence of the regulation the

25

district court didn't find his allegations in evidence

Alderson Reporting Company

1

sufficient to make out a claim that would withstand

2

qualified immunity, so introducing that only makes the

3

case all that stronger, but I would hasten to add that the

4

Court did make a finding that he was put on the bar

5

because he was disruptive to the work crew -- work squad.

6

That is the condition in the regulations.

on the bar for a strictly punitive purpose in the sense

8

that petitioners are arguing --

Can you help me with this, Mr.

10

Forrester?

The assumption seems to be in the State's

11

argument that if you restrain a person in order to -- then

12

choose the word, convince, coerce him to do something,

13

that is not punishment.

14

punishment was rehabilitation, or corrections, as well as

15

deterrence and prevention.

Why isn't this punishment if you're

10
11

There's no such allegation in this

MR. FORRESTER:

Petitioner never alleged that he

couldn't have gotten off the bar --

12

QUESTION:

But you didn't allege that you gave

13

him the choice, did you?

14

MR. FORRESTER:

The petitioner bears the burden,

15

as the plaintiff, to say I could not have gotten off the

16

bar if I had asked for it.

17

QUESTION:

I must say, I can't understand why

18

that wasn't put in by the State.

I can't -- I cannot

19

imagine why the State did not raise that point, that he

20

could have gotten off the bar at any time by just saying,

21

I'll go back to work.

22

that?

Why -- what's your explanation for

MR. FORRESTER:

QUESTION:

Why doesn't the -- Ort, which you say

2

he's the magistrate on page 89 and 90, supports your

3

position.

4

Government in support of its position, and I suppose the

5

reason is because they make very clear in that case that

6

it was unusual to deprive a person of water, and in that

7

circumstance, absolutely necessary, and so how, in this

8

circumstance, was it necessary to do what he says they

9

did?

10

Interestingly enough, that case is cited by the

I was deprived of water, was teased by two

11

officers when I asked for water, on one occasion they

12

started to bring me water but ended up giving it to some

13

dogs, I was given some once or twice during 7 hours, but

14

that was not enough, and at one point during the hottest

15

part of the day I was left without water for at least 3

16

hours.

17

All right, so for a person reading the case of

18

Ort, and then reading that, you would think that Ort

19

actually supports the Government, not you, because --

20

unless, of course, there's some reason that behavior like

21

that, if it occurred, would have been necessary, so what

22

is the necessity, or what can you say about it?

MR. FORRESTER:

Well, I would hasten to add,

Your Honor, those allegations that you keep reading again

25

are not alleged against our three respondents.

Is that

their burden to say, I was not responsible, or is it the

Mr. Schaerr, We'll hear from you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GENE C. SCHAERR
ON BEHALF OF MISSOURI, ET AL., AS AMICI CURIAE,

6
7
8

Thank you, Mr. Forrester.

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS
MR. SCHAERR:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

9

We believe this case is controlled by any of

10

three common sense principles of law, each of which is

11

essential if this Court's qualified immunity doctrine is

12

to prevent the problems that it was designed to prevent.

13

The first is that where personal liability is at

14

stake, public officials shouldn't be expected to be more

15

adept at construing case law than the State court judges

16

whose decisions are reviewed in Federal habeas

17

proceedings.

18

Now, the United States appears to adopt a

19

standard that would be equivalent functionally to the

20

standard that this Court has already adopted in the habeas

21

context, and we think the United States' argument in this

22

point is correct, and in fact we believe the Court has

23

already come close to adopting that standard in the

24

Saucier decision, which said the proper inquiry is whether

25

the case on which a plaintiff relies occurred, and I
44
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

quote, under facts not distinguishable in a fair way from

2

the facts presented in the case at hand.

3

that is just another way of saying that the facts of the

4

two cases can't be materially indistinguishable.

5

QUESTION:

It seems to me

Well, let me ask you a different

6

question, though.

7

between materially similar, which was used here, and

8

fundamentally similar, which was disapproved in Lanier?

9

What's the conceptual difference

MR. SCHAERR:

Well, as I understand, the

10

fundamentally similar requirement required a much tighter

11

fit between the facts of the two cases than the materially

12

similar standard does, and I think --

13

QUESTION:

I mean, maybe you're right, but I

14

don't know that from looking at the two words.

15

sounds to me as though materially and fundamentally are

16

substantially similar.

17

(Laughter.)

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. SCHAERR:

20

QUESTION:

I mean, it

I mean, I -And not materially -- you got it.

But it's splitting it pretty fine, it

21

seems to me, and wouldn't it be better, wouldn't it serve

22

clarity better if we in effect said in this case, look,

23

stop paraphrasing the standard, and just stick to the

24

basic standard, and that is, would it be clear to a

25

reasonable officer?

Souter, the way you answer that question is, you look at

9

it.

10

That's

You're not resting anything on materially similar as

the right way to describe it.

11

MR. SCHAERR:

Well, I think it is important and

12

useful for this Court to make the link to the habeas

13

context, because I think that would provide greater

14

clarity in the law, and the ultimate standard under this

15

Court's decisions is whether official action violated

16

clearly established law.

17

Well, that's the exact -- that's exactly the

18

same phrase that's used in the habeas statute, and that

19

this Court has interpreted in Williams and Penry II as

20

meaning materially indistinguishable, and it would be

21

useful, and I think quite productive to apply that in this

22

context as well, and would bring greater clarity to the

23

law.

24
25

QUESTION:

But isn't that -- isn't it a concern

for the State court, because here we're talking about an
46
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

officer, and did he follow what was an Eleventh Circuit

2

decision.

3

MR. SCHAERR:

4

QUESTION:

Right.

There, we're talking about a Federal

5

court overriding a determination by a State court, so I

6

don't think the settings are similar.

7

particular concern that the habeas statute reflects, and

8

that is not overriding a State court's determination.

9

MR. SCHAERR:

There's a

Sure, but -- and I agree the two

10

situations are not entirely identical, but if anything it

11

seems to me the section 1983 context raises even greater

12

federalism concerns, because as this Court recognized a

13

couple of terms ago in Geyer v. Honda, litigation can

14

often be the functional equivalent of a statutory -- of a

15

statute or a regulation, and so what happens in the 1983

16

context, as illustrated in this case, is that courts

17

articulate broad rules that purport to govern the conduct,

18

the day-to-day conduct of elected and nonelected State

19

officials, and so it seems to me if anything the

20

federalism concerns are greater.

21

In another important way, public officials,

22

nonlawyer, nonjudge public officials are at a disadvantage

23

and that, as this Court noted in Saucier, and I quote,

24

public officials are often forced to make split-second

25

judgments in circumstances that are tense, uncertain, and
47

2

they want sometimes to --

3
4

QUESTION:
split-second.

5

Yes, but wait a minute, this is not

We're talking 7 hours here.

MR. SCHAERR:

I agree with that, Justice

6

O'Connor, but the standard, it seems to me, needs to apply

7

to the full range of official action that would be covered

8

by 1983.

9

QUESTION:

Yes, but you have to ask whether a

10

reasonable officer in these circumstances would have known

11

that what was done was unconstitutional.

12

MR. SCHAERR:

I think that ultimately is the

13

answer, and it seems to me the way you answer that is

14

asking the question posed in Saucier, of whether the two

15

cases are materially -- well, are -- whether there's a

16

fair distinction between the two cases, which seems to me

17

amounts to material distinction.

18

QUESTION:

If you're requested to advise the

19

correctional officers in your State as to the standard,

20

the constitutional standard they must observe with

21

reference to restraining inmates, and circumstances like

22

these, what is the standard that you tell them they must

23

follow?

24
25

MR. SCHAERR:

Well, I don't think that's clear

from this Court's decisions at this point, as the United
48
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

States --

2

QUESTION:

Well, they come to you, and you're

3

their attorney, and you have to figure out what we mean up

4

here.

5

MR. SCHAERR:

6

(Laughter.)

7

MR. SCHAERR:

Well, at --

At worst -- at worst I would tell

8

them they have to follow the standard in Farmer.

That is,

9

their actions can't be objectively cruel, but they also --

10

they also cannot act with a subjective awareness of a

11

serious harm to the inmates, and it seems to me that's the

12

key distinction in this case between Gates, or the key

13

reason why Gates is not controlling here.

14

Gates was decided long before Whitley and Farmer and

15

all of those decisions that made clear the subjective

16

requirement in the Eighth Amendment, and indeed if you

17

look at the Eleventh Circuit's opinion, there's not even a

18

finding of any awareness of serious harm that would come

19

to these inmates.

20

serious harm requirement, and so it seems to me Gates,

21

based on this court's current cases, Gates is easily

22

distinguishable, and can't be taken as controlling here.

23
24
25

They just completely overlooked the

Now, the second principle that I'd like to
address is the principle -QUESTION:

2

awkward positions, though.

3

MR. SCHAERR:

4

QUESTION:

5
6

Right.

I don't see any requirement of

serious harm to the inmates.
MR. SCHAERR:

Well, that's right, and that's why

7

it seems to me Gates had been overtaken by this Court's

8

subsequent decisions and therefore was not -- was no

9

longer binding, even if you take it on the terms that the

10

petitioner was --

11

QUESTION:

What decision --

12

QUESTION:

Yes, what --

13

QUESTION:

-- of this Court do you rely on as

14
15

changing what Gates said?
MR. SCHAERR:

Well, Farmer added a new

16

requirement.

17

other decisions that preceded it added a requirement of

18

subjective awareness of a risk of serious harm.

19

didn't impose that kind of requirement at all, and

20

therefore once this Court's decisions made clear that that

21

subjective requirement was present, Gates, it seems to me,

22

could no longer be regarded as controlling in this

23

situation, even if you interpret Gates on its own terms.

24

as the petitioner would have you.

Well, not just Farmer, but Farmer and the

requirement, you think the allegations here don't suffice?

2

MR. SCHAERR:

3

QUESTION:

No, I don't.

At worst, the --

That one would not -- a reasonable

4

person would not be aware that you couldn't restrain

5

someone on a post or rail for 7 hours in the heat, without

6

water more than every 3 hours?

7

MR. SCHAERR:

Well, I think the question is

8

whether the harm that you could foresee from that -- and

9

the record does not suggest that he was without water.

He

10

says that he received water only once or twice during that

11

7-hour period.

12

for 24 hours.

Lots of people go without water and food

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. SCHAERR:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. SCHAERR:

17

I'm sorry.

Also no bathroom breaks for 7 hours.
There's no allegation of that in

his affidavit.

18
19

Yes, but also no bathroom breaks.

QUESTION:

Well, the court of appeals said there

was.

20

MR. SCHAERR:

The court of appeals made a

21

mistake, and this Court has the ability to review the

22

summary judgment record de novo, and it's not a long

23

record.

24
25

But that leads me to the -- to my second
principle, and that is that a public official shouldn't be
51

held liable under section 1983, or shouldn't be stripped

2

of his or her qualified immunity except on the basis of

3

his or her own actions based on reasonable inferences from

4

the summary judgment record, and it seems to me that

5

principle is well-illustrated in the Saucier decision that

6

this Court decided last term.

7

Indeed, as Justice Ginsburg recognized in her

8

concurrence in that case, the evidentiary predicate for

9

denying qualified immunity must consist of what Rule 56(e)

10

calls specific facts set forth in affidavits or other

11

similar evidence.

12

the summary judgment context, even though they might be on

13

a motion to dismiss.

14
15

QUESTION:

General allegations are not enough, in

Can I just ask you a specific

point --

16

MR. SCHAERR:

17

QUESTION:

Yes.

-- because he's right about -- my

18

thing about the defendants was not June 7, it was, he

19

alleges it.

20

denied that these are the right defendants?

21

Is there any place in the record where it's

MR. SCHAERR:

With respect to some of the

22

activity, yes.

23

here, but the burden is on the plaintiff to make that

24

record.

25

I couldn't give you the pages as I sit

QUESTION:

Thank you, Mr. Schaerr.
