ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. MALONE
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS IN NO. 00-568
MR. MALONE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
From 1910 until the issuance of the FERC

12

decision under review, all 50 States regulated

13

transmissions of electricity to retail customers.

14

didn't see the rates, terms, and conditions of that

15

regulation, with a few exceptions, because the rates were

16

bundled in bills that charged customers for all of the

17

elements of retail service which are basically the energy

18

itself, or the commodity, its delivery over transmission

19

high voltage and distribution low voltage lines, and

20

metering and billing.

21

You

The issue in this case is whether the 1935

22

Congress intended the Federal Power Commission, now FERC,

23

to displace the State laws that required that regulation

24

from 1910 until 1996 if the commodity, the energy -- not

25

the transmission, but the commodity -- is unbundled from

2

the retail customers' bills.
The FERC, while conceding that unbundling was

3

never contemplated by the 1935 Congress, nonetheless has

4

taken the position that if the commodity comes out of the

5

bill, in order to give the customer knowledge to effect a

6

choice to buy energy from a utility or a non-utility, then

7

the transmission, although it still remains bundled with

8

other elements and is never shown on the bill, except in

9

the State of California, becomes a new and separate

10

service and that that transmission is subject to

11

preemption so that the States have to leave the scene for

12

only FERC --

13

QUESTION:

What if there -- what if there were

14

no statute at all?

15

Clause, with today's multi-state grids for transmission of

16

power, that the States could have directly regulated

17

energy transmission as a separate service?

18

Do you think that under the Commerce

MR. MALONE:

I don't think there's any question,

19

Your Honor, that under today's Commerce Clause

20

jurisprudence, the States would be able to regulate retail

21

deliveries over transmission facilities, particularly

22

within their own States.

2

I think the -- the jurisprudence, under the dormant

Commerce Clause, leaves no question that the States would

be able to continue regulate retail transmission.

QUESTION:

And

But the statute does give the FERC

jurisdiction over the transmission of electric energy in

interstate commerce.

8

transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce?

9

MR. MALONE:

Are you saying this isn't the

Exactly.

We are saying, Your

10

Honor, that that transmission that was described in 201(b)

11

in 1935 was not transmission headed to retail customers.

12

The court -- the Congress at that time was attempting to

13

fill --

14

QUESTION:

But in 1935, we didn't have these

15

interstate grids, and isn't it conceivable that you could

16

have a power company producing power within a State and

17

distributing it to customers within the State, everything

18

totally intrastate?

19

occurrence at the time the statute was passed.

20

with the multi-state grid, it's hard to know how any

21

transmission that goes on that is other than interstate

22

commerce.

23

MR. MALONE:

That may have been a common
Today,

Well, Your Honor, the rate of

24

interconnection from 1920 to 1935 was actually greater

25

than the rate of interconnection that we have seen since.

The Indiana Consumer Council's reply brief points that

that interconnection was coming.

4

interconnection at the time in '35, and it recognized that

5

notwithstanding that interconnection, that retail

6

regulation was a local service and that the States should

7

continue it.

So, there's no question that the '35 Congress knew

8

There certainly was

And that's why, in addition to crafting 201(b)

9

which referred to transmissions and sales -- and frankly,

10

the Congress wanted to give FERC jurisdiction to regulate

11

transmission independently of sales because if you have a

12

sale from company A to company C, you might have company B

13

that isn't taking title and is simply transmitting.

14

QUESTION:

Are you -- are you saying either of

these two things?

interstate commerce, or are you saying that you simply

cannot read the act to pick up that activity in interstate

commerce?

MR. MALONE:

It clearly is subject to regulation

2

by Congress if it wants to.

3

do not need to get into the question of which

4

transmissions are in interstate commerce and which aren't

5

in order to preserve its jurisdiction over retail

transmissions because Congress wanted the States to be

7

able to continue to regulate retail transmissions.

QUESTION:

We don't need -- the States

This is what I don't understand.

You

-- why do you have to say that Congress wanted the States
to regulate transmissions?

11

As I read the statute, if -- if there's anything

12

wrong with -- with FERC's position, it is that the statute

13

divides the -- there are a lot of ways of dividing the

14

universe.

15

transmission and sale, and giving -- giving FERC authority

16

over transmission means it can regulate the manner of

17

transmission, who -- who is authorized to transmit, who is

18

required to transmit, and all that.

19

The -- the statute divides it between

But the universe of sale is covered by the next

20

portion.

And FERC is authorized to fix prices, to

21

interfere with the sales, only at wholesale in interstate

commerce.

23

retail, FERC is just not given sales regulation authority.

It's still given transmission regulation authority, and it

could still forbid certain people from transmitting and it

could still impose certain requirements over transmission,

even at the local level, but it simply cannot regulate the

Why isn't -- why isn't that the way to look at
it rather than --

regulates transmissions to retail customers.

Your Honor, if -- what we're interested in is

16

the following:

the 127 million customers in this country, and we don't

want to lose the ability to do that if we take a pro-

-- the transmission is not even unbundled.

It's not

It's still -- it's not shown on -- on bills.

don't see why you do it -- that the right to regulate

MR. MALONE:

No, we -- we don't.

We don't

concede that.

What I'm saying is that when unbundles -- when

one unbundles transmission, the States don't lose it, even

if it's out there by itself, if it's part of retail.

me give an example.

If it's sale of the commodity,

12

as the energy itself.

the sale of the energy, the commodity, at retail belongs

to the State, but not the transportation or transmission

So, why couldn't one read this:

When FERC brought this bill to

Congress, it said the main portion of the bill is

West Virginia, owns lines from West Virginia to North

It's Carolina Power & Light.

QUESTION:

So, your point then is if

19

my hypothetical is true in 1935, all we have in this case

20

is 1935, is my hypothetical, with the additional fact that

21

instead of Duke Power which really is generating that

22

power, there's also the possibility that Enron will come

23

in and supplant Duke Power.

5

MR. MALONE:

I just wanted to add, Justice

6

Breyer, that if you look at 206(d), that calls on FERC to

7

provide costs in your hypothetical from West Virginia to

8

the North Carolina --

9

QUESTION:

Then I would say if that's your

10

argument, the response to that argument will be this is an

11

unforeseen case in '35, the possibility of Enron

12

supplanting Duke, and it's close enough to wholesale

13

sales.

14

MR. MALONE:

If Enron supplants Duke and sells

15

directly to a retail customer, it's going to be purchasing

electricity, selling retail, over a delivery system that

Enron does not own.

QUESTION:

May I ask you one question --

4

QUESTION:

Mr. Malone.

5

QUESTION:

-- about the words in the statute?

6

The statute uses an and.

It says that -- that on the

7

Federal side, there's authority over two things, and one

8

is transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce

9

-- that's one thing -- and the sale of such energy at

10

wholesale in interstate commerce.

11

the and.

12

saying the transmission has to be read as linked to the

13

sale as wholesale, that they're not discrete pieces.

14

Both (a) and (b) use

But I take it from your argument that you're

MR. MALONE:

Not quite, Your Honor.

If you have

15

-- if we go back to Justice Breyer's hypothetical and we

16

have company A in West Virginia which is selling to

17

company C in North Carolina with an intermittent carrier

18

by a transmission line, we would concede that FERC would

19

have jurisdiction over the transmission, even though

20

company B is not taking title and is simply carrying.

21

that was intended by Congress and that's why it did not

22

link the transmission and the sale.

23

transmitter does not have to be selling the energy.

24

Either way, FERC has jurisdiction.

25

And

MR. MALONE:

But it should be a wholesale

transaction.

3

QUESTION:

-- could I come back to Justice

4

Ginsburg's earlier question which focused on section

5

824(b)(2), which says that the provisions shall not apply

6

to any other sale of electric energy.

7

focused on the fact that it just says, sale of electric

8

energy, and doesn't say, sale of transmission.

9

And her question

Now, it seems to me your response to that -- if

10

I were making the response, at least, I would have said

11

that if -- if sale of electric energy in (b)(2) is so

12

narrow that it just means the commodity and not the -- the

13

transmission and the servicing and -- and the metering and

14

everything else, if it is that narrow in (2), it would

15

also be that narrow in (1).

16

FERC authority over the sale of electric energy at

17

wholesale.

18

sale at wholesale includes authority over the price of the

19

commodity, the price of the transmission, the price of

20

everything else.

And -- and (1) gives -- gives

And I -- I assume that that authority over the

21

So, if you're going to give it an expansive

22

reading in (1), it seems to me you have to give it an

23

expansive reading in (2).

over the whole sale at wholesale, so -- so the States have

authority over the whole sale at retail.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LOUIS R. COHEN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER IN NO. 00-809

16
17
18

MR. COHEN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
FERC's open access transmission tariff is

19

concerned with usage of the interstate transmission grid,

20

something that only FERC can effectively regulate.

21

OATT does require that interstate transmission rates be

22

published and be proportional to usage, but its major

23

concern, as Pennsylvania's amicus brief says more

24

eloquently than we did, is rules of the road, access,

25

usage priorities, classes of service, reservation and

The

scheduling of service, access to real-time information

2

about the system, pro rata curtailment in periods of

3

constraint, and similar matters that the States don't and

4

can't regulate.

5

FERC found endemic, undue discrimination in the

6

provision of interstate transmission service by the

7

traditional utilities that collectively own most of the

8

grid.

9

to cure that discrimination.

But FERC did not comply with the statutory command
FERC imposed the OATT but

10

said it had no jurisdiction to apply it to transmissions

11

that are bundled with retail energy sales, and thus

12

exempted about 60 percent of the traffic from the rules of

13

the road.

14
15
16

QUESTION:

Did it say it had no jurisdiction or

just chose, in its discretion, not to regulate them?
MR. COHEN:

It said that the transmissions

17

should not be considered within the interstate

18

transmission clause giving FERC jurisdiction over

19

interstate transmissions, but rather, in the case of

20

transmissions bundled with retail sales, should be

21

considered part of the bundled retail sale.

have stressed the distinction between FERC's jurisdiction

9

Let me put it this way.

The State regulates

10

retail sales.

11

more, but two of its costs are the cost of power, which it

12

may buy at wholesale, and the cost of transmission of

13

power, which it incurs in order to make a retail sale.

14

Both of those two things are regulated by the -- by the

Federal Government, by -- by FERC.

A retail seller has two costs.

It may have

And just as this Court has squarely held that

17

the -- that FERC's jurisdiction over the cost of wholesale

things.

As Justice O'Connor pointed out, these are two

separate and independent grants of jurisdiction to FERC.

6

One is wholesale sales of -- of the commodity, and the

Now, it's true in this case, this case turns

9

primarily on rights of access, physical access, to the

10

transmission capacity.

11

access is also regulating the rates because different

reading of what Congress thought it was doing when it

That means that you do have jurisdiction to reach this

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes.

And in the -- in the

Mr. Kneedler, I'm really puzzled

because I -- I must have misread the papers.

that the position of the FERC, at the agency level and the

But FERC made a --

So, the position of the Government

is, in respect to Enron's case, not New York's, Enron is

right.

FERC does have jurisdiction, but FERC, in

exercising that jurisdiction, could say, we do not wish to

exercise it.

And that's what happened here.

QUESTION:

The commission in this --

Is that -- is that your position or

not?
MR. KNEEDLER:

I cannot speak for FERC on that

question because FERC did not address that in this order.

17

All FERC said was it was not going to order the

18

unbundling, and -- and all it was doing was -- was

19

regulating the transmission component where there is

20

unbundling.

21

QUESTION:

But I want to know what -- I have an

22

argument in some briefs made by Enron, and perhaps I

23

misread them and I'll go back to them.

24

Enron was saying the error that FERC made and the

jurisdiction to give us the order we'd like them to give.

2

Now, I read that, I think, in their briefs.

3

Therefore, I want to know what does the

4

Government say about that.

5

they are right in claiming that FERC had jurisdiction, but

6

they are wrong if they say that FERC had to exercise it.

7

Now, that's what I would like to know, just what the

8

position is.

9

MR. KNEEDLER:

And what I hear you saying is

Well, there are really two points

10

about FERC's power here -- authority here that I would --

11

would like to separate.

12

authority of the sort Justice Kennedy was asking, where --

13

where a utility is -- is reserving its load for bundled

14

retail in a way that frustrates the ability of someone

15

like Enron to pass through its power to another State.

16

That would -- that would be, in effect, imposing an

17

obstacle, like cutting the line, that is frustrating the

18

ability of FERC to regulate the -- the aspects of

19

transmission that New York, I think, concedes that FERC

20

has.

whether the court of appeals properly deferred to the

2

commission's determination that it lacks jurisdiction over

3

retail transmission service that is sold together with

electric energy in a single bundled transaction, et

5

6

Now, I have to answer that question.

Do I

7

answer that question yes or no, that it did properly defer

8

or that it did not properly defer?

9

MR. KNEEDLER:

It did properly defer because the

10

predicate is that there is a single transaction.

11

the transmission service has not been separated out of the

12

one bundled transaction.

17

Okay.

Are you -- are you saying that

Are you also saying that if FERC chooses not to

Mr. Kneedler, may I ask you this

5

question?

If we assume -- we assume the commission has

said that they do not have jurisdiction when the

8

unbundled or compelled to be unbundled by State or Federal

authority.

If we disagreed with that and said, no, you do

10

have jurisdiction there, is there anything in the statute

11

that would compel them to exercise the jurisdiction?

12

MR. KNEEDLER:

No.

I think -- I think FERC

13

would have great authority in deciding how to identify

14

discrimination and how to deal with it.

15

I wanted to mention one last point with respect

16

to New York's claim -- desire to protect its -- its retail

17

customers, and particularly those in dire needs.

-- this tariff -- and I'd point the Court to pages 772 to

limitations on that because, among other things, the act

Court said in -- in Pennsylvania -- in Pennsylvania Gas.

14

It's regulating the retail sale that may have an
