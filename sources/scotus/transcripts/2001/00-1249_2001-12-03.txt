Mr. Wilson.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD L. WILSON

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9

MR. WILSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10

please the Court,in the unanimous opinion in Freedman

11

versus Maryland this court stated that when the government

12

imposes a permit requirement on the exercise of free

13

speech, that permit scheme must include certain procedural

14

safeguards which are there, quite obviously, to prevent

15

the unwarranted and perhaps unlawful delay or suppression

16

of speech that might occur without them.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, Freedman was a

18

quite different case from the present one. You agree with

19

that, don t you? I mean, there you re talking about some

20

form of censorship. Here you re talking about a permit to

21

use a park that a lot of other people want to use.

22

MR. WILSON: While agree that there s a

23

difference between the two cases,this case begs for more

24

protection than the speech involved in Freedman. Because

25

after all, the Freedman case was specifically -

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

specifically arose from a censorship scheme which was

2

aimed at sexually explicit speech. This is a case

3

involving core political speech. And although the -

4
5

QUESTION: Well is this content neutral in your
view, the regulation?

6

MR. WILSON: I believe that the regulation in

7

this case is content neutral. It is rife with the

8

opportunity to make viewpoint based decision, but not on

9

its face.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: I have to say that

11

thinking about the case, I suppose analytically this is a

12

prior restraint. And we have said that there s a heavy

13

presumption within validity. But on the other hand, it s a

14

content based time, place and manner regulation, and we

15

have sustained these in case after case, and you want to

16

make this a Freedman case.

17

Freedman was a case where you had to submit your

18

speech to prior examination, prior submission of speech,

19

and it was in that context, and the Court was very clear,

20

as I recall, in Freedman to say when -- there must be

21

prior submission of speech, then you have to have the

22

procedures Freedman set forth, so I think you're really

23

stretching our precedents, particularly Freedman, to put

24

Freedman in your case.

25

It's true you may have some other arguments, if

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

there were some content-based suppression going on, but

2

this isn't a Freedman case.

3

allow us to make that leap.

4

MR. WILSON:

Our authorities just don't

Justice Kennedy, with respect, I

5

could not disagree with you more, and I think we can look

6

at a few cases to show that this is surely a prior

7

restraint case, and the one that comes to mind most

8

readily is where that exact same question was presented to

9

this Court when, in FW/PBS v. The City of Dallas, the

10

Fifth Circuit had held that the Dallas licensing scheme,

11

which was content-neutral, period, in all regards, which a

12

content-neutral licensing scheme licensing sexually

13

oriented business in Dallas, was a time, place, and manner

14

restriction, and this Court rejected that approach and

15

said, first we find that it is an unlawful prior

16

restraint, and therefore it is --

17

QUESTION:

Well, I think your premise may be one

18

that we're going to have trouble adopting.

19

a public park.

20

and presumably there may well be competing interests

21

trying to use the park at the very same time, when it

22

can't accommodate every possible use at all times.

23

is there no way that the park can attempt to find rules of

24

the game so that everybody gets accommodated?

25

This is use of

It is limited in terms of size and space,

MR. WILSON:

Now,

Justice O'Connor, there's no

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

indication in this record or in any situation that I'm

2

aware of -QUESTION:

3

But just answer whether that is

4

possible, under First Amendment time, place, and manner

5

doctrine.

6

political speech, but is it a possible time, place, and

7

manner regulation to say a group of 300 wants to use it

8

Tuesday, and a second group of 600 wants to use it

9

Tuesday, we have to sort out who gets it and when?

10

Yes, it's public space, and yes, it is

Is

that not possible?
MR. WILSON:

11

Certainly, Justice O'Connor, that's

12

possible.

What we complain about is when the Government

13

can say, we will decide who gets to use the park,

14

particularly when the scheme is such, when it lacks the

15

kind of standards required that the Government can make

16

that choice improperly.

17

QUESTION:

But aren't you --

18

QUESTION:

Under the standards there was a list

19

of 13, and they seem to be reasonable, fairly clear

20

standards, and you are coming to us with a facial

21

challenge, and are we to project that those standards will

22

not work properly?

23

concrete case.

24
25

You're not coming to us with any

MR. WILSON:

Justice Ginsburg, the record in

this instance is a solid, concrete case.

Mr. McDonald was

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

denied his right to core political speech using those

standards.

understand it.

21

MR. WILSON:

Yes.
Yes, that is true.

Those have not

22

been obtained without great difficulty, however.

Indeed,

23

the brief of the Chicago Park District indicates that the

24

permit for the event for this fall was granted.

25

district filed that brief before the organization was

notified that somehow the park district had lost that

2

application and the permit therefore was not valid, and

3

they'd have to go some place else.

4

QUESTION:

In any --

5

QUESTION:

Well, still the point remains that I

6

just think you overstate the case when you tell us this is

7

a Freedman case.

8

time, place, and manner regulation that's content-neutral,

9

if there are two groups that want a use a space that hold

Justice O'Connor gave you the simplest

10

100 and they're each 100, do you have to sort out the two.

11

That is not a Freedman case.

12

us to the wall it's a prior restraint.

13

are cases that say that prior restraints have a heavy

14

burden.

15

Sure, I suppose if you push
Of course there

But we have sustained in countless cases

16

content-neutral time, place, and manner regulations for

17

the use of parks and those are not Freedman cases, period,

18

as I read the cases.

19
20

Now --

MR. WILSON:

Justice Kennedy, I think clearly

it's a prior restraint.

I mean, there are two --

21

QUESTION:

Well, I happen to disagree with

22

Justice Kennedy's suggestion.

23

strain all over the case to find that this is a prior

24

restraint.

1

MR. WILSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, from Neer v.

2

Minnesota forward, the Court has said that when speech is

3

prohibited in advance, that is a prior restraint.

4
5

QUESTION:

Okay, but Neer was the shutting down

of a, padlocking of a newspaper --

6

MR. WILSON:

7

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
-- of a private -- the shoe is on the

8

other foot here.

Nobody is telling your client he can't

9

run a printing press in a private place.

What -- your

10

client is coming and saying, we want to use this public

11

park that a lot of other people want to use, and to say

12

that you're going to have to get in line and obey some

13

rules, it doesn't come close to being a prior restraint.

14

MR. WILSON:

My problem with that, Mr. Chief

15

Justice, is not that you have to get in line with other

16

people and share the use of the park, which was Justice

17

O'Connor's concern when she posed the time, place, and

18

manner question.

19

My complaint is that the way this scheme is set

20

up, it allows the park district to choose which people in

21

that line can come forward and get their pass to speak,

22

and which people in that line --

23

QUESTION:

Do you think the language of, may

24

grant, is something that allows too much discretion?

25

that your complaint?

Is

these conditions are met?

MR. WILSON:

MR. WILSON:

QUESTION:

9
10

It is one of our complaints, and

Well, it says -I don't know what it means.
It says may deny, is what it says.
It says may deny, but maybe it

mean -- means that the permit must be granted if the
categories are met.
MR. WILSON:

11

But that's not what it says,

12

Justice O'Connor.

Indeed, the Seventh Circuit recognized

13

that the use of the word, may in this scheme creates the

14

potential --

15

QUESTION:

16

conditions are met.

17

if the conditions are not met.

18

isn't it?

19

MR. WILSON:

20

QUESTION:

21

24
25

You just say, it need not be denied
That's your complaint,

Correct.
You agree that if the conditions are

met, your client meets all the conditions, he gets in.
MR. WILSON:

22
23

You agree it must be granted if

I agree with that, Justice Scalia.

What I -QUESTION:

Okay.

You're saying if your client

doesn't meet some of the conditions, he may not be allowed

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

in, whereas somebody that the park district likes more

2

will be allowed in.

3

MR. WILSON:

4

QUESTION:

Yes, Justice.
That same thing was true, wasn't it,

5

in Poulos? I mean, the language in Poulos was even more

6

protean than the language in the may phrase.
MR. WILSON:

7
8

decided differently by this Court had the -QUESTION:

9
10
11

I think Poulos would have been

So we've got to overrule it to hold

your way.
MR. WILSON:

Yes.

Had the -- had your court,

12

the supreme court of New Hampshire, not construed that

13

statute in such a limiting way to say that if you apply

14

for a permit under Poulos and under Cox you get the

15

permit, there was no discretion to deny, and in the

16

opinion that this Court wrote in Poulos, it pointed that

17

out, that that cured the problem in that case, and I think

18

realistically this Court has recognized the --

19

QUESTION:

But wasn't the discretion left the

20

same discretion, in effect, to evaluate facts, and to act

21

based upon that evaluation which the Chicago scheme

22

allowed Chicago?

23

MR. WILSON:

My understanding of that case is

24

that after the construction the New Hampshire court placed

25

on it, that became part and parcel of the statute, and

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

even though the statute retained the discretion, it had

2

authoritatively been limited by the New Hampshire supreme

3

court, so the discretion was gone by judicial act and not

4

by legislative change.
QUESTION:

5
6

somebody who met the conditions?

7

MR. WILSON:

8

QUESTION:

9
10

Yes, sir.
But there -- was there no discretion

to grant someone who did not meet the conditions?

Did the

New Hampshire supreme court speak to that?

11

MR. WILSON:

12

QUESTION:

13

The discretion was gone to deny

Well, the interesting -It's the latter that you're

complaining about, not the former.
MR. WILSON:

14

It is the latter.

By the way,

15

Justice Scalia, there's another aspect of your inquiry,

16

and we both agree, obviously, that if you meet the

17

qualifications, you're entitled to the permit.

18

further.

19

not impossible, to show that you meet the qualifications

20

because of the behind-closed-doors way that this permit

21

scheme is imposed and implemented, and this case presents

22

the perfect example.

23

It goes no

In this case, however, it is very difficult, if

As the Court knows from the record in this case,

24

Mr. McDonald vehemently and categorically denied that he

25

had done those things which under the code would deny him

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

a permit, but that made no difference.

2

park district say that as far as we are concerned you did

3

it, and you are not entitled to speak, that prevents you,

4

in our opinion, from ever speaking in a park for the rest

5

of your life, and anyone associated with you.

6

QUESTION:

Not only did the

But that didn't happen, and you

7

say -- you give us this one instance.

8

record of uneven applications, and beyond that, I would

9

really like to know what is your idea of a scheme that

10
11

You don't have a

would be compatible with the First Amendment.
In answer to Justice O'Connor you said yes, they

12

can have rules of the road, so there aren't too many

13

people at any time, that there aren't colliding events.

14

What scheme do you say is necessary to meet the First

15

Amendment?

16

MR. WILSON:

First, in direct answer to Justice

17

O'Connor's inquiry, a scheme that says you may not obtain

18

a permit for an event at a day and time for which another

19

permit has already been issued, no question.

20

complaint that anyone could have.

21
22

QUESTION:

Well, of course, that assumes that

you have a permit scheme, so it doesn't work.

23

MR. WILSON:

24

QUESTION:

25

There's no

I'm sorry, Justice Kennedy.
That assumes that you can have a

permit scheme.

have a --

4
5

Surely you can have a permit

I think this Court has made it very clear you can

QUESTION:

Well, that's what we're asking, what

the requisites are for the permit scheme.

6

MR. WILSON:

The question may well be, when can

7

you lawfully deny a permit for free speech under this --

8

under a permit scheme in what is the traditional public

9

forum, a public park, and what is the most precious of

10

speech, core political speech.
QUESTION:

11

Well, you're saying the most precious

12

speech.

Are you suggesting that if, say, somebody wanted

13

to have a softball game in the park and they applied, and

14

your client wanted to have a speech in the park, and he

15

applied, that your client should be given some sort of a

16

preference over the softball game because it's free

17

speech, or --

18

MR. WILSON:

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. WILSON:

No.
-- core speech?
No, Mr. Chief Justice.

I am saying

21

that if that softball game had a permit, the free speech

22

event would have to take place at another day, at another

23

time, or at another location.

QUESTION:

25

But they're both before the board.

MR. WILSON:

3

QUESTION:

It would seem -You're positing a situation in which

4

somebody has already been granted a permit for the time.

5

What if -- what about the situation where you have several

6

people who want to get in for a time that has not yet been

7

committed to anybody.

8

MR. WILSON:

9

A first come, first serve rule

would certainly help the situation and, of course, these

10

permit applications are dated, time-dated and time-stamped

11

when they are submitted, but there is no requirement that

12

it be first come, first served.

16

QUESTION:

18

What if they collide on their

MR. WILSON:

What's your rule then?

Does

Is that the tie-breaker?

Well, obviously it's a very

19

difficult question on facts which might never, ever occur,

20

and I'm not claiming that when the park district is making

21

a decision on whether to issue a permit, or space A on day

22

A, it has to look at these permits and say, oops,

23

political speech, first in line, and that's --

24
25

QUESTION:

If it doesn't say that, doesn't it

retain exactly the discretion that you're complaining

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

about?
MR. WILSON:

2

No, sir.

If it said first come,

3

first serve according to the time date and time stamp,

4

that would solve the problem.

5

assumes --

6

QUESTION:

Your hypothetical

Okay, we've got the collision at the

7

door.

wins, your problem doesn't arise.

9

tie-breaker rule, it seems to me, there is enough

10
11

If the tie-breaker rule is political speech always
If there isn't that

discretion left to be a violation on your view.
MR. WILSON:

Well, I would certainly think that

12

this case need not turn on that somewhat unlikely

13

occurrence.

14

QUESTION:

Well, maybe, but I'd like to know

15

what the principle is that you want us to apply, and I

16

think the principle that you want us to apply means that

17

when they bump each other's foreheads at the door,

18

political speech has got to win, or there's an

19

unconstitutional discretion left, amounting to the

20

possibility of a prior restraint.

21

If that's wrong, tell me why it's wrong.

22

MR. WILSON:

I believe that's wrong because --

23

well, first of all, again, we're not going to find that

24

situation, but let's assume we did, and they bump their

25

heads on the way in.

First come, first served is a

16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

reasonable approach, if that is a concrete and

2

consistently -QUESTION:

3

Yes, but you just keep changing the

4

hypothetical.

5

time rule, first come, first served, doesn't work?

6

the principle?
MR. WILSON:

7
8

What's the principle in the case that the
What's

When first come, first served does

not work?
QUESTION:

9

MR. WILSON:

10

Yes, the hypo.
It would seem that as long as the

11

event is suitable for that particular park, first come,

12

first serve should always work.
QUESTION:

13

But by hypothesis, Justice Souter's

14

question is you can't apply it here because they both came

15

at the same time.

16

MR. WILSON:

17

QUESTION:

18

right?

You don't have an answer for that,

You don't have an answer for that situation.

MR. WILSON:

MR. WILSON:

QUESTION:

23

Well --

I don't.
Okay.
I really don't, and -But you think first come, first serve

is a thoroughly reasonable rule.

MR. WILSON:

I do.

4

QUESTION:

I've met them.

The park district always has the

5

availability of going to court to seek a court order in

6

that unusual situation to demonstrate to a court that this

7

is such an extraordinary event that they should be able to

8

withdraw that permit and make reasonable accommodation to

9

the other events, and it's -- like Justice Souter's

10

hypothetical, it conceivably could happen.

11

to happen very often.
QUESTION:

It's not going

It may never happen.

It's not Pope John Paul, it's the

Beatles, and the Beatles are only going to be there for

one day.

whether the Beatles are more important than your Hemp

16

concert?

I mean, you're going to have courts decide

MR. WILSON:

17

No, sir, and that's why I believe

18

that a first come, first serve rule is going to be

19

reasonable in almost all situations.

All right, but just --

It seems to me the problem with

Just testing your brief, you say that

even under the first come, first serve rule the Government

25

has the obligation to go to court to validate the permit,

2

sure, that's what Freedman said, but Freedman was a very

3

special case, and a time, place, and manner regulation for

4

a park is not.
MR. WILSON:

5

Well, of course, Freedman has -- I

6

mean, the analysis from Freedman has been used in

7

noncensorship cases, but in that case the Government needs

8

to bear that burden.

It's a very slight burden.

QUESTION:

the Government goes to court.

13

Amendment.

14

following the Freedman mode, is a State court, and yet

15

from this very litigation it seems that you prefer the

16

Federal court, so how would a Freedman scheme do you any

17

good at all, considering that your preferred forum is the

18

Federal court, and I don't think, if the Government

19

brought that case, if the park district brought that case

20

in the State court, wouldn't you be stuck there?

21

Mr. Wilson, where -- where?

It's

You say,

The park district goes to

The court you're assuming, I gather, if you're

MR. WILSON:

No question, of course, the

22

Supremacy Clause makes Freedman applicable to that State

23

court, but the likelihood that an individual is going to

24

insist on going forward with judicial review when his

25

permit was denied because another permit had already been

20
Alderson Reporting Company

QUESTION:

2

No, but I'm asking you -- I asked you

3

before, what is the scheme that you said would be

4

constitutional, and one part of it surprised me.

5

Freedman.

6

you don't want to be in State court.

with a 1983 action, but you didn't.

You go to the State court.

MR. WILSON:

9

You said

But it seems to me
You were brought

You could have gone to State court

The problem with that, we have

10

brought a facial challenge in this case because of the

11

difficulty, every single time one is refused a permit, in

12

going to State court or Federal court and litigating

13

whether that particular denial was appropriate, and the

14

medicine here is to get rid of the bad ordinance which

15

allows inappropriate and content-based, or viewpoint-

16

based decisions behind closed doors, even if they are not

17

authorized on the face of the scheme.
It's a burden that the Government ought to bear

18
19

in core political speech cases, and it is not a great

20

burden.

Do you know any park district that

instance, in California, it's not a park district, but in

2

response to the decision of the Ninth Circuit in Baby Tam,

3

the California legislature enacted Chapter 49 of the

4

California statutes, which mandates that when a permit is

5

denied for a First Amendment business, which the Baby Tam

6

case involved, it is the Government who must bear the

7

burden, and the time limits are very stringent.
QUESTION:

The --

We're talking about a business, a

permit to operate a business, not to hold an event in a
public park.
MR. WILSON:

11

Well, I would suggest, Justice

12

Ginsburg, that a permit to hold a core political speech

13

rally in a public park deserves at least as much

14

protection as the permit to operate an adult bookstore.

17
18

Well, you're arguing for content-

You're simply wrong under our cases

there.

19

MR. WILSON:

20

QUESTION:

I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice.
I say, I think you're wrong under our

21

cases there.

The Government has a right to make

22

substantial choice in determining who's going to use its

23

premises, whereas the owner of private premises is

24

entitled to use them as he pleases, subject only to the

25

permit process.

Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. WILSON:

But this Court has said that in

2

cases of public parks, the power of the Government to

3

restrict free speech activity is at its most

4

circumscribed.

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. WILSON:

7

And where did we say that?
We said that in Hague v. -- you

said that in Hague v. CIO.

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. WILSON:

Well, that was 60 years ago.
But no one has ever suggested, Mr.

10

Chief Justice, that that is not the law today, and indeed,

11

that one quotation from Hague appears in core political

12

speeches through this day, and it is one of the most oft-

13

repeated statements from the cases.

14
15

QUESTION:

Yes.

That doesn't make it valid

QUESTION:

But isn't your argument for applying

today.

16
17

it this.

18

content-neutral set of criteria can be abused, and isn't

19

the answer to that an applied challenge as opposed to a

20

facial challenge?

21

Your argument seems to boil down to saying, a

MR. WILSON:

No, it is not, Justice Souter.

My

22

answer to that is, make the Government come into court and

23

demonstrate to a reviewing court that it was not abused,

24

that it was an appropriate denial of speech, and that's

25

where the burden belongs.

1

QUESTION:

That's why the -- there's no need to

2

retreat from Hague, I wouldn't think.

It is important,

3

but the question is what set of rules are appropriate to

4

safeguard the interests of the many people who might want

5

to use the park for different purposes, so why don't you

6

go back to Justice Souter's question and say, well, why

7

isn't it -- answer, why isn't it perfectly appropriate to

8

have a set of neutral criteria, that is a fair set of

9

criteria, and if they are a disguised way of censoring

10

someone, simply leave that up to the as-applied

11

circumstance where the person who is being censored will

12

go into court and say, judge, this is a trick, they're

13

after me, and the judge will decide?

14

MR. WILSON:

Justice Breyer, in order to do that

15

it would seem that this Court would have to retreat from

16

what it said in Forsyth, in which it stated that when a

17

prior restraint in the form of a permit to conduct a

18

political event in a public forum is involved, a facial

19

challenge is appropriate, and the court --

20

QUESTION:

21

make the challenge.

22

lose on the ground that it's a fair set of criteria, and

23

if, in fact, they're not applying that set of criteria

24

fairly, sufficient unto the day.

25

Nobody says -- nobody denies you can
I just want to know why you don't

It's the same question, but I think that that's

1

initially what I got from Justice Souter, and I just want

2

to know directly your answer.

3

MR. WILSON:

My answer is that this a particular

4

situation where facial challenges are appropriate.

5

is not a case where the individual need to go to court and

6

demonstrate that in this particular instance his permit

7

was wrongly denied.

8

9

danger that it was wrongly denied, and because that danger

is there, the permit scheme cannot be allowed to stand -QUESTION:

May I just ask one question about

12

your rule about priorities, and it's the basic rule.

13

assume they might have a cut-off, say we won't consider

14

applications more than 90 days ahead of time, or something

15

like that, but do you say it is totally impermissible for

16

the park district to use content of what is going to be

17

done in the use of the park as one of the criteria for

18

deciding who gets the -- on competing demands?

MR. WILSON:

QUESTION:

I

Content of the speech.
One is a baseball game, another is a

21

concert, another is a lecture on dinosaurs, and another is

23

that one of those uses is more appropriate on a particular

time and place within the park?

Is it totally impermissible to decide

and one of them is a free speech event and one of them is

a softball game, and the decision is made based on what

the free speech is urging, what the message is, that is

entirely inappropriate.

If it's hostility to the message, I

Yes, sir.
But just supposing all you know about

it is, they want to make -- it's a political rally of some

kind on the one hand, baseball, music, all those -- can

11

the content, without any hostility to the particular

message, be one of the criteria that can break ties?

I'm not sure it's commanded, either, but --

MR. STRAUSS:

I guess --

Let me ask you this.

Do you think

16

that that's constitutionally required there be a first

17

come, first serve rule?
MR. STRAUSS:

18

Well, it is our system, Justice

19

Stevens.

20

wouldn't be implicated in our defense of our system.

21

I -- so really this would be a question that

I guess I think no, it is not constitutionally

22

required to proceed on a first come, first serve basis.

23

There could be other legitimate criteria that might be

24

used, but I do want to emphasize that is what we do.

MR. STRAUSS:

2

My understanding, Justice Scalia,

3

is that we have a practice, although I don't know if it's

14

meets all the requirements.

Could you explain the degree of

discretion to grant, in the event that the conditions are

not satisfied?

17

MR. STRAUSS:

Yes, Justice Souter.

Our view,

18

which we think is really the only reasonable reading of

19

the ordinance, is that we can exercise discretion, as it

20

were, within the criteria, so that if there is a way to

21

grant the application that -- an application that is in

22

violation that does not defeat the purpose of the

23

conditions, we will try to do that.

24
25

Let me be more concrete about it.

The place

where this comes up most frequently is with a late

31
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

application, and --

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. STRAUSS:

Late?
A late -- late application,

4

application that's not submitted.

We have a schedule of

5

deadlines which are very specific.

Often, they're not

6

met.

7

Black's terms from Oregon v. City of Struthers, the poorly

8

financed causes of little people.

9

who often get their applications in late, and the park

In fact, they're habitually not met by, in Justice

Those are the people

10

district's view is, if it's -- if we can make the

11

necessary accommodations, and do the necessary setup and

12

necessary coordination and free the space for you, even

13

though your application is late, we will do it, and that's

14

the kind of discretion we exercise.
QUESTION:

15

Would there have been discretion in

16

this case?

17

the fact that if that earlier gathering people were still

18

hanging around at 11:00, after -- or after 11:00 when the

19

park closed.

20

that?

21

Let's assume the only prior violation had been

Would there have been discretion to forgive

MR. STRAUSS:

Yes, there would have been, if we

22

had concluded that -- if the applicant said to us

23

something that gave us reason to believe it wouldn't

24

happen again, or if the nature of the event were such that

25

it was scheduled earlier in the day, or something like

32
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that, that it wouldn't happen again, or if it happened

2

again it wouldn't be so much of a problem, but we don't

3

assert, and I don't think you can assert, consistent with

4

the ordinance, a kind of free-floating discretion to

5

overlook violations for people we like and not for people

we don't like.

Does the record tell us how many

permits are granted and how many denied each year by the
park?
MR. STRAUSS:

Justice O'Connor, on the grants,

12

the record, the most precise number we have in the record

13

is there are thousands of applications and thousands of

14

grants a year.

15

our lodging, the permits granted from January through

16

August of this year, and there were over 1,000 of those in

17

one region of the park.

We submitted to the Court the permits in

18

QUESTION:

How about denials?

19

MR. STRAUSS:

Denials, Justice O'Connor, is a

20

hard number to come up with, and this bears on the

21

Freedman v. Maryland point, because what often happens is

22

that the denial takes the form of saying, we can't

23

accommodate you at this space at this time, but if you're

24

willing to move your event a week later, or willing to

25

move it to this alternative site, then we can accommodate

1
2

you.
Now, I suppose that's a denial, because we're

3

not granting the permit applied for, and I suppose if

4

petitioner prevails we would have to go to court and

5

defend that denial, which seems a really unworkable

6

scheme, but because of that the park district really

7

can't -- couldn't tell me how many denials there are,

8

because so many of them are worked out and the event goes

9

forward in a different time or place than that which was

10
11

applied for.
I think there are really three ways in which

12

this case differs from Freedman v. Maryland.

13

One which

We are not only not concerned with the content

18

of speech, we are not concerned with whether the event

19

involves speech or expressive activity at all, and if you

20

look at the application form, unless the applicant somehow

discloses it, there is really no way for us to know from

22

the application form what kind, whether this is a speech-

variety of events not involving speech.

Mr. McDonald based on some prior event where people stayed

MR. STRAUSS:

Justice O'Connor, it was denied

5

for multiple reasons.

6

wasn't filled out properly.

7

partly because one of the applicants was not an

8

organization that had the capacity to sue or be sued, and

also because of a series of violations of which that was

10

only one.

The form omitted information,

There was also -QUESTION:

It was denied partly because it

Are there administrative mechanisms

12

in place for someone who wants to challenge the basis for

13

the denial to raise it administratively?
MR. STRAUSS:

14

Yes, there is, Justice O'Connor.

15

There's a provision for an appeal to the general

16

superintendent of the park district from the decision made

17

by the permitting officers in the park district, and you

18

can submit any material you like to the general

19

superintendent, who must rule on it promptly.

doesn't rule on it promptly, then the appeal is deemed

allowed.

QUESTION:

If he

I take it that's the second

distinction from Freedman.
MR. STRAUSS:

Well, the second distinction from

Freedman -- that is a distinction, Justice Souter, but the

35
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

second distinction really is that a key premise of

2

Freedman is that the decision in question was one that the

3

courts had superior competence to make, and that the

4

agency was to be distrusted in making.

5

decision was whether the speech was constitutionally

6

protected or is obscene, and a theme of Freedman is, as

7

the Court said in Freedman, a censor's business is to

8

censor, and this is really something that requires, in the

9

Court's words, judicial participation.

10

The Court said the

What we're dealing with here is the management

11

of parks, where I think the story is reversed, and when

12

you're dealing with whether a particular use is

13

appropriate for this area of the park with this

14

infrastructure, this is the kind of park district has

15

superior competence with, and there's really no reason to

16

insist, as the Court did on judicial --

17

QUESTION:

Does the same problem get injected by

18

the exception clause in the ordinance, that in fact they

19

can waive conditions if there would be a First Amendment

20

violation?

21

MR. STRAUSS:

Justice Souter, that clause, two

22

things about that clause are salient, I think.

First,

23

that clause only comes into play, the clause that provides

24

that we shall waive certain fees when someone is engaged

25

in First Amendment activity and otherwise couldn't hold

36
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the event if we didn't waive the fees, that only comes

2

into play if someone applies for a waiver, so we're in a

3

situation where someone has come to us in order to seek

4

this dispensation, has told us we're engaging in

5

expressive activity, and the second thing --

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. STRAUSS:

8
9

Which happened here.
Which happened here.

In one

instance he got his dispensation.
The other thing is, we feel we have to have that

10

in there because of suggestions in this Court's opinions

11

in Murdock and Forsyth County that there might be a

12

constitutional issue if we charge more than a nominal fee.

13
14
15

QUESTION:

And the third distinction that you

want to rely on?
MR. STRAUSS:

The third distinction, Justice

16

Souter, is that in the Freedman context the Court had

17

indicated a strong preference for after-the-fact

18

regulation, that if the -- if a community is concerned

19

about obscenity, the way to regulate that is by after-

20

the-fact criminal prohibitions.

21

Prior restraints are strongly disfavored and be

22

allowed only in narrowly hedged circumstances, but the

23

Court has never suggested that when it comes to managing

24

parks, the preferred way to do it is somehow by allowing

25

people to do what they will and then punish people after

37
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the fact who have done the wrong thing, who have conducted

2

an event in a way that conflicted with another event.
QUESTION:

3

Mr. Strauss, you've ably

4

distinguished Freedman, but do you think that none of the

5

procedural safeguards that were involved in Freedman are

6

applicable here, starting with the basics, the

7

administrator has to have some time limits to act on these

8

petitions to hold events?
MR. STRAUSS:

9

Justice Ginsburg, I would put that

10

part of Freedman in a different category.

11

the requirement that the administrator act within a

12

specified period is a corollary of the rule that the

13

administrator cannot have unlimited discretion over

14

whether to grant or deny.

15

over whether to grant is a problem, unlimited discretion

16

over when to grant is a problem.
QUESTION:

17

I think that

Just as unlimited discretion

I think there's considerable merit,

18

what you have just said, although at the end of the brief

19

you make the final argument that this is really not a

20

speech statute anyway.

21

think we could write an opinion to say that neutral

22

standards are not necessary?
MR. STRAUSS:

23

Am I to infer from that that you

Yes.

That was going to be the

24

second part of my answer to Justice Ginsburg, Justice

25

Kennedy.

That is our position.

Our claim does not hinge

38
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

on that.

The Court could disagree with us on that and

2

still rule in our favor in this case, but it is our

3

position that because this statute applies, this ordinance

4

applies so broadly to such a wide range of conduct, much

5

of which, most of which is not expressive, that it really

6

should be viewed as more like a business license, or a

7

building permit, which, of course --

8

QUESTION:

Or a zoning ordinance.

9

MR. STRAUSS:

Or a zoning permit, variance of

10

some kind, which, of course, apply to expressive

11

activities, but to a lot of other activities, too.
QUESTION:

12
13

The easy way to answer that argument

is to say we've never done this with reference to parks.
MR. STRAUSS:

14

Well, that's right, Justice

15

Kennedy, but as some of the questions from the Court

16

suggested during my colleague's argument, because these

17

are parks, perhaps the Government has more leeway than it

18

would have in telling people what they can do on their own

19

property.

20

I understand that on the other hand they are

21

public forums, and I am not sure how that -- whether those

22

arguments cancel out, but it seems to me the crucial fact

23

here is that the park district is not only not engaged in

24

the business of censoring speech, it is at the far extreme

25

from that, and it is regulating conduct because it affects

39
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the infrastructure of the parks, and uses of the parks,

2

and much of this conduct is in no obvious way expressive,

3

and in our view that seems to make it more like a business

4

license.

5

QUESTION:

But you did say that you feel some

6

compulsion from the First Amendment to have to make a

7

decision within a set time to guard against abuse of

8

discretion.

9

avenue for judicial review after we get through with your

10
11

You said that.

How about, need there be any

park administrator?
MR. STRAUSS:

Justice Ginsburg, I think -- well,

12

for anyone claiming a violation of a constitutional right,

13

there should be an avenue for prompt judicial review, and

14

further, I think that part of Freedman is intended to deal

15

with that situation like that present in some of this

16

Court's cases, in FW/PBS and in Shuttlesworth in

17

particular, a situation where the applicant can't be quite

18

sure when the permit's been denied, so the applicant

19

doesn't quite know when it's okay to go to court.

20

That was what happened in Shuttlesworth, and I

21

think that troubled the Court, and I think that's the idea

22

that when the Court said in FW/PBS there must be an avenue

23

for prompt judicial review, that's what the Court had in

24

mind, that the permitting scheme cannot be set up in such

25

a way that whenever -- when the applicant goes to Court

40
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

It can also be

I suppose the very fact that you have

10

those provisions in means it's a little different from the

11

ordinary zoning ordinance or business license, because

12

those are all motivated by First Amendment concerns, I

13

assume.

14

May I ask you, how would you -- I understand

15

your basic position, but are you saying that this is not a

16

prior restraint, or that it's a permissible prior

17

restraint?

18

MR. STRAUSS:

19

QUESTION:

20

(Laughter.)

21

MR. STRAUSS:

22

wouldn't want to duck the issue.

23

terminological issue, which I guess is different from

24

ducking it.

25

Well, Justice --

Or are you just ducking the issue?

No, Justice Stevens, I don't -- I
I'd want to say it was a

I think it's misleading to characterize it as a

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

prior restraint.

2

technical definitional way in which yes, it is a prior

3

restraint, but it really has none of the characteristics

4

that have caused the Court to subject prior restraints to

5

the presumption of unconstitutionality.

6

As Justice Kennedy said, there were some

In particular, as I said to Justice Souter, this

7

isn't an area in which the Court has said the preferred

8

way of regulating is by after-the-fact criminal

9

punishments.

The Court has always recognized that what

10

common sense tells us, that this an area where you really

11

do need before-the-fact guidance, or at least before-the-

12

fact guidance is acceptable.

13

That, combined with the fact that it's not a

14

content-based -- not only not a content-based scheme, not

15

a content-based scheme that even refers to expression at

16

all, I think gives it none of the characteristics that

17

have troubled the Court about prior restraints, so in

18

light of that, whether it is technically called not a

19

prior restraint, or a valid prior restraint, I think

20

really is a terminological point.

21

QUESTION:

So if something like this is to be

22

considered valid, what are the limits to make it

23

reasonable as a regulation?

24

prompt action should be required, perhaps, by the park.

25

Do you agree with that?

MR. STRAUSS:

Everything is on the paper

Justice Ginsburg, my reading of

14

the Illinois cases is that that's not true even in State

15

court and, of course, the applicant has the option of

16

going to the Federal court.

17

My reading of the Illinois cases is that you can

18

join a claim for equitable relief with the common law

19

certiorari, which is the Illinois way of reviewing

20

administrative proceedings, and you can certainly -- it's

21

clear you could join a 198 -- a State court in a 1983

22

action, and that would allow you to conduct full

23

discovery.

24
25

But I guess my more fundamental answer to your
question, Justice Ginsburg, is, it seems odd in this case

43
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

to speculate about the adequacy of Illinois procedures

2

when petitioner has not invoked them, and has not

3

complained about the adequacy of the Federal proceedings

4

that he has invoked, that the place to decide whether

5

Illinois provides adequate proceedings would be in a case

6

where someone invokes them, and the Court then sees what

7

the Illinois courts are prepared to do in cases of this

8

kind.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN

13

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

14

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT

15
16
17

MR. FELDMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
It's our position that the park district's

18

ordinance satisfies the First Amendment standards and the

19

judgment of the court of appeals should be affirmed.

20

QUESTION:

Do you think we should view it as Mr.

21

Strauss urges, as a zoning ordinance, or a business

22

license, or as some kind of content-neutral time, place,

23

and manner restriction?

24
25

MR. FELDMAN:
a public forum.

I think more the latter.

This is

There was a finding -- there may be other

44
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Government property that wouldn't fall within that

2

category, but it is a public forum, and restrictions on

3

speech in a public forum are subject to the First

4

Amendment, but the restriction in this ordinance, the

5

relevant restrictions are that the discretion that has to

6

be -- that may be exercised by the administrative body

7

can't be unfettered, but on the other hand, total

8

precision is not required, and I think, as Mr. Strauss

9

explained, there are 13 specified grounds under which a

10

permit may be denied here, and those are the only grounds

11

under which it may be denied, and I think that's adequate

12

guidance for whatever discretion or flexibility would be

13

in the system. And indeed, some flexibility is necessary

14

in a system where you re trying to accommodate competing

15

users and where the alternative, as the Court of Appeals

16

said, if you allowed no flexibility at all, would be even

17

a minor or technical violation of one of those criteria,

18

would have to lead to a denial of a permit, which would

19

mean a lot fewer people using the park, both for speech

20

and for nonspeech purposes.
QUESTION:

21

It would make it a lot fairer,

22

wouldn't it?

23

don't.

24

What's the matter with that?

25

I mean, you either meet the criteria, or you

If you don't meet them, you don't get a permit.

MR. FELDMAN:

The problem would be exactly the

45
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

kind of thing that Mr. Strauss described, is that if there

2

is a minor -- if you put in your permit application

3

slightly too late, or there was a stray mark on your

4

application, requiring total strictness on any of these

5

criteria would just mean that people who really should be

6

entitled to have the opportunity to speak -QUESTION:

7

Well, they didn't follow the rules.

8

I mean, you're giving enormous discretion to the city.

9

They don't have discretion to deny, but among those that

10

are deniable, they can allow some in and not allow others

11

in.

12

MR. FELDMAN:

13

QUESTION:

But I think --

Why don't you just say, these are the

14

rules, if you come in late, you haven't complied with the

15

rules, period.

16

That's very fair.

MR. FELDMAN:

I think as Mr. Strauss -- I think

17

it was Mr. Strauss said, the -- whatever the flexibility

18

or discretion that remains in a system like this would

19

be -- has to be exercised in accordance with those grounds

20

for denial.

21

and I think those are the only things the park district is

22

supposed to be taking into account in deciding whether to

23

grant or deny a permit, and -- but you can --

24
25

Those are the only grounds that are listed,

QUESTION:

How do you say it doesn't frustrate

the purpose of the provision which says, you know, the

46
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

thing has to be in, you know, 2 weeks beforehand, if you

2

get it in 1 week beforehand?

3

that doesn't frustrate the purpose of the provision?

4

purpose is to give you 2 weeks to consider it.
MR. FELDMAN:

5

How can you possibly say
The

Right, but I think -- well, it

6

could well be that the purpose is to make sure that the

7

park district can guarantee it can consider it, but if

8

they -- if it comes in on a day, 1 day late but there's

9

nothing else on top of it that they're waiting to

10

consider, if it's in the wintertime when they have very

11

few permit applications, they can get to it anyhow, and

12

there's no reason for them not to permit that use of the

13

park.

In any event, that's -QUESTION:

14

Even apart from that, I assume

15

there's no way to write a regulation that is not going to

16

require some judgment, some discretion.

17

material in the falsehood, what is the conflict in the

18

uses?

19

degree of flexibility that is implied in applying concepts

20

like that.

21

I mean, what's

I don't suppose you can eliminate that degree, the

MR. FELDMAN:

I think that's right, and I think

22

a crucial feature of this requirement is that, of the

23

ordinance here is that the parks are used for multiple

24

uses by multiple people.

25

preserving the park's own facilities so that people who

There's a concern with

1

will use the same place in the future will have that

2

available to them, and there has to be some availability

3

to accommodate all of that in the normal, in an ordinary

4

administrative scheme, and I think this scheme is well-

5

drawn, and if there are further difficulties with it, they

6

can be challenged on an as-applied basis.

7

One thing the park district can't do is make its

8

decisions based on favoring or disfavoring particular

9

kinds of speech.

10

QUESTION:

Would it be --

11

MR. FELDMAN:

That should be addressed on an as-

12

applied basis, and I think it could be in the State court

13

proceedings, or in a 1983 proceeding.

14

QUESTION:

Along the lines of Justice Scalia's

15

question, would it be proper for a city council or

16

municipality to draft an ordinance just like this one and

17

then at the end saying, the commissioner of parks, in his

18

sole discretion, may waive any or all of the foregoing

19

requirements?

20

MR. FELDMAN:

I think the -- the only

21

difficulty -- it would depend on what that meant.

If it

22

said, in his sole discretion meant he may consider

23

anything he -- anything, I think that would be -- that

24

would probably be a problem, but if it meant, considering

25

the factors that are the legitimate factors on whether

48
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

someone should use the park, which are the ones that are

2

set out in the criteria, in the ordinance, I think it

3

would be actually similar to what the ordinance is.

4

QUESTION:

Well, we've said in a case like

5

Forsyth that discretion has to have some definition and

6

some control to it, and if you have at the end an absolute

7

waiver provision, it seems to me that would contradict

8

that.
MR. FELDMAN:

9

Oh, I think -- well, I think

10

that's right.

11

notwithstanding what we've just said, the commissioner has

12

absolute discretion, I think that that would be correct,

13

and that would pose a problem under Forsyth and the other

14

cases that have said that you can't have that kind of

15

unfettered discretion.
This is a guided -- this is a statute that has

16
17

If the meaning of that provision is that

quite limited and guided -QUESTION:

18

Well, how do we know that?

Where

19

does it say that the may, the may grant anyway is limited

20

to those applications that generally meet the purposes of

21

the -- where does it say that?

22

for it?

23

MR. FELDMAN:

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. FELDMAN:

Do we just take your word

Well --

Or the park district's word for it?
I think that that would at least

49
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

be the most reasonable construction of an ordinance like

2

this, where there's attempt to detail these 13 specific

3

criteria quite specifically, and there's no suggestion

4

that there's any other basis on which the park district

5

can act, and I think that that's just the most reasonable

6

interpretation of this kind of ordinance.
And again on a facial as-applied -- one

7
8

difficulty with a facial challenge to an ordinance like

9

this is, you don't want to construe it in such a way as to

10

intentionally render it unconstitutional and therefore

11

limit the ability of the park district to make its

12

facilities open, to have a permit scheme that really makes

13

its facilities open to all.
QUESTION:

14

Mr. Feldman, do the Federal

15

regulations for the use of Federal parks, the use of the

16

Mall, do they differ with respect to the may deny?
MR. FELDMAN:

17
18

similar.

19

differently --

They're -- well, they're very

The specific criteria are different, and are

QUESTION:

20

No.

But there is the may deny, implying

21

there are cases where, although you could, you don't have

22

to deny?

MR. FELDMAN:

24

25

That's correct.

And no criteria for the waiver in the

Federal scheme either?

MR. FELDMAN:

No, and the way those have

2

consistently been applied is, those are the grounds that

3

are to be considered in determining whether you can grant

4

a permit, and there aren't other grounds on which a permit

5

would be denied.

6

Now, there -- the only other -- but actually, in

7

the Federal scheme at least, and probably here, too, some

8

types of other -- some types of considerations can be

9

considered.

For example, if someone has a particular

10

facility that would be particularly good for one use, if

11

someone wants to hold a rally on a baseball field, someone

12

else wants to have a baseball game there, I think they can

13

say, well, you have the baseball game on the baseball

14

field, and you have your rally at another location, and

15

there is some of that that goes on in proposing different

16

particular locales so as to accommodate all of the

17

different users who want to use the park.
QUESTION:

18
19

And is there a first come, first

serve rule?
MR. FELDMAN:

20

Basically, yes.

If you satisfy

21

the other requirements of the rule, it's basically similar

22

to this.

23

served rule under the National Park Service parks here in

24

Washington like this has to do with the date of the

25

application, not the date on which it's processed.

It's subject to -- the actual first come, first

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD L. WILSON

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. WILSON:

7

Thank you, Mr. Feldman.

Justice O'Connor, I'd like to

8

address quickly two points that you raised.

First,

9

there's no meaningful administrative procedure.

There is

10

no mechanism.

11

your permit was denied, and they read off the violations.

12

You send a letter back and say, I did not do any of that,

13

and they say, oh, yes, you did, denied.

14

it.

15

made the allegations.

16

They send you a letter telling you that

There is no hearing.

That's the end of

You don't even get to know who

Secondly, in your inquiry as to judicial review,

17

this Court unanimously provided us with a crystal clear

18

definition of prompt judicial review.

19

mystery in the Federal circuits.

20

opinion, Blunt v. Rizzi, written by the same Justice who

21

wrote Freedman, and on a Court that contains six of the

22

justices who participated in Freedman, Blunt defined

23

prompt judicial review as follows:

24
25

There should be no

Another unanimous

A final judicial determination on the merits
within a specified brief period.

That was in 1971, so

1

there should have been no mystery from the plurality of

2

opinion in FW/PBS, because that plurality opinion did not

3

say, there must be the availability of judicial review.

4

That opinion said, there must be availability of prompt

5

judicial review --

QUESTION:

Mr. Wilson, what does that mean if

7

you pick the Federal court, that Illinois is going to

8

write a statute that says, and if you choose to come to

9

the Federal court rather than the State court, the Federal

10

court is going to have X number of days to decide it?
MR. WILSON:

11

Justice Ginsburg, that would be the

12

choice of the park district of the City of Chicago,

13

because the park district is the party that has to go to

14

court to seek -QUESTION:

15

Oh, if you're -- but that's not what

16

Justice O'Connor said in her case.

17

last part of Freedman.
MR. WILSON:

18

She didn't take that

But there's certainly a distinction

19

between those businesses that Justice O'Connor was writing

20

about in FW/PBS and a core political speech.
QUESTION:

21

Well, suppose we reject your notion

22

that the scheme is invalid unless the park goes to court,

23

and the court has a tight time line?

24

that?

25

MR. WILSON:

Suppose we reject

I would then say, Justice Ginsburg,

that this Court has elevated the kind of sexually explicit

2

speech in that case above the core political speech in

this case, based on the context of the speech, which would

fly in the face of --
