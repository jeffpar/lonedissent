ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. ROBERTS, JR.

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. ROBERTS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
ERISA preemption cases can be exceedingly

12

complicated, but our submission this morning is

13

straightforward.

14

ERISA's civil enforcement provisions were the exclusive

15

remedy for improper processing of a claim for benefits

16

under an ERISA-regulated plan.

17

external review law at issue in this case affords a

18

different remedy for a beneficiary dissatisfied with an

19

HMO's denial of benefits.

20

preempted.

21

This Court held in Pilot Life that

The Illinois independent

The Illinois law is therefore

Just last week, in Great West Life, this Court

22

began its analysis by noting that it was especially

23

reluctant to tamper with ERISA's enforcement scheme, and

24

by quoting prior precedent for the proposition that that

25

enforcement scheme indicated that Congress did not intend

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

to authorize other remedies that it forgot to incorporate

2

expressly.

3

was quoted 15 years ago in Pilot Life.

4

are exclusive, whether we're talking about additional

5

Federal remedies or additional State remedies.

6

That same language, quoted in Great West Life,

QUESTION:

ERISA's remedies

Mr. Roberts, could you help me with

7

one part of the facts I'm a little puzzled about?

Your

8

opponents argue there's a difference between the plan and

9

the HMO, and that he claims that you -- what you say would

10

apply to a suit against the plan, but this is a suit

11

against the HMO, and I have been unable to find the plan

12

in the papers.

Is the plan in the record?

MR. ROBERTS:

13

The respondent alleged in the

14

complaint, joint appendix page 32 and 38, that the

15

certificate of coverage was the plan, and that is in the

16

record.

QUESTION:

17
18

It is Exhibit A to the complaint.
The certificate of coverage -- who

are the parties to the certificate of coverage?
MR. ROBERTS:

19

The certificate of coverage is an

20

agreement between the HMO and the employer that extends to

21

particular employees the benefits that are set forth

22

there.

23

QUESTION:

And in your view, you say -- are they

24

just hooked by their allegation, or do you think it's

25

clear that that is the correct -- that is the plan?

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. ROBERTS:

I think they're first bound by

2

their allegation, but second of all, even if other

3

documents also contribute terms to the plan, certainly the

4

certificate of coverage indicates elements of the plan.

5

There may be other documents that set forth other terms of

6

the plan.

7

QUESTION:

You see, they say that's an insurance

8

policy that is purchased by the plan, in effect.

9

That's -- and that therefore there's a distinction between

10

the plan and the insurance policy, and I know you

11

disagree.

12

is there -- explain to me why that's totally wrong.

13

You say the HMO is not an insurance policy, but

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, it's totally wrong because

14

the question is not how the State law operates to grant a

15

new remedy to a beneficiary.

16

whether it operates on the insurance policy or whether it

17

operates on the plan.

18

it provides beneficiaries, under an ERISA-regulated plan,

19

with a new remedy, and that remedy is one that's not

20

granted by Congress in ERISA, and the Court in Pilot Life

21

said only the remedies that are granted are available.

22

QUESTION:

We think it's irrelevant

The point is, however it operates,

Of course, one could also say it's

23

not really a new remedy, it's a new protection, sort of

24

like the -- see, the question is whether Pilot Life

25

controls or the Massachusetts case controls.

It's an

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

interesting -- whether it's something like a compelled

2

benefit or a compelled protection of some kind --

3

MR. ROBERTS:

4

QUESTION:

5

Right.

-- that the insurance company

provides.

6

MR. ROBERTS:

Yes, and I think the difference

7

is, between mandated benefits laws like Massachusetts,

8

those laws provide, as this Court said in UNUM, a rule of

9

decision that is to be applied by whoever the decision-

10

maker is in reviewing a denial of benefits.
Here, it's not a new rule of decision, it's a

11
12

new decision-maker, and that decision-maker isn't looking

13

to State law to say, well, they've given you mental health

14

coverage and so that has to be provided, he's deciding

15

what -- whether the denial of benefits was proper or not,

16

and that can only be characterized as a remedy, whether

17

it's --

18
19

QUESTION:

Well -- no, I didn't mean to

interrupt.

20

Isn't the problem that he's doing two things?

21

The decision that he makes is necessarily going to have

22

its consequence on whether the benefit denial was correct

23

or not, but he's also making a medical kind of decision,

24

is, in fact, this reasonable medical practice, and so he's

25

not merely in the position which a court is in when a

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

court says, does the evidence show this is reasonable

2

medical practice.

3

making a kind of practice decision which doctors, as

4

doctors, make, so it's somewhere in between.

5

He's in the decision of, in effect,

MR. ROBERTS:

We don't think that's a correct

6

characterization.

7

component in this decision.

8

issue in this independent external review is coverage, for

9

a number of reasons.

First of all, the treatment had

10

already taken place.

There was no question of treatment.

11

But coverage is all that Rush HMO has undertaken to

12

provide.

13

provide -- it agrees to pay for health care.

The only thing that is at

It does not provide health care.

QUESTION:

14

There is no element of a treatment

It doesn't

Well, this particular -- I'm assuming

15

in answer to your -- from your answer to Justice Stevens,

16

I'm assuming that in this case it is so, but their

17

argument is, you can have HMO's that have nothing to do

18

with ERISA plans, and you can have ERISA plans that don't

19

employ HMO's to provide welfare benefits, and therefore

20

it's appropriate to think of this as a medical decision or

21

as a regulation of medical practice in a particular form,

22

rather than insurance, so once again there's -- the

23

problem is that the facts do not place this in a clear

24

category.

25

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, I -- with respect, I think

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the facts do place this in a very clear category, because

2

there's no question of treatment at issue.

3

State is purporting to articulate its definition of

4

medical necessity, that's not the question.

5

is, is this beneficiary entitled to benefits under this

6

plan, and the judgment about what is medically necessary

7

is something that is addressed in the plan.

8

provides the broadest possible discretion to the HMO to

9

interpret the plan terms, including medical necessity.

10

QUESTION:

Even if the

The question

The plan

Well, but what if the State law in

11

effect tinkered with how you interpret the plan, and

12

spelled out that in determining what's medically necessary

13

the plan will make use of an independent medical

14

consultant.

15

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, the State law can define

16

medical necessity.

17

benefit, saying you have to --

18

QUESTION:

I think that's just like a mandated

And can it not say, and furthermore,

19

if there's any dispute you will use an independent medical

20

consultant?

21

MR. ROBERTS:

That it cannot do consistent with

22

Pilot Life, because that is a remedy for a denial of

23

benefits, and Pilot Life indicated --

24
25

QUESTION:

Well, not necessarily.

It may be

more a definition in the plan, or a provision of the

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

insurance plan itself, and then that in turn is

2

enforceable under section 502.

3

MR. ROBERTS:

4

QUESTION:

Well, that's --

I mean, that's the argument, and I

5

can understand that that, you could view it through that

6

lens, could you not?

7

MR. ROBERTS:

And I think, as Judge Posner

8

pointed out in his dissent, if you do that, then all bets

9

are off.

If you say that this is incorporated by State

10

law into your plan, and so when you enforce that remedy,

11

all you're doing is enforcing a term of the plan --

12

QUESTION:

Well, is that so surprising, in light

13

of the fact that the ERISA law itself excludes regulations

14

of insurance?

15

coverage, in effect.

16

The law itself took that out of ERISA

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, now that was the specific

17

question addressed in Pilot Life.

18

lifting in the Pilot Life opinion was reconciling the

19

exclusivity of the civil remedies and the Saving Clause.

20

You can look at it one of two ways.

21

Savings Clause full force, then the remedies aren't going

22

to be exclusive in a case involving an insurer.

23

give the exclusivity of ERISA's remedies full force, then

24

the Savings Clause is relegated to a lower status, and --

25

QUESTION:

That was -- the heavy

If you give the

If you

Well, we had a case, U-N-U-M v. Ward,

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

and held that any statute that effectively creates a

2

mandatory contract term and regulates only insurance

3

companies is an insurance law under the Savings Clause.

4

MR. ROBERTS:

UNUM did not involve a remedy.

It

5

said, the question under Pilot Life and 502 was, quote,

6

not implicated, because it wasn't a State remedy that they

7

were trying to save under the insurance Savings Clause.

8

It was a rule of decision.

9

decision.

This is not a rule of

It's a different decision-maker, and if this

10

type of State law remedy is allowed, then there's nothing

11

left --

12

QUESTION:

But UNUM --

13

QUESTION:

But Mr. Roberts, can --

14

QUESTION:

-- wasn't a procedural ruling.

UNUM

15

was a question of how late could you file, and the State

16

law said you could file late, and --

17

MR. ROBERTS:

18

QUESTION:

The law --

-- why should that be treated

19

differently?

20

the beneficiary a chance to collect that the plan itself

21

would not have given.

22

The State is making something timely, giving

MR. ROBERTS:

I think that's correct.

I -- the

23

line is not -- and this is what UNUM taught.

The line is

24

not between substance and procedure when you're talking

25

about mandated coverage.

That's not the line we're

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

advocating.

2

coverage, what does term, what does the plan have to

3

provide, and UNUM said, one thing it has to provide,

4

whatever the coverage is, coverage for those claims that

5

are filed in a timely manner, or, if not, that did not

6

prejudice the insurer.

7

The line we're advocating is between mandated

This is different.
It's a remedy.

This is not a new term of

8

coverage.

If you don't like what the HMO

9

has done with your benefits claim, you get to go to a

10

State law, independent external reviewer, and get it

11

overturned, and -QUESTION:

12
13

But it's a different kind of remedy

than saying, for example, punitive damages.

14

MR. ROBERTS:

15

QUESTION:

16

It's --

It --

And I thought that's what Pilot Life

was about.
MR. ROBERTS:

17

The argument is made that this is

18

okay because all you get are the benefits that you're

19

entitled to under the plan. We think that the Taylor

20

decision, decided the same day as Pilot Life, rejects that

21

argument.

22

for the benefits due under the plan, not punitive damages,

23

not emotional distress, the plan benefits, and the Court

24

said, that's not only preemptive, that's completely

25

preemptive.

It says that one of the claims in that case was

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

ERISA preempts not only different remedies, but
alternative, additional remedies.

3

QUESTION:

Well, under your theory there could

4

be no private arbitration agreement by an HMO plan and

5

people covered by the plan?

6
7

MR. ROBERTS:
open question.

8
9
10

No.

I think that's certainly an

The issue there would be --

QUESTION:

I don't see how it's open under your

view.
MR. ROBERTS:

Arbitration -- it's the difference

11

between a voluntary agreement between parties, which is

12

what ERISA seeks to enforce, and something that's

13

compelled by State law.

14

General draws to the collective bargaining --

15

QUESTION:

The analogy that the Solicitor

But under your rationale, 502

16

controls. It's a remedy.

17

to arbitrate survive under your theory?

18
19
20
21
22

MR. ROBERTS:

So how could a private agreement

Well, it would survive because it

would be regarded as an internal plan procedure, not -QUESTION:

But wouldn't it also conflict --

wouldn't it also conflict with the statutory provision?
MR. ROBERTS:

No.

No.

I mean, the -- ERISA

23

allows internal remedies, appeals within the plan, and

24

again it's an open question, but we don't dispute that the

25

arbitration would be allowed.

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

The problem with the analogy to the arbitration

2

cases is that the Solicitor General stops too early.

3

you can have voluntary arbitration, even where remedies

4

are preempted, but surely a State law that directed that

5

parties to a collective bargaining agreement must

6

arbitrate, and here's how they must arbitrate, would be

7

preempted by the Labor Management Relations Act.

8
9

Yes,

If you pursue the analogy to a situation that's
comparable to this case, the conclusion that there's

10

preemption seems to follow inexorably, and the idea that

11

everything is all right because at the end of the day you

12

have to enforce this in a section 502 action really makes

13

a hollow shell out of Pilot Life.

14

enforce arbitration in court, but we still think of

15

arbitration as a different remedy.

16

judicial remedy because it has to be enforced.

17

QUESTION:

You have to sometimes

We don't say, that's a

Yes, but there's another difference

18

with Pilot Life, and that, the only question is whether it

19

related to the insurance.

20

it's related, but then you get onto the second ball game

21

of whether it's a change in the insurance coverage, and

22

one can look at this, I think -- I just need -- I want you

23

to comment on this -- as not changing a term of the plan,

24

but, rather, changing a term of the insurance policy

25

purchased by the plan.

Here, you have -- you admit

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. ROBERTS:

And we actually go on to the third

2

game which is, if it conflicts with the substantive term

3

of ERISA, and this is what Pilot Life held, it is

4

preempted, and this conflicts with the exclusivity of the

5

remedies.

6

We don't believe, when you go through the usual

7

insurance Savings Clause factors, that this is the

8

regulation of insurance, but what Pilot Life held, and

9

this was the important part of the decision, which was

10

unanimous, is that when you look at the Savings Clause you

11

have to be informed by an understanding of what Congress

12

was trying to do with the exclusive remedies, that the

13

most important -- quote, most important consideration in

14

deciding whether that remedy in that case is covered by

15

the Savings Clause was that Congress said that all the

16

remedies were exclusive.

17

back door of the Savings Clause, then that exclusivity is

18

going to be completely undermined.

19

that's here before the Court.

20

QUESTION:

If you allow them back into this

That's the issue

That is -- I'd like to expand just a

21

little, because I'm actually trying to work out what's the

22

framework within which we think of this, and I had thought

23

that that part of Pilot Life was really part of the reason

24

for interpreting the Savings Clause as it was there

25

interpreted, that normally what you do is ask the first

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

question, is this preempted in the first place, and it is

2

if there's field preemption, if there's conflict

3

preemption, and maybe, with ERISA, if there's something

4

more, and ordinarily, if there is such a conflict, the

5

Federal side wins, but the whole point of the Savings

6

Clause is to say, if there's a conflict in respect to

7

insurance, the State wins.

8

Stop right there.

But then maybe Pilot Life adds something else,

9

which says, but it couldn't just say if there's a conflict

10

that brought you into preemption in the first place, well,

11

the Federal Government wins, because that would be to

12

eviscerate the meaning of the Savings Clause.

13

the framework in my mind, and I'd appreciate anything you

14

could help with that.

15

MR. ROBERTS:

Now, that's

And again, that poses sort of a

16

conflict between what the Court in Pilot Life said were

17

the exclusive remedies and the Savings Clause.

18

what this Court unanimously decided 15 years ago in Pilot

19

Life when it said, when we look at the Savings Clause, the

20

most important thing -- most important thing -- is to keep

21

in mind the remedies are supposed to be exclusive, so that

22

if this is a remedy, it is a regulation of ERISA, it is

23

not the regulation of insurance, and the Court reaffirmed

24

that approach in the John Hancock case where it said, and

25

I'll just quote one sentence, no decision of this Court

That is

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

has applied the Savings Clause to supersede the provision

2

in ERISA itself.

3

If you apply the Savings Clause to allow this

4

State law remedy to be applied, that would be superseding

5

what this Court said section 502 of ERISA meant in Pilot

6

Life, which was that these remedies are exclusive.

7

question was addressed.

8

again, that was the hard part of the opinion in Pilot

9

Life, and that was reaffirmed in John Hancock, and --

10

QUESTION:

That

That was -- and I'll say it

I see that.

Then I'd think what

11

you're saying, I take it, is at least where the conflict

12

is particularly severe, it's perhaps not -- the State

13

doesn't necessarily win, and you think this is a

14

particularly bad one.

15

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, I do think it's particularly

16

bad, but I don't think it has to be.

17

law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment of the

18

Federal objectives, it is preempted.

19

objective requires exclusivity with respect to remedies.

20

This obviously stands as an obstacle to that objective and

21

so is preempted.

22

I think if the State

The Federal

Now, they say it's saved because the last stop

23

in this State law remedy is a quick dash into Federal

24

court to get a stamp that says, enforce.

25

says, if the reviewer says you've got to provide this, the

The State law

16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

HMO has to provide it, and they say, well, that's okay,

2

because we run into Federal court, we make this a 502

3

action.

4

Well, that makes Pilot Life ridiculous, because

5

it says every type of remedy is okay so long as the last

6

stop is a quick visit to the Federal courthouse.

7

raises very serious Article III concerns, because Federal

8

courts are not supposed to be looking at decisions made

9

by -- made under State law that they have no authority to

10

review and simply rubber-stamping them, and it gives rise

11

to the bizarre results that the respondent and the

12

Solicitor General support in this case that an action to

13

enforce section 4-10 is completely preempted so that

14

there's jurisdiction, but then it turns out section 4-10

15

is not preempted at all.

16

but they have to maintain --

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. ROBERTS:

That's a very curious result,

What is section 4-10, Mr. Roberts?
4-10 is the State law, of the

19

Illinois HMO act.

20

independent external review law.

21

but --

2

MR. ROBERTS:

What is absurd is that they have

3

to maintain that this can only be enforced under a 502

4

action, that the State law claim -- keep in mind this

5

began, of course, as a State law claim in State court.

6

502 wasn't mentioned at all.

7

502 action, they said because it's completely preempted,

8

but the underlying remedy that's being enforced isn't

9

preempted at all.

10

It was recharacterized as a

Now, those are two different questions,

11

jurisdiction and substance, but it does seem odd that if

12

you're going in and all you're doing is getting a rubber

13

stamp from the Federal courthouse saying, enforced, that

14

that's completely preempted, when the law isn't preempted

15

at all.
QUESTION:

16

Well, what they're -- it's not

17

absurd, in their view, anyway, because they're saying they

18

have a human being over here called an arbitrator and this

19

human being tells you what the benefit is, and what your

20

clients are really objecting to, frankly, is not this

21

remedy.

22

They couldn't care less.
What they're worried about is that that human

23

being called the arbitrator is going to say that this

24

woman has to have a certain treatment that otherwise in

25

their view she wouldn't have to have.

I mean, just

imagine the statute that said, instead of what it says,

2

that you have to provide medical treatment whenever

3

there's a 25-percent chance of improvement.

4

at all in that one, and they'll be even more excited, and

5

indeed, it doesn't take away the Federal remedy in my

6

hypothetical, nor does it in this one.

7

that we know who's going to win.

8

MR. ROBERTS:

No arbitrator

It just turns out

Well, that's because there's a

9

different decision-maker making the decision on your claim

10

for the denial of benefits, and that's what makes it clear

11

that what's involved is a different remedy.
It's also a remedy that changes dramatically

12
13

what the plan actually provides, and it does that by

14

taking away from the plan fiduciary the deference that the

15

fiduciary -QUESTION:

his powers of review and so forth, in the record anywhere?

MR. ROBERTS:

QUESTION:

I'm sorry, the --

The -- you two or three times refer

20

to the fact that the plan gives the fiduciary this

21

standard of review.

Is that in the record?

MR. ROBERTS:

22

No.

The only elements of the plan

23

that are in the record is the certificate of coverage,

24

which --

7

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, that's what the law

provides.
QUESTION:

I mean, maybe the plan says that,

too, for all I know.
MR. ROBERTS:

No, because the elements of the

8

plan that are in the record, the certificate of coverage,

9

notes that the HMO has the broadest possible discretion to

10

interpret the terms of the plan in deciding coverage and,

11

under this Court's decision in Firestone --

12

QUESTION:

It says that in the certificate?

13

MR. ROBERTS:

Yes, and -- pages 7 and pages 8.

14

It's Exhibit A to the complaint -- and under this Court's

15

decision in Firestone, that means that that decision is

16

subject to a deferential review.

17

The State law changes that, and the State law

18

gives the decision to the independent external reviewer,

19

who makes his decision apparently de novo, so that the

20

precise thing that the plan participants, parties

21

contracted against, the recognition that this medical

22

necessity is a question of judgment, some people are going

23

to view it differently, we want to make clear that it's

24

our discretion that controls, and that gives us

25

entitlement to deferential review --

Mr. Roberts, some close to 40 States

have laws like this?

3

MR. ROBERTS:

4

QUESTION:

5
6

Yes.

And there's legislation introduced,

at least in Congress, to accomplish what?
MR. ROBERTS:

My understanding of many of the

7

pending bills is that they have an external review

8

provision but, of course, it's a Federal one, and that is

9

consistent with ERISA's goal of uniformity in claims

10

processing and administration.

Do you know anything about the status

12

of that pending legislation?

13

MR. ROBERTS:

MR. ROBERTS:

No.

No.
Other than at various times

16

passage is imminent, and then it falls apart, but again

17

it's a very different thing to say, this is the uniform

18

Federal remedy, and to have, as Your Honor points out, 40

19

different remedies, if you're running a company that has a

20

health care plan with operations in different States, the

21

health plan can't be uniformly --

QUESTION:

Are most of the State law provisions

23

similar to the one in Illinois?

MR. ROBERTS:

25

They all have differences.

For

Why is that a more disturbing change

than changes in what is the minimum required coverage?
MR. ROBERTS:

Well, I don't know that it's more

disturbing.

11

can be greater if the State law says, you must provide

12

mental health coverage, this, this, and this, but then at

13

least the employer looking at it knows what's at stake,

14

and he knows that the remedy is going to be the remedy

15

that is provided under Federal law, which is that they're

16

going to enforce what I have agreed to provide under this

17

plan, even if what I've agreed to provide is compelled by

It's different, yes.

QUESTION:

22

Those are two very different remedies,

23

would you just give me a moment of your views on whether

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL P. ALBERS

10
11

Very well, Mr. Roberts.

MR. ALBERS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

12

Illinois section 4-10 is an insurance law that

13

does not conflict with ERISA section 502 or this Court's

14

decision in Pilot Life, and therefore it is enforceable to

15

protect the interests of Illinois Insureds like Deborah

Moran.

QUESTION:

Does the Illinois law provide for

review in Illinois State courts?

19

MR. ALBERS:

one way or the other.

This case was reviewed and was enforced by the Seventh

22

Circuit as a 502 action.

QUESTION:

The Illinois law does not provide
Section 4-10 does not say that.

But the action was originally brought

in State court, was it not?
MR.ALBERS:

I originally brought the action in

Alderson Reporting Company

State court to enforce the independent review because the

2

insurer was refusing to provide any independent review at

all, and the two parts of the statute, the requirement

4

that there be medical necessity, this review and then the

5

actual enforcement of the decision, were parsed at the

6

district court level and in the Seventh Circuit.

7

Conlon initially remanded the case after it was removed,

8

finding that the medical necessity portion of the statute

9

did not offend Pilot Life or section 502.

10

Judge

Back in State court, Judge Kinnaird in Chancery

11

found that medical necessity did not offend 502 and

12

ordered a medical necessity review.

If the Seventh Circuit view is upheld

18

by this Court, in the future would actions lie in State

MR. ALBERS:

20

I think consistent with the Court's

21

502 ruling in Pilot Life, it would be a 502 action to seek

22

benefits.

24

statute which requires medical necessity.

Alderson Reporting Company

was perfectly appropriate to send this case back to State

court for that determination and that ruling, but

3

ultimately, to get the benefit, I would suggest that that

4

would have to come under 502, under the Court's reasoning

5

in Pilot Life.

6

This case does not conflict with Pilot Life, as

7

petitioner suggests.

In addressing the conflict issue

8

which has been raised, which I think is central to the

9

decision the Court needs to make, I think the Court should

10

consider the burdens that petitioner must meet to show

11

that conflict.

be wrong on that, and I don't want to lead you in the

MR. ALBERS:

the only place that the reviewer could go would be to the

of what we consider an arbitration, which is, you review

the evidence from both sides, they have an opportunity to

argue, and then you make a decision, and that's what I

MR. ALBERS:

I think the Court in Pegram -- and

7

it wasn't the issue before the Court in Pegram, but said

that HMO's act like insurers and transfer risks like

9

insurers, and the Illinois statute defines an HMO as an

10
11

entity that bears risk.
QUESTION:

That's why I gave my example, because

I wanted you to see that virtually every manufacturer of

Yes to both those questions.

The

22

what constitutes an insurer.

MR. ALBERS:

Yes, that's -- for purposes of

9

factor is whether it -- whether the State considers it to

10

be an insurer or whether it regulates it as an insurer,

and in both situations it does here.
In conclusion, I would suggest, in response to

Once the medical necessity determination is made, that is

this issue, what would be the effect of such a ruling on

2

voluntary agreements, and I agree with the proposition

3

that if there's a conflict between independent review and

4

502, then the parties couldn't even agree to provide

5

independent review, which would change the practice across

6

the country, because it is being provided by self-insured

7

plans and by HMO's.

8

Under 514(b), I submit that this is a State

9

insurance law which looked to harmonize the effect of that

10

law and affirmed the States can regulate insurance and can

11

regulate insurers' medical necessity decisions by leaving

12

those medical decisions to doctors, who should be making

them.

Does the Illinois Insurance

preemptive scope of section 502(a) has to do with causes

5

that may be awarded in court, and that is precisely the

6

formulation that the Court used in Pilot Life itself.

7

At the conclusion of the Court's opinion in

In other words, the

8

Pilot Life, the Court said in distinguishing Metropolitan

9

Life, the Court said the Court in Metropolitan Life had no

10

occasion to consider the question presented in this case,

11

whether Congress might clearly express through 502(a) an

12

intention that Federal, the Federal remedy provided by

13

that provision displaced State causes of action, and

14

that's what the question was about in UNUM.

15

Here, section 4 -- excuse me, in Pilot Life.

16

Here, section 4-10 of the Illinois HMO statute

17

does not provide a State cause of action in court, and it

does not provide any remedy or relief beyond what's

19

available under the plan itself.
QUESTION:

20

Well, you could look at it that way,

or you could look at it that it provides, the State law

MR. KNEEDLER:

I don't think that's the ordinary

understanding of what a cause of action is.

enforce directly in court.

Well, I -- my point is, that's

13

what section 502(a) addresses, and the analysis in Pilot

15

important feature of Pilot Life is, the Court went through

16

the various remedies that section 502(a) provides, and

17

tellingly discussed this Court's decision in Russell in

18

which the Court held that punitive damages were not

19

available in a suit against a fiduciary based on claims

State cause of action to displace Congress' judgment about

the fact that these are highly judgmental medical

the absurd example in which the State provided that there

23

or years before the person could get into court.

Just assume

In each instance, I'm assuming that it would not
be a provision by the State of a cause of action in the

2

concede in that case that the State scheme was keeping

3

people out of Federal court for enforcement so long that

4

it would, in fact, be in conflict and would be preempted.

5

MR. KNEEDLER:

I think the analysis there would

be one of exhaustion of remedies under the plan, including

those required --

Another point that the Court stressed in Pilot

Life was that the Congress struck a balance between the

3

prompt and fair processing of claims and suits in court.

4

Well, but arbitration and independent review, measures

adopted by State insurance laws of this sort, are

precisely designed to facilitate the prompt and fair and

expeditious processing of claims without having to go to

court, so it --

QUESTION:

Mr. Kneedler, doesn't it give you a

10

very different remedy -- I mean, to say that it isn't just

11

a matter of delay, that isn't the problem here.

12

problem here is that under the plan, the plan manager's

13

determination was to be given deference by the Federal

court in deciding whether the plan had been complied with,

15

whereas under the scheme set up by the State, his

determination is not to be given deference.

7

That would be a classic

I want to mention one other point about the

8

characterization of Pilot Life, and that is this Court's

9

decision in UNUM.

The Court there said, whatever the

10

merits of UNUM's view of section 502(a)'s preemptive

11

force, the issue is not implicated here.

12

went on to say why, because Ward sued under 502(a)(1)(B)

13

itself to recover benefits it was not a displacement of

14

the Federal remedy, it was an invocation of the Federal

15

remedy to recover benefits, and the Court said in that

16

cause of action, the notice prejudice rule of California

17

insurance law supplied the rule of decision.

18

The Court then

So, too, here, in the cause of action under

19

section 502(a)(1)(B) the State Illinois HMO law supplies

20

the rule of decision, a procedure for an independent

21

reviewer to give a quick, prompt review of the claim, and

22

that independent reviewer's decision is -- then supplies

23

the rule of decision that the HMO must comply with, and

24

that is then subject to review in Federal court.

25

The claimant's right to go to court is not

the claimant's ability to go directly to court.

He can seek review of the arbitrator's

Nothing in the HMO act stands as an obstacle to

Another important point about UNUM is, the Court

8

made clear that the processing of claims under an

9

insurance policy, it is an integral part of that insurance

policy, but at the same time States may regulate the

process by which claims are adjudicated, and that is

14

provided for this external sort of review, and it is

common in insurance and medical practice to provide by

second opinions by physicians, so what has been provided

One other point about section 502, it's

19

patterned after section 301 of the LMRA, an arbitration

20

preceding judicial review is a very familiar aspect of

21

judicial review under section 301.

22

does not provide for any particular standard of review.

23

You can have de novo breach of contract suits, as in the

24

Bowen v. Postal Service case we mentioned in our brief, or

25

highly deferential standards of review where the

process.

3

502 has the same flexibility.

It can have a

4

direct de novo cause of action, as the Court contemplated

5

in Firestone, or, where the parties' underlying agreement

6

or contract provides for a separate resolution process,

7

there is deference to that process under section 502.

MR. ROBERTS:

ground.

17

collective bargaining agreement to resolve their disputes

in a particular manner, even arbitration, would surely be

when you're talking about preemption.

8

long as the employee can still resort to the Federal

9

remedy seems to ignore the typical dynamic of preemption.

10

And as far as the arbitration analogy goes, the

11

fact that the plans may or may not be able to voluntarily

12

adopt such a remedy doesn't mean the State can compel it.

13

Nothing prevented the plan in Egelhoff from voluntarily
