ORAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER E. DELLINGER, III

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. DELLINGER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Title I of the Americans With Disabilities Act

12

does more than merely prohibit hostile discrimination

13

against individuals with disabilities.

14

recognized that an additional kind of discrimination is

15

the failure of employers through indifference or whatever

16

to undertake reasonable accommodations to the physical or

17

mental limitations of otherwise qualified individuals.

18

a result, this act does affirmatively require businesses

19

to lift barriers that inhibit employment opportunities for

20

those with disabilities.

21

Congress

As

The question here, though, is whether, in one

22

particular respect, the act goes beyond a requirement that

23

obstacles be cleared away.

24

employee is unable, because of a disability, to continue

25

in his job, is that employee entitled to be placed in

The issue is this.

Where an

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

another position instead of a more senior fellow employee

2

who would be entitled to the job under the normal

3

operation of a bona fide seniority system?

4

Now, this is not an easy question, but we

5

believe that in the end a clear answer necessarily emerges

6

from the act, and that is this, that the act simply does

7

not require an employer to override neutral selection

8

criteria wholly unrelated to disability in choosing among

9

applicants for a position, and in particular it does not

10

require the employer to set aside the normal operation of

11

a bona fide seniority system.

12

QUESTION:

Mr. Dellinger, are you suggesting by

13

that argument that the express exception for bona fide

14

seniority systems in title VII was surplusage, that it

15

wasn't needed, because there would have been -- it would

16

have been counted as a neutral rule?

17

MR. DELLINGER:

That is correct.

In fact, I

18

think the presence of that provision in title VII is part

19

of a background assumption in which neither title VII nor

20

any other Civil Rights Act has ever taken what would be a

21

fairly substantial step of requiring an employer to prefer

22

someone for a position over an employee who is entitled to

23

it under a seniority system or, indeed, to prefer any

24

applicant over a more qualified employee.

25

QUESTION:

But your answer is that it wasn't

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

necessary to put that in title VII, title VII would apply

2

just the same way without it?

3
4
5

MR. DELLINGER:

That is correct.

I do not

believe that -QUESTION:

Is there any indication that that's

6

what Congress thought when it didn't -- I mean, it does

7

seem a rather conspicuous absence, that the model statute,

8

the basic one has an express exception for bona fide

9

seniority systems, and this one doesn't.

10

MR. DELLINGER:

Title VII took especial care to

11

do that, but if you look at the more relevant statute, the

12

Rehabilitation Act, it also does not contain any express

13

exception and, moreover, it was interpreted not to require

14

that, but most importantly under title VII, is this

15

Court's decision in TWA v. Hardison, where the Court said

16

it would reach the same result as the principle we argue

17

for here, even without, even before you get to the portion

18

of the act about bona fide seniority systems.

19

The Court in Hardison held that the reasonable

20

accommodation language of that act for religious

21

adherence, the same reasonable accommodation undue

22

hardship language does not require displacing the rights

23

of more senior employees under a seniority system in order

24

to accommodate a religious adherence need to avoid working

25

on a Saturday shift.

1

QUESTION:

But are there any instances in which

2

the seniority clause has to be ignored in favor of a

3

reasonable accommodation?

4

and they pay the same thing, but a senior employee wants

5

position A, and that's the only one that the disabled

6

person can fulfill?

7

Suppose there are two positions

The seniority provision trumps there?

MR. DELLINGER:

Yes, it does, Justice Kennedy,

8

and let me acknowledge that, of course, whenever you have

9

a clear rule like the rule here that an employee, that an

10

employer may apply a neutral standard unrelated to

11

disability, such as a merit standard or a seniority

12

standard, any time you have a clear rule, and that's the

13

way seniority systems operate, you're going to have

14

individual cases where, if you had a different kind of

15

system involving individual assessment, you might reach a

16

different conclusion in the very particular instances, but

17

that -- that notion that you look and see whether in one

18

particular case favoring the interest of the less-senior

19

employee would in some social sense be better, that system

20

is fundamentally incompatible with the nature of how a

21

seniority system operates.

22

This is a system that, for US Airways, there are

23

14,000 customer service employees.

24

that gets rid of the potential of favoritism --

25

QUESTION:

Seniority is a system

Would you talk about what the system

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

is here, because I found it a little hard to understand.

2

Is it that a policy of the employer, the airline, that

3

every so often all positions in the category in which this

4

person worked are declared vacant?

5

MR. DELLINGER:

I think that terminology is not

6

used, Justice O'Connor.

7

happens under US Airways' system is that periodically,

8

basically once a quarter, all positions are put up for

9

rebidding.
QUESTION:

10

The effect may be the same.

All positions throughout the company,

11

or in certain categories of jobs?

12

MR. DELLINGER:

All through the entire category

13

of customer service employees, which would be 14,000.

14

don't think they rebuild the -QUESTION:

15
16

What

I

Customer service jobs, once a

quarter, are all declared open?
MR. DELLINGER:

17

That's right.

Each different

18

division would -- well, they're not so much declared open,

19

as simply put up for rebidding.

20

system operates is that there is a -- it's a very simple

21

system.

22

Everybody can rely upon where they are in the pecking

23

order of that list.

24

the people who are in those positions are not necessarily

25

the ones who lose their job.

That is, the way the

There's a list kept in order of seniority.

When there are positions eliminated,

If two positions are eliminated in the freight

area, the two juniormost employees have to leave, and

3

4

QUESTION:

Well, we're not talking about job

5

elimination.

I thought we were talking about an existing

6

job that continues but it's declared open.
MR. DELLINGER:

No.

There is no -- there's

no -- if you gained the impression from respondent's brief

that Mr. Barnett's position was somehow singled out to be

13

policy?
MR. DELLINGER:

14
15

That is correct.

Is that the

That is

correct.
QUESTION:

16

And at that -- is it also true, as I

17

think you allege, that the seniority policy does not

18

create legally enforceable rights in any employee?

19

employee wanting to come in would be able to sue to get

20

that enforced.
MR. DELLINGER:

21
22

That is correct.

No

The

company's -QUESTION:

23

So what kind of a seniority plan is

24

that?

I mean, on the one hand you say, we have to apply

25

our seniority plan, but on the other hand, it isn't

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

enforceable.
MR. DELLINGER:

2

Yes, and I'm glad you asked

3

that.

Of course, the company's consistent position in

4

court, whenever someone wants to have a court review how a

5

seniority plan is applied, is it relies upon the fact that

6

it does not create legal rights enforceable in court, but

7

no one has challenged the fact that it is a bona fide

8

program.

It's not a -QUESTION:

9

I know, but what would be the

10

situation if there were truly a vacant position at US

11

Airways in customer service?

12

would say that it would be a reasonable accommodation to

13

consider a disabled employee for placement in one of those

14

slots?

15

MR. DELLINGER:

Would you think the ADA

Yes, absolutely.

We believe

16

that the reassignment aspect of reasonable accommodation

17

does have considerable bite and does considerable work.

18

It requires you not only to consider, but actively

19

consider whether there are any other vacant places in

20

which you could place an employee.

21

QUESTION:

I mean, there is a provision in the

22

act itself, is there not, that speaks to a vacancy and

23

that can be a reasonable accommodation?

24
25

MR. DELLINGER:

That is correct, and we believe

that what that means, Justice O'Connor, is that an

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

employer must, unlike the situation under the

2

Rehabilitation Act, where you could simply say you can't

3

do the job --

4

QUESTION:

Yes.

5

MR. DELLINGER:

-- we're letting you go, we

6

can't accommodate that job, they have no obligation to

7

consider other places in the company.

8

Here, they have to actively consider.

9

to actually go out, you're obligated to go out and try to

10
11

You have

find a vacant position.
QUESTION:

Okay, so why isn't the sort of thing

12

that US Airways does here, declaring all these jobs open

13

once a quarter, create the kind of thing that US Airways

14

has to consider a vacant position?

15

MR. DELLINGER:

Well, you are exactly right that

16

when the quarterly rebidding process comes up, yes, they

17

have to consider, and they did, indeed, consider Mr.

18

Barnett's request to be transferred into that position.

19

Moreover, if they needed to make adjustment or

20

accommodations on how that second position functioned,

21

they would be obligated to do that as well.

22

What they were not obligated to do at this

23

point, after they've identified available positions,

24

overridden any arbitrary rules that say, you know, some

25

people can't have that position, altered the position,

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

they then consider whether there's any good reason not to

2

place Mr. Barnett in that position and, in the absence of

3

a good reason, they are required by this provision to do

4

so.

5

the act does not require the employer to override neutral

6

selection criteria wholly unrelated to disability in

7

choosing among applicants --

8

QUESTION:

9

At this point, we believe that the better reading of

May I ask, do you mean any neutral --

any neutral selection criteria would trump the statute?

10

Say they had a criteria that they used brand new employees

11

for certain ticket-selling jobs as a training mechanism,

12

and they always took people who hadn't worked for the

13

company for more than 90 days or something, that that was

14

their regular practice, would that practice always trump

15

the interest of the disability -- disabled person?

16

MR. DELLINGER:

Yes.

I believe that an employer

17

is entitled, under the statute -- you've got to have a

18

good, neutral reason unrelated to disability, but the

19

bright line --

20

QUESTION:

Now you've added the word good. I

21

thought it only had to be neutral.

22

MR. DELLINGER:

23

I mean good in the sense that it

has to be legitimate, bona fide business reason.

24

QUESTION:

Something they always do.

25

MR. DELLINGER:

Yes.

You've got to, because the

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

act requires you to make this appointment,

2

we -QUESTION:

3
4

but where

Suppose you have a seniority system

that's riddled with exceptions.
MR. DELLINGER:

5

Where you have a seniority

6

system that's riddled with exceptions, it is perfectly

7

open to someone who challenges that to say, you don't

8

really have a neutral policy unrelated to disability.
QUESTION:

9

No, no, you do.

I mean, here you

10

happen to have just one exception.

Well, suppose there

11

were five or six, and so the argument would be, well, if

12

you can make an exception for the hardship, the

13

catastrophic illness, for this special situation in that

14

one, what we want you to do is also make an exception for

15

the handicapped person.
Now, nobody's doubting the employer's good

16
17

faith.

The question is, well, why not make na exception

18

for us.

19

it to see how open to you that is.

20

MR. DELLINGER:

You have a lot of others.

Let's have a trial on

The answer to your question is,

21

no, you are not required to do the reassignment merely

22

because your seniority policy is one that applies

23

seniority in some circumstances and not others.

24
25

QUESTION:

All right, then at that point I'd

become uncertain what exactly -- why we should hold what

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

you want, from my point of view.

2

see this act simply requires the employer to act

3

reasonably, and now you could say, where there's a

4

longstanding seniority system, and there's nothing special

5

about it, and there are zero or very few exceptions, it's

6

automatically a reasonable thing to not stir up enormous

7

trouble in the workplace by saying, we're going to start

8

making exceptions.

9

agree, but I understand it.

10

That is, I can easily

I could see that.

I'm not saying I

But now, why is it, if there are, however, quite

11

a few exceptions, that it isn't even open to the

12

handicapped person to argue, make another, it's not

13

unreasonable to make another?

14

MR. DELLINGER:

Let me preface my answer by

15

saying that for decades US Airways has had an established

16

seniority policy that covers all of these positions, which

17

has been regularly followed, with one exception for

18

catastrophic illnesses and one revision of how you

19

calculate the time of seniority, so that that issue is

20

not, you know, raised or put before the Court as to

21

whether you would think that not a good reason.

22

But it seems to me that under -- if you look at

23

the sequence from the title VII through the Rehabilitation

24

Act, through Hardison, the background principle that our

25

civil rights laws have simply not restricted the ability

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

of an employer to make a good faith determination about

2

how to fill positions, and that nothing in the ADA itself

3

seems to question that bedrock assumption.

4

say, no one suggests, though it would be a perfectly --

5

not unduly costly that you need to add positions.

6

Everyone seems to concede and agree that you don't need to

7

transfer an employee to a position that would constitute

8

a, quote, promotion, unquote, even though that might --

9

the employee might be qualified to do that position.

That is to

10

one suggests that you have to bump an employee who was

11

actually sitting in a position.

No

12

Here, what you have is the defeated expectations

13

under a seniority system, and if that system is bona fide,

14

the way it works is to allow each employee to determine

15

what his or her most important desires are, and that is

16

what you gain through seniority.

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. DELLINGER:

19

QUESTION:

If you lose to --

Mr. Dellinger -Yes.

-- one of the reasons that I find

20

this particular statute puzzling is that it's not like

21

title VII.

22

It says, you don't prefer -- you don't just redress

23

imbalances.

24
25

Title VII says, thou shalt not discriminate.

It's a straight nondiscrimination statute.

This one isn't.

This one is driven by a concept

called, reasonable accommodation.

It makes reasonable

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

accommodation -- if you don't reasonably accommodate,

2

you're discriminating, and so it seems to me that this

3

statute has reasonable accommodation, if it's undue

4

hardship, then it would be unreasonable, but there's

5

nothing like that in title VII.

6

gives a starring role to reasonable accommodation, which

7

it truly doesn't have in title VII, so to give that

8

effect, couldn't you look at this and say, well, this man

9

was already in the job, and no body is going to be out of

This disabilities act

10

work, so the accommodation is reasonable.

11

seeking to bump somebody else, it wouldn't be reasonable.

12

Why isn't that an appropriate way to look at this act

13

that's driven by the idea, reasonable accommodation?

14

MR. DELLINGER:

If he were

Let me acknowledge that what

15

makes this an interesting case is the fact that the ADA

16

does go beyond merely prohibiting hostile discrimination,

17

so you're right that there are things that an employer

18

affirmatively has to do that it doesn't have to do for

19

other employees under this act.

20

The general language of the act, though, in my

21

view is not sufficient to change the landscape that

22

existed under the Rehabilitation Act, where the Courts had

23

uniformly held that reassignment was never required.

24

now a possibility, but you're never required.

25

QUESTION:

It's

But did the statute have the word,

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

reassignment in it, as this one does?
MR. DELLINGER:

It did not have in it the word,

3

reassignment, but we don't think that that word is

4

intended to change -- in the Hardison case under title VII

5

it was a reasonable accommodation case, and yet the Court

6

said, no, there's a bright line.

7

though the religious part of title VII requires a

8

reasonable accommodation, we're never going to require

9

another employee to sacrifice his or her standing under

10
11

We're never -- even

the seniority policy.
Now, the other part of your question, I think

12

the question asked by Justice Breyer was, but what if it's

13

really reasonable in a particular instance, and here's

14

where I need to suggest why that approach is fundamentally

15

inconsistent with how a seniority system operates.

16

are introducing an element of judgment and discretion

17

which will unsettle settled expectations in a way that is

18

completely unpredictable.

19

can't know what the domino effect will be of substituting

20

for a seniority system.

21

You

What happens is, you simply

This is a system that is now operated by lower

22

level managers who need to keep a posted list where every

23

employee knows what the position is.

24

would be a fundamental alteration of the system to require

25

the employer no longer to utilize this neutral basis.

that might well be true if it were the subject of

collective bargaining and an agreement, but not for an

MR. DELLINGER:

7

Is that how you read the brief?
That is how you read that brief,

8

and I see that is not a distinction which Congress made in

title VII when it chose there to protect seniority

18

the disabled lesser rights --

1

MR. DELLINGER:

Undue hardship, that's right,

2

really goes to cost on an employer.

3

reasonable accommodation language here requires an

4

employer to take affirmative steps to try to enable a

5

person with a disability to continue in the workplace, and

6

in particular with respect to reassignments, to look for

7

vacant places to make second job accommodatable, for

8

example, but not to cross a very major line --

9

QUESTION:

I think the

13

accommodate this disabled worker?

14

MR. DELLINGER:

Yes, it is unreasonable for the

15

following reason.

16

declaration of vacancy to which you refer is simply how a

17

system operates where every employee accumulates seniority

18

and then gets to choose the position and the shift, so

19

that if you gain seniority, you get enough, you say thank

20

goodness I can now get off the graveyard shift, I can go

21

on the swing shift or the day shift position, I've gained

22

all of this, and that is rebid every quarter.

23

rebid on positions, and that seems like a perfectly

24

reasonable thing to do.

25

The reassignment, the sort of quarterly

People

It is a -- there's nothing -- what is the bright

18
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

line, I think, here is that Congress has -- would have

2

fought long and debated hard before it took the major step

3

of saying an employer could not, at the end of the day,

4

once all accommodations had been made, choose a person for

5

a position based on who was the best-qualified or who was

6

the most senior.

7

Now, let me say again what --

8

QUESTION:

9

Your argument for that, as I

understand it, is the argument that you've repeated in a

10

couple, or your claim that you've repeated in a couple of

11

instances that there would be something fundamentally

12

unhinging to the seniority system to allow a disabilities

13

exception, and that seems to me in part sort of an

14

empirical question.
I mean, if a company like yours was going to

15
16

have 100 disability exceptions a month at every terminal,

17

yes, I can see it, but is there any reason to believe that

18

the magnitude of the possible disabilities exceptions

19

under reasonable accommodation would be so great as to

20

have that kind of cataclysmic effect on the general

21

reliance that employees can place on seniority?
MR. DELLINGER:

22

Justice Souter, that is a good

23

question that I think would go to whether it was an undue

24

hardship.

25

QUESTION:

Well, it would go to that, but

19
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

wouldn't it -- you know, it would go to -MR. DELLINGER:

But here, on the question of

3

unreasonableness, I think we're looking at a question of

4

principle.

5

decision, it is a difference not just of cost but of

6

principle, and here the principle at stake is the interest

7

of other employees, so --

8
9
10
11

As Judge Posner said in the Seventh Circuit

QUESTION:

There's no question, to the extent of

the exceptions, their interest is going to be discounted
in some way.
MR. DELLINGER:

And even -- even though we don't

12

know the numbers, because we don't know ultimately how

13

broadly the court will interpret the phrase, disability,

14

which you have sub judice in other cases, and even them

15

would take some working out.

16

but we do know how it would disrupt the expectations of

17

employees.

18

We don't know the numbers,

Here, for example, even though we have a bright

19

line rule -- we have a bright line rule with promotions.

20

Even though promotions are a reassignment to a vacant

21

position, you never have to promote, and that's because

22

there's a good reason, it is thought, that promotions are

23

not a reasonable accommodation.

24

reason, in my view, not to trump the rights and interests

25

of other employees who have earned a right to a position,

There's an even better

20
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

and to try to look, as several of you have in questions,

2

as to whether it might be reasonable in a particular

3

instance, I don't know how you place this burden on

4

managers in a system that is a seniority system to make

5

those complex social judgments not knowing what the domino

6

effect is.

You could have --

QUESTION:

7

Well, one thing is easy to see is

8

that if you bump somebody, it's no good.

9

reasonable.

That's not

If somebody, as in this case, is already in

10

the job, you let that person remain in the job, so it's

11

not as though every exercise of seniority rights is of

12

equal magnitude.

13

job and some senior person otherwise would be laid off,

14

then you say it's unreasonable, but here there isn't such

15

a situation.

If somebody is trying to bid for that

MR. DELLINGER:

16

That could well be.

We don't

17

know what the effect is, because someone will be bumped if

18

they don't get their desired position.
QUESTION:

19

For example --

I thought we know on the facts of

20

this case that it's only a question of, that nobody is

21

going to be bumped.

22

that job.

23

he weren't disabled.

24
25

The question is whether he stays in

There were jobs he could have done in cargo, if

MR. DELLINGER:

We don't know what the

consequences will be, because what Mr. Barnett is

21
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

asking -- and this is from his declaration, which is not

2

in the joint appendix, but is at page 3 of his declaration

3

of February 28, he says, the intent and potential effect

4

of my request was to have the employee who is going to

5

displace me in the mailroom go around me and bump the next

6

less senior position.

7

You could have the following situation.

You

8

could have the person who's claiming the job in the

9

mailroom could be an older single parent who's finally

10

worked out child care arrangements and is entitled by

11

seniority to the mailroom position, but who finds out,

12

when, though she is senior in position, or he is senior in

13

position, that Mr. Barnett is insulated from the normal

14

operations system, would have to bump the next position

15

down, which might well be a graveyard shift position, or a

16

position in cargo, which the person was too old to handle

17

the effects of, so you simply --

18

QUESTION:

What it boils down to, though, is, I

19

think as Justice Ginsburg is suggesting, it means that no

20

one can bump up, but it doesn't mean that anybody gets

21

bumped down, and that, there's a -- I mean, she suggests

22

there's a qualitative difference between those two.

23
24
25

MR. DELLINGER:

And I think we don't know that,

Justice -QUESTION:

Well, why don't we know that as a

22
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

matter of logic?
MR. DELLINGER:

2

Because it could well be that

3

the more senior employee who needs to be in the mailroom,

4

she needs -- her position is being eliminated.

5

to be in the mailroom, which has a day shift.

She's

6

senior and entitled to it.

The next

7

senior position, which she has to take, could be a

8

graveyard shift, or a graveyard shift in cargo.

9

not be able to work -QUESTION:

10

She can't get it.

She needs

She might

That's true, but it's still the fact

11

that we know that the effect of following Justice

12

Ginsburg's suggestion is that no extra person gets bumped

13

down.

14

bump the disabled employee down.

15

certainty, can't we?

16

It's merely that one person doesn't bump up and

MR. DELLINGER:

That we can say with

It may well be in many instances

17

the bottom-most person will lose their job, and it could

18

be that the more senior person would get a job that

19

they -- that doesn't work out for them.

20
21

QUESTION:

But that's going to be a wash no

matter how it works.

22

MR. DELLINGER:

23

QUESTION:

Not necessarily.

If you have

zero-sum -- I mean, if

24

you have a finite number of employees and you're laying

25

somebody off, that's --

23
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. DELLINGER:

Under our plan, it won't be that

2

more people will lose jobs, or get their less desired

3

accommodation. It will be that the more senior employees

4

do not get the position to which they are entitled, which

5

for complex reasons may be very important to them.

6

I'll reserve the remainder of my time.

7

QUESTION:

8

Ms. Center, we'll hear from you.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CLAUDIA CENTER

9

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

10

MS. CENTER:

11
12

Very well, Mr. Dellinger.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
There are four points that must be made in this

13
14

case.

First of all, the petitioner's proposed definition

15

of the term, reasonable accommodation, as meaning fair,

16

proper, fit, appropriate, not extreme, not excessive, et

17

cetera, et cetera, must be rejected, because that

18

construction eviscerates all of the statutory defenses, is

19

contrary to all of the regulations, and it is contrary to

20

the listed reasonable accommodations, including

21

reassignment.
Second, the term reasonable accommodation in the

22
23

ADA means a modification that enables the disabled

24

employee to participate that is reasonable to the disabled

25

employee.

24
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Third, even if you --

2

QUESTION:

You're

-- stopping you at the second

3

point, there, so from your point of view, reasonable

4

relates only to its effect on the employee, not on anybody

5

else?

6

MS. CENTER:

That's correct.

7

Third, even if you disagree with my proposal for

8

the definition of reasonable accommodation, the term must

9

include the listed reasonable accommodations.

Where it

10

says reasonable accommodations may include, those

11

accommodations listed, which include reassignment to a

12

vacant position, are reasonable accommodations by

13

definition.
QUESTION:

14

But the statute says may include.

15

doesn't say must include.

16

include?
MS. CENTER:

17

It

Your definition says must

The may include relates to the

18

case-by-case individualized analysis that must take place.

19

All of the accommodations won't be necessary in every

20

cases.

21

the specific individual employee.

22

The may include relates to the specific needs of

And finally, reassignment to a vacant position

23

means an actual reassignment to a job that is not

24

currently occupied or that has not already been filled.

25

QUESTION:

Would you -- Ms. Center, why is it --

25
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

it has been conceded, I gather -- you didn't contest this

2

anyway, in your brief, that reasonable accommodation would

3

never include appointment to a promotion to a more -- a

4

position that pays slightly more, even though the amount

5

it pays more is negligible, so it's not -- you know, it's

6

not a hardship on the employer.

7

MS. CENTER:

Why is that?

Well, I think there are several

8

reasons that the agency, the EEOC has come to that

9

conclusion, which I agree with.

First of all, the listed

10

accommodation is reassignment to a vacant position.

11

Congress did not say promotion, and reassignment describes

12

a lateral transfer, ordinarily.
QUESTION:

13

Well, but this is a vacant higher

14

position.

15

position at a higher level.

16

included?

17

They didn't exclude that.

MS. CENTER:

This is a vacant

Why wouldn't that be

Further, the EEOC regulations

18

explain that the purpose of the reasonable accommodation

19

is to enable the disabled employee to enjoy the privileges

20

of employment along with similarly situated disable -­

21

nondisabled employees, to enjoy equal benefits, and if

22

there's a promotion it's sort of -- it's contrary to that

23

principle.

24
25

QUESTION:

Oh, but so is what you're urging

here, this -- you're ending up giving the person here

26
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

seniority rights, which exceed those of other employees

2

who have been there a certain amount of time.
MS. CENTER:

3

Well, in this case the job that Mr.

4

Barnett ended up with was equal in terms of, a) he would

5

have been employed, and b) at the same pay and, et cetera,

6

the same level --

7

QUESTION:

8

MS. CENTER:

9

I understand, but --- as he would have gotten but for

his disability.
QUESTION:

10

But you can't urge that your system

11

assures that the disabled not be given any benefits that

12

other employees would not get.

13

benefit that they wouldn't get.

14

to stay in that job, so why can't you do the same thing

15

for a promotion?

You're giving him a
They wouldn't be allowed

16

I mean, the other side has a criterion.

17

criterion is, it is -- reasonable accommodation is limited

18

to accommodation to the disability, so you provide him

19

with a working space that will accommodate the fact that

20

he can't stand up for too long, or you put him in another

21

job at the same level that's vacant which doesn't require

22

him to stand up.

23

they say.

24
25

Their

All of this accommodates the disability,

Whereas the accommodation you're urging here has
nothing to do with accommodating the disability.

It has

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

to do with, I don't know, giving him a different job.

2

MS. CENTER:

3

QUESTION:

Right, the accommodation is -They have a criterion.

I don't

4

understand what your criterion is, except, you know, do

5

what is reasonable.

6

the disabled person if it -- it just costs a few more

7

bucks.

8

hardship to the employer, so promote him.

9

reasonable?

10

Why isn't it reasonable to promote

That's the only vacant job left.

MS. CENTER:

It's not
Why isn't that

Well, it's -- in addition to the

11

reasons I already gave you, the agency has construed

12

reassignment to a vacant position to not include

13

promotion, and --

14

QUESTION:

15

the agency was unreasonable.

16

(Laughter.)

17

MS. CENTER:

Well, never mind the agency.

Maybe

In this case, though, the

18

accommodation that Mr. Barnett sought was not more

19

seniority.

position and not --

21

QUESTION:

The accommodation was reassignment to a vacant

I'm not talking about him, though.

22

I'm asking for your theory of the case.

23

makes an assignment not reasonable, or an accommodation

24

not reasonable?

25

MS. CENTER:

What is it that

An accommodation --

Alderson Reporting Company

1

QUESTION:

Once you cut it loose from

2

accommodating the disability, which is what the other side

3

wants to do, once you cut it loose from that, why isn't

4

everything up for grabs, including a promotion?

5

MS. CENTER:

It's not cut loose from the

6

disability.

The reasonable accommodation has to be made,

7

by the clear a statutory language has to be made to the

8

physical or mental limitations of the disabled employee.

9

Here, the reassignment enabled Mr. Barnett to retain --

10

would have enabled Mr. Barnett to retain his employment.

11

It was because of his disability that he was unable to

12

perform the job that he was relegated to when the

13

positions were put up for bid, so it was through his

14

disability --

15

QUESTION:

Well, it can -- it can be a

16

reasonable accommodation.

17

to it in the face of an employer's seniority plan that

18

would put somebody else there instead?

19

MS. CENTER:

20

QUESTION:

21

MS. CENTER:

The question is, is he entitled

Well, I think that he -I think that's the question.
Well, there are -- I think he is

22

entitled to that reasonable accommodation if all other

23

possibilities are exhausted.

24

are met for reassignment, such as there is a vacancy, the

25

disabled employee is qualified, and no statutory defense

If all of the prerequisites

29
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

such as undue hardship applies, I think he is entitled to

2

the reassignment.

3

QUESTION:

Even though some other employee on

4

the basis of greater seniority than the respondents under

5

the plan could take that slot?

6

MS. CENTER:

7

slot at that point.

8

QUESTION:

9
10
11
12

Yes.

I think he's entitled to that

And you don't equate that with the

situation of a promotion?
MS. CENTER:

No, it's not a promotion.

It's a

Let me be sure of one thing.

The

lateral transfer.
QUESTION:

13

case arises on a summary judgment, and I thought the court

14

of appeals held that you were entitled to a trial, not

15

that you were entitled to summary judgment.

16

claiming you are entitled to summary judgment?

17

MS. CENTER:

Are you

No, I'm -- I think that the

18

employer is free to try and present a defense to our claim

19

of failure to accommodate.

20

hardship, or one of the other statutory defenses.

21

QUESTION:

Their defense would be undue

Does reasonableness go the jury, or

22

is there a jury, do you think?

23

MS. CENTER:

There would be a jury.

I think in

24

this case because reasonable accommodation -- because

25

reassignment is one of the listed reasonable

30
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

accommodations, the judge could state that reassignment is

2

a reasonable accommodation, but if you disagree with my,

3

you know, construction of reasonable accommodation, then

4

it could go to the jury, I suppose.
QUESTION:

5

In your summary judgment proceeding,

6

did you challenge, at all, the employer's description of

7

the seniority system?

8

MS. CENTER:

9

Yes, there was a challenge to that

description.
QUESTION:

10

I didn't see it.

That is, as far as

11

I could see there's an affidavit on the employer's side,

12

and Rule 56(e) requires you to point to specific, you

13

know, record evidence or affidavits, et cetera.

14

see any.

15

MS. CENTER:

I didn't

Well, there wasn't -- I -- maybe I

16

misunderstood the question, but there was in the record an

17

effort to point out that they had made exceptions to the

18

seniority system, that they had amended it --

19

QUESTION:

As far as I could tell, what I have

20

to assume about the system is that it's widespread, it's

21

longstanding, it governs 14,000 employees, the only

22

exception is an exception for catastrophic medical

23

transfer, and the -- they say, I guess we have to take it

24

as given, that it would require your view would require US

25

Air to weigh and balance conflicting claims and personal

31
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

desires of all US Air agents, and it would interfere with,

2

I guess, the alternative child care arrangements,

3

educational endeavors, and the ability of other, the other

4

employees to continue working for the company.

5
6

Now, those seem to me the facts.
any refutation of them --

MS. CENTER:

QUESTION:

10
11

I didn't see

There are additional facts --- and therefore I assume, for

summary judgment purposes, I take those as a given, and if
I'm not supposed to, I'd like to know right now.
MS. CENTER:

There are additional facts, in

12

addition to the catastrophic illness exception there is a

13

significant modification to how to calculate furlough

14

seniority.

15

company seniority.

16

conceded, the personnel policy guide containing the

17

seniority policy states on its face that it's not a

18

contract, it's merely a --

There is a change from department seniority to
In addition, as the petitioner has

19

QUESTION:

20

MS. CENTER:

No, that's given.

I assume it's not.

And the grievance procedure, where

21

by employees would bring these seniority matters to the

22

company's attention, that grievance procedure says, you're

23

not allowed to grieve something that's required by Federal

24

law, and we get to decide what's required, so in that

25

circumstance it seems to me not reasonable for an employee

32
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

to believe that the job assignment policy is going to

2

trump a legitimate need for reasonable accommodation under

3

a Federal law.

4

QUESTION:

Given that statement, to get to

5

this -- what I think of anyway as the heart of this

6

matter, assuming I don't accept your view of reasonable

7

accommodation, assuming that I accept the view that

8

reasonableness includes the interest of other workers and

9

perhaps the interest of management as well, all right,

10

given that view of it, when you come up with the

11

characteristics that I've mentioned and that you added to,

12

why isn't it reasonable for the employer to say, look, if

13

I give this person the job, there's an alternative chain I

14

have to bump that really causes disruption in the company.

15

It throws everything up for grabs.

16

I can't enforce a seniority system under that

17

kind of regime, but even if I could, all these other

18

workers here are going to be disrupted, too, and that's

19

what makes my seniority system reasonable in the

20

circumstance.

21

Now, your reply to that is precisely what?

MS. CENTER:

The sort of domino effect has been

22

vastly overstated by this case by the petitioner.

The

23

actual impact of this sort of accommodation in this case

24

and in other cases is to permit the disabled individual to

25

have one assignment, and then replacing, on the list of

33
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

possible jobs for people to bid on, replacing that

2

assignment would be the job that the person left, so each

3

reassignment leaves a vacancy to be put on the list of

4

jobs -QUESTION:

5

I don't understand that part of your

6

answer, though I want to hear the rest, because if there

7

are 7,000 jobs missing, then it will be 7,000 people at

8

the end of the day without a job, and either you go down

9

one chain and bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, or you go down

10

a different chain and bump, bump, bump, bump, bump.

11

harm is precisely the same.

12

people suffer it, so I don't see why there isn't a domino

13

effect.

It's a question of which

It's this chain, or that chain.
MS. CENTER:

14

The

Right, but in terms of the

15

particular chain, there's a list of jobs upon which the

16

nondisabled employees can bid, and those would include all

17

of the jobs that remain vacant after the reassignment, as

18

well as the job that the disabled individual left, so the

19

actual impact is modest.

20

list and adding a different job on the list.
QUESTION:

21
22

a way?

23

disabled person.

24

I mean, that's possible.

Why isn't it -- as I read this statute, I don't

reading of reasonable accommodation to mean an

the reasonable expectation of fellow employees?

Why isn't it a perfectly feasible

MS. CENTER:

Well, you could conclude that, but

21

I think it's -- if you look at the statutory structure, if

you looked at the list of reasonable accommodations, if

MS. CENTER:

if all those people are in the act, I can't run my system,

says the employer, because the claims for special

exemption in the bumping will be endless.

5

Now, your response to that is what?

6

MS. CENTER:

Well, if you disagree with our

7

reading of the term, reasonable accommodation, the term

8

still would require a case-by-case individualized analysis

9

of whether it was reasonable in this situation, and what

10

the petitioner wants is a per se rule for bona fide

11

seniority policies, and that's completely contrary to the

12

way that the statute works, which is case-by-case

analysis.

MS. CENTER:

I think that each of the

handicapped employees would be entitled to reassignment to

MS. CENTER:

What is your

client's disability?

15

Let me ask you this.

He has a back impairment.
What does that mean?
He has an orthopedic disability.

He has pain, he has problems in his disks.
QUESTION:

Has it been established that he in

17

fact qualifies as disabled, or is that something we're

18

just assuming arguendo at this stage of the case?

19

MS. CENTER:

It's disputed.

A summary judgment

20

motion was denied on that issue, and so at this point I

21

imagine we're assuming arguendo.

22

QUESTION:

May I ask about a hypothetical that's

23

running through my mind.

Under your opponent's view, as I

24

understand it, it would be at least theoretically possible

25

that the job your client has occupied up to now, and he

39
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

wants to move because of his disability, would be the job

2

most people on the seniority list would want if it were

3

available, but they could nevertheless say they don't have

4

to accommodate.

MS. CENTER:

5
6

Am I right on that?
Could you ask it one more time?

I'm sorry.
QUESTION:

7

It seems to me theoretically possible

8

that he is -- because of his disability, he's leaving a

9

job that is a very attractive job for a nondisabled

10

person, and that everybody on the seniority list, if given

11

the choice of jobs, would pick his job, that under your

12

opponent's view it would nevertheless -- they could

13

nevertheless refuse to accommodate him.
MS. CENTER:

14

That's correct, and my client, Mr.

15

Barnett's goal is not to get the plum job.

16

goal is to get a job that he can do despite his

17

disability, so the purpose is not to prefer the disabled

18

19

to retain employment and to accommodate their limitations.

those, what the statute lists as reasonable

reason to get the break.
MS. CENTER:

People feel that they

It is a preference system.

That's correct.

The petitioner

12

concedes that the reasonable accommodation mandate

13

requires employers to do certain things for disabled

14

employees that they may choose not to do for nondisabled

15

employees.
QUESTION:

16

Sure, but preferring one -- I mean,

17

giving someone a benefit that someone else doesn't get,

18

such as allowing them to do a certain job sitting down

when everybody else has to do it standing up, or what-

20

not, that doesn't disadvantage the others.

that it refers only to what's reasonable for the disabled

reasonable accommodation really means, don't we?

MS. CENTER:

If you approach it the way you do,

case the equities really favor Mr. Barnett, because Mr.

Barnett is the one that faced job loss.

need for the job.

unemployed, so the equities will frequently favor the

have to take into consideration the disruption that's

caused in others' lives when you disrupt the seniority

system.

as we state in our brief, can be considered in the undue

hardship defense.

failure to accommodate.

Then why don't you do that

reasonableness always takes into consideration the

interest of other employees?

In other words, why doesn't -- why

MS. CENTER:

Because I think that's contrary to

the structure of the statute.

I think it's contrary to

10

the description of reasonable accommodations.

11

contrary to the regulations.

12

QUESTION:

It's

Yes, but can you find any textual

13

basis in the statute that says when you're dealing with

14

comparative interests of two disabled people you consider

15

the interests of both in determining what is reasonable,

16

but when you're considering the comparative interests of a

17

disabled person and others, you don't consider both?

of the statute was rejected and that we were looking at

had agreed earlier that it would never be reasonable to

I don't understand the

If the job's already

filled, it doesn't matter whether it's filled by another

12

MS. CENTER:

That's correct.

It will often, I

13

think, just be the chronology, who requests accommodation

14

first, who gets reassigned, and then you go on to the next

disabled employee if there is one and deal with their

16

accommodation.

18
19

QUESTION:

And the reason you can't bump another

employee is that that's unreasonable, is that -MS. CENTER:

No.

The reason is that the

20

accommodation listed is reassignment to a vacant position,

21

and that vacant language was put in there to prevent

22

bumping an occupied position, bumping an individual.

QUESTION:

Well, if you -- what you've said,

24

you're making of this statute in this respect something

1

discrimination, so the employer may have to give a remedy,

2

that remedy may adversely affect other people, and the

3

calculus that the Court has to make is, yes, they can be

4

hurt, but not too much, and isn't that exactly what is

5

going on here?

6

If we reject your client-centered interpretation

7

of reasonable, it's just the same thing.

8

Nondiscrimination, this statute goes beyond

9

nondiscrimination.

It requires reasonable accommodation.

10

What's reasonable?

Of course, you always have to take

11

into account the interests of other people.

12

MS. CENTER:

That's correct.

If we -- if the

13

Court rejects my view of the term, reasonable

14

accommodation, you'd have to take into account all of

15

those considerations, but you could not adopt, I don't

16

believe, the per se rule suggested by the petitioner that

17

neutral, you know, selection criteria are always going to

18

trump the ADA.

19

For example, your part-time working scenario,

20

that could be eliminated by a neutral rule that no one can

work less than full-time, so that can't be the rule.

it's reasonable, pulled out and looked at in the different

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER E. DELLINGER, III

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. DELLINGER:

Mr. Chief Justice, when it comes

to filling positions, which is fundamentally different, I

1

think, than adding other elements, there's nothing

anomalous about a per se rule, nor is that inconsistent

with giving individualized considerations.

and title VII both said that you don't displace seniority

systems.

The rehab act

In Hardison v. TWA, this Court did not say you

When it comes to positions, there is a good reason for

10

letting the more senior employee choose the more desirable

assessment could possibly make that a workable system.

I don't think either the line managers or the
