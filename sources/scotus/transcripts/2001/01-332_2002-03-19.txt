(Laughter.)

15

MS. MEOLI:

16

The third time is the

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

17

This case involves the constitutionality of the

18

Tecumseh School Board's decision to implement a

19

suspicionless drug testing policy for students in

20

competitive activities as a reasonable response to student

21

drug use.

22

Tecumseh's policy represents a natural, logical,

23

and rational application of this Court's decision in

24

Vernonia v. Acton.

25

who chose to participate in interscholastic athletics.

Vernonia's policy applied to students

Alderson Reporting Company

1

Tecumseh's policy applies as well to athletics, but also

2

to all the other competitive activities that are offered

3

by the district.

4

Respondents do not challenge the policy as

5

applied to the athletics, conceding that this Court

6

approved that practice in Vernonia.

7
8

QUESTION:

Well, this policy goes beyond what

was permitted in Vernonia, does it not?

9

MS. MEOLI:

10

QUESTION:

Well, it covers -It greatly expands the number of

11

students covered by the policy.

12

MS. MEOLI:

14

Competitive --

It -- it covers a wider variety of

interscholastic competitive activities.
QUESTION:

And the evidence is not as strong, is

it, in this case of drug use in the school as -- as was

16

the case in Vernonia?

MS. MEOLI:

Well, Your Honor, we do not believe

that is true.

Well, if you go by the district

court's findings, that's what you'd conclude.

MS. MEOLI:

QUESTION:

23

MS. MEOLI:

The district court in Vernonia?
In this case.
In this case.

No, Your Honor, I --

24

I really don't think so.

I think there is ample evidence

25

in the record to demonstrate a drug problem in Tecumseh.

What do you --

QUESTION:

By the -- by the young people who

3

were involved in these particular extracurricular

4

activities?

5
6

MS. MEOLI:

Yes, we do have evidence of drug use

with these students in extracurricular activities.

7

QUESTION:

Well, what do you make of the -- the

8

reports that have been filed up to the eve of the adoption

9

of this regulation by the school district with the Feds,

10

year after year after year, saying, things are fine here?

11

The only thing we have to worry about is some beer.

12

they lying?

13

MS. MEOLI:

Were

No, Your Honor, I don't think they

14

were lying.

that alcohol really is the number one problem in the

16

school district, and that's what the applications for the

Federal --

18

Number one, the district has always admitted

QUESTION:

Yes, but they were -- they were

19

saying at the same time that they didn't have a problem

20

with -- with what we usually refer to as drugs.

21

MS. MEOLI:

They said it -- it wasn't a major

22

problem at that time.

23

compare --

25

QUESTION:

And -- and I think if you

And -- and in point of fact, as I

understand it, since the testing has been carried out

Alderson Reporting Company

among the -- the class of people subject to this

2

challenge, there have been only three instances of any

3

drug use found.

MS. MEOLI:

From the -- from the drug testing?

QUESTION:

It would seem -- it seems to me that

your evidentiary problem is up to the eve of adopting the

7

regulation, the school district was saying, we don't have

8

a problem.

was -- was placed into effect, you've gone for several

And once the regulation was, in fact, in --

10

years and you found three instances.

11

you -- you don't lose whether we look at it ex ante or ex

12

post.

13

MS. MEOLI:

I -- I don't see how

Let me answer the second part first.

14

First of all, the -- the policy was only in effect for a

15

limited amount of time in the 2-year span of time.

16

implemented halfway into the first school year, and so a

17

limited amount of students were covered in that first

18

year.

19

It was

The second year, the lawsuit was filed at the

20

beginning of August, and therefore only a very limited

21

number of initial testing was done before the district

22

determined to hold the policy in abeyance.

23

four students in -- under those limited amount of students

24

that tested positive.

QUESTION:

But didn't one --

3

QUESTION:

Well, I suppose the existence of a

4

policy might be expected to deter drug use so that you

5

would have fewer instances after it was imposed.

6
7

MS. MEOLI:

Yes, Your Honor, and -- and in fact

really --

8

QUESTION:

We will never know, will we?

9

QUESTION:

Well, let her answer the question.

10

(Laughter.)

11

MS. MEOLI:

Your Honor, in fact, it -- it really

12

did.

13

testing that we did in the 2-year period of time, the

14

first year three students tested positive, the second year

15

one student tested positive.

16

testing was applied in the Tecumseh School District was

17

after the district court made its decision but before the

18

court of appeals overruled it.

19

in the record, but it was -- there was a greater number of

20

students that tested --

21

I -- I mean, if you even take the limited amount of

QUESTION:

The only full year that the

Ms. Meoli, didn't we say in Vernonia

22

that in Skinner, which was the railroad employee testing

23

case, we did not demand that it be shown that the

24

particular railroad had a drug problem?

25

was enough that there was a nationwide problem?

Didn't we say it

adverted to that in Vernonia.

4

MS. MEOLI:

Yes, Your Honor.
We said that in Skinner, and we

And -- and Vernonia's evidence as

5

well showed that there was not a specific drug problem

6

among athletes.

7

QUESTION:

I thought the argument in Vernonia

and I thought the opinion in Vernonia, in assessing the

9

particular interest of the district, repeatedly emphasized

the particular problems with the athletes.

There was a

And now you're coming in and saying, well, that

18

-- that really does not matter.

19

the implication of what you're saying is that this so-

20

called special needs requirement will apply to every child

21

in every school in the United States.

22
23

MS. MEOLI:

And it seems to me that

I'm not saying that, Your Honor.

I

-- I think there is a corollary --

25

what you're saying?

But isn't that the implication of

1

MS. MEOLI:

No, Your Honor, I don't.

For

2

instance, you were talking about in Vernonia the athletes

3

were looked up as role models.

4

interscholastic competition in Tecumseh are looked at as

5

role models to some students --

6
7

QUESTION:

Well, the athletes in

Except for one startling difference.

The -- in -- there was a problem with athletes.

Here,

8

one thing that is clear in the record is the -- the school

9

board's admission that the -- that the drug and alcohol

10

problem is more of a problem with those who are not

11

engaged in these extracurricular activities.

12

words, the testing is directed to a group, those engaged

13

in competitive activities, that is less of a problem, as

14

far as drug use is concerned, than the rest of the

15

students who are idle.

16

expect what turns out to be the case, that there's more

17

drug use in the group that's not tested than there is in

18

the group that's tested.

19

MS. MEOLI:

In other

And just naturally one would

Well, Your Honor, we have never said

20

that the -- the students in interscholastic competitive

21

activities are the only students or even the most likely

22

students to be abusing drugs.

23

have in the case demonstrate that they do abuse drugs.

24
25

QUESTION:

But the evidence that we

Well, I'm -- I'm referring

specifically to page 100 and 101 of the joint appendix

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

where the question is whether the students who tend to be

2

involved in drugs are the ones most likely to be choosing

3

extracurricular activities.

4

we have students that are on drugs, and they are in

5

extracurricular activities.

6

are probably more that are not in activities.

7

MS. MEOLI:

And the answer ultimately is,

They are -- they are -- there

That was the testimony of the -- of

8

the board president, Dean Rogers.

9

of James Blue that said he really didn't find that

10

There's also testimony

difference between --

11

QUESTION:

12

MS. MEOLI:
Page 106.

Where is that testimony?
I think it is at page 106, Your

13

Honor.

Now, national studies show that band,

14

vocal and non-athletic extracurricular activities

15

students, they are the least likely of all students to use

16

drugs.

17

would hold true for Tecumseh High School students?

18

answer was, no, I would not.

Would you agree that this same -- the same thing

19

QUESTION:

20

MS. MEOLI:

The

He had no basis for saying yes or no.
Well, yes, he -- he says that

21

initially, and then he goes on to say, I just know that

22

all age levels, all categories -- if we're categorizing

23

the students that frequent the park.

QUESTION:

This part of the

Yes, but he's not saying, as was the

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

case in Vernonia, that here is a group that we can

2

identify that has this problem.

3

particular problem with this group as opposed to all

4

students -- so, my question is if -- if you can, on the

5

absence of any special showing with respect to this

6

extracurricular group, then it seems to me that your

7

argument is really that all students can be tested.

8

mean, there was a special circumstance with the athletes

9

in Vernonia.

Either there's no

I

Your argument for these extracurricular

10

people I think would hold as well for -- for all the

11

students because there's no more of a problem and probably

12

less among those engaged in extracurricular activities

13

than the -- than among the students that don't do anything

14

after school.

15

MS. MEOLI:

Your Honor, the use of -- of drugs

16

among the students in competitive activities was just one

17

of the factors as to why the Tecumseh board selected that

18

group.

19

meeting that the school district held for the community to

20

give input, they asked that same question, why can't we

21

drug test all students?

22

reasons as to why you can't.

23

I really do think that, in fact, the -- at the

And I think there's a couple of

One of the reasons I think is because students

24

in general have a property right in their education.

25

Hence, they have a legal entitlement to a free public

Secondly, the State compels them to be there,

3

and parents, if they do not send their -- their children

4

to school, face criminal prosecution.

there.

testing policy that could have the kind of consequences

7

that would deny them that opportunity or -- or prevent

8

parents from being persecuted for not --

So -- so they are

And I don't think that you can fashion a drug

QUESTION:

Well, if you want --

10

QUESTION:

You don't -- you don't have to go

11

that far, do you, in order to -- in order to justify

12

limiting it to those who participate in -- in voluntary

13

activities?

14

MS. MEOLI:

15

QUESTION:

No, Your Honor.

We -- we --

It seems to me you could say even if

16

we could drug test anybody, we made the choice of giving a

17

student who feels that strongly about not undergoing drug

18

testing the ability to avoid it by simply not engaging in

19

the extracurricular activities.

20

going to school entirely or go to a private school.

21

can simply not participate in extracurricular activity.

22

Isn't that in itself a valid reason for limiting it to

23

extracurricular activities?

24

MS. MEOLI:

25

QUESTION:

Yes.

You don't have to forego

Yes, Your Honor.

You

I --

It's an equally valid argument -- I

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

-- I suppose an equally valid argument would -- for -- for

2

testing everybody would be our object is to stop drug use,

3

not to penalize people who go out for band.

4

some evidence in this record that there is more drug use

5

about the -- among the people who are not going out for

6

extracurricular activities, but among those who do.

7

therefore, if your argument is good for this case, it

8

seems to me your argument, a fortiori, is good for testing

9

everybody in the school.

10

MS. MEOLI:

this program is not to discipline students.

12

catch them.

13

students --

15

18

20

It's not to

It is to deter drug use and to help those

Don't you want to deter drug use

among those who do not go out for band?

17

And

Your Honor, the -- the purpose of

And there's

MS. MEOLI:

Yes, Your Honor, I -- I believe we

Then why isn't the argument good that

do.

you can test everybody?
MS. MEOLI:

Well, number one, I -- I think there

21

is a deterrent effect for implementing this program among

22

the student -- general student body.

23

QUESTION:

24

MS. MEOLI:

25

If they want to --

Well, I think -- go ahead.
If they want to try out or -- or

audition for one of those competitive activities, they

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

know in advance that one of the regulations is to be

2

subjected to drug testing.

3

QUESTION:

No, but with respect, what you're

4

arguing is -- is a justification for the present policy

5

that you've got, and I understand your position there.

6

What I'm interested in and Justice Ginsburg was

7

a moment ago is it seems to me that if -- if we take your

8

argument and we take the evidence that is indicated on the

9

record, there is at least an equally good argument for

10

testing everybody in the school, whether they go out for

11

band or whatnot or -- or do not.

12

the case?

13

And -- and isn't that

That's what we're interested in.
MS. MEOLI:

Well, I think there is a reasonably

14

good argument for that.

15

think --

16

QUESTION:

17

MS. MEOLI:

We're not espousing that, but I

No, I realize --- even though -- even -- even if we

18

utilize the balancing test that was utilized in Vernonia,

19

I -- I think there is a really good argument --

20

QUESTION:

But if we get to that point, then the

21

whole notion of special need has -- has, more or less,

22

evaporated.

23

as -- as in the railroad case.

24

temptation to crime need as in the immigration case, and

25

the special need is simply the need to deter drug use

We don't have the kind of special safety need
We don't have the unusual

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

among all children in all schools of the United States.

2

And -- and if the -- if the theory of this is special

3

need, it seems to me that the concept of special need

4

seems to have gotten lost.

5

QUESTION:

I suppose the distinction that you

6

draw is based on the fact that you have a sanction for the

7

people that you apply it to.

8

participate in extracurricular activities.

9

you applied it to the whole school board -- to the whole

10

school population, rather, you couldn't sanction them by

11

saying you cannot come to school.

12
13

MS. MEOLI:

You can tell them you cannot
But as -- if

Exactly, Your Honor, and -- and that

really is our position because we have to educate the --

14

QUESTION:

But you could say --

15

QUESTION:

And the only sanction you impose is

16

you just can't play in the band or -- or cheerlead or

17

whatever it is they want to do.

18

MS. MEOLI:

19
20
21

You can -- you can remain in the

class.
QUESTION:

So, you have a special burden if you

want to engage in extracurricular activities.

22

MS. MEOLI:

23

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
Or how about taking elective classes,

24

classes that the State doesn't require you to take, but

25

some students might like to take?

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MS. MEOLI:

Well, Your Honor, we have to draw a

2

line somewhere, and -- and even though elective classes

3

are a choice --

4

QUESTION:

Well, I wondered what -- the line

5

that you would draw as a question of the school's policy,

6

but you were saying at least you see a problem with

7

testing everyone because people are compelled to go to

8

school and -- so that's why you resisted drawing the line

9

there.

10

My question is if you're doing a voluntary, then

11

why don't you say as well, you volunteer for -- you're

12

taking a certain course, this is an elective course.

13

thing.

14

MS. MEOLI:

Same

Well -- well, elective courses are

15

really mandatory, Your Honor, in many cases.

16

have your core curriculum that are required for

17

graduation, and you also have your electives.

You need 24

18

credits in order to graduate from high school.

18 of them

19

have to be in the core subjects.

20

electives.

21
22

The rest of them are

But those are required.
QUESTION:

Except for that, it would be a good

idea, though, wouldn't it?

23

(Laughter.)

24

MS. MEOLI:

25

I mean, you

Yes, Your Honor.

I -- I think if --

if we could fashion --

1

QUESTION:

2

MS. MEOLI:

That's what I thought you'd say.
If we could fashion a way to do it,

3

I believe the majority of school boards would be behind

4

it.

5

the 50 States and the states of the compulsory education

6

laws that all the States have, I -- I don't think that is

7

possible.

8

line can be drawn between the students in the general

9

school population and students in extracurricular --

But -- but at the state of the constitutions of -- of

10

So, if a line is going to be drawn, I think the

QUESTION:

May I ask?

Is there any other

11

sanction other than -- other than ineligibility for

12

extracurricular activities?

13

imposed on a student who is found to have been using

14

drugs?

15
16
17

MS. MEOLI:

Is there any other sanction

No -- no, Your Honor, and in fact,

that only happens in this policy under the third time -QUESTION:

So, really the student could say,

18

well, the worst -- if I go out for extracurricular

19

activities and get caught, it'll be back where if I had

20

gone out at all.

21

(Laughter.)

22

QUESTION:

23

MS. MEOLI:

He gets back to square one.
Well, I think -- I think children

24

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

9

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS
MR. CLEMENT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
A school district that reasonably concludes that

10

it faces a drug problem may adopt random drug tests for

11

students engaged in competitive extracurricular activities

12

without violating the Constitution.

13

QUESTION:

Suppose you've had hard statistical

14

evidence to show that the kids that go out for the

15

extracurricular activities are the ones that really do not

16

use drugs, that the high drug user population is in those

17

that don't engage in the activities.

18

your recommendation be to the school board at that point?

19

MR. CLEMENT:

What -- what would

I think in a case like that, it

20

still might be appropriate for the school district to test

21

the students involved in extracurricular activities, and I

22

think that is because, as this Court has emphasized on a

23

number of occasions, by making the -- the testing program

24

applicable only to an avoidable activity, the -- the

25

school district would be ensuring the reasonableness of

19
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

the program under the Fourth Amendment.
QUESTION:

But there's some -- we -- we had an

3

amicus brief by some -- a pediatrics association and so

4

forth that pointed out that students that engage in these

5

extracurricular activities are, indeed, the least likely

6

to be involved in drug use.

7

penalize those students and leave untested the students

8

that are most apt to be engaged in the problem.

9
10
11
12

MR. CLEMENT:
QUESTION:

And it seems so odd to try to

Well --

It's just -- it's so

counterintuitive, isn't it?
MR. CLEMENT:

A couple of points in response to

13

that, Justice O'Connor.

First, there's contrary evidence

14

as well, and the petitioners in their reply brief point to

15

some evidentiary studies that showed that really drug use

16

is distributed evenly across all groups in the student --

17

in the student population.

18

The second thing I would add is that as -- as I

19

was noting in answer to Justice Kennedy's question, there

20

is a sense, and which the majority and Justice Ginsburg in

21

-- in Vernonia emphasized, that by making the program only

22

applicable to activities that are avoidable, you -- you

23

limit Fourth Amendment difficulties.

24

more reasonable.

25

also avoid any difficult questions that might be

You make the program

And as Justice Stevens pointed out, you

occasioned by the consequences of a drug testing program

2

that applies to school-wide.

3

QUESTION:

Well, this in the face of a school

4

district that is certifying to the Federal Government they

5

don't have a drug problem.

6

absolutely odd.

7

MR. CLEMENT:

I mean, the whole thing is

Well, I don't think it's that odd,

8

Justice O'Connor.

First of all, in terms of the

9

certifications, I would direct you to footnote 23 of the

10

district court opinion.

11

that footnote that what those reports really emphasized

12

are the relative natures of the problem.

13

major problem they faced, but in each one of those --

14

those reports, they note that they do have a drug problem.

15

QUESTION:

And the district court found in

Alcohol was the

Well, if alcohol is the problem, why

16

don't they address that?

17

structured in a way to do very little good it seems to me.

18
19
20

QUESTION:

This is just -- I mean, it's

Mr. Clement, do you think any school

in the country doesn't have a drug problem?
MR. CLEMENT:

I would be surprised to find a

21

school district that didn't.

The national figures on --

22

on the -- the amount of drug use are really staggering.

23

As we note in our brief, over half of all 12th graders

24

have tried illegal drugs by the time they graduate from

25

high school.

So, I really think that, you know, if

21
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

anything, the burden ought to shift in these cases to the

2

other side to show that this one school district is the

3

one school district --

4

QUESTION:

Can -- can you tell me --

5

QUESTION:

In both Skinner and Von Raab, we

6

imposed or we permitted the imposition of drug testing on

7

the basis of a nationwide problem, didn't we, without --

8

without showing that the particular entity in question

9

shared in that national problem?

10

MR. CLEMENT:

11

And I would also point out I'm not sure you want

That's correct, Justice Scalia.

12

to put school districts in the business of trying -- when

13

they -- when they find some incidental evidence of drug

14

use, to try to pin it down to the exact extracurricular

15

groups involved.

If a student comes in --

16

QUESTION:

Well, do --

17

MR. CLEMENT:

-- for some sort of anonymous drug

counseling, I'm not sure they want to ask him what groups

19

are you in.

20

QUESTION:

May I ask?

What is your view on --

21

on the validity of a -- a school-wide drug testing

22

program?

23

MR. CLEMENT:

Justice Stevens, we think such a

24

program would be constitutional, but we think the program

25

at issue here --

3

QUESTION:

So, you would differ from the

petitioners then.
MR. CLEMENT:

We -- we do have that difference,

4

but we think a program like this is constitutional for

5

three reasons.

6

additional intrusions on their privacy and have additional

7

safety risks.

8
9

One, extracurricular students agree to

Second, as --

QUESTION:

No.

But you say they agree to it.

They agree to it only under the circumstances that if they

10

don't agree to it, they can't engage in any of these

11

activities.

12

13

agreement is not simply something that is -- is arrived at

14

sort of in the abstract.

15

pressure on them to agree to it.

16

MR. CLEMENT:

They know perfectly well they'll never get
And the -- the

There's -- there's tremendous

Two points, Justice Souter.

17

First, we're not suggesting this is -- this is

18

constitutional because it's consensual.

19

Kennedy, in -- in his separate opinion in the Ferguson

20

case, pointed out that in these special needs contexts,

21

there's an element of voluntariness which is important to

22

the constitutional analysis, even if it's not voluntary in

23

the full sense of the word.

24
25

I think Justice

This -- a second and related point about that,
though, is that these are avoidable programs, and I think

23
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that makes the important difference.

And again, as I

2

noted earlier, because they're -- they're avoidable in

3

that sense, it avoids any difficult questions with the

4

consequences that a positive test might generate.

5

QUESTION:

But it doesn't --

6

QUESTION:

May I ask you a question that -- that

7

is -- concern -- concerns me about the difference between

8

this case and Vernonia?

9

people might expect in the real world, where people know

10

that athletes, professional athletes, Olympic athletes,

11

athletes are tested for drugs, but people who are just

12

everyday people aren't.

13

all the students who are athletes -- they will be treated

14

as athletes are generally.

15

the large population of high school students.

16

MR. CLEMENT:

If we -- if we look at what

So, Vernonia could be regarded as

But that's not true of the --

Well, I mean, I -- I think one

17

fact is that I think it is increasingly becoming true that

18

-- that these sorts of policies are in society as a whole.

19

And one of the petitioners in this case who -- who didn't

20

wanted to be drug tested at school had to go get drug

21

tested for the job at the Kmart, at the McDonald's.

22

do think that probably does have some influence on the

23

reasonable expectations of privacy in this area.

24
25

And I

But I also think that it really doesn't make a
lot of sense to draw a line on -- on sports, and even

24
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

within sports, of course, there are differences.

The

2

Vernonia policy applied to golfers, as well as football

3

players.

4

matter, are tested for substance abuse even on the PGA

5

Tour.

6

are differences in the risks even among the athletes, and

7

I think this Court in Vernonia didn't make anything turn

8

on those differences.

Now, I'm not aware that golfers, as a general

I could be wrong about that, but the point is there

9

The dissent in Vernonia pointed out that there

10

wasn't any evidence of drug use at the grade school in the

11

7th and 8th grade, and that the evidence really wasn't an

12

evidence of a disciplinary problem that was specific to

13

student athletes.

14

was not -- was not moved by those two points.

15

majority said that the evidence was good enough in these

16

contexts.

17

And the majority in Vernonia did not -The

And I think this is an area where deference to

18

the local school boards in their determinations about the

19

nature of the problem, the nature of the solution, and

20

particularly the particular students that are going to be

21

tested is quite appropriate.

22

recognize --

QUESTION:

It's important to

But you would make -- you would make

-- and I think you've said this -- the same argument if

1

in the school.

2

MR. CLEMENT:

I would, Justice Souter.

I do --

3

as I said, I think it's a more difficult question.

4

think the most difficult problem with a school-wide test

5

is what Justice Stevens pointed out, and that would be

6

what are the consequences of a positive test.

7

imagine a school district that -- that faced -- reasonably

8

concluded it faced a serious problem and instituted a drug

9

test where the only ramification of a positive drug test

10

was a confidential notification of the parents, I don't

11

see why that test would violate Fourth Amendment

12

reasonableness.

13
14

QUESTION:

But if you

But at that point, I -- the so-called

special need has become virtually a universal need.

15
16

And I

MR. CLEMENT:

I would like to say two things in

response to that.

17

First, in Vernonia itself, this Court didn't

18

identify the special need as being the drug problem.

19

Court identified the special need as being the school

20

setting, and that's consistent with this Court's decision

21

in T.L.O.

22
23
24
25

QUESTION:

This

And -- and the special need would be

a universal need in every school in the United States.
MR. CLEMENT:

I -- I do think it would properly

recognize that the school context is different, and that

26
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

school boards have a freer hand in testing their students

2

than the Government has testing either employees or its

3

citizens at large.

4

QUESTION:

But if -- if that is the case, what

5

is the danger in the school case, comparable to the -- to

6

the railroad worker's danger or the -- the customs

7

officer's danger?

8

simply the desire to deter illegal drug use?

9

What is the danger as distinct from

MR. CLEMENT:

I think the danger is this.

I

10

mean, it -- and I think Von Raab actually is -- is an

11

excellent counterpoint.

12

you could test the customs official because they are on

13

the front line of the drug problems on the supply side.

14

think by parity of reasoning, children today are on the

15

front lines of the drug problem, but on the demand side.

16

The evidence shows that if you can stop children from

17

using drugs before their 18th birthday, they're not likely

18

to start using drugs after that --

This Court in Von Raab said that

QUESTION:

But if --

used to a drug culture.

22

school.

And the -- the specific danger is unlike with

23

adults.

You're forming -- you're forming their habits for

24

the rest of their life.

25

MR. CLEMENT:

You're raising young people in

I agree with that, Justice Scalia,

27
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

and I would -- I would add that this is not the only

2

context where -- where the Federal Government has

3

recognized that difference.

4

drugs in a school area or selling drugs to a minor are

5

much more substantial than those selling drugs to adults.

6

QUESTION:

The penalties for dealing

I think that's hardly a revelation

7

that the Government is concerned about what drugs do to

8

our culture.

Absolutely, and I think it's

QUESTION:

It's not exactly rocket science, is

it?

13

MR. CLEMENT:

No, and -- and I don't think it's

14

rocket science also to say that that -- that concern is

15

particularly acute with respect to the youngest and most

16

vulnerable members of society.

17

at 21 U.S.C. 859, 860, 861, all of those provisions put

In order to set aside that core Fourth Amendment
principle, I think there has to be some nexus to a

problem, some connection that is demonstrated to a problem

11

either, and preferably both, in terms of safety and drug

12

use.

13

Both of those are missing here.

14

school expanded its initial policy from athletes to

15

16

evenhanded.

17

18

didn't want to stigmatize the athletes alone through the

19

the non-athletes, and so they expanded it.

22

The reason this

Now, that's not a value that this Court has

But let's look at the safety rationale here.

23

Now, in Vernonia, the school board said up front, this is

24

about the safety of our athletes, and that's why we're

25

doing it.

In this case, the school board's testimony and

31
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the testimony of everyone else who has been -- who's --

2

who's testified is that safety is not a reason for this

3

test.

4

is dangerous.

There is nothing about the band or the choir that

5

And this is a very important too that we did not

6

make in our briefs I want to bring out.

In Vernonia, the

7

drug test was for in-season athletic activities.

8

you're playing football, you're drug tested.

9

concerned about that.

While

They were

In this case, they test year in,

10

year out.

11

the policy itself says it is in season and out season.

12

So, there's nothing about the activities of Lindsay Earls

13

in the choir, who's here today, not a drug user -- there's

14

nothing about her activities in the choir that requires

15

her being drug tested.

16

18

If you look at page 198 of the joint appendix,

think that's necessary, but that's the case that we have

2

before us.

3

taken a set of programs and they said, this is a surrogate

4

for consent, and that's what's happening here.

5

-- I think this goes beyond Vernonia.

And so, what the school district has done has

This -- I

6

MR. BOYD:

Right.

7

QUESTION:

But we take cases as they come to us,

8

and in this case, it is clear that the student who is --

9

is so offended by the idea of a search and does not care

10

about the school district's policy of ensuring that drugs

11

are school-free doesn't need to participate in the

12

extracurricular activity.

13

MR. BOYD:

That's their choice.

Well, Justice Kennedy, you're

14

absolutely right.

That's the position here.

And frankly,

15

I think that's what it comes down to for them.

16

have the safety rationale.

17

rationale.

They don't

They don't have the drug use

18

And -- and I would actually point to the -- to

19

your concurrence in the Ferguson case where you -- where

20

you, albeit briefly, survey the special needs in drug

21

testing jurisprudence and point out that in all of those

22

cases, the activity was, in a sense, consensual or

23

voluntary.

24

question in -- in the initial round, too.

25

I mean, this goes back to Justice Scalia's
If you want to

want to be a football player in Vernonia, if you want to

2

run for office in Chandler, these are all activities which

3

you're perfectly free to not do.

4

into the balance, the constitutional reasonableness

5

balance, somewhat but it certainly is not dispositive.

6

And when that's all you have, when there isn't the history

7

of drug use, when there isn't a safety rationale, when all

8

you have is this, then it's nothing.

9

Now, maybe that weighs

Now, I think also I need to --

10

QUESTION:

It -- it seems to me if a school is

11

better than other school districts insofar as drug use,

12

they have less drug use, that they're maybe entitled to

13

keep it that way.

14

MR. BOYD:

Well --

15

QUESTION:

You seem to say not.

You seem to say

16

there has to be some great crisis where we lose a couple

17

years of kids to drugs, and then we -- and then we move.

18

National statistics just don't support that.

19

MR. BOYD:

Well, there -- there are a couple of

20

things.

I mean, first of all, the -- the crisis

21

nationally of drug abuse is one that certainly we need to

22

be concerned about, and I think Justice O'Connor is right

23

to point out that the pediatricians, along with the public

24

health social workers and teachers, all say that this

25

policy of setting up barriers for extracurricular

35
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

activities is actually counterproductive.

2

drug use and other dangerous activities.

3

It promotes

But let me get to precisely the question that

4

you're asking, too.

This is a school that has in place

5

cameras in the halls, security guards, drug dogs that

6

sweep through the school and the -- and the parking lot

7

and the students.

8

teachers who are trained in looking for drug use.

9

have all of these things in place, and they have a

They search lockers.

They have
They

10

mandatory reporting policy that if they discover any drug

11

use, they have to report it.

12

added up to two instances of drugs being found, none of

13

them associated with non-athletes, none of them associated

14

with extracurricular activities.

15

QUESTION:

Now, over the years, that's

Yes, but they have a record here

16

that, of course, suggests if you want to know if drugs are

17

going on in your school, you ask the kids.

18

them because nobody is stupid enough to take them into the

19

school.

20

they ask the kids, and the teachers ask the kids, and they

21

say, sure, there's a lot of drug use going on over in the

22

park, at parties.

You don't find

But it's all around and they use them.

And here

That's the record that I saw.

23

MR. BOYD:

Well --

24

QUESTION:

And I don't really see how that -- I

25

mean, you know, you might be able to drive a millimeter of

36
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

light between that and Vernonia.

2

MR. BOYD:

Well --

3

QUESTION:

So, go ahead and try.

4

But I -- I

can't --

5

(Laughter.)

6

QUESTION:

I mean, I -- I -- they did what I

7

would have done.

8

really going on in this school, and they get a positive

9

response when it's a question of drugs.

10

I would have asked my children what's

MR. BOYD:

Justice Breyer, I -- I think you're

11

right.

I'm going to go ahead and try.

12

there's -- I think there's an important distinction here.

13

What the kids said in this case is, to the extent there's

14

drug use going on, who's doing it?

15

the band and so forth.

16

But I think

It's not the choir and

And I think that that's critical.

I think that the jurisprudence of this Court in

17

looking at when do you set aside individualized suspicion,

18

it says there has to be that connection between --

19

QUESTION:

Why?

Now, I --

20

MR. BOYD:

Why.

21

QUESTION:

Of course, if I read the cases, as I

22

do, and they logically require you to win, that's the end.

23

You win.

24

MR. BOYD:

Sure.

25

QUESTION:

But just in case it's open --

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

(Laughter.)

2

QUESTION:

-- I would like to know why.

I take

3

it they've given you some reasons why they've limited it.

4

One, these are the school leaders and maybe it'll spread.

5

MR. BOYD:

Sure.

6

QUESTION:

Two, we don't want to put the

7

student, although we'd really like to, to the choice of

8

school versus drug testing.

9

of extracurricular versus drug testing.

10

better.

Okay.

We'll put him to the choice
It's a little bit

That's their reason.

11

Now, what do you say?

12

MR. BOYD:

Well, I -- I mean, I think what's

13

perhaps behind your question is a little bit of what's the

14

law and why is the law that way and a little bit of why

15

the policy --

16

QUESTION:

I'll tell you what's behind the

17

question.

18

undoubtedly you're right, that this is a slight expansion

19

of Vernonia.

20

any.

21

way in Vernonia, I'd come out differently here.

22

that's what I want you to --

23

What's behind the question is that I think

You want to say a lot.

They'll say hardly

So, it's hard for me to see why, if I came out one

MR. BOYD:

Okay, fair enough.

And

I -- I think the

24

question is where do you want to put your focus.

If your

25

focus is solely on is there evidence of drug use in the

38
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

still very important.

6

In Vernonia, you had athletes who
You had people
You've

I think there is that difference.

But I think that also I would ask you to focus

7

somewhere different than what is the overall general

8

problem.

9

of the nexus, or connection, being there in order to take

I would say that if you take seriously the idea

10

what is a serious step from individualized suspicion to

11

blanket intrusive search, I would say you have to look at

12

what are the reasons for picking this group.

13

to be fair to the athletes where a problem may exist, or

14

is it -- which is the case here, or is it because there's

15

a problem here, which is certainly not the case here.

16

And there's another difference too, Justice

Is it simply

17

Breyer, which I think is absolutely critical.

In

18

Vernonia, that was a school where discipline was out of

19

control.

20

of this Court has been a critical factor.

21

was a school that said, quote, we don't have a major drug

22

problem for many years, just like this school.

23

in the space of 2 or 3 years, they said, discipline

3

We can't keep control of this

Now, if you look what this school has said, by

4

contrast, let me refer you to the joint appendix.

5

their Federal reports, they say -- now, I'm not talking

6

about the drug use here.

7

They say on page 192, minimal problems have been

8

experienced due to violent safety and discipline problems.

9

That's right in the middle.

10

In

I'm talking about discipline.

And in the very last sentence

on that page --

11

QUESTION:

I don't understand the point of this

12

argument, counsel.

I mean, is -- is the only reason

13

schools want to prevent drug use is that they have unruly

14

classrooms when they have drug use?

15

is the least of the reasons to prevent drug use.

I should think that

16

MR. BOYD:

Well, it --

17

QUESTION:

And -- and what I miss in your

18

argument is any recognition of the fact that we are

19

dealing here with minors.

20

about a search rather than a seizure, but in the case of

21

minors, you can keep them, in effect, imprisoned after

or something else?

a -- it's a world of difference from -- from what -- from

2

what the State can do with regard to adults.

3

MR. BOYD:

Let -- let me -- let me do two

4

things, if I may, Justice Scalia.

5

last sentence of what I was about to say and then I -- and

6

then, if I may have your permission to address the in loco

7

parentis argument, because there's a good answer to that.

8
9

Let me just quote the

In terms of the discipline argument, Justice
Breyer, what the school said is we don't have that

10

problem, and in the last sentence, the discipline policies

11

in place at each site have been effective in dealing with

12

the problems.

13

the only thing, Justice Scalia, but if one of the things

14

we care about is can the kids learn here, is this a school

15

environment that is conducive to learning and safety and

16

discipline, Tecumseh High School has that in hand with

17

their cameras and guards and dogs and everything else.

18

They don't need this policy.

19

it for Lindsay Earls.

20

test all the students, they apparently will get many of

21

them, but why should we force Lindsay Earls to -- to give

22

up her privacy as part of that?

23

So, I think if one of the things, maybe not

QUESTION:

Especially they don't need

I mean, if they want to voluntarily

You're willing to rest your case on

24

the proposition that the only valid basis for conducting

25

drug searches is to -- is to enable the school to maintain

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

discipline.

2

MR. BOYD:

No, no.

3

QUESTION:

So long as you have a bunch a

4

druggies who are orderly in class, the school can take no

5

action.

6

Is -- is that what you want us to -MR. BOYD:

Absolutely not.

Given that we have

7

here a school that has not only discipline in hand, but

8

also drug use itself in hand, especially among these

9

activities, which themselves aren't dangerous, it seems it

10

adds up to me the mirror image of Vernonia.

11
12

But let me address your point, Justice Scalia,
about in loco parentis.

13

QUESTION:

Except for one point that was made in

14

Vernonia, and it does go across the board, and that was

15

the statement that drug testing on suspicion, which is the

16

alternative, because in life, it's everything as compared

17

to what.

18

it would be on individual suspicion.

19

made there that if you had -- if you treated the children

20

that way, you would transform this random process into

21

what the opinion author called a badge of shame, and that

22

it might be worse the risk of singling out the

23

troublesome, but not drug likely student, the one that the

24

teacher -- the one that's always the bad boy in the class

25

and diverts the teachers --

So, if we didn't have the -- the random testing,
And the point was

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. BOYD:

Right.

2

QUESTION:

-- who are engaged in that exercise

3
4

from the job of teaching to being a police officer.
MR. BOYD:

Justice Ginsburg, there's a good

5

answer to that question.

Let me focus on the facts of

6

this case, as they come to this Court.

7

that already has not had this problem of pointing the

8

finger of -- of accusation at students, although it could

9

do that with its drug dogs and locker searches and

This is a school

10

everything else.

11

some suspicion of drug use, say, a -- a drug dog hits on a

12

student who could easily have had dad's beer spilled on

13

the -- on the sleeve.

14

That student is then questioned.

15

this school.

16

When it gets a student for whom there is

That will make a drug dog alert.
That already happens in

But there's also a key point that I think was

17

missed in that -- in that discussion in Vernonia, which is

18

that even if -- whichever way you rule in this case,

19

suspicion-based drug testing can and will go forward in

20

this and many other schools.

21

blanket policy, if there is, say, some malicious teacher

22

out there who wants to -- to pick out Johnny because

23

Johnny is acting bad and -- and put that badge of shame on

24

him, she or he can certainly do that.

25

that is a reason to go ahead with the policy that doesn't

So, even if you have a

I don't think that

43
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

have a basis in the safety, discipline, or drug use

2

rationales.

3

Now, Justice Scalia, I'm feeling like I'm not

4

getting to the in loco parentis question, and I do because

5

the -- the short answer is, I believe the brief by the

6

parents, the amicus brief -- Jean Burkett is the lead one

7

-- really engages this question in a very vigorous and

8

intelligent manner.

9

parentis is a doctrine that does not say the school is the

And what they say is this.

In loco

10

parent, can take over from the parent.

11

retains certain roles, and the parents in this community

12

-- a good number of the parents in this community say I

13

want to raise my kid and I've succeeded so far in raising

14

my kid by having open communication where they can come to

15

me and talk and we will -- and we will have that trust

16

there.

17

by forcing me, the parent, to sign off on this drug test,

18

which is a different way of raising kids.

19

The parent still

The school has interfered with that relationship

QUESTION:

Well, but the in loco parentis

20

argument works against you there too because in loco

21

parentis also indicates that all children are forced to go

22

to this school.

23

MR. BOYD:

Yes.

24

QUESTION:

And we have to accept that a majority

25

of the parents want to make sure that those children are

44
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

in a drug-free atmosphere.

MR. BOYD:

In --

QUESTION:

And they have -- they -- you seem to

4

me to be disparaging about police dogs and locker

5

searches, and maybe that's what you're going to challenge

6

next.

7

said is that this is a necessary and effective policy, and

8

that's -- that's all it said.

9

MR. BOYD:

Justice --

10

QUESTION:

And there are rights of other

But what the -- what -- what the school board has

11

children who want to go to a school which is drug-free, if

12

they can.

13

MR. BOYD:

Absolutely, Justice Kennedy.

14

QUESTION:

And it seems to me that's part of in

15

loco parentis too because those students are required to

16

go the school just as -- as the drug user is.

17

MR. BOYD:

You're absolutely right about that,

18

and please don't hear me to be disparaging of those other

19

tools because those are tools that do not include a

20

blanket intrusive search, which is the principle that's at

21

issue here.

being --

And I actually applaud this school for

Well, why does it make difference why

you applaud it or not?
MR. BOYD:

Oh, it probably doesn't.

It probably

doesn't.

QUESTION:

We're talking about a constitutional

MR. BOYD:

It -- it does.

question.

4

But -- but the point

5

I'm trying to make is that -- is that these other tools,

6

which they have the legal right to use, are being used

7

successfully.

8

In loco parentis I think comes into play when

9

you have a school like Vernonia where, as -- as you put

10

it, Justice Kennedy, the rights of the other students,

11

their ability to get an education and to themselves stay

12

drug-free is being interfered with.

13

talking about the Vernonia school --

14

QUESTION:

Now, if we were

Are you saying that the in loco

15

parentis principle does not apply in the case of a school

16

if a minority of parents object to what the school is

17

doing?

18

MR. BOYD:

That's not my position.

19

QUESTION:

Well, I thought that was what you

20
21

were saying a moment ago?
MR. BOYD:

Let -- let me please try to be more

22

clear about that.

It depends on what the issue is and

23

what's happening in the school.

24

school discipline, say, in the Fraser case or the

25

Hazelwood case, where you had student conduct that was in

When there is an issue of

46
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

a sense -- well, certainly had -- had a element of

2

connection to constitutional protection, but yet affected

3

the rights of other students to be able to learn in that

4

environment, then --

5
6

QUESTION:

Well, how did -- how does Hazelwood

fit that description?

7

MR. BOYD:

Well, because of the disruption that

8

could be caused by the -- by the school paper articles.

9

My -- my point is that where disruption --

10

QUESTION:

I don't think the reason in Hazelwood

11

was -- where the discipline was justified was -- caused

12

disruption, but because when you're learning in school,

13

you follow the instructions of the teacher.

14

MR. BOYD:

Well, and also the form issue.

I

15

mean, I -- I think that's certainly there and I don't -- I

16

-- I brought this upon myself by bringing up the case, but

17

I hope --

18

QUESTION:

19

(Laughter.)

20

MR. BOYD:

21
22

You did, yes.

I did.

I did.

I did and I apologize

for that.
But my point is that the in loco parentis

23

doctrine more broadly comes into play when the rights of

24

the student who says, I want to -- or the minority comes

25

into conflict with -- with the environment of the school

case in Vernonia.

3

certainly not the case if you think of it in terms of the

4

rights of the student --

5

And that's -- that was the

That's not the case here.

QUESTION:

And it's

Now, say again why you -- you think

6

the Vernonia situation, with respect to this point, is

7

different than the Tecumseh.

8
9

MR. BOYD:

Sure.

It's -- it's really the point

I was making to Justice Breyer about discipline in the

10

school.

11

court found that there was a discipline problem that was

12

out of control that was directly tied to drug use by

13

athletes.

14

after the thing that was connected to it.

15

Vernonia had convincingly shown and the district

They wanted to address this problem by going

Now, this is a school that doesn't have any of

16

that.

17

have the drug use.

18

It doesn't have the discipline problem.

QUESTION:

It doesn't

Well, but that -- that question has

19

been batted back and forth -- you're -- you're not saying,

20

are you, that unless the school has the sort of discipline

21

problem they had in Vernonia, it can't do this?

22

MR. BOYD:

No, I'm not.

No, I'm not, although I

23

think that when you have neither a discipline problem nor

24

a drug use problem among the tested students, nor a safety

25

among the students tested, I don't see how you get within

48
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Vernonia at all unless Vernonia sort of quietly,

2

implicitly said what we really meant to say was drug test

3

everybody because those principles do apply to all 24

4

million secondary school students in this Nation.

5

I don't --

6

QUESTION:

May I ask on the drug test?

And so

If you

7

had a choice, in terms of which is the -- I understand you

8

think this is clearly unconstitutional.

9

unconstitutional or less unconstitutional to test

10
11

Would it be more

everybody?
MR. BOYD:

I'm not really sure that one can --

12

can rank more and less constitutional.

13

plainly unconstitutional.

14

go beyond individualized reasonable suspicion is to

15

identify a problem in a school and devise a solution that

16

has a close nexus to that particular problem, and that

17

certainly isn't the case here.

18
19

The only constitutional way to

Let me put that a little bit differently,
Justice Stevens.
QUESTION:

Of course, Justice Scalia would --

21

would respond by saying, well, everybody knows there's a

22

potential problem in every school in the country, and

23

that's enough.

24
25

And why isn't that an effective argument?

MR. BOYD:

It's not -- it's not enough because

what I would say is that it is really that the balancing

test behind the Fourth Amendment reasonableness

2

requirement becomes one where there's no weight on one

3

side of the -- of the balance.

4

let me --

5

QUESTION:

That's a little vague, so

Why is that?

Now, they've come in

6

with a brief on the other side and said, you know, despite

7

the fact that we're spending X billion dollars, two-thirds

8

of which goes on the supply side for interdiction --

9

MR. BOYD:

Right.

10

QUESTION:

-- demand has stayed constant among

11

teenagers, and it's about 20 to 30 percent of all of the

12

children in these high schools who take drugs.

13

you know that that is a fact, why is it -- and if you know

14

this is a typical high school, why isn't that enough to do

15

just what you said would be constitutional, to say here's

16

a particular problem, 20 to 30 percent of the kids are

17

taking drugs, and we want to come in with a solution

18

that's tailored to that?

19

MR. BOYD:

Now, if

Well, it's -- you know, the number is

20

probably, according to Mr. Clement, is more like 50

21

percent, and -- and that 50 percent of -- of the kids in

22

the high schools are using drugs.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

All right.

MR. BOYD:

And --

Then it's much worse than

I thought.

1

(Laughter.)

2

QUESTION:

And then if that -- if that's fine,

3

then -- then there is the problem you talked about, which

4

I just heard you say.

5

problem of a serious sort, and that this is tailored to

6

that problem, they can do it.

7

couldn't they do this on that theory?

8
9

MR. BOYD:

And so, if -- you said if there's a

All right.

So then why

Well, if it's 50 percent nationally,

this school in its reports to the Federal Government says

10

that its school-wide drug use based on its own surveys,

11

which is where the national data comes from, surveys, is 5

12

percent.

13

5 percent.
QUESTION:

All right, 5 percent.

I mean, maybe

14

-- maybe they exaggerated in that report.

I guess I'd

15

have to take the finding of the district court here, and

16

when I read the district court opinion, I thought the

17

district judge thought it was a fairly serious problem.

18

MR. BOYD:

Well --

19

QUESTION:

He didn't put numbers on it.

20

MR. BOYD:

Right, he did not.

21

QUESTION:

But you used the word serious

22
23

problem.

So -MR. BOYD:

Okay.

What -- what I wanted to say,

24

Justice Breyer, is this.

If you take the school at their

25

own word, that their data shows that it's at 5 percent,

51
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

and you take the school board president and all three

2

teachers at their word in saying, to the extent that that

3

drug use -- that 5 percent is there, it tends not to be

4

among these activities, and if you take this Court

5

seriously in articulating a nexus test, there simply is

6

not a nexus between choosing these non-athletes who, both

7

in terms of school versus Nation and the non-athletes and

8

the school versus the other students, are really

9

exceptionally unlikely to be using drugs.

10
11

It's a terribly

poor -QUESTION:

Now, in your opinion a school that

12

did find that it was within, let's say, half the average,

13

say 20 percent or 25 percent, and they did feel that a

14

significant number of their extracurricular activity

15

students were involved in that, if -- if they've heard

16

that through hearsay or any other way that was reasonably

17

plausible for policy makers, they could then do this in

18

your opinion.

19

MR. BOYD:

No, they could not because there

20

still is a need for a safety rationale.

21

single case in which drug testing has been upheld by any

22

court, outside of this line of cases for extracurricular

23

non-athletes.

QUESTION:

There is not a

1

MR. BOYD:

Well, the safety rationale -- I mean,

2

certainly the Court in Vernonia didn't talk about golfers

3

one way or another, but --

4

QUESTION:

Well, but you're -- you're saying

5

that Vernonia was based on a safety rationale.

6

testing included golfers.

7

MR. BOYD:

Its

Well, in Vernonia, the Court talked

8

at some length about the safety rationale.

Justice

9

Kennedy, in his -- in his Ferguson concurrence, also

10

described the Vernonia holding as -- as being about

11

students who are athletes and face these danger risks.

12

Now, reasonableness, Your Honor --

13

reasonableness -- it does need to turn in the end on some

14

kind of reasonable line drawing.

15

reasonable for the Court to say in Vernonia, the line that

16

was drawn by Vernonia among athletes, the vast majority of

17

whom are doing things that, if not involving physical

18

contact, certainly involve exertion of the court, that in

the opinion of the Court could cause death.

drugs?

MR. BOYD:

It absolutely is, Justice Scalia, and

-- and where there's --

8

QUESTION:

Let's not minimize that.

9

MR. BOYD:

I don't mean to, and where there is

10
11

evidence of drug use among a group of students, then I -QUESTION:

As far as -- as far as the extent of

12

the drug use is concerned, this is an elected school

13

board, isn't it?

14

MR. BOYD:

It is.

15

QUESTION:

Why -- why should I trust your

16

assessment of how serious the drug problem is and what

17

measures are reasonable to counter that -- that

18

seriousness over the assessment of -- of the local

19

citizens who -- who elect their school board, and their

20

school board says we have a big enough problem that we

21

want to use this draconian measure?

22

MR. BOYD:

Well, I think if we listen to the

23

school board and to the school administration, who

24

themselves are even closer to that problem, what they say

25

is, we've identified enough of a problem that initially we

54
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

want to test our athletes.

2

to go off and draft a policy for athletes.

3

They came back and he said, you know, we feel kind of bad

4

about stigmatizing our athletes.

5

Now, that's not identifying a drug problem.

6

And they directed Mr. Jacobs
He did so.

Who else can we test?

In fact, the best evidence in this case is what

7

the school itself says to the Federal Government where the

8

Federal Government says, now, remember these reports, when

9

they write them, they say, tell us what you know, not

10

based on just sort of vague evidence, but tell us what you

11

really know about drug use, do some surveys, ask some

12

questions, look around.

13

course of a number of years, they said consistently

14

exactly what Vernonia said back before it had a problem.

15

We don't have any --

The school did that, and over the

And -- and the other school -- and

the other school is they have mandatory testing for

client could go to the druggie school.

25

Would that be constitutional?

MR. BOYD:

And then your

I don't think so because I think even

by the nature of that hypothetical, it presupposes one of

the schools is going to be vastly inferior on a number of

grounds.

MR. BOYD:

Exactly.

MR. BOYD:

It is.

MR. BOYD:

What's the answer to that

I -- I think the answer to the

14

argument is the Fourth Amendment turns on reasonableness.

15

It's not a majority rules standard.

to look at the incremental intrusion here, and this is a

point that I don't think has been made today.

But with

That doesn't answer the question.

20

The question -- yes, it turns on reasonableness, but what

21

Justice Souter's question suggests is that the -- the

issue is whether it would be reasonable for a parent who's

23

concerned about drug use on the part -- on the part of his

24

children, to be this intrusive.

25

MR. BOYD:

That is the question.

MR. BOYD:

The fact that a parent could
