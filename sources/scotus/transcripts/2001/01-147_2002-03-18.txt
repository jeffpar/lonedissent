CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

5

versus Charles Zandford.

Mr. Roberts.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. ROBERTS:
please the Court.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

Stockbrokers like the respondent are

10

the critical link between the National Securities Markets

11

and individual investors who trust brokers to buy and sell

12

securities for their benefit.

13

Respondent betrayed that trust by selling his

14

customers' securities not for their benefit, but for a

15

secret purpose of misappropriating the proceeds and by

16

embezzling the proceeds as he had planned.

17

In so doing, Respondent violated Section 10(b)

18

of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5.

19

provisions prohibit the use of fraud in connection with

20

the purchase or sale of any security.

21
22
23

QUESTION:

Those

Respondent --

Mr. Roberts, could you clarify for me

what the government's position is in this case?
Suppose -- suppose that the broker had not, when

24

he sold the stock, intended to embezzle but then he made

25

the sale and the sale enabled his embezzling.

After

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

selling it, he conceived the scheme to embezzle.

2
3

Is it the government's position that in that
situation a 10(b) would still cover it?

4

MR. ROBERTS:

That embezzlement would not be in

5

connection with the prior sale under the theory that we

6

are asking the Court to adopt here.

7

that it would be a violation of 10(b) under a different

8

theory which isn't a necessary consequence of the one --

9
10

QUESTION:

We don't have to agree with that to

rule for you --

11
12

But the SEC believes

MR. ROBERTS:

You don't have to agree with that

to find a violation here.

13

QUESTION:

Now, the SEC adjudications that you

14

rely upon, what kind of a situation do they involve?

15

they all involve --

16
17

MR. ROBERTS:

Do

They involve both situations, Your

Honor.

18

QUESTION:

Both situations.

19

MR. ROBERTS:

20

QUESTION:

Both situations.

Does the SEC routinely audit brokers'

21

accounts or do spot audits to ensure compliance with the

22

theory you are suggesting here or are they just reactive

23

when they find out about a firm?

24

MR. ROBERTS:

25

audit the brokers.

I am not aware that they routinely

The NASD does do that and then refers

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

matters to the SEC and consults with the SEC.

The SEC

2

also would respond to complaints that they got or take

3

investigations if they had reason to believe it was called

4

to their attention.

5

QUESTION:

And I take it that if the NASD tells

6

the SEC of the existence of a fraud, the SEC can then

7

request the United States Government to prosecute if there

8

is a wire fraud or --

9

MR. ROBERTS:

They could request a prosecution,

10

Your Honor, but it's important that the SEC is the federal

11

agency that's charged with maintaining the integrity of

12

the markets and investor confidence in the markets, have

13

direct authority to prevent and to pursue the kind of

14

fraud that's involved here which is very -- potentially

15

very unsettling to the markets.

16

Because since most transactions are made through

17

brokers, if customers and investors can't trust their

18

brokers to be executing their transactions for the

19

customer's benefit rather than for the broker's benefits,

20

the markets can't function effectively.

21

QUESTION:

Well, do you say then that any fraud

22

by a broker in connection with a customer is actionable by

23

the SEC.

24
25

MR. ROBERTS:

That goes back to the question

that Justice Scalia asked me, Your Honor.

And under the

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

theory that we are advocating here, and for the Court to

2

rule for us here, you don't need to conclude that.

3

SEC does take that position.

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. ROBERTS:

The

Does take what position?
That any fraudulent conversion by

6

a broker from a brokerage account is a violation of 10(b)

7

because it's fraud and it's in connection with the

8

purchase or sale of securities; because the very purpose

9

of the brokerage account is to buy and sell securities.

10

And the broker has access to the customer's assets --

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. ROBERTS:

13

QUESTION:

14

That's quite a leap --- for the purpose of --

That's a leap from any case we've

ever decided.

15

MR. ROBERTS:

That is beyond any case that I'm

16

aware that you have decided.

17

converted the securities by means of fraudulent sales.

18

And his deception not only caused the sales, it was

19

material to the sales.

20

they were fraudulent, coincided with and completed the

21

fraud.

22

But here the broker actually

And the sales themselves, because

And that's very much in tune -- that's really

23

controlled by past cases of the Court.

For instance in

24

the Bankers Life case, the Court held that corporate

25

fiduciaries violated Section 10(b) when they deceived the

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

corporation into believing that it would receive the

2

proceeds of the securities that the corporation sold.

3
4

QUESTION:

But there were misrepresentations

about a particular security.

5

MR. ROBERTS:

That didn't happen here.

There wasn't a misrepresentation

6

in Bankers Life about a particular security, there was a

7

misrepresentation that the corporation would receive the

8

proceeds.

9

Your Honor, only it was by way of an omission or a course

10

And there was that same misrepresentation here,

of conduct rather than an affirmative statement.

11

Because the customers had entrusted Respondent

12

with the authority to trade on their behalf, with the

13

understanding and the implicit representation that he

14

would trade on their behalf and that they would receive

15

the proceeds of the sales, that they would be used for

16

their benefit in other trades when --

17

QUESTION:

So in this case the fraud could have

18

been avoided under your theory if the broker had gotten in

19

touch with the clients and said I'm going to sell this but

20

I'm going to use the money for myself.

21

turned it from fraud under 10(b) into theft.

22

MR. ROBERTS:

That would have

That would have turned it from

23

fraud into theft.

It would have also been a breach of his

24

fiduciary duty if he went ahead and they didn't authorize

25

him.

But just like in O'Hagan --

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

But it wouldn't have been fraud.

2

MR. ROBERTS:

It wouldn't have been fraud if

3

there was no deception.

4

violation that there be deception of some kind.

5

QUESTION:

It's critical to a 10(b)e

Mr. Roberts, there's one point in

6

your reply brief that I didn't quite grasp.

7

is brought by the SEC.

8

MR. ROBERTS:

9

QUESTION:

This action

Yes.

And it hinges on the wrong that was

10

done to the customer.

11

lawsuit, could the customer have sued the broker for a

12

10(b) violation?

13

MR. ROBERTS:

Could the customer bring this very

In this circumstance, yes, the

14

customer could have brought a private action against the

15

broker, Your Honor.

16

circumstance because the customer, a private plaintiff

17

seeking damages has to prove elements of a violation in

18

addition to what the SEC must prove.

19

That wouldn't be true in every

A customer has to show causation of the

20

transaction and loss or damages to the customer.

21

customer also has to be an actual purchaser seller.

22

the situation where there's a sale by the broker of the

23

customer's securities, the purchaser-seller requirement

24

will be met.

25

The
In

But there might not be the damages that are

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

necessary unless the broker follows through with his

2

scheme to misappropriate the proceeds of the sale.

3

QUESTION:

But this time he did.

4

MR. ROBERTS:

5

QUESTION:

But he did.

There's another curiosity in this

6

case.

There was a prosecution for wire fraud, the

7

restitution sought was $10,800.

8

after the broker for a much larger sum.

9

greater sum asked in the wire fraud case?

10

MR. ROBERTS:

And now the SEC is going
Why wasn't a

I don't know, Your Honor, why the

11

restitution award in the criminal action was limited to

12

$10,000.

13

the allegations in the complaint and also from the

14

criminal trial that Respondent did embezzle far more than

15

that amount of the Woods' assets.

16

But it's clear that Respondent, it's clear from

And that's one of the reasons that it's

17

important for the SEC to be able to pursue this action.

18

Because if it had to rely on the criminal action, then

19

there wouldn't be a full disgorgement of the improper

20

gains by the broker.

21

deterrent to this kind of activity.

22

prosecution is significant deterrent, but --

23

QUESTION:

And there would be far less
Of course a criminal

Mr. Roberts, did the allegations of

24

your complaint in this case accord with the narrower

25

theory that you now say is enough to decide this case?

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

That is to say, as I read your description of the

2

complaint, it did not say that the sales of the security

3

were made with the intention at the time the sales were

4

made of absconding with the proceeds.

5

he sold the securities and stole the funds.

6

MR. ROBERTS:

All it said is that

It does -- it does comport with

7

our theory, Your Honor.

It doesn't in so many words

8

allege the intent at the time.

9

allegations in the complaint necessarily give rise to that

But the factual

10

inference.

11

Respondent issued checks to himself on the mutual fund

12

account and that the cashing of those checks caused the

13

sales.

14

Because, first, one of the allegations is that

And so when he took the money, he necessarily by

15

writing the checks to himself, he necessarily had the

16

intent at the time.

17

allegations --

18
19
20

QUESTION:

And then there are additional

Wait.

Excuse me.

He wrote the

checks before the sales were made?
MR. ROBERTS:

In the -- in the mutual fund

21

checks, if you look at Page 28A, of the petition, in

22

paragraph 16 of the complaint, it describes the beginning

23

of the fraudulent scheme in May of 1988, shortly after Mr.

24

Wood was hospitalized as a result of his stroke, and notes

25

that between May and June 1988, Zandford, without the

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

prior knowledge or consent of Wood and Okstulski, issued

2

three checks to himself totaling $41,000.

3

The checks were drawn on a joint mutual fund

4

account held by Wood and Okstulski outside of their

5

Dominick account, and the funds represented therein were

6

obtained through the sale of mutual fund shares --

7

QUESTION:

It doesn't say they were later

8

obtained.

9

that that says that the funds weren't there until the --

10
11

It just says they were obtained.

I don't see

until the checks were written.
MR. ROBERTS:

I think the way that that kind of

12

account works is that it's like a checking account with

13

your mutual funds.

14

checks on the account and the redeeming of the check

15

causes the sales of the mutual funds.

16

whether it precisely states that, that's certainly a

17

reasonable inference or facts that can be proved based on

18

these allegations which is all that's necessary to get

19

past the dismissal of the complaint, Your Honor.

20

You write the check, you write the

But regardless of

And in addition on the other allegations on the

21

next page and the paragraphs on the next page, there are

22

description of repeated sales and repeated conversions

23

over a long period of time.

24

he formed the intent after the sales, although that's

25

unlikely given that this happened after the allegations in

And, you know, one time maybe

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the previous paragraph.

2

think that it's hard to believe.

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. ROBERTS:

But 13 more times, Your Honor, I

Who gets the recovery, Mr. Roberts?
The recovery goes to the -- to the

5

government, but the SEC has a policy of if there are

6

identifiable victims to endeavor to give the victims those

7

-- those funds and to make them whole if they are

8

available.

9

they would do that.

10

QUESTION:

So here where there are identifiable victims,

Well, isn't it a little odd, you have

11

two different branches of the government, perhaps not

12

branches, but two different proceedings, one a criminal

13

proceeding which authorizes restitution.

14

proceeding the decision was made that $10,000 would be

15

allowed, awarded in restitution.

16

And in that

Then the SEC comes along and says, no, that

17

wasn't enough.

18

thousand more.

19

We want to get, you know, several hundred

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, the restitution, first of

20

all, the purposes of restitution and disgorgement are

21

different in that one is aimed on the -- is focused on the

22

making whole the loss to the -- to the people that are

23

injured, whereas the other is aimed at requiring the

24

wrongdoer to disgorge any benefit that he got from the

25

scheme.

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

But in addition, Your Honor, the statute

2

provides for a civil action and gives the SEC the power to

3

do that in order to further its role in ensuring the

4

integrity of the markets and ensuring investor confidence

5

in the markets.

6

individual U.S. attorneys to determine when it's necessary

7

to ask for that kind of a remedy in order to further those

8

purposes.

9

made that determination here.

10

QUESTION:

And it empowers the SEC rather than the

And the SEC properly made that determination,

Well, just to explore the point, is

11

there anything in the record to show that these victims

12

lost only $10,000 and that the broker just made all the

13

rest by churning --

14

MR. ROBERTS:

No.

Their record I think

15

establishes that they lost everything that they had

16

entrusted to him which was 420 roughly, thousands of

17

dollars' worth.

18

QUESTION:

Mr. Roberts, isn't it the case

19

sometimes in criminal proceedings where restitution is

20

ordered that full restitution is not ordered for a variety

21

of reasons, the victim's family -- the defendant's family

22

may have certain needs and the Court may decide, well, I'm

23

just going to order a limited amount of restitution.

24

that happen sometimes?

25

MR. ROBERTS:

Does

Yes, that certainly happens, Your

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Honor.

2
3

Thank you.
QUESTION:

And if the family has needs, the SEC

doesn't have to worry about it, I take it?

4

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, the SEC does its own

5

balancing of what's appropriate to further the interests

6

and it asks for a disgorgement which is an equitable

7

remedy.

8

in deciding whether to award it.

9

Court did determine that it was appropriate to award

10

And the Court takes into account those concerns
And here the District

disgorgement in the amount of $343,000.

11

QUESTION:

It is odd that there was no kind of,

12

apparently no cooperation here, that the criminal case

13

goes on for that limited amount and then the SEC comes in

14

after.

15

in advance about a case like this?

16

Don't the relevant prosecutors talk to each other

MR. ROBERTS:

Yes, they do talk to each other.

17

But the decision, Your Honor, whether to bring the

18

prosecution and what to charge and what to ask for is the

19

decision of the prosecutors, whereas the decision of what

20

is appropriate to pursue as a civil action in order to

21

further the purposes of the securities laws is the

22

responsibility of the SEC.

23

And if the two arms don't necessarily agree that

24

that can all be done in a criminal proceeding, then

25

sometimes a civil proceeding is necessary to accomplish

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the goals and --

2
3

QUESTION:

The SEC is an independent regulatory

agency, isn't it?

4

MR. ROBERTS:

5

QUESTION:

6

So it's not within the control of the

President?

7

MR. ROBERTS:

8

QUESTION:

9
10
11

Yes, it is.

Um --

So if the Justice Department

disagrees with the SEC, the SEC can still go off on its
own.

Is that the way the scheme works in theory?
MR. ROBERTS:

Well, in theory, Your Honor, yes.

12

Although here in the Supreme Court the Solicitor General

13

represents the SEC.

14

here, the Solicitor General has to authorize the action.

15

QUESTION:

And in order for the SEC to come

Is there any limit, if we have a

16

broker, a licensed broker, is there any limit at all or

17

just any fraud by a licensed broker falls within 10(b)?

18

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, again, I'd like to reiterate

19

that to decide this case and under the theory that we are

20

advancing here, you don't need to reach that.

21

under the other theory that I alluded to, there are limits

22

to what would be covered.

23

But even

For instance a broker could defraud customers by

24

convincing them to pursue an investment advisory

25

relationship.

And that would not be -- that would not

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

necessarily be covered.

2

In addition, the broker might defraud the

3

customers of assets that are outside of the brokerage

4

account and that aren't securities because the broker has

5

developed a relationship of trust with the customer.

6

wouldn't be covered under the other theory.

7

That

In addition, the broker, I guess it's a similar

8

thing, the broker could defraud the customer into making

9

some other kind of investments, real estate investments,

10

because of the relationship of trust that had developed.

11

But the SEC has consistently taken the position

12

that with regard to brokerage accounts and the brokerage

13

relationship that involves the purchase or sale of

14

securities and that exists for the purpose of the purchase

15

or sale of securities, that it is a violation when the

16

broker defrauds its customer.

17

QUESTION:

Suppose the -- suppose Zandford were

18

not a licensed broker, he just was pretending to be a

19

broker but he wasn't at all.

20

said, I'm a broker, give me your money; and the same thing

21

happened?

22

MR. ROBERTS:

He went to these people and

That would still be -- and then he

23

-- they gave him the money and he purchased securities and

24

then sold the securities?

25

QUESTION:

Yes, but he's not licensed to sell

16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

any.
MR. ROBERTS:

That would still be a violation,

3

Your Honor, because he would have the same fiduciary

4

relationship with them by virtue of them making him their

5

agent for securities transactions and entrusting their

6

assets to him to engage in securities transactions.

7

when he sold for the secret purpose of misappropriating

8

the proceeds rather than for their benefit, and he did not

9

disclose that he was doing that, he would be deceiving

10

them in connection with the sale of securities, just as

11

Mr. Zandford did here.

12

under these circumstances.

If there are no further questions, I would like
to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.
QUESTION:

Very well, Mr. Roberts.

Mr.

Goldblatt, we'll hear from you.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN H. GOLDBLATT
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GOLDBLATT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
We do not dispute, I don't think it can be

22

disputed, that this conduct obviously is covered by any

23

number of laws, civil, criminal, state, federal, the rules

24

of this self-regulatory organization, and the Court below

25

recognized that as well.

But it treated the question of

17
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

whether or not Mr. Zandford was also liable under Section

2

10(b) as a different question requiring a specific proof.

3

And it is that proof that the Court found wanting.

4

In that regard, I think it's also important that

5

one of the pivotal factors in our theory of the case was

6

that this was a discretionary account.

7

relying on the bare facts alleged in the wire fraud

8

circumstances, there was no investment decision being made

10

And the SEC was

And under those

by the victims in this case.

11

And we argued to the Court below and we submit

12

to this Court that that's a pivotal distinction in 10(b)

13

context.

14

And if no one is being defrauded in the decision they are

15

making as to the purchase or sale, all that leaves the SEC

16

with in this case is the conversion of the proceeds.

17
18

Because 10(b) deals with investment decisions.

QUESTION:

Well, the District Court granted

summary judgment in favor of the SEC as I understand it.

19

MR. GOLDBLATT:

20

QUESTION:

21

And the Court of Appeals reversed and

in effect granted summary judgment for Mr. Zandford.

22

MR. GOLDBLATT:

23

QUESTION:

24
25

That's correct.

That's also correct.

So you have to take the allegations

in the complaint as true at that point I think, don't you?
MR. GOLDBLATT:

Mr. Chief Justice, we don't

18
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

think so, because those allegations were not being

2

considered by the Court of Appeals.

3

various points has indicated in its pleadings that the

4

facts alleged in the indictment were the same as the

5

complaint, and that may have caused part of the problem.

6

But the only facts alluded to by the Court of Appeals as

7

you indicated is in effect granting summary judgment to

8

the non-moving party.

9

I think the SEC at

In that regard, there's no reference at all in

10

the opinion of the Court of Appeals referring to any of

11

the facts in the complaint.

12

QUESTION:

They refer to the indictment.

Well, should there have been some

13

reference to the facts in the complaints since they were

14

about to render summary judgment against the SEC?

15

MR. GOLDBLATT:

That may well be the case.

The

16

problem we have with that is the question of issue

17

preservation.

18

ordinarily -- in the ordinary case, if you reverse an

19

order granting summary judgment, you obviously don't grant

20

summary judgment to the non-moving party; you remand for

21

further proceedings.

22

When the SEC petitioned for rehearing,

But when the SEC moved for rehearing and

23

rehearing en banc, it did not raise the issue with the

24

Court as to why it had remanded with instructions to

25

dismiss.

So on this record you really don't know what the

19
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

reasoning of the Court of Appeals was.

2

QUESTION:

But wouldn't they have to, Mr.

3

Goldblatt?

4

there's been nothing beyond the complaint doesn't --

5

mustn't you listen to the facts as pled in the complaint?

6

This -- a complaint to be thrown out when

MR. GOLDBLATT:

Justice Ginsburg, my point is,

7

is that the question that I think that is presented in

8

this case is whether the SEC by its own actions limited

9

itself to the facts asserted for purposes of summary

10

judgment which were the facts in the indictment.

11

Now, if the Court of Appeals is operating under

12

the assumption that that was their case, it could, if that

13

was their case and it was clear that was what it had to

14

consider, if it concluded those facts were insufficient as

15

a matter of law, that would be the only rationale in light

16

of its opinion which only considered the facts in the

17

indictment.

18

QUESTION:

But the government's petition here

19

sets forth some facts.

22

did you?

23

MR. GOLDBLATT:

MR. GOLDBLATT:

And so it -- and in your

Yes, I did.

You did?

What did you say?

I challenged the -- in our brief

20
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

in opposition, we challenged any consideration of any

2

facts beyond the indictment, that any issue with regard to

3

facts in the complaint were not before the Court of

4

Appeals and were not relied on by the SEC.

5

QUESTION:

But that just seems weird in a way.

6

I mean, this is a civil action.

7

tried on the facts and an indictment in the criminal case

8

as opposed to as alleged in a complaint in this very case

9

seems odd.

10

MR. GOLDBLATT:

And to insist that it be

I absolutely agree.

But the

11

question is not so much whether that was of the making of

12

the Court of Appeals or whether that was of the making of

13

the SEC.

14

that that was the SEC's position, that they were narrowing

15

themselves to the indictment, and that's what the Court

16

considered.

17

And I think it was the Court's understanding

But regardless, even with the facts, I mean, if

18

I'm wrong on that, regardless of the facts even with the

19

facts that the SEC relies on from the complaint, you

20

essentially have the same problem.

21

And again, it's not a question of whether this

22

conduct is covered.

23

But for purposes of 10(b) as the SEC now concedes, this

24

would also affect private actions.

25

It's covered under the broker rules.

And in that regard, these facts simply do not

21
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

meet the paradigm for a 10(b) violation which is either

2

that somebody is duped into buying or selling a security,

3

a particular security, because that's the paradigm for the

4

statute, or in limited circumstances such as a case like

5

O'Hagan, where it affects market integrity, the Court has

6

also found liability.

7

QUESTION:

But that's in a situation --

Suppose that the customer comes to

8

the broker and says, here's 100 shares of the ABC Company,

9

sell these shares for me and put the money in your broker

account.

And the broker, before he sells, has the intent

11

to take the money for the broker's own account.

are the instructions from the client to the broker -- I

4

implicit instruction.

5

That's the

The client says sell for my benefit.

And here

6

the stockbroker sells for his own benefit.

What's the

7

difference between that case which is this one, and the

8

one Justice Kennedy is submitting?

9

MR. GOLDBLATT:

I think the difference is for

10

purposes of the 10(b) paradigm it requires that the sale

11

be induced by the broker for fraudulent reasons.

12

he's doing is converting the proceeds --

13

QUESTION:

If all

14

emphasized about 50 times, not simply stealing.

15

have is a sale of stock where the stockbroker has the

16

intent when he sells the stock to keep the money, contrary

17

to what the implicit assumption is about what the client

18

wants.

19

What we

Now, that seems to be a little extra thing here

20

so we don't have to reach all these broad issues.

21

what do we -- that's what I find indistinguishable.

22

MR. GOLDBLATT:

Now,

Justice Breyer, here is the

23

distinction that I would draw.

In the Bankers Life

24

situation where you have the sale induced, the 10(b)

25

violation is complete when the sale is made.

24
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

In the situation you describe, until and unless

2

the broker, having followed the instructions and sold the

3

stock, until and unless he actually converts the proceeds

4

to his own use, you don't have a 10(b) violation.

5

QUESTION:

Why don't you?

I mean, if we could

6

ever prove it?

7

a mind-reading machine, sold the stock in order to convert

8

the proceeds, puts the money in the account and then dies.

9

I mean, you know, it's a little weird, but nonetheless if

10

we could ever prove such a thing, why wouldn't that be a

11

violation of 10b-5?

12

Suppose in fact the broker, because we had

MR. GOLDBLATT:

Because until and unless he

13

actually converts the proceeds, he hasn't violated 10(b).

14

He has not done anything against his client's

15

instructions.

16

QUESTION:

He hasn't?

He has converted -- he

17

has sold the shares, contrary to the instruction, sell

18

them for my benefit, for his own benefit.

19

MR. GOLDBLATT:

My point is that until he

20

actually converts, while that money is still in the

21

account, while the stock has been sold consistent with the

22

directions, until and unless he actually converts the

23

proceeds to his own use, he has not violated 10(b).

QUESTION:
of the proceeds.

But what about, never mind the taking

Suppose you have a broker who for some

something else sells stock in a customer's account where

it didn't really make sense to sell it.

The only benefit from selling it is a benefit

for the broker himself.

7

Would that be covered by 10(b)?

8
9

MR. GOLDBLATT:

His brother-in-law is with a

I think that would be covered by

10(b).

10

QUESTION:

Well, why isn't that the same

11

situation here?

Because this sale was not a sale -- never

12

mind the later theft -- the sale was not a sale for the

13

benefit of the customer which is what he's promised to do.

14

He's promised, I'll manage these stocks for your

benefit.

QUESTION:

Well, does it have to be

2

inconsistent?

Do you have to prove that they were

3

inconsistent with the interest or is it enough to prove

4

that the broker did not act in the customer's interest?

5

Isn't that enough for the breach of the fiduciary duty?

6

Even if it turns out that, what do you know, it was a good

7

idea to sell, the market crashes, nonetheless he was

8

guilty of a fiduciary breach if he didn't sell it because

he thought it would help the customer but he thought it

would help him.

In that situation, regardless of

MR. GOLDBLATT:

QUESTION:

No, but --

The broker has authority to sell but

he has authority to sell in the interest of the client.

counselor or broker and says, you make the decisions, I'm

giving you blanket authority, and that's what we have in

2

this record; in that situation, that takes you out of the

3

10(b) paradigm.

4
5
6

QUESTION:

Well, it's true in effect that not

every breach of fiduciary duty is a fraud.
MR. GOLDBLATT:

That's correct.

Not every

7

breach of fiduciary duty is a fraud, and not every breach

8

of fiduciary duty will violate 10(b).

9

QUESTION:

But in your paradigm, you are saying

10

the authorization is induced by fraud and that's crucial.

11

But in -- why don't you have the equivalent of it here?

12

Because what you have here is a continuing

13

authorization.

14

at the beginning and the theory is that that authorization

15

continues so that at every moment subsequent to that the

16

client is saying yes, you may sell these things or buy as

17

you see fit for my benefit, so that at any moment at which

18

the client remains silent and allows that authorization to

19

continue, if at that moment the broker has formed the

20

intent, which you would take to be sufficient, why doesn't

21

that function in the same way as the authorization

22

specifically induced?

23
24
25

There is an authorization generally given

The client is being quiet and he's continuing
the authorization because the broker is implicitly lying.
MR. GOLDBLATT:

Justice Souter, my answer to

29
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that is this:

2

you have a discretionary account to invest conservatively,

3

if a broker then goes and buys a penny stock, that is

4

outside the scope of the discretionary authorization and

5

it would be a violation of 10(b).

6

If it is shown, in other words, assuming

QUESTION:

What the --

Well, it's outside of the

7

authorization at the beginning because the authorization

8

under no circumstances covered that kind of a sale.

9
10
11

MR. GOLDBLATT:

Yes, it was outside the scope of

the authority.
QUESTION:

But the term of the authorization

12

that I'm saying is crucial, and what I thought you were

13

saying is crucial in the case that you succeed is the term

14

of the authorization that in effect says, you may sell

15

this stock for my benefit.

16

specific decision to that effect is induced by fraud,

17

that's enough.

18

And you are saying if a

It gets you within the rule.

And I'm saying if a continuing decision, a

19

decision evidenced by the client's silence is induced,

20

that should be sufficient too.

21

MR. GOLDBLATT:

And one of the things that the

22

Court of Appeals found here was that that was not

23

established.

24

checks were written, the Court concluded there was nothing

25

in the record to conclude that those sales --

Okay.

Then maybe this case should

2

come out your way.

3

the same case whether it's a continuing authorization or

4

an authorization which is specifically induced?

5

But as a matter of theory, isn't it

MR. GOLDBLATT:

In either situation if you can

6

show that the sale itself is a violation of that

7

authorization or a breach of it, yes.

8

the Court was very careful on that in saying not only that

9

this was a discretionary account, but in light of the

But in this case

10

allegations in the indictment there was just no proof in

11

the record that any of these sales were in violation --

12
13
14

QUESTION:

Yes, but you are going back to the

indictment and ignoring the complaint.
MR. GOLDBLATT:

Even with the complaint there's

15

really nothing in the complaint that they are relying on

Well, the course of conduct, one

transaction after another is relevant; isn't it?
MR. GOLDBLATT:

20

we are not talking -- the time factor is actually from

21

March of '88 to September of '90.

22

there's just nothing in the record -- we don't even know

23

what the securities were that were bought or sold.

And

24

that's the problem with their theory of this case.

It's

25

overarching in where it goes.

MR. GOLDBLATT:

It was simply payable to

broker or accounts controlled by the broker.

evidence establishes in the record on affirming the appeal

14

that's what I was doing with the money, and they knew

15

about it and that's what that was.

16

And that's what Zandford's

These were other legitimate investments and

QUESTION:

So they can't -- you are saying they

can't trace any proceeds necessarily from the checks drawn

18

into Zandford's personal accounts or --

19

MR. GOLDBLATT:

Well, they -- the way they

20

describe it, it goes to accounts controlled by Zandford.

21

So they do indicate that the conversion of the proceeds

22

into other investments was fraudulent.

23

QUESTION:

Well, let me just see what your

24

theory is here.

Suppose the way it works is that there's

25

a mutual fund account and the broker decides, I want to

security.

I write the check that causes the sale of the

5

Under your theory, is there a 10b-5 violation?
MR. GOLDBLATT:

If the writing of the check is

unauthorized, it's going to be a 10b-5 violation.

6

QUESTION:

Everybody knows he didn't -- the

7

client didn't authorize the broker to take a pleasure

8

cruise.

That's my hypothetical.

9

MR. GOLDBLATT:

Then it would be a 10b-5e

10

violation.

11

evidence that the sale itself of the securities by the

12

writing of the check established a 10b-5 --

13

What the Court found lacking here was any

QUESTION:

But it's alleged properly.

I mean, I

14

read on Page 29A, in July -- there's a misprint in the

15

paragraph, but in July 1998 Zandford without the prior

16

knowledge or consent of -- must be of Wood -- sold three

17

securities in the Wood account for a total of $145,000.

18

What their claim is, is that without the client's consent,

19

the broker sold the securities and then after that he used

20

the proceeds for himself.

21

theory, that alleges a violation of the securities law.

22

Is that right?

23
24
25

MR. GOLDBLATT:

All right.

Now, on your

Under my theory, that would

allege it.

MR. GOLDBLATT:

But the Court of Appeals

found --

3

QUESTION:

Fine.

Then the correct thing of

4

disposition in your view of this case, since the

5

allegation is there, and since the Court of Appeals said

6

that the criminal case didn't investigate this matter

7

about whether it was or without the client's consent, your

8

view is we should have a remand so that they can have a

9

trial on the question of whether Mr. Wood did consent to

10

the sale.

11
12

Is that right?
MR. GOLDBLATT:

No, Justice Breyer, that's not

right.

13

QUESTION:

Because?

14

MR. GOLDBLATT:

Because two things.

One, the

15

Court of Appeals found that there was no evidence because

16

it was a discretionary account, that there was anything

17

unauthorized about it.

18

QUESTION:

There wasn't any consent needed.

Of course there was no evidence.

19

That's because the government relied upon the criminal

20

case.

21

on that.

22

correct result is to send it back so now the government

23

has a chance to put in other evidence, if you are right

24

about what the evidence shows.

25

So the Court of Appeals says they are wrong to rely
Then as you pointed out at the beginning, the

MR. GOLDBLATT:

In the ordinary course I would

Alderson Reporting Company

1

agree with that.

All other things being equal, that would

2

be the result.

3

posture chose to rest exclusively on the criminal

4

indictment, this other case --

5

QUESTION:

But if in fact the SEC by its litigation

You mean there is something in this

6

record where the SEC says, by the way, if this criminal

case does not provide sufficient evidence, we do not

intend to put in any other evidence.

that?

10

MR. GOLDBLATT:

Where does it say

It doesn't say that.

There are

11

representations that the criminal case is the same as the

12

civil case.

13

argued to the Court that if this is all they have, if the

14

criminal indictment is -- yes, in the Court of Appeals.

15

If this is all they have, then there's nothing to send it

back for.

provisions, statutes, there's no question about this.

3

This conduct is controlled.

4

doubt about that.

5

And also the SEC's litigation posture is different.

6

they are going to give up the facts in the complaint and

7

argue the case on the indictment, in a strategical attempt

8

to get the Court to rule the way they want, which is the

9

broadest possible 10(b), then they have got to live with

QUESTION:

it wrote an opinion, which usually gives the reason why

the Court of Appeals did what it did.

that they didn't say anything on rehearing?

20

MR. GOLDBLATT:

Are you complaining

What I'm saying is when this

21

comes up for the first time in the opinion of the Court of

22

Appeals and they file for rehearing, and they don't even

23

bring it to the attention of the Court so that the Court

24

can determine whether there is something to be corrected

25

or whether this is the Court's understanding from oral

Well, but I don't know that they have

to.

don't know that you need have a petition for rehearing in

MR. GOLDBLATT:

Ordinarily I would absolutely

11

agree, Mr. Chief Justice.

12

that comes up in the opinion from the Court of Appeals

13

that on its face doesn't have any explanation that

14

basically says instead of going back so you can prove your

15

case, we're throwing it out completely, and they don't say

16

a word to the Court of Appeals, that's the wrong remedy.

17

I mean, that's the first thing --

QUESTION:

But Mr. Goldblatt, the Court of

turned on a notion that in order to have a violation of

22

merits of a certain security, something tied to the

security, and not that they regarded this as a common law

crime as theft.

The

question presented is whether when the stockbroker sells

10

Now, do we have to assume he sold them for his own benefit

11

at the time the sale was made or are you saying in fact he

sold them for his principal's benefit and later decided to

appropriate the proceeds?

MR. GOLDBLATT:

saying is there is no proof in this record that at the

MR. GOLDBLATT:

I would disagree, Justice

Souter.

On this record it may well be that it was for his

benefit, but I don't think you can conclude it was not for

4

his client's benefit as well.

5

QUESTION:

Mr. Goldblatt, before you sit down,

6

would you say something about the fact that you have

7

adjudications by the SEC that adopt the theory that they

8

are arguing before us, why shouldn't we defer if the

9

question is a close one?

10

MR. GOLDBLATT:

11

QUESTION:

As I understand it --

These are formal adjudications under

12

the Administrative Procedures Act and they have ruled in

13

accordance with the theory that the government is now

14

arguing.

15

Why isn't that entitled to deference?
MR. GOLDBLATT:

Justice Scalia, assuming -- and

16

because my time has run out -- assuming that Congress in

17

fact delegated the discretion to the Agency, I don't think

18

you can find in any of the various things that they rely

19

on, any rule dealing with 10(b) or Section 10b-5 that

20

speaks to the precise issues that are raised in this case

21

or even close to them.

22

that in 16 or so cases, or whatever the number, they have

23

prosecuted for 10(b) violations brokers who convert.

24

they are not necessarily, as a matter of fact I don't

25

recall any of them being discretionary accounts or

What they do is they have rules

2

with a purchase or sale of securities.

3

QUESTION:

So you are saying we can defer it,

4

but there's nothing to defer it to.

5

MR. GOLDBLATT:

That is correct.

Assuming there

6

is deference, there's nothing to defer it to, and if there

7

was, it would be a rule that they are ultimately asking

8

for that a broker any time they convert from the account

9

violates 10(b) and that would be arbitrary.

That is not

10

the way this rule is applied.

11

12

don't think it gets them the deference they seek.

QUESTION:

Mr. Roberts, we have apparently some,

2

I would call it a factual disagreement, as to whether any

3

adjudications by the SEC adopt the theory that you are

4

arguing before us today.

5

MR. ROBERTS:

What are your best cases?

Okay.

I would point to, on page

6

36 of our brief we discuss the Southeastern Securities

7

Corporation adjudication, Your Honor, from 1949, seven

8

years after the SEC promulgated Rule 10(b).

9

In that case the facts were that the president

10

and director of the brokerage firm sold the customer's

11

securities without her knowledge or consent and converted

12

the proceeds of the sale to his own use.

13

explaining that there was a relationship of trust and

14

confidence and that he had a fiduciary duty, the SEC

15

addressed the argument that this conduct was authorized

16

because he had discretion over the customer's affairs by

17

virtue of a general power of attorney, and rejected that

18

argument, noting that even assuming the power of

19

attorney's validity, it didn't authorize this conduct

20

absent a showing of full and specific disclosure to and

21

understanding consent by the customer.

22

And after

And then the Commission concluded that the

23

stockbroker's taking and sale of the customer's securities

24

and his use of the proceeds constituted a willful abuse of

25

his trust and a violation of --

Yes.

There's a violation at the

time of the sale.

11

QUESTION:

Okay.

12

MR. ROBERTS:

The discretionary authority

13

doesn't make the sale authorized because he's authorized

14

only to sell for the benefit of the customers.

15

QUESTION:

Well, I mean, it seems to me that's

16

logical and that sort of makes me worry about -- about the

17

great scope of litigation that we are inviting if you say

18

civil actions not by the Commission but by individuals are

19

also available under this theory.

20

Whenever a broker sells stock, he's always open

21

to the charge that he wasn't doing it in my interest, he

22

was doing it in his own, and you have a lawsuit.

23

MR. ROBERTS:

Two -- two points to address that

24

concern, Your Honor.

First of all, as I was discussing

25

with Justice Ginsburg earlier, when there is -- a private

48
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

action requires proof of damages.

2

doesn't follow through with his plan to convert the

3

proceeds, there will be -- it will be frequently the case

4

that the customer can't show damages and needs to be able

5

to allege those as a required part of the action, couldn't

6

bring it at all, end, case over.

10

QUESTION:

And if the broker

Well, the stock's gone up.

I mean,

the stock that has been sold has gone up enormously.
MR. ROBERTS:
QUESTION:

Right.

And all the plaintiff has to allege

11

is you really didn't sell it in my interest, you sold it

12

because you were going to run off with the proceeds, and

13

look what happened, the stock went way up.

14

MR. ROBERTS:

No, Your Honor.

Under the Private

15

Securities Litigation Reform Act, the plaintiff has to

16

state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong

17

inference that the defendant acted with the requisite

18

fraudulent state of mind.

19
20
21
22
23

QUESTION:

Well, are you saying that every

breach of fiduciary duty is a fraud under 10(b)?
MR. ROBERTS:

No, Your Honor.

Only secret or

deceptive breaches of fiduciary duty are frauds.
QUESTION:

What about a standard churning case?

24

Aren't most breaches of fiduciary duty secret?

I mean,

25

you don't announce that you are breaching a fiduciary

What happens with standard churning

cases?

MR. ROBERTS:

This is -- this is just like a

A churning case is

Well, is there authority that this is

And that's a

Yes.

that in this case.
MR. ROBERTS:

Well, you are not addressing

churning because obviously that's not here.

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, again, Your Honor, churning

12

13

scenario because there are repeated sales and because the

14

proceeds aren't taken.

15

could be drawn between when the proceeds are taken and if

16

the proceeds -- if it isn't a question of taking the

17

proceeds but just making a commission, which the customer

QUESTION:

And I suppose that a distinction

I have no doubt that churning is covered.

The

necessary, Your Honor.

So you

MR. ROBERTS:
