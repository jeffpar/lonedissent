ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOEL D. BERTOCCHI
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10

MR. BERTOCCHI:

11
12

Am I pronouncing your name

Good morning, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
The local telecommunication provisions of the

13
14

Telecommunications Act of 1996 introduced competition into

15

local telephone markets.

16

and 252.

17

interconnect, and requires incumbent carriers to enter

18

into agreements that will provide access to their

19

competitors to those incumbents' networks.

20

The act did so in sections 251

Section 251 imposes the obligation to

Section 252 prescribes procedures under which

21

those agreements, contracts, as they are, are negotiated,

22

arbitrated, approved, and filed, and the act stops there.

23

It does not go on to interpret -- to discuss

24

interpretation or enforcement of those agreements.

25

From its title through its text, section 252

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

demonstrates that Congress was silent regarding

2

interpretation and enforcement.

3

interpretation is not unaccounted for, because into that

4

silence, under preexisting law, stepped the States.

5

preexisting law, still good under the 1996 act, not

6

preempted or repealed by it, provides that the

7

interpretation of these contracts is a State law process

8

which has been deliberately left by Congress to State

9

regulators, including State judges, who will apply State

10
11

Nonetheless,

That

contract law to those provisions.
QUESTION:

Can I ask a very preliminary, quick,

12

I hope -- and I hope you'll have a conclusive answer.

13

can't get an answer.

14

you won below.

It's a procedural matter.

15

MR. BERTOCCHI:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. BERTOCCHI:

18

QUESTION:

I

I take it

We --

You won on the merits.
Yes.

All right.

Now, I've always thought

19

that you appeal from a judgment, basically.

20

now under the Seventh Circuit says, you win.

21

you're saying is, their reason was the wrong one.

22

should have won because there was no jurisdiction or there

23

was a Fourth Amendment bar.

24

MR. BERTOCCHI:

25

QUESTION:

The judgment
But what
We

Yes, Your Honor.

And the reason they gave for our

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

winning was wrong.

2

that kind of thing.

3

reasoning all the time.

4

appeal from the reasoning of an opinion, as opposed to the

5

judgment, we'd be here 700 days a year, so -- and I can't

6

find a case where that happened, so is that -- and I hope

7

there's a conclusive answer to what I say, because it's

8

terrible if the case washes out for that reason.

9

Well, I didn't think you could appeal
Judges make mistakes in their
I do, too, and if you could

MR. BERTOCCHI:

Your Honor, I believe the

10

conclusive answer is that our assertion that there was no

11

jurisdiction over us and that we -- if there was

12

jurisdiction over us and over this cause of action, we are

13

asserting immunity as a claim that we can bring regardless

14

of the result on the merits.

15

QUESTION:

And is there any precedent at all

16

where that's ever happened before?

17

MR. BERTOCCHI:

Your Honor, I cannot -- I'm

18

afraid I cannot cite you to any.

19

questions are preserved regardless of the merits.

20

cannot point you to --

21
22
23

QUESTION:

I believe that these
I

Does the opinion below cause you some

kind of continuing injury?
MR. BERTOCCHI:

Well, it does, Your Honor, in

24

the sense that it is going to, if it stands, result in our

25

continuing to be brought to Federal court, in spite of the

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

immunity that we assert, and it is going to continue to

2

place these cases in Federal court even though we believe

3

that they are properly State court cases completely, and

4

that our State court should have the opportunity to review

5

these, to review all the matters that are raised, and to

6

fulfill both their duty to apply State law and their

7

obligation to consider whether their State law

8

construction in any way is inconsistent with Federal law.
QUESTION:

9

There's a patent case in 307 U.S.

10

that says -- where the lower court ruled both on

11

infringement and on the validity of the patent, and the

12

person who sought to -- had won on one of them.

13

Court said you could have a decision on the other point.

14

That might be of some help to you.

15

MR. BERTOCCHI:

16

This

I appreciate that, Your Honor,

and I will have a look.
QUESTION:

17

Except, isn't it the ordinary rule

18

that when -- there may be a special consideration in that

19

patent context, and maybe yours is also, but I had thought

20

that reasons that went against the judgment winner do not

21

get any kind of preclusive effect, so that you would not

22

be bound by this jurisdictional holding which was against

23

you.

24

so you don't -- you're not stopped, precluded from

25

relitigating the case.

You prevailed on the merits, you have that judgment,

In other words, the two go

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

together.

2

by it.

3

If you can't appeal it, then you're not bound

Isn't that -MR. BERTOCCHI:

I understand, Your Honor.

I

4

believe, though, that we -- that the district courts of

5

the Seventh Circuit would consider themselves bound by the

6

Seventh Circuit's decision, and we would have to go to

7

court to litigate that, which we believe would be a

8

violation of our immunity, and in addition, we believe

9

that the jurisdiction would not be there, and by doing

10

that we would essentially be being kept out, as we have

11

been kept out of our State courts for at least some period

12

of time, and in that sense I believe that there is a

13

continuing injury that results from this.

14

QUESTION:

Your injury results at least in a

15

formal sense from the fact that, in order to get the

16

review which the companies sought, they made your State

17

regulators defendants in a case, is that correct?

18

MR. BERTOCCHI:

They subjected them to -- the

19

individual commissioners to suit and made them defend

20

their rule, yes, sir.

21

QUESTION:

But the essence of what they were --

22

the essence of what the companies were claiming was not

23

some kind of right asserted against the State as a

24

sovereign entity or against these regulators in official

25

or individual capacity.

The essence of what was going on

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

was an attempt to review in effect a regulatory decision.

2

Why does that implicate immunity in the sense that we

3

usually think of immunity in Eleventh Amendment issues to

4

be implicated?

5

MR. BERTOCCHI:

Your Honor, I think it does so

6

for two reasons.

7

complaint that Ameritech filed, Ameritech asserted in its

8

complaint that it had been injured by the actions of the

9

State commissioners.

10

First, if you take a look at the

QUESTION:

Well, but that's -- anyone who loses

11

a case has been injured by the actions of the judge who

12

made a mistake of law, or by the regulator in a regulatory

13

case, so that in itself doesn't take it out of the usual

14

attempt simply to get review of a judicial or a quasi-

15

judicial decision that you say is wrong.

16

MR. BERTOCCHI:

That's correct, Your Honor, but

17

the result -- the other thing that the complaint does is,

18

it names the individual commissioners as defendants.

19

subjects them to the jurisdiction of the Federal court,

20

and it raises issues as to whether -- which we have argued

21

at great length in all of our briefs, as to whether that

22

violates sovereign immunity.

23

QUESTION:

But that's a formality.

It

It seems to

24

me that by naming them the -- those who are appealing are

25

doing nothing more than saying, look, these people in

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

their adjudicatory capacity made a mistake, we want that

2

mistake reviewed, in the same sense that people work their

3

way up through levels of appeal in the judicial system,

4

and that certainly is not a classic example of the kind of

5

implication of State sovereignty which the immunity

6

doctrines and the Eleventh Amendment have addressed.

7

guess I'm saying, is this really a case that implicates

8

Eleventh Amendment immunity?

9

MR. BERTOCCHI:

I

Your Honor, we believe it does.

10

I will admit that as things have turned out, in light of

11

the fact that the district court and the Seventh Circuit

12

did not disagree with the decision of the commission,

13

there have -- none of the parade of possible bad things

14

have happened to us.

15

against us.

16

this point there might not be an award of attorney's fees,

17

but that's because of the way the case came out.

18

There has been no injunction entered

There has been no contempt proceeding.

QUESTION:

At

Is it your position that the private

19

parties could have brought the case to the district court

20

without naming the commission?

21

MR. BERTOCCHI:

Your Honor, not in this

22

interpretation case, no.

23

parties, but we believe that because we believe these are

24

State actions and that we are -- and we are necessary

25

parties under State law to administrative review.

We believe we were necessary

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

But does that, again, put you in any

2

different position from a State commission in a run-of-

3

the-mill utilities case, even within -- let's say just

4

within the State system, to keep it simple?

5

maybe all States, if there is an appeal from a rate order

6

the regulatory body can be represented by counsel and say,

7

you know, we got it right, don't reverse us, but they are

8

not regarded as parties to litigation in the classic

9

sense.

10

In some,

So you could have been -- I guess what I'm

11

saying is, you could have been heard, which is one of the

12

consequences of the way they went about this procedurally,

13

but you could have been heard without being a party in the

14

usual sense.

15

MR. BERTOCCHI:

Your Honor, given the fact that

16

this was a Federal court reviewing a State proceeding, we

17

might well have been able to be heard if the district

18

judge had allowed us in, and again, as I indicated -- and

19

I believe this is still in response to the question -- it

20

has turned out that because the district court agreed with

21

us, nothing has happened to us that doesn't happen to us

22

in State court when our decisions are affirmed.

23

But in State appellate proceedings from Illinois

24

Commerce Commission orders, when the appellate court

25

disagrees, it enters a decree that invalidates or in some

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

way amends or remands the order.

2

relief that is contemplated in the full range of a Federal

3

equity suit in which commissioners are named as

4

individuals or even, I would submit, in a case in which

5

the State commission were named as a party.

6

That is not the type of

In this case, Ameritech did not sue the State

7

commission, for reasons I'm not quite sure I understand,

8

but we're willing to, because we're here, assume that the

9

commissions are -- commissioners are an acceptable

10

substitute, but even in that instance, the order is

11

entered by the tribunal, by the appellate tribunal on the

12

State side against -- an order is entered that simply

13

supervenes the commission's order.

14

In this instance, Ameritech filed a complaint

15

asking for the Federal court to enter orders that are

16

specifically directed at the commissioners and, if they

17

had sued the commission, would have been specifically

18

directed at the commission.

19

believe is contemplated by the statute, but we also think

20

it's significantly -- it could be significantly different.

21

It hasn't turned out that way -- excuse me.

22

turned out that way in this case, because the district

23

court and the Seventh Circuit have agreed on the merits,

24

but it could have, and that was our concern, and that is

25

why we are here, because we don't know how it's going to

That is relief that we don't

It hasn't

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

turn out in the next case.
Your Honors, these proceedings, interpretive of

2
3

the contracts as they were, did not take place under

4

section 252.

5

under section (e)(6) and, indeed, limits any application

6

of (e)(6).

7

have devoted a substantial amount of energy to this, but

8

really it does not make any difference if we are talking

9

about an action, a case, a determination, whatever it is

10

that the commission does still must be done under 252 in

11

order for jurisdiction to attach under 252(e)(6), and in

12

that respect the text and scope of section 252 is plain.

13

It goes as far as the filing, the formation and filing of

14

the agreement --

It does not make any difference -- respondents

QUESTION:

15
16

That qualifier is critical to jurisdiction

Where do we find section 252 in the

briefs?
MR. BERTOCCHI:

17

Your Honor, if you take a look

18

at the blue brief in -- we've attached both sections 251

19

and 252 as an appendix, and 252 starts at page 12a of that

20

appendix.

21

QUESTION:

Suppose that you're in the State

22

court and you've won, and they've sued you in the State

23

court, and then suppose that their claim is the following,

24

the agreement as interpreted by the commission does not

25

meet the requirements of section 251, including the

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

regulations prescribed in the FCC pursuant to section 251,

2

and then the judge asks you this question:

3

is the law that says it has to meet the requirements of

4

section 251, including the regulations prescribed by the

5

FCC pursuant to section 251?

6

the answer?

7

MR. BERTOCCHI:

Counsel, where

Where is that law?

What was

Your Honor, if we're talking

8

about an interpretation case, the answer is essentially a

9

combination of State law, which now makes compliance with

10

Federal law, with the act, a requirement, and the general

11

requirement that in any case that a State court hears, it

12

not contravene Federal law.

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. BERTOCCHI:

That law --

It's not in 252?
No, Your Honor, it's not, if we

15

are talking about an interpretation.

16

language into 252 is to suggest that an interpretation is

17

really a modification, and I think those things are very

18

distinct concepts of the law.

19

To read that

If it happens during an approval process, that's

20

different, but that would be my response.

I think in the

21

end the result would be the same, because the State court

22

is clearly required in any case, and certainly in one of

23

these cases, to determine whether it -- its decision, its

24

construction of the contract follows Federal law.

25

what the commission did in this case, and that's what the

That's

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

Illinois appellate court would do.
QUESTION:

Are you saying that in a post

3

determination interpretation case, that the commission

4

doesn't look to 251 and 252, it can't look there?

5

MR. BERTOCCHI:

It -- well, Your Honor,

6

interestingly enough, in this case it can't, because this

7

was -- the provisions that deal with reciprocal

8

compensation in this case were negotiated, and they're not

9

required to comply with the act,

but even in a case where

10

there had been an arbitration, and where there was an

11

issue with respect to that, I believe that certainly the

12

commission -- certainly the court could look to Federal

13

law and see if there was anything that didn't comply with

14

251 and 252.

15

QUESTION:

I mean, it's just a very odd concept

16

that the State commission launches this vehicle having

17

looked at the Federal law, and then subsequent

18

interpretation doesn't involve Federal law.

19

that's just hard for me to understand.

20

MR. BERTOCCHI:

It's just --

I think the interpretation will

21

involve Federal law in many instances, Your Honor, but the

22

interpretation cases are going to be driven by State law,

23

and this case is another good example of that.

24
25

In this case, the way the commission, I think,
looked at this case is the proper way.

They construed the

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

contract first and then determined whether their

2

construction violated any Federal law, including FCC

3

rulings, and decided that it did not, so I am not at all

4

suggesting --

5

QUESTION:

6

I think that's the question.

7

having construed it, well, you know, this is really what

8

it says, but boy, if we interpret it this way, it violates

9

the act?

10
11

What if they had decided that it did?
What if they had decided,

Then what do they do?
MR. BERTOCCHI:

Then I think that they would

have to construe it differently.

12

QUESTION:

13

I mean, it says what it says.

They would have to --

How can you construe it differently?

14

MR. BERTOCCHI:

15

QUESTION:

Well, they cannot -- they are --

So then they're not doing

16

construction any more, they're doing application of

17

Federal law.

18

MR. BERTOCCHI:

I think, Your Honor, in that

19

instance, if they wanted -- if the contract could survive,

20

what they would do is, they would say the Federal law

21

superseded whatever State contract principle they applied

22

in construing it in the first place.

23

QUESTION:

Well, there isn't any Federal law of

24

contracts.

There may be a lot of Federal law of

25

telecommunications, but the two could certainly be

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

regarded as separate, I think.
MR. BERTOCCHI:

2
3

Exactly, Your Honor.

There is

not a law --

4

QUESTION:

And if they came to that conclusion,

5

that although they construe the law of contracts to have

6

reading A, nonetheless reading A violates or does not

7

violate the Federal statute, do you still maintain there

8

is no Federal jurisdiction to review that, neither under

9

the provision at issue in this case nor under 1331?

10

MR. BERTOCCHI:

11

QUESTION:

We do maintain that, Your Honor.

Even though it's no longer an

12

interpretation question?

They are no longer interpreting

13

the contract.

14

having interpreted it this way, we find that this way

15

violates Federal law, and therefore we disallow it, and

16

there's still no review of that --

17

MR. BERTOCCHI:

18

QUESTION:

-- under 1331?

19

QUESTION:

Well, it seems to me your position

They have interpreted it, but they say,

Yes --

20

on 252 and in response to your question from Justice -- is

21

very likely well-taken.

22

harder to defend.

How do you defend that?

MR. BERTOCCHI:

23

I think your position is 1331 is

Well, Your Honor, with respect

24

to section 1331, we start our analysis back at section

25

252.

We believe that -- and I think that the case that

16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

comes closest to describing the way this would work is the

2

Jackson Transit case.
Jackson Transit -- in Jackson Transit, the Court

3
4

seemed to assume 1331 jurisdiction but went on to say, we

5

have to take a look at congressional intent to determine

6

whether those contracts which are required to be in place

7

by Federal law, whether litigation over whether those

8

contracts are binding and what they mean should take place

9

in Federal or State court, and we believe, again, that the

10

silence regarding interpretation in section 252 and the

11

remedy provided in section 252(e)(6) suggests that that is

12

the remedy that Congress intended to be made available.
QUESTION:

13

But you're relying on silence

14

regarding interpretation, and in the hypothesis we were

15

just discussing, it was no longer an interpretive

16

question.

QUESTION:

Having decided it, they moved

Yes, Your Honor --

You say they have to move to that

22

second question, and if they do, they just override their

23

interpretation, but that's no longer an interpretive

question, it seems to me, at that point, so your

25

distinguishing of section 252 doesn't --

1

MR. BERTOCCHI:

Your Honor, I -- it is no longer

2

an interpretive question, but the proceeding is still an

3

interpretive proceeding.

4

type of proceeding that leads to approval and ends at a

5

very particular point.

6

We read 252 to cover a certain

Respondents point out that this is not the end

7

point for disputes under the contract, and that is

8

certainly likely to be true, but it is the end point for

9

how far 252 goes, and the fact that Federal issues may

10

come up afterwards does not change the fact that Congress

11

in 252(e)(6) provided a very specific remedy that was

12

designed to review matters that were decided in the

13

approval process.

14

restriction operates both with respect to 252(e)(6) and

15

suggests that it applies under -- that a limitation should

16

be placed on 1331 jurisdiction as well.

17

QUESTION:

We believe that that jurisdictional

But it suggests there's a large

18

lacuna between the approval process and the interpretation

19

process, which is -- you know, I can understand how you

20

can construe 252 that way, but I think you have to read

21

252 as precluding 1331 jurisdiction, and I think that's a

22

more difficult question.

23

MR. BERTOCCHI:

It is more difficult, Your

24

Honor, but I believe that that's what it does.

25

talking about --

We're

18
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

Isn't it -- isn't the difficulty

2

this, that -- I mean, we don't lightly imply a negative on

3

1331 jurisdiction, and it's perfectly possible to read the

4

sentence in subsection (6) as simply saying, whatever the

5

State commission may do in applying these two sections

6

gets Federal court review, and going no further than

7

simply to make it clear that you do get Federal court

8

review of it, in effect as a regulatory matter.

9

read it that way, which the text certainly allows you to

10

If you

do, 1331 stands.
MR. BERTOCCHI:

11

Your Honor, I believe that to

12

read it that way and then -- and to include

13

interpretation, enforcement proceedings under it would

14

essentially read the words under 252 under the statute.

15

Certainly there is a difference between the language, the

16

word determination and the language in the actual

17

preemption provision in (e)(4) that says, approvals or

18

rejections, but -- and the respondents argue that that

19

suggests that determinations is a broader term.
Our position is that it doesn't matter whether

20
21

it's a broader term, but our -- that if it's not under

22

252, it doesn't matter what kind of action it is, and

23

interpretations and enforcements are not covered by that

24

statute.

25

far and no further.

It's a very particular statute that goes only so

19
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

In addition, it seems that that argument and the

2

use of those words is somewhat inconsistent, because the

3

United States suggests that the more specific terms in

4

(e)(4) suggest that determinations must mean anything that

5

happens in a case related to these contracts, but it seems

6

to me if approvals and agreements in (e)(4) is a narrow

7

term, then approvals and agreements, which is all 252

8

addresses, is -- must be read equally as a narrow term,

9

and it's inconsistent to say that determinations under 252

10
11
12

goes beyond that.
QUESTION:

Well, approvals, agreements and

You would agree that would be covered, too?

13

MR. BERTOCCHI:

QUESTION:

15

MR. BERTOCCHI:

16

QUESTION:

Yes.

Yes.
Yes, Your Honor.

And did you say -- did I understand

17

you correctly to say that if this particular issue had

18

come up at the time of approval, then there would be

19

Federal court review, so if something -- the character of

20

the issue has nothing to do with it.

21

comes up in one proceeding, Federal court, if it doesn't

22

come up simultaneously, the very same question doesn't

23

come up simultaneously, then you have this split.

24
25

MR. BERTOCCHI:

It's just, if it

Exactly, Your Honor.

We believe

that that procedural difference is the basis for the

20
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

distinction, but we believe that that distinction is

2

entirely rational is in accord with what happens in the

3

life of contracts.

4

In real life, in contracts outside the context

5

of telecommunications, issues will come up in negotiation

6

and maybe there'll be a contract and maybe there won't.

7

If the same issue comes up once the contract is in force

8

and the parties can't reach an agreement, which they have

9

the opportunity to do in any case, then they have to go to

10

court, someone has to go to court to get it enforced, so

11

the notion that the timing of an issue affects where it's

12

going to be litigated is not at all surprising, and is

13

entirely consistent with what we believe Congress' intent

14

was in 252.
QUESTION:

15

Yes, but in an ordinary private

16

contract, if the State court refuses to enforce the

17

contract, let's say on the ground that it would be a

18

contract combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade

19

and thus violate the Sherman Act, you would be able to get

20

review of that determination in Federal court, wouldn't

21

you?

22

But you're saying that this contract can be

23

overridden and disallowed by a State court on a Federal

24

ground with no review of that Federal ground by any

25

Federal court, so that you can have different

21
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

interpretations of the Sherman Act all around the country,

2

with no Federal court being able to review it.
MR. BERTOCCHI:

3

Your Honor, my belief is that if

4

a State court invalidated a contract on Federal grounds,

5

appeal would be to the State appellate court, and the

6

Federal court that would be able to review that

7

determination if it was wrong is this Court, so there is

8

always going to be a Federal court that can determine

9

that.

What -- and the --

10

QUESTION:

We can review it because there is a

11

Federal question involved --

12

MR. BERTOCCHI:

13

QUESTION:

14

no Federal question involved?

15

If that were --

-- but for purposes of 1331 there's

MR. BERTOCCHI:

For purposes of 1331, there may

16

be Federal issues involved, but we believe that there is a

17

specific congressional intent, reflected in the

18

specificity of 252 -- you can look at it as silence, or

19

you can look at it as specificity -- in the specificity of

20

252 to have these matters litigated in State court, and

21

again I would cite Jackson Transit for the proposition

22

that whether there is an arising under question under 1331

23

does not mean you still don't look to the question of

24

where the contracts are litigated.

25

In that case, the contracts had to be there

22

because of Federal law.

They had to be honored because of

2

Federal law, but there was a legislative intent that was

3

discerned by this Court to have those -- the binding -- to

4

have the litigation concerning those contracts take place

5

in State court.

(Laughter.)

13

QUESTION:

I'm going to ask the same question.

14

QUESTION:

In order to win your 1331 point, you

15

have to show that Congress really wanted this

16

interpretation that you're giving of 252, right, it really

17

wanted it and had a pretty good reason for it.

18

MR. BERTOCCHI:

19

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

What's the reason?

I mean, it

20

creates a pretty big mess, doesn't it?

We're going to get

21

into a new jurisprudence of what's an interpretation and

22

what's an approval, and you're going to start splitting

23

the documents apart and it sounds to me like a mess, and I

24

don't know why -- maybe Congress wrote those words, but

25

why would they want such a thing?

23
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. BERTOCCHI:

Your Honor, I think they would

2

want such a thing because the Telecommunications Act

3

represents a change in the way utilities are regulated,

4

and although everybody agrees that that is true, I think

5

that the respondents misapprehend the change.

6

is to reduce regulation over the parties to

7

telecommunications transactions once access is assured.

8

The interest in this case was access, and once that's over

9

with, these are to be -- these cases are to be treated, I

10
11

The change

believe, like regular contracts cases.
This case, again, is a good example.

It was

12

driven by State law and the Federal questions came up

13

afterwards in determining whether the construction was

14

proper, and in that instance I think Congress intended to

15

leave the matters to State -- to the State commission

16

under State law and to State courts.

17

QUESTION:

No, but that still doesn't explain --

18

I mean, you've still got the mess that Justice Breyer

19

referred to.

20

kind of bifurcation that makes for all of this confusion?

21

Why would Congress want to legislate that

would want to do it because it recognized that most of

these cases were going to be like this one.

QUESTION:

MR. BERTOCCHI:

Well, Your Honor, I think --

this, in the sense of State courts deciding, construing

6

these contracts and then deciding any incidental Federal

7

law questions under their normal obligation to do so.

8

Yes, we think that's what they wanted, and we think that's

9

what they wanted because they would recognize, as in this

10

case, that these cases are State-law driven.
The goal of the act is access.

11

This case is not

about access.

MS. McDOWELL:

commissions are acting by authority of section 252 when

they're construing and enforcing interconnection

They have no other authority under Federal

law to do that.

Do they have authority under State

If we asked the Solicitor from

authority by which the State commission proceeded in this

18

(Laughter.)

19

MS. McDOWELL:

Well, we don't have to guess,

20

because the State commission specifically said what

21

authority it was proceeding under, and it cited both

2

Ms. McDowell, I have a problem with

other language in this (e)(6).

One of the arguments you

make is that it doesn't make any sense to bifurcate these

5

proceedings, that they should all be in the Federal court,

6

the interpretation as well as the approval.

7

is, the only thing that (e)(6) allows the Federal district

8

court to determine is not the interpretation of the

contract.

The problem

It does not give the Federal court authority to

determine what the contract says.

statement meets the requirements of section 25 and this

It only gives it

Now, in some cases, there may be a dispute

between the parties as to whether a particular

nothing to do with whether there's a violation of the

Federal rules.

to go to State court, and all of the contract cases that

permissible as well under the supplemental --

It's still

Well, there may be some such

cases, but as I was suggesting, there are alternatives to

that.

In addition, there may not be that many cases in

10

which there's a viable claim that a State commission has

11

interpreted an agreement contrary to Federal law.
These cases have typically come up only with

12
13

respect to this particular issue of compensation for

14

Internet calls, a very important issue to the carriers,

15

and one that they've been willing to litigate extensively,

16

but it's not clear at this early stage in the

17

implementation of the 1996 act that there are going to be

18

a large number of claims of this sort, so the thought that

19

there are going to be -- there's going to be a bifurcation

20

problem in every case is not clear, at least at this

21

stage.

I'm still not entirely clear on what

We haven't yet taken a definitive

10

position on this question, Justice Stevens.

Ameritech is

11

arguing that these contracts, interconnection agreements

12

are pervasively Federal, similar to a Federal tariff, so

13

that every question that arises under them is necessarily

14

Federal.
We think for purposes of this case, and what the

15
16

court of appeals decided, what's relevant are only those

17

claims that contend that a State commission has violated

18

the 1996 act in its interpretation of an agreement, so

19

there may be a large category of cases that can come to

20

State court and that would present only issues of State

law.

The State is a necessary party because it goes first

through the commission?

MS. McDOWELL:

We don't think they're necessary

QUESTION:

District judges aren't parties to an

MS. McDOWELL:

That's correct, and certainly

Federal statutes are often challenged in cases in which

the United States is not involved.

10

QUESTION:

But if the FCC were performing this

11

role -- take Virginia's statement -- and you are appealing

12

the FCC's order, all those cases are you against the

13

14

Isn't it -- isn't that routine?

MS. McDOWELL:

That's correct.

That's the

15

standard practice in the Federal system, and when the FCC

16

acts in the place of a State commission the FCC's

17

decisions will be reviewable in a proceeding in the court

18

of appeals under the Hobbs Act, in which the FCC is named

19

as a party.

understand it, and most States as well, that the agency

21

issuing a decision will be a party to proceedings

QUESTION:

And the -- I mean, I take it the

reason you assume that is that the commission is not a

party in interest in the sense of having a personal stake.

5

They have the same kind of stake, I suppose, that any

6

judge does when an order of his gets appealed, but that's

7

their only interest.

8

MS. McDOWELL:

That's correct, Your Honor.

If I could turn briefly to the sovereign

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. SMITH

6

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS WORLDCOM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.,

7

MCI WORLDCOM NETWORK SERVICES, INC., MCIMETRO ACCESS

8

SERVICES LLC, AND FOCAL COMMUNICATIONS CORP.

9
10
11

MR. SMITH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The complaint that Ameritech filed in this case

12

in Federal court specifically alleged not only that the

13

ICC had misinterpreted the interconnection agreements at

14

issue, but also that its order requiring payment of

15

reciprocal compensation for a particular category of calls

16

violated several specific sections of the

17

Telecommunications Act as well as several allegedly

18

applicable FCC rulings.

19

For that reason, our position, and I'm arguing

20

today for WorldCom and several other companies who had

21

signed interconnection agreements with Ameritech and also

22

were sued as codefendants along with the ICC, our position

23

is that the complaint stated straightforward preemption

24

claims alleging ongoing violations of Federal law by State

25

officials and therefore those claims were within Federal

39
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

jurisdiction and also actionable notwithstanding the

2

Eleventh Amendment.

3

Where we differ with Ameritech and actually with

4

the final respondent AT&T is on the question that was

5

being discussed earlier, which is the scope of valid

6

Federal claims in enforcement cases, and specifically

7

whether a claim of mere misinterpretation of an

8

interconnection agreement raises any Federal issue or not.

9

Our position is that in most cases, at least, a claim of

10

misinterpretation of an interconnection agreement would

11

raise claims only under State common law contracts and

12

therefore has to be treated as a State law claim, but in

13

terms of this case, since the contract -- the complaint

14

did allege violations of the statute and FCC rulings,

15

there certainly was jurisdiction, we believe.

16
17
18

Now, let me turn first to the jurisdiction
issue, and then I want to get to -QUESTION:

Before you get into that, you're

19

separating interpretation of the contract from violation

20

of the Federal law.

21

MR. SMITH:

22

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
Does that mean the State still has

23

control over what the contract means?

It's still a State

24

contract, and the ultimate determiner of what the contract

25

means ought to be the State, if it's State law, right?

40
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. SMITH:

Certainly it ought to be done by

2

virtue of some analysis of the intent of the parties, if

3

it's a negotiated agreement.

4

which are imposed through arbitration, and then the

5

commission is essentially analyzing its own intent in

6

imposing --

7

QUESTION:

There also are agreements

Yes, but different States have

8

different approaches.

They may even have different rules

9

of evidence and so forth.

What's going -- I don't see how

10

the Federal Government gets into this business without

11

taking on itself the burden of interpreting these

12

contracts.

13

MR. SMITH:

Well, Congress, Your Honor, very

14

specifically turns over responsibility for developing

15

these contracts, reviewing them, to State commissions, and

16

in the process of doing that says that while the State

17

commissions have to follow various substantive standards

18

in 251, they also are authorized in more than one place in

19

the act to impose their own policies that are not

20

inconsistent with the Federal policies, and it also said

21

the parties can negotiate agreements notwithstanding the

22

substantive provisions of the act, and that the State

23

commission can't overturn them unless they find that they

24

violate the public interest and necessity.

25

So what you have here is a very clear

41
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

recognition by Congress that they want these to be real

2

contracts, not merely orders applying Federal standards,

3

and that there will be lots of issues which under this

4

Court's ruling should be viewed as State law contract

5

issues that will come up in the enforcement proceedings,

6

so we don't see any basis under Jackson Transit and this

7

Court's other cases dealing with the development of

8

Federal common law for saying that the contract

9

interpretation rules, the rules for determining how the

10

contract ought to be read, ought to be elaborated as a

11

matter of Federal common law in the Federal courts rather

12

than through analysis of State common law which already

13

exists.

14

Now, these cases will be sometimes in Federal

15

court and sometimes in State court, because there will be

16

some times when there are Federal claims that are brought

17

that can sustain a motion to dismiss.

18

think these claims would have sustained a motion to

19

dismiss, but --

20

QUESTION:

I don't happen to

What if you have a case in which one

21

of the arguments made by one of the parties is that if you

22

interpret the contract this way, it will violate the

23

Federal act?

24

that a Federal question?

25

Does that stay in the State court, or is

MR. SMITH:

I see that as a Federal question,

42
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Your Honor.

I don't think there's any question about

2

that.

3

The district court and the court of appeals, of course,

4

rejected that on the merits, but their claim was that this

5

interpretation was barred by the FCC's interpretation of

6

the act.

That is essentially what Ameritech claimed here.

QUESTION:

7

Well, I mean, interpretation is

8

barred?

9

plainly on its face says something that violates the

10

I mean, if a contract says something, it very

Federal act, there's only one way to interpret it.
MR. SMITH:

11

Their claim was that even if that is

12

what the parties intended, that Federal law had evolved to

13

the point where that was preempted by Congress, or by the

14

FCC.
QUESTION:

15

I just don't understand how you play

16

that game.

I mean, you're assuming that it's always

17

ambiguous whether you can interpret in a -- so that you

18

can interpret it in a way that violates Federal law or in

19

a way that doesn't, and that somehow therefore that

20

interpretation becomes a Federal question.

21

correct, it's certainly not always true that there is the

22

possibility of interpreting it in a way that does not

23

violate Federal law, and I guess you're saying that

24

nonetheless, in that case, the case becomes a Federal

25

case.

Even if that's

43
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. SMITH:

I'm not sure I really meant to say

2

that every case becomes a Federal case.

3

lots of situations in which the interpretation as done by

4

the commission is then a matter -- whether that's correct

5

or not is a State law issue.

6

I think there are

What I meant to answer in response to your

7

question was then, if a party says that interpretation of

8

what the parties really intended has somehow brought the

9

contract into some inconsistency with applicable FCC

10

regulations, that's a Federal claim.

11

the commission says, we think they probably intended this,

12

but we're not going to do that because we think Federal

13

law requires us to do Y instead of X, that also raises a

14

Federal question.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. SMITH:

At the same time, if

Okay.
But if they're merely looking at the

17

intent, there will be lots of situations where there isn't

18

any Federal preemption because the law, after all, says if

19

you negotiate it, the substantive provisions of 251 don't

20

apply.

21

State law contract issues which will be then analyzed by

22

the State commission and, absent some additional Federal

23

issue that comes along, the place where that would be

24

appealed would be the State court, in my understanding.

25

In most of those situations, you're going to have

QUESTION:

And it could not be appealed in the

Federal court?
MR. SMITH:

Unless there was some odd situation

involving diversity, my sense is -- my understanding is -QUESTION:

Well, I guess the claim would be,

5

look, the very contract that you're interpreting is a

6

contract which is authorized, and authorized only by

7

Federal law, and that's enough to get us into Federal

8

court, and you reject that position.

9

MR. SMITH:

Our position, Your Honor, is that

10

under Jackson Transit, that the fact that the Federal

11

statute requires that a contract exists but doesn't

12

specify the terms of the contract, in that situation the

13

contract itself remains a matter of State law.

14

QUESTION:

Well, aren't we slightly outside of

15

that situation, because there are some Federal standards

16

here, aren't there?

17
18

MR. SMITH:

Well, actually, as to negotiated

contracts, the Federal standards --

QUESTION:

20

MR. SMITH:

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. SMITH:

They can be --- are very, very loose.
I see.
It has to either be discriminatory

23

or a violation of public interest, which is -- and the

24

specific rules of 251 don't apply.

25

QUESTION:

Is public interest a State concept or

45
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

a Federal concept?
MR. SMITH:

2
3

I would view that as something that

is authorizing the State commission to --

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. SMITH:

It has to be State on your --- to apply its -- no, obviously,

6

they can look at Federal policies if they want to, but I

7

wouldn't suggest that it's inherently Federal in the way

8

that the Solicitor General does.
Now, there are other situations that could come

9
10

up.

A contract could expressly incorporate Federal law,

11

and that might or might not create a Federal claim.

12

Court has wrestled for 100 years with the issue of when

13

Federal law incorporated into State law causes of action

14

do or don't create Federal question jurisdiction.

This

In other situations, the State commission might

15
16

have imposed the terms of the contract in an area where

17

the parties didn't agree, and in that situation, if they

18

are imposing it by virtue of their interpretation of the

19

Federal regulations, and then that particular clause is

20

later interpreted in some way that deviates from the

21

Federal regulations, that might well be a Federal claim as

22

well.

23

QUESTION:

That issue we've been wrestling with

24

for 100 years exists in one of these cases, doesn't it?

25

mean, don't one of these contracts refer to Federal law?

46
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

I

1

MR. SMITH:

Well, there have been assertions,

2

Your Honor, that that's the case.

My reading of these

3

contracts is that they make -- that they -- and certainly

4

in this case, the Illinois case, it specifically gives a

5

definition of when reciprocal compensation will be paid,

6

and both the commission and the two lower courts all said

7

that this is not a case where there has been an

8

incorporation of Federal regulations.

9

where we can divine the actual intent of the parties, that

This is a case

10

these calls should be treated as calls where this

11

compensation would be paid.

12

And so what they said was, this is not an

13

incorporation case, and I believe the contract in the

14

Verizon case, to come next, is the same, that there was an

15

intent at the time that was -- that the State commissions

16

have said we're going to hold you to -- even though

17

Federal law may have moved on, every time it moves on they

18

say, if you agreed to something else, you're still stuck

19

with it, and that's what the courts in both of these cases

20

have said as well as the commissions.

21

Maybe if I could turn, then, to the Eleventh

22

Amendment issues, it is certainly our view that the five

23

circuits that have said these cases present

24

straightforward Ex parte Young cases, those circuits are

25

correct, because they do involve, in situations where

47
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

there is a Federal claim being asserted against an action

2

of a State commission, either an enforcement case or an

3

approval case, a claim seeking an order bringing the State

4

commission into compliance with Federal law, and it is, I

5

think, an ongoing violation of Federal law, because when

6

they approve and enforce an interconnection agreement, or

7

they enforce it in some way, interpret it in some way,

8

they are then telling the parties that they have to live

9

by that interpretation during the term of the agreement.

10
11
12

QUESTION:

You think the commission is a

necessary party, then?
MR. SMITH:

It's our position that they are a

13

necessary party, but to use the technical term under the

14

Federal rules, if there was a reason why they can't be

15

sued and that the case can't go forward, then they may not

16

be an indispensable party.

The distinction is drawn in

17

Rule 19 between those two.

Certainly, they've --

18

QUESTION:

If that's the case, then, it says

19

we've got an unusual action here, because we're talking

20

about parties who have no personal or even official

21

interest except as interpreters of law.

22

MR. SMITH:

That's true, Your Honor, but what

23

makes them a necessary party is that the private parties

24

have an interest in having the administrative body that

25

has told them to do X be bound by a ruling from the

48
Alderson Reporting Company

1

Federal court which they're trying to get which says don't

2

do X, do Y, and that -QUESTION:

3

You're in effect saying that they

4

might dispute the application of the Supremacy Clause.

5

That's --

6

MR. SMITH:

And the reason why a Federal

7

district court is not named as a defendant in the court of

8

appeals is because the court of appeals has the power in a

9

unitary system to direct the district court to do

10
11

something.

When a Federal court, though, is --

QUESTION:

Yes, but the State court is not named

12

as a party when a case gets from a State supreme court on

13

a Federal question here.

14

MR. SMITH:

15

QUESTION:

Right, but I think -It's assumed that they will respect

16

the Supremacy Clause if there is a Federal declaration of

17

law, and why shouldn't the same assumption govern if there

18

is Federal review of a State order on, in effect, a

19

Federal question jurisdiction basis?

20

MR. SMITH:

It may be factually true that most

21

of the time State commissions will obey Federal courts,

22

but 100 years of jurisprudence under Ex parte Young and

23

before all follow the Federal administrative model and say

24

that as to Federal -- State executive officials, when they

25

violate Federal law, that you name them as a defendant.

QUESTION:

The only thing that I

have been suggesting takes this out of that simple case is

3

that you don't have, I think, here the classic case of the

State executive official.

5

is acting in a kind of a quasi-judicial capacity, and it

seems that one way to look at it would be to think of it

more as a court than as an executive office.

the Attorney General but also the rate-making

21

commissioners, and that is just the way it's done, and I

22

don't think it has any, as you have suggested, any great

23

intrusion on the sovereign interests of the State to have

24

them named.

Ex parte Young, the defendants included not just

In fact, that's the essence of Ex parte Young,

that it's not an intrusion on their interests to have them

2

brought into compliance under the Supremacy Clause, and it

3

would be, I think, an odd rule to say, well, we're going

4

to start having review of State actions, or some category

5

of State actions in Federal court for compliance with

6

Federal law where we don't name the defendants as -- the

7

State as -- State individuals as defendants.

QUESTION:

9

MR. SMITH:

Well -Now, there's been a number of other

10

arguments raised against the application of Ex parte Young

11

here.

12

There's a notion that somehow there's an elaborate

13

remedial scheme here comparable to the one in Seminole

14

Tribe, but in fact there isn't any elaborate remedial

15

scheme in the statute.

16

commissions in Federal court, or to the extent we're

17

relying on 1331, there's no scheme at all.

18

I don't think any of them is very substantial.

It just says you can sue State

We also have an -- the invocation of the Larson

19

case which was discussed by this Court in detail in

20

Pennhurst.

21

in a situation where you don't have Supremacy Clause

22

considerations at stake.

Larson, I believe, is the case that you apply

23

Essentially, what the Court said in Pennhurst

24

is, when the Supremacy Clause is at issue, we basically

25

allow lawsuits to proceed against all prospective ongoing

51
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

violations of Federal law by State officials, but Larson

2

provides a test that says where you're suing without

3

Supremacy Clause considerations to enforce State law

4

against State officials or Federal law against Federal

5

officials, in that situation you try to differentiate

6

between mere violations of Federal law and violations that

7

are so serious that we won't treat the State official or

8

the Federal official as an agent of the State any more.

9

That is not the test that ought to be applied under Ex

10

parte Young, and certainly has not been applied in the

11

past.

12

We also have the Fourth Circuit's analysis in

13

which it undertook an entire sort of ad hoc balancing test

14

trying to weigh State interests against Federal interests.

15

I think this Court is clearly on record as saying that in

16

the Ex parte Young context we're not going to get into

17

that kind of balancing test.

18

Fourth Circuit I thought was particularly unfortunate,

19

because basically what that Court did is, it looked at the

20

merits of the case and said, well, we don't think that the

21

Federal claims are very strong here, so therefore we're

22

going to say there's no ability to sue the State under Ex

23

parte Young, and that doesn't seem like a very helpful way

24

to go about -- thank you, Your Honor.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOEL D. BERTOCCHI

3

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

4

MR. BERTOCCHI:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

5

In response to questions from Justice Souter,

6

adjudicative context really provides the reasoning that Ex

7

parte Young doesn't apply here.

8

Mr. Smith said, the statute doesn't say you can sue State

9

commissioners in Federal court.

10

Contrary to what

(e)(6) doesn't reference

State commissioners at all.
This case is in a sense more like Larson than

11
12

Larson.

13

the authority for the contracting official came from

14

Federal or the State law.

15

characterization of what he was doing, and the Court

16

assumed he was wrong in what he did in that instance, and

17

in this instance, in the adjudicative context, it makes

18

even more sense.

19

Larson was not about whether the case -- whether

It was about the

Certainly with respect to, I believe, Mr.

20

Smith's remark about a -- Mr. Smith referred to the fact,

21

or there was a question about the fact that the commission

22

might dispute the application of the Supremacy Clause, and

23

certainly, if a commission did that, if a commission

24

declined to follow Federal law, that would be a different

25

story, and undoubtedly there would be some ability to

53

1

correct that action.
But the Illinois commission isn't doing that.

2
3

As a matter of fact, the Illinois Commerce Commission has

4

never tried.

5

a quasi-judicial proceeding, not executive or legislative.

6

It is not accurately compared to rate-making cases, which

7

are much more legislative.
This is adjudication of a contract issue

8
9

This is, I think, correctly characterized as

regarding a particular contract, and in that respect I

10

would go back -- that would lead me to the last point I

11

want to make, which is that this is a case about a

12

contract to which the act does not apply.

13

interesting, Mr. Smith said he didn't think the complaint

14

in this case would survive a motion to dismiss, and yet

15

he's here arguing that it belongs in Federal court.

It's

I'm assuming that -- and I may be wrong.

16

I

17

don't want to speak for him.

18

to dismiss would be an attempt to throw it out of Federal

19

court.

20

regarding a contract to which the act does not apply, and

21

section 252(a), which allows the courts to negotiate --

22

allows the parties to negotiate contracts any way they

23

want clearly suggests that they have the right to do so

24

without regard to Federal law.

25

I'm assuming that the motion

allegations in the complaint.

One of them is that this

2

contract violates the act, but if you look in their brief,

3

they'll see -- you'll see that they say that this can't be

restricted to violations of Federal law because in

5

negotiated cases that would allow jurisdiction to move on

7

We agree with that entirely.

interpretation does go to the vanishing point.
