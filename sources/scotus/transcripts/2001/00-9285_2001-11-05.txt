ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT J. WAGNER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. WAGNER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

On April 3rd of 1992, Judge Foster dismissed

12

criminal charges against Timothy Hall.

13

docket, case removed from docket, defendant deceased, and

14

then signed her name.

15

that docket sheet was the name, Bryan Saunders, in big

16

letters, court appointed counsel for Timothy Hall.

17

She noted on the

3 inches above that reference on

On April 6th of 1992, warrants charging Walter

18

Mickens with the capital murder of Timothy Hall came

19

before Judge Foster.

20

Saunders and asked if he would receive the appointment on

21

that case.

Judge Foster telephoned Bryan

He accepted that appointment.

22

This case presents this Court with the

23

extraordinary circumstances of a judge appointing a lawyer

24

to a death penalty case when that judge knew or reasonably

25

should have known that the lawyer represented the victim

at the time of the victim's death.

2

Walter Mickens has been deprived his constitutional rights

3

under the Sixth Amendment to conflict-free representation.

4

QUESTION:

As a consequence,

In the U.S. -- in the Public

5

Defender's Office, couldn't this situation arise fairly

frequently?

office would have represented a victim many years before

8

on a totally different matter.

9

Sometimes in a small office, somebody in the

MR. WAGNER:

10

QUESTION:

Yes, it could.
All right.

Well, if it arises fairly

11

often, then what kind of a rule would you suggest?

12

mean, does it mean that they have to -- public defenders

13

have a hard time.

14

they -- they can't have a thousand people in their office,

15

and sure enough, some members of the people -- sometimes

16

this will happen.

17

suggest?

18

I

I mean, they -- they can't -- you know,

So, what kind of rule would you

MR. WAGNER:

Well, the rule that's in place

19

here, the rule from Holloway v. Arkansas, the rule from

20

Cuyler v. Sullivan, the rule from Wood v. Georgia, is an

21

appropriate rule, and it's appropriate because it requires

22

that the trial judge or the -- or the judge in the case

23

knows or reasonably should know that there is, in fact, a

24

particular conflict.

25

QUESTION:

So -But, Mr. Wagner, what difference

should it make from the point of view of the defendant

2

whether the judge knew or the judge didn't know?

3

a sharp distinction between this case where the judge

knew.

didn't know.

6

cases he doesn't know.

7

You make

But suppose Mickens didn't know and the judge
Why should Mickens be worse off?

MR. WAGNER:

In both

Well, in Holloway v. Arkansas, this

8

Court announced a rule which if a defense attorney

9

presents to the court an objection on the basis of a

10

conflict of interest, and the court fails to inquire into

11

that conflict, then prejudice is presumed.

12

of the Holloway decision was on the court's responsibility

13

to inquire into that conflict.

14

QUESTION:

And the focus

But I was asking you what the rule

15

should be, not the rule -- I probably wasn't specific

16

enough.

17

if we were starting from scratch and you had a lawyer in a

18

-- in a public defender's office who many years before had

19

represented a victim, what should the rule be about

20

whether he can represent this person before him?

21

I can't necessarily reconcile all the cases.

MR. WAGNER:

Well, the rule should be, first of

22

all, if the -- if the court knows or reasonably should

23

know --

24
25

QUESTION:

So,

Forget whether the court knows or

doesn't know.

That doesn't help me.

If the facts

are that many years before the person represented the

Now, what kind of a

standard is the judge supposed to apply?

MR. WAGNER:

If the -- the attorney is compelled

That's helpful.

to do here?

said because his lawyer couldn't do a proper job given the

MR. WAGNER:

Well, because this Court has -- has

provided that there's a fundamental right to conflict-

free representation.

Didn't -- didn't the district court

find against you on the -- on the point of whether there

was an adverse effect?

MR. WAGNER:

Court is.

whether, in addition to a Sixth Amendment violation, you

have to show an adverse effect.

All we need to show here is an actual

QUESTION:

But your answer to Justice Breyer --

4

correct me if I'm wrong -- was that there had to be some,

5

at least strong possibility of adverse effect in the

6

instance where he represented the victim years before.

7

MR. WAGNER:

And that's exactly what

8

distinguishes actual conflict from adverse effect.

With

an actual conflict, there's a compulsion to refrain from

10

doing something.

lapse in representation, and -- and that's a significant

difference --

from a case where there's multiple representation over the

MR. WAGNER:

This is an astounding

Your Honor, I would suggest,

though, that the key issue here is in the trial court's

duty to -- to inquire into a conflict that it knew or

reasonably should have known.

Holloway v. Arkansas.

QUESTION:

Yes, but Holloway and Cuyler were

16

both multiple representation cases where the trial court

could see the whole thing right before him at that time.

18

This was not a multiple representation case.

MR. WAGNER:

QUESTION:

May I ask if -- if in your view would

3

everything have been satisfactory, as a constitutional law

4

matter, if the judge had said, go ask your client if the

5

client has any objection, and the client had said, no, I

6

have no objection?

7

Would that have taken care of it?

MR. WAGNER:

Well, I believe that the court

8

should have indulged in some inquiry of the client

9

himself.

The court should have asked the client if he

10

understood everything that was involved in waiving that

11

conflict.

12

And in this situation -QUESTION:

Excuse me.

You're -- you're

13

presuming a conflict.

14

argument for that -- whether the judge had an obligation

15

to inquire into a conflict about which he knew or should

16

have known.

17

existence of a conflict, but simply that this defendant --

18

that the deceased had previously been represented by

19

counsel who's representing this defendant.

20

constitute a conflict.

I -- I really don't follow your

What he should have known was -- was not the

That does not

The -- what follows from that -- from that

22

relationship?

Does anything follow other than the fact

23

that the lawyer cannot, in -- in a subsequent

representation, disclose any confidential information

25

which he learned in the prior representation.

Right?

1

Isn't that the only thing that follows?

2

MR. WAGNER:

Well, it is that, but there's also

3

ethical consideration 4-5 of the Virginia Code of

4

Professional Responsibility which states that anything

5

obtained by Mr. Saunders through his representation of

6

Hall could not be used to Hall's disadvantage.

7

QUESTION:

That's fine, but that doesn't show a

8

conflict.

That shows at most the potential of a conflict,

9

and -- and you're representing it here as though there is

10

a conflict and -- and the judge had an obligation to

11

inquire into it.

12

there was a conflict.

13

all.

14

But the whole issue is -- is whether

MR. WAGNER:

That hasn't been established at

Well, I believe it has, Your Honor,

15

and it's been established because Mr. Saunders in this

16

case obtained confidential information from Mr. Hall.

17

That's clear from the record.

18

that.

19

was precluded from doing certain things.

20

The district court found

QUESTION:

Would you -- would you say what they

21

were?

Because it seemed to me that some of the things you

22

listed were just matters of record and not at all -- there

23

was one conversation between this lawyer and the client.

24

We know it took place for 15 to 30 minutes, and that was

25

it.

And a number of your recitations do involve matters

of public record that would not involve betraying any

2

client confidence if Saunders brought them out.

3

was it that Saunders knew that was not available to the

public?

MR. WAGNER:

So, what

First of all, all of this happened

6

in -- in juvenile domestic relations court, and under

7

Virginia law, all of those files, all of that information

8

from that case was confidential and couldn't be revealed

9

to the public.

10

But nonetheless, even if it was public, under

11

ethical consideration 4-4 of the Virginia Code of

12

Professional Responsibility, which governed Mr. Saunders

13

at that time, he was absolutely required to preserve the

14

confidences and secrets of Mr. Hall regardless of the

15

source or nature of those confidences --

16

QUESTION:

So what?

So what?

Why does that

17

constitute a conflict?

18

confidential information which he knew with something that

19

was relevant to the defense of his new client, there's no

conflict.

21

MR. WAGNER:

Unless you connect up that

I want to get to that point, and

the point is that in death penalty cases, it's absolutely

MR. WAGNER:

this is a sex case, Judge.

7

sodomy, and also in that type of case, it's absolutely

essential for the attorney to look into the background of

the defendant --

QUESTION:

This is a case of forcible

Well, isn't -- wouldn't that be true

in most criminal cases?

12

MR. WAGNER:

It would be true that the -- the

attorney should look into the -- the background of the

14

victim.

15

true because of the sentencing phase in a death penalty

16

case.

17

the attorney needs to -- or the team of attorneys need to

18

look into the background of the victim, need to engage in

19

a -- in brainstorming about the background and an

20

investigation about the background.

21

couldn't engage in that brainstorming, couldn't engage in

22

that investigation because he had to preserve those

confidences, and he had a duty of loyalty to Mr. Hall.

Absolutely, Judge.

argument, insofar as this case is concerned, pretty much

3

Let's take the issue that you -- you rightly stress about

the response to the victim impact evidence, the -- the

6

here by the fact that the information, on the basis of

which defense counsel could have responded to the mother's

testimony, had already been published in a newspaper?

Isn't your case pretty much undercut

11

counsel had any conflict, actual or potential.

-- even if we accept your -- your premise that proof of

conflict would be enough in this situation, don't you lose

anyway?

first of all, to adopt the rule of Wood v. Georgia, the

MR. WAGNER:

I understand, Your Honor.

And --

3

and if you look to the Cuyler v. Sullivan case, Cuyler v.

Sullivan very specifically draws out a test in which you

must show both actual conflict and adverse effect.

So --

Well, you are making a nice statement

in the abstract.

the Wood case, and I said, well -- you answered both

questions if the employer has a conflict -- if the lawyer

has a conflict because the employer's interest diverges

from the employee's.

10

I'm trying to bring it down to earth in

MR. WAGNER:

Yes.

And in that case, the Court

did actually find -- in Wood v. Georgia, did find an

MR. WAGNER:

No.

I -- I believe that the

QUESTION:

So, I thought the key to your case

essentially equal a particular conflict.

QUESTION:

question.

You mean whenever there's a potential conflict,

if the -- if defense counsel had -- had represented the

victim 20 years ago on a totally unrelated matter, there

MR. HARRIS:

What the Court said in Holloway is

2

that relying on the representations of counsel that there

was a conflict of interest and that he would be unable to

4

examine his multiple clients, the failure to inquire into

5

that was itself error.

6

And I think if you -- you can put Holloway into

the exact same terms of the Sullivan over-arching

standard.

advising the court that he sees a conflict of interest,

10

the fact that counsel tells the court, when they get to

And then the next question I have is

do you think -- again, not necessarily a matter of

practice for the judge to inquire of the lawyer whether he

thought there had been any -- any difficulty in the

13

I think that is part and parcel of what Sullivan was

inquiries even on facts that may not be based on the

16

objection of counsel or the defendant.

17

It was a juvenile court that -- that made
Certainly it would be a good practice.

QUESTION:

Would you say it was unethical for

18

the lawyer not to have revealed to the court and his

client not what is the better practice, but that it was,

20

in fact, a violation of the ethical constraints for the

21

lawyer, knowing that he had represented the victim, not to

22

tell his client so his client could make the choice

I would like a different lawyer.

MR. HARRIS:

No.

Would the --

I would say this, as this

Court pointed out in Wheat, the judge certainly has the

discretion, a very broad discretion at that point in time,

to anticipate the possibility of conflicts and to

substitute counsel on the risk, on the possible danger of

a conflict appearing later on.

QUESTION:

Going back to the earlier questions

about the counsel's ethical duty, as you understand it,

loyalty to the former client or just a duty of maintaining

confidentiality?

MR. HARRIS:

After the close of the

representation of a former client, I -- I believe that the

general duty of loyalty devolves down to that duty of

19

maintaining the confidences of your former client.

20

is how the duty of loyalty is represented.

think we can impose a -- even an ethical obligation on

MR. HARRIS:

If the

Well, we are giving a great deal of

weight to trial counsel's ability to know because he is

the only person that has the access to the confidences of

multiple clients who will know for certain, or at least

with a high degree of certainty, that there is going to be

MR. HARRIS:

that the trial judge's notice of facts that would cause

used was a particular conflict.

certainly imposes an obligation upon him to inquire into

it.

But the notice of that

But I don't think you can then say that having

knowledge of facts that would suggest an actual conflict

or even suggest a particular conflict can be equated with

the attorney's representation that it exists.

QUESTION:

Okay.

The trouble -- the trouble is

14

if you follow -- I mean, I think I follow your -- your

argument.

nothing is really added to the law by saying the trial

-- when we come at the -- at the question after the fact,

the trial judge hasn't inquired, there's been a trial,

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

When a district court has reason to know about a

Sixth Amendment is violated only when there is a showing

of an actual conflict and an adverse effect on the quality

And we say that for three reasons.

First, it is a central tenet of this Court's

there has to be an adverse effect on the quality of

8

performance, but it is still -- from that, there is

9

inferred prejudice.

It would be inconsistent with the

10

central thrust of showing some kind of prejudice to

11

reverse a conviction, set aside it, and -- and order a new

12

trial when there has been no showing that the quality of

13

representation has been affected.

14

And in Sullivan, the Court held --

MR. GORNSTEIN:

QUESTION:

4

The judge --

Are you saying he never has a duty of

inquiry unless there's going to be actual prejudice?
MR. GORNSTEIN:

No.

I -- I think that what the

5

Court said in Wood about the duty of inquiry and -- and --

6

this is somewhat vague, I will agree, but it said there

7

has to be a clear possibility of a conflict.

8
9

QUESTION:

All right.

Supposing there's a clear

possibility of prejudice, but no actual proof of

10

prejudice, is that enough to impose a duty of -- of

11

inquiry on the judge?

12

MR. GORNSTEIN:

There's a duty of inquiry, but

13

if the duty is not fulfilled and a trial is held and a --

14

there's a conviction and the defendant is seeking to

15

overturn his conviction, at that point the defendant still

16

must show an actual conflict and an adverse effect on the

17

quality of his representation.

18

QUESTION:

We've been trying to find a way to

19

distinguish Holloway from this case.

One way is to say

20

that multiple representation is so fraught with

21

difficulties that it's simply a separate category.

22

Another is to say that the likelihood of an adverse effect

23

is so significant, so serious that we'll presume it.

24

Another is to say that the conflict itself is much more

25

serious in most cases than -- how would you -49

I would say that there would --

I would say that Holloway is a

special case where prejudice was presumed conclusively

13

And the second is that prejudice inheres in the

14

situation in which a judge orders a defense counsel, over

15

his objection, to continue representation even though the

16

attorney believes he is not going to be able to perform

17

adequately.

18

And those two circumstances together create a

19

per se rule of prejudice, and it's a carve-out from the

20

Sullivan rule.

21

QUESTION:

Does Wood stand for a similar

22

proposition, or is Wood different?

23

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Now, Wood is a situation where

the Sullivan rule was applied in a case in which there was

reason to know a clear possibility of an actual conflict.

reasons for Holloway have to do with the deferring to the

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT J. WAGNER

18

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

19

MR. WAGNER:

Thank you, Your Honor.

20

The thrust of the respondent's argument here is

21

that Holloway stands for the proposition that if a defense

22

attorney raises an objection to the court and the court

23

compels that representation over that objection, then that

24

is where the prejudice is presumed.

1

conclusion, then anytime a defense attorney raises an

2

objection on the basis of a conflict to a court and the

3

court compels that representation over that objection,

4

then prejudice should be presumed.

5

you have a situation where a defense attorney raises an

6

objection to the court, the court properly inquires of

7

that defense attorney about that conflict and properly

8

finds that there is no debilitating conflict here and then

9

requires that -- that defense attorney to proceed with the

In other words, when

10

representation, then under what the respondents say here,

11

prejudice should be presumed.

12

That's not what Holloway stands for.

Holloway

13

stands for the proposition that the trial court has the

14

duty of protecting the essential rights of the defendant.

15

The trial court has the duty of seeing that the Sixth

16

Amendment rights of a defendant are protected.

17

this case, the trial court failed in that responsibility.

18

It knew or should have known of that conflict, failed to

inquire into that conflict and that's where the prejudice

lies here.
