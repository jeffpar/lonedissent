CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

5

National Labor Relations Board.

6

Mr. Baskin.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MAURICE BASKIN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. BASKIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

This case presents an important question arising

12

under the Petition Clause of the First Amendment.

13

Petitioner BE&K Construction is asking the Court to hold

14

that the First Amendment protects objectively based

15

lawsuits from being declared unlawful by the National

16

Labor Relations Board.

17

Now, the Court has already held that the First

18

Amendment does protect lawsuits from statutory sanction

19

under both the NLRA and the antitrust laws so long as the

20

suits are meritorious, meaning that they are not

21

objectively baseless.

22

Court said -- and I quote -- it is not unlawful to pursue

23

a meritorious lawsuit under the National Labor Relations

24

Act.

25

cited the Noerr-Pennington doctrine of the antitrust law.

In the Bill Johnson's case, the

In fact, the Court said it twice and specifically

1

Then it --

2
3

QUESTION:

How do you describe the test applied

by the board?

4

MR. BASKIN:

Well, the test by the board is one

5

which says that the employer must be -- must prevail, must

6

be 100 percent prevailing in the lawsuit.

7

that's impossible for any employer to anticipate in

8

advance.

9

of prevailing.

10
11

As a standard

No -- no employer can ever be 100 percent sure

QUESTION:

Should there be any other component?

I mean, I think your client lost basically.

12

MR. BASKIN:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. BASKIN:

So --

Well, the question is what was -What else should be part of the test?
The test is what is the -- was

15

there an objective basis for the litigation.

16

win-or-lose test, as the Court said in Professional Real

17

Estate -- and I'll quote again -- it's got to be

18

objectively baseless in the sense that no reasonable

19

litigant could realistically expect success on the merits.

20

QUESTION:

It's not a

Well, should the test from

21

Professional Real Estate automatically be carried over to

22

the Labor Relations Act?

23

MR. BASKIN:

Well, in this case, Your Honor, an

24

answer is yes because the Court itself has interacted with

25

the -- both of the acts.

They cross reference with each

other.

Bill Johnson's referred directly to the California

2

Motor Transport.

3

Bill Johnson's as if it's one consistent whole.

4

is.

5

Professional Real Estate referred to

QUESTION:

And it

Well, but I -- I wonder if -- if the

6

National Labor Relations Board doesn't have some

7

discretion to say that the labor situation is somewhat

8

different, as they apparently do, from the antitrust

9

situation.

10

MR. BASKIN:

Well, but the irony here is that

11

the NLRB has not -- has not interpreted its own statute.

12

It's not being deferred to here.

13

this Court's decision in Bill Johnson's.

14
15

QUESTION:

The NLRB is interpreting

Which happened to say precisely what

the NLRB said it said.

16

MR. BASKIN:

17

QUESTION:

Well, no, Your Honor.

In Bill --

If a judgment goes against the

18

employer in the State court, if it goes against him, then

19

he's had his day in court.

20

to adjudicate the unfair practice claim, and then the

21

employer's suit, having been proved unmeritorious, the

22

board can take that fact into account when it decides the

23

labor law violation.

24

MR. BASKIN:

25

QUESTION:

And then the board may proceed

That's what the board decides.

Now, I put that so you'll reply to it.

MR. BASKIN:

that you just said.

10

Said may

And then key phrase, having proved to be

11

unmeritorious, what does unmeritorious mean?

12

Court has consistently said what unmeritorious means.

13

said so before Bill Johnson's in the Christiansburg case.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. BASKIN:

16

QUESTION:

Well, this
It

Mr. Baskin, back up a bit.
Yes.
The -- the Court in that very

17

paragraph gave a definition of what it meant.

18

wouldn't look outside this document for what the Court

19

meant by with merit/without merit when the -- look at the

20

sentence in the middle of that paragraph.

21

judgment goes against the employer and the State court.

22

MR. BASKIN:

23

QUESTION:

So, I

It says if the

Judgment against you.

Or if his suit

24

is withdrawn or is otherwise shown to be without merit.

25

Otherwise shown to be merit.

I took that to mean if you

1

lose, it's shown to be without merit.

2

situations in which it's shown to be without merit.

3

it seems to me the best place to find out what the Court

4

meant merit/without merit is the very opinion that we're

5

construing.

6

MR. BASKIN:

There may be other
So,

Yes, and if it were the holding of

7

the opinion, it would have greater weight.

8

not the holding that we're talking -- that we're parsing

9

out here.

10

But this is

This is dicta because the essential -QUESTION:

Well, there are two responses to the

11

dicta point it seems to me.

12

dicta, but it was dicta that preceded a remand in which

13

this issue in fact would be explored.

14

response is the -- as I understand it, the board itself

15

has followed the -- the dicta for -- I forget how many

16

years now, but consistently followed it and Congress has

17

done nothing about it.

18

and B, even if it is, isn't it the kind of dicta that at

19

this point definitely should be followed?

20

MR. BASKIN:

The first one is it was

And the second

So, A, query whether it's dicta,

It is clearly dicta because the

21

Court stated what was the issue before it, and the sole

22

issue before it in Bill Johnson's is stated at the

23

beginning of the opinion, whether the NLRB may issue a

24

cease and desist order to halt the prosecution of a State

25

court civil suit brought by an employer to retaliate

Alderson Reporting Company

1

against employees.

2

And the holding of the case, which analyzes the

3

First Amendment at great length, says that the right of

4

access to the courts is too important to be an unfair

5

labor practice.

6

reasonable basis, language in the Court's opinion.

7

And it also defines meritorious as being

QUESTION:

I think there's another element that

8

you're ignoring.

9

whether it was a meritless lawsuit against the unions and

10

I thought the board looked both at

whether it was for a retaliatory purpose.

11

MR. BASKIN:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. BASKIN:

14

Isn't that the other element?
Yes.

Both elements must be

present.

15
16

Yes.

QUESTION:
retaliatory purpose?

17

MR. BASKIN:

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. BASKIN:

Okay.

And how do we define

What -- what constitutes that -Well, it's --- do you think, in the board's rule?
Yes.

It's very -- pretty much the

20

same as the improper motivation purpose test that was in

21

the Professional Real Estate case, which also has the two-

22

part test.

23

then and only then if there's no objective basis, you look

24

at whether there was a retaliatory motive.

25

You look at the objective basis first, and

And how that's defined, although the Court did
8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

not grant cert on that issue, we contested vigorously the

2

-- the board's finding of retaliatory motivation here --

3

because in fact the board has made it a rubber stamp.

4

It's become automatic if the case relates in any way to

5

union activity, the board finds that it's retaliatory

6

motivation.

7

But the first part of the test is an objective

8

one that the Court has spelled out both in Bill Johnson's

9

itself and in Professional Real Estate.

And to take any

10

-- to take the board's standard puts employers in an

11

impossible situation.

12

the question of dicta or not, you have ambiguous language

13

at best because we have several different references to

14

meritorious throughout the Bill Johnson's opinion.

15

QUESTION:

It is unworkable.

Going back to

May I just ask this, Mr. Baskin?

Do

16

you think there is a distinction between an ongoing case

17

and a completed case?

18

MR. BASKIN:

It's one mostly as to timing and

19

facts available to the board, and I think that's what the

20

Court was --

21

QUESTION:

But the -- in your view, the standard

22

is the same.

It's not that the board tries to enjoin the

23

proceeding as -- as opposed to later on bringing an unfair

24

labor practice after it's over.

25

MR. BASKIN:

The substantive standard should be
9

1

the same.

QUESTION:

3

MR. BASKIN:

4

QUESTION:

5

It should be, but -Should be.
-- do you think that Johnson says

it's the same?

6

MR. BASKIN:

We're all here today because the

7

language in the tail end of the Bill Johnson's opinion is

8

ambiguous as to what they intended the standard to be.

QUESTION:

And that's the whole key to the case.
That really is the whole key to the

case.

18

QUESTION:

And why not?

19

QUESTION:

Mr. Baskin, is your -- is your

20

argument -- in your opening remarks, you -- you referred

21

only to the First Amendment.

22

constitutional argument you're making?

23

a law adopting the English rule on -- on attorney's fees,

25

that would be unconstitutional?

MR. BASKIN:

No.

We are not saying that.

We

2

are not seeking to constitutionally -- we are asking no

3

more than that you apply this standard to the two statutes

4

you've already applied it --

6

QUESTION:

Which says -- so, it's a statutory

argument.

7

MR. BASKIN:

No.

It is a constitutional and

8

statutory argument, which is what the Court itself said in

9

both of these cases because there's a sanction involved.

10
11

QUESTION:

it -- does the Constitution prohibit it or not?

12
13

MR. BASKIN:

QUESTION:

The Constitution prohibits.

So, your

answer to my question is --

MR. BASKIN:

QUESTION:

18

It prohibits a statute from

15

I don't know what you mean by a -- is

Constitutional and statutory.
You -- you cannot -- that Congress

could not adopt the English rule.

MR. BASKIN:

No.

The difference -- here's the

It would do that by statute.
But is there an -- a declaration of

unlawfulness involved?

There are many fee-shifting

24

statutes.

25

but the National Labor Relations Board is saying that BE&K

We're not taking issue with mere fee-shifting,

antitrust laws.

4

litigation.

5

They're saying -- they're issuing a cease

QUESTION:

But the fact that it's triple damages

6

is a little different than fee-shifting.

7

easily say, when you're exposed to treble damages,

8

putative damages, yes, that's a punishment.

9

shifting is the rule in most countries in the world.

10

So, what is the more here?

So, one could

Here fee-

I understand the

11

more in antitrust cases, treble damages.

Here you say,

12

well, there's a finding that you have committed an unfair

13

labor practice.

14

that you have to pay the other side's legal fees?

15

are the adverse consequences --

16

MR. BASKIN:

What are the consequences in addition to
What

First, the most important is the

17

declaration that you are a law violator in and of itself.

18

You have to post a notice for your employees not only at

19

this job site but all across the country.

20

-- your customers become aware of it.

21

certainly make sure your customers become aware of it.

22

There's the serious danger of debarment either privately

23

or by governmental action.

24
25

QUESTION:

Explain that.

You have your

The unions

You did say that in

your brief about debarment, and I didn't -- I can
12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

understand when you say someone -- someone's reputation is

2

affected by being labeled a law violator.

3

something about -- about the jeopardy of debarment and I

4

wasn't clear how that would work.

5

MR. BASKIN:

But you said

It's not meant in the legal sense

6

and the Government -- we're not -- we're not talking about

7

whether the Government has to debar the company, but both

8

private actors and many Government contracting officers

9

take the view they don't want to deal with people who have

10

been declared to be law violators.

11

reputation of the company is at stake.

12

QUESTION:

The goodwill and

Well, in our lower case, the --

13

Wisconsin set out to do that on a State basis, didn't it?

14

If you violated the Labor Act, the State was not going to

15

deal with you.

16

MR. BASKIN:

Yes, they did.

And then the

17

Federal Government just last -- 2 years ago in the

18

previous administration, had come through with a set of

19

rules saying that companies would be debarred if they were

20

found to have violated labor laws.

21

So, having this -- a declaration of illegality

22

in place is what makes this different, Justice Scalia,

23

from a random fee-shifting statute, and that's why we are

24

not asking you to do anything other than what you've

25

already done, which is to apply the First Amendment to two
13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

statutes which you have determined have great commonality

2

over the years, as each one keeps referring back to the

3

other in this doctrine.

4

QUESTION:

What do you do with the 2 decades

5

that have elapsed -- about 2 decades -- since Justice

6

White's opinion which has been interpreted by the board

7

the way the language most naturally reads?

8

is to say when the case first came out it was ambiguous.

9

But now we have 2 decades of consistent interpretation of

10

The one thing

that language by the board.

11

MR. BASKIN:

I regret to say it's a tribute to

12

the speed of the board's processes and the process of

13

getting this case up to this level on this issue because

14

this case alone has taken 7 years to work its way through

15

the board.

16

was 1987.

17

considerable doubt as exactly -- as to exactly what it

18

meant.

19

history of the case, could you tell me how did this case

7

end up in the Sixth Circuit?

8
9

MR. BASKIN:

Well, in fact, by the time this

case got to the court of appeals, BE&K was no longer doing

10

business in California.

11

business was in the Sixth Circuit.

13

MR. BASKIN:

The gravamen of its doing

I see.
And that's why the decision was

made --

15

QUESTION:

I'd like you to address, if I can go

16

back to the -- what I think was the Chief Justice's

17

question.

18

with you, as I will, for the moment that the language is

19

ambiguous in Bill Johnson, is that we should treat or the

20

statute should be interpreted as treating the antitrust

21

statute and the labor statute a case brought by a

22

defendant the same way.

23

Your -- your basic point, I take it, assuming

And obvious differences, which I'd like you to

24

address, are that, one, there is a history in the labor

25

law of employers using cases brought at law either to

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

break unions or to win disputes.

And that was one of the

2

reasons why the NLRA was passed.

That had nothing to do

3

with the antitrust laws.

4

There is no such history.

Second, the employer -- the -- the matter is

5

committed to an expert board in the labor area, which

6

apparently believes that the way to enforce the labor law,

7

unlike the antitrust law, is to say the sham exception

8

exists before the case is decided, but once the case is

9

decided, we're going to keep employers out of the courts

10

by saying if they lose, that's the end of any immunity

11

that they get.

was in bringing this lawsuit.

13

We have a different history.

And we will now look to what their motive

16

MR. BASKIN:

We have an expert board.
We have different statutes.

1

MR. BASKIN:

Well, to me it's -- the interesting

2

thing about this case is the Court has itself considered

3

these very questions that you're raising and you have

4

answered them, and you do not need to revisit them to --

5

to come out with the conclusion that the NLRB has either

6

misinterpreted the standard or that the standard is

7

unworkable.

QUESTION:

Well, but I -- I have -- I have the

same question that I think underlies Justice Breyer's

10

concern.

11

The board says, now, you have organized this clerical unit

13

books.

of process if there's -- but if there's some basis, then

24

you can use it specifically to retaliate.

25

MR. BASKIN:

More than some.

It must be

reasonable basis.

3

And yes, yes.

QUESTION:

You can specifically use it to

retaliate.

4

MR. BASKIN:

The Court -- this Court has said

5

that if there is an objective basis, that means it's a

6

meritorious lawsuit.

7

of retaliation.

8
9

Then there may also be a motivation

Weighty, countervailing considerations.

QUESTION:

But -- but we're talking -- we're

talking in -- in the labor context.

10

MR. BASKIN:

11

QUESTION:

Yes.
And you lose the suit.

So, there's

12

-- you do not -- you're not the prevailing party in the

13

suit.

14

the board can do about it if you've done it specifically

15

to retaliate and for no other purpose.

16

And you -- you lose on the merits.

MR. BASKIN:

There's nothing

If it is a reasonable, meritorious

17

suit, as this Court has defined it, where the right of

18

access to a court is too important to be called an unfair

19

labor practice solely on the ground that what is sought in

20

the court is to enjoin employees from exercising a

21

protected right because of the First Amendment to the

22

Constitution, the right to petition the courts with a

23

meritorious lawsuit.

24
25

QUESTION:

But the First Amendment argument goes

by the boards once the case is over.

MR. BASKIN:

No, Your Honor, because -- for the

2

same reasons that the Court held in Professional Real

3

guessed with 20/20 hindsight as long as it had a

5

reasonable basis for the suit.

The employer has the right not to be second

QUESTION:

Yes, but that ignores the fact that

7

we're not concerned solely with chilling; we're also

8

concerned with retaliation.

9

retaliatory character of the lawsuit involved, I would

And if we didn't have the

10

think you would have a much stronger argument as you just

11

made it.

12

we can accept your -- in effect, your chilling argument

13

without ignoring the retaliatory character.

14
15

But the retaliation is there and I don't see how

MR. BASKIN:

Because the employers are being

chilled and, in effect, the retaliation --

16

QUESTION:

Well, they're being chilled in -- in

17

engaging in retaliation for the exercise of statutory

18

rights.

19

MR. BASKIN:

But there's actually less

20

retaliation that's going to take place once the suit is

21

completed.

22

should be instructed to intervene sooner to keep the

23

employees from having to spend more money to defend

24

themselves.

25

If that were the standard, then the board

And the -- the answer to that, it

we've got a federalism interest in letting the State

answer to that objection.

MR. BASKIN:

We've got a --

So, that's the

under.

QUESTION:

You have two statutes, Federal

All right.

Let's go back then to the

10

-- to the difference between the two Federal statutes.

11

The premise of Justice Breyer's question a moment ago

12

accepted the ambiguity.

13

if we read Bill Johnson's the way Justice Ginsburg read it

14

-- and I will be candid to say I read it -- number one,

15

the ambiguity does not leap out at us.

16

If we are not that indulgent and

And number two, I'd like to go back to Justice

17

Ginsburg's question.

18

ambiguity at the beginning, we have had 20 years of board

19

practice which seems to me to have dissipated any

20

ambiguity.

Even if we assume there was

What's your response to that?
MR. BASKIN:

Well, the ambiguity was in the

opinion that led the board to take an erroneous view -QUESTION:

That's right I believe, and the board

has made it very clear how the board is reading it, and

after 20 years, we've got a pretty clearly settled body of

And is that what the Court --

4

QUESTION:

And we're interpreting statutes --

5

the -- the settled body is clear and Congress is

6

apparently quite agreeable to it.

7

MR. BASKIN:

Well, first, the Court has said you

8

don't defer -- that -- that you can't read anything into

9

congressional inaction, particularly when it has taken

10

this long before the board ruling really was definitive.

11

And it has taken that long.

12

for most of that 20-year period.

17

The issue has been in doubt

But the -- going beyond that, the -- the

I don't understand that.

Why do you

say it's been in doubt for most of the 20-year period?
MR. BASKIN:

Because it's been in doubt.

MR. BASKIN:

Has the board ever taken a different

MR. BASKIN:

There have been dissents, but no,

MR. BASKIN:

But the board is not entitled to

or of this Court's decision.

14

talking about here is the board's interpretation of the

geared to an issue of deference.

22
Alderson Reporting Company

1

And there is a good reason, which underlies

2

ultimately our -- our approach to stare decisis in

3

statutory cases, for letting settled statutory

4

understandings stayed settled unless the legislative

5

branch wants to change them.

6

we're getting at, not deference.

7

MR. BASKIN:

And that's the argument

Well, it is -- stare decisis is a

8

form of deference, and we're talking about stare decisis

9

would apply to the Court's own opinion.

Only this Court

10

is required to defer to itself about its own opinion.

11

Your -- and so that's why we are talking about deference,

12

I would submit.

asking should you stick with what the board has come up

14

with.

At least I interpret your question as

own answers indicate, for 20 years there seems to have

been a -- a settled practice on the part of the board

22

shouldn't we let a settled statutory regime stay settled

has taken this long to reach back to the court, is wrong

Indeed, the -- the board could, under this

MR. BASKIN:

You have --

You go through all of that based on an attack on your

QUESTION:

5

Well -We're trying to carve out a -- an

carving out an exception from the basic First Amendment

protection that this Court has recognized already.

QUESTION:

Mr. Baskin, that -- that goes back

every time to how you construe this paragraph, and so if

the position that Justice White is making a distinction

11

here between, on the one hand, an ongoing proceeding --

12

the First Amendment says you can't stop it.

14

that weighs it to the same end, but traditionally under

what the Court has looked at most cautiously.

Justice White tells us, but it's different once the

adjudication is over.

19

Never mind

That's another consideration

Then

The -- the line between prior restraint and

1

MR. WALLACE:

In any event, if I may turn now to

2

address the question that the Court asked the parties to

3

address in formulating the question presented here.

4

submission in this case is that this Court's holding in

5

Professional Real Estate Investors interpreting the

6

antitrust laws and the Court's decision in Bill Johnson's,

7

including this -- these dicta to govern further

8

proceedings interpreting the National Labor Relations Act,

9

are entirely compatible with one another in light of the

10

important differences in the purposes, processes,

11

remedies, and practicalities of enforcement that were

12

implicated in the two statutory schemes at issue.

13

QUESTION:

Our

Well, I -- I have one particular

14

difference in mind that I'd like you to comment on.

15

I -- it's -- it seems to me that what is sought to be done

here is much worse as far as the independence of the

17

courts and the guarantee of access to the courts by -- by

the citizenry is concerned than what was sought to be done

20

1

will have to defer to that factual finding if there is a

2

basis in the record, whether the courts agree with it or

3

not.

4

I find it quite offensive to think that Article

5

III courts are going to be told that certain people who

6

have come to them for relief will pay a penalty for doing

7

so on the basis of a retaliatory motive found not by

8

Article III courts at all but by the labor court -- but by

9

the Labor Board.

In that respect, this case is much worse

10

than -- than what was going on in -- in Professional Real

MR. WALLACE:

contradicting anything found by the courts.

MR. WALLACE:

violation by the union of 8(b)(4), not -- not that the

2

to show that the union lawsuit violated duties that the

3

union owes, and that was resolved against the employer on

4

the merits in this case because the -- the subject of the

5

lawsuits was about working conditions at the site of

6

employment, which was a legitimate union concern.

7

QUESTION:

The employer would have

Never -- never mind the 26 to 3.

8

Just -- just tell me why I -- as -- as an Article III

9

judge, I should not be concerned about leaving it to a

10

Federal agency to make the factual finding that will

11

determine whether somebody will be punished for bringing a

12

reasonable lawsuit, although one which ultimately loses in

13

Federal courts.

14

Why shouldn't I be concerned about that?

MR. WALLACE:

Well, this isn't punishment.

It's

15

make-whole relief under an administrative scheme which is

16

meant to protect employees in the exercise of their

17

concerted rights, and it involves no contradiction of any

18

issue that was before the -- the court in the underlying

litigation which did not have occasion to address whether

20

the suit was brought for a retaliatory purpose.

Court held that Wisconsin law was preempted, and Wisconsin

4

could not refuse to make purchases, State purchases, from

5

companies that had been found to have violated the

6

National Labor Relations Act because the whole purpose of

7

the remedy scheme under the National Labor Relations Act

8

is remedial and the remedies are limited, and the idea is

9

to get labor disputes behind us, not to have disruptions

10

of the economy, to keep productivity going, and to keep

11

the people employed.

12

QUESTION:

Well, is -- is the point of this

colloquy whether or not this act can be called punitive or

this NLRB doctrine can be called punitive?

Maybe you think nothing -- maybe you think nothing turns

on that.

18

MR. WALLACE:

I -- I had

Well, I -- I wouldn't think that

19

-- that anything would turn on it, but it is not punitive.

20

The only remedy that's granted is a make-whole remedy that

21

that are issue, and the Court held in Bill Johnson's that

permissible remedy by the board.

QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, I -- do you agree that

2

under the board's rule here that it does allow the board

3

to find the unfair labor practice and impose the sanctions

4

on litigation brought by employers that is not limited to

5

just shams and abuse of process?

6

MR. WALLACE:

7

QUESTION:

That's --

It does allow the imposition of these

8

things for an employer suit that could be considered

9

objectively reasonable at the time it was brought.

10

MR. WALLACE:

Exactly so.

That -- I thought the

11

Court made it quite clear in Bill Johnson's that as long

12

as the suit was an unmeritorious one, in the sense that it

13

did not prevail, the board could afford the limited remedy

14

that's available under the act.

15

QUESTION:

Well, does that have the necessary

16

effect of at least chilling some conduct that is protected

17

by the First Amendment?

18

You have to -- you would have to concede that it does.

19

MR. WALLACE:

I mean, it seems to me it does.

But it -- it's a far less daunting

20

situation than what the Court was faced with under the

21

antitrust laws in the Professional Real Estate Investors

22

case.

QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, isn't it correct that

the scope of chilling is limited to those with a

The other parts of this statutory

proceeding do not exclude the Federal courts from their

MR. WALLACE:

Well, I think this Court's make it

QUESTION:

We agree with that and the only issue

is whether that statutory provision places within the

board the power to impose this particular sanction for an

unfair labor practice, a penalty for bringing a

5

meritorious lawsuit.

MR. WALLACE:

7

QUESTION:

Well, make-whole relief --

Isn't the make-whole relief simply

8

that they've said, since ours is a statute which foresees

taking labor disputes out of the courts and putting them

going to say a -- a loser in a Federal lawsuit that

MR. WALLACE:

Now, is there anything

That's -- that

is what is at issue, and the -- the National Labor

definition of a unmeritorious lawsuit simply one which --

14

I think that's extraordinary.

MR. WALLACE:

Well, there is not a reference to

but Congress did say in section 8(a)(1) that it shall be

And in -- in Professional Real Estate itself,

the procedural posture focused on the need for summary

judgment to be available against a counterclaim for treble

4

damages under the antitrust laws in circumstances in which

5

the counterclaimant, after the underlying copyright

6

infringement suit was found to be objectively reasonable,

7

was saying, but I still need further discovery in order to

8

ascertain the intent and motives of the original plaintiff

9

in bringing the copyright infringement suit because it's

10

my view that -- that they didn't really expect to prevail

11

and that they were bringing it for anticompetitive

12

purposes.

13

And the danger that the Court was addressing

14

there was that much of the protective quality of the Noerr

doctrine itself could be undermined if the original

16

lawsuit that supposedly is protected could be chilled by

17

the prospect of burdensome discovery and treble damages.

QUESTION:

My -- my concern -- my concern is --

19

is this, is that the First Amendment has its own

corrective counterspeech, but what the board has done here

is it's defined retaliatory motive so broadly that it's

taken away that First Amendment corrective.

limited remedy available here compared to the prospect

that treble damages might be awarded on the basis of

rather unpredictable findings about subjective motivation

in bringing the lawsuit.

of this case is that there was a finding of retaliatory

MR. WALLACE:

background of the case, but the Court did limit the grant

MR. BASKIN:

Thank you, Your Honor.

I would

16

just briefly like to address the question of retaliatory

motive, but only as I understood the Justices' questions

to be does it suffice alone so that they -- the board can

rightly ignore the question of the objective basis.

20

-- and the reason it does not suffice, among others, is

21

perhaps looking at the 26 decisions Justice Scalia found,

22

there's only one among them where there was no finding of

QUESTION:

Well, when you say the board could

2

have gone either way, you don't mean that you know the

3

evidence and that, in fact, on the evidence, the board

4

could have gone either way.

5

case in which if the evidence showed there was

6

retaliation, they could award the fees, and if the

7

evidence did not show retaliation, they couldn't award the

8

fees.

You simply mean that it's a

Right?

9

MR. BASKIN:

10

QUESTION:

The 26 cases are -So, all we know is that in those

11

cases, they found retaliatory motive.

12

they're wrong.

13

MR. BASKIN:

We don't know that

Yes, that's -- that's what we know.

14

They found retaliatory motive.

And the limited point that

15

I'm making here at the end is that this retaliatory motive

16

idea is no more -- not enough protection under the NLRA

17

just as it is not enough protection -- and you've already

18

found it to be not enough protection -- under the

19

antitrust laws.

20

Estate standard is the correct standard and it's the only

21

one that protects employers' rights under the First

22

Amendment.

And that's why the Professional Real

23

Thank you.

24

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

25

The case is submitted.

Thank you, Mr. Baskin.
