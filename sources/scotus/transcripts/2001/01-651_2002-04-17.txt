Ms. Reid.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SARAH L. REID

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MS. REID:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:

11

The alienage diversity statute provides that the

12

Federal courts have original jurisdiction in civil actions

13

between citizens of different States and citizens who are

14

subjects of a foreign State where the matter in

15

controversy exceeds $75,000.

16

is whether respondent, Traffic Stream (BVI) Infrastructure

17

Limited, a corporation incorporated under the laws of the

18

British Virgin Islands, qualifies as a subject of the

19

United Kingdom within the meaning of that statute.

20

Petitioner, JPMorgan Chase Bank, submits it clearly does.

21

The question presented today

It is well-settled that the term, citizens and

22

subjects, applies to corporations and not just natural

23

persons.

24

one who owes allegiance to and is under the protection of

25

a foreign State.

It is also not controversial that a subject is

1

QUESTION:

Is this a question of Federal law?

2

MS. REID:

In terms of looking to the matter of

3

the subject?

4

QUESTION:

In determining who is a citizen or

5

subject of a foreign State, or whether a corporation in

6

this instance is a citizen or subject?

7

law question?

8
9

MS. REID:

Is that a Federal

Yes, Your Honor, we would submit it

is in the first instance, but in saying that we must then

10

look at the nature of the relationship and look at the

11

foreign State which is asserting the sovereignty, and

12

certainly that is a matter that we should consider

13

carefully.

14

expressed its sovereignty over respondent and over the

15

other residents and corporations of its overseas

16

territories.

17

In this case, the United Kingdom has clearly

QUESTION:

When you say the United Kingdom has

18

expressed its sovereignty, Ms. Reid, do you mean that

19

you're looking at their statutes, or that their diplomatic

20

representatives have made a representation?

21

MS. REID:

Both, both the fact that they have

22

intervened as an amicus in this and in other cases, but

23

also, particularly in the case of respondent, if one looks

24

at the BVI constitution enacted in 1976, it is enacted as

25

a result of the act of parliament and the order of
4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

parliament, and it reserves expressly all power to the

2

Crown ultimately, and it is only from the Crown that the

3

law is then delegated to the elected legislative council.

4

Each member of whom must swear allegiance to the Crown and

5

to the Queen.

6

The United Kingdom reserves the right to review,

7

approve, and ultimately disapprove any statute that is

8

enacted in the British Virgin Islands, which is a right

9

that they do exercise.

In this case, therefore, the

10

enabling or enacting statute which, under which respondent

11

is incorporated, is a direct result of the authority

12

granted from the Crown, so I would argue it is not just a

13

matter of the diplomatic relationship and the fact that

14

the United Kingdom is the external face for the British

15

Virgin Islands in terms of matters of defense and

16

international relations, but also the fact that all law is

17

derived ultimately from the Crown.

18

QUESTION:

Ms. Reid, every corporation must be

19

formed under the law of some sovereign, and if that's

20

right, a corporation just can't generate itself.

21

Is there any corporation that is formed under

22

the law of some sovereign other than the United States not

23

included within 1332, or is this just a very simple case

24

where every foreign corporation of course is organized

25

under the law of some State, and therefore would qualify.

1
2

Does your case involve anything more than that?
MS. REID:

I would say, Your Honor, in 99

3

percent of the cases, that you're right.

4

conceivable that you would have corporations organized by

5

someone who declares they are sovereign of some island

6

somewhere, but no one recognizes them as a sovereign, and

7

the United States would say, we know nothing of this

8

person, and know they can't be --

9
10

QUESTION:

I suppose it is

Then the United States would also say

that that's not a corporation.

11

MS. REID:

Right, exactly.

12

QUESTION:

So I think you could say in 100

13

percent of the cases if we acknowledge it as a

14

corporation, it will have been formed under the law of

15

some State.

16

MS. REID:

I would agree, Your Honor.

17

QUESTION:

And I suppose even as to natural

18

persons in this sort of eccentric island in the real

19

world, if we did not recognize their claim to individual

20

sovereignty or nationality, in the real world I assume

21

they would be subject to some other national sovereign and

22

they'd by that virtue, by virtue of that be swept up under

23

the term, citizen or subject, wouldn't they?

24

MS. REID:

I would agree.

25

QUESTION:

Yes.

Let's assume -- and I'm not sure that

this is an actual proposition of international law, that a

of that sovereign.

special obligation to obey the laws of the United States

that a British subject does not.

MS. REID:

Yes, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

-- subject?

13

MS. REID:

An analogy, though, not completely

14

perfect, but it -- you know, JPMorgan Chase is a

15

corporation organized under the laws of the State of New

16

York.

17

New York, but it also has obligations that it has to

18

follow under our Federal law.

19

QUESTION:

Yes.

20

MS. REID:

Similarly, a corporation set up under

It obviously has to follow the laws of the State of

the laws of applicable overseas territories in the first

22

legislative district, but they must also abide by agreed-

24

is specifically an issue in the Caribbean, where there are

certain financial disclosure, which is mandated in part

through the relationship, constitutional relationship

3

between the United Kingdom --

QUESTION:

5
6

Where can we document the proposition

that you've just stated?
MS. REID:

What do I look to?

To a certain extent, the treaty,

7

that -- for example the Narcotics Enforcement Treaty.

8

There are also the United Kingdom -- the one I'm thinking

9

of is their recent overruling on the homosexuality, which

10

we cited only to a newspaper article in our brief, will

11

demonstrate that.

12

The best sites are the web sites for the BVI and

13

for the United Kingdom, which detail the relationship

14

between these two entities, also the white paper we cited

15

to Your Honor written in, I believe, 1999, goes into great

16

detail about the relationships between the overseas

17

territories and the United Kingdom, what the authority and

18

sovereignty the United Kingdom has --

20
21

QUESTION:

No more established authority like

Blackstone, or -MS. REID:

Not that we have cited to Your Honor,

22

though in many ways there are parliamentary debates that

23

you can access concerning -- which are referenced in the

24

white papers -- concerning the relationships between the

25

overseas territories and the Queen, which were quite
8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

reminiscent of the debates before the American Revolution

2

in terms of virtual representation and --

3

QUESTION:

If we were dealing with a private

4

individual rather than a corporation, do you think there

5

could be a stateless person who wouldn't fit under this

6

statute?

7

MS. REID:

In very, very rare instances, and

8

those instances are where the individual had either

9

renounced their citizenship, which has on occasion

10

occurred, or where they have been, you know, exiled, and

11

have not yet acquired citizenship somewhere else, and we

12

would submit that the cases cited by the Matimak Court

13

deal with those kinds of statelessness.

14

QUESTION:

Suppose that kind of person that

15

Justice O'Connor and you just discussed, a true stateless

16

person, is temporarily in a port of Australia, San

17

Francisco, or Monterey, Mexico, can it be said

18

consistently with the statute here in question that they

19

are at least temporarily subject to the laws of Australia

20

while they are there, because they're stateless and they

21

have no other higher obligation, so they're then

22

subject --

23

MS. REID:

No.

I would submit that what subject

24

to you must mean is that you have an allegiance to a

25

sovereign, and the sovereign in turn has an obligation to
9
Alderson Reporting Company

you, including protection.
QUESTION:

It's not subject to.

The phrase is

subject of, isn't it?

4

MS. REID:

Yes, of a --

5

QUESTION:

Everybody living in a country is

6

subject to the laws of that country, and presumably to the

7

Government of that country, but they are not necessarily a

8

subject of that country.

9

MS. REID:

That is true, Your Honor.

10

QUESTION:

So there can be stateless persons who

11

are not within the clause.

12

MS. REID:

Yes.

13

QUESTION:

And the reason you take that

14

position, I take it, is that the impetus for the

15

constitutional grant was in effect to keep countries from

16

getting mad, rather than for purposes of extending

17

jurisdiction as such to everyone who one might want to sue

18

in a Federal court.

19

MS. REID:

Right.

I mean, we have argued that

20

there were two impetuses.

21

foreign entanglements by providing a neutral Federal

22

forum, and the other was the promotion of commerce.

23

QUESTION:

One is the prevention of

I must say, I didn't understand what

24

you mean by foreign entanglements.

Are you talking about

25

the foreign entanglements that George Washington warned us
10
Alderson Reporting Company

1

against?

2

MS. REID:

The --

3

QUESTION:

I mean, like alliances with France,

4

or things like that?

5

MS. REID:

What -No.

The foreign entanglements, when

6

one looks back at the Framers' discussion, seem to

7

envision that if the British debt could not be collected

8

we might find ourselves back in another war.

9

QUESTION:

We don't want to make them mad.

10

MS. REID:

We didn't want to make them mad.

11

QUESTION:

Okay.

12

MS. REID:

That, I think, was the entanglement

13

that they were worried about.

14

QUESTION:

It's a strange term for it, then.

15

MS. REID:

And just briefly on the issue of the

16

promotion of commerce, I wanted to make the point that

17

JPMorgan Chase Bank and the financial market, you know,

18

considered the Matimak decisions as ones who have

19

potentially very deleterious effects on international

20

commerce.

21

QUESTION:

Well, why?

Aren't New York courts --

22

this is not a question of saying for our corporation you

23

can't enter U.S. court.

24

court, and those courts are pretty savvy about commercial

25

matters, are they not?

They can enter a New York State

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MS. REID:

Absolutely, and I practice before

2

them frequently, but the perception on the part of

3

foreign -- foreigners is that the Federal system is one in

4

which procedures are uniform across the country, and a --

5

with predictability, perhaps, that is more a matter of

6

perception than of reality.

7
8
9

QUESTION:

I know Alabamans who are afraid of

New York courts.
(Laughter.)

10

MS. REID:

And vice versa.

11

QUESTION:

But it is a little different from

12

what it was in the days of the post revolution, when the

13

British creditor said State courts are simply going to let

14

them collect on their debts.

15

MS. REID:

That's true.

In this particular

16

case, the reason in large part that it was decided to go

17

into Federal courts is simply because we wanted to get as

18

speed a resolution as possible, and the State court system

19

has interlocutory appeals, which is just the way the

20

system works, and -- but it does often lead to additional

21

delay and we had noteholders who were insistent that we

22

try and get our collateral back as soon as possible.

23

QUESTION:

Anyway, you -- I think no one has

24

suggested a dynamic interpretation of 1332, so that if the

25

original rationale is not as strong today as it was then,
12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that somehow the meaning of 1332 would change.

2

MS. REID:

No.

I think it's -- the -- clearly

3

the United Kingdom at this point is, I guess one could say

4

at best, annoyed by this continuing refusal to recognize

5

their sovereignty over these types of entities, and the

6

fact is that you know, they have submitted an amicus brief

7

here, several other amicus briefs, two diplomatic notes,

8

so that the fear of the Framers of having an entanglement

9

of some sort with an ally is still, I think, valid today.

10
11

QUESTION:

No other circuit has followed the

Second Circuit, have they?

12

MS. REID:

No.

The Third Circuit has split

13

explicitly.

The Fourth and the Seventh Circuit have also

14

disagreed, though not -- they didn't discuss Matimak, and

15

one of them was earlier than Matimak, but no, there is no

16

other circuit that has followed this rule.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY P. MINEAR

2

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

3

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

4
5

MR. MINEAR:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

6

The United States submits that corporations

7

organized under the United Kingdom overseas territories

8

are citizens or subjects of a foreign State for purposes

9

of alienage diversity jurisdiction.

We reach that

10

conclusion based on the plain language of 1332.

Section

11

1332's operative term, subject, describes a personal

12

entity that is amenable to foreign authority in the sense

13

that it owes allegiance to that foreign State and is

14

entitled to the protection of that foreign State.

15

term quite clearly embraces a corporation created by a

16

foreign State.

17

Steamship Company v. Tugman 120 years ago.

That

This Court recognized that principle in

18

The crucial issue in this case is whether the

19

United Kingdom exercises sufficient sovereign authority

20

over the British Virgin Islands such that citizens and

21

corporations can be said to be subject to the United

22

Kingdom's rules, and we think the answer to that is

23

clearly yes.

24

United Kingdom's sovereignty over the British Virgin

25

Islands.

The United States expressly recognizes the

We do so through treaties such as the Consulate

1

Convention that we have with the United Kingdom.

2

recognize it through our diplomatic relations with the

3

United Kingdom.

4

Kingdom's claim here of sovereignty over the British

5

Virgin Islands.

6

We also

Now, we fully support the United

In addition, if the Court needs to look further,

7

and we think it does not, it's clear from the British

8

Virgin Islands' constitution that the United Kingdom has

9

retained its sovereignty over the British Virgin Islands.

10

That constitution expressly states that the United Kingdom

11

reserves full power to exercise and pass laws for the good

12

government, order, and peace of the British Virgin

13

Islands.

14

We think the language of section 1332

15

conclusively resolves this case, but if the Court needs to

16

look further still, then we think the policies that

17

underlie section 1332 further buttress the conclusion that

18

we reach.

19

QUESTION:

Mr. Minear, what if the -- say, the

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. MINEAR:

We think that you should defer on

2

the United States views on these matters.

3

disagreements between the United Kingdom and the United

4

States, that's a matter for the State Department to deal

5

with, but this Court's own decisions, cases such as Jones

6

v. The United States, which is at 137 U.S. 202, explicitly

7

state that questions of sovereignty are political

8

questions that are entrusted to the political branches.

9

QUESTION:

As far as

Well then, if you were to submit the

10

views of the State Department in a case like that, no

11

matter what else there is in the record, we should accept

12

the views of the State Department?

13
14

MR. MINEAR:

Your cases suggest that that is the

result that would follow.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. MINEAR:

Yes, but do you have a position -Yes, we do.

To answer pointedly,

17

yes, we do believe that you should defer to the United

18

States views, because oftentimes on the question -- let me

19

distinguish here that the question of subject is, of

20

course, the meaning of that term is a legal question that

21

this Court would interpret according to its normal

22

practices, but the question of whether a foreign entity is

23

a foreign State is a question that is properly entrusted

24

to the political branches.

25

We believe that the Second Circuit's decision
16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

stands alone here because it is quite plainly wrong.

2

Third Circuit has expressly rejected it, and the Fourth

3

Circuit and the Seventh Circuit have not followed it.

4

Under these circumstances, we think it is appropriate for

5

the Court to reverse the decision below and remand the

6

case for further proceedings.

7

QUESTION:

9

The

Can you comment on the stateless

person problem, not a legal person?
MR. MINEAR:

But an individual.

Yes, we can

10

conceive that there can be such a thing as a stateless

11

person, and we cannot believe that section 1332 by its

12

plain language would reach a person who is not a citizen

13

or a subject of a foreign State.

14

sufficient.

15

is vanishingly small, and as was pointed out in the

16

earlier discussion, the idea of a stateless corporation is

17

an oxymoron, as Judge Altimari had stated.

18

Pure alienage is not

Nevertheless, the class of stateless persons

21

residing in Switzerland.

22

MR. MINEAR:

Let's take a U.S. citizen who is

That is correct.

That is correct,

23

and again, we think the courts have consistently answered

24

these questions by adherence to the plain language of the

25

jurisdictional provisions.

For instance, for many years,
17

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

until Congress dealt with the issue, citizens of the

2

District of Columbia were not entitled to ordinary

3

diversity jurisdiction, but these are matters that we

4

think are best resolved by looking closely at the language

5

that Congress has provided in the jurisdictional

6

provisions.

MR. ALBERT:

QUESTION:

9

You're now relying on English law, I

I'm referring to English law, yes.
Yes.

I think that creates some

difficulty for United States courts, particularly when the

10

U.K. is making representations here as to one point, then

11

you tell us we have to read English law, which we're much

12

less familiar with, of course, than American law.

13

MR. ALBERT:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

Under Rule

14

44.1 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a court can

15

look to any source for finding where --

16

QUESTION:

I realize that.

It's not that we're

17

somehow disqualified from it, but it makes it a much more

18

difficult inquiry.

19

MR. ALBERT:

It would be a much more difficult

20

inquiry had the United Kingdom actually cited to any

21

statute or any case ever decided in any English court

22

anywhere on the subject, but it is --

23

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Albert, even if the British

24

Nationality can be read as saying that corporations formed

25

in the British Virgin Islands are not citizens, it doesn't

MR. ALBERT:

Well, actually, the British

3

Nationality Act carves out classes of citizens, and

4

classes of subjects, and persons who are neither citizens

5

nor subjects, so in fact it --

6

QUESTION:

I just didn't find anything that

7

indicated to me that a corporation formed in the British

8

Virgin Island was not a subject of the U.K., and we are

9

dealing here with a brief filed by the U.K. that says they

10
11

are subjects, so what do we -MR. ALBERT:

Well, I think that the question

12

here is whether the deference should be unyielding to a

13

litigation and advocacy position which the British

14

Government puts forth in its briefs versus the substantive

15

basis for that position which one would find in a statute.

16

QUESTION:

Just looking at it from an American,

17

U.S. perspective under the statute, citizens are subjects,

18

and the fact that it is a corporation formed in the

19

British Virgin Islands would lead me to conclude that is a

20

subject of a foreign nation under our own statute.

21

MR. ALBERT:

Respectfully, Justice O'Connor, I

22

think that the conclusion ought to be different, because

23

there is nothing with -- the first step in the inquiry is,

24

what would 1332(a)(2) have to say about corporations, and

25

we know that 1332(a)(2) is a reference to citizens or

2

fiction was adopted had resulted in severe conflict over

3

whether there was jurisdiction for corporations at all.

4

What this Court did in Letson was adopted the

5

fiction not that the corporations were citizens or

6

subjects, but that the corporations would be deemed to be

7

citizens or subjects by virtue of the imputed citizenship

8

of its shareholders and, applying the same principle here,

9

you would impute the citizenship of the -- the citizenship

10

of natural persons resident within the British Virgin

11

Islands to a British Virgin Islands --

QUESTION:

That's going back to a law that has

long since become obsolete.

tremendous disparity between our modern view of what a

19

U.S. corporation is and the rest of the world when we

20

don't even really think of the corporation as an entity in

21

itself but say it's stuck by what its shareholder

citizenship is.

MR. ALBERT:

Why should there be such a

Respectfully, Justice Ginsburg,

24

1332(c) does not say that corporations are citizens of

25

their States.

It says that for purposes of diversity they

are deemed to be citizens of these States.

2

counting rule, not a citizenship rule, and hence, the

3

Letson fiction still obtains.

4

it adopted the 1332(c) language was to restrict the scope

5

of diversity jurisdiction by providing a second political

6

jurisdiction, principal place of business, which would

7

further limit the number of diversity cases which were

8

appearing in Federal courts.

9

It is a

All that Congress did when

This Court has never held that corporations were

10

political citizens or political subjects.

11

deems them to be so, and taking that a step further, it is

12

Congress' choice, because Congress' language in 1332(a)(2)

13

is that only citizens or subjects -- it does not use the

14

word aliens or anything broader -- are subject to

15

diversity jurisdiction.

16
17
18

QUESTION:

Only 1332(c)

Are you saying those words cover only

human individuals and not corporations?
MR. ALBERT:

For 1332(a)(2), humans, then

19

applying the 1332(c) presumption, that would bring

20

corporations within the scope of diversity jurisdiction.

21
22
23

QUESTION:

Well, 1332(a) does use the term,

aliens at the very end.
MR. ALBERT:

Yes, there is a reference to it,

24

but not in the provision of 1332(a)(2) on the extension of

25

that dispute between citizens of a State and citizens or

2

Justice, Congress in fact had used the word, aliens, the

3

broader word, in the original enactment, in the Judiciary

4

Act of 1789, but Congress abandoned that language when it

5

revised the statute in 1875.

6

QUESTION:

Is a Spanish corporation -- as I

7

say -- is that -- does that come within 1332 jurisdiction,

8

a corporation formed in Scotland?

9

MR. ALBERT:

In Scotland, yes, because a --

10

because the Scottish people, the English and Welsh people,

11

and the people of Northern Ireland all are citizens of the

12

Metropolitan United Kingdom, the United Kingdom of Great

13

Britain and Northern Ireland.

14

QUESTION:

Well, my problem is if -- take

15

some -- the British Virgin Islands, a place that's still

16

held in something like colonial status, that you say that

17

Scotland, which has a great deal more independence,

18

belongs to the U.K. in the sense that it is a subject of

19

the U.K., but the British Virgin Islands, or the Cayman

20

Islands, that have less independence, are not subjects?

21

That may be something a lawyer could understand, but I

22

don't think it makes much sense, does it?

23

MR. ALBERT:

I think that the distinction is, no

24

one is disputing here that the British Virgin Islands is

25

subordinate to the United Kingdom, no one is disputing
23
Alderson Reporting Company

that its people ultimately are answerable to the authority

2

of the United Kingdom, but that simply goes --

3
4

QUESTION:

Does it make them subject --

subjects?

5

MR. ALBERT:

Subject to, not subject of, and

6

that is why the British Nationality Act is so important

7

here.

8
9

QUESTION:

If it's so important, I guess then

maybe corporations incorporated in Scotland are not

10

citizens and subjects either, because it doesn't say

11

anything about corporations, does it?

12

MR. ALBERT:

13

QUESTION:

No, Justice Breyer.
Wouldn't people then be surprised if

14

it doesn't say anything, if we said that Scottish

15

corporations weren't citizens, or -- in fact, wouldn't the

16

people who live in these islands be a little surprised if

17

the Supreme Court were to say, you're not nationals?

18

does it work?

This is not an act that refers to

MR. ALBERT:

The proper allegation in a case

QUESTION:

As of English law, the reason that --

although their law says, I guess, the counselor law, the

10

diplomatic manual,the thing that says you have to swear

11

allegiance if you're in the British foreign -- you know,

12

you're in the British Virgin Islands, all the laws are

13

subject to British authority and so forth, so the reason,

14

in your opinion, despite all those things they list in

15

their brief, that makes it very, very similar, the reason

16

that a corporation incorporated in Wales is a citizen of

the United Kingdom or subject of the United Kingdom but

18

these are not, because it's the British Virgin Islands,

20

MR. ALBERT:

Because when parliament enacts a

law of general applicability within the United Kingdom,

22

its applicability is to those four jurisdictions that I've

mentioned, England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland,

does not, of its force, extend to the British Overseas

diplomatic notes in which it asserts that it views these

The

They are subjects because of the

potential of the exercise of that power.
MR. ALBERT:

The land that sits in the middle of

16

London at Leicester Square, the famous Tolk v. Moxie Land,

17

is subject to the sovereignty of the United Kingdom, but

18

that does not make the land a subject, and so the mere

19

fact that the United Kingdom adopts legislation which

20

regulates behavior of its people, both within the

21

metropolitan United Kingdom and within its territories,

22

does not mean that the people within its territories are

23

subjects for purposes of 1332, and I say that especially

24

in light of the fact that as we stand here today the

25

United Kingdom has adopted a new statute which has not yet

come into force, because a statutory instrument has not

2

yet been signed for it, which will render the British

3

Territories' citizens to be British citizens, giving those

4

British citizens now the right of abode within the United

5

Kingdom, and that will happen in the future.

6

will happen soon, maybe in a matter of months, maybe in a

7

matter of years, but it has not happened yet, and we

8

determine subject matter jurisdiction as of the time of

9

the commencement of --

QUESTION:

It probably

How does that affect a corporation?

11

You're talking about what will be the status of

12

individuals.

13

MR. ALBERT:

I think that a -- that applying --

14

that the proper way to apply the Letson principle here is

15

that a British Virgin Islands Corporation should never be

16

subject to diversity jurisdiction precisely because the

17

presumption is that its shareholders have opted for

18

British Virgin Islands status rather than opted for

19

British status.

20

QUESTION:

And that would be the case -- it

21

would be -- the Congress would be immobile as well.

22

order to make -- if I follow your argument correctly, in

23

order to make a BVI corporation subject to 1332

24

jurisdiction, there would have to be a constitutional

25

amendment, because the Constitution uses the same words

In

4

QUESTION:

The Second Circuit did not reach

That's what I'm putting to you,

5

because the statute uses the same term, citizens or

6

subjects.

7

MR. ALBERT:

I do not think that there is a

8

presumption in this Court that the use of the same

9

language in Article 3 and in title 28 means that the

10

statute has --

11

QUESTION:

Well, tell me what subject means

12

within Article 3 that it doesn't mean within 1332 and why

13

a court should interpret it -- interpret them differently.

14

MR. ALBERT:

Because if you look to the

15

Judiciary Act of 1789, which was adopted nearly

16

contemporaneously, Congress used the broader language,

17

alien, rather than the narrower language, citizen or

18

subject, and --

19

QUESTION:

That's not -- the Constitution says

20

citizen or subject, doesn't it?

21

MR. ALBERT:

22

QUESTION:

That's correct, it does, and -What does it mean -- what does

23

subject mean within the Constitution, within Article 3, as

24

it reads?

25

MR. ALBERT:

It would be mere speculation on my
37

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

part to suggest what it was that they meant, since this

2

was one of the least debated provisions of the

3

Constitution.

4

QUESTION:

But you're urging a certain statutory

5

interpretation, and you said, well, maybe it has a

6

different meaning, the word subject, in the Constitution,

7

so I'm asking you to tell me what could be those different

8

meanings.

9

MR. ALBERT:

I think that it is entirely

10

possible that in 1787 Congress -- the Convention intended

11

to extend the grant of authority to the full measure of

12

diversity jurisdiction over cases involving all

13

foreigners, but the reason that I don't think that they

14

focused on the issue was because in 1787 there really were

15

not these cases of -- there were not a lot of cases,

16

probably no cases in which there were people who lacked

17

subjectship yet nevertheless were foreigners.

18

With respect to these trading colonies in

19

particular, the people who were involved in the mercantile

20

trade involving these Caribbean colonies were not people

21

who were resident within those colonies --

22

QUESTION:

What about Canadians?

Until Canada

23

domesticated its constitution, I suppose for most of the

24

19th Century Canadians were not subjects of the Crown?

25

MR. ALBERT:

I think Canadians were subjects of
38

Alderson Reporting Company

1

the Crown by virtue of the fact that they were in a

2

settler colony rather than in a plantation, a plantation

3

colony, and the -- one of the difficulties of the British

4

law of that entire era is that it never really had a

5

uni -- it never had a uniform picture of who its persons

6

were, and what the relationship was between the Crown and

7

each one of the different types of colonies that were

8

created, and it was very, very difficult for the -- it was

9

very difficult for Britain, because Britain had different

10

types of colonies which promoted different types of

11

British interests, and therefore it created different

12

types of Governments within them, and created different

13

statuses with respect to immigration and migration to

14

Europe for those people.

15

QUESTION:

So among the subjects, or -- well,

16

the entities that are under U.K. sovereignty, which are

17

those are subjects and which of them are not?

18

MR. ALBERT:

The ones which are certainly not

19

subjects right now are those which are the British

20

Overseas Territories, which include the British Virgin

21

Islands, the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, the Turks and

22

Caicos --

Thank you, Mr. Albert.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. REID:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

this Court:
I will try to be brief.

I would like to

separate the inquiry between corporations and then address

24

natural persons.

the laws of their legislative district.

Corporations are incorporated through

are incorporated, rather like our States, corporations in

Northern Ireland are incorporated under the laws of

I think his answer was that if

10

they're formed under Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland,

11

they're okay, but if they're formed under BVI, they're

12

not.

13

MS. REID:

Right.

I think he may have

14

inadvertently been in error, because the Northern Ireland

law than those of the ones in England, but the point is

the same.

In terms of the natural citizens, I just wanted

23

to point -- the British Nationality Act, of course, has no

24

applications to corporations, and the analysis that

25

somehow we should adopt the old Letson rule is
41
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

inapplicable both because it's United Kingdom law, we have

2

no learning -- I mean, United States law, no learning on

3

what -- how the United Kingdom would do it, but it seems

4

sensible to adopt the more modern view, but the 1981

5

Nationality Act, interestingly, in schedule 5 to section

6

41, in terms of naturalization and becoming a citizen or a

7

British Overseas Citizen, or a British, what was then

8

known as Dependent Territory citizen, you're required to

9

take the following oath of allegiance:

I, name, swear by

10

Almighty God that on becoming a British Dependent

11

Territory citizen I will be faithful and bear true

12

allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, her heirs

13

and successors, according to law.

14

I submit to you that that is the definition of a

15

subject, and of allegiance, and that really is --

16

demonstrates that the United Kingdom has come before this

17

Court not as a litigation posture, because it has no

18

interest really in any of these cases, but as a concern

19

over the fact that its sovereignty is not being recognized

20

by the judiciary when it has been recognized by the United

21

States Government in numerous treaties, and again, I won't

22

read them, but I would simply refer you to the Consular

23

Convention and footnote 17 of the United Kingdom's brief,

24

which details the numerous treaties that have been entered

25

into governing the British Virgin Islands and other of the
