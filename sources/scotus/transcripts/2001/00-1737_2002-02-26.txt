ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. POLIDORO

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. POLIDORO:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
It's 11:00 Saturday morning in the Village of

11
12

Stratton.

13

made a special effort to come to your door to speak to you

14

about what the Prophet Isaiah has referred to as something

15

better.

16

the good news of the Kingdom of God.

17

Good morning.

In light of recent events, I've

That's the good news Christ Jesus spoke about,

It is a criminal act to go from door to door in

18

the Village of Stratton and deliver that message unless

19

one has first obtained a permit from the village to do so.

20

It is also illegal to go from door to door and hand out a

21

leaflet that says, democracy is wonderful, please vote

22

next week.

23

In drafting a permit scheme designed to address

24

fraud and privacy that includes those interested in pure

25

discourse, Stratton has eliminated the ability to engage

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

in door-to-door, one-on-one political advocacy.

2

we submit the ordinance is overbroad and unconstitutional.

3

QUESTION:

As such,

I don't see how it has eliminated any

4

chance of a political -- going door to door in a political

5

discourse if you register with the mayor and you can't be

6

turned down if you fill out that form.

7

door, except where there's a no-trespassing sign.

8
9

MR. POLIDORO:

You can go door to

Your Honor, we are not suggesting

at all that a resident cannot post a no-trespassing sign

10

and keep all away from their door.

However, in order to

11

get the right to go to that door, one must go to the

12

mayor, give his name, give a brief description of the

13

cause they want to speak about, as well as their

14

association or affiliation.
We believe that this Court in McIntyre said

15
16

there's an interest in having anonymous works enter the

17

marketplace of ideas, and that unquestionably outweighs

18

any interest in requiring disclosure as a precondition to

19

entry.

20

QUESTION:

Well, do you focus on the right of

21

anonymity, or the right of unrestricted speech, as of the

22

time you get to the door, or when you go to the mayor's

23

office, because our most recent cases talk about going to

24

the door, and that's where your brief focuses on.

25

It seems to me that what you've begun with, and

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

it's also troubling to me, is that you have to make the

2

disclosure to the mayor as well, so I take it those are

3

two different parts of your case.

4

MR. POLIDORO:

5

QUESTION:

Correct, Justice Kennedy.

But you emphasize only the latter,

6

really, in your briefs.

7

keeps, are they open to the public?

8
9

MR. POLIDORO:
Your Honor.

Are the records that the mayor

They are, absolutely, indeed,

Under Ohio State law those records are open

10

to the public, so anyone would be able to go to look at

11

the record, which would include the name, your message,

12

and your associations.

13
14

QUESTION:

So you would have no objection to

this statute if you didn't have to give your name?

15

MR. POLIDORO:

16

QUESTION:

Your Honor, we --

It's perfectly okay to say, you can't

17

talk to anybody without getting a permit, so long as you

18

don't have to give your name when you get the permit?

19
20
21

MR. POLIDORO:

Your Honor, we believe the name

is the constitutional infirmity in deed.
QUESTION:

That's the only problem, so if this

22

were revised somehow so that all you had to give was a

23

reference, maybe somebody in the community who would vouch

24

for the integrity of these Jehovah's Witnesses, that would

25

then be okay, because they wouldn't have to --

1

MR. POLIDORO:

2

QUESTION:

Your Honor --

The only problem is if they have to

3

give their name.

4

have objected to the necessity of going to the mayor and

5

saying, please, Mr. Mayor, can I talk to your citizens

6

going house-to-house, but that's not your problem.

7

only problem is that you have to disclose your identity.

8
9

You see, I would have thought you would

MR. POLIDORO:

No, Your Honor.

Your

We do not

believe that anyone needs to go to the Government for

10

permission to speak to their neighbor about any message,

11

most importantly, a message --

12
13

QUESTION:

I think that's the strongest part of

your case.

14

MR. POLIDORO:

15

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

But you call them neighbors, but I

16

take it in many cases they're simply strangers who come

17

into town.

18

MR. POLIDORO:

Well, actually, Your Honor, in

19

this circumstance the Village of Wellsville, which is a

20

neighboring village, has assumed responsibility for

21

preaching door to door in the Village of Stratton, and

22

many individuals are, in fact, known to each other, and

23

that's common in most areas of this country.

24

believe that one is required to go to the Government to

25

get permission to speak to a private resident owner when

We don't

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the power belongs to that private resident owner to keep

2

all away from their door if that owner so chooses.

3

QUESTION:

Can you tell me why that is?

I agree

4

that at some level it seems contrary to our traditions,

5

but if we can focus just on going to the mayor's office,

6

it seems to me that one of the strongest parts of your

7

case is that you have to identify your cause.

8

problematic to me.

9

what is the root constitutional principle that's violated

10

That seems

Is that part of your case, and if so,

there?
MR. POLIDORO:

11

Your Honor, Jehovah's Witnesses

12

have a long historical memory as to what they've suffered

13

at the hands of municipalities --

14

QUESTION:

Well --

15

MR. POLIDORO:

-- purely to go door to door to

16

speak the good news.

17

compelling disclosure of name, cause, and associational

18

information.
QUESTION:

19
20
21

In this instance, the village is

What's wrong with identifying the

cause?
MR. POLIDORO:

Your Honor, we believe that under

22

this Court's holding there are some individuals who do not

23

want to identify their cause.

24

McIntyre said, to official retaliation, to economic

25

retaliation, to social ostracism, and perhaps, as McIntyre

It opens them up, as

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

said, they just don't want to disclose more of their

2

privacy than they have to.

3

We don't believe that on this record the village

4

has shown a necessity to so incumber pure discourse that

5

is not the source of harm.

6

case that pure religious speech, or pure political speech,

7

cause the harm that the village seeks to protect its

8

residents against.

9

QUESTION:

There's no allegation in this

But I take it your argument only goes

10

to the political speech, because as I understand it,

11

Jehovah's Witnesses do not object to identifying

12

themselves, and your concern is with the overbreadth that

13

goes into the political sphere, is that correct?
MR. POLIDORO:

14

That is absolutely correct,

15

Justice Souter.

Jehovah's Witnesses will, indeed,

16

identify themselves at the door, but it's their personal

17

decision to do so.
QUESTION:

18

And yet the question that you phrase

19

says that this permit, which contains one's name, now,

20

when we turn to the village's brief, they say, no, it

21

doesn't.

22

to have your name at the mayor's office, the mayor has to

23

accept all-comers, as long as you're not fraudulent.

24

There's no discretion that is what infected the old

25

prohibitions against the Jehovah Witnesses' speech, so

The permit doesn't require any names.

You have

2

mayor's office.

3

the homeowner.

4

The name is at the

The name doesn't have to be disclosed to

Now, you said in your brief the name has to be

5

disclosed to the homeowner.

6

it doesn't, so which one is right?

7

MR. POLIDORO:

They say in their brief, no,

Justice Ginsburg, if I might, at

8

the joint appendix on page 248a there's a copy of the

9

blank permit and it says, permit to canvass, to solicit,

10

et cetera, and it says, in accordance with the relevant

11

provision of the statute, the mayor of the Village of

12

Stratton, Ohio, has issued to the above applicant a

13

permit, the above applicant a permit, so we believe on the

14

plain language of the permit, the name is, indeed,

15

disclosed.

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. POLIDORO:

18

QUESTION:

MR. POLIDORO:

25

That's correct, with respect to

Jehovah's Witnesses.
QUESTION:

23
24

So you don't know, as a matter of

practical fact, how that would work out?

21
22

We never did, Chief Justice

Rehnquist.

19
20

Did you ever apply for a permit?

It might be a number, applicant

number 5.
MR. POLIDORO:

There's no showing, Justice

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Souter, in the ordinance that there's any sort of

2

numbering scheme.

3

QUESTION:

Well, no, there's no -- that's the

4

trouble, I think, with the argument.

5

but I suppose the exhibit is consistent with a numbering

6

as well as a naming system on the permit card.

7

MR. POLIDORO:

There is no showing,

But Justice Souter, I believe the

8

exhibit would be inconsistent with the concession of the

9

village that name disclosure is, in fact, required at the

10

door.

11

their brief, they do say that name identity is compelled

12

to be disclosed by a resident or by a police officer in

13

further of his official business.

14

At page 27 of their brief, and page 29 to 30 of

QUESTION:

They said about five times in their

15

brief that the permit that must be shown to the police

16

officer or the homeowner does not have a name on it --

17

does not have a name on it.

18

this -- I looked at this and said, well, maybe this is the

19

bottom -- you have the application, then, you know, you

20

tear off the bottom, and this is the bottom, and the

21

applicant is above, but the permit that you put in your

22

pocket doesn't have that name.

Now, it's very confusing, but

23

If that's the case, then why isn't this case

24

just like the Buckley case, where this Court said, the

25

badge doesn't have to have the name on it, but we

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

recognize that the Colorado law also says that with every

2

set of petitions the circulator has to have an affidavit,

3

and that affidavit is filed with the petition, so there is

4

an official record of the name and the address of the

5

circulator.

6

Why isn't this just the same thing?

MR. POLIDORO:

It's different for two reasons,

7

Justice Ginsburg.

First, Buckley dealt with the mechanics

8

of the electoral process, and clearly that's a compelling

9

governmental interest to ensure there's no corruption in

10

that process.

11

herself part of that process.

12

that you submit your name when you submit the affidavits.

13

We have something different here indeed.

14

pure speech unrelated to the mechanics of the electoral

15

process.

16

The circulator in Buckley wanted to make
The rules of that game are

We have just

The interesting -QUESTION:

I thought you were saying it only

17

applied to those who were engaged in the political -- I

18

thought that was the point of your overbreadth objection.

19

MR. POLIDORO:

I think there's a distinction,

20

Justice Souter, to just pure speech, the dissemination of

21

information and ideas, and speech that in some way

22

involves the mechanics of the electoral process.

23

going to do something with the information that you obtain

24

from that householder, and then submit yourself to an

25

area, an arena that the Government has a right to have

3

religion or politics, to have a play there.

4

We don't submit that the Government does

QUESTION:

But one of your examples was that

5

door to door solicitation of signatures for an initiative

6

to put on the ballot, and that's exactly what was involved

7

in the Buckley case.

8
9

MR. POLIDORO:

Yes, Justice Ginsburg, but that

disclosure took place after the one-on-one dissemination

10

of information was done.

11

to submit those affidavits, she could have maintained her

12

anonymity.

13

compel you --

The question is, when can the Government

QUESTION:

14

If that individual did not want

She could not have been a circulator,

15

then, because a condition of being a circulator -- she

16

could not have submitted her petition, because to submit

17

her petition she has to have this affidavit, and I don't

18

see -- I really can't see any difference in consequence

19

whether the official form is made before or made after.

20

The point is that the name and address is in an official

21

record.

22

MR. POLIDORO:

Because of the compelling

23

governmental interest that's involved, Justice Ginsburg,

24

and that's the distinction.

When we have one-on-one --

Your Honor, the record is

absolutely clear, in the Village of Stratton, Jehovah's

the record is equally clear that sometimes they will

basis if someone's interested in reading it.

5

send that out.

6

QUESTION:

We would

So you said just -- you briefly

mentioned -- because you know, I've had many fine

conversations with Jehovah's Witnesses.

I've never noticed any of them objecting to anything about

10

giving their name.

11

that for some reason this particular group objects to

12

giving their name?

I mean, is this a real issue here,

What's the situation?

MR. POLIDORO:

13

But

No, Your Honor, Jehovah's

14

Witnesses have no objection to giving their name.

15

objection to giving their name comes in the realm of

16

anonymous political discourse.

17

felt that this ordinance, which is designed to regulate

18

business transactions, need not have reached pure

19

religious speech, need not have reached pure political

20

speech.

21

QUESTION:

The

Jehovah's Witnesses have

But you would say that without

22

reference to the name.

23

have to go to the mayor and ask for permission to talk to

24

a neighbor about something that's interesting?

25

MR. POLIDORO:

Isn't your position that you don't

That's correct, Your Honor.

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

That's quite correct.
QUESTION:

Is that here in front of us?

I mean,

3

what I'm having a hard time getting our hands on is, it

4

looks as if a group of people who really don't mind giving

5

their name are objecting to the name of a different group

6

of people who might not, and those might be people who

7

might want to say, vote for Smith, and what's worrying me

8

about deciding this case in the context which is obvious

9

from the briefs is, that might have considerable legal

10

implications for the question of whether you can require

11

disclosure of campaign contributions, which is a totally

12

different issue, but would seem legally related, so I'd

13

appreciate those three things that I've mentioned -- you

14

see what I'm -- what the blur is in my mind, and I'd

15

appreciate your views on that.

16

MR. POLIDORO:

Justice Breyer, it has been our

17

contention that the ordinance was drafted in an overbroad

18

manner, meaning reaching speech that was not the source of

19

harm, including our religious speech, but also including

20

pure political speech.

21

those interested in anonymous political discourse, that

22

was under this Court's overbreadth doctrine, and we don't

23

believe that the Court has to wait until a violation takes

24

place to remove this potential weapon, some sort of weapon

25

from the hands of the village.

When we put forth the interest of

QUESTION:

Of course, to do that we would just

2

say, you can't require the names to be disclosed.

3

still require you to check in with the mayor before you go

4

door to door.

MR. POLIDORO:

Your Honor, we don't see how --

know.

MR. POLIDORO:

13

We can

That's okay, then,

No, Justice Scalia.

That's what you want us to do?
No, not at all.

We don't

believe --

14

QUESTION:

I didn't think so.

15

MR. POLIDORO:

We don't believe that this Court

16

should sanction a regulation of a Government that requires

17

one citizen to get a license to speak to another citizen

18

at that citizen's home.

19

QUESTION:

Okay, but the basis -- as I

20

understand the nub of your argument is -- goes back to

21

your answer to Justice Ginsburg, and that is -- in

22

distinguishing Buckley, and I think what you were saying

23

was, in Buckley the Government had an interest because it

24

had an interest in checking the veracity of the

25

endorsement solicitation, the petition solicitation

16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

process, are these real people, go to the person who asked

2

and check, whereas here, if we're not talking about the

3

solicitation of money and of signatures in a political

4

sphere, there's nothing for the Government to verify, and

5

therefore there is no interest here, whereas there was an

6

interest in Buckley, and that's the distinction.

7

I --

8

MR. POLIDORO:

9

QUESTION:

Is -- am

Precisely.

-- stating your argument correctly?

10

MR. POLIDORO:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. POLIDORO:

13

QUESTION:

Precisely, Justice Souter.

Okay.
Precisely.

The brief didn't mention -- you took

14

Buckley as being 100 percent in your favor, and that's

15

what surprised me, is that Buckley made the very

16

MR. POLIDORO:

Your Honor, I think that Buckley

20

followed on language in Your Honor's portion of the

21

opinion in McIntyre, where you spoke to limited -- there

22

might be larger circumstances where identification might

23

be required, and in the electoral process, the mechanics

24

of how an election works, those are larger purposes.

25

We don't think those larger purposes are present

QUESTION:

You have in your case -- most of the

3

Jehovah's Witnesses cases dealt with that official who was

exercising discretion to keep out the Witnesses but

5

letting in the Republicans, and that was that line of

6

cases.

Then we have the, what I call the Village Green
McIntyre would fit in that category.

But is there any precedent for saying that if
you want to go into private homes in this town, we want to

10

know who you are, and -- but anybody, that applies to

11

anybody, and we will give the permit to anybody.

12

MR. POLIDORO:

Justice Ginsburg, the only

13

precedent that I'm aware of with respect to identification

14

schemes comes from the dicta in Cantwell and Martin that

15

speaks about a municipality, a municipality's interest in

16

knowing strangers in the community when connected with the

17

solicitation of funds.

18

QUESTION:

I don't believe there's any --

Don't you think that the practice

19

around the country of various towns and cities is to

require permits for people to go door to door in

21

residential areas?

22

that probably does that.

24

incidents in the area, and they want to identify the

MR. POLIDORO:

Justice O'Connor, my experience

2

is quite to the opposite, that after the battles between

3

Jehovah's Witnesses and the municipalities in the thirties

4

and forties, municipalities have stopped attempting to

5

regulate Jehovah's Witnesses by forcing them to get a

6

permit to go from door to door.

7

that we're having in the past few years, that more and

8

more municipalities are now requiring not only a permit

9

but, as Justice Scalia touched on, finger-printing.

10

QUESTION:

This is an experience

Well, there was a story in the paper

11

just last week here about the double murder up at

12

Dartmouth, how the kids who did it went from house to

13

house purporting to be taking a survey, and then what they

14

were actually doing was casing the houses for robbery, so

15

that's certainly something that a municipality can take

16

into consideration, isn't it?

17

MR. POLIDORO:

Chief Justice Rehnquist, we think

18

it's implausible to think that someone intent on

19

committing a violent crime would stop at the city hall to

20

get a permit or in any way be deterred, and in the

21

circumstance Your Honor posits of someone just going door

22

to door and observing, or taking notes, the ordinance in

23

this instance doesn't prevent that.

MR. POLIDORO:

ordinance.

It's the --

what are your best cases for the proposition that it is

MR. POLIDORO:

MR. POLIDORO:

Of -- I'm sorry, it's our brief

7

and its business or purpose as may be reasonably necessary

Now, in this instance --

That has been taken out of the case.

11

MR. POLIDORO:

12

QUESTION:

No.

No, Justice --

I thought that the only thing that

13

the mayor asked -- isn't -- wasn't there something in the

14

district court opinion that cut that back?

15

MR. POLIDORO:

No, Your Honor.

That is still

16

very much in the case, and very much part of the case.

The only thing the district court cut out was the

reference to Jehovah's Witnesses in the administrative

No, it --

Even if that's so, I mean, where a

slight state of confusion is, I thought this case now

sounds very theoretical.

Now I get into it, and I discover we don't know

if they require the name on a permit.

12

well it had to do with requiring the name when you go to

because your group doesn't mind, but you're trying to talk

through somebody else.

discretion with the mayor.

12

MR. POLIDORO:

Well, in .01, where does the

definition exclude people with a cause, like Justice

QUESTION:

I mean, unless you're interpreting

include Jehovah's Witnesses -- why are Jehovah's Witnesses

ordinance goes much -- sweeps much more widely than the

solicitation of funds, so footnote 14 doesn't support the

11

ordinance that is now before us.

12

MR. CANTOR:

I'm going to suggest to Your Honor

13

that it does, and the reason that it does is because it

requires identification information, and that

15

identification information is necessary regardless of

16

whether someone is going to solicit funds, or whether or

17

not he is going to go door to door for some other purpose,

The pre-registration format is probably closer

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID M. GORMLEY

2

ON BEHALF OF OHIO, ET AL., AS AMICUS CURIAE,

3

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

4
5

MR. GORMLEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

6

The ordinance in this case differs from the

7

statute in McIntyre in two critical ways.

First, it

8

applies only when someone goes onto the private property

9

of a village resident.

Of course, in McIntyre, that Ohio

10

statute required Mrs. McIntyre to put her name on a piece

11

of paper wherever she wanted to distribute it, on a public

12

sidewalk, even in her own home, outside a polling place,

13

anywhere.

14

applies when the speaker wants to go onto someone else's

15

private property.

This ordinance is much more narrow.

QUESTION:

16

Not necessarily.

It only

I mean, you're

17

envisioning little cottages with a pathway up to the door.

18

Don't you have anybody who's in an apartment building,

19

where the Jehovah's Witness knocks on the door?

20

on that person's private property.

21

door.

22

MR. GORMLEY:

23

QUESTION:

He's not

He just knocks on the

But Your Honor, the ordinance --

Or maybe another house, that they

24

don't have a setback restriction, the door is right, you

25

know, right on the public sidewalks, knocks on the door.

42
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. GORMLEY:

But the point is, Your Honor, the

2

ordinance is designed to protect the concerns that village

3

residents have, no matter how much space is between them

4

and a sidewalk.

5

QUESTION:

That's a different point, but I mean,

6

I don't think you can say that the difference is that this

7

involves only speech that occurs on private property, not

8

necessarily.

9

Not necessarily.

MR. GORMLEY:

Nonetheless, Your Honor, the point

10

would be that when someone knocks on a door, no matter how

11

far away they are from a sidewalk or a street, there is

12

concern on the part of the resident that this often a

13

stranger, certainly an uninvited person, is here on my

14

property, perhaps just a few inches away from a public

15

way, but nonetheless coming to my home, perhaps asking to

16

actually enter my home, and I think the village is

17

entitled to say, we're concerned about that kind of

18

activity.
QUESTION:

19

Oh, you're concerned about people who

20

were even not concerned about it.

I mean, that's the

21

problem.

22

sign that says, no solicitors, but the village is saying

23

even those people who welcome Jehovah Witnesses, they're

24

sitting their lonely, they would love to talk to somebody

25

about anything --

Those people that are concerned can put up a

(Laughter.)

2

QUESTION:

-- and these people still have to go

3

register with the mayor to get the privilege of ringing

4

their doorbell.

5

MR. GORMLEY:

But Your Honor, that's no

6

different than the Frisby case decided by this Court 14

7

years ago.

concerned about picketing outside a home.

9

the Court upheld an ordinance there that was content-

It may well be that some people are not
Nonetheless,

10

neutral and so described by the Court, and said a village,

11

a city was entitled to enforce it.
QUESTION:

12

The same is true --

Well, we have always said that

13

picketing is an activity which is focused, it's constant,

14

it repeats a message over a long period of time, and

15

that's simply different from a single encounter, which is

16

what you prevent.
MR. GORMLEY:

17

Nonetheless, I think in both

18

situations, Your Honor, the Government is rightly

19

concerned about an activity that causes some public

20

problem.

21

continuous nature, in the other, natural fear on the part

22

of people when some uninvited person shows up on their

23

property, and --

In the one case, certainly annoyance of a

QUESTION:

But that is met, as has already been

pointed out, by the opportunity to put up a no-

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

trespassing, no solicitor sign.

2

MR. GORMLEY:

3

QUESTION:

4
5

It addresses --

Why does the ordinance have to do

more?
MR. GORMLEY:

Sure, well, certainly no

6

trespassing signs address some of the problem, but those

7

often provide after-the-fact remedies, if someone actually

8

invades the space you can prosecute, but by then you may

9

well not be able to find the person any more, and even

10

with the no-solicitation registration form that the

11

petitioners have not challenged, that does not protect the

12

person who, for whatever reason, chooses not to put up

13

such a sign.

14

Perhaps people want to be visited by solicitors

15

once they've registered and, in fact, it may well

16

encourage some people who would otherwise put up a no-

17

solicitation sign on their property to take that down,

18

because they now have confidence in this village that

19

these people are registered, there'll be some way to track

20

them down if something goes wrong.

21
22
23

QUESTION:

Well, what standard of review should

we apply, do you suppose, in looking at this ordinance?
MR. GORMLEY:

Well, I think that both of the

24

courts below applied the proper approach.

25

neutral, time, place and manner regulation.

It's a contentThe mayor has

45
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

no discretion in terms of issuing the permits.

2
3

QUESTION:

Well, that would be intermediate

scrutiny?

4

MR. GORMLEY:

5

called it, Your Honor.

6

QUESTION:

That's what the court of appeals

And under that standard, aren't

7

you -- the Government required to show that it restricts

8

no more speech than is reasonably necessary to accomplish

9

its interests?

10

MR. GORMLEY:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. GORMLEY:

That's correct.

I take it that's the standard?
Yes, Your Honor, and I think

13

that's true here, because every time that someone

14

approaches the private property, comes onto the private

15

property of a village resident, those residents are

16

rightly concerned about who this uninvited person is, and

17

what are they going -QUESTION:

18

Why couldn't you serve all those

19

purposes if you just print up some signs that people can

to come down to the mayor?

3

What is the purpose to require them just

MR. GORMLEY:

Because it gives some record on

5

residents a little greater sense of security that if

not going to be left without any --

QUESTION:

Could the city say, to facilitate the

for anything, but the homeowner -- make the homeowner the

17

one to come to sign up in city hall to say, I don't mind

having solicitors.?

19

MR. GORMLEY:

Certainly that's the part of the

20

ordinance that the petitioners have not challenged here.

Homeowners can both post the no --

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. POLIDORO

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10
11

Thank you, Mr. Gormley.

MR. POLIDORO:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

If

I make a few points, please.
Justice O'Connor asked a question as to whether

12
13

this would apply to trick-or-treaters.

I open to the

14

joint appendix, page 199, which is one of the no-

15

solicitation registration forms, Your Honor.

16

trick-or-treaters are -- and specifically, point 13,

17

trick-or-treaters during Halloween are mentioned, so

18

they're encompassed under the ordinance.

Indeed,

Too, I heard a point being made about the

19
20

ordinance being a way to help track down the bad guys.

21

There's no independent verification mechanism in this

22

ordinance at all.

23

I'm Abraham Cantor and get a permit and go from door to

24

door.

25

Ms. MacMurray, page 478a, both recognized the ordinance

I can go to the village hall and say

has no verification mechanism to tie in to the person

2

who's asking for the permit.

3

With respect to discretion, Mayor Abdullah

4

testified that -- and this is in the transcript, pages 124

5

and 126, that if someone came, gave their name, address,

6

cause, and said they were unaffiliated with an

7

organization, he would likely not issue a permit to them.

8

We believe that this is manifestly exercise of discretion.

9

And lastly, Your Honors, I've heard our door-

10

to-door activity be referred to as an annoyance to be

11

compared to obnoxious picketing at the home.

12

respectfully suggest that our activity indeed lies at the

13

heart of the First Amendment.

QUESTION:

I wanted to ask you, if you're

through --

16

MR. POLIDORO:

17

QUESTION:

Yes.

-- I don't want to take your rebuttal

18

time -- as I looked at page 199 and I thought that was a

19

list of exceptions to the ordinance.

20

MR. POLIDORO:

21

QUESTION:

It is, and what --

So that in other words the trick-or-

22

treaters are expressly excepted, just like Christmas

23

carollers and the others listed.

24

MR. POLIDORO:

25

Well, what had happened there,

Justice Stevens, they would be accepted if the box was

form, no one was allowed at the door.

That's the homeowner's form.
