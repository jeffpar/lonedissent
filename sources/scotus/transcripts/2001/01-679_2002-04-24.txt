ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. ROBERTS, JR.

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. ROBERTS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

11

In 1974, when it enacted the Family Educational

12

Rights and Privacy Act, Congress conditioned Federal

13

funding for educational institutions on the institution

14

not having a policy or practice of releasing student

15

records without consent.

16

condition in terms of individual rights.

17

example, follow the model of title IX, enacted 2 years

18

earlier and also dealing with educational institutions,

19

and say something like, no student at a school receiving

20

Federal funds shall have his records released without his

21

consent.

22

said that no funds shall be made available to any

23

institution having a policy or practice of releasing

24

student records without consent.

25

Congress did not phrase this
It did not, for

Instead, Congress proceeded more indirectly.

The statute is directed to the Secretary of

It

Education.

2

available, not to the institution receiving the funds, and

3

certainly not to the individual student.

4

cases establish that that is a distinction that makes a

5

difference.

6

would be far less reason --

7

He's the one who makes Federal funds

This Court's

In Cannon, for example, the Court said there

QUESTION:

Mr. Roberts, isn't it primarily a

8

distinction that makes a difference in connection with

9

whether there's an implied cause of action, rather than

10
11

whether 1983 authorized a cause of action?
MR. ROBERTS:

In the implied right of action

12

question there are two questions, did Congress intend to

13

create a right, and did Congress intend to provide a

14

judicial remedy?

15

questions, did Congress intend to create a right, and did

16

Congress intend to preclude resort to the 1983 remedy, so

17

that first question I think is the same under both

18

categories of cases, and as the Court said in Cannon, if

19

Congress phrases the statute as -- quote, as a prohibition

20

on the disbursement of public funds, there's far less

21

reason to think that they intended a private remedy.

22

In addition, purpose speaks in terms of an

In the 1983 context, there are two

23

institutional policy or practice, not individual instances

24

of disclosures.

25

creating provision like title IX is stark.

Again, the contrast with a rightsTitle IX says,

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

no student shall be subject to discrimination, but FERPA

2

doesn't look at what happens to individual students.

3

looks at institutional behavior, institutional policy or

4

practice.

5

QUESTION:

It

The statute does talk about rights of

6

students and rights of parents.

7

say, preceded by the mandate that there shall be no

8

policy, but in this regard it seems to me to be at least

9

more specific than -- with references to rights than some

10
11

It's, of course, as you

of the other funding statutes we've looked at.
MR. ROBERTS:

Well, of course, the word rights

12

does not appear in the disclosure provision, subsection

13

(b), and in Pennhurst, where the Court was dealing with

14

developmentally disabled bill of rights, the Court

15

explained that just because the statute uses the word

16

rights doesn't mean that it creates a 1983 right.

17

QUESTION:

Yes, I recognize in the one section

18

that we're talking about here you have a stronger argument

19

than the other, but if we assume for the moment would have

20

a 1983 cause of action under the whole act without going

21

down provision by provision, then I do think you have to

22

recognize that the act does talk about rights of students,

23

rights of parents to look at files, et cetera.

24
25

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, first of all, the Court in

Blessing said that you don't look at the whole act.
5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

You

1

have to look at the particular provision that is relied

2

upon to create the 1983 right.

3

Second of all, we're 6 years before Maine v.

4

Thiboutot when Congress passed this, so it's not as if

5

they're using rights as some term of art under the

6

established jurisprudence, and finally, I think Congress

7

can use the term to refer to the opportunity of parents

8

and students to participate in the administrative remedy,

9

to the criteria that the Secretary of Education is to use

10

in deciding whether to terminate funds, without thereby

11

necessarily triggering coverage under section 1982.

12

QUESTION:

Well, I think it's that latter

13

rationale that might be stronger for your case.

14

somewhat reluctant to parse through this statute and say

15

there's no right under (b), there is a right under (e), et

16

cetera.

17

MR. ROBERTS:

I'll be

Well, whatever rights, whether

18

you're talking -- putting aside the question whether it's

19

a 1983 right or a right to participate in the process

20

that's established under the statute, it is part of the

21

policy or practice that the Secretary of Education is to

22

look to in deciding whether to disburse funds.

23

obligation is to the Secretary, not to the institution,

24

and that is made clear when you look at what Congress said

25

about enforcement.

The

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

The Congress said, the Secretary shall enforce

2

FERPA, and the Secretary shall deal with violations.

Now,

3

that deal-with-violations language should strike the Court

4

as unusual and, in fact, nowhere else in the United States

5

Code does Congress tell an agency to deal with violations.

6

It has almost a colloquial tone to it.

7

FERPA is your problem, you deal with the violations.

8

There's no suggestion that they would be dealt with by

9

private actions brought in court and, in fact, that

Mr. Secretary,

10

conclusion is reinforced when you look at subsection (g),

11

which tells the Secretary, you set up an office to deal --

Your Honor.

QUESTION:

up an office to investigate, process, review, and

adjudicate complaints about violations under FERPA.

MR. ROBERTS:

2

not only do they do it to me, but this is their policy,

right?

MR. ROBERTS:

It's evidence that there might be

a problem with the school's policy, and this is what makes

it different, for example, from the Wright case.

In

you can do is terminate

There's no process to bring complaints to the
That's not enough.

10

Here, Congress said to the Secretary, you set up

11

a complaint procedure, and if someone's got a problem with

12

the release of their records you investigate it, you

13

process the complaint, you review it, and you adjudicate

14

it, and what has happened is that complaints have come in,

15

and the Family Policy Compliance Office have gotten

16

responses from the university, and voluntary compliance

17

has ensured that the policy and practice of the

18

institution complies with the Secretary's view.

19

QUESTION:

I guess that that's all that the

20

plaintiff could accomplish in court anyway.

21

plaintiffs here don't contend that they would be entitled

22

to recovery if there is no policy or practice.

MR. ROBERTS:

QUESTION:

That's correct.

MR. ROBERTS:

establish that they were not concerned with individual

instances of disclosure.

Well, Mr. Roberts, why are they

mind the distinction between how matters are handled

informal and inexpensive adjudication.

people can quickly find out what the school's answer is

and, in a case in which it suggests that there's a policy

or practice problem, secure voluntary problem.

13

QUESTION:

Do we know from the -- maybe the

14

Solicitor General can tell us -- if the seven people are

15

overworked?

16

MR. ROBERTS:

In fact, in practice most of what

17

they do is field questions from the school, how do we

18

handle this situation, what do we do about this?

19

QUESTION:

But how do you get a stop order?

One

20

of the points that were made is that if records are about

21

to be divulged to, say, a newspaper, and the student or

22

the parent wants an immediate stop order, you can go into

23

court and get a TRO.

24

Secretary's arsenal that has that kind of muscle behind

25

it, is there?

There's nothing comparable in the

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. ROBERTS:

There certainly is.

The first

2

thing, if you're a student subjected to that, what you

3

would do is call the Family Policy Compliance Office and

4

the Secretary, keep in mind, has the cudgel of terminating

5

funding behind the most informal telephone call or

6

correspondence.

7

Education tells them to do with respect to FERPA, because

8

they appreciate the sanctions that can be brought.

enacted.

This office can't really give relief

12

to any individual, however, right, except to tell the

13

school not to release, wrongfully release records in the

14

future, right?

15

MR. ROBERTS:

The focus of the office is in

16

vindicating what the statute provides.

The statute is

17

directed to institutional behavior.

complaints in order to secure compliance with the proper

policy or practice.

10

it says, of the right to inspect.

inspect right in the first sentence, and then later on it

they underline it by saying, and you have to tell them

22

MR. ROBERTS:

The direct response is that -- you

left out words in the quote, which is that no funds shall

protecting individual rights in, as the Court said in

It's not written the way title IX is,

Secondly, you're quoting from subsection (a).
Subsection (b) does not talk about rights.

10

And finally, the answer --

11

QUESTION:

Well, but Mr. Roberts, let me just be

12

sure I understand your answer.

13

Justice Breyer does, because in 1232g(1)(B) on page 2a,

14

no funds and so forth shall be made available if the

15

agency has a policy of denying or effectively prevents the

16

parents of students the right to inspect.

right to inspect a Federal right?

MR. ROBERTS:

Now, is the

I think not, because --

What is its source?
The right to inspect is not an

21

independent and freestanding right.

It is a description

22

of the sort of policy or practice that should prompt the

24

this is not the provision that's at issue in this case.

1

QUESTION:

Well, I understand, but your initial

2

submission is that this is not a rights-creating statute,

3

it just -- but I don't know where the right comes from

4

that they refer to in that section and also in -- on 12a

5

informing parents and students of rights under this

6

section.

7

MR. ROBERTS:

Under this section.

I think

8

Congress can use the term, rights, to refer to the

9

opportunities that are provided to the parents and

10

students and to the criteria that the Secretary of

11

Education will look to in deciding funding, without

12

thereby triggering coverage under section 1983.

13
14
15

Just like in Pennhurst, Congress used the word
rights repeatedly in -QUESTION:

But do you think that they would have

16

had the rights described herein even if this statute had

17

not been passed?

18

MR. ROBERTS:

No.

There would not have been --

19

no rights are conferred under this statute.

What is

20

conferred is discretion on the Secretary of Education to

21

withhold funds depending upon a policy or practice.

22

describing the policy or practice that should trigger

23

action by the Secretary of Education, the statute refers

24

to opportunities that must be provided to parents and

25

students by that institution, but in doing so I don't

You use the word opportunity in the

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, the statute doesn't use the

words right under subsection (b).

Pennhurst was called the Bill of Rights, and this Court

8

concluded that that did not confer rights.

is whether Congress acted in a way that indicated an

please the Court:
If I could begin by responding to Justice

Kennedy's question about whether the Family Policy

14

they handle an amazing amount of work, and have been doing

so for 28 years under this statute.

MS. MILLETT:

6

isn't -- I mean, if you look at the legal landscape out

7

there, too, there hasn't been an enormous volume of 1983

8

actions, and that is because the Secretary has been very

9

successful, I think, in communicating and enforcing this

10

in an informal manner with the universities.

11

universities wish to comply with this, and a lot of it

is -- we've had 28 years now to explicate what this

What is your opinion about the idea

that this could be bifurcated, that it orders a right to

to say there's a private right under (a) but not under

Does that make sense in terms of the statute

What's your opinion of that?

23

MS. MILLETT:

Okay, I'll answer that in two

24

stages.

It makes sense to bifurcate analysis as a matter

25

of this Court's 1983 precedents, and specifically that's
17
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

exactly what the Court did in the Blessing case, which is

2

your most recent case up here.

3

As a whole, we don't think it actually makes

4

sense to do so under this statute.

The Court may not

5

decide that today because the only provision at issue is

6

subsection (b), which does not refer to rights and focuses

7

on policies or practices, but our position is that there

8

are three mutually reinforcing features here, both in (a)

9

and (b), that show there is not a right under 1983, and

10

that is -- even under (a), the very beginning of the

11

sentence, and the operative command is that no funds shall

12

be distributed, or shall be distributed by the Secretary

13

of Education, and that is distinctive, unique language

14

that this Court recognized, suggested in Cannon, and held

15

just last term in Sandoval.

16

Congress would use to create individual rights and in

17

particular, in 1974, 2 years after title IX was enacted,

18

Congress chose different, distinctly different language

19

that is very uncommon in the U.S. Code.

20

QUESTION:

It's not the type of language

factors listed in Blessing, Congress intended to benefit

1

those are met here, and that you then have to go to the

2

next part of the test which is -- that creates a

3

presumption that there is a right.

4

MS. MILLETT:

Well, as we said in our brief, we

5

think that the problem here is not that it's vague or

6

amorphous, and it's not that there's not binding

7

obligations, which is the second two prongs of the

8

Blessing test, but the first prong of the Blessing test,

9

while phrased in terms of benefiting individuals, the

10

Court made clear in Blessing it's not just a general

11

inquiry if it's of some good to people, because all

12

legislation is of some good to somebody.

13

creates individual entitlements, and that's where we think

14

this statute fails, a statute that --

15

QUESTION:

It is whether it

Well, with reference to the other

16

parts, the non-(b) parts of the statute, it does seem to

17

me that it talks about the student and the parent in very

18

specific terms, and it uses the term, rights.

19

MS. MILLETT:

Well, again, this Court made clear

20

in Pennhurst that you can't just look at the word right in

21

isolation.

Court, to my brief, at 1a, where subsection (a) is, and

there has to be a policy of denying or effectively

6

preventing the parents of students, plural, access to

7

these records, so we think that makes clear that you have

8

the same programmatic, system-wide rule here, and in fact

9

the Secretary's position is that if you had one instance

10

of a failure to allow someone access to records during

11

nonpolicy or nonprogram-wide failure to allow access to

12

records, that would not violate FERPA.

it's the first sentence of 1232g on

that right?

I think it's not -- I have two

First of all, whatever it is, it's a collective,

program-wide, aggregated right, because it speaks in the

11

plural, but secondly it;'s not -- I think it is used as

12

Mr. Roberts said here in a shorthand way, and the

13

legislative history says that one of the things they were

14

trying to enforce here is what Congress considered to be

15

pre-existing moral or legal --

QUESTION:

Let me be sure you have my question

in mind.

different source?

Do you think the right to which the statute

I think what the statute is

21

creating there is a Federal overlay to protect pre -- as

22

was said in the legislative history on page 17 of our

23

brief, preexisting legal or moral right.

25

QUESTION:

So that if a school came back and

said, in our State there's no such right, then the statute
21
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

would not apply?

2

MS. MILLETT:

Congress felt that when it said

3

preexisting moral or legal rights, there was a sense of

4

Congress that this is a type of, not in a bright sense

5

that we use for purposes of 1983 actions, but the

6

legislative history was that Congress had a sense here

7

that this was something all individuals should have.

8

this --

9

QUESTION:

But

It is something they should have by

10

reason of this statute, and therefore it's created, or by

11

some preexisting rule of law in some -- at some other

12

source?

13

MS. MILLETT:

Well, Congress' language was

14

preexisting moral or legal rights, and so I'm not sure

15

what one considers --

16

QUESTION:

If it's another source, it seems to

17

me that the State or the institution could say, in this

18

locality there is no such right, and that would make the

19

statute totally inapplicable.

20

MS. MILLETT:

No, it wouldn't, because what you

21

still have is, once you take these funds you have a

22

Federal overlay.

23

prior law doesn't matter, which you have --

you say it's a right that can be enforced through a

13

comprehensive administrative scheme?

14

MS. MILLETT:

In two ways it wouldn't.

It's not

15

at issue in this case, and the second argument is that the

16

nature of the

17

that's created here, Congress has created the very type of

18

scheme that it thinks is appropriate to enforce these

19

collective, aggregated, system-wide rights that it created

here, that in fact --

21

-- whatever the nature of the right is

QUESTION:

Well, are you in effect saying, as

Mr. Roberts did, I think when he used the word,

Is that -- you are saying essentially the

MS. MILLETT:

QUESTION:

Yes.

So when you say there's a Federal

can be taken.

MS. MILLETT:

That's right.

If the

There's a Federal

obligation, once you take these funds, to not have system-

this case, disclose without consent, or an authorized

basis for disclosure, and I think it's very -- again, very

unique language.

the two separately, but when you combined the no-funds

practices, that this Court made clear in Blessing that

type of aggregate language doesn't create individual

QUESTION:

2

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BETH S. BRINKMANN

3

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

4
5

Ms. Brinkmann, we'll hear from you.

MS. BRINKMANN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

6

In FERPA, Congress gave parents the right to

7

prevent the release of certain educational records.

8

That's evident from Congress' choice of words and the

9

structure and history of the statute.

There are at least

10

five indications of that intent, including references to

11

rights under that provision, which I'll get to in a

12

moment.

It involves reading two sections together.

13

First, in section -- this is on page 9a of the

14

red brief, at the very top.

15

of page 9a, Congress prohibited a recipient from having a

16

policy of releasing education records, quote, unless there

17

is written consent from the students' parents.

18

did not say, unless there is a policy of obtaining written

19

consent.

Brinkmann?

Now, you're reading from 9a, Ms.

MS. BRINKMANN:

paragraph 2 begins that no fund shall be given to an

agency, and explains that has a policy or --

MS. BRINKMANN:

It's on page 8a of the --

You're switching briefs on us.
I'm sorry.

It's on page 8a of the blue

brief, if you prefer that.

The problem is, there are

10

other provisions in here I need to refer to.

11

top of the page, it explains that no funds shall go to a

12

school that has a policy of releasing information, and at

13

the end of that first paragraph, quote, unless, and then

14

we go to subparagraph (A), there is written consent from

15

the students' parents.

16
17
18

At the very

Congress did not say, unless the school has a
policy of obtaining consent.
QUESTION:

go to an educational agency or institution which has a

20

policy or practice.

Alderson Reporting Company

MS. BRINKMANN:

If you don't have a policy or

2

practice of releasing information other than under the

3

preceding (b)(1), you're correct, Your Honor.

4
5

QUESTION:

The whole thing wouldn't apply, so I

don't --

6

MS. BRINKMANN:

And (b)(2)(A) is -- (b)(1) says

7

you can't -- a school can't have a policy of releasing

8

without consent, other than to certain categories.

9

QUESTION:

It's a question of whether you read

10

the word policy, what policy?

11

reading it as, what policy?

12

MS. BRINKMANN:

13

QUESTION:

14

I think Justice Scalia is

It's a policy --

A policy of releasing records without

written consent.

MS. BRINKMANN:

17

the without consent is in (b)(1).

QUESTION:

What

I take it that the

Yes.

Unless.
Yes.

Okay.

10

MS. BRINKMANN:

11

QUESTION:

So --

But that whole provision, no funds

12

shall be made available, only applies to an educational

13

agency or institution which has a policy or practice of

14

releasing.

15

MS. BRINKMANN:

16

QUESTION:

Absolutely.

If it doesn't have a policy or

17

practice of releasing, it's entirely exempt from that

18

provision.

19

MS. BRINKMANN:

That's correct, Your Honor,

20

because they did not -- Congress did not intend to go

21

after inadvertent releases.

22

For example, the school makes a decision if they

23

are going to have a policy of releasing information to a

24

scholarship program, or to the press, and if they have a

25

policy release, they have to abide by this very specific
28
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

requirement in (b)(2)(A).

2

QUESTION:

Well --

3

MS. BRINKMANN:

They may choose not to.

It's

4

parallel to the directory information provision in the

5

statute.

6

Congress also said, you, school, can make a

7

choice.

If you want to release things like names,

8

classes, awards receipts under the directory information

9

provision, you can make that decision.

You have to give

10

notice at the beginning of the year, and you have to give

11

parents enough time to respond whether or not they want to

12

opt out of that.

13

Same thing under (b)(2)(A).

If you as a

14

university decide that you want to have a policy or

15

practice of releasing things beyond what is already

16

authorized under (b)(1), which includes other teachers,

17

emergency situations, Federal officials, all kinds of

18

situations, then you have to abide by (b)(2)(A), and you

19

cannot have that policy or practice unless there is

20

written consent from the students' parents.

21

QUESTION:

But it appears to be a scheme, at

22

least as I read it, just directed at when Federal funds

23

are going to be given to a school, and you determine that

24

by whether the school has a particular policy or practice,

25

and the remedy is withholding funds. I don't see how you
29
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

extrapolate from this statute the intent to create a

2

private cause of action for damages.

3

MS. BRINKMANN:

Your Honor, in addition to the

4

language, unless there is, our position is, because there

5

is that requirement, unless there is written consent from

6

the parent, Congress intended to directly benefit the

7

parents and to say to the parents in a particular

8

situation, you can say no, I don't want this information

9

released.

10
11

Parents may have different decisions based on

whether or not they think it will benefit the child.
QUESTION:

But they can't do that, because I

12

mean, if the information is released and the parent says,

13

I object, the institution can say, oh, I'm sorry, that was

14

just a mistake.

15

released it.

16

there is no absolute right on the part of the parent to

17

prevent it.

18

We don't have that policy.

Too bad.

MS. BRINKMANN:

You know, we

We don't have the policy.

So

There is, Your Honor, because

19

the -- if they do have a policy and practice, it's akin to

20

the standard that the Court adopted in Gebser, and here

21

Congress did that.

22

every institution with inadvertent release, but to the

23

extent, as under Monell, if there is requisite knowledge

24

by the school that they have a policy or practice, they're

25

intending to be releasing information, they are charged

They said, we are not going to charge

with getting the consent from the parents, and again I

2

have to --

3

QUESTION:

The consequence, if they don't get

4

consent from the parents, the express consequence is no

5

funds shall be made available.

6

MS. BRINKMANN:

Which is the commonality in all

7

of the Spending Clause cases that have come before the

8

Court, Your Honor.

9

QUESTION:

Ms. Brinkmann, but not the emphasis,

10

as was pointed out by Mr. Roberts.

11

say, no person shall be, and this starts out with no

12

funds.

13

that uses the no funds shall, instead of no person shall

14

be denied, where this Court has either implied a private

15

right of action, or has found a right which 1983 can then

16

be used to enforce?

17

Title IX, title VI

Do you have any statutes, any spending statutes

MS. BRINKMANN:

Well, Your Honor, there's never

18

been a formula.

19

found a right has included that language, Wright, Wilde,

20

or Blessing, none of them have the language the petitioner

21

and the Solicitor General now urges.

22

None of the statutes where the Court has

In fact, in footnote 12 of the Suter opinion the

23

Court contrasted the language where they were not finding

24

a right to a statute that, quote, said, no Federal payment

25

may be made under this part, and they said, now, there's a
31
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

specific requirement, so there's no formula.

2

courts have had this language that they're now urging.

3

The Suter opinion refers to this type of language as being

4

more specific, and it doesn't as a practical matter make

5

any difference what these Spending Clause statutes do say.

6

If you receive Federal funds, you have to abide by these

7

conditions.

8

QUESTION:

9

question precisely.

None of the

I'm not sure that I gave you my
There are title VI, title IX,

10

statutes that use the formula, no person shall, and under

11

those statutes a right of action has been implied, and

12

what I'm asking is, is there any statute with the

13

language, no funds shall, where a right of action has been

14

implied?

15

MS. BRINKMANN:

No statute of that language has

16

ever come before the Court, Your Honor, and all I'm saying

17

is, there are many other cases in which statutes have been

18

found to accord rights under section 1983 that don't have

19

that no-student-shall language.

20

QUESTION:

What about -- you say, you agree

21

there is no example of a case we've decided where the term

22

is no funds shall?

23

MS. BRINKMANN:

That statute has not come before

24

the Court.

I have to say in the title IX and title VI

25

context, it was a broader inquiry of whether or not there
32
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

was implied cause of action, but in Your Honor's opinion,

2

in Suter, in footnote 12, it does refer to this type of

3

statute and suggests that that is a direct requirement.

4

QUESTION:

If I may --

5

QUESTION:

Well, where is the statute -- the

6

footnote you're quoting speaks in terms of, or addresses

7

the no funds shall?

8
9

MS. BRINKMANN:

The precise language in that

statute which is quoted in that footnote says that no

10

Federal funds payments shall be made, Your Honor.

11

page 361 of the opinion, and it's citing 42 U.S.C. 672(e)

12

that says, quote, for example, no Federal payment may be

13

made under this part, and then it goes on and it says that

14

that is an example of more precise requirements as

15

contrasted to the statute in Suter.

16

It's on

If I may, there are four other provisions I'd

17

like to speak to in addition to the language, unless there

18

QUESTION:

Two more. You have two more coming.

You said you had four.
MS. BRINKMANN:

Yes.

Yes.

Actually, I'm going

15

to jump in, though, because this responds to questions of

16

the Court about the use of the word, right.

17

turn to page 12a in the red brief, subsection (d),

18

1232g(d), is entitled, "Students Rather than Parents'

19

Permission or Consent."

20

permission or consent under (b)(2)(A).

21

permission or consent is referenced in FERPA, and it

22

explains there the purpose of it, to explain that when a

23

student becomes 18, as the student here was, or attending

24

a school of higher education, the permission or consent

required, and the rights accorded to the parents of the

(b) as well as with reference to (a).

MS. BRINKMANN:

Much more precisely, Your Honor,

10

here, because they are specifically talking not just about

11

(b) generically, but about permission or consent.

12
13

QUESTION:

Why does right refer to (b)?

I mean,

rights could refer to (a).

14

MS. BRINKMANN:

Because the whole provision of

QUESTION:

The right to inspect after he's 18 is

a right that goes to the student, not to the parent.

6

MS. BRINKMANN:

But Your Honor, this is

specifically addressing the permission or consent

provision.

9

You can tell by the heading of subsection (d).
Moreover, under (e), as Your Honor pointed out

10

before, the school is obligated to inform parents or

11

students of their rights under the regulations promulgated

12

by the Secretary of Education.

required to inform parents and students about is the

Even if we say that you met the three

Robert and Ms. Millett made, and that is that Congress

2

created an enforcement scheme that they meant to be it,

3

that would be incompatible with individual enforcement.

4

MS. BRINKMANN:

Actually that, ironically, leads

5

me to my third point, in fact.

When you look at this

6

history, Congress clearly was addressing the interest of

7

parents in controlling dissemination of information about

8

their children.

9

were worrying about, information that's gossip,

This is a paradigm example of what they

unsubstantiated, never had a chance to respond to it,

11

could have a devastating effect on a student's career.

eliminate that worry by having the Secretary police the

thing, or by having lawsuits to vindicate private rights.

It may not be the ideal remedy.

It

may not be the best remedy, and one of the anomalies here

8

that wouldn't be present in title IX is working through

1983, where you must have a State action pegged.

Now,

10

here, it happened that there was a connection with a

11

State, with a State officer.

12

private institutions and State officer, but suppose we

13

have two schools, and one is about to give a record to a

14

newspaper, and the other is about to do the same thing,

15

and one is the State university, and one is the private

16

university.

17

The conversation was between

Under your scheme, the private university would

18

be home free, it wouldn't be subject to 1983 liability,

19

but the public would, and I think that would be a strange

20

scheme for Congress to enact.

21

MS. BRINKMANN:

Your Honor, actually it's much

22

more complicated than that.

It's just not whether or not

23

suits are available against public or private, because, of

24

course, State universities are often deemed arms of the

25

State, so they're not subject to suit at all.

really doesn't fit this pattern, because why -- even, why

should certain kinds of institutions be stopped, and

MS. BRINKMANN:

Because the relationship of

13

students at the private school is different than a

relationship with a public school.

Actually, the amicus brief of the ACLU cites a letter from

3

the Department of Education explaining that the vast

majority of private schools, elementary and secondary, do

not receive Federal funding, but if I may, I think that

the important point here is, the relationship of a student

with a private school is different.

MS. BRINKMANN:

of proof, and Your Honor, what -- I just have to emphasize

that what the provision here goes to with the policy and

practice in (b)(2)(A) is Monell, Gebser, it is Congress

5

saying, we're not going to charge every university with

this requirement.

this decision is made at a high enough level that they

which this section 1983 liability would be triggered.

QUESTION:

11

question on the practicality?

12

is ambiguous, et cetera, and I would like you to remove

13

this image from my mind, the image that I have in my mind

14

was an earlier case argued here in this Court, and as a

15

result of the lawyer's argument in that case I focused on

16

the language, educational record, and I realized it's a

17

close question, perhaps, as to whether those words do

18

include things like a gold star the third grade teacher

19

might give out in class, or the statement, you're going to

20

get a bad mark on your report card.

21

Is there -- can I ask you one
Assuming all the language

I suddenly realized it's highly ambiguous, and

22

the lawyer said that he had been cross-examining the

23

school officials on this and related questions in the

24

courtroom for several hours, I thought.

25

for a time, and suddenly it occurred to me, how are they

I mean, at least

42
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

teaching or running the school district, and the image

2

that came up in my courtroom was of private actions all

3

over the place trying to bring into court school officials

4

to interpret language which really doesn't explain itself.

5

Therefore, a need for centralized

6

administration, which of course would be harmful to some

7

parents, but counterbalanced by the need for effective

8

school administration, and those were the things in my

9

mind, and that's the image it called up, and I want you to

10

reply to that, because I think that's at the heart of

11

this, at least the practical part.

12

QUESTION:

I think I have at least five answers.

13

I haven't counted them off.

14

important to realize that that's one of the reasons you

15

have the particularized examination in Blessing.

16

not saying there's a right under every one of these

17

provisions, but if you look at (b)(2)(A), unless there is

18

the specific requirement, the history of it, and also if

19

you compare it to the other release provisions that do not

20

have this kind of right, they say you have to notify the

21

parent, or you have to make the person who's getting it

22

promise to destroy it when they're done with it.

23

don't have this right.

statute.

3

you ask the parents -- tell the parents why and to whom it

4

is going.

5

Schools comply with this

It is clear and simple.

You give them a copy,

In the 28 years since this statute has been

6

enacted, there has been no flood of litigation, despite

7

the fact that the Second Circuit, I think 15 years ago,

8

held that there was a section 1983 cause of action, the

9

Fifth Circuit more than 10 years ago.

There is no Federal

10

court of appeals that has taken petitioner's position.

11

think in the past 5 or 6 years there have been at least

12

two more circuits.

13

QUESTION:

I

People comply.
But Ms. Brinkmann, if your -- if the

14

force -- if we accept the force of your argument, then I

15

think we'd have to say, well, Congress really didn't need

16

to bother with the centralized administration provision,

17

and yet Congress did put it in, and it seems to me the

18

most likely reason that it put it in is the reason that

19

Justice Breyer just gave.

20

MS. BRINKMANN:

21

QUESTION:

I think --

So you may have made a good argument

22

for getting rid of it, but as long as it's there, it seems

23

to have the same lesson that his question suggests.

24
25

MS. BRINKMANN:

I think that the FPCO office

serves a admirably meritorious role.

It answers countless

44
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

numbers of phone calls and inquiries about this, but its

2

own interpretation of its role I think is really

3

illustrated by footnote 6 in our brief, which is on page

4

35.

5

In 1987, when FPCO changed regulations, it

6

explained that it wasn't going to require schools even to

7

afford them access to education records information

8

because they don't go out and investigate.

9

What more accurately reflects their

10

investigation is allowing schools to submit reports -- and

11

this is quotes -- since its inception, FPCO has not

12

conducted any on-site visits to resolve complaints.

13

Rather, it has resolved complaints through correspondence

14

and telephone calls with the affected parties, and that

15

works in the vast majority of cases.

16

In the limited number of cases that are brought

17

under FERPA in the Federal courts, Federal and State

18

courts since its enactment, this is the only reported case

19

that anyone has located for punitive damages, and the only

20

other case that had any damages was $1 of nominal damages

21

that we've been able to --

22

QUESTION:

But that may be a very good argument

23

for saying that what Congress had in mind, in effect, in

24

confining the enforcement the way it seems to have done by

25

this exclusive authority provision works in the general
45
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

run of cases, and therefore there is not a good reason to

2

say that Congress probably would have wanted this private

3

right of action with the punitive damages.

4

MS. BRINKMANN:

I think it works generally, and

5

then you look at the Blessing inquiry to see if Congress

6

intended to create a right, they intended to create a

7

right from all of those reasons I said.

8

there, it's clear, it's mandatory --

against that presumption the petitioner has to carry the

administration, spelled out in the statute, with the

overcome the presumption?

MS. BRINKMANN:

Because the presumption has to
46

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

be overcome by an enforcement scheme, an administrative

2

scheme that supplants the section 1983 that has some

3

address for a private remedy.

4

QUESTION:

Well, certainly it doesn't have to be

5

a duplicate of section 1983, or there would be no point in

6

saying it supplants it.

7

MS. BRINKMANN:

Absolutely, Your Honor, but here

8

there is absolutely no availability for any remedy for an

9

individual injury, and Sea Clammers --

QUESTION:

Well now, wait a minute.

As I

12

understand it, people who are aggrieved by some practice

13

in the schools can get a hold of the Secretary's office

and -- by a phone call and perhaps by the Secretary's

15

action in saying, either you fly right or we'll cut off

16

funds, they do have a remedy.

17

MS. BRINKMANN:

Not under (b)(2)(A), if they

18

have released records.

19

of damages compensation for an individual, and the Court

20

has looked at that role of the administrative scheme in

21

its line of cases, deciding whether or not it was

22

sufficient to supplant this congressionally created right

23

under section 1983.

14

That depends upon whom you can assert the right against,

simply the question of whether you can reach the

things should be kept private?

MS. BRINKMANN:

Well, I have to emphasize, our

22

statutory argument about rights is not based solely on the

23

1232g(d) referenced rights.

there is consent from the parents, and on this

particularized consent required, giving parents a copy,

2

under the Blessing standard it was intended to benefit

3

parents and to address their specific needs to protect

4

their children from information they have never been

5

informed about, as in this case, that destroyed this

6

person's career.

7

That's exactly what Congress was aiming at, and

8

without -- in petitioner's position there was absolutely

9

nothing that anyone can do to protect that right.

this Court's ruling will affect injunctive actions also,

but in this case, because this information was released at

affidavit to my client.

9

There was disagreement -- even as it stood,

10

without any information from my client to say this was

false, there was disagreement amongst the school officials

about whether or not to issue this, and plaintiff's

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. ROBERTS, JR.

19

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

20

MR. ROBERTS:

Thank you, Your Honor.

21

Two statutes enacted within 2 years of each

22

other:

title IX, no person shall be subject to

23

discrimination; FERPA, no funds shall be made available to

24

an institution that has a policy or practice described in

25

the statute, and the Secretary shall deal with violations,
51
Alderson Reporting Company

1

and the Secretary shall do that at one place, because

2

we're worried about multiple interpretations causing

3

confusion.

4

Now, that is two -- those are two very different

5

ways of approaching a problem.

Under this Court's

6

precedents the former, the title IX model confers

7

privately enforceable rights.

8

would Congress proceed differently in dealing with

9

educational institutions in those two different contexts?

The latter does not.

Why

10

Because of the appreciation that the regulation of student

11

records from kindergarten through graduate school directly

12

implicated pedagogical concerns.

13

It would have been a radical notion, even in

14

1974, for Congress to confer individual rights on every

15

student from kindergarten to graduate school in a way that

16

would directly implicate the day-to-day running of schools

17

across the country, and there's no evidence to suggest

18

that that's what Congress had in mind.

19

The evidence is the opposite.

It proceeded

20

gingerly.

It said, this is directed to the Secretary.

21

It's directed to policies and practice.

22

deal with violations?

23

violations, and do it in one place.

24

FERPA was enacted, in response to what was called by the

25

sponsors the perplexity and frustration it had caused --

QUESTION:

We could take care of all of that, right?

16

(Laughter.)

17

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, it is implausible to suppose

18

that the same Congress that was so worried about multiple

19

interpretations of the law from the regional offices of

20

one Department would have been perfectly content and, in

21

fact, intended to confer the right for every one of 62

22

million students to go into court in a 1983 action.
