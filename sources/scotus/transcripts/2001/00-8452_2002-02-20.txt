ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES W. ELLIS

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. ELLIS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
In 1989, this Court, surveying the already

11

growing evidence from a variety of sources that the people

12

of this country oppose the execution of individuals with

13

mental retardation, observed that that growing sentiment

14

might some day be manifested in legislation, particularly

15

by the States, which this Court identified as the sort of

16

evidence upon which it typically can rely in Eighth

17

Amendment cases.

18

The evidence is now clear that the American

19

people in every region of the country have reached a

20

consensus on that question.

21

through a course of legislative enactments that is

22

literally unprecedented in the field of capital

23

punishment --

24
25

QUESTION:

By every measurement and

What is your definition of a

consensus, Mr. Ellis?

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. ELLIS:

Mr. Chief Justice, the -- I would

2

define consensus -- and this Court had discussed it in

3

various terms in the cases, but I would distill from the

4

cases in which the Court has described it that it is when

5

the American people have reached a settled judgment based

6

on a --

7

QUESTION:

Yes, but I -- that's -- that's a

8

perfectly sound phrase, but how do we go about figuring

9

out when that occurs?

10

a particular side?

11

difference?

12

I mean, how many States must be on

Does the population make any

How about those factors?

MR. ELLIS:

Your Honor, there -- there has never

13

been a suggestion by this Court that it differentiates

14

among States with regard to size, and yet obviously

15

logically if -- if a -- an -- if a collection of statutes

16

only was found in the smallest of the States or the States

17

of a single particular region, it would cut against the

18

evidence that there was a consensus.

19
20
21

QUESTION:

And -- and how many States out of the

50 do you need, do you think, for -- for a consensus?
MR. ELLIS:

This Court has never suggested that

22

there's a particular number in response to that.

And when

23

you look at the cases, both that have found a consensus

24

and that have not, they vary.

25

QUESTION:

Well, but you're saying there is a

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

consensus.

So, you must have some figure that you're

2

submitting to us.

3

MR. ELLIS:

4

basis of a figure, Your Honor.

5

in their entirety, the Court's cases talking about

6

consensus seem closer to us to be a -- a totality of the

7

evidence test but with the requirement that that evidence

8

across the board have found expression unambiguously in

9

statutes.

10

QUESTION:

I'm -- I'm not submitting on the
I'm suggesting that read

Should we not look at legislative

11

enactments as the surest indicator of what the view of the

12

-- the particular State is?

13

MR. ELLIS:

Yes, Your Honor, I think that you

14

should, and I took that to be the -- the teaching of this

15

Court's opinion in the first Penry case.

16

QUESTION:

17

stand today?

18

penalty at all?

We have -- how many States have no death
Is it 12?

19

MR. ELLIS:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. ELLIS:

22
23

And looking at that, where do we

It's roughly 12.
Yes.
It in part depends on how Vermont is

counted, but -- but it -QUESTION:

And how many States have now enacted

24

legislation providing that a retarded person may not

25

suffer the death penalty?

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. ELLIS:

There are now 18 States as compared

2

to the 2 that -- that were on the books or were about to

3

go on the books, in the case of Maryland, when this Court

4

decided the Penry case.

5

QUESTION:

Of course, not -- not all of those 18

6

feel so strongly that it is unconstitutional to execute

7

someone with reduced mental capacity that they are willing

8

to apply that to people who've already been sentenced.

9

How many of those 18 States have adopted that law only

10
11
12

prospectively?
MR. ELLIS:

A number of them.

Again, there's a

categorization --

13

QUESTION:

I think there's quite a few.

14

MR. ELLIS:

15

QUESTION:

We don't have a precise number.
And that doesn't -- that doesn't

16

bespeak such a -- such a intransigent view that this is

17

unconstitutional.

18

won't do it in the future, but this person has already

19

been tried and convicted, you know, go ahead.

20

suggest to you that -- that I think it's really

21

unconstitutional or just that I think it's a good idea in

22

the future not to do it?

23

I mean, you say, well, you know, we

MR. ELLIS:

Does that

I guess I would characterize,

24

Justice Scalia, the statutes not as having concluded that

25

the practice was unconstitutional, but instead that it was

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

unacceptable.

But that still leaves your point.

2

QUESTION:

3

it's not desirable.

4

seems to me.

5

about a consensus, you're talking about a consensus that

6

something is so -- so terrible that it should not be

7

permitted.

8

just not going to do it in the future.

9

Well, no, it doesn't.

It just says

That's all the statute suggests, it

And I -- I thought when you were talking

And these States are permitting it.

MR. ELLIS:

They're

I -- I would respectfully suggest

10

that they have not reached that judgment.

11

the States that have prospective only language, that is to

12

say, some kind of bar -- and it varies among the statutes

13

to looking backward to cases already decided.

14

of those cases, it was clear that there was no one with

15

mental retardation currently under sentence of death in

16

that State.

17

encompass people on death row in that State would have

18

been unnecessary in the view of legislators and might

19

have --

21
22

In the bulk

And so, passing a statute that would

QUESTION:

20

In the bulk of

How do we know that?

How do we know

that?
MR. ELLIS:

The -- the discussion in the -- in

23

State legislatures, there isn't legislative history in

24

quite the way there is in Congress.

25

QUESTION:

Pity.

7
Alderson Reporting Company

1

(Laughter.)

2

MR. ELLIS:

3

I was going to say this must be a

source of substantial disappointment.

4

(Laughter.)

5

MR. ELLIS:

But -- but what -- what evidence we

6

have comes from recordings of the debates and, in

7

particular, journalistic accounts from -- from those

8

debates.

9

the concern of treating differently people who have been

10

sentenced to death previously and those who would face a

11

capital trial prospectively was not a principal concern.

12

And I'm trying to come up with a State in which it was

13

known that there was someone who had mental retardation on

14

death row.

15

that conclusion, there had already been a judgment by

16

another court that the individual involved -- it was in

17

Arkansas -- didn't have mental retardation.

18

It -- it is clear from those that the -- that

The only State in which I might have reached

QUESTION:

Mr. Ellis, would you -- would you

19

agree -- you know, I'm not -- assuming I agree that --

20

that when there is a -- a new consensus that the

21

Constitution means something it didn't mean before the

22

Constitution means that new thing, assuming I agree with

23

that, you -- you must agree that -- that we have to be

24

very careful about finding new consensuses, don't you?

25

Because we can't go back.

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

I mean, if we find a consensus here that it is

2

indeed unconstitutional to execute the mentally retarded

3

and then it turns out that there are a lot of problems,

4

that indeed in every case, every capital case, there's

5

going to be a claim of mental retardation and people come

6

to believe that in many of these cases you get expert

7

witnesses -- you can easily get them on -- on both sides

8

-- people become dissatisfied with that.

9

to go back, will we?

We won't be able

Because the evidence of the

10

consensus is supposed to be legislation, and once we've

11

decided that you cannot legislate the execution of the

12

mentally retarded, there can't be any legislation that

13

enables us to go back.

14

about the national consensus before we come to such a

15

judgment, don't you think?

16

MR. ELLIS:

So, we better be very careful

I would agree with you, Justice

17

Scalia, that as the Court has said in various ways in

18

several of the cases that the -- that the proponents of

19

the view that there is a consensus bear an extraordinarily

20

heavy burden of demonstration.

21

concerns that you raise about the possibility that

22

sentiment might especially in the -- in the presence of

23

experience enacting a statute swing the other way, while

24

theoretically possible, is not borne out by the experience

25

in the 18 States, but in particular in the States that

But the particular

enacted some years ago.

2

QUESTION:

Well, but Justice Scalia's basic

3

premise that it's a one-way ratchet is correct.

4

not?

5

MR. ELLIS:

Is it

This Court has not had -- had

6

occasion to address that in particular.

7

suppose, that it has come is the Court confronting the

8

ambiguity with regard to the execution of individuals

9

below the age of 16 and -- and the presumption that the

10
11

The closest, I

Court reached in the face of that ambiguity.
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Ellis, logically it has to

12

be a one-way ratchet.

13

consensus cannot be manifested.

14

constitutionally pass any laws allowing the execution of

15

the mentally retarded once -- once we agree with you that

16

it's unconstitutional.

17

never be able to go back because there will never be any

18

legislation that can reflect a changed consensus.

19

QUESTION:

Logically it has to be because a
States cannot

That is the end of it.

We will

Of course, isn't it true that every

20

new constitutional holding is a one-way ratchet in exactly

21

the same way?

22

MR. ELLIS:

Not only in the area of the Eighth

23

Amendment but in others as well.

We could all imagine

24

ways in which dissatisfaction with the ruling might

25

manifest itself --

1

QUESTION:

2

MR. ELLIS:

3

QUESTION:

Mr. Ellis -Yes.
-- I guess there's no uniform

4

determination of when someone should be regarded as

5

mentally retarded.

6

from State to State, do they not?

7

MR. ELLIS:

The standards probably vary somewhat

Justice O'Connor, they vary

8

remarkably little.

The definitions are not framed in

9

exactly identical forms because often States have adopted

10

the definition that they employ for disability benefits

11

purposes or guardianship purposes or commitment.

12

QUESTION:

I guess my point is even if this

13

Court were to say that it's unconstitutional to execute a

14

person who's mentally retarded, presumably it would still

15

be open to the State to determine whether that individual

16

is mentally retarded under the State's definition, or is

17

there some Federal definition you're asking us to employ?

18

MR. ELLIS:

It seems to me that the States would

19

be free to define mental retardation -- and, as I say,

20

many use the definition they already have, that their

21

clinicians are accustomed to -- so long as the definition

22

they chose carried with it the core principles of the

23

definition of mental retardation that this Court discussed

24

in Penry, that is to say, a measured intelligence in the

25

bottom 2 percent -- in the bottom 2-and-a-half percent of

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the population or 2 standard deviations below the mean,

2

plus an impact on the real world functioning of the

3

individual and as --

4

QUESTION:

Well, this -- this actually links up

5

to the consensus problem if you take -- I don't think a

6

poll is relevant, but assuming you took a poll and since

7

you execute the retarded, I think most people would have

8

in -- in mind an image of mental retardation which doesn't

9

reflect the sophistication of the DSM which talks about

10

mild retardation and defines somebody who's mildly

11

retarded as educable with an IQ of maybe as high as -- in

12

that range of -- of 70 with -- with some -- with some room

13

for statistical error.

14

defining retardation that's any different than what's in

15

the DSM?

16

MR. ELLIS:

Do the States have some leeway in

With regard to -- with regard to

17

details, as I suggested a moment ago, there -- there is

18

room for some difference, but with regard to the core

19

principles, which I take to be at the center of -- of your

20

question, are we describing the same group of people --

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. ELLIS:

Yes.
-- what we've discovered in the

23

States is that they've all come to essentially the same

24

conclusion, which is all the people who fall within the

25

AAMR or DSM-IV-TR definition are the people that they

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

chose to protect.

2

And going to your earlier point about what

3

people know about the level of functioning of individuals

4

with mental retardation -- yes, Your Honor -- there --

5

other than parents -- parents I'd put aside -- there is, I

6

think, no group in this country more aware of the variety

7

among people with mental retardation and the levels of

8

functioning at each level than State legislators.

9

QUESTION:

This -- this goes to the -- where is

10

the burden of proof in a case like -- supposing your view

11

is adopted, the State charges capital murder.

12

burden of proof on the defendant to show that he's

13

retarded?
MR. ELLIS:

14

Yes, Your Honor.

Is the

Every State that

15

has enacted a statute has placed the burden on the

16

defendant, although they have done it in somewhat

17

different ways.
QUESTION:

18

Mr. Ellis, what about this very case?

19

There was some confusion, but the Virginia Supreme Court

20

seemed to doubt that this person would qualify as mentally

21

retarded.

22

to be a remand on that question?

23

If -- if you would prevail, wouldn't there have

MR. ELLIS:

Obviously, in our -- we would not be

24

totally disappointed if this Court were to resolve that

25

question, but the -- the likelihood and prospect of a

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

remand obviously would be an appropriate response so that

2

the Virginia courts who did not, in this case, have before

3

them mental retardation as a legal question that was going

4

to decide anything -- it was simply an observation in the

5

course of making --

6

QUESTION:

7

Supreme Court say about this defendant and --

8
9

Well, what precisely did the Virginia

MR. ELLIS:

I -- I think maybe the -- the

Virginia Supreme Court's decision on that can be best

10

characterized as expressing concern as to whether or not

11

the individual -- in this case Mr. Atkins -- had mental

12

retardation because of the testimony of Dr. Samenow that

13

-- that suggested that there had not been a full

14

demonstration of the impact of his impairment in his life,

15

the second prong of the definition --

16

QUESTION:

Can you tell me --

17

QUESTION:

Mr. Ellis, apart from the consensus

18

argument and these details, what is the real reason behind

19

your position?

20

retarded?

21

What's wrong with executing the mentally

MR. ELLIS:

In our view, Your Honor, the people

22

with mental retardation who have both that intellectual

23

functioning as the core and it has manifested itself in

24

their life throughout their life -- those individuals in

25

our view lack the culpability or blame worthiness because

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

their understanding of their actions, their understanding

2

of the context in which their actions took place --

3
4
5

QUESTION:

Well, why are they subject to

criminal liability at all then?
MR. ELLIS:

They are subject to criminal

6

liability because it isn't our contention that they, for

7

example, can't tell -- to use the -- the language in -- in

8

Virginia's defense of insanity, that they can't tell right

9

from wrong.

What we're suggesting -- so, we're not

10

suggesting they can't be punished.

11

what we are contending is that, though they can be

12

punished, the death penalty is different, and it is

13

reserved for those whose understanding is sufficiently

14

clear that the penalty of death can be appropriate.

15

QUESTION:

What -- what we're --

So, nothing wrong with putting a

16

retarded person -- we know that there's a problem with

17

definition, but -- in -- in jail for life, solitary.

18

can exercise in a cage.

19

MR. ELLIS:

He

Nothing in the ruling that we seek

20

here would preclude the State from imposing the most

21

serious penalty it has other than the penalty of death.

22

Most States do.

23

statutes have explicitly provided in those statutes that

24

an individual exempted from the death penalty by the

25

statute will be subjected to -- and then it explicitly

A number of the States that have passed

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

says, in some cases, life imprisonment without possibility

2

of parole, or whatever the heaviest penalty.

3

QUESTION:

Should the test be the same as for

4

executing someone with a mental illness?

5

dealt with that, and -- and with the level of

6

comprehension that someone must have in order to be

7

eligible for the death penalty who has mental illness.

8

Should the test be the same?

9

MR. ELLIS:

We -- we have

Your Honor, I believe you're

10

discussing the Ford issue with regard to competence to be

11

executed?

12

the individual had mental illness or mental retardation,

13

if -- if that individual lacked the understanding as

14

execution became imminent, that they -- that the State

15

would be precluded from executing.

16
17

I read the Ford case as suggesting that whether

QUESTION:

This --

So, is that test not adequate here in

your view?

18

MR. ELLIS:

19

adequate for several reasons.

20

holding focuses on a defendant and -- and his mental state

21

late in the process, as -- as execution is impending.

22

mental retardation question, as addressed by the States in

23

-- in the years since Penry, focuses on the individual's

24

mental functioning at the time of the crime.

Why aren't they sufficient to indeed excuse

understanding was, of necessity, limited by their mental
functioning.
QUESTION:

Their understanding -- I mean, they

have to have known that what they were doing is wrong.
MR. ELLIS:

In order to be convicted in any of

these States, yes.
QUESTION:

So, isn't that the only thing that

bears upon culpability?
MR. ELLIS:

It seems to me, Your Honor, that it

18

is not because -- because under our system of capital

punishment, as it has been shaped by the decisions by this

20

Court, we don't say that the death penalty is available

for everyone who can be punished.

Yes, I think it's totally untrue.

So, what we're saying in -- in

those individuals who can be punished, as individuals

reminds, death is different, a different calculus, a

What is the reason for this emerging

MR. ELLIS:

The principal reason -- and -- and

18

it has changed a little bit as -- as the -- as the process

19

has gone on.

20

is that people, as expressed through the legislature, have

21

reached a judgment that someone whose intellect is at this

22

level and who has grown up with that limitation on their

23

ability to learn -- because age of onset is part of the

24

definition of mental retardation as well -- are not

25

individuals for whom death is an appropriate punishment.

No.

I realize that that's the

2

judgment they're reaching, and you want us to recognize

3

that judgment as now having constitutional significance.

4

What I want to know is why are they reaching that

5

judgment?

6

to one of constitutional significance?

7

What is the reason that elevates that judgment

I guess the -- the converse of my question is

we're not here simply to add up numbers and say, oh, when

it gets to 37, the result is different.

You're -- you're

10

asking us to make a different kind of -- of -- draw a

11

different kind of conclusion.

12

what is it behind the judgment of these emerging States as

13

a reason that should recommend itself to us?

14

MR. ELLIS:

And what I want to know is

And -- and as I said, the principal

15

focus is on the understanding of people of what the

limitations imposed on people with mental retardation are

MR. ELLIS:

Yes.
I mean, is that the idea?
It is -- it is that their

QUESTION:

Mr. Ellis, I thought that you had

2

said something different in your brief, and it was that

3

people in this class have diminished capacity when it

4

comes to the life or death decision.

5

that they will be smiling in the -- and the jury will say,

6

well, how inappropriate.

effectively with their -- their counsel.

that it's the image of this person when the life/death

I thought you said

They're not expressing any

That they will not be able to communicate as
That it's --

10

decision is made that they give false clues to the trier,

11

to the jury, and that will disable counsel from

12

representing such a person on that life/death decision.

13

You haven't said anything like that in your oral argument.

14

MR. ELLIS:

And -- and that was the point I was

15

adverting -- was adverting to a moment ago, that the

16

principal reason is, as I've suggested, the shared

17

understanding of the diminished culpability of people with

18

mental retardation.

19

But increasingly, especially in the last 3 or 4

20

years, there has been a second and secondary reason for

21

enactment of the statutes which is a growing concern that

22

individuals with mental retardation facing capital charges

23

present a particularly and uncomfortably large possibility

24

of wrongful conviction and thus wrongful execution.

25

-- the cases in both Virginia and in Illinois over the

1

last few years have made what I acknowledge is a secondary

2

argument but one which comes up in legislative discussions

3

with increasing frequency, that -- that in just the way

4

you were describing, that the process of adjudicating in a

5

capital case someone who has mental retardation and who's

6

understanding that -- is that limited may, through a

7

variety of mechanisms, increase the likelihood of wrongful

8

conviction and thus unjust execution.

10

QUESTION:

Counsel is not able to bring that to

the jury's attention --

11

MR. ELLIS:

12

QUESTION:

Counsel --- and say, ladies and gentlemen of

13

the jury -- in fact, he can bring mental retardation to

14

the attention of the jury as a basis for the -- for the

15

jury's deciding not to execute the person, can he not?

16

MR. ELLIS:

17

QUESTION:

18

He clearly can.
There's no question that in all

States he can do that.

19

MR. ELLIS:

20

QUESTION:

That's right.
So, you're saying the jury is not

21

constitutionally even allowed to -- to be given the

22

option.

23

And counsel can say to the jury, during this

trial, you -- you may see my client smiling inappropriate

that would be effective in guarding against that concern,

10

but that also backs into the problem this Court observed

11

in Penry, which is in a case-by-case determination,

12

particularly in cases in which juries are making the

13

decision, the mental retardation may in fact be a two-

14

edged sword, that the -- that the juror, in evaluating

15

whether or not to impose the penalty of death, may see

16

mental retardation not only as a mitigating or potentially

17

mitigating factor, but it may also see it as tied to

prospective dangerousness.

In how many of those States have

there been executions of retarded people since Penry the

MR. ELLIS:

roughly two or three, yes.
QUESTION:

So, you -- you have less -- less than

14

half of the States that have capital punishment make an

exception for the mentally retarded, and you say that that

constitutes a consensus.

17

MR. ELLIS:

18

QUESTION:

Less than half.

Not by itself.
I can see the argument that there's a

19

consensus on the other side since the other side seems to

20

be in the majority, but you say less than half represents

21

a consensus.

22

MR. ELLIS:

I'm not sure that -- that we could

conclude, for example, that people in the States that

24

don't have the death penalty approve its imposition or if

25

they adopted a death penalty would include within the

MR. ELLIS:

Well, that -- that is another way of

7

counting.

And I don't -- I don't want to slip into what

8

an amicus on the other side referred to as the counting of

9

noses.

This is a serious business, as this Court has

10

recognized, and the fact that the Court has not treated

11

large States differently from small suggests that the

12

Court is looking at these enactments not only to count up

13

the jurisdictions that have adopted it, but also to see

14

whether the process by which they have been enacted is

15

revealing of a settled moral judgment, in this case a

16

moral judgment of revulsion --

17

QUESTION:

Settled.

But we also said in Penry

18

that -- you know, the argument was made to us that there

19

was an emerging consensus, and we rejected that.

an emerging consensus is not enough.

MR. ELLIS:

There has to be a

And our position, on the basis of

QUESTION:

4

You're not talking about polls if

you're talking about public sentiment, are you?

MR. ELLIS:

It seems to me, Your Honor, that --

6

that the polling information, which was quite scanty then

7

and is now quite full, as suggested in the AAMR amicus

8

brief in McCarver, is part of the picture.

feel that way, it would -- it would be manifested in

MR. ELLIS:

And increasingly it is.
Yes, but are you saying that somehow

polls are to be considered in addition to legislation?
MR. ELLIS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

that that evidence is -- is highly debatable in most

2

really is not so.

3

And the reason for having a rule saying, we're

4

going to have a -- a retardation cutoff -- a person who is

5

retarded will be ineligible for the death penalty -- is to

6

avoid those high risk cases and avoid the risk, in effect,

7

of wrong imposition of the death penalty.

would have such a rule, quite apart from moral judgments

or anything else.

10

That's why we

I'm just talking about this practical

risk judgment.
And my question to you is, do you say that our

That's what individualized

That is the risk assessment rule.

That's

18

within the category of those who ought to be subject to

I'm asking whether you believe that in risky cases there

21

ought to be rules to eliminate the risk.

I'm being unfair to -- to your position here.

assessments that you're talking about play into the -- the

concepts of individualized sentencing under the Eighth

I don't think the Eighth Amendment plays

Mr. Rumpz, I -- it's a hard question

I guess you're talking --

There -- there is not a proper or an

improper death -- death sentence.
QUESTION:

I guess you're talking about a class

23

of -- you said this class of people -- and I'm not sure

24

you meant that -- is no less culpable than you or me.

25

I thought the class of people we're talking about is a

But

going on.

they can't understand anything complicated.

capable of following the leader, whoever is the leader

9

nearby.

Barely.

So, they know right from wrong, but
They have a

Their emotions are no more
So, they

But they won't take in the nature

And therefore, this class of people is different

10

enough than you, than me, that we wouldn't say they are

11

similarly culpable.

12

people have reached that conclusion.

13

And I guess in 48 of the 50 States,

All right.

Now -- now, that's I take this case.

14

And I say 48 because I want you to disagree with me so we

15

can then explore that.

16

(Laughter.)

17

QUESTION:

18

mean, there's an argument --

19

MS. RUMPZ:

20

QUESTION:

But I thought that that was -- I

I'll be -But I want you to address, A, I've

21

tried to make a point maybe they are not so culpable as

22

you or me.

23

United States seem to agree with that.

24

those are the two things I want you to address.

25

And second, an awful lot of people in the

MS. RUMPZ:

In fact, I -- now,

Well, first of all, I think this

35
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

case is a perfect illustration of the first point, the

2

first point being that -- that they are.

3

competent to stand trial and competent to assist your

4

lawyers, you are like you and me.

5

perfect understanding of the system, knew all about

wanted his retardation put in front of the jury if it

helped him.

10

If you are found

Daryl Atkins had a

He had no deficits in understanding the

system.
Moving on to the second point, 18 of the 38

11
12

death penalty States have formed or have enacted some sort

13

-- excuse me -- some sort of laws prohibiting execution of

14

the mentally retarded.

15

however, is that that 18 is -- is not written in stone

16

because many of the statutes don't provide for retroactive

17

application.

The Commonwealth's position,

So, you're looking --

QUESTION:

There was a time -- there was a

The -- the question I have on that is

21

you want to say less than 18.

MS. RUMPZ:

23

QUESTION:

18
19

time --

I -- I sure do.
I want to know why not far more than

24

18, and my reason for that is that in -- of the remaining

25

20 -- there are two States that have executed retarded

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

people, and they account, I gather, for about 7 percent of

2

the population.

3

passed this law yet, why would someone feel a need to pass

4

it?

5

But in the remaining States that haven't

I noticed, which I copied here, that the

6

Governor of Texas said, I am -- I am going to veto this

7

law because we do not execute mentally retarded murderers

8

today.

Now -- now, he might have been wrong about that in

9

Texas.

I don't know.

But regardless, why would a State

10

that never even has executions, but they have it on the

11

books, feel constrained to pass a law?

12

MS. RUMPZ:

Well, I -- I think that -- that the

13

fact that 18 States have done so in the last 13 years --

14

it doesn't mean that that --

15

QUESTION:

Presumably those States were

16

executing a lot of retarded people, and that's why the

17

laws were passed.

18
19
20
21
22

MS. RUMPZ:

Well, that's an equally good

assumption.
QUESTION:

Well, I assume -- an even simpler

assumption is that they were executing people.
Let me ask you a kind of a -- a specific example

23

of Justice Breyer's question.

In -- in your calculation,

24

how do you account for the -- for a State like the one

25

that I come from that has not executed somebody in over 60

37
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

years?

2

approves of executing the retarded?

3

State that shouldn't be counted at all?

4

account for that in your calculus?

5
6

Do you say, well, that's a State that apparently

MS. RUMPZ:

(Laughter.)

8

QUESTION:

10

How do you

I don't know what State you come

from, first of all.

7

9

Do you say that's a

I'm from -- I'm from New Hampshire,

and the last execution was in '38 or '39.
MS. RUMPZ:

I guess my answer to that is that

11

this Court has said that societal consensuses are formed,

12

and when you're looking to see whether there is a societal

13

consensus, you look to the statutes that the -- that the

14

legislators have passed.

15

QUESTION:

But that's what we're asking about,

16

and Justice Breyer's question, as well as Justice

17

Souter's, is -- I think must recognize the premise that

18

one of the great facts of life in American Government is

19

legislative inertia.

20

they're prompted to do so.

21

to just sit down and say, oh, I think it's a good time for

22

us to pass a -- a bill on -- against executing the

23

mentally retarded if there's no such person on death row.

24

Legislatures just don't operate that way.

25

MS. RUMPZ:

Legislatures don't act unless
And a legislature is not going

Or there's no such person -- person

2

crime, was not competent at the time of his trial, was not

3

competent to assist his lawyers.

there.

5

QUESTION:

There's a difference

What -- what do we know, Ms. Rumpz,

6

about the situation in the States, the 18 States which

7

have prohibited the execution of the retarded?

8

just gone through a tremendous number of retarded

9

executions?

10

MS. RUMPZ:

11

QUESTION:

Had they

I suspect not.
Do we -- is there any -- anything in

12

the briefs that indicates why these States passed the

13

legislation that they did?
MS. RUMPZ:

14

No, there's not.

And -- and I can

15

speculate that it's a pretty pro -- anti-death penalty

16

machine out there working, but -QUESTION:

17

Justice Breyer says only two mentally

18

retarded people have been executed in -- in the last I

19

don't know what.

20

States.

21

think they're good laws to enact, and maybe that's why the

22

18 did it.

23

So, that couldn't explain these 18

So, maybe legislatures do enact laws because they

No, no.

I said two in -- two, but it

may be a few more.

That's what I'm not -- in two States

in those States that haven't enacted the laws.

Of course,

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the ones that have enacted the laws don't have the

2

executions, and some of them did execute mentally retarded

3

people before they passed the law.

4

MS. RUMPZ:

Well, the Federal Death Penalty

We've gone through those and -- and

tried bit by bit, and most of them are in these States and

10

then some of them are -- have IQ's of 70 or over.

11

would say in that -- they're -- they're erring on the side

12

of counting mentally retarded.

13

at 70, look below it, you get to the numbers I had.

14

I'm looking to you for giving me the good

But if you draw the line

15

numbers and -- and the lawyers.

16

it out it was two States, but I'm not certain.

17

MS. RUMPZ:

And I

That's why I -- I figured

I -- I think just because two States

18

in -- in -- since 1989 have executed mentally retarded

19

offenders doesn't mean that there aren't mentally retarded

20

offenders in the pipeline waiting to be -- to become

21

executed or waiting to go through their appellate process

22

or -- or coming up to trial.

You know and I know that

23

this is a very slow process.

These cases drag on for

24

years and years, decades.

number like that, you necessarily have to figure in all --

And -- and when you look to a

Leave it at this, that since Penry --

pretty sure that two of them, accounting for about 7

percent of the population, have executed mentally retarded

people and maybe double that if you want, triple it.

7

there are 14 percent, 20 percent.

8

consensus?

9

There's no consensus.

Since Penry, 18 States have

And in the remaining States, we're

Say

Still, isn't that a

Why not?

MS. RUMPZ:

Well, I -- I guess I'd go back to

10

what Justice Scalia said in one of his opinions is that

11

that may very well just be that juries and prosecutors and

12

society believes that the death penalty ought to be

13

imposed on the mentally retarded less often.
QUESTION:

14

Ms. Rumpz, if we stayed just with the

15

18 plus the 12 that don't have the death penalty, then we

16

get up to what?

17

MS. RUMPZ:

18

QUESTION:

30.
Three-fifths of all the States.

19

get enough to, for example, block a filibuster in the

20

Senate.

21

doesn't that suffice?

22

That's a super majority.

MS. RUMPZ:

Why isn't that -- why

For two reasons.

First of all, I

23

don't think you can count 18 as 18 because in some of

24

those States, you can execute the mentally retarded.

25

QUESTION:

We

Now, there was a time in this Court

41
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

-- it wasn't all that long ago -- when this Court was

2

making prospective declarations of unconstitutionality,

3

this case and all future cases, not past cases.

4

States that haven't made it retroactive haven't gotten up

5

to speed on that once it's -- once we make a declaration

6

of unconstitutionality, it's retrospective.

7

MS. RUMPZ:

Maybe the

Even given that, New York has in its

8

statute specifically that people who commit murders, while

9

in prison, can be executed even if they're mentally

10

retarded.

So, you have to take New York from the list.

11

Mentally retarded offenders can be executed in New York.
Second of all, I don't think you can add the 12

12
13

non-death penalty States and -- to -- to a number of death

14

penalty States to try to form a societal consensus.

15

QUESTION:

16

MS. RUMPZ:

Why not?
Well, because they may have some

17

bearing on whether there's a consensus against the death

18

penalty altogether.

19

QUESTION:

Right, and it includes that.

20

imagine that you would say you couldn't count those

21

States.

22

MS. RUMPZ:

I can't

Well, Wisconsin tomorrow may decide

23

to adopt a death penalty statute, and if they do, they'll

24

have to affirmatively legislate a number of things.

25

They'll have to pick an age where it can be imposed.

42
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

They'll have to decide whether they're weighing or non-

4

those things have to be considered by the State

5

legislature, and I don't think we can presume --

6

They'll have to decide whether they're going to

QUESTION:

Let me try this another way.

All of

Do you

7

-- do you concede that if there is a consensus, whatever

8

that means, then this Court should make the determination

9

that we're asked to make here?

10

MS. RUMPZ:

11

QUESTION:

12

You don't agree that if there's a

consensus, then the Eighth Amendment would bar it.

13

MS. RUMPZ:

14

QUESTION:

15

No.

No.

And -- and I think that --

This Court said that might, indeed,

be the law in Penry, but you say we were wrong there.
MS. RUMPZ:

16

No.

I -- I refer the Court to

Spaziano v. Florida where the -- where the Court said you

don't just nose count.

decide to do one thing or not do other things doesn't

necessarily bind the -- the -- this Court and the other

States.

QUESTION:

You -- you have to look at the

But you do not even accept the notion

24

that if there is a consensus and we find there is, that

25

that answers the question.

I take it you do not accept

1

that.

2
3

MS. RUMPZ:

I think that Spaziano says

different.

4

QUESTION:

Well, do you accept the view that

5

there is in fact an evolutionary element in Eighth

6

Amendment jurisprudence, that in fact it does change as --

7

as societal notions of reasonableness in terms of cruelty

8

change?

9
10
11

MS. RUMPZ:

Well, this Court has said that there

I'm in too.

That's the answer.

The Court said that.

That's the position

framework that we are supposed to be working in.

submit your case on the basis of that framework.

QUESTION:

You

That's what -- that's what this

May I ask another question on a

21

little different line?

22

consensus in the argument here that the number of

23

executions of the mentally retarded is rather small.

24

MS. RUMPZ:

25

QUESTION:

I think there's been sort of a

Yes.
And does not that reflect the fact

44
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that juries generally are reluctant to execute the

2

mentally retarded, to impose the death penalty on the

3

mentally retarded?

4

MS. RUMPZ:

I -- I don't know that that reflects

5

that.

6

That could -- that could reflect mitigation versus non-

7

mitigation.

8
9

That -- that could reflect a number of things.

It could reflect -- the brief of the --

Well, if -- if it is true, isn't --

is that not one of the facts on which the Court relied in

the rape case, holding that the crime of rape could not be

12

MS. RUMPZ:

13

Exactly.

This Court looks at the

laws and the application of the laws.
QUESTION:

14

And the -- and the number of juries

15

that refuse to impose the death penalty.

16

part of the consensus is what the juries have done as well

17

as what State legislatures have done.
MS. RUMPZ:

18

And so, that's

Is that not right?

That is exactly right.

But I don't

think that you can infer that because there are X many of

MS. RUMPZ:

Absolutely not.

2

QUESTION:

Because juries so rarely impose it?

3

QUESTION:

No, but it is -- it is part of our

4

law.

And I read you a sentence out of Coker against

5

Georgia.

6

at least 9 out of 10, juries have not imposed the death

7

sentence.

8

held that the death sentence was unconstitutional.

9

that not correct?

10

It is true that in the vast majority of cases,

And that was one of the reasons why the Court

MS. RUMPZ:

Is

Well, I think that the fact that

11

we're here arguing this case today is proof that juries

12

do, in fact, give the death penalty to mentally retarded

13

people.

do.

No.

The point isn't that they never

It's the point that they rarely do.
MS. RUMPZ:

And the fact that they rarely do,

18

like I said earlier, could mean that juries believe, just

19

as Atkins' team believes, that it -- that it should be

20

rarely imposed.

21

QUESTION:

Well, it -- it also may represent a

22

jury's belief that it is a mitigating circumstance of such

23

force that they should be spared the death penalty.

24

QUESTION:

25

MS. RUMPZ:

Of course.
And I agree.

And in this case, the

46
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

jury was specifically told about Atkins' mental

retardation.

3

and two different sentencing juries, after hearing from

4

Atkins' expert witness, and after hearing the vile nature

5

of his crime and about his 25 prior felonies, 24 jurors

6

gave him the death sentence.

7

QUESTION:

Two doctors testified about it at length,

Ms. Rumpz, in making this cruel and

8

unusual decision -- this is an issue that's come up

MS. RUMPZ:

the questions that this Court has raised.

16

population.

conclusion that the -- in this case, the understanding of
