CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Mr. -- Mr. Moore.

6

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL E. MOORE

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9
10

MR. MOORE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The court of appeals was without authority to

11

grant habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. 2254(d)(1) on

12

respondent's ineffective assistance of counsel claim for

13

two reasons: first, because the State court decision

14

rejecting the claim correctly identified this Court's

15

decision in Strickland v. Washington as the clearly

16

established Federal law governing this case, not United

17

States v. Cronic as respondent contends; and second,

18

because the State court's application of Strickland to the

19

facts of respondent's case was not objectively

20

unreasonable.

21

Turning to the first point, respondent's

22

ineffective assistance claim from the outset of this case

23

has asserted two specific errors that his attorney

24

allegedly committed during the sentencing phase of his

25

capital trial:

first, counsel's alleged failure to

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

present available mitigating evidence; and second, his

2

counsel's decision to waive closing argument.

3

This Court held in Strickland that such claims

4

are properly analyzed under the two-part actual deficient

5

performance/actual prejudice test announced in that case

6

itself.

7

QUESTION:

Mr. Moore, I think what happened in

8

this sentencing proceeding, if I remember correctly, is

9

that the attorney made some remarks at the beginning of

10

the sentencing hearing?

11

MR. MOORE:

Yes, Your Honor.

He delivered an

12

opening statement, during which he specifically called the

13

jury's attention, as he is permitted to do under Tennessee

14

State law, to guilt phase evidence, mental health

15

evidence, upon which he was relying in mitigation.

16

explained to the jury its mitigating significance by

17

relating that evidence specifically to three statutory

18

mitigating factors.

19

In addition, during that opening statement, he

20

emphasized his client's remorse for his role in the

21

crimes.

22

his country.

23
24
25

He

He emphasized his client's honorable service for

QUESTION:

Did he explain that he wouldn't be

presenting any evidence or saying anything more?
MR. MOORE:

He -- he did not indicate one way or

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

the other in that statement, but he specifically -QUESTION:

Now, would you be here -- would you

3

still be here if he had not said anything at the opening?

4

Then what rule applies?

5

totally remained silent in the sentencing phase.

6

Cronic be the test?

7

MR. MOORE:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. MOORE:

Suppose the defense attorney just
Would

No, Your Honor.
No?
It is our -- it is our position that

10

if the claim focuses on counsel's conduct during the trial

11

and it is not alleged that any errors or omissions he made

12

were the result of State interference or so-called

13

surrounding circumstances, then such a claim is properly

14

analyzed under Strickland's two-part test.

15

QUESTION:

The attorney here did successfully

16

object to the presentation of some evidence during the

17

sentencing phase, didn't he?

18

MR. MOORE:

Yes, indeed, Your Honor, he did.

He

19

vigorously objected and -- to the admission of some very

20

gruesome crime scene photographs that the prosecution

21

sought to introduce to establish the heinous, atrocious,

22

and cruel aggravating circumstance, and he succeeded in

23

excluding that testimony.

In addition, he -- he objected

24

to some hearsay evidence.

And so, the -- the Sixth

25

Circuit's suggestion that counsel simply sat mute at the

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

sentencing hearing simply is belied by this record.
QUESTION:

Just to go back to Justice O'Connor's

3

question, suppose the attorney says nothing and later

4

says, you know, I was just -- I don't know -- stressed

5

out, traumatized.

6

proceeding.

7

I -- I really blanked out during that

No Cronic there?

And -- and do you say Cronic doesn't apply

8

because he did participate in the earlier phase of the

9

case and you don't want us to bifurcate guilt phase and

10

sentencing?

Was -- was that the basis of your answer?

11

MR. MOORE:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. MOORE:

No, Your Honor.
It's a two-part question.
No, Your Honor.

Our position is

14

that if the ineffective assistance claim asserts that the

15

lawyer, for whatever reason, failed to do something or did

16

something in error, that -- those kinds of claims are

17

properly analyzed under Strickland, and we think that's a

18

fair reading of Strickland.

19

conflict of interest claims aside, actual ineffectiveness

20

claims alleging a deficiency in attorney performance are

21

subject to the general requirement that the defendant

22

affirmatively prove prejudice.

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. MOORE:

25

Strickland itself says

When does Cronic apply?
Cronic in our view is properly read

to apply only when surrounding circumstances or State

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

interference renders it unlikely that any lawyer could

2

have rendered effective assistance of counsel.

3

Cronic itself --

4
5
6

QUESTION:

Of course,

Well, in my -- in my hypothetical, he

said I just blanked out for a minute.
MR. MOORE:

But that circumstance is the

7

lawyer's own problem.

8

in our view, it shouldn't matter whether counsel's

9

failure, for example, to make a critical objection or to

For our -- for analytical purposes

10

do something he should have done was the result of his

11

being asleep or his working a crossword puzzle or his

12

ignorance of the law.

13

conduct, what he did or failed to do, violated prevailing

14

professional norms.

15

performance, and then the Court under Strickland examines

16

the record to ascertain whether that error --

17

QUESTION:

What ought to matter is whether his

If -- if it did, that's deficient

Do we take it as a given in this case

18

that the attorney did provide -- that there was

19

ineffective assistance at sentencing?

20

a -- a given?

21

MR. MOORE:

No, Your Honor.

Do we take that as

No, Your Honor.

22

Our petition challenges the correctness of the court of --

23

of appeals decision under section 2254(d)(1), and that

24

involves our argument that the State court's application

25

of Strickland to the facts of this case was not

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

unreasonable.

2

The actual ineffectiveness claims Mr. Hutton's

3

client raises are twofold.

4

mitigating evidence was not presented, but the record

5

simply does not support that claim.

6

obligation to reintroduce the mental health evidence that

7

had been introduced during the guilt phase because

8

Tennessee State law specifically allows counsel to rely on

9

guilt phase evidence.

He complains that available

Counsel was under no

As I earlier indicated, counsel

10

specifically explained the mitigating significance of that

11

evidence to the jury during his opening statement and

12

related it to three specific statutory mitigating

13

circumstances.

14

QUESTION:

This is not the first time in one of

15

these cases I've been surprised at how skimpy the

16

presentation is at -- by the defense counsel on

17

sentencing.

18

the jury knows how important it is; he doesn't want to

19

destroy a -- a certain intensity that they're bringing to

20

their case.

21

skimpy.

Maybe there's some dynamic in the courtroom:

But on the cold record, it certainly seems

22

MR. MOORE:

23

QUESTION:

Well -I'm tempted to ask you if this is

24

usual, but that -- that's probably not a fair question as

25

there are so many differences in so many cases.

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. MOORE:

That's correct, Your Honor.

2

Respondent's complaint that counsel --

3

QUESTION:

Mr. -- Mr. Moore, may I ask you?

On

4

that -- on that branch of it, it seems to me that there

5

was, the prosecutor's presentation to the jury was about a

6

match for the defense attorney's.

7

them were skimpy.

8
9

MR. MOORE:

Neither one -- both of

Yes, Your Honor.

And that is --

that point is critical to our assertion that counsel's

10

decision to waive closing argument was not deficient

11

performance.

12

QUESTION:

But I had another question that I

13

wanted to ask you, and that was you presented two

14

questions.

15

have reached the merits, and two, on the merits they were

16

wrong.

One is that the Sixth Circuit never should

17

MR. MOORE:

18

QUESTION:

19

proceeded just the other way.

20

and then it -- it said it was clearly established.

21

you asking this Court or don't you care what -- what order

22

we take these up in, or do you have a preference?

23

MR. MOORE:

Yes, Your Honor.
As a matter -- and the Sixth Circuit
It decided the merits first
Are

Well, it's our -- it's our position,

24

Your Honor, that it is not the function of this Court

25

under 2254(d) to reach -- to actually address the merits

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

as if it were deciding this claim de novo.

2

question to be resolved here is whether the State court's

3

rejection of the claim was either contrary to or involved

4

an unreasonable application of clearly established law.

5

The only

We would suggest that the Williams v. Taylor

6

opinion provides the blueprint for the decision here.

7

first question is did the State court correctly identify

8

the governing legal principle.

9

QUESTION:

The

Don't you think it would be a little

10

coy for us to decide, well, it wasn't an unreasonable

11

application of -- of Federal law when we, in fact, know

12

that -- or believe that it was a correct application of

13

Federal law?

14

no further than to say, oh, it was -- it was not an

15

unreasonable application?

16

Do you insist that we simply say -- and go

MR. MOORE:

I certainly would not begrudge the

17

Court's agreeing that the State court had indeed correctly

18

applied Strickland.

19

under 2254 the language of the statute contemplates that

20

the Federal court -- court approach the case by looking at

21

the bottom line decision of the State court and

22

ascertaining whether it is reasonable.

23

QUESTION:

But it -- it is my assertion that

Indeed, if we could go no further

24

than -- than the coy statement that it was not an

25

unreasonable application, I suppose you shouldn't have had

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

two questions.

2
3

You should have just had one.

MR. MOORE:

That's correct, Your Honor.

I think

that's right.

4

On the decision to waive closing argument --

5

QUESTION:

Mr. Moore, let -- let me interrupt

6

you.

7

penalty phase of the trial took?

8
9

How -- how -- does the record show how long the

MR. MOORE:

Yes, Your Honor.

The record

reflects that opening statements started at approximately

10

12:07 p.m. and that the jury retired to deliberate at

11

about 3:05 p.m., and there was about an hour-and-ten-

12

minute break for lunch in there.

13

verdict somewhere along about a quarter of four.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. MOORE:

And they announced their

Thank you.
And so, indeed, counsel could have

16

reasonably believed that all of the points he had made

17

during his opening statement, his plea for mercy, his

18

emphasis on his client's remorse, and the mitigating

19

significance of the guilt phase evidence, were fresh in

20

the jury's mind when the jury retired to deliberate

21

because that --

22
23
24
25

QUESTION:

What did he -- what did he say about

the Bronze Star?
MR. MOORE:

During his opening statement, he did

not specifically mention the Bronze Star because that

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

evidence was not elicited until his cross-examination of

2

one of the witnesses during the sentencing phase.

3

however, emphasize during his opening statement his

4

client's service in Vietnam and the toll that service had

5

taken on his client and his mental health status.

6

QUESTION:

7

it in his argument.

He did,

So, your answer is he didn't mention

8

MR. MOORE:

9

Now, counsel's complaint that the Bronze Star

10

had some mitigating significance beyond the fact of its

11

award is simply not supported by the record.

12

was presented to the State post-conviction court that the

13

Bronze Star, other than the fact of its award and the fact

14

that of -- that it indicated Mr. Cone had been decorated

15

-- no evidence elaborating on that was ever presented to

16

the State courts.

17

He did not mention the Bronze Star.

No evidence

Similarly, no evidence concerning Mr. Cone's

18

family background, social history, military record,

19

educational record, none of the evidence that Mr. Hutton

20

complains was not presented during the sentencing phase

21

was ever presented to the State courts during the post-

22

conviction hearing.

23

Accordingly, under this Court's decision in

24

Burger v. Kemp, we say that the State courts reasonably

25

concluded that there was no deficient performance in -- in

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that regard in this case because no record was ever made

2

in the State court concerning what the allegedly available

3

mitigating evidence might have been.

4

introduced indicating what these witnesses who allegedly

5

had knowledge concerning these matters would have said had

6

they been called at the sentencing.

7
8

QUESTION:

No testimony was

But am I right that such evidence was

introduced in the Federal court?

9

MR. MOORE:

No, Your Honor.

This case was

10

resolved on summary judgment, and so none of -- none of

11

that evidence --

12
13

QUESTION:

Were allegations that such evidence

was available made in the Federal proceeding?

14

MR. MOORE:

The allegation that it was available

15

was made in the Federal proceeding, but there was no

16

evidentiary --

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. MOORE:

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. MOORE:

And was that allegation denied?
Yes.
Yes.
Well, I don't know that it was

21

denied.

22

mitigating evidence was presented to the State court, and

23

so therefore --

24
25

Our -- our point in the Federal court was that no

QUESTION:

But if we're not deciding the case on

the basis of what that evidence would prove or disprove,

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

but rather on whether counsel was deficient in failing to

2

introduce it, should we not assume the evidence exists?

3

MR. MOORE:

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. MOORE:

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. MOORE:

No, Your Honor.
We should not?
No, Your Honor.

If -- if --

Why not?
Because the burden rests with the

8

petitioner, the habeas petitioner, to demonstrate its

9

existence.

If -- if the State court -- if it was never

10

presented to the State court, there is no basis for

11

assuming it exists.

12

QUESTION:

13

What -- what was the -- what was the

case you just cited to us for that proposition?

14

MR. MOORE:

Burger v. Kemp.

In that case, Your

15

Honor, just as here, the complaint was that counsel was

16

deficient for failing to put on any mitigating evidence,

17

and in a couple of particulars, this Court noted that

18

counsel had failed to make a record in the State courts

19

concerning whether the -- the allegedly omitted evidence

20

would have had any substantial mitigating impact.

21

that circumstance, this Court said that it could not find

22

deficient performance, let alone prejudice.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

And in

Mr. Moore, are you done with that

point?
MR. MOORE:

Yes, sir.

14

1

QUESTION:

It isn't stated in your brief, but I

2

assume that it's -- it's the Tennessee rule that if -- if

3

the defense doesn't make a closing -- a closing statement,

4

the prosecution doesn't either.

5

MR. MOORE:

6

Is that it?

That's right, and that was the --

the State court found, based on the evidence --

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. MOORE:

Right.
-- presented to it during the post-

9

conviction hearing that counsel made a tactical decision

10

to waive in -- in order to prevent the senior prosecutor

11

from delivering what he --

12
13

QUESTION:

The fearsome Mr. Strother.

could we get him to argue a case up here?

14

(Laughter.)

15

MR. MOORE:

16
17

Could --

I am not -- I am not acquainted with

General Strother, so I'm not sure, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

But I gather that this isn't the only

18

occasion on which defense counsel have eschewed the making

19

of closing argument for fear that Mr. Strother would be

20

enabled to unleash his -- his weaponry.

21

(Laughter.)

22

MR. MOORE:

That's correct, Your Honor.

In

23

fact, one of respondent's own experts at the State post-

24

conviction hearing stated that he had waived closing

25

argument as a defense counsel for precisely the same

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

reason, to -- to prevent Mr. Strother from delivering what

2

was typically a killing rebuttal argument.

3

pronounced that this was a -- clearly a viable trial

4

tactic.

5

And he

In -- in addition, both he and another expert

6

were asked point blank whether waiver of closing in -- in

7

these circumstances with these advocates amounted to

8

essentially a -- a breach of prevailing professional

9

norms.

10

And both refused to say whether it would or

wouldn't.

11

Indeed, we think that that testimony is

12

absolutely critical, because surely if the only witnesses

13

who are actually qualified as experts and competent to

14

testify whether a particular decision of counsel breached

15

prevailing -- prevailing professional norms are unwilling

16

to state that they -- that there has been a breach, surely

17

a State court does not act unreasonably in concluding that

18

the defendant has failed to overcome Strickland's strong

19

presumption that all significant decisions of counsel are

20

made in -- in the exercise of reasonable professional

21

judgment.

22

QUESTION:

Can we go back to the Bronze Star?

23

It certainly did come out in the sentencing phase.

24

did it?

25

MR. MOORE:

Yes, Your Honor.

MR. MOORE:

whether or not that would have been the case.

testified that he viewed that as an opening that he had

20

and that he -- he was actually quite pleased with himself,

get that accomplished without presenting direct evidence

on it.

MR. MOORE:

No, Your Honor, and -- and --- about the circumstances?

evidence about his -- what kind of a person he was before

he went to Vietnam?

3

MR. MOORE:

During sentencing?

No.

There was

4

no evidence concerning his background or character at all,

5

but we don't know what such evidence would have been,

because none was presented to the State court during the

post-conviction proceeding.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT

12

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

13

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

14
15
16

MS. BLATT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The United States has addressed the second

17

question presented, which is whether a defendant must show

18

prejudice to establish a claim of ineffective assistance.

19

Strickland holds that to establish such a claim,

20

counsel's performance must be both deficient and

21

prejudicial.

22

because he alleges that counsel was deficient in failing

23

to present mitigating evidence --

24
25

Respondent's claims fall within Strickland

QUESTION:

Well, do you want us to assume then

that the performance was deficient and then address the

19
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

prejudice prong?

2

MS. BLATT:

No.

I think the -- when the Court

3

addresses the section 2254, the threshold question, if the

4

Court uses Williams v. Taylor as a road map, is whether

5

Strickland is the clearly established law.

6

clearly established law because this claim is an

7

ineffective assistance of counsel claim.

8
9

And it is the

Now, if the Court determines that Strickland is
the correct decision and that the State court correctly

10

identified that decision, then the remaining question is

11

whether the State courts unreasonably applied Strickland

12

on the facts of this case.

13
14

QUESTION:

So, you don't get to question 2 at

all, then.

15

MS. BLATT:

You get to -- you can -- you get to

16

question 2 if, in determining that Strickland and not

17

Cronic is the clearly established law, this Court holds

18

that Cronic does not apply when the claim is an actual

19

ineffective assistance claim.

20

Strickland squarely governs claims alleging deficiencies

21

in attorney performance and that's -- that's what this

22

case is.

23

And that is because

Cronic did make an observation that prejudice

24

may be presumed when counsel entirely fails to subject the

25

prosecution's case to meaningful adversarial testing.

But

20
Alderson Reporting Company

1

that's not this case.

2

for life and he did it in his opening statement.

3

already introduced the substantial mitigation evidence

4

during the sentencing proceeding and the State court

5

procedures expressly allowed the jury to consider that

6

evidence in its sentencing deliberations in determining

7

whether to impose the death sentence.

8
9

Counsel put on a meaningful case
He had

Now, to take a claim of ineffective assistance
and just to presume prejudice under Cronic would be

10

inconsistent with what the Court said in Strickland, and

11

that is, absent a showing of prejudice, it cannot be said

12

that a verdict of a death sentence resulted from an

13

adversarial breakdown that renders the death sentence

14

unreliable.

15

The Court also said --

16

QUESTION:

What -- what if the defense counsel

17

presented nothing at all at the sentencing phase, do you

18

think that there is potential for application of Cronic in

19

those circumstances?

20

MS. BLATT:

21

QUESTION:

So, you differ from Mr. Moore in that

regard.

24
25

We think

Cronic is --

22
23

Yes, Justice O'Connor.

MS. BLATT:
narrow.

We do but our difference is very

We think Cronic refers to an extreme situation

21
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

where counsel provides absolutely no assistance at trial

2

and, in effect, the defendant has been denied the

3

assistance of counsel under Gideon v. Wainwright because

4

essentially the defendant lacked counsel.

5

very rare situation and exceedingly narrow.

6

QUESTION:

And that's a

Why divide trial into, you know, the

7

one phase and then the -- the mitigation phase?

8

part of the same trial.

9

into the -- the direct examination phase and the cross

It's all

Couldn't you likewise divide it

10

examination phase and say that he totally failed to do his

11

job in the cross examination phase?

12

know, you can cut up a -- a trial into as many little

13

pieces as you want --

14

MS. BLATT:

15

QUESTION:

16
17

I mean, you -- you

Right, and --- and say counsel utterly failed to

-- to litigate this particular piece.
MS. BLATT:

We couldn't agree with you more.

18

do that would just swallow the rule in Strickland and

19

would be inconsistent with the idea that counsel could

20

reasonably omit to cross examine a witness or fail to

21

produce evidence.

22

QUESTION:

To

What justification do you have for --

23

for separating out the mitigation phase from the other,

24

especially when some of the evidence that went to

25

mitigation was presented during -- during the direct

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

phase?

2

MS. BLATT:

Right.

And -- and the prosecution

3

may have a reasonable argument in many cases that counsel

4

did not entirely fail to provide assistance.

5

don't take issue with the idea that when Cronic spoke of a

6

situation of counsel entirely failing to -- to provide

7

assistance, that the presumption of prejudice would be

8

assumed.

9

about the entire trial.

10

We just

But I think in -- in many cases, we're talking

QUESTION:

But you're giving up the principle.

11

Once you -- once you allow that you can split it into the

12

-- into the guilt phase and the mitigation phase, it can

13

be split other ways as well, I assume.

14

MS. BLATT:

15

QUESTION:

We don't think so, and -I mean, why wouldn't it just be

16

here's a counsel who litigated the case properly but he

17

made -- he made a mistake in -- in his litigation?

18

didn't put on any evidence in the -- in the mitigation

19

phase.

20

say, no, we can look at -- look at this trial as really

21

two separate trials, and because he did nothing in the --

22

in the mitigation phase, it is not a situation of -- of

23

inadequate counsel, it's a -- it's a situation of no

24

counsel.

25

don't know why we don't split it up other ways as well.

You don't want to do it that way.

1

MS. BLATT:

We don't think so.

In this case, it

2

would -- it -- it reasonably could fall on the Strickland

3

side if there's a State procedure that allows a jury to

4

consider mitigation evidence, but if there is an entire

5

failure to do anything throughout the entire trial, it is

6

exceedingly unlikely that that could be the result of

7

any --

8
9
10
11

QUESTION:

Well, when -- when you say the entire

trial, are you talking about the penalty phase or the
whole -- the whole trial?
MS. BLATT:

We would be talking about a penalty

12

phase although I agree with Justice Scalia that in the

13

unique situation of this case, where there's an express

14

procedure that allows the jury to consider the mitigation

15

evidence, it's critical to look at counsel's performance

16

during the -- the guilt phase of the trial.

17

But this is not a -- a case where we think

18

there's reasonable dispute about whether this falls under

19

Cronic or Strickland.

20

QUESTION:

Counsel -Excuse me.

Is -- is that unique?

21

mean, if -- if -- is it unique that -- you mean in -- in

22

other States, the jury in the mitigation phase is not

23

allowed to consider evidence that -- that came in during

24

the penalty phase?

25

MS. BLATT:

I

I don't think that is unique and I'm

1

sorry if I misspoke.

QUESTION:

3

MS. BLATT:

4

QUESTION:

I don't think it is.
I think it's -Which means the two phases are

5

linked.

6

some basis for saying the mitigation phase is so separate

7

that if he doesn't introduce evidence there, he is absent.

8

It's like not having counsel.

9

understanding of what happens in most States.

10

If -- if it were unique, you -- you might have

trial.

11

MS. BLATT:

Right, and if you -- if we're just

12

talking -- if you take it out of the capital proceeding so

13

you don't have the split trial, all we're saying is if

14

there's an entire failure, we would think that it would be

15

appropriate to presume prejudice.

16

just not that many cases because counsel usually is

17

providing some assistance, and the claim is that the

18

assistance that was provided was ineffective for a number

19

of reasons.

20

But we won't -- there's

And that is this case.

QUESTION:

The --

sensible to draw it every place.

phases, the trial -- and it's not a mitigation stage.

24

It's a sentencing, where aggravating factors come in as

And they are discrete

Is that not so?

1

MS. BLATT:

2

QUESTION:

That's correct.
So, if one can say, yes, I see these

3

are two parts, it doesn't follow from that that I have to

4

then separate every examination and every cross

5

examination.

6

It's a question of where you draw the line.

MS. BLATT:

Well, I think that's correct, and

7

however you draw the line, this case falls on the

8

Strickland side of the line because this is not a case

9

where counsel didn't do anything.

This is a case where it

10

is just alleged that what -- the two strategic judgments

11

that counsel made were unreasonable.

12

QUESTION:

May I ask?

Supposing you had a case

13

-- and I know this is not quite it -- in which there is

14

strong evidence that counsel was mentally disabled and

15

that that made him less effective throughout the entire

16

sentencing hearing.

17

under Cronic or Strickland?

18

MS. BLATT:

19

Usually counsel's --

20
21
22

QUESTION:

Would you judge that kind of a case

It would be under Strickland.

Even if there was severe mental

illness on the part of counsel?.
MS. BLATT:

Is counsel's -- things that would go

23

to impair counsel judgments are generally irrelevant

24

unless they manifest themselves -- manifest themselves in

25

objectively unreasonable conduct.

And so if -- if counsel

26
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

is performing objectively reasonable, that counsel is no

2

different than someone who makes a mistake because --

3

QUESTION:

And you treat the failure to make a

4

closing statement or the failure to put in any evidence

5

whatsoever exactly as if he were a fully qualified lawyer

6

in such a case.

7

MS. BLATT:

That's right.

You'd look at whether

8

it's objectively reasonable, and that would be whether

9

counsel is inexperienced or had some substance abuse

10

problem.

11

Strickland.

12

Those cases are -- are all governed under

And continuing why it would be inappropriate to

13

-- to apply Cronic as opposed to Strickland to claims of

14

attorney errors, I just want to make one last point, and

15

that is that a test that would sort of say, well, if

16

counsel's performance was just not meaningful enough, that

17

this would be judicially unmanageable and would lack any

18

of the policy justifications for presuming prejudice that

19

the Court noticed in Strickland, because the Court would

20

have to look at the entire record and determine whether

21

counsel's performance was deficient enough so as to

22

warrant a presumption of prejudice.

23

QUESTION:

Do you agree that under Burger v.

24

Kemp, if the district court in this case had wanted to

25

inquire about the availability of other evidence, it was

27
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

precluded from doing so because it hadn't been introduced

2

in the State collateral proceedings?

3

MS. BLATT:

The district court ruled that that

4

-- that those claims were procedurally barred under an

5

adequate and independent State procedure.

6

Court reverses the Sixth Circuit, I think respondent would

7

be able to argue that those weren't procedurally barred on

8

remand, but those -- those claims were not considered by

9

the district court or the State court proceedings --

10

QUESTION:

Now, if the

So, it's a State procedural bar rule

11

if the evidence is not adduced at the State collateral

12

proceeding, as opposed to Federal deference?

MS. BLATT:

15

MS. BLATT:

It was a procedural -Under Burger?
In this context, the claims were not

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT L. HUTTON

MR. HUTTON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

5

The main problem in this case is not specific

7

of John Dice to make a case for life in response to the

8

State's case for death in the penalty phase of a capital

9

trial.

10
11

QUESTION:

Well, he did say something initially,

did he not, at the sentencing phase?

12
13

The problem in this case is the failure

MR. HUTTON:

Justice O'Connor, he did but I

would like to clear up one thing that Mr. Moore stated.

14

QUESTION:

Just -- I hope you will address that

15

because if he actually did something but it was somehow

16

inadequate assistance, then perhaps Strickland is the

17

test.

18

MR. HUTTON:

19

QUESTION:

Justice --

But if he did absolutely nothing,

20

then we have to wrestle with whether you divide it from,

21

you know, sentencing phase from guilt/innocence phase, and

22

so forth.

23

MR. HUTTON:

Justice O'Connor, Mr. Dice did make

24

an opening statement, but in that opening statement, he

25

also told the jury that he had a right to put on evidence

29
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

at the penalty phase and had a right to make a closing

2

argument in the penalty phase.

3

QUESTION:

And it's really bad performance, you

4

can argue, having -- especially having made that

5

statement, not to do it.

6

you can prove it was bad performance, and if you can prove

7

that it -- that -- that it adversely affected the outcome,

8

then -- then you have a case.

9

that it proves that he wasn't there.

10

MR. HUTTON:

But that's -- you know, you --

But -- but I don't think

Justice Scalia, the problem in this

11

case and the reason there's a total abdication of advocacy

12

is because after the State made a case for death, after

13

the State put on proof of aggravating circumstances and

14

then argued to the jury that the law required the jury to

15

put Mr. Cone to death, there was silence.

16

forth no countervailing proof and made no countervailing

17

argument.

18

QUESTION:

Mr. Dice put

Well, he had -- he had asked

19

questions on cross examination, and it may be that he was

20

satisfied that the State hadn't shown much.

21

MR. HUTTON:

22

QUESTION:

Justice --

And he wasn't going to give them an

23

opportunity to have some stem-winder -- and -- and this is

24

not standard but it is -- it is not an unknown strategy.

25

It used to happen in the -- in the Court of Appeals in the

He'd talk for just two or three minutes and quietly about

the law and then he'd sit down.

it on the briefs.

It was a very effective strategy for that particular

advocate.

There'd be an attorney who'd stand up.

11

MR. HUTTON:

12

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

It shows that Mr. Dice did -- did

13

something.

14

he didn't -- didn't ask for mercy.

15

of this statement where he said, "And I would say to you

16

that mercy -- if you consider life under the mitigating

17

circumstances, and the aggravating circumstances -- raises

18

you above the State, raises you above the king, if you

19

will.

20

was a pretty affecting plea for mercy.

I'm asking you about those words.

That sounds like a plea for mercy to me.

3

MR. HUTTON:

Your Honor, I think -- I would

submit that that's more of a statement of grandiosity, but

I'd like you to go into that.

exactly the same reaction as Justice Ginsburg.

I had

I didn't

10

understand why this isn't a very competent presentation,

11

let alone ineffective.

12

What's ineffective about it?

His whole case, which the jury heard the day

13

before, was that this man suffered from Vietnam Syndrome

14

and he had four psychiatrists testifying, and by the time

15

you finish reading the excerpts of it, he had a point.

16

And his point was that the personality of the defendant

17

changed totally after he went to Vietnam, which drove him

18

to drugs, which led to this killing, to the point where he

19

was irresponsible and couldn't be held legally responsible

20

for the death.

21

Now, the jury the day before has heard all that.

22

Out of a two-hour presentation on the death penalty part,

23

he -- 15 minutes of it is taken up by him going back over

24

that.

behavior after he returned from Vietnam, leads the defense

anything?

The prosecution just made his case for him.
Now, I'm telling you my reaction after reading

it, so that I can get your response.

two points in response.

In other words, you're saying on that

part --

14

MR. HUTTON:

15

-- that when Paul Freund sometimes

were irrelevant to those.

2

Now, my question to you is, why does he have to

3

come back and make a statement that he knows will elicit

4

an answer?

5

MR. HUTTON:

Number one, Your Honor, it's not

6

just the failure to make a statement.

7

put -- to make a statement and put on proof.

8

phase proof was not sufficient for a couple of reasons.

9

It's the failure to
The guilt

The first reason it wasn't sufficient is

10

because, number one, the jury -- it was never explained to

11

the jury that evidence that they had just rejected for an

12

insanity defense could, nonetheless, be mitigating

13

evidence.

14
15
16

Number two, there was a problem in this record
that the State post-conviction -QUESTION:

Excuse me.

Before you go on to

17

number two, didn't -- didn't he make that clear to the

18

jury in his -- in his opening statement in the -- in the

19

penalty phase?

20

MR. HUTTON:

No, Your Honor.

He never explained

21

to the jury.

22

would be a jury instruction that they could consider any

23

evidence of aggravating circumstances or mitigating

24

circumstances raised by the evidence.

25

explained to the jury, though, that evidence that they had

What he explained to the jury was there

It was never

rejected for an insanity defense could, nevertheless, be

2

used for mitigating evidence in the penalty phase.

3
4

QUESTION:

And he did not allude to that

evidence?

5

MR. HUTTON:

No, Your Honor.

He alluded to the

6

evidence, but he did not allude to the fact that they

7

could consider -- he did not explain to the jury that they

8

could consider that evidence for mitigating evidence.

9
10

QUESTION:

Well, but surely the jury would

assume that they could consider it if he referred to it.

11

MR. HUTTON:

Your Honor, for a jury who's just

12

rejected an insanity defense -- and this will -- Justice

13

Scalia, this plays into the second point, too.

14

was --

15

QUESTION:

What about this statement?

There

He says,

16

the defense has put on proof of those mitigating

17

circumstances during its case.

18

those for you.

19

testimony that the psychiatrists had given the day before.

20

What's that, but to present to the jury the mitigating

21

evidence that took place the day before?

22

Now I'd like to review

And at that point, he goes back over the

MR. HUTTON:

Justice Breyer, the -- the problem

23

with that evidence was that the post-conviction court made

24

a finding there was prosecutorial misconduct where the

25

prosecution improperly argued that the jury should not

36
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

believe the evidence with respect to drug usage.

2

on page 81 of the joint appendix.

3

That's

There was a finding that the lawyer for the State in

4

the closing argument said, Gary Cone is a drug dealer.

5

You can find that because of the evidence of the money in

6

the car.

7

should not have argued that because they knew the money

8

came from a robbery.

9

The State court on post-conviction said they

But the problem was that even though that didn't

10

raise to a substantive claim for relief, it nonetheless

11

tainted the evidence for mitigation evidence because the

12

prosecution's misstatements led the jury to believe, oh,

13

he was not a drug user, he was a drug dealer.

14

never cleared that up in the sentencing phase.

Mr. Dice

QUESTION:

17

my question and I colored the facts against you.

All right.

18

MR. HUTTON:

You were cut off.

I asked

Yes.

Because I want to elicit from you

what your response is.

22

Can you go to -- I don't

MR. HUTTON:

And I've got your first, and now I

The second response is a temporal

23

response, Justice Breyer, that in a weighing State, when a

24

jury is told they have to weigh the evidence for life, a

25

life sentence versus the evidence for death, for the

37
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

lawyer, after the State makes a case for life, to put

2

forth no affirmative proof, and then when the State argues

3

to the jury why the evidence that just mounted a case for

4

death necessitates under the law a sentence of death, to

5

fail to respond with argument as well is an abdication of

6

advocacy.

7

QUESTION:

Well, you know, I have trouble with

8

that because I don't think the State put on very much, and

9

if I'm sitting waiting for this closing argument, I know

10

what I'm going to hear.

15

terrified to have the jury hear, and the State is waiting

16

for closing argument, and he prevents that by sitting

17

down.

18

This is a brutal crime spree

But he goes

He murders an elderly,

That's the kind of thing that I'd be

That may be a good strategy.
MR. HUTTON:

Justice Kennedy, the problem is

19

when there is no -- there was no strategy, because after

20

the opening statements -- it's just like another trial

21

where you have opening statements, argument, and closing.

22

After the opening statements, there was nothing that was

24

life could have been made about his being awarded with the

25

Bronze Star for heroic combat in Vietnam.

He failed to make a case for life when cases for

Even though

1

there was an elicit -- it was elicited on page 31 of the

2

joint appendix in cross examination, that there was a

Bronze Star --

4

QUESTION:

But then the prosecutor says, this

5

man with a Bronze Star killed a helpless, innocent couple.

6

Is this a hero?

He avoids all of that.

MR. HUTTON:

8

the jury has something to weigh.

But Justice Kennedy, at least then
There's not the problem

QUESTION:

All right.

So, what I -- I think

maybe some of us are worried about the same thing.

this case if Mr. Dice was following the strategy that my

question suggested, it didn't work, did it?

In

opinion that says to a defense lawyer in a future death

20

case, even though your best judgment is to keep quiet at

this moment, nonetheless the Supreme Court of the United

22

States has said you have to get up and say something, with

the consequence that the jury comes back death?

do about that in your opinion?

25

MR. HUTTON:

So, how can I write an

What do I

Justice Breyer, put another way,

39
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the question the Court is asking is whether or not a

2

lawyer can strategically decide to abandon advocacy.

3

QUESTION:

All he has abandoned is his closing

4

statement.

5

his opening statement.

6

statement.

7

that.

8
9

He put all the thing in front of the jury in
So, he's abandoning his closing

Now, you want me to say that he cannot abandon

MR. HUTTON:

No, Justice Breyer.

It's the -- a

combination of abandoning the closing statement and any

10

case for life, any affirmative case which leads to there

11

being no case for life in response to the State's case for

12

death.

13

QUESTION:

No, but Mr. Hutton, the problem that

14

I think we're all having with your argument is -- is

15

illustrated by the -- the colloquy that keeps going on.

16

You're saying that in these circumstances the deficiency

17

was so clear that it should be treated as a Cronic case,

18

as if the lawyer were not there at all.

19

that we're having the discussion that we are shows that it

20

isn't so clear.

21

But the very fact

And -- and the point that I wish you'd address

22

-- and I -- I have to say that I don't know how you can

23

address it, but the point that you've got to address if --

24

if you're -- if you're going to prevail here is how can we

25

apply Cronic if we are to apply in -- in any intelligible

40
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

way, in any way that has a limiting principle to it, if

2

the application of Cronic is going to depend on

3

assessments of lawyers' judgments which are as disputable

4

as this assessment?

5

MR. HUTTON:

Justice Souter, it's our position

6

that, in essence, the lawyer's judgments are irrelevant to

7

a Cronic analysis, that Cronic looks at the structure --

8

QUESTION:

Well, that's the whole problem,

9

because if we were analyzing it under Strickland, we would

10

have a different sort of inquiry, and maybe it fits better

11

here.

12

Let me ask you this, Mr. Hutton.

Suppose we

13

disagree with you and with the Sixth Circuit that Cronic

14

is the test.

15

Taylor issue under section 2254, and then this

16

Strickland/Cronic.

Suppose we think that Strickland

17

provides the test.

That isn't the end of the road for

18

your client, presumably?

We have two questions here: the Williams v.

19

MR. HUTTON:

20

QUESTION:

No, Justice O'Connor.

What would happen then?

21

should we address it with these two questions?

22

with 2254 first as a threshold question?

23
24
25

MR. HUTTON:

And how
Do we deal

Justice O'Connor, if I could take

both of your questions in the order you presented them.
First of all, if this Court determines that

41
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Strickland applies, the case would have to be remanded to

2

the Sixth Circuit.

hearing to develop many of these facts in the district

4

court, which was denied.

5

addressed the issues about the failure to afford a -- an

6

evidentiary hearing and many State procedural default

7

issues that were raised that concern a novel

8

interpretation of State law being raised in Mr. Cone's own

9

case, and whether there were adequate and independent

10
11

We had requested an evidentiary

The Sixth Circuit never

State grounds.
QUESTION:

You know, it's -- it puts you in a

12

bad position for me to ask you this, but just assume, if

13

you would for a minute, that we think Strickland applies.

14

Then what should we do here in the face of these two

15

questions, and where does that leave your client?

16

MR. HUTTON:

Justice O'Connor, the -- if

17

Strickland did apply, the 2254(d) question could not be

18

resolved until first the procedural default issues and the

19

failure to afford an evidentiary hearing questions are

20

resolved by the Sixth Circuit.

21

QUESTION:

22
23

Why do we not decide the -- the

Strickland question here?
MR. HUTTON:

Chief Justice, there are several

24

issues that -- that of -- that were not developed in the

25

district court with respect to deficient performance and

42
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

prejudice.

Those facts would have -- would have to be

2

developed before this Court could make a determination of

3

whether or not the State court unreasonably applied

4

clearly established Federal law.

5

QUESTION:

What were those --

6

QUESTION:

Were these questions dealing with the

7
8
9
10
11

guilt phase or the penalty phase?
MR. HUTTON:

Your Honor, these are all questions

that apply to application of Sixth Amendment, the failure
to develop evidence -QUESTION:

I -- I asked you a specific question.

12

Were these questions devoted to the penalty phase or the

13

guilt phase?

14

MR. HUTTON:

With respect to the penalty phase

15

specifically, Chief Justice Rehnquist, with respect to

16

developing proof as to deficient performance, why the

17

findings of fact should not be trusted because --

18
19
20

QUESTION:

Mr. Hutton, didn't the Sixth Circuit

reject your claim about the guilt phase?
MR. HUTTON:

No -- what they rejected, there was

21

an issue of waiver of certain claims, not the Sixth

22

Amendment claims, but other claims that was denied by the

23

district court, and the Sixth Circuit found that those

24

issues were waived.

25

With respect to the ineffective assistance

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

claims, the issue has to do with in State court there was

2

a finding that those claim -- that those aspects of the

3

Sixth Amendment claim were previously determined, and in,

4

this case is the first time that the State court held a

5

finding of previous determination can act as a procedural

6

bar to developing those issues in -- in State court.

7

there's a novel issue of State law that --

8
9

QUESTION:

So,

Can you -- can you point to me where

in the Sixth Circuit opinion -- I thought in their opinion

10

they rejected your claim insofar as the guilt phase.

11

Perhaps I'm wrong.

12

MR. HUTTON:

No, Justice Ginsburg.

They

13

rejected the issue of waiver.

14

in the opinion the claim in the brief with respect to why

15

the State court finding of previous determination with

16

respect to aspects of a Sixth Amendment claim raised in

17

the subsequent State post-conviction petition -- why we

18

argued that that cannot be a bar to reaching the issues on

19

the merits in Federal court because it was a novel rule.

20

It was a rule announced for the first time in Mr. Cone's

21

own case.

They did not address at all

22

Secondly, there are Michael Williams v. Taylor

23

problems because there are facts -- when we asked for an

24

evidentiary hearing, we were not afforded an evidentiary

25

hearing to develop many of these facts with respect to the

44
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Bronze Star.

2

And we have cause.

3

develop those in -- in State court.

4

The district court didn't give us a hearing.

QUESTION:

It wasn't our fault for failing to

Excuse me.

I -- I don't -- I don't

5

really understand.

6

is going to be whether the -- as the statute says, whether

7

the State court was reasonable in what it did, what right

8

do you have to introduce new evidence that wasn't

9

presented to the State courts?

If the test -- if the criterion is --

10

MR. HUTTON:

11

QUESTION:

Because --

I don't understand why we can't just

12

-- just look at the evidence that was available and -- and

13

decide the Strickland question then.

14

MR. HUTTON:

Justice Scalia, that fits right

15

into this court's decision with Michael Williams v.

16

Taylor.

17

in Federal court if it was not the defendant's fault for

18

failing to develop facts.

19

sense if a Federal court couldn't look at new facts not

20

developed in State court to make a determination under

21

2254(d) as to whether or not the State court findings were

22

reasonable or unreasonable.

2254(e) allows an evidentiary hearing to be held

23

QUESTION:

24

whose fault it was?

25

That provision would make no

In other words, Justice --

Do we have any indication here as to

MR. HUTTON:

6

First of all, in State

So, there's an issue about

Number two, with the aspects of the Sixth

7

Amendment claim raised in a second post-conviction

8

petition, there are issues as to whether the State

9

procedural bar was clearly established, because Mr. Cone's

10

case was the very first case where there was a holding

11

that previous determination acted as a State bar to

12

developing facts in State court.

to whether or not Mr. Cone has a right under Michael

4

QUESTION:

well, why -- how does that bear on

5

whether or not the State court's finding of -- against you

6

on the Strickland claim was unreasonable?

7

MR. HUTTON:

Because, Chief Justice, many of the

8

findings by the State court relied on the testimony of

9

John Dice, and just like under the old Townsend v. Sain --

10
11
12

QUESTION:

Well, Townsend against Sain is pretty

well gone.
MR. HUTTON:

No, Your Honor, but it also comes

13

into Michael Williams v. Taylor, this Court's 2000 term --

14

year 2000 opinion, where if it's not -- if we didn't fail

15

to develop facts in -- in State court that are relevant,

16

we can develop them in Federal court.

17

QUESTION:

What is -- what is the particular

18

thing, though, because I mean, you've mentioned three

19

times now that he has some mental problem that led him to

20

commit suicide.

21

MR. HUTTON:

QUESTION:

23

Yes.

I gather that must have been at least

four or five years after these events.

MR. HUTTON:

That's correct.

Now, I've seen many bad

cases of bad representation in death cases that I think is

terrible.

7

obviously think it is.

8

But I have to say, having read through this

So, what is it specifically?

Now, you

What is it

specifically that -- that you think was absolutely

10

terrible by way of representation here, other than not

11

making the closing statement?

12

understand that.

13

what are the things that really went wrong in this case?

14

I've got that one.

I

You've made a major point of that.

MR. HUTTON:

But

Justice Breyer, with respect to

15

your first question, we're raising the fact that he

16

committed suicide after the post-conviction testimony so

17

that -- that raises --

QUESTION:

That does not suggest that four or

19

five years earlier -- it might suggest a cause of bad

representation, but it doesn't suggest there was the bad

representation.

MR. HUTTON:

Justice Breyer, he failed to make a

case for life.

3

it's like a totally new trial, and a lawyer has one goal.

4

It's to mount a case for life, for the jury to have some

5

reason not to sentence his client to death.

In the penalty phase of a capital trial,

just read to you that they did, and that's a closed door,

2

and the only thing that's up now is the sentencing phase.

3

MR. HUTTON:

Oh, I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg.

4

must have misunderstood your question.

5

conviction of guilt was affirmed by the Sixth Circuit and

6

we did not file a cross petition.

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. HUTTON:

9

The -- the

Yes.
Okay.

The -- so, the issues which

we are raising have to do with why Mr. Dice was

10

ineffective to the point that it amounted to a total

11

abdication of advocacy in the penalty phase of the

12

capital --

13

QUESTION:

Mr. --

14

QUESTION:

Is the first --

15

QUESTION:

Can I ask you one question following

16

up on Justice Souter?

17

that you argue he failed to put in.

18

most significant material that was omitted was the story

19

of what kind of a person this man was before he went to

20

Vietnam, which the lawyer said he had investigated and

21

described in detail at page 62 of the joint appendix.

22

Now, did he explain why he didn't put all that evidence

23

in?

24
25

MR. HUTTON:

He listed three things.

No.

He said

But I thought the

Your Honor, there were some

references by Mr. Dice's testimony that he thought that

the mother, Valeree Cone, did not make a good witness and

2

that generally the family members he thought did not make

3

a good witness.

4

QUESTION:

Did that come during the -- had that

5

come in during the guilt stage?

6

MR. HUTTON:

Your Honor, he -- when he tried to

7

introduce evidence in the guilt phase, there were

8

objections as to relevancy which were sustained by the

9

court, because the court found that all that was relevant

10

in the guilt phase was the issue of mental insanity.

11

all the background to -- was not relevant in that

12

particular --

So,

QUESTION:

Did the mother testify --

QUESTION:

Mr. Hutton, you -- you think we have

15

to send -- this conviction and sentence occurred in 1982.

16

I am trying to think, you know, what I was like in 1982.

17

It's 20 years ago, and you think it has to go back for

18

further fact finding, presumably back to the court of

19

appeals and then back to the district court?

Your Honor, first of all, this case

Mr. Cone was 33 in 1982, so that

Yes.

Well, he may get a -- a life

sentence by default.

2

MR. HUTTON:

Justice Scalia, the -- the fact of

3

the matter is, though, that Mr. Cone has been trying to

4

develop these claims.

5

QUESTION:

No, but when you go back to that,

6

what is it that you -- that you say should have gone on in

7

as evidence at the sentencing phase that didn't?

8

Bronze Star.

Justice Stevens mentioned the change in

9

personality.

Is that something that you say should have

The

11

MR. HUTTON:

Your Honor, that should have gone

12

in.

13

what happened in the war should have gone in.

14

claims about Mr. Dice's --

The fact about the Bronze Star and being developed

QUESTION:

There are

I mentioned, the -- the death of the sister and the murder

MR. HUTTON:

I'm pushing you because your

What else?

Is there anything else?

Your Honor, those should have gone

24

in, but more importantly, those should have been woven

25

into an argument as to why that reasoned moral judgment --

53
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

a reasoned moral judgment called for this man not to be

2

put to death.

3

combination -- we can't piecemeal the no evidence and no

4

argument.

5

failure to do anything in response to the State's case for

6

death is what makes this a total abdication of advocacy in

7

the context of a penalty phase of a capital trial.

8
9

And the fact of the matter is the

It's the combined force of both of them.

The

So, Your Honors, in preparing for this argument,
I read an article that one of Your Honors wrote several

10

years ago about how important oral argument was before

11

this Court and how in many cases this Court -- argument

12

had affected the minds of members of this Court.

13

oral argument is so important for members of this Court

14

who have the benefits of briefs, training, legal training,

15

the benefits of clerks, how much more important is

16

argument for a jury that's not trained in the law, that

17

doesn't have the benefits of briefs, that has to make the

18

most difficult decision they ever made as to whether

19

somebody should live or should die?

20

devastating is it when the jury is told they have to weigh

21

evidence, they hear a case for death, they hear the

22

prosecutor argue a case for death, and then there's

23

silence from the defense?

24
25

And if

And how much more

Your Honor, that amounts to a total failure in
the penalty phase to -- to subject the prosecution's case

to meaningful adversarial testing.

wrote Cronic, to talk about problems just like this case.

And Cronic has been sparingly applied by the lower courts.

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Thank you,

Mr. Hutton.
