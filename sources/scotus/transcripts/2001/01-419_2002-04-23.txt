ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY S. SUTTON

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. SUTTON:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

May

it please the Court:

11

The question presented in this case is whether

12

Congress in 1994 divested the States of their traditional

13

authority to delegate police powers over local safety

14

matters to their political subdivisions.

15

small matter for Congress to impose such a restriction on

16

the States, and we submit they did no such thing in this

17

instance.

It would be no

18

In making that point, it may be helpful to look

19

at the text of the statute, which is reprinted in full in

20

the appendix to our brief, the blue brief.

21

of that appendix specifically repeats the language of

22

(c)(2)(A), the operative provision at issue here.

23

And page A-2

And our first point, as a matter of the language

24

of the statute, is that Congress specifically said that

25

the preemption provision, quote, "shall not restrict the
3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

safety regulatory authority of a State."

2

Now, prior to 1994, Ohio, the State of Ohio, had

3

exercised regulatory authority in this area by delegating

4

its power specifically over tow truck regulations to local

5

political subdivisions.

6

understand how the court of appeals interpretation does

7

not in fact, quote, "restrict the safety regulatory

8

authority of a State."

9

QUESTION:

It's very difficult for us to

That's --

Well, I think the argument on the

10

other side, Mr. Sutton, is that the first section (a)(1)

11

does say, no State or political subdivision thereof and no

12

interstate agency.

13

so that when you come down to the section you've just

14

quoted, and it only says State, there's perhaps a fair

15

inference that only a State and not a political

16

subdivision is included.

17

It talks about a political subdivision

MR. SUTTON:

Yes, Your Honor.

And the normal

18

Russello argument is that a litigant like myself is trying

19

to read into another provision a term that is specifically

20

mentioned elsewhere in the statute.

21

is that we're trying to read the term, political

22

subdivision, into (c)(2)(A).

23

to do.

24
25

Here the suggestion

That's not what we're trying

What we're saying is the traditional safety
regulatory authority of a State was preserved by (c)(2)(A)
4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

and traditionally States, including Ohio, had specifically

2

exercised that authority by delegating it in some

3

instances to State executive branch agencies and in other

4

instances, specifically here, to political subdivisions.

5

QUESTION:

Would your argument be the same if

6

the State had not made a specific delegation?

7

a specific delegation with respect to tow trucks?

8
9

MR. SUTTON:

Did it make

Actually it did, although it's --

it's backwards, in the sense that they generally regulate

10

all motor carriers at the State level, but they exempted

11

tow trucks, therefore allowing political subdivisions like

12

Columbus to enact their own tow truck ordinances.

13

fact, in this case it would be specific, although I

14

wouldn't say our argument rests on that point.

15

States like Ohio are home rule States, which in their

16

constitutions give general grants to political

17

subdivisions to have powers of local self-government.

18

in this case, I -- I would say it's a little easier

19

because there was something specific as to tow trucks, but

20

I wouldn't say that our argument rests on that point.

21

QUESTION:

So, in

Many

So,

Mr. Sutton, would -- would you look a

22

little further down in, in the provision set forth in the

23

appendix to your brief?

24

reading from (c)(2)(A) --

25

MR. SUTTON:

Look on page A-3.

You were

Yes, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

-- in which it says, shall not

2

restrict the safety regulatory authority of a State.

3

you say that includes, you know, political subdivisions of

4

a State.

5
6
7
8

10

MR. SUTTON:

No.

And

That it includes the right to

delegate political subdivisions.
QUESTION:

All right.

Okay.

Just read two --

two lines later, (2)(C) where it says, does not apply.
MR. SUTTON:
QUESTION:

Right.
Again, it uses the same -- shall not

11

restrict, does not apply to the authority of a State, or a

12

political subdivision of a State, to enact or enforce a

13

law, regulation, or other provision.

14

provision does it say does not apply to a State or a

15

political subdivision?

16

you say State, it includes whatever authority the State

17

has to delegate to a political subdivision.

18

MR. SUTTON:

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. SUTTON:

21

QUESTION:

22
23

Why in that

Because you're telling us, when

We're not saying -You wouldn't have -We're not --- you wouldn't have needed that

language there.
MR. SUTTON:

We're not saying States are

24

political subdivisions.

We're simply saying the

25

preservation of a State, deregulatory authority of a State

includes the power to delegate.

2

But as to (c)(2)(C), keep in mind that was a

3

1995 amendment.

4

legislation.

5

Congress's --

That was not part of the original

So, the suggestion would be that

QUESTION:

7

MR. SUTTON:

8

act.

Well --- style in 1995 modified the 1994

And no one is arguing --

9

QUESTION:

I think we always look at an act in

10

toto and -- and don't try to piece it apart as to what was

11

enacted when.

12

this statute as a whole.

13

It seems to me we have to make sense of

MR. SUTTON:

That's -- that's true, Your Honor.

14

But I -- in O'Gilve, the Court said specifically that a

15

later act cannot modify the terms of an earlier act.

16
17
18

But let me -- I think there's another answer
that -QUESTION:

It doesn't modify it, but it -- it

19

can give clear indication of what -- of what it meant.

20

mean, you're assuming that it modifies it.

21

MR. SUTTON:

Right.

I

Well, Your Honor, the --

22

the thing that I think may be helpful in thinking about

23

(c)(2)(C) and the other mentions of political subdivision

24

throughout 14501 is they're all in the context of --

25

context of the enact or enforce language, which is exactly
7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

how (c)(1) reads.

2

not enact or enforce these particular laws.

3

course, is not the way (c)(2)(A) or, for that matter,

4

(a)(2) -- (a)(2) does exactly the same thing.

5

preserves the safety regulatory authority of the State

6

over these various other provisions elsewhere identified

7

in title 49.

8
9

(c)(1) says these political bodies may
That, of

It

When it comes to (c)(2)(C), it's dealing with a
topic specifically mentioned in (c)(1), prices.

And it

10

follows the exact same structure of(c)(1), not

11

surprisingly, because it's dealing with a topic that is

12

covered in (c)(1).

13

(c)(2)(A) --

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Sutton, are you making the

15

distinction there between the safety regulations which

16

would be covered under (c)(2) and the economic regulation

17

which would be the main prohibition?

18

MR. SUTTON:

Exactly, Your Honor.

And there was

19

a division of authority, going back to 1966, where the old

20

ICC had regulated all of the economic issues over motor

21

carriers, and the Department of Transportation had

22

regulated all the safety issues.

23

is they're simply deregulating.

24

this area.

25

in Morales, that States wouldn't undo that particular

And what happens in 1994
The ICC is deregulating

They wanted to make sure, as this Court said

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

deregulatory effort.

But at the same time, as (c)(2)(A)

2

and (a)(2) makes clear, they wanted to preserve the

3

provisions of a separate part of title 49 dealing with

4

safety issues, something that DOT, a separate agency, had

5

always regulated.

6

help in getting to your -- your point.

And I hope, Justice Scalia, this will

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. SUTTON:

9

QUESTION:

There's a -Oh, I'm sorry.
There's a question I think that still

10

would be left open even if you prevail; that is, whether

11

these regulations are appropriately characterized as

12

economic or safety.

13

MR. SUTTON:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. SUTTON:

You say they're all safety.
Absolutely.
But that hasn't been adjudicated yet.
Absolutely.

And -- and if -- if

16

the court of appeals decision would reverse, it would

17

certainly be within the rights of respondents to go back

18

to the Sixth Circuit and say, as to some of these

19

provisions of the Columbus code, they are not in fact

20

safety ordinances or safety provisions, and therefore they

21

could be regulated as a price, route, or service.

22

But there's another, I think, important point

23

that responds to this issue of the mention of political

24

subdivisions elsewhere in 14501.

25

agreement in the case that as to (c)(2)(A), all of the

I think there is general

1

other words, every single other word in (c)(2)(A)

2

including, for example, the definition of the term safety,

3

is defined not from 1994 on by looking at the difference

4

of -- between safety and price, routes, or services

5

mentioned in (c)(1) -- in other words, you would not

6

define safety after 1994 based on its contextual

7

comparison to prices --

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. SUTTON:

10

Excuse me, Your Honor.

It's on

A-2 of our appendix, and it's -- it's labeled motor

11

carriers of property.

12

more clear.

13

Where -- where exactly is (c)(2)(A)?

Excuse me.

I should have made that

The point I was trying to make is that these

14

other terms in (c)(2)(A) I think all would agree would be

15

defined by other provisions in title 49.

16

word safety would be defined by the provisions in chapter

17

311 of title 49, which is a large -- a large section of

18

the code dealing with safety provisions.

19

within the States' rights after 1994 to suddenly start

20

reinventing new definitions of safety, new definitions of

21

hazardous materials routing restrictions or size and

22

weight routing restrictions.

of those definitions, including notably those preemption

24

provisions.

determine the meaning of all of these preserved matters by

2

reference to other parts of title 49, but you do not do so

3

when it comes to what the meaning of safety regulatory

4

authority of a State is.

5

And when you look at those other provisions of

6

title 49, it's quite clear that Congress contemplated in

7

all of them -- routing restrictions, safety -- that States

8

could delegate their power to local subdivisions.

9

not only in some of the statutory provisions, but it's in

10

That's

the regulations.

11

QUESTION:

Well, but it's not defined.

It

12

doesn't -- there's not a definition that says, State

13

includes political subdivision of a State.

MR. SUTTON:

We're not saying a State --

We're not saying -It would be a stronger argument if

that were your argument.

MR. SUTTON:

That -- that's my point.

I -- I disagree, Your Honor.

We're

22

not saying that -- Congress -- let me put it this way.

23

Congress has no right to empower a city.

create a city.

Congress can't

They can't give it a power.

That's a

It made perfect sense in (c)(2)(A)

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

to preserve the safety regulatory authority of a State

2

because it's the State legislature's job to determine what

3

other political bodies, if any, regulate in that area.

4

QUESTION:

Well, in that connection, I was going

5

to ask could this -- suppose that you do not prevail in

6

this case and we accept the respondents' interpretation.

7

Could the State then every year have a cleanup statute in

8

which it says the State hereby adopts -- or authorizes

9

cities that are no less than X number of persons, no

10

greater than Y number of persons, obviously referring to

11

the City of Columbus, that -- that the State then allows

12

specifically Columbus to regulate, that it have an

13

ordinance and it just tracks the whole ordinance?

14
15
16

18

MR. SUTTON:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

And that

we think -QUESTION:

So, then we're not arguing about very

much in your view.
MR. SUTTON:

Well, Your Honor, that would strike

19

me as an extraordinary hoop for Congress to ask the States

20

to step through.

this Court has ever construed to mean that State

cities when you get to safety regulation for trucks.

2

you give me an example of a safety regulation that a city

3

might want to have that wouldn't have a negative impact or

4

some impact on routes?

MR. SUTTON:

QUESTION:

MR. SUTTON:

Excuse me?

Can

On routes.
Right.

The -- and I think the

8

respondents' point is or suggestion is that it would be

9

quite natural for Congress to say, as to routing

10

restrictions, we want uniform laws.

11

the same throughout the State, and we don't want to bother

12

with municipalities establishing different regulations for

13

a routing restriction.

14

routing restriction is to account for differences within

15

the topography or geography of the States.

16

QUESTION:

We want them to be

Well, the -- the whole point of a

Yes, but I mean, there's a long

17

history in the ICC of trying to create, say, dynamite

23

keep the cities out of this.

Well, you can imagine what something like

So, it's not illogical that people who

It's -- it's a nightmare.

And -- and -- but I have no reason to know
whether this is so or not.

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

kind of safety regulation that doesn't get into that kind

2

of routing nightmare when you talk about cities?

3

MR. SUTTON:

Well, hazardous -- I -- I don't

4

think the general rule has been that either the Federal

5

Government or the States have been concerned about heavily

6

populated regions deciding, for example, to route

7

hazardous materials around their beltway as opposed to

8

through the middle.

9

and the cities generally, including Columbus, have been

Everyone thinks that's a good idea,

10

left in control of that kind of decision, which is

11

something obviously one doesn't need to worry about --

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. SUTTON:

But I'm looking for specifically -In a size and weight situation, of

14

course, you're going to situations where bridges or

15

particular roads in, you know, densely populated areas

16

require different rules than in rural regions of a State

17

where, for example, the roads are bigger and even if

18

they're not bigger, they're not as near to either

19

businesses or heavily populated areas.

20

QUESTION:

How about a restriction that on a

21

particular residential street that's, nonetheless, an

22

arterial highway, no trucks over 10 tons?

23

MR. SUTTON:

Could -- could a -- a -- the

24

question, first of all, would be whether that relates to

interstate commerce, and if it relates to interstate

Alderson Reporting Company

2

Department of Transportation is -- is going to very

3

heavily regulate that particular route restriction and --

4

and has authority to preempt it, even as a matter of

5

regulation.

6

that's been something that Congress or the agencies hardly

7

regulated at all, and to the extent they regulated them,

8

it was only when there was Federal funding.

QUESTION:

21

MR. SUTTON:

It would be a traffic law?
-- is something that the Department

22

of Transportation does not regulate and neither does

Congress, which to me is one more indicator that you

24

don't, after 1994, start having free-form debates about

25

what safety means.

QUESTION:

But even if the -- if it's not

federally regulated, would there, nevertheless, not be

3

preemption under their interpretation of this provision of

MR. SUTTON:

On what ground?

I mean, it would

have to be a price, route, or service for there to be

MR. SUTTON:

QUESTION:

Right.
-- it seems to me that would preempt

16

a local government's right to fix a 15-mile limit in a

17

school zone.

18

MR. SUTTON:

I understand what you're saying.

I

19

think the position they would take -- and maybe they could

20

clarify this -- is that if it's not a price, route, or

21

service, you ignore (c)(2)(A), and you simply go to the

22

rest of title 49.

23

to that.

But I'm not -- I don't know the answer

If I could make one more point, Justice Scalia,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART

19

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

Let's

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS
MR. STEWART:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The phrase, safety regulatory authority of a

24

State, in section 14501(c)(2)(A) is most naturally read to

25

encompass the State's traditional authority to delegate
17
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

its powers to political subdivisions.

2

supported by the larger statutory context in which the

3

phrase appears and by the purposes of the 1994 act.

4

That view is

As Mr. Sutton has explained and as this Court

5

has frequently recognized, one integral component of the

6

State's ability to regulate within its borders is to

7

delegate as much or as little power as it wishes to

8

subordinate political units.

9

QUESTION:

We understand all that, of course.

10

And -- and in isolation, that phrase most naturally would

11

-- would mean safety regulatory authority of a State,

12

including, of course, its ability to delegate it to

13

municipalities.

14

But what is sticking in our craw is the fact

15

that elsewhere in the statute, the language is very

16

careful to distinguish between the authority of a State,

17

on the one hand, and the -- and the separate authority of

18

political subdivisions of the State.

19

your explanation for those other separations?

20
21
22

MR. STEWART:

Now, what -- what is

I guess there are about three

responses we would make.
The first is, as Mr. Sutton points out, this is

23

not a case in which the other provisions are identical but

24

for the inclusion of the word political subdivision.

25

instance, in subsection (c)(2)(C), which is at the -- the
18
Alderson Reporting Company

For

1

top of A-3 of the --

2

QUESTION:

Right.

3

MR. STEWART:

-- petitioners' brief, it refers

4

to the authority of a State or a political subdivision of

5

a State to enact or enforce a law.

6

delegating power to municipalities is an integral feature

7

of the State's regulatory authority, it would certainly be

8

less than clear that when a municipality enacted or

9

enforced a law, pursuant to such delegation, it could not

Now, even though

10

necessarily be said that the State had enacted or enforced

11

that law.

12

And so, if the provision left out political

13

subdivisions and simply said that the preemption rule does

14

not apply to the authority of a State to enact or enforce

15

a law, there would be ambiguity, and Congress -- whether

16

it was necessary or not, Congress might rationally choose

17

to eliminate that potential ambiguity through an express

18

reference to political subdivision.

19

But the phrase that appears in subsection (2)(A)

20

is simply safety regulatory authority of a State, and

21

that, as you say, would most naturally be construed to

22

encompass the authority to delegate power to

23

municipalities.

24
25

The second point is that based on the country's
traditions, it would certainly be an unusual thing for
19
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Congress to interfere with the States' decisions as to the

2

amount of power that should be delegated to subordinate

3

political units.

4

QUESTION:

Has there been any -- what's the

5

closest case respondents could cite to show a contrary

6

practice?

7

MR. STEWART:

I believe the respondents have

8

cited a couple of court of appeals cases which have

9

held --

10

QUESTION:

From this Court?

11

MR. STEWART:

None from this Court.

The -- the

12

respondents have not cited any case in which this Court

13

has held that any Federal statute had the effect of

14

divesting a State of its authority to delegate power to

15

political subdivisions.

16

QUESTION:

Well, there are many Federal statutes

17

that -- that make grants to municipalities for various

18

functions and don't make it to the State.

19

certainly the Federal Government interfering in the

20

relationship between the State and its municipalities.

21

And the State has no -- no ability to veto whether the

22

municipality is going to accept those funds or not.

23

there's -- there's been a lot of controversy within the

24

States between the municipalities and the State government

25

as to -- as to what money should be accepted and so forth.

This is a --

20
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

And

1

It seems to me that has exactly the same effect as what

2

you're talking about here.

3

indeed, indeed, intervened in the relationship between the

4

State and its -- and its political subdivisions.

5

MR. STEWART:

The Federal Government has,

We cited the Lee Deadwood case in

6

our brief as support for the proposition that Congress

7

would constitutionally be authorized to preempt municipal

8

law without preempting State law if it chose.

9

point is it would be sufficiently unusual that we would

10

Our only

expect Congress to address the matter fairly directly.

11

QUESTION:

Mr. Stewart, would you be able to

12

give us any examples of municipal safety regulations that

13

are preempted by this section as it's been interpreted

14

below?

15
16

MR. STEWART:

We -- I think that as it's been

interpreted --

17

QUESTION:

As a practical matter?

18

MR. STEWART:

As it's been interpreted below, I

19

believe the types of regulations that have been held

20

preempted are -- are fairly similar to the City of

21

Columbus's regulation, namely, a licensing scheme in which

22

the vehicle is inspected, the driver is tested to ensure

23

proficiency in the operation of the vehicle.

24

have been held to be preempted on the ground that they

25

relate to routes --

And those

2

QUESTION:

So, we're really talking about

licensing schemes.

3

Is this anything that the State couldn't

4

undertake to do itself with its State driver's license and

5

so forth?

6

MR. STEWART:

I -- I think that the licensing

7

scheme, while we would respect Ohio's decision to delegate

8

that to municipalities, it -- in truth I think this is

9

something that could fairly realistically be accomplished

10
11

at the State level.
Now, with respect to some of the other matters

12

that are specified in (c)(2)(A), for instance, route

13

controls based on size and weight or hazardous nature of

14

the cargo, because the determination at issue is whether a

15

particular vehicle or a particular cargo is suitable for a

16

particular stretch of road, those are the sorts of things

17

that can't realistically be expected to be done in their

18

entirety at the State level.

19

particular disruption of the State's processes --

20

QUESTION:

And therefore, it would be a

Mr. Stewart, before your time goes

21

out, will you give us your third point too?

22

the first two.

23

MR. STEWART:

You gave us

The third point is that to the

24

extent that the provision at issue here is ambiguous and

25

the Court wants to interpret it by reference to other

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

relevant statutory provisions, it is important to examine

2

the larger statutory context.

3

limited to safety.

4

as Mr. Sutton was pointing out, the other matters are

5

covered in detail in different provisions of title 49.

6

general, those other provisions of title 49 contain their

7

own preemption provisions.

8

length what States can and can't do.

9

of safety, State law is specifically defined to include

That is, (c)(2)(A) is not

It specifies these other matters, and

In

They explain at -- at great
At least in the area

10

the law of the local governmental unit, and so the -- the

11

safety regime in the other parts of title 49 specifically

12

contemplates municipal safety regulation.

13

odd to think that Congress, in this oblique way, has

14

superseded that carefully developed statutory framework.

And it would be

15

And to put this in larger historical context, to

16

follow up on Mr. Sutton's point, from 1966 to 1995, at the

17

Federal level there was division of regulatory authority

18

between the ICC which did economic regulation and the

19

Department of Transportation which did safety regulation.

20

And it's no coincidence that State law as to economic

21

matters was preempted at about the same time that the ICC

22

saw its powers diminished and the ICC was eventually

23

eliminated altogether.

24

of deregulating the economics of commercial trucking.

25

But --

This was part of a larger program

QUESTION:

Who -- who administers this statute?

2

Is there a Federal agency that -- that can be said to be

3

administering this -- this statute?

4

MR. STEWART:

There -- there is no Federal

5

agency entrusted with the administration of this

6

particular statute.

7

administers the related provisions of title 49 that are

8

specifically addressed to these matters, and their

9

implementation of their responsibilities under those

The Department of Transportation

10

provisions would be affected by this Court's decision in

11

this case because if there is no municipal safety

12

regulation at all, that would obviously have an impact on

municipal regulation is and is not permitted.

But they

So -- so to return to the point about the

18

division of responsibilities, Congress eliminated the ICC,

19

eliminated Federal economic regulation of commercial

20

trucking, and at the same time it preempted State law in

21

order to ensure that the States didn't undo the Federal

22

deregulatory efforts.

deregulation in matters of trucking safety.

has been divided between the Federal, State, and local

governments.

QUESTION:

May I ask this question on the

division of responsibility?

Is it your view -- your

understanding that the cities would not be able in their

licensing scheme to regulate the rates that the truckers

11

charge?

12

MR. STEWART:

13

If there are no further questions, I have

14
15

That's correct.

nothing further.
QUESTION:

To what extent, Mr. Stewart, does the

16

Department of Transportation -- you said there's no

17

administrator of the statute, but they do have authority

18

under the motor safety -- motor carrier safety assistance

19

program that seems to be relevant.

20

MR. STEWART:

The motor carrier safety

assistance program, and they also have authority under

22

other provisions of title 49 to review and declare to be

23

preempted State and local laws -- State and local safety

24

laws that apply to transportation in interstate commerce.

Thank you, Mr. Stewart.

QUESTION:

Mr. Cordray, I hope you'll tell us

the practical effects of the decision below.

10

MR. CORDRAY:

The practical effect of the

11

decision below, as you uncovered it in your questioning

12

earlier, is that Federal law preempts municipalities and

13

other local governments from imposing their own individual

licensing schemes upon motor carriers of property and that

the other matters addressed in (c)(2)(A), would be

2

which is deregulate it nationwide and create an unfettered

3

free market for trucking and transportation services.

4

QUESTION:

So that if a city says no trucks

5

through the park with the public playground between

6

certain hours, that has to be the -- the State?

7

the only one that could do that?

8

MR. CORDRAY:

9

That's

That could be done at the State

level and it could be done either by going to the State

10

legislature, as you suggested, or it could be done by

11

setting up a very simple administrative scheme at the

12

State level where you would go to the State department --

13

QUESTION:

Well, why would --

14

QUESTION:

Well, most cities I've been in had --

15

QUESTION:

-- why would Congress choose to -- to

16

regulate in that way, say we want the State to do it but

17

not the locality?

MR. CORDRAY:

Specifically because they were

19

trying to deregulate this market nationwide.

22

QUESTION:

No.

To leave in

I'm not talking about licensing.

23

I'm talking about the -- the example of, say, that no

24

trucks over 10 tons on this particular road.

25

MR. CORDRAY:

Again, I think that petitioners
27

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

agree and all the courts have agreed that every subsection

2

of (c)(2)(A) has to be read together, and to the extent

3

municipal authority is being preempted in one respect,

4

it's being preempted in all.

5

Congress was recognizing that schemes directed

6

specifically to motor carriers of property at the local

7

level simply incorporated too much regulation that would

8

interfere with and impede a free market for transportation

9

services and motor carriers --

10

QUESTION:

And the reason is that

May I ask a similar question?

11

Supposing that there's a heavy rain storm in a city or

12

something and it becomes unsafe to use a certain street if

13

the truck is over a certain size.

would not be permitted to divert the traffic around that

15

particular flooded area, I suppose.

16

MR. CORDRAY:

Certainly they could.

This goes

17

to your question you asked earlier which is whether

traffic laws, ordinary, general traffic laws, would be

No.

MR. CORDRAY:

They figure it's -- it's dangerous

because the thing is too deep and the trucks have to over-

MR. CORDRAY:

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

2

QUESTION:

It would be preempted, I guess.

3

MR. CORDRAY:

They would be -- no.

They would

be diverting presumably all traffic that's heavy enough to

5

create a safety problem.

6

QUESTION:

Supposing -- truck size traffic, yes.

7

MR. CORDRAY:

Yes, but -- but it's not directed

8

simply to motor carriers of property.

9

all trucks, all oversize vehicles.

It's directed to

It could be private

10

vehicles, RVs that people use to take vacations, whatever

11

it might be.

12

That would be permissible.

And traffic laws, I want to stress, are not

13

preempted by this statute.

14

As this Court has --

15

QUESTION:

This statute is not limitless.

Well, then what about the -- the

16

answer that you gave earlier to the question that the

17

Chief Justice and I had?

18

playground or -- or through a residential neighborhood at

19

a certain time.

20

preempted, but now you're saying it applies only if

21

they're motor carriers of property?

22

No -- no trucks through the

I thought you said that would be

MR. CORDRAY:

Let me step back.

If the

23

ordinance related to all oversize vehicles -- that would

24

be a general traffic regulation -- that would be

25

permissible.

And I'll -- and I'll get to that in a
29

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

moment, why traffic laws are not preempted by the statute.

2

They -- they are not related to price, route, or service

3

of motor carriers of property.

4

If it was directed specifically to a type of

5

motor carrier of property, as this licensing scheme is --

6

it applies directly, specifically, and only to tow trucks

7

-- that would be a different matter.

8

not permitted to do that, and Congress specifically wanted

9

to do that because although there was a tradition of lots

Municipalities are

10

of regulation at the State and local level, Congress was

11

making a policy decision, as it's free to do, to say that

all of that is impeding a free market for transportation

services and motor carriers that's affecting broad

14

segments of the American economy.

15

costs, rid us of these inefficiencies --

16

QUESTION:

We want to bring down

I understand that, but I'm at the

17

same question that I think everyone has asked.

In my mind

18

-- and I might be misremembering -- there are lots of

19

streets -- there used to be in San Francisco and you'd see

20

a sign, and it would say, no trucks over 3-and-a-half

21

tons.

22

signs.

23

such.

24

And my impression is that in many cities there are many

25

such streets, and which streets there are is a matter for

And it seems to me in Boston I can think of seeing
I thought maybe they said, no trucks over such and
Maybe they just say no vehicle over such and such.

2

and typically it's in residential areas.

3

of local regulation of that kind.

4

And it's a shifting pattern,
And there's lots

That's my impression.

And I want to know, on your reading of this

5

statute, does this change when I'm thinking of those signs

6

on one street after another?

7

they're preempted, and now each neighborhood has to go to

8

Sacramento, if they're in California, and convince the --

9

the legislature?

Does that all change because

I'd be very surprised if that is so,

10

that Congress changed so well established a municipal

11

pattern of behavior without saying anything about it.

12

therefore, I think everyone is driving at the same

13

question.

14

I want to know the answer to that question.

15

And

I understand about all the licensing stuff, but

MR. CORDRAY:

All right.

Again, it's not what's

16

specifically at issue in this case, but I understand the

17

Court wants the answer to the hypothetical.

Absolutely.

It has nothing to do with this case.

19

I'm saying when your -- accept the fact that if I accept

1

MR. CORDRAY:

It could be dealt with either of

2

two ways, Your Honor.

3

general traffic law, like a one-way street, like a speed

4

limit, and the like, in which case we believe that it

5

would not come within the preemption clause ex ante

6

because it has to have a connection with or reference to

7

motor carriers of property to come within the terms of

8

this preemption clause --

9
10

QUESTION:

Motor carriers of property or just

motor carriers?

11
12

Either it could be regarded as a

MR. CORDRAY:

Motor carriers of property which

is what --

13

QUESTION:

In other words, if they -- if they

14

don't say on the street motor carriers of property cannot

15

use this, then it's not preempted.

16

MR. CORDRAY:

Then it is a general traffic

17

regulation no different from where the speed limit says 55

18

miles per hour and trucks have to obey it, just as cars

19

do.

20

And motor carriers -QUESTION:

Well, does the term, motor carriers

21

of property -- does that mean motor carriers of property

22

for hire or any motor carrier that is carrying property?

23
24
25

MR. CORDRAY:

Well, it would be those who come

within the terms of this specific preemption clause.
QUESTION:

Yes, that's what I want to know.

MR. CORDRAY:

Yes.

I -- I believe that this

statute is referring to for hire carriers of -- motor

carriers of property.

QUESTION:

So -- so, if a State were to say all

6

prices of all trucks in this State have to be $50 -- all

7

trucks -- and they don't say motor carriers of property,

8

that's not preempted.

9
10

MR. CORDRAY:

No, that is not correct because

it's specifically referenced --

11

QUESTION:

Of course, it's not correct.

And

12

similarly, if they say on a street, no truck can use this

13

street --

14

MR. CORDRAY:

15

QUESTION:

16

Yes.

-- and they don't say motor carriers

of property, it's the same.

17

MR. CORDRAY:

The reason is -- no.

The reason

is that specifically references price.

There are lots of

There's not a word of legislative

If you read (c)(1) as narrowly as

No, that's not true, Your Honor.

So, it's strictly a question of form

that we're dealing with, that States, you can delegate to

6

your cities, as you always have, just say, cities, what do

7

you want and we'll give it to you by enacting a State law.

8
9

MR. CORDRAY:

No.

It's not simply a matter of

form because Congress made a judgment that if there were

10

50 different States imposing their own schemes, that would

11

be less impediments and -- and tangle of restrictions

12

impeding a free market than if 39,000 municipalities and

13

local governments around the country were free on their

14

own to do what they wished, and that that -- that was in

15

fact very much undercutting the desire to get to a free

16

market in transportation services.

17

But I also want to go back to your comment and

18

your question earlier.

This statute does not itself

19

distinguish between economic regulation that's preempted

20

on the one hand and safety regulation that's not on the

21

other.

22

is related to price, route, and services of a motor

25

we can simply remand, the lower court can sort it out, I

The phrasing of the statute is much broader.

It

And so the notion that that's the divide and

1

believe is not correct.

2

Now, as we've seen here, the fact that the --

3

the statute is broad does not mean it's all encompassing.

4

I mean, I could see an argument that truck -- trucking

5

companies no longer now have to pay corporate tax because

6

that affects their price.

Alderson Reporting Company

And

1

insurance is an excellent example I'll get to in a moment.

2

But also in the preemption clause itself,

3

(c)(1), it refers to the authority of a State to enact or

enforce a law or regulation.

5

authority, and it distinguishes it full stop from the

6

authority of a political subdivision of a State to do the

7

same thing.

8

the regulatory authority is being discussed specifically

9

in the preemption clause itself.

10

What?

That is regulatory

Enact or enforce a regulation.

So,

That's the fallacy of starting the analysis here

11

by jumping all the way to (c)(2)(A) and wrenching that

text out of context and divorcing it from the preemption

clause that it's meant to be a savings subordinate to.

When you described the regulatory --

I would also point out that the third subclause

there, which relates to insurance requirements, they would

10

be saying that municipalities are free to impose their own

believe for purposes of title 49, it's a defined term to

Those are the same

And again, canons of construction have been

7

denigrated in this case, but they have to do with the

8

natural and ordinary reading of statutes.

9

that Congress uses to draft laws in some confidence that

The baseline

10

the executive branch and the courts will interpret them as

11

Congress meant them, and that's exactly what's --

12

QUESTION:

The executive branch.

Now, you -- I

13

know you have said, and I quite agree, that the Department

14

of Transportation has no supervisory authority, it has no

15

Chevron deference.

16

from the courts simply because it has familiarity with the

17

area of motor carrier regulation that the courts don't?

18

But doesn't it deserve some respect

MR. CORDRAY:

That's a -- that's a statement I

19

couldn't disagree with more strongly.

20

General here has conceded they have no authority to

21

administer this statute.

22
23
24
25

QUESTION:

The Solicitor

The notion that you have a --

They've not conceded the Department

of Transportation -- you -- deserves no respect.
MR. CORDRAY:

The -- the notion that a

deregulatory statute that took governmental entities out

1

of an area to create a free market would now be subject to

2

umpiring by the Federal agency, in terms of the scope of

3

preemption, which is an issue this Court has always said

4

is for the courts to determine --

5

QUESTION:

I didn't say umpiring.

I said its

6

views on the proper construction of this statute.

7

weight, if any, should this Court give to the Department

8

of Transportation's view, this is what the statute means?

9

Not as an umpire, not as a referee.

10

MR. CORDRAY:

What

Their construction is to leave

11

them as an umpire.

But I would say certainly not Chevron

12

deference.

13

that's only entitled where there's some sort of reason to

14

think that before they got to their litigation position

15

here, which has migrated in the course of this case -- it

16

started off as an argument about repeal by implication.

17

It's now turned into argument about sort of reading

18

statutes together to import them into this statute -- is

19

entitled to really, I think, no respect here because it is

not persuasive.

21

detail --

At most some sort of Skidmore respect, but

They have not analyzed the statute in

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. CORDRAY:

24

QUESTION:

25

Well, if -- if you lose, you know --- in any of their prior --

If you're changing your argument --

you know, if you lost in the lower court, you'd probably

1

be well advised to change your argument.

2

(Laughter.)

3

MR. CORDRAY:

4

Your Honor.

5

I wouldn't disagree with that,

But again --

QUESTION:

Mr. Cordray, what -- what about the

6

point made that if -- if you accept your interpretation,

7

municipalities not only would not be able to enact

8

regulations themselves, they would not be able to enforce

9

regulations adopted by the -- by the State, which would be

10

a great inconvenience, that the only enforcement can be by

11

the State police and not by local -- local police.

12

MR. CORDRAY:

We agree, but that's not what this

13

preemption clause is about or any preemption clause is

14

ever about.

15

don't use it in the terms of making law and executing the

16

law.

17

law or applying -- or enforcing and applying preexisting

18

law.

19

When they say enact or enforce here, they

They use it in the -- in the sense of enacting new

And the point of this preemption clause is to

20

say that municipalities do not have the authority to act

21

in this realm by imposing their own public policies.

22

a matter of either new law or preexisting law.

23

structure of many of these preemption statutes the Court

24

has dealt with.

25

QUESTION:

It's

That's the

If we think this statute is -- that
52

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

there are arguments either way for interpreting it,

2

shouldn't we pay heed to the petitioners' point that it's

3

a very serious matter for the Congress of the United

4

States to tell States how they should govern themselves?

5

MR. CORDRAY:

We think the language of the

6

statute is clear here, Your Honor.

7

extinguished the power of the municipality --

8
9

QUESTION:
with that.

They explicitly

Let's -- let's say we -- we disagree

Is -- is that not -- let's say we find the

10

statute in -- in equipoise, or the arguments.

11

not give force to the argument petitioner makes that the

12

States should be presumed to have the authority to

13

determine how best to govern themselves?

14

MR. CORDRAY:

No.

Should we

There's no substantive Tenth

15

Amendment issue here.

16

or local governments to enact some sort of program.

17

is the same as the Court in Wolens where they said this

18

statute must be read to say the State cannot legislate in

19

this area, but they can enforce contracts through their

20

courts.

21

That's Congress exercising its power under the Supremacy

22

Clause, anything in the laws or constitution of the States

23

notwithstanding.

24
25

There's no commandeering of States
This

There's no Tenth Amendment problem with that.

And as the Solicitor General said in the brief
in the Mortier case, the notion that when Congress decided
53
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that there could be State regulation but they had to

2

preempt local regulation, that they would somehow have to

3

be forced to preempt State regulation as well, simply

4

turns the Tenth Amendment on its head.

5

that there's any -- any serious constitutional issue here.

6

QUESTION:

So, we don't think

It seems to me your argument boils

7

down to the point that there are 10 provisions in the

8

statute.

9

says the same thing, but we're not going to read it the

Nine of them are perfectly clear.

The tenth

10

way it seems to read because it's not as clear as the

11

other nine.

12

MR. CORDRAY:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. CORDRAY:

No, that's not what it boils down.

That's about all it amounts to.
It boils down to the fact that

15

Congress deliberately inserted a phrase here, political

16

subdivision of a State, so that it can preempt --

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. CORDRAY:

19

QUESTION:

20
21

In the -- in the nine, right.
And -- and it --

If you just read the one all by

itself, it's perfectly clear too.
MR. CORDRAY:

Well, it's -- it is clear, I

22

believe, because it's clear because they said a State

23

cannot -- a political subdivision cannot --

24

QUESTION:

But the only reason --

25

MR. CORDRAY:

-- and they state the authority of
54

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

a State to do certain things.

2

QUESTION:

The only support you have is they're

3

not as detailed and specific in the one in question as

4

they are in the other nine.

5

MR. CORDRAY:

6

detailed and specific.

7

for Congress legislating in this way or drafting this

8

language or enacting it unless they intended to make a

9

difference.

10

And -- and there's no rationale

That's -- that's the whole purpose of

QUESTION:

Your support is the context of the

statute, which --

13
14

I think it is equally

including that language.

11
12

No.

MR. CORDRAY:
context.

No.

That's correct.

MR. SUTTON:

Thank you, Mr. Cordray.

I'd like to respond to a few of the

points -QUESTION:

Mr. Sutton, could you ask one --

22

answer one factual question for me?

Your -- your

23

made the argument that in -- in reading (c)(2)(A), he went

24

to the last clause and said on your theory every political

25

subdivision could enact its own financial responsibility

1

and insurance laws and so on.

2

MR. SUTTON:

3

QUESTION:

Yes.
And that would be a crazy scheme.

4

-- my question is, is there in fact any history of

5

municipalities enacting these kinds of statutes so that

6

it's something that might have been in Congress's mind?

7

MR. SUTTON:

No, Your Honor, not in -- in the

8

insurance area.

9

to that concern, and the better answer is, our point is

But there's a -- I think a better answer

10

that (c)(2)(A) incorporates all of these preexisting

11

preemption provisions.

12

other parts of title 49, whether it's insurance, safety,

13

size and weight routing, or hazardous material routing.

14

My

They are preemption provisions in

So, the problem with Justice O'Connor's point of

15

practical consequences -- in reversing the Sixth Circuit,

16

there is no gap here.

17

Congress and the Department of Transportation have been

18

regulating these very areas, both with respect to State

19

laws and city laws, to the extent they've been enacted.

20

So, the multiplicity of insurance regulations is a false

21

concern.

22

31138 and 39 what the rules are there.

23

Transportation has implemented regulations that do get

24

Chevron deference, and they lay out what the rules are.

25

Why?

Because for 60 years,

I mean, the -- Congress has already indicated in

The Department of

The same problem, you didn't, is -56

1

to me anyway, is -- is (3)(A).

Do you see what I'm

2

thinking?

3

wrote the words in -- in (c)(2)(A) and he used the word

4

State, and at precisely the same time, he wrote the second

5

exception, which is (3)(A) --

I mean, the same human being at the same time

6

MR. SUTTON:

7

QUESTION:

Right.
-- and he put in political

8

subdivision.

And what I cannot get over is I don't see

9

how a single human being on the same day at the same time

10

could write two exceptions, use the word "State" in one

11

and use the word "political subdivision" in the other,

12

without meaning a difference.

13

MR. SUTTON:

Right.

Your Honor, look -- compare

14

(3)(A) to (c)(1).

They follow the exact same enact or

15

enforce language.

(c)(2)(A) does not use the enact or

16

enforce language.

17

QUESTION:

That's the answer.

18

MR. SUTTON:

19

Number two, remember, (c)(3) is for the benefit

That's the answer, number one.

20

of motor carriers.

21

these rules, whether city or State, apply to them on a

22

city-by-city not State-by-State basis.

23

They want to make sure they could have

Now, the -- the regulatory purpose, Your Honor

24

-- the landmark legislation in this area was the 1980 law

25

that deregulated interstate commerce.

Everyone agrees

57
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that did not divest cities of authority.

2

The 1994 law at issue here was about intrastate

3

commerce, primarily to put FedEx and UPS on a level

4

playing field, and suddenly respondents are saying that

5

deregulated -- regulatory purpose required the divestment

6

of local authority?

7

QUESTION:

8

Well, what's -- what's Congress's

authority to regulate intrastate commerce?

9

MR. SUTTON:

It's at its outer edges, and that

10

to me is what is so odd about this particular

11

interpretation.

12

you could divest States of their authority to delegate,

13

but they've not done it in the interstate area?

14

how absurd is that?

15

backwards.

16

They're saying in the intrastate area,

I mean,

It's -- it's got it exactly

Now, the practical consequences -- I want to go

17

back to again -- of their interpretation.

18

they've agreed, has to be construed the same way

19

throughout, and there are countless -- as we indicated in

20

our opening brief, every State in the country has

21

delegations to cities that have size and weight controls,

22

size and weight rules that would be eliminated by this

23

particular construction.
