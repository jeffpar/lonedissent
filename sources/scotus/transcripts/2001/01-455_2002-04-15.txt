ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFF H. ECKLAND

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10
11

MR. ECKLAND:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This Court has held that statutes of limitations

12

involve fundamental considerations of fairness.

13

Petitioners submit that the cases before Your Honors this

14

morning involve precisely that.

15

In these two civil actions, petitioners seek

16

fair compensation for continuing to be bound to the

17

Section 515 housing program and continuing to house low-

18

income tenants for up to 50 years.

19

succeed in obtaining that fair compensation only if this

20

Court continues to apply the same ordinary principles of

21

law to the United States Government that it applies to

22

United States citizens.

23

Petitioners can

The ordinary principles of law and their

24

continuing application to the United States Government

25

that are at issue here are, first, that a breach of

Page 3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

contract claim does not accrue until the date of breach;

2

that is, until the time for performance by the defendant

3

arrives and the defendant fails to perform.
QUESTION:

4

Mr. Eckland, you -- you began by

5

saying you're seeking fair compensation for something.

6

Which is it?

7

Government's violation of the Constitution by impairing

8

the obligation of contracts, or are you simply seeking

9

your contractual rights?

10
11
12
13
14
15

claim?

Are you seeking fair compensation for the

Are you seeking a contract

Which -- what do we have before us?
MR. ECKLAND:

We are -- Justice Scalia, we are

seeking compensation for the breach of contract.
QUESTION:

Okay.

So, it's a -- it's a simple

contract case.
MR. ECKLAND:

Very much so, Your Honor.

I mean,

16

included in the compensation that the petitioners are

17

seeking, it was not merely the lost income because of

18

their lost right to opt out, but given the situation,

19

petitioners are not receiving really sufficient income to

20

even cover the costs of maintaining the housing for their

21

current tenants.

22

QUESTION:

Do you think you have a separate

23

cause of action for the Government's violation of the

24

Constitution, assuming that -- that you're correct that

25

that's what it's done?

MR. ECKLAND:
Scalia?
QUESTION:

3
4

MR. ECKLAND:

But --

Oh, quite so, Your Honor, yes.

QUESTION:

This is a -- this is a Federal

contract?
MR. ECKLAND:

9

It is with the Department of

10

Agriculture, Your Honor, through the Farmers Home

11

Administration.
QUESTION:

12
13

So, the impairment clause doesn't

apply.
MR. ECKLAND:

14
15

We

believe that although it's for purposes --

7
8

Well, no, not the takings.

but impairing the obligation of contracts.

5
6

Under the takings claim, Justice

Well, it -- it comes -- no.

That

only applies to the States.
QUESTION:

16

My difficulty with your argument is

17

that if you have -- your whole property claim here rests

18

upon the contract.

19

your contract will be enforceable.

20

contract claim, then I'm not sure what the source of your

21

property taking is on the -- on the unconstitutionality

22

claim.

23

And if you have a contract claim, then

MR. ECKLAND:

If you don't have a

Well, petitioners pled, Justice

24

Souter, the takings claim in the alternative to the breach

25

of contract claim.

And in fact, the lower courts have

Page 5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

held that there is no enforceable contract here.
QUESTION:

Well, if -- if they are correct, then

3

I don't see how you've got a taking because your -- your

4

whole property interest -- the only property interest

5

you're asserting is an interest under that contract.

6

if you haven't got the -- if you have no breach of

7

contract, then I don't see what's being taken from you.

8
9

MR. ECKLAND:

What's being taken, Justice

Souter, is the expected use of the petitioners'

10

properties.

11

certain period of time --

12

And

What happened is they volunteered to a

QUESTION:

If you don't have a contract for it,

13

you have no right to expect it.

14

MR. ECKLAND:

But there were representations by

15

the Government that created a reasonable investment-backed

16

expectation on the part of --

17

QUESTION:

18

there was no contract claim?

19
20

Why did the lower courts find that

MR. ECKLAND:

Because of the statute.

Because of the -- one judge, in

particular, because of the unmistakability doctrine.

21

QUESTION:

Because of the --

22

MR. ECKLAND:

In other words, the contract was

23

not clear enough to constitute an enforceable contract

24

with the Government.

25

QUESTION:

I thought the Federal Circuit went on

Page 6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the statute of limitations.

2

opposing, that the statute of limitations didn't expire?

3

MR. ECKLAND:

Isn't that what you're

Yes, Your Honor.

The lower court

4

opinions were denying our motion for summary judgment, so

5

we've not been able to get to trial on the existence of

6

the contract.

7

there is a contract, the Federal Circuit did affirm the

8

dismissal on the basis of the statute of limitations.

9

Assuming for the purposes of our case that

QUESTION:

Yes.

The question you presented is

10

whether a breach of contract claim accrues for purposes of

11

section -- when Congress enacts a statute alleged to

12

abridge a contractual right to freedom from regulatory

13

covenants upon prepayment of Government mortgage loans.

14

Basically the -- the court held that your -- the statute

15

of limitations barred your contract claim, didn't it?

16

MR. ECKLAND:

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. ECKLAND:

19
20

That is true, Your Honor.

And that's the case we have here.
Well, in -- yes.

Yes, it is,

Judge, a statute of limitations case.
In our case, the petitioners alleged that their

21

claims accrued when they tried to prepay and when the

22

Farmers Home Administration failed to accept their

23

prepayment requests and refused to release them from the

24

regulatory covenants imposed by the Section 515 program.

25

Petitioners all commenced suit within 6 years of that

Page 7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

date, and therefore they maintain here that their claims

2

are timely.

3

Now, the Government maintains that the

4

petitioners' claims accrued not on the date dictated by

5

the ordinary principles of law, breach of contract and

6

takings, but rather automatically in the enactment of the

7

1988 legislation.

8

1988 legislation, it's clear that it has no immediate

9

impact whatsoever on the owners.

But if you look at -- closely at the

All of its commands,

10

directives, requirements, and authorizations are directed

11

solely at the agency.

12
13
14

QUESTION:

Didn't the Federal Circuit rely on

anticipatory breach?
MR. ECKLAND:

No, Your Honor.

They maintained

15

that the actual passage of the -- of the statute

16

constituted an automatic breach.

17

anticipatory breach.

18
19
20

QUESTION:

They did not rely on the

You were relying on anticipatory

breach, as I understand it.
MR. ECKLAND:

We do not either, Your Honor,

21

although the petitioners here have the option of suing --

22

assuming -- suing before the breach, assuming that they

23

had the ability to perform at that time -- and there's

24

nothing in the record --

25

QUESTION:

You rely on the notion that before

they went to pay it off, it was an anticipatory breach.
MR. ECKLAND:
actual breach.

No, Judge.

We are relying on the

All petitioners --

QUESTION:

I'm sorry.

Then I'm confused.

I

5

thought that your argument was that the reason the statute

6

of limitations doesn't arise, doesn't start to run prior

7

to the time that they paid it off, is because prior to

8

that time, there was no actual breach.

9

anticipatory breach.

10

MR. ECKLAND:

11

QUESTION:

12

Justice Ginsburg was asking.

Correct, yes.

All right.

13

MR. ECKLAND:

14

QUESTION:

There was only an

That's what I thought

Yes.

Now, but you take the position that

15

your clients could have filed suit soon after the passage

16

of ELIHPA.

17

MR. ECKLAND:

Justice O'Connor, not necessarily.

18

Under the doctrine of anticipatory repudiation, they did

19

have a option to sue before.

20

footnote --

21

QUESTION:

But as we pointed out in

Well, that's what I'm asking you.

22

You take the position -- let's be clear about your --

23

please -- that after the enactment of the statute, your

24

clients could have filed suit for breach of contract on an

25

anticipatory breach theory?

MR. ECKLAND:

ability to prepay at that time.

3

of -- of the contract is that the petitioners had the

4

requisite funds to prepay before submitting a prepayment

5

request.

MR. ECKLAND:

10

Yes, but only if they had the
One of the requirements

Well, no, no, no, no, no.
That is --

You -- you don't -- you don't -- no.

You have to -- you say for anticipatory breach you have to
show that you're ready to --

MR. ECKLAND:

14

show that you're ready for immediate performance.

-- to perform when -- when the

MR. ECKLAND:

15

Ready, willing, and able, Judge.

You -- you don't have to

You do have to show that you're --

16

but for the repudiation, you do have to show that you are

17

able to perform.
QUESTION:

18

But performance here -- what you're

19

talking about here in performance means the ability to

20

prepay.

21

prepaid because we didn't have the money, and therefore we

22

couldn't have proved damages.

23
24
25

And I take it your argument is we couldn't have

MR. ECKLAND:

Is -- is that it?

Essentially so, Your Honor.

We

don't rely on -QUESTION:

I have a contract to deliver 100,000

2

is committed to buy those widgets announces I am not going

3

to buy those widgets, and you say there is no anticipatory

4

breach unless I have on hand the 100,000 widgets, which I

5

have no obligation to deliver until 3 years from now.

6

That's -- that's how you envision the -- the law of

7

anticipatory breach?

10

The party who -- the party who

I'm sure that's wrong.

MR. ECKLAND:

Well, no.

Well, footnote 23.

We

address this in our reply brief, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

The whole purpose of anticipatory

11

breach -- most people use it not to get damages but to

12

relieve themselves of the obligation of -- of remaining in

13

-- in the status of being able to perform the contract.

14

The person who would sue in the case that I gave you would

15

be suing so that he wouldn't have to go and acquire the

16

100,000 -- the 100,000 widgets.

17

he's ready -- or almost never the case that he's ready

18

here and now to perform.

19

MR. ECKLAND:

It's never the case that

20

had the obligation to accept the delivery did not have the

21

QUESTION:

Could we agree to this?

2

Could we agree to this, that so far as the element of an

3

anticipatory breach claim involves the act of the

4

Government, you had that element, and at least to that

5

extent, you could have brought an anticipatory breach

6

claim when the statute was passed?

7

other elements.

8

had the -- you had the -- the Government's fault element.

9

Is that correct?

11
12

That's what we're arguing about, but you

Do you agree?

MR. ECKLAND:

10

Maybe you didn't have

Well, certainly, Justice Souter,

the -QUESTION:

But you're saying, whether I could

13

have sued then or not, I certainly can sue at the point at

14

which I would claim my right to redeem without these

15

various conditions, and they refused to honor it.

16

saying, even if I could have sued when the statute was

17

passed, I can also under contract principles sue when the

18

moment comes that I want to exercise my right to prepay.

19

MR. ECKLAND:

20

QUESTION:

MR. ECKLAND:

Correct, Your Honor.

Okay.

require you to sue until that date.

23

to sue prior to that date.

25

QUESTION:

You're

It's merely an option

So, you're arguing for total control

say, 20 years later.

MR. ECKLAND:

QUESTION:

13

MR. ECKLAND:

That was the deal.
That was the deal.

Yes.
And the owners relied on that when

14

they signed up, and they had, you know, a clear

15

expectation that at some point in time they would be able

16

to prepay, opt out, and convert their markets --

17

QUESTION:

May -- may I interrupt you?

18

MR. ECKLAND:

19

QUESTION:

-- to market rate -- yes.

Did they have a right to assume right

20

after the -- the day after the statute was passed, did

21

they continue to have a right to prepay --

22

MR. ECKLAND:

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. ECKLAND:

25

The right --

-- without any objection?
Well, the right still existed,

Your Honor, but it wasn't -- it was repudiated at the time

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

of the statute.

Well, it wasn't just -- it's not like

3

a private citizen saying, I don't intend to perform 3

4

years from now.

5

certain contract right.

6

was passed?

You have a law passed that takes away a

MR. ECKLAND:

7

Was there a breach when the law

Well, Your Honor, petitioners

8

maintain that the right was not eliminated.

9

you will, conditioned -QUESTION:

10

It was, if

Do you maintain there was no breach

11

at the time the law was passed?

12

MR. ECKLAND:

That's correct, Your Honor.

13

That's merely repudiation.

The breach did not occur

14

unless and until the prepayment request was submitted and

15

denied.

16

QUESTION:

17

statute changed your rights.

18

But you would concede that the

MR. ECKLAND:

The statute did condition them,

19

and that conditioning, or fettering as the Government

20

says, is a repudiation, but like any other situation in

21

the private sector, when you repudiate a right, the breach

22

doesn't occur until the time for performance comes due.

23

QUESTION:

The repudiation --

24

QUESTION:

Well, that's because a private party

25

has the right to change his mind.

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. ECKLAND:

Correct.

Right, the defendant

2

could change their mind or the petitioner here could, in

3

fact, be able to --

4

QUESTION:

5

to change its mind?

6

statute going back to what the situation was before this

7

one?

Doesn't the Government have the right
Couldn't the Government pass another

8

MR. ECKLAND:

9

QUESTION:

10

Yes, Justice Scalia.

In fact, it did that at one point,

didn't it?

11

MR. ECKLAND:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. ECKLAND:

They could and they did.

They did at one point, didn't they?
In 1979 they initially conditioned

14

the right, and in 1980 they repealed it, retracted it.

15

Now, under the Government's proposed rule, if -- if the

16

statute of limitations began to run immediately upon the

17

enactment of the statute, all of the petitioners here

18

would have been compelled to file their suit within 6

19

years of 1979, i.e., by 1985.

20

QUESTION:

So, we're arguing about whether a

21

statute itself, without any action from the agency, can be

22

a repudiation.

23

MR. ECKLAND:

We believe it can be a

24

repudiation, yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

But the breach does

25

not ripen, if you will, unless and until the prepayment

Page 15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

request is denied.
QUESTION:

Does the repudiation give you the

3

right to the same damages that you would receive for a

4

total breach of the contract?

5

MR. ECKLAND:

In our case, no.

The petitioners

6

maintain that since the housing is within a restricted

7

program, it really has no market value unless and until a

8

petitioner actually attempts to prepay.

9

assuming, Your Honor, that there was some type of damage

But even

10

caused by the enactment of the statute, still the

11

limitations period would not commence to run until the

12

time for performance came and was not rendered.

13

QUESTION:

I think it's usually the case, is it

14

not, that when there's an anticipatory repudiation, it's

15

-- it's very difficult for the -- the other party to

16

determine what his damages are going to be.

17

MR. ECKLAND:

18

QUESTION:

Very difficult.

Which is why he uses the doctrine to

19

get out of the contract rather than to seek damages.

20

the widget case I gave you, who knows?

21

years from now the price of widgets will be?

22

use it to get out of the contract.

23

MR. ECKLAND:

In

Who knows what 3
So -- so you

Petitioners here, being in the

24

Court of Federal Claims, have as their only remedy the

25

monetary judgment.

1

starting only as of the date that their prepayment request

2

was denied by the agency.

3

QUESTION:

So --

So are you -- you're saying that

4

there was a claim, or you're saying that -- that your

5

claim really doesn't accrue until you -- until you have

6

the -- the wherewithal to prepay.

7

have a ripe claim until then?

8
9

MR. ECKLAND:

So, you don't really

We're saying the petitioners would

at least have to have the money to prepay.

They would

10

have to have the ability to perform.

11

situation, for example, where someone was unable to

12

prepay, they experienced repudiation and a breach, a later

13

breach, and then say, well, we would have performed if you

14

hadn't repudiated.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. ECKLAND:

17

You couldn't have a

Well -They have to have the honest

intent to perform and have the ability to perform.

18

QUESTION:

I have a problem with that.

19

MR. ECKLAND:

20

QUESTION:

Yes.

But let's get -- if we can get -- for

21

the same reason Justice Scalia mentioned.

assume you had cash in the bank that would allow you to

Sure.

At that point, can't you show your

value and part of the value is the right at any time to

10

You don't want to prepay, but can't you say --

It's worth

And you do that at the moment the repudiation

MR. ECKLAND:

But here, Justice Kennedy, a 50-

11

year option exists.

13

the value of their properties would be, given interest

15

point in time --

16
17
18

QUESTION:

Petitioners don't know, frankly --

Well, you mean 50-year options are

not subject to valuation?
MR. ECKLAND:

Experts do this all the time.

Well, but even so, even if you

19

could come up with a damage theory to cover this, still

20

it's clear that under the law, the breach would not be

21

deemed to accrue for limitations purposes until the time

22

for performance has arrived and performance failed.

MR. ECKLAND:

It's just

Justice O'Connor, no.

If the

10

petitioners had the ability to pay, they could have

11

brought an anticipatory breach claim -QUESTION:

12
13
14

Only if they had the ability to pay,

you say.
MR. ECKLAND:

According to Corbin and the case

15

law that we cite at footnote 23 of our brief, yes.

16

we get beyond that, okay --

17

QUESTION:

But if

Footnote 23 just says that ordinary

18

contract law applies to this kind of case.

We still --

19

but we still -- we still have to figure out what ordinary

20

contract law is.

21

that that I saw.

Footnote 23 doesn't shed any light on

22

MR. ECKLAND:

23

QUESTION:

But in this case --

And -- and I might add that on page

24

27 of the blue brief, you say that the law constituted an

25

anticipatory repudiation and petitioners had the option of

MR. ECKLAND:

4

the actual breach.

In general, yes, that's true, Your

But here the petitioners sued within 6 years of

5

QUESTION:

And in fact, you did not sue until

6

after the passage of 6 years.

7

MR. ECKLAND:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. ECKLAND:

From the statute, yes, Your Honor.

From the enactment of the statute.
But -- but all petitioners

10

commenced suit within 6 years of the date of the actual

11

breach, which is the date that the prepayment requests

12

were denied.
QUESTION:

13

So, what apparently the Government's

14

arguing -- does it matter if we call this anticipatory

15

repudiation or anticipatory breach?

16

technically --

17

MR. ECKLAND:

18

QUESTION:

19

I guess

Technically --

-- we should say anticipatory

repudiation?

20

MR. ECKLAND:

21

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

Fine.

And so, what they say, in

22

part, which I'd like to hear your response, is if you're

23

right that where there is anticipatory repudiation of a

24

contract, the other side, if it's a private contract, has

25

a choice.

They can either sue immediately if conditions

1

X, Y, and Z are fulfilled, or they wait until the contract

2

is actually breached.

3

have to interpret this statute strictly, and therefore we

4

interpret it to mean that even if where you're dealing

5

with a private person, you'd have your choice; here

6

there's no choice.

But we are the Government and we

7

Now, your response is what?

8

MR. ECKLAND:

Well, here, Your Honor, although,

9

yes, we need to construe the statute strictly, we cannot

10

do so in such a manner, however, to narrow the waiver of

11

sovereign immunity that has already occurred under the

12

Tucker Act.

13

against New York, the tolling -- equitable tolling

14

principles at issue in those cases, which applied to the

15

private sector, were nonetheless deemed to apply to the

16

Government, despite the strict construction of the statute

17

of limitations involved in those cases.

18

although there's a conditioning of the right at the point

19

of the repudiation, no breach occurs until the performance

20

comes due and is not rendered.

21

As this Court held in Irwin and in Bowen

Here there is --

the point of the denial of the prepayment request, there

11

is a definite breach and that's where the damages occur.

courts do not rule in the petitioners' favor on the

contract claim, they have their wholly independent takings

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

11

MR. ROBERTS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Petitioners' claims are barred because they

12

weren't filed within 6 years of when they first accrued,

13

on the enactment of ELIHPA.

14

contracts gave them the option to prepay their mortgages

15

at any time subject to only those legal restrictions in

place when the contracts were made.

17

alleging that the Government promised not to impose

18

additional legal restrictions on their option to prepay

prepayment.

QUESTION:

And that the contract included a

MR. ROBERTS:

Included a right of prepayment and

not only a right of prepayment, because if the contract

10

just said you can prepay at any time, it like all

I thought that was your point, that

17

this -- this breach is different because it was done by

18

legislation.

19

MR. ROBERTS:

That doesn't mean -- that -- that

20

doesn't mean that it's not a breach, but what it means is

21

that the breach is occurring at the time the legislation

22

is passed.

23

QUESTION:

So, fine.

The legislation says, ha-

24

ha, we won't pay.

You know, I just want the legislation

to say precisely what the private person said.

of legislation?

3

MR. ROBERTS:

4

QUESTION:

Yes.

Okay.

Now, one thing -- I'm just

5

curious to get into that a little bit -- is, I don't

6

understand why the Government is taking the position it

7

does, as well as what the position is.

8

wouldn't you, if you win -- and this will help me

9

understand it -- have millions of people who have entered

10

into contracts with the Government poring over every law

11

that is passed, and probably every regulation, to decide

12

whether or not that law and that regulation will somehow

13

10 or 15 years from now impact on a real estate contract

14

they have with the Government?

15

Now, if you can explain that to me, I suspect
I'll have a better time understanding your argument.
MR. ROBERTS:

Okay.

What -- what we're -- what

22

we're asking for is that people who believe that their

contractual rights have been injured -- have been

24

infringed by a statute give the Government reasonably

result.

5

And the benefit of the

it isn't that the petitioners -- or that the Government is

I mean, the -- the reason -- the

25

reason contract law has developed the option of suing for

1

anticipatory breach as just an option is precisely because

2

it is often so difficult to anticipate what your damages

3

will be.

4

who hasn't broken the contract to either sue immediately,

5

if he can calculate his damages and get them, or to wait

6

until the -- the time for performance comes.

And so, it leaves it up to the innocent party

And what the Government is doing with this

7
8

theory is forcing everybody who has a contract with the

9

Government to come in with -- with speculative damages and

10

hoping that some court will find a difference between the

11

value of this contract now and what it would be 50 years

12

from now.

13

would want to impose this kind of a regime upon

14

contractors with the Government.

15

MR. ROBERTS:

I -- I think it's a -- I don't know why you

The damages, first of all, can be

16

measured, as I said.

Second of all, the -- the

17

Government, as reflected in the statute of limitations,

18

has a -- has a prompt -- has an interest in prompt

19

resolution of the claims.

20

QUESTION:

Well, I'm not --

21

QUESTION:

I mean, anything can be measured.

I

22

mean, you know, my life expectancy can be measured, but I

23

wouldn't bet a whole lot of money on it.

24

MR. ROBERTS:

25

QUESTION:

That -- that's right --

You know, you -- you can come up with

Alderson Reporting Company

1

a guess for -- for anything.

2

give the option to the innocent party is precisely because

3

it's a guess.

4

it's a guess.

It may be, you know, an educated guess, but

MR. ROBERTS:

5

But -- but the reason we

With -- with due respect, Your

6

Honor, I -- I don't think that's the reason why the law

7

gives the -- the option to the innocent party.

8

gives the option to the innocent party so that the -- the

9

party has the ability -- the opportunity to convince the

10

The law

defendant to retract its wrongful repudiation.
QUESTION:

11

But if -- if it is an option, why

12

should the innocent party be penalized by having the

13

statute of limitations start to run then?

14

MR. ROBERTS:

15

the statute is a present breach.

16

that --

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. ROBERTS:

It's not an option here because
And -- and to understand

Well, are you --- it's important to understand

19

the nature of the promise that's -- that's at issue here,

20

I think, and if -- if I could try to go back to -- to do

21

that.

22

QUESTION:

Yes.

I was going to ask -- I -- I

23

think it's consistent with the Chief Justice's inquiry.

24

Are you saying that there's only one cause of action here,

25

or do you concede that there are two causes of action, one

Page 35
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

for repudiation or anticipatory breach and the other for

2

the actual breach?
MR. ROBERTS:

3

Our position is that there is an

4

actual breach at the time that the statute is passed, and

5

it's a breach of -- of the promise that the Government

6

made that it wouldn't impose additional legal restrictions

7

on prepayment.

8

QUESTION:

MR. ROBERTS:
QUESTION:

10
11
12

Even though -It's different from --

Even though performance is not yet

due.
MR. ROBERTS:

Performance on that promise is

13

due, Your Honor.

14

throughout the life of the loan.

15

Performance on that promise is -- is due

QUESTION:

No.

But you can make that argument

16

with respect to any contract that is ever made.

17

saying there is always an implicit term that they won't

18

monkey around with the terms of the contract, and whenever

19

in anticipation they do so, there's an immediate breach.

20

And if you follow that analysis, then in fact the

21

distinction between repudiation and anticipatory breach on

22

the one hand and actual breach on the other will disappear

23

in every contract, public or private.

24
25

MR. ROBERTS:

You're

No, Your Honor, because -- because

the -- the difference is between legislation and the --

Page 36
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

and the role that legislation has under background

2

principles of contract law and other actions.

3

QUESTION:

The background principle of contract

4

law is that we try to treat the Government and a private

5

contracting party together.

6

MR. ROBERTS:

7

QUESTION:

Yes.

And you're saying the fact that the

8

Government can speak through legislation, whereas a

9

private party cannot, alters that rule.

If so, then that

10

rule is going to have a remarkably short life because the

11

Government can do anything it wants to across the street

12

and displace the rule.

13

MR. ROBERTS:

The -- the distinction, Your

14

Honor, is that -- is -- is twofold.

The legislation

15

changes the legal rights and so there isn't an ability

16

anymore to perform.

17

QUESTION:

Why does it change the legal rights

18

if the contract exists?

19

right into a -- a right to damages as opposed to a right

20

to performance, but the theory of contract is that by

21

repudiation you can't just change the legal rights.

22

MR. ROBERTS:

It may -- it may convert one

It does -- it does exactly that.

23

That's what I mean by changing the legal rights, that it

24

changes -- there's no longer a -- a right to performance.

25

There's only a right to the damages.

If it was a contract

1

-QUESTION:

2

All right.

If that is so, then

3

exactly the same thing is true in a private contract when

4

there has been an anticipatory breach.
MR. ROBERTS:

5

No.

No, Your Honor, there might

6

be a right to specific performance if it was the kind of

7

contract that you could specific performance, but we would

8

submit that you couldn't get specific performance once the

Government --

MR. ROBERTS:

How does the fact that you cannot --- precluded the performance by

You could only get damages.
QUESTION:

13

Let's assume you're right.

How does

14

the fact that you may not get specific performance against

15

the Government affect the right to damages, which you

16

perfectly can get against the Government, as -- as against

17

any other private contract?
MR. ROBERTS:

18

The -- what it does is show that

19

there's -- that there's a change and an -- an injury right

Then that gets back to the original

point.

apply in every contract, public or private.

24
25

If that's so, then the same argument is going to

MR. ROBERTS:

It -- it's not going to apply in a

private context because there isn't going to be a breach

by virtue of -- of legislation unless there's a promise by

the private party that --

MR. ROBERTS:

6

You -- you have invented --- that the laws aren't going to

change.
QUESTION:

I understand.

You have invented a

7

promise that I won't change the laws.

You can invent in

8

-- in private contracts an implicit promise that I will

9

not repudiate, and therefore, when you repudiate

10

anticipatorily, you have broken the contract and, bingo,

11

there is a breach of contract and you must sue at once.

12

MR. ROBERTS:

13

QUESTION:

MR. ROBERTS:

17

You -- you have --

You no longer have the option.
You have --

You could do it.

I mean, it's just

MR. ROBERTS:

You have no need to invent that.

18

You have no need to -- to have that additional promise in

19

the private contract because -- because there isn't the

20

presumption.

even though the Government is -- has the ability to

legislate.

There -- there isn't the presumption in that

authority for the proposition that the -- an -- an

anticipatory breach not accepted by the other party starts

the statute of limitations running?

MR. ROBERTS:

I mean, what case?

My -- my argument is not that this

is an anticipatory breach.

QUESTION:

Even though that's not the law as

MR. ROBERTS:

Yes, given the principles of

should be narrowly construed.

But -- but --

Page 40

1

QUESTION:

But that -- that narrow construction

2

notion, or construed strictly notion, applies to deciding

3

whether there's a waiver by the Government of any

4

privilege of sovereign immunity.

5

yes, the Government did waive it, the Government has said

6

it can be sued, we don't continue to look at every issue

7

and say, oh, it's the Government, we're going to strictly

8

construe it somehow.

9

MR. ROBERTS:

And once we've decided

The Court -- the Court has held

10

several times that statutes of limitations, as conditions

11

on the Government's waiver of its sovereign immunity,

12

should themselves be -- be narrowly construed and has

applied it in -- in cases, for instance, involving a

situation where a private party claimed that the

limitations period didn't run until an administration --

16

administrative determination had been made that there

17

wouldn't be -- that there was a -- was a loss and --

18

QUESTION:

Well, in this sense -- in this sense,

19

the Government actually needs less protection than the

20

private party because the Government at least is in the

21

position where it can always pass a statute of

MR. ROBERTS:

I suppose you could pass a statute of limitations.
MR. ROBERTS:

2

The Government can do that and has

3

done it here, and the statute of limitations provides that

4

when the action first accrues, there are 6 years to sue.

5

And if -- if -QUESTION:

6

Well, but again, I'm back to the

problem.

anticipatory breach, and breach.

the two.
MR. ROBERTS:

In the -- in the ordinary

12

situation, if a private party -- let's -- if -- if I may,

13

let's -- can I pose a hypothetical?

14

private party had promised that you could prepay, that the

15

other party could prepay at any time, and Congress passed

16

a statute that imposed restrictions on prepayment, that

17

statute would be neither an anticipatory repudiation or a

18

breach, but would provide a discharge.

19

If -- if a -- if a

And -- but if the private party had promised,

20

subsidiary to the promise that it would be prepaid at any

21

time, that there -- that notwithstanding passage of

legislation, that if -- if there was legislation passed

23

that -- that -- excuse me -- that the private party had

promised that legislation wouldn't be passed or had

promised to indemnify, notwithstanding the passage of

Page 42
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

legislation, then there would be a breach at the time the

legislation is passed.

And the Government has to make that promise, and

petitioners have alleged that the Government made that

That's what -- that's what they lost on the

your argument.

I see that.

I think I understand

It doesn't work with the private party.

10

Your analogy isn't so great because it's not the private

11

party who can pass the law.

12

But I think your argument is that unlike private

13

contracts, many, many, many Government contracts have the

14

following problem in them which was in Mobil.

15

parties here saying that if Congress passes a law, that

that kind of a contract issue is breached when Congress

15

MR. ROBERTS:

QUESTION:

17
18

Yes.

Okay.

And that's special for

Government.
And now all I would like on that is:

A, does

19

that apply to administrative regulations too; and B,

20

what's the authority for that?

21

MR. ROBERTS:

Okay.

It would apply to

22

administrative regulations if -- if that was the -- the

23

issue whether the promise -- if -- if the issue was there

24

wouldn't be regulations -- different regulations that

25

imposed restrictions on prepayment.

were promulgated.

They have the effect of law.

The authority for that is the -- is the

Winstar case, that's recognized in Bowen v. Posse, that's

But if it's just a

background principle, I would worry about the practical

9

consequence being of people, particularly in real estate

10

11

in order to tell their clients what to do.

12

investors are nervous people sometimes.

And if it does, sue

Now, that -- that's the practical thing I brought up

18

at the beginning, and if we're trying to say what's the

19

right legal principle, I think that practical problem is

20

relevant.

21

MR. ROBERTS:

Okay.

And then to return to the

22

-- to practical considerations that -- that we think argue

23

in our favor on that side, that's because the Government

24

has a prompt interest in -- has a -- has a strong interest

25

in a prompt accounting of the costs of legislative action.

And it's particularly important that -- it's -- it's

consequences of the enactment.

that Congress --

MR. ROBERTS:

And it's also important

Which it could enact by repealing --- be able to cause a --

It could enact -- the -- the Congress

that's close to the first one could say, okay, we'll

10

repeal it.

11

problems I have with your argument.

12

legislation is magic, and you can't have an anticipatory

13

repudiation because when Congress has spoken, that's it.

14

But in this very case, Congress goes back and forth a

15

couple of times.

16

And that's, Mr. Roberts, one of the major

MR. ROBERTS:

Yes.

You seem to say that

Congress can repeal the

17

legislation, but it doesn't change the fact that during

18

the -- the period the legislation was in effect that

19

there's an alteration of legal rights, and there's also,

20

if there was a promise that -- that the -- that the rights

21

wouldn't be changed, a breach during that time.

22

And although Congress did -- although Congress

23

did repeal the statute here, it -- it's far less likely in

24

the ordinary situation that Congress is going to repeal

25

statutes than it is that a private party is going to

Alderson Reporting Company

1

change its mind about its intention to repudiate a -- a

2

contract, and -QUESTION:

3

Well, Mr. -- Mr. Roberts, in the case

4

in which the Government, we'll assume, doesn't change its

5

mind, your argument in -- in response to Justice Breyer's

6

question seems to boil down to something like this.

7

the poor Government as the contract breaker because it may

8

not know just how much damage it's causing.

9

put a burden on the people harmed by the Government's

Pity

Therefore,

10

breach of contract to run in in a hurry and let the

11

Government know early on just how much damage it has

12

caused.
Why should the burden of the Government's breach

13
14

of contract be shifted entirely for limitations purposes

15

to the victims of the breach?
MR. ROBERTS:

16

When -- when there's a present --

17

when there's a breach, the general principle is the

18

statute of limitations starts to run at the time of the

19

breach.

20

It doesn't wait to run until -QUESTION:

No, but your -- no, but your

21

argument, as I understand it, is that because of the

22

Government's peculiar power to pass legislation, the

23

Government should not be in the position of the usual

24

contract breaker who may be subject to an anticipatory

25

breach claim or an actual breach claim later.

You're

Page 47
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

saying the Government should be subject only to one claim

2

at the first moment that an anticipatory breach claim

3

should be brought.

4

the Government ought to have a right to make its victims

5

come in and tell it as early as possible how much damage

6

it has caused.

7

has a legislative power, have that kind of a moral claim

8

that the private contract breaker does not have?

And your argument for saying that is

Why does the Government, simply because it

MR. ROBERTS:

9

There's this -- there's a -- a

10

very strong interest in permitting the Government to -- in

11

permitting Congress to decide it wants to wrap up the

costs of improvident Federal contracts that they have -QUESTION:

13

Then why don't we let Congress -- why

14

don't we let Congress survey through the departments of

15

the Government how many contracts it has entered into or

16

guaranteed and tote up the damages in advance?

17

18

get it.
MR. ROBERTS:

In other words, the Government may

get off a little cheaper if it puts the burden on the

MR. ROBERTS:

Page 48
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

dispute here as to whether the contract made this promise

2

or not, and the Government doesn't -- doesn't know how

3

that dispute is going to be resolved.

4

that -- that there was a promise that prepayment would not

5

be subject to subsequent legislation.

6

QUESTION:

We don't believe

Well, certainly general contract law

7

is not -- you know, you could say it from the point of

8

view of general contract law, it's important that people

9

who breach contracts know as soon as possible how much

10

damage they've done, but obviously that doctrine has not

11

commended itself in the area of general contract law.

12

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, when they breach a contract

13

and it's a breach, the statute of limits does start to run

14

and the rule is that even if the damages can't be fully

15

ascertained, that -- that the statute of limitations run.

16

And that's true with -- if -- if there was a contract

17

between one party to -- to employ another party for the

18

other party's life and that contract was breached, the

19

statute of limitations would run at the date of breach

20

even though it wouldn't be possible with certainty to know

21

the length of the damages.

22

of warranty of merchantability --

23

QUESTION:

A -- a contract for a breach

I think it's so hard to look at this

24

as an actual breach if we take it on the assumption there

25

was a contractual right of prepayment on demand by the

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

borrower.

I would think normally you would wait and see

2

if and when there was a request for repayment -- or early

3

payment, and you wouldn't really know that, of course,

with a -- the owner of real estate who goes out and he

5

gets a low interest loan from the Government to develop

conditions to the circumstances of the prepayment.

MR. ROBERTS:

I wouldn't think you'd treat it as

Even under the scenario you posed

14

that -- that there wasn't an incentive to prepay right at

15

the moment, there's still a -- a change in what -- in --

16

in the loan that petitioners have, and it's a loan where

17

they no longer have that option to prepay with unfettered

19

QUESTION:

No.

As I read the legislation, there

20

still is consideration of the possibility of prepayment,

but there are some new conditions imposed whereby the

Government tries to assure itself that there will still be

a certain number of low-income housing units out there on

the market.

QUESTION:

-- is really different because of

2

this.

3

not -- I'm not saying I do -- that the Government was

4

really different for that reason, then this is a unique

5

kind of case and maybe we should have a different rule as

purpose, maybe it ought to be unique as to whether these

8

people who don't know what their damages are at this point

9

have to sue right away or it can wait until -- until they

Now, if I believed that the Government -- and I'm

it.

Would that make you happy?
MR. ROBERTS:

All -- all I can say to that, Your

14

Honor, is that -- that there are many situations in which

15

damages cannot be ascertained fully.

16

situations in which courts have confronted situations

17

where the damages can't -- no measurable damages could be

18

found at all at the time of breach, and they hold that it

19

-- it runs from the breach.

20

In fact, there are

And the -- the policy arguments on our side are

21

the -- the Government's interest in a prompt accounting,

22

in being able to wrap things up and in not having --

Well, but the Government has --

3

areas.

And to adopt the kind of proposal you're making

discourages anyone from dealing with the Government.

7

a very peculiar rule.

9

You might want to be able to buy certain things

MR. ROBERTS:

It's

I -- I don't think it discourages

them, Your Honor, because they -- they can sue and their

10

damages are measurable, and they can get the damages.

likelihood that interest rates are going to go up or that

12

interest rates are going to go down and -- and other

13

possibilities are -- are reflected in the -- in the change

time.

The

And -- and if petitioners think they might be

17

able to prepay later, subject to the restrictions, so they

18

wouldn't be injured in that way, they can sue, get their

19

damages and then they'll be subject to the restrictions in

20

the program.

21

And if they prepay and -- and the restrictions

22

don't prevent them in any way from prepaying or don't

23

impose any limitations on them, then they've gotten the

24

damages for what they've lost and they also get the

25

ability to prepay.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFF H. ECKLAND

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. ECKLAND:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

it please the Court:
The Government has not been able to cite to one

7
8

case in which a congressional statute has been treated

9

differently, in other words, that it constitutes an

10

May

immediate breach of a contract.
In the petitioners' briefs, we have a total of

11
12

six cases that make the distinction between a

13

congressional statute as being merely a repudiation and

14

the breach not occurring until there has been some adverse

15

agency action.

16

Plaintiffs in Winstar-Related cases, Bank of America, and

17

Conoco.

18

Schism, and Stone Forrest.

19

Plaintiffs in Winstar-Related cases and Bank of America,

20

dealt with the statute of limitations and have ruled in

21

favor of the petitioners' position advocated here.

22

In the Court of Federal Claims, we've got

The Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, Far West,
And two of those cases,

Congress makes policy.

It directs agencies what

23

to do, and petitioners maintain that in that sense it is

24

no real different than a board of directors of a

25

corporation.

A board of directors can direct the CEO or a

directive or that change in bylaw by a board of directors

does not constitute a breach.

5

the program manager or CEO actually fails to perform at

6

the time that performance comes due.

7

It's merely a repudiatory

The -- the breach does not ripen unless and until

Here it's clear that since the petitioners can

8

reach their central right of opting out of this program

9

upon prepayment -- and the statistics show that -- it

10

can't be that the statute is an immediate breach.

11

breach occurs only if and when the agency acts and denies

12

a prepayment request.

13

A

In closing, Your Honors, petitioners here

14

understand that as U.S. citizens they have an obligation

15

to follow the law and to know the law.

16

Government enticed the petitioners into this program by

17

holding out a 50-year option term, only to withdraw it

18

upon the time that the petitioners built the properties.

19

But here the

If the Government is not willing to give the

20

petitioners the benefit of their bargain, fundamental

21

considerations of fairness at least require that they get

22

the benefit of the doubt and that these ordinary

23

principles of law regarding the accrual of breach of

24

contract and takings claims should be able to be invoked

25

by the petitioners such that they do not need to file suit
