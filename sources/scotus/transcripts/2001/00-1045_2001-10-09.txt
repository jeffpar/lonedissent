ORAL ARGUMENT OF GLEN D. NAGER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

MR. NAGER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

10

In this case, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth

11

Circuit held that the statute of limitations on a claim of

12

improper disclosure under the Fair Credit Reporting Act

13

does not commence until the plaintiff discovers her

14

injury, as opposed to the -- the date of the improper

15

disclosure.

16

In doing so, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth

17

Circuit did not parse the language of the statute of

18

limitations that is in the Fair Credit Reporting Act, but

19

rather said that language was not sufficiently expressed

20

to overcome a presumption in favor of a discovery rule

21

that the Ninth Circuit held is read into that statute and

22

all Federal statutes.

23

25

QUESTION:

When did the injury occur here to the

respondent?
MR. NAGER:

QUESTION:

5

when exactly did the injury --

6

MR. NAGER:

I mean, when --

Well, there were four allegedly

7

improper disclosures at issue in this case.

8

in July of 1994, and when that disclosure was made, it

revealed --

it, although the -- the way these reporting systems work,

17

if they ever actually apply for credit themselves and

18

they're denied, they will automatically know about it,

which of course is what happened to the respondent in this

20

case.

21
22
23

She didn't know about the -QUESTION:

But it -- it's a 2-year statute of

limitations.
MR. NAGER:

That's correct, and the statute

expressly states that the action must be filed within 2

25

years of the date upon which liability arises.

Is this the type of statute that --

that depends largely on private enforcement to implement

it?

It does have private causes of

The Federal Trade Commission, of course, also has

But in general, I think you would

look at this as one that envisions private enforcement.
MR. NAGER:

Absolutely, Justice O'Connor.

We

don't dispute that.
But what is does envision is private enforcement

13

within 2 years of the date of disclosures.

14

the statute expressly says on its face.

has to be brought within 2 years from the date upon which

liability arises.

And we know under

22

this statute, section 616 and 617, which specify what a

liability with a failure of a defendant to comply with a

requirement of the section.

nominal damages and punitive damages?

MR. NAGER:

Well, it's unclear under statute

whether you can get nominal damages.

willful violation of the statute, which is what the

What this statute does is -- the credit

reporting companies have computer databases that compile

information about credit reporting histories of

6

individuals.

7

subscribers, banks, insurance companies, and the like.

8

And a creditor can go onto that database, just like your

9

law clerks can go on Westlaw, and pull off information.

And it makes that database available to

10

And when they pull that information off, if there weren't

11

reasonable procedures in place to prevent them from

12

improperly pulling information off, that would be an

13

improper disclosure, which would injure the person because

14

it would invade their privacy and reveal confidential

15

information about themselves.

possibly would have a claim for invasion of privacy, or if

there was inaccurate information in the database, for

I don't know -How do the statutes run?

Do they --

I don't --- normally run from -- from the date

7

finds out about it?

8
9

MR. NAGER:

At the time of enactment of this

statute, the -- the statutes of limitations of which I'm

10

aware of at State law, ran from the date of the -- of the

11

disclosure, not from the date of discovery.

12

typical in the 1969-1970 time frame for invasion of

13

privacy claims and for defamation claims.

14

That was

And we also know that this statute is one of six

15

titles of the Consumer Credit Protection act, and we know

16

that each of the statutes of limitations in those other

17

five titles run from the date of alleged violation.

18

QUESTION:

We would have been sure about that if

19

the language in the initial bill, which was the date of

20

the occurrence of the violation -- if that language had

21

been used.

22

which would have been clear, it seems to me that the

23

phrase that they did use, when liability arises, is

24

ambiguous.

25

Since Congress chose not to use that language,

1

Justice Ginsburg, but let me make the case for why that's

2

not a correct conclusion to draw from the premise.

3

It obviously would have been simpler if they had

4

used the language from the date of violation, but they

5

used a phrase that means the same thing.

6

made the change --

7
8
9

QUESTION:

And when they

How do we know it means the same

thing?
MR. NAGER:

We know it means the same thing

10

because every time this Court has had a case that has used

11

the term arise, it has said that means the date upon which

12

the event happens, not the date upon which someone

13

discovers it later.

14

And we know in section 616 and 617 of this

15

statute that liability is defined by reference to the acts

16

of the defendant.

17

And we also know that there is an explicit

18

exception in section 618, the statute of limitations

19

provision, which does expressly refer to a discovery rule,

20

but it says the discovery rule is applied in the case of a

21

willful and material misrepresentation of a disclosure

22

required by the statute.

23

the inclusion of an express reference to the discovery

24

rule and the exception is that the general rule doesn't

25

include a discovery.

MR. NAGER:

Do you think anything turns on that?
No, I don't.

And I -- I would point

you to the Court's decision in the Bay Area Laundry case,

which was dealing with the Multi-Employer Pension Plan

That is correct.

The Court can also

assume, since these are the allegations in this case, for

purposes of considering this issue, you could consider

17

that the failure to maintain procedures was in fact

intentional because they've, in fact, proceeded under the

It's in the nature of this statutory scheme and

the subject matter that it's dealing with that the claims

quickly.

critical to presenting one of those claims is not in the

crediting reporting agencies give the information to.

9

The reason is, is all of the information that's

It's either in our computer

And that's why when Congress passed this

10

statute, it said that there were going to be certain

11

disclosures that it was going to require either the credit

12

reporting agencies to make or the creditors to make.

13

it also specified, because of concerns about the burdens

14

of record keeping, quite finite periods of time by which

15

those records would have to be kept.

16

statute was passed, a credit reporting agency only had to

17

keep a list of who a disclosure was made to for 6 months,

18

and now, as amended in 1996, they only have to keep it for

19

a year.

20

But

So, at the time the

And at the time the statute was passed, there

21

was no requirement placed upon a subscriber to our

22

database, one of the creditors, for any time period they

23

had to keep their own records.

24

Credit Opportunity Act was passed, and the Federal Reserve

25

1

keep records of any action it takes to deny credit for up

2

to 25 months.

3

But the fact of the matter is, because of -- of

4

the enormous amounts of information that are retained, the

5

record retention policies of credit reporting agencies and

6

creditors, pursuant to guidance received from the Federal

7

Reserve Board and the Federal Trade Commission -- record

retention -- we -- we get rid of those records at the end

9

of 2 years as a credit reporting agency, and the banks get

10
11

rid of them after 25 months.
QUESTION:

So, the claims --

I don't understand.

You mean if I

12

apply for credit and TRW checks me out, they're only

13

interested in the last 2 years?

14

MR. NAGER:

The underlying credit information is

15

preserved, as long as it's not negative, forever.

16

negative, the statute prohibits the credit reporting

17

agencies for retaining it for more than 7 months.

18

If it's

But remember what the -- the claim is is an

19

improper disclosure.

So, what you have to know is, is who

20

was the information disclosed to and when.

21

the -- that's a separate data field.

22

statute, that list has to only be maintained for a year

23

after 1996 by the credit reporting agency.

24

way to find out that a disclosure has been made is either

25

within a year -- or we actually keep it for 2 years

So, the only

1

because, in the case of an employment application, you

2

have to keep it for 2 years, or from the creditor, and

3

they only keep it for 25 months.

4

What that means is, is that claims that aren't

5

discovered within 2 years that would be preserved under

6

this statute -- the underlying records that would -- would

7

reliably prove whether a disclosure has been made and

contained an inaccuracy won't exist.

partners who practice in this area regularly that their

5

6

QUESTION:

No -- no State has a record

But one of the arguments you make, if

7

I remember correctly, was the Ninth Circuit is -- is a

8

large area, so we -- whatever they say is going to govern

9

for the Nation because we can't keep our books one way for

10

California and another way for someplace else.

11

California is a pretty large State.

Well, we would go -- in response to

16

the Chief Justice's question, as long as the Federal law

longer than the present 1-year requirement, we're not

going to keep the records for any longer --

22

doesn't matter, as far as your record keeping is --

I would suggest is it would leave the courts and our

the records are gone, it will be left -- we will be left

2

defending against claims that are based upon quite

3

unreliable evidence, and the courts will be left

4

adjudicating claims that are based upon quite unreliable

5

evidence because the underlying documents won't exist.

6

And the reason that I would like to make that

7

point to the Court, Justice Ginsburg, is because the very

8

most fundamental purpose of a statute of repose -- of the

repose aspect of a statute of limitations is to prevent

10

society and its courts from being burdened with claims

11

that can't be reliably proved.

corresponds very naturally with the liability provisions

of section 616 and -- and section 617.

implication of the misrepresentation exception, which has

an express reference to a discovery rule -- and as you

noted, Justice Ginsburg, both the Senate and the House

I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice.

The

Ninth Circuit in this case said that in the absence of an

rule into this statute -- into this statute irrespective

11

of the particular words this statute chose to use.

12

there's a basic -- there are two aspects to the Ninth

13

Circuit's ruling.

14

discovery rule, and secondly, that they'll apply that

default rule in every case under every Federal statute

had a particular intent.
All of the courts of appeals that have embraced

3

a discovery rule as a default rule have said in the

silence of Congress, not in the ambiguity of Congress.

5

QUESTION:

So, you're not asking us to say, no,

6

there's no discovery rule.

7

can find Congress otherwise intent -- intended from

8

something that's not an express negation.

MR. NAGER:

But what you're saying is you

Our primary position in this case is

10

that this statute, when you look at the term, liability

11

arise, when -- when the Court looks at the

12

misrepresentation exception, when it looks at the

13

definitions of liability in sections 616 and 617, the only

14

reasonable construction of this statute is that the basic

15

statute of limitations rule is the traditional complete

16

cause of action.

17

QUESTION:

But -- but all that the Court must do

18

to hold in your favor is to say you've got an express

19

misrepresentation exception.

Then that's it.

MR. NAGER:

That's correct.

21

We would also say if the Court chose to decide

22

what kind of default rule should be applied in -- in this

23

-- in this case or in Federal cases generally, that the

24

Ninth Circuit's opinion vastly overstates the support and

25

authority for using a discovery rule as a default rule.

This Court for 150 years at least has said that

the traditional rule is the complete cause of action rule.

This Court has made exceptions to the complete cause of

12

in his dissent, an injury rule would be the thing that

makes the most sense in the commercial context and the

odd thing about this is that the four courts of appeals

2

that have misconstrued the statute in my view have looked

3

at this and have said, that which is clearly additive

4

should be read so as to subtract from the main provision

5

in -- in a substantial way.

6

when Congress intended to simply add something, that is

clearly for the benefit of consumers, and that provides 2

QUESTION:

Well, the reason that I think I'm

12

having such difficulty with it is because on your theory,

the statute doesn't begin to run till discovery anyway.

14

So, you have to imagine a case where the only way -- the

15

thing didn't begin till discovery.

16

supposed to be doing some work?

17

mean, it seems you have to think of very weird cases, very

18

unusual cases before you could imagine a situation where

the proviso would serve any function at all on your

theory, which is it doesn't run till discovery anyway.

MR. HENDERSON:

QUESTION:

Fully aware is correct.

Well, and if he is not fully aware on

your theory, the underlying statute didn't begin to run.

14

MR. HENDERSON:

That -- I beg to differ, Justice

15

Breyer.

It's -- full awareness is the kind of full

full awareness of all the elements, including the breach

Okay?

That's basically what it's about.

it's hard for me to find examples that would be

Gladly, Justice Breyer.

11

some facts to show you how the misrepresentation exception

12

would work.

14

1994 and January 1995, and she had no reason to know that

because she had not suffered any injury as a result of

these completely latent privacy breaches, and in fact, she

could have gone to her grave never knowing about them.

she found out about them, and she immediately asked for

3

Now, TRW, the defendant in this case, did not

misrepresent any facts, did not, for example, conceal

those four privacy breaches.

had they sent back to here a letter, in which they had

concealed the four privacy breaches, then she would still

that the equitable estoppel might apply even if they had

of this Court have recognized, for example, when -- when

this Court declined the opportunity to apply a Federal
