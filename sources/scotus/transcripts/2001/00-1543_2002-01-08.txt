ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT H. BORK

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10
11

MR. BORK:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:

12

I refer to them as SMC.

13

(Laughter.)

14

MR. BORK:

The Federal circuit's rules in this

15

case ought to be reversed because it flatly contradicts

16

this Court's decision in Warner-Jenkinson, and

17

furthermore, it radically undermines the patent system.

18

think Warner-Jenkinson should be reaffirmed because it's

19

in keeping with the Patent Act, with the goals and

20

policies of the patent system, and because it is much

21

fairer than the harsh inequities of this new rule which

22

this case presents a prime example.

I

Warner -- let me discuss the crucial differences

23
24

between Warner-Jenkinson and the Federal circuit's new

25

rules.

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

In the first place, Warner-Jenkinson holds that

2

prosecution history estoppel arises only when an amendment

3

to a patent surrenders subject matter -- and clearly

4

surrenders it -- in order to achieve patentability.

5

Federal circuit holds to the contrary that any narrowing

6

amendment, regardless of the reason for it, creates

7

prosecution history estoppel.

8
9

The

Second, the Warner-Jenkinson case holds that the
reason for an amendment determines whether an estoppel is

10

created.

11

the reason is irrelevant, and if an amendment has the

12

narrowing effect, intended or not, it creates a complete

13

estoppel.

14

claims to be imprecise and the applicant made an amendment

15

to clarify what the examiner thought was imprecise, that

16

might be held to be a narrowing amendment and the patent

17

would be unenforceable.

18

Festo in this case.

19

with Warner-Jenkinson.

20

The Federal circuit denies that and holds that

Thus, if the patent examiner said he found the

And that is what happened to

And those results cannot be squared

Third, the Federal circuit holds that an

21

amendment creates an estoppel if it applies to any of the

22

statutory requirements for obtaining a patent, not just

23

patent -- not just patentability as defined by the Patent

24

Act, but any of the requirements for obtaining a patent.

25

Now, the Patent Act makes clear a distinction

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

between patentability and other requirements.

2

101 through 103 come under the heading of patentability of

3

inventions, and they state the substantive requirements

for getting a patent.

5

must not be obvious.

patentability known in the law.

8

in Graham against John Deere confirms that.

9

requirement of the statute relates to patentability.

10

Sections

The invention must be new and

It must be not found in the prior art, and it
Those are the only elements of
And this Court's opinion
No other

The Federal circuit holds to the contrary, that

11

an amendment affecting any of the statutory requirements

12

for getting a patent may generate estoppel, and those

13

requirements include sections 111 and 112 of the act.

14

those sections relate to the form of the application and

15

not to the subject matter sought to be patented.
QUESTION:

16

But

Is it clear most of the time, Mr.

17

Bork, whether the amendment is for purposes of 103, 111,

18

and 112?

19

tell at a glance whether it's a 103 or a 111 and 112

20

purpose that generated the amendment?

21

Can you pick up the patent history and -- and

MR. BORK:

I think one can.

For example, in

22

this case you'll see in the Stoll patent -- there are two

23

patents, of course, in play here, the Stoll patent and the

24

Carroll patent.

25

that he objects on the grounds that the claim is stated in

In this case, the patent examiner says

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

an improper form, is multiply dependent, and also that

2

it's imprecise.

3

is quite clear that those are 111 and 112 objections, not

4

to the subject matter sought to be patented.

5

He's not sure what it means.

QUESTION:

Now, that

But if you're the applicant and you

6

get that response from the Patent Office, during the

7

course of the amendment might you not rethink and -- and

8

clarify what you're doing under 103 as well?

9

what --

10

MR. BORK:

That's

Oh, if the -- if the applicant

11

decides to amend in a way that surrenders subject matter,

12

it disclaims subject matter, the fact that the process

13

began with a -- with the examiner's on grounds of form

14

doesn't affect it.

15

subject matter is gone and the equivalents to it are gone

16

too.

17

QUESTION:

If he surrenders subject matter, that

But wasn't that the argument here

18

with reference to the seals and the magnetized or

19

demagnetized cylinder?

20

MR. BORK:

There was an argument to that effect,

21

but if you look at the patent -- at the prosecution

22

history which is of both the Stoll and the Carroll

23

patents, which are in the volume 2 of the transcript,

24

there is no abandonment of any subject matter.

25

In the Stoll patent, there is no abandonment of

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

subject matter.

2

However, the subject matter which was abandoned had no

3

relevance to the lawsuit.

4

sued on, so that there is, in operational terms, no

5

disclaimer or surrender of subject matter in either of

6

these patents.

7

In the Carroll patent, there is.

QUESTION:

It wasn't what was -- what was

Mr. Bork, both the Solicitor General

8

and an amicus, the IEEE, suggest that a -- a different

9

flexible bar test would be appropriate.

10

Would you comment

on those two proposals?
MR. BORK:

11

Justice O'Connor, I think they're

12

much too narrow.

The only rationale that makes any sense

13

as to a flexible bar proposal or any bar proposal is that

14

if you've disclaimed something, then the equivalent of

15

subject matter -- the equivalents to the disclaimed

16

subject matter are barred by estoppel, but other

17

equivalents that don't go to what was surrendered are not

18

barred.

19

question of the scope of the bar, relates closely to the

20

question -- the first question presented in this case --

Therefore, the -- the rule of the -- the bar, the

21

QUESTION:

Let's say there's --

22

MR. BORK:

-- as to what was surrendered.

23

QUESTION:

Let's say there's an amendment under

24

103 where -- where you agree that there can be an

25

estoppel.

Should there be a presumption there?

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. BORK:

A presumption -- if there is a clear

2

surrender, there's no presumption.

3

a waiver.

4

unclear what -- why you have done it, then this Court in

5

Warner-Jenkinson says there be a remand under a

6

presumption that what you did was for purposes of

7

patentability, what you surrendered was for purposes of

8

patentability, and if you cannot rebut that presumption,

9

then you lose.

10

It's -- it's a -- it's

It's -- you've estopped yourself.

QUESTION:

If it's

Wasn't it more, Mr. Bork, than just a

11

presumption if you couldn't -- I thought Warner-Jenkinson

12

said where you do not establish any reason for the

13

amendment, the Court did use the word presume.

14

the Court should presume that the patent application has a

15

substantial reason relating to patentability.

16

the following sentence is, in those circumstances,

17

prosecution history estoppel would bar the application of

18

the doctrine of equivalents.

19

an absolute bar rule, that if you don't -- if the reason

20

is unexplained, the consequence is a complete bar.
MR. BORK:

21
22

that.

23

express myself well.

24
25

It said

And then

So, that sounds to me like

Oh, well, consequence is a bar as to

Yes, as to that area.

But I guess I perhaps didn't

If the appellate court, this Court, looks and
says, I don't know the reason -- as in Warner-Jenkinson,

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

it was unclear why there was a lower limit of pH 6 set on

2

that process -- I don't know -- I don't know why you

3

amended to set that lower limit, there is a presumption

4

that you did it for a reason related to patentability,

5

which would create a complete bar.

6

you get a chance to rebut that presumption with evidence.

7

If you don't rebut it, it's a bar.

8
9

QUESTION:

However, on remand,

The -- the Federal circuit is

supposed to be an expert in this and they say that

10

inventors or people who are trying to invent things are

11

supposed to be able to read the claims, and that's it.

12

And if you didn't make your claim properly, particularly

13

when you had a second chance, that's your problem, and any

14

other system -- any other system is going to really go

15

back to what used to be called central claiming where the

16

claims point to rather than define the invention.

17

that's just not workable today.

18

claim in every case.

19

where the lawyer couldn't really do anything about it.

20

That's called unforeseeability.

And

We'll get an equivalents

And so, let's make an exception

21

MR. BORK:

Well, the fact --

22

QUESTION:

With that possible exception, which

23

they maybe should have mentioned but didn't, it's up to

24

the lawyer and it's his fault.

25

didn't do it properly, we punish him because we have to

And the reason is if he

1

have certainty for people who want to invent other things.

2

Now, that I take it is the heart of what's being said on

3

the other side, and I'd like to know your response.

4
5
6

MR. BORK:

Well, there are a couple of responses

to that, Justice Breyer.
In the first place, let me say that the solution

7

the Federal circuit has devised is -- doesn't relate to

8

the problem.

9

equivalents test, then the answer is to abolish

If the problem is the unworkability of the

10

equivalents, not to -- and that doesn't depend on whether

11

or not there's been an amendment.

12

abolish equivalents, the way to do it, so that you don't

13

have this terrible retroactive effect, is to have the

14

Patent and Trademark Office engage in a rulemaking

15

function, a rulemaking which has a prospective effect

16

only, or have Congress sit down and do a rule -- legislate

17

that has a prospective effect only.

18

QUESTION:

And if you're going to

Would the PTO have authority to do

19

that by regulation in the absence of congressional

20

authorization?

21
22
23
24
25

MR. BORK:

I think it has authorization to do --

to make rules of that sort, Mr. Chief Justice.
But on the -- on the question that -- I'm sorry,
Justice Breyer.
QUESTION:

They're not arguing for abolition.

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

They're not arguing for abolition.

2

MR. BORK:

No --

3

QUESTION:

They're arguing for hold the lawyer

4

to a very tough standard, but a small equitable exception

5

in the instance where the lawyer really couldn't really do

6

anything about it, namely where it's not foreseeable that

7

this kind of really copied device is going to come

8

about --

9

MR. BORK:

Well --

10

QUESTION:

-- because the language isn't -- you

11

know, English doesn't work perfectly, the English

12

language, and because there could be future inventions

13

that might cause that to be unforeseeable.
MR. BORK:

14

That is true, but what they have

15

suggested in effect is that the lawyer put into the

16

literal claims he files a claim for all the equivalents

17

that he can foresee.

18

equivalents, and if he did that, I think you'd have a

19

patent claim that would look roughly like the tax code.
QUESTION:

20

Now, he can't foresee most of the

No, because they have ways of doing

21

it.

22

know, I can't remember.

23

for it where you -- you try to do it in terms of function.

24

There are ways of doing it.

25

They say all the things like, or they say -- you

MR. BORK:

There's a special technical word

Function, way and result.

know, the briefs are filled with them, how -- how easy it

is.

4

side says, oh, really?

5

The other side says, no, no, it's very easy, and your

MR. BORK:

It isn't so easy.

Well, you're referring, I think,

Justice Breyer, to the testing of -- for equivalents

QUESTION:
thinking that.

No, no.

I'm not thinking -- I'm not

I'm thinking there's a -- there is a way

10

of drafting a claim where you put in the claim -- you

don't describe the thing exactly.

12

thing does.

13

MR. BORK:

You describe what the

Well, if you do that, Justice Breyer,

14

I don't think you've solved the problem of unworkability.

15

I don't think it's unworkable in the first place, but I

16

don't think you've solved the problem of the litigation

17

that's going to take place and the difficulty judges are

18

going to have in distinguishing the case that is covered

19

from the case that is not covered.

20

the same problem as you'd get with the application of the

21

doctrine of equivalents.

22

QUESTION:

May I ask?

I think it's exactly

understanding this patent, to be very honest with you.

changes that -- that was made.

magnetic relationship between different elements of the --

10

of the item, and just at first blush, it seemed to me that

a -- that a -- an element that described a nonmagnetic

12

material would be rather important.

it's of no importance.

German patents doesn't do?

24

we have.

25

MR. BORK:

And that's why there's a

If they put before the jury or the

1

judge the question of whether a narrowing has taken place,

2

they'll be litigating just as much and there will be just

3

as much uncertainty as there is on whether this thing is

4

substantially the same as that thing.

5

thing this new rule does not do is eliminate uncertainty.

6

In fact, we will -- it just shifts the area of litigation,

7

so that I don't think that anything is solved by this.

8
9

You -- this -- one

It just -- nothing is solved by it and you pay
an enormous price in terms of future patents.

If you look

10

at future patents, the future patentee knows he's not

11

going to get the same protection he had before because if

12

he dares to amend -- and almost all patents are amended.

13

It's just inevitable.

14

the process goes.

Because there's a lot of -- a lot of

cases in which it's just an infringement, a literal

MR. BORK:

That's true, but if a -- if a --

QUESTION:

And that area is not touched by this.

14

MR. BORK:

No, but if a copyist wants to avoid

15

literal infringement, he takes an amended element and

16

alters it slightly, and he's home free under the Federal

17

circuit rule.

18

device which, for all practical purposes, is identical to

19

the Festo patents and has now destroyed the value of the

20

Festo patents because Festo didn't foresee back in the

21

1980's, when it got these patents, that the Federal

22

circuit was going to change the law as it has in 1997.

23

And I --

24
25

And that's what happened here.

QUESTION:

You have a

described as significant in the claims was really not

significant.

MR. BORK:

I'm not using the right

Well, it's significant enough.

The

-- the fact is that the aluminum alloy -- the alloy makes

it perform the same function as the magnetizable material,

QUESTION:

11

Mr. Bork, would you -- would you

12

comment on the Federal circuit's view that they weren't

really changing anything, but they had two inconsistent

lines of decisions?

either, but whatever it was, everybody went forward on the

2

understanding that the kind of law that was reaffirmed in

3

Warner-Jenkinson was the law.

4

And that's why I find it particularly odd that

5

the Government should say that those people are charged

6

with knowledge back then of what was going to happen now.

7

And that is doubly odd because the Government in

8

Warner-Jenkinson filed a brief taking the position that we

take here today, and now they say that we should have

known better.

11

we would know better.

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

SUPPORTING VACATUR AND REMAND

24
25

QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, Mr. Bork says the

Government has changed its position from the time it filed

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

its brief in Warner-Jenkinson.
MR. WALLACE:

Do you agree with that?

I do not, Mr. Chief Justice.

We

3

did say that amendments made to avoid prior art and

4

amendments made for other purposes relating to securing

5

the patent present different problems because amendments

6

made to avoid prior art are almost always narrowing

7

amendments, and we think that the Federal circuit, in

8

speaking of narrowing amendments, really was speaking of

9

surrendering subject matter which is the formulation that

10

the petitioner prefers; whereas, amendments made for other

11

purposes have to be scrutinized with particular care

12

because they often are not narrowing amendments.

13

indeed, in some of the post-Festo decisions of the Federal

14

circuit, the court has held that there was -- it was not a

15

narrowing amendment and therefore there's no bar.

And

16

But they can be narrowing amendments.

They can

17

be, even though in the guise of addressing the examiner's

18

concern under 112, they could actually be narrowing the

19

subject matter of the claim.

20

the estoppel would apply.

And in that instance, the --

21

QUESTION:

How does one figure that out?

Give

22

us a -- an example.

23

difficult to figure out, that -- that the new system

24

that's -- that's been brought in is -- is as complicated

25

to administer in -- in the courts as -- as the old.

Part of the argument is this is very

21
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. WALLACE:

A simple example would be in

2

Warner-Jenkinson itself.

If there was an addition of a

3

limitation on the pH levels from 6 to 9 in the amendment,

4

if the examiner in that case had said that the

5

specifications are not clear enough and that amendment was

6

added in response to that, even though the examiner had

7

raised other concerns, but the applicant purported to add

8

that limitation in response to the examiner's concerns

9

about the specificity, it still would be adding a

10

limitation and it would be an implied disclaimer of

11

subject matter in comparison with the initial claim.

12

our view would be that estoppel would apply.

13

QUESTION:

And

But the idea of estoppel, as I

14

understand it, is that a person is prevented from taking

15

contrary positions, and it seems to me in your example

16

that it's not necessarily a contrary position.

17

MR. WALLACE:

Well, it's contrary in the sense

18

of what fair inferences can be drawn by the public from

19

the record of the prosecution history.

20

off -- the applicant started off without this limitation

21

and then added the limitation, the limitation speaks for

22

itself in narrowing the scope of the claim elements.

23

that -- that is the central problem of this case.

24
25

When he started

And

If prosecution history estoppel is to have
meaningful effect, once we settle where it applies, which

22
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

seems to me to be the lesser question, it necessarily

2

follows, if it's to have meaningful effect, that the claim

3

elements that have been narrowed by the patent applicant,

4

in order to secure the issuance of the patent, cannot be

5

afforded the same or almost the same protection against

6

non-literal infringement that would be available to them

7

under the doctrine of equivalents if they had not been

8

narrowed.

9

QUESTION:

Is there -- is there a way of doing

10

this?

11

rule is a crude effort to deal with a problem that may

12

have the adverse consequences that -- that Mr. Bork

13

predicted.

14

Now, is there a way under the law that they could have the

15

authority to change their minds if it turns out that this

16

experiment doesn't work?

17

Look, the Federal circuit itself thinks that its

And if so, they'll want to change their minds.

MR. WALLACE:

Well, I -- I think so.

These are

18

doctrines that have been developed.

19

estoppel and its effects are really equitable in origin,

20

and the courts have the authority to reexamine the

21

application of equitable doctrines in light of experience.

22

Prosecution history

The -- the real question here, as we see it, is

23

what -- how do you reconcile the inferences that are

24

legitimately to be drawn by the public with the

25

patentholder's need for protection from unfair copying.

23
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

And this is not a matter of small moment because if -- the

2

doctrine of equivalents does not apply, but the all-

3

elements test still is applicable, as the opinions below

4

reflect, to claims of literal infringement or non-literal

5

infringement.

6

So, we have suggested an answer that we draw

7

directly from this Court's decisions.

8

Exhibit Supply, a 1942 decision, in which the Court said

9

that when the applicant narrows the claim, he necessarily

10

is recognizing the difference between what was originally

11

acclaimed -- claimed and what the narrowing amendment

12

claims, and there's an implied disclaimer of all that is

13

embraced within that difference.

And he's recognizing the

14

significance of that difference.

And it -- the Court

15

cited a number of its prior decisions at that time.

16

We first look at

So, we think that applicants have been fairly on

17

notice that prosecution history estoppel does apply to

18

narrowing amendments and that there is considerable risk

19

in narrowing claims and that they have to do that with

20

great care with that in mind.

21

QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, the Government is

22

proposing a change, a backing off from what the CAFC did,

23

but proposing some new formulation or test.

24

test you propose differ from that proposed by the

MR. WALLACE:

foreseeability somehow.
MR. WALLACE:

Yes, but they start by assuming

7

the validity of the flexible bar rule and trying to

8

tighten it a little bit.

9

appeals was right.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. WALLACE:

We think that the court of

And so do you apparently.
Well, we -- we think the court of

12

appeals was right in saying that the way the -- it has

13

been applying the flexible bar rule did not properly

14

recognize what had been surrendered in the course of the

15

prosecution history estoppel.

16

much the same place at the end even though the differences

17

between those and the Federal Bar Association also

18

recommends a presumption and shift of the burden of proof

19

similar to ours, but they're -- they're unwilling to

20

recognize that everything, as the Court said in Exhibit

21

Supply, that was surrendered is necessarily part of the

22

implied disclaimer.

23

to your 9 pH in Warner-Jenkinson, as long as you could

24

show that you could have claimed 10, we should treat that

25

the same as if you did claim 10.

But we -- we come out in

They say, well, even if you went down

We think that the

25
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

inferences to be drawn by the public from the prosecution

2

history estoppel are not that loose.

3

But we do think the court of appeals went too

4

far in saying that applicants were on notice that an

5

absolute bar would necessarily apply to all claims, and we

6

have made our suggestions about burden of proof and

7

presumptions to afford further protection in cases where

8

the applicant -- the patentholder can show that it would

9

be unfair to treat --

10

QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, with respect to that,

11

your second possibility, the second kind of escape hatch

12

for the patentholder, as I understand it, relates to a

13

case in which, in effect, it was impossible to be any more

14

precise, to exclude any more precisely than they did.

15

question is, doesn't that in effect invite the

16

patentholder to make that kind of a claim in every case?

17

And if that is, in fact, going to be an exception to

18

absolute bar, doesn't it mean that we're going to litigate

19

it in every case?
MR. WALLACE:

20

My

Well, we're quite worried about

21

that.

We caution that the versatility of language

22

requires skepticism about that, but we -- we were also

23

sensitive about the difficulties in some particular areas

24

of new technology, biotechnology, and the like, although I

25

pressed the Patent Office and they couldn't come up with a

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. NEUSTADT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
First, I'd like to direct a response to Justice
Breyer's question concerning that section of the statute

10

that -- that you were looking for.

11

6, which says that you can claim the function of an

12

element and you get protection for everything that has

13

that function if it is the same as what's in the

14

specification or its equivalent.

15

That's 112, paragraph

Next, I'd like to address my attention to

Justice Stevenson's question with respect to literal

of all the cases that were decided by the Federal circuit

with respect to that element, but someone who originally

2

framed the claim in the way that you ended up with does

3

not have the same opportunity to rely on equivalents that

4

you do.

Would you comment on that?

5

MR. NEUSTADT:

That is correct.

This was a point that this Court addressed in

Exhibit Supply and that is because claims are not

1

some sort of certainty in the area, to say that the

2

Federal circuit has now come up with a relatively new

doctrine but they're free to change it if it doesn't work

is not the most auspicious recommendation for that

doctrine.

QUESTION:

I presume it would be changed

MR. NEUSTADT:

Well, I don't -- I don't think

10

it's going to be changed, and I don't think there's

11

anything retroactive because the Federal circuit decision

12

was entirely consistent with this Court's precedent in

13

Exhibit Supply and also Warner-Jenkinson.

14

15

change to avoid prior art for that particular element, he

disclaims and abandons everything between --

what they did was follow what this Court said in Warner-

Jenkinson concerning what relates to patentability.

Court in Warner-Jenkinson said -- this Court -- that --

that we have used this with respect to prior art, citing

purpose.

What the Federal circuit did was they said --

and there was almost virtually unanimity on the court, 11

10

to 1 -- that when you make this narrowing for a purpose

11

related to patentability or for a statutory requirement

12

for patentability, then the public can view that and

13

recognize and rely upon it.

14

you will, 102 and 103 to 112 was of very little extension

at all.

So, the extension from, if

for the public with respect to giving the exclusivity to

the patentee is they get an enabling disclosure.

Enabling disclosure is 112, so 112 is just not form.

The quid pro quo

If there

If you are talking about form and clarification,

8

usually when you clarify a claim, you don't narrow it and

9

so the result is that would not be controlled by the

10

Federal circuit rule.

11

What the Federal circuit --

12

QUESTION:

Well, is -- is that really so?

I

13

mean, every time you have a vague claim, you at least have

14

an opportunity to say, well, it covers more than a

15

contrasting narrow claim would be.

16

you can draw this categorical distinction.

17

MR. NEUSTADT:

So, I'm not sure that

Usually when a patent attorney

18

wants to -- is concerned with narrowing his claim, he

19

doesn't want to narrow his claim because he gets less for

20

his client.

21

doesn't narrow, if that is the examiner's concern.

22

usually clarifications are not narrowings and are not

affected by the Federal circuit rule.

He will try to clarify it in a way that
So,

What the Federal circuit issue is -- is directed

amendment, we're going to presume that it relates to

2

patentability, and when we make that presumption, if it's

3

not rebutted, it will act as a bar.

4

Warner-Jenkinson set forth a complete bar.

5

is nothing new.

6

QUESTION:

Complete bar

Well, why isn't that enough?

7

why is an additional rule sought?

8

MR. NEUSTADT:

9

So, this Court in

Why --

The -- the additional rule

relates to the fact that in the Federal circuit, not in

10

this Court, there was what was called a flexible bar rule,

11

and what they did was if you initially claimed glue and

12

came back to adhesives and then -- I'm sorry -- you

13

claimed adhesives and then you had to narrow it to glue,

14

then in a lawsuit you found someone using adhesives, you

15

would then say, well, my glue is really the same as

16

adhesives under the doctrine of equivalents.

17

Federal circuit in this decision is saying that you can't

18

do that.

19

And the

But previously the Federal circuit had the

20

flexible bar rule, and the flexible bar rule said that if

21

you went from adhesives to glue, and you didn't have to go

22

all that way to glue -- maybe you could have stopped

23

somewhere in between -- they say you can then look at

24

where you might have been able to stop.

25

Intel brief, could have, should have, and would have.

This is in the

34
Alderson Reporting Company

And

1

they say we can take it back to something in between

2

adhesives and glue.

3

public has no notice of what the claim covers.

4

out there who wants to innovate in the area between glue

5

and adhesives has to know what he can do, and the Federal

6

circuit rule enables them now to say that, yes, that claim

7

means glue and we don't have to worry about something if

8

we don't use glue.

-- his rule is a little better than the flexible bar rule.

14

The SG says we're going to have a complete bar

overcome by the patentee, and he's going to have to show

wonderful argument against the whole doctrine of

10

QUESTION:

Well, that may well be.

an applicant will disclose, say, three things, A, B, and

he'll say, under the doctrine of equivalents, A covers B

Mr. Neustadt, would you -- would you

tell us why the approach of a complete bar is consistent

13

with the approach taken in Warner-Jenkinson where the

14

Court did not want to have a rigid -- a rule with no

15

flexibility, and so it created this rebuttable

16

presumption?

17

MR. NEUSTADT:

Yes.

The Court in Warner-

18

relate to patentability and amendments that do not relate

to patentability.

In Warner-Jenkinson, this Court said if the

which had that same bar in that.

QUESTION:

The words this Court used was bar.
But

Well, I thought everybody agreed that

the question was open, that this Court did not decide.
MR. NEUSTADT:

The Federal circuit said that

18

their decision was not controlled by Exhibit Supply.

Both

19

our side and the Government side said that it is

20

controlled by Exhibit Supply and that the Federal circuit

21

would have had to have reached that conclusion anyway.

22

And -- and the -- the very plain language of Exhibit

23

Supply is that when a patentee chooses to go from the

24

claim as unamended to make a narrow limitations in there,

25

there's a complete bar with respect to the amended

the Federal circuit rule is even narrower than -- than

been an implicit assumption that that was -- that was

It just referred to

The Federal circuit, since they hear a lot of
patent cases, focused more in on the fact that it really

wasn't the fact that it was prior art.

What you wanted to

get at was important changes, and they -- they used the

language statutory requirements of patentability.
For example, one of the most important things is

make changes with respect to clarity.

Maybe the examiner

likes 12 feet rather than 144 inches.

Maybe there are

other things that he thinks will be more clear.

as they're not narrowing, the patent attorney is happy to

make them, but as soon as he -- he narrows, he knows that

he's getting his client less.

As long

With respect to foreseeability, I just wanted to
make one comment.

Patent attorneys, when they draft broad

claims, they draft broad claims because they don't know

broad claim because if something happens in the future,

13

they're going to be covered for it.
