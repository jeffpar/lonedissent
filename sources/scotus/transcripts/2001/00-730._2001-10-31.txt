CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

now in No. 00-730, Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Mineta.

Mr. Pendley.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM P. PENDLEY

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. PENDLEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

In 1989, the small family business that is

11

Adarand lost a Federal contract because of a racial

12

program and the race of its owner, Randy Pesh.

13

In 1995, this Court held that Adarand had

14

standing to seek forward-looking relief because that

15

program prevented it from competing on an equal footing.

16

In 2001, Adarand returns to this Court because

17

it still can't compete on an equal footing.

18

QUESTION:

Mr. Pendley, treat, if you will,

19

fairly shortly coming up in your argument, the Government

20

says that in a direct procurement program, these sort of

21

preferences that you're challenging are simply not used in

22

Colorado.

23

dispute here?

24
25

You say they are.

MR. PENDLEY:

Do we simply have a factual

No, Your Honor.

The evidence is

quite clear that the program still exists in Colorado.

There are a number of mechanisms -- the Government calls

3

which the Government implements this complex statutory

scheme that it has.

MR. PENDLEY:

QUESTION:

3

Compensation clause, Your Honor.

Compensation clause?

Didn't both

courts hold that that was unconstitutional?

4

MR. PENDLEY:

What happened was that the -- the

5

district court held that the entire program, all of

6

section 8(d) of the Small Business Act, was

7

unconstitutional.

8

of '96, asked the court to narrow its decision to include

9

only the subcontracting compensation clause.

10

The United States, on the 20th of June

On the 23rd

of June, the district court declined.

11

At the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, the Tenth

12

Circuit held the district court was right as to the 1996

13

subcontracting compensation clause, but there was a new

14

subcontracting compensation clause now in place, and it

15

had been changed sufficiently.

16

QUESTION:

The one that you were complaining

17

about last time around, that one has been held invalid.

No, Your Honor, it is not correct.

The subcontracting compensation clause is still alive and

it still applies against Adarand.

not allow the case to be moot.

Your Honor, on the issue of standing or

Absolutely, Your Honor.

7

mootness, this Court held in 1995 that Adarand had

8

standing, and as the Court said in its Adarand 2000

9

opinion, in the Adarand case and in the Laidlaw case, the

10

issue is now is not an issue of standing but one of

11

mootness.

12

Has, indeed, the Adarand case been mooted?
It has not been mooted because the United States

13

in its tool bag of mechanisms by which it applies this

14

program -- it still has others.

15

To answer your question, Justice Kennedy, it

16

has, for example, the monetary -- the mandatory

17

subcontracting plans.

18

States requires of contractors to adopt, and Adarand put

19

three of them in the lodging at tabs A, B, and C and on

20

21

and which the United States, on three separate instances

QUESTION:

That's -- those are the plans as to

which the court of appeals said in -- in one sentence, a

10

rather terse comment, nor are we presented with any

11

indication that Adarand has standing to challenge

12

paragraphs 4 through 6.

13

MR. PENDLEY:

Well, as this Court said in

14

Adarand 2000, the courts and parties have been confused as

15

to the difference between standing and mootness, and the

16

Tenth Circuit was confused as to mootness and standing,

17

resulting in the Court's Adarand 2000 decision and it

18

appears to be still confused as to the two.

19

QUESTION:

It -- it says that you have no

20

standing to attack these paragraphs that we've just

21

discussed, and -- and you don't challenge that in your

22

petition for certiorari or in your -- or in your opening

23

brief.

24
25

MR. PENDLEY:

Well, Your Honor, we believe the

issue of standing is always before the Court.

It was not
8

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

an issue -- it was not an issue in the original petition

2

in 1989.

3

always by the Court.

4

Yet, standing was addressed, as it properly is

QUESTION:

The issue of lack of standing is not

5

always before the Court.

6

cannot render a judgment in a case where there is no

7

standing but where a party doesn't -- doesn't present any

8

-- any standing material, the Court is not going to go

9

looking to see whether, in fact, there is or not.

10

MR. PENDLEY:

11

QUESTION:

The Court -- the Court certainly

Well, Your Honor, the --

All the cases you're citing are cases

12

where both of the parties assumed standing and the Court

13

looked into it on its own.

14

standing has been denied below and -- and the party

15

doesn't come forward challenging that denial, I don't know

16

of any case where we say standing is nonetheless an issue.

17

MR. PENDLEY:

But -- but where -- where

Well, Adarand believes that

18

standing is under rule 14(a) is fairly included within the

19

questions presented because it was plain error for the

20

Tenth Circuit below to hold that Adarand did not have

21

standing because the Tenth Circuit below addressed the SCC

22

and yet declined to address the statutory program that

23

we're --

QUESTION:

Did you challenge below the Small

Business Act provision, section 8(d)(4) through (6)?
MR. PENDLEY:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

In

4

Adarand's amended complaint on the 22nd of January of

5

1996, Adarand challenged all the statutes, all the

6

regulations, and all the contract provisions promulgated

7

as a result thereof.

Were -- were -- did Adarand bid on

contracts issued by States with Federal assistance?
MR. PENDLEY:

MR. PENDLEY:

Were they at issue in the suit?

QUESTION:

So, the only thing that you now say

you're challenging are contracts -- direct contracts -MR. PENDLEY:

QUESTION:

19

MR. PENDLEY:

21

It's not at issue in this case,

Your Honor.

Adarand has bid on State-

assisted or Federal-assisted State contracts --

12

14

Yes.

Yes, ma'am.

-- with the Federal -Yes, Your Honor.

It's the direct

Federal procurement program which remains unchanged.
QUESTION:

And the Tenth Circuit seemed to think

22

that you did not challenge those Small Business Act

23

sections that I referred to.

24
25

MR. PENDLEY:
absolutely incorrect.

Well, the Tenth Circuit was
It's plain error for the Tenth
10

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Circuit to reach that conclusion.

2

looked at -- for example, this Court held that Adarand

3

challenged two things:

4

incentives; and number two, the statutory and regulatory

5

regimes, the racial presumptions that are their

6

foundation.

7

QUESTION:

The Tenth Circuit

number one, the financial

Can you cite us any filing in the

8

district court that specifically referred to section

9

8(d)(4)?

10

MR. PENDLEY:

Yes, Your Honor.

In -- on --

11

first of all, on the 20th of June of 1996, the United

12

States appealed to the district court and said Adarand

13

only challenged the SCC.

14

The district court denied that.

15

It didn't challenge everything.

Then on the -- on the 19th of -- of August of

16

1998, the United States, in its appeal to the Tenth

17

Circuit, said the district court held that Adarand had

18

standing to challenge everything and -- and we don't think

19

that's true.

20

In our --

QUESTION:

Well, we have a joint appendix.

21

Could you refer us to the pages where you challenged

22

section 8(d)(4) through (6)?

23

so of the joint appendix, it shows that we did that?

24
25

MR. PENDLEY:

Can you say on page so and

Well, Your Honor, I -- I can cite

to the pleadings that Adarand filed in this case where
11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Adarand asserted that all parts of the program, all the

2

statutory provisions that allow this program to exist and

3

the United States to implement it, have been -- have been

4

challenged by Adarand.

5

QUESTION:

What it says on --

6

QUESTION:

Was there a separate question in your

7

petition for certiorari addressed to 8(d)(4) through (6)?

8
9

MR. PENDLEY:

No, there was not a separate

question addressed to that, Your Honor.

10

QUESTION:

They didn't say you didn't file it.

11

What the -- what the circuit said in footnote 32 on page

12

84 of your appendix, the parties have not addressed

13

paragraph (4) of section 8(d) at all, and because there is

14

no indication from the parties that Adarand has or will

15

bid for contracts governed by that paragraph's

16

requirement, we do not address it in great detail.

17

Now, I take it that the problem here is that

18

since that time, you have tried to get a contract and you

19

have tried to get a contract from a contractor who has in

20

the contract the very clause you're trying to attack.

21

If I'm right about that, what are we supposed to

22

do?

The lower court didn't address the issue you want to

23

raise.

24

that time.

25

time.

The lower court thought you had no standing at
You probably didn't have standing at that

You probably do have standing now.

So, what is it
12

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

you suggest we do?

2

Do we dig the whole thing?

3

Do we send it back to the lower court?

MR. PENDLEY:

Do we do something else?

Your Honor, Adarand had challenged

4

consistently -- first -- first of all, the subcontracting

5

compensation clause is one mechanism that the United

6

States developed to implement the statutory program that

7

Adarand challenges.

8

or mechanism by which it's implemented, but those statutes

9

that are used.

10

Adarand challenges not just that tool

This Court held in Adarand 2000 that the

11

subcontracting compensation clause came directly out of

12

8(d)(4)(E).

13

Adarand 2000.

14

footnote to which the Justice cited, that -- that the

15

parties have not discussed it, in fact there was no need

16

to discuss it because it was clear that this was the

17

mechanism by which -- this was the statutory mandate by

18

which the United States used the subcontracting

19

compensation clause against Adarand.

20
21

24
25

And so when the Tenth Circuit holds in the

QUESTION:

What's the answer to Justice Breyer's

question?

22
23

That was the holding of this Court in -- in

MR. PENDLEY:

That Adarand had standing at that

time -QUESTION:

No.

What are we supposed to do?

gave you a premise and said, what do we do?

He

Do we send it
13

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

back?

Do we dig?

2

Do we something else?

QUESTION:

But -- but the premise was that you

3

had no standing at the time the court of appeals wrote

4

this decision.

Do you agree with that premise?

5

MR. PENDLEY:

I do not, Your Honor.

6

The reason Adarand does not agree with that

7

premise is because the Laidlaw decision holds that once

8

Adarand had standing, as a result of this Court's 1995

9

decision, that standing continued until such time as the

10

United States somehow made the case moot as the result of

11

the revocation of --

12

QUESTION:

Well, I thought Laidlaw stood for the

13

principle that standing is judged as of the time the suit

14

is filed.

15

MR. PENDLEY:

16

QUESTION:

17

Yes, Your Honor.

And subsequent changes affect

mootness possibly, but not standing.

18

MR. PENDLEY:

Yes, Your Honor.

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. PENDLEY:

21

But -- so -- the question before the Court --

22

QUESTION:

Is that correct?
That's my understanding.

My question was not quite so

23

technical.

It seemed to me that you're trying to raise a

24

serious issue and the fact is that the Tenth Circuit never

25

addressed it.

Now, the reason that the Tenth Circuit
14

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

never addressed it is what they say; it's because you

2

didn't address section (4) -- subsection (4) of section

3

8(d).

4

indication there would be any practical problem in the

5

future because you didn't -- they at time thought you

6

weren't bidding on the contract.

7

And they didn't address it because there was no

Things have changed.

That's the premise of my question.

8

technical question.

9

that's in paragraph -- in footnote 32.

10

It's not a

It makes that practical assumption
And so my question

was, what should we do?

11

MR. PENDLEY:

Conclude that the Tenth Circuit

12

was wrong in stating what it stated in that footnote

13

because Adarand specifically challenged 8(d)(4).

14

QUESTION:

Well, you raised it, but you surely

15

didn't address it.

In fact, you didn't even address it in

16

your principal brief, and the Government has certainly not

17

addressed it in their -- in their principal brief because

18

everybody thought the fight was about these -- these new

19

regulations that -- that modify the -- the Subcontractor

20

Compensation Clause, rather -- rather than this other

21

clause.

22

Now, you may well have preserved the objection,

23

but the fact is it hasn't been discussed below and it has

24

barely been argued in the briefs here.

25

is devoted to it, but the Government's principal brief

Your reply brief

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

certainly isn't.

2

MR. PENDLEY:

Well, what -- what Adarand

3

addressed was the -- at the Tenth Circuit was the

4

constitutionality of this -- of this racial program, and

5

-- and there are a number of mechanisms by which the

6

racial program is implemented against Adarand.

7

out of section (4)(d) -- section 8(d)(4) -- (4) to (6).

8
9

QUESTION:

That flows

That's right, but all of those other

mechanisms the Government says in their brief have been

10

washed away by -- by the -- by the benchmark study

11

provision, which eliminates -- which eliminates the

12

difficulty.

13

that.

14

there is still one other objection we have, and then --

15

and then you focus on the -- on the subcontractor

16

commitment requirement in -- in 8(d)(4).

17

And in your reply brief, you do not contest

You simply say that despite the benchmark study,

MR. PENDLEY:

It is one of the mechanisms by

18

which the United States continues to implement this --

19

this regime, this program.

20
21
22

QUESTION:

And that wasn't discussed below and

had barely been discussed in the briefs here.
MR. PENDLEY:

In addition, Adarand -- Adarand

23

noted that the benchmark study allows it to be turned on

24

and turned off, and it still can be turned -- turned on in

25

the State of Colorado.
16
Alderson Reporting Company

1
2

QUESTION:

But what do you mean by that, to be

turned on and turned off?

3

MR. PENDLEY:

4

me, Mr. Chief Justice.

5

Well, here's what the -- pardon

Mr. Chief Justice, the United States asserts we

6

do these benchmark studies.

7

and we decide where underutilization takes place.

8
9

We do them about once a year

Now, these benchmark studies don't comply with
Croson because they don't examine qualified, willing, and

10

able.

11

assume that racial disparity means racial discrimination.

12

They don't look at subcontracts, and -- and they

But the United States says, in those States in

13

which there is not underutilization, we will not use some

14

of our mechanisms, like price evaluation adjustments and

15

other -- other monetary incentives.

16

the ability to use the monetary -- excuse me -- the

17

mandatory subcontracting clause, as -- as Adarand has

18

pointed out in its lodging.

19
20
21

However, we retain

In addition, the United States reserves the
power to use these set-asides to achieve the goal.
QUESTION:

You say they reserve the power.

Does

22

MR. PENDLEY:

United States is today still using in Colorado the

mandatory subcontracting clauses.

5

6

the set-asides in Colorado, as well as the mentor protege

program.

States uses the racial preference program in Colorado --

9

those mechanisms still exist.

10

That's -- that's what our lodging
It demonstrates the

In addition, the United

11

an overdue benchmark study, could conclude, well, now

QUESTION:

These

But to the extent that your -- your

15

answer, in effect, tells us that the controversy is live

16

and presented based on what you have in a lodging, you're

17

really asking us to make a -- a determination of fact in a

18

disagreement between you and the Government as to whether

19

they're being used or whether they're not being used.

20

doesn't it make much more sense for us to send -- if

21

that's what the case is going to turn on, doesn't it make

22

much more sense for us to send it back to facts -- to

23

courts that engage in fact-finding and that will make that

24

determination on the basis of evidence as distinguished

25

from our making it on the basis of a lodging?

And

MR. PENDLEY:

Well, the United States cannot

assert that it does not use the mandatory subcontracting

incentives because it's required by law.

It's required by

That's what I thought they said in

Maybe -- maybe you say -- I mean, and

they have filed a memorandum from Arthur Hamilton, Federal

MR. PENDLEY:

Now, your assertion is that that

I'm asserting that it violates law

13

and it violates the regulation.

It violates 48 C.F.R.

Your Honor, if you could hear me out on this.

15

On the -- on the 9th of March, the United States

16

was -- on the 24th of February, the United States was

17

invited by the Tenth Circuit to provide us additional

18

indication as to how this case is moot.

19

20

it's moot.

On the 9th of

We're not going to use the SCC in Colorado

22

Now, of course, as of the 30th of June of '98,

23

apparently under the benchmark studies, they had stopped

24

using the SCC, but now all of a sudden on the 9th of March

25

of 2000, they say, well, now we're not going to use it

anymore.

2

So, Adarand comes forward to this Court and

3

says, it doesn't matter if they stopped using the SCC as

4

that 9 March memo shows, Your Honor, the United States

5

says, we'll use the requirements of the bar and we'll use

6

the set-aside.

And then --

QUESTION:

MR. PENDLEY:

9

this?

10

I apologize.

Mr. Pendley, may I ask you -Your Honor, may I -- may I finish

This is important to my case.

And so -- so, Adarand files this lodging and

11

says, wait, look, they're still using these FAR's and

12

they're hurting us.

13

And so, on the 24th of August, the United States

14

comes forward and says, oh, oh, wait, we've changed our

15

mind.

16

we're not going to use the FAR's either, even though on

17

the 9th of March we said we would use the FAR's.

18

Not only are we not going to use the SCC's, now

But whether they've abandoned the FAR's and

19

whether they've abandoned the SCC, they are still using

20

the set-asides in Colorado.

21

think the United States should be permitted to moot this

22

case by withdrawing this program on the eve of this

23

argument and -- and then allowed to reinstitute it as soon

24

as this Court --

MR. PENDLEY:

Your Honor, the -- the controversy

20

Adarand presents in 2001 is that Adarand still is unable

21

to compete on an equal footing because the United States

22

still has in its tool of -- in its tool kit mechanisms by

QUESTION:

Your first point is that the

congressional findings are inadequate.

5

MR. PENDLEY:

There are no findings, Your Honor.

6

They asked the GAO, find something for us, find the facts.

7

And the GAO came back just like City of Richmond did in --

8

in the Croson case, and said, we don't know how many DBE's

9

there are.

We don't know what market they're in.

We

10

don't know if they're qualified, willing, and able, and we

11

don't know how many subcontracts they win.

12

in its report the lack of information prevents anyone from

General Olson, if -- if counsel for

there's a certain amount of bobbing and weaving going on

on the part of the Government in this case.

MR. OLSON:

of the Government here.

What we have, first of all, the Subcontractor

Compensation Clause is no longer a part of this case.

5

the extent that Adarand had standing with respect to it,

6

that provision of the law was declared unconstitutional.

7

The Government has not challenged that provision.

8

there is no evidence in this record that that provision is

9

being used with respect to Adarand at all.

10

With respect to the --

11

QUESTION:

12

That --

And that was the provision that was

the focus of the original suit?

13

MR. OLSON:

Yes, Justice O'Connor.

Well, cannot those under -- under the

16

amended statute, cannot some additional compensation be

17

provided but subject to the new regulations?

To

MR. OLSON:

Well, if we distinguish between that

19

the Federal aid program and the direct Federal procurement

20

program and the Subcontractor Compensation Clause the

21

United States Government has abandoned in all respects,

22

those provisions have not been justified, and the United

States Government is not employing those.

24

With respect to the clauses --

actions by the Department of Transportation.

It now has decided to challenge the

But as this

10

Court noted and -- and the Tenth Circuit specifically

11

held, there was no indication that Adarand at the time was

challenging those provisions or that Adarand has or will

continue to bid for contracts or subcontracts covered by

those paragraphs, the race-conscious provisions of those

paragraphs.

late as the reply brief, Mr. Olson.

The -- the petition

5

for certiorari says the following, that the Government is

of compulsion and incentives.

9

statutes require every private prime contractor, on

As to compulsion, the

penalty of being ineligible to win Federal contracts, to

11

establish and adhere to a plan to try to hire DBE's as

MR. OLSON:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. OLSON:

The -That is precisely the issue that -It was -- it was mentioned in -- at

16

the beginning of the brief and not addressed -- those

17

provisions were not addressed in the arguments of the

18

brief.

19

But, more importantly, pursuant to the

20

Department of Justice guidelines issued in 1996, those

race -- any race-conscious provisions in the statute may

22

not be applied in any area of the country unless they're

23

justified by the Department of Commerce benchmark study

MR. OLSON:

They're to be conducted every year,

often.

(Laughter.)

12

MR. OLSON:

What does that mean?

Well, it's one of those -- one of

those Government programs that it is hoped will be

conducted more often than they actually get conducted,

doubt in --

3

MR. OLSON:

There is no evidence in this record

4

that the subcontract clause provisions, which Adarand is

5

now discussing, have been applied ever in Colorado or in

6

those States precluded by the benchmark study.

7

QUESTION:

What is the basis for not applying

8

them, Mr. Olson?

9

possible basis is there for the Government not to apply

10

them?

That -- that's what puzzles me.

What

They are required by the statute.

11

MR. OLSON:

Well, and also they are required by

12

the holdings of this Court to apply and interpret that

13

statute in a constitutional fashion.

14

Court discussed in Adarand is to implement whatever

15

programs it has in a narrowly tailored fashion.

16

Precisely what this

What the Department of Justice did, after this

17

decision in Adarand, is enter into a lengthy study,

18

determined that race-conscious programs or provisions of

19

Federal statutes could not be applied in ways that were

20

not narrowly tailored, responding directly to this Court's

21

guidance.

22

study indicated that they would only be applied -- only --

23

even at the outset -- in areas where there was evidence of

24

the direct effects of discrimination in Federal

25

contracting.

As a result of that, the Department of Justice

29
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

The Department of Commerce thereafter conducted

2

a study, did not find these disparate impact in terms of

3

effects of discrimination in the areas in which Colorado

4

exists.

5

that, the Department of Transportation has not used and

6

has not employed the -- the race-conscious provisions of

7

those clauses in those areas.

that, in fact, in Colorado some of those provisions have

13

been and are, in fact, now in contract forms.

14

MR. OLSON:

They are in the contract forms, but

15

instances where they probably should be removed from the

absolutely clear that it is not enforcing race-conscious

remedies, as instructed by this Court in the first Adarand

decision, except in a narrowly tailored fashion, and

MR. OLSON:

If they were being enforced and

Adarand could suggest that it was somehow affected by

that.

And it has not been able to do that either because

that unless there are no set of circumstances under which

Once you've reached a certain plateau

And these -- these

In fact, I understand --

So, your point, to be absolutely

explicit, is if you are below the plateau, $750,000, you

still might not qualify as being economically

position.

I don't understand the analysis that would come

21

out the other way because I think the statute is

relatively clear with respect to that.

23

The -- the -- so, the -- in the first place, the

certification process requires someone asserting under

2

cert petition in the most recent case before this one that

3

it was not prepared to sign a certification about social

4

and economic disadvantage because it was afraid of being

5

prosecuted for fraud, perjury, and disbarment charges and

things of that -- that sort.

7

evidence that people take these things seriously, that the

statutory threshold and the regulatory threshold must be

met.

So, there's plenty of

It may be challenged by people.

There are field

10

procedures in place and so forth.

11

of the narrow tailoring requirement that takes place with

respect to this process.

13

So, that's another step

So, we submit that with respect to the subject

14

of a compelling governmental interest, this Court

15

addressed that very point in its first Adarand decision,

and -- and made it clear in the last paragraph of part

over and over again, on the basis of detailed analytical

studies which are -- which are described in considerable

this Court has said is that there has been the lingering

13

effects, unfortunately, of publicly financed

the Court rules on the merits, these programs are

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM P. PENDLEY

20

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

23

Thank you, General Olson.

MR. PENDLEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:
First of all, the -- the Department of Justice

24

guidelines, the proposed reforms have never gone final.

25

They were put out in 1996.

They have never been

implemented in the direct Federal procurement program.

2

Secondly and relatedly, they have been

3

implemented to some degree with regard to the State aid

4

programs, but that case isn't at issue here.

5

Thirdly, the Court held in Jacksonville --

have.

9

How do we know they haven't been

The -- the Solicitor General tells us they

MR. PENDLEY:

The -- the Government concedes,

10

with regard to the State aid program, that that's not at

11

issue in this -- in this case, and that's in the

12

Government's responsive brief.

13

proposed reforms -- one need only look at the small

14

business regulations at 13 C.F.R. and also the -- the bar

15

regulations at 48 C.F.R.

16

to this race-neutral approach that the -- that the United

17

States is talking about.

18

However, the -- the

Those are unchanged with regard

In the -- in the Jacksonville case, what is

19

necessary for Adarand to show is its inability to compete

20

on an equal footing, the back end.

21

held in 1995, and it is still unable to compete on an

22

equal footing because of these very -- various programs

23

they have in place.

24
25

That's what this Court

In the City of Jacksonville, the Court -- this
Court refused to permit the City of Jacksonville to remove

1

a program and submit a new program.

2

you don't need to have the selfsame program to maintain

3

your challenge.

4

And this Court said,

The Government can't simply change the program,

5

play this little shell game, and deny this Court

6

jurisdiction.

7

This is simply changing the mechanism by which it is

8

applying it and saying, well, we're not using that bad,

9

old SCC anymore, but we have this other bag of tricks that

10

This isn't even removing the whole program.

we're -- we're going to utilize.

11

The -- the Court is absolutely right.

These

12

contractors out there are on pain of loss of serious money

13

if they don't comply with these mandatory subcontracting

14

plans.

15

this guardrail subcontract, it was $105,000.

16

prime does not issue that contract to a DBE, he loses that

17

$105,000.

The term is liquidated damages.

18

If that

The United States takes it from him.
This is both a facial and an as-applied

19

challenge.

20

the statute is unconstitutional on both.

21

In one contract,

We have made that clear consistently.

We say

And finally, let me draw the Court's attention

22

to the subcontracting decision by the Tenth Circuit.

It's

23

at page 70 to 71 of Adarand's petition appendix.

24

therein, the Tenth Circuit makes it very clear there used

25

to be a bad, old SCC in 1996.

And

That isn't there anymore.
52

1

We have a brand new SCC that's been changed and it won't

2

be quite so -- quite so non-narrowly tailored.

3

still is an SCC in place.

4

But there

And finally, Your Honor, the United States told

5

this Court that the benchmark study is overdue, and I know

6

in my bones, as I know that this case has gone on forever

7

by the United States' effort to make it go on forever and

8

with broad jurisdiction from this Court, that the day this

9

case ends is the day the benchmark study comes out, and

10

suddenly and miraculously Colorado is back in the

11

underutilized category and all these mechanisms apply.

12

I think it's incredibly amazing that on the 9th

13

of March of 2000, the man in charge of this program said,

14

don't use the SCC, continue to use the FAR and its

15

mandatory subcontracting plans, and that 2 weeks before we

16

filed that lodging that showed all those mandatory

17

subcontracting plans, suddenly his instruction from the

18

9th of March of 2000 was withdrawn and said, wait, wait,

19

don't use the mandatory subcontracting plans out of the

20

FAR.

21

it the set-aside or the mandatory subcontracting plans or

22

the subcontracting compensation clause or the price

23

evaluation adjustments, Adarand is still denied that equal

24

footing this Court found in 1995.

25

Use the set-asides instead.

And whether they call

I urge this Court to reach this case on the
53

1

merits because the day this Court says it's moot is the

2

day Adarand gets standing again because it loses another

3

contract because this program is applied in Colorado, and

4

Adarand will start this sad process again.

5

Thank you for the Court's indulgence.

Pendley.
