ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOM L. STEWART

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. STEWART:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In May 1998, respondent was convicted of a

12

misdemeanor drug offense in a California court and was

13

placed on 3 years' probation.

14

required respondent to submit to searches of his person or

15

property, quote, with or without a search warrant, warrant

16

of arrest or reasonable cause by any probation officer or

17

law enforcement officer.

18

respondent stated:

19

understand the above terms and conditions of probation and

20

agree to abide by same.

21

One term of his probation

The acknowledgement signed by

I have received a copy, read, and

The Supreme Court of California has long held

22

that such an acknowledgement is a voluntary and

23

enforceable consent to future searches because, under

24

California law, a defendant may not be compelled to accept

25

probation, but may insist instead on serving the term of

Page 4

2

confinement that is authorized by law.
Less than a week after respondent was placed on

3

probation, State police came to suspect that he was

4

involved in an act of vandalism against electric and

5

telecommunications facilities that caused approximately

6

$1.5 million in damage.

7

police searched respondent's residence and found evidence

8

implicating him in the crime.

9

Relying on the search condition,

Respondent was subsequently indicted in Federal

10

court on charges of conspiracy to commit arson and being a

11

felon in possession of ammunition.

12

QUESTION:

Now, Mr. -- may I ask this question?

13

The actual search was conducted by State officers, as I

14

understand it.

15

MR. STEWART:

16

QUESTION:

17
18

That's correct.

Do you think the consent would have

applied equally to Federal officers?
MR. STEWART:

It would have.

By its terms, it

19

said any probation officer or law enforcement officer.

20

I'm not aware of any cases in the California system in

21

which the search condition has actually been invoked by a

22

Federal officer, but I think it would apply by its terms

23

to such searches.

24
25

QUESTION:

What about a law enforcement officer

from Nevada?

Page 5
1

MR. STEWART:

I -- I think that's correct.

It's

2

unlikely that such a search would occur because presumably

3

one of the terms of probation would be that the -- the

4

respondent would be required to remain within the State of

5

California, and it's -- it's unlikely that he would be

6

searched in California by Nevada officers.

7

-- if such an unlikely scenario unfolded --

8
9
10

QUESTION:

13
14
15

Well, it could be on the basis of a

preexisting criminal situation.

I mean, he might have

committed a crime in Nevada 2 years ago.

11
12

But I think if

MR. STEWART:

That's correct.

It could have

happened.
QUESTION:

But what do you think?

Would it

apply to a Nevada officer as well, do you think?
MR. STEWART:

I think it would.

The consent

16

would apply by its terms because it refers, without

17

qualification, to any law enforcement officer.

18

QUESTION:

Well, I assume that -- doesn't that

19

reasonably mean a law enforcement officer who has

20

authority?

21

MR. STEWART:

I mean, there might be some

22

independent basis for objecting to the presence of the --

23

the officer from outside the State, but I -- I don't think

24

that the consent would fail to extend to --

25

QUESTION:

Well, not -- I mean, if you have

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

Page 6
1

consent, I assume it could be, you know, a law enforcement

2

officer from Afghanistan.

3

(Laughter.)

4

MR. STEWART:

5

QUESTION:

Well, the -- the Supreme Court --

Don't you think the consent is

6

reasonably understood to be limited to a law enforcement

7

officer who has authority under the applicable law of the

8

jurisdiction?

9
10
11
12

MR. STEWART:

I think the -- I think that may be

right -QUESTION:

Which would include a Federal

officer --

13

MR. STEWART:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. STEWART:

And it might include --

-- but not -- not an Afghan officer.
Well, it might -- it might include

16

a Nevada officer, and if -- if under the circumstances

17

Justice Stevens posits, there were actually authority for

18

a Nevada officer to -- to be on the premises.

19

In any event --

20

QUESTION:

Well, but isn't -- doesn't your

21

argument have an even narrower consequence?

22

of your argument, which I -- I want to go into, rests upon

23

the fact that if he didn't consent, the State could --

24

could commit him, could put him -- put him in the house of

25

correction.

Because part

And you're saying, well, a person, in effect,

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

Page 7
1

can consent to bargain his way out of that more -- more

2

serious imposition, but that suggests that the only thing

3

that he's freely consenting to is the avoidance of

4

something that the State could do to him.

5

Government couldn't do it to him.

6

and Afghanistan couldn't do it to him.

7

doesn't that suggest that the only thing that he's

8

consenting to is what he has to consent to, and that is to

9

let California people search him so he doesn't have to go

10

The Federal

Nevada couldn't to him,
So, doesn't --

behind bars now?

11

MR. STEWART:

Well, the Supreme Court of

12

California has construed the consent to -- not to apply to

13

searches that are conducted for purposes of harassment or

14

in an unreasonable manner.

15

QUESTION:

Well, but what about my -- what about

16

my question?

17

your argument, and I take it there is.

18

significance in the fact that California can put him

19

behind bars if he doesn't agree, doesn't it follow that

20

his consent is likewise limited, i.e., limited to agreeing

21

to let officers of the State that could put him behind

22

bars search him?

23

If -- if there is significance in the -- in

MR. STEWART:

No.

If there is

I don't -- I don't think that

24

follows.

25

many cases upon a waiver of Fourth Amendment rights as a

That is, the reason that California insists in

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

Page 8
1

condition of release on probation is that it wants to

2

ensure that there will be no unnecessary barriers to

3

monitoring the individual's compliance with the terms of

4

his probation.

5
6

QUESTION:

That is to say monitoring by

California.

7

MR. STEWART:

Well, it wouldn't -- it would

8

extend beyond monitoring by California, because one of the

9

terms of probation is that the individual avoid violations

10

of any criminal law.

11

violation of his probation if he violated --

12

QUESTION:

That is, the individual would be in

Well, sure, I -- I understand that,

13

but it's California that monitors California probationers,

14

isn't it?

15

and it's not Nevada probation officers.

16

It's not -- it's not Federal probation officers

MR. STEWART:

Certainly California has the

17

primary interest in ensuring that California probationers

18

comply with the terms of their probation, but -- but it

19

would be a violation of the California probation for

20

respondent or another probationer to violate Federal law.

21

QUESTION:

Oh, I -- I realize that, but I'm just

22

saying -- well, let me -- let me put the question to you

23

blankly.

24

the fact that California could commit him?

25

are you implicitly making the argument that because

What is the significance for your argument in
Is -- is --

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

Page 9
1

California could commit him, California could do something

2

lesser than committing him; i.e., it could let him out

3

subject to a limitation on Fourth Amendment rights?

4

is that your argument?

5

MR. STEWART:

6
7

Is --

We're not making that argument all

the way because there would be some possible -QUESTION:

Because if you made that argument all

8

the way there would be no significance in the -- in the

9

agreement, would there?

10

MR. STEWART:

11

QUESTION:

12

Would -- would there?

MR. STEWART:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. STEWART:

16

QUESTION:

18

If that were

your argument, we would need an agreement.

13

17

To take an example of --

I think that's right.

Okay, so that's not your argument.
And to take an --

What then is the significance of the

power of California to commit him?
MR. STEWART:

I think the significance is that

19

this is -- that the defining characteristic of

20

probationers is that they have recently been convicted of

21

criminal offenses, and the premise of the institution of

22

probation, as the Court said in Griffin, is that a

23

probationer is more likely than the average citizen to

24

violate the law.

25

obviously, with people who've recently been convicted of

And one possible way of dealing,

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

Page 10
1

crimes is to incarcerate them to minimize the -- the

2

likelihood that they will commit future criminal offenses.

3

QUESTION:

All right.

Doesn't it boil down then

4

to saying that the significance of the conviction is

5

simply that it presents the occasion for this agreement

6

and that it's the agreement that is really what is

7

significant here?

8

MR. STEWART:

9

QUESTION:

I mean, it --

Everything stands or falls on the

10

fact that there's an agreement.

11

position boils down to?

12

MR. STEWART:

Isn't that what your

Well, everything stands or falls

13

on the fact that there is a conviction.

14

think it would be the case that even if --

15

QUESTION:

That is, it -- we

Well, if there were no conviction,

16

there would be no occasion for the agreement.

17

wouldn't be there.

18

They

They wouldn't be standing in court.

But once there is a conviction and the occasion

19

has presented itself, I don't see what in your argument

20

goes beyond the significance of the agreement itself.

21

MR. STEWART:

We would say that even if there

22

had been no agreement -- that is, even if it were the case

23

under California law, as it is under Federal law, that an

24

individual who has no legal right to -- that an individual

25

has no legal right to refuse probation, even if probation

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

Page 11
1

were a sentence that were imposed upon the defendant

2

without his consent -- we -- we would still argue that the

3

search condition is a reasonable term of probation.

4

QUESTION:

Okay.

But in that case, you would be

5

saying that because California had power to deal with him

6

at that point, it had power, in effect, to limit his

7

Fourth Amendment rights.

8

MR. STEWART:

9

QUESTION:

10

Let me give an example of --

No, but isn't -- isn't that what

you're saying?

11

MR. STEWART:

That is almost what I'm saying,

12

but let -- let me give an --

13

QUESTION:

But there's no -- I mean, there's no

14

general rule across the board that I know of that because

15

someone has been convicted, the State, in effect, can --

16

can limit bill of rights entitlements as a general rule.

17
18

MR. STEWART:

Let me give an example of why

it's --

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. STEWART:

Is -- am I right on that?
I think that's right, and let me

21

give an example of why we're not going quite all the way

22

and why we think you're correct.

23

For instance, this Court held in Bell v.

24

Wolfish, which is not cited in our brief, but it's in 441

25

U.S., that prison officials may preclude inmates from

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

Page 12
1

receiving hard cover books from persons other than

2

booksellers or bookstores.

3

restriction was that hard cover books could be used to

4

smuggle contraband into the institution.

5

very unlikely that the State could impose a similar

6

restriction on probationers because once an individual is

7

allowed to circulate in the community, the likelihood that

8

his receipt of hard cover books will add a meaningful

9

increment of danger that he will possess contraband would

10
11

And the rationale for that

We think it's

be pretty insignificant.
QUESTION:

Right.

It's the specific

12

relationship between the State and the prisoner at that

13

time that governs, in effect, what the State can do to --

14

to limit rights.

15

MR. STEWART:

16

QUESTION:

That's correct.

So, the same rule would apply in the

17

State as -- as probationary supervisor vis-a-vis

18

probationer.

Right?

19

MR. STEWART:

20

QUESTION:

That -- that is correct.

Our --

And doesn't it follow from that then

21

that the State's right to limit is itself limited by the

22

State's interest in supervising probation, as distinct

23

from the State's interest as a general enforcer of the

24

criminal law?

25

MR. STEWART:

I think it's correct that the

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

Page 13
1

State has an interest.

2

State has an interest in supervising probation.

3

has an interest in seeing to it that adequate measures are

4

taken to ensure that a probationer doesn't violate the

5

terms of his conditional release.

6

I wouldn't quite put it as the
The State

And if -- if one of the dangers that the State

7

fears, when a probationer is released into the community,

8

is that he may commit Federal crimes as -- in addition to

9

State crimes, it may reasonably choose to subject him, in

10

effect, to increased monitoring by Federal officials by

11

saying that he will have no right to demand the judicial

12

warrant even as to searches by -- by those officials.

13

we think that the -- a term of release like that is

14

reasonably related to the purposes and conditions --

15

QUESTION:

Okay.

So,

Does that -- does that mean

16

then, at this point in the argument, that you're relying

17

on the State's power as -- as the -- as the State vis-a-

18

vis a convict for your position rather than the convict's

19

agreement for your position?

20
21
22
23
24
25

MR. STEWART:

We -- we are relying on both.

We

are saying -QUESTION:

But what does it -- I mean, if -- if

your last argument is sound, what does the agreement add?
MR. STEWART:

I mean, the agreement provides an

additional check, an additional means of assurance that

2

there is a category where probation is the only

3

punishment.

4

MR. STEWART:

No.

And I think you conceded

Probation may be the only

5

punishment that is actually imposed in a particular case,

6

but we -- we certainly don't concede in this case that the

7

individual had no choice.

8

insisted upon --

The individual could have

is probation?

Period.

MR. STEWART:

It's -- you're -- you're correct.

14

In the Federal system, for instance, where an individual

15

doesn't have the choice to refuse probation, it may be

16

that a condition of this sort would still be upheld.

17

would argue that it would, but it could not be on a

18

consent theory.

We would agree with you on that.

19

And to return to Justice O'Connor's point --

20

QUESTION:

Was this a case where the defendant

21

had to be placed on probation?

22

that could have been imposed here?

We

years' probation, and the individual was placed on

guilty because they're faced with unattractive options.

3

QUESTION:

4

me slightly because I -- I wonder what -- I mean, you may

have plenty of power to impose the condition you want.

That's a different issue.

concerned, don't people get searched in prison?

MR. STEWART:

QUESTION:

10

Yes.

Okay.

And don't they get searched

out of prison under this?

11

MR. STEWART:

QUESTION:

13

But as far as consenting is

Yes.

Then what's his choice in respect to

search?

14

MR. STEWART:

Well, his choice -- I mean, he --

the likelihood is that as a practical matter, he will have

more privacy when on probation than -- than when he is in

He can't choose whether to be

MR. STEWART:

That's correct.

But in the plea

7

bargaining context, if an individual pleads guilty to an

8

offense because his understanding is he'll be sentenced to

9

10 years in prison and he does it because he thinks that

10

if he goes to trial, he'll be sentenced to 20 years in

11

prison, I mean, you could say in a sense that either way

12

he's going to be placed in prison, so what's the choice?

13

But the Court has recognized that to be a meaningful

14

choice.

15

doesn't negate the volitional element.

16

The fact that the options are unattractive

If he's in prison, can the police

25

MR. STEWART:

Suppose he had been put in jail

And then the law enforcement

Could -- could that be done

No.

No, unless some other

exception to the warrant requirement applied.
QUESTION:

So, if he were in jail, that's the

Alderson Reporting Company

Page 19

way he would have of protecting his house against entry

2

without a warrant.

3

MR. STEWART:

I mean -- and, you know, to look

4

at it that way, you could say that probation is

5

disadvantageous because, as Justice O'Connor pointed out,

6

it may extend for a longer period of time.

7

is not that the individual, in choosing probation, doesn't

8

give up anything that he might have had had he chosen

9

prison.

The point here

The point is that each of the options has both

10

attractive and unattractive features and the individual

11

has the choice --

12

QUESTION:

Mr. Stewart, can I ask you this

13

question?

I really want to understand the Government's

14

position.

It seems to me -- maybe they don't do it.

15

thought they did, but a State could have a -- a law that

16

says if you violate this statute, your punishment shall be

17

60 days in jail and a year of probation.

18

that, and that's the only -- only alternative so that

19

there is no element of consent whatsoever on the part of

20

the defendant, but the statute provides you have to

21

subject to it.

22

that case and to this case?

23

I

They could do

And would your argument apply equally to

MR. STEWART:

No, it would not.

That is, we --

24

we would still take the position that such a term was

25

reasonable, but it would be a pure special needs case.

We

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

Page 20
1

would not -- if the individual had no choice but to be

2

placed on probation, there would not be a consent theory

3

available to us.

4

QUESTION:

If we follow your suggested line of

5

decision and say that this was a consented-to search, can

6

we write the opinion without citing Griffin?

7

MR. STEWART:

I -- I assume that you would cite

8

Griffin, but I don't think that there is anything in our

9

position that is inconsistent with Griffin.

10
11
12

QUESTION:

That is --

We don't need Griffin under your

view.
MR. STEWART:

That's correct.

We -- I think the

13

part of Griffin that is particularly helpful to us is the

14

first part of Griffin that explained why supervision and

15

monitoring of probationers is a State interest distinct

16

from enforcement of the criminal law.

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. STEWART:

But Griffin was not a consent case.
That's correct.

There was no

19

allegation in Griffin that the individual had a right to

20

refuse probation.

21

presented in Griffin where the individual was placed on

22

probation without his choice, the Court was careful not to

23

suggest that the features of the constitutional -- the

24

features of the Wisconsin scheme were necessarily

25

constitutional prerequisites to a valid process.

And I think even in the circumstances

In

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

Page 21
1

particular, in footnote 2 of the Griffin opinion, the

2

Court noted that the test for restrictions within the

3

prison is whether they are reasonably related to a

4

legitimate penological objective.

5

QUESTION:

Do we say that the consent has to be

6

for a search that is substantially related to the purposes

7

of the probation; i.e., the hypothetical probation for 3

8

years but you give up your Fourth Amendment rights for

9

life?

10

MR. STEWART:

I mean, I think -- yes, I think we

11

would say that for the -- for the consent to be valid, the

12

individual's waiver of rights needs to bear some

13

reasonable relationship to the fact that he's on

14

probation.

15

State presumably could not condition release on probation

16

on an individual's agreement to refrain from criticizing

17

the Government or to refrain from engaging in religious

18

worship.

For instance, we've said in our brief that the

19

QUESTION:

Once you --

20

QUESTION:

Is that an unconstitutional

21
22

conditions analysis?
MR. STEWART:

I think that's correct, that the

23

-- the Court has said that ordinarily even when the

24

Government has discretion to grant or withhold a benefit

25

entirely, it may not grant it on a relinquishment of

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

Page 22
1

constitutional rights that bears no reasonable

2

relationship to the program at issue.

3

probationer's criticism of the Government would impair no

4

legitimate Government interests, would cause no damage

5

distinct from any other individual's criticism of the

6

Government, the strong inference would be that a State

7

that imposed that condition was simply trying to stifle

8

dissent and was attempting to use the probation condition

9

as a hook.

10

QUESTION:

So, because a

Once you say that, I don't see what

11

is to be gained by drawing the -- the big distinction that

12

you attempt to draw between consent and nonconsent.

13

you've -- once you've made that -- that line that it has

14

to be related to the Government's not just penological

15

interest, because it's certainly a punishment not to be

16

able to criticize the Government -- I guess one of the

17

punishments of being in prison, for example, is -- is the

18

inability to have sexual relationships with -- with your

19

spouse.

20

Government could not sentence you to 5 years in prison

21

plus another 5 years for no sexual relationships with your

22

spouse.

But I -- I assume you would say that the

Right?

MR. STEWART:

So, somehow the -- the -- it can't be

to be related to assuring the safety of the society from

2

the individual, which this search condition would.

3

once you say that it has to be connected that way, what do

4

you gain by saying there has to be consent?

5

MR. STEWART:

6

QUESTION:

But

Well, I think the consent --

I mean, consent or no consent, if

7

it's -- if it's connected up in that way, why isn't it

8

valid?

9

MR. STEWART:

I mean, we have -- we have said --

10

I mean, I've said today that we would be here defending

11

the condition even if it were imposed on a defendant who

12

had no option to refuse probation.

13

that the -- the existence of consent is not in our view

14

outcome determinative.

15

16

to insist on incarceration does provide an additional

17

check, an additional assurance that the condition is not

unduly onerous.

QUESTION:

So, we would agree

However, the -- the fact that the

The constitutional rights he can give

20

up are related to the purpose of the enforcement.

21

could you require him to give up his Miranda rights?

22

And my next question would be, could you require

23

him to give up his right to be free from coerced

24

confession by brutal torture?

25

So,

MR. STEWART:

No.

I mean, there would be --

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

Page 24

there would be no interest --

QUESTION:

Well, you get -- you get information

3

out of people sometimes by applying the screw.

4

there's a Government interest there and I don't -- what

5

is --

6

MR. STEWART:

I mean,

I don't -- I don't think the --

7

the legitimacy of using those particular methods to

8

attempt to solve as yet unanticipated crimes would vary

9

depending on whether the individual is a probationer or

10
11

not.
QUESTION:

Can you consent to torture?

Can you

12

consent to the elimination of your Miranda rights?

13

Wouldn't it -- wouldn't it suffice for your case to say

14

that the State can take away any of the constitutional

15

rights related to the -- the probationary nature of the --

16

of -- of the punishment?

person can waive?

MR. STEWART:

rights that are explained to you in the -- in the Miranda

3

colloquy.

4

waive your right to be informed of -- of those rights.

5

That's a different thing from saying you can

And to further elucidate what to us is the

6

significance of consent, if the terms of probation under

7

California law were much more severe -- for instance, if

8

the probationary period were 15 years rather than 3 or if

9

one of the conditions of probation was that an individual

10

had video cameras mounted in his residence so he could be

11

observed at all times -- at a certain point, you'd get to

12

a situation where lots of probationers would decide that

13

incarceration is better than this.

14

QUESTION:

May I ask another question?

To what

15

extent is the waiver of Fourth Amendment rights total in

16

your view?

17

waived his right to every 6-hour body cavity searches, for

18

example, something very extreme and intrusive searches?

19

Could he, for example -- could you say he's

MR. STEWART:

I mean, he -- he doesn't under

California law.

21

interpreted the consent condition as not applying to

or for purposes of harassment.

25

which strip searches may be conducted.

That is, the California Supreme Court has

3

QUESTION:

Do you think that statute is

constitutionally compelled?
MR. STEWART:

I mean, there -- there may be rare

4

situations in which an individual's consent -- blanket

5

consent to searches could be enforced with --

6

QUESTION:

In other words, he can waive his

7

right to be free from unreasonable searches, but not from

8

very unreasonable searches.

9

MR. STEWART:

I mean, certainly the -- the type

10

of -- there -- there would have to be some justification

11

for performing the search based on the fact that he was a

12

probationer, but again --

13

QUESTION:

I'll look at the laws.

I had thought

14

that under California law, for a second drug offense or a

15

third drug offense, you can get lifetime probation.

16

would you say -- let's say for a second offense, assuming

17

you could have probation for 20 years or a lifetime, the

18

Fourth Amendment right could be surrendered for that long?

19

MR. STEWART:

So,

I mean, I think if it were for a

20

third offense, I think yes.

21

legitimately make the judgment that a person who has three

22

times been convicted of drug offenses was, for the rest of

23

his life, meaningfully more likely to violate the criminal

24

law than the average citizen.

25

I think the State could

If you talked about another type of extreme

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

Page 27
1

example -- for instance, upon conviction for a traffic

2

violation, you'll be placed on lifetime probation under

3

which you can be searched at any time -- I think it would

4

be probably be irrational for the State to say simply

5

because you were convicted of a traffic violation, we will

6

regard you 20 years down the road as being more likely

7

than the average citizen to violate the law.

9

But the -- the point I was making about the -the potential terms of probation becoming more onerous, if

10

we got to a situation where because the conditions of

11

probation were especially harsh, large numbers of

12

probationers decided that incarceration is better than

this, then the -- an individual defendant's right to

choose between the two alternatives would have obvious

significance.

if he chose probation, was not unconstitutionally onerous.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HILARY A. FOX

21

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

22
23
24
25

MS. FOX:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Respondent's argument has two major points.
First, on the facts of this case, the Government has

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

Page 29

establish consent, California's blanket search condition,

or night, by any law enforcement officer, for any reason

or no reason, is unenforceable.

But second, even if the Government could

With regard to the first issue, the basis for

the consent argument here is a one-page probation order.

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

Page 31

think is very instructive as to whether this type of

2

agreement is an enforceable consent.

3

Carolina, of course, Mrs. Bumper did agree to -- consent

4

to a search of her house, but that's because she thought

5

that the searching officers had lawful authority to search

her house.

7

those circumstances was nothing more than acquiescence to

8

a show of lawful authority.

In Bumper v. North

So, the Court concluded that her consent under

In this case -QUESTION:

When, in fact, the lawful -- the

authority was not lawful.
MS. FOX:

Exactly.

And our argument here, Your

13

Honor, is that the probation order with form conditions,

14

one box checked being a search condition, sets forth a

15

blanket search condition that is not constitutional and

16

not enforceable, but that Mr. Knights, in agreeing to it,

17

would have had no way of knowing --

is that under Griffin, clearly it's not.

understand that is that this condition is not limited by

But Griffin, I don't think,

Here it's a consent case.

MS. FOX:

Yes, Your Honor.

What -- what the

13

Government, I believe, conceded is that even if they don't

14

rely on Griffin, they do have to -- have to acknowledge

15

some or find some rational relationship between the

16

condition and the needs of the probation.

17

California in the Supreme Court has construed this

18

condition in the Woods case, which I cited in my brief, to

19

authorize searches targeted at third parties who are not

20

on probation.

QUESTION:

you will be searched randomly.

on probation, you will be searched randomly.

What we do in respect to that in prison is we

When you are

Now, my question is, why in each of those
instances can the State not do the same thing?
MS. FOX:

Because, Your Honor, the rationale for

21

the limitation of prisoners' Fourth Amendment rights --

22

and they would apply also to individuals at halfway houses

23

-- is not that we take away rights as a punishment.

24

Rather, what the Court has held is that recognition of a

25

privacy right in a cell is incompatible with the unique

needs --

2

QUESTION:

I -- I thought -- then you're saying

3

we should -- if I were to tell you in my experience, which

4

is somewhat in this area -- I've had experience -- that

5

one of the purposes of punishment is incapacitation, and

6

you're saying that we couldn't have a punishment that

7

would be designed to do that by searching -- by searching

8

people's cells randomly to be sure that they're not

9

committing crimes in -- in a prison in order to make sure

10

-- I mean, I -- I had thought -- I'm not positive, but I

11

had thought that that was an important purpose.

12
13

MS. FOX:

Yes, it is a purpose of punishment,

Your Honor.

14

What I'm, I think, relying on in part is that in

15

Griffin this Court has previously held that probationers

16

do have Fourth Amendment rights, and that a probationer's

17

home, like anyone else's, is protected by the Fourth

18

Amendment.

19

QUESTION:

I'm not sure the Government has even

20

argued what Justice Breyer is suggesting, namely that I --

21

it follows from what he's suggesting that you could have

22

-- you could sentence somebody to nothing but the

23

incapacitation of forfeiting their Fourth Amendment

24

rights.

25

warrantless searches and seizures.

That is, I sentence to you 10 years of, you know,

QUESTION:

That actually isn't my question.

2

QUESTION:

Well --

3

(Laughter.)

4

QUESTION:

My question is designed to show you

5

-- to suggest that there is a purpose in searches that is

6

related to a basic aim of punishment.

7

MS. FOX:

8

QUESTION:

9

Certainly, Your Honor.
And so my -- my point is to suggest

to you to ask -- answer me as to why that same purpose

10

doesn't apply when, in fact, the person is on probation.

11

I may have overstated the case.

12

Justice Scalia.

13

(Laughter.)

14

QUESTION:

15
16

I obviously misled

And so, I will confine, not overstate

so that you can answer.
MS. FOX:

Your Honor, my answer would be that

17

any sentence imposed must be imposed within constitutional

18

limitations, and in this case, I think Griffin is an

19

essential case because Griffin helps us see what are the

20

constitutional limitations on probationers' Fourth

21

Amendment rights.

22

dictate that police searches have -- be based upon a

23

warrant, issued upon probable cause, and Griffin, like TLO

24

against New Jersey, and the other special needs cases

25

issued since, recognized that there is a limited class of

Obviously, the Fourth Amendment would

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

Page 37
1

cases in which special needs, beyond the normal needs of

2

general law enforcement, make the warrant and probable

3

cause requirements impractical.

4

that for a general law enforcement search, the Fourth

5

Amendment tells us that a warrant and probable cause are

6

not impractical by definition.

7

And what I would say is

So, what we have in the probation context is a

8

special need of probation supervision, a dual need that --

9

that includes both the monitoring and protection of the

10

community, which is the Government's main focus, but in

11

addition, rehabilitation.

12

were only that single focus of protecting the community,

13

it would not be a special need beyond the general needs of

14

law enforcement.

15

QUESTION:

And I submit to you that if it

Are you saying, in effect, yes,

16

Justice Breyer, you -- the Government could have a -- a

17

regime of probation in which they subject you to random

18

searches, but what the Government cannot do is have a

19

regime of probation in which you are subjected to

20

nonrandom searches, searches conducted not in supervision

21

of probationers, but searches conducted in the

22

investigation of specific crimes, and in the later case,

23

the -- the Government ought to follow normal Fourth

24

Amendment standards?

25

MS. FOX:

Is that, in effect, your answer?

Well, no, not quite, Your Honor,

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

Page 38
1

because I don't believe that the Court should or would

2

dispense with the reasonable suspicion requirement in this

3

situation.

4

There are, of course, very cases --

QUESTION:

Okay, add that to his hypo:

random

5

searches with reasonable suspicion.

6

sure, you can have a regime like that.

7

case that involves the -- the exercise of that kind of

8

power because in this case, you weren't having random

9

searches for probation supervision based on -- on

You would then say,
But this is not a

10

reasonable suspicion.

11

enforcement kind of search, and you should have gotten a

12

Fourth Amendment warrant.

You were having a full-blown law

Is that --

13

MS. FOX:

I believe that's -- that is correct.

14

QUESTION:

Good because that's exactly where I

15

am.

16

if that's so, how do you distinguish this particular case?

17
18

That's better -- that's exactly where I am.

QUESTION:

Yes.

But then

Why wasn't there reasonable

suspicion?

19

MS. FOX:

20

(Laughter.)

21

MS. FOX:

You may have gotten ahead of me.

The -- first, the district court found

22

reasonable suspicion and we disputed that, but that's the

23

district court's factual finding.

24

under Griffin, is not enough to make it a valid special

25

needs search.

That alone, at least

This was a police investigatory search as

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

Page 39
1

part of a 2-year investigation conducted without a

2

warrant, without probable cause.

3

So, for -- for it to be a proper probationary

4

search under Griffin, we believe it would have to satisfy

5

other requirements.

6

suggests, done at the direction of or with the advice of a

7

probation officer to show that the search was, in fact,

8

somehow related to the programmatic purpose of probation

9

supervision.

10

First, it would have to be, Griffin

And --

QUESTION:

Well, that -- that's part of my

11

problem with your argument.

12

programmatic purpose of probation to ensure that, A, he

13

doesn't use drugs, and B, he doesn't violate other laws?

14

MS. FOX:

Why isn't it part of the

For this reason, Your Honor.

In

15

Griffin, when it talked about the importance of deterrence

16

and -- and searches to ensure that the probationer is

17

compliant, the Court undertook a balancing of the degree

18

of intrusion and the importance of the need.

19

to the first factor, the degree of intrusion, was that the

20

search was only being performed by a probation officer.

21

The balancing turned out to be constitutional because it

22

was not a police officer conducting a police search.

23

QUESTION:

24

probation officer.

25

these questions.

And central

Well, Griffin upheld a search by a
I really don't think it answered all

I don't think it answered this question.

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

Page 40
1

And it is a concern to me that the whole thrust

2

of releasing someone on probation after a conviction of a

3

serious crime is to try to prevent that person from

4

committing other crimes, to try to encourage the person to

5

lead a law-abiding life for a sufficient period of time

6

that he can be totally released at the end of the day with

7

safety to the public.

8

that you provide a deterrent to people not to commit

9

further crimes, and that is exactly what this probation

10

term is all about.

11

MS. FOX:

12

And so, this is terribly important

Why isn't that eminently reasonable?
Your Honor, three reasons.

The first

is --

13

QUESTION:

And this very case, this person was

14

found to have all kinds of indications of having been

15

planning and perhaps having committed a number of very

16

serious offenses while on probation.

17

MS. FOX:

Your Honor, now I remember two of the

18

reasons.

19

-- on my client after a conviction for a misdemeanor, and

20

the Government's arguments, and the amici arguments in

21

particular, rely tremendously on the recidivism rates for

22

felony offenders and felony probationers and fail to point

23

out that in fact the recidivism rate for misdemeanant

24

probationers is substantially lower.

25

the magnitude of the threat that's been suggested to the

The first is that this probation was imposed on

So, I think the --

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

Page 41
1

Court has not been borne out by the facts.

2

QUESTION:

Are you suggesting then we draw a

3

line depending upon how serious the offense is?

4

don't commit a serious offense, but if you -- however, at

5

some probation you could attach this condition and other

6

probation you couldn't?

7

MS. FOX:

If you

Your Honor, this condition -- I -- no.

8

And I'll get to that in a minute.

9

would ever be -- I can't imagine when it would be an

I don't believe it

10

appropriate condition in light of the underpinnings of the

11

Fourth Amendment and our Constitution abhorrence for a

12

regime of unfettered search discretion.

13

that's what I'd like to get with Justice O'Connor.

14
15

And I think

But I do think that the magnitude of the threat,
the Court said in Edmonds, is never determinative --

16

QUESTION:

Well, then -- then one would never

17

know.

18

going to react to a search on reasonable suspicion like

19

this.

20

serious the offense was versus all the other balancing?

21

A police officer would never know how a court was

He -- he would have to evaluate for himself how

MS. FOX:

No, absolutely not, Your Honor.

The

22

-- the decision making would come at the time that the

23

court imposed sentence.

24

get to with Justice O'Connor is that, you know,

25

fundamentally the Fourth Amendment was, as the Court is

Now, because what I was going to

Page 42

well aware, adopted for many reasons, but primarily in

reaction to a system of general warrants, writs of

assistance, in which petty officials could invade

citizens' homes at will.

QUESTION:

That unfettered search --

Citizens who had not been convicted

of crimes and who had not been placed on probation.

7

MS. FOX:

8

QUESTION:

9

MS. FOX:

Yes.
This person is in a different status.
Yes, and it's only because he's a

10

probationer that he can be searched without a warrant at

11

all.

12

searched by anyone, let alone a probation officer.

13

Were he not a probationer, of course, he couldn't be

But to get back to the Justice's question, oh,

14

it's not for the officer in the field to determine.

15

point is that the court, in imposing sentence -- and the

16

First Circuit has gone into this in the Gianetta case,

17

which we cite -- has -- Gianetta suggested that where you

18

have a State that has failed to establish any kind of

19

regulatory scheme, such as the Wisconsin scheme, that

20

would limit the search discretion and indicate when

21

searches were appropriate, then in that case, a judge

22

could still impose a search condition, but it would be

23

appropriate for the judge to make some kind of factual

24

findings --

25

QUESTION:

The

But -- but I take it then a judge's

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

Page 43

finding wouldn't be conclusive necessarily.

2

attacked collaterally as not having been part of a system

3

or having been an erroneous application of the system?

4

MS. FOX:

It could be

No, I -- I think what the judge would

5

-- would do, in addition to making findings, is to impose

6

a --

7

QUESTION:

8

MS. FOX:

-- narrowly tailored search condition.

9

QUESTION:

Yes, but I'm talking to you about a

Well, but I'm talking --

10

situation where the judge says, you know, perhaps not

11

consistently with the system, but he says, in this

12

particular case, this person is subject to search on

13

reasonable suspicion.

14

recognizing that he has to balance perhaps the seriousness

15

of the offense, and he says, I balance it this way.

16

Now, when the person is searched and that

And the -- the judge says that,

17

evidence is sought to be admitted at his trial, can the

18

order of the judge be collaterally attacked by saying that

19

this judge just didn't reach the right balance in this

20

case?

21

MS. FOX:

Well, yes, Your Honor, though I don't

22

mean to suggest, in fact, that a condition that simply

23

required reasonable suspicion and did not ensure that it

24

was going to be probationary searches, would be

25

constitutional because the exception that we're talking

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

Page 44
1

with here, to the Fourth Amendment, is a special needs

2

exception.

3

And you only get to a special needs exception if the

4

searches that are being conducted are special need

5

searches.

6

And that -- that's what Griffin relied on.

QUESTION:

Well, Griffin relied on that but did

7

not say that there's -- that's the only condition.

8

it said the Wisconsin Supreme Court had -- had adopted a

9

-- a different principle, and we said -- we begin the

It --

10

opinion, we think the Wisconsin Supreme Court correctly

11

concluded that this warrantless search could not violate

12

the Fourth Amendment.

13

find it unnecessary to embrace a new principle of law, as

14

the Wisconsin court evidently did, that any search of a

15

probationer's home by a -- satisfy the Fourth Amendment.

16

We just didn't -- didn't consider whether we needed that

17

new principle of law and maybe that new principle of law

18

is at issue in this case.

To reach that result, however, we

19

MS. FOX:

Well, two answers to that, Your Honor.

20

QUESTION:

So, I mean, don't -- don't -- I don't

21

think Griffin precludes us from --

22

MS. FOX:

No, it doesn't.

However, I would

23

point out first that Griffin, even the -- the Wisconsin

24

Supreme Court was only talking about searches by probation

25

officers.

So, the issue --

Page 45
1

QUESTION:

Why -- why does that -- I mean,

2

what's bothering me from a policy perspective is there are

3

a whole range of punishments called intermediate

4

punishments, which perhaps should be encouraged, and they

5

include things like boot camp -- not boot camps, but

6

halfway houses, home confinement, night and weekend

7

confinement, and probation.

8

why is it unreasonable for the State to say we want to

9

encourage this kind of thing, but part of it has to be

That's one of them.

And so,

10

checkups on people to make certain that they're not

11

committing crimes?

12

checked here in the -- in the form is simply one of those

13

conditions that would help encourage, and indeed make more

14

sensible, this kind of range of intermediate punishments.

15

MS. FOX:

And the condition that you have

Well, Your Honor, as we point out in

16

our brief, the -- the intermediate sanction programs,

17

which have been implemented, I hope effectively, across

18

this country by different States that are cited by amicus

19

-- several of the amici -- not a single program relies on

20

random searches by police.

21

of an effective intensive supervision program, let alone a

22

regular probation system, in any State.

23

QUESTION:

It is simply not a component

I thought there were some other

24

States, in addition to California, that had as a condition

25

of probation that you -- your premises can be searched to

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

determine whether you are continuing -- whether you are

2

engaged in crime.

3

that respect.

4

MS. FOX:

I did not think California was alone in

Your Honor, apart from California, I'm

5

aware only of Virginia as having approved a blanket search

6

condition such as this with no limitations for

7

individualized suspicion and no limitation to the

8

probation officer.

9

as part of their duties, to conduct home searches.

10

QUESTION:

Many States permit probation officers,

Well, if we put individual suspicion

11

-- there was reasonable suspicion in this case.

12

admit that one of the purposes of probation is to monitor

13

the person to make sure that they are now off their

14

bottle, they're no longer committing crimes, if that's a

15

purpose of probation, then why isn't this an entirely

16

reasonable condition to say we have to check up on you to

17

see that you're not engaging in crime anymore?

18

MS. FOX:

If you

Because it's disproportionate.

19

Because what this condition purports to do, even if we --

20

if we put back a reasonable suspicion requirement, it

21

still gives police unfettered discretion, randomly,

22

arbitrarily, as often as they want, for no reason or any

23

reason to go into, as they did in this case, Mr. Knights'

24

home --

25

QUESTION:

Well, but counsel for the Government

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

represents to us that the State of California says that

2

this cannot be used for harassment.

MS. FOX:

there's not a single --

6

They do say that, Your Honor, although

QUESTION:

That's their argument.

So, it's not

-- so, it is not completely arbitrary.

7

MS. FOX:

Yes.

I -- I'm not sure whether

8

arbitrary and harassing are the same, in that if there's

9

no requirement of individualized suspicion, then it would

10

seem to me that there's certainly a broad range of --

11
12

QUESTION:
suspicion here.

13
14

And there was -- there was reasonable

MS. FOX:

Yes, yes.

I understand that in our

case.

15

QUESTION:

I mean, we just don't have the

16

extreme here.

17

looked like an eminently reasonable search, for goodness

18

sakes.

19

And -- and with the help of hindsight, it

MS. FOX:

Well, Your Honor, looking again at the

20

facts of our particular case, that officer, Detective

21

Hancock, had over 12 hours during which he prepared to do

22

this search.

23

exigent circumstances attached to it.

24

search for which he couldn't have gotten a warrant.

25

his own view, Detective Hancock believed he could have

So, it's clearly not a search that had
It's also not a

1

gotten a warrant, and in fact, he --

2

QUESTION:

Well, that's a perfectly good

3

argument against searching someone who's not on probation,

4

but it doesn't deal with your case to say they could have

5

gotten a warrant and it wasn't exigent circumstances.

6

MS. FOX:

Right.

I guess what I was thinking is

7

it shows that -- that expanding the Griffin probation

8

search condition, special needs doctrine, is not necessary

9

to enable Detective Hancock to search because he could

10

have searched a different way.

11

considering going beyond Griffin and endowing police

12

with --

13

QUESTION:

If the Court is

Well, you say -- you say going beyond

14

Griffin, I mean, Griffin described the Wisconsin system at

15

some length, but I don't think, as Justice Scalia

16

suggested, that we implied that every single facet of the

17

Wisconsin system was necessary to its constitutionality.

18

MS. FOX:

Certainly not, Your Honor, and I --

19

and I have not sought to represent that.

20

-- if Griffin means anything, what it does mean is that

21

there is some line between a probationary search and a

22

nonprobationary, general search.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

Otherwise --

Griffin means Wisconsin can do what

Wisconsin was doing.
MS. FOX:

But what Griffin

That's what it means.

Yes.

But it's not a one-line opinion

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

Page 49
1

that says --

2

QUESTION:

And it's very hard to take a case

3

that the defendant loses -- where there's a Fourth

4

Amendment claim that he loses and say, aha, but in the

5

next case, he'll win because the court confined itself to

6

the situation before it.

7

MS. FOX:

That's -- that's correct, Your Honor.

8

But I -- I believe the Griffin analysis, in going through

9

first considering who conducts the search, second,

10

considering the presence or absence of reasonable

11

suspicion, and then third, concluding that it's conducted

12

in conformance with the regulatory scheme that itself

13

limits discretion and is therefore constitutional --

14

QUESTION:

That's because we were not interested

15

in -- in contemplating the creation of any new

16

constitutional law.

17

prior constitutional law on -- on the basis of the special

18

needs doctrine.

19

special needs doctrine did not apply, the thing was

necessarily unconstitutional.

than we had to.

We said this can all be fit into

But we didn't intimate that if the

We didn't intimate that at

QUESTION:

May I ask you one question that I've

24

been pondering about during the argument and don't know

25

what the answer is?

Do you think it would be

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

Page 50
1

unconstitutional for a State legislature to decide that we

2

don't want to put drug offenders in prison anymore, but we

3

do want to impose on them, in haec verba, condition 9 of

4

the probation order here and that -- and pass a statute

5

and say all drug offenders who are convicted of possession

6

of illegal drugs shall have to submit to that provision?

7

MS. FOX:

Your Honor, I think it's a close

8

question.

9

I might argue against it, for this reason.

The -- the Court might well uphold it, although

10

permits random drug searches.

11

QUESTION:

12

MS. FOX:

The condition

Correct.
Now, that's clearly, I think,

13

constitutional if they were conducted by the probation

14

department.

15

but in various cases, this Court has repeatedly held that

16

detection of drug abuse may be a situation in which we

17

dispense with individualized suspicion because it's

18

difficult to detect always signs of inebriation.

to police searches.

intrusive than going to jail.

23

There's no reasonable suspicion requirement,

MS. FOX:

This

So -Right, but it seems to me that's less

It's -- well, again, I would never use

24

less intrusive than jail as a standard of assessing the

25

constitutionality of a probation condition because

certainly a condition that the defendant pay money to the

2

opposing party or the district attorney would be less

3

onerous than jail, but doesn't answer whether it's

4

constitutional.

this Court --

6

So, the Fourth Amendment analysis that

QUESTION:

Well, it does in a way because what

7

the -- the net result of a criminal conviction is a loss

8

of liberty, and the question is which liberties can you be

9

deprived of and so forth.

10

So, there's a definite

relationship.

11

MS. FOX:

12

(Laughter.)

13

QUESTION:

All right.

And you're saying that you can lose

14

your liberty by going to jail, but you can't lose this

15

lesser liberty.

16

doesn't prevail, but I don't -- I'm not at all sure why

17

this one doesn't.

18

I know every lesser included argument

MS. FOX:

It might.

It would be, again, a

19

different case.

20

may be again that the intrusion on privacy required of

21

urine testing or that you'd lose as a result of urine

22

testing is minimal compared to the kind of invasion of

23

privacy we're talking about here.

24
25

It would be an interesting case.

QUESTION:

But it

I don't see why it's magic that --

that a probation officer has to do it.

I mean, there are

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

Page 52
1

certain objectives that -- that the probation officer has

2

in common with the law enforcement officer, and -- and one

3

of them is to prevent individuals from committing

4

additional crimes.

5

whether it's a probation officer or a law enforcement

6

officer that is pursuing that purpose?

And what difference does it make

7

MS. FOX:

8

QUESTION:

9

probation officers?

You mean States have to have

10

probation officers?

Suppose -- suppose they just say we

11

don't feel any need for special probation officers.

12

MS. FOX:

Your Honor -What about a State that doesn't have

Well, this I think is the important

13

distinction between probation and police, and it's a two-

14

part answer.

15

First, under Scott, this Court has recognized

16

that police have different objectives than probation

17

officers.

18

-- to an extent, we are talking about a special needs

19

programmatic exception.

20

conducted by a probation officer, under Scott, the Court

21

will presume that the probation officer has a probationary

22

objective; whereas, again under Scott, a police search

23

does not have as its goal ascertaining compliance with

24

probation or parole conditions.

25

recognized that in determining that the exclusionary rule

And so to the extent that we're talking about a

Certainly when the search is

And the Court has

Page 53
1

wouldn't apply to parole revocation proceedings.

2

But second, in Edmonds, the Court indicated that

3

the fact that a general law enforcement search, as a

4

secondary matter, furthers special needs -- in that case

5

highway safety -- does not bring the search scheme within

6

the special needs exception because a secondary,

7

incidental furtherance of a special need doesn't change

8

the fundamental character at the programmatic level of the

9

search.

10

That's why police searches that are conducted

11

pursuant to this condition are so problematic because, of

12

course, as a secondary matter, they ensure compliance with

13

probation conditions, but the primary objective of a

14

police search, as -- as it was the objective this search

15

in this case, is to investigate crime.

16

Fourth Amendment, we've already decided as a society that

17

the hurdles of requiring a warrant and requiring probable

18

cause are acceptable costs to impose on the police when

19

they're engaged in general law enforcement.

20

this condition is unconstitutional.

And under the

That's why

21

The Government's consent argument that we

22

started with doesn't save it for the reasons that I

23

suggested earlier.

QUESTION:

You said something in your brief

about the unconstitutional conditions doctrine rarely

applies in Fourth Amendment cases.

2

didn't you?

3

Now, you did say that,

MS. FOX:

That's my understanding, yes, Your

5

QUESTION:

And why do you think that's so?

6

MS. FOX:

4

Honor.

I think the special needs balancing is

7

the unconstitutional doctrines -- unconstitutional

8

conditions doctrine in the Fourth Amendment situation.

9

It's -- it's virtually an identical balancing, and I think

10

this Court, in assessing Fourth Amendment issues, again

11

and again has returned to the special needs balancing,

12

which is particular to the privacy interests and the State

13

needs that the Court faces when resolving a Fourth

14

Amendment case.

15

conditions, I think it's achieving the same end by

16

requiring a central nexus and then, most importantly,

17

looking at proportionality.

sorry, Your Honor.

So, when you look at unconstitutional

I think that's what -- I'm

Mr. Stewart, you have 2 minutes remaining.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOM L. STEWART

22

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

23

Thank you, Ms. Fox.

MR. STEWART:

The State of California has

24

represented in its amicus brief that the State has a

25

little over 67,000 police officers and a little over 7,000

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

Page 55

probation officers within the State.

2

fact, California has, by conditioning probation on consent

3

to search by any probation officer or law enforcement

4

officer -- the State has, in effect, attempted to enlist

5

its police officers in the administration of the probation

6

program.

7

And in light of that

The core message that this -- excuse me -- that

8

this consent term sends to police officers within the

9

State is, if you suspect that a known probationer is in

10

violation of the most fundamental term of his release --

11

namely, he's committing future crimes -- you may conduct a

12

search that is designed to confirm or dispel that

13

suspicion --

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. STEWART:

16

Or -- or even you don't suspect.

But -- but --

17
18

Or even you don't suspect.

QUESTION:

But, I mean, that -- that's the

problem.

19

MR. STEWART:

I think it's probably more likely

20

that a probation officer would conduct a truly

21

suspicionless search, a search with no individualized

22

suspicion whatever, than that a police officer would do

23

so.

24

checks of his charges even if there were no reason to

25

believe that a particular individual was violating the

A probation officer might decide to conduct spot

law.

A police officer would be less likely to regard that

2

as an effective use of his resources and -- and the

3

department's resources.

4

But -- but the point here is that when a State

5

police officer conducts a search intended to confirm or

6

dispel the suspicion that a probationer is engaged in new

7

criminal activity, he is contributing directly and

8

precisely to the realization of a core probation purpose.

9

I have nothing further.
