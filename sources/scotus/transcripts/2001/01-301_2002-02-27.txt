ORAL ARGUMENT OF STANLEY A. CROSS

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9
10

MR. CROSS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
AEDPA's language, purpose, and legislative

11

history supports the conclusion that the circuit conflict

12

over the meaning of pending in 28 U.S.C., section

13

2244(d)(2) can be resolved by reversing the Ninth Circuit

14

for one or more of the following three reasons.

15

First, the Ninth Circuit improperly permits

16

tolling for substantial delay if the State Supreme Court

17

addresses the merits when denying an application for

18

collateral review.

19

Second, under California's system of successive

20

original petitions, nothing is pending under State or

21

Federal law following the denial of an application for

22

collateral review and prior to the proper filing of a new

23

application for review.

24
25

And third, the gap theory relied upon by the
district court more accurately reflects congressional

4
1

intent and the policy judgments underlying AEDPA's 1-year

2

statute of limitations than does the Ninth Circuit's

3

interpretation of pending --

4

QUESTION:

Mr. Cross, would you explain to us

5

what it is in California -- what is the system and the

6

time within which post-conviction relief can be applied

7

for in California courts?

8

filing it with the trial court level?

9

MR. CROSS:

Is there any time limit for

It's within a reasonable time, Your

10

Honor, the general rule of timeliness.

However, within a

11

reasonable time has parameters which I can give you the

12

case of In re Harris, a California Supreme Court case,

13

which addresses that.

14

in footnote 7.

15

829.

16

regarding timeliness is the habeas corpus petition must be

17

filed within a reasonable time after the petitioner

18

counsel knew or with due diligence should have known the

19

facts underlying the claim, as well as the legal basis of

20

the claim.

Specifically, it says the following

That's -- the cite is 5 Cal.4th at 828-

Footnote 7 says the following.

The general rule

They then follow that up with two significant

21
22

points.

The first is, is that ineffective assistance of

23

counsel claims, which is the claim in this particular

24

litigation, should be filed as a verified -- excuse me --

25

a verified petition jointly with the direct appeal.

In

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

5
1

other words, if you know about the claim, you should file

2

it at that time.

3

Now, as far as how long you should be able to

4

wait, the rules specifically state with regard to capital

5

cases, which are considered to be much more complex than

6

the average non-capital case, they give them a 90-day

7

period in which there is a presumption of timeliness so

8

that there is no substantial delay.

9

presumption that you have not exceeded substantial delay

10

if you do it within 90 days.

11

QUESTION:

12

Now, here there was a

prompt filing in the -- at the trial court level.

13

MR. CROSS:

14

QUESTION:

15

All right.

You have a

Pardon?
Here there was a prompt filing at the

trial court level for habeas, State habeas.
MR. CROSS:

16

I would -- Your Honor, I would

17

respectfully disagree that it was prompt since he waited 5

18

years --

19

QUESTION:

Well, all right.

It was -- it was

20

within the statutory period that we have imposed for these

21

situations where it had -- AEDPA became effective.

22
23

MR. CROSS:

He filed his claim with 7 days

remaining --

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. CROSS:

Okay.
-- in the grace period of the

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

6
1

statute of limitations.

2

QUESTION:

Now, after the trial court resolved

3

it and denied relief, then there's no review mechanism

4

other than filing an original writ with the court of

5

appeals?

6

MR. CROSS:

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. CROSS:

9

QUESTION:

Correct.
Is that how it's done?
Correct, in California.
And is that again a reasonable time

10

period within which to seek review by that mechanism in

11

the court of appeals?
MR. CROSS:

12

Or is there a time limit?
As far as the -- the time between

13

each original petition, there is no time limit.

14

be looking at the overall time period because you're

15

dealing with -- Your Honor, with original petitions here.

16

So he has every right in California to go directly to the

17

California Supreme Court or the Third District Court of

18

Appeal.
QUESTION:

19
20

You would

Well, that's the traditional rule in

habeas corpus, at least in -- in England.

21

MR. CROSS:

Correct.

22

QUESTION:

Wasn't it?

That you could go from

23

one court to another and have -- have a different judge

24

look at it in a different proceeding and get a different

25

result.

MR. CROSS:

2

QUESTION:

Absolutely, Your Honor.
But if he goes -- if he's -- I take

3

it, under the California system, if he starts in the

4

Supreme Court of California, and there's a fact issue,

5

they're going to say, go back to the trial court and start

6

there.

7

they?

They're not going to have a factual trial, are

9

MR. CROSS:

In fact, Your Honor, I'd like to

correct a misunderstanding that's promoted by the

10

respondent's brief.

11

31, it gives the impression that you are indicating that

12

if you were to go directly to the California Supreme

13

Court --

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. CROSS:

If you look at the red brief at page

Whereabouts on page 31?
On page 31 at the top paragraph,

16

there's a reference in the third line to In re Hillery.

17

Then there's a reference, the Ninth Circuit case, Harris

18

v. Superior Court, indicating that California appellate

19

courts may refuse to entertain habeas and that it be sent

20

back to the trial court.

21

law, and I'll refer you to the actual footnote on that

22

page, footnote 19, referring to California Rule of Court

23

56(a)(1).

24
25

That's an incorrect statement of

The problem with respondent's position is that
he gives a literal quote of 56(a)(1) and it sounds like

ignores to cite to the subsection (h), which is, as of

which specifically states, quote -- and the title of the

subsection is proceedings not covered by this rule.

QUESTION:

Well, what happens --

10

QUESTION:

So, you -- you can begin in a higher

11

court.

12

MR. CROSS:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. CROSS:

15

QUESTION:

Yes.
You don't have to begin -Right, correct.
What happens if you do begin in a

16

higher court and -- and there are disputed factual issues?

17

How do they resolve the factual issues?

18

MR. CROSS:

The -- that is explained, Your

19

Honor, in Harris v. Superior Court, the Ninth Circuit

20

opinion --

21

QUESTION:

Well, I haven't read --

22

QUESTION:

Why don't you tell us?

23

MR. CROSS:

I will tell you, Your Honor.

The --

24

the way it is handled is the California Supreme Court

25

around 1969 set up a procedure in which for original

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

9
1

petitions in the appellate court that are filed there,

2

either in the -- the district court of appeal or the

3

California Supreme Court, they can have a special master,

4

or they can send it back to the trial court, so that

5

there's no prevention from them taking the court and

6

deciding it with or without the hearing.

7

facie case must be made to them in order for those --

8
9
10

QUESTION:

But a prima

Did -- in the proceedings involved in

this particular case, did either of the appellate courts
go the -- do that?
MR. CROSS:

11

No.

There was -- the -- the

12

district court of appeal is a one-line denial, simply

13

stating denied.

14

petition was denied on the merits and for lack of

15

diligence.

And in the California Supreme Court, the

16

QUESTION:

But in this --

17

QUESTION:

What happens just as a practical

18

matter?

You go to the superior court on a collateral

19

attack with a -- with a petition for a writ, and the court

20

makes lots of findings and rulings of law.

21

rulings of law are absolutely wrong, but still, the

22

ultimate outcome may be in doubt.

23

petitioner, the original petitioner, wants to go to the

24

court of appeals.

25

-- in the superior court just for the enlightenment of the

Some of those

And so then the

Does -- does he annex what happens in

10
1

court of appeals as to what the issues are or what the

2

wrong rulings were, what the right rulings were, what the

3

findings were?

4

MR. CROSS:

The forms, Your Honor, are in the

5

joint appendix where you are expected to indicate -- it's

6

-- all three petitions use the same judicial counsel form.

7

California Supreme Court petition -- if you want to look,

8

it starts at page 31.

9

question which asks the defendant if they've sought review

And there -- I believe there is a

10

in another court and to explain what the finding was of

11

that court and what claims were requested.

12

for example, question 9, did you seek review in the --

13

excuse me.

14
15
16

QUESTION:

That would be,

Well, it's just background.

I -- I

see where to find it now.
MR. CROSS:

The -- that's the extent of it.

And

17

so, the purpose of that question is to determine whether

18

or not it's a -- it's a successive petition so they cannot

19

-- if they had gone to the lower court, it can't be

20

remanded back because the -- if the petition has been

21

denied in the lower court, they don't want to send it back

22

for an evidentiary hearing to the same judge or court who

23

has gone through the proceeding before and denied it.

24
25

QUESTION:

Well, getting to the issue in the

case, the respondent's brief points out that under the

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

11
1

theory you propose, what would happen if it's the -- the

2

State that's appealing or filing a new -- not appealing,

3

but filing a new action?

4

in the lower court, and then the State files an action.

5

How -- how would you count that or not count that so far

6

as the limitations period is concerned?

7

MR. CROSS:

The -- the prisoner wins in --

That is the most difficult question

8

that is posed, without question, Your Honor.

The response

9

I would have is it appears to me that Congress perhaps did

10

not think of that particular scenario other than perhaps

11

that under 2244(d)(1)(B), the State-created impediment

12

issue would take care of the extreme case where the --

13

where the State was trying to prevent the person's time

14

from --

15
16

QUESTION:
prevails --

17

MR. CROSS:

18

QUESTION:

19

Right.
-- in superior court, and by statute,

now California allows the State to appeal that.

20

MR. CROSS:

21

QUESTION:

22

This is the case where the petitioner

Correct, Your Honor.
Well, certainly that would be -- that

would be pending all that time, would it not?

23

MR. CROSS:

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. CROSS:

If you -Or would it not?
If you take the position that it's

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

12
1

not an appellate system in a State like California, I

2

don't think it would be.

3

QUESTION:

Well, but you know, it can -- it

4

could be not an appellate system from the point of view of

5

the petitioner who has to have an original petition each

6

-- each time he goes again to a new court.

7

legislature said, with respect to the State, if the -- if

8

the State loses, it can appeal, then that would be an

9

appellate proceeding, wouldn't it?
MR. CROSS:

10

But the

For California -- under California

11

law, Your Honor, absolutely.

But as far as this statute

12

is concerned, I think we're interested in what the Federal

13

law is and how the Congress would have viewed it.

14

QUESTION:

So, looking at how Federal law --

15

QUESTION:

But I -- but -- if -- if I may, just

16

one moment, Justice Breyer.
What the Chief Justice suggests is that I -- I

17
18

did not pose a problem because what happens is is that the

19

State simply appeals the -- what it thinks to be the

20

erroneous ruling, and that means the action is still

21

pending.

22

that you thought there was a bigger problem than that.

23

But I -- I thought from our earlier interchange

MR. CROSS:

I think there is a bigger problem

24

because if there is -- it depends on when finality occurs,

25

and if -- if you have an original proceeding and the

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

would assume, start at least under California law.

4

subsection (c) --

QUESTION:

The

Well, but the Chief Justice suggests

6

it's not rocket science for us to say it's still pending

7

if there's an appeal.

8

QUESTION:

Well, I -- I thought your --

9

QUESTION:

Or am I missing something?

10

QUESTION:

I am confused now.

I thought your

11

position was that the case may well be pending, as Justice

12

Kennedy says, but there's no application pending --

13

MR. CROSS:

14

QUESTION:

Correct.
-- on the appeal.

The application

15

has been disposed of in the first court.

16

appeal, but there's no longer an application pending.

17

that's how the statute reads, not the case is pending.

18

MR. CROSS:

19

QUESTION:

There's an
And

Right.
There is an appeal?

I thought that

20

what happened -- I guess I'm mixed up.

21

Justice O'Connor.

22

thought that they -- but that there is -- first of all,

14
1

QUESTION:

But almost always they'll go to the

2

superior court and file a petition.

And then in every

3

other State, the losing party would appeal, but in

4

California, they use different words.

5

you appeal; the words are you file a new petition in the

6

court of appeals.

7

words are not you have 10 days to seek review in the

8

Supreme Court; the words are you have whatever time you

9

want.

The words are not

And indeed, if you lose there, the

You have to file a new petition in the Supreme

10

Court, but if you're too late, they're going to tell you

11

you're too late.

12

So, it functions exactly as if the words were

13

the following.

14

will say 60 days, but in California it says within a

15

reasonable time.

16

You must appeal within -- now, normally it

Now, those aren't the words of the statute, but

17

that's how it functions.

And if we don't read it that way

18

for purposes of Federal law, I guess we'd have to say that

19

in 10,000 case a year in the California superior courts

20

involving State habeas petitions -- as soon as those are

21

decided, they have to come here because they're all final

22

decisions of the State Supreme Court.

23

the courts of appeals in California.

24

final, they have to come here.

25

And 5,000 cases in
Once they said

So, we better have 20,000

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

15

because California happens to use the word final and new

2

petition instead of using the word appeal.

3

Now, what's wrong with what I said?

4

MR. CROSS:

What's wrong with what you said,

5

Your Honor, first of all, is that although California may

6

say that it's final at that level, it does not prevent the

7

individual from going to either of the other two next

8

levels or skipping one and going to the other because they

9

are in fact original and in fact not -- it's more than

10

just mere semantics because they can go to California with

11

different claims.

12

at all.

It doesn't have to be the same petition

QUESTION:

13

Justice Breyer suggests that when you

14

go, say, from the superior court to the district court of

15

appeal, it's -- it's like an appeal.

16

a transcript of the record made in the superior court that

17

you have to file with the district court of appeal like

18

you would in other appeals?
MR. CROSS:

19

Typically not.

Well, now, is there

There could be some

20

circumstances, under rare circumstances, where the

21

superior court would have some sort of evidentiary

22

hearing.

23

There would be a transcript.
QUESTION:

Do you have to file a notice of

24

appeal in the superior court to go to the district court

25

of appeal?

or whatever it is to go to the court of appeals.

2

that's denied, you have X number of days to go to the

3

State Supreme Court.

4

If

Now, in a State like that, is it the case that

5

in applying AEDPA in this statute of limitations, that we

6

exclude all of the time for decision making as well as

7

that statutory time within which to file the appeal?

8

MR. CROSS:

9

QUESTION:

10
11

AEDPA grants -Is that what a majority of courts are

holding?
MR. CROSS:

The majority of courts are holding

12

that -- and the statute specifically provides for tolling

13

for all the time in which the decision -- excuse me -- in

14

which the petition is before a court.

15

specifically provided.

16

QUESTION:

That's, you know,

Well, yes, but is it -- is it the

17

case that most courts are holding, under the scheme I

18

described, that not only while the court is deciding it,

19

but the time allowed to enable them to go to the next

20

higher court is excluded as well?

21

MR. CROSS:

The majority of courts are holding

22

that you will get time for the appeal time that's

23

specified by the State, for example, 60 days or 90 days.

24
25

QUESTION:

Yes, all right.

So, the problem with

California is we have no time specified.

We have a

reasonable time.

How are we supposed to decide what's

2

reasonable in California?

3

back to the California Supreme Court and say, was this a

4

reasonable time?

Should we certify a question

How do we know?

5

MR. CROSS:

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. CROSS:

One -What do we do?
One suggestion that was made in the

8

amicus briefs by the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation is

9

to adopt the nearest analogous State rule, which in

10

California under rule 2 or 30 through 31 would be 60 days.

11

That's one thing that could be done by the court which

12

would stretch the statutory language to -- to bring

13

California into an appellate system which -QUESTION:

Wouldn't that be up to California to

What we have is a system that allows a reasonable
I'm asking you how we determine what is a

MR. CROSS:

I think, Your Honor, the way to

19

determine a reasonable time would be to look at the

20

California rules for their original habeas petitions and

21

determine that under California law, we know that -- that

22

you are expected to file no longer than 90 days in a

23

capital case without having a presumption of timeliness --

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. CROSS:

May I just interrupt -And that would be the absolute

reasonable.

3

QUESTION:

But may I just ask this question?

If

4

in this case the California court did decide on the merits

5

-- apparently -- it's a little ambiguous, but it seems to

6

-- wouldn't that definitely disclose a decision that it

7

was reasonable?

8

They took jurisdiction.

MR. CROSS:

No, Your Honor.

I -- I believe that

9

the -- the interpretation would be that even though a -- a

10

State Supreme Court decided, at least alternatively on the

11

merits -- simply indicates that for one reason or another,

12

they decided to perhaps excuse untimeliness if they didn't

13

have a -- an untimeliness finding --

QUESTION:

To excuse untimeliness, they're

saying in this particular case we think it must have been

18
19

Aren't -- isn't that -- doesn't that

MR. CROSS:

In this particular case, they said

he acted with a lack of diligence.

20

QUESTION:

But that might have been --

21

QUESTION:

No, but it didn't excuse

22

untimeliness.

Untimeliness was one of the two bases for

23

their decision, wasn't it?

24

MR. CROSS:

25

QUESTION:

In this case, absolutely.
We don't know whether that

untimeliness was the 5 years that he took to even get

2

started.

3

There's one fact question here that may make the

4

rest of this rather abstract.

This petitioner says that

5

he never got notice of the -- of the intermediate

6

appellate court's decision and he -- when he did -- I

mean, the only gap here that's relevant for AEDPA -- the 5

And he says, as to that, I never knew.

I wrote a

There is no -- there's been no determination by

15

anybody whether that 4-and-a-half-month interval was

16

beyond his control.

17

would be an exception for situations beyond his control.

18

So, how do we determine whether there was any lack of

19

diligence with respect to that 4-and-a-half months?

20

record is totally blank on it.

21

MR. CROSS:

I mean, you recognize that there

This

Your Honor, this situation is even

22

more perplexing than what you set forth because there are

23

three possibilities.

the California is returning to -- referring to.

possibility it's just the 4-and-a-half-month.

One is that it's the 5-year period

third possibility is the combination of all of those

2

periods.

3
4

The question simply is what is meant by timely
and what is meant by properly pursuing.

5

QUESTION:

Well, and also I think what is meant

6

by pending because if -- if we were -- if it were

7

determined that these separate matters, as you say, before

8

three different courts were pending only during the time

9

those particular courts had them for consideration, it

10

might be quite a different result than if you say look at

11

the reasonableness of the whole series of proceedings

12

together.
MR. CROSS:

correct.

Your Honor, absolutely that is

that regardless of the length of the delay, which could be

not just 4-and-a-half months in this case, but 4-and-a-

MR. CROSS:

QUESTION:

That's -And if that -- if those are the

4

objectives of the statute -- and I thought they were --

5

then California, in effect, or any State can control the

6

proceedings simply by its own time schedule.

7

MR. CROSS:

Your Honor, that is certainly one of

8

the objectives of the statute, but there are a number of

9

policy interests related to the statute of limitations

10

itself which is part of AEDPA.

11

in that finality is one of the three main concerns of

12

AEDPA itself, but there are other concerns and policy

concerns related to the statute itself.

14

QUESTION:

You're absolutely correct

Mr. Cross, a State Supreme Court that

15

had that attitude, that didn't care that you were late,

16

would not -- would not have dismissed this case on two

17

grounds, one of which is it's untimely.

we have here.

is; we're going to decide it on the merits.

merits as an alternative ground.

merits, we ought to take the -- the State Supreme Court at

its word and say, if there was a merits determination, it

Why isn't that an equally good interpretation?

A State that was really concerned about

Therefore, if it does

I think, Your Honor, this Court has

stated before in Coleman v. Thompson that we -- that you

don't want to direct the State courts how to issue their

rulings for whatever State reasons they have for doing it.

things and they seem to be in contradiction -- if it's

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID W. OGDEN

14

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

15
16
17

MR. OGDEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I would like to go directly to the two most

18

difficult questions that I need to answer this morning and

19

which have been addressed extensively thus far.

20

First, that the rule adopted by the -- by the

21

unanimous courts of appeals that any gaps between stages

22

of the State habeas process should be tolled so long as

23

the next stage is initiated in a timely fashion should

24

apply to California.

25

And second --

28
1
2

QUESTION:

What happens if it -- go on.

Give us

your second --

3

MR. OGDEN:

And -- and the second point that I'd

4

like to address is that under that rule on the record in

5

this case, there is an insufficient basis to conclude that

6

the filing in the State Supreme Court was late and

7

therefore that the judgment below should be affirmed.

8
9
10
11

QUESTION:

Are you going to cover the question

of whether these various actions were pending and for how
long?
MR. OGDEN:

Yes, Your Honor.

That's the first

12

-- that's -- that's the first subject that I'd like to

13

cover because I know that one of the concerns and one of

14

the difficulties of this case is applying the concepts of

15

the statute to California's unique system.

16

Now, California's system of original writ should

17

be subject to the rule that tolls the entire period of

18

time for two reasons.

19

understanding of the text of the statute because

20

California's system --

21
22
23
24
25

QUESTION:

First, that is the best

The text of AEDPA or the text of

California's statute?
MR. OGDEN:

Of AEDPA, Your Honor, of -- of

section 2244(d)(2).
Because California's system functions as an

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

29
1

integrated appellate style process for prisoners seeking

2

to exhaust State remedies.

3

And second, because just as in other States, the

4

so-called gap theory espoused by the State would

5

discourage prisoners from making full use of California's

6

process and encourage premature Federal filings.

7

Now, turning to the text of the statute -- and

8

Justice Scalia asked about the -- about the word

9

application in particular -- Congress wrote a statute in

10

general terms intended to apply nationwide.

11

turn on the particular form of pleading or the nature of

12

the action.

13

meaning of the statute is simply a request for relief so

14

long as it is submitted in the context of, as the statute

15

phrases it, State post-conviction or other collateral

16

review.

17

It does not

To the contrary, an application within the

Now, that request for relief is distinct from

18

the claims that support it, and it is pending so long as

19

it -- as it is unresolved in the State system.

20

QUESTION:

You -- you say the -- the application

21

is distinct from the claim.

22

does that work out?

23

MR. OGDEN:

Granted, both words -- how

The claims are the arguments that

24

support the request for relief in -- in a habeas or post-

25

conviction context.

Typically the request is to be

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

30
1

released from an unconstitutional confinement.

That

2

request is supported by -- by a set of claims.

And -- and

3

it's the request that constitutes the application.

4

QUESTION:

But, you know, we were confronted

5

with precisely the same argument in Artuz which dealt with

6

what constitutes a properly filed application.

7

argument was if the claim is not a proper claim, if it

8

does not lie under the State law, it is not a properly

9

filed application.

And the

And we held, no, that's not so.

An

10

application is an application and a claim is -- is a

11

claim.

12

long as it's given to the -- you know, to the proper clerk

13

in the proper court and -- and so forth.

14

with the very same -- very same provision of law.

15

And the -- the application is properly filed so

MR. OGDEN:

Yes, Your Honor.

Now, dealing

I believe my

16

argument is entirely consistent with Artuz.

17

-- it's really based on the reasoning there.

18

Indeed, it's

Artuz makes a distinction between bars that go

19

to claims and bars that go to the form of the -- of the

20

application itself.

21

is the request for relief, that is, regardless of what

22

form it takes and what kind of proceeding, it is a request

23

that contains claims in the same way that an application

24

contains claims.

25

request, the request for relief, continues to be pending

My submission is that the application

A request is an application.

And that

31
1

within the meaning of the statute until the -- until it is

2

resolved within the State system.

3

Now, in the California system, that request for

4

relief, that request to be released from confinement,

5

continues to be unresolved so long as there is another

6

court to which one can bring a -- a petition to review a

7

decision.

8
9

QUESTION:

Or presumably you could go back and

forth to a number of California courts, if you come up

10

with, you know, a different argument and that sort of

11

thing.

12

MR. OGDEN:

Yes, Your Honor, you could present

13

different claims.

14

functions is that the -- the design of it where factual

15

development is required, quite naturally, is that that

16

claim should be brought in the superior court.

17

But the way the California system

As we say in our brief, if you attempt to file

18

an original petition initially in a higher court and

19

factual development is required, typically if it's a non-

20

capital case, what that court will do is to issue an order

21

to show cause, returnable in the superior court.

22

you are there as a -- as a petitioner, if you lose, your

23

only recourse for further review is to file an original

24

petition yet again above.

25

And once

Now, critically from the standpoint of

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

32
1

understanding whether this is an appellate system or a

2

system of completely independent free-standing

3

applications, it's important to understand that when one

4

goes from the superior court where one develops a record,

5

Your Honor, to -- to the court of appeal, that -- that

6

next filing is not considered a successive petition under

7

California law.

8
9
10

It's not considered a second --

QUESTION:

What do you mean -- what do you mean

by a -- do you mean the same thing as an original
petition?

11

MR. OGDEN:

12

QUESTION:

13

the term successive?

14

MR. OGDEN:

It's called an original writ.
Yes.

So, what -- what do you mean by

Successive petition is a procedural

15

bar under California law, which if you bring a second

16

petition that contains claims that could have been, but

17

were not, contained in your first petition or that

18

contains the same claims as were contained in your first

19

petition, it's dismissed as a matter of procedural law in

20

California as a successive petition.

21

petition bar does not apply --

22

QUESTION:

That successive

What does it look like in practice?

23

I mean, I had thought, as you were saying, that whatever

24

they call it, they call the trial court original, they

25

call the court of appeals original, they call the supreme

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

33
1

court original.

2

who wasn't looking at the names, it would look pretty much

3

like any other State where you get an initial hearing and

4

then you get some appeals.

5

But despite that, to an outside observer

Now, there's obviously the difference, you could

6

file new claims at the second level, but leaving that

7

aside, it would look -- now, the attorney general said I'm

8

wrong on that, absolutely wrong, that that isn't what it

9

looks like, that sometimes at least it's random, sometimes

10

they -- they -- just as many might likely file, I guess,

11

in the court of appeals as the district court.

12

file in the supreme court.

Maybe they look for appeal in

13

the -- in the trial court.

I don't know.

14

random and -- and, indeed, if you go to the court of

15

appeals, you'll see they don't even look at the record in

16

the trial court.

17

All right.

He's been around a long time.

19

sure what to do frankly.
MR. OGDEN:

20

They might

But it's a

difficult because so much of this turns on California law.

It is then

When you say it is then filed, what

do you mean by it?
MR. OGDEN:

A petition encompassing the same

claims is filed in the court of appeal and then again in

18

the supreme court.

19

First of all, the record is -- the record

generally forms the basis for that review.

And in Gardner

21

against California in 1969, looking at this very system

22

for -- for handling habeas petitions on original writ,

23

this Court decided that the system was sufficiently

24

similar to an appellate process that a habeas petitioner

Mr. -- Mr. Cross said -- and it would

be extraordinary if it's record review, but you don't have

Do you have to?

MR. OGDEN:

You certainly can file the record

I don't know the answer to that,

Your Honor, as to whether it's required.

QUESTION:

MR. OGDEN:

Is it ordinarily done?
I -- I think ordinarily there -- the

MR. OGDEN:

QUESTION:

That's a very, very vague

Well -What we want to know is typically in

an appeal, you'd have a record from the superior court.

15

You're appealing from the superior court or the district

17

It's a part of the -- before the court of appeals will

hear your claim.

19

MR. OGDEN:

The best I can do, Your Honor, is to

20

refer to these three cases -- the Resendez case, the

21

California Supreme Court decision at -- which I've given

22

the cite for; In re Wright, which is 78 Cal. App. 3d at

23

801 to 802; People against Singer, which is 226 Cal. App.

24

25

record, and where what is presented are findings of fact

by the superior court that are based on credibility

determinations, great weight is given to those credibility

determinations by the reviewing court.

7

the -- the fundamental functionality, the way the system

8

works.

9

And -- and that is

It can be used in other ways without question.

10

A petitioner can attempt to file, you know, claims at a

11

higher level.

12

QUESTION:

You've practiced here a lot.

I mean,

13

if the -- if the superior court decision in a State habeas

14

matter is a final decision and there's no more review of

15

it in the State, I guess then we have jurisdiction to

17

directly from the decision of the superior court of

18

California in a State habeas matter.

19

haven't thought of it.

20
21
22

But I have never seen someone come here

MR. OGDEN:

Maybe they just

Well, no, Your Honor, they're not

permitted to, and I think that's a very important -QUESTION:

We wouldn't issue habeas when -- when

you have failed to exhaust all of your State remedies

whether it's by appeal or not by appeal.

have State remedies available, we wouldn't issue Federal

It -- it would be useless to come here.
MR. OGDEN:

This -- this Court's decision in the

3

O'Sullivan case has been applied by the Ninth Circuit in

4

-- in the case called James against Giles, which states

5

that it is a requirement, in order to fully exhaust one's

6

State remedies, that one file and submit one's claims to

7

the California Supreme Court.

8

QUESTION:

9

Of course, and that applies whether

it's an appeal or whether it's an independent action.

10

mean, it -- it sheds no light upon -- upon the central

11

issue here.

12

MR. OGDEN:

13

QUESTION:

Well, I -Whichever one it is, you have to

14

exhaust those remedies before you apply for Federal

15

habeas.

16

MR. OGDEN:

I

I think it sheds substantial light

17

on it, Your Honor, because as was made clear in Duncan

18

against Walker by this Court, the very purpose of this

19

tolling provision is to facilitate and to, indeed, promote

20

the full and complete exhaustion of State remedies.

21

QUESTION:

Okay.

Well, let me ask you this.

22

Suppose that a -- a prisoner has filed in California for

23

State post-conviction review in the superior court and

24

then in the court of appeals and then makes no filing in

25

the State supreme court, could but years go by.

Then

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

39
1

there's a petition filed for habeas in the Federal court.

2

Now, the Federal court under your view presumably would

3

have to say, no, it's still pending in the State court.

4
5

MR. OGDEN:

I believe the appropriate course for

the Federal court in that situation --

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. OGDEN:

What would you do?
-- would be to apply this Court's

8

decision in O'Sullivan against Boerckel and deem the

9

petition to be unexhausted.

10

could apply to the California Supreme Court.
QUESTION:

11
12

At that point, the petitioner

And say it is unexhausted and -- and

the -- a Federal statute of limitations hasn't run.
MR. OGDEN:

13

Because simply it's unknowable.

You

14

asked the question earlier whether -- who decides whether

15

it's a reasonable time or not, and I think it's very clear

16

the design of the statute of -- of 2244(d)(2) is that the

17

State of California decides.

18

to be pending in exhaustion law is a question of whether

19

it is possible whether there is a -- an available

20

procedure under State law to raise the claim to a higher

21

level.

What is the position that you urge

upon us here in that instance?

MR. OGDEN:

Your Honor, I don't believe it's --

14

it is important for my client what the answer to that

15

question is because the second point I want to make this

16

morning is that the submission to the California Supreme

17

Court was not late under California law.

QUESTION:

I'm trying to -- I'm trying to

want to know how it would come out --

MR. OGDEN:

QUESTION:

23

MR. OGDEN:

I think the most --- under your view.
I'm sorry.

I think the most natural

24

interpretation of the statute is the majority of the

25

court's view which is that it continues to be pending

were granted.

In California, that --

QUESTION:

Retroactively.

I mean, there's a

6

split.

There are real problems and -- and those problems,

7

as well as the problems with the California system, seem

8

to me good reason to read the statute the way it's written

9

so that there has to be an application pending, not -- not

10

a case pending, but an application.

11

be the application of either the petitioner or the

12

government if it lost, but the only time counted is the --

13

is the time during the pending application.

14

would not have to worry about these problems.

15

16

Does it automatically toll retroactively for the -- for

the period after the due date and so forth?

On appeal, it could

Your Honor -None of those problems exist if you

-- if you say it's pending when it's pending.
MR. OGDEN:

I think those problems are more

22

complicated in a system like California's or North

23

Carolina's which is an appellate system that involves an

24

unreasonable delay standard than they are in a -- in a

25

system that has clear time lines.

I -- I believe there are about three

And what is -- what is your

submission as to how we ought to interpret the rule in

that instance?

16

MR. OGDEN:

My submission would be that until

17

the California Supreme Court indicates how long the time

18

period is that -- that he would have had to file, the best

19

thing to do is to look to evidence of other cases that

20

have been decided by California to determine what is an

21

acceptable gap in the process.

22

And that's why in this case the evidence is

23

absolutely overwhelming that the 4-and-a-half-month period

24

that the State relies on simply wasn't the basis for the

25

California Supreme Court's decision.

How is that?

It seems to me the

record is a blank on that, and with all this talk, if you

don't count those 4-and-a-half months, he's timely no --

no matter whether it's discrete applications.

established in the record whether he did or he didn't.

He says, I never got that notice.

7

MR. OGDEN:

So, what do

And it's not

Well, the only evidence in the

8

record is that he did not.

9

to that effect in the California Supreme Court in his

10

He submitted a sworn statement

petition.
But as the Ninth Circuit said, there are two

11
12

possible bases for the lack of diligence finding in the

13

record.

14

The other is this 4-and-a-half-month period in which he

15

says and swears that he did not receive notice.

16

One is 5 years before he filed his initial claim.

The -- when you look at the record of the minute

17

orders that have been entered by California on the very

18

day and in the very weeks -- the California Supreme Court

19

-- around when Mr. Saffold's case was dismissed, you see

20

that cases -- for example, the Davis case.

21

18-month gap between the decision in the court of appeal

22

and the petition in the California Supreme Court, and the

23

California Supreme Court simply denied it, which under the

24

Ylst standard, looking through, goes back to the merits

determination before.

There was an

And the Saenz case is another.

11

So, there are those four --

12

QUESTION:

Is -- is there any -- some

13

possibility that those perhaps inconsistent rulings coming

14

from the Supreme Court of California might be based on

15

what Mr. Cross referred to as the division of opinion

16

within that court as to whether they should give any sort

17

of an explanation?
MR. OGDEN:

18

Your Honor, I think anything is

19

possible because, as -- as somebody said, we're in a mind-

20

reading mode here, and so certainly that's possible.

21

I can't stand here and tell you it is impossible that they

22

simply acted in an -- in an irrational and inconsistent

23

fashion.

24
25

And

The fact is while Mr. Saffold submitted a -- an
explanation which, at least on the surface, has some

That's not the basis on which the

whether, you know, the 4-and-a-half or the other one.

13

a ruling on the merits would trump a clear finding by the

14

-- by the California Supreme Court that the petition to it

was untimely, I think that would be an -- an incorrect

interpretation of the statute.

17

I concede

To the extent that the Ninth Circuit held that a --

QUESTION:

That's my view.

What would you say to the possibility

18

that we might certify the question to the California

19

Supreme Court whether this case was dismissed because it

20

was untimely?

21

MR. OGDEN:

The critical question would be

22

whether the case was dismissed based on the gap between

23

the court of appeal and the supreme court as opposed to

24

the -- the portion that preceded the original filing in

25

the -- in the trial court which obviously could not make

But I believe that certification would not fit

QUESTION:

this AEDPA statute applied it in the way Justice Scalia

suggests that we look at pending and place all the

emphasis there and exclude all time after a decision by a

10

State court until the next filing?
MR. OGDEN:

11

11 courts of appeals have considered

12

that issue to this point, Your Honor, and all 11 have

13

adopted the view that the entire period of time should be

MR. OGDEN:

question for him because his -- his gap theory taken to

I would submit there is no way that Congress

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STANLEY A. CROSS

12

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. CROSS:

13

I think the answer to Mr. Ogden,

14

Your Honor, is that the reason would be that Congress was

15

concerned about undue delay.

16

AEDPA was passed, over 80 bills were attempted to -- to

17

deal with this problem.

18

petitioners was the main concern of Congress, and they

19

dealt with that by writing into the statute the following

20

phrase.

21

the time during which a properly filed application for

22

State post-conviction or other collateral review with

23
