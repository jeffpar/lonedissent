CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Mr. Robbins.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE S. ROBBINS

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8
9

MR. ROBBINS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

10

The Eighth Circuit held in this case that a

11

private plaintiff may obtain punitive damages in an action

12

brought against municipal government defendants under

13

section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and title II

14

of the Americans with Disabilities Act.

15

Although the court of appeals identified

16

substantial evidence in the legislative record that

17

Congress never intended this result, it thought that this

18

Court's decision in Franklin against Gwinnett County

19

Public Schools left it little or no choice in the matter.

20

As the Eighth Circuit read Franklin, once a cause of

21

action has been created or inferred, it presumptively

22

carries with it all common law remedies, including

23

punitive damages, unless Congress has specifically said

24

otherwise.

25

QUESTION:

Mr. Robbins, did any -- did the
3

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

petitioners raise the Newport case at any time below?

2

MR. ROBBINS:

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. ROBBINS:

5

QUESTION:

No.

Why not?
The -- the party --

I mean, it looks like the most

6

obvious source of law on this topic.

7

here?

8
9

MR. ROBBINS:

What's going on

In the lower court, my client took

the position that it was, in fact, an arm of the State,

10

not an arm of the municipal government.

11

factors -- it cited various factors that in its view

12

warranted an Eleventh Amendment immunity, not a City of

13

Newport immunity.

14

being reviewed before this Court today, rejected that

15

argument.

16

that decision.

17

For various

The court of appeals, in the decision

We have not separately sought certiorari on

But I -- I do want to add on that point, Justice

18

O'Connor, that in our view it would be a mistake to take

19

respondent's suggestion that because my client took that

20

position in the lower court, that this Court should

21

therefore turn a blind eye to the City of Newport

22

doctrine.

23

situation in which a litigant, for example, decided to

24

argue only legislative history in the lower court and then

25

before this Court -- and then someone said, well, you're

It seems to us that it's quite analogous to a

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

therefore constrained not to look at the words of the

2

statute.

3
4

That seems -QUESTION:

It doesn't change the issue, I take

it.

5

MR. ROBBINS:

It does not change the issue.

The

6

position the client took below was always that punitive

7

damages are unwarranted for a variety of reasons,

8

including a reason that we are now urging by virtue of the

9

client having lost the Eleventh Amendment immunity issue

10

below.

11

QUESTION:

Was there a reason?

12

QUESTION:

And I suppose it's not like an

13

immunity from suit that can be waived.

14

term immunity, but it's not that sort of immunity.

15

MR. ROBBINS:

Exactly.

It's -- we use the

It -- it is exactly the

16

sense in which it was used in City of Newport as a

17

background principle of law that Congress is assumed to

18

have taken into consideration in enacting the actual test.

19

And we --

20

QUESTION:

Doesn't the Eighth Circuit allow you

21

to argue in the alternative?

22

said we have Eleventh Amendment immunity and -- and if we

23

don't, we're a municipality, and therefore Newport

24

applies.

25

I mean, you couldn't have

You could have done that, I suppose.
MR. ROBBINS:

I -- I think counsel could have
5

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

taken that measure.

2

it -- that that amounts to a waiver.

3

QUESTION:

They didn't, but I don't think that

What are we supposed to do then?

4

Because it seems to me that you're arguing there are two

5

possibilities.

6

damages no matter who he sues, and the second is that,

7

anyway, a person who sues a municipality can't get

8

punitive damages.

9

stronger than the first.

One possibility is no one gets punitive

Your second argument may be a lot
So, am I supposed to go to the

10

second argument that nobody has argued in the courts below

11

at all, bypassing them, or am I supposed to go to the

12

first argument which has enormous implications well beyond

13

this case?

14

MR. ROBBINS:

Well, I think the answer, Justice

15

Breyer, is that we have urged both arguments.

16

-- we could prevail on the basis of either presumption.

17

I think we

I -- I would, however, tell you why I think the

18

Court ought to address the broader issue and that is

19

because, given the construction of Franklin that the

20

Eighth Circuit took in this case, there is no good reason

21

to believe that were City of Newport called to their

22

attention, they would have come out any differently.

23

Eighth Circuit took Franklin to say that unless -- given

24

that there's a cause of action, whether explicit --

25

whether express or implied, that must necessarily carry

The

1

with it all common law remedies unless Congress has said

2

otherwise, which it rarely does --

3

QUESTION:

Well, the Eighth Circuit said

4

appropriate remedies.

5

appropriate means in this context?

6
7

So, don't we have to look at what

MR. ROBBINS:

Well, I think that -- that's the

language from Franklin.

8

QUESTION:

Yes.

9

MR. ROBBINS:

And we think Franklin is properly

10

confined to compensatory remedies for the reasons we've

11

said in the brief.

12

appropriate, however, Your Honor, was that it is

13

synonymous with whatever the common law has traditionally

14

made available by virtue of State law, by virtue of

15

Federal law, by virtue of the entire corpus of law.

16

whatever you can find on the books is, therefore,

17

appropriate within the meaning of Franklin, as the Eighth

18

Circuit saw it, and that, Justice Breyer, to return to

19

your question, is a doctrine of enormous capacity.

20

The Eighth Circuit's view of

QUESTION:

And

Mr. Robbins, I don't understand why

21

you say if this Court says Newport or Fact Concepts,

22

whatever you want to call it -- it says, a municipality is

23

immune.

24

Court -- this Court were to say, Eighth Circuit, you

25

overlooked the fact that municipalities are immune and

Period.

That takes care of your case, and if the

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

therefore in -- in this case you are wrong, and we

2

reverse, now, that takes care of your client.

3

MR. ROBBINS:

4

QUESTION:

Right?

Well, I -- I think it does.

And why should we in your case, where

5

there is a clear ground, not decide it on that basis?

6

should we go to the next case that doesn't involve a

7

municipality?

8
9

If --

MR. ROBBINS:

Why

Let me say two things with respect

to that, Justice Ginsburg.

First of all, the last thing I

10

want to do is talk the Court out of ruling for my client

11

on any ground.

12

(Laughter.)

13

MR. ROBBINS:

So, if the Court believes City of

14

Newport is sufficient -- and we think it's quite powerful

15

-- we'll certainly be glad of that result.

16

two more things about it.

17

But let me say

The first is even City of Newport requires

18

looking to the next step and asking, okay, that's the

19

presumption.

20

specific evidence in the statute that overcomes it?

21

all the reasons we've said in the brief and I'd be glad to

22

turn to, the evidence in this statute is quite

23

extraordinarily compelling that, to the contrary, punitive

24

damages were foreclosed.

25

It's a strong presumption.

Is there
For

Second, I -- I wish I could be as confident as
8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the Court's -- as Your Honor's question suggests, that

2

were this case to return to the Eighth Circuit with

3

nothing but a ruling about City of Newport, you know, in

4

its sails, that the Eighth Circuit would take that mandate

5

and take it and -- and come out differently.

6

quite so confident about that because of the sweep of how

7

they read Franklin.

8

QUESTION:

If the Court --

9

QUESTION:

We would -- the -- the broader

I'm not

10

position would be -- would be taking the case on the same

11

basis that the Eighth Circuit decided it.

12

broader ground.

13

MR. ROBBINS:

14

QUESTION:

Right?

On the

I think that's correct.

And there -- this is not a

15

constitutional matter.

16

MR. ROBBINS:

17

QUESTION:

No.

So, the doctrine of -- of observing

18

the narrowest possible constitutional ground does not

19

apply here.

20

Right?

MR. ROBBINS:

No.

Quite -- quite the contrary.

21

The question presented is what do these statutes mean

22

after all.

23

QUESTION:

So, this would be an opportunity to

24

-- to do what the Court is supposed to do, and that is

25

clean up confusion below on the meaning of a statute, and
9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the broader confusion is certainly much -- much more worth

2

clearing up than the narrower confusion.

3

MR. ROBBINS:

Right, and I might say one of the

4

matters we've pointed to in the petition for certiorari

5

is, in fact, that this misconstruction of Franklin is not

6

confined to this case, to this statute, and certainly to

7

the Eighth Circuit.

8

reading of what this Court said -- not just meant, but

9

said -- in Franklin itself.

10

It is a wide-ranging, I think, over-

And perhaps I might just turn

briefly to that initial question.

11

It seems to us, for several reasons, the Eighth

12

Circuit has badly misunderstood what Franklin says.

It

13

doesn't cover punitive damages.

14

matter.

15

the plaintiff in Franklin, but more to the point, the

16

premise of Franklin against Gwinnett County was drawn from

17

Bell against Hood and the cases that underlie Bell against

18

Hood, and that is an explicitory, compensatory rationale.

19

The idea in Bell was that courts have an authority --

That's the short of the

Punitive damages were, after all, not sought by

20

QUESTION:

Explicitory?

21

(Laughter.)

22

MR. ROBBINS:

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. ROBBINS:

25

(Laughter.)

I'm sorry?

Did you say explicitory?
Good heavens, I hope not.

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

I like it though.

2

(Laughter.)

3

MR. ROBBINS:

It's good.

Well, what -- what I certainly

4

meant to say is that Bell and Hood stem from a line of

5

authority that says that courts have the authority, the

6

inherent authority I -- I had meant to say, when -- when

7

charged with the construction of a statute to make good

8

the wrong done.

9

a compensatory rationale as you could have.

10

And that is about as clear a statement of

Franklin did not suggest that a plaintiff who

11

has been made whole, as Mr. Gorman was to the tune of $1

12

million in compensatory damages, including $150,000 in

13

pain and suffering, has a right inferable through a

14

statute that speaks not a word to the matter, to an

15

additional presumption of punishment.

16

QUESTION:

Well, did the compensatory damages in

17

this case include damages for humiliation, or am I wrong

18

about that?

19
20
21

MR. ROBBINS:

I -- I do not -- I have not seen

an indication that it included that.
QUESTION:

I --

In -- in this -- is the jury

22

instructed in this jurisdiction that compensatory damages

23

include damages?

24

that also humiliation?

25

as part of the compensatory award.

Of course, pain and suffering, but is
I thought humiliation was covered

MR. ROBBINS:

I -- we have included the

2

instruction, Justice Kennedy, at page 72 of the joint

3

appendix, and I do not find a specific reference to that.

I'd be glad to see if I can --

Well, I guess it -- it goes to the

be made, well, in order to make the person whole, you must

9

give punitive damages because it includes damages for

Assume a jurisdiction where humiliation

humiliation?
MR. ROBBINS:

Well, I guess I'd be inclined to

12

-- to think about that in a case in which somebody had

13

argued that below or here.

QUESTION:

But it wouldn't achieve that.

15

MR. ROBBINS:

QUESTION:

But -- but --

It wouldn't achieve that.

Would it,

you think he deserves punishment.

and therefore give this fellow as -- as much humiliation

believe this is the law in many jurisdictions -- that

2

person suffers, et cetera.

3

MR. ROBBINS:

Right.

I -- I don't want to

quarrel with the hypothetical, Justice Kennedy.

It may

5

very well be that pain and suffering already embraces that

concept.

in the jurisdictions to which Your Honor adverts, punitive

damages are used to supplement a compensatory regime that

MR. ROBBINS:

Well, as to which Congress has

spoken.

It has adopted title VI remedies that are quite

robust, which come with title VI regulations that are

enormously detailed, freighted with due -- levels of due

to layer punitive damages on a regime like this.

like some of those doctrines.

not.

7

It would work an extraordinary anomaly

But the fact is this is a statute, and Congress

8

spoke rather clearly to what it -- it wanted the statute

9

to accomplish.

And some of the things it expressly said

cannot live with the things that respondent proposes to

11

import into it.

12

And let me just say one other thing, and I

13

noticed that my white light on, as -- I do want to reserve

14

some time for rebuttal.

15

This is also a Spending Clause statute, and I

16

know this gets back to a -- a threshold issue that both

17

Your Honor and Justice Ginsburg suggested perhaps the

18

Court could pretermit.

19

given that the task is to construe the statute, to ignore

20

the fact that it was enacted pursuant to a contractual

21

regime in which punitive damages historically and for a

22

variety of sensible reasons are especially inappropriate.

23
24
25

I think it would be a mistake,

And if there are no questions, I -- I would like
to reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal.

Mr. Garre, we'll hear from you.

2

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE

3

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

4

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

5

MR. GARRE:

The statutes at issue in this case,

6

section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and title II of the

7

ADA, do not sanction the award of punitive damages which

8

are, by their definition, damages in excess of that

9

necessary to make good any wrong done.

10

Now, there are several -- both section 504 and

11

title II derive their remedies expressly from title VI of

12

the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which operates as a

13

condition on the receipt of Federal financial assistance.

14

And it seems to me that -- to us that there are several

15

facets of the title VI statutory scheme which make it

16

particularly inappropriate to infer a punitive damages

17

remedy.

18

The first is, is that title VI, although it's

19

silent with respect to a compensatory remedy, expressly

20

provides for punitive and regulatory measures in the event

21

that the violation of its nondiscrimination provision.

22

particular, the statute provides for a termination of

23

Federal funding, which this Court has itself recognized is

24

a very severe -- severe remedy that can have a powerful

25

deterrent effect.
16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

In

1

In addition, the statute authorizes

2

administrative enforcement actions, actions that -- in

3

which the regulatory agencies, who have responsibility for

4

enforcing section 504 and title II, can take remedial

5

action, order remedial action, short of funding

6

termination.

7

Now, the second aspect of title VI and title VI

8

statutory scheme it seems to us to be quite pertinent is

9

that punitive damages are themselves antithetical to

10

Spending Clause legislation like title VI because the

11

availability of unbounded punitive damages awards can

12

actually have the effect of diverting resources from

13

achieving the important objectives of the underlying

14

spending programs.

15

QUESTION:

Tell me.

I just can't recall.

Have

16

we held that punitive damages are available on the Bivens

17

action?

18

MR. GARRE:

We think the Court addressed that in

19

passing in the Carlson v. Green case, and we think that

20

that -- the discussion of punitive damages in that case is

21

properly regarded as -- as dictum in that case.

22

but --

23

QUESTION:

But --

So, do -- do I infer from your --

24

from your response that it is the position of the

25

Department that punitive damages should not be awarded in

Bivens cases?

MR. GARRE:

Yes, but there are two distinctions

between Bivens and this case.

First, in the Bivens context, there aren't

5

statutory penal and regulatory measures that can be used

6

like funding termination or administrative enforcement

7

actions to take deterrence measures when -- when needed to

8

deter violations.

9

And second, in the Bivens context, this Court is

10

giving effect to a constitutional tort that it alone has

11

recognized.

12

purporting to ascertain Congress's intent in enacting

13

section 504 in title II.

14
15

In -- in this context, the Court is

QUESTION:

What about 1983?

This Court has said

that punitive damages are available.

16

MR. GARRE:

That -- that's correct, Justice

17

Ginsburg.

And -- and first of all, if I can make two

18

points -- first, in that context, again, there is no

19

express statutory penal or regulatory measures that

20

Congress created to provide deterrence as it did under

21

title VI, the remedies at issue in this case.

22

And secondly, what's important, we think, about

23

the Smith case, in which this Court recognized a punitive

24

damages remedy under section 1983 -- is that in that case,

25

the Court didn't start with the presumption that punitive
18
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

damages were available and simply look to see if Congress

2

had said otherwise.

3

court of appeals applied in this case.

And that's the presumption that the

4

Instead, the Court purported to engage in an

5

inquiry of Congress's intent and -- and focused on the

6

fact that when -- when Congress enacted section 1983, it

7

made very clear that it was adopting a special species of

8

tort liability looking to the -- the State common law at

9

the time which provided for punitive damages there.

So,

10

we think that the section 1983 case is quite different

11

than this case.

12

The Court --

QUESTION:

But you -- and you rely on the heavy

13

gun in statutes like title VI, title IX.

14

is so heavy that it's never used.

15

that we will hear tomorrow, the statement was made, well,

16

yes, it would be a drastic sanction to withdraw Federal

17

funds, but in 30 years it hasn't happened.

18

MR. GARRE:

That heavy gun

I mean, in the case

Well, first of all, it does happen.

19

It happened in the Grove City case that came here, and I

20

could point Your Honor to additional examples in which the

21

termination funding mechanism has been used.

22

sure, it -- it's an unusual remedy and it's a harsh

23

remedy, and simply because it's not used in more cases

24

doesn't mean that it doesn't have a deterrent effect.

25

QUESTION:

Now, to be

Under the Rehabilitation Act, it has
19

1

been used under 504?

2

MR. GARRE:

Yes.

I could point you to -- to one

3

case.

It's -- it's not a case cited in the brief.

4

court of appeals case, Freeman v. Cavassos, 939 F.2d.

5

1527, which is one example.

6

It's a

But -- but again, the -- the Federal Government

7

-- Congress gave the Federal Government and the Federal

8

agencies authority to enforce these provisions short of

9

funding termination.

The -- the agencies receive

10

thousands of complaints each year under title II and

11

section 504.

12

commeasurate with the seriousness of the allegations

13

raised in those complaints, and they are successful in

14

negotiating compliance agreements, ranging from informal

15

agreements to formal settlement agreements, in which those

16

alleged to -- to have engaged in discrimination agree to

17

take corrective measures to eliminate discrimination and,

18

in some cases, to pay monetary sums.

19

And they investigate those complaints

Now, the -- the Federal agencies have entered

20

into more 300 of those agreements under title II alone in

21

the past 8 years.

22

in place.

23

Congress, and we think that that process itself counsels

24

heavily against judicial inference of punitive damages.

25

So, there is an administrative process

It's statutory -- statutorily created by

that the Federal courts have the authority to provide a

for this Court to extend the Franklin principle to

It would be a quantum leap

Thank you, Mr. Garre.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT L. NELSON
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. NELSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case presents the issue of whether Congress

24

foreclosed awards of punitive damages when it enacted the

25

rights of action to enforce section 504 of the
21
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Rehabilitation Act and title II of the ADA which together

2

prohibit discrimination against people with disabilities

3

in the provision of public services.

4

The text, structure, policies, and legislative

5

history of the ADA disclose no prohibition on the award of

6

punitive damages.

7

Absent such a prohibition --

QUESTION:

Well, if -- now that the Eleventh

8

Amendment immunity issue is gone, don't we have to deal

9

with City of Newport?

10

MR. NELSON:

Well, I think the answer to that,

11

Justice O'Connor, is no.

12

preserve the ability to argue for immunity on City of

13

Newport, they were free to do so in the lower courts.

14

QUESTION:

Had the defendants wished to

Well, do you say that we are

15

precluded from considering that authority as we resolve

16

this case?

17

MR. NELSON:

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. NELSON:

20

QUESTION:

25

-- you're precluded from it.

It's

No.

So, are you going to deal with

it then?

23
24

No.

-- it's a --

21
22

No, I don't say --

MR. NELSON:

Yes.

I -- I do intend to deal with

that.
I'd like to start by dealing with -- with the
22
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

issue of whether there's a punitive damages remedy at all

2

because I think then the Newport issue really is secondary

3

to that.

4

And the starting point with respect to the

5

availability of punitive damages I think has to be this

6

Court's decision in Franklin.

7

instead of looking at -- at arguments about what underlies

8

Franklin, to look at what Franklin said.

9

general rule, therefore, is that absent clear direction to

And it's useful I think to,

Quote:

"the

10

the contrary by Congress, the Federal courts have the

11

power to award any appropriate relief in a cognizable

12

cause of action brought pursuant to a Federal statute."

13
14

QUESTION:

Franklin wasn't dealing with punitive

damages, was it?

15

MR. NELSON:

That's right, Mr. Chief Justice.

16

Punitive damage was -- was not the form of relief that was

17

being addressed in Franklin.

18

QUESTION:

And appropriate relief does not sound

19

to me to be consistent with your beginning premise which

20

was that unless Congress forecloses the remedy, we must

21

give it.

22

MR. NELSON:

Well, I certainly don't mean to say

23

that -- that in any particular case, the Court must give

24

it unless Congress forecloses it, but if Congress has not

25

foreclosed it, it's potentially available if, in view of
23
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the policies of -- of the particular statute, it's an

2

appropriate remedy and in view of the conduct that's being

3

addressed.

4

punitive damages are an appropriate remedy where there's

5

willful -- a willful violation or reckless disregard of --

6

of the legal entitlements of the plaintiff.

7

Specifically, under this Court's decisions,

QUESTION:

Well, what do you make of the -- the

8

argument that the whole touchstone for damages here is

9

504, which is essentially the -- the spending power -- the

10

-- the -- a statute resting on the spending power?

11

closest analogy to that is with contract, and you don't

12

get punitive damages from contract.

13

MR. NELSON:

The

Well, there -- there are two

14

answers to that.

15

simply 504, but also the ADA, which is not a Spending

16

Clause enactment at all.

17
18
19

The first is that the touchstone is not

QUESTION:

The second is that --

But that referred to 504 for -- for

-- in effect, for its remedial scheme.
MR. NELSON:

To the extent that -- that what it

20

-- what it says is that the remedies available, the

21

remedies being a private right of action -- and that does

22

not necessarily, however, import a limitation imposed on

23

that remedy from above by the Spending Clause that doesn't

24

inhere in the -- in the nature of the statute itself,

25

assuming that the Spending Clause does impose that
24
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

limitation, which I don't concede, and I'll get to in a

2

moment.

3

But this Court actually addressed a similar

4

situation in the Darrone case.

The issue there was the

5

remedies available under section 504 for a case of

6

employment discrimination, and 504 in turn incorporates

7

the remedies available under title VI.

8

there is no remedy available for employment discrimination

9

under title VI except with regard to a Federal program

Title VI said

10

where the funding is for employment purposes.

11

said that by incorporating the title VI remedies, section

12

504 did not incorporate that limitation on the remedial

13

scheme that had nothing to do with the policies underlying

14

section 504 which were to eliminate discrimination against

15

the handicapped more broadly.

16

This Court

Similarly, under the Americans with Disabilities

17

Act, the -- the purpose of that act is to extend even

18

further than 504 the prohibition on and the remedies for

19

discrimination against persons with disabilities.

20

import into that statutory scheme a limit on relief that

21

-- that would pull it back and -- and restrict it to

22

what's appropriate on a Spending Clause measure would be

23

inappropriate under, I think, the mode of analysis this

24

Court used in Darrone.

25

And to

But in any event, even if one looks only at
25
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

section 504, the Spending Clause analogy to contract

2

doesn't limit remedies available to contractual remedies.

3

This Court I think made clear, both in Franklin and then

4

more recently in Davis v. Monroe County, that although the

5

obligation that an entity may undertake under the Spending

6

Clause is contractual in the sense that it's voluntary and

7

it has to be clearly stated what the substantive

8

requirements you're subjecting yourself to when you accept

9

Federal funding are, that that does not carry with it the

10
11

notion that you're limited to a, quote, "contract" remedy.
In Davis, what the plaintiff sought in her

12

complaint was punitive and compensatory damages for

13

injuries that had been inflicted on her.

14

was not a party to any contract.

15

quintessentially a tort recovery, and this Court held in

16

Davis that as long as the requirement that the conduct was

17

intentional, it was a violation that was -- that -- that a

18

person in authority had knowledge of and had -- had

19

allowed the situation to go forward, that if those

20

conditions, which were Spending Clause conditions under

21

the Gebser decision -- if those conditions were met, you

22

could go forward and obtain the type of tort remedial

23

relief that the plaintiff was --

24
25

QUESTION:

She, of course,

What she was seeking was

Well, you say -- you say she wasn't a

party to the contract.

She -- she was a beneficiary of
26

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the contract, surely.

2

MR. NELSON:

I mean -Well, you could, I suppose,

3

analogize her to a third party beneficiary, but to suggest

4

that --

5

QUESTION:

6

tort actions.

7

as a tort action.

And contract actions were original

It's easy to characterize a contract action
Right?

8

MR. NELSON:

9

QUESTION:

10
11

It's just assumpsit.

Well, and in fact -I -- I'm not sure a whole lot hangs

on -MR. NELSON:

-- that -- that argument can go the

12

other way, too, because the States are broadly recognizing

13

that -- that malicious and bad faith breaches of contract

14

carry with them tort remedies.

15

But I'll give another example.

This Court in a

16

couple of decisions, Wright v. Roanoke Housing Authority,

17

and Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Association, held that

18

under Spending Clause enactments, obligations can be

19

imposed on the recipients of funds that are enforceable

20

that create enforceable rights under section 1983.

21

And this Court has repeatedly held, most

22

recently I think in City of Monterey v. Del Monte Dunes,

23

that 1983 is ever and always a tort remedy.

24
25

QUESTION:

Mr. -- Mr. Nelson, why don't we look

specifically at this context, which is the ADA, and the
27
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

anomaly that when Congress thought about punitive damages,

2

as we know it did in the employment part, it provided for

3

them with qualifications and with caps on amount.

4

would be passing strange, would it not, that when Congress

5

is explicit about punitive damages, it contains them, and

6

it when it says not one word one way or another, they are

7

unlimited because that's -- as I take your argument to be,

8

under part 3, there are the caps and the qualifications,

9

but under part 2, it's public service, no limitation.

10

MR. NELSON:

So, it

It's under title I that the caps

11

apply, Justice Ginsburg, and I think that what that

12

illustrates is not -- not the point that -- that Congress

13

didn't intend to provide these remedies.

14

at -- at the timing of the enactments and the background

15

of those changes to the -- in the Civil Rights Act of

16

1991.

17

You have to look

As the ADA was originally enacted, title I,

18

consonant with title VII, didn't provide a damages remedy

19

of any kind.

20

legal forms of relief.

21

following the -- the title VII model.

22

It didn't provide an entitlement to any
It was limited to equitable relief

No such limitation has ever been placed on title

23

II.

In title II, Congress simply incorporated by

24

reference an action for legal remedies that this Court had

25

already recognized to exist.
28
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Now, then in 1991, Congress expanded the relief

2

under title I of the ADA, as well as under title VII of

3

the Civil Rights Act for the first time ever to allow a

4

damages remedy, either compensatory or punitive, for

5

employment discrimination to which those statutes applied.

6

And what that illustrates is simply the history

7

that Congress has been very wary about providing broad

8

damages remedies in the employment discrimination area and

9

in 1981, it relaxed that unwillingness to some degree, but

10

then placed a cap on it.

11

clear, from the original 1990 legislation, that Congress

12

didn't impose that circumscribed set of employment

13

discrimination remedies on title II.

14

title I, that doesn't either limit title II or imply that

15

title II was ever intended to be limited.

16
17
18

QUESTION:

But in title II, it's quite

So, by expanding

Am I right that title III says no

punitive damages?
MR. NELSON:

Title III says no punitive damages

19

at all as part of a -- of a remedial scheme that is

20

similarly circumscribed to -- to title I, although in

21

somewhat different ways, a remedial scheme that under

22

title III doesn't make a private right of action for

23

damages of any kind available to an individual plaintiff.

24

Under title III, it's only the Attorney General who can

25

ever sue for any damages, and then when Congress -- it -29
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

having made a -- a damages remedy available to the

2

Attorney General, it then went on to say, and under this

3

statute, damages doesn't include punitive damages.

4

I think to the extent that sheds any light on

5

title II at all, we know that in title II, Congress knew

6

that it was creating a damages remedy.

7

limit those damages, as it did in title III, when it

8

created that limited damages remedy through the Attorney

9

General, is, if anything, an indication that no limitation

10

That it didn't

was intended.

11

QUESTION:

Why?

Why?

Because -- why -- why

12

would somebody want to -- title II has to do with actions

13

against a government basically, doesn't it?

14

MR. NELSON:

15

QUESTION:

That's correct.
So -- so, I thought punitives are

16

primarily designed to compensate an individual who's not

17

going to be compensated.

18

very big club against the people who behaved badly.

19

MR. NELSON:

20

QUESTION:

It's just a way of wielding a

Well -Now, why would you want that big club

21

to be wielded against private people in limited amounts,

22

but when you get to a government which, after all,

23

represents the entire public, you say the sky is the

24

limit?

25

involved it's less reasonable to assess punitives than

Newport would suggest where the government is

30
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

where a private individual is.

2

MR. NELSON:

Well, I think the -- part of the

3

answer to that is the whole structure of the ADA remedial

4

scheme indicates an intention to make broader remedies

5

available against public entities than private entities to

6

begin with.

7

enacted, there were all these limits placed on title III,

8

no compensatory damages even, limits on title I against

9

private and public employers, not even any compensatory

That's why, when the ADA was originally

10

damages.

11

Congress made available a remedy there that is much more

12

extensive than it made against private employers or

13

private offerors of public accommodations.

14

Clearly, in title II, everyone agrees that

Now, why Congress did that I think is -- is

15

perhaps somewhat obscure, but it seems to relate back to

16

the entire history, starting with the 1964 Civil Rights

17

Act, where Congress was very hesitant about imposing broad

18

remedies against private actors, possibly in part due to

19

the -- the effectiveness of their lobbyists, which --

20

which may have been greater in this instance than those of

21

-- of public employers and entities.

22

But for whatever reason Congress did it, it's

23

clear that Congress did enact broader remedies under title

24

II than under those titles that are applicable to --

25

QUESTION:

But that's an anomaly too because in
31

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

title -- title III, which is the -- the title that imposes

2

-- title I is the one -- employment.

3

MR. NELSON:

4

QUESTION:

5

Right?

Correct.
And are government employers liable

for punitive damages under title I?

6

MR. NELSON:

7

QUESTION:

No, they are not.
So, your -- your notion that -- that

8

the government is not well representative in the

9

legislature -- here is a title that says, private sector,

10

you're going to be stuck.

11

punitive damages, but not government entities.

12

MR. NELSON:

You're going to be subject to

Well, that -- that was -- that was

13

what happened in the 1991 round.

14

Congress there obviously did made -- make a considered

15

choice not to impose those remedies on -- on public

16

actors.

17

Presumably the -- the

But I think, you know, to step back even

18

further, one has to look at the fact that both section

19

504, by virtue of the 1986 Rehabilitation Act amendments,

20

and the ADA, by virtue of -- of section 502, are subject

21

as a general rule to the principle that -- that Congress

22

very deliberately said public entities, and in particular

23

States, are going to be subject to the full range of

24

remedies that are available against private defendants.

25

Congress did that explicitly in both those -- both those
32
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

statutes.

2

And I think what that indicates is that there

3

has been a considered judgment in these statutes that,

4

especially in the area of the provision of public

5

services, Congress wants broad remedies to be made

6

available against the public entities that are subject to

7

it.

8

1991 when it extended the -- the remedies for employment

9

discrimination.

It's true that Congress made a different judgment in

But except for that provision of the

10

statute where public employers were given a special

11

exemption, the rest of the statute evinces an -- an

12

intention by Congress that public entities not get special

13

exemptions.

14
15
16

QUESTION:

But doesn't that seem rather

perverse?
MR. NELSON:

Well, I think it -- it seems -- it

17

seems to me that -- that one can look at it either way.

18

It's perverse if you're a public entity; it's not perverse

19

if you're a business entity that feels like anti-

20

discrimination laws trench on the -- the freedom of

21

businesses to operate in the way they want to operate.

22

I think what Congress has done with respect to

23

discrimination against persons with disabilities, first in

24

making the 504 remedies available against recipients of

25

Federal funds, and then in making the title II remedies
33
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

available against public entities, is -- is Congress has

2

made a judgment that says, we think discrimination against

3

persons with disabilities is particularly objectionable

4

when engaged in by the government, just as in the

5

fourth --

6

QUESTION:

But -- but your -- your Newport case

7

certainly suggests that traditionally public entities are

8

treated differently than private entities for the same

9

conduct if you're talking about punitive damages.

10

MR. NELSON:

That's certainly true.

And -- and

11

what I think is distinctive about Newport, to begin with,

12

here I do believe that -- that if the Court were to

13

considered that under these statutes there is a punitive

14

damages remedy available generally, and then the question

15

is should these particular defendants be freed from it

16

under a City of Newport rationale, that -- that it's fair

17

for this Court to hold the -- the defendant to the rule

18

that it generally applies, which is that if you want to

About the issue, are you -- are you

24

suggesting that it is not included in the question

MR. NELSON:

2

QUESTION:

No, I'm not making that argument.
Then -- then did you in your brief in

3

opposition point out that this was not properly raised in

4

the lower courts?

5
6

MR. NELSON:

Yes, that was pointed out in the

brief in opposition.

7

QUESTION:

I want to be sure you -- suppose that

8

we did look at the Newport issue.

9

should, but suppose we did.

I'm not saying that we

And suppose that you lost on

10

your point that it should be waived or deemed waived.

11

What would your -- is there any response to their claim on

12

the merits that -- that Newport makes clear that they are

13

not liable in punitive damages?

14

MR. NELSON:

Yes.

I think -- I think that --

15

that the first response is that through the Rehabilitation

16

Act amendments of 1986, which are codified at 42 U.S.C.,

17

section 2000(d)(7), and also in section 502 of the ADA,

18

which is codified at 42 U.S.C., section 12202, those

19

provisions are fundamentally incompatible with the notion

20

of Newport immunity.

21

And I want to just start by expressing my

22

understanding of what Newport immunity is in light of this

23

Court's decision in -- in the Vermont Natural Resources

24

case.

25

immunity.

It's not specifically an immunity that is municipal
It's an immunity or a -- or a general

1

presumption against awards of punitive damages against

2

State and local governments as a class.

3

it says where it operates is that those defendants as a

4

class have an exemption against a particular form of

5

relief that is otherwise available against private actors.

6

And -- and what

In the Rehabilitation Act amendments and in

7

section 502 of the ADA, what Congress said expressly is

8

that as to remedies against States, which are one of the

9

entities entitled to the Newport presumption, they're

10

subject to the same remedies under the statutes as are any

11

other private or public entities, meaning if you can get

12

it against a private entity, you can get it against a

13

State.

14

Newport, which is that governmental entities as a class

15

are entitled to a special exemption.

16

say is that governmental entities as a class are entitled

17

to no special exemption.

18

think simply goes away.

And that takes away the fundamental premise of

What these statutes

And the City of Newport issue I

19

I'd also suggest that one of the fundamental

20

premises of City of Newport is not present under these

21

statutes, and that is that there's an adequate alternative

22

deterrent.

23

about when we're talking about punitive damages as a

24

deterrent, to answer Justice Kennedy's question earlier of

25

Mr. Robbins, in this case the compensatory damages award

And -- and in this case, what we're talking

36
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

did include pain, suffering, humiliation, and mental

2

damages.

3

here as a surrogate for some component of compensatories.

4

We're talking about it as a remedy designed to provide a

5

deterrent that will assist in -- in Congress's goal of

6

eliminating discrimination against persons with

7

disabilities.

8
9

So, we're not talking about punitive damages

And in -- in Newport, this Court looked at the
1983 remedy and said, yes, punitive damages are an

10

important element of deterrence with respect to civil

11

rights violations that are subject to section 1983.

12

we have a better deterrent which is the availability of

13

punitive damages against individual defendants who

14

actually make the decisions to carry out the -- the

15

wrongful acts that 1983 is responding to.

16

that judgment is -- as to which is more effective, is

17

correct or not, that's the line the Court drew in Newport.

18

But

Now, whether

But under these statutes, that remedy is not

19

available because section 504 and title II of the ADA make

20

quite clear that they provide remedies only against the

21

entities.

22

individual under title II of the ADA or under section 504

23

of the Rehabilitation Act.

24

statutes, deterrence against the entity is all you've got

25

and all you can rely on.

There's no right of action against a -- an

So, with respect to these

37
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

And that's yet another reason why Newport's

2

policies are inapplicable here.

And Newport was very

3

clear that beyond looking at the immunity, as -- as it

4

used the term, of municipalities as a -- as a sort of

5

standard to try to determine what the legislature was

6

thinking about when it enacted the statute, the Court was

7

also going to look at the policies of the particular

8

statutes to determine whether or not immunity from

9

punitive damages accorded with those policies.

And given

10

the distinctions between the ADA and section 504, those

11

policies are not served here by immunizing the -- the

12

defendants against punitive damages on -- under a Newport

13

rationale.

14

I'd also like to get back for a moment, if I

15

could, to the -- the notion that what's going on in

16

Franklin is limited to compensatory remedies and that --

17

that the idea of -- of punitive damages as one of the

18

normal modes of relief offered by the Federal courts is

19

not really what the Court was talking about in Franklin.

20

I think that's inconsistent not only with Bivens where in

21

Carlson v. Green this Court, I think, held that punitive

22

damages are available in Bivens actions because, as one of

23

the ordinary remedial mechanisms available to the Federal

24

courts, they were particularly appropriate for the redress

25

of constitutional violations.
38
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

The reason I say that that's a holding is the

2

issue in Carlson was not whether there was a -- a right of

3

action for any relief at all under the Eighth Amendment.

4

It was conceded that -- that the plaintiff could get

5

injunctive relief against an Eighth Amendment violation if

6

there was a pervasive --

7

QUESTION:

Mr. Nelson, last year in -- in the

8

Alexander case and this year in the Malesko case, we've

9

indicated that we're taking a much more critical look, I

10

think, at these kind of claims than we ever did in

11

Carlson.

12

MR. NELSON:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I don't

13

think that that's -- that that's quite right with respect

14

to -- with respect to the evolution of this Court's

15

doctrine.

16

particular in Sandoval, was that -- that the Court had

17

backed away from the notion that for every right, there

18

has to be a remedy and had gone to the -- the Court v. Ash

19

notion, that what we're looking for when we're trying to

20

determine whether a right of action exists is

21

congressional intent.

22

I think what the Court said, in -- in

But that was true at the time of -- of Franklin

23

as well and the Court in Franklin said that's a separate

24

question from what relief you get when it's conceded that

25

there is a right of action to begin with.
39
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

And similarly, in Malesko, this Court said,

2

we're not going to recognize a right of action against

3

this particular entity.

4

that Congress has made a right of action available, as it

5

is here, and what form of relief is appropriate, is a

6

different matter.

7

QUESTION:

The question, when it's clear

Well, but what -- what you're arguing

8

basically is that every one of these things is fixed in

9

time permanently not just as to its holding, but as -- as

10

to language in it.

11

that is not always necessarily so, that the Court may take

12

a slightly different view some -- now than it did 10 years

13

ago.

14

And what I'm trying to suggest is that

MR. NELSON:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I think

15

that's clearly -- that's clearly true.

16

that -- that we as -- as lawyers are trying to -- to deal

17

with is -- is how, in light of changes in precedent and --

18

and changes in evolution of the Court's doctrine over

19

time, what aspects can we pull out and -- and hold

20

constant or -- or use to make arguments as to what the

21

rule remains.

22

And the question

And to me, looking at Franklin, which was a case

23

that -- first of all, all nine Justices concurred in the

24

holding at the time.

25

this Court had already evolved far away from the every

Second, it came at a point where

40
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

right must have a remedy doctrine and was looking very

2

specifically at whether or not Congress had intended to

3

allow a right of action.

4

Court said and even the concurrence said was when it's

5

crystal clear that Congress said there's a right of action

6

here, does -- do we infer limits on our ability to provide

7

appropriate relief when Congress hasn't given us guidance

8

on that subject?

9

QUESTION:

But what the opinion for the

And didn't say anything about whether

10

punitives would be appropriate relief because all Franklin

11

involved was compensatory damages.

12

thought that there were no compensatory damages under

13

spending statutes.

14

appropriate relief.

15

under Franklin punitive damages would be appropriate.

16

Before that, it was

To clarify that, they used the phrase

MR. NELSON:

So, we've never had any holding that

That's correct, Justice Ginsburg.

17

On the other hand, the Court has certainly held that

18

punitive damages are appropriate in implied statutory

19

rights of action, the most notable being section 1981

20

which, unlike section 1983, is an implied right of action.

21

Section 1981 doesn't say anything about creating a right

22

for anybody to go in and get enforcement, and the Court

23

has held not only is there a right of action there, but

24

held as recently as the Pollard case, which I believe was

25

last year, that under 1981 the scope of relief includes
41
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

punitive damages.

2

I think that what that reflects is the Franklin

3

principle, that when there's a cause of action, when it's

4

a cause of action such as these, that is, essentially a

5

tort remedy, that the traditional range of relief that's

6

appropriate for such rights is provided.

7

of relief includes punitive damages.

8

And that range

And -- and again, the issue in this case is not

9

whether on the facts punitive damages are appropriate,

10

because that hasn't yet been decided, but whether ever

11

punitive damages are appropriate under this statute.

12

I think Franklin speaks to the question not in its express

13

holding but its rationale which -- which I believe has

14

survived down to the present.

15
16

And

Unless there are any further questions, I will
leave it at that.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE S. ROBBINS

20

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

21

MR. ROBBINS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

22

Let me turn -- go back for just a moment to the

23

1991 act because I think its -- its significance here is

24

terribly important and quite a bit different from

25

respondent's characterization.

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

It is, I think, completely implausible for reasons that I

think go beyond what -- what Mr. Nelson has described to

you.
The fact is title I was enacted in its original

12

form at the very same time that Congress was considering

13

the 1991 legislation.

14

they enacted in title I that there shall be the same

15

remedies as title VII -- everyone knew that at that very

16

moment laying before another committee in Congress was the

17

very legislation that is being characterized as the 1991

18

legislation, as if it happened much later.

19

simultaneously and everyone knew that punitive damages

20

were around the corner.

Mr. Nelson called the timing of the enactments, you really

have to read title I as if it enacted a punitive damages

Justice Ginsburg's question, it has a civil penalties

2

provision.

3

respondent's position and the position you would be urged

4

to adopt is that although title I of the ADA has a limited

5

punitive damages provision applicable only to employment

6

cases and exempting the government, and although title III

7

has a civil penalties provision applicable only to public

8

accommodations, title II, which is silent, shall have an

unlimited punitive damages provision which can be applied

And it is against

amendments go not one step in the direction of overturning

16

City of Newport.

17

only this, that the States shall be liable for whatever

18

remedies are applicable to other public entities or

19

private entities.

20

and in our view punitive damages aren't available against

21

anybody under title II.
