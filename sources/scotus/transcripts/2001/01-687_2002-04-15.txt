ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. DREEBEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case is typical of many Federal drug

12

prosecutions that were tried before this Court's decision

13

in Apprendi v. New Jersey.

14

superseding indictment that alleged a conspiracy to

15

distribute cocaine and cocaine base without alleging a

16

specific threshold quantity of drugs that were involved in

17

the offense.

18

Respondents were indicted on a

Respondents were convicted of that offense at

19

trial, and the evidence established at trial that the

20

offense involved well in excess of 50 grams of cocaine

21

base, the threshold quantity of drugs to authorize a

22

minimum sentence of 10 years and a maximum sentence of

23

life imprisonment.

24
25

At sentencing, as all parties expected, the
judge made findings of drug quantity and determined that

Page 3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the quantities of drugs involved in the offense justified

2

a sentencing range up to life imprisonment and imposed

3

sentences on several respondents of life imprisonment and

4

others of 30 years imprisonment.
Respondents made no objection to the judge's

5
6

procedure in determining drug quantity himself without a

7

jury trial determination on that issue or without an -QUESTION:

8
9

Well, at -- at sentencing, is it --

it -- it's really not that much of a burden to just send

10

it back to the judge and tell him to do it right.

11

he had sentenced under the wrong section or something like

12

that.

13

Suppose

We'd just send it back.
MR. DREEBEN:

The problem in this case, Justice

14

Kennedy, is that the court of appeals has held that the

15

omission of a drug quantity allegation from the indictment

16

is a jurisdictional error that always requires automatic

17

correction on plain error review regardless of the

18

strength of the evidence against respondents on the

19

question or on whether respondents had notice that they

20

would face an increased sentence as a result of enhanced

21

quantities of drug --

22

QUESTION:

Well, but -- but in order to test

23

that, I'm just asking -- it's not as if we have to have a

24

new trial.

25

new trial unless everybody stipulated to it.

In fact, I -- I doubt that you could have a

resources.

All that happens is there's a new
That -- that's not that big of a --

We don't have to have some huge trial.

MR. DREEBEN:

7

It's --

It's

What will happen if the -- this

8

Court affirms the judgment of the court of appeals is that

9

respondents will not be subject to the sentences that

10

Congress authorized and that the evidence unequivocally

11

showed in this case were justified.

12

QUESTION:

You're not objecting to --

13

QUESTION:

Aren't we really just arguing about

14

-- are we really just arguing about retroactivity then?
MR. DREEBEN:

15

In this case we're not arguing

16

about retroactivity.

What we're arguing about is plain

17

error.

18

in the district court to the procedure by which they were

19

sentenced.

20

to the proposition that their offenses involved 50 grams

21

of cocaine base or more, which is all that is required in

22

order to support a statutory increase in the sentence.

23

And notwithstanding their failure to object, the court of

24

appeals concluded that plain error analysis always

25

requires vacation of the enhanced sentence, and the

Respondents never made a constitutional objection

They never even objected as a factual matter

This case was tried before

Apprendi.
QUESTION:

17

If it had been tried after Apprendi

18

came down, there might, in fact, be a notice problem I

19

assume.

20

MR. DREEBEN:

Yes, absolutely, Justice O'Connor.

21

Post Apprendi, the Government understands that it's its

22

obligation to include an allegation of drug quantity in

23

the indictment.

24

was done in a regime in which all parties understood that

25

an allegation in the indictment of a conspiracy offense,

This case, which was tried pre Apprendi,

Page 6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

with no specification of drug quantity, did not limit the

2

Government to proving increased quantities of cocaine

3

base.
QUESTION:

4

Well, for your position to prevail

5

here, do we have to overrule Ex parte Bain or somehow set

6

that aside, which seems to suggest that if it's not in the

7

indictment, it's a jurisdictional problem?
MR. DREEBEN:

8
9

Well, Justice O'Connor, this Court

already has overruled Ex parte Bain on its square holding,

10

which is that the narrowing of an indictment is

11

impermissible and deprives the court of jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

12

But the -- the Government can surely

13

also argue that Ex parte Bain by its terms doesn't

14

apply --

15

MR. DREEBEN:

16

QUESTION:

Ex parte --

-- to this case because the

17

indictment and the verdict corresponded, and that was

18

different from Ex parte Bain.

19

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, that -- that is a difference

20

from Ex parte Bain, Chief Justice Rehnquist, but we don't

21

dispute that in this case, post Apprendi, there is an

22

error in the sense that drug quantity is treated as a

23

constitutional element.

24
25

QUESTION:

Yes.

There can be an error but not a

matter of -- not going to a matter of jurisdiction.

Page 7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. DREEBEN:

Correct.

And the fundamental flaw

2

in Ex parte Bain was to treat a constitutional error

3

arising under the Fifth Amendment's Indictment Clause as

4

if it were a jurisdictional error.

5

submission that the reason that the Court did that is

6

because at the time, in the 19th century, on habeas

7

corpus, relief was available only for jurisdictional

8

errors, which led this Court to treat a variety of

9

constitutional errors as though they were jurisdictional.

10
11
12

QUESTION:

And it's our

Well, and because there was no right

of direct appeal.
MR. DREEBEN:

Correct.

So, the -- the result

13

was that a -- the Court had broadly characterized a

14

variety of constitutional errors as if they were

15

jurisdictional errors, but later decisions of this Court

16

make clear that the failure of an indictment to charge any

17

offense is not a jurisdictional error.

18

QUESTION:

Mr. Dreeben, you would like us to

19

make that clear, wouldn't you, because it isn't in our

20

cases so far, that that kind of error, whatever it is,

21

doesn't qualify as, quote, jurisdictional?

22

MR. DREEBEN:

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

We think

23

that the time is -- is right in this case to make it clear

24

that that's not a jurisdictional error.

25

QUESTION:

There -- there are many instances

Page 8
Alderson Reporting Company

1

where the Court has said that an error is -- that -- that

2

a requirement, certain requirement, is mandatory and

3

jurisdictional.

4

different contexts.

5

to the -- what is jurisdictional so that there won't be

6

this string of things that the label jurisdictional is

7

appended to?

8
9

That word has been used in -- in many
And are you suggesting some approach

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, jurisdictional has been

appended as a label to a variety of kinds of errors, but

10

the relevant sense in which it's being invoked in this

11

case and in which the lower court understood it was a kind

12

of defect that may be raised at any time regardless of an

13

objection and that is tantamount to subject matter

14

jurisdiction, the sort of error that is so fundamental to

15

the proceedings that harmless error review and plain error

16

review simply don't apply.

17

Now, the court of appeals in this case did, as a

18

formal matter, apply rule 52(b) of the Federal Rules of

19

Criminal Procedure, the harmless error rule.

20

repeatedly stated that errors relating to the indictment

21

process are jurisdictional, and the failure of an

22

indictment to charge an offense violates a mandatory rule

23

and creates a jurisdictional error.

24

conclusion that this Court's precedents in Neder v. United

25

States and Johnson v. United States simply don't apply and

But it also

And that led to the

that the weight of the evidence against respondents in

this case and their possession of notice that they would

3

face increased sentences under the drug statute --

May I ask what you rely on for the

6

MR. DREEBEN:

7

QUESTION:

8

In -- in the factual record --

Are you relying on the general run of

cases or the fact there was a preceding indictment?
MR. DREEBEN:

9

In this case, Justice Stevens, we

10

rely most fundamentally on the fact that the state of the

11

law at the time of respondents' indictment was that all

12

defendants understood that notwithstanding the absence of

13

a --

14

QUESTION:

But you're not really relying on the

15

fact there had been a prior indictment that was withdrawn

16

and superseded.

17

MR. DREEBEN:

We don't have to rely on that.

I

18

think the prior indictment makes clear that the Government

19

believed that this conspiracy --

20

QUESTION:

It believed at the time they filed

21

the prior indictment, but when they withdraw it and file a

22

second indictment, you normally would think they've

23

withdrawn the charges that have been withdrawn.

24
25

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, not in view of the fact that

at the prevailing legal regime at the time --

QUESTION:

That's a separate point, and I

2

understand that point.

3

point even if there had been no original indictment.
MR. DREEBEN:

4

But it seems to me you'd make that

I would.

And I think it's

5

important to underscore that the superseding indictment

6

didn't give the defendants the impression that the

7

Government was retreating in the scope of its proof.

8

the contrary, the superseding indictment expanded the

9

conspirators from 9 to 14.

10

It expanded the length of the

conspiracy -QUESTION:

11
12

To

Yes, but it withdrew the quantity

allegation.
MR. DREEBEN:

13

It didn't withdraw all references

14

to quantity, Justice Stevens.

15

superseding indictment, it alleges that there were multi-

16

kilogram cocaine shipments and multi-kilogram -QUESTION:

17

If you look at the

Well, I thought we were taking the

18

case on the assumption that the indictment did not charge

19

enough to get the sentences that they received.

20

MR. DREEBEN:

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. DREEBEN:

And that's correct.

But what --

Whereas the earlier indictment did.
The earlier indictment in terms

23

said this offense involves more than 50 grams of cocaine

24

base.

25

do read the allegations in the later indictment, it's

The later indictment didn't say that.

But if you

Page 11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

impossible that anyone could come away thinking that the

2

Government had narrowed the scope of the conspiracy it

3

intended to prove.
And respondents didn't take it that way.

4

There

5

is information in the detention hearings of at least four

6

other respondents that indicates that they understood that

7

this was the kind of cocaine conspiracy -- cocaine base

8

conspiracy that, if proved, would expose them to a life

9

sentence.

10
11
12
13

They had a full opportunity to try to contest

that evidence if they wished to do so.
What the respondents did instead was attempt to
say we weren't part of this -QUESTION:

Let me just interrupt you by saying I

14

think it would be most unfortunate if we decided this case

15

on the particular fact that there was an original

16

indictment and a superseding indictment.

17

would mean nothing if that's all we have.

18

MR. DREEBEN:

This was case

Well, I don't think it would mean

19

nothing, Justice Stevens, but we are asking the Court to

20

rule on the broader ground that when an indictment fails

21

to allege what we now understand to be an element of the

22

offense, but the evidence is sufficiently powerful so that

23

any rational grand jury, if asked, would have found that.

24
25

QUESTION:

What does the -- what does the

Government's position do to the Stirone case?

Page 12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. DREEBEN:

Nothing, Chief Justice Rehnquist,

2

because Stirone was a case in which two features are

3

present that are not present here.

4

defendant in Stirone repeatedly objected to the broadening

5

of the indictment in that case.

alleged that there was an effect on interstate commerce

7

from an extortion as a result of obstruction of commerce

11

States, and that was the effect on commerce that had been

12

obstructed.

13

judge allowed that to go to the jury.

14

not like this case, a plain error case.

15

error case.

16

The defendants vociferously objected, but the
So, that case is
It is a harmless

And furthermore, the respondents -- or the --

17

the defendants in Stirone had a plausible claim that they

18

were deprived of notice of the kinds of charges that they

19

would actually face at trial; whereas in this case, there

20

is not a claim, a plausible claim, that the defendants did

21

not know that they would face an increased sentence if the

22

Government established that the crime involved more than

23

50 grams of cocaine base.

24
25

QUESTION:

Can you tell me, post Apprendi in the

trial courts, can the defendant agree with the Government

Page 13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

to plead guilty but leave it to the judge to determine the

2

amounts of the drug involved?
MR. DREEBEN:

3

It's a little unclear, Justice

4

Kennedy, whether the defendant can do that because

5

typically the Government has not acquiesced and the courts

6

have not been hospitable to partial pleas of guilty.

7

in effect, the defendant would be tendering a partial plea

8

to an aggravated drug offense and then asking the judge to

9

decide one element of the offense.

And

Under pre-Apprendi

10

law, that procedure would not be followed in any circuit.

11

Now, there have been some defendants who really

12

would be willing to plead to the underlying offense and

13

contest drug quantity, and I haven't had a chance to see

14

whether that has played out in the district courts with

15

any courts allowing that to happen.
QUESTION:

16

And what does the Government do when

17

2

quantity, then the Government would be entitled to a

3

lesser included offense.

4

QUESTION:

Lesser included offense.

5

MR. DREEBEN:

Correct.

And -- and the lower

6

courts have understood that that's the appropriate

7

analysis in a case like that.

8

QUESTION:

9

I guess part of the problem in this

case is that if we say that defendants are entitled to the

10

benefit of a change in the law before their conviction

11

becomes final, there's not much you can do because you'd

12

have to issue a superseding indictment and you can't do

13

that.
MR. DREEBEN:

14

We can't do it in this case,

15

Justice Kennedy, which is why, in effect, the result that

16

the court of appeals achieved is a tremendous windfall for

the defendants.

MR. DREEBEN:

That -- that -- I

4

place at trial when a defendant could have said the

5

Government has to prove this quantity up to the jury or it

6

could --

7

QUESTION:

No, but it -- it doesn't.

I mean,

8

the -- the point at which the -- the failure to indict and

allege on quantity becomes objectionable is at sentencing.

MR. DREEBEN:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, that's --

So, there would be no reason to.
That was just what I was about to

13

say, Justice Souter.

The -- the most pertinent time for

14

the defendant to object would be at sentencing, and there

15

are defendants who raise the kind of constitutional

16

objection that this Court alluded to in the Jones decision

17

in 1999 and later accepted in the Apprendi decision in the

18

year 2000.

benefit of harmless error review.

21

not raise that constitutional claim are subject to plain

strength of the evidence, does not automatically entitle

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the defendant to relief on plain error review.
In Johnson v. United States, this Court

2
3

considered a very analogous type of error.

There the

4

trial court convicted the defendant of a perjury offense

5

without sending materiality to the petty jury.

6

was no petty jury determination of materiality.

7

defendant made no objection to that, and on appeal, this

8

Court held that the appropriate standard is plain error

9

review because the defendant had never objected.

So, there
The

And when

10

the evidence is overwhelming and uncontestable -- and

11

uncontested at trial, the Court concluded that it is

12

affirmance that supports the integrity of the judicial

13

system rather than reversal.

14

QUESTION:

The prejudice to you is that you

15

cannot reindict, but the objection would be irrelevant to

16

that.

17

MR. DREEBEN:

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. DREEBEN:

The objection --

So, I mean -The objection would not be

20

irrelevant because -- for two different reasons.

First of

21

all, the -- the defendant, had he objected at the

22

pertinent time and had the Government concluded that this

23

was an objection that we should worry about, could have

24

sought indictments on other counts relating to substantive

25

drug violations if it believed that the sentence that it

Page 17
Alderson Reporting Company

was about to obtain was not sufficient.

2

position today because it's the year 2002, and the statute

3

of limitations will have run on many other drug offenses

4

that we might have brought.
QUESTION:

5

We're not in that

Oh, you mean you could have just hit

him with another -- hit the defendants with another

MR. DREEBEN:

9

Well, any -- a substantive drug

10

count is a separate offense from a conspiracy offense.

11

This Court has held that in Felix v. United States and

12

reaffirmed it more broadly in United States v. Dixon.

13

there would have been no double jeopardy objection.

So,

But the Government is no longer in the position

14
15

where we can extricate ourselves from the -- the dilemma

16

that the court of appeals has placed us in.

17

defendants will not receive the sentence that the

18

sentencing guidelines called for and that the statute

authorizes.

defendant would be who had timely objected.

MR. DREEBEN:

2

QUESTION:

That's right.

That's right.

And that, Mr. Dreeben, seems to me a

3

substantial difference.

4

-- the very last step in a plain error analysis, but you

5

seem to stop short of that and you said there wasn't any

6

substantial difference.

7

troublesome because the disparity in sentencing is large.
MR. DREEBEN:

8
9

So, I follow your argument at the

And I think that that's

The disparity in sentencing is

large both from the Government's point of view and from

10

the defendant's point of view.

The way that the

11

Government looks at this question is would the defendant

12

have gotten the same sentence if he had been accorded the

13

procedures that he now claims that he should have been

14

given.

15

obtain an indictment that mentioned drug quantity and it

16

had understood that the Constitution required the jury,

17

not the judge, to make that finding, would the defendant

18

be better off or the same off?

If the Government had understood that it had to

That is exactly the kind of analysis that the

19
20

Court used in Johnson v. United States and Neder v. United

21

22

the procedure that the defendant has been deprived of

would have made a difference to him.

24

make a difference to him if he could have compelled the

sentencing judge to drop down to 20 years as a result of

the Government's failure to put drug quantity in the

2

indictment, and that's what would happen today if this

3

case were unfolding in a post-Apprendi world.
But in a pre-Apprendi world, particularly where

4

the defendant didn't object, it makes more sense to look

at the problem as one of a deprivation of procedure and to

ask whether the possession of the procedure would have -QUESTION:

Mr. Dreeben, can I ask you this

I understand it's not this case, but would the

10

Government -- what -- what would the Government's position

11

be if the evidence of quantity came out after the trial

12

was concluded just as a result of a pre-sentence

13

investigation and then a finding by the judge?

14

-- what should happen in that kind of case?

15

MR. DREEBEN:

In that kind of case, our position

would be the same, that particularly on plain error

MR. DREEBEN:

Because Neder wouldn't apply to that.
Well, it's not clear that -- that

23

Neder wouldn't apply to it.

It's true that in Neder

24

itself, the Government proved up all of the evidence

25

relevant to materiality at the trial.

But in many cases,

Page 20
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

that were tried -QUESTION:

But you would take the same position

3

even if all the evidence developed post-trial during the

4

pre-sentence investigation.

5

MR. DREEBEN:

That's right.

We would.

But, as

6

Your Honor has indicated, the Court wouldn't have to agree

7

with that in order to sustain in this case.

8
9

And this case is the far more typical one in
which the grand jury investigation itself developed

10

substantial evidence of drug quantity.

11

that before the trial, and the trial evidence itself is

12

where the evidence of drug quantity was adduced.

13

QUESTION:

Everybody knew

Mr. Dreeben, I -- I'm not sure I --

14

you say we should determine whether substantial rights

15

have been affected by -- by asking whether if the

16

procedure that has been omitted had not been omitted, he

17

would have been -- he would have been convicted anyway.

18

-- I just -- that -- that seems to me extravagant.

19

mean, that -- that would mean that if there were no

20

indictment at all, you just go to the jury without an

21

indictment and the jury convicts him of murder, you could

22

come in and say, well, his substantial rights weren't

23

affected because had there been a murder indictment, there

24

was plenty of evidence to -- to convict him of murder.

25

-- is that the position the Government's taking?

MR. DREEBEN:

No, it's not the position that

2

we're taking, Justice Scalia.

3

Government's position in this case doesn't have to go to a

4

total omission of any grand jury indictment at all.

5

as in Neder, the Court made perfectly clear that although

6

harmless error analysis would apply to the omission of an

7

element, it would not apply to a directed verdict -QUESTION:

8
9

And the logic of -- of the

Just

No, but my -- my point is it seems to

me the way you decide whether substantial rights have been

affected is not to ask the question would he -- would he

have been convicted anyway.

was no indictment.

14

Period.

His substantial rights were affected.

MR. DREEBEN:

15

Even though he would have

Well, there -- there is a class of

16

cases in which the Court will find an effect on

17

substantial rights without regard to the strength of the

18

evidence.

19

QUESTION:

I don't think so.

20

MR. DREEBEN:

And those cases are called

21

structural error cases.

And as the Court is well aware,

22

that's a very narrow category.

23

the Neder case whether structural error did apply to the

24

petty jury's failure to decide an element to the offense,

25

and the Court held that it was not a case of structural

error.
Even the dissenting view in Neder, however,

2
3

recognized that when there wasn't an objection at trial

4

and the case comes up on plain error review and the Court

5

might find an effect on substantial rights, it's still not

6

required to reverse.

7

articulated in United States v. Olano and in Johnson v.

8

United States, was there an effect on the fairness,

9

integrity, and public reputation of judicial proceedings.
QUESTION:

10

It applies the -- the test that was

It seems to me that's the step that

11

you -- that you should put your -- your emphasis on in

12

this case, not the -- not the substantial right.
MR. DREEBEN:

13

Well, that's all the Court needs

14

to hold in order to conclude that the court of appeals

15

erred in this case because the court of appeals in this

16

case got to the fourth step of plain error review, after

17

finding an effect on substantial rights, and then it held

18

that we really can't say what the grand jury would have

19

done.

20

the grand jury is a body that operates without any legal

21

restrictions at all on whether it can charge or not.

22

We're not permitted to speculate about that because

That proposition that the grand jury is

23

essentially free to charge or not, regardless of the

24

evidence, is inconsistent with the historical record of

25

the way grand juries operated.

The charges that were

2

early years of this Nation made clear that grand juries

3

had a duty to indict when there was probable cause to

4

believe that an offense had been committed.

5

jurors' oath similarly reflected that grand jurors should

6

indict when the evidence justifies that.

And the grand

Yes, but can I just give you sort of

of quantity developed after the grand jury had returned

Supposing all the evidence

its indictment that it developed, but in the plea

11

bargaining they found out how much drug there really was

12

involved, you'd treat that as the same case even though

13

the grand jury could not have indicted.

14

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, if that case took place, as

15

this one did, in a legal regime in which the Government

16

didn't believe it had to get a grand jury indictment on

17

the point, then I suppose my answer to that is if we had

18

known, we could have gone back to the grand jury and

19

gotten a superseding --

20

QUESTION:

No.

But you didn't know the evidence

21

at the time is what I'm saying.

22

MR. DREEBEN:

23

Oh, we could have gotten a

MR. DREEBEN:

Okay.

9

MR. DREEBEN:

It's your

That's true, but the defendant on

this case proceeded on the same theory as we did.

The

10

defendant never objected.

11

that there was a contest as to the amount of drug quantity

12

in question that increased the sentence.

13

is that the entire sentencing proceeding unfolded with all

14

parties fully well understanding that the legal regime in

15

place at the time meant that drug quantity did not have to

16

be charged in the indictment.

17

The defendant never believed

And the result

And the proposition that a grand jury is free to

18

reject the evidence of drug quantity and determine itself

19

that it just doesn't want to charge the greater offense

20

would be fundamentally at odds with the democratic system

21

in this country.

22

drug quantity can increase the penalties.

23

this case established to the satisfaction of the

24

Government that those increased quantities were there, and

25

therefore the increased penalties should be applied.

Congress has voted a regime in which

QUESTION:

Of course, if we see it your way, it

2

would be open to prosecutors all the time simply to make

3

the grand jury proceeding a short-cut and not bother to

4

get into quantity and, hence, not, in -- in effect, advise

5

the -- the grand jury that it's -- that it's going for

6

something that might have the -- the potential for life.

7

And even in a post-Apprendi regime, I suppose you could

8

say, well, it was harmless error because the -- the

9

quantity -- the -- the evidence of quantity was there and

10

therefore we -- we shouldn't regard it as structural and

11

we should overlook it.

12

MR. DREEBEN:

You could make that argument,

13

Justice Souter, but in a post-Apprendi environment,

14

Apprendi is a sufficiently well-known decision of this

15

Court that no prosecutor would responsibly go to

16

sentencing and say I would like to have an increased

17

sentence regardless of the fact that we didn't charge drug

18

quantity.

19

defendants or judges that wouldn't catch the error if the

20

prosecutor didn't itself bring it to the attention of a

21

court.

And it's hard for me to imagine that there are

QUESTION:

22

How about in this case?

If -- if the

23

standard were harmless error rather than plain error,

24

would you maintain that the Government should still

25

prevail?

5

strong that no rational grand jury could have failed to

6

find the increased drug quantity and the defendants were

not deprived of notice and an opportunity to contest it.

8

So, even though there was error, the error has to be

weighed against the important values of essentially

The underlying values of the

And weighing those against each other, the conclusion

should be that the court of appeals should affirm rather

than reverse.
QUESTION:

But the Court could well conclude

otherwise were the test harmless error and you could still

prevail.

That's correct.

And most of the

19

cases that we are dealing with in this transitional era of

20

drug prosecutions that were tried before Apprendi but are

now on appeal after Apprendi, do not involve objections by

ORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY J. SULLIVAN

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

MR. SULLIVAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I'd like to direct my first comment to the

13

question that the Chief -- Mr. Chief Justice asked about

14

didn't the indictment and the verdict correspond.

15

Chief Justice, you're exactly correct.

16

that the sentence didn't correspond.

QUESTION:

Mr.

The problem is

And these defendants

I think my point was that Bain

21

involved a situation where the verdict and the indictment

22

didn't correspond, and that a rule that says that's

23

jurisdictional might not extend to this situation.

24
25

MR. SULLIVAN:
twofold in this case.

The issue with jurisdictional is
One deals with the Court's

Page 28
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

sentencing jurisprudence, which goes back all the way to

2

In re Bonner, which is essentially unchallenged by the

3

Government, which sets the proposition that any excess

4

sentence beyond the statutory maximum is void.

5

And that was at the heart of Apprendi.

And

6

Apprendi says and recognizes that a district court judge,

7

like Judge Blake in Baltimore, was limited necessarily at

8

her outer limits with what's charged in the indictment and

9

what's found by the petit jury.

A district court does not

10

have a sense of roving jurisdiction under 3231.

11

12

jury with a specific offense, that sentence must be

13

rendered for that specific offense.

believe that a -- a case that's old somehow loses its

force after Apprendi.

19

QUESTION:

Well, but I -- I think you have to

20

recognize that the Court at that time, because there was

21

no direct appeal, kind of expanded the concept of

jurisdiction to reach constitutional error.

(Laughter.)

15

MR. SULLIVAN:

Perhaps I overstated --

No, I don't think you did.
Right.

In -- in -- my point is simple,

16

Justice Scalia, is that in pre-Apprendi practice, the --

17

the Fourth Circuit made it abundantly clear to defense

18

attorneys and to Government attorneys that we were not to

19

concern ourselves with sentencing factors of drug quantity

20

at the time of sentencing.

21

QUESTION:

Did some defense attorneys make the

22

objection for the record in any case?

I'm thinking back

23

in the old days when there was jury discrimination and the

24

courts routinely said no, but many defense attorneys,

25

knowing they were going to lose on it, made it for the

Page 32
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

record anyway, hoping that their case on appeal would be

2

the one that changed the law?
MR. SULLIVAN:

3

Justice Ginsburg, I'm sure there

4

are attorneys who did that.

That was not done in -- in

5

our case.

6

Apprendi way under the sentencing guidelines.

We challenged drug quantity in the typical pre-

I'm reminded that in Johnson, this Court

7
8

indicated that sometimes defense attorneys aren't expected

9

to make laundry lists of objections, and I would dare

10

suggest that many of the judges that I appear in front of

11

would not be too welcoming of my trying to speculate what

12

this body would do two or three terms from now.
So, I don't think that -- I'm sure that there

13
14

are attorneys throughout the country who were making these

15

types of objections, sensing the change from McMillan and

16

Almandarez-Torres, sensing the direction of this Court,

17

but we -- we did not.
QUESTION:

18

That's -- I -- I'll take that as a

19

given.

20

expect you to -- to object to all these things.

21

I'll say, yes, it is a surprise.

I couldn't

But in terms of recognizing plain error, where

22

I'm having a problem is I don't see how you could treat

23

the grand jury any differently from the trial.

24

say, if you have a trial and there is a failure to object,

25

what we've said in our cases is it's not plain error

That is to

unless it's very unusual circumstances.
Now, whatever those unusual circumstances are,

2
3

if they're present here, it should be both, and if they're

not present here, how could you possibly say that a person

who goes through a full trial and it has the defect can't

object, but a person who's had that defect at the grand

7

jury stage, but it's cured at the trial stage, could

8

object?

way.

10

I just don't see how a system could function that

MR. SULLIVAN:

Justice Breyer, my -- my answer

is that it all goes back to the Indictment Clause of the

Mr. Sullivan, I have the same problem

that Justice Breyer has.

I didn't -- you know, I didn't

waive a grand jury.

But the defendant could certainly

MR. SULLIVAN:

A defendant can certainly waive a

7

grand jury and proceed by information.

But just if a --

8

if a defendant chooses to waive the grand jury and go by

9

information, that doesn't mean that they can be sentenced

10

for a crime that they don't waive the indictment for.

11

for example, if a defendant waives jurisdiction on an 841

12

case and allows to go by indictment and --

QUESTION:

What -- what do you mean when you say

waived jurisdiction?
MR. SULLIVAN:

Your Honor.

go by an information.

18

So,

I don't mean waive jurisdiction,

I meant waive -- waive indictment and -- and

You can only be sentenced for the crime that

19

you've waived for, that you've knowingly and intelligently

20

waived for.

21

You can't be sentenced for another crime.

QUESTION:

Well, but the idea that you can waive

a grand jury suggests that perhaps it is no -- certainly

no higher than the -- the petty jury right.

Mr. Sullivan, you -- the fact that

relevant.

that what the Fourth Circuit said which is that the

quantum of evidence is irrelevant when the problem stems

from a defect in the indictment from the very beginning

7

I think that's a mathematical, you know,

But I would suggest, Justice Stevens, that now

8

in the post-Apprendi environment, defense attorneys are

9

taking a much different strategy and not giving up or --

10

or just resting on drug quantity or challenging drug

11

quantity, challenging the laboratories, challenging the

12

weights of the drugs, distancing ourselves like we would

normally do in conspiracy cases farther away from clients

who are holding heavy amounts of drugs because we now know

that drug quantity is -- is very important.

MR. SULLIVAN:

It was still the

6

Justice Ginsburg, that under Apprendi Judge Blake -- she

was the wrong judge applying the wrong standard of proof.

8

She was the wrong fact finder and the wrong standard of

proof.
QUESTION:

10

I guess that's your point.

I guess

11

that's a fair point that there's -- there is more of an

12

incentive to raise it before the jury because the jury has

13

to find it beyond a reasonable doubt.

14

chances of -- of winning a -- a contest of the amount

15

before the jury are much better than your chances of

16

winning one before the judge.

And therefore, your

But -- but if we said we want to send

19

That's correct.

I assume.

this back so that you can have the advantage of Apprendi,

22

there's nothing the Government can do because it can't

reindict.

24
25

MR. SULLIVAN:

The Government cannot -- I take

the position, Justice Kennedy, that the -- that the

Page 39
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Government cannot reindict on double jeopardy grounds, but

2

our clients would still receive 20-year sentences in the

3

Bureau of Prisons.
QUESTION:

4

I -- I understand that.

But assume,

5

as the courts of appeals uniformly seemed to have held,

6

that Apprendi is not retroactive to convictions that are

7

final, and assume that the Government can protect itself

8

in a post-Apprendi world.

9

this narrow line of cases where you seem to have an -- an

10

automatic escape hatch and the Government can't retry.
MR. SULLIVAN:

11

What we're talking about is

And I find that fantastic because

it's usually the other way around.

(Laughter.)

MR. SULLIVAN:

defense wins and oftentimes the Government wins, Justice

17

Kennedy.

palatable to some -- to some people.

19

And perhaps the results in this case are not

QUESTION:

But in this case --

Well, Mr. -- Mr. Sullivan, in light

20

of the Johnson case and the Neder case, I think the

21

Government has a very strong argument here.

22

-- you could fail under Johnson to include an element in

23

the jury instructions and, nonetheless, conclude that it

24

was not plain error.

25

MR. SULLIVAN:

I mean, you

Johnson, Justice O'Connor, again there -- there was a

4

trial.

5

know to this very date, quite frankly, whether the grand

6

jury was ever asked to make a determination on drug

7

quantity in the superseding indictment, and that's the

8

problem.

There was an adversarial process.

9

In Neder and

And we don't

In Neder and Johnson, there was a record.

There

10

was a great record that this Court could apply the

11

appropriate test.

12

Cotton case, because there is no complete record for this

13

Court to go back and basically usurp the responsibilities

14

of the indictment because we don't know whether on a

15

certain date the Government brought in their witnesses to

16

establish drug quantity.

17

this case, and I think that is the fundamental difference

18

that distinguishes the line of cases of Neder and Johnson

19

that go to trial problems as opposed to indictment

20

problems.
QUESTION:

21
22

You can't do that in this case, in the

We simply don't know that in

Under the first indictment, would the

jury have been instructed that it had to find the amounts?
MR. SULLIVAN:

no.

25

that drug quantities are not your concern would have been

7

it seems to me that what you just told us goes against any

Is this something that's fundamentally

MR. SULLIVAN:

And

Justice Ginsburg, I had -- the

10

Olano test is quite clear that you don't -- well, that a

11

decision on a basic right that is forfeited doesn't matter

12

on -- if somebody is innocent or guilty.

13

stronger and much more important than that.

14

It's much

I do suggest, most respectfully, that the

15

integrity of the court under the fourth Olano prong would

16

be impaired if the -- the decision is that you can be

17

indicted for one offense and convicted for another

18

offense, that that's why the fairness and the integrity of

19

the judicial proceedings comes into question.

20

integrity of the court, the power of the court to do the

most -- one of the most important things to a person who's

they're charged with.

MR. SULLIVAN:

11

I -- I don't think that that --

12

that that would have been -- you never use drug quantities

13

as a defense.
QUESTION:

14

All right.

So, that's -- that -- you

15

see the reason -- the reason that I say that is because

16

they're saying, look, this error is harmless, and part of

17

the strength of your claim I think is that they never

18

could have thought of it at the trial before Apprendi to

19

raise it.

20

But if it is harmless and you're really arguing

21

for us to make an exception from Neder, as well as the

22

grand jury, I wonder if there's any response to the view I

23

just stated.

24
25

I mean, that it was harmless.

MR. SULLIVAN:

I don't think it can be harmless,

Justice Breyer, because the very thrust of Neder, the very

Page 44
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

thrust of harmless error analysis is the Government must

2

prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the error didn't

3

affect substantial rights.

4

Government could make that burden of proof in this case -QUESTION:

5
6

Well, in Neder, didn't the Court

assume that substantial rights were affected?

7

MR. SULLIVAN:

8

QUESTION:

9

And I don't know how the

it did.

I think -- I think --

I think in either Neder or Johnson,

I forget which one it is.
And then -- so they went to the fourth prong and

10
11

said, you know, even assuming substantial rights are

12

affected, you know, this -- this is not going to reflect

13

on the integrity of the -- the court system or whatever

14

the fourth prong reads.

15

MR. SULLIVAN:

That -- I think you're obviously

16

correct, Mr. Chief Justice, but I think the important

17

thing too about Neder is that the Court was -- was

18

convinced -- I think part of its position was that the

19

correct standard of proof that the district judge on the

20

materiality element found it by -- beyond a reasonable

21

doubt.

22

mishmash of different standards of proof like we do in

23

this case here where -- where some elements of the

24

indictment are found beyond a reasonable doubt and some

25

elements are found by a preponderance of the evidence and

So, I think that we don't have a problem with a

1

you have different fact finders performing -- performing

2

different functions.

3

QUESTION:

What I was trying to direct your

4

attention to, which is -- and maybe this doesn't help you.

5

But I thought that Neder -- and I'd have to reread it to

6

be sure -- was saying the omission of an element doesn't

7

always automatically mean no clear error, but it might

8

sometimes.

9

this is one of those unusual cases or exceptional cases

And so, I guess if it might sometimes, maybe

10

where it would.

11

treated very fairly -- unfairly and the criminal justice

12

system must have suffered in its reputation.

13

might have something to say on that point, and I wanted to

14

be sure you did if you do.

15

But if so, your clients must have been

MR. SULLIVAN:

Now, you

And my point is, Justice Breyer,

16

that I agree with the premise of your question and my

17

answer would be that Neder and that harmless error rule

18

enunciated there would be utterly meaningless in this case

19

because there's no object and no gap that any reviewing

20

court could fill because we don't know and we will never

21

know what happened in front of the grand jury when that

22

element was not returned.

23

And it's precisely that no object to scrutinize

24

for harmless, which you'll never have in a trial for the

25

most part because of the adversarial process, because of

Page 46
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

more of a procedural issue --

But it said that, you know, you can't

So, I think

May I go back to your argument that

Page 47
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

you made a second ago that we never know what the grand

2

jury would have done if it had been presented with the

3

evidence?

4

is, number one, I think we have a pretty clear body of law

5

that tells the grand jury what its duty is, if it is

6

presented with evidence which would justify an indictment

7

with respect to quantity and hence the severity of the

8

crime.

9

The difficulty that I have with that argument

And if we're going to respect that law on duty,

10

then in order to see it your way, we have to say, well,

11

regardless of what the grand jury's duty is and regardless

12

of what the probability is that it would indict and -- and

13

would specify the quantity, we have to assume that there's

14

a wild card element in the grand jury.

15

of that wild card element, you never absolutely know what

16

they're going to do.

17

in fact, you can never assess the harmfulness of the

18

error.

And on the basis

We are -- we are going to hold that,

How do we get to the point of dispensing with

19
20

our law on grand jury duty and emphasizing the wild card

21

element, in effect, of the grand jury when it refuses to

22

follow that obligation?

23

that?

24
25

MR. SULLIVAN:

How -- how are we able to do

Justice Souter, I think the

answer is that we try to remain as true as we can to the

Alderson Reporting Company

1

Framers' intent and the Framers' fear of a corrupt

2

judiciary or an oppressive prosecutor.

3

that bulk word or whatever -- whatever that barrier that

4

exists between the process, that very threshold that

5

brings someone into the criminal justice system that that

6

cannot be -- that is indispensable to our system.

And that bulk --

7

QUESTION:

Well, wasn't that a fear --

8

QUESTION:

Go ahead.

9

QUESTION:

Wasn't -- wasn't that a fear, in

10

effect, that grand juries are simply going to be puppets

11

that are going to be indicting without regard to evidence?

12

Whereas, here the assumption is the evidence is

13

overwhelming, and so that policy of wanting the grand jury

14

to stand between the state and the individual is not

15

really a policy that's implicated here.
MR. SULLIVAN:

16

I -- you're right in that regard,

17

Justice Souter, but we don't know if the Government did

18

its duty and presented to this grand jury drug quantities

19

in the superseding indictment.

20

based on any record that we can discern, whether or not

21

that major element, that critical element that -- that

22

drives the sentences in this case was ever presented to

25

beauties of it.

So, we don't even know,

They can charge greater offenses, lesser

sentence, no -- no -- I mean, not -- offenses, or none at

2

all, and they can even nullify, although it's not -- we --

3

we shouldn't encourage it.

4

QUESTION:

But they tend not to nullify, I

5

think, except when there are political considerations that

6

the grand jury sort of smells in the circumstances.

7

one thing it seems to me clear is that the grand juries

8

are not likely to smell political considerations when the

9

Government decides to go after kingpins as opposed to when

And

10

the Government decides to go after mules.

11

don't see that concern as coming to the fore in this case.

12

MR. SULLIVAN:

And so, I -- I

And I -- and I guess it goes

13

back, Justice Souter, to where I began this morning.

14

the Government's responsibility to indict each defendant

15

based on their roles and their culpability.

16

in and just do a blanket 846 indictment.

17

delineate each and every element of each and every offense

18

for each and every defendant.

19

failure in this case.

20

It's

You can't go

You must

And that's the Government's

Look, I -- I understand the fact that it's not

21

terribly difficult for the Government to obtain a Federal

22

grand jury indictment.

23

they -- a Federal grand jury will no-bill what the U.S.

24

Attorney wants him or her to do or them to do.

25

tension there.

I mean, I -- it's very rare that

There is a

But I think the rule of law and the purpose of

2

the grand jury and why we need the grand jury is far

3

greater than whether or not Mr. Hall, the leader of this

4

drug conspiracy, is going to do life or 20 years or by

5

whether other people who may have had different roles in

6

the conspiracy which no drug quantity has ever been

7

attributed to them -- there's evidence that they have been

8

involved in multiple conspiracies.

9

or couriers or street vendors or kingpins, sometimes the

Whether they're mules

10

rule of law requires that -- that fairness be done.

11

-- and fairness in this case is a sentence based on what

12

you were charged with, not a sentence based on something

13

that you weren't charged with.

14

QUESTION:

And

I think you -- I think you've got a

15

good argument there except for the fact that we've got to

16

find a distinction between the role of the grand juries

17

and the petty grand juries given the fact that Neder is --

18

is on the record.

19

for something and kind of shooting down everything that I

20

could come up with.

21

And that's -- that's why I was fishing

And that's the dilemma I have.

MR. SULLIVAN:

The dilemma is, Justice Souter --

22

is that what -- this would crack open the gate to allow, I

23

would suggest, the Government to trample into the -- the

24

grand jury function.

25

room each and every day, but now they can indict for one

They already go into the grand jury

here, charge one thing -QUESTION:

But that didn't happen here.

They

didn't indict for one thing and prove another thing.

agreed --

MR. SULLIVAN:

QUESTION:

But --

-- the -- the verdict corresponded to

the indictment.
MR. SULLIVAN:

10

You

No.

I'm talking in a different

case, a more broader case, not this actual case.
QUESTION:

11

Well, wait.

You don't -- you don't

12

agree that the verdict corresponded to the indictment, do

13

you?

14

not in this case is because of Neder.

15

under Neder, whether the verdict corresponded to the

16

indictment.

17

why you're driven back to the -- to the grand jury

argument.

20

I -- I thought the only reason that that issue was
It doesn't matter,

That can be harmless error.

MR. SULLIVAN:

Right?

Which is

That's correct, but it's also

correct that I told the Chief Justice earlier that --

21

(Laughter.)

22

MR. SULLIVAN:

-- that the -- that the problem

23

is a sentencing problem in this case and not a difference

24

between -- well, it is a -- my time is up.

25

(Laughter.)
