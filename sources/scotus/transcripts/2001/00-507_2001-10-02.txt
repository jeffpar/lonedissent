CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GRAYDON D. LUTHEY, JR.

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. LUTHEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Chickasaw and Choctaw Nations ask this Court

12

to hold that Congress has afforded tribes the same

13

exemption from Federal wagering taxes enjoyed by State

14

governmental wagering operations.

15

We do not base our claim on policy untethered to

16

statutory text, but instead we base our claim today on

17

section 20(d) of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act codified

18

at 25 U.S.C., section 2719(d).

19

Unfortunately, for all concerned, that statutory

20

text is ambiguous, as every appellate judge which has

21

examined it has held either expressly or implicitly, and

22

as we expect the Government to admit today if the question

23

is put to them.

24
25

One of the possible constructions of that
ambiguous statute, based on its text and structure and

1

giving effect to every word of the statute and bolstered

2

by its legislative history, is that the tax exemption

3

afforded States by Internal Revenue Code chapter 35,

4

expressly referenced in section 2719(d), applies equally

5

to tribal wagering operations.

QUESTION:

7

you're talking about in the brief or in --

Where do we find this exact text that

MR. LUTHEY:

I would direct Your Honor to the

petitioner's appendix 90a, to our appendix for certiorari.

QUESTION:

MR. LUTHEY:

Haven't you set it out on page 3?
Yes, sir.

It's also there.

On page 3 of your brief?

handier reference then I think.

14

MR. LUTHEY:

That's a

Now, starting with the actual text

15

of the statute, we believe that the statute contains two

16

central textual commands:

17

reporting and withholding of taxes from gaming -- from --

18

from the winnings from gaming, and also the application of

19

the Internal Revenue Code provisions concerning wagering

20

operations.

21

two distinct concepts involving distinct provisions of the

22

Internal Revenue Code.

23

one that has to do with the

It's the tribes' contention that these are

And we find the basis for the distinction in two

24

places.

One is the disjunctive or that connects gaming

25

and wagering operations, and the additional support we

find is in the parenthetical that precedes the reference

2

to these two discrete concepts.

3

And if the Court would look at the parenthetical

4

that leads in this statute and gives five separate

5

examples of portions of the Internal Revenue Code that

6

Congress intended to apply --

7

QUESTION:

Before you -- before you proceed

8

further with this argument that you make in your reply

brief, did you present it, this or distinguishing gaming

10

on the one hand from wagering operations?

11

that to the Tenth Circuit?

16

MR. LUTHEY:

Did you present

Not directly like that, Your Honor,

we did not.
QUESTION:

And did you present it in your

opening brief?
MR. LUTHEY:

What we did, Your Honor, in the

17

opening brief is adopt the decision by the majority in the

18

Little Six decision from the Federal circuit.

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. LUTHEY:

Which does not make this argument.
No.

We made this argument in

direct reply to the Government's assertion in its answer

22

brief that there is only one central textual command;

23

namely, the Government would have you believe that the

24

statute applies only to --

1

You raised it for the first time in your reply brief.

2

MR. LUTHEY:

To address specifically, Your

3

Honor, the Government's position which we claim is based

4

on a false premise.

5

QUESTION:

Well, that was not a new position.

6

The Government had always said that this is how it should

7

be read, and the fact is that what you say is the -- is

8

the meaning of it was a meaning that didn't occur to you

9

until -- until the reply brief.

I mean, I think that

10

suggests how implausible a reading it is.

11

argument should have been made much sooner if -- if it was

12

so -- so evident.

13

Surely, this

I mean, the way -- why don't you read the

14

provision the way -- the way you would have us read it?

15

It is --

16
17

MR. LUTHEY:

The way we would have the provision

read, Your Honor, is set out at page 9.

QUESTION:

19

MR. LUTHEY:

Page what?
Page 9 of the reply brief where we

20

suggest that concerning addresses two distinct central

21

textual commands in -- in contradiction, Your Honor, to

22

the Government's assertion that there is one central

23

textual command.

25

QUESTION:

Right.

And you would say that the

way to read it is, concerning the -- the way it reads, if

one would read it normally, is, concerning the reporting

2

and withholding of taxes with respect to the winnings from

gaming or wagering operations.

4

say with respect to the winnings from gaming or wagering

5

operations, but you want to read it concerning, A, the

6

reporting and withholding of taxes with respect to the

7

winnings from gaming or, B, wagering operations.

8

that's just a very strained reading of it, it seems to me.

9

MR. LUTHEY:

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. LUTHEY:

Now, the normal mind would

And

Your Honor, if I could respond.
I wish you would.
I -- I think our reading is

12

informed by the parenthetical reference that precedes

13

these two concepts, and particularly the text and

14

structure of that parenthetical reference.

15

parenthetical reference identifies five particular

16

portions of the Internal Revenue Code.

17

sections 1441, 3402(q), and 6041, clearly apply to

18

concerning the reporting and withholding of taxes with

respect to the winnings from gaming.

QUESTION:

But would you explain to me?

I

thought that gaming -- a gaming operations or wagering

operations -- perhaps you can clarify what is the

difference between gaming as a noun and wagering

7

operations?

8
9

MR. LUTHEY:

It's our -- and you hit right

exactly on the point, Your Honor.

It's our position that

10

gaming is a noun and the wagering refers to operations.

11

And the way that you can see that is by the specific

12

division in the parenthetical examples.

have to do with the reporting and withholding of taxes

from winnings by players from gaming.

between those two?
MR. LUTHEY:

The difference is how it is used in

the context of this statute.

illustrated by the division within the five express

illustrations contained in the parenthetical.

is the difference between winnings from gaming and

2

winnings from wagering operations.

MR. LUTHEY:

Winnings from gaming here refers to

winnings by the players from gaming, money paid to players

as a result of gaming, winnings from what the players do.

QUESTION:

English language, between gaming and wagering?

Is there a difference, just in the

MR. LUTHEY:

They -- they could be regarded

synonymous if both are used as nouns, Mr. Chief Justice,
or both are used as adjectives.

11

Here we -- we contend that the distinction is

informed by the parenthetical.

13

two --

14

QUESTION:

If you look at the last

May I just ask?

Under your reading,

15

what -- using Justice Scalia's A and B, what function does

16

A play?

17

MR. LUTHEY:

What function A plays is that the

18

tax is imposed on the winnings from gaming as a result of

19

what the players have won.

20
21
22

QUESTION:

Wouldn't that have been picked up

anyway, just in your reading from wagering on?
MR. LUTHEY:

Not necessarily because when you

23

get to the second set, Your Honor, particularly 6050I and

24

chapter 35, the text of those provisions have nothing to

25

do with winnings.

QUESTION:

No.

But -- but if it just read

2

concerning wagering operations, just leave out all of the

3

A part, if it said concerning wagering operations, it

4

would pick up those provisions that require wagering

operations to withhold and report the winning -- the

winnings of players.

are not the provisions that imposed the tax on the

8

players.

operations to withhold that tax and to report it.

The provisions you're referring to

They're the provisions that require the wagering
Isn't

that right?

11

MR. LUTHEY:

12

QUESTION:

Well -So, wouldn't that have been covered

13

just as easily by simply saying concerning wagering

14

operations?

15

MR. LUTHEY:

Well, section 1441 and 3402

16

actually do impose a tax, a percentage of tax, that is on

17

the winnings from gaming.

QUESTION:

Chapter 35 --

That's the chapter we're -- okay,

that's the --

MR. LUTHEY:

Chapter 35 is different, Your

21

Honor.

22

Chapter 35 imposes a -- a tax on the operator based on the

23

wagers that have been received, not the money that the

24

operator has paid out.

Chapter 35 imposes no tax on anyone from winnings.

QUESTION:

Let me put it this way, and it's

2

suggested by Justice Ginsburg's line of questioning.

3

the Internal Revenue Code require any withholding of

4

winnings from wagering operations?

5

MR. LUTHEY:

6

QUESTION:

Does

Yes, sir.
Well, then that, it seems to me,

7

destroys your argument because you -- you are -- you want

8

to say that gaming covers the entire universe of winnings

9

that are subject to withholding.

But then you answered my

10

question there are also winnings from wagering that are

11

subject to withholding.

12

statute does not permit withholding for that.

13

MR. LUTHEY:

14

QUESTION:

And your way of parsing the

If you -So, it seems to me that -- that

15

destroys the distinction you're trying to make which is

16

what Justice Ginsburg's line of questioning, it seemed,

17

suggested to me at least.

18

MR. LUTHEY:

With respect, Your Honor, if you

19

look at wagering and gaming as nouns, they could be read

20

to refer to the same thing.

21

operations on one hand as a concept that's distinct from

22

the reporting and withholding of taxes from gaming, it's

23

another matter entirely.

1

wagering operations, not to the reporting and withholding

2

of taxes on gaming.

3

QUESTION:

It has nothing to do with it.
The oddity of the argument to me is

4

that the -- you're -- I think your explanation is assuming

5

that the basic activity that's going on in a casino, which

6

is giving rise to each of these different kinds of

7

liability, is the same activity.

8

calling it -- you're calling it gaming when the card

9

player plays blackjack, but you're calling it wagering

And -- and you're

10

when the blackjack casino has to withhold money.

11

seems very odd to me, but maybe I don't understand your

12

argument.

13
14
15
16
17

QUESTION:

I guess you're calling it wagering

operations, not wagering.
MR. LUTHEY:

And that

Is that right?

That's -- that's exactly correct,

Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Yes, but the operation -- the

18

wagering operation for one purpose is gaming for another

19

purpose, and that -- as I understand your argument, and

20

that's just a very strange and confusing usage to impute

21

to the Congress.

22

MR. LUTHEY:

With respect, Your Honor, if -- if

23

the statute is read closely, the first three provisions of

24

the parenthetical apply to concerning the reporting and

25

withholding of taxes with respect to the winnings.

Is that right?

No.

withholding.

Nothing to do with reporting and

QUESTION:

If you're going to go to legislative

there was a bill that had the word not only the reporting

it.

MR. LUTHEY:

I'd like, Your Honor, to offer a

2

third explanation in response to your direct question.

3

you look at H.R. 1920, section 4, which was the first

4

version of IGRA that was -- that was put forward -- and

5

this is contained in our opening brief at pages 29 and 30

6

-- you will see that the initial draft, after -- after

7

mentioning provisions of the Internal Revenue Code,

8

identified two specific areas concerning the taxation and

the reporting and withholding of taxes.

If

Two areas.

There was a committee report from the House that

Internal Revenue Code, such as section 3402(q) and chapter

Concerning taxation was deleted, and the synonym

inserted in the text.

11

And when you see that legislative history, how

12

the synonym for concerning taxation was removed from the

13

legislative history committee report and brought to the

different kinds of presumptions that we face with language

that can be said to be ambiguous.

6

On the contrary, we have said that there are presumptions

7

that favor Indian tribes when there's an ambiguity.

8

it seems to me these presumptions are maybe a little bit

9

in tension with each other, and which one should we rely

And is there anything -- in the Mescalero Apache

case, which this Court decided, we did refuse to read an

13

exemption into vague statutory language for tax purposes.

14

How do you distinguish the principles we applied in

15

Mescalero?

16

MR. LUTHEY:

In Mescalero, Your Honor, there

17

were actually two particular taxes at issue.

One was a

18

gross receipts tax on off-reservation ski resort receipts,

19

and in that the Court went through the various statutes

20

that were being cited for the purpose of an exemption --

21

the New Mexico Enabling Act, the Indian Reorganization Act

22

-- and found no ambiguity.

23

provide application of the Indian law canon.

the Court said on the face of 465 there is no reason to

25

hold that it forbids income taxes.

So, there was no need to

It's a fairly limited exemption for State lotteries.

out about all this.

1

all taxation of wagering operations, and that would have

2

imported chapter 35 and also the State exemption.

3

It came out in a very different form.

It came

4

out not only with the word taxation deleted, the

5

parenthetical added, but also with the language about

6

winnings added, and that is why it's not, in fact,

7

possible to say that chapter 35 was just a substitution

8

for the deletion of the word taxation because it's not all

9

they did.

They also added the limitation that it applies

10

to winnings from gaming or wagering operations.

11

that's completely inconsistent with the application of

12

chapter 35.

13

QUESTION:

And

Is there someone over in the IRS

14

whose job it is to look through bills, when they finally

15

emerge, and check the cross references and the numbers who

16

might have caught what seems to be, in your argument

17

certainly, an accidental error in not taking a number out

18

that should have been taken out?

19

whose job it is to do that?

20

MR. DuMONT:

Is there anyone there

I would think there was.

There are a lot of people both at

21

the IRS and on the Hill whose job it is to comb through

22

tax legislation.

23

I would point out that this legislation came

24

through the Indian Affairs Committee.

It was drafted by

25

people who are not expert Internal Revenue Code drafters,

1

and it bears a resemblance, but only a resemblance, to the

2

kind of precision that one sees in tax legislation and in

3

the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code itself.

4

QUESTION:

After the split, though, between the

5

Tenth Circuit and the Federal circuit, did anyone call the

6

responsible committee's attention to this so that Congress

7

could fix up the statute?

8
9
10
11

MR. DuMONT:

I'm not aware that anyone has

brought this issue to -- onto the legislative agenda.

I

don't know that.
The other thing I would point out about the

12

language is that when they -- when the committee

13

reformulated this language to include the parenthetical,

14

the kind of parenthetical it is I think is important.

15

It's an example.

16

in the habit of ignoring parenthetical qualifications in

17

statutes, particularly not in the Internal Revenue Code.

18

But this is a special kind of parenthetical.

19

that says provisions of the Internal Revenue Code

20

concerning the reporting and withholding of taxes, and

then it has what is intended to be a helpful list of

It's exemplary parenthetical.

interpretation would do is to give particular and

So, what's interesting here is that although

QUESTION:

Well, it isn't surprising in the

7

broad sense that Congress clearly has favored Indian

8

gaming operations and has wanted to provide income to the

9

tribes for their purposes through those operations, and to

10

impose an excise tax on it when the Congress doesn't

11

impose it on the States would be perfectly consistent with

12

that overall objective, it seems to me.

13

MR. DuMONT:

I think it would have been

14

perfectly consistent to grant the exemption.

15

perfectly consistent not to grant the exemption.

16

therefore, I think the policy argument is sort of --

QUESTION:

I think it's

Maybe not as consistent because the

effort over there in Congress has been to support these

Indian gaming operations, not that I necessarily think

it's a good idea, but Congress obviously does.

may well have been their overall objective.

MR. DuMONT:

it's a mistake to get wrapped up in the details of this

What it was directed at, I submit, is making

sure that from the point of view of the gambler, there

gambler, there would be no difference in going to a State

lottery or a tribal lottery or a State game or a tribal

the gambler's winnings, are to be observed by the tribe in

11

the same way that they would be observed by the State.

12

And the only thing that has gotten us -- and

13

that's a perfectly clear set of rules and there's a

14

perfectly good reason for it.

15

mixed up in this case is the fact that there is what would

motive for the States to want to have these taxes imposed

The first is that, of course, if we get down to

hopelessly ambiguous and it must be interpreted with

reference to general principles, then the principle -- the

general canon of strictly construing Federal revenue

statutes.

MR. DuMONT:

cases that say that a general taxing statute, general

third one.

Indians really have two canons on their side

2

and the third one is, to my mind, the strongest and -- and

3

the one that's -- that's the hardest for you to overcome.

4

And that is that you never read a statute so that any of

5

its provisions is inoperative or senseless.

6

MR. DuMONT:

7

QUESTION:

And --

I agree with you, Your Honor.
To be sure, the Indians' proposed

8

interpretation here is strained, but you can do it;

9

whereas there is no possible way to read section 35 on

10

your interpretation as being relevant.

11

that?

12

-- that the Indians' interpretation is not only strained,

13

but it's really so strained, it's just -- it's just an

14

impossible interpretation.

15

interpretation using, you know, that A, B, using the or to

things together.

First of all, I'm looking at page --

QUESTION:

MR. DuMONT:

QUESTION:

6

MR. DuMONT:

7

The -- at the end of the -- what they want to do

90a of the -90a.
-- of the appendix to the petition.
But -- page 90a.

8

is to split gaming -- winnings from gaming or wagering

9

operations.

Now, first of all, the very last line of the

10

statute refers to State gaming and wagering operations,

11

and there it is used as a phrase.

12

that's powerful evidence that it's used as a phrase a few

13

lines up.

14

And we submit that

Second, in the very next breath from where it

15

says, with respect to the winnings from gaming or wagering

operations, the statute says, shall apply to Indian gaming

operations.

18

gaming.

19

Again, clearly the statute is using those two together.

20

It doesn't -- doesn't say, apply to Indian

It says, apply to Indian gaming operations.

Third, even if we were to accept that

21

interpretation, I'm not sure where it would get the tribes

22

here because if you accept that interpretation, then you

23

are divorcing winnings and gaming -- or sorry -- wagering

24

and gaming.

25

all the statute confers is a right to have these

It means they don't mean the same thing.

And

1

provisions apply to Indian gaming operations conducted

2

pursuant to this chapter in the same manner as it applies

3

to the States.

4

Now, if we're going to divorce gaming from

5

wagering operations, then having the provisions that apply

6

to gaming by the States tells you nothing about chapter 35

7

because chapter 35 applies to wagering operations.

8
9

So -- and -- and finally, I think, as Justice
Ginsburg and some of the other colloquies pointed out

10

earlier, the implication of that reading would be that the

11

reporting and withholding requirements that we all agree

12

are central to this statute somehow only apply to the

13

Indian gaming piece and they don't apply to the wagering

14

operations piece.

statute.

And that makes no sense out of the

QUESTION:

17

MR. DuMONT:

But -So, for all those reasons, I don't

18

think it's just a strained reading; I think it's an

19

impossible reading of the statute.

20

QUESTION:

But you do concede that, as I believe

21

Judge Dyke said, the only way to make sense out of the

22

statute is to treat it as though the reference to chapter

35 were not there.

MR. DuMONT:

I think that's right.

I think in

effect instead to the -- what we would call the operative

statutory text.

4

parenthetical, it wouldn't change anything about the --

5

the effect of this statute on sections 1441, 3402(q), or

6

6041 because those are provisions of the Internal Revenue

7

Code concerning the reporting and withholding of taxes

8

with respect to winnings, and so they would continue to

9

apply even if we deleted the entire parenthetical.

10

And as I said, if you took out the entire

What wouldn't continue to apply are these two

11

inapt examples -- or the one inapt example of chapter 35

12

and possibly 6050I.

13

this, I take no joy in saying that there are some words

14

that have no effect in the statute, but that is the

15

position we're left with, and it is by far the better

position of the two that are possible.
