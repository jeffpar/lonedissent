ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES F. JORDEN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. JORDEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

Petitioners' claim for injunctive and

12

declaratory relief to enforce the terms of the

13

reimbursement clause in the benefit plan at issue in this

14

case falls squarely within the language of ERISA, section

15

502(a)(3)(A), which appears in full text at page 13 of our

16

brief, which provides for a civil action by a fiduciary to

17

enjoin any act or practice which violates the terms of the

18

plan.

19

In its first amended complaint, Great-West

20

sought injunctive and declaratory relief prior to the time

21

any of the funds were disbursed in this matter in the

22

State court proceeding.

23

other appropriate equitable relief to enforce the terms of

24

the employee benefit plan.

So, I -- you know, I take that to mean an injunction that

MR. JORDEN:

Well, Your Honor, we believe that

12

the language and the structure and the purpose of ERISA

13

support the proposition that section 502(a)(3)(A),

14

specifically in this case (a)(3)(A), to enjoin the

15

Knudsons from disbursing funds as to which they had power

16

to determine --

17

QUESTION:

Well, if you want to talk about

purpose, I frankly don't see why it is in accord with the

19

purpose to limit the relief to equitable relief.

MR. JORDEN:

3

So, you don't think the injunction portion, to

enjoin any act or practice, refers to normal equitable

injunction.

would not have been available in equity.

7

It could be -- it's a type of injunction that

MR. JORDEN:

Well, Your Honor, two things.

8

First, I believe in this case on these facts the

9

injunction was a typical injunction.

Prior to the time

10

actions were taken by the Knudsons to disburse any of the

11

funds from -- from Hyundai, an injunction was sought

12

against them to prevent them from disbursing those funds

13

until the Federal claim under 502(a)(3) --

14

QUESTION:

Why isn't that clearly wrong?

I

15

mean, if you have an adequate remedy at law, I don't think

16

you can issue an injunction.

17

perfectly adequate remedy, that you go bring a suit under

18

State law?

You attach the asset, and if you win, you get

19

the money.

What's inadequate about that?

MR. JORDEN:

What's wrong with the

Two points on that, Your Honor.

21

First -- first is that if you're assuming that there's an

22

adequate remedy at law --

I'm trying to get your answer.

MR. JORDEN:

Judge Posner -- Judge Posner in

2

Health Cost Controls, Your Honor, v. Washington held that

3

a constructive trust was a proper remedy in this context.

4

And indeed, at common law, a -- in imposing a constructive

5

trust, courts of equity decided -- concluded, because

6

after all, a constructive trust was essentially imploding

7

legal remedies because the person attempting to -- to

8

impose the constructive trust did not have legal title to

9

the property, therefore courts of equity had to step in

and impose an equitable remedy.
QUESTION:

What you -- what you sought here, Mr.

Jorden, was an injunction, I take it.
MR. JORDEN:

That is correct, Your Honor, and

that is precisely within the language -QUESTION:

Yes, and I want to ask you some

detail about the injunction that was granted.
Was it simply an injunction that required the

18

respondent here to hold onto the funds, or was it an -- an

19

injunction against their refusing to pay the funds to you?

We sought an injunction either to

settlement or to enjoin the Knudsons, the respondents in

10

this case, from disbursing the funds that were ultimately

paid out in that settlement or from directing parties who

received those funds from disbursing those funds.

QUESTION:

But you didn't seek an injunction

against them for refusing to pay you the funds?

15

MR. JORDEN:

Well, as a part of the mandatory

16

injunction, the language of the mandatory injunction that

17

was sought, Your Honor, was to pay the plan the $411,000

18

that the Knudsons, unjustly enriched, owed back to the

19

plan.

20

QUESTION:

Well, supposing that you have a claim

against them refusing to pay the claim to you?

are seeking to enforce against someone that they -- that

4

they carry out the very obligation that, either under a

5

statute or under the terms of a plan, they're obliged to

carry out, as was the case in Bowen, the fact that money

might ultimately be paid does not make that money damages.

That's still specific relief.

And as this Court in Bowen determined, when you

That doesn't -- that doesn't

But take the case -- I was going to ask you a

promissory note becomes due, the individual is entitled to

an inheritance under a probate court decree.

paying the note?

Well, that goes to the question of

10

whether Great-West -- Great-West had no obligation to

11

intervene.

12

Pilot v. Krafka, which is -- which appears at page 29 of

13

our -- of our brief, in the footnote 11 -- State courts

14

have no jurisdiction to construe the terms of an ERISA

plan except under section 502(a)(1)(B) of ERISA which

16

allows a participant to bring a claim for benefits.

17

In -- in some cases, in fact, in Jefferson-

Now, if the participant had wanted, as the

18

Court-appointed amicus brief argues that this should have

19

all been decided in one court -- if the participant had

20

wanted to have this decided in State court, they could

21

have brought Great-West in by alleging a claim under

22

502(a)(1)(B).

23

Now, the State court would have had concurrent

jurisdiction.

That is the only place in ERISA which gives

State courts jurisdiction to construe the terms of a plan.

Bearing that in mind, Justice O'Connor, if

2

Great-West were to intervene, it would be asking the State

court to construe the terms of the plan to determine the

You're not construing it.

MR. JORDEN:

Well, I think, Your Honor, if you

10

look at the -- at the district court's decision, which --

11

excuse me -- the State court decision, joint appendix 143,

12

the State court makes very clear that it is in the process

13

of making its decision reviewing -- it calls it the health

14

insurance policy.

15

terms of the plan and construing the terms of the plan for

16

the purpose of determining what's the appropriate

17

restitution, what's the appropriate reimbursement.

18

It's not really that -- reviewing the

Our position is the State court had no

19

jurisdiction to do that unless they were doing so under a

20

claim brought by the respondents under 502(a)(1)(B), in

21

which case, of course, we could have removed that to

22

Federal court.

23

Not having done so, we also don't have a right

24

to go into State court and ask the State court to construe

25

that.

1

Now, one of the reasons why 502(a)(3) has to

2

give us a right to enforce the terms of the plan is

3

because we know the beneficiary has a right to do that.

4

Under 502(a)(1)(B), it can go into State court or Federal

5

court and enforce the terms of a plan, including to get

6

benefits and money.

7

Second, we ought to be able to go into a Federal

8

court and enforce the terms of the plan.

And the fact

9

that we get money shouldn't preclude us from doing that.

10

And finally, Congress requires us to go in and

11

enforce the terms of a plan under 404.

12

have uniformly said we're entitled to do that.

13

example -- a very clear contract case -- if an employer

14

fails to make the contributions to a plan, where is the

15

fiduciary going to get the authority to go and sue the

16

employer?

17

Under 502(a)(3)(A).

And indeed, courts
For

That is where they go.

So, there is no reason why -- Congress clearly

18

intended under 502(a)(3)(A), when you're enforcing the

19

terms of a plan, unlike as in Mertens where you were not

20

enforcing the terms of a plan, where you were not

MR. WOLFSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

5

I'd like to start with the point that was being

6

made by my colleague, which is that this is the only

7

mechanism by which a plan can enforce a term of the plan.

8

This is equitable relief under ERISA.

9

number of kinds of equitable relief are available.

It can be -- a
If not

10

a mandatory injunction, then the classic forms of

11

equitable relief, specific enforcement of the terms of a

12

plan --

13

QUESTION:

I've looked up every one of those,

14

and having looked up every one of them, our research so

15

far shows that there is no category, specific,

16

restitution, anything else, that this would count as

17

equitable because in each instance, they would have said

18

that there is an adequate remedy at law and there is no

19

basis for a constructive trust, because this is not funds

that come out of the trust.

ERISA itself does not provide for a claim of money

And it's very important to remember we're

So,

1

you could bring an injunction -- if a plan provided that

2

somebody would pay a lump amount of cash to the plan on a

3

certain day, you could bring an injunction to prevent that

4

person from failing to pay the lump amount of cash.

5

MR. WOLFSON:

Well, if -- if the plan provided

-- it's quite possible if the plan provided, for example,

7

that an employer would make a contribution to the plan, to

8

ensure that the plan was adequately funded, in the amount

9

of $1,000 a month and then the employer refused to do so,

10

it's difficult to believe Congress intended that there be

11

absolutely no remedy for enforcement of such a central

12

term of the plan which would be necessary to make sure

13

that the plan could continue in existence.

Well, but -- okay.

Why did -- why

did Congress limit the relief to the term equitable then?

that?

And there are

1

restitution, a constructive trust, or an equitable lien,

2

which might -- any number of which might be applied in

3

this case depending on who might be the appropriate

4

defendant or what -- what theory or where the money is and

5

so forth.

6

Now --

7

QUESTION:

But you're -- you're saying that

8

given the timing of the suit, this falls literally

9

squarely within subsection (A).

10

MR. WOLFSON:

At the timing of the suit, I think

11

there would have been -- there would have been no problem.

12

A prohibitory injunction would have very properly been

13

issued by the district court to prevent the funds in the

14

settlement from being disbursed in violation of the plan,

15

which is how (a)(3)(A) is framed.

16

And there is a res, by the way.

It may not be

17

money that came -- it may not be the exact same dollars

18

that came from the plan, but the settlement check and the

19

amounts that are derived from it are a res over which a

20

constructive trust might properly issue.

21

Another point about money coming from the plan.

22

In Harris Trust, the case that the Court decided a couple

23

of years ago, that was a claim -- an equitable claim for

24

restitution.

25

concluding that such an equitable claim would lie.

And the Court had no difficulty with

1

But I don't think anybody thought that Salomon

2

Brothers, which had participated in the fiduciary breach

3

-- I don't think anybody thought they were still holding

4

the same dollars that they had obtained by participating

5

in the breach of the fiduciary duty.

6

was a question of replacing those dollars, and that's --

7

and that's a proper application of the equitable remedy of

8

restitution.

9

QUESTION:

I mean, it was -- it

Mr. Wolfson, I -- I want to be clear

10

about the Government's position.

11

position is that if you're under (a)(3)(A), it must be a

classic equitable injunction that you're seeking?

13

MR. WOLFSON:

QUESTION:

The Government's

No.

Or rather, it doesn't matter?

in

15

which case, I don't know why you're going into all of

this.

Is the Government's position that under

18

(a)(3)(A) you can enjoin any act that is in violation of

19

commitments made under the plan?

I don't think it is limited by

(a)(3)(B) that says appropriate equitable relief.

25

would give out or not, you -- or courts have the power to

enjoin.

2

Is that right?
MR. WOLFSON:

Well, Justice Scalia, I don't

3

think Congress can simply declare that black is white.

I

4

mean, Congress cannot simply declare that something is an

5

injunction which isn't really an injunction.

6

But there is a question as to whether (a)(3)(A)

7

might be limited to prohibitory injunctions as opposed to

8

mandatory injunctions, but --

9

QUESTION:

10

Yes, because it says enjoin any act,

not -- not any failure to act.

11

MR. WOLFSON:

But -- but (3) -- but (3)(B)(ii)

12

also refers to enforcement of the term of the plan, and

13

that -- that is --

QUESTION:

Well, do you think -- do you think an

injunction can issue under (B)?

16

MR. WOLFSON:

(B) little -- (B)(ii), little

17

believe.

under that situation and then not --

MR. WOLFSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, I -- I wouldn't

the term of the plan very often might require an order in

the nature of specific enforcement of a plan that might

not fall -- if -- if (a)(3)(A) were limited to prohibitory

injunctions, I think (a)(3)(B) would be there to remain.

And as the Court pointed out -- made clear in Harris

13

MR. TARANTO:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

14

I'd like to summarize the three points I want to

15

make for why petitioners' money suit does not request

16

appropriate equitable relief and therefore is outside

17

18

My first point --

19

QUESTION:

May I just be sure you cover it

20

before you get through?

21

(a)(3)(A) and that (a)(3)(A) just gives the word enjoin a

22

very broad, non-historic meaning, according to my

23

hypothetical a second ago?

25

MR. TARANTO:

What about it being within

Why is that impossible?

other in -- in the -- the provision.

To -- to separate

1

the enjoin clause from the other appropriate equitable

2

relief I think does impossible violence to the

3

congressional specification that injunctions are a subset

4

of the appropriate equitable relief.

5

One practical consequence I think that would

6

follow from wrenching those apart would be that a plan

7

could write a liquidated damages or some other damages

8

provision into the plan and then seek an injunction for

9

payment of that money.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. TARANTO:

I don't think that that --

What would be so terrible about that?
Oh, I'm not sure that there would

12

be anything terrible, and I don't think there would be a

13

congressional -- I mean, I think Congress could call a

14

remedy anything it wants, subject to constitutional

15

constraints, for example, Seventh Amendment constraints,

16

and Seventh Amendment issues might well arise.

17
18

QUESTION:

How would you enforce a liquidated

damages provision, assuming a plan has one?

19

MR. TARANTO:

20

QUESTION:

I don't think one is enforceable.

So, there's a lot of stuff that's --

21

that's permissible under ERISA that is simply not

22

enforceable in courts.

23

MR. TARANTO:

I don't know how much.

Liquidated

24

damages -- I will make specific reference to another

25

provision of 502, which is 502(g).

But the limitations that Mertens I think

traditionally thought necessary one particular or one --

one subset of that relief and says this is all that's

It's

come from somebody else -- namely Hyundai, the third-

think need not be viewed as unavailable.

QUESTION:

Why -- why subrogee?

I think that

Because this to

me now I'm thinking, having listened to this, is a key

Why can't the plan simply bring an ordinary

contract action attaching the asset in State court?

MR. TARANTO:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. TARANTO:

That -- that --

Why does it have to be a subrogee?
Well, I think that this Court's

impossible, but make it more difficult.

QUESTION:

All right.

Now, are we dealing with

language in decisions that didn't focus on this

circumstance?

that Congress would not have wanted the plan to be able to

of the workers in plans.

its successors, have language in them that, taken all by

3

themselves, might suggest that any contract cause of

4

action on the same subject that is addressed in one of the

5

ERISA remedial provisions would be preempted.

6

those cases, in fact, involved requests for greater relief

7

than was made available, and that might well be a problem

8

for the kind of contract action you're talking about here.

9

If that relief is legal relief and it's covered by

Each of

10

502(a)(3) as a subject matter and Congress did not provide

11

for it, there is a fairly strong inference that that kind

12

of relief was relief that Congress did not want provided.

13

QUESTION:

Now, which -- which would be the

14

easier route?

15

wants the plan to be able to get its money back, legally

16

now is it more proper to say it's not preempted the State

17

court action, ordinary contract with attaching the assets?

18

Or is it more legally correct to say there is no State

19

court action; therefore, there is no adequate remedy at

20

law; therefore, an action close to restitution or specific

21

performance lies?

22

If I'm convinced that, of course, Congress

MR. TARANTO:

Well, I -- I don't think that it,

in the end, works to say that anytime equitable relief --

2

I do think the subrogation action presents a

much easier case, indeed a case that ought to fall outside

preemption law.

5

it has not been the case under the Labor Management

that, as petitioners' counsel said, every suit involving

interpretation of the plan is preempted, every State court

as an adjunct to a suit where the elements of liability

15

and the duties are determined otherwise.

QUESTION:

Mr. Taranto, what about the presence

17

of State subrogation laws where the State has a strong law

reflecting its policy that there shouldn't be any

subrogation actions in the State court?

20

MR. TARANTO:

Well, I -- I think that I would

21

agree with petitioners that the question of the plan's

22

rights are matters of Federal law, and I don't think it is

23

possible for a State to say an ERISA plan that does

24

provide in terms for subrogation, stepping into the shoes

of the beneficiary's tort claim -- I don't think a State

course, if -- if many State laws were not preempted.

16

I think for purposes of this case in addressing

the -- the concern about whether plans have recourse, a

very narrow question is presented, and that is whether

QUESTION:

It's very odd that you'd have a -- a

MR. TARANTO:

would be only in -- in State courts because there could be

requested that would fall under 502(a)(3).

14

There may be

My -- my point is that there is no reason to

15

distort what I think is the natural meaning of equitable

16

relief based on an admittedly serious concern that a plan

17

might not have recourse for money because I think the plan

18

does have recourse for money through bearing the burden of

19

pursuing that money against the tortfeasor, in which the

20

interpretation of the plan is ancillary and -- and

21

incidental just like at the very end of the Lingle against

3

QUESTION:

So too with

Mr. Taranto, you -- what you're

4

telling us then is that there would be no preemption in

5

this class of cases, that in this class of cases where the

6

plan insurer is saying we want to get from this recovery

7

the amount that we advanced, that in this class of cases

8

you would have an entirely Federal law governed claim that

9

could only be brought in State court.

10

I don't want to talk about the other claims that

11

you might have, but here where the plan insurance company

12

says, here's this tort recovery, we want our piece of it,

13

we want that restored, we want our advance restored to us,

14

for that category of case, you're telling us you have a

15

claim under Federal law that can be brought only in State

16

courts.

17

MR. TARANTO:

I -- I -- if I can say it slightly

18

-- slightly differently.

I think that the State tort law

19

is the claim -- creates a claim for negligence and any

20

damages caused by that.

21

think ought to be a matter of Federal common law which

22

probably just follows the terms of an ERISA plan, is say

23

that the plan can step into the shoes of the beneficiary's

24

rights under State law.

substantially.

And therefore, a principal worry about

QUESTION:

I -- I see that except for one point.

8

I don't see why you're going down the subrogation route,

9

which at least one of the amicus briefs suggests would

10

cause a lot of problems, rather than simply saying it's a

11

straight contract action under State court -- under State

12

law.

Why?

What's the -- you have a reason for doing it.

13

MR. TARANTO:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. TARANTO:

The -- the reason that I --

Is what?
-- that I have suggested is that

16

the contract action between the plan or its fiduciary,

17

which the cases have not treated as identical, but the

18

contract action against the -- against the beneficiary to

20

an awful lot like the subject matter covered directly by

requesting relief that could only really be legal relief,

23

there would be a much stronger preemption argument, a

QUESTION:

At which point you'd say that

We have the -- am I

I'm trying to -- it's a kind of circle, and I'm

MR. TARANTO:

I -- I think we're understanding

8

each other, and I -- and I can see the way out of the --

9

the stronger preemption argument as to -- as to that.

I

10

think the preemption argument as to the subrogation suit,

11

the ordinary tort suit, is much, much weaker to begin with

12

and therefore doesn't require as -- as strong a -- a

13

response.

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Taranto, can I ask you to respond

15

to an argument that occurs to me?

16

text of (a)(3), if you just had (a)(3)(A), I -- I think

17

you've agreed one could read that to just have a sort of a

18

statutory injunction that is divorced from prior equity

19

practice and just includes doing anything that is

20

necessary to comply with the plan.

21

that by saying, but (B) says other equitable relief, which

22

therefore has the effect of narrowing what otherwise might

23

be a permissible reading of (A).

1

QUESTION:

But my -- my -- the reason I'm

2

concerned about that response is it seems to me that (B)

3

was intended to broaden the remedies available rather than

4

to narrow them, and you're necessarily construing it as a

5

narrowing construction.

6

MR. TARANTO:

Well, I -- I think I'm construing

7

it in -- in two ways.

Perhaps as narrowing, but more

8

importantly as clarifying what otherwise would, I think,

9

be the more reasonable reading of (A), the enjoin clause,

10

even if there were nothing else.

11

reasonable reading would be injunctions as equity made

12

them available.

13

I think the more

When I read -- what your first comment said, if

14

all that was there was the enjoin language, I think that

15

language by itself might be taken to mean enjoin any

16

violation of the terms of the plan.

17

that would be the better reading even without the language

18

that follows, but I think the language that follows

19

compels adoption of that because it characterizes as

20

equitable relief the injunctions provided for in the first

21

clause.

22

QUESTION:

I don't think that

Is there any legislative history

23

indicating why Congress limited the relief which it

24

permitted in this section to equitable relief?

25

MR. TARANTO:

I'm not aware of any.

I -- I have

1

reviewed the -- the legislative history, the collective

three-volume legislative history, and as I think some of

3

this Court's decisions have -- have indicated, some of the

earlier bills contained broader relief provisions, legal

that at least I don't recall having seen.

7

In -- in the one reference to -- which I cited

8

in -- in my brief I think at page 27 -- in one of the

9

Senate reports that discusses the immediate predecessor of

10

this provision, there's no general reference to any kind

of relief that's necessary to -- to make plans protect all

of their rights or vice versa.

14

It's been principally a

And there's also no general reference to

restitution in the abstract.

There's a reference to

injunctions and specifically to constructive trusts.

17

even there, there isn't a general idea that anytime we're

18

talking about what sometimes are called direct damages or

19

general damages or contractual damages, and therefore

20

making whole the loser of a particular sum of money that's

It has several times said we are not deciding that and

have not decided that.

16

Let me -- let me try to answer
This Court has never said that for

The courts of appeals have, for many years, in

17

But if you look back at the original

18

decisions that so held back in the 1960's, they all rested

19

on something that is suggested directly by the language of

20

title 7, which is not that back pay standing alone is

equitable and therefore outside the jury trial right, but

that equity always had the power to award money when

think this is correct -- the Fair Labor Standards Act and

under title 7, a monetary remedy without any

9

MR. TARANTO:

And -- and I agree that the courts

of appeals have, for a long time, treated that as outside

10

the jury trial right, but this Court has never said so.

11

And perhaps more importantly as a matter of congressional

12

intent, there's no reason to think that Congress in 1974,

13

when writing the ERISA provision, was adopting any

14

specialized meaning of equitable relief that Congress may

15

have had in mind in -- in the title 7 context.

16

QUESTION:

Well, why wasn't there a reason given

17

-- the limitations on the plan's ability to sue elsewhere?

18

And as Justice Stevens and Justice Ginsburg's line of

19

questioning suggests, it seems to me that if (A) and (B)

20

are both going to do some work in the statute, that to

21

insist that (A) simply embodies the historic definition of

22

equity is -- is too narrow.

illustration of why it doesn't make much sense to separate
