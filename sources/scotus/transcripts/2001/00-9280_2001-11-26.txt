ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID I. BRUCK

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. BRUCK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
For the second time this year, the Court

12

considers today South Carolina's compliance with your

13

decision in Simmons v. South Carolina.

14

time is -- is the interpretation, if you will, the South

15

Carolina Supreme Court has placed upon the future

16

dangerousness requirement of the Simmons decision,

17

specifically whether, as the South Carolina Supreme Court

18

put it, future dangerousness was neither a logical

19

inference from the evidence nor was it injected into this

20

case through the State's closing argument.

21

QUESTION:

The issue this

Well, in -- in some sense -- and this

22

is what concerns me about your argument -- I -- I suppose

23

at some level future dangerousness is -- is always

24

inferable from the fact of -- of a horrible crime.

25

MR. BRUCK:

I -- I think it is true that -- that

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

when a person is convicted beyond a reasonable doubt of an

2

aggravated, death-eligible murder, it is -- it does not

3

take very much more to put the issue of future

4

dangerousness at issue.

5

particularly suggest the example of an intrafamilial --

6

that is, the murder of children by their mother where the

7

person with no prior record and no likelihood that the

8

situation will recur, where future dangerousness simply

9

does not sound from the evidence.

You can conceive of crimes -- I

10

However, in -- there are also --

11

QUESTION:

We -- we are the ones that -- that

12

gave you this -- this category of future dangerousness.

13

And it either makes sense or it doesn't.

14

something defensible about the category, it -- it seems to

15

me that there would be a significant number of cases in

16

which it doesn't apply.

17

your argument.

18

That's another point.

19

If -- if there's

I -- I just don't see that from

Now, maybe the category is unworkable.

MR. BRUCK:

Well, I should say that future

20

dangerousness is not likely to be at issue in -- in cases

21

where State law does not provide the jury the freedom to

22

consider it.

23

weighing statute in which the jury has clearly said these

24

are the -- or is clearly told, these are the factors that

25

go on death side of the scale and nothing more -- only you

If aggravation was clearly limited in a

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

can think of a way in which the prosecution could try a

2

case in a way that clearly conveyed the message to the

3

jury that --

4

QUESTION:

Well, how many States that use the

5

death penalty allow future dangerousness as a factor in

6

sentencing?
MR. BRUCK:

7

You know, I don't have an exact

8

number.

My sense is that a small minority have it as a

9

statutory aggravating factor, such as Texas, Virginia, and

10

Oregon, and a much larger number like Georgia, South

11

Carolina allow it along with a myriad of other sentencing

12

factors without it ever needing to be explicitly

13

mentioned.

14

I would guess --

15

These are the so-called non-weighing States.

QUESTION:

Well, that is the concern, of course,

16

is if -- whether this concept is something that is going

17

to have to be applied in every capital sentencing case or

18

whether there's some limitation.

19

MR. BRUCK:

20

QUESTION:

21

argument the answer to that.

22

MR. BRUCK:

Well -And it's hard to know from your

Yes.

Can you draw a line?
I would say where the evidence

23

does not sound in future dangerousness and where the

24

prosecution does not advance the jury's consideration of

25

future dangerousness.

For example, in this case, you

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

know, on these facts, of course, none of this is

2

implicated.

3

Simmons.

4

it would include this case because you have an onslaught

5

of future dangerousness argument.

6

of classic future dangerousness evidence presented --

This is simply Simmons.

Even if we were to limit Simmons to its facts,

QUESTION:

7

This is within

You have an onslaught

Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

You

8

say evidence sounds in future dangerousness.

What -- what

9

evidence that -- that is introduced at -- you know, at the

10

-- at the sentencing phase that this is a horrible person

11

would -- would not sound in future dangerousness?

12

trying to show that this is a horrible person, that he

13

deserves the death penalty.

14

wouldn't sound in future dangerousness?
MR. BRUCK:

15

You're

What kind of evidence

Well, for example, the prosecutor

16

here took on the issue of the fact that this young man was

17

only 17 years old, and his -- and had no prior record,

18

both very substantial mitigating factors.

19

response was that actually the very fact that he had no

20

prior record, the prosecutor said, makes him more

21

frightening than a serial killer, more frightening than a

22

career criminal, which is all future dangerousness

23

rhetoric.

24

One is not frightened by things that have already

25

happened, but things that might happen in the future.

And the

Frightening means looking toward the future.

QUESTION:

statement of -- of the prosecutor --

MR. BRUCK:

QUESTION:

5

frightening.

6

dangerousness.

Yes, in part.
-- on his use of the word

And in another place, he does use the term

7

MR. BRUCK:

8

QUESTION:

9

Now -- now, you're relying on the

Yes, he does.
Now, that's one thing if you want to

-- and -- and we -- we can discuss that.

But -- but I'm

10

more concerned about your broader point that when the

11

evidence, as you put it, sounds -- I'm not sure it's the

12

proper use of sounds, but when the evidence, as you put

13

it, sounds in future dangerousness, we have to -- it -- it

14

is constitutionally required that you -- you have the

15

instruction about no parole.

16

MR. BRUCK:

Well, I mean, we should recall that

17

-- that -- I mean, one can say, well, these are just the

18

facts of the crime.

19

about what evidence it wants to present, and when it

20

presents evidence that is reasonably likely or, in this

21

case, virtually certain to cause the jury to consider the

22

-- the elemental sentencing issue that a judge considers

23

in almost every case, will he do it again, then --

24
25

QUESTION:

The State has enormous discretion

That will always be the case.

You --

you are asking for a rule that -- that will cover every

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

capital case.

I cannot imagine a capital case where --

2

where the prosecution does not, at the sentencing phase,

3

put in evidence that makes this look like a horrible

4

person, hence, a dangerous person.

5

know, I just don't know that we're prepared to go that

6

far.

And -- and I -- you

Which leads me to what words -- what are the

7
8

magic words that you want the prosecution not to be able

9

to use.

10

Frightening is one magic word.

Right?

Dangerous

is another magic word.

11

MR. BRUCK:

12

QUESTION:

It most certainly is.
Okay.

I mean, we can just have a

13

list of magic words that prosecutors shouldn't use from

14

now on.

15

MR. BRUCK:

I think there would be no harm,

16

although this case provides absolutely no occasion to

17

consider the issue, in dispensing with the future

18

dangerousness requirement for precisely that reason, that

19

when -- that it is -- there are so few cases in which the

20

jury is not likely, in the privacy of the jury room, to

21

ask the question, what if he gets out and does it again?

22

This comes up in case after case.

23

weighing the -- the State -- I mean, is there a danger

24

that the Simmons rule might then be applied in cases where

25

it truly does not rebut something that the jury --

And there's a -- in

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

occasionally in the rare case, yes.
But in considering the equities, I think it's

3

worth keeping in mind that there is unfairness not only on

4

the issue of future dangerousness from this situation.

5

There is also unfairness in the retributive function that

6

the jury must suffer, and this is not in this case.

7

may be more of an Eighth Amendment claim, but I think in

8

weighing the risk of unfairness to the two sides, it's

9

worth keeping in mind that life without parole is a much

It

10

more severe punishment.

11

is life with parole.

12

the moment it is imposed, not only 30 or 40 years hence.

13

And the reason is that life without parole means life

14

without hope.

15

It is much more retributive than

And it is -- it is more severe from

And anyone -- I -- I try these cases and -- and

16

negotiate plea bargains in these cases at the trial level,

17

and I can tell you that there is nothing that cuts the ice

18

faster with the victim's family, with the prosecutor in

19

settling a case than life without parole not because of

20

the dangerousness, but because of its retributive effect.

21

And there's something terribly unfair at -- when everyone

22

in the courtroom knows how crushing this penalty is, this

23

penalty of life without hope, except the jury, and they

24

are left to think that their option is to let this man

25

hope that some day he'll be out raising a family and

working at a job and -- and pretending to be a respectable

2

member of the community when it isn't so.

QUESTION:

4

MR. BRUCK:

You're asking us to overrule Simmons.
No, by no means.

This case -- all I

5

am saying is that if it is true, as my friend claims, that

6

our category of cases in these non-weighing jurisdictions,

7

where the jury is given free rein to consider everything,

8

that our category of non-dangerousness cases is actually

9

so small as to be nonexistent, then in those States at

10

least I think it would be fair.

11

saying -QUESTION:

12

And there is no harm in

But that isn't the question you

13

presented in your petition.

14

petition was, was the ruling of the Supreme Court of South

15

Carolina in this case contrary to Simmons?
MR. BRUCK:

16

All you presented in your

Well, that's right because I

17

represent a client and all my client requires is that

18

Simmons be applied.

19

fairly be described as something approaching defiance of

20

your -- of your decision in Simmons when a record like

21

this is -- is found not to raise future dangerousness.

22

The only thing that State can come up with that they

23

didn't do is to call Dr. Grigson, some psychiatrist, to

24

say --

25

QUESTION:

We have something that I think can

Well, for the reasons that we've

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

indicated in our questions, I -- I don't think it's

2

defiance.

3

careful not to raise future dangerous explicitly because

4

it doesn't want the jury to know this.

I -- I do think the prosecution is being pretty

5

MR. BRUCK:

Yes.

6

QUESTION:

7

But given the state of our law, future

And it makes it a little troublesome

8

dangerousness has to be put in issue, and as we -- as

9

we've indicated, I -- I think under -- under your rule

10

that would be an issue in almost every case.
Let me ask you this.

11

You've heard me ask it

12

here before.

I -- I take it that if this instruction were

13

given, either the trial judge relented or future

14

dangerousness was at issue, it's perfectly open to the

15

State to say, now -- now, you may think this prisoner has

16

no hope, but the legislature can change this tomorrow

17

morning.

18

parole rule, and this prisoner -- this defendant can be

19

out in the community, once again a danger.

Tomorrow morning the legislature can change the

20

MR. BRUCK:

21

QUESTION:

22
23

Well, I think that -I take it that would be a fair

argument?
MR. BRUCK:

I don't think it would be for a

24

separate reason, which is it invites the -- the jury to

25

treat the law under which this person is being sentenced

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

as in effect nonexistent.

2

death because that can't be changed.

3

QUESTION:

The only thing that's real is

Yes, but -- but the certainty that

4

life without parole will confine him indefinitely is much

5

less than that execution will kill him.

6

MR. BRUCK:

That's true.

That's true.

But when

7

-- when a court -- I mean, a jury doesn't need to be told

8

that all manmade law is subject to being changed by man.

9

That is something that we all know.

Jurors know that,

10

that this law was enacted by the legislature and can be

11

changed --

12
13
14
15
16

QUESTION:

Well, would you allow the prosecutor

to argue it if you were the trial judge?
MR. BRUCK:

No, I would not because to invite

the jury to -QUESTION:

So, you're saying that the jury

17

doesn't need to be told what it already knows, but that's

18

inconsistent with your whole position.

19

MR. BRUCK:

No.

All I'm -- all I'm saying is

20

that the jury should not be invited to speculate that all

21

the law that it is being told to apply will melt away and

22

cannot be relied on and thus should be ignored.

23

the jury ceases really to become a jury that applies the

24

law of the State and becomes just a pack of --

25

QUESTION:

And then

I thought your position -- I thought

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

your position was that this -- that the judge or the

2

lawyer reads the text of what it says in the South

3

Carolina law.

MR. BRUCK:

QUESTION:

6

legislature enacted.

MR. BRUCK:

QUESTION:

9

MR. BRUCK:

Exactly.
Reads word for word what the

That is exactly correct.
And that's all you're asking.
That's all we're asking.

10

know, my -- my submission --

11

QUESTION:

Wait.

And, you

Whether -- whether we should

12

allow that to happen depends on, you know, how fair it is

13

to the prosecution and why shouldn't the prosecution be

14

able to point out the reality that that's what the

15

legislature has said today and it can change that

16

tomorrow?

17

be -- to be treated openly and honestly, I don't see how

18

you can just -- just say put in the one side and not the

19

other.

20

So, if you really want future dangerousness to

MR. BRUCK:

Well, I have to say my case does not

21

turn on the answer to that question.

That could be

22

decided either way, as this case is reversed, because

23

that's not an issue in this case.

24

become the stuff of future appeals to this Court from the

25

only two States that see any issue left here, Pennsylvania

It certainly would

and South Carolina.

QUESTION:

3

every other State that has capital punishment --

4

MR. BRUCK:

5

QUESTION:

6
7

In all the other States, in -- in

Yes.
-- this instruction is given as a

matter of course?
MR. BRUCK:

Regardless of any absence or

8

presence or alleged absence of future dangerousness.

9

other words, every State but South Carolina and

In

10

Pennsylvania already go beyond Simmons, and these are the

11

only two outliers in which the record is combed for

12

whether or not future dangerousness is at issue.

13

Now, as I say --

14

QUESTION:

When you say it's outliers, but once

15

again that's the -- that's the dichotomy that this Court

16

set forth in -- in Simmons and in our past opinions.

17

MR. BRUCK:

Well, yes.

The -- it's true that --

18

that Simmons set a constitutional minimum rule and it

19

required future dangerousness to be at issue.

20

are a great many -- in a -- in a non-weighing

21

jurisdiction, there are a great many ways of putting

22

future dangerousness at issue.

23

Court has held in Simmons itself, by argument.

24

done, as is never done in South Carolina, by instruction

25

to the Court, because it's not a statutory factor.

And there

It can be done, as the
It can be

Or it

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

can -- as the State agrees and as the South Carolina

2

Supreme Court acknowledges, it can be done solely by

3

evidence without argument by the solicitor.

4

QUESTION:

But what about the argument that

5

everything that goes to future dangerousness also goes to

6

something else?

7

this was a terrible person because he had no prior record,

8

and I used the Billy the Kid remark because -- to rebut

9

the age.

10
11

The prosecutor said, yes, I showed that

So, I can give you a reason, other than future

dangerousness, for everything that I put in.
MR. BRUCK:

Well, it's -- it's -- there's very

12

little evidence of future dangerousness and very little

13

argument that cannot also be given a retributive

14

interpretation, which is what the State has labored to do

15

in their brief.

16

And if all that -- it's striking that the State

17

is not at all satisfied with the test stated by the South

18

Carolina Supreme Court, which is whether the issue was

19

argued or whether future dangerousness is a logical

20

inference from the evidence.

21

evidence is -- raises an issue of future dangerousness is

22

that the evidence must only raise future dangerousness and

23

must raise nothing but future dangerousness.

24
25

The State's test for whether

Now, it's rather hard.

The only example, as I

say, they can think of is a psychiatric opinion that the

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

man will kill again.

2

that triggers Simmons under the Attorney General's view.
QUESTION:

3
4

Apparently that's the only evidence

So what?

What's so -- what's so

absurd about that?

5

MR. BRUCK:

6

QUESTION:

Because it ain't so.
What is so absurd about that?

If

7

Simmons meant anything, it seems to me that's what Simmons

8

meant, or otherwise it -- it -- you know, it's virtually

9

worthless.
MR. BRUCK:

10

Well, there was no psychiatric

11

opinion introduced by the State in Simmons itself.

12

was nothing but a metaphorical argument that two members

13

of the Court didn't think raised future dangerousness at

14

all.

15

There

But it was this idea of self-defense in response

16

to someone who was a threat.

17

argument about retribution, and as the dissenting opinion

18

in -- in Simmons pointed out, that -- you could certainly

19

see the retributive meaning, significance, that the

20

prosecutor meant there.

21

That -- that was also an

But it also -- it also raised the issue of

22

future dangerousness, and that was all in Simmons.

23

that was enough.

24

case would require -- would require reversing Simmons.

25

And

And that's why I say that to affirm this

One has to weigh, too -- I mean, you know, the

16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

State argues this issue as if we are keeping them from

2

introducing evidence, and we are doing something unfair or

3

we're saying they can't do this, they can't do that.

4

don't say the State can't do anything.

5

when they make an argument like they made in this case --

6

he's quick-witted, doesn't that make someone a little more

7

dangerous, calling the defendant Billy the Kid, Bloody

8

Billy, the Butcher of Batesburg, and on and on and on and

9

on and on -- that we be able to answer it by saying how

We

All we say is that

10

the legislature has defined life imprisonment for the

11

people of South Carolina.

12

These jurors are the same voters that demanded

13

that life imprisonment be -- be enacted, and now that it

14

has been enacted, what can be fair about keeping the

15

defendant from telling the jury, even if all this that the

16

prosecutor says about me is true, I will never be released

17

again?

18

Now, the -- the State also acknowledges, both

19

the State Supreme Court and the Attorney General, that

20

future dangerousness was raised in this case.

21

no bones about that.

22

a special way that does not implicate Simmons.

23

did was we introduced evidence that not even the Lexington

24

County jail could keep this man from being nonviolent, and

25

that is future dangerousness.

They make

But they say, well, we raised it in

He's going to be a

inference.

If I were a juror and I heard about this

evidence, I'd say my principal focus would be on the

MR. BRUCK:

That -- as I say, the -- the

2

evidence has two meanings and that is one of them.

3

don't quarrel with that.

4

he is -QUESTION:

5

We

But at the same time, if -- if

Well, then you can't say it defies

6

all logic, et cetera, et cetera.

7

that's the -- the most direct conclusion that -- that

8

should follow from the prosecution's evidence on this

9

point.

10

It seems to me that

He's dangerous in prison.
MR. BRUCK:

Even if it is the most direct, how

11

can we say that it does not also prove that if you let him

12

out on parole, he'll be even more dangerous?

13

QUESTION:

But that isn't what Simmons said.

I

14

thought the rule of Simmons was -- was a rule of fairness.

15

Look, prosecution, if you're going to argue that this man

16

should be executed because it -- he will be dangerous to

17

society if he's -- if he's let out, then, for Pete's sake,

18

you have to let the jury know that he won't be let out.

19

It's an unfair argument for the prosecution to say he'll

20

be dangerous to society unless you execute him, when the

21

prosecution knows that he'll never get out.

22

MR. BRUCK:

23

QUESTION:

Right.
But this is far beyond that.

This

24

has nothing to do with such an unfair argument by the

25

prosecution.

He's not saying don't let this person go

19
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

because he'll be praying on society.

2

nothing approaching that argument.

3

MR. BRUCK:

There's -- there's

Well, I think it -- it -- what we

4

have here is a prosecutor who has Simmons and who knows

5

that if he wants to hide from the jury -- you see, the

6

prosecution agrees with us about -- and this is, in a way,

7

what is most disturbing and troubling about this case.

8

the prosecution did not believe, based on their evidence

9

and their argument, that this jury was thinking about

10

future dangerousness to society, why would they care?

11

What possible harm could there be from a Simmons

12

instruction?

13

If

I think the prosecution entirely agrees with us

14

on the importance of this and on the dynamics of jury

15

deliberation in a case where a -- where the -- where the

16

State's evidence and the argument is of this nature.

17

know perfectly well what any practicing lawyer who tries

18

these cases on either side knows, which is that this jury

19

goes back in the jury room, after having seen and heard

20

all of this, and thinks one thing for sure:

21

make sure he doesn't do it again.

22

constitutional fact, established by the Simmons case,

23

that's -- that part of that is parole, the jury's

misconception about parole, because we've had parole for

1

phenomenon in this country.
QUESTION:

2

But this -- this is not a case, is

3

it, in -- where the trial judge put any limitation on the

4

defense attorney's arguing this point or where the jury

5

came back with a question.

6

cases.
MR. BRUCK:

7
8

Right.

This is not one of those

For all we know, the jury

knew there was parole, wrongly.

And no limitation.

But I have to say -- and the State has not

9
10

claimed that in the face of this argument on instructions,

11

that the lawyer -- the defense attorney should have picked

12

up a statute book and read to the jury the instruction

13

that the judge had just refused to give.

14

had her head handed to her on a plate if she had done

15

that.

16

legal principle has been ruled out of a case, a lawyer

17

cannot then attempt to charge the jury anyway.

18

is not an argument you'll find in the State's case.

19

She would have

That is not permitted in South Carolina.

When a

And that

They do say that her -- her rhetorical claim or

20

-- or co-counsel's claim that you'll never see the light

21

of day should be deemed as the equivalent of a no-parole

22

instruction, but you dealt with that and disposed of that

23

argument in Shafer, where a much more explicit argument

24

was held not to be the equivalent of an instruction on --

25

on State law concerning parole.

So, I think that -- that

21
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

argument has absolutely nothing to commend it and is -- is

2

directly controlled, I would submit, by -- by Shafer.

3

QUESTION:

But Shafer was explicit that counsel

4

would not be allowed to read the statute, which is what I

5

think counsel wanted to do.

6

MR. BRUCK:

Well, that's right.

But you know,

7

it -- a lawyer doesn't, under South Carolina practice,

8

need to ask the court whether an instruction that has been

9

ruled out of the case -- whether it's okay for her to read

10
11

it to the jury.

We know that that is not permissible.

I should add, too, that -- that the trial judge

12

instructed the jury in this case that he is the sole

13

instructor on the facts.

14

said, as -- I am as judge the sole -- made the sole and

15

only instructor in the law.

16

know, how trials in South Carolina are conducted.

17

do not instruct.

18

At page 618 of the record, he

And so -- and that's, you
Lawyers

I realize as a matter of constitutional law, if

19

it were -- if there were a way for defense counsel to have

20

done that, despite the -- the court's ruling, it would

21

have sufficed under Simmons, but there was no such way,

22

and that's why the State makes no such argument in their

23

-- in their brief.

24

passed up by defense counsel to instruct on the law.

25

-- there wasn't any such -- any such opportunity, and

This is not where an opportunity was
This

1

that's why the -- the argument is so vague and so

2

unsatisfactory under -- under Shafer v. -- v. South

3

Carolina.

4

If this is enough to get around Simmons and to

5

allow prosecutors to keep juries from knowing what the

6

South Carolina legislature has done with respect to the

7

abolition of parole, then you will see, as you already are

8

seeing, case after case from South Carolina in which the

9

envelope is constantly being pushed further and further

10

back in what, I have to submit, is a somewhat manipulative

11

effort to get the advantage of the jury's misconceptions,

12

to get the advantage of the false dilemma that Simmons

13

correctly identified in order to get more death sentences

14

than are actually merited by the law and the evidence in

15

each case.

16

As I say, this is the second time that -- that

17

South Carolina has -- South Carolina's compliance with

18

Simmons has been before this Court in this calendar year.

19

There probably won't be another one this calendar year,

20

but there will be a continuing procession.

21

the first case in line will be Shafer v. South Carolina,

22

which was remanded for reconsideration of the -- for

dangerousness.

Mr. Waters, we'll hear from you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF S. CREIGHTON WATERS

3

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

4
5

MR. WATERS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

6

In Simmons v. South Carolina, a limited due

7

process exception was crafted to the general rule in

8

California v. Ramos that it was for the States to decide

9

whether to inform the juries on matters of parole or other

10

early release.

And the issue in this case is what

11

argument and evidentiary submissions are sufficient to --

12

for the prosecution to have been deemed to raise future

13

dangerousness such that due process overcomes that State

14

law rule.
And petitioner in this case contends that future

15
16

dangerousness can be raised simply by the gruesome facts

17

of the crime, by misbehavior in jail, by a prior criminal

18

record.

19

been discussed, a virtually standardless test and would

20

conflict with this Court's statements of the Simmons rule,

21

as well as the subsequent interpretation of the rule by

22

many other courts.

23

prosecutor must specifically rely on future dangerousness

24

to society as a basis for death.

25

And, of course, that would create, as has already

And that is, of course, that a

And, of course, that -- the reason for that is

25
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the rationale of Simmons itself, which is a due process

2

right of rebuttal.

3

dangerousness requirement is necessary to that due process

4

right of rebuttal, and obviously, in order to have the

5

right to rebut something, the other party must have first

6

done something to affirmatively raise that issue.

Future dangerousness -- a future

7

Now, admittedly some --

8

QUESTION:

9
10

Mr. Waters, in -- in your view has

any South Carolina prosecutor since Simmons used words
that would invoke that case?

11

MR. WATERS:

12

QUESTION:

Invoke Simmons itself?
Yes.

It seems to me that any

13

prosecutor, if your argument is right, can easily get

14

around Simmons simply by not using the words future

15

dangerousness and saying, well, this is relevant to

16

something else.

17

MR. WATERS:

Well, I think, you know, our State

18

Supreme Court has on two occasions ruled that Simmons was

19

violated, and in that case, the -- the prosecutor argued

20

that, you know, he's shown that he cannot live inside or

21

outside of prison.

So, clearly that crosses the line.

22

I think, you know, the -- the fundamental --

23

QUESTION:

24
25

I thought your position was if he

couldn't live in prison, then Simmons was out.
MR. WATERS:

Well, in that particular case, he

26
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

said both outside of society and inside prison in that

2

particular case.

3

court case.

4

occasions ruled that.

5

That's State v. Timothy Rogers, a State

So, our court has on -- on a couple of

QUESTION:

I mean, obviously -You -- you then concede that if the

6

-- if the argument that counsel for the -- the prosecutor

7

makes is this man is dangerous in or out of prison, in

8

that case a Simmons instruction is warranted.

9

MR. WATERS:

I think that by incorporating the

10

outside society aspect of the argument, our State Supreme

11

Court has already ruled that and I'm not here to -- to

12

challenge that.

13

QUESTION:

I understood Justice Ginsburg's

14

question -- and I'm interested in it too -- as can you

15

tell us, as a matter of practice, are there instances in

16

where the Simmons rule is followed in South Carolina and

17

the jury is instructed about parole because of future

18

dangerous being an issue, or as Justice Ginsburg

19

suggested, is it the common pattern and practice for

20

prosecution -- for the prosecutor to stay away from this?

21

MR. WATERS:

No.

There are plenty of instances

22

where -- where solicitors argue future dangerousness to

23

society, and a life without parole instruction is given.

24

There -- it -- it ultimately boils down to what the

25

prosecutor does in his argument and how the trial judge

27
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

rules on -- on what was raised in -- in that trial.

2

it does happen.
QUESTION:

3

Don't you have that here?

But

I mean,

4

the argument here was not only the -- the Bloody Billy,

5

the Butcher of whatever it was, but the words dangerous

6

were used I think -- I think twice to describe him in the

7

argument, once at least.

8

the -- the statement to the jurors, I hope you never have

9

to be in the position again of being 30 -- 30 feet away

And -- and the argument included

10

from this kind of -- of a killer.

11

going to be spending time in prison, and I -- I don't know

12

why that argument means anything other than I hope this

13

guy is not going to be out where you are going to be and

14

find you as close to him again.

15

raised it even on -- on your criteria?
MR. WATERS:

16

Well, the jurors aren't

So, hasn't -- hasn't he

I don't believe so in this case.

17

think if you focus on the prosecutor's argument as a

18

whole, it's clear that the majority of his argument was

19

retributive.

And we would assert --

QUESTION:

20

Well, I'm not talking about -- I

21

mean, you -- the majority of the argument isn't even the

22

criterion that you are arguing for.

23

got to raise it on my theory.

24

argument that this person will be dangerous on the

25

outside.

You said, look, he's

He's got to raise it as an

And I assume if he does that once, that's

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

I

1

sufficient on your theory.

2

even on your theory, didn't he do it here?

3

MR. WATERS:

And my question is, didn't --

Well, with regard to the dangerous

4

comment, what the solicitor said in that particular case

5

was -- he said, well, the evidence here is that he's

6

quick-witted, he's not retarded.

7

evidence in this case also was that petitioner was a close

8

friend of -- or the petitioner's family was a close friend

9

of this victim.

And of course, the

He used to work with the victim, and that

10

he used that familiarity with the victim to make her more

11

vulnerable.

12

QUESTION:

Well, what -- what about the 30 feet?

13

I hope you're never in this position again.

14

that argument?

15

no sense except on the assumption that this person might

16

-- the defendant might be outside?

17

What about

I mean, isn't that an argument that makes

MR. WATERS:

That -- that particular argument

18

was -- was made at -- at the beginning of the sentencing

19

phase in opening statement.

20

don't think that that --

21
22
23

QUESTION:

It was a brief reference.

I

I mean, it was made to the jurors.

They heard it, didn't they?
MR. WATERS:

They did hear that, but I think if

24

you read it in context, it was more of the case of you

25

just committed -- convicted this guy of a horrible crime.

29
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

You have a tough job ahead of you, and I hope you never

2

have to do this again.

3

isolated passage, when read in the context of what the

4

solicitor was saying there, would not have such -- been

5

such as to necessarily flag the future dangerousness issue

6

in the mind.
QUESTION:

7
8

I -- I think that -- that brief,

So, if -- if the prosecutor had

closed his argument with that, that would have sufficed.
MR. WATERS:

9

I'm not -- I don't know if I would

10

say that much.

11

and it was just a brief reference in opening statement,

12

and I don't think that that -- that can be pointed to as

13

to have crossed that line because I don't really think he

14

used it for that inference, that you know, this -- you

15

know, this guy is going to be dangerous to you.

16

more saying, you know, you just convicted this guy of the

17

most horrible, bloodiest crime you can imagine, and he's a

18

horrible person, and now you've got one more tough job to

19

do.

20

I think that was the point of his argument, not that this

21

guy --

22

I just point out that it was very early

He was

And I hope you never have to go through this again.

QUESTION:

He didn't -- my -- my -- you correct

23

me if I'm wrong, because I don't have the transcript in

24

front of me, but my recollection is he didn't say, I hope

25

you don't have to go through this again.

He said, I hope

30
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

you're -- you know, you're not in this position of being

2

30 feet away from this kind of a person again, which is I

3

think quite different.

4

MR. WATERS:

Well, he -- he did not say, I hope

5

you don't have to go through that, but I think if you read

6

his argument, that was the point of it, and I think in

7

context, that's the obvious point of it rather than future

8

dangerousness.

9

QUESTION:

May I ask this?

You gave us a couple

10

of examples of the South Carolina Supreme Court itself

11

setting aside the conviction -- or executions because they

12

had failed to give the instruction.

13

just quoted the example he mentioned both inside and

14

outside prison.

15

And you -- you've

Now, did they consider the -- your argument that

16

if read in the context of the entire argument, it -- it

17

was a featured part of the argument, or did they -- could

18

the -- could one reasonably think that from those

19

opinions, just that mere mention was enough?

20

MR. WATERS:

In that -- in that particular case,

21

the solicitor focused much of his argument on that.

He

22

said, this -- this defendant has shown by his prior

23

record, because the defendant had had prior incarcerations

24

and prior releases -- he's shown by his prior record that

25

he cannot exist safely both inside prison and outside

Alderson Reporting Company

1

society.

2

think it was focused on in that case, and it was a direct

3

statement of outside society.

4

So, I would concede that crosses the line.

I

And I -- I don't want to get into magic words,

5

but I think when you say outside society, when he clearly

6

focuses, that -- that would be a magic word triggering

7

Simmons.
QUESTION:

8
9

in part on how much the issue was emphasized in the

10

argument.

11

would not be enough.

12

But you would draw a line depending

Not just an isolated comment, for example,

MR. WATERS:

What I'm saying is that if there's

13

an isolated comment in the context of an -- of an argument

14

that focuses on retribution, that -- it's kind of a

15

Donnelly v. DeChristoforo principle, that you shouldn't

16

assume that the prosecutor intended to worst meaning from

17

that, and you shouldn't assume that the jury necessarily

18

took the worst meaning from that.

19

saying -- I'm just saying that the context does matter,

20

and -- and that's essentially what we have here.

21

And -- and so, I'm not

In Simmons, you know, we had a -- the more

22

egregious situation.

We had the prosecutor say, jury, you

to a threat, society's response.

25

3

far as to say his own expert calls him dangerous and had

brought that out in cross examination.

5

that here.

6

through a technical parsing of the argument.

The prosecutor even went on -- so

There's none of

All they can do in this case is -- is go

QUESTION:

7

The death penalty will be an

Well, why shouldn't -- why shouldn't

8

it be?

Why isn't it fundamentally unfair in every capital

9

case, after all, not to give the instruction that the

10

alternative is life without parole?

11

jury who knows it has a murderer in front of it.

12

trying to decide among all alternative punishments.

13

is the worst, and then the State won't tell them what the

14

alternative is.

15

decided that is unfair.

16

isn't it as unfair a thing just about as one can imagine

17

to tell the jury you have to give life or something else

18

and then not tell them what the something else is,

19

particularly when they're likely to think he'll be out

MR. WATERS:

And why, to go back to basics,

Well, I think the jury in this case

22

-- you know, they are told life imprisonment, and they're

23

never told that there's any possibility of --

24
25

QUESTION:

But sitting -- in your experience,

wouldn't you say most jurors are sitting there thinking

33
Alderson Reporting Company

1

that life doesn't mean life?
MR. WATERS:

2

Well, I -- I'm not sure that that's

3

necessarily true.

4

was a 1986 case in South Carolina, there was a voir dire

5

of the jury on that, and most of the jurors said, we

6

thought it meant, you know, he'll never get out.

7

mean, there's conflicting evidence on that.

8

Court has repeatedly referred to the fact that it -- it is

9

new event and many jurors may not know, but I don't know

10

I mean, in State v. Patterson, which

So, I

I know this

if that's necessarily the case.

11

As a matter of fundamental fairness, we're

12

still talking about, to some degree, deference to the

13

States.

And -- and so -QUESTION:

14

What does deference to the State got

15

to do with fundamental fairness?

16

entirely different argument.

It seems to me that's an

17

The fundamental fairness question that Justice

18

Breyer is raising is in a context in which it may or may

19

not be debated as to whether jurors know instinctively

20

that life really means life, doesn't fundamental fairness

21

require that they be instructed unequivocally so that they

22

know the terms within which they must act in coming to a

23

verdict.

24
25

That's the fundamental fairness question.
MR. WATERS:

Well, I think that the -- the

ineligibility of parole, as this Court held in Simmons, is

34
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

only directly relevant to future dangerousness to society

2

argument, and that, of course, was the due process

3

rationale followed in Simmons.

4

As far as whether under an Eighth Amendment

5

context or even under a due process that life without

6

parole is an effective rebuttal to retribution arguments

7

and that sort of thing, that's not presented by this case.

8

But I -- I think that the -- the relevance, again, of --

9

of ineligibility for parole is to rebut future

10
11

dangerousness to society.
QUESTION:

That's what --

Well, in -- in Simmons, there's no

12

question that the future dangerousness issue, together

13

with the jury's question and so on, presented an egregious

14

case of -- of a need for instruction.

15

MR. WATERS:

16

QUESTION:

Yes.
But let's -- let's assume -- and I

17

don't believe this is this case, even remotely, but let's

18

assume we had a case in which somehow future dangerousness

19

were not an issue.

20

straight retribution case.

21

enough history to put in -- in doubt, to put into question

22

what really is meant by life imprisonment, in the absence

23

of a further instruction, why doesn't fundamental fairness

24

require that the jury know for sure what the terms mean,

25

which it must select from in sentencing this person?

And let's assume we -- we had a -- a

MR. WATERS:

Well, again, the jury is told we're

dealing with death or life imprisonment.
QUESTION:

3

No, but that simply begs the

4

question.

That -- that is changing my question to you.

5

My question to you says we're operating in a context in

6

which historical practice leads one to -- to question

7

whether jurors really do understand that life means life

8

in this case in this State now.

9

doesn't fundamental fairness require that the juries be

On that assumption, why

10

given a clear instruction so that they're not sitting

11

there wondering what it means if they come back with a

12

life sentence?
MR. WATERS:

13

I think that that depends that --

14

that be all to end all is the without parole context of

15

life.

16

and in order to get to your point, I think that you have

17

to assume that adding without parole to it makes it so

18

far --

19

I mean, life is still a very severe penalty, and --

QUESTION:

You bet I assume that.

There is a

20

big difference between life imprisonment, in which a

21

person never walks out of the prison, and life

22

imprisonment in which the person walks out 15 years later.

23

Yes, I make that assumption and I want you to make that

24

assumption in answering my question.

25

fundamental fairness require that the juries understand

Why doesn't

Alderson Reporting Company

2

that?
MR. WATERS:

Well, again, I would have to fall

3

back to the fact of is the only aspect of the State's case

4

that it rebuts is future dangerousness to society.

5

and so that --

QUESTION:

And --

And my question to you is let's

7

assume a case in which that is not the issue, a case in

8

which we're talking about retribution.

9

the issue down here.

10
11

I want to narrow

Why doesn't fundamental fairness

require that the jurors understand what the words mean?
MR. WATERS:

Because if it is a purely

12

retributive case and -- and future dangerousness was not

13

an issue, then there is nothing fundamentally unfair.

14

State has not made any arguments that the defendant did

15

not have an opportunity to rebut.

16

holding of Simmons.

17

QUESTION:

The

And -- and that's the

Yes, but the -- the argument to the

18

contrary would be if you were sitting there thinking that

19

this terrible murderer is in front of you and you are

20

asked what is the appropriate punishment, and on the one

21

hand you were told it's death, and on the other hand you

22

were told -- well, you're not told because a person who

23

wants to retribute, wants vengeance, would surely like to

24

know that the alternative to death, which is surely

25

vengeance, is life in prison forever, not just life in

37
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

prison for 10 or 15 years.

2

death case punishment stage, surely that would be on

3

anyone's list of top five of the relevant factors.

4

MR. WATERS:

I mean, can you think -- in a

I don't know if you can necessarily

5

assume that's the case when the jury hears evidence and

6

they're instructed on what to consider and the focus of

7

the evidence is his adaptability in prison, which is the

8

case in this case and many other cases.

9

And I think with regard to life without parole

10

being a response to purely retributive arguments, it's not

11

such an obvious be all and end all response to -- to

12

retribution that due process steps in, as opposed to the

13

situation in Simmons where future dangerousness to society

14

does respond to that.

15

distinction there that -- that retribution is not

16

necessarily directly responded to by a life without parole

17

sentence, and so --

18

QUESTION:

I think that there is still a

I assume that the reason for these

19

rules were just -- just State principles that the law says

20

what it says, and we don't want to get into the

21

refinements of -- of how long a life sentence may be.

22

those States that do allow the fact that a life sentence

23

does mean a life sentence to be introduced, do those

24

jurisdictions also permit or do other jurisdictions permit

25

the prosecution to show that a life sentence does not mean

MR. WATERS:

There -- there are a number of --

3

of jurisdictions that have wrestled with that.

4

California v. Ramos is an example of that.

5

had -- has wrestled with that.

6

on the possibility of commutation, on the possibility of

7

pardon, on the possibility of change in the law and -- and

8

add argument on that as well.

9

I think

Illinois has

So, some do allow charges

And, of course, South Carolina's policy has

10

always been that we want a simple either/or choice, death

11

or life, and -- and we don't want to bring in these

12

collateral concerns.

13

Court disagree with that as a matter of policy, this

14

Court, of course, has stated in many contexts that, you

15

know, the -- the wisdom of policy decisions, as long as

16

they have a certain modicum of -- of reasonableness, are

for the States.

18

QUESTION:

Now, whether the members of this

Is the prosecution allowed to argue

19

in South Carolina when -- when the choice is -- is life or

20

death, is the prosecution allowed to argue the possibility

21

of commutation?

22

MR. WATERS:

No, no.

Parole and early release

23

is off-limits on both sides of the coin, and there's never

24

been a State case yet to rule that, well, to be fair, the

25

prosecution needs to have that, at least as --

Alderson Reporting Company

QUESTION:

Well, that's not really very fair, is

it?

it could be commuted.

MR. WATERS:

When -- when the jury, you know -- if you instruct

You'd have to let the prosecution come in and say

Absolutely, absolutely, and I would

agree with that.

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. WATERS:
QUESTION:

10

Or the -- all the law can be changed?
Or it could be changed.
The South Carolina Supreme Court

11

hasn't dealt with that issue, though, has it?

12

because Simmons is relatively new.

13

where the prosecutor says, okay, judge, I said future

14

dangerousness, but I want to tell them that the law can

15

change, that there's a pardon, that there's a clemency

16

power?

17

Because --

Has there been a case

That hasn't come up, has it?
MR. WATERS:

Not of which I'm aware.

In fact,

18

this rule developed initially when there was parole

19

eligibility, and it was really a rule initially created to

20

-- to benefit defendants, frankly, in -- in that they

21

didn't want the jury to know -- the defense didn't want

22

the jury to know that there was parole eligibility.

23

the South Carolina Supreme Court said, okay, we're going

24

to charge life.

25

what it means.

Life means life imprisonment.

So,

QUESTION:

Well, then the South Carolina Supreme

MR. WATERS:

3

It had.

There was a period of time

where their -- they did sanction charging on parole

eligibility.

on either 20- or 30-year parole eligibility, depending on

think.

This was prior to life without parole on --

That existed, I

So, there was a period of time.
But the policy -- the rule has always stayed the

10
11

same, though, and that is that we don't want the jury to

12

be legislating a plan of punishment.

13

-- them to be concerned about these possible future

14

events.

We don't want to be

We want them to make an either/or choice.

15

And South Carolina will remain true to Simmons,

16

but beyond that, unless the policy is considered to be so

17

unreasonable as to not pass the laugh test, then I think

18

that they can potentially -- they can have that policy.

19

And I want to bring up another point, especially

20

with regard to this and -- and what the prosecution did in

21

this case.

22

don't -- I don't think it would be wise to -- to assume

23

that prosecutors are going to be dishonest or to assume

24

that the State court is going to be dishonest and is going

25

to circumvent this rule.

I don't think the -- the Court should -- or I

1

And in fact, what the prosecution was doing in

2

this case, yes, he was trying to avoid Simmons, but he was

3

doing that to obey the law.

4

Justice O'Connor's concurrence, it said that if the

5

prosecution does not argue future dangerousness, then the

6

charge does not have to be given, and -- and that's what

7

the prosecutor was doing here.

8

circumvent the law.

9

was trying to obey the law, and -- and --

QUESTION:

And -- and clearly in -- in

So, he wasn't trying to

He wasn't trying to be sneaky.

He

Yes, but he was trying to get the --

prevent the jury from getting this information.
MR. WATERS:

That's true.

That's true.

He made

13

a tactical decision that he -- and I don't know if it's

14

necessarily tactical -- he was not going to rely on future

15

dangerousness, and since that would not trigger Simmons,

16

then the State law rule would apply.

17

QUESTION:

And that's --

And -- and he also kind of snuck in

18

the word dangerousness there in the -- in the 30-foot

19

example, but they don't count because they weren't

20

prominent in his argument.

21

MR. WATERS:

Well, I'd -- I'd like to -- to

22

address that specifically.

23

he was talking about the particular crime in this --

24
25

QUESTION:

At that point in the argument,

What -- what passage are we -- are we

talking about a passage?

I don't have it in my -- where

Alderson Reporting Company

the -- the prosecutor expressly says future dangerous?

2

MR. WATERS:

3

QUESTION:

4

No, not at all.
I thought perhaps from his question

that's what we were talking about.
MR. WATERS:

5

What he -- what he was doing was he

6

said, okay, this defendant is quick-witted.

This

7

defendant -- the evidence says this defendant is not

8

retarded.

9

Shirley Shealy, for this crime on this January the 5th,

Now, doesn't that make him more dangerous for

10

for this particular lady?

11

if you read his argument in context, was again that the

12

petitioner in this case was a close family friend of the

13

victim and also used to work at that very same Kentucky

14

Fried Chicken.
QUESTION:

15

And what he was saying, if --

Mr. Waters, it wasn't quite like

16

that.

He said dangerousness, and then counsel for the

17

defense stopped him at that point, and then he came back

18

with, well, I meant dangerous for her.
MR. WATERS:

Well, I don't know if you can

20

necessarily read that that was at a protracted period.

may have been he just cut off before he finished his

defendant to death for all the bad things that he has done

9

culminating in this capital crime.

This was such a

horrible crime.

This is a case for the death penalty.

And that

So, I would assert then that, you know, when

18

read as a whole -- and -- and again, if you look at the

19

evidence of dangerousness -- and there's been some raised

20

of whether -- the issue raised of whether dangerousness

21

within prison counts.

22

logic, it doesn't because, you know, whether or not the

defendant is going to get out of prison has nothing to do

with whether he will be a danger inside.

would be very dangerous to the people he came in contact

9

with.

10
11

The fact is the

And I thought you were arguing that you couldn't

make such an inference.
MR. WATERS:

I think that that -- that evidence

12

is very close, but I would -- I would assert that -- that

the way it was used in this particular case to respond to

14

adaptability, which is dangerousness within prison, which

15

was the specific issue that was focused before this jury.

If the prosecution --

QUESTION:

But what started all of this, I

18

thought, was -- was the point that you were making that

21

misunderstood your point.

MR. WATERS:

No.

Maybe I

I -- I agree that that

particular -- those particular instances are a bit broader

than the majority of evidence of dangerousness within

You're saying

10

he's going to be adaptable?

Well, he says, you know, he

11

has violent fantasies.

Well, that was brought out on

12

direct by the defense.

They -- they brought that out, of

13

these violent fantasies, and the State was merely cross

14

examining on a point that already had been made by the

15

defense and saying, your opinion here is that he's

16

adaptable.

Well, what about this -- this violent fantasy?

So, it was only used in the context of -- even

17
18

though it -- I agree, it has a broader context -- a

19

broader -- you know, it wasn't just his misbehavior in

20

prison, but it was only used by the State here to

challenge the adaptability prison in -- or the

of course, is the state of -- of Skipper, and -- and it's

I'm sorry?

The -- the point?

The argument made is that when the

argues violence, dangerousness outside of prison.

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

hence raised a risk of -- of acting out his dangerous

propensity if he succeeds in escaping.

MR. WATERS:

And I think that that's -- I would

agree with that wholeheartedly.

the -- of the prosecution's dangerousness within prison

evidence went to him being an escape risk, and -- but the

fact of the matter is, is whether or not you buy there's a

8

distinction between -- or accept there's a distinction

9

between inside prison and outside society, whether or not

I think the majority of

10

-- whatever you think about Simmons, the fact of the

11

matter is that ineligibility for parole does absolutely

But, you know, as far as to his contention that,

well, why does the State care, you know, about giving this

charge if they're saying they're not raising future

dangerousness, again it raises these collateral concerns

down the road of pardon, which he's eligible for pardon.

It raises the -- the issues of change in the law, and --

And so, that's why it

It doesn't want to have to get into that.
And if that issue is given, I don't know if a

QUESTION:

22

Mr. Waters, you didn't really mean --

your brief could be read to say that -- that the lawyer

was effectively allowed to tell the jury that life means

Right.
It's no different than -- from what

it was in Shafer in that respect.
MR. WATERS:

I -- I fully understand what Shafer

7

held, and my only point with that was, was that the

8

reasons that -- that this Court relied upon in Shafer were

9

not present in this case, to why those were not

10

sufficient, and that was, number one, the jury asked.

11

obviously, it didn't work.

12

told the jury, well, parole eligibility is not for your

13

consideration, which raised the concern in Simmons that,

14

well, parole is available but for some --

QUESTION:

So,

And number two, that the judge

But you -- but you don't dispute that

16

if the -- if the lawyer then -- if she had tried to say in

open court, now, jurors, I'm going to read you from the

18

South Carolina, that she would have her head cut off by

19

the judge.

20

MR. WATERS:

I think it's very unlikely the

21

trial judge would have allowed her to do that.

22

Absolutely.

23

And -- and we would just assert, though, that --

24

that this is a case -- there's no indication whatsoever

25

that the jury was confused or concerned with his possible

from what happened in Shafer when it said that that was

They didn't ask the question.

They weren't -And so, all I'm

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID I. BRUCK

2

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

3

MR. BRUCK:

Thank you, Your Honor.

4

The question has come up again concerning the

5

history of South Carolina's handling of this matter.

I

6

should say that a very detailed accounting of the whole

7

history, legislative and judicial, is provided in the cert

8

petition in Simmons itself, and it's not a very edifying

9

tale.

It really shows that the legislature, when they

10

first considered a limited life without parole, was

11

deadlocked because of a fear that it would reduce the

12

number of death sentences, and the legislative compromise

13

that finally came out was we can go ahead and have life

14

without parole because you don't have to tell the jury

15

anyway.

MR. BRUCK:

Yes, it did.
And what was the reason for that?
It's not entirely clear.

The

QUESTION:

So, there is a pardon power which -When you say commutation, that's all

synonymous with --

13

MR. BRUCK:

Clemency.

14

QUESTION:

-- clemency?

15

MR. BRUCK:

16

There is a pardon power which, according to the

That's right.

17

record in Simmons, has never been exercised, and by its

18

terms requires a showing of the most extraordinary

circumstances.

20

And there -- so, South Carolina's life without

21

parole is as locked down as any State's.

22

well, there's lots of play is simply not so, and -- and so

23

there's very little that the State could come back with.

The idea that,

play at the joints, absolutely, if the jury is told the

And that is why in one case the verbatim same

success in having this instruction not given.

But when a prosecutor decides

And I should say that if this -- if these facts
