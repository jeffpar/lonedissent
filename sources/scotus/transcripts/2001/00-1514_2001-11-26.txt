CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Mr. Bolter.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HOWARD L. BOLTER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. BOLTER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

Section 1367 is a constitutional and sensible

12

response by Congress to the serious procedural problems

13

that were facing the Federal courts prior to 1990.

14

procedural problems arose due to State claims that were

15

pending in the Federal courts at that time under this

16

Court's, what was then called, pendent jurisdiction and is

17

now called supplemental jurisdiction.

18

specifically was what happens to those State claims that

19

are pending in Federal court when the expiration of the

20

statute of limitations on those claims occurs.

21

Those

The problem

The courts were faced with a dilemma at that

22

point, do they dismiss these claims and risk having them

23

not be refiled in the State court or do they retain those

24

-- the supplemental jurisdiction over those claims and

25

decide issues that might be better suited for the State

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

courts when they don't -- when the Federal court no longer

2

wants to exercise that jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

3

What -- what's wrong with, as some

4

courts did, conditioning dismissal upon -- upon the

5

plaintiff's -- upon the defendant's agreement to -- to

6

waive the statute?
MR. BOLTER:

7

The problem with that solution,

8

Justice Scalia, is that there is no guarantee that there

9

would be an agreement to waiver.

The defendant is -- it's

10

up to the defendant to agree to that waiver and to say

11

that they will -- they will not bring up that statute of

12

limitations defense in State court.
QUESTION:

13

Right, and if he doesn't waive, then

14

-- then you proceed in Federal court because it's just not

15

-- not a proper -- proper basis for dismissing it.

16

-- what's the matter with that solution?
MR. BOLTER:

17

What's

In that -- in that situation, it

18

might work.

There might be supplemental jurisdiction and

19

the plaintiffs will not lose their claims.
However, that is just one court's potential

20
21

solution.

There were a number of solutions that were

22

being attempted at the time with varying effectiveness.

23

It didn't guarantee, across the board, that plaintiffs

24

would be able to bring those State claims in Federal court

25

and be assured that they would be -- that they wouldn't be

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

forfeited if the statute of limitations ran out.
One -- one possible solution to the problem

2
3

doesn't make 1367 unconstitutional.

4

general response to a general problem that was occurring

5

below.

6

QUESTION:

1367 was a -- was a

How about the Solicitor General's

7

suggestion that we construe the statute so as not to apply

8

to nonconsenting -- actions against nonconsenting States?
MR. BOLTER:

9

To do that, the Court needs to

10

address the threshold question of whether the statute

11

abrogates in -- in the first place, whether tolling is an

12

abrogation of the State's immunity, and we contend that it

13

is not.

14

QUESTION:

Well, but the Solicitor General says,

15

as I understand his brief, that we would avoid that

16

constitutional question if we construed the statute in the

17

manner that he asked us to construe it.

18

MR. BOLTER:

If the -- if that scenario was

19

taken and -- and the construction is -- is construed not

20

to apply to the States, there will be serious

21

constitutional problems that will be created by that

22

construction, particularly depriving the -- the Federal

23

litigants of their access to the Federal forum.

24
25

QUESTION:

Well, what constitutional provision

do you say would be violated if we followed that

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

suggestion?
MR. BOLTER:

2

The right -- the due process rights

3

of a plaintiff to have their cause of action heard in a --

4

in a certain forum, to make sure that they would have

5

those claims heard.

6

QUESTION:

7

there?

What case from this Court?
MR. BOLTER:

8
9

What case supports your position

I don't know if there's a case

that's -- oh, I'm sorry.

I take that -- that's the Logan

10

case that -- that shows that a -- that a plaintiff has a

11

right to have their -- their cause of action heard.
QUESTION:

12
13

But not to have a cause of action

heard in Federal court against a State.
MR. BOLTER:

14

That -- that's correct, not to have

15

-- not to have it heard in -- in the Federal court against

16

the State, but to have it heard in some forum.
QUESTION:

17

The way --

But suppose the State decided it

18

wasn't going to waive its immunity.

19

in Minnesota, you could bring this claim within 45 days.

20

The State has waived its immunity for suit in its own

21

court.

22

MR. BOLTER:

23

QUESTION:

As I understand it,

That's -- that's right.
So -- but it -- you're not suggesting

24

that it had to do that, otherwise there would be a due

25

process violation.

If that were so, then the State

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

doesn't have any immunity because due process would compel

2

it to -- to answer.
MR. BOLTER:

3

What we are saying is that the due

4

process violation would be if you construe the statute not

5

to apply to the States, you don't have the protection of

6

tolling a State claim against a State in Federal court.

7

And if a State asserts its constitutional defense of

8

sovereign immunity, that claim could be barred, but be --

9

in --

10

QUESTION:

But it wouldn't have been if you had

11

filed a protective action.

12

uncertain question of Eleventh Amendment immunity from

13

suit in Federal court, you could have, on the same day you

14

filed in Federal court and took a chance on that, filed a

15

protective action in Minnesota State court.

16

MR. BOLTER:

Suppose you had -- with this

We -- we could have filed a

17

protective action, but the -- that has -- I think there

18

are two parts to that -- that answer.

19

First, we could have filed a protective action,

20

but there's no guarantees that the State would have stayed

21

that action.

22

litigation on that matter, creating res judicata and

23

claims preclusion issues in the Federal court.

24

have sought to dismiss it because of claims splitting.

25

It might have -- it might have forced

It might

And the next part of the question is that the --

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the Supreme Court of Minnesota said that this was a

2

facially unconstitutional -- section 1367 -QUESTION:

3

But wouldn't it -- it wouldn't have

4

occasion to say that -- as I understand it, when

5

duplicative actions are brought, the second court, the one

6

where you file second, generally although it's not

7

compelled to do this, will say, okay, prior action

8

pending.

9

finished.

We'll stay this case till the other one is

MR. BOLTER:

10

They -- they could do that, but the

11

point is that it wasn't -- there was no guarantee that

12

they will.

13

to clog up their dockets and have -- have cases affecting

14

their statistics.

They might also choose not to stay it and not

QUESTION:

15

You have -- you're using a lot of

16

mights.

17

courts treat the prior action pending plea?

18

dismiss or do they keep it?

19

Do you have any -- do we know how Minnesota State

MR. BOLTER:

Do they

They -- if the claim is filed in

20

Minnesota on -- they will not dismiss if it was clear that

21

the Federal court would not have exercised jurisdiction

22

over that Federal -- over that State claim.

23

And in Minnesota, it was not clear at that time,

24

and it's still not clear because the -- the university and

25

the States have this constitutional defense which they can

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

assert or not assert.

2

some of the cases that we've cited show that Minnesota,

3

the university, has litigated cases, on the merits in

4

Federal court, State and Federal claims.

5

It's at their discretion.

In fact,

So, the point there is that we didn't know that

6

the court would not exercise jurisdiction over the State

7

claims, and if we were to file with that knowledge in --

8

in State court, they could have dismissed on claims

9

splitting or claim preclusion ground -- or claims

10

splitting grounds because the Federal court might have

11

exercised jurisdiction.

12

QUESTION:

It was not clear.

It seems to me the principle you're

13

arguing for -- I'm just not sure what its -- what its

14

boundaries are.

15

when the Federal Government creates a Federal cause of

16

action, any State law that impedes -- and -- and allows

17

that Federal action to be brought in Federal court, any

18

State law that impedes the bringing of that action in

19

Federal court can be repealed by the Federal Government.

20

The principle, as I take it, is when --

How does that apply, for example, to simple

21

statutes of limitations?

Let's -- let's assume you -- you

22

have a Federal statute of -- of a year for certain -- for

23

a certain transaction or occurrence.

24

for the same transaction or occurrence and the State's

25

cause of action is just 6 months.

The State statute

Now, would you argue

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that because of the difficulty of claims splitting and so

2

forth, the Federal Government can prescribe by statute

3

that the State cause of action shall be extended to 12

4

months?

5

MR. BOLTER:

6

QUESTION:

No, that's not what we are saying.
Well, why not?

If you say no, then

7

you acknowledge the principle that, you know, there are

8

some problems that have no solution, and -- and the mere

9

fact that you're making the Federal cause of action more

10

difficult has nothing to do with whether there's Federal

11

power to -- to solve that particular problem.
MR. BOLTER:

12

The -- the scenario that you just

13

posed about the 6-month and the 1-year time limits -- you

14

could still file that State claim in Federal court within

15

6 months.

16

-- the State statute of limitations.

17

that maybe the State will ultimately object to.

18

You have to comply with the -- the State cause

QUESTION:

It's just in a forum

Yes, but the Federal Government wants

19

to give you 12 months in its courts.

That's -- that's the

20

policy that it's decided.

21

and here's a State which has a State cause of action.

22

is -- it is putting you to the choice.

23

the -- the State cause of action or -- or you -- you file

24

within 6 months.

25

what the Federal Congress wanted to happen?

We want to give you 12 months,
It

You either forego

Doesn't that impede, to some extent,

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. BOLTER:

I think in your -- in that

2

hypothetical, it probably would impede, but that's not the

3

situation that we have in front of us.

4

QUESTION:

Oh, I understand it isn't, but -- but

5

I -- but the principle you're arguing for, it seems to me,

6

leads to that conclusion, that the Federal Government can

7

-- can reconfigure State causes of action willy-nilly so

8

that they don't impede the bringing of Federal causes of

9

action in Federal court as Congress wishes.
MR. BOLTER:

10

What the -- what the statute does

11

here, if it's applied to a State, is it tolls the time

12

limit.

13

the -- the statute of limitations.

14

this claim on the 50th day, 1367(d) wouldn't apply.

15

It doesn't -- it doesn't change the time limit for

QUESTION:

If we were to file

Well, I -- I wonder about that.

16

understanding is -- correct me if I'm wrong, please --

17

that the Federal statute gives you an extra 30 days.

18

MR. BOLTER:

It gives you the -- the tolling --

19

the tolling provision runs for 30 days after the time

20

after the dismissal.

21

QUESTION:

My

Well, and so if you -- if -- if as in

22

this case, I think you file on the last day or the next-

23

to-the-last day in the Federal court, then you're given an

24

extra 30 days.

25

contrary to your suggestion.

So, you do reconfigure the State statute,
And -- and I have a

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

significant problem with that.

2

tolling provision is necessary in order to make the

3

Federal courts operate and exercise their jurisdiction in

4

an efficient manner, but this statute goes beyond that and

5

gives a longer statute of limitations.

6

MR. BOLTER:

7

QUESTION:

8
9

It might be that the

Well, it gives a longer tolling -It does reconfigure the statute of

limitations.
MR. BOLTER:

I would respectfully disagree that

10

it reconfigures the -- the statute of limitations because

11

it's -- the statute -- the State statute has to be

12

complied with in order for 1367 to -- to be triggered.

13

has to be filed within the appropriate time period.

14

-- and that meets the statute of limitations objectives

15

that the State was seeking when it -- when it created that

16

45-day period.

17

been timely filed is not -- that's -- that's not a core

18

interest that's protected by the State sovereign immunity.

19

Tolling a statute that has been complied with, in this

20

case filing within that 45 days --

21

It

And

The fact that it's being tolled after it's

QUESTION:

Well, it hasn't been complied with

22

under State law.

If -- if the State law acknowledged the

23

filing in Federal court as -- as satisfying the statute of

24

limitations, you wouldn't be here.

25

State law says you have to file the action in State court

The problem is the

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

within the statute of limitations period, and we're not

2

going to give you any grace period for a false start that

3

you made in Federal court.

4

MR. BOLTER:

Well, the -- the State statute is

5

silent on tolling.

It's not a condition of -- of the

6

State's waiver of that 45-day period and -QUESTION:

7

But the State court here found that

8

the State district court did not abuse its discretion in

9

saying there wouldn't be any tolling, did it not?
MR. BOLTER:

10

That's what -- they found that

11

there was no abuse of discretion, but that was -- that --

12

the State court's initial decision there was based on a --

13

an erroneous interpretation of Pennhurst II when -QUESTION:

14

Well, but that presumably is up to

15

the Minnesota courts to decide when the -- when the State

16

statute is tolled.
MR. BOLTER:

17

They have the discretion to decide

18

that, but it's our position that the tolling provision of

19

1367(d) can also toll that time period because it's not

20

abrogating the State's sovereign immunity.
QUESTION:

21

It's not --

Well, but you know, you say it isn't

22

tolling because it's -- it doesn't really go to the length

23

of the statute of limitations, one.

24

know.

25

limitations is tolled for a year, obviously that extends

But it does, you

If you say the -- if you want to say a statute of

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the time that the State law would have allowed.
MR. BOLTER:

2

But it doesn't defeat the purpose

3

of -- of the statute of limitations and -- and the need to

4

file in a timely fashion with that State statute to begin

5

with.

6

if the State has a core interest in the statute of

7

limitations, that's what it would be, is that claims are

8

filed within that time period.

9

a -- in a jurisdiction to which the State ultimately

10
11

And I think that's what the -- the State -- the --

Now, whether it's filed in

objects is -- is another point.
QUESTION:

That isn't self-evident.

I mean, if

12

what you're saying is true, every State would

13

automatically allow tolling when suit is filed in a

14

Federal court within the State statute period.

15

self-evidently true that the State policy is not at all

16

offended by that, you wouldn't have a problem and you

17

wouldn't be here because every State would say, well, it

18

was filed in Federal court.

19

If it were

That's good enough for us.

But it isn't good enough for a lot of States.

20

And -- and, you know, it's their policy we're talking

21

about, and their policy is you must file in State court

22

within the limitations period.

23

QUESTION:

May I ask you a sort of preliminary

24

question I'm kind of puzzled about?

What is the source of

25

the Federal Government's power to enact the statute at

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

all?
MR. BOLTER:

Article III to control the lower

3

Federal courts gives the -- the Government the power to

4

create these -- these Federal practices and procedures, in

5

this case, the -- the way to address combined Federal and

6

State claims, as well as its -- its -- the powers to

7

protect individuals from losing their due process rights

8

to have their claims heard and -- and burdening the access

9

to the Federal courts.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. BOLTER:

So, it's Article III you rely on.
Yes, Article III and -- and partly

12

on the equal -- equal protection for -- to allow

13

plaintiffs to have access to Federal courts and bring

14

their Federal claims and their State claims if they -- if

15

they need to do that as well.

16

QUESTION:

It would just -- when Congress passed

17

this, Congress I -- I assume was just thinking it was

18

regulating the procedure in Federal courts, that it was

19

exercising that power to implement Article III.

20

And what you said about due process, I didn't

21

see any sign of that in the history of 1367.

22

not suggesting that before 1367, people were denied due

23

process because there wasn't a tolling provision.

24
25

MR. BOLTER:

But you're

In some circumstances, they were

because of the claims -- the combination of the claims

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

splitting and claims preclusion laws in the State courts

2

and States and the statute of limitations on those pendent

3

claims if they were brought in Federal court could result

4

in a denial of a forum for that State claim if -- if a

5

Federal claim was also asserted.

6

QUESTION:

Is there -- is there any indication

7

that Congress, when it amended 1367, relied on anything

8

other than Article III?

9

section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment?

10
11

MR. BOLTER:

QUESTION:

13

MR. BOLTER:

QUESTION:

16

MR. BOLTER:

17

that it provides --

18

QUESTION:

20

Well, is it implicit?
I think it's implicit in there that

they're --

15

19

I don't think it's -- that it's

explicit in the congressional --

12

14

Are you suggesting it relied on

Where do you find that?
Well, the protections that it --

I mean, I'm -- I'm talking about what

Congress thought, not what you think.
MR. BOLTER:

I -- I'm not sure I understand your

21

question, Mr. Chief Justice.

22

QUESTION:

Well, my question was, is there any

23

reason to think that Congress, when it made this

24

amendment, was relying on section 5 of the Fourteenth

25

Amendment, in addition to Article III?

16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. BOLTER:

Aside from nothing explicit, I

2

don't -- I don't know what Congress was thinking other

3

than what I could speculate.

4

QUESTION:

5

came out of the Federal Courts Study Committee?

6
7

MR. BOLTER:

Yes, it did come out of the Federal

Courts Study Committee?
QUESTION:

8
9

Well -- well, don't we know that this

And so -- and Congress took the

suggestion of that Federal Courts Study Committee, and as

10

far as I recall, in that report, they were talking about

11

the authority of Congress to regulate the procedure in

12

Federal courts.
MR. BOLTER:

13

That's right.

I think that goes to

14

California, and it dismisses, and you then file in

2

California, is there tolling as a general matter?

3

MR. BOLTER:

In that situation with -- with two

States, I would say that unless it was within the time

period of California, it would probably not be tolled in

6

that situation.

QUESTION:

All right.

Well, that -- that seems

to me very similar to what we have here.
MR. BOLTER:

Well, we have a filing in Federal

10

court here with -- with a statute that -- that directly

11

addresses the tolling --

12

QUESTION:

Well, but you're -- you're -- well,

13

it does or it doesn't.

14

that the statute of limitations was not in any way

15

extended because it was tolled by the filing.

extended by this additional 30 days.

now, almost double.

But you -- you indicated earlier

You basically have

45 -- the 45 plus 30.

MR. BOLTER:

But it is

You have 75 days

Well, I think that the tolling

20

provision is different.

I mean, it does give additional

21

time, but it doesn't extend the time period that the State

22

was open and exposed to liability.

23

45-day period.

24

they were put on notice.

25

they were going to be sued and it was brought in -- within

It doesn't extend that

They were already notified of it.

They --

They had the -- they knew that

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that 45-day period.
The fact that it was suspended during a time

2
3

period where the State was in Federal court at its own --

4

its own discretion, it would be -- it would be harmful to

5

the plaintiffs to have the State be able to use the delay

6

in time that it's pending in Federal court to bar the

7

claim from being brought after that in State court.
QUESTION:

8
9

Mr. Bolter, what you said might be so

if the only purpose of the statute of limitations were

10

repose, being notified on time that you're subject to

11

suit.

12

But there are certain statutes that have been

13

called so-called built-in statute of limitations where the

14

limitation is considered part and parcel of the right

15

itself usually when it's in the very same statute, and

16

that seems to be the kind of limitation that we have here.

17

We have a State that is giving up its sovereign immunity,

18

but only on these terms.

So, why isn't this a built-in

19

statute of limitations?

So, by necessity there would be

20

harm when the State says it's the right -- we condition

21

the right on you bringing suit within 45 days.

22

MR. BOLTER:

They didn't make, as a part of that

23

condition, anything about tolling.

That's -- that's I

24

think the -- the first point, and -- and that's what this

25

statute is doing, is tolling.

It's not changing that --

20
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that right, that built-in right that you talk about, to

2

the 45-day period.

3

with.

4

different -- it's a different animal here, but it doesn't

5

extend that time limit, that -- that built-in time limit

6

simply by tolling.

It suspends it from running out but it

7

doesn't extend it.

I couldn't have filed that claim 75

8

days after it was sued.

9

or else it would have been barred, and 1367 would not have

10

That -- that still has to be complied

But this is talking about tolling, which is a

I had to file it within 45 days

attached.
QUESTION:

11

But I take it you're saying that

12

whether you regard it as built in or whether you regard

13

the policy as simply a policy of repose, Article III power

14

or section 5 power is what it is, and -- and it can

15

accomplish what this statute wants to accomplish.

16

MR. BOLTER:

17

QUESTION:

Yes.
I don't know why you rely just on

18

Article III or on section 5, which I think is pretty

19

remote in this situation.

20

the underlying Federal statute?

21

Federal power that justified the Federal cause of action

22

which is the subject of this extension provision.

Why -- why don't you rely on
There will always be some

Let's assume it's a Commerce Clause cause of

23
24

action.

Under the Commerce Clause, the Federal Government

25

could have, if it wanted, eliminated the State cause of

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

action entirely, couldn't -- couldn't it?

2

said, we -- we preempt any State action in this field, and

3

the whole State cause of action would be washed away.

4

it can do that, why can't it do the lesser act of not

5

washing away the State cause of action, but just saying,

6

you know, if you bring suit in Federal court on this

7

Commerce Clause cause of action, you get another 30 days

8

or whatever, 45 days, whatever it is?
MR. BOLTER:

QUESTION:

10

It could have

If

Well, it doesn't -- it doesn't -Wouldn't that work?

That -- that

makes me feel a lot more comfortable than just relying on

Article III.

Well, I don't think that it

Why -- why is it unreasonable to

2

allow a mere extension of the -- of the State limitations

3

on that State cause of action?

4

MR. BOLTER:

Well, I guess I don't disagree that

5

it's not unreasonable to toll this -- these statutes of

6

limitations.
QUESTION:

7

Do you know of any case in which this

8

Court has held that Congress, when passing a statute of

its own, could totally forbid a State to enact a similar

MR. BOLTER:

12

I'm not aware of a case like that,

Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Neither am I.

Let's say, bring a 1983 claim against a

2

MR. BOLTER:

Yes, and -- and that's what we have

3

done in this case, or that's what we -- that's what this

4

-- and that's what this statute protects against, losing

5

those claims.

6

I -- I'm not sure if I understood your question,

7

Justice Ginsburg, about can you do that in Federal court,

8

I mean, latch onto those Federal claims?

9

that -- that is what supplemental jurisdiction is about in

Yes.

I mean,

11

appropriate to do that.

12

immunity.

15

So, I don't think that that's -- that's
And -- and it goes back to giving

I mean, I think the key -- one of the key things

16

here is that this -- that the tolling does not abrogate

17

the State's sovereign immunity because it's in a

18

jurisdiction that it wants to be in at all times.

19

choice is its own.

20

principles described by this Court in its jurisprudence

have been whether and where a State can be sued, and it

Right?

So, the Federal Government could -- could override

2

State statute of limitations on sovereign immunity cases

no matter what because it's not really part of sovereign

4

immunity.

5

MR. BOLTER:

6

QUESTION:

I don't -The State says, I'm willing to be

7

sued for 1 year, and you say the Federal Government

8

doesn't have to observe that 1 year.

9

you know, it's 2 years instead.

10

MR. BOLTER:

No.

It can say, well,

I think that the -- that 1

11

year has to be respected, but this is about tolling.

12

not about changing a statute of limitations.

13

about tolling the time period for it to run out.

I'd like to reserve the remainder for rebuttal.

This is

If there are no further questions at this time,

20

It's

MR. ROTENBERG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Your Honors, it's critical to focus on the

23

fundamental issue of federalism presented in this case;

24

namely, is it Congress or the State that has the power to

25

decide when that State can be sued by its own citizens in

25

QUESTION:

2

So, in your view, the Soldiers and

to extend the statute.

MR. ROTENBERG:

Is that right -Your Honor --

Under --

I mean, there's presently a statute

11

that says when they come back, people who are in the armed

forces, they will discover that the statute of limitations

in the States has been extended for 6 months.

14

or however long necessary.

15

unconstitutional.
MR. ROTENBERG:

In your --

In your opinion, that's

Your Honor, the -- the logic --

17

it may be unconstitutional is the direct answer to your

The logic -QUESTION:

All right.

Now, what about -- what

20

about tort reform?

21

that pass, there is a provision that somehow in there is

Suppose in the tort reform statutes

MR. ROTENBERG:

That could happen.

And if that

Justice Breyer, the -- the

26
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

thrust of Alden against Maine is that Congress does not

2

have the power under Article I to force a State to submit

3

to a private suit for damages in its own courts.

4

QUESTION:

All right.

Is it constitutional for

5

Congress to pass a copyright law or a -- any of these tort

6

statutes that are federalized and say that the States

7

cannot pass a statute that gives a cause of action in tort

8

that is different?

9
10

MR. ROTENBERG:

Your Honor, the answer to that

question would depend on Federal preemption principles.

11

QUESTION:

Correct.

12

MR. ROTENBERG:

13

QUESTION:

14

Then if they can do that, why can't they shape

Under the Commerce Clause --

Now, they -- they can preempt.

Fine.

15

the cause of action in the State so that it corresponds

16

with Federal law by, for example, extending a little bit

17

or not extending too much the statute of limitations?

18

MR. ROTENBERG:

The reason they cannot do -- the

19

Congress cannot do that, Justice Breyer, is because this

20

statute, 1367(d), represents a blanket attempt by Congress

21

to extend statutes of limitations without regard to the

22

existence of an independent power in Article I, such as

23

the war power which may suffice to protect --

In every case to which this -- this

7

MR. ROTENBERG:

Well, not in this case, Your

8

Honor, and this case is a perfect example of the -- of the

9

situation.

This -- this Court held that, in fact, there

10

was no power under Article I to hail the State into

11

Federal court in an age case.

12

petitioners here --

13

QUESTION:

So -- and -- and

No, but that's -- essentially you're

14

going back to the Eleventh Amendment.

15

understand your Eleventh Amendment argument, but you're

16

trying to overlay an Article I argument on that, and I

17

think that's where we're having -- having our difficulty.

18

But as I understand it, your ultimate answer to the

19

difficulty is the Eleventh Amendment.

20

MR. ROTENBERG:

I mean, your -- I

We -- Justice Souter, we have

21

two arguments, yes.

The -- the essential point of -- of

22

Alden relates to causes of action against the State

23

sovereign, and this Court in Alden has established a

24

categorical rule that a State's power to condition its

25

waiver of immunity is -- is not subject to the Article I

28
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

power of Congress to amend.

2

that, to the extent Maine chose to consent to certain

3

types of suits, while maintaining immunity in other types

4

of suits, it has done no more than exercise its privilege

5

of sovereignty concomitant to its constitutional immunity

6

from suit.

7

here.

So, that is the first and most important point

With regard to the -- the plenary authority of

9

In Alden, this Court held

Congress to adopt a sweeping statute of limitations

10

alteration in -- in the States that applies to an

11

unlimited type of claim, you have to look at whether there

12

was an express intent to abrogate and --

May I interrupt you?

14

MR. ROTENBERG:

-- and that would take you into

15

a -- a section 5, Fourteenth Amendment type analysis.

16

And --

17

QUESTION:

May I ask you this question as a

18

preliminary matter?

19

to one side just for a moment, because I do understand

20

your position there, assume this was a suit against a

21

public utility and the -- and they -- Minnesota provided

22

an especially short statute of limitations for that public

23

utility.

24

statute would be unconstitutional as applied in such a

25

case, or would it be valid?

Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. ROTENBERG:

The -- the statute is

2

unconstitutional if the Court needs to address the

3

question of legislative power, Justice Stevens, because

4

there is no case upholding a congressional power to enact

5

a sweeping expansion of statute of limitations --

6

QUESTION:

There's no case upholding it, no case

7

striking it down.

But -- but in any event, you think the

8

statute would be unconstitutional even if you didn't have

9

a State defendant.

10

MR. ROTENBERG:

11

QUESTION:

12
13

That's right, Your Honor.

Well, that -- that goes quite far.

What -- what is your reasoning there?
MR. ROTENBERG:

The reasoning there, Mr. Chief

14

Justice, is simply that since the Founding Convention,

15

it's been clear that the powers of Congress are defined

16

and limited, and the residual legislative power does not

17

rest with Congress.

Tenth Amendment under this Court's decisions in Marbury

19

and the -- as recently as United States against Morrison.

20

The -- the point of the matter is, Your Honors,

It rests with the States under the

21

that my able petitioners' counsel here has -- has failed

22

to suggest any case law that supports the enactment of a

23

-- of a change in the State statutes of limitations that's

24

unhinged from a particular exercise of power --

25

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

But the

QUESTION:

Mr. Rotenberg, did -- did the

MR. ROTENBERG:

I thought that their

Justice --

And to the extent that you're asking

10

us to consider this broader theory, you're asking us to

11

take that up -- to go beyond where the Minnesota Supreme

12

Court left off.
MR. ROTENBERG:

13

Yes, Justice Ginsburg, that's

14

correct.

the statute was unconstitutional as applied in all --

The -- my

-- my understanding of this Court's jurisprudence in this

Well, that's what bothered me.

This

may just be a misprint or something, but quite clearly the

State of Minnesota has the power to say that our consent

11

extends to this tolling provision, doesn't it?

12

It could come out the other way if it wants to.

13

indeed, they say that the equitable tolling applies to

14

their statute, don't they?

15

All right.

read this six times.

Now, I read their opinion.
Not six, but only two.

It could.

When -- when they get to the point,

this very point, it says, however, we read Alden to

Well, Alden has nothing to do with that.

But

3

they seem to think -- and after all, they did say that

4

this statute says 45 days, but it doesn't mean 45 days in

5

respect to equitable tolling.

6

our case Alden required them to limit it to the 45 days,

7

which of course it doesn't.

But they seem to think that

8

So, they seem to be under a misapprehension in

9

that respect, and I would like you to address that, what

10

we should do about that.

11

MR. ROTENBERG:

Justice Breyer, I agree with you

12

that Alden does not compel a particular interpretation of

13

State law.

14

That's certainly true.

It is also true that the Minnesota Supreme Court

15

unanimously determined that the 45-day limitation on its

16

waiver of sovereign immunity is -- is part and parcel of

17

the statute, as Justice Ginsburg previously mentioned, and

18

is an aspect of its -- of its sovereign immunity and in --

19

in addition said that the equitable tolling principle

20

could be applied.

21

Minnesota courts apply the equitable tolling principles in

22

an extremely conservative fashion.

But it's important to recall that the

Yes, but my question, of course, is,

what do we do about that sentence in the opinion which

Mr. Rotenberg, because sovereign

And even if you would say that -- that somehow

5

the petitioners here were not fully aware, as they should

have been, that the university was asserting its sovereign

7

immunity from the get-go, by June 3, they had a motion, a

still exceeded the 45 days.

QUESTION:

It's the result you want us to adopt.

4

MR. ROTENBERG:

Yes, it is, Your Honor.

But

5

Pennhurst specifically suggests -- yes.

Excuse me.

6

Pennhurst explicitly says that the expedient of filing the

7

claim in the State court will avoid any danger of this

8

kind occurring.

9

the proposition that a filing of the State claim, a

And -- and Pennhurst stands clearly for

10

protective claim, which petitioners' counsel here

11

acknowledged would solve the problem, and filing the

12

Federal claim in the Federal forum is a constitutionally

13

appropriate expedient.

14

Any contrary indication brings into question the

15

-- the opinion of this Court in -- in Pennhurst by

16

suggesting that filing concomitantly in the State and

17

Federal forums is somehow a due process problem.

18

Let me conclude with an -- a closing observation

19

about the due process issue.

Petitioners have not cited a

20

single case, not a single case, holding that the State's

21

handling of pendent claims, in the absence of section

22

1367, somehow violated due process.

23

important, Your Honors, petitioners do not seriously claim

24

that 1367(d) is a valid exercise of Congress' power under

25

section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to address any

39
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

supposed due process problems.

The record is simply bare.

Moreover, due process cannot be the basis of any

2
3

supposed abrogation here because the first element of

abrogating the State's sovereign immunity, using section 5

5

of the Fourteenth Amendment, is an explicit statement of

There is no such explicit statement of Congress

petitioners.
And most importantly, Your Honors, and in

12

conclusion, whether there might conceivably be an

13

unfairness in some hypothetical State situation, this

14

question of unfairness does not trump the Alden principle,

15

that Congress cannot, by an observation of unfairness

16

falling short of a due process issue, force a State to

submit to suit against itself in its own courts.

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

2

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT

3
4
5

MR. CLEMENT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
When this Court confronts a general grant of

6

jurisdiction, like 1367(a), it routinely infers that the

7

statute does not apply to nonconsenting States.

8

construction avoids difficult -- upsetting the balance

9

between Federal and State powers.

10

Such a

For similar reasons, this Court should construe

11

section 1367(d)'s tolling provision not to apply to

12

nonconsenting States.

13

sovereign immunity questions posed by the application of a

14

Federal statute to extend the State statute of limitations

15

against a nonconsenting State in State court.

16
17

QUESTION:
statement.

That reading avoids the difficult

You -- basically you're saying clear

Is that -- is that nub of your point?

18

MR. CLEMENT:

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. CLEMENT:

The nub of the point --

The clear statement rule.
-- is this Court should apply a

21

clear statement rule to this statute, the supplemental

22

jurisdiction statute, and since there's no indication in

23

the text or legislative history that Congress had any

24

contemplation that this would apply to nonconsenting

25

States, this Court should construe the provision as not

41
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

applying to nonconsenting States.
QUESTION:

Do you -- do you agree that in the

3

absence of a clear statement rule, there is no ambiguity

4

here that -- that would open the door to our giving this

5

kind of a construction?

6

MR. CLEMENT:

There is -- there is enough

7

ambiguity in the statute, if the Court wanted to, to reach

8

the second argument that we offer in our brief, but I

9

would suggest that the first argument we offer in the

10

brief, which you could call the clear statement argument,

11

is a more narrowly tailored and focused answer to the

12

constitutional issues that are raised by applying the

13

statute to nonconsenting States.

14

QUESTION:

Well, you've only got 10 minutes, and

15

I'll leave it to you to whether you want to get into it.

16

I -- I have trouble with the ambiguity argument.

17

understand your clear statement argument.

18

with the ambiguity.

19

MR. CLEMENT:

I

I have trouble

Well, if I could, I would focus on

20

the clear statement argument because I think it does very

21

narrowly avoid the constitutional issue that's raised.

22

QUESTION:

Now, to -- to apply the clear

23

statement argument, do we not have to at least decide that

24

it does constitute an elimination of State sovereign

25

immunity to require the tolling of -- of the action

42
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

against the State?
MR. CLEMENT:

I don't think so.

I think this

3

Court only needs to decide that it would raise grave

4

constitutional doubts before it would need to apply the --

5

the clear statement rule because, although in some

6

contexts, in the abrogation context, for example, a clear

7

statement rule assumes that -- that the Congress can't

8

constitutionally do something, in other contexts as

9

Gregory v. Ashcroft, Will against the Michigan Department

10

of -- of State -- in those cases, this Court has applied

11

clear statement principles even though they don't assume

12

the answer to the constitutional question.

13

course, is consistent with the way this Court approaches

14

matter as a general matter and its preference to avoid

15

constitutional questions.

16

And that, of

The -- the Court, for example, just last term in

17

-- in Vermont against United States ex rel. Stevens,

18

applied similar principles of statutory construction to

19

avoid directly addressing the Eleventh Amendment --

20

QUESTION:

It's fine when you're dealing with an

21

ambiguous statute.

Sure, just the mere presence of a

22

constitutional doubt will cause you to resolve the

23

ambiguity in such a fashion that it doesn't raise a

24

constitutional principle so you have sort of a clear

25

statement rule, unless it's a clear statement where

43
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

there's a -- but those are ambiguity cases.

2

You're -- you're purporting to forego reliance

3

upon ambiguity and to say even assuming that the statute

4

is clear, you should not interpret it to apply to the

5

States.

6

And now, do you have any case not involving

7

ambiguity, where we have applied the clear statement rule

8

without first finding that it is clearly an abrogation of

9

State sovereign immunity?

10

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I think, for example, in the

11

Stevens case, this Court interpreted the term person not

12

to include the State.

13

Court to do here is interpret the term, any claim, in

14

section 1367(d) to say any claim except one against a

15

nonconsenting State.

16

QUESTION:

What effectively we're asking the

Well, I think in Atascadero we

17

interpreted the word person so that it did not include the

18

State, even though you could say person means a lot.

19

MR. CLEMENT:

No.

That's exactly right.

20

And in Will against Michigan where the Court had

21

already held that 1983 did not implicate Eleventh

22

Amendment issues, this Court nonetheless held that in

23

State courts, the term person in 1983 does not apply to --

24

to States or to State officers acting in their official

25

capacities.

44
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

And I think all of those cases and the -- the

2

Court's decision in Gregory against Ashcroft and in Will

3

all stand for the proposition that this Court can apply a

4

clear statement type principle to avoid a

5

constitutional --

6

QUESTION:

How -- how do you respond to the

7

Soldiers and Sailors Civil Relief Act as applied to States

8

in tolling causes of action against the State?

9

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I -- I think that -- that in

10

order to maintain consistency with our position in this

11

case, we would have to ask this Court to apply a clear

12

statement rule in that case, and the current version of

13

the statute would probably not apply to States under that

14

-- under that theory.

15

QUESTION:

So, has that been happening?

I mean,

16

is it the case that the armed forces members have been

17

suing States or not under the act?

18

MR. CLEMENT:

We haven't seen that the -- that

19

the issue of sovereign immunity arising in those contexts,

20

and it very well -- well --

21

QUESTION:

And it could be just that --

22

MR. CLEMENT:

It very well may be, as counsel

23

for the University of Minnesota suggested, that States

24

will have the good sense in those instances to waive their

25

sovereign immunity defense.

I mean, the same principles

45
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that are going to motivate the Federal Government to pass

2

the Soldiers and Sailors Civil Relief Act are going to

3

motivate State governments to waive their sovereign

4

immunity defenses in those claims.
Now, it seems to me that -- two points I'd like

5
6

to make.

First of all, it's worth focusing on the fact

7

that even before 1367(d), the informal Federal court

8

practices for dealing with potentially untimely State

9

claims did not apply to nonconsenting States.

Justice

10

Scalia, you raised the -- the problem of conditioning a

11

dismissal on a withdraw -- of statute of limitations

12

defenses.

13

an absolute right to insist that the pendent claims

14

against it be dismissed.

15

court would not be able to condition the dismissal on a

16

waiver of a statute of limitations defense, nor would it

17

be able to retain jurisdiction over the claim.

18

stands to reason that 1367(d) should no more apply to

19

cases against nonconsenting States than the Federal court

20

practices it replaced.

21

But, of course, under Pennhurst II, a State has

So, in that context, the Federal

So, it

Lastly, I would emphasize that this

22

interpretation of section 1367(d) does not place

23

plaintiffs in an untenable position or in an

24

unconstitutional bind.

25

State objects to Federal court jurisdiction as a blanket

Plaintiffs, in cases where the

46
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

matter, have the same rights that they would have under

2

Pennhurst II.

3

the Federal and the State, which seems a complete answer

4

to any due process objections, or they can file parallel

5

proceedings.

They can file both claims in State court,

6

Even if the State makes a decision whether to

7

consent on a case by cases, as Minnesota appears to do,

8

the State -- the plaintiff can still attempt to get

9

consent in the first instance, and if it's not, it can

10

make a protective filing along the lines that Justice

11

Ginsburg suggested.
In the end, it seems that plaintiffs lack any

12
13

case law to support their due process arguments.

I think

14

that respondent, in fairness, lacks any case law to

15

support its -- its Article I legislative power argument.

16

There's really no need for this Court to make any

17

significant case law in order to decide this case if it

18

simply applies the clear statement test we suggest in our

19

brief.

20

If there's no other questions, I'll submit.
