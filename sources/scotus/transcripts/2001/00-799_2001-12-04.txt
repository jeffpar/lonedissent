ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL L. KLEKNER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. KLEKNER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Following its 1977 pioneering study, the City of

12

Los Angeles enacted a, in 1978 a comprehensive zoning

13

ordinance regulating the location of all types of adult

14

business activities in the city.

15

eight business activities and required that they each be

16

separated from each other by 1,000 feet.

The ordinance defined

17

Notwithstanding the clear intent of the city's

18

ordinance in 1978, it became apparent that the ordinance

19

could and was being interpreted to permit more than one

20

adult business in the same building.

21

described by plaintiffs as a drafting error inadvertent

22

loophole, but it was an ambiguity, and it became necessary

23

to amend the ordinance in 1983 to remove that ambiguity,

24

thereby --

ordinance was enacted -- 1977?

2

MR. KLEKNER:

3

QUESTION:

'78, sir.

'78.

Do we know if, at that time,

4

there were businesses like the one at issue here, i.e., a

5

place where they have both sale and rental and viewing --

MR. KLEKNER:

existed in that form in 1978?

Do we know if those businesses

QUESTION:

I'm sorry, I did not hear the

When the ordinance was initially

passed, which of the two types of business did they offer?
MR. KLEKNER:

5

Well, these businesses started in

6

the late eighties, early 1990's, either as a bookstore or

7

as an adult arcade.

8

QUESTION:

9
10
11
12

That's what I'm asking, which --

which?
MR. KLEKNER:

But it was well after the adoption

of the ordinance.
QUESTION:

Which did they start as, a bookstore,

or as an arcade?
MR. KLEKNER:

My recollection is that each -- I

15

think it was Highland Books started as a adult arcade, and

16

the reverse was true for Alameda Books.

17

bookstore.

18

QUESTION:

It started as a

Did your evidence in '78 or any

19

evidence since then specifically address the question of

20

whether the combination of more than one form of business

21

at one location has any measurable effect on, you know,

22

the deleterious effect that you measured?

23

MR. KLEKNER:

No.

The studies did not

24

specifically look at combination of adult businesses in

25

one place, or in one building.

They looked at the

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

clustering effect in the city's various communities.
QUESTION:

2

Am I wrong in thinking that the study

3

which you rely on, the 1977 study, did have as one

4

category bookstore/arcade.

5

the massage parlors, the adult theaters, and the adult

6

motels, but it was my understanding that the arcade plus

7

bookstore, or video sales shops, that those were together

8

in that 1977 study.
MR. KLEKNER:

9

It had as discrete entities

The answer is yes and no.

That

10

phrase appears several times in the study and in certain

11

conclusions, but if you look at the -- at certain of the

12

questionnaires that were sent out to various businesses,

13

community groups, the individual businesses were

14

separately identified.

15

shows, movie theaters, theaters, massage parlors.
QUESTION:

16

In other words, a bookstore, peep

Well then, is there nothing to what

17

we're told, that the -- this combination of video sales

18

plus viewing is common and, indeed, an arcade can't

19

survive as a stand-alone business, that the combination

20

of, you can see it, and if you want it you can buy it, was

21

common?

22

MR. KLEKNER:

Well, the issue of separateness,

23

and whether a business, an arcade and a bookstore can,

24

could, or should survive separately is off the table.

25

was not part -- there was a stipulation that the -- that

have to presume, as did the trial court and the court of

That's not before the

As the record now stands, I guess the Court would

QUESTION:

Well, each of these businesses was

8

one or the other of those things and operated on that

9

basis alone for how long?

10

MR. KLEKNER:

11

QUESTION:

a profit or at a loss?

13

MR. KLEKNER:

15
16

QUESTION:

But they did it for a couple of

years, anyway?
MR. KLEKNER:

18

QUESTION:

20

We never did any discovery on

that, so the answer is, we have no way of knowing.

17

19

I can't --

Do you know whether they operated at

12

14

Several years.

Correct.

They were only an arcade and there

was no selling going on when they were initially launched?
MR. KLEKNER:

It's my understanding that they

21

might have sell -- excuse me, sold some books, or what-

22

have-you, but their primary business was having a series

23

of video booths where you could watch adult movies.

24
25

QUESTION:

I get the opposite impression.

I was misled by the briefs.

Maybe

I thought they had always

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

operated as a combined business.

2

MR. KLEKNER:

3

You say that's wrong?

Not based upon the facts as I

understand them, sir.

4

QUESTION:

Pardon?

5

MR. KLEKNER:

Not based upon the facts as I

6

understand them, that -- and I believe in 1991 it was

7

Alameda Books that became both, and it was I think 1992

8

that Highland Books became both.

9

or so, but there was a point in time where both -- where

10

I might be off by a year

each location became both adult business activities.
QUESTION:

11

I'd like to ask you -- I'll assume

12

with you for the moment you don't need any evidence.

13

suppose you don't imagine -- forget the evidence question.

14

All right, I take it that this ordinance -- and I'm also

15

assuming it, assuming this, you could have a particular

16

place, 5,000 feet of books, or you could have 5,000 cubic

17

feet of books, or you could have 5,000 cubic feet of

18

arcade, but you couldn't have 5,000 cubic feet of both,

19

all right.

20

that?

Now, my question is, what's the theory behind

MR. KLEKNER:

21

I

The theory is the solution, not

22

the facts.

If you go from jurisdiction to jurisdiction,

23

the facts tend to support the same conclusion, that

24

concentrations of adult businesses cause secondary

25

effects.

How do you solve that problem?

And the city's

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

decision was, because of the clustering effect, we termed

2

it like a farmer's market type of effect for adult

3

businesses, that dispersal was the solution.

4

Square footage, you could have 5,000 square feet

5

of this, or maximum, is a different solution, based upon,

6

New York did that in their solution.

7

the space limitation, square foot limitation was

8

appropriate for New York.

That was not part of the

9

solution for Los Angeles.

It was a complete dispersal

10
11

They decided that

of -QUESTION:

All right.

Now, if, in fact, there

12

is no space limitation, I would repeat my question, that

13

it seems a fortiori if you can have a bookstore of

14

gigantic size, or an arcade of gigantic size, but you

15

can't have the two together, even of a little size, so I

16

don't -- I'm not talking about evidence.

17

though, you have to have some theory, and the theory has

18

to be a reasonable one, and it can't just be we want to

19

censor everything, so what's the theory?

20

MR. KLEKNER:

I'm assuming,

The theory is simply the solution

21

adopted by the city of Los Angeles was to disperse.

If,

22

in fact, we were faced with the megastore concept that,

23

you know, the Wal Mart of adult bookstores, then that

24

would be a different problem, that we could address in the

25

future, at least as I understand this Court's precedent,

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

but that's what we were faced with in 1977.

2

with the need to protect the city's neighborhoods from a

3

lot of smaller businesses, if you will, and the solution

4

was, we'll trade size, if you will, for dispersal.

5

York, for example, said 500 --

6

QUESTION:

We were faced

New

But it still doesn't answer the

7

question, exactly.

If the city wanted to address the

8

concentration of adult businesses, certainly the 1977

9

study likewise addressed that, didn't it?

10

MR. KLEKNER:

11

QUESTION:

Correct.

But now we're talking about an

12

ordinance that doesn't focus on the concentration of adult

13

businesses but, rather, the combination, because the city

14

doesn't want the business to break into two parts, even

15

though it tried to operate as one business, and I guess

16

the 1977 study didn't address the combination, the effects

17

of a combination of focuses in a single business, whereas

18

your ordinance does.

19

MR. KLEKNER:

20

QUESTION:

21

Well --

As opposed to a concentration of

businesses.
MR. KLEKNER:

22

There are several responses to the

23

question.

The first is that, as you -- as I understand

24

how you use the term, business, you're talking about a

25

corporate organization or a single proprietorship.

That

1

3
4

is not what the city's ordinance deals with.
QUESTION:

-- operated as a single store, a

single business.
MR. KLEKNER:

From the city's perspective, it is

5

illogical, or not reasonable to say, for the city council

6

to say, you know we have a problem here, on LaSeneca

7

Boulevard, because we have two many adult businesses

8

together, so we're going to require them to disperse.

9

There is no issue as to how we define these adult

10
11
12

businesses.

That's not before the Court.

QUESTION:

Well, what if the ban were, you can

sell adult VHS tapes but not Beta tapes in the same store?

13

MR. KLEKNER:

14

QUESTION:

We haven't done that, and --

Well, it's the same thing.

Can you

15

break it down any way you want and say, it's fine because

16

we're concerned about the --

17

MR. KLEKNER:

Because we are concerned with the

18

overall effect we have broken down the ordinance to its

19

local components.

20

dice definitions so that you have several different types

21

of retail adult establishments.

22

QUESTION:

We have not tried to somehow slice and

Do all of the categories that you

23

have in the ordinance exist in the real world out there,

24

video arcades only?

25

MR. KLEKNER:

Yes.

They did in 1977.

They did

have coffee, and all that, or go to a record shop and

natural combination, unlike having half of my

The problem with your real-world

description of a Barnes and Noble is, it doesn't exist in

the adult entertainment world.

before the trial court was that the books, the magazines,

3

the sex toys, the novelties, are all shrink-wrapped.

4

cannot go into an adult bookstore, sit down and have your

5

Starbucks, and browse through the material.

QUESTION:

The evidence that was

You

And you don't prevent them -- you

7

don't prevent these stores from allowing customers to

8

preview the films before they decide whether to buy them,

9

the stores that sell adult films.

The ordinance doesn't

10

prevent them from allowing customers, at no charge, to

11

view the films before they buy them, does it?

12
13
14

MR. KLEKNER:

If I understand the correct -- the

question correctly, no.
QUESTION:

Under the ordinance, can a customer

15

come in and say, before I buy this film, I would like to

16

see it, and the store manager says sure, go ahead, look at

17

it first, then you can decide whether to buy it?

MR. KLEKNER:

MR. KLEKNER:

For free?

For free.
Yes.

The ordinance permits that anyway,

doesn't it?

MR. KLEKNER:

QUESTION:

25

MR. KLEKNER:

We are talking about --

But they want to charge for it.
And the machines that allow you to

Alderson Reporting Company

1

view up to 60 clips, if you will, from various adult

2

movies, or you go to another machine in another booth, you

3

can -- I want to see that entire movie right there, as

4

opposed to the clips.
QUESTION:

5

What is your principal argument in

6

opposition to the rationale in the court of appeals?

7

have the feeling we're not letting you make the principal

8

argument here that you wanted to make.
MR. KLEKNER:

9

I

The principal problem with the

10

court of appeals decision is, of course, how it

11

requires -- what it requires, the use of secondary effects

12

and how it is discounts, if you will, or disregards this

13

Court's precedent, is effectively what the court of

14

appeals has said.

15

evidence of secondary effects in general, which the city

16

does have, but you must also show that in this particular

17

case this combination contributes to that secondary

18

effects, which I submit is going to be, on an empirical

19

basis, next to impossible to do.
QUESTION:

20

Not only must we have empirical

The third --

If it's next to impossible to do, why

21

should you be allowed, under the First Amendment, to do

argument from spectral evidence here.

well, the evidence that we've got doesn't demonstrate the

25

problem that we're addressing, but we ought to be able to

2

to?

3

I mean, isn't that what it boils down

MR. KLEKNER:

The problem we were addressing

4

was, is there a correlation, to use the term you used, the

5

word you used in Barnes --

6

QUESTION:

Yes.

7

MR. KLEKNER:

-- between the adult businesses

8

and secondary effects, do they cause a problem.

9

documented that.

10

QUESTION:

We have

And you've documented it, but as I

11

understand it, you've documented it with reference to

12

adult businesses which were not at the time defined or

13

identified as necessarily being businesses that offered

14

only one service, as opposed to a business like these,

15

that offers two, so that the evidence, as I understand it,

16

did not address the issues that is before us now.

17

MR. KLEKNER:

But it did address that issue,

18

because it is not reasonable to assume that if you have

19

two businesses side by side in the same block, causing

20

secondary effects, that it can require them to disperse,

21

which is entirely --

22

QUESTION:

Yes, but we're -- I think we're

23

playing with words.

24

side by side, and you were measuring the effects back in

25

'78 of businesses side-by-side.

You're talking about two businesses

MR. KLEKNER:

It's one business that sells two

You measured -- you measured the

effect of a video store -- what do you call these, arcade

10

store, and a bookstore side-by-side, and you found that

11

that was deleterious, and the problem is that you did not

12

measure what the different effect would be if you knocked

13

down the wall between them.

14

believe that that would make a difference?
MR. KLEKNER:

15

Is there any reason to

city's been trying to make all along.

There's no

You can't assume --

18

QUESTION:

Well, you don't know --

19

MR. KLEKNER:

20

QUESTION:

-- less or more.

How do you know that, any more than I

21

know it?

I mean, I see your point when you say, look, if

22

there are two different entrepreneurs on a block, each of

23

them doing whatever they can to draw in clientele, the

24

odds are they're probably going to draw in a greater

25

concentration of people than one.

I mean, I will accept

side-by-side entities that merge are, on the one hand, a

24

25

they're going to be drawing the same concentrations of

people that they would have as separate entities.

2

But when you're talking about combinations like

3

books and video, it isn't obvious that you're going to be

4

drawing different concentrations of people, and I think

5

what we're stuck with here is that your evidence, through

6

no fault of Los Angeles in '78, but your evidence just

7

doesn't address the question as specifically as we have it

8

before us now.
MR. KLEKNER:

9

If you look at the nature of the

10

businesses, you come to an arcade to stay there and look,

11

and when you leave that arcade, you have a different frame

12

of mind than if you went to the bookstore, got your

13

shrink-wrapped magazine, put it in a brown paper bag, and

14

went home, so that's one logical deduction you can make

15

from all of the evidence that's before you.
QUESTION:

16

Isn't it an equally logical deduction

17

that by looking at the cover of the shrink-wrapped

18

magazine and watching part of a video clip, or a video

19

clip of something that you ultimately buy, you're going to

20

be left in about the same frame of mind in either case?
MR. KLEKNER:

21

No.

I think after watching 60

22

clips from adult business, from adult videos, as opposed

23

to the cover of a shrink-wrapped magazine -- the only

Correct.

It seems to assume the city did not

study the combination but, rather, relied on judicially

approved statutory precedent from other jurisdictions.

assume that's some reference to the Hart case from the

Carolinas.

QUESTION:

No, what the Ninth --

-- of the arcades, rather than the

effects on crime.
MR. KLEKNER:

What the Ninth Circuit effectively

said was, there was some doubt whether Hart would survive

10

scrutiny under this Court's Renton decision, but we are

11

certainly confident that under Ninth Circuit precedent

12

it's not a valid law.

13

QUESTION:

The purpose of Hart --

I don't know, it just struck me in

14

reading the question that it was pretty much limited to

15

whether they were right about whether you could rely on

16

the Hart decision.

17

MR. KLEKNER:

Hopefully not.

The city in 1983

18

specifically relied on its findings in 1977, the study

19

that led up to the original ordinance, which as I said is

20

not at issue.

MR. KLEKNER:

That's correct, that in 1979, our

sufficient evidentiary basis.

QUESTION:

The Ninth Circuit thought that Hart

relied on the negative health effects of the arcade.
MR. KLEKNER:

We are less -- we, the city, is

10

less concerned with the factual differences than with the

11

legal reasoning and the fact that it fully supports, and

12

should have been considered for that purpose by the Ninth

13

Circuit, as validating the intent and purpose of the

14

original ordinance and '83's amendment.

That's what hopefully the -- well,

21

that's what the city has been trying to do, but again, it

22

goes back to, you know, if you look at your precedents,

23

when a city has these problems, the logical -- the logical

24

thing for the city to do is say, ban them.

25

It's a violation of the Constitution.

We can't.

We accept that.

evidence of, are you a bad actor, this particular business

19

is a bad actor, it's a very detailed nuisance type of

20

analysis, and when you have these combinations of adult

21

businesses, or side-by-side adult businesses, and you try

22

to do that same analysis, the immediate thing that is

going to occur, the first thing that is going to occur,

question.

so forth and so on.

13

there that follow the pattern of this particular

14

ordinance, that would prohibit a single business from

15

operating both a video arcade and a bookstore in the same

location?

We often have said, the cities can rely on

Are there a lot of ordinances out

MR. KLEKNER:

There are some, Justice Stevens.

There are others that would permit such combinations,

depending upon how the city that's -- a particular

jurisdiction analyzed the solution.

QUESTION:

That's an adjective.

2

MR. KLEKNER:

3

QUESTION:

Excuse me, yes.

May I go back to Justice O'Connor's

4

question, because she asked how the Hart facts could help

5

you.

6

the basis for municipal action in that case was public

7

health, and it was public health based on the sexual

8

activities that were going on inside the booths, and as I

9

understand it, Los Angeles in effect has an ordinance that

10

requires open booths, lights on, freely seen -- the booths

11

can be freely seen from the front of the store, and so on,

12

so it seems to me that Los Angeles has taken steps to

13

preclude the health problem that that earlier case

14

addressed and, if that's so, how could that earlier case

15

support the Los Angeles ordinance?

16

As I understand it, the facts in that -- number 1,

MR. KLEKNER:

Well, again, the Hart reading of

17

facts in that decision, again go to the fact that these

18

combinations cause problems, and that the city's

19

ordinance -- excuse me, the city's study supported the

20

inference that it's okay to -- the solution is to separate

21

these businesses.

22

QUESTION:

Yes, but the Hart -- as I under --

23

maybe I'm wrong, but I thought the basis for the

24

governmental action in Hart was public health based on the

25

activity that was going on in these booths.

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:
At the time we filed our briefs, we knew of no

MR. WESTON:

Justice Scalia, forgive me, I can

19

only tell you what the circumstances were.

The

20

phraseology that was utilized tried to use the

21

terminology, the confusing terminology that Los Angeles

22

used in terms of its description of what a use is, and Mr.

23

Wiener at the time sold and displayed vast quantities of

24

sexually oriented retail materials in the same stores, but

25

under the L.A. ordinance at the time, it did not

30
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

constitute an adult use.
QUESTION:

2

Well, I appreciate your testimony to

3

that effect, but what his affidavit clearly says is that

4

the only adult business he did prior to 1991 was the

5

exhibition of adult videotapes.

available for retail sale were of a nonadult variety.

15

ordinance which defined a use and labeled a use a

16

business, and the only way that one became an adult

18

in trade was 51 percent or more adult.

19

Prior to June of 1991, the only adult type of

Mr. Wiener's was not.

it was not a preponderance, and therefore the notion that

As an adult business.
Adult use or business, that's

correct.
QUESTION:

Right, okay, but it doesn't mean that

11

if you have 51 percent in one adult business and 49

12

percent in another adult business, the 49 percent is not

13

an adult business?

14

Does it mean that as well?

MR. WESTON:

That is correct.

The 49 percent of

15

adult retail material did -- acted to -- let me -- if I

16

may phrase it the other way.

17

at a business in Los Angeles, if it was adult, made that

18

store adult, even if it was 20,000 total items, and

19

virtually, and nearly 10,000 of them had nothing to do

and that was the 49 percent.

The record does not reflect that,

Justice Ginsburg.

6

of course, the opposite may have also been true.

7

That may have been the fact although,

QUESTION:

But it's true that it would not have

8

been considered an adult bookstore so long as they

maintained that 51-49.

10

MR. WESTON:

That's correct, and if I may, as in

11

Hart, Mr. Wiener's initial businesses, as they were

12

initially constituted, did not conflict with the multiple

13

use provision, notwithstanding the fact that 100 percent

14

of the videotapes viewed in them were adult, and 49

15

percent or up to 49 percent of the retail items available

16

for sale were also adult.

But can I -That did not constitute two adult

MR. WESTON:

3

QUESTION:

Yes, Justice Breyer.
And don't assume I know a lot of the

4

detail that you know.

I want to start this naively, so I

5

take it what they're saying is, look, we have a zoning

6

ordinance.

7

single business.

8

said, selling liquor wholesale is one thing, selling it at

9

a bar is another, so that's two uses, not one.

We have to have some way of defining what's a
If it were a liquor ordinance and we

If it were

10

a meat store which said, over-the-counter is one thing, at

11

the restaurant is another -- of course we could do it a

12

million ways.

13

MR. WESTON:

14

QUESTION:

Certainly.
But we have to do it some way, and so

15

forget whether there's evidence or not.

16

what's reasonable here, and this is one, and by the way,

17

if it were a different kind of ordinance, if it were a

18

cubic foot limitation, the fact that they counted it as

19

two separate things rather than one, would cut in your

20

favor, but here it happens to cut against you.

21

MR. WESTON:

22

QUESTION:

Well -But they say, either way, we're just

23

trying to have a reasonable definition.

24

your response is what?

25

MR. WESTON:

Just let us do

All right, now

Well, initially. I think Your

34
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Honor -- Justice Breyer, you have characterized fairly in

2

some sense the city's position, because the city basically

3

says, so logistically, if it's an adult business it

4

generates secondary effects, and if there is secondary

5

effects and there is adult business regulation not

6

amounting to a ban, we can do anything we want, and courts

7

are directed not to look meaningfully at it, and it simply

8

gets dealt with as a valid ordinance.

9

But the problem with what Los Angeles has done

10

is that, unlike what would be logical, or unlike what most

11

zoning agencies do, which is to take a combined business

12

such as Your Honor posits and zone it according to the

13

most intense of the combined uses, Los Angeles, for

14

example, makes reference to the fact that it deals with

15

service stations and auto repair places differently, but

16

the remedy that Los Angeles selects for that is not to

17

say, an auto repair place must be here, and 1,000 feet

18

away there must be a place where you -- I've said it

19

poorly, but that you cannot have an auto repair place

20

here, combined with a place that pumps gas, even though

21

there are separate uses.

22

as every city does, is permit the combination and then

23

zone the combination use according to the most intense of

24

the combined uses.

25

QUESTION:

What Los Angeles logically does,

No, but that's a bad analogy, because

35
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

auto places are not -- try liquor.

2

liquor, and probably they could.

3

one liquor license in 1,000 feet, and if you have a bar

4

you don't have a shop, and it then becomes less obviously

5

unreasonable on its face.

6

MR. WESTON:

7

QUESTION:

8

Try thinking of it
They'd say, we only want

Let's take a -So let's assume it in their favor

that way, and then argue against it.
MR. WESTON:

9

Sure.

Let's take a look at that

10

one.

11

combined use, it simply again -- I don't mean Los Angeles.

12

In your hypothetical, in the bar-restaurant, the zoning

13

regulation would be appropriate for the more intense use,

14

I assume --

15

But what does Los Angeles do?

QUESTION:

It doesn't ban the

But this whole question is something

16

that's secondary.

17

whether or not Los Angeles is reasonable in saying that

18

the combined use draws more people without having a study.

19

I fully understand that you have an objection to the

20

Government bifurcating your business.

21

table, so the only question is whether or not this whole

22

business draws more people, and whether or not there's an

23

empirical basis for it.

24

decide here?

25

I thought the question before me is

MR. WESTON:

Leave that off the

Isn't that what I'm supposed to

I'm not quite sure about drawing

more people.

2

was not the focus of what Los Angeles was concerned --

3

I don't think that that was what the -- that

QUESTION:

You mean, you had the arcade because

4

it didn't draw any more people?

5

MR. WESTON:

No, it wasn't more people, it was

6

the notion for a variety of reasons, and if we return to

7

Young v. American Mini Theatres, there is at least --

8

there's some indication in Young that it's not simply a

9

question of people, but rather, what is the perception

10
11

from the outside world?
QUESTION:

Well,

but not simply a question of

12

people, but surely the kind of secondary effects that have

13

been spoken of in cases depend upon people's activities,

14

and the people aren't 10 miles away, they're somehow

15

associated with the business.

16

MR. WESTON:

Certainly.

I -- that's

17

unquestionably reasonable, Mr. Chief Justice, but the

18

articulation by Los Angeles in its statement of

19

legislative purpose, which appears at -- it's at page 74

20

of the appendix to the petition for certiorari, and I'm

21

truncating it, but two or more adult entertainment

22

businesses, operated as a single commercial enterprise.

23

This concentration of adult entertainment businesses tends

24

to have an adverse impact on the neighborhood in which

25

they are located.

37
Alderson Reporting Company

1

The hypothesis, the asserted harm, was from a

2

combination of adult businesses, and what was the evidence

3

on which Los Angeles relied for this proposition?

4

sole evidence was a study that measured not, as has been

5

brought out earlier, whether there were harms unique,

6

there were special harms that developed from a combination

7

of two businesses within a single unitary establishment,

8

but rather, whether there were secondary effects that

9

resulted from the clustering of a dozen, or 15 or 20

10
11

The

unrelated adult businesses.
QUESTION:

At some point, Mr. Weston, don't you

12

think the legislature is entitled to draw what might be

13

common sense inferences from the studies that it made, and

14

that it doesn't have to have empirical evidence for every

15

single thing that it does in the ordinance?

16

MR. WESTON:

Of course not, Your Honor, and for

17

example, if the city, as it suggests, which we do not

18

agree with, really thought -- I don't mean to cast

19

aspersions on the city.

20

that this adult bookstore-arcade combination was so unique

21

and so unusual, even though there's no evidence in the

22

record of an arcade standing alone anywhere int he United

23

States, except as part of an adult bookstore, but if it

24

was so unique that they really hadn't dealt with it, one

25

could understand that it would be appropriate, as the city

If, in fact, the city's sense

38
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

has, to accord zoning treatment to this combined use,

2

which is exactly what was done here.
The combined use is not free from the zoning

3
4

requirements of the City of Los Angeles.

5

use is 1,000 feet away from any other adult use.

6

feet from any of the protected sensitive areas, and it is

7

within the limited commercial zones which the city says it

8

has to be.

MR. WESTON:

QUESTION:

Thank you, Justice Scalia.
On -I'm going to go home now.

I thank the Court for its courtesy.

This is a memorable day for me.
It seems to me that if you're

20

objecting to the municipality's use of this other study,

21

which didn't treat combined stores, you -- it seems to me

22

you have to tell us why it would be likely that combining

23

the diverse businesses under one roof could make any

24

difference.

25

whole block full of adult businesses, a video store, a

I mean, you have situation 1.

You have a

39
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

movie house, a bookstore, blah, blah, blah, okay, the

2

whole block full.
Situation 2, you have the same block.

3

They're

4

just not different stores.

5

it's just Adult, Inc., and on one side there's the, you

6

know, the arcade, and then the next part of the store

7

there's the movie house, and so forth.

8

would there be any difference in the two situations as far

9

as its impact upon the community is concerned?
MR. WESTON:

10

It's just one big -- you know,

Why in the world

There are a number of responses to

11

that, and they require a bit of articulation.

12

little bit different, and as I was starting to say before

13

in terms of Young v. American Mini Theatres, the sole

14

evidence, essentially, in Young v. American Mini Theatres

15

was an affidavit submitted by a man by the name of Mel

16

Ravitz.

17

They're a

In that case, one of the things that Ravitz

18

stressed -- and this was, of course, the first

19

concentration zoning, the first case that upheld

20

discriminatory zoning in a sense of motion picture

21

theaters according to the nature of the content of the

22

materials exhibited there, and the basis was, of course,

23

that the reason for the legislation was not because of the

24

materials but, rather, because of some unique secondary

25

effects associated with them, and this was a very unusual

40
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

ordinance.

2

to which Detroit, long after the original ordinance had

3

been adopted, added adult businesses, and Ravitz' point

4

was this, that there's a self-fulfilling prophecy that

5

develops in a neighborhood when residents or prospective

6

new residents or business people or whatever come into a

7

neighborhood and they see lots and lots and lots of

8

different storefronts, let's say soup kitchen, a rescue

9

mission, pawn shops, adult bookstore, Sam's Adult Arcade,

10

It was an anti-Skid Row ordinance originally

or even your excellent idea, the adult emporium --

11

(Laughter.)

12

MR. WESTON:

-- and as a result, this then

13

becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy of the imminent decline

14

of a neighborhood.

15

So from the Young perspective, from the sense of

16

declining property values, it becomes very different from

17

having the eight or nine adult businesses to which Your

18

Honor referred to close proximity in one block, or two

19

blocks, which all of a sudden says tenderloin, or red

20

light district, or whatever, as opposed to one single

21

storefront that says, Highland Books, and which does not

22

cause the visual --

23

QUESTION:

But it doesn't have to say that.

I

24

mean, they're entitled to, you know, to divide the

25

storefront into each of its components and have a sign on

41
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

one that says, you know, adult videos, and then in the

2

next bay have a sign that says, movies, and then the next

3

bay, adult books, and so forth.

MR. WESTON:

QUESTION:

MR. WESTON:

But that's no different -I don't see any difference between -But that's no different, Justice

7

Scalia, from a single 7-11 store that says, bananas for

sale, 99 cents today, rutabagas a dollar and a half, and

9

Coca-Colas on sale here.

10

QUESTION:

It's --

Mr. Weston, in that respect, would

11

you be making the same argument that you are now making

12

for tapes plus arcade, sales of tapes plus arcade, if the

13

combined uses were a massage parlor and an adult hotel?

14

MR. WESTON:

That's a very fair and good

15

question, and I've been thinking about that one for a

16

long, long time, and I think the easy answer to it is

17

simply that with respect to the massage parlor there would

18

be no First Amendment interest to protect, and therefore

19

it wouldn't raise the question.

20

lawyer's answer.

21

you're, obviously what, Justice Ginsburg --

Now, that's a cute

It doesn't really help, I know, what

thing about the adult motel.

Absolutely, and -Although some people might consider

Alderson Reporting Company

1

that expression.
MR. WESTON:

2

Absolutely, and in fact I did say

3

that in FW/PBS v. City of Dallas, when one of the three

4

components was an adult motel, but interestingly -- and

5

I'll try to address the combination question, but

6

interestingly, and this is one of the things that makes

7

the L.A. study suspect to begin with, is that of the 88

8

adult uses that were focused on by the police department

9

and the planning department in Hollywood, 41 of them -- I

10

beg your pardon.

Of the 9 -- of the 88 uses, 41 of them

11

were either massage parlors or adult motels.
QUESTION:

12

Well, I don't think that question is

13

fairly subsumed in the question presented.

14

don't think there was any challenge below to the validity

15

of the '77 study so far as it went.
MR. WESTON:

16

I mean, I

No, you're exactly right, Mr. Chief

17

Justice, there wasn't a challenge specifically to it, but

18

as we -QUESTION:

21

challenge to it?

22

There wasn't a challenge specifically

Are you suggesting there was some unspecific

MR. WESTON:

The specific challenge that was

23

made was whether the study supported the city's stated

24

purpose that combining a bookstore and an arcade in one

25

establishment, in one physical structure, caused the kinds

43
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

of problems, the only problems which the study evaluated

2

and found and, in fact, in the city's own papers it makes

3

clear, and we set this forth in page 2 of the respondent's

4

appendix, we note to it, rather, in joint appendix 109,

5

that on the contrary, the --

9

MR. WESTON:

10

The red brief, in page 2?
Forgive me, Mr. Chief Justice.

11

I've misspoken.

12

page 109, there is language from the study that points out

13

several respondents commented that the adverse effects,

14

secondary effects, are related to the degree of

15

concentration, and that one freestanding business may

16

have no effect, and that's really what we're talking

17

about.

18

At joint appendix, the beige document,

Justice Ginsburg, with respect to your question,

19

could there be some issues with respect to combined uses,

20

our great fear in terms of the parsing argument that we

21

have made is that if the city's novel and rather

22

adventurous piece of legislation is upheld, that the next

23

step, as inevitably as night follows the day, will be to

24

parse these business into smaller and smaller kinds of

25

subcomponents that --

MR. WESTON:

QUESTION:

You said books,

Massages don't.
Right, and I -Yes, but what about combining a

8

motion theater and a bookstore?

9

MR. WESTON:

I would -- one would think that the

10

same kind of analogy as we have offered here would be

11

present, that with a motion picture theater and a

12

bookstore there would appear to be no logical suggestion

13

that the two of them would generate any greater secondary

14

effects than the motion picture theater alone.

got into area --

16

QUESTION:

When we

Well, look at it a little

differently.

18

bookstores being functionally connected, but with

19

bookstores and motion pictures, I think the outburst

20

argument has quite a lot of appeal.

22

should it not violate the ordinance if you combine them?

23

I understand your argument about arcades and

MR. WESTON:

If you had them

Well, I'm not sure that the

24

separate ownership is what constitutes the vice aimed at

25

at the ordinance.

It's rather that by the city's unusual

definitional situation of calling different media

presentations or different uses different businesses, in

3

the same sense like at a 7-11 the dairy section is a

4

business and the --

5

QUESTION:

It seems to me if you have a 7-11 and

6

an A&P next door, it's the same problem as if they're

7

owned by the same owner.

8

you get to motion pictures and bookstores.

9

I don't follow the argument when

It seems to me that those two businesses

10

operated by separate owners would have precisely the same

11

secondary effect as a single business operating both a

12

motion picture and a bookstore.

13

MR. WESTON:

Why am I wrong on that?

I'm not aware of any data that

14

would suggest that the combination would -- the

15

combination in, Justice Stevens, in your hypothetical that

16

a theater and a bookstore together, I'm not aware of any

17

data that would lead one to reasonably conclude that the

18

combination of a retail use in a motion picture theater

19

would generate more secondary effects than what I assume

20

would be the more intense use, the motion picture theater

21

operating alone.

QUESTION:

Well, you conceded a moment ago --

secondary effects as just this look that the neighborhood

2

has by having the businesses strung along the block, but

3

secondary effects is also the number of people come who

4

loiter, who drive around, who concentrate outside.

5

that is a secondary effect that it seems to me would be

increased by the two uses.

I think that's fair, Justice

8

Kennedy.

9

than patronage, then I'm not sure that I could argue, but

10

that's not what the identified and hypothesized secondary

11

effect is on the part -- from the city, and in analyzing

12

these ordinances, as I understand the Court's doctrine,

13

one looks at the specific legislation and the asserted

14

stated purpose, asserted statement of purpose, which in

15

this case is whether the concentration of -- I should say,

16

the combination of adult businesses within a single

17

unitary establishment causes the same kinds of secondary

18

effects found by a clustering of 12 or 15 or 20 unrelated

19

adult businesses in a very small area in terms of the

20

neighborhood.

21

hypothesis.

22

Certainly, if secondary effects is nothing more

That was the city's hypothesized,

QUESTION:

Yes, but isn't one way to pose that

23

question to pose it the way Justice Kennedy did?

The

24

question is, does the particular combination increase the

25

degree of clientele, because we know that the greater the

47
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

clientele, the greater the crime rate is going to be, so

2

there seems to me to be a factual basis for saying that

3

the clientele is a kind of a surrogate measure for those

4

very effects that the city can legitimately try to

5

counteract.

6

MR. WESTON:

With all respect, Justice Souter, I

7

must question the hypothesis that it is the clientele that

8

will cause the problems.
QUESTION:

9

I would --

The amount of clientele is associated

10

with the problems.

It may be that that clientele is

11

preyed upon by other people who come in, but the fact is,

12

I think, that the study shows an association between the

13

number of people concentration to come to these businesses

14

and the secondary effects of crime, et cetera, that the

15

city can do something to prevent.

16

MR. WESTON:

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. WESTON:

I -That's the hypothesis that I'm -I really don't think so in this

19

instance, because if that were, in fact, the hypothesis of

20

the city, surely, with all of the thought that they have

21

given to this, there would have been an absolute size

22

limitation or a square footage limitation that was part of

23

the legislation to deal just with that problem, but they

24

haven't.

QUESTION:

Maybe they could do that.

we have a one-step-at-a-time principle, that the State

to validate what it has done.

MR. WESTON:

Maybe it should prohibit

It will get there when that

And I suppose we'll be back here

10

then having to address that.

11

QUESTION:

You seem to be arguing that we should

12

decide this case on the assumption that the city's

13

evidence, as it now exists, would not be a sustainable

14

basis for an ordinance saying, you can't have two -- you

15

can't have 25 different adult uses in one arcade.

16

want us to decide -- are you saying that you're going to

17

go for broke, that we've either got to sustain that

18

proposition, or you lose?

19

mean, my question was mean to suggest that there's a

20

factual difference in degree.

21

obvious that if you put 20 of these uses in one business,

22

you're going to bring in a lot of people, going to have a

lot of problems.

Do you
