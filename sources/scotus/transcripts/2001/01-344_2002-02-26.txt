CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

4

now in Number 01-344, Tommy G. Thompson v. The Western

5

States Medical Center.

Mr. Kneedler.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. KNEEDLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

It has long been a fundamental requirement of

12

the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act that a new drug

13

may not be marketed unless it has first been found by the

14

Food and Drug Administration to be safe and effective for

15

its intended use.

16

Congress concluded that the protection of the

17

public health requires that safety and effectiveness be

18

rigorously established by scientifically valid studies

19

rather than the impressions of individual doctors, and

20

also that persons who promote and distribute new drugs

21

should be the ones to undertake the studies necessary to

22

establish their safety effectiveness.

23

In 1997, Congress carved out a narrow exception

24

to the new drug approval and certain other requirements of

25

the Food and Drug Act for certain compounding by

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

pharmacists.

2

referred to as extemporaneous compounding.

3

compounding undertaken in response to a physician's

4

prescription based on the idiosyncratic needs of a

5

particular patient.

6

on an existing relationship among the pharmacist,

7

physician, and patient.

8
9

The exemption is addressed to what is often
That is,

Such compounding is typically based

Congress provided in section 353(a), which it
enacted in 1997, that the exemptions from the new drug

10

approval and other requirements of the act would be

11

limited, and available only in circumstances that

12

conformed to extemporaneous compounding by pharmacists.

13

QUESTION:

Mr. Kneedler, a moment ago you say

14

this is based on an existing relationship between the

15

physician, the druggist, and the patient.

16

by that term?

17
18

MR. KNEEDLER:

What is meant

Well, I -- it's based on the

relationship.

19

QUESTION:

Well, I could tell that.

20

MR. KNEEDLER:

Typically an existing

21

relationship in the sense that the need for compounding

22

often arises where there may be a commercially available

23

product that maybe the physician has prescribed, but it

24

might -- or would have otherwise prescribed, but it might

25

contain an ingredient to which the patient is allergic, or

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

it may come in a dosage that would be inappropriate for a

2

child or an older person, and therefore the physician and

3

the pharmacist would consult and say, the pharmacist would

4

be asked, could you modify this in some way, or develop

5

the same drug without the ingredient, so --

6
7

QUESTION:

The plaintiffs here seem to be

engaged in a Nation-wide business.

8

MR. KNEEDLER:

9

QUESTION:

10

Yes.

They're not a corner --

MR. KNEEDLER:

No, it is -- and the record in

11

the case, the materials submitted in the district court,

12

confirm exactly what you say.

13

that sort of situation.

14

is essentially indistinguishable from that of any

15

manufacturer or producer of drug products that is governed

16

by the manufacturing -QUESTION:

17

This is far different from

They're engaging in conduct that

Well, can't Congress limit the

18

compounding to the ordinary prescription service that we

19

expect pharmacists to be doing?
MR. KNEEDLER:

20
21
22
23
24
25

has done.

And that's exactly what Congress

If I -QUESTION:

Well, but they added this ban on

advertising.
MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, if I could explain, the ban

on advertising is one of the conditions that confine the

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

exemption to traditional extemporaneous compounding.

2

others are, for example, that it has to be on the basis of

3

an unsolicited prescription, that the drug can't be

4

prepared in advance of the prescription except in --

5

QUESTION:

The

Well, don't all those things take

6

care of the Government's interest in problems?

7

justifies the additional ban on promotion and advertising?

8
9

MR. KNEEDLER:

What

That condition is essential to

protecting the integrity of the new drug approval process,

10

for this reason.

11

the introduction of any new drug in interstate commerce

12

must conform with the prior approval requirements of the

13

Food and Drug Act.

14

but what Congress had to do was draw the line between what

15

is extemporaneous compounding and what is not.

16

The general rule under this act is that

QUESTION:

This is a narrow exception from that,

Yes, but what I don't understand is,

17

if Congress can limit in all these other ways the use of

18

compounding of drugs, then why does it need this

19

additional ban?

20

was not necessary, and I think I have the same problem.

21

The court below seemed to think that it

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, I -- first of all, we think

22

that the court of appeals really misunderstood what the

23

governmental interest here -- the -- is here.

24

governmental interest, again, is maintaining the integrity

25

of the Government approval process and making sure that

The

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

those who hold themselves out as marketers and

2

distributors of new drugs comply with those requirements

3

in the same way that any other manufacturer must do.

4

mixing together of ingredients --

5

QUESTION:

Well, is there any allegation here

6

that the ads are false or fraudulent, misleading,

7

deceptive?

8
9

The

I mean, you could always attack that.

MR. KNEEDLER:
point behind this.

But that's not really the basic

Again, no one, whether he holds a

10

pharmacist's license, a physician's license, or not, may

11

manufacture and market drugs in this economy without going

12

through the prior approval requirement, and -QUESTION:

13

And what does manufacture mean?

I

14

mean, that's a problem I have with this case, they

15

manufacture it.

16

thing that the compounder does, puts together two or more

17

other ingredients into a new drug.

The manufacturer does exactly the same

MR. KNEEDLER:

18

I think that's a very important

19

point.

There is nothing distinctive about a pharmacist

20

putting together ingredients to produce a new drug as

21

compared with a traditional manufacturer.

22

QUESTION:

Exactly.

23

MR. KNEEDLER:

But what distinguishes it is that

24

Congress carved out a narrow exception, is the existence

25

of this relationship between the pharmacist, among the

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

pharmacist, the physician, and the patient.
QUESTION:

But why does that -- why does

3

advert -- you see, I don't mind -- don't mind.

I mean,

4

surely Congress can constitutionally limit it to try to

5

prevent evasion of the normal approval process, but there

6

are other ways of limiting it, like saying, as you

7

observed, this particular druggist operates Nation-wide

8

and sells, you know, thousands and thousands of dollars.

9

Fine, put a dollar limit on the amount that any single

10

druggist can do.

Wouldn't that achieve -- the problem is

11

that the Government has sought to achieve its limitation

12

by placing a limitation on speech.

13

MR. KNEEDLER:

14

QUESTION:

15
16

Well --

Why did it have to do that?

Why does

advertising equate with manufacturing?
MR. KNEEDLER:

It -- what it equates with is the

17

marketing of products in the economy, and this is not the

18

only situation under the Food and Drug Act where the

19

advertising that someone does is what triggers regulation.

20

This Court last term in the Buckman decision

21

addressed a very analogous situation, and if I could

22

explain why it's analogous, I think it would be

23

instructive here.

24

FDA is faced with competing considerations.

25

hand there is a rigorous premarket approval process for,

There, the Court pointed out that the

in that case, devices, which is very analogous to the

2

rigorous new drug approval process for drugs, but the

3

Court at the same time recognized that it is permissible

4

for physicians to prescribe for off-label uses,

not on the label, that is

What someone cannot do is market in the

10

trying to draw the line between marketing of drugs and

11

protection of profession -QUESTION:

12

No, but it wasn't a distinction

13

between manufacturers.

14

you're saying it is good for this, that is one of the

15

intended uses, and you have to have gotten approval for

16

that intended use.

17

I mean, that's what did the trick

MR. KNEEDLER:

QUESTION:

20

with manufacturing.

21

I mean, the problem there is, if

Yes, but --

It wasn't an equation of advertising

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, what it is, it's an

22

equation of advertising with what triggers the, in that

23

case the prior approval process and in this case the prior

24

approval process.

When someone holds himself out as

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that person, like every other manufacturer that

2

distributes drugs in the national economy comply.

3

QUESTION:

Mr. Kneedler, would you explain

4

something to me?

Going back before the point where --

5

everybody seems to agree that compounding and

6

manufacturing is no different, but there once was a world

7

when there were mostly corner pharmacists, and there was

8

something called compounding which surely was discrete

9

from manufacturing, and it seems to me that what you

10

described as an exemption for the compounding was the

11

first time that compounding is put together with new

12

manufactured new drugs.

13
14
15

Before the 1997 alteration, how was compounding
dealt with by the FDA?
MR. KNEEDLER:

The FDA had taken the position

16

for quite a while before the 1997 amendments of at least

17

two decades that pharmacy compounding, at least if it

18

included such an indicia of manufacturing as advertising,

19

or large volumes, a number of things that take it out of

20

traditional pharmacy compounding, extemporaneous, and put

21

it into the basically predetermined or planned marketing

22

of a product, that's the line Congress is trying to draw.

23

QUESTION:

But I mean, there's two kinds of

24

compounding.

Let's just say, it's the physician who's

25

prescribing this medication for a child, so it needs to be

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

diluted, pharmacist-diluted, is that manufacturing?

2

MR. KNEEDLER:

It would be producing a new drug

3

within the meaning of the new drug provisions of the act,

4

it would have been prior to 1997.

5

FDA -- FDA formalized its enforcement policy in 1992 to

6

say that compounding that occurs in the normal course, the

7

ordinary course of the practice of pharmacy,

8

extemporaneous compounding that you've described to dilute

9

a commercially available product, or to extract an

The position that

10

ingredient from it, that would be all right, but when the

11

pharmacist stepped out of that role and behaved in ways

12

that a regular producer of drugs subject to the act

13

behaves, then the person is subject to the prior approval,

14

good manufacturing practices requirements of the act,

15

because again, in terms of function, putting together

16

different ingredients to produce a product, whether it's a

17

manufacturer, or whether it is someone with a pharmacy

18

license doing it, that doesn't matter, and the important

19

public health considerations -QUESTION:

20

What you're doing -- tell me if I'm

21

incorrect.

You're equating the size of the market with

22

whether there's manufacturing or compounding, and it seems

23

to me that advertising is not necessarily a good proxy for

24

that.

25

senior citizens, and they have particular success with one

Suppose you had a pharmacy that's near a home for

doctor in compounding a particular drug.

2

I take it if they advertise to the other doctors

3

they take care of these people, now we can compound this

4

drug for you, that that's a violation of the law.

5

think that that's a proxy for being a manufacturer.

6

have the other paradigm of this huge, Nation-wide chain

7

that advertise and they look more like a manufacturer.

8

just don't know that that's an adequate proxy.

I don't
We

Several things in response to

10

that.

11

are directed at single incidents of introducing a new drug

12

into interstate commerce, or a single incident of

13

receiving this branded drug in interstate commerce, so the

14

act applies irrespective of the volume.

15

the magnitude of the public health problem expands as more

16

and more people are affected, but advertising, along with

17

the other conditions Congress put in the act, were a

18

pretty good indication of trying to draw a distinction

19

between traditional pharmacy and what the FDA

22

First of all, the new drug provisions of the act

QUESTION:

Now, obviously

No, but that's based on the size of

the market, I take it.
MR. KNEEDLER:

No, it's based on the undertaking

by the person who is producing, who is trying to put the

24

drug out on the market.

25

offering services and offering drugs.

It's really a difference between

QUESTION:

I'll look at your brief again, but I

2

thought that your whole theory was that advertising is a

3

proxy for market, which is a proxy for manufacturing,

versus the compounding.

your case.

MR. KNEEDLER:

I thought that was the heart of

those consequences.

My point is, though, that the line
It looked at

individual instances of introducing drugs -QUESTION:

Which is why advertising is such an

imprecise proxy.
MR. KNEEDLER:

No, I -- well, with all respect,

14

what the pharmacist can do is advertise his services, his

15

professional services, and what the act does -- this

16

exemption in the act does is, respect that professional

17

service and the relationship that grows out of that

18

professional service.

19

QUESTION:

Which can produce an enormous volume.

20

Under the act, it's perfectly okay to advertise, you know,

21

XYZ pharmacy.

22

in the country, guaranteed lowest prices for all

23

compounded drugs.

24

long as you don't name one particular compound that you're

25

offering, right?

We compound whatever you want, best prices

That advertising's perfectly okay, so

1

MR. KNEEDLER:

2

QUESTION:

Yes.

And that's going to lead to certainly

3

very, very much increased volume.

4

MR. KNEEDLER:

But what that does is conform to

5

the line Congress was trying to draw.

6

advertising of the services, but it does not allow the

7

advertising and therefore the attempt to develop a market

8

for a particular product, or drug.

9

It allows the

Again, the Federal act is concerned with

10

promoting drugs, not services, so when you hold yourself

11

out as someone who says, I will sell drugs -- and if you

12

look at the record in this case, the plaintiffs have

13

advertising that lists a whole variety of drugs available

14

for infertility, for cancer, for things like that.

15

are behaving just like any manufacturer, any -- just like

16

exactly the sorts of persons that the new drug approval

17

and the good manufacturing practice provisions of the act

18

were designed to reach.

They

I want to go back to Justice Kennedy, because I

19
20

would like to extrapolate a little bit on your answer to

21

him.

22

is, it's simply a matter of volume, and you said no, so I

23

said, well, what is it?

I thought, is this the -- what the Congress is after

Now, in my own mind what I thought is, it's the
direction where the demand comes from.

swallow pills and who are undergoing chemotherapy, and

therefore there must be a way of adjusting that pill.

from the pharmacist to the patient to the doctor back to

With others, maybe there's one

Both cases you want the demands for the

the pharmacist.

11

MR. KNEEDLER:

12

QUESTION:

That's exactly right.

The one is promotion and soliciting.

13

The other is the doctor determining there's a genuine need

14

for a special medicine.

15

MR. KNEEDLER:

That's exactly right, and that's

16

exactly what the FDA was referring to and others have

17

referred to as extemporaneous compounding.

18

of the relationship, so Congress -- in carving out this

19

exemption, Congress was doing a number of things.

looking at the --

Suppose, in Justice Breyer's

5

example, that doctors didn't know that this could be done

6

with this pill, and -- but under the statute you're

7

defending, the pharmacy could not advertise to doctors

8

that it can prepare this drug in that way.

9

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, but it -- what it can do,

10

though, is advertise in general terms that it can remove,

11

or it can produce a product that is like a commercial one,

12

but while removing ingredients to which the person may be

13

allergic, or dilute a dosage.

14

critical information -QUESTION:

15

That is enough to get the

Well, how do we know that, because

16

undoubtedly I think what Justice Kennedy said must be

17

right.

18

does prevent the pharmacist from, through advertising,

19

telling the doctor that we have this special way of making

20

drug X.

21

there are counterbalancing positive impacts in preventing

22

the general solicitation of the public, which will produce

23

a demand you don't want.

24
25

One of the negative effects of the statute is, it

That is a negative impact.

On the other hand,

Now, is there anything that tells us how that
comparison breaks down?

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes, and I think the most

2

critical thing that tells us that is the new drug approval

3

provisions of the Food and Drug Act itself, which Congress

4

enacted in 1938 and strengthened in 1962 precisely to

5

reach the conduct of people developing new drugs and

6

advertising and promoting drugs that have not been shown

7

to be safe and effective to individuals or to the public

8

at large.

9

It is the act of -QUESTION:

Yes, but when you have the basic

10

provision that compounding can only be conducted in

11

response to a prescription by a physician, it's hard to

12

understand why it has to be accompanied by a ban on

13

truthful speech about it.

14

MR. KNEEDLER:

15

QUESTION:

Well --

I mean, we've had a long history in

16

this very Court of giving voice to the notion that

17

truthful advertising is acceptable in this country.

18

MR. KNEEDLER:

But the new drug approval

19

provisions of the Food and Drug Act rest on the premise

20

that the judgment of the individual physician is not

21

sufficient.

22

approval and requiring the person who wants to --

23

That is the very purpose of requiring prior

QUESTION:

Yes, but presumably compounding

24

cannot be done without resorting to approve -- the use of

25

approved drugs.

It's diluting it, it's mixing it some way

17
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

for children, it's adding some kind of sweetener so they

2

can swallow it.

3

MR. KNEEDLER:

That's one variation, but again,

4

if you look at the record in this case, there are products

5

that have been compounded that don't resemble that at all.

6

What they are, are people holding themselves out as

7

pharmacists who really see themselves as developing new

cures, not just tinkering with an existing product, but

9

putting --

10

QUESTION:

Mr. Kneedler, isn't it true that --

11

we haven't talked about the severability issue, but as I

12

understand it, the whole statute has been held

13

unconstitutional, because they disagreed with the district

14

court on the severability point.

15

MR. KNEEDLER:

16

QUESTION:

That's correct.

It seems to me that you still can

17

enforce -- I would have thought the parties to be arguing

18

the opposite sides of this case, to tell you the truth.

19

It seemed to me the statute actually helps the

20

compounders, because it makes legal something that is

21

otherwise illegal, and if the statute's knocked out, you

22

have all your enforcement mechanisms to prevent them from

23

doing the mass marketing, don't you?

24
25

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes.

Well, not -- it would

revert to the situation before, in which this would be

18
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

absolutely prohibited.

2

QUESTION:

Right.

3

MR. KNEEDLER:

And FDA would have the

4

discretion, and again it's not just mass marketing, it is

5

the situation, as Justice Breyer described, of where the

6

demand comes from, and -- but more fundamentally, the act

7

rests on the notion that it is fair to require people who

8

hold themselves out and who attempt to develop and exploit

9

a market to go through the new drug approval requirements.

10

QUESTION:

I understand that, but it seems to me

11

that the -- your opponents would be better off if the

12

statute were held to be constitutional than having it held

13

unconstitutional, because you now may prevent them from

14

doing what you're basically saying is the wrong -- is

15

marketing new drugs.
MR. KNEEDLER:

16

Well, you make an important

17

point, because Congress looked at this problem in 1997

18

and, as the committee reports we quote show, it consulted

19

broadly about this and arrived at a consensus about

20

exactly where this dividing line should be between

21

extemporaneous traditional compounding and the traditional

22

kind of promotion of new drugs that the act was directed

23

to.

24
25

QUESTION:

Well, maybe you can't do it that way.

I mean, maybe the Government is just trying to ride two

19
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

horses at the same time, the one horse being that all

2

drugs must be approved by the FDA and the other one being,

3

well, we're going to let, you know, drugs that are

4

prescribed, special drugs prescribed by doctors are okay,

5

and we're going to ride both of these horses at the same

6

time by imposing a restriction on truthful advertising.

7

mean, just maybe you can't do that.

8

MR. KNEEDLER:

9

QUESTION:

I mean --

This case --

-- it seems to me that the ultimate

10

problem with the case is that the Government is trying to

11

have it both ways. --

12

MR. KNEEDLER:

13

QUESTION:

Well --

It's trying to say, it's not enough

14

to have the doctor approve this drug.

15

doctors.

16

hand it's saying, well, on the other hand, if it's a

17

doctor and an individual druggist, it's okay.

18

understand why that makes any sense.

19

We want FDA approval.

MR. KNEEDLER:

We don't trust

But then on the other

I don't

The Central Hudson doctrine that

20

this Court has developed for evaluating restrictions on

21

commercial speech, its virtue is that it allows the

22

recognition of these very real problems that regulatory

23

agencies face.

24
25

Again, it's exactly the sort of balance the
Court was addressing in Buckman last term between

20
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

I

1

respecting the integrity and creating incentives for

2

producers to go through the new drug approval process on

3

the one hand, but respecting professional services,

4

existing relationships on the other, and under the Central

5

Hudson analysis, as we explain in our brief, we think this

6

statute easily passes muster, maintaining the integrity of

7

the new drug approval process, and maintaining incentives

8

for manufacturers to go through it is clearly, in our

9

view, a substantial governmental interest.

10

QUESTION:

They're talking about Central Hudson

11

and the narrow tailoring notion, or whether it's

12

sufficiently tailored.

13

I forget the exact language.

I take it you'd have a much stronger case if the

14

prohibition was limited to prohibition of advertising

15

directed at consumers, as opposed to advertising directed

16

at doctors.

17

MR. KNEEDLER:

No, I -- again, the new drug

18

approval process of the act rests on the premises that

19

doctors themselves cannot make independent judgments about

20

the safety and effectiveness of products, and that is --

21

that was a very firm understanding of Congress when it

22

passed the new drug approval process.

23

QUESTION:

Unless they're druggists.

24

they're druggists who don't sell too much.

1

make any sense?

2

MR. KNEEDLER:

But the paradigm that the act was

3

directed to is where there is an approved new drug

4

product, or an approved product on the market, and what

5

the pharmacist is being asked to do is tinker with it a

6

little bit by diluting it, by something on that order, to

7

make it -- to adjust it but not be in the business of

8

developing new cures, or advertising new cures for

9

existing diseases.

10

QUESTION:

No, but I thought just as Justice

11

Scalia did, that you've really got two paradigms in it.

12

One paradigm is, yes, you can't on a broad global scale

13

depend upon the prescriptions of doctors to guarantee that

14

the drugs the patients are going to get are safe.

15

number 1.

16

That's

Number 2 seems to be that so long as you can be

17

sure that the doctor is focusing on what you earlier

18

called sort of the idiosyncracies of a particular patient,

19

so long as we know the doctor is really paying attention

20

to detail, we can tolerate it up to a point, and the

21

problem that the Congress I thought was addressing is, how

22

do we draw the line so that we don't get a situation in

23

which the doctor seems to be addressing idiosyncracies,

24

i.e., he writes a prescription, but the volume gets so

25

great that you know that that is not going on, and the act

22
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

seems to have two different answers.

2

advertise, because we know what that may lead to, and the

3

other answer is, a restriction on volume that pharmacies

4

can write, or can produce.

5

One answer is, don't

The question, I guess, that's bothering all of

6

us is, why do you need the advertising in addition to the

7

volume restriction.

8

can have it both ways by enforcing the volume restriction.

9
10

MR. KNEEDLER:

QUESTION:

Then have a narrower volume

restriction.

13

MR. KNEEDLER:

14

QUESTION:

15
16

The volume restriction is on the

aggregate number of compounded drugs.

11
12

You can have it both ways, and you

But a drug that --

Why can't a narrow volume restriction

work?
MR. KNEEDLER:

A drug-by-drug volume restriction

17

would be extraordinarily difficult to administer, with

18

thousands and thousands of pharmacies across the country,

19

and having to keep track of particular patient's names --

20

QUESTION:

Then have a lower -- then why not

21

have a lower aggregate?

22

MR. KNEEDLER:

Again, Congress, we think, was

23

entitled to look at the conduct of the pharmacist and take

24

the pharmacist at his word.

25

pharmacist --

If he stops being a

Alderson Reporting Company

1

QUESTION:

No, but that begs the question,

2

because you know, the question is, under Central Hudson,

3

is the pharmacist entitled to have his word, and --

4

MR. KNEEDLER:

5

QUESTION:

Well, under --

And why can the object not be

6

accomplished by restrictions in volume rather than

7

restrictions on speech?

8

MR. KNEEDLER:

9

Because the restrictions on

volume is directed at the overall character of the

10

pharmacist.

The restriction on the solicitation and

11

advertising of a particular product is exactly what the

12

Food and Drug Act is directed at, which is the promotion

13

of a new drug, not just a volume, but a new drug, and

14

Congress was specifically concerned about that as well.

If I could reserve the balance of my time.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HOWARD M. HOFFMAN

20

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

21
22
23

MR. HOFFMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:
I think in response to some of the Court's

24

questions I would like to give our position, the

25

respondents position and a couple of key points on which

24
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

there may yet be some confusion, and I start with the

2

proposition of why a compounding pharmacist is not a

3

manufacturer, which seems to be a key point before this

4

Court this morning, and I can understand why.

5

Let me address what it is the manufacturer does,

6

how he does it, and what a compounding pharmacist does,

7

and I will also say that there are in these respondents

8

specialty compounding entities so that when the court was

9

concerned about, they sell their compounds Nation-wide,

10

they dispense them Nation-wide, indeed, some of them do,

11

and that's because they happen to specialize in

12

compounding, and do that as a special service,

13

specializing in the interaction, as part of their triad,

14

where they work with patients, they work with the

15

specialist physician to, for example, treat cancers, treat

16

tumors --

17
18
19

QUESTION:

Mr. Hoffman, I take it all of this is

in the record somewhere.
MR. HOFFMAN:

Yes, Your Honor.

It is -- in

20

fact, it's in the affidavits in the lower court and the

21

verified complaints.

22

they are specialists, and they work with infertility

23

specialists, for example, for the purpose of helping

24

childless couples be able to have children.

25

QUESTION:

They work as part of this triad,

May I ask -- you have large companies

25
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

as clients.

Is it lawful, or is it part of the practice

2

to compound a large volume, have an inventory available

3

that you then can advertise to the doctors, consumers that

4

if you prescribe it, we will sell it to you?

5

MR. HOFFMAN:

6

QUESTION:

7

And is that part of the practice that

they follow?

8
9

All that is lawful, and all --

MR. HOFFMAN:

That is not what they do, except

to this limited extent, and I don't want to mislead the

10

Court.

11

in advance before getting prescription orders vast

12

inventories.

13

is yes, they do not.

14

Yes, these compounding pharmacists do not compound

If that was the Court's question, the answer

However, do they not at all pre-compound some

15

inventory, and the answer is yes, they do, because under

16

State laws and under the practice of pharmacy as it is

17

developed, if they know that there is, for a certain

18

compound, a historical ordering pattern, a week --

19

QUESTION:

Under your view of the case, it would

20

be perfectly permissible for them, if they can anticipate

21

a large volume of sales of a particularly tailor-made

22

compound, they could store up a huge inventory and then

23

market it later?

24

MR. HOFFMAN:

25

QUESTION:

No, Your Honor.

Why not?

Over the next week or two, yes.

Why is it limited to the next week or

MR. HOFFMAN:

Mostly shelf life, and we don't

know how long in advance this particular compound -QUESTION:

The shelf life of some of these drugs

is only a week?
MR. HOFFMAN:

No, we don't know that, but we

14

don't want to go further than a week or 2 weeks for the

15

sake of erring on the side of safety.

16

that, we don't want to do that, and that's not what we do.

17

I don't want to leave the impression we stockpile huge

18

inventory amounts, because we don't.

where there's a series of patients that are now under that

treatment to once compound it for that 1 or 2-week period

coming back in again.

23

QUESTION:

We don't need to do

We just do enough

Let me ask you what's going to

24

happen -- the Government for some reason did not raise on

25

certiorari the issue of the severability of the

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

advertising provision, so if it is determined here that we

2

should affirm the judgment below, and the cause is not

3

severable, then do we go back to the old regime, which

4

would allow no leeway for compounding?

5

MR. HOFFMAN:

6

QUESTION:

7

No leeway for compounding.

Do we go

back to a more limited regime for your clients, I assume?

8
9

I'm sorry, it would allow what?

MR. HOFFMAN:

First, we will revert back to the

pre-FDAMA area, whatever that was.

The Government now

10

maintains that this compounding practice, under all

11

circumstances, as they say at page 18 of their opening

12

brief, was always illegal.

13

that.

14

case because it wasn't preserved, but to the extent the

15

Court wants to know about it, there are innumerable

16

provisions in both title 21, which clearly indicate that

17

compounds are not new drugs.

18

acknowledges, even under FDAMA, it would not, and it is

19

not able to submit compounds for pre-market approval,

20

because of the extemporaneous numbers in which the need

21

for them arises.

22

We strongly disagree with

We also believe that it's not an issue before this

The Government itself

I really want to go back, if I may, to

23

manufacturing versus compounding, and that we somehow

24

confuse the fact that once a volume reaches a certain

25

level, it's suddenly manufacturing and not compounding,

28
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

and that isn't the case at all, and let me explain why,

2

and by the way, these are distinctions that are both

3

covered in section 360(a)(1) -- at least one of them is --

4

in title 21 of the United States Code, and also in the

5

State statutes governing pharmacy, and regulating pharmacy

6

of each of the several States.

7

QUESTION:

Mr. Hoffman, in doing that, would you

8

take into account what Mr. Kneedler told us this morning,

9

because I put the question to him, what is the difference,

10

and he said, the Government's position is, compounding is

11

a form of making a new drug, that everything fits under

12

the new drug, and that this section is designed to allow a

13

limited kind of new drug-making.

14

telling us that there are two categories, compounding and

15

manufacturing.

16

drugs and, by the grace of Congress, we're allowing some

17

of those new drugs to escape the full process.

18

In other words, you are

The Government is saying, there are new

Now, you have told us in your brief that there's

19

a bright line between compounding and manufacturing.

20

telling us what that bright line is, will you also say how

21

you respond to the Government that says, we define

22

everything as a new drug?

23

MR. HOFFMAN:

infrequent, on the one hand, and you want to engage in

national advertising on the other hand.

9

MR. HOFFMAN:

10

QUESTION:

I'm sorry, Your Honor.

You say it's so infrequently used,

11

but then you say you want the right to advertise

12

nationally.
MR. HOFFMAN:

13

Let us also talk about the

14

national advertising that we allegedly do, and I don't --

15

I think I will come back to respond to the Court's

16

question.

17

I hope I do.
QUESTION:

You know, you say the national

18

advertising that you allegedly do, well, there's an

19

allegation in your complaint which I presume you don't

20

really want to abandon, that advertising and promotion

21

essential to do business in a market national in scope,

22

and to inform physicians and patients of availability and

23

benefits of the special class, specific classes and types

24

of drugs the plaintiff compounds.

25

MR. HOFFMAN:

But the Government keeps asserting

31
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that what we are advertising is finished products, and

2

they try to impress upon the Court, which is absolutely

3

untrue, that the finished product sits on shelves waiting

4

to be shipped out in bulk to individuals or to middle

5

people.

That's just not what we do.

6

The advertising we do is to tell mostly the

7

scientific community, nurses, medical care providers,

8

mostly physicians, and at that special physicians --

9
10

QUESTION:

Well, you say in your complaint, you

add patients, too.
MR. HOFFMAN:

11

And to patients, yes, that there

12

are ingredients that are capable of being compounded, and

13

then in working with the physician, a mixture of

14

ingredients, together with the inactive ingredients, will

15

be compounded into a delivery format that's best suitable

16

for a patient, be it a suppository form, an injectable

17

form, an oral form, a pill, a patch form, et cetera.
QUESTION:

18

Mr. Hoffman, what you're telling us

19

is something any doctor would know.

20

that things can be compounded and put in various forms.

21

Doesn't your advertising get down to something pretty

22

specific?

23

MR. HOFFMAN:

Of course they know

It is specific in the ingredients

24

that we list as being capable of being put into a compound

25

suitable for a particular patient.

32
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

And don't you key it to a particular

2

compound for a particular condition, or a particular kind

3

of patient?

4

MR. HOFFMAN:

It will lead to a particular

5

compound in a particular dosage, worked out together

6

between the pharmacist, the patient, and the physician --

7

QUESTION:

All right.

Isn't that, therefore,

8

where your argument is weakest?

You're arguing that

9

there -- that compounding cannot be manufacturing, because

10

compounding is essentially patient-specific.

11

idiosyncratic in the sense that Mr. Kneedler used the term

12

and yet, for your advertising to be of any value and,

13

indeed, as you have just described the advertising, you're

14

getting beyond specific patients.

15

classes of patients, and when you get into classes of

16

patients, this neat distinction that you draw dissolves.

MR. HOFFMAN:

It is

We're getting into classes of

drugs, and we're getting -QUESTION:

All right, classes of drugs and

classes of drug-takers.
MR. HOFFMAN:

It's the same point.
And if there are classes of

22

patients that require those classes of drugs, physicians

23

do not know, always, what is available for their

24

particular patient, and they have to --

That's -- I'm sure that's true --

1

MR. HOFFMAN:

2

QUESTION:

Correct.

-- and that's a different point, but

3

I mean, this neat distinction between the, in effect, the

4

mass manufacturer and purely idiosyncratic compounding

5

just isn't a neat distinction.

6

MR. HOFFMAN:

And we do not mass manufacture,

7

and for some reason -- I apologize terribly that I'm not

8

making that point, because let me explain what we do do.

Let me just say, my concern here is

10

that you're telling us what the general practice of your

11

particular client is.

12

the legal question whether or not the Government may

forbid you from advertising that you compound a specific

14

drug, and it may be that that's not what you usually do.

MR. HOFFMAN:

QUESTION:

I thought what we were hearing was

Correct.

But that's the question that we have

17

before us, and if we affirm the judgment in your favor,

18

you are going to be allowed to do advertising in a lot

19

more specific ways than you now describe, and that's the

20

legal issue we have to decide.
MR. HOFFMAN:

21

That's correct, and given what the

22

Government-asserted interests are, that is to protect

23

public safety, through theoretically ineffective and

24

unsafe drugs, then the ban on advertising doesn't do that

25

at all.

In fact, FDAMA had in it the laudable sections

34
Alderson Reporting Company

1

which would have, in fact, been specifically addressed,

2

which until the Ninth Circuit were still a part of FDAMA,

3

only the advertising ban until then hadn't been held

unconstitutional.

QUESTION:

Well,

but the advertising ban is

surely devoted to keeping demand down, is it not?
MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, it seems to be, that is

8

correct, and that is a most inappropriate way to address

9

demand, by withholding truthful information from patients

10
11

and physicians who might benefit from that.
QUESTION:

Well, why doesn't it specifically

12

just -- what they say, I gather, it's one thing for a

13

doctor, together with his patient, to understand the

14

patient's allergy, or the hesitancy to swallow a pill, and

15

say to the druggist, will you adjust this.

16

permit that.

17

They want to

What they don't want to permit is the kind of

18

advertising which is a form of soliciting, which leads

19

lots of patients, as I might -- or you might.

20

they found something good for baldness, and suppose you

21

could only do it through compounding, and I read that in

22

the newspaper, I go to my doctor and I say, you know, the

23

druggist over here, I saw it on the Internet, is there

24

anything -- he says, is it safe?

25

that's what it said on the Internet.

Suppose

I guess so, I say,
He looks it up

35
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

there, and he prescribes that in reaction to what I want,

2

rather than his thinking of it because of my special need.

3

Now, once that happens, they say, you will see

4

widespread demand for certain drugs where there has been

5

no double-blind study, there has been no normal testing,

6

there's nothing here but the word of the pharmacist, and

7

that is not sufficient to protect the public health and

8

safety.

9

Now, you say that that advertising ban serves no

10

purpose, they say, that's the purpose, so what's wrong

11

with that argument?

MR. HOFFMAN:

There are many wrongs with that,

There's a dialogue, but what they

QUESTION:

And Congress in this act says, we

don't want dialogue.

21

we let something go out into the marketplace, that's what

22

they say, and that isn't here.

2

It might be that there are 10 million children who have a

It's to make certain that the

That's the purpose, and it's

Right, and at the end of the day,

before any drug can be dispensed, the physician has to

10

write a prescription, he has to approve it, and it makes

11

no difference at which end of the spectrum it commences,

12

because it always ends up with the physician.

13

QUESTION:

It makes no difference.

If that's

14

true, why when I turn on the television set do I see

advertisement after advertisement asking me to ask my

makes no difference?

19
20

MR. HOFFMAN:

What's the harm in the patient

going to the physician?
QUESTION:

The harm is that there are no double-

21

blind studies for this particular test, and therefore,

22

while we'll make an exception where the doctor initiates

23

this together with the patient, we don't want Breyer and

24

his friends seeing this on television and putting pressure

on their doctors.

Now, that may sound a little vague, but what the

Congress says, and what the FDA says, is that's necessary

to protect the public health, and what they say is not

without plausibility.

opportunities to preserve and protect the public safety

without resorting to First Amendment restriction.

QUESTION:

Of course, the advertising man

doesn't just apply that advertising to the general public.
You cannot advertise to doctors, either.

11

MR. HOFFMAN:

12

QUESTION:

I did not hear, I'm sorry.

Does the advertising ban apply only

13

to advertising to the general public?

14

is, it applies to all advertising.

15

MR. HOFFMAN:

16

QUESTION:

My understanding

And it's not just --

My understanding also is that most of

17

your advertising does not go to the general public, but

18

goes to the doctors and medical professionals.

MR. HOFFMAN:

QUESTION:

21
22

That is correct.

First of all --

So it is not a matter of getting John

Q. Public to put pressure on his doctor.
MR. HOFFMAN:

And it is not just advertising.

23

It is even the promotion and solicitation.

As the lower

24

court pointed out -- I think it was the Ninth Circuit, I

25

forget which, where it did not find or understand the

38
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

rationale for why the patient or the doctor would have to

2

ask the critical question, what's the best thing for this

3

patient, or what's the best thing for me, because they

4

would first have to ask the question.

5

And the whole concept of promotion and

6

solicitation -- forget about just advertising.

7

Advertising conjures up a specific type of sales provoking

8

television ad, billboard ads, but pharmacists, as part of

9

the canon of their ethics, is required as a professional,

10

as part of the triad, who is not just a passive order-

11

taker, who doesn't just count out and push pills, but a

12

person who plays a scientific role in the context, he has

13

to be able to on his own speak out and say, consistent

14

with the canons of his professions, this is better for

you.

This is what the doctor brought in.

12

intimacy in the relationship via the patient profiles, via

13

the ability to consult, is the same with these pharmacists

14

as it is with the corner druggist, if you will.

15

QUESTION:

It may take an extra day or

Mr. Hoffman, perhaps I've deflected

16

you before, but you were going to tell us something about

17

this bright line between what's a manufactured drug and

18

what's a compounded drug.

19

MR. HOFFMAN:

20

QUESTION:

21
22

Yes, Your Honor.

So how do we tell whether one is a

compound and whether it's a new drug?
MR. HOFFMAN:

Under Federal statute, for

23

example, manufacturing is defined as distribution to

24

someone other than the ultimate consumer, and that's found

25

in 21 United States Code, section 360(a)(1).

360(a)(1)

40
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

defines manufacturing as distribution to a middle man, or

2

a distributor, or a wholesale -- wholesaler, so right

away, the first distinction is the pharmacist only

dispenses directly to the patient in the context of the

records.

He knows what drug interactions there may or may

Second of all -- and, of course, the

11

manufacturer doesn't do that, having no relationship with

12

the physician, having no relationship with the patient.

13

In addition to that, they do, manufacturers do a

14

one-size-fits-all type of product.

15

that there is this vast, multimillion person individual

compounding, and radiopharmaceutical compounding were

2

exempted from the operation of FDAMA, so that potentially

3

the most lethal, most dangerous of all the compounds could

4

be advertised, promoted, solicited, and no pharmacopeia

5

ingredients could have been used for them.

6

They also provided for industry transportation

7

in the event of a memorandum of understanding.

Up to 20

8

percent of the total pharmaceutical sales by that pharmacy

9

could be shipped intrastate, so that if, for example,

10

there were five compounding pharmacists in a State, they

11

could fill 100 percent of the outside -- of the out-of-

12

State demand, so at the end of the day, as in Greater New

13

Orleans, this case -- I'm sorry, this statute was so

14

riddled with exemptions -- with exceptions that undermined

15

the Government's own very purpose, that it would fail just

16

because it was simply irrational.

17

As the Court pointed out already, it is

18

irrational to suggest that only speech that's provoked by

the physician can be unregulated, whereas the same speech

in the context of a professional relationship as provoked

by the pharmacist, then somehow it becomes

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

10

Thank you, Mr. Hoffman.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. KNEEDLER:

11

Mr. Chief Justice, what Congress

12

was trying to do here was to make sure that the narrow

13

exemption that it intended did not swallow the critical

14

general rule that new drugs have to be submitted to prior

15

approval.
The question of volume limitations has been

16
17

raised.

The act contains an aggregate volume limitation

18

but, as I mentioned, individual drug-by-drug volume

19

limitations would be very difficult to administer, and

20

Congress was not required to go down that path, but an

21

additional point about that is that if you look -- if you

22

add up a couple of prescriptions by each pharmacy, Nation-

23

wide you will be talking about a pretty large volume of a

24

new drug, which is precisely the sort of thing that should

25

be submitted to the FDA for prior approval.
