ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN M. SHAPIRO

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. SHAPIRO:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
According to the National Institutes of Health,

11
12

hepatitis C kills 8,000 to 10,000 people in this country

13

every year, and it's the largest cause of liver

14

transplants.

15

cases goes without any symptoms for a period of time, but

16

in a large percentage of cases, it results in cirrhosis

17

and liver failure.

18

chronic, active, and severe, according to the standards of

19

the NIH.

This is a progressive disease, which in many

The disease in this instance was

Government's guidelines say again and again that employees

25

should receive medical tests before beginning work to look

The ordinary worker can withstand that exposure,

Persons with a history of abnormalities of the liver would

be expected to be at increased risk from exposure.

NIOSH's statement about

Liver damage may occur.

Now, none of this matters according to the Ninth

7

Circuit because injury to self is beyond the employer's

legitimate concern.

completely different story.

That's the general defense

And right after it comes a particular example in

subpart (b), which refers to risks to other individuals.

11

injury to -- to other persons and injury to self are --

5

are both matters that fit within the general description

of business necessity, public safety --

QUESTION:

Well, there's some legislative

history that suggests that indeed it wasn't intended to

allow review of danger or risk to the employee himself.
MR. SHAPIRO:

10

We found several instances that we

cite in our brief where Congress was talking about injury

15

to answer this question.
QUESTION:

16

So, again, it's not an

18

that a qualification could include a requirement that the

MR. SHAPIRO:

That might be an inference from

QUESTION:

So, I guess the question is

how strong is the exclusionary inference --

3

MR. SHAPIRO:

We think it's -- it's particularly

4

weak because the -- the provision that comes right before

may make an offer of employment contingent on the results

consistent with business need.

21

Again, the focus is perfectly general in

The exam is lawful if it is job-related and

Now, we don't think it's necessary to resort to

legislative history in this case, but there is a

conference report here that stated that this act does not

intend to override any -- any -- legitimate medical

standards or requirements established by employers for

safety-sensitive positions.

2

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Shapiro, as I go through

3

this statute, under your theory of the case, beginning on

4

page 58a, 12118, do you concede, for purposes of the

5

statutory analysis, that the employee here was a qualified

6

individual?

7

MR. SHAPIRO:

We -- we deny that he was a

8

qualified individual.

We make two arguments:

one, that

9

-- that we have a business necessity not to hire somebody

10

who would be killed in this particular job, but also that

11

he's not qualified.

12

QUESTION:

So, as -- as you see the case, could

13

we dispose of the case by reading just 1211 -- 121118 and

14

end it right there --

15

MR. SHAPIRO:

Absolutely.

in defenses just does not bear on our determination one

is consistent -- consistent with it.

Obviously, you look at the whole

It's hard to say he's not qualified

when he worked there for the other contractor in the same

25

circumstances for 20 years or so.

MR. SHAPIRO:

The qualification standard focuses

on whether he can perform the job on an ongoing basis in

the near term.

4

seriously ill or die in the near term, that person can't

5

carry out the job functions.

6

QUESTION:

And -- and if the person would become

But 12113 specifically deals with

7

qualification standards.

I mean, don't you think that the

8

qualification standards portion has to be read in pari

9

materia with the -- with the -- with the provision

10

defining a qualified individual?

11

the two are addressing exactly the same thing.

12

MR. SHAPIRO:

There is linguistic overlap and

13

there is practical overlap.

14

is a person --

15

QUESTION:

I mean, it seems to me

A person who is not qualified

I mean, you wouldn't -- you wouldn't

16

say that -- that a person is not a qualified individual if

17

he would pose an indirect threat to the health or safety

18

of others, would you?

19

You cannot use that as a qualification standard.

20

just don't think it's an easy way out.

21

another section, but I think that other section has to be

22

read to -- to be corresponding to the qualification

23

standards.

MR. SHAPIRO:

Because that's clearly excluded.
I -- I

I just -- it is in

Our view is that there's overlap

between qualification and business necessity.

QUESTION:

Are we ultimately -But they're not coextensive.

Are we ultimately asking the

question, is he qualified?
MR. SHAPIRO:

That's the first question.

The

6

second question is, if he is qualified, because, as

7

Justice O'Connor said, he can do the job in the short run,

8

which we don't think he can, then the question is whether

9

we have a business need to retain him.

10

QUESTION:

Well, but let me -- when we go

11

through the whole statute, including 121113, do you

12

ultimately say we come to the conclusion that after

13

reading the whole statute, he is not qualified, as that

term is used in 8?

QUESTION:

All right.

You say -- I mean -- the

reason I ask that question is I suspect in any real case,

since people don't really want to kill themselves, there's

5

an argument about how risky it is.

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, if you read the cases that

QUESTION:

In all those other cases, it seemed

to me -- in all the cases that you cited --

10

MR. SHAPIRO:

11

QUESTION:

Yes.

-- there was a different issue at

stake, and that in part was whether he could do the job.

13

And here, perhaps unrealistically we are assuming, for the

14

sake of this case, that he can do the job perfectly well.

All right.

You don't.

But suppose

19

don't think anyone denies that if he can't do the job with

MR. SHAPIRO:

That was evaluated under a

different legal standard, the BOFQ standard, which is much

more stringent.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT

13

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

14

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

15
16
17

MS. BLATT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
If I could first address just how the statute

18

works with respect to whether an individual is qualified.

19

It proceeds in two basic steps.

20

burden of proof to show that he can perform the essential

21

fundamental job tasks of the job and that he satisfies the

22

employer's other qualification standards.

23

The plaintiff has the

Now, if a particular qualification standard

24

screens out someone because he is disabled, then the

25

burden shifts to the employer to justify that standard as

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

20

job-related and consistent with business necessity.

And

2

what -- the EEOC's regulatory threat to self regulation is

3

one example of a subset of a valid standard that is job-

4

related and consistent with business necessity.

5

The statute recognizes that a valid

6

qualification standard may include a safety requirement

7

that an individual not pose a safety threat to others in

8

the work place.

9

parallel defense is available if the individual would pose

10

The EEOC has reasonably concluded that a

a significant safety threat to himself.
QUESTION:

11

I -- I have one question.

I guess

12

it's a -- maybe a soft variety of the expressio/exclusio

13

argument.

14

-- that the Congress basically left a blank place to be

15

filled in in whatever way the agency think is best.

16

would Congress have wanted to leave, as it were, a hiatus

17

on the question of individual safety when it specifically

18

attended to safety of others?

19

thing to leave up to the agency when it was that close to

20

the subject in -- in what it did require.

But the theory of Chevron deference is that the

MS. BLATT:

21

Why

It just seems like an odd

Well, the context is very important

22

here.

What the direct threat to others -- the statutory

23

threat to others defense -- is is a codification of this

24

Court's decision in Arline, and that arose in the context

25

of a teacher with a contagious disease that posed a direct

21

threat to others.

2

other types of safety threats would be addressed by the

3

more general business necessity.

4

address safety threats to self or safety threats to others

5

in the public and not necessarily the work place.

6

But Congress expressly anticipated that

QUESTION:

Congress simply didn't

Perhaps Congress thought like Justice

7

Breyer, that it's quite implausible that anybody would

8

want to kill himself.

9

something that leaps to mind, that you -- you have to stop

Right?

I mean, it -- it is not

10

somebody from taking a job that's going to kill him,

11

whereas stop somebody from taking a job in which he's

12

going to hurt somebody else, that's something you would

13

worry about.

14

MS. BLATT:

The threat to self context can come

15

up where an employee wants to either, A, assume the risk

16

or, B, there's a disagreement about whether that risk in

17

fact exists.

18

Now, the question is, is when an employer can

19

prove, meet a burden of showing a documented and

20

scientific basis for finding a significant risk of

21

substantial harm, the employer has legitimate interests in

22

refraining from injuring or killing its workers.

23

fact that the employee consents to that risk cannot trump

24

the employer's interests, no more than it could if the

25

employees agreed to assume the risk of working in an

cases, the employer has legitimate interests.

shows that Congress was concerned about employment

decisions based on stereotype or group-based predictions

6

and unfounded fears about disabled people posing safety

threats.

8

the employer's legitimate interest with the rights of

9

disabled persons to be free of these prejudicial decisions

10

by requiring an individualized determination that looks at

11

the person's actual medical condition and recognizes that

12

disabilities pose varying levels of side effects and

13

limitations or safety threats and requires an objective

determination based on --

MS. BLATT:

But you take the position in the
I was curious about that.

The position that the EEOC argued to

4

the Ninth Circuit, which the Ninth Circuit did not address

5

and would be available on remand, was that there was a

6

factual dispute that summary judgment should not be

7

entered on whether there was a reasonable determination.

8

But employers are entitled to rely on the reasonable

9

medical judgments that reflect available current --

10

current medical knowledge.
QUESTION:

11

Can I ask you a question about the

12

reg?

Because normally you should, of course, defer to the

13

agency's regs.

14

reg is surprising the way it's written; that is, it

15

doesn't say there are a lot of qualification standards.

16

One of them is a direct threat to individuals, contagious

18

Rather it has the definition of the word, direct threat,

19

21

direct threat to others.

22

it's doing is explaining the words, direct threat to

MS. BLATT:

With all due respect, Justice

3

Breyer, what the -- what the agency did -- and it's on

4

page 60a of the petition -- is said that a valid

5

qualification standard includes a requirement that there

16

a matter of administrative convenience in protecting the

rights of disabled persons, is that in -- in crafting a

the Court:
The exclusion of individuals with disabilities

affirmative legal authorization for precisely that sort of

conduct.

Well, as I understand -- I want to

MR. BAGENSTOS:

I don't want to --

Well, I -- I was done with that

point.
QUESTION:

I was just going to say with respect

7

to -- when you get to the regulation itself, one answer

8

from the Government was that the -- the reason the

9

regulation mentioned threats to others is that there was

10

-- there was case law on the point, and there's -- there

11

really isn't comparable case law on threats to

12

individuals.

13

was to say it wanted to preserve the law -- the case law

14

that there was and leave the rest open.

15

what do you say to that argument?

16

MR. BAGENSTOS:

So that one way to read what Congress did

What do you --

Well, I think -- I think that --

17

that I may misconstrue their argument, but -- but

18

certainly -- certainly as to the state of the

19

Rehabilitation Act law at the time the ADA was adopted,

20

there was a specific regulation by the EEOC.

21

in the petition's -- petition appendix at page 61, right,

22

that specifically said a person is qualified only if he

23

can perform the essential functions of the position in

24

question without endangering the health or -- and safety

25

of the individual and others.

a floor for protection under the ADA.

instance where Congress actually departed from what the

5

prior Rehabilitation Act regulations did.

6

-- that has particular significance, particularly in light

7

of the consistent drum beat not just in the statutory

8

findings, not just in the legislative history at the

9

hearing stage, at the committee report stage, at the floor

This is one

We think that

10

stage, but also consistently in Title VII law, this --

11

this distinction between -- between excluding people based

12

on risk they pose to others and excluding people based on

13

risk they pose to themselves.

14

QUESTION:

Well, isn't there some room, though,

15

for the argument that it -- there may be a business

16

necessity not to hire somebody who's going to be killed as

17

a result?

employee is injured on the job or made ill because of the

-- there are arguments there for a business necessity

defense.

You do have OSHA standards.

they're misplaced as a justification across the board for

a threat to self defense as the EEOC has adopted.

3

Worker's compensation premiums --

4

QUESTION:

Maybe but notwithstanding the

5

regulation, just looking at the provisions of the act as

6

applied in this case, how do we deal with that business

7

necessity argument?

8
9

MR. BAGENSTOS:
about that.

Well, I think I'd say two things

First, I think that -- I think that the

10

decision that Congress made in 12113(b), the direct threat

11

provision, to say specifically this is -- this is a

12

defense that is limited to significant risks, because

13

that's how it defines direct threat, and risks to others,

14

I think that -- that in and of itself suggests that

15

Congress has foreclosed a business necessity defense for

16

anything -- anything relating to safety risk that falls

17

outside the terms of it, just as Congress couldn't -- just

18

as an employer could not say, as Justice Scalia suggested,

19

well, we're excluding this person because of an indirect

20

threat, but there's a business necessity for it.

21

QUESTION:

Well, I thought Justice O'Connor's

22

question was somewhat broader.

Obviously, we understand

23

your statutory position.

24

question at least, as -- as I began to consider it, was

25

whether or not in this society, it's -- it's wrong to say

But the -- the point of her

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

37
1

that an employer should care about its employees.

2

MR. BAGENSTOS:

3

QUESTION:

Certainly --

It seems to me that that's a very,

4

very important policy to further, and your position wants

5

an employer to take a position that could be completely

6

barbarous.

7

problems near dangerous machines where he could be maimed,

8

and you say that that's just irrelevant.

9

-- an argument that's very demeaning to a society that

You have an employee who has severe mobility

I think that's a

10

wants to encourage good conduct on -- on the part of its

11

employers.

12

MR. BAGENSTOS:

Well, I think that this Court

13

confronted basically the same argument in the Johnson

14

Controls case, that the employer said -- the employer

15

said, look, we have a moral interest in the safety of our

16

employees.

17

QUESTION:

But wasn't that a case involving a

18

broad category of all women of child-bearing age whether

19

or not you were dealing with a specific individual who had

20

been told by the doctor you better not do this.

21

a broad categorical rule.

22

difference, do you think?

24

is a -- a very sound concept as applied to broad

25

categories, but I'm not sure it covers this case.

That was

38
1

MR. BAGENSTOS:

Well, I -- I mean, two points

2

with respect to that.

One is I think that it's clear that

3

as -- as the employment discrimination law moves from

4

Title VII which deals with large groups to -- to

5

disability, which as -- as this Court's definition of

6

disability decisions indicate, is a very individualized

7

kind of a concept.

8

the same medical diagnosis, one may have a disability, one

9

may not, this Court has repeatedly emphasized.

Right?

I mean, two people who have

10

Necessarily the kind of intentional discrimination we're

11

talking about is going to be intentional discrimination

12

against a person because of his particular disability as

13

opposed to because of some broader group membership.

14

I -- I would suggest that there -- there is

15

exclusion on the basis of some kind of group membership

16

even in a case like this.

17

would be excluded by -- by what Chevron --

QUESTION:

But once -- once you eliminate the

19

stereotyping as, you know, Justice Souter was -- was

20

inquiring about, I don't see why Congress would be so

21

adamant about paternalism for the handicapped but not

22

adamant about paternalism for everybody else.

23

-- if I don't have a handicap, I have some disability that

24

-- that does not qualify as a handicap, and I want to -- I

25

want to work in -- in a particular job, and it's

I mean, if

2

say, paternalistic State, get out of here.

3

4

only worried about paternalism for the handicapped?

5

You can't do it.

I'm willing to

Why -- why is Congress

Once you eliminate the stereotyping, you have

6

individual determination that this person is -- is going

7

to be harmed.

8

person, he can kill himself, but if it's not a disabled

9

person, oh, no, you can let him kill yourself?

10

Why does Congress say, if it's a disabled

Why would

Congress want to make that distinction?
MR. BAGENSTOS:

11

Well, I think two -- two

12

points.

One is if it's a disabled person, he still has to

13

be subject to the same OSHA rules as everyone else.
But two, why is Congress concerned about

14
15

paternalistic discrimination?

16

significant part of it is the concern that over the run of

17

cases, there's -- when an employer looks at an individual

18

with a disability and the risk posed by that individual to

19

himself, history has shown -- and there's ample evidence

20

of this in the -- in the legislative record -- history has

21

shown that -- that there is likely to be an over-emphasis,

22

an over-determination that there is in fact a risk.

about the reg?

I take it your clients in this instance don't like the

reg, but more often than not, the EEOC regs are quite

favorable to disabled people.

11

well in this case we're paying no attention to the reg,

12

but in some other case you'll be back here arguing we

13

ought to pay a lot of attention to the reg.

14

your response to that?

15

MR. BAGENSTOS:

So -- so, how can we say,

Well, I don't think it's a

question of -- of whose ox is gored.

think why this reg --

MR. BAGENSTOS:

So, what's

Right?

I mean, I

Well, explain why it isn't.
Right.

And why this reg doesn't

-- ought not to get deference, it seems to me, is because

21

what the EEOC is basically doing is sneaking back into its

22

regulation a piece of the Rehabilitation Act regulation

23

that was cut out by Congress.

24

QUESTION:

25

You tell me how I write this sentence

in the paragraph that says the reg doesn't matter?

14

you're asking for a rule that encompasses those

What am I supposed to do?

17

I mean, maybe this isn't one

I think they're very

I doubt very much they really exist, but

MR. BAGENSTOS:

worker has nothing whatsoever to do with the problem of

2

contagious diseases.

3

that in writing about contagious diseases, they were

4

saying anything whatsoever about suicides.

5

And so, I find it very hard to say

MR. BAGENSTOS:

Well, I think that -- I think

6

that one of the -- one of the changes that the ADA makes

7

in the direct threat provision is broadening that from

8

contagious diseases to all other kinds of risks, number

9

one.

10

QUESTION:

You tell me about the reg.

11

MR. BAGENSTOS:

Right, right.

So, number two,

about -- about the reg, it seems to me that in some of the

extreme cases, a lot of them, maybe all of them, the

person will fail on the qualified individual standard.

you want me to avoid the fact that I owe deference to a

reg of the agency.

21

rule is I owe that deference.

22

this in respect to that?

23

MR. BAGENSTOS:

So, I want to know.

I know the normal

So, what's special about

Well, I -- I think that the

24

question -- the question is, as I said, whether Congress

25

has spoken to the matter with respect to whether an

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

43
1

employer can exclude an individual based on risk to self,

2

and we say that Congress has spoken to that matter in

3

12113(b), the direct threat provision.

4

QUESTION:

Sure, but the -- the question is how

5

plainly.

6

as a technical matter, without even getting to the

7

suicidal patient.

8
9

And -- and here's the problem that I have, just

You make a very good argument about the contrast
between what Congress wrote in the old EEOC regs.

As

10

against the force of that argument, you've got the text of

11

the statute that refers to the qualifications, including

12

threats to others.

13

breath that they're giving your -- an example, they're

14

saying, and there can be all kinds of other things too.

15

It may very well be -- I don't know.

So, in the -- you know, the very

It may

16

very well be that, as Justice Ginsburg suggested earlier,

17

they were talking about other kinds of examples on other

18

subjects.

19

that's the point at which Chevron deference becomes

20

crucial.

21

excluding a -- a Chevron treatment?

22

But I don't know.

It's not clear to me, and

How can I say it is so plain that Congress was

MR. BAGENSTOS:

Okay.

Two points, one textual,

23

one contextual.

The textual point, directly on -- on this

24

provision, I think goes back to what Justice Scalia said

25

in the first half of the argument which is just because it

begins with may include, doesn't mean that everything that

follows it -- everything that follows it doesn't place any

limitations on everything that precedes may include.

QUESTION:
draw the line.

Absolutely, but I don't know how to

That's my problem.

MR. BAGENSTOS:

And -- and I think the

contextual point helps answer that with the -- the

10

consistent statements both in the statutory findings and

11

in this provision, the change from the -- from the

12

Rehabilitation Act regs, and consistently in the

13

legislative history, including that specifically referring

14

to this particular provision saying the reason why we cut

15

this language out basically is in order to say that

16

paternalistic determinations, determinations by employers

17

for the safety of employees, for the safety of the

18

particular excluded employees, should not be permitted to

19

justify --

20

QUESTION:

Okay.

But that gets back to the

21

point that several have raised and that is paternalism

22

combined with stereotype, yes, I understand.

23

Johnson Controls is out.

24
25

But paternalism alone?

That's out.

Particularly where, as

Justice Scalia has said, paternalism for the -- for the

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

45

non-disabled is -- is alive and well in OSHA.

2

that's not so easy for -- for me to follow.

MR. BAGENSTOS:

Paternalism for everybody, the

non-disabled, as well as the disabled --

QUESTION:

6

MR. BAGENSTOS:

7

That's --

Yes.
-- taken as a whole -- I -- I

agree is taken kind of as part of the OSHA.

8

I -- I think that it's certainly, as -- as I

9

meant to say in response to Justice Scalia's question,

10

there certainly is a concern for stereotyping here.

11

question is whether Congress meant to permit -- or meant

12

to require employees to have to prove stereotyping in each

13

case.

14

class-based decision that most of the time when we have an

15

exclusion of an individual with a disability because of a

16

conclusion that his disability makes him unsafe, that --

17

that is likely to be informed by some degree of

18

stereotyping or the -- the incentives that -- that

19

employers' doctors have to exclude people rather than hire

20

them and take the steps necessary to protect them as the

21

American Public Health Association makes clear in its

22

brief.

23

The

That is -- that is, Congress could have made a

So, stereotyping is -QUESTION:

So, that may -- that may simply get

24

us down to a very important point but not a point here,

25

and that is, the -- a sufficiency of evidence point or a

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

46
1

-- or a sufficient specificity of evidence point.

2

that's -- that's not what we've got.

3

MR. BAGENSTOS:

And

Well, the problem -- right.

I

4

think that's right.

I think Congress then has two

5

choices.

6

that there is stereotyping in addition to paternalism?

7

do you presume essentially paternalism entails

8

stereotyping when it's paternalistic discrimination?

9

not paternalism at large, not paternalism visited on all

Do you require plaintiffs to prove in every case
Or

employees.

recounted over and over in -- in the hearings, was

12

entitled to say that we're just going to make a -- a broad

13

class of --

14

And I think that Congress, given the history

QUESTION:

Did it say that?

That's the question

15

we're all interested in.

16

say, but I don't believe you can point to any particular

17

place where it specifically says that.

18

MR. BAGENSTOS:

It certainly was entitled to

Well, I think that -- I think

19

that the closest is that just as the direct threat

20

provision excludes an indirect threat as a basis for --

21

for excluding someone, so too does the threat to others

22

language there exclude threats to self.

23

QUESTION:

Yes, but you -- you have to push

24

beyond the analogy from direct threat to indirect threat

25

to -- to get that far out.

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

47
1

MR. BAGENSTOS:

Well, I -- I don't -- I don't

2

know that you have to push beyond the analogy.

3

it's -- I would -- I would say, with respect, it seemed --

4

it seems like it's precisely parallel statutory language.

5

I mean,

There are two limitations in the 12113(b) direct

6

threat provision.

One is direct threat defined as

7

significant risk, and the other is risk to others.

8

seems like if you're going to override either of those

9

limitations under the guise of the general 12113(a)

It

10

qualification standards defense, then any purpose Congress

11

had for including those limitations in that direct threat

12

provision is -- is going to be rendered meaningless.

13

And so -- so, I think that's the concern there.

14

And this is not -- this is not a concern that's -- that's

15

unique to the ADA.

16

approached under Title VII.

It's a concern that this Court

17

I think the important answer that -- I'd like to

18

get back to Justice Kennedy's point before -- is that this

19

is not a statute, even under our reading, that prevents

20

employers from taking steps, taking lots of steps, to

21

protect their employees.

22

they might do, and that is simply exclude an employee who,

23

because of a disability, is determined to -- to pose an

24

undue risk.

25

QUESTION:

It just eliminates one thing

ask themselves what is your medical condition, do you have

doing is engaging in intentional discrimination against

there would be a business necessity justification under

What if the employer says, we require

22

everybody to have a prognosis of living for at least 2

23

years on the job?

24

(Laughter.)

25

MR. BAGENSTOS:

Right.

If the employer did

that, I mean, I think -- I think that that would be

2

something -- that would be something that goes a lot

3

closer to a qualification standard that is neutral.

4

the concern in that case is, number one, is it really

5

neutral?

6

people with disabilities, people with medical conditions

7

that constitute disabilities, we think that you fail this

8

test.

Now,

That is, is it the case that they say only to

QUESTION:

No, but I'm talking about just across

10

the board.

11

of what you're condition is, is we want -- we want your

12

life expectancy to be at least 2 years.

13

One of the things that we require, regardless

MR. BAGENSTOS:

I think that they could do that

14

if they could justify it as job-related and consistent

15

with business necessity, which might be very difficult.

16

The business justification I suppose would be we don't

17

want turnover in employment, but there's a lot of turnover

18

for a lot --

19

QUESTION:

No age discrimination problem here?

20

(Laughter.)

21

MR. BAGENSTOS:

There might well be an age

22

discrimination problem there.

know, depending on whether disparate effect is recognized

24

under that statute.

25

Disparate effects, you

But -- but under -- as far as the ADA is

51
1

concerned, certainly it's the case that they would be able

2

to assert a business justification, but I think it would

3

be difficult in that case to actually prove the business

4

justification because it's only -- if it's only people who

5

are going to die in 2 years, however we predict that, who

6

are excluded from employment and not people who are going

7

to take a better job, not people who are going to leave

8

because they fall in love and move to a different city or

9

leave to take care of a sick parent -- I mean, there are

10

thousands of reasons why job turnover occurs.

11

single out something that screens out people with

12

disabilities, that's obviously very different.

13

If they

But the crucial point, it seems -- it seems to

14

me, is that in this case what we have and in the class of

15

cases on which the legal question presented addresses --

16

what we have is a choice effectively of who's going to

17

decide whether a job is too risky for a particular

18

individual in a context where there are general rules like

19

OSHA that are complied with.

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. BAGENSTOS:

Well, let the doctor decide.
Well, I think that the

22

individual will certainly -- will certainly follow the

23

dictates of his own doctor in most cases.

24

individual doesn't, I mean, there are obviously cases

25

where people --

the Christian Scientists in this -- in this community.

4

I'm afraid you haven't thought about

MR. BAGENSTOS:

Right.

Well, I mean, I think --

I think that raises obviously distinct issues.

5

But -- but yes, I think that -- people will

6

obviously consult with their doctors.

I mean, what's --

7

what's notable here is that Chevron purported to consult

8

with Echazabal's doctor, didn't really give him all the

9

information, didn't get it, didn't ask him whether there

10

was a significant risk, but never put the doctor in

11

contact with Echazabal, just purported to have -QUESTION:

12
13

Well, that goes to the issue on

remand if there is one.

MR. BAGENSTOS:

MR. BAGENSTOS:

Right, no --

It's not the legal -I -- I agree with that.

I -- I

But if we're focusing on our concern

19

about extreme cases, of which this may not be one, have

20

you thought of a form of words that might cabin those off

21

if they ever occur, which would give some meaning to the

22

reg?

23

MR. BAGENSTOS:

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. BAGENSTOS:

I --

And what's the form of words?
I don't know that I can give any

53

meaning to the reg that's --

2

QUESTION:

If you can -- if you apply it, you

3

could think of an extreme case where the person is -- you

4

know, the suicidal worker, I'm going to die with my boots

5

on and I hope tomorrow.

6

and -- and okay.

7

I don't know.

8

the form of words that would cabin off those cases?

9

I mean, there may be such people,

So, that's what maybe this reg is about.

It doesn't say it isn't.

MR. BAGENSTOS:

And -- and what's

Well, I think that the cabining

10

would have to be external to the regulation.

11

-- I think it's -- to -- to say -QUESTION:

12
13

I think it's

Well, give me the form of words,

however you want to do it.
MR. BAGENSTOS:

14

Okay.

And I think that the

15

cabining is threefold.

16

exclude someone who is not a qualified individual with a

17

disability, which many people who pose such an extreme

18

present risk themselves will be.

19

can apply neutral qualification standards that are job-

20

related and consistent with business necessity.

21

number three, if we have someone who really is bent on

22

committing suicide by employment, there are State law

23

commitment remedies available for such people, people who

24

can't --

25

Number one, an employer can

Number two, an employer

MR. BAGENSTOS:

I mean, that's -- that's extreme.

3

are a lot of things that move people.

it, et cetera.

6

you could say, well, if it's really one of those cases, it

7

might be a -- a situation that falls within the reg?

8

you're telling me the answer to that question is no.

9

There is no form of words.

10

There

Some don't believe

So, is there a serious form of words that

MR. BAGENSTOS:

And

I -- I think outside of the

11

situation -- the first two situations that I spoke of

12

where the person isn't qualified or where the person is

13

excluded under a neutral job-related and consistent with

14

business necessity qualification standard, that I would

15

suspect excludes everybody except what we've now described

16

as the really extreme cases.

17

QUESTION:

In order to avoid paternalism, we're

18

going to tell employers they can just commit their

19

employees.

20

(Laughter.)

21

MR. BAGENSTOS:

Well, I think the crucial point

22

is that, I mean, there are due process limitations on

23

commitment which there are not for employers.

24

the crucial point, Justice Kennedy.

25

employers get to decide willy-nilly this is too unsafe,

And that's

If -- if we say that

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

55
1

that's -- that's a very different kind of a process.

Of

2

course, commitment is only in a very extreme circumstance,

3

and we have procedures to make sure that independent

4

decision makers make those decisions with full knowledge

5

of the facts not employers here and then forcing --

6

forcing employees to come to court and fight for 6 years

7

to prove that they really weren't a risk to themselves.

8

And -- and that we think is the reason why Congress

9

excluded the -- excluded the notion that an employer could

10

make the decision instead of the employee as to what is

11

too unsafe.

12
13

And we would then submit that the court of
appeals judgment should be affirmed.

7

What Dothard said is, this

MR. SHAPIRO:

There are going to be riots.

Oh, we think it does.

The Court

And this Court twice has said

10

in Dothard -- in Beezer -- the Beezer case later -- that
