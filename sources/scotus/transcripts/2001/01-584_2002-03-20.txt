ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. CRABTREE

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9

MR. CRABTREE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10

please the Court:

11

Court should hold that disparate impact is an available

12

method of proof in age discrimination cases.

13

Court held in Griggs that identical prohibitory language

14

prohibited facially neutral actions by an employer to

15

disproportionately impacted the protected class.

16

There are three core reasons why the

QUESTION:

First, the

Mr. Crabtree, we are not talking

17

about a situation where you are claiming that the fact of

18

disparate impact gives rise to a permissible inference of

19

intentional discrimination.

20

disparate impact alone, are you not?

21

MR. CRABTREE:

You are relying just on

No, Your Honor.

We believe that

22

disparate impact both serves the purpose of proving

23

indirectly that perhaps subconscious biases exist, as well

24

as detecting biases that could otherwise be concealed.

25

QUESTION:

Well, now in Washington against

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Davis, we held that disparate impact was not enough by

2

itself under the statute or Constitution that you could

3

infer from it an intent to discriminate.

4

didn't get the impression from the court of appeals

5

opinion that you are arguing that this plan by the

6

Respondent supports an inference of an intent to

7

discriminate on the basis of age.

8
9

MR. CRABTREE:

Now, are you, I

We believe it does support an

inference of an intent, an intent that does not need to be

10

proven, that it justifies that it can justify the

11

necessity for the doctrine because without it, it would be

12

easy for an employer to conceal its intent for example, an

13

employer could choose a device like a five-year rule in

14

which they said that we won't hire anybody with more than

15

five years' experience or we'll have speed tests.

16

QUESTION:

That's a very handy prophylactic

17

rule, but with it, once you, once you acknowledge that

18

indeed the malicious intent is necessary with it, with the

19

rule that you propose, you are going to get a lot of

20

employers that have no such malicious intent.

21

MR. CRABTREE:

Justice Scalia, we are not

22

suggesting that malicious intent is required at all for

23

disparate impact.

24

will detect that as well, or at least the provision --

25

We are suggesting that disparate impact

QUESTION:

You just say it is bad in itself.

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

It is not bad because it shows malicious intent.

2

MR. CRABTREE:

3

absolutely believe that.

4

QUESTION:

That's certainly true.

We

Because if the only reason it's bad

5

is because it shows malicious intent, my goodness, it

6

seems to me it goes much too far.

7

employers who have in place policies that may affect

8

elderly employees more harshly who, you know, have no

9

intent to do that.

10

MR. CRABTREE:

There are a lot of

That's certainly true, and

11

definitely, the doctrine goes beyond that.

12

are suggesting is it will also, it also prevents an

13

employer from being able to hide behind --

14

QUESTION:

But what we

Well, you want us to consider the

15

case on the assumption that the employer has no intent to

16

discriminate.

17

absolutely pure, but in some instances, he is still going

18

to be liable under the adverse, pardon me, disparate

19

impact theory.

He actually has, his intentions are

20

MR. CRABTREE:

21

correct, Justice Scalia.

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. CRABTREE:

24
25

In many instances, that is

And that's your position.
That is our position.

That's

correct.
QUESTION:

Okay.

So you are relying on

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

disparate impact alone?

2

MR. CRABTREE:

3

QUESTION:

That is correct, Your Honor.

May I ask, because it's always

4

helpful to me to know, what's at stake in the particular

5

case.

6

impact in this case?

What is the practice that you claim has a disparate

7

MR. CRABTREE:

What we have alleged in this

8

case is that the employer's reduction in force has had a

9

disparate impact upon the older workers, the selection

10

device of the older workers.

11

QUESTION:

Are you saying reductions in force

12

are always practices that if they have a disparate impact,

13

give rise to a, an age discrimination claim?

14

MR. CRABTREE:

No, Your Honor, because in

15

virtually every instance where there is reduction in force

16

it will be quite easy for an employer to satisfy the

17

defense under the reasonable factors of the age provision

18

of the act.

19

QUESTION:

20

reduction in force in this case?

21

What is different about the

MR. CRABTREE:

Well, in this case, Your Honor,

22

as the district court acknowledged in its opinion that we

23

are proceeding from, we had evidence at the highest levels

24

that the decision to undertake the downsizing was actually

25

a decision to get rid of, intended to get rid of older

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

workers.

2
3

QUESTION:

That's the disparate treatment

claim?

4

MR. CRABTREE:

Unfortunately, it's not, Your

5

Honor, because as the district court judge acknowledged,

6

we could not make a disparate treatment case under these

7

facts because in the disparate treatment case, we would

8

still have to prove, unless we could make a cat's paw

9

analysis that the actual decision maker harbored an animus

10

against the employee who is terminated.

11

suggesting under this model and under this framework is

12

that if we can make a prima facie case of disparate

13

impact, then the employer can justify that impact by

14

showing that its decision was based upon reasonable

15

factors and that those reasonable factors --

16

QUESTION:

17

interrupting, but is it the decision to downsize that it

18

has to be reasonable or the particular discharge decisions

19

on each individual have to be reasonable?

20

But what we are

But this is what I -- excuse me for

MR. CRABTREE:

We have identified in this case

21

the action of the employer as being the decision to

22

downsize itself.

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. CRABTREE:

25

The decision to downsize itself?
Which for most instances will be

much more difficult probably for plaintiffs than it would

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

be if you want on a more micro-level.
QUESTION:

However --

Why would it be more difficult?

3

you have to prove if I understand your theory is that

4

there are more older workers in the group that were

5

discharged than younger workers?

6

MR. CRABTREE:

All

Will, it would have to be a

7

substantially disparate impact between the two groups.

8

would be more difficult because it would be much easier

9

for an employer to justify a reduction in force in almost

10
11

It

any circumstance.
QUESTION:

I thought you conceded that it was

12

not enough for you to show disparate impact.

13

had, say 70 percent of the people and my problem with your

14

presentation is the same as Justice Stevens.

15

disparate impact case that I know, a rule neutral is on

16

its face that disparate impact like the high school

17

diploma requirement in Griggs, there is the standard that

18

has a differential effect.

19

and paper test as in Washington V. Davis, a height, weight

20

requirement as in Dothard vs. Rawlinson, but you don't

21

come to us with any rule, standard, practice.

22

say reduction in force.

23

MR. CRABTREE:

That you

In every

A high school diploma, a pen

You just

Well, what we are saying is

24

this, is that the Court indicated in Wards Cove that the

25

plaintiff in an age -- in a discrimination case is to

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

identify a specific practice or action by an employer that

2

results in disparate impact that cannot be justified.

3

have identified this downsizing as being such a practice

4

because we don't believe the employer can justify it

5

because the downsizing was motivated by desire to --

6

QUESTION:

We

Why don't we leave motive out of it

7

for purposes -- forget motive.

8

case, that's what I thought this case was about, we

9

imagine in your case the employer had a wonderful motive.

Let's imagine in your

10

There are other cases where the rule in question was we

11

are going to fire some tenured teachers to save money.

12

That was the real reason to save money.

13

teachers tend to be older teachers.

14

case in which they said the court looked at a rule that

15

said we will fire people in the higher-paid positions.

16

That was their real reason to save money.

17

The tenured

There was another

But the court said each of those rules like

18

your case, too, has a disparate impact on older employees.

19

And just saving money is not a justification and therefore

20

the plaintiff wins.

21

you are defending.

22
23

MR. CRABTREE:
proposition.

24
25

Now, I take it that's the proposition

That's correct.

QUESTION:
are easy.

We are defending that

Okay.

Then the other parts to me

Of course you can use it to prove bad motive,

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

et cetera, but that's the hard proposition.

Now, I wish

2

you would explain why as a matter of law that tough

3

proposition nonetheless is the law.

4

MR. CRABTREE:

Well, we believe it's the law

5

because the prohibitions themselves as construed in Griggs

6

apply to actions and then the reasonable --

7

QUESTION:

Well, the background in Griggs was

8

racial discrimination, and the policies there seem to me

9

to rest on a long history of societal and historical bias

10

against black people.

11

with age discrimination, do we?

Now, we don't have that background

12

MR. CRABTREE:

13

QUESTION:

14
15

No, Justice O'Connor, we do not.

So it might be quite a different

proposition here.
MR. CRABTREE:

Respectfully, no, Your Honor.

16

And here's why.

17

court is not limited a disparate impact to remedying past

18

problems with discrimination.

19

beyond that.

20

subconscious stereotypes operating in the work force,

21

exactly what the court identified as the primary form of

22

discrimination that exists under the ADEA.

23

As the court acknowledged in Watson, the

Disparate impact goes

Disparate impact exists to detect

Thirdly, in Griggs the court said that the

24

legislative purpose of the act was "plain from the

25

language of the statute", so the court was looking at the

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

statute itself.
QUESTION:

That's a good idea.

3

statute that we are dealing with here?

4

language of the statute?

5

MR. CRABTREE:

What is the

Can we look at the

Sure, Your Honor.

It's on page

6

5.A, the appendix to the petitioner's brief.

7

look at the statute itself, what you see between (a)(1)

8

and (a)(2) is a difference between a micro and a

9

macro-orientation.

And when you

In (a)(1), we are concerned about an

10

employer's individual actions directed towards an

11

individual employee, but in (a)(2), we are concerned with

12

an employer's macro-actions directed towards its employees

13

and how that impacts individuals.

14

QUESTION:

In each of those cases, Mr.

15

Crabtree, it says because of such individual's age.

16

doesn't that suggest that there is some motive

17

requirement?

18

MR. CRABTREE:

No, Your Honor.

Now,

We don't

19

believe it does and I'll explain why.

20

(a)(2), the clause because of such individual's age, the

21

word individual is critical because at the beginning of

22

two, it reads, to limit, segregate or classify his

23

employees in any way which would deprive or tend to

24

deprive any individual of employment opportunities or

25

otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee

When you look at

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

because of such individual's age.

2

to the effect and not to the motive of the actor.

3
4

QUESTION:

I would think it relates to, to the

limit, segregate or classify.

5
6

So the clause relates

MR. CRABTREE:

It cannot, Your Honor, because

the word his employees follows those words.

7

QUESTION:

In any event, the wording is

8

identical to Title VII, and Title VII on that wording has

9

been held to have this differential impact theory for sex,

10

as well as race.

11

MR. CRABTREE:

That's absolutely correct,

12

Justice Ginsburg.

13

to expressly prohibit disparate impact under Title VII.

14

The only prohibition of disparate impact under Title VII

15

is in its age as the court construed in Griggs and Griggs'

16

progeny.

17

And of course, Congress has never acted

QUESTION:

Was this language adopted in this

18

form after it had been clearly established that the Title

19

VII language did include disparate impact?

20

an original matter, I wouldn't have thought it did.

21

MR. CRABTREE:

22

QUESTION:

23
24
25

You know, as

Oh, it did not.

We held that.

Now, was this

language adopted after we held that or before it?
MR. CRABTREE:
certainly was.

It was before, Your Honor.

It

However --

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

After Title VII, but before Griggs?

2

MR. CRABTREE:

That's correct.

And to hold

3

that this language does not prohibit disparate impact

4

would mean that there was no disparate impact under Title

5

VII.

6

was define a defense.

Even in the 1991 Civil Rights Act, all Congress did

7

QUESTION: But it seems to me that even if we

8

accept your reading of the statute which I am not sure is

9

the more natural reading, you still have because of such

10

individual's age, that is to say what you would call

11

disparate impact, what the statute says adverse impact

12

must still be because of such individual's age and if we

13

think because of, implies or necessarily requires a bad

14

purpose, you still have the same problem.

15

MR. CRABTREE: If because of did require a bad

16

purpose, we would, however, there is two reasons why we

17

can, why it is not. One is that the first one is that the

18

reasonable factors other than age defense cannot make

19

sense if the prohibitions only apply to intentional

20

actions.

21

QUESTION:

Now you are going to the second. Just

22

so I'm focusing in on this.

23

your reading of the statute doesn't explain because of,

24

then you have to go to this other part of the statute,

25

which you have to do any way.

(A)(2), it seems to me that

So I mean this whole

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

argument over how to interpret 2 it seems to me doesn't

2

get you there.

3

MR. CRABTREE:

Again, we are relating because

4

of back to the effect of the individual and we are relying

5

upon the court's interpretation of that language in

6

Griggs.

7

QUESTION:

Well, one, one might feel that

8

Griggs is stare decisis because it could feel that perhaps

9

it reasoning would not readily be extended if there was

10

some reason for distinguishing it.

11

MR. CRABTREE:

That might make sense.

I would

12

agree, Your Honor, however we don't believe there is any

13

basis to distinguish here given the court's subsequent

14

cases post-Griggs.

15

QUESTION:

But as -- may I go back to the

16

question that we opened with, and that is I don't know of

17

any case under Title VII where someone could just say

18

reduction in force affected more women than men,

19

therefore, I have an impact case or reduction in force, it

20

affected more minorities than majorities so therefore.

21

It's always been some specific practice that you could

22

identify some rule, some neutral rule.

23

sometimes referred to as neutralized base discriminatory

24

and impact.

25

In fact, it's even

Here I don't -- reduction of force in and of

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

itself is not such a neutral rule.

2

general.

3

that's comparable to a high school diploma, a height and

4

weight.

5

It's -- it's too

So I, what is the precise rule practice standard

What is there in this case?
MR. CRABTREE:

Your Honor, two answers.

6

of all, that we equate reduction in force to a test.

7

a selection process.

8

the test.

9

if the court were to find that we have inadequately

First
It's

We are not challenging a question on

We are challenging the test itself.

But even

10

identified the action of the employer that should be

11

subject to disparate impact analysis, we would still, it's

12

an interlocutory proceeding.

13

on the theory as the court redefines or the court defines

14

disparate impact under the ADEA.

15

complaint in accordance with the court's ruling.

16

QUESTION:

We would be happy to proceed

We would amend our

I don't think that the district

17

court finding allows you to say the standard is the

18

reduction itself because the district judge said that the

19

people involved held a wide variety of jobs, were managed

20

and supervised by different people and were terminated at

21

different times by different decision makers based on

22

different considerations of criteria, and that seems to me

23

just wholly to reject that there is a rule or a standard.

24
25

MR. CRABTREE:

The reason why we believe it's

important to be able to do the analysis with the reduction

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

of force being the action is because otherwise it would

2

allow an employer to purposely choose to do a reduction in

3

force to get rid of its older workers where there is a

4

corporate culture pervaded by ageism and have consequences

5

as it did here where it greatly reduced the age of its

6

work force.

7

QUESTION:

What is your closest precedent under

8

Title VII dealing with race or dealing with sex where you

9

have something so groundly general as a reduction in force

10

with different decisions, different standards, different

11

times?

12

MR. CRABTREE:

13

reduction of force under Title VII.

14

vs. Medical Center, Inc., It was out of the third circuit.

20

657 F.2d 1322.

There are cases dealing with
There is one NAACP

There have probably been others.

QUESTION:

And nothing more specific than a

reduction in force?
MR. CRABTREE:

Candidly, Justice Ginsburg, I

don't recall. I just know -QUESTION:

Mr. Crabtree, I thought the question

21

on which we granted certiorari was not whether this

22

particular claim of disparate impact was too general or

23

not specific enough.

24

is a disparate impact method of proving age discrimination

25

available to plaintiffs.

But whether the whole, I'll read it,

MR. CRABTREE:

2

QUESTION:

That's correct, Justice Scalia.

And I would hope you would address

3

Justice Breyer's question in which he said why should we

4

do this to say that tenured employees are the higher

5

salaried employees?

6

case such as that for using your theory of liability?

7

What would be the justification in a

MR. CRABTREE:

Well, in most instances,

8

employer is going to be able to explain why he engages in

9

any selection process.

10

QUESTION:

Most instances, they can't explain

it very well.

12

way, you could do it that way, you could do it some other

15

way, and it will turn out you haven't thought about it

that much.

17

employer go to that effort we were talking about race and

18

gender, and yet here, there is so many rules correlated

19

with age.

run his business where you are going to have a court

21

second-guessing every single rule that's correlated with

age.

In most instances, I think in a business or

People say you could do it this

Now, it may well be sensible to make an

There are so many that how could the employer

That's the problem.
MR. CRABTREE:

What's your response?
And that may very well be why

24

Congress chose to use the result factors other than age

25

language, and that is why there are, although we don't

17
Alderson Reporting Company

agree with them, why there were good intellectual

That it is that the employer

must justify the action as being business necessity.

17

QUESTION:

But reasonable factors other than

18

age provision doesn't really solve Justice Breyer's

19

problem, does it, because it puts the burden on the

20

employer to establish that, doesn't it?

21

MR. CRABTREE:

22

QUESTION:

It does, Your Honor.

So you are still in a situation

where the employer said well he could have done it a lot

of different ways and you are saying I'm sorry, that's no

good.

MR. CRABTREE:

What is your response to the

What's your

They don't make sense on the

mixed motive analysis because in the mixed motive analysis

19

there is still an issue as to whether or not the

20

employer's illegal motive caused an illegal action.

21

in a statute, it provides that the action is otherwise

22

prohibitive, so you already have an action that is itself

23

a violation of the act but-for the defense that follows.

24

We don't have the same concerns we have in a mixed motive

25

case where we don't know if the motive of the employer

2

as a premise of the defense.

3

It's already been determined

There is an additional reason why we believe

4

that the court should hold that disparate impact applies

5

under the ADEA.

6

provided that employees who were terminated in reductions

7

in force should be entitled to, were entitled to receive

8

physical information prior to deciding whether or not to

9

take the termination package, presumably of substantial

10

And that is Congress passed the OWBPA and

economic value, or take their chances in litigation.

11

Given that disparate treatment can generally

12

not be predicated upon nothing more than statistics.

13

given that employees terminated in RIF's usually do not

14

have an independent basis to suspect that they are being

15

singled out for discrimination.

16

QUESTION:

And

Mr. Crabtree, could I just come back

17

for a moment to, to your argument which I think is an

18

important one that some of the defenses don't make sense

19

unless there is a discriminatory impact basis.

20

the defense that says it will not be unlawful to discharge

21

or otherwise discipline an individual, an individual, for

22

good cause?

23

can only imply to an intentional discrimination case, not

to a, not to an impact case.

punishing his age.

seems to me a lot of these defenses are redundant.

Another one is observing the terms of a seniority system

and so forth.

It does not

11

that Congress required that the factors not just be

ignored the otherwise prohibitive language, Justice

Scalia, we still have to give effect to the term

Even though the language is

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

essentially the same?

2

MR. NAGER: Justice O'Connor, it's not.

It is

3

common language in Section 4, but this Court doesn't

4

construe language in a statute in isolation from the

5

remainder of the statute, and the remainder of this

6

statute is quite different. The remainder of the statute

7

includes the reasonable factors other than age provision.

8

The remainder of this statute is based upon a report of

9

the Secretary of Labor which said that the problems of age

10

discrimination in the workplace were quite distinct and

11

quite different from the problems that motivated the

12

enactment of Title VII and it's the problems that

13

motivated the enactment of Title VII which gave rise to

14

Griggs.

15

your opinion for the court says in Watson.

16

look at the statute, statutory language not in isolation,

17

because in fact, we can read all of the court's Title VII

18

disparate impact cases and we won't see the language

19

parsed.

20

overall objectives of the statute, and rendered a decision

21

in light of the distinct and enormous problems of race

22

discrimination that this country has faced and dealt with.

Instead it commissioned a report from the secretary of

And the bill, the report that was commissioned

This Court repeatedly in EEOC vs. Wyoming,

QUESTION:

I thought you were going to tell us

8

that because of age, is one of your strongest points, and

9

as Justice O'Connor said, that's the same language

10

structure that we had in Griggs, and that we would have to

11

interpret them differently.

12

MR. NAGER:

13

QUESTION:

You are right, Justice Kennedy.
But, but, but then you automatically

14

throw me over I guess to part (f) and talk about

15

reasonable factors other than age, which is exactly what

16

the petition wanted to do.

17

MR. NAGER:

That's my lack of clarity, Justice

18

Kennedy.

19

natural construction of the language in 4(a), the because

20

of language, is an intent requirement.

21

intent requirement is confirmed and compelled by the

22

remaining provisions in the statute.

just as your opinion in Public Employee Retirement System

vs. Betts did.

sure I have -- you think that because of such individual's

2

age or more normally refers to the very first part of the

3

paragraph that talks in the plural rather than the

4

singular?

5

MR. NAGER:

Yes, Justice Stevens, because the

6

structure of the statute says that the employer can't

limit, segregate or classify his employees in a way that

8

has an adverse effect on an individual.

QUESTION:

MR. NAGER:

Correct.

The effect that that

modifies, not the classification.

MR. NAGER:

No.

The comma in that provision, I

think eliminates any ambiguity about what the because of

That it modifies the verbs to limit,

as a whole.

MR. NAGER:

It is -- I would grant you that it

2

is not the most elegantly written sentence in the world,

3

but I would also urge upon you, Your Honor, that the comma

in that sentence grammatically compels that the because of

5

phrase modifies the to limit, segregate or classify.

6

QUESTION:

Your view is well, Title VII, the

7

court really got it wrong.

8

so they got it wrong, but that's stare decisis so we'll

leave it alone, because it's the identical wording, the F

11

because it's not found in Title VII.

12

argument has to be saying, and tell me if I'm wrong about

13

this, the court really got it wrong in Griggs because

14

there is no room for an impact test under Title VII any

15

more than under age, but because the court said it in 1971

16

and continued to say it, we are stuck with it, but we

17

don't have to make the same mistake again.

18

argument?

But if your grammar

Is that your

19

MR. NAGER:

20

challenge Griggs in any respect.

21

the more natural construction of that language was not the

22

one the court adopted in Griggs, and just as this Court

23

does that on occasion because of other materials that

24

influence the construction of a statute.

25

QUESTION:

Justice Ginsburg, I'm not here to
I am here to say that

Alderson Reporting Company

statute, as you said, not just the comma.

2

MR. NAGER:

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. NAGER:

QUESTION:

A comma is not a very big thing, is

it?

9

MR. NAGER:

10
11

And that is what the court has

found in its Title VII cases.

7
8

The comma could be outweighed by

other factors in one statute, and not in the other.

5
6

That's the point.

QUESTION:

I'm sorry, could you -I say a comma is not a very big

thing.

12

MR. NAGER:

Well, it is part of the statute,

13

and we think it has to be taken into account, but our

14

argument that the age discrimination employment act should

15

not be allowed to recognize disparate impact claims does

16

not rest solely on the comma.

17

4(a), Justice Kennedy and Justice Ginsburg is that the

18

more natural construction of that language is the, an

19

intent requirement, as Chief Justice Rehnquist recognized

20

in his separate opinion on certiorari in Geller vs.

21

Markham.

22

considerations to lead to a different conclusion in the

23

context of a limited class of Title VII cases does not

24

compel a particular construction of the Age Discrimination

25

Employment Act.

Our point about Section

The fact that the court found other

28
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

We have to look at those other considerations

2

that inform the construction of the Age Discrimination

3

Act.

4

QUESTION:

Well, I can see you point to (f) in

5

the reasonableness because there is no counterpart to that

6

in Title VII, but frankly --

7

MR. NAGER:

8

QUESTION:

9

That's -Frankly, I would find it unseemly to

take the identical words and say we ignore the comma in

10

one case.

11

to reach the same result.

12
13

If we had paid attention to the comma, you have

MR. NAGER:

I don't think it's unseemly at all,

Justice Ginsburg.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. NAGER:

16

QUESTION:

If you are wrong the first time.
Well, I'm not here to take -Which stare decisis would require us

17

to accept for Title VII but wouldn't require us to accept

18

for this statute.

19

QUESTION:

20

and you rejected it.

21

MR. NAGER:

That's the very point I made to you,
I said -Justice Ginsburg, this Court has on

22

any number of occasions, and I'll use the Chief Justice's

23

opinion in Fogerty vs. Fantasy as an illustration, said

24

that identical language in two separate statutes can be

25

given two different meanings by this Court if a single

29
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

meaning isn't compelled by the words themselves and if the

2

statute has different purposes or different legislative

3

history.

4

You coined that opinion.
QUESTION:

But here we know even though Griggs

5

didn't come until sometime later, the Congress did, when

6

it wrote the Age Discrimination Act, it did copy quite

7

deliberately the Title VII language.

8
9
10

MR. NAGER:

That is true.

But it is also the

case that it did not copy the 4(f)(1) language.

It is

also the case that at the time --

11

QUESTION:

But that's a different argument,

12

looking at the statute as a whole and saying whatever the

13

first part means, here we have another part that's absent

14

from Title VII so we don't have to interpret it the same

15

way.

16

MR. NAGER:

I have two points.

Congress

17

couldn't have known about Griggs at the time that the,

18

that it used the language from Title VII in 4(a) because

19

Griggs hadn't yet been decided, so that was not a

20

well-established construction by this Court in 1967.

21

you are also right, it is the essence of our argument

22

here, not to ask the Court to construe 4(a) in isolation.

23

It's to ask the Court to do as it did in Betts and as it

24

does in any number of cases to construe 4(a) in light of

25

the other provisions.

But

Justice Scalia has made the point

30
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

about the discharge for cause.

2

about the reasonable factors other than age.

3

intent-based provision and it shows that this statute at

4

every turn was concerned with employer intent, whether it

5

be good cause, whether it be decisions .

6

QUESTION:

We also make the point
That is an

What you do you with the argument,

7

which I think is an interesting one, that it is a

8

reasonable factors other than age requirement.

9

MR. NAGER:

10

QUESTION:

It is -If, if there were an intent

11

requirement in the act, it wouldn't matter whether you are

12

using reasonable factors or not, so long as you are not

13

using age.

14

That ought to be good enough, so long as blue eyes has

15

nothing to do with age.

16

You know, I don't like people with blue eyes.

MR. NAGER:

As you have pointed out, Justice

17

Scalia, it's perfectly appropriate for Congress to clarify

18

and make unambiguous in any respect conceivable that it

19

does not want any decision that's based upon a reasonable

20

factor to be subject to liability under this statute.

21

Secondly --

22

QUESTION:

Okay, but that argument is equally

23

compatible with the position that your brother is taking

24

on the other side, and if you take the ambiguity that is

25

left, and you combine it with the argument that Justice

31
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Ginsburg is making about the parallel language with Title

2

VII, doesn't it lead you to say all right, the parallel

3

language is answered only by an argument which in fact,

4

boils down to an ambiguity and an ambiguity doesn't defeat

5

the policy of construing like statutes, like drafted

6

statutes in a like manner.

7

MR. NAGER:

The answer to that is no.

The

8

reason that it's no is because whatever one thinks the

9

reasonable factor other than the word reasonable and the

10

reasonable factors other than age means, it's still a

11

motive-based test based upon what considerations are you

taking into account, and --

2

Interestingly enough, our opponents in both their opening

upon reasonable factors other than age is a reference to

an intent requirement, and the whole notion, as Justice

opening of this argument, is what distinguishes a

We recognize that employers have been

10

considering age for a long time.

11

Congress should prohibit is the use of age as a screening

12

device to filter.

13

human beings are human beings that employers will still be

14

cognizant of employees' age.

15

What we think the

Now, it will still be the case because

They can't help but be.

But so long as a reasonable factor other than

16

age is the basis of the decision, there should be no

18

QUESTION:

Yes, but why is that necessary to

19

deal with mixed motive?

20

motive by recognizing unreasonable factors other than age?

21

That's an equally mixed motive, if you would have an

22

unreasonable factor.

23

MR. NAGER:

Why can't you recognize mixed

Well, every time that the mixed

24

motive issue has been discussed, this Court in construing

25

Title VII, in construing the National Labor Relations Act,

1

in construing the Constitution, the 1983 and Mt. Healthy

2

cases, has always put a verb -- an adjective, motivating

3

factor, substantial factor.

4

common sense terms in writing these clarifying provisions

5

to make it clear that age had to be the but-for cause of

6

an employment action, and the employer had to intend it

7

that we give you the illustration, our brief of Judge

8

Wright's opinion for the D.C. circuit in Cuddy vs. Carmen,

9

which talks about how the two provisions were intended to

10

work in tandem just as Justice Kennedy's opinion for this

11

Court in Betts said that 4(f)(2) and 4(a) were supposed to

12

work in tandem to define the elements of a plaintiff's

13

case.

14

Congress is speaking in

Could 4(a) have been written and construed

15

without a clarifying provision?

16

be taking that position whether that additional language

17

was there or not.

18

the slightest that Congress went further and clarified

19

what the standards would be in a mixed motive case.

20

Of course.

And we would

But it doesn't weaken our argument in

QUESTION:

Well, what, what does seem to weaken

21

the argument is leaving even aside the mixed motive

22

argument, you were, you are arguing that a reasonable

23

factor test is proof that in fact it was a, an, a

24

malicious motive-based liability in the first place.

25

it seems to me that what you are saying, if that is true,

And

35
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

then any motive other than the proscribed one is going to

2

defeat liability.

3

MR. NAGER:

4

QUESTION:

That's correct.
And the odd thing is that you are

5

saying that by specifying a reasonable factor defense,

6

Congress was indicating that there would be an

7

unreasonable factor defense because reasonable or

8

unreasonable, if it's not age, there is no liability.

9

that it seems to me is an odd argument to say that by

And

10

putting in the word reasonable they are, they are in

11

effect confirming that an unreasonable defense would be

12

equally good.

13

MR. NAGER:

I think the answer to that question

14

is that reasonableness goes, is a permissible, the

15

reasonableness of a nondiscriminatory factor that an

16

employer offers is something that a judge can consider and

17

if he finds a disputed issue of fact, a jury can consider

18

in deciding whether or not the nondiscriminatory factor

19

that is offered is a pretext for age discrimination.

20

QUESTION:

But if you really held that reason.

21

In other words, the reasonableness of the, of the

22

employer's alleged motive goes somehow to the credibility

23

of the employer's argument that it was his motive, is that

24

what you are getting at?

25

MR. NAGER:

Correct.

As a logical point for defining the statute, it seems to

me that it's clear.

15

incompatible with disparate impact.

16

of intent, not one of statistical correlations with age

judgment which are the two core issues in a disparate

impact case.

20

Whether it's a reasonable motive or an

substantial that it itself would state a prima facie

2

violation and the jury is not allowed to question the

3

employer's business judgment if it finds that in fact the

4

employer was not motivated by age, and that makes a huge

5

difference at a practical level and a legal level in the

6

resolution of age discrimination cases, and that of course

7

is why we would say that impact claims should not be

8

recognized.

9

I'm sorry.
QUESTION:

Is there any way, which I'm sure you

10

don't want to bring up necessarily, but is there any way

11

short of saying there is never a disparate impact claim?

12

The problem that you mention could be alleviated.

13

think, for example, that unlike race or gender, we might

14

go into an ordinary company and find dozens or hundreds or

15

maybe virtually every rule or practice or limitation

16

connected with promotions is correlated with age.

17

MR. NAGER:

18

QUESTION:

If I

That's true.
On the other hand, you might have

19

some rules that are really correlated with age very

20

heavily and have no justification.

21

a way of dealing with that problem short of saying there

22

is never a disparate impact case?

23

MR. NAGER:

All right, so is there

Well, there is a way of dealing

24

with it.

O'Connor's opinion for the Court in Hazen Paper says that

3

merely showing a correlation is not enough to create an

inference of disparate treatment, but the court left open

factor, there was evidence that they thought that that

factor should be used.

And that's a reference to motive.

We know that from the

2

ordinary English language, we know it from this Court's

legislative history because the secretary of labor in

studying and reporting to Congress at Congress'

legislative direction distinguished between purposeful

uses of age as stereotypes of the abilities of older

8

workers, and other forces that adversely impact older

9

workers and what the secretary of labor recommended to

10

deal with your problem that you pointed out, Justice

11

Breyer, is not a coercive sanction that used, made neutral

MR. NAGER:

If we are talking about a disparate

2

treatment case, I agree with you, Justice Stevens, that in

3

an appropriate case with an appropriate statistical

4

presentation, a judge would be justified in saying that

5

the plaintiff has presented enough evidence to require the

6

employer to respond to a disparate treatment allegation.

7

Now, you know, it's hard to speak universally about

8

statistical presentations.

9

may satisfy Delbare, but don't tell us very much about the

Most of them in my experience

10

real merits of the case, but if we adopt as the premise

11

that you have got a particularly powerful statistical

12

presentation, I don't think there is any case law and

13

certainly not from this Court because Teamsters and cases

14

like that say that statistics are admissible to prove

15

intent, that a plaintiff couldn't have statistics alone as

16

their prima facie case, but it would be about intent, and

17

the employer would be responding about its own intent.

18

wouldn't be responding about as the employer does in Title

19

VII cases, about -- now, we not only had a good motive.

The difference is the absence of the words

11

in (f)2 when Betts was decided.

12

"otherwise prohibited" there would be a good argument that
